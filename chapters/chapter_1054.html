<h1>Chapter 1446:  The Earth Blood Ginseng</h1><p>“Form your formation and protect me.”</p><p>Elder Ye sat cross-legged on the ground, ordering four disciples to guard him. He had just broken the sacrificial altar's restriction.  Although protected by the auspicious glow, the secret realm still suppressed him, greatly exhausting him and worsening his injuries.  Leaving the trial ground and entering the inner hall presented unforeseen dangers.  Before proceeding, he needed to recuperate to avoid sudden calamity.</p><p>“No chance.”</p><p>Qin Sang, hidden in the woods, witnessed this, shaking his head silently. These old fellows were extremely cautious; it was difficult to find an opportunity to attack them.</p><p>Three elders, including the one with the long beard, were enough to withstand an initial ambush on Elder Ye.  He couldn't contact Su Nu for coordination.  Besides, since Su Nu was no longer in mortal danger, she didn't need to risk her life against a Yuan Ying master, and probably wouldn't want to.</p><p>After sitting quietly for a while, Elder Ye rose and left with his disciples. Throughout, he showed no intention of harming Su Nu. Qin Sang waited until the end, considering his deal with Su Nu complete.</p><p>“I wonder what use this Ghost Seal has. I’ll return it to her later,”</p><p>Qin Sang tossed the Ghost Seal in his hand, muttering.</p><p>Previously, Su Nu had been pessimistic, even despairing; she hadn't specified how the Ghost Seal would be returned.  Qin Sang had waited until now, fulfilling his obligation, but he'd already wasted too much time and wouldn’t search for her.</p><p>After Elder Ye and his group departed, Qin Sang, hidden in the shadows, appeared above the hills.  He tried several times but couldn't force out the divine platform. Clearly, there were unknown secrets.  Regardless of the Eastern Extreme League's plans, they didn't concern him. After a brief pause, Qin Sang stopped dwelling on it, flying towards the stone peak—it was time to leave the trial ground.</p><p>Stone Peak.</p><p>The Baobao Pavilion stood there, its treasures already plundered. Passing through the light screen would instantly teleport one away.</p><p>A flash of light.</p><p>Then, a gust of cold wind swept in.</p><p>Su Nu and the others shivered, looking around. They found themselves outside the trial ground, standing on a barren hillside.  The world was dark and gloomy, filled with ruins, unlike the imagined fairyland.</p><p>“This is the inner hall.”</p><p>Elder Ye said calmly, gesturing towards the front,  “Those who enter from the trial ground are teleported to the nearby mountains. See there? If you don’t wish to stay in the inner hall, the exit is there.”</p><p>Following Elder Ye's directions, they saw a deep valley, cliffs, a high platform, and an open stone gate on top.  The Yuan Ying cultivators, including Lingzhuzi, had entered through that gate.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Elder Ye glanced around, rising on his escaping light and flying deep into the inner hall. Su Nu and the others quickly followed.</p><p>Soon, Elder Ye entered a stone mountain.</p><p>As his figure landed, a shadow darted out from the darkness.</p><p>Su Nu and the others were startled, then recognized the person’s face, their expressions changing drastically. They hurriedly bowed, “Junior disciples pay their respects to the League Master!”</p><p>The person was the Eastern Extreme League Master, who had been waiting there after helping Elder Ye bypass the celestial barrier.</p><p>“Elder Ye?”</p><p>The Eastern Extreme League Master's eyes showed urgency, looking at Elder Ye with inquiry.</p><p>“All went well. I did not fail my mission!”</p><p>Elder Ye nodded in reply, omitting the setback at the Soul-Entrancing Cave.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>The Eastern Extreme League Master clapped, laughing. “Elder Ye, you have worked hard. If I hadn't already used my chance to participate in the trial, I would have gone in person. I wouldn't have made you take such a risk. How are your injuries?  Should I send someone to take you back to recuperate?”</p><p>The Eastern Extreme League Master asked with concern.</p><p>Elder Ye shook his head. “I’ve taken healing pills.  After resting somewhere for a while, I should recover some of my strength to retrieve that item… I must also thank the League Master for the information.”</p><p>The Eastern Extreme League Master didn’t press further, shifting his gaze to Su Nu and the others. “Only four of you?”</p><p>Elder Ye praised, “These few did well. Their contribution made the success possible.  By the way, this is Cleansing Soul Liquid…”</p><p>Elder Ye produced the Cleansing Soul Liquid and gave it to the Eastern Extreme League Master.</p><p>The Eastern Extreme League Master uttered an affirmative sound. “Good. There are a few places suitable for you to try your luck in the inner hall.  Your rewards will depend on your achievements. The Merchant League will have additional rewards for you upon your return!”</p><p>The Eastern Extreme League Master gave them a jade slip.</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others were overjoyed; their gloom over the loss of the Cleansing Soul Liquid lessened.</p><p>At that moment, the Eastern Extreme League Master suddenly looked at Su Nu and said calmly, “Su Nu, stay. The rest of you, proceed as you see fit.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The long-bearded elder and the others were full of questions, secretly glancing at Su Nu, but dared not ask anything. They took the jade slip and left together.</p><p>Elder Ye remained silent, bowing slightly to the Eastern Extreme League Master before departing.</p><p>Su Nu, bewildered, felt her heart tighten.</p><p>She thought the ordeal was over after leaving the trial grounds, but unexpectedly, the East Pole Master kept her behind.</p><p>The East Pole Master produced a jade bottle containing a snow-white pill, handing it to Su Nu with an unquestioning air.  "Refine this pill and the Soul Cleansing Liquid. I will personally protect your cultivation."</p><p>...</p><p>Trial Grounds.</p><p>Fire Heaven Domain.</p><p>Beneath the yellow sand, lava flowed freely, forming underground lava caves. Fire spirits frolicked in the lava, occasionally leaping out and disappearing into the earth's crust.</p><p>Each time, the lava boiled, and crimson flames shot into the sky.</p><p>In a secluded cave, Ning Wuhuai sat cross-legged.</p><p>Ignoring the intense heat, Ning Wuhuai arranged a complex altar beneath him, with a fist-sized spirit ginseng suspended before him.</p><p>The altar emitted beams of light, merging with the runes inscribed with Ning Wuhuai's blood essence, continuously flowing into the ginseng.</p><p>The ginseng, with distinct features and a body as translucent as blood glass, was bound by the altar. Runes flickered on its surface, its face contorted in pain, like a living infant.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai didn't compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid; instead, he came to the Fire Heaven Domain to harvest the spirit ginseng.</p><p>He had been here for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>The refinement of the ginseng on the altar was nearing completion.</p><p>Gradually, the ginseng's aura and Ning Wuhuai became one; its expression became numb.</p><p>"The ancient texts were right.  Using the Earth Blood Ginseng, one can create something akin to an external Nascent Soul!  This ginseng is filled with vital energy and has a strangely fragrant aroma. Once mature, it acts like a living creature, moving stealthily around its growth area. Catching it is no easy feat. Fortunately, it grew in the Fire Heaven Domain. The fire spirit energy dispersed the fragrance, and the vital energy blended with the crimson flames, making its color unusual.  A senior cultivator from the Heavenly Dao Sect mistook it for a unique fire spirit; otherwise, it would have been harvested long ago.  I must thank that senior for recording this as a curious anecdote…"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai, despite his great exhaustion, was joyful. He touched his forehead.</p><p>His primordial spirit merged, and the Earth Blood Ginseng's expression immediately became lively, transforming into a beam of blood light that entered his body.</p><p>Gathering his belongings, Ning Wuhuai emerged from the ground and flew towards the Hundred Treasures Pavilion.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I have a prior engagement today, so I'll owe you a chapter. I will make it up later.</p>
