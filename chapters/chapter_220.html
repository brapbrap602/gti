<h1>Chapter 213: Liquidating Goods</h1><p>At this moment, Corpse Fiend had already mingled into the humanoid cloud beasts or had already come out from within; Qin Sang fell behind as he hid from Mu Yifeng’s line of sight. He stealthily kept Corpse Fiend.</p><p>He followed them and saw that Mu Yifeng was standing at the entrance of the tunnel, his feet planted in hesitation.</p><p>Waves of cold demonic energy continuously surged out from within as eye-catching bloodstains on the ground were shocking to the eye. Bits of flesh and bone fragments were scattered all over as sounds of fighting and chewing were heard from within, it was clear that there were still many humanoid cloud beasts that had not been led out.</p><p>The strange scenes were bone-chilling.</p><p>Mu Yifeng stood at the entrance as the expression on his face flickered back and forth, he still did not dare to take that step into the tunnel.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he had already scouted the scene with the Corpse Fiend, Qin Sang would also have been as fearful and timid as Mu Yifeng after seeing such a scene. Earlier, when Corpse Fiend was sent into the tunnel, he was already prepared to sever ties with this Corpse Fiend.</p><p>“Mu-xiong, be careful,” Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>Mu Yifeng’s expression was extremely serious. He nodded at Qin Sang and entered the tunnel, concealed. He did not make Qin Sang wait for long before Mu Yifeng suddenly sped out and said in a deep voice: “Hurry! Leave!”</p><p>Following that, there was another round of chaos from within the tunnel. Qin Sang had anticipated this already and immediately used his body movement technique to follow up behind Mu Yifeng. They met up with the rest and Mu Yifeng urged everyone to leave quickly. He then took out a leg bone fragment.</p><p>“I did not dare to go too deep. I alerted those humanoid cloud beasts soon after entering and Daoist friend Yin was already torn apart by those cloud beasts. I only found a fragment of his remains.”</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Mu Yifeng had definitely seen that crack in the ground. In the end, he still did not dare to go down as the Sun Essence Crystal, no matter how valuable, was still just a spiritual material while his life was still more important.</p><p>Even Yin Xingge had ended up like this, who could know what terrifying things were down in the crack?</p><p>After seeing the leg bone fragments, everyone was terrified. They did not dare to linger and after they left the rift, they felt as if they had escaped a calamity.</p><p>Mu Yifeng said in a deep voice: “The mine vein has mutated. We must report this matter to the Shadow Guards. Skyvoid Town is the closest place to here. We might as well head there directly to Skyvoid Town and take a break.”</p><p>No one objected as they checked the direction before immediately flying towards Skyvoid Town.</p><p>…</p><p>Changyang Market Town.</p><p>It was on the only way to Skycrystal Mystery Realm. The size of this market town was bigger than Gubei Town and was unusually prosperous. It was all because many major sects and merchant associations had established their headquarters here.</p><p>Qin Sang left the inn with a black face mask on his face. He hurried towards a small alleyway.</p><p>After returning to Skyvoid Town, Qin Sang and the rest handed over the Sun Essence Quartz that they mined to the Shadow Guards’ base and reported on the mutation within the mine. The Shadow Guards Experts of Mount Shaohua and Xuanlang Pass went into the mine together to investigate.</p><p>Qin Sang did not wait for the result of the investigation. After receiving the good deed, he separated from Mu Yifeng and the rest. Traveling on his own, he came to Changyang Market Town.</p><p>There was still more than half a month’s journey from the Skycrystal Mystery Realm and he was not in a hurry to set off. Instead, he stayed in Changyang Market Town for two days before finally finding out the existence of a black market in the market town.</p><p>“Bang bang!”</p><p>Qin Sang entered the alley and stood before a small courtyard. According to some rules, he lightly patted the wooden door.</p><p>The wooden door opened, and a bearded strong man walked out. The cultivation of this strong man was not high, only around the tenth level of Qi Refining; however, Qin Sang knew that this person was only a gatekeeper.</p><p>The person who sold the certificate to Qin Sang had reminded him that there was no lack of experts guarding the black market. It was best not to rely on one’s own strength and attempt a forced seizure.</p><p>Qin Sang did not conceal his presence. After the strong man discovered Qin Sang’s cultivation, his pupils shrank. Nevertheless, he asked neither servilely nor overbearingly: “Senior, do you have a certificate?”</p><p>“Here!”</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately disguised his voice to sound extremely hoarse. He took out a black iron ring from his mustard seed bag and handed it to the strong man.</p><p>This black iron ring was not even considered as a low-grade magical instrument. Within it was just a special marking. It was used as a certificate. However, Qin Sang had used a medium-grade magical instrument to exchange for it.</p><p>The strong man accepted the black iron ring with both hands, examined it carefully, and respectfully said: “The certificate is correct, Senior, please enter!”</p><p>The courtyard was not large, and it was filled with杂物, looking like the residence of an ordinary person. The strong man led Qin Sang into a wing room. This wing room was completely different from the outside. Within it was unusually tidy. There was only a wooden chair and a wooden table facing the wall.</p><p>Entering the wing room, Qin Sang felt a strange feeling that he could not express. He swept his vision around and stared at the wall facing the chair and table. Earlier, he used his Divine Sense to sweep over it and discovered there were some hidden fluctuations there. There was a spirit formation!</p><p>The strong man turned and pointed to the chair as he said to Qin Sang: “Senior, please sit.”</p><p>"Having said that, the strong man took Qin Sang's black iron ring and gently touched it on the wall. He returned it to Qin Sang and quietly walked out.</p><p>After the black iron ring touched the wall, the spirit array on it became fully visible. The wall seemed to turn into water, and after a wave, an old face materialized.</p><p>The expression on the face quickly became vivid. Its eyes glanced at Qin Sang and it chuckled, "So it's a friend introduced by Boss Jiang. Please don't blame me, my friend. I'm doing a life-threatening business, so I have to be so cautious."</p><p>"Understandable."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. The Boss Jiang the face mentioned was the person who sold him the black iron ring.</p><p>He didn't deliberately remember the face. The face must be fake, and there was definitely no such person in Changyangfang City.</p><p>"What would you like to sell, my friend? Or do you need to buy something?"</p><p>Without further ado, the face asked bluntly.</p><p>"Sell something first, then buy something."</p><p>Qin Sang said in a deep voice. He reached for his mustard seed bag and a dozen or so multicolored streams of light flew out of the mustard seed bag, 'bang bang' landing on the table in front of him.</p><p>As the light dissipated, it turned out to be a piece of magic weapon.</p><p>Some of these magic weapons were obtained from the White Cloud Hermit and Wu Yuesheng, while others were magic weapons of the Demonic Cultivator he collected in the mine.</p><p>There were also the remains of Yin Xingge.</p><p>In addition to the spirit beast bag, the evil corpse also found several scattered magic weapons, some of which had been destroyed, and some were still intact.</p><p>The magic weapon that Yin Xingge could see had special effects, which were not common among cultivators. Qin Sang couldn't sell it to the store in a fair and aboveboard manner, so he had to go through the black market, and he also had another purpose.</p><p>Seeing these magic weapons, the face's eyes lit up, but it didn't ask more about the origin of the magic weapons. The spirit array turned its hand into a palm, picked up the magic weapon and identified it one by one before saying: "Your magic weapon is the best of its kind, how do you plan to sell it, my friend? Sell it directly to me, or wait for the auction?"</p><p>Qin Sang said in a condensed voice: "If I sell it to you directly, the price will be much lower, right?"</p><p>The face laughed dryly, "My friend, you're joking. I don't dare to boast about anything else, but my reputation is well-known. My friend will definitely have no worries if he sells things to me. Of course, my friend can also trade at the auction, but I can only guarantee that it will be absolutely safe at the auction.</p>
