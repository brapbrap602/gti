<h1>Chapter 701: The Proposal</h1><p>Chapter 701: The Proposal</p><p>Qin Sang said in a low voice, "Fellow Daoist Fan said in the market that you know a route through the Thousand Demon Sea.  Are you not trying to deceive me, Qin?"</p><p>The cultivators present had all seen Qin Sang inquiring about this route in the market, so they weren't surprised.</p><p>The short, stout cultivator chuckled, "Daoist Qin, don't worry. Your condition is the simplest, it's hardly a condition at all. This cave abode was discovered by me, Fan, along that route. Before we enter the Thousand Demon Sea, I will give you all a map…"</p><p>"The Thousand Demon Sea!"</p><p>"A cave abode in the Thousand Demon Sea?"</p><p>"Do you know how dangerous the Thousand Demon Sea is now?"</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd was startled and began to clamor.</p><p>The short, stout cultivator raised a hand to quiet them. "Everyone, please be calm.  While the cave abode is in the Thousand Demon Sea, it's far from where the evil cultivators are concentrated. As you all know, the accepted route is near the southernmost part of the Thousand Demon Sea, where the evil cultivators are most rampant. This cave abode, however, is in the northern part.  They are so far apart, and those evil cultivators, notorious as they are, can't achieve much in a short time and wouldn't dare risk angering the two races by extending their influence that far…"</p><p>After repeated assurances, the crowd finally accepted the short, stout cultivator's explanation.</p><p>For a moment, the island fell silent.</p><p>The short, stout cultivator didn't urge them, his expression radiating confidence.</p><p>Qin Sang weighed his options; he was inclined to agree. Both the Nascent Soul treasure and the sea route were worth the risk.</p><p>The personnel selected by the short, stout cultivator were all early-stage Core Formation cultivators. While they were all outstanding, Qin Sang was confident in himself. Even if he couldn't win a fight, no one could catch him.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang heard the scholar in green's voice transmission, "Daoist Qin, what have you decided?"</p><p>Qin Sang calmly countered, "Has Daoist Lan decided to accept Fellow Daoist Fan's proposal?"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Unexpectedly, the scholar in green readily agreed.  "The treasures Fellow Daoist Fan presented are not fake. If it were a trap, destroying three such valuable treasures would be absurd. My biggest concern is whether Fellow Daoist Fan is hiding something about the cold mist. Also, if the treasures are too valuable after breaking the restrictions, with human nature being what it is, I fear some unpleasant things might happen... I want to form a defensive alliance with Daoist Qin. What do you think?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly and pondered.</p><p>The scholar in green continued, "Look at the others, they probably have similar thoughts. I don't know the others, but I saw Daoist Qin first, and I found your demeanor impressive, so I wanted to propose this…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and saw two female cultivators had naturally gravitated towards each other.</p><p>The other three, including the short, stout cultivator, were all moving their lips, exchanging messages.</p><p>At this time, others also sent voice transmissions, which Qin Sang politely deflected. Finally, he transmitted to the scholar in green, "Very well, if we encounter danger, we can help each other…"</p><p>After a while.</p><p>After the two female cultivators finished talking, the one who spoke first asked the short, stout cultivator, "Fellow Daoist Fan, when do you plan to set off? Can you give us a few days to discuss and prepare?"</p><p>The short, stout cultivator chuckled. "Don't blame me for being cautious, but the treasures are valuable, so precautions are necessary. If you decide to go, tell me now and we leave immediately. If you can't decide now, I won't wait for you. We'll part ways as if we never met."</p><p>The female cultivator frowned, nodded, and whispered something to the other female cultivator. The two seemed to be arguing.</p><p>Perhaps they were supremely confident in their abilities.</p><p>Of the six people invited by the short, stout cultivator, Qin Sang and the other five readily agreed. The last one, a burly man with a dark complexion, hesitated considerably, exchanging voice transmissions with the short, stout cultivator for a long time before reluctantly agreeing.</p><p>The short, stout cultivator was overjoyed. He clapped his hands, stood up and said, "No time to waste, we'll travel overnight, preferably without stopping. Everyone, let's work hard."</p><p>As Core Formation masters, they weren't afraid of several days of continuous travel.</p><p>Seven streams of escaping light rose from the island. Qin Sang and the others followed behind the short, stout cultivator, soared into the air, and sped away.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to reveal his sword energy thunder sound and the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, and he didn't have a flying treasure on hand, so he had to use a flying artifact to travel.</p><p>Fortunately, the other cultivators were in a similar situation.</p><p>The journey was smooth.</p><p>After several days of monotonous flight, the group gradually became familiar with each other.  To alleviate boredom, they began to exchange their cultivation insights, and Qin Sang benefited greatly.</p><p>Reciprocating kindness, Qin Sang shared some insights.</p><p>His most impressive skill was swordsmanship.  He'd gained the "Thunderclap Sword Qi" and "Sword Light Divergence" abilities from his cultivation technique, but Qin Sang himself never slacked off.  Especially in the years immediately after forming his Golden Core, when he couldn't focus on cultivation, he dedicated himself to comprehending the way of the sword.</p><p>His aptitude wasn't as high as those swordsmanship prodigies, but aided by his technique, after a long period of study and contemplation, he'd made significant progress. His swordsmanship far surpassed that of the average cultivator.</p><p>With years of accumulated experience and improved cultivation, Qin Sang felt he'd soon independently master "Thunderclap Sword Qi".  At that point, he could achieve this swordsmanship realm through his own ability, no longer reliant on the Ebony Sword. Even if the Ebony Sword were temporarily unusable, he could still wield his skills.</p><p>However, mastering "Sword Light Divergence" was still a long way off.  But Qin Sang wasn't discouraged; the cultivation technique provided clear direction, making him luckier than others.</p><p>The atmosphere among the seven was very harmonious. After more than ten days of flight, they were nearing the Thousand Demon Sea.  The group became unusually vigilant, ceasing their careless flight and cautiously approaching their destination.</p><p>"Daoist Fan, might you present the map now?"</p><p>Finally reaching the northern edge of the Thousand Demon Sea, Qin Sang eagerly asked.</p><p>The stout cultivator produced a piece of animal hide.  "It seems Daoist Qin is impatient. The map is here; please take a look, everyone."</p><p>Qin Sang took it and saw a hand-drawn map on some kind of animal hide.  At the northern and southern ends of the Thousand Demon Sea, two winding routes were clearly marked, traversing the entire sea.</p><p>Surrounding the Thousand Demon Sea was the even more perilous boundless Demon Sea, teeming with demonic beasts and rarely visited by cultivators. Fortunately, the area where Fire Sparrows appear is near the Thousand Demon Sea, and reaching there wouldn't be far after passing through.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly memorized the map and passed it to the others.</p><p>"Why are there no cave dwellings marked?"</p><p>The lean old man frowned and questioned.</p><p>The stout cultivator chuckled lightly.  "The routes don't guarantee absolute safety. My escape techniques aren't great, and I fear that if you encounter danger, you'll abandon me. Let me keep that a secret for now. Also, this map was luckily obtained from a friend, and not many people know about it.  It's best not to reveal it casually, to avoid it becoming common knowledge."</p>
