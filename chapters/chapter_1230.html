<h1>Chapter 1222: Paying a Visit</h1><p>"Daoist Qing... Qingfeng..."</p><p>At the gates of the Shadowspring Sect.</p><p>Sect Master Dong stared at Qin Sang standing before him, feeling an overwhelming sense of unease. Years ago, he had supported Lu Xing in forming his Golden Core and had led an assault on the Blazing Demon Sect, intending to annex it. Unexpectedly, Daoist Qingfeng, who had been missing for a century, returned. In front of Sect Master Dong, Daoist Qingfeng single-handedly executed Lu Xing, purging the sect of its traitors.</p><p>Sect Master Dong had stood right beside Lu Xing, yet he hadn’t been able to react in time. He could only watch as Lu Xing turned to ash. Even now, the memory sent chills down his spine, and he would often wake in a cold sweat in the middle of the night. If Daoist Qingfeng had come for him, Sect Master Dong estimated his chances of escape at only seventy percent. He could only be grateful that the other party seemed to fear the Azure Sun Demon Sect and refrained from a full-scale massacre.</p><p>After all, no matter how powerful Daoist Qingfeng was, he wouldn’t dare act recklessly under the watch of a Nascent Soul cultivator. Time proved Sect Master Dong’s guess correct. Daoist Qingfeng had been unusually low-key since then, and the Blazing Demon Sect had obediently followed the Azure Sun Demon Sect’s commands. There was no sign of any expansionist ambitions.</p><p>This allowed Sect Master Dong to breathe a sigh of relief. At the very least, he didn’t have to worry about the Shadowspring Sect being eroded or replaced. He instructed his disciples to avoid any conflict with the Blazing Demon Sect, preferring to keep their distance and maintain a peaceful coexistence.</p><p>Three days later, Xiang Qing summoned the subordinate sects for a meeting. The Blazing Demon Sect had only one sect master who had barely formed a Golden Core and was of little importance. As long as they paid their tribute, it didn’t matter whether they attended or not. Yet, Daoist Qingfeng chose this moment to visit, requesting to accompany Sect Master Dong.</p><p>"What’s the matter, Sect Master Dong? Do you have some difficulty?" Qin Sang casually surveyed the Shadowspring Sect as he asked with an air of nonchalance.</p><p>Sect Master Dong forced a dry laugh and quickly replied, "No, no... It’s an honor to travel with Daoist Qingfeng! I plan to set off early tomorrow morning to avoid giving the Azure Sun Demon Sect the impression that we’re being disrespectful."</p><p>"I share the same thought. I’ll trouble Sect Master Dong for the night, then."</p><p>...</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Qin Sang and Sect Master Dong, along with their accompanying disciples, set off. During their time together, Sect Master Dong found that Qin Sang was rather amiable, holding no grudge against him for his past schemes against the Blazing Demon Sect. Gradually, Sect Master Dong’s wariness lessened, and he even began to entertain thoughts of forming an alliance.</p><p>The Azure Sun Demon Sect was only a nominal overlord and wouldn’t interfere in the power struggles between subordinate sects. The two sects could very well join forces and achieve great things together. Unfortunately, Qin Sang had no interest in such trivial matters, leaving Sect Master Dong’s efforts wasted.</p><p>Qin Sang was preoccupied with the upcoming visit to the Azure Sun Demon Sect. He needed to directly absorb and refine the Ancestral Sacred Flame, which would inevitably cause tremors in the Divine Peak. Using the same infiltration method as before would no longer be feasible. Xiang Qing was not someone to be trifled with.</p><p>After considering the intelligence he had gathered, Qin Sang decided to pay a formal visit.</p><p>...</p><p>At the gates of the Azure Sun Demon Sect.</p><p>Numerous disciples stood at attention, awaiting guests from all directions. Since Patriarch Xiang’s breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage, the Azure Sun Demon Sect had finally regained its former glory. Now, Xiang Qing’s reputation rivaled that of the Nether Demon Lord, and his status was as weighty as a thousand mountains. Every disciple felt a sense of pride, their joy evident on their faces.</p><p>Qin Sang and Sect Master Dong ascended the jade steps on foot. The Shadowspring Sect held a significant position in the demonic territories, and upon seeing their arrival, the Azure Sun Demon Sect disciples quickly composed themselves and stepped forward to greet them.</p><p>"Welcome, Sect Master Dong and..."</p><p>A Foundation Establishment youth stepped forward, bowing respectfully. However, when he saw Qin Sang, he hesitated, unsure of the masked figure’s identity.</p><p>"This is Daoist Qingfeng, the founding ancestor of the Blazing Demon Sect. He has come with me to pay respects to Senior Xiang," Sect Master Dong introduced on his behalf.</p><p>The Blazing Demon Sect...</p><p>The youth racked his brain but couldn’t recall any founding ancestor of the Blazing Demon Sect. However, the man before him was a genuine Golden Core cultivator, so he dared not be disrespectful. He bowed again and said, "Greetings, Daoist Qingfeng. Our patriarch has already given instructions. Please follow me to the Guest Peak for temporary lodging."</p><p>"Thank you for guiding us, young friend."</p><p>Sect Master Dong’s attitude toward the youth was quite amiable. The youth, aware that this respect was due to his sect’s patriarch, felt a surge of pride.</p><p>As they bypassed a massive stone monument and entered the Azure Sun Demon Sect, Qin Sang, revisiting familiar scenery, suddenly called the youth over and asked, "I’ve heard that Ice Mistress Hanbing of the Ethereal Spirit Sect is currently a guest here. Is that true?"</p><p>The youth looked puzzled and replied, "Forgive me, Daoist Qingfeng, but I am unaware of this."</p><p>Sect Master Dong glanced at Qin Sang in surprise, wondering where this old demon had obtained such information.</p><p>"Why is he suddenly asking about Ice Mistress Hanbing? Does this old demon have some scheme in mind?" Sect Master Dong muttered inwardly. With a Nascent Soul patriarch overseeing the Azure Sun Demon Sect, unless this man had a death wish...</p><p>The Guest Peak was the mountain closest to the inner sect of the Azure Sun Demon Sect. The group followed the youth as they flew leisurely toward it.</p><p>Just as they were nearing the Guest Peak, a radiant light suddenly shot toward them from ahead. Upon closer inspection, it was a burly man clad in armor.</p><p>"Well, well, if it isn’t Old Demon Dong!"</p><p>The man burst into laughter upon seeing them. His light shifted direction, heading straight for them as he shouted, "Old Demon Dong, I’ve been wanting to spar with you for a while now! You ran away last time, but where will you hide today?"</p><p>Sect Master Dong’s expression darkened at the sight of the man. In the demonic territories, aside from the major sects overseen by Nascent Soul patriarchs, there were several demonic sects whose strength surpassed that of the Shadowspring Sect. This man’s sect was one of them.</p><p>Moreover, the man’s cultivation surpassed Sect Master Dong’s, having reached the peak of the late Golden Core stage. The two had always been at odds. Knowing he was no match, Sect Master Dong had avoided the man to save face. He hadn’t expected the man to return from the front lines.</p><p>"This is the sect master of the Fist Intent Sect, who calls himself the Mountain Shaking Divine Lord. He’s arrogant and unruly," Sect Master Dong transmitted to Qin Sang.</p><p>However, he noticed that Qin Sang paid no attention, instead flying toward the inner sect of the Azure Sun Demon Sect. Qin Sang stopped at the entrance, gazing deep into the inner sect, causing the Azure Sun Demon Sect disciples stationed there to tense up, as if facing a great enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang’s actions were too conspicuous.</p><p>Even the Mountain Shaking Divine Lord, who had been harassing Sect Master Dong, turned his attention toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had merely used a simple technique to suppress his cultivation, but it was enough to conceal his true strength from the Mountain Shaking Divine Lord.</p><p>The Mountain Shaking Divine Lord could tell that Qin Sang was a fellow cultivator, but his aura suggested he had only recently formed his Golden Core. He sneered at Sect Master Dong, "Is that brat a newly formed Golden Core disciple of yours? How presumptuous! He doesn’t even know to greet his elders! Hiding his face and playing mysterious—he takes after you quite well."</p><p>Sect Master Dong’s heart stirred. If this man could provoke Daoist Qingfeng, it might just be a case of using a tiger to devour a wolf. He immediately rebuked, "Mountain Shaking Demon, this is the Azure Sun Demon Sect! Don’t you dare cause trouble here!"</p><p>The Mountain Shaking Divine Lord grinned ferociously, about to use this as an excuse to teach Qin Sang a lesson. But upon seeing Sect Master Dong’s expression, he sensed something amiss and hesitated.</p><p>Sect Master Dong inwardly sighed in disappointment.</p><p>The Azure Sun Demon Sect youth opened his mouth, about to say something.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>A deep, resonant voice suddenly boomed from within the inner sect of the Azure Sun Demon Sect, rolling outward like thunder.</p><p>"Which fellow Daoist is teasing Xiang? You nearly made me forget my manners as a host."</p>
