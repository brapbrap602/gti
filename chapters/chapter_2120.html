<h1>Chapter 2110: Imprisoning Heaven Golden Lock</h1><p>A man in white flew directly south from the Western Lands, over the sea, constantly watching his back.  </p><p>Though his surroundings were calm, his apprehension grew stronger.</p><p>As he suspected, an unusual fluctuation soon appeared in his spiritual perception; a streak of light rapidly approaching.</p><p>The man’s expression changed slightly, but he showed no panic.  A moment later, however, a look of surprise flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Seeing was believing—the pursuer's escape technique was truly remarkable. He had thought Min Zhuo’s description was exaggerated, but now it seemed an understatement.</p><p>The man in white pondered silently, maintaining his speed. Soon, he heard thunder echoing, and the sea surged violently behind him.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, halting in mid-air, turning to look back.  A dazzling ray of lightning, as if piercing the void, approached with breathtaking speed.</p><p>The lightning illuminated the entire sea area.  A booming voice, louder than the thunder, rolled across the water.</p><p>“Since you’ve come, why the hasty departure?”</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The voice echoed across the sea. The lightning stopped abruptly, and a man in green robes stepped out, his eyes sharp as he glared at the man in white—Qin Sang.</p><p>The man in white didn’t flinch, meeting Qin Sang’s gaze.  Their eyes clashed, as if tangible, stirring up the waves.</p><p>Qin Sang’s pupils constricted. The man in white hadn’t concealed his identity, or perhaps he didn't need to; the characteristics of the Si You tribe were too distinctive. They relied on spirit beasts for combat, revealing their identity in any fight.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank. He hadn't expected the Si You tribe to arrive so quickly.</p><p>The altar was incomplete.  If the Si You tribe launched an attack now, it would be a devastating setback.  The altar was almost finished; Qin Sang couldn't bear to abandon it. He had to stall them, no matter what.</p><p>He looked around; only one person was present,  more like a scout, which slightly eased his mind.</p><p>Yet, this scout possessed the cultivation of a mid-stage Void Realm, level two cultivator.  Their strength was considerable and could not be underestimated.</p><p>Faced with Qin Sang’s question, the man in white remained calm and composed, countering, "You are the demon beast guardian of the Si family remnant, are you not?"</p><p>His composure was unclear;  was he bluffing, or truly fearless?</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, “I don’t know who you’re referring to. You secretly infiltrated my Daoist grounds; what is your purpose? You should give me an explanation.”</p><p>The man in white laughed heartily. “What use is denial? I advise you to cease your defiance. Hand over the Si family remnant immediately, or you will surely die!”</p><p>After issuing his threat, the man in white turned and fled, his figure transforming into three white lights, each shooting in a different direction.</p><p>Before the lights traveled far, a thunderclap sounded. Three bolts of green lightning struck the white lights at even greater speed, accurately hitting their targets. Two lights flickered violently and vanished.</p><p>A muffled groan came from the remaining white light, and a figure fell out—the man in white.  He looked disheveled, glaring at the source of the attack: Qin Sang, surrounded by lightning, stepped forward.</p><p>“You could see through my Yuan Meng Illusionary Body!”</p><p>The Yuan Meng Illusionary Body was the man's spirit beast ability, used to confuse opponents in both attack and retreat, with consistent success.</p><p>His opponent showed no hesitation, directly targeting his true body.  Clearly, his location was already known. Yet Qin Sang displayed no aura of any magical abilities or treasures.</p><p>The more mysterious the opponent, the more intimidating they were. The man in white felt a growing sense of unease.</p><p>Qin Sang disdained to answer. No illusory technique could deceive the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Both he and the butterfly were at the same cultivation level; the butterfly instantly detected his true form the moment he used the technique, leaving him nowhere to hide.</p><p>“You seem to have something left unsaid. Why the rush to leave? Stay and let’s clarify things!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was calm, but his actions were fierce. He summoned a spirit tablet, which instantly transformed into a mountain-sized stele, crashing down toward the man in white!</p><p>A strong wind assaulted the man in white, who retorted, "You dare to obstruct me with your true form! Quite bold!"</p><p>Min Zhuo and others had gathered some intelligence, discovering that this demon cultivator possessed a Dharma Image, but came in his true form— likely sensing something amiss with the altar and rushing to investigate.</p><p>In the man's view, this might be an opportunity.</p><p>If he could kill his opponent here, it would be equivalent to crippling Si Lu, a significant achievement.</p><p>Of course, the man in white knew that if his opponent dared to chase him out, he must have some backing. This was the opponent's home turf, and other experts might be closing in.  He didn't have much time; the opportunity was fleeting.</p><p>In an instant, the man in white made his decision. The pearl on his forehead flickered slightly, and a wisp of white smoke rose, coalescing into a cloud above his head.</p><p>The cloud twisted and changed, vaguely taking on the shape of a beast, finally transforming into a giant white rhinoceros. Its legs were thick, its body as massive as a mountain, and a sharp horn grew from its large head, no less impressive than Qin Sang's spirit tablet.</p><p>The rhinoceros roared, its horn suddenly rising, the sharp point piercing the wind as it charged towards the spirit tablet.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Two terrifying forces erupted simultaneously, the sky and earth collapsing, and monstrous waves surging.</p><p>The rhinoceros held its ground against the spirit tablet, but its legs trembled, its neck twisted grotesquely, until finally, it could no longer hold on, its roar becoming distorted.</p><p>The man in white's face changed slightly. He hadn't expected his opponent, who was a realm lower, to possess such immense strength. This rhinoceros was the best of his four beasts at close-quarters combat, and yet it was still no match for his opponent.</p><p>The rhinoceros retreated, leaving the man in white exposed, but he was prepared. A pair of wings had appeared on his back, unseen until now.  An outsider might mistake them for two winged beings fighting.</p><p>The man in white's wings were a dark gray, far less dazzling than Qin Sang's phoenix wings, but the speed they unleashed was remarkable.  He left a trail of dark shadows in the air, escaping the danger before the rhinoceros fell.</p><p>Simultaneously, the small snake in his sleeve flicked its tongue, secretly spitting a drop of transparent venom.</p><p>As he retreated, the man in white broke through a wave, secretly releasing the venom into the water. It was completely undetectable.  The wave crashed back down, and the venom spread unseen through the sea.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The waves roared.</p><p>Two figures faced each other from a distance.</p><p>The rhinoceros, seemingly without pain, shook its head, returning to normal and resuming its charge towards Qin Sang.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>In an instant, the horn collided with the spirit tablet several times, repeatedly unleashing blinding light. The shockwaves turned the surroundings upside down.</p><p>The rhinoceros fought without fear of death, protecting its master.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his Dharma image and the activated Great Vajra Wheel Seal, was even more powerful. The heavy spirit tablet moved in his hands like a needle, without any set form, effortless yet incredibly tricky.</p><p>An ordinary spirit beast would have to protect its vital points, hindering its movements. While the rhinoceros lacked such points, it was still quite battered.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if Qin Sang could overwhelm the rhinoceros, it was useless if he couldn't harm the man in white.</p><p>While the rhinoceros and Qin Sang grappled, the man in white used his wings to constantly move, preventing Qin Sang from targeting him.  His speed wasn't as fast as Qin Sang's thunder escape, but it was incredibly agile.  Combined with the rhinoceros's desperate defense, Qin Sang had tried several times but couldn't break through their blockade to attack the man in white directly.</p><p>This went on several times, and Qin Sang found himself at his wit's end.</p><p>In contrast, the man in white grew more composed. Seizing an opening, he suddenly tilted his head and let out a piercing shriek.</p><p>The shriek was earth-shattering. Qin Sang felt a slight pain in his ears. The sound seemed to come from all directions, and then his vision suddenly darkened. Four strange birds had appeared around him.</p><p>These birds had their heads down and bodies up; their heads were pointed, and their wings were enormous.  The four birds spread their wings simultaneously, like eight screens, surrounding Qin Sang.</p><p>They were completely black, like figures from an ink painting, closing in amidst the shrill cries.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted quickly, immediately forcing back the rhinoceros. With a flick of his wrist, he swept the spirit tablet in all directions.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The first bird hit by the spirit tablet exploded, turning into a pool of black water.  The black water dispersed into black raindrops, dyeing the sea black.</p><p>The other birds weren't deterred by the gruesome fate of the first. Their attack became even more ferocious.</p><p>While Qin Sang was fully engaged with the strange birds, Bai Xi, having recovered from its previous exertion, attacked again.  Its head lowered, its eyes glowing a幽蓝, it moved in perfect coordination with the birds.  As it neared Qin Sang, its speed suddenly increased by almost fifty percent.</p><p>This attack was too sudden. The birds held onto the spirit tablet in Qin Sang’s hand, and it seemed he wouldn't have time to react.</p><p>Just as it seemed the rhino horn would pierce his chest, Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He suddenly reached out his left hand and grabbed the horn.</p><p>A suit of armor appeared on his body—the Mingshan Armor.</p><p>A terrifying force surged from the rhino horn.  Under this impact, the Mingshan Armor rattled, its spiritual light fluctuating violently.</p><p>But Qin Sang's grip remained firm, preventing the horn from moving forward even a fraction!</p><p>As a semi-physical cultivator, Qin Sang relied not on spiritual treasures, but on his powerful physique, enhanced by his Dharma-image and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>…</p><p>Bai Xi roared furiously, unable to shake off Qin Sang's grasp. A fierce glint flashed in its eyes, and a blue light appeared on the tip of its horn.</p><p>The blue light resembled the pure sky after rain, but Qin Sang's eyelids twitched, a warning flaring in his heart.</p><p>He acted decisively, channeling a sliver of the Azure Luan True Thunder from his phoenix wings into his left hand. The thunder and the blue light erupted almost simultaneously.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai Xi were both thrown back, a huge cyan-blue orb appearing between them.</p><p>The orb expanded at an astonishing speed, its inner cyan and blue lights seemingly devouring each other, violent fluctuations spreading wave after wave.</p><p>The void was filled with chaotic light and shadow.  The stalemate lasted only a moment before the cyan light gained the upper hand.</p><p>The power of the Azure Luan True Thunder was undeniable. It overwhelmed its opponent.  Within the orb, the cyan light rapidly gained dominance, transforming into a raging torrent that broke through the blue light's blockade and threatened to engulf Bai Xi.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bai Xi did not dodge, allowing itself to be consumed by the cyan light. Countless thunderbolts erupted from its body, tearing it to pieces.</p><p>However, Bai Xi's fragments did not dissipate; instead, they transformed into streams of water, suspended in mid-air, forming a dense net that encircled the battlefield.</p><p>"To force me to use my ultimate technique, Soul Annihilation, you should be proud!"</p><p>The man in white, with an air of pride, revealed the small snake hidden in his sleeve. The snake poked its head out, hissing.</p><p>At this moment, Bai Xi, the strange birds, and the snake—his three companion beasts—were unleashed.</p><p>The man in white's ultimate technique, Soul Annihilation, was created by combining the abilities of his three beasts.  Anyone struck by this technique would not only have their physical body disintegrate instantly, but their soul would be destroyed as well—hence the name, Soul Annihilation!</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Black seawater began to flow upwards, the remaining strange bird dissolving on its own, the upper and lower streams of black water attempting to merge.</p><p>Simultaneously, a thick fog rose from the water net. In an instant, black mist enveloped the entire sea area, swallowing Qin Sang whole.</p><p>The mist was incredibly light yet tenacious, like cotton, perfectly capable of overcoming Qin Sang's physical cultivation through softness.</p><p>The man in white's carefully prepared technique was naturally more powerful than this. The black mist rapidly converged towards the center.  Anyone inside who could not escape immediately would be in grave danger.  Just as a smile appeared on the man in white's face, his pupils suddenly constricted, reflecting a dazzling golden light.</p><p>From the heart of the black mist, golden light shot into the sky, a golden sun rising, like fire melting ice, the surrounding black mist dissipating before it.</p><p>Below the golden sun, a figure, shrouded in golden light, stood motionless in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, lightly moving his fingers as if plucking strings.  Several transparent water threads surrounded him, now gently trembling, revealing gaps.</p><p>Calmly, he slipped through the openings, unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Sun Wheel Seal and, leveraging the residual power of the Azure Luan True Thunder, broke through the man in white's technique. But this didn't mean he was safe; dangers still lurked.</p><p>The transparent water threads were a potent poison.  Anyone unaware of this who touched them would suffer severely from the poison entering their body. Fortunately, Qin Sang had previously cultivated poison techniques, and his prior alertness prevented him from acting rashly after falling into the mist, allowing him to completely neutralize the technique.</p><p>The man in white's expression stiffened slightly, but he already knew Qin Sang possessed this golden sun technique, so he wasn't overly surprised. A cold smile spread across his face. "I underestimated you!"</p><p>"Let's see how much you can endure, whether you can withstand the Heaven-Binding Golden Lock!"</p><p>The man in white roared, shaking his sleeve, sending a golden light flying out, mirroring the Sun Wheel Seal above Qin Sang's head.</p><p>The golden light revealed a large golden ring lock!</p><p>The Heaven-Binding Golden Lock soared high, resembling another golden sun, yet even more brilliant, making the Sun Wheel Seal appear dim in comparison.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed; the fluctuations from this treasure seemed familiar, giving him an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p>Golden light shone, the world bathed in gold.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The Heaven-Binding Golden Lock trembled slightly, emitting a crisp sound, like the closing of a lock.</p><p>The next moment, everything around seemed to freeze, all sounds ceasing!</p><p></p>
