<h1>Chapter 1582: Bai's Southern Journey</h1><p>Having successfully devoured a bolt of tribulation lightning, the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly gently flapped its wings, descending a short distance before hovering in mid-air.</p><p>Resting briefly, the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly then soared upwards again. Qin Sang opportunely let through a bolt of tribulation lightning, creating a safe environment for the butterfly.</p><p>It was also because the first wave of tribulation lightning was slightly weaker. Qin Sang only needed the Golden Deep Sword and his sword array to withstand the Heavenly Tribulation, and it wasn't time to utilize the Profound Mirror Cold Gale Formation yet.</p><p>Soon, the first wave of tribulation lightning neared its end. The Heaven-Eyed Butterfly only managed to devour two bolts.</p><p>Faint arcs of lightning flickered on her wings, and her pair of Heaven Eyes resembled eyes of thunder, emitting a strange light and a daunting aura of tribulation lightning.</p><p>Apart from this, there were no other visible changes in the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Bai had once evaluated the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly, saying that devouring tribulation lightning represented her possessing unlimited potential, but to truly mature and help Qin Sang overcome his tribulations, there was still a long road ahead.</p><p>During the interval between tribulation waves, the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly landed back on Qin Sang's shoulder, fully absorbing the power of the tribulation lightning within her body.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the vast sky.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation triggered celestial phenomena. The tribulation clouds stretched beyond the horizon, and the gale could directly tear up the turf. The nearby wasteland was a scene of devastation.</p><p>At the heart of the tribulation clouds, the qi churned and the tribulation lightning brewed. Earth-shattering explosions echoed from the sky incessantly, and the center of the tribulation clouds grew increasingly brighter, with electric arcs flashing continuously.</p><p>The electric arcs tore the tribulation clouds, revealing a glimpse of what lay within: countless lightning pythons coiled there, harboring terrifying tribulation lightning power.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression gradually grew solemn.</p><p>Rumbling sounds continued, the electric arcs within the tribulation clouds grew denser, and even before the tribulation lightning descended, its momentum already surpassed the first wave.</p><p>Countless electric arcs filled the sky, converging on the surface of the tribulation clouds to form thumb-thick lightning serpents, which detached from the clouds and fell.</p><p>All the tribulation lightning simultaneously targeted Qin Sang. Countless lightning serpents converged towards the same direction, gathering above Qin Sang's head. The naked eye could no longer discern whether they had merged or not.  A tremendously thick lightning pillar crashed down!</p><p>Qin Sang's scalp tingled. Not daring to be careless, he swiftly executed hand seals to activate the Profound Mirror Cold Gale Formation.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>A cold wind swept through the formation, the temperature plummeting.</p><p>Thick profound ice condensed on the ground, plunging the area into winter in an instant.</p><p>However, the power of the formation was limited to the area surrounding Qin Sang. The cold wind, tangible and frosty, swirled around him.</p><p>The cold wind formed hundreds of cyclones, positioned precisely three zhang above Qin Sang and distributed with remarkable regularity, forming a hemisphere centered on him.</p><p>The cyclones rapidly formed, then abruptly solidified, transforming into round ice mirrors. Their surfaces faced the tribulation clouds above, reflecting the lightning and gleaming brightly.</p><p>The cold wind within the formation grew fiercer, obscuring Qin Sang's figure.  A continuous flow of cold energy supported and reinforced the ice mirrors.</p><p>The instant the formation took shape, the tribulation lightning descended!</p><p>Qin Sang repeated his previous tactic, silently channeling sword incantations. A beam of sword light shot skyward. The space illuminated by the tribulation lightning suddenly darkened. Countless sword threads formed a dense sword net, which was then struck by the aggressive tribulation lightning, becoming exceptionally bright.</p><p>The sword net and tribulation lightning instantly intertwined, crackling loudly. Countless bolts of tribulation lightning dissipated within the sword array, but the sword net was also torn apart layer by layer.</p><p>Moreover, the tribulation lightning wasn't just this one strike; countless lightning serpents continued to fall from above.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang actively lowered the sword array, almost merging it with the Profound Mirror Cold Gale Formation. Sword threads and ice mirrors intermingled, then were both engulfed by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>‘Bang, Bang, Bang…’</p><p>Struck by the tribulation lightning, the ice mirrors trembled incessantly. Bursts of cold light erupted from their surfaces, like blooming ice flowers, coldly beautiful and stunning.</p><p>The ice flowers, sword threads, and tribulation lightning together painted a rare and wondrous spectacle.</p><p>The seemingly thin ice mirrors proved exceptionally sturdy, continuously absorbing the cold wind below.  Cooperating with the sword array, they reflected countless bolts of tribulation lightning back.  Only after seeing the situation stabilize did Qin Sang allow some tribulation lightning to leak through for the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly to absorb.</p><p>While he was concentrating on overcoming his tribulation…</p><p>In the northern region of the wasteland, there were some scattered mountain ranges.</p><p>Within an unnamed valley…</p><p>The valley was perpetually shrouded in mist, and within it resided a cultivator family of moderate strength.</p><p>Of course, this was only relative to the surrounding area. The family patriarch was a late Gold Core cultivator, entirely insignificant in the context of the entire Central Plains.</p><p>Due to their proximity, the commotion caused by Qin Sang's tribulation alarmed the cultivators within the valley.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Streaks of light of various colors emerged from the mist one after another, revealing an elder already standing there.</p><p>“Greetings, Patriarch!”</p><p>Everyone followed the patriarch's gaze towards the center of the wasteland.</p><p>From their distance, they could only vaguely see the qi in the sky converging abnormally, but the oppressive pressure of the Heavenly Might was distinct, filling them with awe and trepidation.</p><p>“Which senior is undergoing tribulation there?”</p><p>A young woman gasped, covering her mouth, both frightened and curious.</p><p>The Central Plains was teeming with experts. Even if they hadn't met them, they had heard various legends.</p><p>“The wasteland is desolate, with no major powers nearby. I recall our family records mentioning a senior who also underwent tribulation here before. This senior isn't undergoing tribulation within a sect, but outside. Could it be a rogue cultivator?” a middle-aged man beside the young woman spoke.</p><p>This man, dressed in Daoist robes and bearing similar facial features to the young woman, held a high position among the group. He looked inquiringly at the patriarch.</p><p>The patriarch nodded. “Those at the Gold Core stage, follow me. The rest, return to the valley!”</p><p>The young man and woman, though reluctant, dared not disobey the patriarch's order and flew back to the valley.</p><p>The remaining few followed the patriarch, intentionally landing on the ground and using movement techniques to approach the site of the tribulation.</p><p>As they traveled, the elder revealed a little-known secret for the first time to his descendants:  “Three thousand years ago, a senior passed through this wasteland. For unknown reasons, he was grievously injured and hastily underwent tribulation, perishing beneath the Heavenly Tribulation. Our ancestor obtained the remnants of his Nascent Soul and rose to prominence… The Hengming Sect and the Lu Family should also be mobilizing. If there's an opportunity to seize the remnants of a Nascent Soul, it will be a fierce battle. Be prepared. But remember this: unless you're certain the person undergoing tribulation has perished, do not approach!”</p><p>“May this senior meet his demise!” the middle-aged cultivator sneered, his face filled with anticipation.</p><p>The group traversed the wilderness, witnessing the tribulation clouds in the sky. They were all awestruck by the terrifying tribulation lightning and stopped at a distance.</p><p>“So this is the Heavenly Tribulation… Truly world-destroying…”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator stared transfixed at the tribulation lightning, filled with both reverence and fear, murmuring to himself. Suddenly, a whooshing sound startled him.  Focusing his gaze, he saw a blade light hurtling towards them from the sky above.</p><p>The group was greatly alarmed.  With seamless coordination, they summoned identical spirit swords, forming a sword array around the patriarch.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The blade light pierced directly through the sword array, its residual power carving a trench hundreds of zhang long into the ground. The trench and the surrounding wilderness were instantly frozen.</p><p>The sword array was broken on the spot, the flying swords scattering and freezing into ice chunks, some even shattering.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A cold shout followed, echoing in their ears.</p><p>The Gold Core cultivators stared blankly at the broken swords, chills running down their spines.  Without even seeing their opponent's figure, they fled north in panic.</p><p>On the Flying Cloud River…</p><p>Originating from the Northern Wastelands and flowing into the Southern Sea, traversing the Central Plains, the Flying Cloud River was also a major waterway on the continent.  Countless vessels plied its surface, both cultivators' treasure ships and mortals' merchant ships, each with its own designated channels.</p><p>At this moment, a green-curtained treasure ship sailed from north to south.</p><p>The green-curtained treasure ship traveled in the center of the river at lightning speed.</p><p>Not only mortal merchant ships, but even other treasure ships would actively give way when encountering it, solely because an elder sat cross-legged at the stern of the green-curtained vessel.</p><p>The elder had a sinister expression, his cultivation unmasked – he was a Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor!</p><p>Light gauze curtains adorned the treasure ship, and from within came the delicate sounds of stringed and bamboo instruments, accompanied by the shadows of graceful dancers.  A dignified Nascent Soul Grand Ancestor remained outside the curtains. If even he wasn't qualified to enter, how terrifying must be the identity of those within?</p><p>A few discerning cultivators noticed a blood moon mark on the elder's forehead.  Recalling a certain legend in the cultivation world, they couldn't help but gasp, daring even less to offend.</p><p>The green-curtained treasure ship sailed downstream, unimpeded.</p><p>Although the gauze curtains weren't particularly thick, outsiders could only see blurred shadows, sparking their imaginations.</p><p>Inside the curtains…</p><p>Two tables were placed on either side, laden with jade nectar, spirit fruits, and immortal delicacies, their fragrances intoxicating.</p><p>Two men sat cross-legged behind the tables.</p><p>A large space remained between them.</p><p>A woman plucked the strings of a zither. This woman, dressed in plain green robes and possessing an ethereal air, was not only a skilled musician but also a breathtaking beauty.</p><p>As she played, the woman in green didn't look at the strings but instead gazed at the white-robed man behind the table on the left, her beautiful eyes full of affection.</p><p>In addition, six dancing girls, whose beauty rivaled the woman in green, performed a graceful dance. They too, with expressions of both coquettishness and joy, lingered their gazes upon the man, their overflowing affection almost palpable.</p><p>The man, dressed in white robes with a jade belt and possessing a dashing and romantic air, was none other than the Divine Transformation stage adopted son, Su Zinan!</p><p>The woman in green was a Gold Core female cultivator who had miraculously survived twenty-odd years ago.  The other women were Su Zinan's beautiful wives and concubines, gathered along his journey.</p><p>His taste was impeccable; each one was a stunning beauty.</p><p>Su Zinan had actually left Luye and appeared in the Central Plains, and moreover, he made no attempt to conceal his identity, openly allowing a Nether Moon Guard to steer the ship.</p><p>Su Zinan, indulging in his debauchery, downed a cup of fine wine and beckoned with a wave of his hand.</p><p>The woman in green gladly fell into his embrace, and the zither strings continued to play without anyone touching them.</p><p>Embracing the beauty's slender waist, Su Zinan inhaled deeply and looked at the man opposite him. “Fellow Daoist Mo, what do you think of this ‘Rainbow-Skirted Goddess’ melody?”</p><p>The man opposite, whose bearing and appearance were no less impressive than Su Zinan's, remained impassive and unsmiling, creating an aura that kept others at a distance.</p><p>He didn't look at the beauties, nor did he drink the fine wine.  His eyes were closed, as if he were cultivating and adjusting his qi. He shook his head slightly. “Mo is unrefined and不懂风情, making Fellow Daoist Su laugh.”</p><p>Su Zinan sighed. “Beautiful women are the most wonderful things in the world. In my opinion, they are as important as the Great Dao, indispensable. Fellow Daoist Mo, don't focus solely on cultivation and neglect other beautiful scenery.”</p><p>“Mo is alone, always cautious, not daring to relax for a moment. Unlike Fellow Daoist Su, protected by Senior Lu, carefree and without worries.”</p><p>The man's tone contained a hint of mockery.</p><p>Su Zinan remained unfazed, even praising him.  “This is precisely what I admire most about Fellow Daoist Mo! Mo Xingdao, from the beginning of your cultivation journey, you refused to be constrained, never joining any sect or faction. You were hunted by various sects numerous times yet remained alive. Instead, single-handedly, you slaughtered the demonic sects of the Northern Wastelands, earning everyone's awe and the revered title of the Number One Rogue Cultivator of the Northern Wastelands… What extraordinary spirit!”</p><p>Faced with the flattery, Mo Xingdao's expression remained unchanged, without a trace of complacency. He simply said, “It’s not that Mo is unwilling to be constrained, but no one has offered Mo a price worth giving up freedom.”</p><p>Hearing this, Su Zinan smiled. “Fellow Daoist Mo, rest assured, I am a man of my word. Regardless of whether you can help me find my adoptive father, as long as you assist me with all your might, I will gift you with my adoptive father’s experience of breaking through to the Divine Transformation stage. Furthermore, after his breakthrough, my adoptive father journeyed to the Central Plains and learned the secrets of ascension. If Fellow Daoist Mo is interested, I will share them with you as well. Once Fellow Daoist Mo reaches the Divine Transformation stage, you will no longer need to seek the Eight Sceneries View or the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, avoiding their manipulation.”</p><p>Mo Xingdao opened his eyes, his gaze fixed on Su Zinan, a sharp glint flashing within.  “After Divine Transformation, can one truly ascend?”</p><p>Su Zinan didn't answer directly, instead asking, “Looking across the Central Plains, how many cultivators who achieved the Divine Transformation stage in recent years have you heard of breaking through to mid-Divine Transformation and revealing their divine presence? Or how many have you heard of dying under the Heavenly Tribulation?  You must know, Divine Transformation cultivators, like us, face the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation every three hundred years.  If their cultivation doesn’t advance, they die!”</p><p>“If that's the case, why have the Divine Transformation cultivators disappeared?”</p><p>Mo Xingdao pressed.</p><p>In his view, nothing was more important than ascension.</p><p>If he were in their shoes, able to ascend, he would naturally prioritize ascension, focusing on closed cultivation and strengthening his foundation.  What could possibly be attracting these Divine Transformation cultivators, causing them all to vanish?</p><p>Su Zinan's gaze flickered. “If I knew my adoptive father's whereabouts, I wouldn’t need to make such a grand display, inviting helpers and asking Fellow Daoist Mo to emerge from seclusion.  The Eight Sceneries View and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery definitely know something. I suspect my adoptive father was implicated by them, and this trip is to personally question them!”</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent.</p><p>Ascension was a beautiful vision.</p><p>Other cultivators could only treat it as a wish, a motivation for their cultivation.  They, however, were different. They were only one Divine Transformation realm away!</p><p>It could be within reach, or it could be an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>The woman in green filled the wine cup and gently offered it to Su Zinan's lips.</p><p>Su Zinan took a sip, then his expression suddenly shifted.  He flashed out of the curtains, standing with his hands behind his back, gazing westward.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's spiritual sense was no less acute than Su Zinan's, and he rushed out almost simultaneously, looking in the same direction.</p><p>A moment later, the Nether Moon Guard at the stern finally sensed the anomaly and hurried to the bow. “Young Master, someone is undergoing tribulation in the west.”</p><p>Su Zinan turned to Mo Xingdao.  “It's the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, not particularly powerful. Is Fellow Daoist Mo interested?”</p><p>Mo Xingdao shook his head.  “This person has no grievances with Mo.”</p><p>Having spoken, he turned and returned to the curtains.</p><p>Su Zinan chuckled and followed him back. “Very well! It's too far. By the time we arrive, this person will have long vanished.”</p><p>…</p><p>Within the wasteland…</p><p>Qin Sang was completely unaware of the variables his tribulation had triggered.</p><p>Wave after wave of tribulation lightning, towards the end, the bolts became as thick as pythons, possessing world-destroying power. Even someone as strong as him had to treat them with caution, no longer daring to let the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly directly devour the lightning.</p><p>The final bolt of tribulation lightning seemed to tear open the void. The tribulation lightning power within the tribulation clouds was unleashed without reservation, the intensely concentrated lightning power forming a gigantic lightning sphere.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The ground trembled.</p><p>The Fire Lotus Seed, fused with demonic fire, had already transformed into a sea of flames in mid-air.  The instant the lightning sphere collided with the Profound Mirror Cold Gale Formation, the fire sea surged upwards, the raging demonic fire engulfing the lightning sphere.</p><p>As expected, this Heavenly Tribulation didn’t pose too great a threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stood within the deep crater created by the tribulation lightning, watching the rapidly dissipating tribulation clouds.</p><p>“The Heavenly Tribulation didn’t mutate.  Does this mean the Heavenly Dao has acknowledged me, this ‘body snatcher’?”</p><p>This thought flashed through his mind.  He summoned his avatar and immediately fled far away.</p>
