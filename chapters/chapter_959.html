<h1>Chapter 951: The Half-Open Door</h1><p>Celestial Pagoda.</p><p>Sword Path.</p><p>Completely absorbed, Qin Sang fought one against two, his sword wheel flashing against the blue-brick walls.</p><p>The swordsmen within the Sword Path were all top-tier swordsmanship experts and renowned instructors, easily able to find flaws and weaknesses in Qin Sang's technique.</p><p>Qin Sang wielded his sword with abandon, experiencing the Way of the Sword, feeling his skills improve significantly.  He realized he hadn't reached the limit of the Sword Light Splitting realm.</p><p>Perhaps this was why he hadn't grasped Sword Momentum, unable to find the path to it.</p><p>Now, as he fought the swordsmen, he also observed and learned. New ideas surfaced in his mind and he immediately incorporated them into his sword wheel.</p><p>After countless attempts...</p><p>Sometimes, the sword wheel's power surged, easily repelling the two swordsmen.</p><p>Other times, Qin Sang hit bottlenecks, trying various methods, his sword wheel flickering, even collapsing.  Fortunately, his avatar was always close by, rescuing him in time.</p><p>Despite the setbacks, Qin Sang pressed forward.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A metallic ring echoed.</p><p>The sword wheel severed a swordsman's weapon.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword tip stopped at the swordsman's throat.</p><p>The swordsman bowed in defeat and retreated into the wall.</p><p>Holding his ebony sword, Qin Sang seemed to awaken from a dream.  He realized they had reached the end, with only two guardian swordsmen remaining before clearing the Sword Path.</p><p>Shaking his head, Qin Sang exhaled, feeling his gains. His swordsmanship had reached a new level.  With further contemplation, he might be able to touch the threshold of Sword Momentum.</p><p>“Just help me hold one of them back.”</p><p>Qin Sang instructed his avatar.</p><p>Lacking treasures, the avatar couldn't defeat a swordsman of equal peak Core Formation cultivation and exceptional swordsmanship.  It could only stall one, allowing Qin Sang to defeat them individually.</p><p>Consuming several pills, Qin Sang returned to peak condition.  Exchanging a glance with his avatar, they stepped side-by-side into the final stretch of the Sword Path.</p><p>In the next moment...</p><p>Two figures emerged from the wall, each holding a sword, their faces expressionless as they looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon their appearance, Qin Sang felt a sudden pressure.  His expression turned serious; these two swordsmen were extremely powerful.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>His ebony sword moved from stillness, instantly transforming into a whirling wheel, attacking one of the swordsmen.</p><p>Simultaneously, the avatar moved as well, its true essence forming armor and a seal, slamming into the other swordsman.</p><p>The battle erupted.  The two swordsmen attempted to surround Qin Sang, but one was intercepted by the avatar, leaving Qin Sang to face only one opponent.</p><p>After a few exchanges, the avatar was forced into a defensive stance, barely holding its own.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over, then focused on his own opponent, his sword wheel shining like the moon.  The swordsman was equally impressive, his sword trembling as the light split, sword energy gathering and scattering at will, like a river flowing through the air.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. His opponent was strong, his swordsmanship at the pinnacle of this realm, almost touching the threshold of Sword Momentum.</p><p>But instead of alarm, he felt joy. This was a perfect opportunity to comprehend the sword, promising even greater gains.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword wheel crashed into the river of sword energy, creating massive waves.</p><p>The residual force struck the wall, but the blue bricks shimmered, neutralizing the impact.</p><p>Qin Sang intentionally led his opponent away from the other battle, so as not to affect his avatar.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Sword energy filled the air.</p><p>The ebony sword struggled within the river of energy. Qin Sang focused all his power on controlling it, feeling the strain. He was undoubtedly losing in the pure swordsmanship exchange, just as before.  He persevered, observing his opponent's every move with intense focus.</p><p>The passage was incredibly sturdy, remaining unmarked despite the fierce battle.</p><p>Before he knew it, Qin Sang and his opponent had somehow switched positions. After hundreds, perhaps thousands, of exchanges, Qin Sang began to falter, driven back against the wall.</p><p>His sword wheel was suppressed, flickering like a candle flame, the ebony sword barely able to maneuver.</p><p>But Qin Sang showed no sign of panic, completely absorbed in the fight.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The ebony sword was knocked back. Qin Sang's eyes darted around as if just waking up. The phoenix wings on his back suddenly glowed with azure light, and he vanished with a flicker.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sword pierced Qin Sang's afterimage, striking the wall.</p><p>The swordsman, a perfect sword cultivator, showed no reaction to the miss. He retrieved his sword, accurately located Qin Sang's true form, and pursued relentlessly, man and sword as one.</p><p>This scenario repeated several times.</p><p>Whenever Qin Sang was about to be overwhelmed, he relied on his movement technique to escape.  In this process, his understanding of the Way of the Sword deepened.</p><p>“I’ve learned enough of their swordsmanship…”</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled slowly, a smile appearing on his face. He said in a deep voice, “Thank you, seniors who created the Sword Path, for guiding my cultivation!”</p><p>As his voice fell, Qin Sang's aura changed dramatically, finally unleashing his full power. His physical body transformed into a sword wheel. In an instant, his entire being became like a sharp blade, slashing fiercely at his opponent.</p><p>The swordsman hurriedly raised his sword to block, feeling an immense force that instantly pushed him back several meters.</p><p>At the same time, three-colored escape light appeared on Qin Sang.  Instead of pursuing his opponent, he flashed above the other swordsman, his sword wheel descending.</p><p>Simultaneously, the avatar, which had been on the defensive, also erupted.  True essence surged like a dragon, crashing into the swordsman.</p><p>The swordsman was skilled, remaining composed under the combined attack. He retreated swiftly, drawing his sword, attempting to fight them both.</p><p>But against Qin Sang, his movements were still too slow.</p><p>Before his sword technique could fully form, the sword wheel arrived.  A deafening roar echoed as the swordsman's weapon was sent flying, and he was forced back by the tremendous force.</p><p>The avatar arrived!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The swordsman barely blocked the avatar's palm, his appearance disheveled.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang swung his ebony sword behind him, intercepting a sneak attack from his previous opponent. He entangled him briefly, then repeated his previous tactic.</p><p>The two swordsmen changed their sword techniques repeatedly, but they were helpless against Qin Sang's superior movement skills. Finally, he defeated them one by one.</p><p>His chest caved in.  The swordsman looked down, bowed, and transformed into azure light, merging with the wall.</p><p>The tide had turned in an instant. Qin Sang and his avatar surrounded the final swordsman, defeating him quickly.</p><p>“Finally cleared!”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, knowing that while the swordsmen's swordsmanship was exceptional, they were ultimately inanimate objects, incapable of complex strategies.</p><p>However, the battle wasn't as easy as it appeared. He examined his internal condition, finding his true essence severely depleted.  He quickly took out several spirit pills and consumed them, sitting down to meditate.</p><p>The avatar, covered in sword wounds, also consumed pills to heal.</p><p>Unsure of what dangers lay beyond the Sword Path, Qin Sang decided to recover before proceeding.</p><p>A short while later, Qin Sang and his avatar stood.</p><p>With the avatar in front and Qin Sang behind, they stepped onto the stone stairs.</p><p>The stairs led straight upwards, disappearing into darkness. Smooth and polished, they had clearly been trod by countless others.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly appeared on Qin Sang's shoulder, gazing at the top of the stairs. There, it saw a door, half-open.</p>
