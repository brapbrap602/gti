<h1>Chapter 268: Another Encounter</h1><p>At some point, the Fire Spirits had broken free from the Totem Barrier's
    confinement and entered the Lava River. For instance, near the crater, the circular barrier, previously intact along
    with the Totem Barriers, was now shattered. What had happened up there?</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked, but even more
    worried.</p><p>A horde of Fire Spirits, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, completely blocked Qin Sang's retreat.
    While unafraid of the Firebirds, he dared not charge forward against the Flaming Monkeys and spectral humanoids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the upheaval seemed to originate from the depths of the ancient immortal's mansion, making it even more
    dangerous to venture there. Perhaps not staying at the crater was a blessing in disguise.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up
    at the circular barrier above. Its light fluctuated, constantly bombarded by shockwaves. It trembled along with the
    earth and lava, yet remained solid. When it would shatter remained unknown.</p><p>Countless Fire Spirits pursued him
    relentlessly, like caged beasts finally freed, cheering and screeching, frolicking and dancing in the lava,
    seemingly a joyful scene.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew that if they saw him, their demeanor would change drastically,
    revealing murderous intent!</p><p>Unable to wait in place, he could only be pushed forward.</p><p>The lava flowed
    faster. Although the Fire Spirits seemed to be playing, their speed was not slow at all. Even with all his effort,
    Qin Sang could only maintain a slight distance.</p><p>Swallowing a Green Spirit Pill, Qin Sang checked his supply.
    He had enough pills to last for a while, so he didn't need to worry about running out of spiritual power in the
    short term. But where should he go?</p><p>If he couldn't find any breaks in the circular barrier along the way, he
    would be forced to flee all the way out of the ancient immortal's mansion, an outcome he didn't want.</p><p>Qin Sang
    pondered. Judging by the intensity of the tremors from behind, this upheaval was not trivial. If there were any weak
    points in the circular barrier, there was a high chance they would crack or even break open, providing a potential
    escape route.</p><p>The only weak point Qin Sang knew of was beneath the second trial. The trial space and the
    immortal's mansion were likely separated by a barrier. He wasn't sure if the trial space's location corresponded to
    a specific point within the mansion. If it did, it should be near the stone tablet.</p><p>He had to check it out
    regardless.</p><p>Quickly calculating his position, Qin Sang recalled his path since entering the mansion. He
    meticulously remembered every turn, mentally sketching a simple map with vertical and horizontal
    correspondences.</p><p>He was currently heading southeast, having deviated from the stone tablet's direction.</p><p>
    Qin Sang swiftly scanned the tributaries ahead, choosing one and darting into it. The Lava River had countless
    tributaries, intersecting and complex. He changed course repeatedly, finally adjusting his direction and flying
    towards the stone tablet.</p><p>Unexpectedly, while escaping, Qin Sang noticed Fire Spirits appearing from other
    directions. His greatest fear had been realized. The cavern with the Crimson Gold Vine wasn't unique. Deep within
    the mansion, there were more similar places, breeding Fire Spirits.</p><p>The circular barriers in those locations
    must have shattered, but Qin Sang dared not approach, as these Fire Spirits were not just Firebirds. All three types
    had converged.</p><p>Forced to change course, although he avoided being trapped, his room to maneuver decreased, and
    the distance between him and the Fire Spirits slowly closed.</p><p>He consumed pill after pill.</p><p>Transformed
    into a streak of sword light, Qin Sang pierced through layers of lava waves without pausing. The spiritual energy
    from the pills was consumed almost as soon as it was generated, barely keeping up with the Ebony Sword's
    consumption. His Qi Sea throbbed with pain.</p><p>If only the Nine Dragons Sky Carriage Talisman were usable. Qin
    Sang chuckled wryly and continued his flight.</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar echoed from ahead, indicating a vast
    lava lake. The thought barely formed when his vision widened, and he found himself within the lake.</p><p>This lake
    was the largest Qin Sang had seen since entering the lava, vastly bigger than the cavern, countless tributaries
    flowing into it. The surface stretched endlessly, a sea of lava.</p><p>This might not be a good thing. With no cover
    and a wide-open view, flying with his sword would easily attract the Fire Spirits' attention.</p><p>Sure enough,
    shortly after entering the lava lake, Qin Sang saw Fire Spirits appearing amidst the rising and falling waves on the
    distant shore.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was approaching the center of the lake, a deafening roar pierced the air.</p>
<p>Startled, he turned to see a dazzling white streak of light shoot out from a river of lava. A horde of enraged Fire
    Spirits followed close behind, swarming out of the lava river's mouth in seemingly endless numbers. Countless Fire
    Spirits shrieked as they plunged into the lava lake, throwing it into chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed inwardly at the
    sight.</p><p>He had no time to ponder why someone else was here. Without hesitation, he urged his Ebony Sword to
    full speed and fled. In his haste, he glanced at the distant streak of light, then abruptly paused, subconsciously
    slowing down.</p><p>The white light was incredibly fast, easily outpacing the furious Fire Spirits. Soon, it drew
    level with Qin Sang.</p><p>Only then did the person piloting the light notice Qin Sang, who had been trying to
    escape discreetly.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>A surprised voice echoed from the light, which then faltered and dissipated,
    revealing an elderly figure.</p><p>It was Wandering Scholar, the pilot of the Spirit Bamboo flying boat!</p><p>
    "Brother Qin?"</p><p>Both men stared at each other in astonishment.</p><p>"Senior, what are you doing here?"</p><p>
    Qin Sang asked first.</p><p>He'd felt a familiar fluctuation from the light, much like Wandering Scholar's Spirit
    Bamboo boat. Only the Spirit Bamboo boat could achieve such speed. An extra ally in this situation meant a greater
    chance of survival, so Qin Sang had slowed down to wait.</p><p>It really was Wandering Scholar!</p><p>"I discovered
    a rare spiritual herb underground and was about to harvest it when the earth suddenly split open, the circular
    barrier shattered, and I fell into the lava river. Before I could escape, I was beset by the Fire Spirits and had no
    choice but to flee..."</p><p>Wandering Scholar's explanation was cut short by a wave of shrieks.</p><p>The Fire
    Spirits were closing in fast. His face paled slightly, and he urged, "Brother Qin, quickly board the boat! Don't let
    these beasts surround us!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He pondered briefly, then nodded, withdrawing his sword
    and leaping onto the Spirit Bamboo boat.</p><p>"It seems both times we've met, Brother Qin, it's been under these
    circumstances," Wandering Scholar remarked with a hint of amusement. "I've used up all my spirit pills and nearly
    exhausted my spiritual energy. It's wonderful to see you! We can take turns piloting the boat and avoid being caught
    by those beasts."</p>
