<h1>Chapter 1452: Threats from All Sides</h1><p>A streak of crimson-gold light appeared in the eastern sky, speeding towards them.  Another expert from Xuan Tian Palace was arriving.  Shi Xue, having fled westward, arrived a step behind Chen Yan.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't focused on him. This individual wasn't enough to warrant Qin Sang's vigilance.  Qin Sang was wary of two figures that had silently appeared over the northern sea. The water there was open; the battle's impact caused waves, though the aftershocks were weaker than at the epicenter where massive waves and large chunks of glacial ice floated.</p><p>Even Elder Mei Lan hadn't noticed the two.</p><p>"Hun Mo Lao Ren!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. The Demonfire Armor on his body went completely dormant to avoid revealing his presence.  Upon detecting the ambush and deciding to act, he had rapidly assessed the situation and possible consequences in his mind.</p><p>This location was far from Hun Mo Island, and Qin Sang's maze formation was just ahead. Hun Mo Lao Ren, unlike Xuan Tian Palace, couldn't preemptively track Qin Sang's movements. Even if alerted at the start of the battle, it would still take time for him to arrive from Hun Mo Island.</p><p>Seeing Shi Xue's unexpected life-saving measures and the timely arrival of Elders Mei and Lan, Qin Sang didn't flee or propose a trade, but instead focused on capturing Shi Xue for two reasons:</p><p>First, no one from Xuan Tian Palace posed a threat; their Palace Master was absent. Qin Sang could easily evade them without even needing the maze formation.</p><p>Second, time was still within his acceptable limits.</p><p>Of course, this decision was made based on the changing situation, considering various unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>The unexpected did arrive, sooner than anticipated. Fortunately, Qin Sang hadn't let his guard down.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected Hun Mo Lao Ren had been drawn by Xuan Tian Palace, muttering about how those fools, after suffering so many casualties at the Huang Long Shi Palace, still hadn't learned caution.  While his reasoning was flawed, his conclusion coincidentally matched reality.</p><p>"We can't stay here!"</p><p>Qin Sang made an immediate decision. Regardless of Hun Mo Lao Ren's motives, he needed to leave immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang knew Hun Mo Lao Ren had a feud with Xuan Tian Palace, but he wasn't naive enough to exploit it, hoping to profit from their conflict. Even if Hun Mo Lao Ren didn't recognize him as the one who took the treasure from the Buddha Temple, once he guessed Qin Sang possessed an item Xuan Tian Palace coveted, his first action would be to seize the treasure before fighting Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>This was Hun Mo Lao Ren's territory; he had the advantage.  Qin Sang would do the same in his place.</p><p>If he stayed, Qin Sang would face both Xuan Tian Palace and Hun Mo Lao Ren, along with any other Yuan Ying cultivators drawn to the area. Even with backup, his situation would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>His only choice was to reconcile with Xuan Tian Palace and agree to return the sacred object. Such a forced trade was clearly disadvantageous.</p><p>In an instant, numerous thoughts raced through his mind. Qin Sang abandoned his plan to capture Shi Xue, as she would become a liability.</p><p>He couldn't be sure when Hun Mo Lao Ren arrived or how long he'd been observing. Hun Mo Lao Ren must have seen the Jin Chen Sword when he was at Jing Hai Sect.  Before the trading event, while on Mingzhu Island, Qin Sang had bought materials from Dan Ding Mountain to modify the Jin Chen Sword. But like Tan Hao's Demon-subduing Pestle, he couldn't fundamentally change its nature, leaving it vulnerable to being recognized by Hun Mo Lao Ren.</p><p>He had to leave immediately.  This wouldn't be a loss; his original plan was only to confirm Xuan Tian Palace's ability to sense the mysterious ice box.  The attempt to capture Shi Xue was an opportunistic move when he found her alone.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his hand from the corpse puppet pouch, and as a cover, took out some pills from his Qian Jun ring, swallowed them to restore some true essence, and performed a sword technique.</p><p>‘嗡!’</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword's light blazed, its aura fluctuating.  Between Qin Sang and Chen Yan, the seemingly calm void suddenly darkened, with countless sword threads appearing. However, these threads were stiff, unlike before, seemingly frozen by extreme cold.</p><p>Simultaneously, white mist erupted there, signifying the ice spirit light's outburst, blocked by the sword array.</p><p>Qin Sang still vividly recalled the previous danger, taking Chen Yan's strange ability very seriously, so he restarted the sword array without hesitation.</p><p>*Crack crack crack…*</p><p>Countless tiny icicles shattered against the sword array, the icy radiance sliced apart.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, the resistance against his Golden Sink Sword wasn't as great as he'd anticipated.</p><p>"All show?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Chen Yan in astonishment.  The azure light in her eyes was no longer clear; it was diffused, even showing signs of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang knew very well that even if Chen Yan recognized him, she wouldn't go easy on him under these circumstances. Firstly, she was desperate to save the woman in green, clearly someone close to her. Secondly, this divine ability was unleashed *before* Chen Yan recognized him.</p><p>The only explanation was that she couldn't continuously use this ability.  Forcing it resulted in significantly reduced power compared to the first time.</p><p>"Junior Sister, retreat!"</p><p>Shi Xue also noticed Chen Yan's strange state, her face filled with anxiety, unwilling to let her junior sister be implicated.</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Chen Yan, activated the sword array, and swept the remaining force back towards her.</p><p>At the same time,</p><p>Qin Sang felt a stinging pain in his back, a prickling sensation. His spiritual sense detected a greyish-white bone needle, silently aimed at him.</p><p>Simultaneously, the round moon formed from the Day-Encircling Ring transformed from dim to bright, increasingly dazzling, its light pulsing.</p><p>Elder Mei and Elder Lan finally recovered.</p><p>They didn't have time to adjust and use other methods. Seeing the urgency of the situation, they used the bone needles and Day-Encircling Ring they had already deployed to restrain Qin Sang and force him back.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't turn his head.  His phoenix wings beat rapidly behind him, transforming him into a streak of lightning as he surged forward.</p><p>The bone needles flew towards him, but Qin Sang had chosen his direction cleverly. This maneuver placed Chen Yan between him and the needles.</p><p>Chen Yan was surrounded by the storm created by the residual energy, temporarily unable to react.</p><p>Seeing this, Elder Mei's expression changed slightly, his hand suddenly clenching.</p><p>The bone needles hesitated, their tips wavering, circumventing Chen Yan, thus missing their optimal moment.</p><p>But the attack on Qin Sang wasn't over.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Day-Encircling Ring shone brightly.</p><p>A pillar of light descended from the heavens, several times thicker than before.</p><p>This time, Elder Lan had learned his lesson. He dispersed the Day-Encircling Ring's power, not targeting Qin Sang directly, but instead encasing him in a cage of frozen seawater.</p><p>On the surface of the sea,</p><p>ice walls grew at a visible speed.  Faint runes circulated within them, clearly not ordinary ice.</p><p>Although hastily formed and not yet complete, breaking through these walls would require Qin Sang to use other means, inevitably affecting him.</p><p>Restricting him for even a moment would be enough for the others to recover.</p>
