<h1>Chapter 456: Star Essence Stone</h1><p>After Ji Wu arrived, two more streaks of light descended one after another.</p><p>At this point, including Qin Sang, there were thirty-three people on Stargazer Island, encompassing all the top Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Chaotic Archipelago.</p><p>These individuals mostly hailed from various sects within the Small Cold Territory. The remaining few rogue cultivators also had some connection to the Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>They were all human cultivators, with no demon cultivators from the Demonic Mound.</p><p>No demon cultivators were seen during the three-year standoff either.</p><p>The most commonly seen were spirit beasts tamed by cultivators, mostly disciples of the Spirit驭宗 sect.  One such disciple, surnamed Mu, called Zhige, was present.  His spirit beast was a golden eagle, said to be a descendant of a Demonic Mound Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the power dynamics and negotiations between the various factions within the Small Cold Territory.</p><p>When the last person arrived, the stone doors of the hall suddenly opened on their own.</p><p>Everyone stopped chatting, exchanged glances, and silently walked in together.</p><p>The floor was paved with gold bricks, and bright pearls shone brilliantly.</p><p>Inside the resplendent golden hall, there were only a few imposing dragon pillars; besides that, there were no other furnishings.</p><p>Two people stood in the golden hall.</p><p>It was unexpectedly Serpent Witch and Vice-Island Master Xiao!</p><p>Such a scene was uncommon.</p><p>After recognizing the identities of the two Island Masters, everyone was not only secretly surprised but also showed respectful expressions on their faces, and their behavior became more cautious.</p><p>“Greetings, Island Masters!”</p><p>Serpent Witch walked over, leaning on her snake staff.  Her face was aged, and a pair of triangular eyes emitted a somewhat cold gaze, similar to the snake-bodied man.</p><p>Feeling Serpent Witch's gaze sweep over him, although knowing she bore him no ill will and wouldn't consider a small fry like him important, Qin Sang still felt a tightness in his chest.</p><p>“You are all outstanding individuals who have emerged from this war, each with distinguished battle achievements…”</p><p>For the first time ever, they heard praise from the mouth of a Golden Core cultivator, and it was from the Stargazer Island Master.</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>Some secretly rejoiced, guessing whether they would be rewarded.</p><p>Serpent Witch spoke slowly, but everyone listened patiently, and no one showed any impatience.</p><p>“…There’s something I need you to do.”</p><p>Serpent Witch's tone carried an unquestionable meaning.  Pausing slightly at this point, she looked deeply at Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>“Please instruct us, Island Master!”</p><p>Qin Sang and the others unhesitatingly bowed and accepted the order.</p><p>There were no rewards, only a new mission.</p><p>While disappointed, everyone couldn't help but feel apprehensive. With the two Island Masters personally present, summoning all renowned experts, this mission was definitely not simple, and there might be great danger.</p><p>But their movements were swift and uniform.  Years of war had already accustomed them to obeying orders.</p><p>Especially orders issued personally by Serpent Witch and Vice-Island Master Xiao, who would dare to object?</p><p>Seeing this, Serpent Witch nodded with satisfaction.</p><p>Mu Zhige of the Spirit驭宗 sect was bold. “May I ask, Island Master, is it only us? Or everyone in our squads…?”</p><p>“Only you.”</p><p>Serpent Witch glanced over them, seemingly seeing through their thoughts, and let out a chuckle with an ambiguous meaning. "This trip indeed carries some danger. However, for some of you, it might be an opportunity.”</p><p>Hearing these words, everyone's eyes brightened, and they looked at Serpent Witch with anticipation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Serpent Witch's tone changed.  She said, “Many of you should know about Skyreach Peak. It's located beneath the beam of light from last night's battle, sealed by a restriction. Once the restriction opens, I need you to enter and collect a rare item called the Star Essence Stone.”</p><p>“Star Essence Stone!”</p><p>Before Serpent Witch finished speaking, someone suddenly exclaimed, disregarding their status, and eagerly asked, “Senior, are you referring to the rare Star Essence Stone, born from the power of stars, capable of channeling the power of the celestial stars, and rarely seen in the world?”</p><p>Everyone followed the voice, and saw that the speaker was a disciple of the Yuan Mirage Sect, who called himself Nine Formations Master.</p><p>These people knew each other to some extent.  Nine Formations Master was aloof and arrogant, and even on the battlefield, he had never been seen so agitated.</p><p>Nine Formations Master’s face was full of shock, as if the Star Essence Stone was something extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang searched his memories, certain he had never heard of the Star Essence Stone.</p><p>Serpent Witch frowned and gave Nine Formations Master a cold look.  “Is there a second kind of Star Essence Stone in this world?”</p><p>“Please forgive me, Island Master, I lost my composure.”</p><p>Nine Formations Master hurriedly apologized, looked around, and cleverly explained for Serpent Witch.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists who haven't delved into the art of spirit formations may not understand the Star Essence Stone.</p><p>“There exists a type of spirit formation that can channel the power of the celestial stars, possessing immense power.  The Star Essence Stone is essential for setting up such formations.</p><p>“Nowadays, these types of spirit formations have almost vanished, impossible to construct, precisely due to the lack of Star Essence Stones.</p><p>“In ancient times, there were legends of powerful figures plucking stars and seizing the moon.  In these legends, there are records of methods to cultivate Star Essence Stones, but unfortunately, such methods have long been lost.</p><p>“This humble one also learned about the legend of the Star Essence Stone from my master, and initially thought it was false. I never expected that the Star Essence Stone hadn't disappeared, and that there are some within Skyreach Peak.  I was momentarily shocked, hence my outburst…”</p><p>A rare item for formations?</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he couldn't help but feel surprised.</p><p>He had assumed that there were some heavenly treasures or miraculous pills inside Skyreach Peak.</p><p>The Celestial Alliance and the Small Cold Territory went to such lengths, even attracting the intervention of Nascent Soul cultivators, all for the Star Essence Stone.  He wondered what grand formation both sides were planning to construct.</p><p>“Indeed worthy of being a disciple of the Yuan Mirage Sect, even knowing the secrets of the Star Essence Stone so clearly… Does your Yuan Mirage Sect possess many such ancient formations?”</p><p>Serpent Witch narrowed her eyes and glanced at Nine Formations Master.</p><p>Nine Formations Master's heart trembled, and he hurriedly bowed.  “Island Master, please forgive me. This disciple's cultivation is low, and I am not qualified to access the sect's secrets. I do not know if there are any ancient formations within the sect.”</p><p>Serpent Witch snorted coldly and spared Nine Formations Master, not pursuing the matter further.</p><p>Nine Formations Master secretly breathed a sigh of relief, only realizing then that his back was soaked with cold sweat.</p><p>“These artifacts are called Spirit Locking Bracelets. Take them.”</p><p>Serpent Witch took out a handful of silver bracelets and tossed them to Qin Sang and the others.  “These Spirit Locking Bracelets are extremely difficult to refine. You will need them to obtain the Star Essence Stones. Remember not to damage them, otherwise, you'll return empty-handed.”</p><p>Qin Sang caught a Spirit Locking Bracelet and examined it closely.</p><p>It was an artifact that couldn't be measured by standard ranks. These types of artifacts had unique uses, not for combat, and the Spirit Locking Bracelet was no exception.</p><p>The Spirit Locking Bracelet appeared as a slender silver bracelet, inlaid with a small crystal. Qin Sang scrutinized it for a while, but couldn't discern its material.</p><p>The crystal was pure and flawless, shining with a clear light, like a star descending from the heavens.</p><p>It seemed like the Spirit Locking Bracelet was just a pleasing decorative item.</p><p>It made one worry that it would break with just a little force.</p><p>After carefully listening to Serpent Witch explain how to use the Spirit Locking Bracelet, Qin Sang carefully stored it in his storage pouch.  However, he was thinking about the reward that Serpent Witch had mentioned earlier.</p>
