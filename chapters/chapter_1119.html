<h1>Chapter 1111: The Crimson Dress</h1><p>The voice was all too familiar!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred as he focused his gaze.</p><p>The spirit array activated, and the mist parted to either side, revealing a woman in red stepping through the fog.</p><p>Her brows arched like distant peaks, her eyes dark and profound.</p><p>The woman wore a phoenix crown, her beauty otherworldly, almost ethereal.</p><p>Clad in a long crimson dress, she exuded an aura of unparalleled elegance and grace.</p><p>Her gaze fell upon Qin Sang, and a flicker of surprise passed through her eyes.</p><p>"Granny Jing?"</p><p>Qin Sang was equally astonished.</p><p>Granny Jing, the daughter of Elder Qingzhu, her true name Qing Jun.</p><p>When they first met in the market, she had concealed her cultivation, adopting the guise of an elderly woman named Granny Jing.</p><p>It wasn't until before entering Zhitian Peak that Qin Sang discovered Granny Jing's true identity. Qing Jun's real appearance was breathtakingly beautiful, rivaling even Chen Yan.</p><p>But now, seeing Qing Jun again, she had changed once more.</p><p>He still remembered the past, when Qing Jun revealed her true form, dressed in white, untouched by the mortal world, like a fairy from the moon palace, ethereal and transcendent.</p><p>Now, her appearance remained as stunning as it had been a century ago, with no trace of time's passage on her face. Yet, the impression she gave Qin Sang was entirely different.</p><p>Her fiery red dress blazed like the morning sun, striking and intense.</p><p>This woman's aura was ever-changing, leaving Qin Sang somewhat bewildered, unsure which version of her was the real one.</p><p>"How intriguing! Back then, I had intended to ask you if you had found that person's remains, only to discover you had vanished without a trace. Later, I learned you had angered Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan in the Purple Micro Palace. As I recall, you weren't even at the Golden Core stage back then, merely at the False Core realm. Yet you managed to escape, disappearing for years, only to reappear with such cultivation?"</p><p>Qin Sang's lips curled slightly as he looked Qing Jun up and down, his expression one of interest.</p><p>His instincts had been correct—this woman had indeed changed. Her demeanor and aura were completely different from what he remembered.</p><p>Qin Sang silently cursed in his heart.</p><p>Confirming that this woman was indeed Qing Jun, Qin Sang suppressed his thoughts and clasped his hands in a respectful bow. "It has been many years, Senior. Your grace remains undiminished. This junior has come uninvited, disturbing your seclusion. I hope you will not take offense."</p><p>Qin Sang knew Qing Jun was the daughter of Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>Since Peach Blossom Valley was her homeland, it wasn't surprising to encounter her here.</p><p>However, from the tone of her words back then, it seemed she held little affection for Elder Qingzhu. Moreover, Peach Blossom Valley was no paradise, so Qin Sang hadn't expected to reunite with Granny Jing so soon.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang the most was that Qing Jun's aura was so obscure that he couldn't discern her true cultivation level.</p><p>There was only one possibility—Qin Jun had already broken through to the Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>But then again, Qin Sang thought, it wasn't entirely unexpected.</p><p>They had been apart for over a century. A hundred years ago, Qing Jun had dared to infiltrate Shaohua Mountain, plotting to assassinate Leng Yuntian.</p><p>"I've never mentioned Peach Blossom Valley to anyone. How did you know I was here? You must have come with another purpose in mind."</p><p>Qin Jun saw through Qin Sang's intentions at a glance. "Come inside and speak."</p><p>Qin Jun turned and walked into the spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude and quickly followed.</p><p>Passing through the spirit array, the valley was indeed a sea of blossoms, painting the hills in vibrant hues.</p><p>The peach trees had been meticulously pruned, some in full bloom, others laden with crimson immortal peaches, their fragrance intoxicating.</p><p>A babbling brook meandered through the peach grove, eventually converging into a clear pond.</p><p>There were no grand pavilions here, only a delicate courtyard with a few wooden cottages nestled beside the pond, surrounded by the peach trees, blending seamlessly with the landscape.</p><p>The words Elder Qingzhu had left on the cliff were merely a depiction of the most profound memories etched in his heart.</p><p>As Qin Sang's thoughts wandered, he was about to speak when he suddenly felt an overwhelming surge of pure spiritual energy, far denser than even the abodes of Yun Youzi and Li Yufu.</p><p>Wasn't Peach Blossom Valley supposed to have only a minor spirit vein?</p><p>"I moved a spirit vein from the Yuan Shen Sect here. It's quite useful."</p><p>Qin Jun, noticing Qin Sang's astonishment, spoke nonchalantly.</p><p>"The Yuan Shen Sect? Leng Yuntian, could it be…"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang gasped, his face filled with shock.</p><p>While at Yin Mountain Pass, he had deliberately sought information about the Yuan Shen Sect. He learned that the sect remained among the top-tier sects, showing no signs of decline, and that Leng Yuntian was still alive.</p><p>He had assumed that Qin Jun had failed to kill Leng Yuntian in the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>But upon hearing that Qin Jun had managed to relocate a spirit vein from the Yuan Shen Sect, a flash of realization struck Qin Sang, leaving him almost incredulous.</p><p>The Qingzhu family and the Yuan Shen Sect were sworn enemies. Qin Jun would never compromise with Leng Yuntian.</p><p>There was only one possibility…</p><p>"Indeed, Leng Yuntian's Five Directions Pagoda was tainted by the Blood Filth Divine Light, and I killed him in the Purple Micro Palace. The Yuan Shen Sect's vast foundation couldn't simply be disbanded or handed over to others, so I disguised myself as Leng Yuntian and took over as sect master. The disciples of the Yuan Shen Sect couldn't see through my true form, though the Red-Haired Ancestor and others did notice something amiss. However, at the time, the war was raging, and I actively joined the battlefield, fighting with all my might. Moreover, the situation was already settled. I didn't slaughter innocents within the Yuan Shen Sect, and Dongyang Bo and the others knew of our enmity. After a few warnings, they tacitly accepted it…"</p><p>Qin Jun recounted the events with a casual tone.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the reality couldn't be as simple as Qin Jun made it sound.</p><p>With Leng Yuntian dead, the vast foundation of the Yuan Shen Sect had been usurped.</p><p>How could the Nascent Soul ancestors of the various sects not feel a sense of impending doom upon seeing this?</p><p>No matter the reasons, they would never allow someone to act so recklessly.</p><p>Unless… that person's strength had reached a level where everyone had no choice but to compromise!</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly observed Qin Jun.</p><p>Perhaps it was just his imagination, but he faintly sensed that Qin Jun's aura seemed even more obscure than the early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators he had encountered in the Seven Slaughter Palace.</p><p>The thought startled Qin Sang.</p><p>A hundred years ago, Qin Jun had needed elaborate schemes and his assistance to deal with Leng Yuntian, who had barely reached the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Could it be that in just over a century, she had broken through multiple times, reaching the mid-stage Nascent Soul realm?</p><p>That would be truly astonishing.</p><p>Even for someone with a heavenly spiritual root, such rapid advancement would be nearly impossible.</p><p>Or was there some hidden truth from the past?</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Qin Jun gave him a contradictory impression.</p><p>Back then, she had disguised herself as an old woman, hiding in the Moon Inquiry Market. Yet she had dared to infiltrate Shaohua Mountain, approaching Dongyang Bo's abode without fear of being discovered.</p><p>Her cultivation had always been enigmatic, fluctuating between high and low, making her impossible to pin down.</p><p>As Qin Sang's thoughts raced, the two of them passed through the peach grove and arrived beside the wooden cottages.</p><p>"Speak. What brings you here?"</p><p>Qin Jun suddenly stopped and looked at Qin Sang, her gaze piercing.</p><p>Behind the cottages, Qin Sang noticed two graves, their tombstones inscribed with the names of two women, the characters elegant and delicate.</p><p>Indeed, both beauties had long since passed away.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the identities of those buried here and sighed inwardly.</p><p>May Elder Qingzhu reunite with them in the afterlife!</p><p>Qin Sang set aside his wandering thoughts and silently offered his blessings. Taking a deep breath, he spoke solemnly, "This junior has come at the behest of Elder Qingzhu, to bring his remains back and bury them in Peach Blossom Valley."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang flicked his finger, and a flash of light revealed an ice coffin containing Elder Qingzhu's remains.</p><p>Qin Jun seemed to have anticipated this. She stared at the ice coffin, her eyes filled with complex emotions.</p>
