<h1>Chapter 601: The Reason</h1><p>Wandering Scholar saw Qin Sang's worry and confusion. He flew forward, approaching the Southern Bright Nether Fire, looked around, and suddenly flicked his fingers, sending countless strands of spiritual power into the walls of the hidden passage.</p><p>The next moment, a faint cyan light suddenly lit up within the passage.</p><p>Countless intricate runes inexplicably appeared on the walls of the passage. As Wandering Scholar moved, the runes activated, the cyan light grew brighter, and the outline of a spirit array gradually revealed itself.</p><p>The cyan light couldn't compare to the Southern Bright Nether Fire, but it held its own.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that this spirit array was completely different from the remnants and immortal restrictions he had encountered before. It didn't seem like something that originally belonged to the Violet Firmament Palace.</p><p>However, although it wasn't as complex and mysterious as the immortal arrays outside, it was still incredibly intricate and self-contained, something not just anyone could set up.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand it. Even glancing at it made him feel dizzy.</p><p>The cyan light shone brightly.</p><p>The next moment, a small, fiery-red bird flew out from within, chirping as it circled Wandering Scholar before landing obediently on his arm, lowering its head to preen its feathers.</p><p>The little bird seemed lifelike.</p><p>However, a sweep of divine sense revealed the truth. This little bird wasn't a living creature but a puppet woven from some kind of spiritual wood. It was exceptionally delicate, a true masterpiece!</p><p>The bird was entirely fiery red, its feathers as if ablaze, but this wasn't due to the original material. The aura emanating from it was identical to that of the Southern Bright Nether Fire.</p><p>Its skeleton and feathers were made of red strips and some kind of slender leaves, respectively, which had been cut and shaped. Now, with the help of the spirit array, they had absorbed the Southern Bright Nether Fire, undergoing a transformation that made their original materials unrecognizable.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had seen many cultivators who mastered puppetry, but such an exquisite puppet, so close to lifelike, he had only seen one other: the Azure Phoenix crafted by Granny Jing.</p><p>Who placed this little bird here? Was it always there?</p><p>Qin Sang marveled inwardly.</p><p>Wandering Scholar, holding the little bird in his palm, said with satisfaction, "Years ago, someone buried this object here, allowing it to absorb the power of the Southern Bright Nether Fire. After years of nurturing, it has finally assimilated part of the Southern Bright Nether Fire's essence. With the help of the spirit array and this spirit puppet, a passage can be opened through the flames. Passing through the Southern Bright Nether Fire isn't difficult; the challenge lies in retrieving the cauldron fragment. Among those I can call upon, only Brother Qin is capable of this."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked away from the bird puppet, curiously at Wandering Scholar. What obstacles lay ahead? Why was Wandering Scholar so certain he could help retrieve the cauldron fragment?</p><p>Wandering Scholar extended a finger, soothing the bird puppet, and pointed forward.</p><p>"Not far ahead, the hidden passage is severed by a sword scar. Originally, one could enter and exit from there, but the sword energy within the scar hasn't dissipated, and no one dares to venture through.</p><p>"The one who wielded the sword likely cultivated an ice-cold Dao technique. The residual sword energy is a type of Profound Ice Sword Energy.</p><p>"The sword energy is concentrated and hasn't dispersed. It stirs the spiritual energy here, forming an extremely cold, malicious wind that rages around the sword scar year-round. It's only because of the illusion array outside that it's not visible.</p><p>"What's more terrifying is that within this malicious wind, there are remnants of the Profound Ice Sword Intent from the sword scar. This sword intent has now transformed into an extreme and bizarre coldness. This combination… does it sound familiar to you, Brother Qin?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Hearing Wandering Scholar describe these characteristics, Qin Sang immediately recalled the Profound Frost Malicious Wind he encountered in the Cliffless Valley.</p><p>The Profound Frost Malicious Wind was naturally formed, while the malicious wind here was born from the influence of sword energy. Their origins were different, but they sounded remarkably similar.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Wandering Scholar seemed to be hinting at something. His expression shifted slightly. How did Wandering Scholar know he had encountered the Profound Frost Malicious Wind?</p><p>"Senior, that day… you still had the strength to sense the outside?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>Back then, in the Cliffless Valley, while gathering Nightfall Lilies, Wandering Scholar had used the Green Lamp and the Flawless Pearl to resist the Profound Frost Malicious Wind, almost reaching his limit. Qin Sang had even considered helping him.</p><p>He still had the strength to sense him!</p><p>Wandering Scholar nodded slightly, then shook his head, saying, "This old one was indeed at my limit then, but my spiritual perception is keen. I vaguely sensed another person's aura passing by. For someone to appear in such a place, neither harming me nor stealing the Nightfall Lilies, after much thought, it could only be you, Brother."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Wandering Scholar's words greatly surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>No wonder, outside the Violet Firmament Palace, Wandering Scholar first asked his opinion about whether the黑衣人 (black-clothed person) was the Sect Master of the Wuji Sect.</p><p>Because he knew that Qin Sang had reached the end of the ice cave and witnessed the battle, possibly seeing their true faces!</p><p>Although Wandering Scholar hadn't personally witnessed the battle, he could guess. The Cliffless Valley was rarely visited, and so many Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't normally appear there at the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>Since Wandering Scholar already knew of Yi Tiannie's existence, Qin Sang briefly recounted his encounter with Yu Hua in the ice cave.</p><p>"Senior, I had no intention of entering. I was forced by a powerful enemy, with nowhere else to go. In the ice cave, I initially intended to help you, but then you single-handedly…"</p><p>Wandering Scholar waved his hand, sincerely saying, "This old one is not ungrateful. I know your intentions. That was a trial, like a chick breaking out of its shell. If it were me, I wouldn't rashly intervene either. Moreover, my obtaining the Nightfall Lilies was thanks to your efforts. Do you remember the final tremor in the ice cave? You were standing in front of me then, and you happened to block a strand of Profound Frost Malicious Wind for me, which allowed me to seize the opportunity and rush through…"</p><p>Wandering Scholar cupped his hands towards Qin Sang, saying, "Brother, you must have a secret method to resist the coldness of the Profound Frost Malicious Wind, right? Your cultivation is far greater now, so the power of your secret method should be even stronger. I entrust you with retrieving the cauldron fragment from within the sword energy and malicious wind."</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He was most afraid of the Jade Buddha being exposed.</p><p>The Jade Buddha was his most important secret, the foundation of his survival in the cultivation world.  He couldn't reveal it to anyone, no matter how close.</p><p>Fortunately, Wandering Scholar, misled by the Profound Frost Malicious Wind, had guessed in the wrong direction, thinking Qin Sang merely possessed a secret method or treasure that could resist the cold. With Wandering Scholar's vast knowledge, he probably couldn't imagine the existence of a wondrous object like the Jade Buddha.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang agreed, "If the sword energy and malicious wind aren't much stronger than the Profound Frost Malicious Wind, I should be able to withstand it. Senior, please part the flames and let me try."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed to enter after careful consideration.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha's abilities, even if something went wrong with the bird puppet and the Southern Bright Nether Fire blocked his path, he could still withstand the sword energy and malicious wind and leave from the other end, without fear of being trapped inside.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep look at Wandering Scholar. This was also a test.</p><p>He believed in Wandering Scholar's character, but treasures could sway hearts.</p><p>He only hoped that old friends wouldn't change!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang agree, Wandering Scholar said with a solemn expression, "I'll control the spirit array and the spirit puppet with all my might. I can maintain it for ten breaths. Within ten breaths, whether you succeed or not, you must come out!"</p>
