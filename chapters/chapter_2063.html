<h1>Chapter 2054: Closing the Net</h1><p>Having learned about the abilities of the Siyou clan, the arrangement of these unusual people became clear.</p><p>Because the Siyou clansmen and their companion beasts are telepathically linked, and the beast can be dispelled at any time, capturing the beast beforehand is impossible; it would only alert them.  Action must be taken only when the clansmen themselves use their inter-transformation technique.</p><p>Therefore, they must split their forces. Some will remain here, while others will pressure the two Siyou clansmen. Of course, if the Siyou clansmen are unwilling to use the inter-transformation technique and choose to stand their ground, they will happily oblige.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu exchanged a glance. The separation of these powerful individuals was undoubtedly advantageous to them.</p><p>However, due to the urgency of the situation, Su Nu couldn't utilize many of her preparations.  The approach and timing required careful consideration.</p><p>Qin Sang mouthed a few words, transmitting his thoughts.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes flickered.  "Brother Qin means we should stay here, wait for the two Siyou clansmen to use the inter-transformation technique, and then seize them?  But what if the Siyou clansmen are prepared, don't choose to transform, attempt to break out from another location, or are defeated before they can use the technique?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "It's a difficult situation.  With only the two of us, our strength is limited. If we split up, we might fail on both fronts. It's better to focus on one. The cautious actions of the Quanfeng clan show that the two Siyou clansmen are quite powerful and won't be easily defeated. If they escape again, we'll just continue to monitor the Quanfeng clan's movements. There will be other opportunities."</p><p>There was another consideration. By acting together, they could support each other in case of danger.  Saving the Siyou clansmen was only to obtain a guide; endangering themselves for that would be counterproductive.</p><p>Su Nu understood his reasoning and nodded. "I agree with Brother Qin."</p><p>With that, she cast a few more spells on Jizhou before vanishing with Qin Sang.</p><p>Shortly after they left, Jizhou awoke from his trance, his dull gaze gradually regaining clarity as the spell's effects wore off.</p><p>However, he had no memory of the intervening period, as if it had been erased from his mind. He only remembered bidding farewell to his two clansmen and arriving here without incident.</p><p>His purpose wasn't to refine any protective treasure, but to obtain a special type of crystal.</p><p>Shortly after arriving, he discovered this crystal, which was extremely beneficial to Quanfeng clan cultivation. Fearing other clansmen would covet it and demand a share, he decided to wait. Fortunately, the crystals were hidden beneath the reefs, concealed by spiritual veins, making them very difficult to find, allowing him to retrieve them later.</p><p>As he learned more over time, Jizhou realized a major battle might be imminent and that it could destroy the place.  He therefore found an excuse to leave.</p><p>He bent down, his ears twitching slightly, then dove into the sea, descending along the reefs until he found a natural cave. Entering, he saw numerous bright lights – crystals the size of dragon's eyes, like night pearls, embedded in the cave walls, readily available.</p><p>Jizhou was careful. Mining the crystals would disturb the earth's energy, and any leaked energy could be detected by outsiders. His ears twitched again, and concentric gray ripples emanated from his ears, falling upon a crystal. Moments later, the crystal flashed and fell, silently caught by Jizhou.</p><p>He repeated the process, collecting the crystals one by one, his heart filled with joy. He continued until he'd collected them all, then used magic to search, finding no more crystals deep within the earth's energy, only here within the cave.</p><p>However, he didn't immediately return. Since he'd used the excuse of refining a treasure, he needed to keep up appearances.</p><p>He did indeed possess a treasure of this type, operated by three people, though its power was mediocre – good enough to deceive them.</p><p>After waiting for a while, judging the time right, Jizhou left the reef and returned to his original location.</p><p>Seeing him return, the two Quanfeng clansmen relaxed.  "Is the treasure refined?" they asked.</p><p>Jizhou nodded, his expression normal, producing a black disc. "I'll watch here; you two take turns refining the treasure."</p><p>The two rejoiced, immediately taking the disc.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Jizhou, two pairs of eyes were watching his every move.  Even the crystals were planted there.</p><p>As the seed was activated, Jizhou returned to normal. He felt nothing amiss, and even a Quanfeng powerhouse wouldn't detect anything unusual upon examination.</p><p>Seeing no abnormalities, Qin Sang and Su Nu ignored him and attempted to sense the location of the Quanfeng powerhouses.  After patiently waiting on the periphery for a long time, they didn't detect any cultivators of the Transcendent Void level, which was clearly abnormal.</p><p>Driven by necessity, Qin Sang awakened Tianmu Butterfly, finally uncovering the layout of the 犬封族's large formation.</p><p>After discussing, the two confirmed it wasn't an exceptionally powerful trapping formation.  Such a complex spiritual array would be difficult to completely conceal, easily alerting the two Siyou clan members.</p><p>Their formation was likely meant only to obscure the spiritual energy here, masking it from the Haitang Academy's detection methods.  As long as their fight wasn't immediately noticed, they could swiftly eliminate their opponents and withdraw calmly. By the time Haitang Academy discovered anything, it would be too late to intervene.</p><p>Confirming this, Qin Sang and Su Nu infiltrated the formation, remaining undetected.  However, they still couldn't find the array's master.</p><p>The master was likely sealed within some treasure, using it for concealment; otherwise, they wouldn't be able to hide from Tianmu Butterfly.  Even so, Tianmu Butterfly detected an anomaly.  Unable to probe it directly, Qin Sang and Su Nu kept watch.</p><p>"No need to rush," Qin Sang transmitted his voice, "The moment the formation completes, even the best-hidden master will leak a trace of energy…"</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu patiently waited.  Several days later, Qin Sang sensed a faint tremor in the void, accompanied by two fleeting, subtle auras. Before they could investigate, they vanished.</p><p>They would have missed it without their constant vigilance. The auras emanated from the anomaly Tianmu Butterfly had discovered, accompanied by a flash of dark light.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Su Nu, who had also sensed it. She said gravely, "Two Empty Realm, Second Stage experts."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Probably early stage."</p><p>With only two guarding the place, Qin Sang and Su Nu could probably seize the person, but Qin Sang remained cautious.</p><p>His gaze swept across the islands below, teeming with ordinary cultivators, various creatures, and beasts.  It was impossible to know which was the Siyou clan member's companion beast.  Their focus was solely on the two Empty Realm, Second Stage experts.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu braced themselves; the formation was complete; it was time to act!</p><p>…</p><p>A towering peak pierced the clouds, dominating most of the island.</p><p>The mountain was covered in pines and bamboos, shrouded in mist—a prime cultivation location, though the spiritual energy was somewhat thin.  Apart from a few minor sects, mostly independent cultivators practiced there.</p><p>On the east side of the peak, facing the sea, the terrain was steep, impassable to ordinary people, yet clusters of spiritual light dotted the area.</p><p>Each cluster marked a cultivator's dwelling, some with luxurious courtyards, some home to families spanning generations.</p><p>Within a smaller cluster of green light was a humble cave carved into the cliff face. A woman paced anxiously outside, repeatedly gazing seaward.</p><p>Finally, a green light approached from the distance. The woman's brow relaxed as she quickly opened the protective barrier.</p><p>The green light entered the cave, revealing a man in green robes.</p><p>The woman examined him, worried. "Husband, you're breathing so heavily. Were you injured? Quickly take this Blood-Nourishing Powder!"</p><p>She presented a jade bottle, holding it aloft.</p><p>"Thank you, my wife."</p><p>The man in green accepted the bottle, bowed his thanks, and consumed the medicine.</p><p>Haitang Academy valued courtesy; even between husband and wife or daoist partners, respect was paramount.  While the Academy didn't interfere in private matters, the prevailing atmosphere fostered this behavior.</p><p>After taking the medicine, the man’s breathing evened. He bowed again, presenting a wooden box. "Thanks to the Blood-Nourishing Powder you refined, my journey was successful. I've obtained the Jinxian Flower."</p><p>"Then Tan'er can refine the Shadow Form Spell!"</p><p>The woman rejoiced.</p><p>Footsteps sounded from within, startling a frail youth from meditation, who bowed meticulously.</p><p>"Tan'er greets Father! Greets Mother."</p><p>The woman quickly gave the box to the boy.  "Your father fought hard for this Jinxian Flower, Tan'er. Refine it quickly!"</p><p>The boy looked at his father, thanked his parents, and returned to his chamber with the box.</p><p>Watching his back, tears welled in the woman's eyes.  "Though Tan'er failed the Literary List, if he refines the Shadow Form Spell, he can still try for the Martial List. We may never achieve the Dao, but if Tan'er enters the Academy, I will die without regret."</p><p>The man embraced his wife, his expression filled with emotion. He was about to offer comfort when his expression hardened, his eyes sharpening, as he abruptly looked towards the sky.</p><p>Simultaneously, the boy, halfway into his chamber, stiffened, slowly turning around. His expression was cold, utterly different, as if a different person inhabited his body.</p><p>A woman gasped, then fainted, collapsing to the ground.  The father and son didn't even glance at her.</p><p>"It's finally here!  We hid here, and still they won't leave us alone!"</p><p>The man in green clothes' face contorted in rage. His voice, now old and shrill, betrayed his fury.  The boy remained silent, walking towards the cave entrance.  As he took a step, a grayish-white aura poured from his body, blurring his form.  Then, it seemed as if he shed his skin, revealing another person within.</p><p>The discarded form remained, a lifeless husk, bearing the boy's appearance and scent but entirely devoid of life.  The father and son were actually two members of the Siyou clan, their disguise no longer needed now that their enemy had found them.</p><p>Emerging from the boy was another youth, strikingly beautiful with flawless skin, delicate features, and an androgynous quality. As he appeared, the grayish-white aura coiled around the discarded husk vanished, entering the newcomer's brow, where a perfectly round pearl seemed embedded.  The pearl glowed faintly, pulsing with inner light, enhancing the youth's ethereal presence.</p><p>The other Siyou clan member also revealed his true form—an older man, his brow etched with fatigue and a hint of decay.  Yet, unlike his companion, he exuded no effeminate air.</p><p>The two stood before the cave, gazing at the sky.  Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, blotting out the sun and casting the surrounding sea in shadow.</p><p>The older man sighed. "My lord, the enemy is clearly prepared. We must brace ourselves for the worst."</p><p>The young man's expression changed.  "Xia Changshi, why such pessimism? We still have our companion beast.  The enemy believes it perished in their last attack, thanks to our clan's secret technique.  If we play our cards right, we can escape."</p><p>"Even if we escape this time, we'll lose our companion beast, and they'll keep hunting us. Imprisonment is inevitable," Xia Changshi said sadly.</p><p>The young man grew anxious. "While they're causing chaos here, we could lure the experts from Haitang Academy…"</p><p>"Haitang Academy won't intervene. They'll just expel us, leaving the situation unchanged."</p><p>Xia Changshi, his mind made up, stopped the boy. "My lord, I know you're kind-hearted, but this is the only way to ensure your escape. You must remember, only by surviving do you have a chance. You must protect yourself!"</p><p>He bowed deeply.  "I have failed my duty to our master and can no longer serve you. You must take care of yourself."</p><p>The young man remained silent, biting his lip until it bled.</p><p>Xia Changshi, resolute, waved his sleeve. "My lord, come, let us face our enemies!"</p><p>With a flash of light, he launched himself toward the sky.</p><p>High above, two figures stood amidst the clouds, observing below. One resembled Ji Zhou, with wolf ears, but his were marked with swirling patterns, like portals to another realm—a powerful member of the Quanfeng clan.  His companion wore a white robe, their face concealed, their identity unknown.</p><p>The Quanfeng warrior, Jiliang, his eyes piercing, gazed through the clouds at the cave.  "Are we certain that the youth is the Siyou clan's heir?"</p><p>"Elder Quan stated it himself.  Do you doubt his judgment, Brother Ji?"  The robed figure said confidently.  "Within the Siyou clan, there's a strict hierarchy.  The most powerful techniques are held by the royal family. That elder, a high-ranking attendant, would risk his life only for royal blood."</p><p>Jiliang chuckled. "It's curious. No one's arrived from the Mist Sea recently.  What happened?  To find the Siyou heir in Lansha Prefecture...this is our opportunity.  Capturing him and presenting him to the upper clan will bring great rewards.  Are your preparations complete? This is a battle we cannot afford to lose.  Elder Quan is watching."</p>
