Chapter 582: Betrayal


The Shadow Leopard attacked again.


This time, under the illumination of the Blood Ban, Qin Sang vaguely saw a shadowy phantom hurtling towards Yun Youzi with incredible speed.


The Shadow Leopard's stealth abilities were rendered useless.


Not only that, its speed was also slower than before, as if burdened by a mountain.


"Attack its abdomen, it's severely wounded!"


Yun Youzi, fully activating the Pristine Pearl, shouted urgently.


Qin Sang understood immediately. The Shadow Leopard must have been injured during the destruction of the Small North Star Yuan Formation in the Sin Abyss.  This injury wasn't easily healed, and its abdomen was its weak point.


Qin Sang flashed behind Yun Youzi, unleashing all of his Nine Nether Demon Fire and ordering the Flying Night Rakshasa to attack.


The Nine Nether Demon Fire transformed into a fire dragon, shooting out to intercept the Shadow Leopard.


Sensing the Nine Nether Demon Fire's aura, the Shadow Leopard's eyes narrowed slightly. It sensed the unusual nature of this strange flame, recognizing its potential threat.


What bad luck!


Two cultivators, neither of whom had reached the Golden Core stage, not only possessed magical treasures capable of threatening him, but also manipulated the Blood Ban.


The Shadow Leopard regretted its actions. It should have secretly eliminated these two people while hidden.


'Whoosh...whoosh...'


Despite its regret, the Shadow Leopard's movements remained unaffected.


With a furious roar, countless claw shadows appeared, exuding a terrifying aura capable of tearing everything apart. Unexpectedly, the expected one-sided battle didn't materialize when the claw shadows and Nine Nether Demon Fire collided.


The Nine Nether Demon Fire was torn apart by the Shadow Leopard, but after dissipating, it quickly recombined, refusing to be extinguished.


Simultaneously, the Flying Night Rakshasa, emerging unexpectedly from the flames at a critical angle, struck the Shadow Leopard's abdomen with a powerful punch.


The Shadow Leopard roared again, twisting its body to avoid the blow.


It had indeed been injured there!


After dodging the surprise attack, the Shadow Leopard repelled the Flying Night Rakshasa.


'Boom!'


The Flying Night Rakshasa flew back, several claw marks marring its body.  These looked severe but didn't damage its core.


Their combined efforts managed to momentarily restrain the Shadow Leopard!


Seeing this, Qin Sang was also surprised. The Ten Directions Yama Banner was merely a low-grade magical treasure; the Nine Nether Demon Fire and the Flying Night Rakshasa were no match for the Shadow Leopard.


Only one possibility explained the situation: the Shadow Leopard's power was significantly weakened by the Blood Ban's restriction!


He glanced at Yun Youzi, who was moving faster and faster, his hand gestures blurring into a whirlwind of incantations. The light emanating from the four walls of the stone chamber intensified, pressing down layer upon layer onto the Shadow Leopard.


Remembering Yun Youzi's earlier instructions, Qin Sang urged the Nine Nether Demon Fire and the Flying Night Rakshasa to continue their assault, focusing on the Shadow Leopard's injury while secretly manipulating the Ebony Sword, his full attention fixed on the beast.


Then, a surprising sight unfolded.


The Shadow Leopard repeatedly tore apart the Nine Nether Demon Fire and repelled the Flying Night Rakshasa, but it couldn't approach Yun Youzi. Any attempt to reach the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit was met with resistance, and the pressure upon it intensified.


Then, after a cold look at Yun Youzi, it turned and fled.


Qin Sang instantly understood its intentions.


The Blood Ban only existed within the stone chamber. Outside its range, they would lose their greatest advantage, leaving them vulnerable to the Shadow Leopard.


The Shadow Leopard was acutely aware of the Blood Ban's power â€“ a terrifying legacy from a transformed demon at the Metamorphosis Stage. If Yun Youzi unleashed its full potential, it could easily kill the Shadow Leopard.


Uncertain about Yun Youzi's true capabilities, the Shadow Leopard chose not to risk it. By blocking the waterfall entrance and waiting for them, it could easily trap Qin Sang and the others.


Qin Sang hadn't expected the Shadow Leopard to be so decisive, abandoning the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit without hesitation.


It couldn't be allowed to escape!


However, the Shadow Leopard's speed was too fast to stop.


"Brother Qin!"


Yun Youzi suddenly roared.


Qin Sang, remembering Yun Youzi's instructions, acted instinctively, instantly summoning the Ebony Sword and transforming into a sword beam, shooting out.


A thunderous roar echoed throughout the stone chamber, deafeningly loud.


The flying sword, swift as a meteor, pressed forward relentlessly.


Yun Youzi didn't disappoint Qin Sang. He tapped the Pristine Pearl.


In an instant, the stone chamber plunged into darkness.


Yunyouzi unleashed the blood-suppressing power he had been holding back, focusing all the light on the Shadow Leopard, dramatically increasing the pressure on the beast.  

Immediately, the Immaculate Pearl vibrated, shooting a strange light arrow that overtook Qin Sang's flying sword, enveloping the Shadow Leopard.

The moment the light arrow enveloped it, the Shadow Leopard froze in a bizarre pose, fixed in place.

Yunyouzi's words weren't empty boasts; the Immaculate Pearl truly could restrain a demonic cultivator. Even a mid-Core Formation Shadow Leopard was trapped.

A lightning-fast sword flash followed.

After the Shadow Leopard was restrained by the Immaculate Pearl, a grey pearl, about the size of a dragon's eye, flew out from the sword light.

The grey pearl was greyish-white, its surface occasionally flashing silver.  It flew towards the Shadow Leopard, seemingly slow but deceptively fast.

The pearl rotated gently, giving the illusion of slowness, yet the silver light on its surface intensified.  

This seemingly small pearl revealed an extremely violent power, growing stronger and stronger, causing everyone to tremble.

Yunyouzi narrowed his eyes from a distance.

The ebony sword halted abruptly and then retreated violently.

Even Qin Sang, the wielder, greatly feared the Void Heaven Thunder, afraid of being affected.

"Roar!"

The Shadow Leopard finally broke free from the Immaculate Pearl's restraint, but immediately faced the terrifying Void Heaven Thunder, letting out an enraged roar.

Silver light erupted, dazzlingly bright.

In the stone hall, it was as if a small sun had appeared.

However, the silver light's range was small, covering less than a zhang (approximately 3.3 meters).

From the eruption to the dissipation of the silver light, it took only an instant, without a sound, and then the light vanished.

Apart from some semi-circular craters on the ground and the pulverized stones around them, no other trace remained, as if it had never existed.

The Shadow Leopard had also disappeared, seemingly swallowed by the silver light.

The next moment, a sudden change occurred.

The void twisted, revealing the Shadow Leopard's form.

It looked horrific. Its entire left foreleg, from the neck down, was gone, its bloody insides exposed, its breath weak.

Yet, it was still alive.  It sprang away, fleeing desperately, leaving a trail of blood!

Qin Sang watched the Shadow Leopard coldly, prepared for this.

He hadn't unsealed the Corpse Pill; firstly, Yunyouzi's plan didn't require his direct intervention, and secondly, he was waiting for such an opportunity to strike unexpectedly.

Qin Sang focused his mind, enveloping the Corpse Pill.

Just as he was about to unseal it, a sudden premonition struck him.

Then, he caught sight of a dark shadow lunging towards him.

It was the Flying Night Rakshasa!
