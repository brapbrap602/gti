<h1>Chapter 1968: Reluctance</h1><p>The valley was shrouded in mist, a scene of ethereal beauty.  Waterfalls cascaded like silk, clear streams gurgled merrily.  A picture of serenity.  Outsiders would mistake it for a sacred land of immortals, never suspecting it was a gathering place for demons, led by the corpse demon of the Soul-Falling Abyss.</p><p>Suddenly, a shadow fell over the valley, cloaked in thick, dark clouds.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>A roar echoed from within the valley, followed by a dozen figures leaping into the air.  Before they could see what was in the clouds, a five-colored beam shot out, heading straight for a stone hall at the valley’s edge.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The beam passed, leaving everyone dumbfounded.  The magnificent stone hall had vanished before their eyes.</p><p>“That… was Elder Lu’s abode.  Elder Lu hasn’t been out recently…”</p><p>A young man swallowed hard, his voice lost.  Elder Lu was said to be a Yuan Ying ancestor from the Soul-Falling Abyss, known for his eccentric temperament.  Though he chose to build his abode at the valley’s edge, even the cultivators deep within the valley treated him with respect.</p><p>“Elder Lu’s disciples and several Kunyuan Mountain experts… all gone!”</p><p>A Yuan Ying ancestor, and a dozen or so demonic cultivators—all wiped out without a trace of resistance by the five-colored light.  They likely didn't even know what hit them, or who killed them.</p><p>Fear gripped everyone.  They turned to flee, but it was too late.  They were engulfed in the five-colored light and lost consciousness.  Just like the hall, they vanished without a trace.</p><p>*Dong! Dong! Dong!*</p><p>A rapid bell tolled below.  The cultivators in the valley sensed something was wrong and sounded the alarm.  The valley erupted in chaos.  The bell startled them from their dwellings.  Figures hung suspended in mid-air, staring upwards.</p><p>Then, grey-white smoke billowed from the valley.  This was refined corpse energy, specially refined.  Eighty-one pillars of corpse energy shot towards the sky.  In the air, they dispersed and merged, forming a grey-white cloud beneath the dark clouds above, seemingly to support it and prevent it from descending upon the valley.</p><p>Deep in the valley, several figures floated above a gloomy stone hall.  Their eyes shimmered with various colored lights as they used their spiritual vision to peer through the dark clouds, catching a glimpse of the figure within.  Despite knowing appearances can be deceiving in the cultivation world, their expressions turned strangely peculiar.</p><p>“Who is that woman?” someone asked.</p><p>“Is it a Yun Du Tian expert seeking revenge? We’ve all been following Master Qi’s orders. Did someone offend someone powerful?”</p><p>Their question was answered by a deafening roar.  The ground shook, the valley walls trembled violently, threatening to collapse. The newly formed corpse cloud shattered, about to dissipate.</p><p>Panic surged through them. This was a temporary base, only protected by a rudimentary Ascending Nether Array; no other formations were in place.  The enemy hadn't even used the five-colored beam again, just the pressure of the dark clouds, and the array was on the verge of collapse.  What terrifying power!</p><p>“Flee!”</p><p>Seeing something even more fearsome than themselves, they lost all will to fight and scattered in all directions.  The corpse cloud split, demonic energy poured down. The scene was terrifying, beyond their comprehension.</p><p>The valley’s demons froze in terror, scattering like startled birds.  The entire valley was in utter chaos.</p><p>One black-robed man escaped the valley, only to look back and see the fleeing crowd.  Just as he felt relief, a five-colored light, swift as lightning, shot towards him.</p><p>Terror struck him.  Instinctively, he summoned his prized magic treasure, a white banner with ghost patterns.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The banner unfurled, a long strip across the sky. Then, a *poof*, and the five-colored light pierced through it effortlessly. The black-robed man’s eyes widened, as the light struck him, and he vanished.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded everywhere. None of the first escapees survived.</p><p>Meanwhile, violent roars echoed from the valley as the corpse energy pillars collapsed one after another. The corpse cloud had been dispersed. The Ascending Nether Array didn’t last a moment; the corpse energy recoiled, turning into a raging wind that swept across the land.  Buildings and pavilions crumbled.</p><p>Some cultivators, not from the Soul-Severing Abyss, accidentally inhaled corpse energy.  Their bodies immediately erupted in countless blood blisters, causing unbearable itching.  </p><p>They scratched frantically, tearing the blisters open, leaving them bleeding profusely and in excruciating pain.  The itching remained relentless, and they thrashed on the ground, their flesh turning bluish-black at a terrifying speed.</p><p>Screams echoed through the valley.</p><p>Five-colored light rained down like scattered flowers from heaven, ending their suffering.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, hundreds of cultivators in the valley were slaughtered, not a single one surviving.  Rage fueled the massacre.</p><p>Simultaneously, these horrific scenes were reflected in Xiao Wu's demonic eyes.</p><p>Xiao Wu's gaze suddenly faltered, her face showing a struggle, as she hung suspended in the air.</p><p>Suddenly, a roar echoed from afar.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>A streak of pale corpse energy shot across the sky, ridden by a white-haired man.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>The white-haired man surveyed Xiao Wu from a distance, recognizing her as a stranger, none of the Nine Immortals of Yun Du.</p><p>"A newly risen expert from Yun Du?"</p><p>This thought flashed through the white-haired man's mind. He said sternly, "Regardless of your identity, the senseless slaughter of hundreds warrants an explanation to Yun Du!"</p><p>As he spoke, the white-haired man made eye contact with Xiao Wu, his heart jolting.</p><p>The next moment, the five-element divine light was upon him.</p><p>He lasted longer than the cultivators in the valley, but the outcome remained unchanged.  A formidable cultivator at the Divine Transformation stage, assigned to oversee the situation— what he thought would be an easy task, avoiding the most dangerous vortex— instead met a senseless end.</p><p>Drawn to the white-haired man, Xiao Wu subconsciously flew towards him.  She continued to struggle, her delicate body trembling slightly, battling the demonic influence within.</p><p>Shortly after, she encountered Yin corpse, and with a casual gesture, killed it instantly.  </p><p>Those who fell to Xiao Wu's hand were countless, just like Yin corpse. Among them, there were likely innocent people.</p><p>Xiao Wu moved intermittently.  She fought desperately; with each killing, the demonic influence grew stronger, and the struggle on her face intensified.</p><p>Finally, a city appeared ahead.</p><p>This was a cultivator's market, inhabited by cultivators and ordinary people alike.  A dark demonic cloud shrouded the market, plunging everything into impenetrable darkness, filling everyone with terror.</p><p>Xiao Wu, looking down from above, saw everyone, their eyes filled with fear. Her struggle deepened.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Sha Jia Yu and Yu Lang finally caught up.</p><p>"Senior Sister!"</p><p>Yu Lang called out loudly.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu tried to stop him, but Yu Lang firmly refused. He flew into the demonic cloud, approaching Xiao Wu.</p><p>"Senior Sister, this is Wu Lang."</p><p>Yu Lang gently lifted the swaddling clothes of a baby, showing it to Xiao Wu.</p><p>Perhaps because Xiao Wu appeared as a young girl, the baby didn't seem afraid, but rather showed curiosity towards her dark eyes, reaching out for a hug, babbling happily.</p><p>Xiao Wu stared intently at the baby, and the demonic energy seemed to recede.</p><p>She didn't take the baby, but simply watched.</p><p>After a long time, she slowly closed her eyes.</p><p>In that instant, the light seemed to brighten, and Yu Lang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Only then did Sha Jia Yu dare to approach, softly saying, "Xiao Wu is suppressing the demonic influence; don't disturb her."</p><p>The demonic cloud swirled, Xiao Wu's expression gradually calming down.  She manipulated the cloud, enveloping Yu Lang and Sha Jia Yu, and flew away.</p><p>With the demonic cloud gone, the people in the market felt a profound sense of relief.</p><p>Xiao Wu's pace was slow, retracing her steps, seemingly heading back to Bei Kuo County.</p><p>Above Xi Wu Village, Xiao Wu stopped suddenly.</p><p>Following Xiao Wu's gaze, the two saw a willow tree burned to a crisp by the village.</p><p>The charred trunk had a touch of green at the base—new shoots had sprouted from the roots.</p><p>Delicate branches, bright green buds.</p><p>They gently swayed in the breeze.</p><p>The willow spirit was gone, its resurrection unlikely, yet this new growth symbolized hope, precious indeed.</p><p>Yu Lang and Sha Jia Yu exchanged a glance and stepped forward.  "Senior Sister, shall we take it back to Qing Yang Temple?"</p><p>"It surely wishes to continue guarding this place," Xiao Wu said softly.</p><p>Yu Lang persuaded, "It's too weak now.  Let's take it back to Qing Yang Temple, to keep Wu Lang company.  We can return it once it grows stronger."</p><p>Xiao Wu didn't respond, watching as Yu Lang used magic to carefully move the entire tree.  Then, she swiftly returned to Bei Kuo County, to Chen Ya'er's home.</p><p>She carefully removed the rubble, revealing the bodies of Chen Ya'er and her spouse.  She arranged their bodies respectfully, then took them to a mountain outside the city.</p><p>They chose a place with good feng shui, dug a grave, and prepared to bury them there.  From the grave, they could see Beiku County and the river where Chen Ya’er spent his life.</p><p>Finally, Xiao Wu produced a scroll.</p><p>The painting, one of several Xiao Wu painted when Qingyang Temple was first built, depicted Chen Ya’er spearing fish.  It had been used to decorate the temple windows, faded from sun and wind, and had been saved by Qin Sang.  Qin Sang returned the paintings to Xiao Wu when she descended the mountain.</p><p>Unfurling the scroll, Xiao Wu gazed at the scene, a look of remembrance in her eyes.  She gently placed the painting over Chen Ya’er and his wife, burying it with them.</p><p>Yu Lang, holding the baby, bowed before the grave.  Xiao Wu nodded to him and vanished.</p><p>"Let's go back," Sha Jia Yu said.</p><p>"I want to go home," Yu Lang murmured.</p><p>At the Qingyang Tea House, he had thought of his hometown, but had suppressed his anxiety out of concern for his senior sister.</p><p>Sha Jia Yu sighed softly, patting Yu Lang on the shoulder.  "I'll go with you, brother."</p><p>…</p><p>It was the same road, but without the refugees fleeing. She and her master had once provided medicine and aid here.</p><p>Xiao Wu’s expression shifted. She landed silently, her toes lightly touching the ground.  A puff of white smoke appeared, revealing an old man.</p><p>"Spare me, Immortal! Spare me!"</p><p>The old man was the land deity from that time.  She remembered her master giving him the amulet to control the demons; the deity’s former ambition and spirited demeanor were gone, replaced by a hunched back and repeated pleas for mercy, his spirit seemingly broken.</p><p>Xiao Wu sighed softly. "Do you remember me?"</p><p>The deity froze, cautiously raising his head.  His face lit up with joy.  "You are the Immortal Xiao Wu! Has the Daoist returned?"</p><p>He looked around anxiously, his face full of hope.</p><p>"Master isn't here."</p><p>Xiao Wu shook her head slightly.  "What happened to you? Where are Yin’er and the others?"</p><p>At this question, the land deity's heart was flooded with bitterness, and he began to pour out his woes.</p><p>"After the Daoist and the Immortal left, I tried to restore the divine path, using the amulet the Daoist left to control the demons. It went well at first, but soon the situation changed.</p><p>"I sensed danger and kept a low profile.  The atmosphere grew increasingly strange, so I abandoned my temple and hid in the mountains.</p><p>"Those demons who had reformed, I warned and released.  Those who remained obstinate, I had no choice but to end their lives to prevent them from harming others.</p><p>"Later, the cultivation world became increasingly chaotic.  I couldn’t even keep the temple, so I destroyed it and have been hiding here, barely surviving.</p><p>"As for Yin’er and the other three girls, after they married, they continued to serve at the temple. I had to send them away to live among ordinary people.</p><p>"Rest assured, Immortal, they have my mark, and they are safe."</p><p>Having slain the corpse demons of the Luohun Abyss, including a Nascent Soul cultivator, Xiao Wu already knew part of the plan.</p><p>The secular world was the game board, a game of '人间' (human realm), where neither side would use magical power to directly interfere.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean the players were all mortals.</p><p>Both sides would send disciples down the mountain, sealing their cultivation, controlling worldly power, and vying for victory through secular means.</p><p>The human nations were mere pieces on the board, battling each other.</p><p>For Yin’er and the others, the greatest threat was not demons, but human warfare.</p><p>Xiao Wu pondered, then waved her small hand.  Five-colored light shimmered, coalescing into a multicolored robe in her hand, which she gave to the deity.</p><p>"Wear this robe; be cautious.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators won't be able to detect you."</p><p>It was imbued with the power of the five elements.</p><p>The deity was both surprised and delighted. He couldn't imagine an artifact capable of hiding from the spiritual perception of a Nascent Soul cultivator. He understood why Xiao Wu had expended her energy to create this robe, and he immediately swore, "I swear to heaven, I'll risk my life to ensure that not a single hair on Yin’er’s heads is harmed! They live in a small town three hundred miles away.  Would the Immortal like to see them?"</p><p>Xiao Wu hesitated for a moment, then gently shook her head.  "Until we meet again."</p><p>Before her words faded, Xiao Wu disappeared.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the deity, Xiao Wu went nowhere else. She didn't want to stop for a moment, flying back to Yan State with all her might.</p><p>Finally, she saw Qingyang Temple.  Like a traveler returning home, her heart settled.</p><p>A peaceful and tranquil village.</p><p>A vibrant school.</p><p>A Daoist stood on the stone by the temple gate – her master, waiting for her return.</p><p>Qin Sang said nothing, his gaze gentle as he watched Xiao Wu land.</p><p>Xiao Wu pursed her lips, looking aggrieved.  She clutched Qin Sang's clothes tightly, snuggling close to him.</p><p>"Master, I don't want to leave the mountain again."</p>
