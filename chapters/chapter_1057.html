<h1>Chapter 1449: True Dragon Remains</h1><p>Elder Wan warned everyone.</p><p>The chief shaman and others quickly produced their antidotal treasures.</p><p>The grey-robed elder, skilled in poisons, distributed some specially-prepared antidote pills.</p><p>Everyone then prepared their positions and teleported in succession.</p><p>The light of the teleportation array faded.</p><p>For a moment, the stone hall fell silent again.</p><p>Above the stone hall, at the edge of the canyon, a person stood silently, hands behind their back, gazing down at the hall. Their gaze seemed to penetrate the dangerous restrictions within the valley.</p><p>Neither the chief shaman nor Fang Laomo noticed this person.</p><p>Their stealthy entry into the valley and the opening of the stone hall were all observed by this individual.</p><p>“How do you understand the shamanic array? Even the Witch Clan's chief shaman couldn't detect your actions.”</p><p>A voice rang out, seemingly originating from within this person's body.</p><p>“The Witch Clan's own traditions have been broken.  Was it really that hard to deceive them?”</p><p>The person retorted, as if speaking to themselves.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the internal voice echoed again, its tone cold. “Luring the Witch Clan into the inner hall, what is your goal? Whatever your purpose, with me here, you will not succeed!”</p><p>“Oh? What are you afraid of?”</p><p>A smirk played on the person's lips. “I never knew you possessed such compassionate sentiments.”</p><p>“I have no desire to bear the burden of the world, but a great calamity must not begin because of me!”</p><p>The internal voice boomed, firm and resolute.</p><p>The person sneered. “You admit this avatar and you are one?  If so, why not give up resistance? Let me consume you, and I'll know your purpose.”</p><p>After the chief shaman and others activated the teleportation array, the person leaped and left the area as well.</p><p>…</p><p>Inner Hall.</p><p>An unknown secret realm.</p><p>The Jiao Long King and the other demon kings, having broken through the celestial barrier, found themselves in this desolate place, unable to escape.</p><p>“Daoist Nine Phoenix, how much longer until we can leave this secret realm? If we continue like this, the Seven Killing Hall will close before we escape, and I don't want to be trapped here. Why didn't we use the True Phoenix Feather to teleport directly to the inner hall in the first place?”</p><p>The heavily armored man grumbled, his tone impatient.</p><p>Upon entering, the demons discovered they hadn’t reached the inner hall directly. This place was unlike any description of the inner hall; it was a secret realm sealed off by celestial barriers within the inner hall.</p><p>Celestial barriers were common in the inner hall; this was not unexpected.</p><p>The demon kings could only search for the exit.</p><p>If they couldn’t even leave the secret realm before the Seven Killing Hall closed, there would be no treasure hunt.  The only good news was that the realm lacked fierce beasts and other dangers.</p><p>Nine Phoenix King was their only hope of escape, but even she was clueless.</p><p>“I used the power of a restriction left by a senior member of the Phoenix Clan; the opposing forces shattered the celestial barrier, allowing the True Phoenix Feather to pass through. It would be far less likely to succeed elsewhere.  Furthermore, besides the few areas explored by humans, the inner hall is extremely dangerous. Avoiding this place means facing other risks.”</p><p>Nine Phoenix King, displeased by the heavily armored man’s aggressive tone, looked cold and responded curtly.</p><p>The Jiao Long King interjected, “Brother Hei, don't be anxious. This secret realm must have been left behind by an ancestor of the Phoenix Clan; most others would be trapped here.  Daoist Nine Phoenix is a descendant of the Phoenix Clan and possesses the True Phoenix Feather. Finding the exit is not difficult, but it takes time.”</p><p>Pausing, the Jiao Long King addressed Nine Phoenix King. “Daoist Nine Phoenix, Brother Hei’s concern is valid. Once we leave the secret realm, I need to use the Dragon Summoning Incantation to confirm the location of the True Dragon remains. If it’s too far, we need to allow sufficient travel time. We should prioritize escaping quickly.”</p><p>Nine Phoenix King nodded, raising her jade hand. The True Phoenix Feather hovered in her palm, imbued with her continuously flowing True Qi.</p><p>She closed her eyes, sensing something.</p><p>The armored man chuckled, not daring to disturb Nine Phoenix King.  He looked at the bone in the Jiao Long King’s hand and curiously asked, “Daoist friend, the Dragon Summoning Incantation, is it a secret technique passed down in your Jiao Long clan?”</p><p>The Jiao Long King nodded. “Legend has it that a True Dragon's body is entirely treasure; after death, its remains cannot be left outside, but must be returned to the dragon tomb for burial to avoid desecration. The Dragon Clan therefore created a blood-seeking method to find the remains. Although the Dragon Summoning Incantation is passed down in our clan, it's said to be derived from this True Dragon technique. This bone is from a True Dragon, which I obtained from a human Yuan Ying cultivator. I later interrogated him and he confessed it was obtained accidentally from the Seven Killing Hall’s inner hall."</p><p>As long as the Seven Kills Hall holds the dragon corpse, we can find it using the bones and the *Dragon Summoning Manual*…”</p><p>The strong, shell-backed warrior's eyes flickered.  “Fellow Daoist, how powerful do you think that true dragon was in its prime? If it was a Celestial Demon-level dragon, wouldn't its bones have decayed more?”</p><p>“The might of a Celestial Demon is beyond our comprehension.”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King stared at the almost-decayed bone in his hand.  “Regardless, the true dragon's power surely far surpasses ours. A single relic from it would greatly increase our strength. If it's an untouched corpse, even if the bones are decayed, we could still find the dragon scale, true blood, or even the far more valuable demon core.  Then, achieving Ascension or even Void Refinement would no longer be a pipe dream…”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King’s tone held a hint of temptation.</p><p>The other demon kings listened, captivated, longing to claim the dragon corpse for themselves.</p><p>“The gap between this era and the ancient cultivation world exists on many levels; a single dragon corpse can't bridge it. Otherwise, we wouldn't even see many Ascension stage cultivators, let alone Void Refinement.”</p><p>The shell-backed warrior remained clear-headed, unmoved by the Jiao Dragon King's words.  “I'll be satisfied if I can smoothly break through to the late Transformation stage and endure several more Heavenly Tribulations. If there's truly a chance at Ascension, I only hope that Fellow Daoist succeeds. We'll help you seize the teleportation array, counterattack the cultivators, and make both realms the Demon Race's domain! I just fear that the human cultivators have already found and plundered the dragon corpse.”</p><p>He worried about a wasted journey.</p><p>But the Jiao Dragon King was confident, saying calmly,  “Even if we place this bone before human cultivators, they'd be blind to its significance. Besides, a true dragon corpse is a treasure for both our Demon Race and human cultivators. If they had found it, there would be signs by now. Every true dragon has means to protect its remains after death. If it was extremely powerful in life, some protection may remain, and outsiders won't easily remove the whole corpse.  Then, Hei Xiong, you'll see.”</p><p>Unable to help the Nine-Phoenix King, they planned their next move.</p><p>Searching for treasures in the inner hall might lead to a clash with a human Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord need no further explanation.</p><p>The three Great Merchant League leaders, though not great cultivators, are said to be peak Nascent Soul mid-stage experts, far surpassing their peers. Both righteous and demonic paths fear them, which speaks volumes.</p><p>Compared to the humans, only the Jiao Dragon King among the demon kings is in the late Transformation stage; their strength is far inferior to the humans.</p>
