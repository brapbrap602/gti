<h1>Chapter 870:  A Calculated Plan</h1><p>Chapter 870:  A Calculated Plan</p><p>It’s too early to dwell on this now.  Qin Sang didn’t know how to refine more Beast King Banners, so he put the nine banners into his storage ring.</p><p>“So many treasures?”</p><p>Qin Sang opened the black-robed man’s pouch and was shocked by what he found after a quick scan with his spiritual sense.</p><p>There were four high-grade spirit stones alone, along with several rare materials for refining tools and spirit medicines.</p><p>This man’s wealth surpassed even the peak Foundation Establishment cultivator Qin Sang had killed before.</p><p>Unknown to him, this man had been sent to recruit human loose cultivators in Tianxing City, so naturally he carried many treasures.  And this was only what was left after using some.</p><p>An unexpected windfall!</p><p>He thought he’d have to search everywhere for high-grade spirit stones, but now he had four, plus the one from the young man surnamed Fang.  More than enough to refine the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>There was no time to examine his spoils; Qin Sang tossed everything into his storage ring to sort later.</p><p>The consecutive battles had taken a heavy toll.  Qin Sang took several pills, held a spirit stone, and entered a meditative state to recover his spiritual energy.</p><p>When his spiritual energy had recovered to about 70%, he stopped his cultivation, got up, and looked into the distance.</p><p>The storm showed no sign of letting up; the clouds grew thicker.</p><p>Amidst the flashes of lightning and thunder, the night was a scene of chaos.</p><p>It was impossible to see the battlefield clearly from here.  After a moment of thought, he removed the surrounding restrictions, then disappeared into the wind and rain, stealthily approaching.</p><p>Shortly after, a golden light appeared in the distant sky.</p><p>The sound of beast roars, mixed with the wind, rain, and thunder, faintly reached his ears.</p><p>“It’s the Beast King Banners!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. “They’re still fighting!”</p><p>He suppressed his aura, preparing to get closer and see how the battle was unfolding.</p><p>However, before he could get closer, the golden light suddenly extinguished, and the roars ceased.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed, and he stopped.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>He frowned. The battle had ended so quickly; his sabotage of the Beast King Banner formation seemed to have had no effect.</p><p>In all likelihood, the Black Serpent Mountain cultivators had won. It seemed the mysterious group didn’t put up much resistance and were trapped and killed by the Beast King Banner formation.</p><p>This was normal. The mysterious group used such powerful lightning techniques; they couldn’t have done so without a cost, probably nearing exhaustion.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Black Serpent Mountain disciples lay in wait, fresh troops.</p><p>The contrast was clear; the outcome was predictable.</p><p>But his plan failed; he couldn’t fish in troubled waters, which frustrated Qin Sang.  He would have to swallow his anger for now and seek revenge later.</p><p>He glanced toward the island; there was no movement.  The Kui Dragon had probably been killed.</p><p>A moment later, several streams of light flew to the island, revealing the figures of the young man surnamed Fang and the others. They were carrying a captive; not only had they defeated their opponents but also captured several.</p><p>They weren’t unscathed; most were pale, their robes torn, their faces bearing anger.</p><p>An uninjured Black Serpent Mountain disciple searched the island, collecting the belongings of Chu Heng and the others.  Then he dismembered the Kui Dragon, taking everything valuable.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang's eyes were sharp as he scanned the area, seemingly vigilant. Finding nothing, after his disciples finished, he shouted, "Retreat!"</p><p>“Hmph! That brat got off easy, causing us so much trouble!”</p><p>“We’ll kill him sooner or later, to avenge Fourth Senior Brother and Junior Brother!”</p><p>“Rip him to shreds!”</p><p>…</p><p>The group muttered curses and threats as they flew off the island.</p><p>Then, the young man surnamed Fang cast several talismans, and everyone instantly disappeared, vanishing completely.</p><p>The rain poured down; the island was a mess.  The traces of the battle and the bloodstains were gradually washed away, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>…</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain disciples were gone without a trace.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang and his group were very cautious, leaving no clues.  Unable to find them to follow, Qin Sang hesitated for a while before silently retreating and leaving.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he stared into the depths of the rainy night, his expression shifting. He wasn't willing to give up so easily, but he needed to think carefully about his next move.</p><p>The identity of the mysterious group remained unclear. If he could find out who they were, he could gain insight into the Black Serpent Mountain's objectives and find a way to disrupt their scheme.</p><p>As far as he knew, the surrounding waters were unusually barren; there were virtually no islands with spirit veins, and no sect had established itself here.</p><p>Loose cultivators wouldn't open caves in such a place.</p><p>That mysterious group is stronger than some mid-sized sects.  They possess a Kui Long, a powerful guardian beast, yet they remain hidden here – it's puzzling.</p><p>It will likely take time to uncover their identities.</p><p>Alternatively, we could spread a rumor that Black Serpent Mountain cultivators are slaughtering human cultivators, using the major human factions to hunt them down without lifting a finger ourselves.</p><p>The point is, we can't let them rest easy.</p><p>However, with the attention of both races' experts and various factions focused on the Demon Sea, the effectiveness of this approach is uncertain.</p><p>Then Qin Sang suddenly remembered something else, his expression changing slightly. He abandoned this matter, and flew directly towards Tianxing City.</p><p>His external avatar is still in his cave abode in Tianxing City!</p><p>He killed two Black Serpent Mountain disciples, and the sect certainly won't let it go. His identity is easily traceable, including the location of his cave.</p><p>If his external avatar is exposed and discovered by Black Serpent Mountain, it will be trouble.</p><p>Aside from the Black Serpent Mountain ancestor, Qin Sang doesn't fear anyone else. But his external avatar is still weak and vulnerable; any Black Serpent Mountain disciple could easily capture and kill it.</p><p>He doesn't have time to refine a new external avatar.</p><p>Compared to revenge, the external avatar is far more important. It's connected to the ancient teleportation array, and even a one in ten thousand chance of something happening to it is unacceptable.</p><p>Qin Sang suspects Black Serpent Mountain has an informant in Tianxing City; otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to recruit so many human cultivators so easily.  That shopkeeper is highly suspicious.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang didn't dare linger.  Before Black Serpent Mountain could act, he needed to relocate his external avatar to a safe place to plan his next move without worry.</p><p>Even if it means missing the chance for revenge, he’ll accept it.</p><p>Qin Sang raced against time, almost without pause.</p><p>When his true energy was depleted, he summoned his two-headed… beast.</p><p>He traveled day and night, arriving near the Tianxing City sea area in less than two months.</p><p>Qin Sang changed into a cloak, assuming the identity of Daoist Qingfeng, and swaggered into the city. He wasn't worried; even the Black Serpent Mountain ancestor wouldn't dare kill within Tianxing City.</p><p>After entering the city, Qin Sang didn't rush to his cave abode on Baogu Mountain but went straight to the market, soon arriving near the shop, only to find it closed in broad daylight.</p><p>The shopkeeper had disappeared!</p><p>“This person certainly had something to do with it!”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and quietly left.</p>
