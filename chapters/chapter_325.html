<h1>**Chapter 318: Ask the Heavens, How Can I Become a Celestial?**</h1><p>As the sand cave shut, Qin Sang exhaled in relief.</p><p>First, he showed weakness, causing his opponent to relax their guard. When they gave chase, he took the initiative to return, using the secret talisman and Yin-Yang Compass to catch them off guard and swiftly close the distance, killing the strongest in one fell swoop.</p><p>This move appeared quite risky.</p><p>In fact, the worst possible outcome would have been the scarred man anticipating his attack and blocking his surprise assault.</p><p>With the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman, Qin Sang could still escape at any moment, extricating himself and avoiding a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>Without resorting to spirit treasures or the Ten Yama Banner, he had killed a formidable opponent and taken two prisoners. As Qin Sang reviewed the battle, he was quite satisfied with his performance.</p><p>After taking some time to recover, Qin Sang pointed a finger, conjuring an icy sphere of water out of thin air and splashing it on Yu Daiyue's face.</p><p>Yu Daiyue awoke from his stupor, momentarily confused. Then, he calmly gazed at Qin Sang without pleading or saying a word.</p><p>Qin Sang realized that Yu Daiyue had a death wish.</p><p>Yu Daiyue had to die, but Qin Sang was curious as to why Yu Daiyue was intent on killing him.</p><p>One after another, he cast intangible sound-like seals at Yu Daiyue, wrapping them around him. Yu Daiyue's brow furrowed; his spiritual energy was now depleted, and his Qi sea was sealed. Unable to resist, he could only be manipulated by Qin Sang.</p><p>No matter how many seals were placed on him, Yu Daiyue never felt any change, and he gradually grew impatient.</p><p>"Kill me!"</p><p>For the first time, Yu Daiyue spoke, urging Qin Sang to end his life. His voice was hoarse and strained.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him and moved his fingers even faster.</p><p>Finally, the last seal for the Divine Acquisition Curse took shape. With lightning speed, Qin Sang pointed at Yu Daiyue's brow; the seal's light flickered as it entered his body.</p><p>Yu Daiyue's body trembled, and a look of struggle crossed his eyes. Then, his eyes suddenly looked vacant, staring straight ahead.</p><p>The Divine Acquisition Curse had taken effect.</p><p>Having obtained this curse from Old Man Dique's belongings, Qin Sang had yet to use it since acquiring it. Seeing that Yu Daiyue was set on dying and would not answer any questions, he decided to test the curse's effects on him.</p><p>"Senior Yu, do I have a grudge with you?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked directly, addressing his greatest doubt.</p><p>"No grudges."</p><p>Yu Daiyue shook his head slightly from side to side, answering quickly in a monotonous voice.</p><p>"Why," Qin Sang crouched down, "why kill me?"</p><p>"Because you're a good-for-nothing!"</p><p>Yu Daiyue's expression suddenly became extraordinarily fierce, his eyes bloodshot and glaring at Qin Sang. Veins pulsed in his neck as he let out a hysterical roar.</p><p>"Good-for-nothing!</p><p>A good-for-nothing with only five spiritual elements!</p><p>A good-for-nothing who was drained by others, ruining your foundation!</p><p>Refuse!</p><p>How could you!</p><p>How could you break through before me!</p><p>Do you know how I spent these past years?</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Because of you, I couldn't even become a cauldron!</p><p>Because of Li Zai, I was punished by that old fart Feng Ming and nearly expelled from the sect!</p><p>I was desperate; to break through, I risked my life on the Ruins of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for twenty years!</p><p>Twenty years, I've entered and exited the most perilous secret realms countless times, teetering on the brink of life and death!</p><p>I've tried dozens, hundreds, thousands of times!</p><p>Every attempt failed!</p><p>All my efforts were utterly useless!</p><p>That damned bottleneck still stands tall!</p><p>It mocks me!</p><p>Fate mocks me as well!</p><p>Everyone mocks me!</p><p>What about you?</p><p>If you hadn't sold your body, you would never have built your foundation!</p><p>While I fought desperately outside, you hid away in the Silver Crystal Secret Realm for twenty years, and your strength has actually surpassed mine!</p><p>Now you've broken through again!</p><p>Why you?</p><p>Why…not…me?</p><p>Why…why…why…"</p><p>Venting his anger at heaven's injustice, Yu Daiyue's voice grew weaker and weaker. Yet, he stubbornly continued his tirade, his hoarse voice repeating the same three desperate words: "Why…why…why…"</p><p>Qin Sang quietly watched the maddened Yu Daiyue.</p><p>Unexpectedly, although Yu Daiyue had insulted him right to his face, he felt no anger. Even the hatred he harbored for being ambushed evaporated, leaving only an endless sorrow.</p><p>"So, when you insisted on exploring the Ancient Cultivator's Legacy together, you already intended to kill me. And five years ago, when you asked me to return to the legacy to gather the Earthfire Disk Tung, that was also a trap.</p><p>Qin Sang retorted coldly after Yu Daiyue’s outpouring, “Why make yourself sound so pitiful? Because I’m not as talented as you, you assume that my breakthrough must have involved some strange encounter that you want to seize for yourself, is that right? What did you mean when you told me to hand over the treasures I obtained from the Celestial Corpse Cave?”</p><p>“Without some fortuitous encounter, how could you have surpassed me? How could you have broken through before me?!”</p><p>Yu Daiyue’s tone was filled with certainty as he insisted, “In the Celestial Corpse Cave, you must have obtained a legacy treasure from the Celestial Corpse Sect in the most restricted area, otherwise you couldn’t have cultivated so quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and denounced, “Nonsense! The most restricted area of the Celestial Corpse Cave is a ruin. I went in there together with you, and we searched it together. There was no way I could have kept anything hidden… wait…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered that when he was about to enter the most restricted area of the Celestial Corpse Cave, it was he who had pushed open the heavy 玄铁gate before Yu Daiyue had arrived.</p><p>When Yu Daiyue had rushed over, he would have seen the open gate and Qin standing before it!</p><p>Qin Sang came to an abrupt realization.</p><p>Although he had not actually gone inside, anyone who had seen that scene would probably have suspected something.</p><p>No wonder…</p><p>Yu Daiyue’s cultivation had been obstructed at a bottleneck, and he had already given in to his inner demons.</p><p>Therefore, whenever Yu Daiyue remembered that scene and thought of Qin Sang having overtaken him, it would be like a thorn embedded deep in his heart.</p><p>Deeper and deeper, more and more painful, until it drove him mad.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent for a moment before suddenly asking, “Did you have the urge to kill me and seize the treasure?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Yu Daiyue shook his head from one side to the other.</p><p>A few moments later, Yu Daiyue’s eyes flickered for a moment as the effects of the Soul Seizing Curse weakened. The curse could not erase his memories, and he still remembered everything about what had happened just now.</p><p>Qin Sang did not wait for Yu Daiyue to speak, but sighed quietly. He called out, “Senior Brother Yu.”</p><p>“I’ll give you a quick death.”</p><p>With those words, Qin Sang pressed his palm against Yu Daiyue’s forehead and sent a surge of spiritual energy into him, shattering Yu Daiyue’s spiritual soul. Flames then erupted all over Yu Daiyue’s body, burning him to a cinder.</p><p>Let it be like Yu Daiyue had vanished on the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, just like countless fellow daoists who had struggled on the path of immortality only to silently perish from all manner of causes.</p><p>From this moment forth, all traces of Yu Daiyue would disappear from the world.</p><p>Qin Sang had killed more than one person with his own hands, and he now felt no ripples in his heart at the act of killing.</p><p>But having slain an enemy who had ambushed him, Qin Sang did not feel any sense of exhilaration. Instead, he only felt stifled.</p><p>He looked up to the sky, but although the thick layers of sand obscured the view so that he could not see the distant blue sky, it could not obstruct his thoughts.</p><p>Dare I ask the heavens, how does one become immortal?</p>
