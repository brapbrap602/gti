<h1>Chapter 2133: Subduing the Mountain</h1><p>As the Azure Roc True Thunder erupted, the divine ability was instantly broken.</p><p>Min Zhuo, utilizing the brief respite he had desperately bought, finally managed to deploy a spirit treasure.</p><p>This treasure resembled an alms bowl, empty within, its inner surface etched with intricate patterns. The patterns were incredibly lifelike, depicting a picturesque landscape of mountains and water.</p><p>A lake encircled the mountains, the water azure, the mountains verdant, vibrant with life.</p><p>The alms bowl expanded, its inner painting unfolding along with it. The landscape seemed poised to emerge from the painting, to enter reality.</p><p>At the same moment, above Min Zhuo, ripples appeared in the void. Faintly visible were the silhouettes of several mountain peaks, identical to the patterns carved within the alms bowl.</p><p>Mountain peaks loomed over Min Zhuo's head, azure water swirling around him, emitting a gurgling sound.</p><p>Before the landscape could fully manifest, the Azure Roc True Thunder detonated completely. A deafening roar echoed, countless azure lightning bolts crashing into the shadowy mountains and water.</p><p>In an instant, the shadows shattered, their spiritual light flickering violently. All the illusory images burst apart, swept away by the force of the thunder. The alms bowl tumbled from the sky. This treasure, its full power yet to be unleashed, was forced back to its original form, but it had managed to deflect some of the lightning.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>With no barrier remaining before him, the residual thunderous might engulfed Min Zhuo, the lightning swallowing him whole.</p><p>At this very moment, the wax figure in the Changyou Clan's ancestral hall began to burn fiercely.</p><p>As the lightning dispersed, Min Zhuo appeared, pale and disheveled, a grimace twisting his face.  He had been injured in the initial exchange, the disparity in their strength leaving him in despair.</p><p>Moreover, he was burdened by the ticking clock of the wax figure. If he couldn't escape before it burned to ashes, his injuries would return to his true body, new wounds compounding old, instantly stripping him of his ability to resist.</p><p>Now, Min Zhuo had completely abandoned any thought of vying for Mount Daiyu.  His only desire was to escape!</p><p>The alms bowl spun as it plummeted toward the abyss, seemingly out of control.</p><p>Suddenly, a rich, azure light burst forth from within the alms bowl, and the sounds of crashing waves filled the air.</p><p>It was as if countless waters were hidden within the void, now stirred by the alms bowl, these 'waters' manifesting into the world. The abyss, originally isolated from the outside seawater, clean and clear, was now filled with rippling waves, water flowing everywhere.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, these waters were actually composed of countless tiny droplets, so small and densely packed that they were indistinguishable to the naked eye, visible only to cultivators.</p><p>Simultaneously, Min Zhuo's entire body became translucent, then exploded. A suicidal act, yet not a trace of flesh or blood could be seen. His body shattered into countless minuscule water droplets, seamlessly merging into the surrounding currents, his aura vanishing along with him.</p><p>Perhaps Min Zhuo was concealed within an inconspicuous water droplet, or perhaps his body had truly fragmented, dispersed throughout all the droplets.  As long as a single drop could escape, he could live.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, knowing this must be a superior divine ability.  Had the Celestial Eye Butterfly been present, it might have been able to pinpoint his true form without effort. However, he was not without recourse.</p><p>These water currents were essentially Min Zhuo's manipulation of the surrounding Heavenly and Earthly Qi, empowered by the treasure.</p><p>The Azure Roc Dharma Idol and Min Zhuo were both at the early stage of their respective realms. The difference in their ability to control Heavenly and Earthly Qi wasn't vast, but a difference nonetheless existed.</p><p>Body cultivators and Dharma cultivators differed in their cultivation paths. The realms corresponding to Nascent Soul and Soul Formation were known as Inner Landscape and Outer Landscape, respectively. At the Inner Landscape realm, the ability to draw upon the world's essence to enrich oneself began to manifest, a characteristic carried over into the Outer Landscape realm.</p><p>The Dharma Idol could be considered a manifestation of the Outer Landscape realm, but the Outer Landscape was not limited to Dharma Idols.</p><p>Other body cultivation lineages might have different manifestations.</p><p>The Azure Roc Dharma Idol paused momentarily, its wings spreading wide.  The surrounding Heavenly and Earthly Qi instantly surged, visible streams of spiritual energy filling the void, transforming into a spiritual tide that rushed toward the Dharma Idol.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>The tremors of Mount Daiyu intensified.</p><p>The ancient restrictions surrounding the battlefield, previously relatively stable, now stirred restlessly.</p><p>Soul Formation cultivators rarely engaged in pure contests of Heavenly and Earthly Qi, as the situation could easily spiral out of control. But once begun, such a contest was inevitably earth-shattering.</p><p>Boundless Heavenly and Earthly Qi was devoured by the Azure Roc Dharma Idol, its wings like shadows cast by celestial clouds, blanketing the abyss. A single flap of its wings seemed capable of leveling the abyss, hinting at the legendary might of the divine bird.</p><p>The unclaimed Heavenly and Earthly Qi was quickly consumed by the Azure Roc Dharma Idol. Next came the seizure of the Heavenly and Earthly Qi already controlled by Min Zhuo.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang...'</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Countless water droplets splashed across the battlefield, transforming into pure spiritual energy, claimed by the Azure Roc Dharma Idol.</p><p>As the Heavenly and Earthly Qi was plundered, the water became riddled with holes, resembling countless floating bubbles. The water droplets that had filled the void thinned considerably, revealing subtle fluctuations that could no longer be concealed.</p><p>The Azure Roc Dharma Idol's gaze flashed, its wings twitching, lightning flashing. A bolt of azure thunder shot towards a specific point on the battlefield.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A giant wave surged from the water, a colossal figure leaping out, roaring skyward, unleashing a powerful punch.</p><p>The punch was awe-inspiring, seemingly capable of collapsing the void. But as the fist collided with the lightning, amidst the blinding radiance, the giant's body stiffened, exploding into pure spiritual energy.</p><p>The Azure Roc Dharma Idol unhesitatingly absorbed it, but Min Zhuo remained unseen.</p><p>Unfazed, Qin Sang, confident in his judgment, instantly detected a second similar aura and struck again.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Giants continued to emerge and be destroyed, each existing for only a fleeting moment before dissipating under the thunderous might, causing no harm to the Azure Roc Dharma Idol but instead becoming its 'sustenance'.</p><p>Min Zhuo desperately continued to hide, but the surrounding water droplets grew increasingly sparse.</p><p>The Azure Roc Dharma Idol's movement technique was incredibly swift, leaving Min Zhuo no chance to breathe. As another giant was annihilated, his true form was finally exposed.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A bolt of azure thunder tore through the void.</p><p>The water surface ahead suddenly caved inward, distorting. Min Zhuo, with nowhere to flee, was forced to reveal himself at the bottom of the water pit, instantly sensing impending doom.</p><p>During this time, the Azure Roc Dharma Idol had devoured a vast amount of Heavenly and Earthly Qi. The power dynamic had shifted, its attacks now even more formidable. Min Zhuo struggled, the alms bowl manifesting once more, shielding him. In the next instant, a sharp claw pressed down upon the bowl.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Min Zhuo paled, retreating in disarray. The alms bowl's light flickered as it was sent flying once more, this time truly flung away, plummeting straight into the abyss!</p><p>The azure thunder merely paused for an instant before appearing before Min Zhuo. Within the lightning, the outline of the Azure Roc Dharma Idol faintly materialized. Its wings erupted with a purer form of lightning, striking Min Zhuo with savage force.</p><p>A thunderclap echoed.</p><p>Min Zhuo was blasted away by the thunder, his armor shattering with a shriek of metal.</p><p>His opponent was also a Soul Formation expert, the leader of a clan, likely possessing other protective treasures. Qin Sang dared not be careless, nor would he grant his opponent even the slightest opportunity!</p><p>Lightning flashed as the Azure Roc Dharma Idol closed in on Min Zhuo once more. Min Zhuo could only barely defend himself, his injuries worsening with each relentless attack.</p><p>Finally, the Azure Roc Dharma Idol loomed over him, its claws like blades, aimed at his head.</p><p>Min Zhuo still hadn't given up, a violet glow emanating from his chest as if he was about to deploy another treasure.</p><p>Suddenly, Min Zhuo's entire body stiffened, his aura fading at an alarming rate. The violet glow flickered once more, then extinguished completely.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Changyou Clan's ancestral hall.</p><p>Min Shu's face was etched with terror.</p><p>The flames engulfing the wax figure grew fiercer, melted white wax coating the floor of the hall.</p><p>Finally, the wax figure's body burned to ashes!</p><p>"Father!"</p><p>Min Shu cried out, his body trembling with fear. He dared not imagine what the burning of the wax figure meant for his father and the Changyou Clan.</p><p>What was happening in the Defiled Lands?</p><p>…</p><p>The ancient texts spoke true; as the wax figure burned away, the injuries returned.</p><p>An overwhelming sense of weakness washed over Min Zhuo, new wounds compounding old, the old wounds doubled in their intensity, robbing him of almost all his strength.</p><p>He had never felt so weak, not even after his tribulation.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the change in Min Zhuo, surprised by his sudden loss of resistance.</p><p>Wary of any potential trickery, Qin Sang showed no mercy, only confirming Min Zhuo's true weakness when his claw pierced his skull.</p><p>Seeing Min Zhuo on the verge of death, the Azure Roc Dharma Idol's gaze sharpened, withdrawing some of its power at the last moment, sparing Min Zhuo's life.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Several lightning bolts materialized, transforming into thunder ropes that coiled around Min Zhuo's broken body, binding him tightly.</p><p>The power of thunder permeated his internal organs and bones, completely immobilizing him.</p><p>The residual energy on the battlefield dissipated, returning to tranquility.</p><p>The victor was clear!</p><p>Min Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, unsurprised to find himself still alive.</p><p>He was incredibly weak, barely clinging to life. Looking at the Azure Roc Dharma Idol, he croaked, "The greatest mistake of my life was to become the Real Master's enemy."</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive.</p><p>Having reached such a level of cultivation, everyone held firm beliefs. Given another chance, Min Zhuo might not change his decision.</p><p>"Is there anything else you wish to say?" Qin Sang asked indifferently.</p><p>Min Zhuo did not beg for mercy. He struggled to turn his eyes towards Mount Daiyu, a flicker of regret in his eyes. He sighed, "If the Real Master wishes to ask about this mountain, I have nothing to hide, for I know very little myself. I only know that this is an ancient immortal mountain, of great origin. As for how to claim it, or its unique properties, I know nothing!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. Min Zhuo seemed surprisingly candid, his words ringing true.</p><p>He could attempt soul searching, but such secret techniques were rarely effective against Soul Formation experts. At best, he might glean some fragmented memories, not necessarily what he sought.</p><p>After further interrogation, Min Zhuo remained truthful, revealing the contents of the ancient texts and his own deductions.</p><p>Unfortunately, it did not contain the information Qin Sang most desired: how to claim this mountain!</p><p>The earlier wait outside, followed by the battle with Min Zhuo, had significantly delayed him. The tide was rapidly approaching, leaving him little time.</p><p>After the interrogation, Qin Sang left Min Zhuo aside, intending to question him further later.</p><p>"Mount Daiyu, the mirage markets of Mount Yuanqiao..."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected such a connection to Mount Daiyu. Why had an ancient immortal mountain from the Great Thousand World fallen into the Storm Realm?</p><p>It was further proof of the Storm Realm's extraordinary nature!</p><p>Mount Daiyu's location was also peculiar, blocking the path to the Beacon Gate.</p><p>Could the Storm Realm's various peculiarities, aside from the Ziwei Palace, also be related to this mountain? The Otherfolk and the Storm Realm were linked by this immortal mountain.  Considering this, the Storm Realm's ascension to the Sea of Mists might not have been a coincidence!</p><p>He flew towards Mount Daiyu, circling it once. Aside from the fissures and the stone stele, he found nothing unusual.  Like Min Zhuo, he was filled with questions, unsure of what made this mountain so special.</p><p>Of course, claiming such a treasure was undoubtedly the right choice.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang attempted to approach the mountain, successfully landing on the stone platform and walking towards the stele.</p><p>This action triggered no reaction. Qin Sang raised a phoenix wing, gently placing it upon the stele, slowly closing his eyes.</p><p>His consciousness seeped into the stele. After several attempts, he finally grasped a wisp of energy.  It felt as if he had pushed open a door, entering a vast, empty space.</p><p>Suddenly, the space trembled, and Qin Sang's consciousness was expelled, his eyes snapping open, a flicker of excitement within them. Though unsuccessful, it confirmed his previous suspicion: the stele indeed held a hidden mystery!</p><p>Qin Sang gradually increased the force of his exploration, gradually discerning a pattern. The tremors of the stele's space were synchronized with the mountain. He could focus a sliver of his mind on the outside world, preparing in advance to prevent his consciousness from being expelled again.</p><p>As Qin Sang's exploration deepened, he discovered further changes. The tremors grew more frequent and intense.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Mount Daiyu trembled violently, azure light erupting from the fissures, each time ejecting at least a dozen strands of Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>The Changyou Clan experts outside were ecstatic. According to past patterns, the Azure Spirit Qi should have been diminishing, yet this time, it was erupting in abundance, already double the previous amount.</p><p>The Xuantian Palace experts were practically bleeding from their eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the outside world, focusing almost his entire consciousness on the stele's space.</p><p>Progress became increasingly difficult. He sensed he was nearing the end, yet the space remained empty. In truth, this was Qin Sang's own perception, based on conventional understanding, imagining it as a mysterious space. This space might not be a real, physical place.</p><p>Beyond this, he couldn't describe this existence with words. Perhaps it was an unprecedented power contained within the stele.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was assaulted by intense shocks, as if he were confronting an invisible will, desperately trying to repel him.</p><p>Could Mount Daiyu possess a will of its own?</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure. This was his own subjective experience.  He hadn't encountered even a wisp of true consciousness.</p><p>After enduring countless shocks, Qin Sang finally reached the end of the stele's space.</p><p>The tremors didn't cease, but Qin Sang's experience transformed completely.</p><p>Through the stele, he sensed the entirety of the mountain's existence!</p><p>The mountain's contours, the ancient restrictions within, the subtle energies, even every rock and every cliff face, were imprinted upon his mind, vividly and clearly!</p><p>Before, he had been clueless about how to approach Mount Daiyu. Now, he held the key, ready to attempt something.</p>
