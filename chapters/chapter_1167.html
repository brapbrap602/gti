<h1>Chapter 1159: Reversal</h1><p>Yi Tiannie, coveting the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid, led the Kuaiyin Sect to attack the Yuanzhao Sect. Unexpectedly, the Yuanzhao Sect's leader acted decisively, detonating his Golden Core, the sect's grand formation, and the spiritual veins, instantly dismantling the offensive and annihilating the Kuaiyin Sect in retaliation. After the great battle, with the support of the Wuji Sect, the Yuanzhao Sect took over the Kuaiyin Sect's territory. Since the Kuaiyin Sect had initiated the provocation and the Yuanzhao Sect was merely retaliating, the demonic factions found it difficult to intervene and tacitly accepted the outcome.</p><p>Traveling north through the Great Sui Dynasty stirred many memories for Qin Sang. Back then, he was just a minor figure in the cultivation world, someone a Foundation Establishment cultivator could crush with a finger. He had fled in chaos, living in constant fear. Now, he had become a figure revered as a sage and ancestor.</p><p>...</p><p>The former site of the Kuaiyin Sect, now the mountain gate of the Yuanzhao Sect. After taking over, the Yuanzhao Sect had sealed the yin energy of the Abyssal Yin Chasm with formations. Without the erosion of yin energy, the mountain's scenery had become lush and beautiful, completely transformed.</p><p>The shadow of war loomed over the cultivation world, and third-rate sects like the Yuanzhao Sect were particularly vulnerable, uncertain of their future. The sect's grand formation was always active, and they had to send disciples to the frontlines, leaving few experts at the mountain gate. Most of those remaining were newly recruited disciples.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect's leader, now advanced in years, stayed behind to oversee the sect. At the peak, before the leader's cave abode, a streak of light flew in and landed at the entrance. It was a young Foundation Establishment cultivator, who respectfully triggered the cave's restrictions and, after gaining permission, entered to meet the sect leader.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect leader, a mid-Golden Core cultivator, showed signs of aging, with white hair and beard. "Disciple pays respects to the Sect Leader!" The young man quickly bowed and presented a spirit talisman. "Sect Leader, these are the messages sent back by my master. He has followed your instructions and made contact with a senior from the Taiyi Alchemy Sect, receiving their care. My master and senior brothers have only been assigned patrol duties. The frontlines are relatively stable for now, and there is no immediate danger to their lives..."</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect leader took the jade slip, read it, and nodded. "Send a message to your master, telling him to return to the sect after some time. I will personally go to the frontlines."</p><p>Hearing this, the young man was shocked and urgently advised, "Sect Leader, the battlefield is so dangerous. How can you..."</p><p>"Hmph!" The sect leader interrupted him. "It is precisely because it is dangerous that I must go myself! I am already halfway into the underworld. Dying on the battlefield would be no great loss, and it might even bring an opportunity for the Yuanzhao Sect. You are the future hope of our sect! I sent your master out to gain experience. I sense that the Sin Abyss has been biding its time, preparing some scheme, and it is almost ready. It's time for your master to return..."</p><p>Before he could finish, a thunderous roar erupted outside, shaking the entire cave abode. The Yuanzhao Sect leader's eyes flashed with cold light as he immediately flew out of the cave, hovering in mid-air. Seeing the scene outside, he gasped in shock and horror.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect was in chaos. The sect's protective grand formation glowed with strange light, under attack from the outside, manifesting a seven-colored barrier to resist. Outside the barrier, a sea of sword lights shone brightly, forming an immense and majestic sword formation. The overwhelming aura, even through the grand formation, made the sect leader's heart race.</p><p>"Sword Momentum! A single sword forming a formation!" The Yuanzhao Sect leader exclaimed in shock, his eyes filled with terror. To comprehend Sword Momentum and form a sword formation with a single strike was a rarity even among Golden Core cultivators. The sheer scale of this attack, shaking the protective grand formation with a single strike, suggested that the attacker was likely a Nascent Soul Ancestor!</p><p>"Who is it?" The Yuanzhao Sect leader's expression shifted, unable to fathom which Nascent Soul cultivator would come to their door. After the Wuji Sect's incident, the Yuanzhao Sect had kept a low profile under his leadership and would never provoke a Nascent Soul Ancestor.</p><p>At that moment, the sword formation condensed another sword energy, which struck the protective grand formation with tremendous force. Amid the deafening roar, the barrier dimmed, its endurance uncertain.</p><p>Seeing this, the Yuanzhao Sect leader dared not wait any longer. Steeling himself, he flew to the barrier and called out, "Esteemed senior, if this humble one has been remiss in any way, I beg for your forgiveness!"</p><p>A moment later, a voice came from outside. "Are you the Yuanzhao Sect leader? Come out and speak."</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect leader's face paled, but he realized that if this Nascent Soul cultivator intended to kill him, there was no escape. Hiding behind the formation would only implicate his sect. With a sigh, he ordered all disciples to return to their caves, opened the protective grand formation, and stepped out.</p><p>The sword formation shimmered and retracted, revealing a cloaked figure. It was Qin Sang. The Ebony Sword was still refining the Soul-Nurturing Wood, so Qin Sang used a lower-grade spirit sword he had obtained earlier to form the sword formation, which still wielded considerable power.</p><p>"This humble one, Gu Zhi, pays respects to the esteemed senior! If any disciple of the Yuanzhao Sect has offended you, it is due to my lack of discipline. I am willing to pay any price to appease your anger."</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect leader made no mention of Qin Sang's attack on the protective formation, instead showing utmost respect.</p><p>"Offend? What makes you think you have the right to offend me?" Qin Sang snorted disdainfully. Although he had stolen the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid from the Yuanzhao Sect, he held no favorable impression of them. Using the Ascension Assembly as a pretext to supply blood sacrifices to secret grounds hardly seemed like the actions of a righteous sect.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect leader, clearly nearing the end of his lifespan, was likely the only Golden Core cultivator remaining after the upheaval years ago. Back then, Gu Zhi had been an unapproachable figure, someone Qin Sang could never hope to meet. Now, this man was groveling before him.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. He had no direct grievances with the Yuanzhao Sect and saw no point in bullying them. Cutting to the chase, he said, "I recall that this place originally belonged to the Kuaiyin Sect but is now occupied by the Yuanzhao Sect. Therefore, the Kuaiyin Sect's treasures must have fallen into your hands, correct?"</p><p>The Kuaiyin Ancestor had crafted ten demon banners, seven of which had been scattered. Even if the banners were destroyed, their poles must still exist. The Black Iron Pillar and the Demon-Binding Rope shared similar restrictions, suggesting they might also be artifacts designed to counter ancient demons.</p><p>The chaos caused by the ancient demon in the Seven Slaughter Palace, which had slaughtered Nascent Soul cultivators, still haunted Qin Sang. During the Sin Abyss's attack, a three-headed, six-armed demonic shadow had appeared. Who knew how many ancient demons still lurked in the cultivation world?</p><p>Once Qin Sang refined the demonic fire, the banner poles would become useless. Only by collecting all the poles could he attempt to repair the Black Iron Pillar. After Bai advanced to Corpse King, he would have the capacity to study the spirit formations that complemented the Demon-Binding Rope, and it was not impossible to create formations that worked with the Black Iron Pillar.</p><p>By then, Qin Sang would possess a treasure specifically designed to counter ancient demons. The Black Iron Pillar, even when divided into banner poles, could easily suppress the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, indicating that its power was formidable.</p>
