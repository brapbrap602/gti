<h1>Chapter 1467: External Avatar (4k, Combined)</h1><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Liuli said nothing.</p><p>The wooden door slammed shut.</p><p>Shi Xue’s body stiffened.  She sighed deeply, stopped, and turned to look at the closed wooden building, her expression a mixture of heartache and helplessness.  “That stubborn girl!”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the building, then down at the ice sword stuck in the ground, gradually understanding.</p><p>He held the *Divine Maiden Heart Sutra*, looking at Shi Xue wordlessly, feeling both amused and exasperated.</p><p>Despite not knowing the full story, his intelligence allowed him to guess the main points from Shi Xue giving him the *Divine Maiden Heart Sutra* and Liuli’s reaction.</p><p>Residual energy fluctuations remained within the building.</p><p>Clearly, Liuli had just attempted a breakthrough to the mid-Yuan Ying stage, but failed.  Since Shi Xue gave him the *Divine Maiden Heart Sutra*, Liuli’s failure was likely connected to him.</p><p>Or rather, trapped by the lingering mark of the *Mysterious Mother Jade Tripod Scripture*.</p><p>It seemed Dongyang Bo’s warning wasn’t exaggerated; the hidden dangers of this evil technique were incredibly troublesome.  Nearly three hundred years had passed, and Liuli still couldn’t break free from the mark.</p><p>No wonder Liuli, despite her exceptional spiritual root, remained stuck at the early Yuan Ying stage, even surpassed by him.</p><p>Since their reunion, Liuli had acted normally around him. Qin Sang assumed that a powerful sect like Xuan Tian Palace would possess some secret technique or treasure to help her solve the problem.</p><p>He even thought that outcome would be good, a way to sever that karmic tie.</p><p>It was all just an appearance.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered Dongyang Bo mentioning in the bronze hall of Ziwei Palace that Liuli had been suffering the backlash of the evil technique from the beginning, using silver needles to suppress the influence of the emotional imprint.</p><p>She was probably using a similar method now, sealing the emotional imprint.</p><p>Unfortunately, they underestimated the power of this evil technique’s hidden dangers.  Precisely at the moment of breakthrough, the technique failed, the imprint erupted, leading to failure.</p><p>Remembering Liuli’s intense expression earlier, Qin Sang sighed softly.</p><p>That heart-wrenching emotion was terrifying.  Tragically, it wasn’t real, not from her heart, but from the evil technique’s imprint.</p><p>And Liuli clearly knew this, stubbornly maintaining her resolve, refusing to succumb.</p><p>“Master Shi…”</p><p>Qin Sang walked to Shi Xue, returning the jade slip.  He didn’t know what to say. “You… really overthink things.”</p><p>He’d noticed Shi Xue’s odd behavior recently; she'd been preoccupied with this.</p><p>Shi Xue probably didn’t understand the nature of the “Yin and Yang cultivation” technique. If she had consulted Qin Sang beforehand, he would have definitely advised her against it, to avoid wasted effort. Regardless of his stance, Liuli would never agree.</p><p>Indeed, Liuli resolutely sealed herself in the building, preferring to abandon this breakthrough opportunity rather than consider dual cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t surprised at all.</p><p>Liuli was a celestial maiden, completely different from him.</p><p>Such a proud person!</p><p>Back then, she cultivated the evil technique to save Shi Xue, not for herself.</p><p>Now, to improve her cultivation, submitting to the imprint, allowing the evil technique to manipulate her into becoming Dao companions with someone she barely knew, even under the guise of dual cultivation, was simply impossible.</p><p>Call her stubborn or headstrong.</p><p>She wouldn’t numb herself, accepting such a false emotion.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli hadn't interacted much, yet he understood her clearly through her actions. If Liuli could accept the *Divine Maiden Heart Sutra*, it wouldn't be her.</p><p>“Fairy Liuli is blessed by heaven; there must be a solution. We just need to trust her and avoid unnecessary worry.”</p><p>Qin Sang treated it as a farce, shook his head, and disappeared from the valley, attending to his own matters.</p><p>Shi Xue watched Qin Sang leave, her gaze shifting, quickly approaching the wooden building, revealing hesitation.  Finally, she didn’t open the door, but remained outside.</p><p>“That heartless man has a point; I am indeed overthinking. With my junior sister’s intelligence, knowing the hidden dangers of the ice-soul sealing technique, she must have considered failure. But aside from the *Divine Maiden Heart Sutra*’s emotional cultivation path, what other method could she use to break through before the next calamity?”</p><p>Shi Xue pondered for a long time, sighing inwardly.  “Sigh! Junior Sister, that heartless man understands you better than I do. Why won’t you accept him?”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang left the Listening Snow Tower and headed northeast.</p><p>Leaving no trace in the snow, he flew for a while before seeing a vast expanse of snowy mountains, returning to this place.</p><p>The underground Yin vein Shi Xue mentioned was at the foot of the snow mountains.</p><p>Entering the snowy mountains, Qin Sang sensed a faint chill, his gaze sweeping downward.  He pierced through the snow, discovering several entrances to subterranean caves, the source of the chilling aura.</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>A hole opened in the snow, and Qin Sang entered the cave.</p><p>The underground caves were interconnected and incredibly complex.</p><p>He summoned the Jin Chen sword for protection and delved deeper, continuing his search.</p><p>As Shi Xue had said, there was indeed an underground yin vein here, but its strength fluctuated.  In some places, the chilling aura was thin; in others, it was extremely concentrated, like scattered pools of stagnant yin energy distributed throughout the caves.</p><p>The first step of the *Nine Nether Yin Return* technique requires the use of an underground yin vein, taking eighty-one days to refine the spirit body.</p><p>This step differs from corpse refinement; it doesn't involve completely transforming the physical body with yin energy. Instead, it uses the power of the underground yin vein for slight modification. The true purpose isn't to acquire yin, but rather coldness, making it easier to refine cold objects later, increasing the success rate of the next step.  Finally, the yin energy is expelled from the body.</p><p>Therefore, the requirements for the underground yin vein are high; the yin energy cannot be too strong, nor too weak.</p><p>Qin Sang had searched the caves for a long time, spending another full day before selecting three locations, ultimately choosing one.</p><p>This place was a subterranean cavern, with smooth, mirror-like walls and an unfathomable depth.</p><p>Qin Sang used his sword to carve out a stone platform, sat cross-legged, and summoned his Yuan Ying spirit puppet.</p><p>The process of refining an external body using the Yuan Ying spirit puppet is crucial.  It affects not only whether the Evolution Tree can refine the spirit body, but also how the puppet seals and soul shadows within the puppet are refined and utilized by the external body.</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet differs somewhat from the spirit body required by *Nine Nether Yin Return*. Qin Sang might need to slightly modify the technique, incorporating the soul shadow refinement secret art Bai had given him.</p><p>Fortunately, the modification won't be extensive, leaving the fundamental secret art unchanged, so the chances of success are high, but extreme caution is necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Yuan Ying spirit puppet to sit opposite him, recalling yesterday's dramatic events with a lingering sense of absurdity.  Shi Xue, true to her position as the Sect Leader, had certainly worried a great deal.</p><p>Dismissing these thoughts, Qin Sang connected his mind with the puppet and fell into deep contemplation.</p><p>The cave fell silent.</p><p>…</p><p>He sat there for two months.</p><p>In two months, Qin Sang had thoroughly comprehended the *Nine Nether Yin Return Jade Chapter*.</p><p>Liuli had previously exaggerated when she said that death of the main body would allow immediate resurrection in the external body.  It's necessary to perform the main body and external body transformation secret technique from the *Nine Nether Yin Return Jade Chapter* before imminent death to achieve this.</p><p>Instant death before the secret technique is complete prevents resurrection.</p><p>However, the North Sea cultivation world likely lacks cultivators powerful enough to prevent him from completing the transformation secret technique. For Qin Sang, this is a genuine opportunity for resurrection.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang was very focused on the *Nine Nether Yin Return Jade Chapter*.</p><p>He mentally rehearsed countless times, confirming several things:</p><p>First, the puppet seal power within the Yuan Ying spirit puppet cannot be preserved. He must first erase the seal and restore the original Evolution Tree; otherwise, there will be conflict with the spirit body.</p><p>This is a great pity; if he could have refined the puppet seal power, the external body would have at least the power of a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator upon completion.</p><p>However, to reduce conflict and increase the chances of success, this is unavoidable.</p><p>Second, there's good news.</p><p>The external body can be controlled by the main body, similar to a puppet. The downside is its rigidity and inability to be used for resurrection, so it’s generally not considered. The orthodox method involves splitting off a second Nascent Soul to control it, granting more autonomy and expanding its capabilities.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul is split from the main Nascent Soul. Unlike the second Nascent Souls created through the bloody methods of the demonic path, unless the main body grants it complete autonomy or it becomes detached due to special circumstances, there's no need to worry about the second Nascent Soul rebelling.</p><p>This has advantages and disadvantages. When the external body is created, its cultivation level will be one level lower than the main body, requiring subsequent cultivation to improve it.</p><p>Qin Sang considered refining a second Nascent Soul, and then using the secret art Bai had given him to refine the soul shadows within the Yuan Ying spirit puppet to strengthen the second Nascent Soul.</p><p>Bai had suggested he cultivate the orthodox Xuanmen external body method with this in mind.</p><p>While the soul shadows within the Yuan Ying spirit puppet are only fragments, they are numerous, and previously untransformable into combat power. If all are refined, along with a wondrous object like the Ice Soul Divine Gang, the external body’s power might increase rather than decrease, providing a shortcut.</p><p>These soul shadows lack consciousness; his split Nascent Soul contains some Jade Buddha power, so there’s no need to worry about the second Nascent Soul absorbing too many disparate soul shadow powers and increasing the risk of backlash.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts gradually cleared, and he emerged from meditation.</p><p>His gaze shifted from the Yuan Ying spirit puppet to the underground yin vein, then back, his mind sinking into his Purple Mansion.</p><p>Inside his inner world, Qin Sang's spirit body, cloaked in yin-yang armor, concealed its golden light.  He had previously split his spirit body when refining corpses and puppets, creating soul imprints.  This time was different; he intended to separate a significant portion to create a second spirit body!</p><p>Recalling the excruciating pain of previous divisions, Qin Sang twitched his lips, entered a meditative state, removed the yin-yang armor, revealing his true form.</p><p>After an indeterminate time, Qin Sang's brow furrowed sharply, a fleeting expression of pain crossing his face. The agony of splitting his spirit body was deeply etched in his memory, causing even his strong resolve to waver.</p><p>A new golden light appeared in his inner world, far dimmer than his original spirit body.  Without hesitation, Qin Sang activated a secret technique.</p><p>As time passed, the golden light pulsed and shifted, gradually taking on his form. The second spirit body began to take shape!</p><p>The next moment, a golden light flashed from Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The golden light entered the spirit puppet. Instantly, the soul within the puppet showed signs of unrest, attempting to absorb the still-weak second spirit body.</p><p>Enduring the pain, Qin Sang rapidly changed his hand seals, employing Bai Chuan's soul-subduing technique.  The second spirit body penetrated the soul's core, remaining still, emitting a special aura that gradually calmed the soul.</p><p>Refining the soul would take a long time, a process that couldn't be rushed.  Qin Sang first used the second spirit body to subdue the soul, then proceeded to erase the puppet's control seal and restore the Yandao Tree.</p><p>He confirmed everything was secure. Qin Sang pointed a finger, causing the puppet's control seal to shimmer.  As he moved, the seals shattered, releasing their energy. The puppet's power diminished sharply, and the woody nature of its essence became increasingly apparent.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the powerful puppet dissipate, showing no regret. His movements quickened until the last control seal vanished. The spirit puppet disappeared, leaving a small, delicate tree in Qin Sang's palm, confirming its true nature as a divine root. Except for slightly rough bark, it resembled a baby, complete with features. Who could imagine a divine tree could be so naturally formed, almost human!</p><p>Next, Qin Sang planted the Yandao Tree in the underground Yin vein.  The tree sank and floated. Qin Sang repeatedly used hand seals, guiding the tree to absorb the Yin energy to forge its physical body. This was a crucial step, second only to refining the Ice Soul Divine Energy, and Qin Sang didn't dare slacken.</p><p>The Yandao Tree was contaminated, but being a divine root, it readily absorbed the Yin energy. Qin Sang's worries were unfounded.  The entire process would last eighty-one days. After completing the hand seals, the tree could refine itself without constant supervision.</p><p>Seeing everything proceed smoothly, Qin Sang calmed himself and took medicine to heal his spirit body.  With nothing else to do, he stayed, studying the *Seven Master Buddha Seal*.</p><p>However, a minor unexpected delay occurred.  Instead of eighty-one days, Qin Sang waited for over half a year before the physical body was completed.  The excessive time made him uneasy, but aware of the Yandao Tree's unique nature, he patiently waited, until finally, the day arrived.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Yandao Tree flew into Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed a faint cold light on the tree. After careful observation, Qin Sang felt there were no problems and retrieved the Ice Soul Pouch from his storage ring.</p><p>Opening the pouch, a chilling aura washed over him, imbued with terrifying power.  Qin Sang was familiar with the Qiantian Divine Energy, remaining calm as he looked inside.</p><p>The ice soul divine energy, unlike the Qingyang Divine Energy, was transparent like ice, outwardly resembling an ordinary ice cube.  Being Qiantian Divine Energy, an extremely Yang essence, it possessed extreme Yin characteristics – a unique anomaly.</p><p>Fortunately, the Yin energy within the Yandao Tree had been expelled after the initial formation of the physical body, preventing any conflict.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang took a piece of Ice Soul Divine Energy, carefully avoiding direct contact. He enveloped it with true energy, then used Liuli's secret technique to refine it.</p><p>Gradually, the energy reformed into pure Ice Soul Divine Energy, the cold intensifying to the point that the surrounding Yin energy seemed to freeze.  Guided by Qin Sang, a strand of this energy entered the Yandao Tree.</p><p>Instantly, the Yandao Tree's coldness increased, its body becoming somewhat transparent, easily absorbing the Ice Soul Divine Energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned surprised. His understanding of the Yandao Tree deepened, and without hesitation, he quickly refined and channeled more Ice Soul Divine Energy into the tree.</p><p>The physical body was complete, the Ice Soul Divine Energy forming its foundation.</p><p>At this point, the creation of the external body was essentially complete!</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, surprised by the smooth process.  He thought to himself, it was certainly a divine root after all.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang directed the second spirit body within the Yandao Tree, merging it completely with the physical body at the moment of its foundation's completion, forming one inseparable entity.</p><p>The external body was finally complete!</p>
