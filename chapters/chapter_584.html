<h1>Chapter 577: The Ancient Medicinal Garden</h1><p>Chapter 577: The Ancient Medicinal Garden</p><p>The two walked and talked, discussing not only their own affairs but also analyzing the situation among the Three Realms.  After the shattering of the Zu Yuan conspiracy, the advantage clearly lay with Xiao Han Realm and the Tian Xing Alliance.  Their combined strength rendered Zu Yuan insignificant; there was no need for alarm.  Their role in exposing the leader of the Wuji Sect earned them the gratitude of even the Yuan Ying cultivators of the Tian Xing Alliance, promising a bright future.</p><p>The Ancient Medicinal Garden was not far from the Immortal City.  The two traversed mountains and valleys, arriving at the garden without much delay.  No wonder it was called a wondrous place.</p><p>The scene before them was completely unlike their surroundings; calling it a fairyland would be no exaggeration.  Fairy clouds drifted like colorful clouds, interspersed with five-colored lights, and rainbows arched across the sky.  The most beautiful celestial phenomena imaginable were gathered here.</p><p>The landscape was even more captivating: towering peaks, verdant mountains, and countless large and small lakes, clear and pure, like the purest eyes on earth.  Countless beams of light, some like pillars, some like canopies, emanated from the mountains and waters – unmistakable signs of the presence of heavenly treasures, divine herbs, and immortal plants.  These phenomena were numerous, densely packed, suggesting someone had once cultivated this place as a medicinal garden, collecting countless spiritual herbs from the world, a sight that was overwhelming.</p><p>Beneath some of these phenomena, one could vaguely see the actual herbs, most of which Qin Sang didn't recognize.  Even more astonishing was the presence of countless celestial birds and divine beasts, including cranes, phoenixes, qilin, and Azure Dragons, along with many ancient mythical beasts only found in legends.  These ferocious beasts, each a powerful enough to rule a region, lived together peacefully. Some slumbered, others drank by the lakeside, others soared among the fairy clouds – a scene of perfect harmony.</p><p>They… seemed to be the guardian spirits of the garden!</p><p>Heavenly treasures were plentiful; dragons, phoenixes, and qilin served as guardians, and ancient mythical beasts as mounts.  Everything perfectly matched cultivators' fantasies of immortals.</p><p>The Ancient Medicinal Garden was vast, but its edges were clearly abrupt and jagged, suggesting it was only a remnant of a larger whole.</p><p>Qin Sang was awestruck. What kind of powerful cultivator had been the master of this place, collecting so many rare spiritual herbs and even commanding great beasts to guard it?</p><p>"These are illusions created by the garden's ancient restrictions," Yun Youzi explained. "Inside, like the Immortal City, most places are ruins. Finding even a single spiritual herb requires exceptional luck.  Any herb from the Ancient Medicinal Garden is at least a heavenly treasure, extremely rare. Major sects in Xiao Han Realm possess such treasures, most originating from this place."</p><p>"Over time, the weaker points of the garden's restrictions have been explored thoroughly," he continued.  "Even some very well-hidden herbs have been discovered. Some, like the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, wither if transplanted; they can only remain here, treasured by their discoverers."</p><p>Yun Youzi pointed ahead, urging Qin Sang not to be misled by the illusionary fairyland, lest it disrupt his Dao heart.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded subconsciously.  He understood these were illusions.  Since entering the Ziwei Palace, he had seen no living creatures, and this place would be no different.</p><p>However, the illusions were incredibly realistic, as if a similar scene had truly existed in ancient times. Even knowing it was false, one couldn't help but be captivated, lost in endless reverie.</p><p>Standing at the edge of the garden, they sensed dangerous energy fluctuations and dared not approach the fairyland, for fear of being consumed by the ancient restrictions.</p><p>The garden was vast. They carefully walked along the boundary, watching their surroundings, prepared to avoid any other cultivators they might encounter.</p><p>After a while, Yun Youzi located the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and found an entrance.  He stood before the restriction, eyes closed, extending a hand, his palm clasping the flawless pearl.</p><p>The pearl shone, emitting white light, seemingly attempting to crack the restriction.</p><p>After a moment, Yun Youzi opened his eyes, stepped back, and said to Qin Sang, "Qin Laodi, summon your Flying Night Rakshasa. With it to clear the way, I can focus on breaking the restriction, and we'll be much faster."</p><p>Qin Sang readily complied, patting his corpse puppet bag, and a dark shadow flew out.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa reappeared.  Its wounds were completely healed, its green face and fangs, along with the pervasive corpse energy, making it look like a vicious ghost. Its dark eyes seemed even more sinister than before, brighter and more eerie.</p><p>At Qin Sang's command, the Flying Night Rakshasa flashed to the ancient restriction, its speed still astonishing.</p><p>Yun Youzi carefully examined the Flying Night Rakshasa, praising, "This corpse's power is no less than the one in the ice cave.  My friend must have expended considerable effort."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded somberly, recalling the difficulties in creating the Flying Night Rakshasa.  The process was fraught with peril, nearly failing several times and almost resulting in complete ruin.</p><p>With the Flying Night Rakshasa leading, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi followed, forming a triangular formation. Qin Sang controlled the Rakshasa while Yun Youzi worked to break the ancient restrictions.</p><p>Their strategy set, they proceeded accordingly.</p><p>Yun Youzi formed a sharp energy spike in his palm and hurled it at the ancient medicinal garden.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Where the spike struck, the illusion shattered like a mirror.</p><p>The hidden reality within was revealed: a gloomy, desolate scene – withered plants, a dry riverbed, fractured mountains, devoid of life.</p><p>Warned by Yun Youzi, Qin Sang immediately urged the Flying Night Rakshasa forward the instant the illusion broke, with him and Yun Youzi close behind.</p><p>As they entered the garden, a tiger's roar echoed ahead.  Looking up, a winged tiger plunged from the sky.</p><p>A pungent stench hit them.  Its sharp fangs seemed to still bear the remnants of torn flesh.  The monstrous tiger exuded a fierce aura, its eyes blazing with killing intent.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen an identical tiger in the outer illusion; then, it was docile, sleeping amidst the grass, with several nine-colored deer playing nearby.</p><p>Now, before them, the tiger's presence—its imposing aura and smell—was flawlessly realistic. Without prior knowledge of its illusory nature, one would easily mistake it for a genuine, terrifying demon.</p><p>The tiger roared deafeningly.</p><p>With a powerful flap of its wings, it created a gust of wind and vanished.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Following a loud crash, two figures, one large and one small, were sent flying back.</p><p>Though fast, the tiger was no match for the swift Flying Night Rakshasa, which intercepted it.</p><p>The Rakshasa steadied itself, while the tiger tumbled several times, roaring in frustrated rage.</p><p>The difference between the power of the illusion and that of a true demon was vast.  This tiger was all show, ultimately weak and no match for the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p>
