<h1>Chapter 1545: Xie Family Ancestor</h1><p>The fat silkworm, having advanced to the fourth stage—equivalent to a Yuan Ying cultivator—hadn't apparently developed any new abilities beyond its anti-venom capabilities.  Qin Sang had expected at least some poison-deflecting combat skills.  Something like the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's Heavenly Eye beam would have been useful in a fight.  Instead, the fat silkworm was only effective in specific environments like the three poisonous lands of the Seven Killing Hall, or against opponents using poison, like the frog fish.</p><p>How could such a spirit insect possibly survive in the harsh world of cultivation?</p><p>Forced by Qin Sang, the fat silkworm spat out several balls of iridescent light, then lay exhausted, tongue lolling, eyes glazed over, only managing to thicken its anti-venom armor.  Qin Sang gave up and turned to check on Ya Gu.</p><p>A single glance told Qin Sang that Ya Gu was different.  The change wasn't outwardly visible.  She remained as before: rosy cheeks, eyes closed, breathing evenly—a sleeping beauty. The change was in her spirit. Qin Sang could clearly sense her spirit had become more stable.  This was clearly connected to the fat silkworm's advancement. The 'anchor' was stronger, and even facing the storms raging in the darkness, Ya Gu could cling tightly to the rope connecting her to the light.  Perhaps there were other factors Qin Sang didn't understand. The connection between Ya Gu and the fat silkworm was far closer than he'd imagined.</p><p>Although Ya Gu couldn't respond, her condition had significantly improved.  If not for the incident at the Seven Killing Hall, she would likely be even better, perhaps even awake.  At least there was hope.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed the fat silkworm's head. Even if it had no abilities, saving Ya Gu would make raising it worthwhile.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Finally free, the fat silkworm eagerly burrowed into Ya Gu's forehead and promptly fell asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang remained where he was, not hurrying to leave. He hadn't moved far from the tribulation site, intending to wait and see if any cultivators were alerted by the tribulation and came to investigate. The silkworm's tribulation had been unexpected and rushed, making it hard to avoid attention.  A fourth-stage spirit insect was incredibly rare in the cultivation world.  News of it would likely attract Yuan Ying cultivators hunting for it, or even the attention of major sects.</p><p>Qin Sang's prediction proved correct.  Soon, two figures approached from the distance—an old man and a younger man, looking like a grandfather and grandson, though both were strong cultivators.  The younger man was the stronger, a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator, the older one slightly weaker.</p><p>“Just like that, I've attracted two Golden Core cultivators.  The influence of the Fuyu County's sects is not insignificant…” Qin Sang observed their movements, thinking to himself.</p><p>The two flew directly towards the tribulation site.  Though the tribulation clouds had dispersed, the aura of the Heavenly Tribulation hadn't completely faded, and Qin Sang couldn't erase it entirely.</p><p>The pair, experienced cultivators, sensed the aura before they got close, instantly recognizing it.</p><p>"Heavenly Tribulation!"  They cried out in unison, exchanging shocked glances.  They had been busy with something else and hadn't witnessed the tribulation firsthand.  They had only sensed the unusual energy fluctuations and decided to investigate, never expecting to find someone undergoing a tribulation.</p><p>Only Yuan Ying cultivators could trigger a Heavenly Tribulation; this was common knowledge.  Both felt a chill down their spines, regretting their rashness, and instinctively wanted to flee.</p><p>However, they had already seen the site of the tribulation.  Everything was charred, the mountaintop almost leveled by the tribulation thunder, the entire mountain a mess—a combination of the tribulation's power and Qin Sang's handiwork.  The destruction was evident, but there was no sign of the cultivator who had undergone the tribulation.  Considering the relatively short duration of the thunder, they thought the mysterious Yuan Ying cultivator might have failed.</p><p>Exchanging glances, they couldn't resist the temptation and approached cautiously, searching thoroughly but found no Yuan Ying artifacts, leaving them disappointed.</p><p>"Let's quickly report this to Master," the younger cultivator said, "We don't know which Yuan Ying senior passed through and underwent a tribulation here.  Let's have the sect report it to the Six Virtual Gate, maybe they can find clues."</p><p>The elder stroked his goatee, agreeing, "That's right.  Regardless of the senior's identity, it's none of our concern.  It's a pity though, not a single thing left after the Heavenly Tribulation!"</p><p>"That senior may not have failed. Have you ever seen a true Heavenly Tribulation?" The younger cultivator shook his head, sealing the area around the mountain peak with a formation before summoning the elder, then flew away.</p><p>Qin Sang stood not far from them.</p><p>The two men were completely unaware that their conversation was overheard.  </p><p>Certain that they hadn't actually seen the silver tribulation lightning, and believing it to be a cultivator's ascension tribulation, Qin Sang decided against interfering, letting them leave.</p><p>News of a Yuan Ying tribulation disrupting the situation in Fudou County wasn't necessarily a bad thing; it wouldn't get out of hand.</p><p>"Liu Xu Sect..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, his figure flickering before disappearing.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang returned to Fudou County, selecting a refined residence at the Six States Hall to await Zhou Jin's arrival.</p><p>Two months later.</p><p>Zhou Jin arrived as promised.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Zhou Jin was overjoyed, bowing deeply.  "Greetings, Senior Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I didn't expect to be gone for nearly ten years. You've stayed in Fudou County all this time. Have you discovered anything?"</p><p>Zhou Jin, worried about Ruan Yu's illness, had been anxious for ten years without word from Qin Sang, fearing the senior had met with an accident or forgotten the matter.  He'd been constantly worried, yet dared not slacken his efforts.</p><p>Fortunately, his worst fears hadn't come to pass.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement, Zhou Jin spoke rapidly. "Junior has followed Senior's instructions. After leaving Zezhou that year, I came to this area to investigate the Pu Mountain and Xie family matters..."</p><p>Pu Mountain, the Xie family.</p><p>Connected to the superior Daoist site recorded by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>The Daoist site, Qingxu Illusionary Realm, was located on Pu Mountain.</p><p>The Xie family, once boasting two Yuan Ying cultivators, held a prominent position even in the cultivator-rich Central State. Qingxu Illusionary Realm was extremely secluded, always controlled by the Xie family, and unknown to outsiders.</p><p>Qingxu Illusionary Realm could serve as a secluded residence, but also held other secrets.</p><p>Generations of Xie family descendants had painstakingly researched it, yet couldn't unlock its secrets until one of their Yuan Ying cultivators met Xiao Xiangzi.  Impressed by his abilities, they invited him into Qingxu Illusionary Realm, finally solving the mystery.</p><p>The jade slip didn't detail what the three gained within Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>Ironically, while sharing the treasure after unlocking the secret, the Xie family patriarch, seeing a chance for greater gain, attempted to kill Xiao Xiangzi and keep the treasure for himself.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi certainly hadn't yet reached the Nascent Soul stage at that point; otherwise, the Xie family patriarch wouldn't have dared to do that.</p><p>Even so, both Xie family Yuan Ying cultivators were killed by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't exterminate the entire Xie family.  Enraged, however, he didn't intend to let them off easily.  He personally sealed Qingxu Illusionary Realm, preventing future Xie family members from entering.</p><p>Cooperation and betrayal were constant occurrences in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsurprised.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi didn't feel his actions were wrong.</p><p>This betrayal ignited Xiao Xiangzi's murderous intent, nearly leading him to massacre the Xie family, pushing him to the brink of demonic possession.  It was this event that jolted him awake, making him aware of his inner demons.</p><p>His subsequent travels and the refining of the Spirit-Subduing Incense allowed him to resolve this hidden danger, eventually enabling his ascension to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Later, reflecting on his path, he realized the other Xie family Yuan Ying cultivator hadn't initially intended to betray him; he was forced into it by the Xie family patriarch.</p><p>Since the other cultivator chose to attack him, regardless of sincerity, Xiao Xiangzi couldn't afford to show mercy.</p><p>However, his anger from the betrayal subsided considerably.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi recorded this event, hoping whoever obtained the jade slip would journey to the Central State, find the Xie family, and if the restriction on Qingxu Illusionary Realm remained, open it and return it to them, settling this grudge.</p><p>Qin Sang sent Zhou Jin to search for the Xie family.</p><p>Firstly, to fulfill Xiao Xiangzi's request; secondly, he could also cultivate in Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>Times change, places change name, and powers rise and fall.  Just like the destroyed cave dwelling in Sky-Splitting Valley and the renamed Zhu Lan Temple, even if the Xie family no longer existed, and Qingxu Illusionary Realm had a new owner, Qin Sang wouldn't be surprised.</p><p>"After arriving, I traveled throughout Fudou County and the three surrounding counties, but couldn't find Pu Mountain. Later, I learned that after Zhuozhou was incorporated into the Nineteen States of Yan Yu,  Mount Unnamed had overseen a large-scale geomantic survey, redrawing the boundaries of Zhuozhou, changing many place names. I then sought out ancient texts..."</p><p>Zhou Jin's tone was bright, indicating a discovery.  "Three years ago, I finally found 'Pu Mountain' in an ancient text. After much verification, I confirmed that Pu Mountain was within Fudou County, the current Luo Yan Mountain! However, Luo Yan Mountain is no longer owned by the Xie family, but by the Luo Yan Sect."</p><p>"Luo Yan Gate?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred.  "Do the cultivators of this sect wear jade pendants engraved with the character 'Luo' around their waists?"</p><p>The two people drawn by the Fat Silkworm Heavenly Tribulation were wearing such pendants.</p><p>Pu Mountain had indeed changed hands, but it was unknown whether Luo Yan Gate had discovered the Qingxu Illusory Realm.</p><p>"Senior has met disciples of Luo Yan Gate?"</p><p>Zhou Jin nodded. "Luo Yan Gate has many masters. I dared not act openly, so I could only secretly investigate the relationship between Luo Yan Gate and the Xie family.  Later, I discovered that Luo Yan Mountain was originally seized from the Xie family by Luo Yan Gate, and the Xie family was forced to leave Pu Mountain, their family already in decline."</p><p>The deaths of two Yuan Ying Grandmasters, the loss of the Qingxu Illusory Realm, and the Xie family losing its foundation for prosperity led to their downfall from a position of great power.</p><p>Their survival to the present day, with their bloodline unbroken, was exceptionally difficult, and only possible thanks to the stable situation in Central China.</p><p>Upon learning the Xie family's whereabouts, Zhou Jin immediately found them.</p><p>Now, the Xie family has become an ordinary cultivation family, their current clan head only at the Foundation Establishment stage.  The Pu Mountain where their ancestral lands are located was seized, its name changed, and they dared not utter a word of protest.</p><p>"I deliberately approached the Xie family and learned something," Zhou Jin paused.  "When the Xie family yielded Pu Mountain, they made a deal with Luo Yan Gate.  Now, long past the agreed-upon time, Luo Yan Gate shows no intention of returning it. Senior, if you wish to help the Xie family reclaim Pu Mountain, you can start here."</p><p>Zhou Jin mistakenly believes Qin Sang is a lost member of the Xie family, returned to their ancestral land to seek justice.</p><p>"Luo Yan Gate is very powerful?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>From Zhou Jin's tone, it seemed he couldn't force Luo Yan Gate to return Pu Mountain to the Xie family through sheer cultivation strength.</p><p>Zhou Jin respectfully said, "The Luo Yan Gate sect leader is only at the late Golden Core stage; Senior could easily eliminate them. However, there's something else to be wary of: Luo Yan Gate is backed by Liu Xu Gate. The deal between Luo Yan Gate and the Xie family was witnessed by someone sent by Liu Xu Gate. I've been investigating their connections and discovered the Luo Yan Gate sect leader has a close relationship with Liu Xu Gate. Liu Xu Gate has three Yuan Ying elders; they are a powerful force, the overlords of the surrounding prefectures. Even the Bu Nian Mountains can hardly interfere, and the prefect of Fudu Prefecture can't control anything outside the city."</p><p>Zhou Jin had diligently investigated, even uncovering the difficulties Qin Sang would face.</p><p>"Well done."</p><p>Qin Sang was quite pleased with Zhou Jin and, keeping his promise, took out the jade slip recording the medicinal formula and a jade box.</p><p>Zhou Jin was overjoyed, quickly reaching out to take them. Opening the jade box, he saw a spirit herb inside and looked up in astonishment.</p><p>"This Wu Jing Grass is the main ingredient in the formula. I unexpectedly discovered it in the Western Desert. This herb is extremely valuable. If you were to search for it yourself, it would take at least ten years, possibly delaying treatment."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, looking at Zhou Jin. "My hands are short of personnel. If you are willing, you can bring Ruan Yu to Pu Mountain to cultivate upon your return."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Zhou Jin knelt and kowtowed, expressing his heartfelt gratitude.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang questioned Zhou Jin thoroughly about the details, pondering his next plan.</p><p>If it were only Luo Yan Gate, he could simply go there and drive them down the mountain, keeping the impact minimal. Now that Liu Xu Gate is involved, he needs to plan carefully.</p><p>Of Liu Xu Gate's three Yuan Ying cultivators, only one was at the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Attacking with his clone would be swift, but the subsequent repercussions need to be considered.</p><p>In the Central Plains, regardless of cultivation level, one cannot act recklessly.</p><p>Furthermore, it's unclear if the Qingxu Illusory Realm has been exposed. If a Daoist site dispute is involved, it would be even more troublesome.</p><p>After considering this,</p><p>Qin Sang ordered Zhou Jin to take him to the Xie family first.</p><p>…</p><p>The Xie family, driven from Pu Mountain by Luo Yan Gate, lacked the strength to claim better spirit veins and settled for a poor one.</p><p>As a result, the Xie family declined even faster, almost exhausting their previous accumulated resources.  Even their clan head hasn't broken through to the Golden Core stage, stuck at the False Core realm.</p><p>However, thanks to their prior foundation, the Xie family's protective mountain array was still powerful.</p><p>"Clan Head Xie, a friend has come to visit."</p><p>Arriving at the Xie family's stronghold, Zhou Jin channeled his true energy and shouted.</p><p>The sound reached the Xie family.</p><p>Soon, the mist parted to the sides, and a figure emerged—Xie An, the Xie family's head, his demeanor quite imposing.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhou, what a rare guest," Xie An quickly approached, his attitude extremely enthusiastic. Seeing Qin Sang beside Zhou Jin, he couldn't sense their cultivation and was startled. "This Daoist friend is...?"</p><p>Zhou Jin coughed and said, "This is Senior Qin."</p><p>"Senior!"</p><p>Xie An was stunned.</p><p>Zhou Jin is a Golden Core cultivator; the senior he spoke of could only be…</p>
