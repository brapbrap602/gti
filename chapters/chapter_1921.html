<h1>Chapter 1912: Spearing Fish</h1><p>Such a master, if they hailed from Cloud Metropolis Heaven, it wouldn't be surprising at all.</p><p>Cloud Metropolis Heaven's purging of the demonic creatures must have a deeper meaning. The Fire Region needs to prepare in advance and discern Cloud Metropolis Heaven's intentions.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Fu is overthinking it.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't turn his head, gradually walking further and further away.</p><p>Fu Xiao gazed at the receding figure, hesitation evident on his face, but ultimately didn't choose to pursue him.</p><p>……</p><p>Not long after, the cultivators belatedly realized that the once rampant Sand Bandits had suddenly vanished without a trace.</p><p>As survivors were discovered, and various news spread, the story of the Sand Bandits' complete eradication gradually circulated throughout the desert and even the Fire Region.</p><p>Some curious individuals, emboldened, explored the three mountain bandit strongholds, and saw corpses strewn across the ground, and mountain walls smeared with blood-written confessions of their crimes.</p><p>Even in broad daylight, it was as eerie as the underworld.</p><p>These people took one look and hurried down the mountain, not daring to stay too long. Even after returning, they shuddered whenever they recalled the scene.</p><p>Then more news came out.  Internal traitors, colluding with the Sand Bandits, were discovered within some renowned sects and were similarly purged. Some even had their mountain gates crippled.</p><p>Most of these sects chose to close their gates, remaining tight-lipped about the matter.</p><p>Surprisingly, the three major sects of the Fire Region didn't react at all.</p><p>The storm gradually subsided, and from beginning to end, no one knew who was responsible.</p><p>For a long time after, many cultivators remained grateful for the mysterious person's righteous deed.</p><p>The Sand Bandits'惨状 fate served as a chilling warning to those with wicked intentions.  For a long time, no one dared to stir up trouble in the desert, and the atmosphere in the cultivation world became noticeably more righteous.</p><p>It wasn't until a hundred years later that a few scattered groups of Sand Bandits reappeared, only to be swiftly eradicated by a joint effort of the various Immortal Sects.</p><p>……</p><p>Crossing the desert, entering the wasteland, finally, a touch of green came into view.</p><p>Beyond the wasteland were rolling peaks and endless barren mountains, where not only mortals couldn't survive, but even cultivators were rarely seen.</p><p>A white cloud drifted leisurely across the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop the cloud, gazing at the scenery below, and suddenly said, “Look at the flow of these rivers.  A few hundred miles further south, there will be settlements. We'll find a boat then and travel south by water.”</p><p>Luo Hou had no objections. Since descending the mountain, it had diligently adhered to its duties as a mount.</p><p>Vermilion Bird suddenly became excited, flapping its wings up and down, incessantly asking, “Are there really so many delicious things in the mortal realm?”</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang had been explaining worldly affairs to Xiao Wu. Recalling Xiao Wu's interest in the food at the Gathering Immortal Pavilion, he elaborated a bit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Vermilion Bird overheard it.</p><p>“In terms of delicate seasoning and precious ingredients, how can mortals compare to cultivators? But food is the paramount necessity of the people. Different places have different customs and practices, which will constantly bring you new and wondrous discoveries…”</p><p>As he spoke, the white cloud swept over the mountains. Qin Sang noticed the terrain ahead gradually flattening, the river widening, and man-made structures appearing along the riverbanks.  He said, “There are people ahead. Let's go down.”</p><p>Qin Sang cast a concealing illusion. The white cloud surged forward and descended directly onto a mountain path along the riverbank.</p><p>The river's current was relatively calm. There was a simple wooden dock on each bank, and the submerged wooden piles showed obvious signs of decay, suggesting they had been there for some time.</p><p>From the docks, a wide path extended inland on each side, narrowing as it went further, eventually branching into several smaller paths that disappeared into the wilderness and forests.</p><p>A covered boat was tied to each dock, both passenger ferries, seemingly with a clear division of labor.</p><p>The boatman on the east side was a thin old man, bustling about, carrying firewood, fetching water, and cleaning the boat. The boatman on the west side was strong and sturdy, leaning against the bow, legs crossed, squinting in the sun.</p><p>It wasn't time to set sail yet, and passengers were waiting on both docks.</p><p>The old man kept smiling apologetically at the passengers, repeatedly saying, “Soon! Soon!”</p><p>The passengers naturally didn't mind, and some even offered to help.</p><p>The sturdy boatman couldn't be bothered to speak to the passengers, so no one interacted with him.  The passengers looked towards the east bank with some envy.</p><p>A sour smell emanated from their boat, but they didn't dare complain in front of the sturdy boatman. They could only cover their noses discreetly, worried about the upcoming journey.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally chose the eastern boat, landing on a mountain path on the east bank and leading his horse on foot.</p><p>“Eh, a Daoist Priest is coming.”</p><p>“Where did a Daoist Priest come from around here?”</p><p>“Oh my, what a pretty girl, is she asleep on the horse?”</p><p>……</p><p>The passengers on the bank discussed Qin Sang as he approached.</p><p>As Qin Sang drew closer, the passengers fell silent, showing friendly smiles. Some even gave a slightly awkward Daoist bow.</p><p>There are deities above us.  In this world, regardless of their actual abilities, treating Daoist priests with respect is always the right thing to do.</p><p>Moreover, the Daoist priest before them, with flowing sleeves, possessed a rather otherworldly air, perhaps truly a Daoist adept.</p><p>“Boatman, my horse is a bit tired. Could you offer a convenience?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked gently.</p><p>The covered boat wasn't small and could easily accommodate a horse.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The old man put down the firewood and rubbed his hands, looking a bit troubled. “I can waive the fare for you, Daoist Priest, but this horse…”</p><p>Although there weren't many passengers now, as they traveled downriver, stopping at multiple docks until they reached North Kuo County City, these were the only two boats.</p><p>The people from both banks relied on them to enter the city, and it often became crowded past the halfway point.</p><p>“No need to waive the fare. Let the horse rest.  We'll disembark when it gets crowded, alright?”</p><p>Qin Sang took out a few copper coins.</p><p>He didn't have copper coins, so he took a silver ingot and exchanged it for them from the old man's money box.</p><p>“Well, alright.  There really is no need for the fare!”</p><p>The old man adamantly refused.</p><p>Soon, the sun reached its zenith. The old man stacked the firewood neatly and called for the passengers to board.</p><p>The number of people on both banks was about the same.  When the Azure Horse boarded, this boat noticeably dipped lower in the water.</p><p>The boatman on the west side untied the ropes, grasped the oar, and with a powerful stroke, the covered boat sliced through the water.  Its speed rivaled a fast boat, leaving a white line on the river's surface, leaving them far behind.</p><p>The old man wasn't in a hurry at all, leisurely rowing, chatting and laughing with the passengers.</p><p>The passengers occasionally glanced towards the stern. Qin Sang and Xiao Wu sat on the deck, Vermilion Bird dozing on Qin Sang's shoulder, and the Azure Horse standing beside them.</p><p>Such a combination would pique anyone's curiosity, but no one dared to disturb them, fearing they might accidentally offend the Daoist priest.</p><p>They had already assumed Qin Sang possessed some Daoist abilities. Otherwise, how would he dare travel with a young girl?</p><p>The river's course wasn't directly south. After a while, it suddenly turned west, the river narrowing and the current becoming swifter, which saved the old man some effort.</p><p>Soon, the second dock came into view.</p><p>There were only three people on the dock, including a boy around ten years old, with a large bundle at his feet. Seeing the boat, he excitedly waved his hands.</p><p>“Grandpa… Grandpa…”</p><p>A childish voice carried over. The old man beamed, quickly rowing a few strokes and approaching the dock. "Boy, did you buy it?"</p><p>“Mm-hmm!”</p><p>The boy nodded vigorously. “Uncle Zhao said the harvest was good recently, and he made a lot of preserved meat. It smells so good!”</p><p>Saying this, the boy picked up the large bundle, grunted, and before the boat fully docked, jumped onto it in three steps, startling the old man, who quickly dropped the oar and reached out to steady him.</p><p>“Don't be reckless!”</p><p>The old man raised his hand, pretending to hit him.</p><p>“Hee hee…”</p><p>The boy slipped into the cabin like a little eel. Soon, loud exclamations came from inside.</p><p>“Wow! Grandpa caught so many fish today…”</p><p>“Wow! There’s even a Yellowtooth!”</p><p>“It’s been so long since I had Yellowtooth. Last year’s one was so fragrant and plump!”</p><p>……</p><p>The boy exclaimed, but his movements were surprisingly deft. He carried the stove and seasonings to the bow, took the cleaned and gutted fish from the fish basket, and then went to the stern to fetch firewood.</p><p>“Wow!”</p><p>Suddenly seeing the Azure Horse, the boy couldn’t help but exclaim, “What a tall and mighty horse!”</p><p>What man wouldn’t desire a fine steed, especially such a magnificent one?</p><p>The boy’s face lit up with longing, staring at the Azure Horse in fascination. Then he noticed Qin Sang and Xiao Wu.</p><p>When he saw Xiao Wu, the boy froze again, staring blankly for a moment, then suddenly blushing crimson. He grabbed a bundle of firewood haphazardly and scurried back to the bow, leaning against his grandpa and pointing towards the stern, stammering, “Grandpa, is… is she blind?”</p><p>The old man was startled again, stealing a glance. Seeing no reaction from the stern, he breathed a sigh of relief.  “Her eyes might be uncomfortable. Go cook, Grandpa’s hungry.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>The boy dejectedly returned to the stove, skillfully starting a fire and cooking. A man in blue robes from the cabin came out to help.</p><p>They took a piece of preserved meat from the bundle, washed and sliced it, rendered out the fat, and stewed it with the river fish in a pot.  Soon, a fragrant aroma filled the air.</p><p>While busy, the boy kept stealing glances towards the stern, his little thoughts impossible to hide.</p><p>The passengers in the cabin smiled kindly, making the boy blush again, turning his back.</p><p>‘Gurgling…’</p><p>The river fish and preserved meat soup bubbled in the pot.</p><p>Fresh river fish, rich meaty aroma, the enticing fragrance drifted into the cabin and towards the stern.</p><p>Vermilion Bird perked up instantly, staring intently at the bow, practically wanting to jump into the pot and snatch a piece.</p><p>Xiao Wu twitched her little nose, also turning to ‘look’ in that direction, but her face remained calm, just quietly ‘watching.’</p><p>“This is the warmth of human life…”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the rapidly passing scenery along the banks, feeling a surge of emotion. He had almost forgotten the taste of human life.</p><p>The passengers’ appetites were stirred. They took out the dry rations they had prepared from their bundles and nibbled on them with water.</p><p>Then, the fish soup was ready.</p><p>It was a large iron pot, filled to the brim with fish soup, far too much for the grandfather and grandson to finish.</p><p>The boy took a string of large bamboo tubes from the edge of the covered boat, filled them with fish soup, and carefully carried them into the cabin, offering one to a timid little girl, saying crisply, “Sister, here you go.”</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>The little girl panicked, waving her hands repeatedly, wanting to stand up but afraid of spilling the fish soup in the boy’s hands.</p><p>“Drink it! Uncle Chen is a good man. When the catch is good, he always makes fish soup and shares it.  He doesn’t charge! There’s plenty of soup, go get more if you want.”</p><p>The man in blue robes also walked in, carrying fish soup and distributing it to everyone with a cheerful smile. Only then did the little girl dare to reach out and take it.</p><p>The bamboo tube contained not only fish soup but also thumb-sized small fish, perfect to eat with dry rations, much tastier than what they had before.</p><p>Using the opportunity of serving soup, the boy stole a glance at the stern, and suddenly noticed Xiao Wu ‘looking’ back. His face flushed red again, his hand trembled, and he almost spilled the fish soup, causing a few cries of alarm.</p><p>Then the boy realized Xiao Wu probably couldn’t see and was attracted by the aroma of the fish soup.</p><p>“So pitiful.”</p><p>The boy thought to himself. Seeing that neither Qin Sang nor Xiao Wu had taken out any food, his eyes lit up. He quickly ran to the bow, tugged at his grandpa’s clothes, stood on tiptoe, and whispered a few words.</p><p>Seeing his grandpa nod, the boy jumped up happily, immediately filled two bamboo tubes with fish soup, and brought them to the stern, placing them beside Qin Sang. Without a word, he ran back to the bow, grabbed a bowl, picked out the Yellowtooth fish, licked his lips, gritted his teeth, and put it all in, then filled it to the brim with preserved meat and fish, grabbed two flatbreads, and ran back, panting.</p><p>“Grandpa is giving these to you. Eat.”</p><p>The boy didn't dare to look at Xiao Wu, said a sentence to Qin Sang, and turned to run.</p><p>Vermilion Bird's eyes shone, staring at a piece of preserved meat, about to snatch it with its beak, but Qin Sang knocked it on the head, making it chirp incessantly.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the bowl and led Xiao Wu to the bow.</p><p>The boy was wolfing down his food, quickly lowering his head and nibbling on the flatbread.</p><p>“Thank you, boatman.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in thanks.  Seeing the old man wave his hands repeatedly, he smiled and said, “The boatman’s kindness, I dare not refuse. But how can one have meat without wine? I brought some rough wine, boatman, please don’t dislike it.”</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang reached into his robe, producing a wine gourd as if by magic. He picked up two thin bamboo tubes, filled them with wine, and offered them to the old man.</p><p>“How can I accept this…”</p><p>The aroma of the wine was truly tempting. The old man carefully took the bamboo tube, took a sip, and immediately felt a warmth spreading through his limbs and bones. His body felt lighter. The chill accumulated from years of boating on the river seemed to dissipate.</p><p>“Good wine! This wine… isn’t cheap, is it?”</p><p>The old man asked softly.</p><p>“I wander the world, needing wine to warm myself while traveling. I gathered herbs and brewed some myself.  It didn't cost anything.”  Qin Sang added a piece of preserved meat to Xiao Wu's bowl.  Xiao Wu chewed gently, savoring this flavor, coarser than the Gathering Immortal Pavilion's, but uniquely delicious.</p><p>“Ah! It’s medicinal wine!” The old man glanced at his grandson, feeling a bit reluctant to drink it.</p><p>Later, his grandson would take over this profession. With this wine to ward off the cold, he wouldn’t have to suffer from the same ailments he did.</p><p>“This wine isn’t strong. Children can drink it too. It can strengthen the body. Just a small sip each time.” Qin Sang stood up, picked up an empty waterskin, and filled it with wine. “No one has appreciated my craft. Since the boatman likes it, I'll give you some more.”</p><p>“Enough! Enough! Thank you, Daoist Priest! Thank you, Daoist Priest!” The old man was overwhelmed with gratitude.</p><p>The boy wasn't interested in the wine. He finished his food quickly. Xiao Wu had been sitting opposite him, and after a while, he grew bolder.  “Are you done eating? Grandpa bought me lots of toys in the city. Do you want to play?”</p><p>“Play?”</p><p>Xiao Wu tilted her head up, a puzzled expression on her face.</p><p>“Go ahead.  Do as he does,” Qin Sang patted Xiao Wu’s head.</p><p>Xiao Wu obediently stood up.  The boy brought out a treasure chest from the cabin, filled with all sorts of toys.</p><p>Qin Sang chatted with the old man about local customs while keeping an eye on Xiao Wu.</p><p>“This one! You do it like this… Fun, right?”</p><p>The boy was elated, taking out each toy and showing Xiao Wu how to play with it.</p><p>Xiao Wu’s expression remained indifferent.  Even after all the toys had been displayed, she didn’t smile.</p><p>The boy scratched his head, then glanced at the side of the boat where a bamboo fish spear was tied with a rope. His eyes lit up, and he pulled Xiao Wu’s sleeve and ran to the edge.</p><p>“My grandpa made this for me. I’ve speared several fish with it!”</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The fish spear entered the water, predictably spearing nothing.</p><p>The boy pulled the spear back, handed it to Xiao Wu, and guided the direction himself, his eyes sharply scanning the river surface. “When I tell you to let go, you let go… Let go!”</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Bloody water churned on the river's surface.</p><p>The boy’s jaw dropped, his eyes wide.</p><p>Xiao Wu's small face was bathed in sunlight, a faint, almost imperceptible smile playing on her lips, pure and innocent.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly furrowed his brow.</p>
