<h1>Chapter 1929: Sky-Blue Sand</h1><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a moment, then took another step forward.</p><p>This time, Ling Shi was prepared and immediately counterattacked, his robe billowing.</p><p>Countless strange lines, like twisting snakes and insects, appeared on the surface of the robe, crawling across his body.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>These snake-like creatures emitted lights of various colors, actually detaching from the robe and transforming into wisps of energy that surged towards Ling Shi's head.  They coalesced in mid-air into a bizarre, multicolored mass.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The mass pulsed restlessly, emitting a howling wind-like sound.  As it twisted, a humanoid silhouette emerged, but its limbs were excessively long and disproportionate.</p><p>The figure stretched out its limbs and lunged towards the poisonous miasma.</p><p>It was as if Ling Shi's soul had left his body, except this figure was multicolored and lacked facial features.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The figure plunged into the poisonous miasma and instantly merged with it.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang heard faint, crackling sounds all around him.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The poisonous miasma churned violently, suddenly producing countless snake-like creatures – some as large as pythons, others as small as maggots – swarming in from all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into a sea of insects, the surrounding scene sending shivers down his spine.</p><p>As the bizarre creatures were about to touch him, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. His body moved with incredible speed, twisting and turning.</p><p>‘Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!’</p><p>The insects lunged, but only struck afterimages.</p><p>It was nearly impossible to find an opening within the dense swarm, yet Qin Sang found one, instantly breaking through the second layer of poisonous miasma.</p><p>When he stopped, he was still clean, untouched by a single insect.</p><p>At that moment, the insect swarm froze.</p><p>It wasn't Qin Sang who had dispersed them, but Ling Shi himself who had given up.</p><p>Even with his full power controlling the Eight Formations of Corrosive Miasma, he couldn't stop the other man's advance. Ling Shi realized the other's words hadn't been an exaggeration.</p><p>Further resistance was pointless.</p><p>Tu Yuan and the other masters from the Nether Soul Abyss were already enough to overwhelm him. Ling Shi had watched Tu Yuan break through the formation, yet he hadn't fled, lacking the confidence to escape. He'd been waiting for the right moment.</p><p>Now, another mysterious expert had arrived, and Ling Shi knew his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The insect swarm receded like a tide.</p><p>“You’re not from the Nether Soul Abyss!”</p><p>Ling Shi forced himself to remain calm, speaking in a low voice.</p><p>Apart from the ancestor of the Nether Soul Abyss, who had attained incorruptible bones, no one else could break his Eight Formations of Corrosive Miasma so easily.</p><p>If the ancestor had come in person, their actions wouldn't have been so restrained.</p><p>This person either possessed exceptional mastery of formations and prohibitions or had cultivation comparable to the Nether Soul Abyss ancestor.</p><p>A Void Refinement expert?  Impossible!</p><p>Ling Shi was startled by his own thought.</p><p>Qin Sang finally spoke.  “I have no connection with the Nether Soul Abyss.”</p><p>Ling Shi searched his memory for this Daoist, finding nothing.  “Since Daoist Master isn't an ally of the Nether Soul Abyss, you must be here for me?”</p><p>“Correct. I wish to ask you to do something for me. If you agree, I will help you escape this predicament and free yourself from their control,” Qin Sang said, though he hadn’t made a move, he was fully aware of Tu Yuan’s group’s movements.</p><p>They had realized that what Tu Yuan had destroyed was just an incarnation, and grew wary.</p><p>Tu Yuan had ordered a temporary halt to the attack on the main formation and was searching for Qin Sang’s true form.</p><p>Ling Shi hadn't expected such a turn of events.</p><p>He recalled his earlier guess, his eyes suddenly brightening. “Could the Sky City be moving against the Nether Soul Abyss’s corpse demons?”</p><p>Besides the Sky City, who else dared to oppose the Nether Soul Abyss?</p><p>Otherwise, why would this Daoist, a stranger to him, risk angering the Nether Soul Abyss to save him?</p><p>“Where did you get that idea?”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. “I seek you for my own reasons. I have no intention of targeting the Nether Soul Abyss, but neither do I fear them.”</p><p>Ling Shi sensed immense confidence in Qin Sang’s tone, yet it filled him not with joy but with worry. He sneered, “What do you want me to do? The Nether Soul Abyss also claims to employ me. How do I know this isn't escaping the frying pan only to fall into the fire?”</p><p>“Simply refine some potent poisons for me, as repayment for saving your life. Once enough is made, you may leave. Until then, I will not use something like a Corpse Soul Pill to control you. Refining poisons and studying the art of poisons will benefit you as well.  Why not?”</p><p>Qin Sang made no attempt to hide his intention to use this opportunity to his advantage.</p><p>Hearing this, Ling Shi visibly relaxed. "Before I fulfill the Daoist's request, am I still under restriction?"</p><p>"Friend, ask yourself, why would I risk offending the Falling Soul Abyss to save you without any compensation?  Though I don't fear the Falling Soul Abyss, I don't wish to invite trouble.  You will cultivate at my Daoist temple. As long as you remain nearby, I will not interfere... I give you five breaths to consider."</p><p>Qin Sang waited three breaths before hearing Ling Shi's reply, "What about Tu Yuan?"</p><p>"I can take you away before the Falling Soul Abyss discovers you, or I can subdue those Falling Soul Abyss cultivators and leave them to your disposal."</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished speaking, the poisonous miasma parted, revealing a mountain peak.  </p><p>A man stood at the summit, gazing down. His face was unusually pale, his exhaustion evident, though his bearing as a Nascent Soul cultivator remained.</p><p>Their eyes met. Qin Sang smiled slightly, appearing beside Ling Shi.  "You are indeed decisive, friend."</p><p>"It's a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils!"</p><p>Ling Shi chuckled self-deprecatingly, then his expression turned serious. He bowed, "I choose the second option. Please assist me, Daoist!"</p><p>He seemed to fear that Qin Sang wouldn't dare confront the Falling Soul Abyss, quickly adding, "Refining potent poisons requires more than just my cultivation and abilities.  Poison refining is like alchemy; it needs rare materials to adjust the properties, otherwise, only mediocre poisons can be produced. The Daoist's power is unfathomable; surely your requirements are high.</p><p>"My sect possesses a Tian Qing Sand mine.  Tian Qing Sand is one of the most compatible spiritual materials for our sect's techniques. My master passed it to my junior brother, but it was seized by the Falling Soul Abyss.</p><p>"This mine is unique. A space has opened up deep within the earth. Cultivating our sect's techniques there is incredibly beneficial. It also has considerable advantages against certain evil arts of the Falling Soul Abyss.</p><p>"This is a natural wonder, a blessed location. Once destroyed, recreating it would be nearly impossible.</p><p>"Therefore, neither our sect nor the Falling Soul Abyss has exhausted the Tian Qing Sand, only taking what is needed.</p><p>"With the Tian Qing Sand, I am confident I can refine unparalleled poisons!"</p><p>Ling Shi spoke volubly, but seeing Qin Sang silently watching him, his gaze like two sharp swords piercing through his thoughts, he involuntarily fell silent.</p><p>"Tu Yuan said you and your junior brother had a falling out.  There's more to the story, I assume?  But it doesn't matter. I don't care about your schemes, as long as you fulfill my request!"</p><p>Qin Sang had overheard the previous conversation between Tu Yuan and Ling Shi.</p><p>He didn't care about Ling Shi's ulterior motives; the only condition was that Ling Shi did his job properly.</p><p>Ling Shi's expression remained unchanged, but his tone became increasingly respectful. "Back then, the ancestor of the Falling Soul Abyss personally set up a grand formation to seal the Tian Qing Sand mine. Within the Falling Soul Abyss, only a few have the right to cultivate there; Tu Yuan is one of them. His cultivation and status mean he undoubtedly possesses a 'key' allowing him to enter and exit freely!"</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Ling Shi's eyes.</p><p>His intention was to incite Qin Sang to seize the 'key,' infiltrate the Tian Qing Sand mine, and steal all the Tian Qing Sand.</p><p>While this wouldn't cripple the Falling Soul Abyss, it would be a great revenge, a restoration of what was rightfully theirs.</p><p>With that thought, Ling Shi hastily added, "Furthermore, Tu Yuan surely has a soul tablet within the Falling Soul Abyss.  We can't kill him yet.  Let's empty the Tian Qing Sand mine and then end his life!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. "I've already said I'm here for you.  Those people are yours to deal with!"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang raised a hand, clenching his fist.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Spiritual energy formed a miniature spiritual tide, frantically converging and compressing into a sphere the size of a mountain peak in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>"Truly a Void Refinement expert!"</p><p>Ling Shi's pupils constricted.  All doubt vanished, and he focused on controlling the Eight Arrays of Corrosive Miasma.</p><p>Outside the array.</p><p>Tu Yuan and his men quickly searched the area, finding nothing.</p><p>The man had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Tu Yuan's brows furrowed. Even his senior brothers couldn't manipulate things under his nose without him noticing; unless the Daoist had escaped before being brought here.</p><p>The leak of information was a significant problem.</p><p>Tu Yuan's eyes flashed with cold light. He summoned a subordinate skilled in tracking. "Search separately. If you encounter the Daoist, kill him without mercy!"</p><p>Before he finished, a deafening explosion reverberated from within the poisonous miasma.</p><p>The sound was like a thunderbolt, shaking the souls of all the Falling Soul Abyss cultivators, who stared at the miasma.</p><p>A sudden, violent tremor shook the poisonous miasma. A massive wave of fog surged forth, its back concealing a terrifying aura.  Tu Yuan sensed imminent death, shouting, "No good!"</p><p>Before he could give an order, the fog wave burst from the spirit array, crashing down.  The array formed by the Luohun Abyss cultivators, originally intended to prevent Ling Shi’s escape, proved utterly helpless against this onslaught.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The corpse array was shattered in an instant. Many cultivators were flung violently to the ground.  Though Luohun Abyss cultivators were known for their powerful physical bodies, the protective corpse energy was broken, leaving them vulnerable to the poison.</p><p>The Eight-Array Poison Miasma, a creation of Ling Shi over many years, had absorbed countless poisons.  Weaker cultivators died instantly upon contact. Even Tu Yuan, caught off guard, was thrown into the valley.</p><p>Night-owl-like screams echoed from within.  Instead of succumbing to rage, Tu Yuan, realizing something was amiss, flashed a faint light, attempting to escape underground.</p><p>But the ground was as hard as iron.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Tu Yuan was sent flying, his face pale with shock.  He tried to flee, but it felt as if the sky had fallen, crushing him.  A figure appeared before him.</p><p>Ling Shi, teeth gritted, a mixture of fury and satisfaction etched on his face, looked down at his near-death enemy.</p><p>"Old ghost Tu Yuan, did you ever imagine this day?"</p><p>"Daoist Master, it's here."</p><p>After rescuing Ling Shi, the two hurried to the Tianqing Sand vein.  Located southwest of Ling Shi’s lair, it was near the edge of Muluo Mountain.</p><p>Beyond it lay a vast wasteland, where Luohun Abyss reigned supreme – the only power strong enough to command it.  Even the most arrogant demons of Muluo Mountain wouldn't dare enter.</p><p>Ling Shi, holding the bound Tu Yuan, pointed to a seemingly ordinary mountain range.</p><p>Qin Sang, his eyes shining with divine light, detected a spirit array masking the mountain's energy – a masterful creation. Breaking it would take time and surely alert its creator.</p><p>After sensing it carefully, Qin Sang nodded to Ling Shi. Ling Shi immediately took a blood-red jade pendant from Tu Yuan's waist, leaped forward, and using Tu Yuan's aura, cast several spells to activate the jade pendant.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Blood light appeared on the mountaintop, seemingly carving a bloody hole in the void.  Ling Shi darted to the hole.</p><p>"Greetings, Master Tu Yuan," two Luohun Abyss cultivators flew out, about to bow, then sensed something was wrong.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>They attempted to seal the array and send for help, but Qin Sang and Ling Shi were faster.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The two crashed into the mountain, alerting everyone inside. Qin Sang and Ling Shi emerged on the peak.</p><p>"There are no Nascent Soul cultivators here," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Before this, I heard rumors of powerful demons disappearing inexplicably. But Muluo Mountain is chaotic; disappearances are common.  Now it seems Luohun Abyss is behind it. I wonder what the old zombie is up to," Ling Shi said gravely.  "I'll eliminate these corpse demons!"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, they hadn't detected anything unusual in Yun Du Mountain, wondering if Yun Du Tian had noticed anything.  Whatever Luohun Abyss was doing, it probably targeted Yun Du Tian, not him.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on a nearby rock, extending his consciousness through the mountain to its heart.</p><p>"Remarkable!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled.  He sensed a uniquely energetic vein.  It was the Tianqing Sand vein, but its combined energy differed greatly from a single piece of the ore.</p><p>The vein's path resembled a coiled green dragon, sealed within the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, opting against shattering the mountain to extract the entire vein, as this would reveal a Void Refinement cultivator’s presence.  Using his true energy to gradually separate the vein would be slower but safer.</p><p>Slowly, the unique energy faded.  A splendid feng shui treasure, destroyed.</p><p>Ling Shi lamented the loss, but the sight of the extracted Tianqing Sand quickly erased his regret.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The mountain echoed with thunder.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Sand grains shot into the air, gathered by Ling Shi.</p><p>With the Tianqing Sand extracted, Qin Sang erased all traces, added some camouflage, and immediately departed with Ling Shi.</p><p></p>
