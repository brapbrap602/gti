<h1>Chapter 1885: Nine Heavens Gate</h1><p>Qin Sang fled the temple, only to hear a tremendous roar behind him.  The spiritual barrier, unable to withstand the impact of the black rainbow, shattered, and the temple collapsed.  To Qin Sang's disappointment, the Gengchen Taisui enshrined within the temple, though knocked over by the impact, remained unresponsive, offering no counterattack against the culprit.  This meant that even if he sought refuge in a higher-ranking deity's temple, the black demonic roc wouldn't hesitate, free to attack any temple without restraint.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A demonic wind swept over the temple ruins.  The black demonic roc materialized, retrieving the Thunder Mirror.  Seeing the dimmed spiritual light of the treasure, it flew into a rage, a white light shooting from its chest, transforming into a ring of refined iron.</p><p>The iron ring was studded with sharp spikes on its outer rim, the inner circle hollow.  As it spun rapidly, the spikes on the outer rim lit up one after another, radiating a sharp gleam.  The light converged towards the inner circle, growing increasingly dazzling until, at its peak intensity, it erupted outwards.</p><p>‘Whizz! Whizz! Whizz!’</p><p>Piercing sounds filled the air.  Arrow-like beams of white light rained down, each incredibly sharp, relentlessly pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that if he were struck, the consequences would be dire, so he desperately dodged.  The iron ring whirled, continuously launching arrows, its power not inferior to the Thunder Mirror.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  Clearly, a single beam of foul light wouldn't reverse the situation. He abandoned any hope of luck and focused solely on escaping.</p><p>The chase led them far from the mountain, leaving behind only the collapsed temple and a toppled deity statue.  The fact proved that destroying the Thunder Mirror had not been in vain.  Though the iron ring's attack was dense, it was unsustainable, reducing the pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>During the pursuit, whenever the enemy's attack intensified and Qin Sang felt he was nearing his limit, he would seek shelter in a temple.  This not only gave him a breather but also benefited the Heavenly Inspection Chariot.</p><p>Each time the Heavenly Inspection Chariot, repaired by his hand, teleported, it edged closer to destruction.  However, Qin Sang discovered that the chariot's rate of destruction was also linked to the golden dragon pulling it.  The dragon seemed to draw energy from the Divine Court, replenishing the chariot.  Allowing the chariot to remain in the Divine Court for a while might enable self-repair.</p><p>However, this was impossible during the escape. The golden dragon could only recover while they were sheltered within a temple.  This recovery was minimal, unable to reverse the chariot's impending doom.</p><p>As time passed, the dragon's form grew increasingly faint.  Yet, each time they left a temple, the dragon would become slightly more solid.  Furthermore, preparing before teleporting lessened the stress on the chariot.</p><p>Qin Sang desperately sought any advantage, however small, clinging to it with tenacity.</p><p>‘Whizz! Whizz! Whizz!’</p><p>The Heavenly Inspection Chariot weaved between the storm of arrows.  Qin Sang, seated on the jade throne, his face grim, quickly scanned the surrounding immortal mountains and temples.  He was searching for a higher-ranking deity's temple.</p><p>The temples he had encountered previously belonged mostly to Sixty Jiazi Taisui deities, or scattered star lords among the River of Heaven deities. These deities held roughly equivalent ranks, their spiritual barriers similar and limited in power.  A higher-ranking deity might have a stronger spiritual barrier.</p><p>“This is the area of the Western White Tiger Seven Mansions. Above the scattered stars should be the Seven Mansion Lords…”</p><p>Qin Sang first passed through Kui, the first mansion in the Western Seven Mansions, but did not find Kui's temple.  One mansion encompasses multiple stars, and Qin Sang couldn’t guess where the Heavenly Court would enshrine Kui's deity.  With pursuers behind him, he couldn't search thoroughly; he might have missed it, or Kui's temple might already have been destroyed.</p><p>Lou, connected to Kui, was the second mansion of the West.  Qin Sang passed through Kui's star region, escaping into Lou, then into Wei, Mao, and finally Bi, where he finally found Bi's deity!</p><p>Straight ahead, a noticeably taller immortal mountain pierced the clouds, its temple radiating a bright spiritual light.  On the temple's plaque, six characters were clearly written in cloud script—Bi Mansion Celestial Ear Lord!  From appearances, Bi Mansion's temple was intact.  Qin Sang immediately steered the Heavenly Inspection Chariot towards it.</p><p>A black demonic Roc, observing the Bisu Star Lord temple from afar, felt a surge of anger and unleashed a wave of killing intent.</p><p>Despite its powerful attacks, every assault was futile.  Qin Sang, utilizing the potent abilities of the Divine Inspection Chariot, consistently evaded or teleported away.</p><p>The Roc, resorting to a highly draining divine technique, not only failed to trap Qin Sang but also allowed him to gain distance. Enraged, it exploded in fury.</p><p>Before departing, it had boasted to the Bi-scaled Serpent about its swift victory.  Having failed miserably, its reputation was tarnished.  Its mission was to quickly secure the Divine Inspection Chariot, yet here it was, held back by Qin Sang.  A failure here would have dire consequences, leaving it with little to say to its superior.</p><p>Unaware of the Roc's predicament, Qin Sang steered the golden dragon into the temple.  As before, it smoothly passed through the spiritual barrier.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The chariot landed, the golden dragon lying still, focusing on its recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the statue inside, impressed by the Bisu Star Lord's noble appearance.  Clad in a white robe and with a sword at his waist, the statue possessed a remarkable presence.  Its features were strikingly human-like, unlike typical statues.</p><p>He recalled the various statues he’d seen in the Divine Court: some monstrous, adhering to legends; others, remarkably human.</p><p>“When the Daoist Court created the divine talismans, they likely considered more than just legends. Perhaps they incorporated virtuous Daoist ancestors, merging them with legendary deity images.  A form of veneration and legacy,”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, staring at the Bisu Star Lord. The statue shone with divine light, seemingly coming alive. A strange power emanated from it.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A roar echoed from outside, shaking the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, but his expression softened as he witnessed the scene outside.  Hundreds of arrows, fired from a refined iron wheel, targeted the spiritual barrier, only to be repelled. The barrier flickered, yet it was clearly stronger and more resilient than previous temples.</p><p>Ignoring the chaos, Qin Sang continued to scrutinize the Bisu Star Lord. He had observed this state in other divine talismans before, but time constraints had prevented further investigation.</p><p>“Could it be…?”</p><p>A thought struck him:  a Daoist incantation – Summoning Deities and Commanders.  It supposedly granted access to divine power, bolstering oneself and one's forces, even allowing the deity to possess the caster.  </p><p>The failure of past attempts had led him to question the deities' origins.  Now, understanding that they were divine talismans, he realized their unresponsiveness stemmed from the Divine Court's closure.  With its reappearance, could these incantations now work?</p><p>“Is someone summoning the Bisu Star Lord? Are Daoist cultivators battling demons? Will the outcome of this conflict determine the turning point?”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, pondering his situation while gaining a new insight.</p><p>“The Gui Fang demons are also rooted in the Divine Court. The summoners may not necessarily be Daoist cultivators. Yet why hasn’t the Roc attempted it?”</p><p>Looking outside, he saw darkness consuming the clouds, closing in.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, demons could also perform such incantations, though far less proficiently than Daoists.</p><p>First, demonic incantations were adapted from Daoist ones, leading to inconsistencies.  Gui Fang prioritized summoning guardian deities to protect their spirits, neglecting other aspects.</p><p>Second, since the decline of the Divine Court, such incantations had become ineffective, so Gui Fang had abandoned these efforts.</p><p>The black Roc had dabbled in such techniques during its leisure. Had it entered the Divine Court before its transformation, it might have succeeded. Now, having attained divinity and merged with a talisman deity within the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, its understanding of divinity was still incomplete, and it was unsure of any specific summoning techniques. Even if it could summon a deity, it would likely only be one from the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons, whose power was inferior to its own.  Such a boost wouldn’t alter the present situation.</p><p>Qin Sang remained oblivious to these complexities.  His focus was on utilizing the power of the divine talisman to overcome the crisis. Sadly, he only possessed superficial knowledge of these incantations.  Advanced techniques were closely guarded Daoist secrets, and he wouldn’t have paid the price for something previously useless.</p><p>As far as he knew, summoning deities required specific rituals involving hand gestures, steps, and incantations.  The禹步 (Yu Bu) steps and the掌目 (Zhang Mu) gestures were essential components of Daoist practice, crucial for summoning and subduing.</p><p>Summoning higher-level celestial guardians requires a complex ritual, essential and only achievable by high-ranking Daoist masters.  Even with Bi Su Xing Jun before him, Qin Sang didn't know how to harness divine power.</p><p>“I cultivate the High Shang Shenxiao school, corresponding to the Lei Bu (Thunder Department) deities, but I haven't obtained the necessary scriptures. If it were a Lei Bu deity, could I invoke it through the Nine Heavens Thunder Seal in the altar?”</p><p>While Qin Sang pondered, the black demonic peng attacked the protective barrier around the divine temple relentlessly. The temple trembled, the barrier dimming.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “It seems the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions' power isn't enough to stop the demon king.  Above the Western Seven Mansions' star deities are the Four Symbols, including the White Tiger deity…”</p><p>Staying in the Western Seven Mansions offered fewer options.  The black demonic peng's attacks grew increasingly skillful. If even the White Tiger deity's temple couldn't withstand it, Qin Sang's situation would become extremely perilous.</p><p>‘BOOM!’</p><p>The shock jolted Qin Sang awake.  Seeing the external situation, his expression changed, and he immediately summoned the golden dragon, using instant movement to escape.</p><p>He couldn't wait for the temple to be breached.  Lower realm Daoist cultivators summoning celestial guardians to fight; the destruction of these guardians would severely weaken spells and cultivators connected to Bi Su Xing Jun. It could even affect the overall battle, slowing the arrival of Daoist Court reinforcements.</p><p>A golden light vanished from the temple.  Sensing this, the black demonic peng immediately targeted the teleporting Taiyi Star Chariot, pursuing it with a furious gust of demonic wind.</p><p>“Purple Micro Palace…”</p><p>Qin Sang fled, gazing towards the Three Enclosures. The Three Enclosures are the core of the celestial constellations; Daoist texts place the highest-ranking deities here.  For example, the Five Dou Star Lords, the Nine Luminaries, and even legendary Emperors!  There were more safe havens.  Ordinary celestial deities' temples were denser, especially the Big Dipper region of the Purple Micro Palace, with not only the seven Big Dipper stars' corresponding seven Yuan Star Lords, but also the Thirty-Six Heavenly Gang Stars and Seventy-Two Earthly Sha Stars.</p><p>The closest high-level celestial guardian in the Purple Micro Palace should be one of the Five Dou, specifically the Western Dou, comprising four palaces: Bai Biao Star Lord, Gao Yuan Star Lord, Huang Ling Star Lord, and Ju Wei Star Lord.  These four lords' power certainly surpassed that of the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions.</p><p>But the demons invading the Divine Court had all gone towards the Three Enclosures. Fleeing there risked an ambush, even greater danger.</p><p>“Where are the Lei Bu deities?”</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, gazing at the celestial clouds above the Three Enclosures. “Could the Lei Bu be there?” The Lei Bu deities shouldn't be fewer than the Dou Bu deities, and likely occupy a separate area in the Divine Court.</p><p>One glance, and Qin Sang abandoned the idea of going to the Lei Bu.  Streams of demonic energy surged into the Three Enclosures, heading towards the heavens, penetrating layers of celestial gates.  Going there now was tantamount to walking into a trap. Furthermore, the damage there was clearly more severe, temples sparser—better to stay with the Dou Bu.</p><p>After weighing his options, Qin Sang steered his divine chariot towards the Western Dou!</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Three Enclosures, layers of celestial clouds towered, supporting the Nine Heavens of Shenxiao. The Nine Heavens, the Thunder City!</p><p>At this moment, the Azure-Scaled Demon Serpent led a host of demon gods, relentlessly assaulting the Shenxiao Upper Palace atop Thunder City.  Entering Thunder City, the demon gods realized reaching the Shenxiao Upper Palace wasn't easy.  Otherwise, the great demon saint wouldn't have personally brought the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prison fragments to storm the South Heavenly Gate.</p><p>Each heaven was a layer of restriction. They charged upwards from the first heaven, initially progressing smoothly, exploiting breaches in Thunder City's defenses, reaching the seventh heaven.  Reaching the eighth, they encountered trouble. While the eighth heaven's restrictions were also damaged, the gaps exerted tremendous pressure, overwhelming most demon gods.  The Azure-Scaled Demon Serpent led only those above Dongxuan rank, forming an array to push through, only to find a solitary temple on the eighth heaven.</p><p>Knowing Daoist Court history, they recognized the temple as dedicated to Jiu Tian Ying Yuan Lei Sheng Pu Hua Tian Zun, the supreme Lei Bu guardian!</p><p>“Lei Zu wasn't destroyed!”</p><p>The Azure-Scaled Demon Serpent showed shock.  The temple doors were closed, yet emanated a terrifying pressure. The demon gods exchanged glances, bypassing Lei Zu's temple, continuing their ascent.  Breaking through the ninth heaven would allow them to seize the Shenxiao Upper Palace, forcing the Daoists to submit!</p><p>But they only found a few possible fissures. Even with their combined strength, they couldn't break through.  They used a combined demonic formation, attacking furiously, yet failed to shake the ninth heaven's restrictions.</p><p>The Azure-Scaled Demon Serpent's eyes gleamed. Its head lowered, gazing across eight heavens, towards the Western Seven Mansions.  The demonic peng hadn't managed to capture that person, who still had the patrol divine chariot.</p><p>“Useless!”</p><p>The Azure-Scaled Demon Serpent coldly snorted. Regardless of whether the chariot could help them reach the ninth heaven, they had to try.  It glanced at a nearby demon, “Gu, have the others continue searching for weaknesses. You come with me.”</p><p>The Azure-Scaled Demon Serpent swam back to the eighth heaven, addressing a golden-horned bull demon.  The bull demon followed, riding a cloud of light.</p>
