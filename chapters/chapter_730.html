<h1>Chapter 722: Suppression</h1><p>Chapter 722: Suppression</p><p>A black-armored man had a circular mirror-like phantom appear above his head.</p><p>The phantom mirror spun rapidly, finally facing a two-headed creature, its surface shimmering with light.</p><p>“No strong demonic aura.  It seems to have wandered here and been drawn by the Cold Flame…”</p><p>The black-armored man relaxed slightly, putting away the mirror phantom. His breathing grew ragged; using the phantom mirror seemed to have taken a great toll on him.</p><p>His tension gone, he examined the two-headed creature with amusement, coldly laughing, “A two-headed creature! I haven't seen one of these outside for a long time… Since you’ve come to me, don't think about leaving!”</p><p>Before his words finished, the black-armored man leaped from the water, leaving a trail of afterimages as he rapidly closed the distance.</p><p>He moved his arm, and dark spears shot out beams of dark light from their tips. In an instant, these beams formed a lifelike black phoenix.</p><p>The black phoenix cried out, its long tail feathers trailing behind it, its posture exceptionally graceful, as it swooped down from the air, attacking the two-headed creature.</p><p>The two-headed creature roared, its two eyes blazing with ferocious light, its blue aura surging.</p><p>Two gusts of wind merged into one, countless sharp wind blades rapidly spinning within the hurricane, like a meat grinder.</p><p>The black phoenix showed no fear, diving straight into the vortex of wind.</p><p>At that moment, the black phoenix spread its wings, its body becoming incredibly ethereal. A large black circle burst from within it, rapidly expanding.</p><p>The black phoenix almost vanished, leaving only the enormous black circle.</p><p>The timing was perfect; the circle exploded right in the heart of the wind vortex.</p><p>With a series of booming sounds and surging waves, the blue and black lights quickly merged, but the black light clearly dominated, easily tearing through the blue light and sweeping away the wind blades.</p><p>Seeing the black light pierce through the wind vortex and about to strike, the two-headed creature showed a look of terror, flapping its wings wildly and fleeing in panic.</p><p>Having escaped that attack, the two-headed creature glanced back at the Cold Flame, and turned to flee.</p><p>The black-armored man coldly snorted, his speed suddenly increasing.</p><p>The two-headed creature abruptly split into six incredibly realistic duplicates. Seven identical two-headed creatures scattered, each fleeing in a different direction.</p><p>Each of the two-headed creatures maintained almost the same speed, appearing completely natural, making it difficult to distinguish the real one from the illusions in a short period.</p><p>For a time, there were two-headed creatures heading in three directions: east, south, and north.</p><p>The black-armored man seemed to be angered by the two-headed creature's trickery.</p><p>Unflustered, the black-armored man shook his black spear, which also divided into seven.</p><p>Seven spears floated before him.  He scanned them, then flicked his fingers, sending each spear towards a separate two-headed creature.</p><p>“Boom… boom…”</p><p>Huge waves rose.</p><p>Four of the two-headed creatures were pierced and shattered, proving them illusions, but the other three nimbly avoided the spears.</p><p>The black-armored man had anticipated this, but he hadn’t expected that while he kept his eyes fixed on the two-headed creatures, he couldn’t locate the real one.</p><p>Watching the three remaining two-headed creatures escape, the black-armored man frowned, stroking his waist and pulling out a bamboo tube as thick as his arm.</p><p>The tube was a foot long, fresh and juicy, as if freshly cut.</p><p>The black-armored man muttered incantations, and a whooshing sound came from the bamboo tube, followed by a stream of water. After a wriggling motion, it transformed into a flock of strangely shaped water birds.</p><p>The black-armored man pointed a finger, dividing the flock into three groups. The water birds shot out like arrows.</p><p>“Bang… bang… bang…”</p><p>These water birds, like cannonballs, exploded directly against the two-headed creatures. The two-headed creature’s figures swayed wildly, and the black-armored man quickly spotted the real one.</p><p>The black-armored man sneered, pursuing the middle two-headed creature.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was submerged beneath the water, silently approaching Cold Flame Island, and reached the vicinity of the Dongming Cold Flame undetected.</p><p>Even underwater, he could feel the violent aura of the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up.  Shimmering on the water's surface were countless blue lights. He chose one, swam towards it, and carefully approached.</p><p>From previous encounters, Qin Sang knew the nature of the Dongming Cold Flames.  If his true energy touched them, they would inevitably erupt, revealing his presence.</p><p>It all depended on whether the Jiuyou Netherfire could suppress the Dongming Cold Flame.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his palm, placed the small Ten Directions Yama Banner around him, and summoned the Jiuyou Netherfire.</p><p>Worried that the Jiuyou Netherfire might trigger a violent reaction from all the Dongming Cold Flames, Qin Sang carefully concealed its aura.  He raised his hand slightly, guiding the Jiuyou Netherfire towards one of the flames.</p><p>His expression was tense as he watched the interaction between the two, ready to escape at any moment.</p><p>The Jiuyou Netherfire drew closer.</p><p>Sensing the disturbance, the Dongming Cold Flame began to violently shake – a clear sign of imminent eruption.  Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart leaped into his throat.</p><p>As the Jiuyou Netherfire neared, Qin Sang watched helplessly as the Dongming Cold Flame fluctuated more violently, its core radiating an intensely blue light – it was at the critical point!</p><p>Qin Sang almost gave up.</p><p>The Jiuyou Netherfire suddenly enveloped the Dongming Cold Flame, its immense power instantly revealed.</p><p>At that moment, the Dongming Cold Flame stopped shaking.  It seemed to have encountered something terrifying and began to violently contract, shrinking into a tight ball.</p><p>But the threat of explosion hadn't passed.  Although the Dongming Cold Flame feared the Jiuyou Netherfire, Qin Sang sensed it hadn't truly submitted.  The Jiuyou Netherfire's power was deceptive; if its weakness was discovered, an eruption was still possible.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly channeled true energy into the Ten Directions Yama Banner, summoning another wisp of Jiuyou Netherfire.</p><p>With this additional Netherfire, the Dongming Cold Flame finally calmed down, returning to a harmless state.</p><p>"I actually suppressed it!"</p><p>Qin Sang, his heart finally at ease, wore a face of surprised relief.</p><p>However, suppressing the Dongming Cold Flame didn't mean he could take it away.</p><p>"Suppressing such a small flame was this difficult.  It seems impossible for me to take away more with my current abilities."</p><p>Qin Sang looked regretfully at the other Dongming Cold Flames. After a moment's thought, he slowly closed his hand, the Jiuyou Netherfire clinging to the surface of the flame, gently pulling it down.</p><p>Looking at the spirit flame, Qin Sang hesitated, then gently held it.</p><p>He was naturally extremely nervous.  He knew the power of the Dongming Cold Flame.  The slightest disturbance could cause it to erupt, and if it exploded in his hand, the consequences would be unthinkable.</p><p>After obtaining the flame, Qin Sang didn't immediately leave. He left behind a few wisps of Jiuyou Netherfire before quietly retreating.</p><p>The black-armored man's power was even greater than he had imagined, his… [sentence incomplete in original text].</p>
