<h1>Chapter 1059: The Venomous Pool</h1><p>"Let me scout ahead. I have the True Phoenix Feather. Even if I encounter danger, I can escape quickly," Jiu Feng offered.</p><p>Jiao Long pondered for a moment, then cautioned, "Very well. However, after we find the Dragon's Remains and leave the inner hall, we will still need the True Phoenix Feather. Be careful not to deplete its power too much."</p><p>"I understand," Jiu Feng nodded.</p><p>Jiao Long channeled golden light, forming armor around Jiu Feng.  Jiu Feng then took out the True Phoenix Feather, held it in her hand, and cautiously stepped forward.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as she entered the Spirit Suppression Domain, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The previously unknown, yet calm, fluctuations permeating the void were disrupted by Jiu Feng's entry, like a pebble tossed into a still lake.</p><p>Instantly, the void trembled.</p><p>The unknown fluctuations surged like waves, and runes seemed to flash in the void, pressing down on Jiu Feng layer by layer.</p><p>A flush crept up Jiu Feng's face, and she gritted her teeth, seemingly resisting immense pressure, though the pressure was formless and intangible.</p><p>The golden armor remained unchanged.</p><p>She swayed slightly, feeling her True Essence stagnate and her Primordial Spirit waver.  She hastily retreated, intending to better prepare herself for another attempt.</p><p>At this moment, the armored man's eyes flickered, and he called out to Jiu Feng, "Fellow Daoist Jiu Feng, there's no need to try again. I believe I know the reason."</p><p>Jiu Feng frowned, dissatisfied, "I haven't even used the True Phoenix Feather..."</p><p>The armored man interrupted Jiu Feng, his voice deep, "Your cultivation is insufficient. Even if you go in, you won't get far before being forced back by the pressure. Using the True Phoenix Feather might help you resist the ancient restriction, but the entire Spirit Suppression Domain is like this. How long can the True Phoenix Feather's power last? It would be a waste! We still need your power to escape. I have no desire to be trapped in this forsaken place."</p><p>Jiao Long asked in surprise, "Brother Hei, you seem quite knowledgeable about the Spirit Suppression Domain?"</p><p>The armored man chuckled, "Having lived in the Boundless Sea for so many years, I've heard some rumors, though I couldn't confirm their veracity. Now, I've witnessed it firsthand. It's said that there's an ancient formation at the center of the Spirit Suppression Domain, which exerts a strange suppression throughout the entire area.  This makes it nearly impossible for low-level cultivators to traverse the domain. Only Grand Cultivators with cultivation comparable to yours, or at least at the peak of Mid-Nascent Soul Realm, can withstand the formation's suppression and move freely. Although Fellow Daoist Jiu Feng is nearing a breakthrough to Mid-Transformation Realm, it's still not enough..."</p><p>Jiao Long's expression turned to surprise. He then stepped forward.</p><p>A similar phenomenon occurred, but Jiao Long fared much better than Jiu Feng; his True Essence didn't stagnate noticeably.</p><p>"What a strange Spirit Suppression Domain!"  Jiao Long retreated, frowning.</p><p>At this point, the armored man, wanting to test the domain's power, also stepped inside.  He was at the peak of Mid-Transformation Realm, only a step away from Late-Transformation Realm, and could move freely as well.</p><p>The other Demon Kings were far less fortunate.</p><p>One of them, a Tiger King at Mid-Transformation Realm, made thorough preparations.  He was fine initially, but after crossing two mountains, he felt the pressure increasing, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>"Humans suspect that the suppression here was even more formidable in the past.  Perhaps even Deity Transformation and Void Refinement Grand Cultivators couldn't penetrate it. It might have been used to suppress something, or for some other purpose. After countless millennia, the ancient formation's power has gradually weakened, and the suppression has lessened, allowing us to enter," the armored man explained. He turned to look at the Tiger King beside him.  "In a few hundred years, Fellow Daoist, you might be able to enter. But you can't break through the restriction now."</p><p>Jiao Long nodded thoughtfully, "That speculation isn't unreasonable… It seems that only Brother Hei and I can enter to search for the Dragon's Remains. The other Fellow Daoists will have to wait outside."</p><p>The armored man nodded, "It has to be this way.  However, I'm now worried that the Dragon's Remains might be connected to the ancient formation in the Spirit Suppression Domain. What if we retrieve the Dragon's Remains and release something… perhaps a powerful ancient demon? The Boundless Sea would be in grave danger."</p><p>"How could the Dragon's Remains be connected to a human formation?" Jiao Long shook his head, finding the idea absurd. "If humans knew that Mount Yitian held Dragon's Remains, they would certainly retrieve them without hesitation. Even if something unforeseen were to happen, Brother Hei, you needn't worry. Once I obtain the Dragon's Remains, I will be able to break through to Deity Transformation Realm, and seizing the teleportation formation will be child's play. Then, you can all return to the Demon Sea with me. The Boundless Sea is the domain of cultivators. We simply need to seal the teleportation formation, sit back, and wait for the opportune moment to reap the spoils..."</p><p>The armored man laughed heartily, "If what's suppressed below is one of our Demon race ancestors, that would be even better. Perhaps our path to immortality will be within reach!"</p><p>Jiao Long smiled faintly and shook his head repeatedly, "Even if something truly is suppressed below, the chances of it surviving until now are slim. The ancient formation has been eroded to this level of power. What level of cultivation could resist the ravages of time and cling to life until now?"</p><p>He then addressed the other Demon Kings, "Due to these unforeseen circumstances, you must remain outside. Human cultivators frequent this area, so try to avoid conflict with them. Find a hidden place to conceal yourselves. If anything unexpected happens, we may need your assistance."</p><p>The Demon Kings exchanged glances and nodded resignedly. If Jiao Long and the armored man found the Dragon's Remains, they would undoubtedly keep the best parts for themselves, leaving only scraps for the others.</p><p>But what could they do? Their cultivation wasn't sufficient to withstand the suppression.</p><p>"I can try," Jiu Feng said, unwilling to give up.</p><p>Jiao Long shook his head, "Brother Hei is right. The True Phoenix Feather is crucial. Even if we don't find the Dragon's Remains, we can't cut off our escape route. Jiu Feng, wait for me outside."</p><p>Jiu Feng frowned but remained silent.</p><p>Jiao Long nodded to the armored man and was about to enter when Jiu Feng suddenly stepped forward and handed him something. It was a magnificent long plume.</p><p>"This Phoenix Plume, although not as powerful as the True Phoenix Feather, can help you escape if you encounter a restriction and become trapped. Take it as a precaution. My clan has refined it into something akin to a magical treasure. It doesn't require Phoenix bloodline to activate. I'll transmit the method of control to you…" Jiu Feng's voice came through a mental transmission.</p><p>Jiao Long thanked her and promised, "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist. If I find the Dragon's Reverse Scale, I will definitely secure a share for you…"</p><p>"I hope so," Jiu Feng sighed almost imperceptibly.</p><p>Jiao Long and the armored man walked side-by-side into the Spirit Suppression Domain, gradually disappearing from view.</p><p>The other Demon Kings didn't wander off; they found a concealed location nearby, set up an isolation barrier, and quietly awaited Jiao Long's news.</p><p>The two demons crossed the mountains and entered the stone forest below Mount Yitian.</p><p>Jiao Long used his secret technique to sense again, pointing to the left in surprise, "The Dragon's Remains aren't beneath Mount Yitian. They're in that direction!"</p><p>The two demons immediately set off, flying for a while before they saw a small lake amidst the stone forest ahead.</p><p>Surprisingly, the lake water here was clear and hadn't dried up.</p><p>"It's the Venomous Pool!"  The armored man's expression shifted slightly.</p>
