<h1>Chapter 1324: Confirmation of Learning</h1><p>“Greetings, Master Uncle.”</p><p>Tan Yi’en entered and paid his respects.</p><p>Qin Sang motioned him to rise.  “I tasked you with secretly investigating Mu Yifeng’s whereabouts. Have you found anything?”</p><p>Qin Sang had always kept Mu Yifeng’s kindness in his heart.</p><p>Upon returning to Xiaohan Domain, Qin Sang wanted to see him, but Mu Yifeng had been in secluded cultivation at Shaohua Mountain, making it impossible. Later, his open falling out with Dongyang Bo prevented him from involving Mu Yifeng further, making a visit impossible.</p><p>Tan Yi’en replied, “Reporting to Master Uncle, I’ve gathered information through discreet conversations with wandering cultivators and made contact with Shaohua Mountain disciples. I've learned that Mu Yifeng is a dedicated hermit, rarely seen, and has been in seclusion in a cave at the foot of Jingyue Peak.  In recent years, he hasn’t left Jingyue Peak at all, and even few Shaohua Mountain disciples know of him.”</p><p>“Jingyue Peak?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, Jingyue Peak had once been Chen Yan’s training ground!</p><p>When he first joined Shaohua Mountain, Zhuang Yan had taken him on a tour, highlighting this peak.  Back then, Jingyue Peak was forbidden territory, off-limits to inner disciples.</p><p>Chen Yan’s background was significant, and after that incident, she didn’t completely break with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>She had a mysterious master imprisoned in Ziwei Palace, who might return at any time.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain was vast, with no shortage of caves. Someone as shrewd as Dongyang Bo wouldn’t allow other disciples to cultivate on Jingyue Peak unless permitted by Chen Yan.</p><p>“Could it be that Dongyang Bo didn’t punish Mu Yifeng back then because Chen Yan was protecting him in secret?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently.</p><p>The true story, likely, only the people involved know.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang said, “Continue to have people stationed at the various markets outside Shaohua Mountain, waiting for Mu Yifeng to emerge from seclusion.  Beyond that, avoid any unnecessary actions, lest you arouse Shaohua Mountain’s suspicions.”</p><p>Over the past ten years, Dongyang Bo had lived in seclusion, taking no action against Qin Sang or Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Taking the Yuan Ying puppet and disrupting Dongyang Bo's schemes had been satisfying for Qin Sang.  Later, after his senior sister’s guidance, his resentment had faded.</p><p>However, even when one desires tranquility, trouble may still arise.</p><p>Therefore, after Bai left seclusion, Qin Sang deliberately revealed weaknesses, giving Dongyang Bo an opportunity.</p><p>If Dongyang Bo remained peaceful, coexistence would be acceptable.</p><p>“This disciple obeys!”</p><p>Tan Yi’en acted without questioning the reason.</p><p>Qin Sang gave a few more instructions before dismissing him.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang left Wanye Mountain and returned to Yuanxu.</p><p>He would replace Grandmaster Canghong, guarding the Zuishen Palace gate for three years.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was abundant, not hindering cultivation.  Also, Qin Sang needed several years to refine his alchemy techniques and prepare to refine a magical artifact to subdue the Nanming Lihuo.</p><p>Mist Sea.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang arrived, Grandmaster Canghong noticed him.</p><p>Grandmaster Canghong flew towards him, bowing slightly, “The task will now be entrusted to Daoist Friend Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the jade tablet controlling the spirit array and asked, “Has there been any unusual activity at the gate recently?”</p><p>“Nothing has been discovered.  Old Devil Ye remains dormant, presumably awaiting the emergence of Ziwei Palace.  However, Daoist Friend Qin should not be complacent,” Grandmaster Canghong shook his head slightly, offering a warning.</p><p>Qin Sang considered this and nodded, then recalled something else. “How are the Daoist friends who took the Ku Yuan Pill?”</p><p>“Their spirit, energy, and vitality are all weakening; none are unaffected!  Old Monster Feng and the others have tried various methods, only managing to slow the decline. Even worse, one Daoist friend has a vague feeling that their tribulation might arrive early!”</p><p>Grandmaster Canghong shook his head, still agitated. “If that’s true, it's best to leave that pill untouched!”</p><p>“The tribulation arriving early?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Such a cost was even more terrifying than the decline of spirit, energy, and vitality. Old Devil Ye's scheme was truly vicious.</p><p>After seeing off Grandmaster Canghong, Qin Sang entered the Seven Waters Mystifying Array, mastering every change within the spirit array. The other Daoist friends stationed there came out to greet Qin Sang. After getting acquainted, they found places to cultivate without disturbing each other.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the core of the Seven Waters Mystifying Array.</p><p>Any change at the gate would be immediately detected. Cultivating here also avoided being spied on.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang set up a layer of isolating restriction, then summoned the Yuan Ying puppet.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet had now been subdued by Qin Sang and restored to its previous strength.  Protected by the jade Buddha, he didn’t fear the puppet’s backlash and could freely control it—an excellent assistant.</p><p>Of course, what Qin Sang valued most was the soul shadow within the puppet.</p><p>He skillfully merged his consciousness into the spirit-infused puppet, experiencing the soul shadow. The process was incredibly draining, leaving him slightly fatigued.  Qin Sang then withdrew the puppet, cultivating and contemplating his recent gains.</p><p>Next, he took out the demonic banner and refined the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire until exhaustion.</p><p>Afterward, he reviewed the Xu Ling sect's texts, studying the art of refining artifacts.</p><p>His days were packed with tasks, one after another.</p><p>For ten years, Qin Sang spent each day this way, never slacking. His most noticeable improvement was in artifact refinement; he learned many precious secret techniques at the Xu Ling sect, greatly aiding his progress.</p><p>Two more years passed in the Yuanxu abyss, with Ye Laomo remaining inactive.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang summoned the Jin Chen sword.</p><p>For a considerable time, the Jin Chen sword would replace the Wumu sword as his primary weapon.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's plan, he would start with the Jin Chen sword, testing his progress in refining, then create an artifact to subdue the Southern Ming Li Fire, and finally refine the Jiao wood.</p><p>He also took out several precious spiritual materials.</p><p>These were all wood-attribute treasures.</p><p>The quantity was small, only a few.</p><p>Qin Sang had exchanged most of his battle merits for fire-attribute materials.</p><p>However, if he could successfully refine these materials with the Jin Chen wood, it should raise the Jin Chen wood to the level of a high-grade artifact, sufficient for now.</p><p>As for top-grade artifacts, they weren't so easily created.  Aside from lacking sufficient materials, even if he gathered them, Qin Sang wasn't confident in his ability to create one.</p><p>“Transformation Root Stone, Sky Blue Silver…”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the materials. He then formed a hand seal, closed his eyes slightly, and employed a secret technique learned at the Xu Ling sect to analyze them.</p><p>Through generations of accumulation, the Xu Ling sect had hoarded dozens of secret techniques related to this single step, each designed for materials of different properties.</p><p>A solitary cultivator, unless a prodigy, would lack the ability to create such techniques independently.</p><p>If it were a thousand years ago, this step would have consumed immense energy from Qin Sang. Now, it was much easier.</p><p>After completing this step, Qin Sang employed a new secret technique and summoned the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Using the power of the demon fire, he purified the impurities from the materials, simultaneously melting the Jin Chen sword into a sword embryo.</p><p>Lacking the power of earth fire, Qin Sang had to endure the tremendous consumption of the demon fire. He frequently took pills to restore his true essence.</p><p>Qin Sang meticulously completed each step of the refinement process.  When encountering difficulties, he paused to reflect and make improvements, gaining considerable insight.</p><p>Finally, he watched as the Jin Chen sword was reborn in his hands, undergoing a complete transformation!</p>
