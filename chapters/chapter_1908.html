<h1>Chapter 1899:  Towards the Heavenly Opening Pass, Carrying a World into the Greater Thousand!</h1><p>The young boy in green robes returned to his true form, his sword shattering.</p><p>Qin Sang caught the fragments, his arm trembling.</p><p>The power of the Inner Lion Seal was fading; he was struggling to maintain it, growing weaker.</p><p>The fragments couldn't spontaneously recombine as before, and he couldn't sense the sword spirit's presence, causing Qin Sang to secretly worry.</p><p>The sword spirit's condition was clearly worsening.</p><p>"Could the Thunder Ancestor conceal the aura of the Earth-Slaying Sword?"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed his dantian, falling into thought.</p><p>Within his dantian, the Thunder Ancestor remained a mere phantom, seemingly lacking any extraordinary power.</p><p>At that moment, golden light shone from the heavens, washing away the blood rain, restoring the world to clarity.</p><p>Zhang Tianshi returned on his imperial chariot, his gaze falling upon Qin Sang, his eyes filled with authority.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled; he was about to bow in greeting.</p><p>Then Zhang Tianshi said in a deep voice:</p><p>"Disciple Zhang Hai Chan, now holding the Dao Scripture Master's Seal, conveying the Heavenly Master's decree from the Nine Heavens Golden Que… recognizing your restarting of the Divine Court, your thwarting of demons, your exemplary virtues, and your merits for eternity!  I hereby bestow upon you the rank of Zheng San Pin, Nine Heavens Golden Que Celestial, Commander of the Godly Thunder Jade Pivot, and holder of the Five Thunder Court Seal!"</p><p>The Five Thunder Court Seal was the seal of the Five Thunder Court Lord.</p><p>Unlike the Heavenly Pivot Court and the North Pole Exorcism Court, the Five Thunder Court was one of the inner courts of the Thunder Jade Palace, one of the Thunder Administrations.</p><p>Currently, the chief officials of the Heavenly Pivot Court and the North Pole Exorcism Court were mostly Zheng Si Pin True Persons, due to the decline of the Daoist sect, with the highest cultivation only reaching two True Lords, and the rest being even lower.</p><p>During the Daoist sect's peak, the Five Thunder Court Lord held a powerful position. Now, this position was bestowed upon Qin Sang, an outsider.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang, at the early stage of the Void Refinement realm, was granted the rank of Zheng San Pin Celestial official and control of the Five Thunder Court!</p><p>However, Qin Sang's title was more ceremonial than real.</p><p>The Thunder Jade Palace wouldn't obey his orders, and the Daoist court, still recovering, wouldn't allocate him a single soldier.</p><p>Despite being merely a title, with this decree, Qin Sang could act in the Greater Thousand World under the authority of a Daoist court official, and no one would dare question his identity.</p><p>Zhang Tianshi's words materialized into a fiery red script, each character a zhang in size, with eight-angled pendants, covering the heavens, its golden light illuminating space.</p><p>Golden light swirled, the decree transforming into a scroll and flying towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Along with the decree came a square seal.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a connection and summoned his dantian.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>A golden light and a lightning bolt arrived simultaneously, entering the dantian and manifesting as the decree and the Five Thunder Court Seal.</p><p>"Another fragmented seal…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.  In recent years, most of the Daoist treasures he had encountered were incomplete, including the Heavenly Patrol Chariot.</p><p>The Five Thunder Court Seal, its inscription carved with thunder patterns and surrounded by electric light, was unfortunately marred with cracks, and the seal knob was broken.</p><p>However, it was in better condition than the Heavenly Patrol Chariot; its residual power still remained.</p><p>At that moment, thunderous sounds echoed from within the dantian. The Thunder Ancestor's divine intent burst forth with lightning, causing the dantian to violently shake.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. The Thunder Ancestor's divine intent vaguely manifested as a phantom figure surrounded by lightning. He would obtain an extraordinary guardian deity for his dantian, but this deity seemed to exceed the dantian's limit, showing signs of losing control!</p><p>He then understood that someone had previously placed a barrier between him and the Thunder Ancestor, preventing the Thunder Ancestor from suddenly becoming a guardian deity. The resulting immense power would have been overwhelming, potentially causing instability, or even the destruction, of his dantian.</p><p>He had to stabilize his dantian and accept the Thunder Ancestor to truly become his guardian deity, thus concealing the Earth-Slaying Sword's aura!</p><p>This wouldn't be accomplished overnight.</p><p>During this time, he might still be discovered.  With the Daoist sect's return to the Greater Thousand World being a pivotal moment, attracting much attention, the Daoist sect didn't want to be involved in more karmic entanglements or unforeseen complications, so they decided to send Qin Sang away.</p><p>His dantian was in turmoil again, adding to Qin Sang's troubles.</p><p>His face was pale as he struggled to stabilize his dantian.  He then noticed the Five Thunder Court Seal flashing with lightning, seemingly exhibiting unusual activity. He instinctively poured his consciousness into the seal, unable to appreciate its power, feeling a sense of relief.</p><p>The Five Thunder Court Seal and the Thunder Ancestor's divine intent clearly had a profound connection; it was a thunder deity seal, helping him stabilize his dantian, but this was only temporary. Qin Sang had to find a secluded cave dwelling to hide during this period.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang caught a glimpse of a beam of light shooting from the nearby clouds, which Zhang Tianshi caught in his sleeve.</p><p>"The Heavenly Patrol Chariot has been taken…"</p><p>As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw Zhang Tianshi press his hand down.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a gentle force envelop him.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Qin Sang cried inwardly, his eyes darting around.</p><p>At the critical moment, Qin Sang, with a swift move and a final burst of strength, drew the charred corpse of the black demonic peng towards her.  </p><p>Immediately, she felt an immense weight bearing down, causing her to fall uncontrollably.  There was no boundary of the divine court, no earth. Below was a seemingly endless abyss, a void of nothingness.</p><p>...</p><p>After seeing Qin Sang off, Grand Master Zhang looked up into the deep sky. The bloody thunder had not yet dissipated. A faint golden light pierced through the spatial storm, gradually forming a golden vortex in the deep sky. Then, a golden thread descended. As the thread extended from the vortex, it seemed to sense something, stopping abruptly, its tip swaying gently, as if hesitating.</p><p>Grand Master Zhang coldly snorted, raised his Daoist scriptures’ imperial seal, and with its inscribed golden characters, he slammed it into the vortex.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The vortex shattered. The golden thread snapped into pieces.  Simultaneously, Grand Master Zhang pointed his sword finger towards the heavens, drawing a line in the air, leaving a mark that pierced the celestial dome.  This single stroke actually broke through the celestial barrier!</p><p>With the finger mark as the center, a spatial storm erupted, the wind and clouds surging, thunder rolling, and dark clouds churning towards either side of the mark. It was as if he had opened a celestial gate.  Beyond the gate was an endless darkness, filled with terrifying storms. These storms were not only spatial storms; behind them lay an even more boundless darkness, emanating an aura similar to the Abyssal Origin and the Abyssal Sea, but even more chaotic and terrifying.  That was the Abyssal River, the Great Thousand World!</p><p>The divine court was exposed, impossible to conceal.  Rather than delay, it was better to directly open the celestial gate and enter the Great Thousand!</p><p>Grand Master Zhang, in his imperial chariot, flew to the celestial gate, seated on his imperial throne, the divine court beneath him. The divine court appeared, its starlight and golden light intertwined, wondrous and extraordinary, illuminating the four directions and eight extremes.  In the Abyssal Origin and Abyssal Sea, great calamities cowered in their lairs, trembling.</p><p>Daoist cultivators stared blankly at the heavens, at the crack in the sky. Those with high cultivation could see the imperial chariot beneath the crack, and the majestic figure on the imperial throne!</p><p>The heavens split open, the earth shook, mountains swayed, rivers turned, like the end of the world. It also looked as if Grand Master Zhang, piloting the divine court, was leveraging the earth, taking all the beings of this world with him, lifting the entire realm in ascension!</p><p>"Rumbling..."</p><p>Behind the celestial gate, a golden light quickly extinguished – it was the golden thread.</p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p>The golden thread was no match for the Daoist scriptures' imperial seal, but it did not completely retreat, leaving a segment behind in the distance, seeming to observe.</p><p>Just then, a brilliant light, thousands of meters long, suddenly appeared in the storm. Wherever the light passed, it swept away all darkness; the storm even showed signs of being suppressed, giving a sense of tranquility and peace.  Deep within the brilliant light, an eight-grade lotus platform slowly rotated, flying towards the celestial gate.</p><p>After the eight-grade lotus platform appeared, the golden thread stirred again.</p><p>Grand Master Zhang, seeing the platform, frowned, his face grave, clutching the Daoist scriptures' imperial seal, about to strike.  Suddenly, another blue light appeared in the distance, heading straight for the eight-grade lotus platform, eventually transforming into a jade ruyi (scepter) that struck the platform.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>The brilliant light scattered. The eight-grade lotus platform trembled slightly, hesitated for a moment, retracted its radiant light, and retreated into the depths of the darkness. The golden thread spun faster, seeming indecisive.  A subtle movement again came from the depths of the darkness.</p><p>Grand Master Zhang's eyes showed a different color as he looked towards the direction from which the blue light had come, and immediately saw an old man appearing, riding on a cloud.  The old man had white hair and beard, wearing a green Daoist robe, possessing a noble and ethereal demeanor, serene and natural.</p><p>The old Daoist recalled the jade ruyi into his hand, smiling at Grand Master Zhang.</p><p>Grand Master Zhang gripped the armrest of the imperial throne, looking at the old Daoist, bowed slightly, and asked in a low voice, "Are you a fellow Daoist from the Dan Ding sect?"</p><p>The old man nodded slightly, bowing his head, "Alas, since the collapse of the divine court, the symbols have lost their power. Now that the celestial gate is open and the divine court has returned, it is fortunate indeed. I am Dao Xuan, here to welcome the Grand Master!"</p><p>Having said that, the old man stood tall, singing loudly,</p><p>"The heavens tremble, our Dao rises!"</p><p>"Rumbling..."</p><p>It was like the resonance of the Great Dao!</p><p>Grand Master Zhang's eyes gleamed; he rose solemnly, returning the salute and singing along, "The heavens tremble, our Dao rises!"</p><p>The voice spread throughout the realm, heard by all.  The Daoist cultivators, their hearts surging, rested their swords on the ground, knelt on one knee, their expressions fervent, singing in unison,</p><p>"The heavens tremble, our Dao rises!"</p><p>"The heavens tremble, our Dao rises!"</p><p>...</p><p>The jade-like voices, resonant and earth-shaking!</p><p>...</p><p>"Whoosh whoosh whoosh!"</p><p>The wind howled in Qin Sang's ears. She continued to fall, as if there was no end to the depths below.  She seemed to have fallen into a black mist, surrounded on all sides by black fog without end. The black mist was not calm; it was full of turbulent currents.</p><p>"Is this the River of Woe?"</p><p>Qin Sang was lost and wandering when a light appeared in the distance, along with a figure.  Upon closer inspection, it was Tian Yue Shang Ren.</p><p>Tian Yue Shang Ren, his robe stained with blood, carried a divine sword on his back. He bowed slightly from a distance to Qin Sang.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Tian Yue Shang Ren turned and vanished into the mist.  Qin Sang struggled to call out to him, but the figure was gone in an instant.</p><p>The fall continued.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled ancient legends, feeling like a banished immortal condemned to the Nine Netherworlds. Even the legendary hellscape of the underworld couldn't compare to this.</p><p>The power of the Inner Lion Seal was rapidly fading; his condition worsening.  To make matters worse, the protective force around him was also dissipating.</p><p>If he were to be swept into the River of Woe, could he possibly survive until someone rescued him?</p><p>The black mist grew thicker, a suffocating silence, devoid of anything else, utterly hopeless.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was filled with anxiety...</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A faint sound came from behind. Qin Sang turned to see a dim light.</p><p>A small, light boat emerged from the black mist, a mast with a paper lantern atop it. The pale light from the lantern was eerily strange in the darkness.</p><p>A figure sat in the boat, head covered by a wide-brimmed hat, almost completely concealing their body.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the descent stop abruptly, realizing he was on the boat.</p><p>"Thank you, senior, for saving me."</p><p>Qin Sang steadied himself, enduring the pain, and bowed respectfully to the figure.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>After waiting a moment, Qin Sang looked up. The person sat motionless, the small boat speeding through the black mist.</p><p>Beneath the hat, it seemed empty, yet a black veil seemed to move, like a lonely ghost; certainly not a human.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the First Sword Servant's words: this mysterious person had existed for a very long time; no ordinary person could survive in the River of Woe for so long. It might not even be alive.</p><p>He dared not act rashly, staying quietly in place, finally able to observe his surroundings.</p><p>The boat traveled smoothly on the River of Woe, only the dim light of the paper lantern illuminating the way.  It was impossible to gauge the speed; Qin Sang didn't know how far they'd gone, the boat carrying him along an endless black river.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang saw something different.</p><p>Deep within the black mist, he saw a blue light.  Before he could focus, it vanished, fleetingly brief.  Yet, Qin Sang had caught a glimpse of its source: a vast blue sea, floating giant icebergs, emitting a radiant blue light.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang saw many sights incongruous with the black mist.</p><p>Worlds teeming with life, nurturing all creatures; humans, demons, and strange beings.</p><p>A silent, gray world of death.</p><p>A land of lava, yet countless fire spirits frolicked within it.</p><p>Similar water spirit worlds, wind spirit worlds…</p><p>Some densely packed, others sparse, some even connected.</p><p>Some newly born, others nearing their end.</p><p>Countless orbs floated at the edge of the River of Woe, each nurturing countless small worlds, most chaotic or dead, the closer they were to the river.</p><p>Seeing these strange sights, Qin Sang understood: these were countless small worlds, nurtured by the River of Woe!</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the long, dark shadow within the Abyss seen in the Storm World. Could that be the River of Woe's manifestation?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was captivated, he suddenly felt darkness before his eyes. The figure from the boat was standing before him.  His heart leaped, his hair stood on end. The First Sword Servant had not warned him of this.</p><p>Black veils hung from the edge of the hat, completely obscuring the person's body.</p><p>The hatted figure stood before Qin Sang, seemingly looking at him through the hat, silent.</p><p>The silence only heightened the eerieness, chilling Qin Sang to the bone.</p><p>Then Qin Sang realized he was facing his right hand; the figure wasn’t looking at him, but at his right hand.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang sensed a disturbance within his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>"It's Zhuoyu and the white chess piece!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately opened the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A flash of light, and two objects flew out.</p><p>A pale, bloodless hand, like a ghost's hand, reached from under the hat, gently holding them.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Zhuoyu shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled but dared not interfere, holding his breath. He was too weak to resist; he could only hope that this person would take the treasures and safely deliver him to the Greater World.</p><p>A black light shot from Zhuoyu – a black chess piece!</p><p>As soon as the black piece appeared, the white piece reacted; the two pieces attracted each other, swirling around one another.</p><p>The rotating pieces formed a Taiji symbol, yin and yang clearly defined.</p><p>The hatted figure seemed to gaze at the two chess pieces, then turned back to the bow of the boat, sitting as before, as if a soul.</p><p>Seeing the pieces about to fall, Qin Sang quickly caught them, looking at the figure.</p><p>"Senior…"</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, then his vision brightened.</p><p>The River of Woe, the boat, and the mysterious figure were gone.</p><p>Vast blue waters.</p><p>Peace and tranquility.</p><p>(Volume Six End!)</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>1.
