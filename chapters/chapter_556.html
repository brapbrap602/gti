Chapter 549: Qiu Mubai


These were not the most dangerous things.
What made Qin Sang most vigilant was the violent spiritual energy and chaotic world energy caused by the Spirit Surge.
Suddenly, a loud 'bang' followed by a cry of surprise came from behind.
Qin Sang turned around and saw a Foundation Establishment cultivator sprawled on the ground, his face flushed with embarrassment.  He wasn't the only one; many others stumbled and struggled to keep their balance.
Most of them were rogue cultivators.
Chen Kuqing then reminded them with a smirk, "Fellow Daoists, be mindful. Due to the Spirit Surge, the spiritual energy here is not as stable as within the inner regions.  Do not absorb too much at once, otherwise, you may not be able to refine it in time, causing spiritual energy disruption and temporary loss of combat ability. It's best to have ample spirit stones when engaging in battles within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield."
Why didn't this guy say so earlier!
The uninformed rogue cultivators glared at him. After enjoying the spectacle, Chen Kuqing instructed one of his junior brothers to lead the way and handed a jade slip to Qin Sang. "Brother Qin, this is a route map. The Skull Guard should be arriving soon; you should encounter them on the way."
"Thank you, Brother Chen."
Qin Sang showed the contents of the jade slip to everyone, looked around, and suggested, "Fellow Daoists, if you don't have other destinations, why don't we form a battle formation and travel together? If we encounter Cloud Beasts, we can help each other."
Everyone exchanged glances and agreed.
Qin Sang, with the highest cultivation level and experience fighting the Heavenly Mandate Alliance, methodically organized the group and set off towards Skull Pass.
The Spirit Surge was directly above them, forcing the group to fly at low altitude.
Even in its waning phase, the Spirit Surge still possessed heaven-shaking power.  Occasionally, it would release a surge of energy that crashed down, easily creating massive craters in the ground.
Its power was terrifying.
Qin Sang was protected in the center of the group. His responsibility was to constantly monitor the Spirit Surge above and the surroundings, adjusting their course to avoid danger. The journey was relatively smooth.
Fortunately, they didn't encounter any swarms of Cloud Beasts.
They traveled non-stop towards Skull Pass.  Suddenly, the person at the front shouted, "Daoist Qin, there's a black cloud flying towards us!"
Qin Sang had already spotted it. After carefully observing, his expression relaxed. "Don't panic, it's the Skull Guard."
The group cheered. The appearance of the Skull Guard indicated that the Cloud Beasts ahead had been cleared.
Even in the wilderness, there was no need to worry about the Skull Guard's intentions.  They had arrived via the Yuanqing Jinggong Sect's teleportation formation, and the sect vouched for them.
Qin Sang signaled the group to continue forward. As they approached, a voice echoed from within the black cloud, "The Cloud Beasts ahead have been cleared. Please proceed, fellow Daoists."
Before the voice faded, someone within the cloud excitedly called out, "Is that Junior Brother Qin?"
The voice was very familiar. Qin Sang immediately recognized it, stepped forward, and exclaimed in surprise, "Senior Brother Mu, when did you return from the Chaotic Islands?"
It was Mu Yifeng.
The black cloud parted, and two figures flew out. One was Mu Yifeng, and the other was a graceful and elegant young man.
"Junior Brother Qin, after you left, I took over your position as captain. Unfortunately, while engaging the traitors from the Heavenly Mandate Alliance, I was careless and suffered another serious injury. I was sent back to our sect to recover.  After my recovery, I found the truce in the Chaotic Islands rather boring.  Knowing that the Spirit Surge was ending soon, I came directly to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield."
Mu Yifeng scratched his head, his tone apologetic.
Qin Sang had led the team for many years without major incidents. After entrusting it to him for just a few days, Mu Yifeng had been ambushed by the Heavenly Mandate Alliance, nearly costing the lives of all his subordinates.
If he hadn't desperately brought everyone back alive, he would have been ashamed to face Qin Sang, his savior.
After learning the details, Qin Sang understood that it wasn't Mu Yifeng's fault.
He had risked his own life to bring everyone back, which was truly commendable and could be considered righteous and selfless.
Qin Sang was even more surprised by Mu Yifeng's cultivation level.  He had reached the False Core Realm!
How many years had it been?
Mu Yifeng, who was once critically injured, had benefited from misfortune and greatly increased his cultivation.  This time, his injuries had directly led to a breakthrough to the False Core Realm.
"Senior Brother Mu, I've heard of breakthroughs through slaughter, breakthroughs through combat, but I've never heard of breakthroughs through injury! Could it be you cultivate the Path of Injury?" Qin Sang teased.
Mu Yifeng laughed, "I don't know why, but every time I lie in bed recovering, I always have a sudden flash of inspiration. I'm wondering if I should try a life-or-death situation to achieve Core Formation. Don't encourage me, Junior Brother Qin! By the wayâ€¦"
Mu Yifeng's expression turned serious as he gestured towards the young man beside him. "Junior Brother Qin, this is Senior Brother Qiu Mubai. You probably haven't met."
"Although we haven't met, I've heard so much about Junior Brother Qin," Qiu Mubai greeted with a cupped-hand salute, his tone pleasant. "Meeting you today, you truly live up to your reputation!"
It's him!
Qin Sang's mind flashed, recalling this person's identity.
He was one of those rare disciples who rarely appeared in public and were not well-known outside but had countless legends within their sect.
Qiu Mubai wasn't a disciple of a Core Formation cultivator, but his status was even higher. He had been granted permission by Nascent Soul Patriarch Dongyang Bo to cultivate on Shaohua Mountain's main peak!
Qiu Mubai had joined the sect more than ten years before Qin Sang. He had been favored by Dongyang Bo since infancy.
It was said that Qiu Mubai could have reached Core Formation long ago, but for unknown reasons, he remained in the False Core Realm, honing his cultivation and delaying his breakthrough.
"Greetings, Senior Brother Qiu!"
Dongyang Bo hadn't officially taken Qiu Mubai as his disciple, so they still addressed each other according to the sect's rules for peers.
Even Core Formation cultivators treated disciples of Nascent Soul Patriarchs with respect, so Qin Sang naturally wouldn't be impolite.
Upon their first meeting, Qiu Mubai's demeanor suggested he was a modest gentleman, giving off a gentle and refined impression. Qin Sang was unsure of his true character and observed him cautiously.
After some conversation, Qin Sang learned that after Qiu Mubai finished his secluded cultivation, he came to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to serve as a Skull Guard. This time, he was leading the team to clear the Cloud Beasts.
"We still have duties to attend to and can't delay too long. Junior Brother Qin, you might want to go ahead. We can catch up later when we return to Skull Pass," Qiu Mubai said.
Qin Sang considered for a moment, then took out his Skull Guard token. "Senior Brother Qiu, I came here to report for duty with the Skull Guard. Since I've encountered the Skull Guard clearing Cloud Beasts, it's my duty to assist. I'd like to accompany you both."
"We'd be delighted if Junior Brother Qin would lend us a hand!"
Qiu Mubai and Mu Yifeng were overjoyed and readily agreed.
Qin Sang had his own considerations.
Qiu Mubai, as Dongyang Bo's most favored disciple, must know him very well.
After returning from the Ziwei Palace, Qin Sang would have a private audience with Dongyang Bo.
Getting closer to Qiu Mubai and inquiring about Dongyang Bo's temperament would allow him to prepare accordingly.
This wasn't just his future master but a Nascent Soul Patriarch with absolute authority.
Qin Sang didn't expect to gain Dongyang Bo's favor, but he also didn't want to act ignorantly and commit any taboos, incurring the wrath of this Patriarch.
