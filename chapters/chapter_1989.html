<h1>Chapter 1980:  Life and Death Reversal</h1><p>The White Tiger's ferocity wasn't the end, but merely the beginning!</p><p>The Southern Vermilion Bird sword formation and the Western White Tiger sword formation appeared simultaneously, filling the sky with starlight, as if a real night sky had been brought here.</p><p>In fact, the stars within the formations did correspond to the Western White Tiger constellation and the Southern Vermilion Bird constellation.  However, trying to break the formations by relying on the real star chart would be a grave mistake, inevitably leading into the enemy's trap.</p><p>Grandmaster Ming Hu could see through it at a glance.  The formations imitated the celestial constellations, but the key was that breaking them didn't rely on understanding this celestial imitation.</p><p>The myriad stars seemed to converge on Grandmaster Ming Hu.</p><p>Suspended in the star sea, alone and vulnerable, his expression darkened.</p><p>The technique of "Limitless Corpse Movement" might not be truly limitless.</p><p>Once the chart of the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Constellations was complete, what power would the formations possess?</p><p>Currently, only the Vermilion Bird and White Tiger, fourteen constellations in total, were visible. Was this the limit of the array's master, or were they gradually depleting their own power?</p><p>Grandmaster Ming Hu felt a surge of anger, the feeling of being treated like a plaything, manipulated at someone else's whim.</p><p>He hadn't felt this way in a long time, but this anger didn't cloud his judgment.  His cold gaze swept towards the edge of the star sea.</p><p>At the edge of the star sea, faint starlight flickered, hinting at a lingering power.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly didn't intend to give him much time to think.  A tiger's roar echoed through the cosmos.  Where the starlight was brightest, a white tiger materialized, strolling leisurely among the stars, its gaze—fierce and murderous—fixed on Grandmaster Ming Hu.</p><p>Harmonizing with the tiger's roar, a long cry echoed from the south.</p><p>It was an attempt to mimic a phoenix's call, yet it lacked the sacredness and aloofness of a phoenix, sounding more like a self-important fire crow.</p><p>Its power was considerable nonetheless.</p><p>The starlight seemed to ignite, a raging inferno consuming half the sky, sweeping away the darkness.</p><p>From the heart of the fire, a Vermilion Bird was born.</p><p>Majestic and awe-inspiring, it was the embodiment of a fire-controlling divine bird.  It complemented the ferocious White Tiger perfectly.</p><p>However, the Vermilion Bird's eyes darted around, its expression cunning, somewhat undermining its majesty, which explained the strange sound it had made.</p><p>But precisely because of this, this Vermilion Bird possessed a spirit the White Tiger lacked.</p><p>Grandmaster Ming Hu acutely perceived the difference between the two.  Just as he was about to observe more closely, the ground beneath him was illuminated by firelight.</p><p>The auras of the two sacred beasts rapidly approached from above, sharp to the extreme.</p><p>Grandmaster Ming Hu instantly felt as if his body was being pierced.</p><p>They didn't feel like two sacred beasts; rather, they were two incredibly sharp spirit swords, fiercely stabbing at him.</p><p>Grandmaster Ming Hu knew he had to defeat these two beasts to break the formation.  The enemy had seized the initiative, and his situation hadn't improved at all.</p><p>However, his earlier use of Limitless Corpse Movement wasn't entirely without effect.</p><p>A faint, ethereal light appeared on Grandmaster Ming Hu's forehead, his features suddenly stiffening.</p><p>His body was covered in wounds from the continuous battles, yet his face remained unscathed.</p><p>His rigid features, his murderous sneer, and his withered skin made him look like a skull covered in a layer of skin, a bizarre and eerie sight.</p><p>The ethereal light on his forehead rapidly changed, revealing a winding rune.  A clear outline then appeared around the rune, resembling a death tablet used in funeral rites!</p><p>The tablet, bulging and dark red, looked wooden at first glance, but on closer inspection, it possessed a gemstone-like luster.</p><p>Qin Sang, high in the heavens, saw the tablet and felt a sense of foreboding.  It was far more threatening than the ever-burning lamp and was undoubtedly a treasured item of Grandmaster Ming Hu.</p><p>The tablet detached from Grandmaster Ming Hu's forehead, spinning in front of him before expanding in the wind.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a hundred-zhang-high stele, incredibly heavy.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>At that moment, the Vermilion Bird and White Tiger were close at hand. The Vermilion Bird's flames engulfed Grandmaster Ming Hu in a sea of fire.</p><p>The two ferocious beasts attacked him from both sides!</p><p>The sword formation's power erupted without reservation, testing the results of Qin Sang's many years of cultivation through this incorruptible bone.</p><p>The tiger's roar and the phoenix's cry shook the heavens and earth.</p><p>The two sacred beasts displayed unparalleled ferocity, as if intent on tearing apart this world.</p><p>Grandmaster Ming Hu bore the brunt of the attack.  His eyes flashed, and the void violently trembled.</p><p>The source of the tremor was the stele.</p><p>The spirit tablet trembled slightly, ripples visible to the naked eye appearing in the void, revealing its immense weight.  A strike could pulverize a mountain; on a person, it would leave only a smear.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu grasped the tablet's base, fingers locked tight, and swung it with force.  In his hands, the tablet felt weightless, like a mere door, brutally smashing into the enemy.</p><p>It was hard to believe that a battle between cultivators of this level would be so simple and brutal. Yet, its power was unmatched by any spell or technique.  Subtle ripples emanated from the tablet's surface, like flickering dark thunder, or cracks in the void itself. No one doubted its ability to shatter any enemy.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A fierce wind erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang "heard" the Vermillion Bird squawking, attempting a desperate retreat. The foolish bird truly believed these cultivators were easily dealt with. Earlier, upon hearing Qin Sang's request for its assistance, it had been ecstatic.</p><p>If not for its integration into the sword array, the tablet's strike would have instantly obliterated the Vermillion Bird and its flames.  Now, escape was impossible.</p><p>Ignoring the Vermillion Bird's heart-wrenching screams, Qin Sang relentlessly pushed the sword technique.  A shower of shooting stars filled the starlit sea; constellations shifted, leaving brilliant trails. Each star was dazzling, all the sword array's power channeled by Qin Sang into the two sacred beasts.</p><p>Facing the oncoming tablet, the Vermillion Bird and White Tiger stood firm, charging directly.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>Were it not for the Heavenly Pit being sealed by the sword array, the impact would have been even more terrifying than previous clashes. The resulting storm engulfed Old Ancestor Ming Hu and the two sacred beasts. The starlight above wavered.</p><p>The three figures separated instantly. The White Tiger and Vermillion Bird flew back to the heavens, seemingly knocked away by the tablet's force.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird spread its wings, tracing a graceful arc in the void, its eyes a mixture of shock and rage. The White Tiger looked far more dishevelled, tumbling several times before regaining its footing, roaring towards below.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu retreated even further, the tablet bouncing back, nearly striking his chest. A muffled grunt escaped his lips.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird, unleashing a torrent of curses at Qin Sang, joined the White Tiger in a renewed assault.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu could only repeatedly swing the tablet, with ferocious power, swatting them like flies. But these were no ordinary flies; each strike was imbued with terrifying sword intent.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu was slowly cornered.</p><p>Though seemingly gaining the upper hand, Qin Sang remained unsatisfied.  Between sword maneuvers, he stirred the dantian and magic cores within him.</p><p>Before any thunder appeared, its power permeated the sword array. Then, a lightning bolt pierced the starlit sea, revealing a lightning talisman – the Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu immediately sensed the shift. He wasn't surprised by the enemy’s additional tactics.  If that had been their full arsenal, once he regained his footing, he might have turned the tide.  But the opponent's mastery of thunder magic, inherently potent and effective against undead and demonic entities, left him no room for complacency.</p><p>His eyelids drooped slightly. Old Ancestor Ming Hu delivered a powerful blow, forcing back the White Tiger and Vermillion Bird. His hair stood on end, grey corpse energy swirling behind his head.</p><p>With a twist, a young face materialized on the back of his head, a stark contrast to his own, yet bearing a family resemblance, like a youthful version of Old Ancestor Ming Hu. A pair of icy eyes opened, fixed on the heavens above.</p><p>Regardless of how Old Ancestor Ming Hu moved, those eyes remained locked on the sky as he battled the two sacred beasts.</p><p>The Jade Pure Summoning Thunder Talisman unleashed countless lightning bolts, a massive net weaving through the stars.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>A lightning bolt struck Old Ancestor Ming Hu.</p><p>Sacred beasts encircled, heaven's thunder descended!</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu's second eye abruptly transformed into a black demonic pupil, emitting a tangible gaze, a dark thunder strike.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Dark and heavenly thunder collided, scattering electric sparks.  Then, the downpour of thunder was entirely absorbed by the demonic pupil's dark thunder, causing Old Ancestor Ming Hu little trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang followed up with the Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning and Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal Talismans.</p><p>The three combined; thunder and fire filled the sky, almost eclipsing the starlight.</p><p>The Elder Minghu finally felt the pressure. He produced a jade, which the face on the back of his head swallowed.</p><p>This jade radiated chilling coldness, having absorbed an immense amount of Yin energy; it was a Yin jade.</p><p>Holding the jade, the power of the Yin lightning dramatically increased.  Facing the suspended Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal, it met the attack head-on, forming a Yin pool around Elder Minghu.</p><p>Heavenly thunder bombarded the pool, which seemed on the verge of collapse, yet proved surprisingly resilient.</p><p>Finally, Elder Minghu crushed the jade, releasing an immense amount of Yin energy into the pool.</p><p>Even then, Elder Minghu retreated constantly, but Qin Sang still couldn't inflict a fatal blow.</p><p>"Dealing with a seasoned Void Refinement cultivator, I'm still lacking,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>In truth, the Four Symbols Sword Array and Daoist techniques held powerful legacies, surpassing Elder Minghu's.</p><p>If Qin Sang had mastered one skill thoroughly, this battle would have been much easier, and a level-crossing victory might have been possible.</p><p>But what he lacked was time!</p><p>Qingyuan had taught him the "Palm Thunder Observation" technique. If he'd patiently cultivated it and created a Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal talisman using Azure Luan True Thunder, Elder Minghu would likely have fled.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang judged the sword array more effective and focused his energy on mastering it.</p><p>"Enough…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Forcing Elder Minghu to this point with two half-mastered techniques left him satisfied.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed.  Simultaneously, Zhuque screamed in agony, "Qin! Release me! I'm dying! I'm dying!"</p><p>Zhuque's panic was genuine.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a similar foreboding, his eyes narrowed, fixated on Elder Minghu, who was emitting an unusual aura.</p><p>Elder Minghu kept retreating but couldn't find a weakness in his opponent.  He knew he couldn't continue; otherwise, if the other party joined forces with Gu Yun Old Man, he'd be concerned not about defeat, but about his life!</p><p>Life-Death Reversal Wheel!</p><p>The two faces, two mouths, simultaneously moved, their lips forming what seemed like identical incantations.</p><p>At the same time, a circular wheel-shaped phantom appeared above Elder Minghu's head.</p><p>The wheel was half black, half white, mirroring the front and back of Elder Minghu's body—white in front, black behind.  The withered face in front represented his current life; the youthful face on the back, his past death.</p><p>Life and death, a mysterious cycle.</p><p>Life-Death Reversal Wheel!</p><p>This was the profound technique Elder Minghu had cultivated for years. As it was still incomplete, activating it required considerable preparation.</p><p>Even so, Qin Sang and Zhuque felt a tremendous threat.</p><p>The distinct black and white wheel became clearer, slowly rotating. The slow speed, however, affected both Qin Sang and Zhuque’s minds.</p><p>It seemed like not only the wheel was reversing, but their lives as well!</p><p>Once life and death reversed, the technique would unleash its full power.</p><p>Zhuque was truly terrified.  If drawn into the Life-Death Reversal Wheel, it might not even know how it died.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath,</p><p>thinking inwardly that seasoned Void Refinement cultivators were indeed deeply rooted and formidable.</p><p>He wouldn't clash directly with Elder Minghu using the sword array.</p><p>This prolonged fight served only to gauge his own strength. The Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal was merely a distraction; his true killing move was yet to come!</p><p>With a thought, Baihu and Zhuque ceased their attack, returning to the star sea, merging into the stars.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang retreated during the battle.</p><p>Elder Minghu assumed his opponent feared his technique, deciding to retreat.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the starlight and lightning above not only didn't dissipate but expanded, absorbing nebulae.</p><p>The star sea was vast, capable of containing the Four Symbols and Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions.</p><p>Moreover, as the star sea expanded, the sword array underwent an inexplicable change.</p><p>…</p><p>"Clang!"</p><p>Gu Yun Old Man's chess piece fell on the board, his face filled with shock.</p><p>"Sword Domain!"</p><p>For the first time, he showed clear signs of losing his composure.</p><p>He hadn’t lost his composure when he saw Xiao Wu or Qin Sang's Dharma Body; he'd remained calm, playing chess with Qin Sang.</p><p>He'd been using a delaying tactic, observing from the sidelines whether he should intervene while Qin Sang's Dharma Body and Elder Minghu battled.</p><p>The allure of the蟠龙天柱 (Panlong Heavenly Pillar) was too great.  Rather than letting someone monopolize it, he considered joining forces with the old zombie, dividing it between them.</p><p>But the fluctuations emanating from the battlefield changed his mind.</p><p>A Dharma Domain, a profound technique only attainable at the Unity Refinement stage.</p><p>Although he was a Dharma Body, his true form remained at the sect. However, once pulled into a Dharma Domain, the "Return to Source and True Self" technique would be useless.  If his Dharma Body were destroyed, his true form could only survive with difficulty.</p><p>He had only heard rumors of Dharma Domains, but the knowledge was enough to shock him.</p><p>The cultivator before him, clearly only at the initial stage of Void Refinement, possessed a Dharma Domain.</p><p>Also at the initial stage of Void Refinement, he had spent years stagnating, nearing the midpoint of Void Refinement, yet he had not even discovered the path, let alone where the 'door' to the Dharma Domain lay.</p><p>Gu Yun Old Man was terrified and cold; was some powerful being playing a joke on him?</p><p>…</p><p>Creating a Sword Domain with the sword array was merely one part of the plan.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly changed his hand seals, his gaze turning south.</p><p>Qingyang Temple!</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The thunder altar, which had remained silent, suddenly shook violently, its power sweeping across the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang finally activated the last thunder restriction.</p><p>A supremely dazzling beam of lightning shot towards the heavens.</p>
