<h1>Chapter 1513: The Fall of Demons and Fiends (4k)</h1><p>The moment Qin Sang activated the Exquisite Pagoda, the mist at the edge of the Stele Space immediately ceased its expansion.</p><p>Like a receding tide, the mist surged back, even faster than it had spread, growing increasingly thin!</p><p>Some kind of transformation was brewing.</p><p>There were no obvious anomalies within the space itself.</p><p>However, the assembled demons and fiends were currently gathered before the Exquisite Pagoda. Even through the golden barrier of light, they could sense the changes within the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>Those with keen spiritual senses ceased their attacks, an ominous premonition rising in their hearts, filled with shock and uncertainty.</p><p>The demons and fiends had witnessed Qin Sang and Liuli entering the barrier of light, holding the Stupa Pagoda.</p><p>They had various speculations about the Stupa Pagoda's function, but how could they give up before the final moment?</p><p>Even if Qin Sang could become the master of the Exquisite Pagoda, he couldn't possibly defeat so many experts with a single treasure. As long as they broke through the golden barrier of light and entered the Exquisite Pagoda, they would have a chance to turn the tide and seize the supreme treasure.</p><p>It seemed they had thought too simply...</p><p>The halo emanating from the Exquisite Pagoda grew brighter and brighter. Although the golden barrier of light obscured most of its radiance, it still illuminated the surrounding clouds with iridescent colors. The demons and fiends seemed to be coated in a layer of rainbow light.</p><p>Sensing something, the demons and fiends raised their heads to look at the jewel at the top of the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>Rainbow light flickered, and the halo emitted an unknown fluctuation.</p><p>The sense of danger originated precisely from this fluctuation.</p><p>The fluctuation, invisible and formless, passed through the golden barrier of light, diffused, and finally merged with the entire Stele Space.</p><p>The space itself did not change. Those outside were oblivious, but the demons and fiends could clearly feel that the Exquisite Pagoda had transformed!</p><p>At this moment, the Exquisite Pagoda seemed to have merged with the space, becoming inseparable.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda *was* the Stele Space, and the Stele Space was *within* the Exquisite Pagoda!</p><p>This feeling was too absurd. The demons and fiends were incredulous, suspecting it was an illusion. They looked around, only to find that everyone else wore the same expression.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Exquisite Pagoda's aura surged steadily. The not-so-tall pagoda seemed to grow continuously in their eyes, becoming increasingly majestic, like a towering mountain they could only look up to!</p><p>"This is..."</p><p>The Grand Sage Sky-Roc's eyes flashed with brilliant light, his expression drastically changing. "Quick, stop him!"</p><p>The demons and fiends understood the Grand Sage Sky-Roc's meaning. They no longer dared to hold back, unleashing their most potent abilities, attacking the golden barrier of light like madmen.</p><p>At this moment, the golden light and the iridescent halo were shattered. The area before the Exquisite Pagoda became a terrifying battlefield.</p><p>The Grand Sage Sky-Roc released the Golden Peng again.</p><p>Bi Fang reignited his Bloodflame Secret Technique.</p><p>The body of General Gui, positioned further back, extended a thin black thread from his glabella, connecting to his puppet.</p><p>The puppet was a perfect replica of General Gui. It employed some unknown, sinister technique, its entire body plastered against the golden barrier of light, as if trying to merge with it.</p><p>...</p><p>One secret technique after another, one divine power after another, one magical treasure after another, one secret treasure after another, various colors of treasure light converged, collided, and erupted, then strangely vanished in unison, turning the surrounding area into a zone of darkness.</p><p>Inside the darkness, the figures of the demons and fiends had disappeared, harboring terrible danger.</p><p>The golden barrier of light, assailed by the darkness, was on the verge of collapse, but it could not be broken in an instant.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda, however, would not wait for them. In a mere moment, it transformed from an unattainable mountain into the 'Heavens', covering the four directions, crushing the demons and fiends until they could barely breathe, bringing endless terror.</p><p>The transformation had come too quickly.</p><p>They had only managed a single wave of attacks before the situation had deteriorated to this point. Their gazes towards the Exquisite Pagoda were now filled with horror.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi had made various arrangements to prevent the demon lords from detecting the threat prematurely and escaping before the spirit array erupted.</p><p>In fact, the spirit array's activation was not slow. What Xiao Xiangzi called 'slow' was relative to himself and the demon lords.</p><p>Finally, some demons and fiends couldn't bear it any longer. They were unwilling to gamble their lives on breaking through the barrier of light before the danger descended.</p><p>One of them let out a roar, pulled back, and fled without looking back towards the valley's exit.</p><p>This individual's action alerted the others, becoming the starting point.</p><p>In an instant, several figures disappeared into the clouds, and more and more chose to give up.</p><p>Even the Grand Sage Sky-Roc, stomping his feet and roaring furiously, could not reverse the situation and had to give up.</p><p>Before leaving, the Grand Sage Sky-Roc cast a gloomy gaze at the Exquisite Pagoda, his eyes coldly fixed on Qin Sang and Liuli, memorizing their appearances.</p><p>In the deep valley, the demons and fiends employed their various divine powers, fleeing at top speed.</p><p>The fastest demon and fiend rushed out of the deep valley, saw the scene outside, his expression changed dramatically, and his face was filled with terror.</p><p>At this moment, they almost couldn't recognize the Stele Space.</p><p>Above the space, rainbow light permeated, and a blurry phantom could faintly be seen. Upon closer inspection, they discovered it was the shadow of a gigantic pagoda.</p><p>The size of this pagoda was unimaginable. It pierced the firmament, and the entire Stele Space was within the pagoda.</p><p>"So, it wasn't an illusion after all!"</p><p>This thought arose in the minds of the demons and fiends in unison.</p><p>At the same time, they finally understood the function of the Exquisite Pagoda. It was going to capture them all in one fell swoop!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Two consecutive, earth-shattering sounds.</p><p>One was behind them. Without turning around, they knew it came from the Exquisite Pagoda.</p><p>A streak of rainbow light pierced through the clouds, broke free from the chains, rushed towards the sky, and quickly merged with the pagoda's shadow.</p><p>The other sound came from the left side of the deep valley.</p><p>That place was considered the core of the Stele Space, the location of the most magnificent and mysterious palace within the entire space â€” the Yong'an Pavilion!</p><p>All signs indicated that the Yong'an Pavilion was the place where the master of the Stele Space cultivated, and also the place most likely to contain treasures.</p><p>At the beginning of their entry into the Stele Space, the demons and fiends had been drawn to the Yong'an Pavilion.</p><p>Despite being well-informed and experienced, they were all awestruck when they saw the palace complex, which rivaled an Immortal Palace. Naturally, it was their first choice for exploration.</p><p>There were still demons and fiends remaining in the Yong'an Pavilion, but they would never be able to leave.</p><p>Because Xiao Xiangzi's focus was precisely on the Yong'an Pavilion!</p><p>The original plan was to activate the spirit array when the demon lords entered the Yong'an Pavilion.</p><p>That place was indeed the core, but it was the core of the trap.</p><p>The towering palaces, at this moment, came to life, themselves a part of the grand array, all pressing inwards, shadows overlapping.</p><p>The Exquisite Pagoda triggered the spirit array, suppressing everything within.</p><p>The Yong'an Pavilion bore the brunt, but the entire space could not escape.</p><p>The demons and fiends felt as if they were carrying a great mountain, making movement within the Stele Space extremely difficult.</p><p>At the edge of the Stele Space.</p><p>Some figures fled outwards in a panic. Each and every Nascent Soul Ancestor's expression carried a rare look of terror and urgency. They were the cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace, including Tong Lingyu.</p><p>After receiving Liuli's warning, the others had initially harbored some doubts and hesitation. It was Tong Lingyu and Palace Master Jiang who had overruled the objections.</p><p>Now, they were only filled with relief.</p><p>Only after rushing out of the Stele Space did they dare to turn back. Through the gradually thinning mist, they were shocked by the scene before them.</p><p>The Stele Space, mountains and rivers shaking.</p><p>Streaks of profound light soared into the sky, with the Yong'an Pavilion being the most conspicuous.</p><p>Above the sky, rainbow light erupted, spreading out, reaching everywhere. An Exquisite Pagoda expanded at a visible speed, descending with terrifying might.</p><p>Judging by its momentum, it was going to suppress the entire space!</p><p>Everyone held their breath, their faces stunned.</p><p>"Where are Liuli and the others?" Elder Mei swiftly scanned the surroundings.</p><p>Palace Master Jiang's face was ashen.</p><p>They had received Liuli's warning and were the first to perceive the danger. Why were Liuli and her husband nowhere to be seen?</p><p>Tong Lingyu's delicate eyebrows furrowed, searching everywhere within the Stele Space.</p><p>At this moment, someone nearby discovered something. His expression changed slightly. He raised his hand and pointed, shouting, "Look over there!"</p><p>Where this person pointed, streaks of escaping light rushed out one after another. One of them, a golden light like an arrow, was none other than the Grand Sage Sky-Roc!</p><p>More and more escaping lights rushed out.</p><p>They were all famous demons and fiends of the North Sea.</p><p>The demons and fiends, who once dominated their domains and were full of might, now lost their dignity. Each one wore an expression of panic, no different from ants struggling for survival.</p><p>Even a top-tier expert like the Grand Sage Sky-Roc lost his usual composure, looking at the gigantic pagoda rapidly descending from above.</p><p>A long howl.</p><p>The Golden Peng surrounding the Grand Sage Sky-Roc shattered, absorbed by the feathers on the Grand Sage Sky-Roc's body. His speed increased dramatically, quickly surpassing everyone else.</p><p>Judging by the speed of the Exquisite Pagoda's descent, perhaps only the few with the fastest escape techniques had a chance to escape.</p><p>The demons and fiends behind them only regretted their inferior escape techniques, their faces filled with despair.</p><p>Some demonic cultivators abandoned their physical bodies, attempting to use their Nascent Soul's teleportation divine power. Unexpectedly, as soon as the Nascent Soul appeared, it felt a strange impact, stiffening in place. The teleportation technique was forcibly interrupted.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Tong Lingyu and the others exchanged glances. Without needing to discuss, they knew what to do.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace was in a precarious state. Now was a heaven-sent opportunity to eliminate their great enemies.</p><p>If they missed this chance, they would have cultivated for so many years in vain. They immediately, and secretly, brought out their magical treasures, preparing for battle.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The space shook violently. The Exquisite Pagoda was already close at hand.</p><p>The shadow of the Exquisite Pagoda enveloped all the demons and fiends.</p><p>Their heads could almost touch the bottom of the pagoda.</p><p>The Grand Sage Sky-Roc's speed reached its limit, like a golden bolt of lightning, tearing through the void, producing a thunderous roar.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu shouted in a low voice. The cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace suddenly rushed out from hiding.</p><p>A verdant sword light slashed fiercely. The Green Firmament Sword was unleashed!</p><p>The magical treasures of the others followed closely, most of their targets aligned with Tong Lingyu's.</p><p>The Grand Sage Sky-Roc!</p><p>The Grand Sage Sky-Roc's eyes instantly turned crimson.</p><p>"I will slaughter your entire sect!"</p><p>The Grand Sage Sky-Roc roared like thunder, his gaze like a blade, shooting out bone-deep hatred and killing intent.</p><p>Tong Lingyu sneered, unfazed by the threat, unwavering.</p><p>The Green Firmament Sword shone with myriad lights, its sword momentum earth-shattering, taking its transformations to the extreme.</p><p>If it were only the Green Firmament Sword, the Grand Sage Sky-Roc might have had a slim chance of survival, but there were no ifs.</p><p>The attacks of the others followed closely, blocking all of the Grand Sage Sky-Roc's escape routes.</p><p>"You deserve to die!"</p><p>The Grand Sage Sky-Roc's cry was extremely shrill. He was supposed to rule the North Sea, yet he was about to die here inexplicably. How could he be willing?</p><p>His body trembled, essence blood burned, and countless feathers and golden light flew out, like a great sun.</p><p>The light of the Green Firmament Sword was actually overshadowed.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's cultivation was slightly inferior, but she was not lacking in helpers. The attacks of the others immediately pressed down.</p><p>The magical treasures of the Profound Heaven Palace cultivators were also different, but they generally did not deviate from the path of Profound Ice.</p><p>The combined attacks of everyone formed a pale blue icy river, vast and mighty, rushing head-on, quickly submerging the golden light.</p><p>Even someone as strong as the Grand Sage Sky-Roc could not withstand the premeditated interception. He was forcefully pushed back, unable to advance an inch. His hope of escape was completely cut off!</p><p>Bi Fang and other demons shared the same fate as the Grand Sage Sky-Roc.</p><p>Bi Fang used a self-harming secret technique to escape. He had once escaped from Qin Sang, so his speed was naturally not slow.</p><p>But after pledging allegiance to the Grand Sage Sky-Roc, he had to exert himself and was already remembered by the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Bi Fang felt a blur before his eyes. Palace Master Jiang's Ice Jade Cauldron smashed towards him. He was in the midst of using an overdraft secret technique and had no time to react. With a 'bang', he was sent flying backward, leaving behind a desperate shriek.</p><p>...</p><p>While blocking the demons and fiends, Tong Lingyu and the others did not forget to search for Qin Sang and Liuli, but to no avail.</p><p>Suddenly, Tong Lingyu's expression shifted slightly. She raised her right hand, and a hexagonal treasure mirror slid down from her sleeve.</p><p>The treasure mirror was only half the size of a palm, with a slightly convex circular mirror surface in the middle.</p><p>Tong Lingyu held the mirror and shone it into the distance. It actually illuminated a figure from the void.</p><p>It was Old Demon Hun!</p><p>Before the Exquisite Pagoda, the old demon had been severely injured by Qin Sang and felt a prickling sensation on his back.</p><p>He had made many enemies and worried about being taken advantage of. He retreated to heal first, intending to find an opportunity after suppressing his injuries. Unexpectedly, this misfortune turned into a blessing.</p><p>In his current state, if he hadn't retreated early, he would never have been able to escape to this place.</p><p>He had intended to escape while the Profound Heaven Palace was besieging the Grand Sage Sky-Roc, but he was still discovered.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's expression changed slightly. She unhesitatingly redirected the Green Firmament Sword, abandoning her original target and aiming at Old Demon Hun.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace was currently in a period of weakness. The fewer major cultivators outside, the better. Moreover, Old Demon Hun was the main culprit of this invasion of the Sacred Land.</p><p>Old Demon Hun was startled. He hurriedly raised his black bamboo staff and pointed it at the Green Firmament Sword. Demonic light erupted.</p><p>A 'bang' sound.</p><p>The verdant sword light pierced into the demonic light.</p><p>Old Demon Hun held the black bamboo staff. A cloud of black energy surged on his wrinkled face. The black bamboo staff shook, flew out of his hand, transformed into a Heaven-upholding giant staff, and smashed down fiercely.</p><p>He himself flashed repeatedly, preparing to take the opportunity to escape.</p><p>But Elder Mei had also received the warning long ago. She abandoned her own opponent and cooperated with Tong Lingyu to deal with Old Demon Hun.</p><p>'Crack, crack, crack...'</p><p>Ice crystals rapidly condensed, forming a thick ice wall in front of Old Demon Hun in the blink of an eye.</p><p>And there were others attacking from the sides.</p><p>Old Demon Hun, having lost his ghost spirit, finally experienced what it meant to be at the end of his rope.</p><p>...</p><p>In a series of shrieks filled with despair and unwillingness, the Exquisite Pagoda crashed down!</p><p>The clouds and mist churned, like rising dust.</p><p>Old Demon Hun, the Grand Sage Sky-Roc, and a host of demons and fiends were all suppressed at the bottom of the pagoda!</p><p>Tong Lingyu and the others stared closely at those major threats. To ensure that nothing went wrong, it was inevitable that some fish would slip through the net. However, very few demons and fiends escaped.</p><p>These demons and fiends did not dare to look back, fearing being surrounded and killed by the Profound Heaven Palace. They immediately fled into the turbulent flow, including Old Demon Hun's eldest disciple.</p><p>He did not choose to save his master, but fled alone.</p><p>At the last moment when the Exquisite Pagoda crashed down, Old Demon Hun's eyes stiffened, quickly covered with a layer of pale white.</p><p>At the same time, a black shadow suddenly appeared in the black pupils of the eldest disciple, looking extremely similar to Old Demon Hun.</p><p>The eldest disciple's expression stiffened for a moment, then instantly regained its liveliness. He sneered, "Thank you for your love, Master, but I'm afraid I can't accept it."</p><p>As he spoke, a teardrop fell from the corner of the eldest disciple's eye, as if a thin membrane had been shed, forming a teardrop. It was originally a strange treasure.</p><p>Inside the crystal-clear teardrop, a small figure was sealed, frantically striking the teardrop, emitting a silent roar.</p><p>The eldest disciple revealed a relieved expression and flipped his hand, putting away the teardrop.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Thank you to the big boss Qizhi Youzou for the alliance master reward.</p>
