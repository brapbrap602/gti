<h1>Chapter 1891: Enthroned Upon the Divine Altar</h1><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>A silver serpent of lightning, cleaving through the immortal clouds of the Ninth Heaven, expanded rapidly within Qin Sang’s eyes.  Boundless divine might descended with the thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes widened, his entire body stiffening, his blood congealing as a primal tremor coursed through him.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Two gusts of malevolent wind rushed at him from behind, the Azure Scaled Serpent and the Black Roc.</p><p>The two demons, noticing Qin Sang had ceased his escape, standing motionless, seemingly stunned by the upheaval within the Thunder City, knew that something had shifted in the realm below.  Yet, they were desperate, willing to risk their lives.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Divine Chariot of Heavenly Inspection represented their only hope.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment they moved, the Thunder Ancestor manifested, his target none other than Qin Sang!</p><p>Their proximity to Qin Sang meant that as he sensed the Thunder Ancestor’s aura, they bore the full brunt of his oppressive might.</p><p>Powerless to resist, the two demons were flung like ragdolls into the sea of clouds as if struck by a giant hand. They crashed down, vomiting blood, curled up, trembling, their hearts consumed by terror.</p><p>Qin Sang remained oblivious to the events unfolding behind him.  His mind echoed only with the roar of celestial thunder, deaf to all other sounds.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Divine Chariot also suffered from the impact. The repairs Qin Sang had made were damaged during the chase, and now the chariot was severely compromised.</p><p>Finally, unable to bear the strain, cracks spread across the chariot, even worse than before. The golden dragons pulling the chariot prostrated themselves respectfully the instant the Thunder Ancestor’s aura appeared. Even if Qin Sang retained his senses and wished to command the dragons, it would be a futile endeavor.</p><p>‘Crack, crack, crack…’</p><p>The sounds of shattering continued, the golden dragons’ bodies becoming increasingly ethereal until, like bubbles in a dream, they burst into nothingness.</p><p>Qin Sang stood isolated atop the remnants of the chariot, utterly helpless.</p><p>Having cultivated the High Divine Firmament Scripture of the Thunder Jade Mansion, he recognized the sacred title of the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Heavenly Venerable, the supreme deity of the Thunder Department, known as the Thunder Ancestor. Coupled with his experiences and discoveries within the Divine Court, he surmised the origin of this thunder.</p><p>“Could it be the Thunder Ancestor?”</p><p>“Who is performing the ritual to summon the Thunder Ancestor?”</p><p>Amidst this sudden upheaval, countless questions raced through Qin Sang’s mind, but the most pressing one remained:</p><p>“Why… me?”</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>The thunder, neither deviating nor hesitating, struck Qin Sang directly upon his crown.  Where he stood, only dazzling lightning remained, obscuring his figure.</p><p>He seemed to transform into the very embodiment of thunder.</p><p>Within his body, he endured a cataclysmic transformation even more violent than the external spectacle. The divine power of the Thunder Ancestor surged through him, his mere late Nascent Soul cultivation utterly inadequate to withstand such force.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang was powerless to resist, forced to endure the influx of this terrifying power. He felt no pain, only numbness.</p><p>He was as if submerged within a sea of lightning, his body dissolving within the thunder, losing all sense of self. The Thunder Ancestor's power exceeded the limits of his perception, leaving him completely unaware of its potential consequences.</p><p>However, the most terrifying transformation, the one that filled Qin Sang with the greatest dread, originated from his Nascent Soul!</p><p>As the Thunder Ancestor's power flooded his being, his Purple Mansion suffered an unimaginable impact. All Qin Sang could do was protect his Nascent Soul, praying that the summoner had exercised restraint, that this power would be controlled, and that he would not be destroyed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Jade Buddha, which had remained an unyielding bastion throughout his thousand years of cultivation, trembled for the first time under the onslaught of the Thunder Ancestor's power!</p><p>Lightning illuminated his Purple Mansion.</p><p>Endless bolts of lightning seemed to assault his Nascent Soul, while a faint, flickering Buddhist light emanated from within the lightning's core.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Qin Sang’s consciousness roared as he witnessed the Buddhist light on the Jade Buddha’s surface fluctuate wildly, the most intense tremors originating from its severed arm.</p><p>The Jade Buddha had been damaged in his previous life, a family heirloom passed down through generations, too precious to discard.  It had eventually come into Qin Sang’s possession.</p><p>Upon arriving in this world and discovering the Jade Buddha's power, Qin Sang had always intended to explore its origins. His study of Buddhist scriptures within the Central Continent of the Storm Realm had been partly motivated by this desire, but he had found nothing.</p><p>Although the Jade Buddha was missing an arm, it seemed to have no discernible effect.  It had effortlessly drawn in Heavenly Demons, helped him overcome his Nascent Soul Tribulation, and resisted the Heavenly Dao’s demonic whispers within the Storm Realm.  Qin Sang had almost forgotten its imperfection.</p><p>Now, the Jade Buddha finally revealed its limitations.</p><p>The flaw at the severed arm destabilized the Buddhist light.  The resulting shockwaves, transmitted to Qin Sang's Nascent Soul, caused him to experience, for the first time in his thousand years of cultivation, pain within his Nascent Soul that he hadn't willingly embraced!</p><p>It was as if his Nascent Soul was being torn apart.</p><p>Even more terrifying than the pain were the hallucinations. Qin Sang perceived himself as the true Thunder Ancestor, reigning supreme in the Ninth Heaven, the sovereign of all thunder.</p><p>Boundless majesty, infinite power, looking down upon all creation.</p><p>Summoning deities granted power beyond one’s own, and those with exceptional talent could even gain enlightenment through the summoned deity's符. But this practice held hidden dangers.</p><p>The sensation was intoxicating yet perilous. Those with weaker minds could become lost within it, their foundations shattered. Therefore, Daoist cultivators placed great emphasis on cultivating their mental fortitude.</p><p>Fortunately, the Jade Buddha continued to protect Qin Sang.</p><p>Without it, the pain and mental anguish he endured would have been far greater. He might have been reduced to clinging to a single spark of clarity within his Nascent Soul, lost in a haze, his life hanging by a thread.</p><p>Even so, the impact was unimaginable for ordinary cultivators.</p><p>So much so that Qin Sang remained completely unaware of the changes occurring within the altar.</p><p>Within the altar, upon the Divine Guardian’s throne, where Qin Sang's inner truth had resided, a bolt of lightning descended, occupying the throne and manifesting the illusory image of a venerable deity.</p><p>It was the Nine Heavens Responding Primordial Thunder Sound Universal Transforming Heavenly Venerable.</p><p>Qin Sang could never have imagined that he would summon a Divine Guardian under such circumstances.</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>The thunder continued to reverberate.</p><p>Involuntarily, Qin Sang spread his arms, rising from the remnants of the chariot, his body slowly ascending.</p><p>Countless lightning bolts danced around him, transforming into thunder dragons beneath his feet.</p><p>Thunder coalesced into a robe and an imperial crown.</p><p>With closed eyes, clad in the thunder robe, crowned with the imperial diadem, wielding celestial lightning, Qin Sang soared above the clouds, resembling the descent of the Thunder Ancestor himself.</p><p>Yet, no statue of the Thunder Ancestor ever bore such a grimace of pain and torment.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang unleashed an unrestrained howl, a release of both his agony and the terrifying power surging within him.</p><p>The situation was slightly better than he had anticipated.</p><p>The Thunder Ancestor’s power hadn't instantly obliterated his body. Some unseen force seemed to be helping him contain it.</p><p>Nevertheless, Qin Sang was completely unable to control this power, and if it continued, his doom was inevitable.</p><p>Desperate to unleash it, a specific talismanic inscription flashed through his mind – the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman!</p><p>This talisman was the vessel for the Five Thunders Scripture, the highest-ranking, most potent thunder talisman Qin Sang had ever learned!</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang raised his right hand.</p><p>Whether this action was his own volition, driven by the Thunder Ancestor’s power, or influenced by another’s will, even Qin Sang himself didn't know. He acted purely on instinct.</p><p>At this moment, the demon gods within the Divine Court beheld a thunder god.</p><p>A thunder god of unparalleled majesty, commanding wind and thunder, wielding lightning whips and thunderbolts, manipulating creation, and inspiring awe in all beings!</p><p>His index finger pointed towards the heavens, a spark of lightning coalescing at its tip.</p><p>The spark transformed into a bolt, shooting towards the Ninth Heaven, like a drop of water formed from condensed thunder, finally exploding in the upper atmosphere.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>The lightning spread like ripples of water in all directions, simultaneously branching into countless smaller bolts.</p><p>The lightning and the ripples dispersed across the heavens.</p><p>Outside the Divine Court, a similar phenomenon manifested.</p><p>The cultivators and mortals of the Dual Provinces and Mount Ju, the demon cultivators of the Ghostfang Kingdom, the battlefields in the north and south, even the monstrous beasts within the Plains of Calamity and the Sea of Calamity…</p><p>All living beings in this realm sensed it, their gazes drawn upwards.</p><p>They saw thunderous threads, like ripples of water, spreading across the sky, expanding rapidly.  The twisting, flashing threads resembled countless mystical characters, forming a thunderous talismanic diagram that unfurled across the heavens, encompassing the Dual Provinces and beyond.</p><p>Even the moonlight dimmed.</p><p>The seemingly delicate threads contained an unimaginably violent and destructive power.</p><p>Should they erupt, all life beneath the heavens would be annihilated.</p><p>Mortals knelt in prayer.</p><p>Demonic beasts cowered on the ground, their bodies trembling.</p><p>Even the monstrous beasts were roused by the celestial might, a flicker of instinct returning, a force far more terrifying than the drumbeats. The momentum of the beast tide faltered.</p><p>From the depths of the Plains of Calamity and the Sea of Calamity, shrill ghostly wails echoed.</p><p>Within the Ghostfang Kingdom and the Great Sage Mansion, the Demon Kings, their drum mallets clutched in their hands, stared blankly at the celestial thunder, forgetting to beat their drums.</p><p>Only the Daoist cultivators were filled with excitement and awe.</p><p>Those of the Thunder Left and Right Mansions, particularly those who cultivated the High Divine Firmament Scripture, were moved to tears, overwhelmed with emotion.</p><p>The Thunder Jade Mansion had once rivaled the Heavenly Hub Institute and the Northern Pole Demon-Banishing Institute, but it had declined due to its inability to summon a Divine Guardian with its third-stage scriptures.</p><p>After all these years…</p><p>Finally, they witnessed the celestial might of the Thunder Department!</p><p>Finally, they witnessed the divine power of the Thunder Ancestor!</p><p>The thunderous threads stretched endlessly across the sky, but the celestial phenomenon hadn't concluded.</p><p>'Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>Muffled thunder echoed from the heavens.</p><p>Soon, they realized it wasn't thunder, but the very essence of heaven and earth vibrating.</p><p>The night sky visibly distorted.</p><p>High above, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, stirred by the thunderous threads, became turbulent, swirling into visible spirit tides.</p><p>‘Whooooosh…Whooooosh…’</p><p>The spirit tides roared like a raging tempest, threatening to tear the heavens asunder.</p><p>The vast, boundless spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged madly towards the center of the thunderous threads, the point where the “thunder drop” had exploded.</p><p>As the spirit tides surged, they merged with the thunderous threads, transforming into countless thunder dragons and lightning serpents.</p><p>All creatures on the ground could witness this spectacle.</p><p>Countless thunder dragons and lightning serpents soared across the heavens, riding the spirit tides, majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p>It was as if divine dragons from all directions had gathered to pay homage to the celestial realm!</p><p>The point where the thunder dragons and lightning serpents converged was precisely where Qin Sang’s finger pointed.</p><p>Within the blinding lightning, individual lightning characters materialized, arranging themselves in a specific pattern within the void.</p><p>Each character was the size of a bushel, forming a divine talisman.</p><p>The divine talisman took shape, its straight lines drawn by lightning, resembling a thunderous seal.</p><p>This seal resided in the center of the sky, like the seal of the Heavenly Heart, the very Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal!</p><p>The thunder seal was square and imposing.</p><p>Compared to this seal, what Qin Sang had previously manifested could only be considered a fragmented imitation.</p><p>Qin Sang had received the Five Thunders Scripture and had continuously studied this talisman. However, the Five Thunders Scripture was a third-stage scripture, spanning both the Nascent Soul and Soul Formation realms.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang's understanding of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman had been less than half of the complete talisman.</p><p>Now, he had fully manifested it!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning split the sky.</p><p>Celestial thunder illuminated the entire realm!</p><p>The beings gazing upwards felt a sharp sting in their eyes, their vision overwhelmed by a blinding white light.</p><p>For an instant, the world between heaven and earth was as bright as day.</p><p>All beings trembled in fear!</p><p>As the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal erupted, a silver thread had already pierced into the Divine Court, locking onto its target and hurtling towards the Ninth Heaven of Thunder City.</p><p>Before the silver thread arrived, the immortal clouds of the Ninth Heaven were already destabilizing.</p><p>Then, as if sensing something, the silver thread abruptly halted, hesitating for a moment, but the power of the thunder seal had already been unleashed.</p><p>The thunder seal erupted with countless thunderbolts, each possessing the power to shatter heaven and earth, rushing towards the silver thread.</p><p>The silver thread swayed, retreating upwards, but it was too late.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the tip of the silver thread was swallowed by several thunderbolts.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Divine Court trembled violently.</p><p>A section of the silver thread’s tip was instantly destroyed by the thunder, while the remaining thread retreated at an even greater speed.</p><p>Clearly, whoever controlled the silver thread from beyond the void was attempting to withdraw it from this realm.</p><p>But the thunder pursued relentlessly.</p><p>Section by section, the silver thread fractured, annihilated by the crisscrossing thunderbolts.</p><p>Countless thunderbolts chased the silver thread, soaring towards the highest reaches of the heavens, leaving a striking trail, like a pillar of lightning coiling upwards, connecting to the depths of the void.</p><p>Finally, the thunder surged into the swirling vortex in the void, the source of the silver thread, then, without hesitation, gathering all its power, it plunged into the vortex's heart.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The void, already unstable after the manifestation of the divine power, exhibited various anomalies, threatening to tear apart.</p><p>Now, it was further exacerbated. A ferocious storm erupted at the vortex's center, the void roaring as if in fury.</p><p>…</p><p>The celestial thunder dissipated.</p><p>But the awe inspired by the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal would be etched into the memories of all living beings for eternity.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the White Stone Province altar…</p><p>Kun Dao’s body went limp as she collapsed onto the altar, her face pale, her aura weak.</p><p>She had exerted all her strength to share Qin Sang’s burden, restraining the power of the Thunder Ancestor.</p><p>Without her intervention, Qin Sang, unable to withstand the Thunder Ancestor’s power, would have been obliterated.</p><p>…</p><p>Within and beyond the Divine Court, a profound silence descended.</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure hung suspended in mid-air, motionless.</p><p>“Gasp…Gasp…Gasp…”</p><p>With closed eyes, his breathing ragged and his chest heaving, he had yet to recover from the impact of the Thunder Ancestor's power.</p><p>His aura rapidly diminished.</p><p>He had unleashed a single devastating blow, destroying the silver thread, but it had been his only strike.</p><p>During that ancient war, the Thunder Department had suffered the most grievous losses.  The Thunder Ancestor, severely injured, had not fully recovered despite countless years of recuperation within the Divine Court.</p><p>Now, within the Divine Court, only Qin Sang remained!</p><p>As for the Azure Scaled Serpent, the Black Roc, and the demon gods within Thunder City, they had all perished the moment the thunderbolt resounded, their souls shattered by the lightning.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang’s eyelids twitched slightly, as if he were about to awaken.</p><p>Suddenly…</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Divine Court shuddered once more.</p><p>An explosion, no less powerful than the previous thunderclap, erupted almost beside Qin Sang, instantly jolting him awake.</p><p>Confusion etched across his face, Qin Sang opened his eyes, which once again widened in shock.</p><p>Before him, less than thirty feet away, a massive palm print had appeared in the void!</p><p>Countless cracks lined the palm print.</p><p>It was as if someone, from beyond the void, had shattered the barrier of the Divine Court with a single palm strike.</p><p>The area struck by the palm print turned crimson, the crimson light twisting and writhing like a pool of mud and blood combined.</p><p>Heart-wrenching screams emanated from the blood pool, as if it were enduring unimaginable torment.</p><p>In an instant, a ghostly, grotesque figure struggled to emerge from the blood pool.</p><p>Its aura flickered, the grimace of pain still etched on its face. Then, its eyes flashed with a sharp light.</p><p>Its gaze swept across the Divine Court, locking onto Qin Sang. A cruel smile spread across its face.</p><p>“Hand over the Emperor’s Sword, and I will spare your life!” (End of Chapter)</p>
