Chapter 1323: Hidden Concerns Beyond the Border

---

**Ethereal Spirit Sect.**

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Qin Sang stepped out of the Scripture Pavilion. Unconsciously, over two months had passed since he last emerged. Gazing at the setting sun, his mind remained immersed in the profound scrolls he had been studying, still yearning for more.

The guardian of the Scripture Pavilion was an elderly Golden Core cultivator, far too advanced in age to hope for a breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage. He now spent his twilight years in peaceful retirement within the sect. Though older than Qin Sang, the old man stood respectfully to the side, awaiting Qin Sang's instructions.

"These past years have been troublesome for you. I appreciate your efforts," Qin Sang turned and expressed his gratitude to the old man.

The elder quickly waved his hands in humility. "Senior Qin, you flatter me. I am merely fulfilling my duties as ordered by the sect master."

Qin Sang nodded. "I was planning to personally thank Sect Master Binghan. Is she available at the moment?"

"Senior, the sect master is currently in seclusion within her cave abode," the elder replied.

Qin Sang summoned his escape light and flew toward Binghan's cave. Having spent many years within the Ethereal Spirit Sect, he moved freely without hindrance. Along the way, disciples of the sect, now accustomed to the presence of this foreign Nascent Soul ancestor, stopped to bow respectfully as he passed.

As Qin Sang approached the cave, the protective formation flickered, and Binghan herself emerged to greet him.

"Fellow Daoist Qin, have you fully comprehended all the scriptures?" Binghan invited Qin Sang inside, already guessing his purpose for visiting.

"I dare not claim full comprehension. I have merely committed all the texts to memory. The deeper mysteries still elude me, and I must experiment personally to truly grasp them. I fear I will need to trouble you frequently in the future for further guidance," Qin Sang explained, his visit serving as a farewell.

The Northern Star Realm had been peaceful, with no major events occurring. Aware of his weak foundation, Qin Sang had resolved to approach his studies as a beginner, patiently filling in the gaps in his knowledge. Over the past decade, he had meticulously studied and experimented with all the treasured texts of the Ethereal Spirit Sect. Of course, true mastery and integration of this knowledge would require continued rigorous practice.

Binghan smiled warmly. "Fellow Daoist Qin, your visits are always welcome. The disciples have remarked that your presence has brought an unprecedented sense of stability to the sect. My only concern is that your extraordinary talent might lead to such rapid progress that I will soon have nothing left to teach you."

After a moment of light-hearted banter, Binghan inquired, "Are you leaving now to head to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield?"

Qin Sang nodded. "Indeed. I recently received a message from Daoist Zhenyi. The spiritual tides in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield are intensifying, and it is time to investigate the Purple Subtlety Palace's celestial formation once more. This time, we should be able to determine the approximate time of the palace's emergence. Additionally, my turn to oversee the Seven Waters Illusory Heaven Formation is approaching."

"If we can pinpoint the timing, it means the emergence of the Purple Subtlety Palace is not far off, aligning with our previous estimates. The interval this time should be within a century..." Binghan's expression darkened slightly. "The Demon Lord Ye has been hiding in the Palace of Sinful Deities for a decade, and we have no idea what schemes he is preparing. This exploration of the Purple Subtlety Palace is fraught with uncertainties!"

"Whatever comes, we will face it head-on," Qin Sang replied without fear.

He had already instructed his companions, like Fat Chicken, to secure a refuge overseas. If the combined forces of the Northern Star Realm proved no match for Demon Lord Ye, they would have no choice but to retreat and avoid confrontation.

After bidding farewell to Binghan, Qin Sang flew north to the Hanging Skull Pass, where he met up with Daoist Zhenyi and others before entering the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.

The spiritual tides were at their peak, but the group, composed of the most elite experts from various regions, remained composed as they sped through the turbulent currents.

Upon reaching the location of the Purple Subtlety Palace, Daoist Zhenyi produced a set of formation tools. Together, they analyzed the fluctuations emanating from the palace's celestial formation.

After a full day and night, they finally made a discovery.

"Let's go!" Daoist Zhenyi stored the formation tools and led the group away. "If all goes as expected, the Purple Subtlety Palace will open in ten years."

"Based on this timeline, the interval this time is nearly seventy years, half of the previous one. Could the next interval be just over thirty years?" speculated the Nether Demon Lord.

Daoist Zhenyi's face lit up with anticipation. "It's possible! Perhaps the Purple Subtlety Palace will eventually open permanently, revealing all its secrets to the world. The cultivation world may finally usher in an era of prosperity!"

Canghong Zhenren was guarding the Immortal Gate at the Abyssal Ruins, so this time, it was Fairy Qiuzhi who attended. She remained calm and composed, stating coolly, "The emergence of the Purple Subtlety Palace is a double-edged sword. If cultivators beyond the Northern Star Realm learn of this, how could they resist the temptation?"

Her words cast a shadow over the group, and the initial joy faded as they felt the weight of the situation.

"Mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators would face significant danger crossing the storm belt, so we need not worry about a large-scale invasion. However, Fairy Qiuzhi's concerns are valid. With the strength of the Northern Star Realm alone, facing off against experts from three realms would be a daunting task. We must take precautions early and do our best to keep the news contained," said a cultivator surnamed Lu.

The Feather King shook his head. "No wall is without cracks. It's impossible to keep the news completely sealed! From what I know, there are several secret realms within the Purple Subtlety Palace. Previously, we lacked the time to break the ancient restrictions. Now, with all past grievances set aside, we can fully share information and work together to dismantle the restrictions. In the first few years, our gains will surely exceed expectations. We must not allow outsiders to interfere."

Qin Sang and the others understood the Feather King's concernsâ€”he feared the demonic race being marginalized by the human race. The opening of the Purple Subtlety Palace would bring immense benefits, and the human race could not monopolize them, especially with foreign experts watching closely.

None present were fools. They knew that internal strife at this time would only bring harm and benefit outsiders. Thus, they all voiced their agreement to reassure the demonic race.

Of course, this was contingent on them first resolving the threat of Demon Lord Ye.

After returning from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Qin Sang hurried to Peach Blossom Valley, only to find his senior sister in seclusion. He then went to the Earth Sink Cave to confirm Bai's safety before flying to Wanye Mountain.

The disciples of the Green Goat Temple were all at Wanye Mountain. Before officially establishing the Green Goat Temple, Li Yufu had used this place as a temporary headquarters, meticulously rebuilding it. Now, Wanye Mountain had regained its former prosperity.

The Green Goat Temple and its disciples had undergone significant changes over the past decade.

Tan Yi'en had attempted to form his Golden Core several times but failed. Eventually, he consumed a Demonic Pill and successfully broke through. Skilled in diplomacy and administration, he managed the sect's affairs with a blend of kindness and authority, earning the praise and full support of Li Yufu and Mei Gu.

Bai Hanqiu had made a similar choice. After struggling to reach the Foundation Establishment stage, she realized her limited potential and chose to marry a male cultivator she admired, assisting Tan Yi'en and living a blissful life.

Li Yufu, Mei Gu, Shangguan Lifeng, and several newly recruited Golden Core cultivators had also found their own opportunities.

The demons of the Thousand Bamboo Sea had switched to cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Refinement Technique*, making rapid progress under Jingyu's careful guidance.

Qin Sang landed atop Wanye Mountain and entered his cave abode. With a flick of his hand, he sent a streak of light outside, summoning Tan Yi'en.
