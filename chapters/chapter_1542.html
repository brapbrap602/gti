<h1></h1><p>We're late.</p><p>Qinsang flashed into the cavern, discovering its remarkable depth. Judging by the traces, the cave wasn't formed by external forces. An internal power had erupted, obliterating the dwelling along with the entire lake.</p><p>The passage of time had weathered the marks, erasing valuable information. Qinsang couldn't determine whether this power originated from the dwelling itself or was the result of an intruder forcefully breaking in.</p><p>What was certain was that this place was no longer suitable as a dwelling.</p><p>"The vicissitudes of life!" Qinsang couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>It was hard to say how much of the information Senior Xiaoxiang Zi recorded in the jade slip remained valuable. He feared many places were similar to this one, either discovered by others or destroyed.</p><p>If not for Senior Xiaoxiang Zi mentioning that only Soul Transformation stage cultivators could uncover the secret of the Buddha Bone Relic, he wouldn't have dared to hold much hope.</p><p>Beneath the Sky-Rending Valley, day and night were indistinguishable.</p><p>He calculated with his fingers, realizing he had unknowingly searched the Sky-Rending Valley for over a month.</p><p>According to the pattern of cloud energy changes within the Sky-Rending Valley, it only opened once every ten years or so, and each opening lasted anywhere from ten days to nearly a month.</p><p>Now was the most dangerous period in the Sky-Rending Valley, and the vast majority of cultivators had retreated outside.</p><p>Qinsang returned empty-handed, and he had no interest in exploring the secrets of the Sky-Rending Valley. He prepared to return the way he came.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Sky-Rending Valley.</p><p>A sheer cliff face was covered in dense vines, so thick they resembled giant pythons coiled there. Although it was a place teeming with life, the vines were gray, giving it an indescribably eerie atmosphere.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Strands of chilling wind passed through the gaps between the vines, creating a faint whistling sound.</p><p>The cliff was filled only with the sound of the wind, devoid of beast roars or insect chirps, further intensifying the feeling.</p><p>At this moment, in a slightly wider crevice in the rock, two figures were hidden beneath the vines, cautiously peering at the top of the cliff through the gaps.</p><p>They were a man and a woman. The woman was only at the Foundation Establishment stage and had a sickly complexion, while the man was a Core Formation Paragon.</p><p>What made them so cautious and treat it as a major threat was a stone cave at the top of the cliff.</p><p>The inside of the cave was pitch black.</p><p>The chilling wind carried a foul, putrid stench.</p><p>They lay prostrate, unmoving. They had been hiding here for over ten days, enduring the stench and not daring to use any secret techniques to block the smell, fearing they would miss their opportunity.</p><p>The woman was accustomed to the stench. She glanced at the man beside her, who was focused on the top of the cliff, her eyes filled with tenderness. She parted her rosy lips slightly and cautiously transmitted her voice, her tone filled with worry.</p><p>"Senior Brother, the Sky-Rending Valley has already closed."</p><p>"That message didn't specify the exact flowering period of this Serpent Shadow Flower, only providing a rough estimate. It's just our bad luck that it didn't bloom during the opening."</p><p>The man sighed, "If we miss this one, who knows how long we'll have to wait. Junior Sister, your illness can't wait any longer. Refining this Serpent Shadow Flower will give us some breathing room, and I will search high and low, I will find a spirit medicine to cure you. Master entrusted me to take care of you before he passed away. How can I go back on my word? I must get it this time."</p><p>"But…"</p><p>The woman looked anxious, but the man interrupted her.</p><p>"Has Junior Sister forgotten that I'm not the same as before?"</p><p>The man feigned ease, "I am now a Core Formation cultivator. The Sky-Rending Valley isn't as dangerous as it used to be. Moreover, before I left, I specially commissioned someone to forge a Sun Luo Umbrella. I can withstand even the most common lightning tribulation in the Sky-Rending Valley…"</p><p>Just then, a faint, elegant fragrance suddenly emerged within the foul stench.</p><p>The stench was so strong that the fragrance was extremely faint and easily overlooked.</p><p>The two had been hiding for many days, waiting for this very moment. They immediately sensed the abnormality in the smell. The man immediately swallowed the rest of his words and said excitedly, "I'll go lure away that eagle demon. Junior Sister, remember, after a quarter of an hour, the Serpent Shadow Flower will be fully bloomed, and its medicinal properties will be at their peak. Remember to directly refine it with the secret technique, do not pick it!"</p><p>He had repeated these instructions countless times, but the man was still worried.</p><p>The woman, however, felt warmth. She gazed at the man's resolute face and softly urged, "My illness has already reached its late stage. If it's impossible, Senior Brother, please don't…"</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!"</p><p>The man decisively stopped the woman. Without another word, he suddenly rushed out, conjured his treasured sword, and thrust it straight into the stone cave.</p><p>The next moment, an angry, sharp screech came from within the cave, piercing and ear-splitting.</p><p>The treasured sword was knocked back, its light dimming.</p><p>A demonic wind followed closely, the strong stench comparable to poisonous gas, making one dizzy. Within the demonic wind was a demonic beast, its body resembling an eagle, but its neck was slender like a snake.</p><p>It looked like half a snake's body was embedded in an eagle's body, very strange.</p><p>Seeing that he had easily lured out the Serpent Eagle, the man was secretly delighted. He showed no fear and actively engaged the Serpent Eagle in battle.</p><p>Unfortunately, the man hadn't been in the Core Formation stage for long and didn't have a Numinous Treasure to support him. Facing the Core Formation stage Serpent Eagle, he was at a disadvantage and quickly fell into a passive position.</p><p>The woman was still hiding in the crevice, her face full of anxiety.</p><p>The air was filled with black demonic wind, obscuring the sky. The shadows of the man and the demon were no longer visible.</p><p>She knew that her Senior Brother was doing his best to lure away the Serpent Eagle, creating an opportunity for her.</p><p>As time passed, the fragrance of the Serpent Shadow Flower became stronger and stronger. It was almost time for it to bloom. The Serpent Eagle, unable to kill the man, screeched even more sharply. Attracted by the fragrance, it intended to return to its cave.</p><p>But the man began a frenzied counterattack, completely forgetting his own injuries, desperately entangling the Serpent Eagle.</p><p>Tears welled up in the woman's eyes. She bit her rosy lips tightly, not daring to look up, and quickly snuck into the stone cave.</p><p>At this critical moment, the Serpent Eagle made a shocking move.</p><p>The Serpent Eagle, which was fiercely battling the man, suddenly seemed stunned, forgetting to attack. The man slashed it at the base of its wing. It came to its senses, emitting a hoarse screech.</p><p>Unlike before, this screech was not only filled with pain but also with terror, as if it had encountered its natural predator.</p><p>Even the man could sense the fear in the Serpent Eagle's heart.</p><p>Then, the Serpent Eagle actually forgot about its cave and the spirit medicine. It flapped its wings and fled in panic, even neglecting to adjust its body, fleeing unsteadily.</p><p>Seeing that the Serpent Eagle didn't return to the cave, the man no longer obstructed it.</p><p>But this strange scene made him suspicious and uneasy, a strong sense of foreboding rising in his heart.</p><p>What exactly was the existence that terrified the Serpent Eagle?</p><p>The man suppressed the shock in his heart, hurriedly landed at the entrance of the stone cave, and saw his Junior Sister was focused on refining the Serpent Shadow Flower. He turned around, looking around blankly.</p><p>The next moment, the man saw a terrifying scene he would never forget. A chill ran down his spine, and the blood in his entire body seemed to freeze.</p><p>Deep within the Sky-Rending Valley, stone peaks stood tall.</p><p>At the end of his vision, the clouds in the sky had a slightly yellowish tint. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was a cloud of yellow.</p><p>The yellow cloud was like fire, covering the sky and earth, spreading with astonishing speed towards them. In front of it was a mass of black, which turned out to be a flock of birds driven by the yellow cloud.</p><p>What had startled the Serpent Eagle was precisely the yellow cloud.</p><p>"Senior Brother, you chased away the Serpent Eagle?"</p><p>The woman had already refined the Serpent Shadow Flower and was preparing to slowly absorb the medicinal power within her body once they were safe. She came from behind and was surprised to see the Serpent Eagle gone.</p><p>Before she finished speaking, the woman noticed her Senior Brother's strange expression. Following his gaze, she saw the yellow cloud rapidly approaching in the distance. Her whole body trembled, her face filled with deep fear, and she uttered a desperate murmur, "Ghostfire Insect Cloud!"</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>The man grabbed the woman's arm, intending to use his movement technique to escape. Unexpectedly, his hand suddenly felt a sharp pain, and he was forcibly shaken off by the woman.</p><p>"Junior Sister…"</p><p>The man turned back in astonishment, only to see that the woman had already distanced herself from him. Tears streamed down her face, but she looked at him with a resolute expression, shaking her head repeatedly.</p><p>Taking her with him, both of them would undoubtedly die.</p><p>If he left alone, there might be a sliver of hope.</p><p>They had searched for a cure for many years and had just seen a glimmer of hope, only to be immediately plunged into the abyss by the cruel reality.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange voice interjected between the two.</p><p>"I didn't expect to meet two lovebirds here, quite a pair."</p><p>The two were startled and looked towards the sound. They saw a figure slowly appearing at the entrance of the cave, without any fluctuation. If the other party hadn't spoken, they wouldn't have sensed him at all.</p><p>At any other time, the two would have felt fear and vigilance.</p><p>At this moment, however, hope ignited in the man's eyes.</p><p>"Is this an Insect Cloud?"</p><p>The newcomer was precisely Qinsang, who was preparing to leave the valley.</p><p>"Reporting to Senior, this yellow cloud is indeed an Insect Cloud," the man replied, disregarding the woman's urging. He cupped his hands and said, "Inside the Insect Cloud are terrifying venomous insects called Ghost Insects. Countless Ghost Insects spew venomous mist, resembling fire and clouds. It is one of the three most terrifying insect plagues in the Sky-Rending Valley, the Ghostfire Insect Cloud. When encountering the Ghostfire Insect Cloud, the only option is to flee. If caught by the Ghostfire Insect Cloud, one must take a Turtle Breath Pill to feign death and use a Fire Smoke Pill to ward off the poison. There might be a chance of survival, but the price of these pills…"</p><p>The man spoke quickly, his expression turning helpless at the end.</p><p>Established Core Formation stage cultivators could afford these two pills, but he had just formed his core and had spent almost all his wealth on the information about the Serpent Shadow Flower.</p><p>"Ghost Insects?"</p><p>Qinsang pondered.</p><p>As he expected, the languages of Central Province and the Northern Sea had the same origin. The differences that had developed could be easily adapted to by cultivators with photographic memory, especially since there were specific Comprehension Spells for such situations.</p><p>The important written characters in the cultivation world and the ancient texts unearthed in both regions were basically identical.</p><p>As far as Qinsang knew, there were several types of spirit insects that could cause similar insect cloud formations, but 'Ghost Insects' were not among them.</p><p>Qinsang realized that this was probably the local cultivators' name for them.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly could see through the Insect Cloud, but these were just the poisonous clouds spewed by the Ghost Insects. The poisonous clouds were expanding rapidly, and the Ghost Insect army was still behind.</p><p>The areas where the poisonous clouds passed did not resemble the aftermath of a locust swarm, devouring all vegetation and living beings. However, the destruction they brought was even worse.</p><p>Upon contact with the poisonous cloud, vegetation withered, and their vitality was completely drained.</p><p>Countless birds and beasts fled for their lives, but they ultimately couldn't escape the fate of being devoured by the poisonous cloud. In an instant, they were drained of all their blood and essence, leaving behind only dried-up corpses.</p><p>The poisonous cloud was like a gigantic monster, wantonly devouring the vitality of the world, leaving a desolate wasteland in its wake.</p><p>However, the Sky-Rending Valley was not an ordinary place. In less than half a year, it would be restored to its former vitality.</p><p>Finally, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly found traces of the Ghost Insects deep within the poisonous cloud.</p><p>"So it's Corpse Phosphor Fireflies!"</p><p>Qinsang realized.</p><p>This spirit insect had limited combat power on its own and was not suitable as a Gu insect.</p><p>A small number was ineffective, while controlling a large number would place a great burden on the cultivator, making it more trouble than it was worth.</p><p>However, when the Corpse Phosphor Firefly population reached a certain size, the poisonous cloud would undergo a transformation, becoming an existence that even high-level cultivators would avoid, and the larger the number, the more terrifying it became.</p><p>The man saw that Qinsang remained silent, and he became anxious. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something.</p><p>Qinsang saw through his thoughts and smiled slightly, "I'm afraid we can't escape."</p><p>The man was startled. He flashed out of the stone cave and looked behind him, truly understanding the meaning of despair.</p><p>Behind them was another Insect Cloud. The two Insect Clouds were converging on them, leaving them no escape.</p><p>At this time, Qinsang ignored the pair of lovebirds, produced several array flags, and set up a large array within the stone cave to isolate their auras. At the same time, he summoned Fatso.</p><p>After consuming the Frog Fish's poison sac, Fatso had been sleeping soundly.</p><p>Qinsang had previously worried about it undergoing tribulation in the storm zone, but there were still no signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>The Spirit Array was completed in an instant. The array flags were shrouded in a faint shadow. Qinsang flashed inside, and his figure immediately disappeared. Fatso was awakened, reluctantly spewing out a poison-repelling halo that merged with the shadow.</p><p>"Come in!"</p><p>Qinsang's voice reached the ears of the two, sounding like heavenly music.</p><p>The two, who had been in despair, were overjoyed. They cautiously entered the array, their movements restrained.</p><p>"Junior Zhou Jin, this is my Junior Sister, Ruan Yu. Senior, your life-saving grace is deeply etched in our hearts, unforgettable for a lifetime. We are willing to give our lives to repay you."</p><p>The poisonous cloud had not yet arrived, but he had already determined that Qinsang could help them through this ordeal.</p><p>Qinsang conjured a stone wall with a spell, blocking the entrance of the cave. He glanced at Ruan Yu and said to the two, who were filled with apprehension, "Core Formation stage, you do have some use. Since you want to repay me, just do one thing for me."</p><p>Zhou Jin gritted his teeth, "Senior, please speak. Junior will do his utmost to repay you."</p><p>"Don't be so forceful."</p><p>Qinsang said淡淡ly, "The essence of Water Spirit's Malignant Energy has invaded your heart meridian… Hmm, no! It has already merged with the Malignant Energy. I fear you were affected by the Malignant Energy as a fetus, leaving behind a root illness. You were fortunate enough to change your constitution and successfully establish your foundation, but you don't have many years left. This spirit medicine will only alleviate the onset time, you cannot escape death."</p><p>Qinsang's words were cold and cruel.</p><p>The two, however, were not surprised but overjoyed. They immediately knelt down together, "Senior, save us!"</p><p>"I do have a pill formula in my possession that can suppress the Malignant Energy, but there is only a thirty percent chance of eliminating the hidden danger. This medicine is not difficult to refine. I can give you the pill formula, provided you do a good job."</p><p>Qinsang focused his attention on the outside of the stone cave.</p><p>The Insect Cloud had arrived. The poisonous cloud could actually penetrate the mountain rocks, invading and plundering all vitality, but it was firmly blocked by Fatso's poison-repelling armor.</p><p>Hearing these words, Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu looked at each other.</p><p>They didn't know if this Senior was trustworthy, but he was the only lifeline they could grasp.</p><p>And Qinsang had not exaggerated the efficacy of the medicine, which inadvertently made him seem more credible.</p><p>Ruan Yu tightly grasped Zhou Jin's hand, her heart filled with worry.</p><p>Zhou Jin, however, no longer hesitated, "We will obey Senior's orders!"</p><p>Qinsang took out a blank jade slip, "With your cultivation, you are already qualified to leave the Northern Wastelands and travel. Go to the Nineteen Misty Rain Prefectures and gather some information for me. The place names may have changed, so find a way to verify them yourself…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Qinsang stopped and let out a soft exclamation.</p><p>Fatso, who had been lazily lying in his palm, suddenly became excited for some reason, rolling over, wagging its head and tail, urging Qinsang to leave the stone cave. There seemed to be something outside that attracted it.</p>
