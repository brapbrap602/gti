<h1></h1><p>The Ullambana Festival and the Zhongyuan Ghost Festival were originally one and the same, their general procedures similar.  </p><p>Of course, with the distinctions between Buddhism and Daoism, the specific forms of the festivals certainly had many differences.</p><p>The so-called first-class grand event was, in fact, only relative to the sect cultivators of the Nineteen States of Yanyu. Cultivators and rogue cultivators from the Northern Wastelands, Western Desert, and Eastern Sea weren't qualified to participate, only to watch the spectacle.</p><p>Even so, it still attracted many cultivators to observe the ceremonies.</p><p>During the festival, there were sparring matches, Dao discussions, and demonstrations of all kinds of cultivation arts, making it an excellent opportunity for exchange.</p><p>However, these were secondary.</p><p>The sect powers of the Nineteen States of Yanyu valued the festival most because each festival was an opportunity to distribute benefits, and could even determine the landscape of the Central Plains for the next five hundred years.</p><p>Since they were called the Ullambana Festival and the Zhongyuan Ghost Festival, they were naturally led by the Ganlu Zen Monastery and the Eight Sceneries Sect, respectively.</p><p>But the location of the festival wasn't fixed; it rotated among the nineteen states. Whenever it came to a state, the sect powers of that state would dedicate themselves to cooperating.</p><p>Weaker states, such as the Seven Western States, which were gradually incorporated into the Central Plains later, lacked the strength and could co-host with another state.</p><p>Hosting the festival had countless benefits, and the qualified sect powers were all happy to do so, including the Demonic Sects.</p><p>The Tianhao Tower, the foremost Demonic Sect of the Central Plains, was located in the same Jiangzuo Six States as the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery.  Naturally, their relationship wasn't harmonious, yet they still cooperated with the Eight Sceneries Sect to host a Zhongyuan Ghost Festival.</p><p>During the festival, a scene of harmony prevailed.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Jiang Mu that the next Ullambana Festival was less than eighty years away.</p><p>This Ullambana Festival would be held in Jinyu State, one of the four Northern States.</p><p>The Jinyu Sect was wealthy and powerful.  It was said they had already released news and made ample preparations, claiming to host an unprecedentedly grand festival, and that all expenses would be borne by the Jinyu Sect alone, without the need for other powers in Jinyu State to contribute.</p><p>"Bu Nian Shan has been closed for a hundred years.  Are they not planning to participate in the Ullambana Festival? Or will they send a few disciples to make a perfunctory appearance? Or perhaps Situ Yu foresees potential upheavals at this Ullambana Festival and is pessimistic about the future…"</p><p>Qin Sang's first thought was of Bu Nian Shan.</p><p>Situ Yu's choice to close the mountain at this time must have been carefully considered.</p><p>"The Ullambana Festival will be a critical juncture!" Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Those forces lurking in the shadows, the sects harboring ulterior motives, were likely all waiting for the Ullambana Festival.</p><p>Throughout the history of the festival, there had been many instances of Soul Formation experts revealing their divine power.</p><p>In recent years, news of the disappearance of Soul Formation cultivators had spread like wildfire.</p><p>If Soul Formation experts didn't appear at this festival, it was estimated that the situation wouldn't be containable. Before and after the festival, the cultivation world would certainly undergo earth-shattering changes.</p><p>Qin Sang was alone, without any ties.</p><p>For him, chaos in the Central Plains wasn't necessarily a bad thing. Muddy waters made for good fishing.</p><p>The premise was having sufficient strength; otherwise, if he was inadvertently caught in the maelstrom, he could also perish in the chaos.  He was certainly not weak among cultivators of the same rank, but those grand cultivators from top-tier inheritances were never short of secret techniques and exotic treasures.</p><p>Moreover, there were Soul Formation inheritances in the Central Plains.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Jiang Mu's gaze and put away these thoughts, asking in return, "What is Jiang Daoyou's intention in mentioning the Ullambana Festival? If Qin has the leisure, I will certainly go to Jinyu State to observe… Could there be exotic treasures more valuable than the 'Turtle Guidance Technique' and the Undetermined Flower at the Ullambana Festival?"</p><p>Jiang Mu nodded and then shook his head, saying, "During the festival, there are auctions every day, with some treasures as the grand finale, but there shouldn't be too many treasures that surpass the 'Turtle Guidance Technique'. Even if there are treasures of that level, it would be difficult for them to fall into the hands of outsiders. Because during the festival, the cultivators of those super sects will organize small-scale treasure exchange meetings, refusing outsiders. One must have a recommendation to join."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt regretful again.  He could have asked Lu Zhang for a recommendation.</p><p>He had devoted all his energy to arduous cultivation, thinking that maintaining a good relationship with Bu Nian Shan was enough.  How could he have anticipated that Bu Nian Shan would choose this time to close the mountain?</p><p>The Xie family's name probably wouldn't carry much weight at the festival.</p><p>With the unstable situation in the cultivation world, Qin Sang wasn't reckless. He didn't want to publicly expose his identity and cultivation level at this time, attracting unwanted attention.</p><p>A gentleman keeps his tools concealed, waiting for the right moment to act.</p><p>"Your esteemed hall must have made preparations as well, right?" Qin Sang looked at Jiang Mu.</p><p>"Such a grand event, our Six States Hall certainly won't miss it. If Daoyou Qin is interested, as the festival approaches, or when you arrive in Jinyu State, contact Jiang. Jiang will report to the main hall and secure a place for Daoyou.  Rest assured, Daoyou Qin, our hall guarantees with its reputation that there will be absolutely no problems at the treasure exchange meeting."</p><p>Jiang Mu frankly admitted it.  The more experts participating in the treasure exchange, the better.</p><p>Recruiting a Nascent Soul cultivator with a few words counted as his contribution.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, but this didn't solve his immediate need.  After the festival, the Central Plains would be in chaos.  Was he supposed to go back and continue closed-door cultivation?</p><p>Jiang Mu saw Qin Sang's concerns and changed his tone, saying, "Don't worry, Daoyou. In a while, there should be frequent auctions and treasure exchange meetings."</p><p>"Oh? How so?"</p><p>"The results at the Ullambana Festival have a certain influence on the final distribution of benefits.  Before the festival, all sects will spare no effort to make full preparations. To compensate for their shortcomings, they are willing to trade treasures they have cherished for many years.  Exchanging only among themselves isn't enough, and there are many Daoyous who don't want to expose their weaknesses, lest their enemies find clues. At that time, they will have to acquire them through other channels, from the outside. The accumulated resources of these sects over five hundred years, you can imagine, are a great opportunity for us rogue cultivators to obtain treasures!"</p><p>Jiang Mu rubbed his hands as he spoke, his expression full of anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang's behavior resembled a rogue cultivator or a cultivator from the outer regions, or perhaps a sect cultivator in disguise, but Jiang Mu didn't care.  As he said, as the festival approached, there would be more such people.</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly moved by these words.</p><p>As one of the largest trading companies in the Central Plains, the Six States Hall certainly wouldn't lack such commissions!</p><p>After such a long detour, Jiang Mu's true purpose was this.</p><p>"What are the requirements for participating in this kind of treasure exchange meeting?" Qin Sang asked directly.</p><p>"Daoyou is straightforward!"</p><p>Jiang Mu gazed at Qin Sang. "For ordinary treasure exchanges, Nascent Soul cultivators can participate, the more the merrier. But there are also some distinguished guests, with stringent requirements. Just for cultivation alone, at least mid-Nascent Soul, or comparable strength! Of course, this kind of treasure exchange will certainly not disappoint Daoyou, with no shortage of rare treasures appearing!"</p><p>Qin Sang had been in the Six States Hall for so long, yet Jiang Mu couldn't sense the depth of his cultivation at all, and he already had a guess.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, placed it on the table, tapped his fingers lightly a few times, and suddenly a subtle sword energy shot out from his index finger, flashing into the wall.</p><p>The sword energy pierced through the wall, leaving a small hole, and instantly dissipated, a masterful display.</p><p>Jiang Mu's pupils constricted.  He pressed his palm forward, preventing the restrictions from reacting.  Although the restrictions in the quiet room weren't as strong as the protective spirit array outside, the fact that the other party could easily break through them spoke volumes.</p><p>He didn't hesitate any longer and immediately took out a token, handing it to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Daoyou Qin, please keep this token.  When participating in the treasure exchange, you can bring two companions with this token without restriction. When there is news, how should we contact Daoyou? Our hall has several communication methods, Daoyou can choose any one."</p><p>Qin Sang took the token and found that it was similar to the Six States Token he had received before, only with more intricate patterns. Inside were extremely complex markings, extremely difficult to forge.</p><p>He put away the token and asked, "There's no rush. Your esteemed hall rents out cave dwellings in Yanshui Market, right? Qin intends to rent a cave dwelling here for a few days."</p><p>Jiang Mu was taken aback.  "This… I'm afraid it won't be worthy of Daoyou's discerning eyes."</p><p>The cave dwellings in Yanshui Market were considered quite good, but how could they compare to the blessed lands of Nascent Soul cultivators?</p><p>"It doesn't matter, a high-quality cave dwelling will do." Qin Sang said nonchalantly.</p><p>Refining demonic fire didn't require high-quality spiritual energy.</p><p>In his future plans, making enemies was unavoidable, especially in his search for the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. If he offended the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Ganlu Zen Monastery, he needed to plan an escape route.</p><p>Very few people knew the relationship between him and his avatar.</p><p>Separating in advance and acting independently would still be useful.</p><p>Jiang Mu didn't expect Qin Sang to make such a request, but he couldn't refuse.  Not only did he personally arrange it, vacating the best cave dwelling, but he also assigned servant girls for Qin Sang to command.</p><p>The cave dwelling was located on an immortal mountain in the northern part of Yanshui Market.</p><p>Qin Sang occupied an entire peak and lake, a scenic and secluded place within the bustling market.</p><p>After settling Qin Sang in, Jiang Mu took his leave, personally escorted to the door by Qin Sang.</p><p>Several servant girls lived in a small building by the lake, awaiting orders.</p><p>Qin Sang paid them no mind and returned to the cave dwelling alone.</p><p>He had already instructed Jiang Mu not to disturb him unless it was a top-level treasure exchange meeting, so he could cultivate in peace.  Looking around the cave dwelling, Qin Sang erased the original restrictions and personally set up a grand formation, sitting cross-legged.</p><p>The demonic banners floated before him.</p><p>The fire lotus faintly appeared on his forehead.</p><p>The petals of the fire lotus had bloomed a bit more.</p><p>Strands of demonic fire were silently refined by Qin Sang, transferring from one demonic banner to another.</p><p>Time flowed quietly in the dim cave dwelling.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, by the lakeside pavilion, the servant girls came and went, shift after shift.  They were arguably the most relaxed servant girls in the Six States Hall. From the time they entered to the time they left, they hadn't even seen the face of the person they were serving, much to the envy of others.</p><p>Every rotation would spark competition.</p><p>Everyone was curious about who lived on this mountain, someone Jiang Mu, the Grand Steward, had personally ordered not to be disturbed.</p><p>More than twenty years passed like this.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't leave the cave dwelling a single step, completely unconcerned about the changes in the outside world.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Black demonic fire leaped in the void.  At first, it was extremely violent and unruly, but it gradually became tamed, transforming into a water-like black flame, flowing into Qin Sang's forehead and merging with the fire lotus.</p><p>Day after day, this scene had been repeated countless times in the cave dwelling.</p><p>"It's indeed getting slower…"</p><p>A faint sigh suddenly echoed within the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, the fire lotus on his forehead vanished, and he waved his sleeve, putting away the demonic banners.</p><p>He sensed his own condition and could clearly feel the pressure from the Heavenly Dao. The Heavenly Tribulation was approaching!</p><p>He was truly bold and skilled.</p><p>Others trembled in fear when facing the tribulation, but Qin Sang, with the tribulation imminent, was still cultivating secret techniques and hadn't made many preparations.</p><p>"It's time to go out and prepare for the tribulation."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, adjusted his breath slightly, and walked out of the cave dwelling.</p><p>The dazzling sunlight shone on his body, and Qin Sang felt a touch of warmth.  He paused at the entrance and only then realized that the scenery of Yanshui Market was truly beautiful, but it took him more than twenty years to notice.</p><p>Cultivation had no concept of time, destined to miss much scenery.</p><p>The servant girls, with nothing to do, played by the lake, a scene of carefree bliss.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disturb them, quietly flying out of Yanshui Market. Passing by Pushan, his avatar sensed his true body and emerged from seclusion to join him, acting as his protector.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul retreated into his true body for nourishment.</p><p>Qin Sang learned of his avatar's progress over the years.</p><p>With the help of the ice disc, the "Ice Soul Divine Light" had advanced by leaps and bounds, and he hadn't felt any bottlenecks yet, suggesting a high probability of successfully cultivating the divine ability.</p><p>However, as the cultivation progressed, the Ice Soul Divine Light deviated more and more from the original version, and he didn't know what form it would eventually take upon completion.</p><p>Qin Sang had already chosen a location for the tribulation, a desolate wasteland between Zhuozhou and Zhaoyaozhou.</p><p>Flying over countless mountains and rivers.</p><p>A vast plain stretched out before him.</p><p>Qin Sang flew for a while longer, then descended, landing in the middle of the wasteland, releasing his avatar to check for any uninvited guests.</p><p>His true body began to get busy.</p><p>He prepared a spirit array for the tribulation, called the Profound Mirror Cold Fury Array, a fusion of the Profound Mirror Array of the Yuan Shen Sect and the Cold Yin Fierce Wind Array inherited from the Listening Snow Pavilion, incorporating the advantages of both arrays, but it was very complex to set up.</p><p>After setting up the array,</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged within the array and entered meditation, while his avatar stood guard not far away.</p><p>Half a month passed in a blink of an eye.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation hadn't arrived yet, but the pressure from the Heavenly Dao had already manifested.</p><p>The creatures in the wasteland sensed the danger and fled in panic without Qin Sang having to drive them away.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>Both the true body and the avatar looked up at the sky simultaneously.</p><p>Originally a clear blue sky, the sound of muffled thunder suddenly came.  The moment the thunder sounded, the sunlight dimmed abruptly, and then clouds gathered and winds rose.</p><p>Qi gathered from all directions, forming clouds.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, dark clouds rolled in the sky, frantically converging above Qin Sang's head.  The sky grew darker and darker, strong winds swept across the wasteland, withered grass danced in the air, and the world became a vast expanse of grey.</p><p>The avatar's clothes fluttered in the wind, he remained vigilant, scanning the surroundings, then his figure flickered and disappeared.</p><p>The true body remained motionless, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly perched on his shoulder, its wings opening and closing leisurely.</p><p>'Shing!'</p><p>The Goldfall Sword transformed into a streak of sword light, circling Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Heaven's Eye Butterfly from the corner of his eye. He was confident in overcoming this tribulation, but he had a more important task – to help the Heaven's Eye Butterfly devour more tribulation lightning.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The tribulation clouds quickly formed, giving the person undergoing the tribulation no time to breathe, and the tribulation lightning descended!</p><p>Lightning cascaded down like a waterfall.</p><p>The wasteland went through a cycle of darkness and light, and at this moment, it was as bright as day.</p><p>With a clear sword cry, the Goldfall Sword soared upwards.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flapped its wings and followed closely behind.</p><p>During the last Nascent Soul Tribulation, Qin Sang only dared to let it absorb stray lightning strands from the side.  Now, with the ability to handle unexpected situations, he dared to let the Heaven's Eye Butterfly face the tribulation lightning directly.</p><p>Thunder roared, and the Goldfall Sword was engulfed in the lightning.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Countless sword lights suddenly scattered, forming a disc of sword light in mid-air, blocking the tribulation lightning!</p><p>Amidst the rumbling, the sword light and tribulation lightning annihilated each other, but some tribulation lightning was intentionally let through by Qin Sang. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly flew towards it, its wings shooting out seemingly delicate lightning bolts, forming a lightning net, thicker and more solid than when it had broken through to its fourth transformation.</p><p>The scene of devouring tribulation lightning reappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed it again, still marveling, and his expectations for the Heaven's Eye Butterfly grew even greater.</p><p>Then, he sensed a feeling of pain from the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  Directly devouring tribulation lightning was more difficult than absorbing stray strands, but it still had the composure to act coquettishly, so it could definitely persevere.</p><p>Qin Sang comforted the Heaven's Eye Butterfly while wielding his sword to resist the tribulation lightning.</p>
