<h1>Chapter 791: Ambush</h1><p>Chapter 791: Ambush</p><p>He observed Madam Liu's movements.</p><p>Madam Liu was incredibly patient and determined, having been in ambush for an unknown length of time.</p><p>She hid in the woods, motionless, unaware of the presence of someone else lurking behind her.</p><p>Throughout, the Liu cultivator never appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang became increasingly certain that something had happened to the Liu cultivator.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the culprit was who he suspected.</p><p>Rare detoxification treasures were exceptionally rare; it was unlikely the Liu couple would coincidentally encounter enemies possessing such items.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>No one emerged from Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time; the Seven Killing Hall's closure was approaching. Continuing to wait passively wasn't wise; the others might not survive.</p><p>Just as he frowned, he noticed movement on the ancient bridge.</p><p>Petals fluttered; someone was coming out!</p><p>"They're here!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened; he noticed the sword energy in the mist tremble, clearly indicating Madam Liu's unrest.</p><p>Qin Sang held his breath, remaining still, watching the bridge entrance.</p><p>A person flew from Flower Fairy Lake.  Soon, Qin Sang saw a familiar protective barrier shielding the newcomer, resisting the pervasive poison in the air.</p><p>"It's the Bone Lotus!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned cold, his killing intent erupting.</p><p>He had anticipated this, realizing it was Madam Liu's trap.  Connected to the Liu couple and able to enter Flower Fairy Lake, it was highly likely to be Xiang Yi or his associates.</p><p>While unsure of the specifics of their encounter, Xiang Yi's ruthlessness made plotting with Cui Ji to murder the Liu couple entirely plausible.</p><p>Xiang Yi, Cui Ji, and the richly dressed fat man were all targets for elimination.</p><p>Encountering any of them within the Seven Killing Hall meant no mercy.</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his palm, secretly gripping the Fire Pearl.</p><p>If it was Cui Ji or the fat man, after his recent swordsmanship improvements, Qin Sang could overpower them with his sword alone.</p><p>Xiang Yi's strength far exceeded the other two. Since he had already used the Blood-Soiled Divine Light, to be safe, Qin Sang decided to use the Fire Pearl for an immediate kill.</p><p>He had saved the Fire Pearl for the Heavenly Tower journey, to deal with unforeseen crises, but hadn't needed it.</p><p>Using it to eliminate a powerful enemy before leaving the Seven Killing Hall was worthwhile.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly held the Fire Pearl in one hand and set up the Ten Directions Yama Banner restriction with the other, but remained cautious, observing the situation.</p><p>The mist stirred slightly, reflecting Madam Liu's turbulent emotions.</p><p>The person finally reached the bridge entrance.  He clearly hadn't expected an ambush, merely glancing around before exiting without much caution.</p><p>"Cui Ji! It's them…"</p><p>Recognizing the person.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted; finding the main target and eliminating Cui Ji first would be satisfying.</p><p>"It seems Cui Ji was after the Bone Lotus; their deal was the lotus…"</p><p>Qin Sang’s guess about their transaction was almost accurate. Just as he was about to put away the Fire Pearl, his expression changed; he was surprised to find Cui Ji had actually broken through to the late stage!</p><p>Before entering the Seven Killing Hall, Cui Ji had been stuck at a bottleneck. A trip to Flower Fairy Lake resulted in a breakthrough to the late Core Formation stage.</p><p>…</p><p>Cui Ji held the Bone Lotus, looking pleased with himself.</p><p>Part of the lotus petals were purple, others green, only one petal remained intact— the treasure was nearing its end.</p><p>Cui Ji was elated and thrilled.</p><p>He hadn't expected it to go so smoothly. Perhaps eliminating his enemies and obtaining the herb, then taking it, provided the breakthrough opportunity; everything happened effortlessly.</p><p>…</p><p>Cui Ji, smiling, stepped into the trap.  The sound of bells rang out; countless red threads, sharp as blades, suddenly appeared around him, his smile freezing.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly turned, staring at the mist.</p><p>"How will Madam Liu choose?"</p><p>This trap, facing a strengthened Cui Ji, seemed insufficient.</p><p>The thought barely formed.</p><p>A sword light shot from the mist, swift as lightning, accompanied by an angry shout: "Wicked villain, die!"</p><p>Madam Liu had decisively attacked.</p><p>Her trap was ingenious; the red thread soul bell array trapped Cui Ji by surprise, allowing her to swiftly kill him with her sword.</p><p>But fate was unpredictable. No one expected Cui Ji to breakthrough in Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>"You're looking for death!"</p><p>Cui Ji raged.</p><p>The red threads, extremely sharp, could cut flesh.  More terrifying were the bell sounds, which assaulted the soul.</p><p>His previous self would have fallen victim.</p><p>Cui Ji, though his cultivation was unstable, had made a breakthrough.  He braced against the ringing of the bells, his true energy surging as he successfully summoned the Purple幽 Pearl.  Purple light filled the air, forming a protective barrier around him.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A white light flashed, a flying dagger shooting out from the purple glow.</p><p>The red thread was no match for the dagger.</p><p>It snapped, the bells’ vibrations weakened.</p><p>Cui Ji’s eyes, like a predator's, locked onto his ambushers.  His expression changed dramatically, his eyes widening in shock.</p><p>"It's you! You weren't dead!"</p><p>His gaze quickly swept the area. Seeing only Madam Liu, he burst into a cruel laugh.  "Haha...only you remain.  You dare come to your death?  Excellent.  Today, Cui will settle this, eliminating any future trouble."</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>Streams of purple light shot forth.</p><p>Madam Liu arrived, her sword flying. Tears welled in her eyes, her face filled with frustration.</p><p>A moment faster, and she could have killed Cui Ji.  But she had failed.</p><p>Her cultivation was the lowest among the eight, and unlike Qin Sang, she lacked many defensive treasures.  Against the newly enhanced Cui Ji, she felt utterly powerless.</p><p>"Heaven is blind! To let this villain break through…"</p><p>Her eyes were vacant, her words an accusation to the heavens.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The radiant light struck her, deflecting her sword and halting her attack.</p><p>Suddenly, Madam Liu changed tactics, turning and fleeing into the mountains.  One blow missed, and she instantly retreated.</p><p>Cui Ji paused, a cruel smile spreading across his face. He immediately used his flying daggers to break the spirit array, escaping and quickly pursuing her.</p><p>Cui Ji closed in.</p><p>Madam Liu, anxious, suddenly called out towards where Qin Sang was hidden, "Fellow Daoist, what are you waiting for?  Don't you dare act now!"</p><p>Qin Sang's cover was blown, but he wasn't surprised. He was certain Madam Liu didn't know his identity.  Her action was a calculated diversion.</p><p>Cui Ji, now on edge,  believing a third person was involved, would assume they were allies.</p><p>Even after discovering the hidden presence, Madam Liu remained calm, feigning ignorance,  determined in her revenge.  But she calculated that if she succeeded and took Cui Ji's bone lotus, she could use it to escape into Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall was about to close; the hidden person couldn’t wait forever.</p><p>Her ability to instantly assess the situation and make a decision demonstrated remarkable intelligence and planning.  She was clearly no mere weak woman sheltered by her husband.</p>
