<h1>Chapter 1197: Investigation</h1><p>To use the teleportation array, one needed to spend a sum of spirit stones and present an identity token. However, Qin Sang was not afraid of the fragments of restrictions within the Heavenly Scar. On his shoulder, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly fluttered its wings, observing the surroundings and searching for gaps in the restrictions. With a flash, Qin Sang quietly entered the thick mist.</p><p>After entering the Sin Abyss, Qin Sang had kept the Heavenly Eye Butterfly outside to act as a sentry. Navigating through the gaps between the restriction fragments was a trivial task for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly. Without touching a single restriction, Qin Sang effortlessly crossed the Heavenly Scar and arrived on the other side. He unfolded a geomantic map, identified his direction, and swiftly headed toward the Near Scar Mountain.</p><p>A day later.</p><p>Qin Sang stood amidst a forest, looking up at the majestic mountain range shrouded in clouds. That was the Near Scar Mountain! After roughly surveying the area around the mountain, Qin Sang found two nearby marketplaces. However, the layout of the Sin Abyss was peculiar, as it did not shy away from mortals. The marketplaces were built close to mortal kingdoms. Currently, entering and exiting the marketplaces was strictly regulated. As an outsider, it would not be easy for Qin Sang to sneak in unnoticed.</p><p>"It seems I'll have to resort to my old tricks," Qin Sang muttered to himself. After a moment of contemplation, his figure vanished from the spot.</p><p>...</p><p>In a desolate mountain forest.</p><p>A gentle breeze swept through the woods, carrying with it a young man dressed in white. Though his cultivation was only at the Qi Refining stage, his demeanor was extraordinary as he gracefully moved through the forest. Despite his seemingly carefree appearance, his face was etched with deep anxiety, and he frequently glanced behind him.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>After flying out of the forest, there was still no sign of anything unusual behind him. The young man in white relaxed slightly, but then a voice suddenly rang in his ears.</p><p>"Kid, your Wind Riding Technique isn't bad. Keep running! Let's see how far you can go!"</p><p>The voice, filled with mocking laughter, seemed to come from all directions, like a cat toying with a mouse. The young man's expression changed drastically. He hurriedly activated the slender willow-leaf sword in his hand, slashing fiercely to the left. At the same time, he unleashed a spirit talisman he had been secretly holding in his other hand.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A burst of dense yellow light erupted from the ground, instantly forming a layer of earthen-yellow light shield. The spirit sword struck the shield, only managing to create a crack. But then the spirit talisman followed, transforming into a wisp of blue light. A surge of water-attribute spiritual power erupted, instantly condensing into over a dozen crystal-clear ice spikes, all of which struck the shield without fail.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The shield finally gave way and collapsed. Just as the young man's face began to show a hint of relief, he saw that there was nothing beneath the shield. The eerie laughter, like a persistent shadow, rang out again.</p><p>"Still a novice, huh? A simple spell tricked you into using your Thousand Spike Talisman! Do you have any other tricks up your sleeve? If not, it's my turn to act!"</p><p>Before the voice faded, the young man suddenly felt a chilling wind approaching from behind. He hastily swung his sword backward, only to strike empty air. With a clang, an iron ring firmly ensnared his spirit sword. The young man's face turned pale as he frantically reached for another magical tool in his storage pouch. But then he felt a cold sensation in his back. Looking down, he saw the bloodied tip of a sword protruding from his chest. The light in his eyes gradually dimmed.</p><p>After the young man died, a figure clad in black robes and wearing a bamboo hat materialized behind him. The man tossed the young man's corpse aside and expertly rummaged through his storage pouch. After a moment, he snorted, "Another poor wretch! Ever since those prestigious sects sealed their mountains and pulled their Foundation Establishment experts to the front lines, I haven't had to be as cautious as before. But it's been a while since I've made a big score."</p><p>As he spoke, the man began to dispose of the young man's body and clean up the battlefield. Suddenly, he caught a glimpse of a figure appearing behind him out of the corner of his eye. His hair stood on end.</p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>Qin Sang caught the flying sword with one hand and smiled at the black-robed man. "I'll borrow your body for a while."</p><p>Terror filled the black-robed man's face as he turned to flee, but in the next moment, he lost consciousness. Qin Sang waved his hand and took the unconscious man away. He decided to use the "Seed of Demonic Essence" technique to refine an external avatar, borrowing the man's identity to gather information.</p><p>Since he could no longer use sword souls to refine demonic seeds, Qin Sang had to resort to the original demonic technique, planting the seed in a living person. With the Near Scar Mountain sealed, it was impossible to find a disciple from the mountain for the time being. Qin Sang had no choice but to target rogue cultivators. He knew that around the marketplaces, there were always unscrupulous cultivators who preyed on others for profit. Sure enough, he found one.</p><p>As for the young man, although the invasion of the Sin Abyss could not be blamed on a mere Qi Refining cultivator, to Qin Sang, they were all enemies. If the young man had managed to escape the rogue cultivator, Qin Sang would not have held a grudge against him. But since he failed, it was simply a matter of his own lack of strength.</p><p>Qin Sang took the man to a remote mountain area, casually opened a cave, and tossed him inside. He then released Fat Chicken.</p><p>"Go somewhere far from the Near Scar Mountain and find a fresh Foundation Establishment cultivator's corpse. Also, scout around to see if there's any Earthly Fiend Qi nearby... Remember to keep a low profile and avoid alerting the surrounding forces. If you run into a Nascent Soul cultivator, even I won't be able to save you," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>If normal methods failed to uncover information about the Corpse Ghost Immortal, Qin Sang would have to refine a Fiend Corpse and have his external avatar parade it around as bait. A Fiend Corpse refined with unique Earthly Fiend Qi might attract the attention of those who were interested.</p><p>Fat Chicken accepted the order and left. Qin Sang busied himself in the cave. His current cultivation level was far beyond what it had been, making the "Seed of Demonic Essence" technique much easier to execute than when he was at the Golden Core stage. Moreover, since this was merely a tool, he did not need to nurture it to the Golden Core or Nascent Soul stage, so there was no need to be overly meticulous.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's current perspective had changed. He could now confirm that this demonic avatar technique was not a top-tier secret art and had its flaws. Using normal methods, it was impossible to cultivate the external avatar to the Nascent Soul stage, making it a waste of effort. Unless, like Senior Green Bamboo, he found an external Nascent Soul technique.</p><p>In just a few days, Qin Sang refined a barely usable demonic seed and implanted it into the cultivator's body, successfully creating an external avatar. The avatar was a short, timid-looking middle-aged cultivator who shakily stood up, looking somewhat dazed at Qin Sang. Gradually, his eyes regained clarity, and he nodded at Qin Sang before sitting down cross-legged.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hesitate to exhaust the avatar's potential, continuously using blood nourishment techniques to forcibly boost its cultivation. During this time, Fat Chicken returned, bringing back a corpse and information about Earthly Fiend Qi.</p><p>"Master, about a thousand miles south of the Near Scar Mountain, within the Heavenly Scar, there's a place where Earthly Fiend Qi has accumulated. The area is even larger than the Earth Sink Cave you mentioned. All the Foundation Establishment cultivators know about it. I asked around and found out easily," Fat Chicken reported, pointing at the corpse. "However, he had never heard of the Corpse Ghost Immortal. Following your strict orders, I didn't dare to capture too many people."</p><p>"Could this be the reason the Corpse Ghost Immortal came to the Near Scar Mountain? Did he obtain the corpse refinement technique only after reaching the Golden Core stage?" Qin Sang pondered thoughtfully.</p><p>This posed a problem. It would be difficult to trace where the Corpse Ghost Immortal came from and how he obtained the Heavenly Corpse Sect's legacy. Leaving Fat Chicken and the external avatar in the cave, Qin Sang took the corpse and headed toward the location Fat Chicken had mentioned.</p>
