<h1>Chapter 2023: The Abyss</h1><p>As Qin Sang continued forward, a powerful suction force tore at him, pushing him towards the 'void.'</p><p>Nearing the edge of the black disc, Qin Sang didn't stop. He entered the disc and immediately felt the suction intensify, accompanied by a rotational force.  He activated his blood Qi, relying on his powerful physique to forcibly remain stationary. He felt as though he had fallen into a gigantic grinding mill, constantly being crushed.</p><p>Qin Sang experienced this for a while, then retreated. He retrieved some spirit materials from the Qianjun Ring and casually refined two puppets, tossing them towards the black disc.</p><p>As soon as the puppets entered the black disc, they were swept up by the suction, rapidly spinning along its surface. Their speed increased exponentially until, almost instantly, they were sucked into the void.</p><p>Due to their lack of power, the puppets were utterly incapable of resisting the suction.  Consequently, they weren't crushed by the disc.  Until they were swallowed by the void, their bodies remained intact, practically undamaged.</p><p>Qin Sang observed this scene, but couldn't determine whether the void was safe based on it.  He saw the puppets vanish the moment they touched the void.  He immediately lost his connection with them, unable to learn what they encountered after entering.</p><p>However, through this test, Qin Sang gleaned some clues.  He pondered whether there was anything he could utilize, and what method he could employ to explore the void's interior.</p><p>Sending anyone or anything into the void required the覚悟 to lose it forever, as well as a way to break through the void's blockade and transmit information back. Otherwise, it would be a wasted effort.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered and pondered. Besides venturing close to the void himself, awakening the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, and attempting to peer into the void with its divine ability, there seemed to be no other viable method.</p><p>Not rushing to awaken the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang decided to try other methods first. He manifested his Dharma Body, repeatedly entering the black disc, experiencing the power of the suction, constantly pushing his limits, and employing various secret techniques to probe.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was diligently working, he suddenly felt a wisp of cool breeze brush his face.</p><p>The breeze was exceptionally gentle, like a warm spring breeze, something ordinary people wouldn't notice. But appearing here, it felt somewhat abrupt and eerie.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  He abruptly looked towards the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Zhu Que and the other demon queens belatedly noticed something amiss. Recalling the legends of the Fengju Jade Gate, they cried out, "It's the Evil Wind!"</p><p>Of the two great calamities, the Evil Wind and the Ghostly Thunder, this was Qin Sang's first encounter with the former after entering the Fengju Jade Gate for so long.</p><p>These two calamities sometimes appeared individually, sometimes ravaged together, without any pattern. As the cries rang out, the Evil Wind's force increased at an alarming rate.</p><p>Surrounded by the tightly packed illusionary landscapes created by divine abilities, the Evil Wind seemed to permeate everything, continuously blowing, whistling in his ears.</p><p>It was said that the Evil Wind's power fluctuated, sometimes weak, sometimes strong.  When weak, its destructive power was limited. But their current location was too precarious, situated amidst these illusionary landscapes.  If the Evil Wind triggered the dormant power within them, anyone would be terrified. Moreover, there was an even more terrifying, eerie black hole nearby.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.  Without hesitation, he reached out with his large hand, directly pulling Zhu Que and the other demons to his side. His true body then carried them away, flying away from the area, leaving his Dharma Body behind.</p><p>This was incredibly risky, but it presented a rare opportunity to observe the void using the Evil Wind.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!’</p><p>By the time Qin Sang rushed out of the area of illusionary landscapes, the Evil Wind's force had intensified to a terrifying degree.</p><p>The invisible wind blew incessantly from the depths of the Fengju Jade Gate, leaving visible streaks in the void as it passed, like bone-chilling steel blades, except these blades were cutting through the void itself.</p><p>Looking around, the Evil Wind was everywhere, even the illusionary landscapes couldn't block its invasion.  When the Evil Wind brushed against his body, even with Qin Sang's powerful physique, he felt waves of chilling coldness.</p><p>Zhu Que, riding the Fire Jade Centipede, with flames rising around her, was in a better state. Gui Hou and Luo Hou huddled together, jointly resisting the Evil Wind.</p><p>‘Clatter, clatter, clatter…’</p><p>The captured cultivator, whose cultivation was sealed, immediately began to tremble from the cold, his face ashen as a layer of frost rapidly spread across his body.  Zhu Que intervened, shielding him, and his condition improved.</p><p>At this moment, cultivators elsewhere were also assaulted by the Evil Wind. The interior of the Fengju Jade Gate was in chaos, and some perished without even understanding why.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the void through his Dharma Body. As the Evil Wind intensified, the black disc became unstable. Ripples appeared on its surface, occasionally erupting with black jets.</p><p>Sensing the power of the jets, Qin Sang's Dharma Body's expression grew grave.  He retreated further and further. Finally, his expression changed completely.  He transformed into a bolt of lightning, frantically retreating.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang witnessed a breathtaking sight.  A torrential black tide surged forward, engulfing the illusionary landscape closest to the black disc.</p><p>Qin Sang watched as this illusionary landscape, as if squeezed by an external force, first compressed and deformed, then its front protruded, pulled and elongated by the suction, transforming into a thin, long ribbon of light. It spiraled towards the void until it was completely swallowed.</p><p>These illusions were formed by the divine abilities of ancient mighty figures, almost indistinguishable from reality. Qin Sang had witnessed the destruction of illusions before, but he had never seen anything swallow an illusion whole, with the illusion offering no resistance whatsoever.</p><p>As the black tide erupted, the area became incredibly dangerous.  Qin Sang's Dharma Body, seemingly oblivious, stared intently at the void.</p><p>When the illusionary landscape was swallowed by the void, the anticipated conflict and explosion didn't occur. The illusion simply vanished silently.  Illusionary landscapes also contained immense power. If it were being destroyed by the void, it shouldn't have been so peaceful.</p><p>"Could it be that the void truly leads to another place?"</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Body didn't linger.  He flew away.  Reaching the edge of the area where the illusionary landscapes converged, he noticed a sphere of light slowly drifting from the void. It was an isolated illusionary landscape floating in the void.</p><p>"Could it have been pulled in by the void?"</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely understood.  When the black disc erupted, the void would swallow the surrounding illusionary landscapes. But simultaneously, the surrounding illusions would be drawn in, replenishing the void, which was why it was perpetually surrounded by them.</p><p>"What a gluttonous thing!" Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Whether it was the Fengju Jade Gate or the Ju Mountain Zhi Zhi Altar, there were too many existences that defied common sense.</p><p>His Dharma Body merged with his true body.  He waited for a while, and the Evil Wind showed signs of weakening.  Once it subsided, Qin Sang returned to the location and discovered the black disc had reverted to its original form.</p><p>Since even the illusionary landscapes couldn't probe the void's secrets, he decided not to waste any more thought on it.  He memorized the location and left with Zhu Que and the others.</p><p>This Evil Wind incident didn't cause much damage. Afterwards, Qin Sang continued his usual routine, traveling all over.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, it was their seventh year within the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren had yet to appear.</p><p>Qin Sang diligently sought an escape route for himself, identifying several locations and attempting to create retreat paths.  Coupled with the enigmatic void, he now had three preliminary choices. However, he still felt it wasn't enough.  These were sufficient to evade Nascent Soul cultivators, but against Soul Formation or even Greater Ascension stage powerhouses, their effectiveness was unknown.</p><p>He never stopped searching. Gu Ya, after fully recovering, also ventured out to assist Zhu Que. Su Nu remained in secluded cultivation to heal her injuries, while the Xin family had yet to find their target.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that his request for the Xin family to search for the Earth Essence Jade Rose Vine actually yielded a few vague clues.  However, Qin Sang wasn't focused on this and hadn't gone to verify them.</p><p>On this day, it was time for their scheduled meeting.</p><p>Qin Sang went to meet with the Xin family members. As expected, all their teams returned empty-handed.  He wondered what the Xin family was searching for, something so deeply hidden.</p><p>Just as they were discussing whether to change their strategy, a streak of escaping light flew towards them. Judging by its direction, it came from outside the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>The escaping light arrived before the carriage, revealing a Nascent Soul cultivator, a young man in appearance.</p><p>“Xin Ming, why are you here? Did something major happen outside?” Steward Luo stepped forward and asked.</p><p>The Xin family hadn’t brought all their people into the Fengju Jade Gate.  Some remained outside.</p><p>Xin Ming hastily bowed towards the carriage and, isolating their voices, urgently said, “Reporting to Young Master, Uncle Luo, something happened at Jade Gate City!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Steward Luo’s heart skipped a beat.  Xin Ming’s technique couldn’t block Qin Sang and Fellow Cultivator Pei, who also immediately looked over.</p><p>Jade Gate City had stood for many years. What could possibly happen? Could someone dare attack it?</p><p>“Not long ago, mighty figures battled near Jade Gate City. The entire city was alarmed.  The collision of their divine abilities sent shockwaves throughout the heavens and earth, plunging everything into darkness, with flying sand and rocks…”</p><p>Recalling the scene, Xin Ming's eyes were filled with terror. He swallowed, “Jade Gate City activated its protective formation, but under the impact of the shockwaves, the ground still trembled, as if it were about to crumble at any moment.  With a deafening thunderclap, a massive crack appeared on the western city wall, nearly collapsing…”</p><p>Listening to Xin Ming’s description, Qin Sang and Fellow Cultivator Pei's expressions changed dramatically.</p><p>Jade Gate City had stood before the Fengju Jade Gate for countless years. It was the western gate of Dui Province, and the strength of its protective formation was beyond doubt. The partial display of power Qin Sang witnessed upon entering the city was enough to dissuade him from any thought of forcing his way in.</p><p>Merely the residual waves of the battle, even through the formation, nearly destroyed the city walls. Were those who fought at the Soul Formation or Greater Ascension stage? What did the sudden appearance of two mighty figures near the Fengju Jade Gate signify?</p><p>Was it a coincidence, or was there some unknown change afoot?</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, feeling uneasy.  Could one of them be Tian Yue Shangren, entangled by an adversary?</p><p>“Who were those involved?” Fellow Cultivator Pei asked the question on Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>“Unclear,” Xin Ming shook his head. “From beginning to end, the two mighty figures didn’t reveal themselves. The people in the city could only see raging storms and dazzling light in the sky. In the end, both mighty figures departed, and no one knows who won or lost.”</p><p>They left. Could they be heading towards the Fengju Jade Gate?</p><p>Qin Sang and Fellow Cultivator Pei exchanged glances.</p><p>“What’s the situation in Jade Gate City now?” Qin Sang followed up.</p><p>“After the battle, rumors are rampant, saying a great war is about to erupt here. The Immortal City is in a panic, fearing they’ll be caught in the crossfire. Many have left the city, fleeing towards the heart of Dui Province.  It’s said that a similar situation occurred when the Sword Pavilion fragments were first discovered, but it wasn’t as impactful as this battle between mighty figures, which affected almost the entire city. Outsiders, rogue cultivators, aristocratic families, sects, and major trading houses are all evacuating, creating utter chaos…”</p><p>Xin Ming’s words made everyone’s expressions even graver. They were inside the Fengju Jade Gate, closer to the heart of the storm than Jade Gate City.</p><p>“Did the people from the Five Elements Alliance leave as well?” Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xin Ming hesitated. He knew Qin Sang was an elder of the Five Elements Alliance, a helper invited by the Young Master.</p><p>“Spit it out! Speak frankly!” Young Master Xin scolded.  This was the first time he spoke, his tone revealing little emotion.</p><p>“This junior passed by the Five Elements Alliance’s gate and saw that they had closed their doors to visitors, but I’m unsure if they have evacuated everyone. Jade Gate City is practically deserted. Many sects that have been rooted there for years have sealed their mountain gates and left the city to seek refuge. It's extremely chaotic inside the city now,” Xin Ming quickly replied.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that the Five Elements Alliance must have withdrawn. They were a business-oriented organization; seeking fortune and avoiding disaster was their instinct. With the Five Elements Alliance’s size, they had no need to take risks.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance was secondary.  The key was the two mysterious mighty figures. Why did they come, and where were they now?</p><p>Even before Tian Yue Shangren’s arrival, turmoil had already begun.</p><p>The news Xin Ming brought was earth-shattering. Steward Luo was filled with worry, “Young Master, I fear the Fengju Jade Gate won’t be peaceful either. Should we leave first and avoid this…”</p><p>Young Master Xin remained silent for a moment, then simply said, “There’s no turning back after the arrow is loosed!”</p><p>Steward Luo sighed deeply.</p><p>“Let’s observe for a while longer,” Young Master Xin said. “But we can no longer spread our forces so thin.  Consolidate into three groups…”</p><p>While master and servant discussed, Fellow Cultivator Pei’s expression shifted between cloudy and clear, as if weighing something.</p><p>“This news is too startling.  This old man will take his leave first,” Qin Sang said, cupping his hands in farewell.</p><p>Noticing Young Master Xin’s gaze, Qin Sang added, “Rest assured, Young Master Xin.  Your family has helped this old man search for so long.  Even if there’s no merit, there’s certainly effort. Unless absolutely necessary, this old man will not go back on his word.”</p><p>“Thank you, Elder Qin.”</p><p>Young Master Xin rose and bowed deeply.</p><p>Fellow Cultivator Pei’s eyes narrowed slightly, watching Qin Sang’s retreating figure, but he didn’t speak.</p><p>After bidding farewell to the Xin family, Qin Sang considered his next move. It seemed he needed to recall Zhu Que and the others to his side to avoid any unforeseen accidents.</p><p>And Su Nu.  He wondered how her injuries were. This was no place for secluded cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly located Zhu Que and the others.  Considering that he didn’t want Gu Ya and Su Nu to meet for the time being, he went to Su Nu’s cave alone.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu again, her complexion had improved, though a trace of paleness lingered. She hadn’t fully recovered.</p><p>“Thank you for your warning, Brother Qin. It seems this little sister must leave first. Once my strength recovers, I’ll consider my next course of action. Won’t Brother Qin leave with me to avoid this danger?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, “I still have unfinished business. If I sense anything amiss, I will immediately leave and meet up with you.”</p><p>Hearing this, Su Nu didn’t pry further.  She cautioned, “Brother Qin, please be careful!”</p><p>They agreed on a meeting place, and Qin Sang bid her farewell.</p><p>As Qin Sang’s escaping light disappeared into the distance, a man suddenly emerged from behind Su Nu.</p><p>The man’s figure flickered, his entire body enveloped in an ethereal aura, appearing profound and unfathomable.  He gazed in the direction Qin Sang had left, seemingly able to see his retreating figure through the void. After a moment of silence, he said, “From now on, you will stay by his side.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Su Nu bowed in acknowledgement.</p>
