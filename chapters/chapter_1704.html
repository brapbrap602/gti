<h1>Chapter 1695: The Summons</h1><p>“His Spirit Fire possesses the might of a Nascent Soul Grandmaster. Are you truly unmoved, old monk?” Green Fox Holy King retorted.</p><p>“Although this poor monk was preoccupied at the time and didn't sense the aura of the Spirit Fire, based on their descriptions, it seemed to be a Demonic Flame, wasn't it?” Radiant Light Holy One saw through Green Fox Holy King’s intentions with a single glance.</p><p>Both the Soul Calming Incense formula and the Southern Bright Ember Fire were things she was determined to obtain.  It was Qin Sang's misfortune to possess such treasures.</p><p>Green Fox Holy King was speechless.</p><p>Radiant Light Holy One didn't press the matter further and cautioned, “Unless this flame can be refined by Your Holiness, greatly enhancing your cultivation and divine abilities, it's best to leave it be. If it's merely for another combat method, this flame's power is too ferocious, and I fear it would be difficult to control.  Using it rashly in the Returning Ruins, causing violent fluctuations, might attract hordes of savage beasts, placing us in even greater danger. This person is already a frightened bird; force cannot be used. Your Holiness had best heed this poor monk’s words and refrain from acting recklessly, creating unnecessary complications."</p><p>The Returning Ruins of the Eastern Sea were teeming with ferocious beasts.</p><p>Even before the Heavenly Dao’s Demonic Resonance provoked the beasts, the Returning Ruins were extremely perilous.  Even Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't venture in unless they had reached an impasse and made thorough preparations.</p><p>Now, with the savage beasts driven mad by the demonic resonance, it was unknown what the scene within their lairs was like.</p><p>For those seeking eastward ascension, ferocious beasts were one of the greatest threats.</p><p>Especially within the Returning Ruins. They might be able to handle a single beast, but if a confrontation escalated, the resulting fluctuations would likely attract even more.</p><p>"If I could subdue the Artifact Spirit and control that treasure," Green Fox Holy King glanced at the Five Elements Crown atop the demonic body, her tone finally softening, "I wouldn't need to covet anything else."</p><p>Of course, she also understood that after this failure, capturing that man again would be extremely difficult.</p><p>Unless she and the old monk personally intervened, anyone else encountering him would be courting death.</p><p>If there was any disturbance and that man sensed danger, he could simply vanish, or even escape Central Continent and find a refuge within the Storm Belt. Were they supposed to postpone their ascension indefinitely, remaining in Central Continent until they found him?</p><p>The old monk was a local power; finding that man would still rely on the strength of the Buddhist Sect.</p><p>The most pressing matter at hand was to find a way to help the ancient demon suppress its madness and recover some semblance of sentience, so they could interrogate it about the secrets. Incidentally, they could also verify some of their previous theories about the Heavenly Dao’s Demonic Resonance through the ancient demon.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Several monks rushed towards the broken mountain.</p><p>The presence of other colored spiritual lights within the five-colored cloud indicated that the Five Elements Divine Prohibition hadn't completely destroyed all the formations on the mountain. They were tasked with salvaging the remaining treasures of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Other Buddhist experts were also scattered throughout, occupying key locations within the legacy grounds and driving away unrelated individuals.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were short-handed, and due to the successive unforeseen events, the crowd had scattered as soon as the demonic body showed signs of defeat. The passage to the legacy grounds was also continuously expanding, now covering almost half of the Taiyue Mountain Range. The legacy grounds were about to re-emerge into the present world.  Radiant Light Holy One’s plan to capture everyone was no longer feasible. She could only focus on securing control over the legacy grounds first.</p><p>In the sky.</p><p>The Venom King had emerged from the grey cocoon, having narrowly escaped death. His gaze flickered uncertainly as he surveyed the mountains of the legacy grounds.</p><p>He had just learned from Yue Lingtian about the events that had transpired while he was trapped, feeling both fortunate and apprehensive.</p><p>Fortunate that he had leaned towards negotiation before and hadn’t forged a deadly feud with that man. Apprehensive because the Gu King had fallen into the hands of such a figure. How could he retrieve it?</p><p>Mo Xingdao circulated his Qi while observing Green Fox Holy King and Radiant Light Holy One, then glanced at the others before discreetly retreating. Unexpectedly, a voice transmission reached his ears, causing him to freeze.</p><p>…</p><p>"Injured as I am, I cannot rise to greet you. Please forgive my discourtesy."</p><p>Within a crude stone dwelling carved into the side of a desolate mountain, Qin Sang ceased his healing and looked at Liuli who had entered. A smile appeared on his pale face.</p><p>It was evident that smiling was a struggle for him, requiring him to force the corners of his mouth upwards.</p><p>His avatar had delivered Liuli and then hastily departed.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "Previously, my avatar assumed the identity of Patriarch Xie of the Pu Mountain Xie Clan. This exposure of my true identity, and provoking a Demonic Saint, might bring disaster upon the Xie Clan. I have several friends still in Pu Mountain, unaware of the changes here. I must send a message to warn them, so they can prepare."</p><p>The quickest way, before the rumors spread, was through the Six Continents Hall, though he wasn’t sure if it would be in time.</p><p>Qin Sang could only do his best and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>With Ghost Mother presiding, he hoped they would be able to make proper arrangements.</p><p>Liuli nodded slightly, noticing Qin Sang's severe injuries. "What are your plans now?"</p><p>"Naturally, to find a place to heal…"</p><p>Qin Sang twitched the corners of his mouth, but unexpectedly aggravated his internal injuries, nearly causing him to gasp in pain.</p><p>He managed to maintain his smile with great effort, gazing at Liuli.  She wore a grey Buddhist robe, and though she wore a monk's hat, he could still see the coiled black hair beneath the brim.</p><p>The lay practitioner attire not only failed to conceal Liuli's exquisite beauty, but added a touch of elegance and serenity, softening her usual icy demeanor, making her seem less unapproachable than before.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a strange sense of relief.</p><p>When Liuli had cut her hair and resolutely departed, he had thought they would never meet again.</p><p>Looking at the familiar face, he couldn’t help but blurt out, "Fortunately, Fairy didn't truly shave her head."</p><p>Liuli remained silent, staring at him coldly.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly fell silent, letting out a couple of dry laughs.  In his current state, it was best not to be too presumptuous.  Otherwise, Liuli could kill him with a single slap.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed that Liuli's cultivation was still at Mid Nascent Soul, but her aura was already comparable to his avatar's, at the peak of Mid Nascent Soul.</p><p>"Fairy's cultivation…?"</p><p>Remembering that Liuli could still sense him meant that the dangers of the demonic technique hadn't been completely resolved. Could it be that she was again stuck at a bottleneck?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel concerned.</p><p>Liuli said calmly, "When the legacy grounds emerged, I sensed a breakthrough opportunity and was about to enter seclusion."</p><p>Guessing what Qin Sang wanted to ask, Liuli paused, looked at him, and said, "You can shield the brand."</p><p>Both having cultivated the *Mysterious Feminine Jade Cauldron Scripture*, Qin Sang held the dominant position.</p><p>Although she diligently suppressed the brand, if Qin Sang wished, a single thought could undo her efforts and reveal the brand’s secret.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed entirely unaware of this, which could only mean he had never entertained such thoughts. Even during the confrontation with Yin Changsheng in the Sacred Ground, when she had willingly opened her mind, Qin Sang had merely borrowed her True Essence to control the Sun God Tree and then immediately severed the connection, without any extraneous thoughts or actions.</p><p>"It would still be best to find a way to remove the brand as soon as possible!" Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Judging by Liuli's tone, while her Buddhist cultivation had been quite effective, it seemed insufficient to completely eliminate the hidden danger.</p><p>Since the topic of breakthroughs had arisen, Qin Sang retrieved a jade sphere from his Thousand Treasures Ring and offered it to Liuli.</p><p>The jade sphere was the size of a baby's fist, radiating a pure emerald light, shimmering like a night pearl.  It contained countless tiny cavities, nested within each other.  However, some parts appeared incomplete, unfinished.</p><p>The jade sphere was the Sky Exquisite embryo.</p><p>Liuli didn't accept it, but her gaze was drawn to the Sky Exquisite, instinctively recognizing it as something extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, "This object is called the Sky Exquisite. I obtained it from an opponent. It's a supreme treasure crafted by the Wood Lineage, capable of assisting in breaking through to Nascent Soul.  For advancement to Nascent Soul, the step of Heaven-Man Resonance is crucial, closely related to one's spiritual roots… You know that I possess five spiritual roots, making this item useless to me.  I also don't lack treasures to aid in breakthroughs.  I intend to trade that Five Elements Pellet with Mo Xingdao for the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit, though I'm uncertain if he'll escape."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang retrieved a wooden box, revealing the azure sphere that recorded the Sky Exquisite's secret technique.</p><p>Liuli extended her divine sense into the sphere. After reading the contents, a strange expression crossed her face.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Liuli shook her head. "It was just a small effort on my part."</p><p>Her temperament hadn't changed at all!</p><p>Despite all he had said, he still couldn't persuade Liuli to accept.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, "To you, it might be a small effort, but to me, it was a life-saving grace.  Moreover, Fairy took a great risk by intervening.  Having cultivated Buddhist Dharma, are you unaware that your guardedness towards me is itself an attachment?  Following the natural course is the true path."</p><p>Liuli still held firm to her position, only making a copy of the sphere's contents. "I haven't yet reached Late Nascent Soul.  I have ample time to gather resources and refine the Sky Exquisite.  Since the Moon Laurel Immortal Dew has appeared in Central Continent before, it hasn't vanished entirely.  It might not be impossible to find."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, but in the end, could only withdraw the Sky Exquisite embryo.</p><p>"In that case, I'll safeguard this for Fairy for the time being.  Furthermore, I still have a stick of Soul Calming Incense. If Fairy has need of it, please don't hesitate to ask."</p><p>Liuli gave a noncommittal response.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't press the matter further and changed the subject. "Which sect did Fairy join?  Will today's events have any adverse consequences?"</p><p>With the teleportation passage exposed, the relationship between that sect and the Formless Immortal Sect would also be revealed.</p><p>If any consequences arose, the sect might direct its anger towards Liuli.</p><p>"Veiled Moon Convent.  Our founding ancestor once formed a Dao Companion bond with an elder of the Formless Immortal Sect. After the Formless Immortal Sect's destruction, our members sought refuge in seclusion, using other identities when venturing out…"  Liuli briefly explained the origins of the Veiled Moon Convent.</p><p>Learning that the founder of the Veiled Moon Convent hailed from the Water Lineage and had strong ties to the Metal Lineage, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He hurriedly retrieved several items.</p><p>There were jade slips obtained from the Ice Instrument Palace, containing the inheritances of the Water Phase Hall, such as *Grand Unity Water Storage*, *Lightless Shield*, *Primordial Silence Divine Wheel*, and *Misty Ripple Shadow Clone*.</p><p>There was also the golden sword obtained from Emperor Bestowal Mountain, containing the sword formation inheritance of the Metal Phase Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang handed them all to Liuli, leaving their arrangements to her.</p><p>Scanning the contents of the jade slips and the golden sword, Liuli couldn't help but glance at Qin Sang once more, surprised by the abundance of his harvest from the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>This time, Liuli didn't refuse.</p><p>She had lied about returning to the Secret Hall to retrieve treasures, but her true intention was to rescue Qin Sang.  The old nun had seen through her deception, yet hadn’t become angry, even lending a hand.  In the end, they hadn’t managed to retrieve the treasures within the Secret Hall.</p><p>This favor had to be repaid.</p><p>Returning the inheritances of the two lineages would give them an explanation.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to their long separation, or perhaps they had become estranged. After discussing these important matters, Qin Sang found himself at a loss for words. Liuli, with her naturally cold and frosty demeanor, was even less likely to initiate conversation.</p><p>For a time, silence descended upon the dwelling, as they looked at each other without speaking.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang glanced outside. "My avatar should be nearing the nearby Six Continents Hall.  Does Fairy know who is currently at the Xie Clan?"</p><p>Not expecting Liuli to offer him a way out of the awkward silence, Qin Sang answered his own question, "I was originally traveling north to Golden Jade Continent to attend the Ullambana Assembly, but unexpectedly encountered Senior Ghost Mother there.  Being able to arrive in time before the legacy grounds emerged was also thanks to her guidance. I initially came for the Central Continent Immortal Palace, but unexpectedly, the path to the Immortal Palace was broken. Judging by True Person Eight Sceneries Purple Thunder's actions, he must have ascended to the upper realm as well."</p><p>Hearing the name Ghost Mother, Liuli's eyes flickered.  "Ya Gu?"</p><p>Finally, a response!</p><p>It was remarkable that she still remembered Ya Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted, and he smiled. "My previous efforts weren't in vain. After Senior Ghost Mother's examination, Ya Gu's condition is stable.  Senior Ghost Mother is helping her, and I'm certain she'll be able to undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and awaken her."</p><p>Liuli seemed to be infected by Qin Sang's smile, her expression softening slightly as she softly said, "Congratulations."</p><p>Qin Sang knew she must be thinking of her Master.</p><p>In a way, they were both bound by their obsessions. His obsession was about to be resolved, while Liuli and her Master were separated by realms, their reunion seemingly distant.</p><p>"Rest assured, Fairy. Your Master is blessed and will surely overcome her perils. I learned many secrets from Senior Ghost Mother this time…"</p><p>Qin Sang spoke quickly, relaying everything he had learned from Ghost Mother to Liuli.</p><p>"The Ascension Platform has flown to the Demonic Realm, though the Immortal Palace and the Ascension Platform shouldn't be on the same path… The ascension from the Immortal Palace was a grand event. Unless someone in the upper realm had made prior arrangements to conceal it, there would definitely be news circulating.  Senior Ghost Mother is preparing for ascension. I'll ask her to investigate this matter after arriving in the upper realm.  Perhaps she can find news of your Master, and even better, offer assistance. After we ascend, we'll visit Senior Ghost Mother in the Witch Clan."</p><p>"Ascension…"</p><p>Liuli appeared wistful, yet there was also a hint of anticipation in her eyes.</p><p>This anticipation was the driving force behind her relentless efforts.</p><p>With his avatar still absent, Qin Sang decided not to wait any longer.  He suggested they depart and shamelessly requested her protection. "To avoid troubling you twice, could Fairy escort me for a while longer?"</p><p>Learning that Cave Master Weeping Spirit had also died at Qin Sang’s hands, Liuli was speechless.</p><p>How long had they been in Central Continent? How did this man have enemies everywhere?</p><p>Cave Master Weeping Spirit was a notorious figure in the Southern Barbarian Continents, feared for his mastery of ghost arts and unpredictable, eerie divine abilities. Once targeted by him, one might die without even knowing how, often without even the luxury of death.</p><p>Sects like the Myriad Venom Mountain and Taiyue Sect were reluctant to provoke such a sinister individual.</p><p>He rarely appeared after achieving a certain level of cultivation, but his notoriety remained undiminished.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he had died here without a sound.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to go to Cave Master Weeping Spirit's dwelling first, though not the one known publicly.</p><p>This cunning individual had multiple hideouts. The medicinal garden was located in his most secret dwelling, the location unknown even to his disciples. Perhaps he could find spiritual medicines there to aid his recovery, allowing him to recover faster.</p><p>He could recuperate within Cave Master Weeping Spirit's dwelling, but being too close to the Venom King wasn't a long-term solution.</p><p>After consuming some medicinal pellets, Qin Sang was barely able to move.</p><p>Cave Master Weeping Spirit's dwelling was situated in an uninhabited region of the Barbarian Continent. The two traveled southwest. The Southern Barbarian Continents were vast and sparsely populated, with miasma pervading the land, so they didn't have to worry about revealing their tracks.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang recounted his experiences over the years and learned that Liuli had originally intended to find a Buddhist temple in the Western Desert for quiet cultivation, but had unexpectedly encountered the Abbess during her travels.</p><p>They journeyed together through the Western Desert, forming a bond.  Liuli accepted the Abbess's invitation to join the Veiled Moon Convent and, under the Abbess's counsel, chose to cultivate while retaining her hair.  She hadn't left the convent since.</p>
