<h1></h1><p>Initially, Qin Sang had cultivated a Yuanmo clone and dispatched it to the Lan Dou Sect to gather intelligence.  By a twist of fate, it was recognized by the Yin-Yang lineage of the Lan Dou Sect and received the *Yin-Yang Heaven Battling Secret Art*.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect's inheritance of this art only contained the first layer. Later, a remarkably talented predecessor, a Yin-Yang Daoist, completed the technique and passed down a lineage.</p><p>This cultivation method involves condensing Yin-Yang Armor and cultivating Yin-Yang Qi from the very beginning of cultivation, making it incredibly profound.</p><p>Qin Sang was once quite tempted and even considered it as a backup cultivation method for the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*. Later, he discovered that the technique was incomplete and that the true inheritance of the lineage was difficult to obtain, so he abandoned the idea.</p><p>However, he had already cultivated the first layer of the *Yin-Yang Heaven Battling Secret Art* and condensed a set of Yin-Yang Armor, using it to conceal the Buddha's light emanating from the Jade Buddha within his Primordial Spirit.</p><p>For many years, the Yin-Yang Armor hadn't served any purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang also didn't have the energy to comprehend this technique, so he had shelved it, almost forgetting about it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it now stirred within him; the treasure within the jade cage seemed to have some connection with this cultivation method!</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished, his gaze fixed on the sphere of light.</p><p>The jade cage was carved from Spiritual Jade, preventing his Heavenly Eye from seeing the treasure inside.</p><p>If his divine sense probed into the Cloud Pond, it would be met with a repelling force. To know what treasure was sealed inside, he had to find a way to fish out the jade cage.</p><p>He didn't waste much time on the lower level of the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>Time was not of the essence.</p><p>He was also curious about what treasure was connected to the *Yin-Yang Heaven Battling Secret Art*. Although he had only cultivated the first layer, Qin Sang believed that this technique definitely had a profound origin and was a grand inheritance!</p><p>He turned around, staring at the drifting jade cage, his body moving along the surrounding corridors, maintaining the shortest distance to the cage.</p><p>At the same time, guided by Qin Sang, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly urged its Heavenly Eye power to its limit, carefully investigating and pondering the safest method to retrieve the treasure.</p><p>Back when the Formless Immortal Sect faced its destruction, the Immortal Pavilion remained undamaged. Even if he used the Sun God Tree, he wouldn't be able to destroy the Cloud Pond. Forcibly taking the treasure was clearly not feasible.</p><p>One wrong move, causing an unforeseen change in the Cloud Pond, would lead to even more trouble.</p><p>"The Qi of every treasure in the pond is connected to the Cloud Pond, forming a unified whole.  Touching one will affect all the others. To retrieve a treasure from the pond, one can only use ingenuity.  Human strength is limited; it's very difficult for one person.  If I call my clone or have a few more helpers, it will be much easier..."</p><p>The enemies of the Formless Immortal Sect back then might not have been his equal in the Dao of formations and restrictions. They likely collaborated to retrieve treasures, but they couldn't empty the Cloud Pond.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped fixating on the jade cage and looked down at the entire Cloud Pond, silently calculating.</p><p>Soon, a streak of light flew out from his dantian.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew outside, gently flapping its wings, circling the Cloud Pond. Qin Sang stood still, his eyes flashing with strange light as the Immortal Pavilion returned to silence.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft breath, pondered for a moment, and a fire lotus appeared on his forehead.</p><p>Next, the demonic fire within his Demonic Banner was also summoned by Qin Sang. Guided by the fire lotus, it formed a sea of fire above his head.</p><p>With a thought, the sea of fire divided into four, and flames converged towards the center of each fiery mass, gradually transforming into four fire figures.  The fire figures had no facial features or sentience, merely simple imitations, but each contained a trace of Qin Sang's Qi. He then sealed his own presence.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The four fire figures flew towards the four corners of the Cloud Pond.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the middle of a corridor, overseeing the entire situation.</p><p>Once again, the Immortal Pavilion fell into silence.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly watched the jade cage darting around in the Cloud Pond.</p><p>Finally, when the jade cage drifted close to the center of the Cloud Pond, Qin Sang's expression shifted, and he pressed a single hand towards the Cloud Pond, sending out a prepared hand seal.</p><p>Simultaneously, as if receiving a command, the four fire figures raised their arms, pointing towards the jade cage. Eight fire serpents, one after another, shot out from their bodies.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...*</p><p>The fire serpents shot into the Cloud Pond, immediately provoking a fierce counterattack.</p><p>The sound of thunder erupted, and cloud thunder burst forth from the four corners of the Cloud Pond. The fire serpents, unflinching, collided directly with the cloud thunder.</p><p>Amidst the booming sounds, the fire serpents were no match for the cloud thunder and were defeated.</p><p>However, the fire serpents moved in pairs. While the first fire serpent resisted the cloud thunder, the second fire serpent, close behind, seized the opportunity to slip through the cloud thunder blockade and touched the cloud mist within the Cloud Pond.</p><p>The cloud mist was not a tangible substance, but a manifestation of the Cloud Pond's restrictions.</p><p>The power of the demonic fire clashed with the Cloud Pond's restrictions.</p><p>Now was the most crucial moment. As the restrictions counterattacked, the treasures in the pond gradually became illusory, about to vanish like before.</p><p>He had to retrieve the jade cage before the treasures disappeared!</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly hovered in mid-air, capturing the scene within the Cloud Pond and relaying it to Qin Sang's mind. He had to divide his mind into four parts, manipulating the four fire figures to respond to the changes in each direction.</p><p>Qin Sang devoted all his effort to deducing the changes in the restrictions. Even with his cultivation, he felt immense pressure, his brow furrowed, holding his breath, not daring to be distracted.</p><p>The fire figures misled the Cloud Pond's restrictions.</p><p>Mistaking the fire figures for enemies, the Cloud Pond's restrictions unleashed furious cloud thunder towards the four corners. Unafraid of destruction, the fire figures not only didn't retreat, but also launched a fierce counterattack.</p><p>Within the Cloud Pond, the confrontation with the restrictions was also progressing.</p><p>Amidst the cloud mist, the four fire serpents divided into countless smaller ones, somehow connecting to form a hollow fire net, rapidly closing in.</p><p>This couldn't stop the treasures within the Cloud Pond from disappearing, but it could restrain the Cloud Pond's restrictions, slowing the disappearance of the jade cage.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang wasn't just dividing his mind four ways. He split off another part of his mind to lock onto the jade cage, racing against time to analyze the changes in the restrictions surrounding it!</p><p>At this moment, he finally made his move!</p><p>With a resonant sword cry, his spirit sword flew out once more!</p><p>Sword light, like a rainbow, pierced into the Cloud Pond.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's spirit returned to his Purple Mansion, his body flickering.  The surrounding light suddenly became unstable, and the Yin-Yang Armor was summoned from his Purple Mansion.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Yin-Yang Armor reverted to its essence of Yin-Yang Qi and then transformed into a giant Yin-Yang hand, following the path left by the sword light, grabbing towards the jade cage.</p><p>All obstacles were shattered by the Golden Sink Sword, which also caused the jade cage to rapidly fade away.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>The jade cage trembled. An inexplicable resistance emerged from within, preventing it from vanishing completely.  Delayed for a mere instant, it was caught by the giant Yin-Yang hand!</p><p>A look of joy appeared on Qin Sang's face.  The Yin-Yang Armor had indeed triggered a reaction from the treasure within the cage.</p><p>The Cloud Pond's restrictions furiously counterattacked, but it was too late.</p><p>The Yin-Yang hand immediately retreated.</p><p>The Golden Sink Sword and the demonic fire provided cover, stirring the Cloud Pond into chaos, successfully bringing back the jade cage!</p><p>Having obtained the treasure, Qin Sang immediately retreated to the lower level.  Only after the Cloud Pond's restrictions calmed down did he ascend to the Immortal Pavilion again.</p><p>Now, the jade cage was in his hand.</p><p>As expected, the jade cage's function was simple: to isolate and seal the fluctuations of the treasure within. The other broken swords and blades had lost their power, so they didn't require a jade cage.</p><p>After some examination, Qin Sang figured out how to open it.  His divine sense entered the jade cage, and with a *click*, the cage cracked open, a ball of grayish-white light rolling out.</p><p>Within the grayish-white light was a piece of unpolished jade!</p><p>The unpolished jade was elliptical, with a rough surface and spots, as if covered with a layer of unscraped stone skin, devoid of any smoothness.</p><p>From within the unpolished jade, layers of grayish-white rings of light constantly rippled outwards.</p><p>The rings expanded, gradually fading and disappearing.</p><p>Touched by the rings of light, Qin Sang felt no discomfort. He sensed a familiar fluctuation, the same source as the Yin-Yang Armor, definitely related.</p><p>He condensed Yin-Yang Qi again and activated the *Yin-Yang Heaven Battling Secret Art*. As he approached, the light from the unpolished jade brightened significantly, its fluctuations becoming more intense, but nothing more.</p><p>When he withdrew the Yin-Yang Qi, the unpolished jade returned to normal.</p><p>After several attempts, the result was the same.</p><p>Even when Qin Sang used the *Yin-Yang Heaven Battling Secret Art* to activate the unpolished jade, he couldn't trigger any new power.</p><p>"This... could it be because my realm in this cultivation method is too low?"</p><p>Knowing that the technique was incomplete, Qin Sang had abandoned it and hadn't tried to steal the insights of the Yin-Yang Daoist later.</p><p>"This object resonates with the Dao of Yin and Yang, but it has no other mystical properties. The Formless Immortal Sect placed it in the Cloud Pond; its origin is likely not simple, probably from the Immortal Palace."</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>A fragment of the technique ended up in the Cang Lang Sea, while a related treasure appeared in the Middle Continent.  The connection was likely due to the Immortal Palaces in both locations.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't know where the Cang Lang Sea was. Otherwise, he could visit and inquire; the Lan Dou Sect might be able to discern something.</p><p>Unable to understand it for the time being, Qin Sang stored the unpolished jade in his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>"Cang Lang Sea... Tian Tong and Tian Xiang should have ascended with the Zi Wei Palace. The Seven Kill Palace is no longer there, right?"</p><p>This thought suddenly crossed Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The ascension of the Zi Wei Palace actually concealed another path to ascension.</p><p>The ancient teleportation formation within the Immortal Palace possessed power beyond ordinary comprehension, possibly capable of breaking through the boundary walls.</p><p>If the Seven Kill Palace remained, one could use its ancient teleportation formation to reach the Zi Wei Palace and thus achieve the goal of leaving this world!</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt that this hope was slim, less feasible than the Ascension Platform and the East Sea's Return to Ruin.</p><p>With the ascension of the Tian Tong and Tian Xiang Palaces, this path was almost certainly nonexistent.</p><p>Shaking his head slightly, Qin Sang dismissed these distracting thoughts and stepped onto the jade stairs, ascending to the summit of the Lang Huan Jade Pavilion!</p><p>This place was even simpler than the lower level.</p><p>Four pillars supported the roof of the Jade Pavilion.  Besides these, there were no other furnishings.  A single meditation cushion rested on the smooth floor.</p><p>The cushion wasn't woven from any rare spiritual materials.</p><p>The only noteworthy feature was the dome of the Jade Pavilion.  The passage below resembled a starry sky, while here, a true starry sky was depicted, stars twinkling brightly.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, then walked towards the meditation cushion, examined it for a moment, and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The instant he sat down, the starlight on the dome brightened dramatically, converging into a beam of light that poured onto Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed no threat and remained seated.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly on his shoulder flew up, circling him, vigilant against anyone approaching the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt like he had fallen into a sea of stars.</p><p>In reality, a sliver of his consciousness had been pulled into an unknown space. Here, spheres of light drifted, some shining brightly, most dim.</p><p>The number of spheres wasn't that large, but they all revolved around his consciousness, creating an illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously approached one of the brighter spheres.</p><p>As soon as his consciousness touched it, a stream of information flowed into his mind.</p><p>*Nameless Pill Scripture Fragment*!</p><p>It was a fragment of an alchemy scripture.</p><p>The Water Phase Palace's inheritance had left his clone bewildered, but this fragment was truly a heavenly scripture. He could understand the ancient characters, but when combined, Qin Sang couldn't make sense of them.</p><p>Moreover, the content of the fragment wasn't continuous; even forcibly memorizing it would require considerable effort.</p><p>"The bright spheres contain fragments of various scriptures!"</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried but delighted. He had finally found the right place.</p><p>The Lang Huan Jade Pavilion was a treasure trove. The lower level held ancient treasures of unknown origin, while the upper level housed scriptures.</p><p>This was where the high-level cultivators of the Formless Immortal Sect comprehended the Dao. Although they were fragments, they all had profound origins. If one could comprehend even a small part, they would benefit for life.</p><p>"Is the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* here?"</p><p>Qin Sang rarely felt nervous, but he did now.  The Lang Huan Jade Pavilion might be his only hope. Whether he could obtain the technique would affect his future path of cultivation.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang withdrew his consciousness from the pill scripture and touched other spheres, tirelessly searching.</p><p>*Ling Xu Heaven Attraction Fragment*.</p><p>*Nameless Cultivation Method*.</p><p>*Spiritual Treasure Imprisoning Heaven Seal Refinement Method (Incomplete)*.</p><p>...</p><p>One sphere after another passed by.  He skimmed through them, finding mostly "Nameless" and "Fragments," confirming his guess.</p><p>In fact, not many of these incomplete scriptures were worthy of being placed within the Lang Huan Jade Pavilion.  Most of the spheres were empty.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned through most of them, but didn't find what he wanted.  His mind inevitably tightened.</p><p>He scanned another sphere.</p><p>"A fragmented divine ability, not a cultivation method!"</p><p>Disappointment flashed across Qin Sang's face as he scanned the name, skipping over the content. His consciousness touched the next sphere, and when he saw the name within, he subconsciously held his breath.</p><p>*Nameless Sword Nurturing Art*!</p><p>Sword Nurturing Art! *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He quickly probed into the sphere and saw the content within.  With just one glance, his tense mind relaxed.</p><p>It was the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*!</p><p>After years of painstaking searching, he finally had it in his grasp, and so easily. Qin Sang felt it was somewhat unreal. He only hoped it was the part for the Nascent Soul realm and beyond.</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang continued to browse the content of the technique.</p><p>He skimmed through it.</p><p>"Eleventh Layer! Good!"</p><p>"Twelfth Layer..."</p><p>"That's it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. He quickly examined the content carefully and realized he had overthought it.</p><p>The first ten layers of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, with the first layer serving as the foundation of the entire technique, started from the Foundation Establishment realm, each minor realm corresponding to a layer of the technique.</p><p>The technique was divided into two parts, each with five layers.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul realm, this pattern no longer applied. The eleventh layer corresponded to the entire Nascent Soul realm, and the twelfth layer astonishingly corresponded to the Soul Formation realm!</p><p>At the very least, this was a cultivation method leading directly to the Soul Formation Grand Path!</p><p>Back when the Formless Immortal Sect obtained the technique, it lacked the parts before the Nascent Soul realm, making comprehension extremely difficult. Moreover, the technique clearly defied conventions, nurturing the sword with the Primordial Spirit, and no one dared to attempt it.</p><p>But because these two parts involved such high realms, they were placed within the Lang Huan Jade Pavilion, specifically at the back, in the most important positions.</p><p>Having obtained the technique, Qin Sang didn't immediately try to comprehend it.  Moreover, his realm wasn't sufficient.  He continued to browse the other spheres, hoping to find higher levels of the *Yin-Yang Heaven Battling Secret Art*.</p><p>Unfortunately, until the very end, Qin Sang found another fragment leading to the Soul Formation realm, but not this particular technique.</p>
