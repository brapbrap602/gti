<h1>Chapter 342: The Rules</h1><p>Wanderer's voice dropped low, then quickly recovered its usual lightness, just as it had been in the Ancient Cultivator's tomb when discussing the Azure Lotus of Fire Aversion.</p><p>Qin Sang admired his composure.</p><p>“Did the Profound Mark Harmony Pill have no effect at all?”</p><p>When Wanderer asked, Qin Sang recounted the changes he experienced after taking the pill, leaving out no detail.</p><p>Then he looked at Wanderer expectantly, waiting for his analysis.</p><p>Wanderer fell into deep thought. After a long while, he finally said, “Brother Qin, one thing is certain: the Profound Mark Harmony Pill, as well as other foundation-repairing pills, are effective for you. If the pill wasn't suitable, it wouldn't have healed half of your injuries.  There's only one possibility: the quality of the Profound Mark Harmony Pill is insufficient!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, having already considered this. He quickly asked, “Senior, do you know of any elixirs of higher quality than the Profound Mark Harmony Pill?”</p><p>Wanderer thought for a moment, then shook his head.</p><p>“Difficult!</p><p>“The Great Elixir Sect has no shortage of pill formulas, and the Core Formation stage elders possess profound alchemy skills.</p><p>“But firstly, even the most skilled chefs can't cook without ingredients.  Without the necessary spiritual herbs, they are powerless.</p><p>“Secondly, the Profound Mark Harmony Pill's quality already surpasses that of the Harmony Pill and Five Mushroom Divine Paste. It's considered top-tier among such pills, especially since yours was refined using thousand-year-old Profound Mark Yellow Essence.</p><p>“Only rare heavenly treasures, or divine pills discovered within hidden tombs or secret realms, could surpass the Profound Mark Harmony Pill.</p><p>“Even if such treasures appear, they are priceless and impossible to purchase with spirit stones.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's disappointment, Wanderer changed his tone and offered comfort, “Brother Qin, don't lose heart. It's far from hopeless. There's always a way. At least the Profound Mark Harmony Pill is effective for you. Another method is to consume several more of these types of elixirs. Perhaps a quantitative change can lead to a qualitative one, healing your injuries.”</p><p>The method Wanderer suggested was also the only one Qin Sang could think of.</p><p>However, Harmony Pills were not easy to obtain. The first Profound Mark Harmony Pill only restored 50% of his injuries, and he didn't know how many more he would need.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath. He had anticipated this outcome before coming, so he quickly adjusted his mindset.</p><p>Wanderer's words were true; it was far from hopeless.</p><p>He would persevere and seek solutions high and low!</p><p>“Senior, have you heard any news about heavenly treasures like the Dao Scripture Grass or Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>One path was to gather elixirs.</p><p>The other was to search for heavenly treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to pursue both, hoping for a breakthrough on either.</p><p>“Heavenly treasures…”</p><p>Wanderer pondered for a moment, then instead of answering directly, he asked, “Brother Qin, you also attended the auction half a month ago. Did you see the Violet Citadel Key with your own eyes?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. “Senior, are you here for the Violet Citadel Key? Do you intend to buy it?”</p><p>He had been wondering why Wanderer had suddenly emerged from seclusion and traveled thousands of miles to Gloom Mountain Pass.</p><p>The mysterious Core Formation cultivator who possessed the Violet Citadel Key had asked for a magical treasure in exchange. Could Wanderer be planning to agree to this condition?</p><p>Wanderer gave a self-deprecating laugh and waved his hand.</p><p>“Brother Qin, you are unaware. This Violet Citadel Key is likely the first to appear publicly since the beginning of this spiritual tide. The news caused quite a stir.</p><p>“The number of Violet Citadel Keys is limited. Countless Core Formation cultivators will be drawn to the next auction, so the competition will be fierce.</p><p>“I hear the holder wants to exchange it for a magical treasure. Even if they don't get their wish, the price won't be low.</p><p>“I don't have the resources to participate in such a contest. I'm just here to observe.</p><p>“Of course, if the opportunity arises, I would like to acquire one.”</p><p>Qin Sang gave a soft exclamation. “I heard the Violet Citadel is incredibly dangerous, even for Core Formation cultivators. Foundation Establishment cultivators who enter face near-certain death. Are you planning to enter, Senior?”</p><p>Wanderer nodded.</p><p>“Didn't you just ask where to find heavenly treasures, Brother Qin?</p><p>“The most likely place to find them is the Violet Citadel!</p><p>“No other tomb or secret realm in the Ancient Battlefield can compare to it!</p><p>“Legend says the Violet Citadel was once a true immortal's abode. It fell from the heavens during the ancient immortal war and lies dormant in the deepest part of the Ancient Battlefield, only appearing during spiritual tides.</p><p>“It's said to contain countless treasures, and even secrets to breaking through to Nascent Soul and beyond!</p><p>“The path to Nascent Soul, tribulation-transcending treasures, immortal pills, and divine arts can only be found in the Violet Citadel.</p><p>“That's why, whenever it appears, not only do Core Formation cultivators flock to it, but even Nascent Soul ancestors rarely miss the opportunity.</p><p>“Over countless years, countless cultivators have explored only a small fraction of the Violet Citadel.</p><p>“Although I know a few possible methods and emerged from seclusion to prepare for my search for spiritual herbs, I'm not certain I can cure my soul injuries.  If I can't, even if it means facing near-certain death, I must take the risk.”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly shocked. He had guessed the Violet Citadel was extraordinary, unlike other secret realms, but he hadn't imagined it held tribulation-transcending treasures and Nascent Soul secrets.</p><p>No wonder it caused such a commotion.</p><p>“So, the Violet Citadel Key is the key to the Violet Citadel?  Senior, you must have this item; there's no other way to enter?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Wanderer shook his head.</p><p>“The Violet Citadel Key isn't exactly a key. It's more of a qualification, unrelated to the Citadel itself, but a long-established rule.</p><p>“The Violet Citadel is located in the heart of the Ancient Battlefield, rife with spatial rifts, and it appears when the spiritual tide is at its strongest.</p><p>“Originally, only Nascent Soul cultivators and their Core Formation disciples could enter.</p><p>“Later, some Nascent Soul cultivators worried that if they perished, their descendants wouldn't be able to reach Nascent Soul and enter the Violet Citadel. So, they established the rule of the Violet Citadel Key, and the situation changed.</p><p>“The Violet Citadel Key is a sliver of opportunity for sects and rogue cultivators without a Nascent Soul patriarch.</p><p>“It is said that a powerful immortal formation seals the Violet Citadel. A grand formation must be deployed to open it.  After the rule of the Violet Citadel Key was established, anyone holding one, regardless of cultivation level, could enter under the protection of the formation.</p><p>“Of course, very few dare to enter the Violet Citadel before reaching Core Formation.”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. “So that's how it is!  Does that mean... only one person can gain entry with a single Violet Citadel Key?”</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>Wanderer nodded. “Brother Qin, if you seek heavenly treasures and are willing to risk your life, try to find a Violet Citadel Key. Then, consult the records of major sects; they may contain information about the Violet Citadel, providing you with clues.”</p>
