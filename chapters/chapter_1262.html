<h1>Chapter 1254: Fishing</h1><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to make a move, a sinister crimson light suddenly erupted from the ground in the center of the stone chamber, followed by the appearance of a strange blood-colored vortex. The crimson light and the vortex vanished as quickly as they had appeared.</p><p>"This is a hidden prison!" Qin Sang realized.</p><p>He knew it was likely that Fatty Chicken's mother had sensed their arrival and was now attacking the prison's restraints. Sure enough, the crimson light flickered repeatedly, but the person inside still couldn't break free.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly activated his demon banner, setting up a formation, and then summoned demonic flames to test the defenses. Fatty Chicken, eager to save its mother, wanted to help, but Qin Sang stopped it.</p><p>The Thunder-Swallowing Falcon King had been trapped here for so long, which showed the power of the prison's restraints. Qin Sang needed to rely on his Heavenly Eye ability to slowly decipher the restraints and find their weaknesses. If all else failed, he would have to call for help from his senior sister.</p><p>Judging by the commotion, Fatty Chicken's mother was full of energy and in much better condition than expected, showing no signs of having been tortured.</p><p>Under the combined assault from inside and out, the vortex began to spin faster and faster.</p><p>Inside the hidden prison, Jing Yu, seeing this, redoubled her efforts to break free.</p><p>Fatty Chicken, unable to help and seeing how sturdy the restraints were, grew restless.</p><p>"Focus on sensing the Thunder Bead and try to communicate with your mother. She's been trapped here for years and should know the ins and outs of the prison's restraints," Qin Sang shouted at Fatty Chicken.</p><p>He was multitasking and couldn't hold out for long. He needed to communicate directly with Fatty Chicken's mother and work together to break the restraints!</p><p>Fatty Chicken immediately complied, spitting out a mouthful of vital blood without hesitation. The Thunder Bead absorbed the blood, its glow becoming even more dazzling.</p><p>At this moment, only a single restraint separated mother and child.</p><p>Jing Yu felt the Thunder Bead's fluctuations suddenly intensify and understood the intent. She quickly flapped her wings, gathering thunder into a massive ball of lightning in front of her. She merged her spirit into the thunderball, focusing all her energy on sensing the Thunder Bead.</p><p>"Child!"</p><p>A faint, almost imperceptible voice suddenly came from the Thunder Bead.</p><p>This gentle call, spanning two hundred years, struck straight at the heart.</p><p>The familiar voice left Fatty Chicken momentarily stunned.</p><p>"Mother!"</p><p>Fatty Chicken cried out, tears welling up in its eyes. Fortunately, its cultivation was strong enough to suppress its overwhelming emotions, and it quickly got to the point. "Mother, I'm here with Old... Senior Qin to save you! How much do you know about the prison's restraints?"</p><p>Don't call him 'Master,' call him 'Senior Qin'â€”that was Qin Sang's instruction.</p><p>Earlier, Fatty Chicken had vowed to recognize Qin Sang as its master if he saved its mother, but Qin Sang had never taken it seriously. What Qin Sang valued wasn't Fatty Chicken, but its mother's formidable strength.</p><p>Seeing her child recognize someone as its master, even if that person was their savior, would surely leave a bad impression. Qin Sang didn't want to provoke a mother's wrath.</p><p>Jing Yu also knew the importance of the situation.</p><p>Over the years, she had tried countless times and had a thorough understanding of the prison's restraints. The only problem was her lack of strength to break free. Now that someone had come to rescue her, with both internal and external attacks, there was great hope.</p><p>After hearing Jing Yu's description, the two quickly devised a strategy to break the restraints.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his sword formation and summoned the remaining demon banners, channeling demonic flames. He used part of the flames to block the black-armored men and directed the rest to fiercely bombard the prison's restraints.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The demonic flames continuously struck the blood-colored vortex, causing the stone chamber to tremble violently.</p><p>Inside the hidden prison, Jing Yu was also bathed in lightning, using all her strength to charge upward.</p><p>The attacks from both sides focused on the same spot, and the vortex spun faster and faster, gradually reaching its limit. The crimson light began to show signs of dispersing.</p><p>The two of them attacked relentlessly, with the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, always finding the weakest points in the restraints.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Finally, the vortex could no longer hold and disintegrated.</p><p>A bolt of lightning shot out, finally breaking free from the prison!</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief, recalling the demon banners and wielding the Ebony Sword again to clear out the black-armored men who had rushed in. Turning around, he saw the mother and child tightly embracing each other.</p><p>Watching this scene, a faint smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Reaching the late-stage of demon core cultivation with one's mother still alive and being able to call out "Mother" so freely was indeed a rare sight.</p><p>"Little Fatty, let Mother take a good look at you."</p><p>Jing Yu had already transformed back into her human form, cradling Fatty Chicken's head and examining it closely.</p><p>Fatty Chicken's eyes darted around, its face full of embarrassment.</p><p>The name "Little Fatty" had something to do with Qin Sang.</p><p>Back then, Fatty Chicken had just hatched when Qin Sang gave it a good beating. When Jing Yu returned after driving off the Wuji Sect Leader and his companion, Fatty Chicken wailed and cried to its mother about the injustice.</p><p>Jing Yu had been both fearful and angry at first.</p><p>But upon hearing Fatty Chicken complain that Qin Sang had insulted it by calling it "Fatty Chicken," she found the name oddly fitting and decided to call it "Little Fatty" from then on.</p><p>She had originally planned to give Fatty Chicken a proper name when it grew up, but fate had other plans, and they had been separated for two hundred years.</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist Qin, for saving us. Otherwise, who knows how long it would have taken for us to reunite. From now on, if Fellow Daoist Qin ever needs anything, Jing Yu will do her utmost to assist."</p><p>Jing Yu quickly composed herself from the joy of reunion and walked over to Qin Sang, bowing gracefully.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "Fate brought me together with your son, and he has helped me several times. There's no need for such formalities, Fairy Jing Yu. The Blood Lake is dangerous, and to bring him along, I had to use this treasure to help him avoid danger. This was a temporary measure. Once we return, I will release the restraints on him, so please don't worry."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang pointed to the Primordial Unity Ring on Fatty Chicken.</p><p>He knew that the restraints on Fatty Chicken wouldn't escape Jing Yu's notice, so he explained in advance to avoid misunderstandings.</p><p>Jing Yu glanced at Fatty Chicken, her worries dissipating, and quickly said, "Not at all! Not at all! It must be due to Fellow Daoist Qin's careful guidance that Little Fatty has achieved such cultivation."</p><p>Hearing the name "Little Fatty," Qin Sang couldn't help but chuckle and nodded. "I do see him as a junior! However, I haven't actually taught him much. His achievements today are the result of his own efforts. His determination to save his mother is truly commendable."</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang's expression turned serious. "I know you and your son have just reunited and want to catch up, but the situation outside is urgent. We still need your help, so let's leave the Black Tower first."</p><p>Jing Yu was reluctant to let Fatty Chicken go, holding onto it tightly as she followed Qin Sang out of the Black Tower.</p><p>Though she had been trapped for many years, she hadn't suffered much and hadn't lost much of her strength. Qin Sang had prepared healing pills for her, but it seemed they wouldn't be necessary.</p><p>Once they were out of the Black Tower and in a safe area, they got down to business.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained how they had entered and their purpose, then asked Jing Yu why she had ventured into the Blood Lake back then and what she had encountered.</p><p>Remembering the painful past, Jing Yu clenched her teeth, her expression filled with anger. "Back then, I was lured in with spirit herbs!"</p><p>"Lured?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Jing Yu nodded. "Fellow Daoist Qin, think about it. The Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld isn't a sentient divine tree, so why would it suddenly appear, and why would its shadow project into the Blood Lake? My experience back then was the same as those seniors who were drawn in by the Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld. The only difference is that they used mysterious methods to reverse-fish the Blood Mulberry from outside. I, however, was careless and ended up trapped here, realizing too late that it was a trap."</p>
