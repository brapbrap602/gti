<h1>Chapter 232 Magma River</h1><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword turned into a giant crimson sword, with a single slash breaking the Divine General’s ‘heart mirror’ and piercing through its abdomen.</p><p>Through the wound, one could see that there were no organs or blood flowing out, only a golden rune slowly rotating, mysterious and profound.</p><p>This rune had already been smashed into pieces by the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Divine General let out a roar, and the golden light from its body madly poured into the wound. With the replenishment of the golden light, the broken rune was quickly repaired.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t hesitate, immediately urging the Ebony Sword to reverse its sword Qi, piercing through the Divine General’s abdomen once more, causing a large part of the rune to shatter.</p><p>After several successive sword strikes, the rune was finally shattered by the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Divine General, who had been struggling and roaring, suddenly froze in place, not moving. Then the golden armor on its body began to dissolve, eventually turning into a golden light that flew back, transforming back into a portrait.</p><p>Qin Sang was fighting the other Divine General with a black longsword, while also dodging the arrows shot from the sides, making his fight very difficult.</p><p>Finally, after getting rid of one Divine General, there were no more Divine Generals coming down after the portrait was restored.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly let out a sigh of relief. It seemed that the rune in the Divine General’s body was its weakness. As long as the rune was shattered, the golden armor Divine General would turn back into a portrait and would not reappear, otherwise this trial would be too difficult, and most of the cultivators would not be able to pass.</p><p>As long as their weakness was known, it would be easy to deal with. Qin Sang did not let the Ebony Sword escape, with a thought, the Ebony Sword turned into a sword light and directly went to find the two Divine Generals that used longbows.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was extremely fast, easily trapping the two Divine Generals with its sword formation, which Qin Sang had deliberately reduced the range of this time, not triggering the prohibitions on the walls.</p><p>The sword formation erupted, and the Divine Generals were drowned in countless sword Qis, revealing their weaknesses. They were not in the abdomen, but in the chest.</p><p>It seemed that different Divine Generals had different runes and their locations would also change.</p><p>If one was unable to timely resolve the opponent, being besieged by a dozen or so Divine Generals and dazzled, one would not be able to find their weaknesses and only be defeated.</p><p>The Ebony Sword went and came, entangling the two Divine Generals, not giving them a chance to shoot arrows.</p><p>Qin Sang multitasked, taking advantage of this opportunity to swing the black longsword more urgently in his hand, the sword light as the rain, thoroughly suppressing the Divine General in front of him. Seeing an opening, he thrust his sword into its abdomen.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted coldly, not stingy with urging the Qi Sea. In an instant, a group of formidable sword Qi burst in the Divine General’s abdomen, immediately shattering the rune.</p><p>Then, without waiting to look back, Qin Sang immediately activated his body technique, rushing to support the Ebony Sword.</p><p>With Qin Sang joining, the battle became more apparent.</p><p>These two Divine Generals used longbows and were not good at close combat, trying to pull away, but how could Qin Sang give them this opportunity?</p><p>The Machine Sword Formation expanded to its limits without touching the prohibition. Every time a Divine General disappeared, it could immediately catch their position. The enigmatic movement did not have any effect in front of Qin Sang, and soon all of them were killed.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Ebony Sword, the sword Qi receded, revealing the 本体 of the Ebony Sword. The slender sword body circled around Qin Sang’s fingertips, crystal clear like a jade.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang looked at the front of the passage again and saw the golden light wriggling, with two Divine Generals who used swords just coming down from the wall. They coldly glanced up, staring at Qin Sang, and then their figures became illusory and appeared above Qin Sang’s head in the next moment.</p><p>The long saber broke through the air, and the sword intent came upon him!</p><p>The timing was just right!</p><p>By grasping this rhythm and without using the Corpse, he should also be able to cope with the first level of the trial.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly wondered how many levels there were in total in this trial. Once the Corpse was damaged, it would not be easy to repair it. It might as well be left until later when he encountered a crisis. Now it was time to work harder.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Qin Sang flicked his finger and the Ebony Sword found one of the Divine Generals, while he twisted his body and personally swung his sword towards the other.</p><p>Qin Sang found that the strength of these two golden armored Divine Generals was similar to the ones before, but two were much easier to deal with than four.</p><p>Spear, halberd, axe, battle axe, hammer, mirror, pagoda…</p><p>Qin Sang had seen all kinds of weapons, both common and uncommon, in the passage.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that there were no corpses after the Divine Generals died, Qin Sang now could describe it as one step, one blood. As he walked forward, the distance between the portraits became closer and closer, and the intervals of the Divine Generals became shorter and shorter, and the battle became more intense.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang had no time to think about anything else. Often, before the Divine General in front of him was killed, there was already a new Divine General joining the battle, giving him great pressure.</p><p>But up to now, Qin Sang did not summon the Killing Corpse to help, but only faced the killings in the passageway on his own, making progress step by step!</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind was completely engrossed in the killing talisman.</p><p>The pressure of the God General was oppressive, and the situation was critical, but in this case, not only could he stimulate his potential and comprehend the speed of the killing talisman, but more importantly, the danger was less, so he could do it without worry; therefore, he did not want to miss this opportunity.</p><p>The passageway was deep, and the end was out of sight, and there was no time, only the endless killings and roars.</p><p>Qin Sang held a sword in his hand, and the sword formation moved with him, like a killing god; wherever he passed, there were only the unwilling roars of the God General; however, he was not moved, with only endless killing intent in his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang was awakened by a burst of heat, and his mind was released from the killing talisman.</p><p>He was surprised to find that his attainment in his cultivation method had deepened by a level; the harvest of this battle could make up for the previous dozens of battles, and he was not far away from completely comprehending the second killing talisman.</p><p>How could it be so hot?</p><p>Qin Sang put away the joy on his face, looked up, and found that there was actually a red light breaking through the gold light; without realizing it, he had reached the end of the passageway.</p><p>Is it firelight?</p><p>Was there a sea of fire ahead?</p><p>Qin Sang moved his nostrils and suddenly smelled a strong, pungent smell, and at the same time, he heard a roar, and even the passageway was shaking like an earthquake; there seemed to be a big river flowing there.</p><p>Lava!</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed slightly; at the end of the passageway, there was likely a lava river; listening to the movement outside, he estimated that this river was not small.</p><p>Was the latter part of the trial to be completed on the lava river?</p><p>The Foundation Establishment cultivator could use his spiritual power for protection and was not afraid of high temperatures, but he could not swim in the lava river; once he fell into the lava, if he could not escape in time, he would die.</p><p>However, he could not see the specific content of the trial here; if it was really on the lava river, he had to be careful.</p><p>After a moment of thinking, Qin Sang stopped thinking and looked at the portrait in the passageway; there were only six portraits ahead of him; at this time, the gold light on the portraits fluctuated wildly; these six gods seemed to be coming down together.</p><p>It seemed that this was the final test of the first trial.</p><p>With some thought, Qin Sang no longer hesitated and rubbed his palm on his waist; three killing corpses flew out of his Corpse Puppet Bag, and the cold evil spirits from the killing corpses instantly dissipated the heat coming at him; after a pause, they rushed towards the God General.</p>
