<h1>Chapter 732: Swift and Decisive Action</h1><p>Cui Ji loudly conceded defeat, alarming those outside the hall, who burst in.</p><p>As fellow members of the Eastern Trade Alliance, with Cui Ji admitting defeat in front of everyone, Qin Sang couldn't press the matter further and withdrew his magical treasure and the Nightfiend.</p><p>Although the Trade Alliance was an alliance in name, its members were bound together by interests and were much looser than a sect, but there were still rules within the alliance.</p><p>Openly killing the steward of the Nine Star Guild without a blood feud would invite questioning from the entire Trade Alliance.</p><p>"Take your people and get out of Five Elements Island immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, showing no mercy.</p><p>Cui Ji's face changed, the feeling of sword energy against his body leaving a deep impression.</p><p>Under the gazes of the crowd, Cui Ji, humiliated and enraged, shouted at the Nine Star Guild members, "What are you waiting for? Go back, pack your things, and leave!"</p><p>"Hold on."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. "Fellow Daoists, coming and going in such a hurry with so many goods is inconvenient in the Demonic Sea, not to mention the risk of attracting thieves. As fellow members of the Trade Alliance, it is our responsibility to help alleviate your worries. We can take inventory of your goods and deliver them to the Nine Star Guild. Fellow Daoists can travel light."</p><p>"You... this is too much!"</p><p>Cui Ji's face flushed red, his lips trembling.</p><p>This demonic cultivator spoke nicely, but once the fat meat entered his belly, how could he possibly spit it out?</p><p>Sending a pile of junk to the Nine Star Guild later would be utterly disgusting.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored Cui Ji and turned to the others. "Those present are stewards of various trading companies, well-versed in the prices of various treasures. Let's take inventory together and serve as witnesses. What do you think, fellow Daoists?"</p><p>Everyone's eyes shifted back and forth between Qin Sang and Cui Ji.</p><p>The hall was in chaos. The fight ended quickly, leaving few traces, only the deep pits created by Zixia. They hadn't figured out how Qin Sang had defeated Cui Ji and forced him to concede.</p><p>They had initially thought that a formidable opponent who could rival Cui Ji had finally arrived. With two tigers fighting, they would surely need to rally various factions, and then their lives would be much easier.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the battle was decisive, and Cui Ji had no power to fight back.</p><p>They drove away a jackal only to welcome a tiger.</p><p>This was the outcome they least wanted to see.</p><p>Some were scheming, wanting to mediate for Cui Ji, but they dared not speak in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>From the moment he entered, Qin Sang had controlled the situation, giving no time for others to form alliances, forcing them to make a choice now.</p><p>Speaking for the Nine Star Guild now meant being the next one expelled. If this person was even more ruthless, they might not even have the chance to leave the island.</p><p>Moreover, listening to his tone, it seemed he was willing to share the benefits with everyone, unlike the domineering Cui Ji.</p><p>Knowing the situation was stronger than them, they naturally knew what to choose. They all echoed Qin Sang, some even swearing oaths.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng is right. The journey is long, and carrying so many goods in haste without the trading company arranging for reception will indeed attract thieves..."</p><p>"Daoist Cui, rest assured, we guarantee that every item of the Nine Star Guild will be accounted for..."</p><p>...</p><p>Cui Ji was so angry he nearly vomited blood, his face ashen.</p><p>But when he saw Qin Sang's hand on his right-hand man's head, and the icy gaze shooting from under his cloak, seemingly devoid of emotion, Cui Ji's heart suddenly chilled.</p><p>He had no doubt that if he dared to utter a word of refusal, Qin Sang would immediately kill him.</p><p>Those fence-sitters had all switched sides, the situation was beyond redemption.</p><p>Moreover, Cui Ji had been trying to communicate with the Purple Gloom Pearl, only to find that his natal magical treasure's spirit was greatly damaged and couldn't recover in a short time.</p><p>He hadn't even seen clearly what that red light was.</p><p>This method of defiling magical treasures was too strange and malicious; Cui Ji had never seen anything like it.</p><p>"Fine! Fine!"</p><p>Cui Ji gritted his teeth and swallowed his anger, ordering his men to carry his right-hand man away without looking back.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang and the other trading company stewards left, everyone seemingly amicable and enjoying their conversation.</p><p>But as soon as they turned around, they cursed Qin Sang as a shameless demonic cultivator, no different from Cui Ji, then excitedly followed the Wang sisters to ransack the Nine Star Guild's assets.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't intend to change the structure Cui Ji left behind. After swallowing the Nine Star Guild, he would be in charge of Five Elements Island. He couldn't let the fat meat by his mouth go uneaten.</p><p>Of course, he was slightly better than Cui Ji. He wouldn't push the other trading companies so hard, proactively distributing some of the benefits to appease everyone.</p><p>Leaving the Wang sisters to inventory the Nine Star Guild's assets, Qin Sang walked alone towards the shop.</p><p>At this point, he had already put the Nine Star Guild behind him, taking out the nautical chart and starting to choose a suitable cultivation location near Five Elements Island.</p><p>The reason he could swiftly and decisively resolve the Nine Star Guild's trouble and drive away Cui Ji was ultimately his own strength and confidence.</p><p>He wouldn't let the trading company become a burden.</p><p>Having the Wang sisters was enough.</p><p>The area around Five Elements Island was densely populated with demonic beasts, often roaming in packs. Moreover, there weren't as many Nascent Soul demonic beasts as in the Thousand Demons Sea. Qin Sang didn't find a suitable location on the chart and could only search slowly after leaving the island.</p><p>Entering the shop, he found the old man had returned at some point. He closed the door and walked to Qin Sang's side, whispering, "Daoist, I just sent someone to monitor the Nine Star Guild's movements. They split into three groups. Cui Ji and his right-hand man mysteriously disappeared. I don't know which group they're in."</p><p>"He's quite cautious."</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, then thought for a moment. "Forget it, tell our people to be careful in the future. As long as they don't rashly leave Five Elements Island, the Nine Star Guild probably won't dare to cause trouble on the island. Remember to send a message to Old Zou, reporting everything that happened today... From now on, Daoist Wang will be in charge of the trading company's affairs, and you will assist her. Unless there's a life-or-death crisis, don't disturb me..."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The old man became even more respectful towards Qin Sang.</p><p>He was very excited. With the Qiongyu Trading Company replacing the Nine Star Guild, his status would also rise.</p><p>After giving his instructions, Qin Sang returned to the cave dwelling arranged by the trading company to cultivate.</p><p>He stayed on Five Elements Island for several months, intentionally befriending the island's powerful figures, helping the Wang sisters stabilize the situation and establish the Qiongyu Trading Company before quietly leaving the island.</p><p>With the help of the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings, Qin Sang searched everywhere and finally found a suitable island. After contacting the Wang sisters, he established a cave dwelling there.</p><p>On Five Elements Island, there were others' awe and subordinates' service, but here, opening his eyes meant facing the vast Demonic Sea, fraught with danger. His cave dwelling was just a cave carved out with his sword.</p><p>But compared to the scheming and maneuvering on Five Elements Island, Qin Sang preferred the feeling of freedom out here.</p><p>He summoned the Celestial Eye Butterfly and found that the lightning cocoon hadn't been broken, but was getting thicker. He didn't know how much longer it would take for the butterfly to awaken.</p>
