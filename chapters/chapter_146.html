<h1>**Chapter 139: Gifting the Pill**</h1><p>**Chapter 139: Gifting the Pill**</p><p>Jiuyue Kingdom, the imperial capital.</p><p>On either side of Tianxing Road, the divide between the rich and the poor was as clear as day. The west side was frequented by high-ranking officials, nobles, and wealthy merchants. The residences were elaborate and opulent, with towering walls, vermilion gates, and glazed tiles.</p><p>The farther one went in, the more prosperous it became. Near the imperial palace, there were even mansions spanning dozens of acres, belonging to royal family members and high-ranking nobles.</p><p>In contrast, the residence of the retired Minister of Revenue was modest, with only three courtyards. After the minister retired, the residence was sold to a mysterious family who hung a signboard that read, "Song Residence."</p><p>This family was quite enigmatic, keeping to themselves and rarely venturing out. They even had very few servants, who would occasionally purchase necessities outside the residence.</p><p>However, no one dared to provoke them, as anyone who could afford to live in such a prestigious area was not to be trifled with.</p><p>Qin Sang never imagined that Song Ying would be unmoved by material wealth. The residence she had chosen was the same one he had hastily found for her back then, with only some simple repairs done. The gold and silver he had left for her was a staggering amount, enough to ensure generations of prosperity for her family.</p><p>Perhaps her horizons had broadened after witnessing the wonders of the immortal world at the Wenyue Market.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the Song Residence and knocked on the door.</p><p>"Creak." The door was pulled open from within, and a young servant cautiously peered out. Seeing Qin Sang and not recognizing him, he asked, "May I ask who you're looking for, sir?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and said, "I'm a friend of your master's, the surname Qin. Please inform your master that an old friend from the mountains has come to visit."</p><p>The servant eyed Qin Sang suspiciously. "Please wait a moment."</p><p>Soon, hurried footsteps could be heard from within, and Song Ying rushed out. Her face lit up with surprise when she saw Qin Sang, and she quickly opened the front door.</p><p>"Servant greets Qin... sir."</p><p>Qin Sang sized up Song Ying and noticed that she looked much better than when he had first met her at the Wenyue Market. She was plump and graceful, and it was evident that she had given birth.</p><p>They chatted as they walked towards the guest hall, but just then, a series of baby talk could be heard from the inner courtyard. A little boy of about two or three years old, dressed only in a bib, toddled out, followed by a frantic nanny.</p><p>"Mother! Mother!"</p><p>The little boy ran into Song Ying's arms, his baby voice sweet, and he looked curiously at the unfamiliar Qin Sang.</p><p>The nanny looked horrified. "Please forgive me, mistress. The young master..."</p><p>Song Ying shook her head, indicating that the servants should all withdraw. She held the little boy close, her eyes filled with anticipation as she said to Qin Sang, "Qin sir, this is my child. His father and I have named him Song Chengxian. Chengxian, quickly greet the gentleman."</p><p>The more Song Ying urged, the tighter the little boy closed his lips.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled unperturbed, knowing what Song Ying was hoping for. He had come this time to fulfill his promise.</p><p>In Mount Shaohua, whenever new disciples were recruited, Foundation Establishment disciples were each given a recommendation slot, and they could recommend one person to enter the sect, but the person had to meet the sect's requirements.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose for this visit was to assess Song Ying's descendant's aptitude. If his aptitude was good, then Qin Sang would use his recommendation slot. After all, without the Song family's Sword Intent Edict, he would not be where he was today, not to mention that he had a previous agreement with Song Ying.</p><p>Under Song Ying's expectant gaze, Qin Sang stepped forward and placed his finger on the little boy's arm.</p><p>After examining him carefully, Qin Sang looked up at Song Ying, had her summon the nanny to take the child away, and said in a serious tone, "Quadruple spiritual roots: metal, wood, water, earth."</p><p>Song Ying's expression was a mixture of joy and disappointment.</p><p>Having overheard conversations at the Wenyue Market, she understood what having quadruple spiritual roots meant. Even if he were to cultivate, he was unlikely to achieve much. Without the Sword Intent Edict, Mount Shaohua would never accept a disciple with such aptitude.</p><p>"Immortal Qin..."</p><p>Song Ying hesitated to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, knowing that Song Ying was hoping he would take her son as a disciple. However, he was now in precarious circumstances and did not have the energy to guide a disciple.</p><p>Nonetheless, since he had made an agreement before, Qin Sang contemplated for a moment and retrieved a jade bottle, Gu Yuan's short sword, and the Waterheart Bamboo Cushion from his interspatial bag and handed them to Song Ying. "While I cannot guide him in Mount Shaohua, I will not go back on my word. Once Song Chengxian comes of age, you can</p><p>"Foundation Establishment Pill!"</p><p>Song Ying's beautiful eyes widened, and she exclaimed, staring at the jade bottle in her hand with great shock. She suddenly remembered that she had heard her parents and brother talking about the Foundation Establishment Pill before, and it looked just like this.</p><p>Her parents and brother had been full of envy at the time.</p><p>Growing up with cultivators, Song Ying of course knew how precious the Foundation Establishment Pill was. The powerful families in Wenyue Market couldn't even find a single Foundation Establishment Pill for their descendants.</p><p>If news of a Foundation Establishment Pill spread, the entire market would go crazy.</p><p>The value of the Foundation Establishment Pill was definitely not less than the Sword Intent Edict.</p><p>Song Ying held the jade bottle tightly in both hands and said excitedly, "Thank you, Master Qin, for giving me this pill. Song Ying is eternally grateful. I will have Chengxian come kowtow to you right now."</p><p>"I'll see you again if fate allows."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand and disappeared on the spot.</p><p>After resolving his karma with the Song family, Qin Sang rode the Flying Shuttle straight to the depths of the Yuncang Great Marsh. He released the Beaked Spirit Bird and the Golden-pupil Snake and searched the Yuncang Great Marsh for ten days. He did find two Spirit Veins, but there was not even a single good Spirit Eye that could serve as a cave府, let alone a Spirit Spring.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to release the two spirit beasts and let them return to Mount Shaohua on their own. Then he flew towards the Ancient Abyss Country.</p><p>After arranging everything in Huilong Temple, Qin Sang flew back to the deserted island and swept the area with his Divine Sense. There were no signs of cultivators breaking into the cave府, so he opened the array and walked inside.</p><p>He removed the array left by the Bamboo Demon and set up the Black Tortoise Shell Formation flags. Qin Sang walked to the pool in the cave府 and took out the jade box containing the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid.</p><p>When Zhao Yan had pulled the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid up by its roots, the spirit herb's roots had been pure white. Now they had a slight yellow tint, and its leaves and petals were also slightly curled.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and took the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid out of the jade box and put its roots into the Spirit Spring. Then he felt a sudden weight on his palm, and the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid sank into the water on its own.</p><p>The Spirit Spring was only a thin layer, so the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid could only spread its roots out to cover a large area of the pool.</p><p>The leaves of the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid unfolded immediately, and its petals regained some of their luster. Qin Sang set up a restriction to prevent the medicinal properties from leaking out. He squatted by the pool and looked at it over and over again, a smile of anticipation crossing his face.</p>
