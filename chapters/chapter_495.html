<h1>Chapter 488: Slaying the Jiao, Capturing its Soul</h1><p>Boundless Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the valley alone, revisiting familiar grounds.  Boundless Valley was vast and expansive; the area where cultivators were active was a mere fraction of its totality. Qin Sang, having cultivated here for over twenty years, knew this place like the back of his hand.</p><p>Possessing powerful talismans and artifacts, he could venture into perilous areas others dared not, reaping considerable rewards.</p><p>However, he used nearly all his gains to acquire spirit materials for refining tools and enhancing his crafting skills. He even exhausted his reserves of Cold Gold, pushing his refining abilities to the limit.</p><p>Successfully entering the second level of Boundless Valley, he crossed the White Stone Plains, a barren landscape unfolding before his eyes.</p><p>Here lay a stone sea formed of gray rocks, densely packed, increasing in size towards the center. The innermost boulders were monumental, some as massive as mountains.</p><p>At the edge of the stone sea, several groups of demons could be seen, yet deeper within, not a single demonic beast was in sight.  The innermost area seemed forbidden; these demons dared not cross the line.</p><p>Such places were numerous in Boundless Valley, almost all containing the lairs of powerful demons. The territory of this Black Jiao wasn't particularly large, given it was only at the peak of the Spirit Severing realm.</p><p>Concealing his presence and aura, Qin Sang flew silently through the stone sea, finally ascending a towering boulder, overlooking the scene below.</p><p>Two massive rocks stood nearly merged, with a narrow crevice between them. The base of this crevice hid a dark abyss, where the Black Jiao dwelled.</p><p>The abyss held no surging demonic aura, no strange lights or dense mist, appearing remarkably ordinary.</p><p>"It can't have broken through to the Demon Core realm already, could it?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the abyss, muttering to himself. He opened his Corpse Puppet Bag, and in an instant, a dark shadow appeared silently beside him: the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>Its speed was so great, the eye couldn't capture its appearance; it was utterly uncanny.</p><p>Now fully merged with the Corpse Core within its belly, the Flying Night Devil's power was at its peak. The Black Jiao would be a perfect test of its strength.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang whispered the command. The Flying Night Devil bowed its head, its black eyes gleaming with a profound gaze, as if sentient, appearing exceedingly strange. Then, it vanished abruptly.</p><p>Qin Sang remained above, sitting cross-legged, retrieving the Ten Yama Banners and quietly setting up the grand formation. He also took out his other artifacts.</p><p>Of course, the most important was the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>The secret talisman appeared in Qin Sang's palm, the dragon souls within conveying their eagerness to please. Qin Sang gripped the talisman, gazing down at the abyss, waiting for developments.</p><p>The abyss was pitch black, filled with ancient restrictions.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil descended swiftly.  Qin Sang's knowledge of the restrictions here was inferior to the Black Jiao's. Inevitably, the Flying Night Devil triggered some hidden ancient restrictions, quickly revealing its presence.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A furious roar echoed from the depths of the abyss.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The icy water of the abyss churned violently. A massive dark shadow emerged from the depths, its long, serpentine form stretching dozens of feet, even with only part of it visible above the surface.</p><p>The Black Jiao's upper body rose erect, its triangular head held high, scarlet tongue flicking. Its vertical pupils radiated killing intent, appearing chillingly sinister in the dark abyss.</p><p>Unlike Jiao beasts Qin Sang had encountered before, a lump protruded from this Black Jiao's forehead, revealing the tip of a growing horn.</p><p>Its dark scales were dense, harder than iron, shimmering with a unique luster, appearing remarkably smooth. As the Black Jiao rose from the water, the icy liquid cascaded down its body.</p><p>Its warning had no effect; the intruder remained undeterred, approaching ever faster.</p><p>Fury ignited in the Black Jiao's eyes.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>A massive wave surged through the abyss. A long, powerful tail suddenly shot out from the depths, whipping up a black whirlwind, emitting a pungent, fishy stench.</p><p>The whirlwind was intensely cold, causing a thick layer of ice to form on the surface of the abyss at a visible rate.</p><p>The splashing water instantly transformed into ice shards, shimmering with a blue glow, incredibly sharp.</p><p>Demonic wind and Profound Ice intertwined within the swirling vortex. With a mighty flick of its tail, the Black Jiao unleashed the attack towards the intruder at astonishing speed.</p><p>As the Flying Night Devil seemed about to be engulfed by the overwhelming onslaught, Qin Sang, seated on the boulder above, revealed a faint smile.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil watched the approaching whirlwind coldly, a glint in its eyes. It suddenly threw a punch.</p><p>Against the enormous whirlwind, the Flying Night Devil appeared minuscule.</p><p>Yet, this single punch carried world-shaking power.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The terrifying force of the punch tore a hole straight through the whirlwind.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil passed through unscathed.</p><p>This astonishing sight caused the Black Jiao's eyes to bulge, the ferocious glint replaced by sheer terror.</p><p>That terrifying fist enlarged rapidly in the Black Jiao's vision. It only had time to turn its head slightly.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The Black Jiao took the punch head-on. Its massive body flew like a rag doll, crashing heavily against the wall of the abyss.</p><p>The Black Jiao's cry of pain was cut short by the Flying Night Devil, which had reappeared behind it. Its demonic claws effortlessly pierced the Jiao's scales, tearing off a large chunk of flesh.</p><p>The Black Jiao howled in agony, fleeing desperately.</p><p>However, the Black Jiao was, after all, a powerful demon at the peak of the Spirit Severing realm.  Despite its battered appearance, it was not completely defenseless. Chaos erupted within the abyss, as the shadowy figures of the Devil and Jiao clashed wildly.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calmly seated outside the abyss, listening to the occasional cries echoing from within. His mind linked with the Flying Night Devil, he monitored the evolving situation.</p><p>His goal wasn't to have the Flying Night Devil kill the Black Jiao. Instead, he wanted it to force the Jiao out, blocking its other escape routes, and driving it to flee upwards.</p><p>The Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman required a living soul to be extracted.</p><p>The chaos within the abyss intensified, and Qin Sang felt the boulder beneath him tremble violently.</p><p>Suddenly, a surge of potent demonic aura erupted. Qin Sang's expression shifted, his gaze fixed on the abyss.  Moments later, he saw a shadowy Jiao figure stumble out of the abyss.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil pursued relentlessly.</p><p>The Black Jiao was now a wretched sight, devoid of its former majesty. Its body was covered in grievous wounds, each bone-deep and bleeding profusely.  One of its eyes had been clawed out by the Flying Night Devil, leaving a long gash across its head.</p><p>After this fierce battle, the Black Jiao had no desire to fight, only to escape.</p><p>Seeing the Black Jiao emerge, Qin Sang waved his hand. The Ten Yama Banners, prepared beforehand, unfurled instantly.  The ghostly banners formed a grand formation, sealing the abyss's exit, blocking the Black Jiao's path.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>Endless ghostfire surged forth, enveloping the Jiao, forming a pincer attack with the Flying Night Devil.</p><p>The Black Jiao was trapped, with no escape!</p>
