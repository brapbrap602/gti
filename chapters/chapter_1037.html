<h1>Chapter 1029: Earth Spirit Stone Apes</h1><p>The leaders of the Western幽 Alliance and Northern辰 Alliance departed with their troops.</p><p>Soon, the remaining members were dispatched under their orders.</p><p>These individuals dispersed, stealthily heading in various directions.</p><p>Finally, only the two alliance leaders remained.</p><p>The Northern辰 Alliance leader turned back to look at the mountain where the Eastern Pole Alliance leader was located, and said indifferently: "After years of planning, it's finally time to cast the net! Unexpectedly, this last altar is hidden so deep, sealed by the Four Saints within the Foundation Establishment Stage trial grounds. We only confirmed its location after understanding the entire formation's structure. Fortunately, the trial grounds were pieced together by the Four Saints using the Immortal Restrictions and the original secret realm of the inner hall. It's not a completely integrated formation, so there are bound to be flaws. This place can be left to Fellow Daoist Baili. The other two altars are also perilous, we should move as well."</p><p>The Western幽 Alliance leader nodded, his figure disappearing into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>The Northern辰 Alliance leader watched the Western幽 Alliance leader depart, pondered for a moment, and flew off in another direction.</p><p>……</p><p>Trial Grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the final trial.</p><p>The moment he was teleported, Qin Sang felt a void beneath him, realizing he was in mid-air, as if falling from the sky. He quickly activated his movement technique to stabilize himself.</p><p>'Hiss!'</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly gasped.</p><p>Just a hundred zhang ahead of him, there was a long, narrow silver flash in the void – a spatial rift!</p><p>"A spatial rift, such a dangerous thing, within the trial grounds of Foundation Establishment cultivators! I wonder how this secret realm was created."</p><p>Qin Sang stayed where he was, not daring to move rashly.</p><p>He looked into the distance and found more than one spatial rift floating in the void. However, they weren't numerous. While they appeared dangerous, as long as he was cautious, he wouldn't easily bump into them.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang awakened the Skyeye Butterfly, confirming there were no invisible or moving spatial rifts nearby, the most dangerous kind.</p><p>Compared to the depths of the storm belt, this place was relatively safe.</p><p>However, this didn't mean there weren't any elsewhere. Qin Sang kept the Skyeye Butterfly outside to maintain vigilance, then looked around and flew to a nearby mountain peak.</p><p>Neither Ming Wei nor any other cultivators were in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that everyone's landing point was different. He and Ming Wei were likely among the first to enter, so it was normal not to encounter others.</p><p>They still had plenty of time, as long as they met up before the Soul Cleansing Liquid appeared.</p><p>"First, I need to determine my location…"</p><p>Qin Sang learned that the entire trial grounds were divided into four regions, each with its own unique landscape. The Treasure Pavilion was located at the center of these four regions.</p><p>The treasures within the Treasure Pavilion were limited; only the fastest to arrive could obtain them.</p><p>"Is that a lake?"</p><p>Qin Sang strained his eyes, looking past several mountain ranges, vaguely seeing shimmering waves. It seemed quite vast.</p><p>His heart stirred, and he was about to fly over to take a look.</p><p>Just then, the mountain beneath his feet suddenly shook violently. The ground undulated like a swamp, churning fiercely.</p><p>With a few 'bangs', clumps of yellowish 'stone balls' leaped out from the ground, each several zhang in diameter.</p><p>It was as if mountain peaks had suddenly appeared around Qin Sang, casting him in shadow.</p><p>'Crack… crack… crack…'</p><p>These stone balls began to crack as they flew through the air.</p><p>Dust billowed.</p><p>Amidst the dust and smoke, the stone balls transformed, turning into giant ape-like creatures. Their bodies were pitted and jagged, composed entirely of angular stones.</p><p>Yet they possessed limbs, with postures and appearances resembling apes, moving freely.</p><p>On each stone ape's head, two hole-like eyes flashed with a凶 light, fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>'Screech…'</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The stone apes beat their chests, emitting sharp, ear-piercing cries, filled with unmistakable hostility.</p><p>"Stone apes!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. He knew where he was.</p><p>These stone apes were earth spirits born from rock, unique to the Wu Earth Region of the trial grounds. They were known as the guardians of the trial grounds, and the other three regions had similar creatures.</p><p>These stone apes possessed immense strength and incredibly sharp senses.</p><p>They dwelled underground, blending seamlessly with the rocks, making them difficult to detect. Cultivators participating in the trial could easily stumble into their territory and be besieged.</p><p>Clearly, Qin Sang had now stepped into the stone apes' territory, provoking them.</p><p>Enraged by the intruder, the stone apes shrieked.</p><p>Simultaneously, the lush forest below the mountain began to ripple, accompanied by rustling sounds and a chorus of roars.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang had a bad feeling.</p><p>These stone apes could actually command the surrounding beasts to hunt together. The beasts wouldn't recognize the demonic aura on him. Once a beast tide formed, even Qin Sang would have to expend considerable effort to escape.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Sword light flashed, slashing fiercely at a stone ape in front.</p><p>Thunder rumbled, the sword light like lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang attacked with full force. The stone ape had no time to react. Just as it raised its fists to strike, the Ebony Sword sliced across its chest.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Ebony Sword left a deep gash on the stone ape.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised that he hadn't cleaved it in two with a single strike, a testament to the stone spirits' formidable defense.</p><p>He then changed his hand seals, and the Ebony Sword flickered, splitting into a dozen beams of sword light that simultaneously targeted the stone ape's joints and other vulnerable areas.</p><p>The stone ape froze, its body instantly shattering into pieces of stone that fell to the ground.</p><p>An astonishing scene unfolded. The dismembered stone ape didn't die. As its body fell, it dissolved into the ground. Soon, the ground bulged again, a new stone ape taking form within Qin Sang's sight, slowly rising to its feet.</p><p>These stone apes were essentially immortal.</p><p>"Indeed, they are tough opponents, and this one isn't even the strongest among the stone apes. However, although they can regenerate, it takes time. That interval is my chance to escape."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, discerning the stone apes' characteristics.</p><p>At this point, the other stone apes, enraged by the death of their companion, launched a furious attack, their heavy fists swinging. The forest below was in chaos, filled with the incessant roars of beasts, echoing the cries of the stone apes.  Their numbers were unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer, pointing a finger at the Ebony Sword.</p><p>A ring of sword light erupted amidst the stone apes.</p><p>The stone apes stumbled. Qin Sang simultaneously manifested phoenix wings and a flood dragon's shadow, seizing an opening to charge out of the encirclement, easily leaving the stone apes behind.</p><p>Qin Sang's escape technique was unmatched by these beasts, as swift as the wind.</p><p>The stone apes couldn't keep up, beating their chests and roaring at the sky. Some beasts from the surrounding forest charged forward to intercept, but they were either slain by Qin Sang or left in his dust.</p>
