<h1>Chapter 750: Purple Star Eagles</h1><p>Xiang Yi nodded. "The Daoist's observation is astute. This Bone Lotus does possess detoxification properties, but under the relentless assault of such potent venom, it's inevitably affected. Once all the petals are tainted, this treasure will wither and be beyond recovery. However, fellow Daoists, there's no need for concern. The Bone Lotus can endure long enough for us to complete our mission. It seems the Purple River Crocodile's cries haven't roused the beasts within the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone. We shouldn't delay any longer. Let's move..."</p><p>Within the dense purple mist, visibility was severely limited. Even their divine sense was corroded by the poisonous fog, preventing them from extending it to scout the area.</p><p>Engulfed by such an environment, everyone felt a strong sense of unease.  No one spoke, and they pressed forward in silence.</p><p>The sheer size of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone was surprising. After walking for a long time, the poisonous fog showed no sign of dissipating. In fact, its color deepened compared to when they first entered.</p><p>This indicated that Xiang Yi was leading them deeper into the heart of the forbidden zone.</p><p>The jungle grew increasingly sparse, and the soil beneath their feet turned purple, creating a dreamlike scene. Yet, Qin Sang and the others felt no sense of ease.</p><p>Before long, they noticed something amiss. Xiang Yi's path seemed erratic, leading them in several circles.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiang, are you lost?"</p><p>Everyone stared at Xiang Yi suspiciously.</p><p>Xiang Yi signaled them to be silent, glancing left and right and listening intently. Then, a look of delight spread across his face. He pointed forward, "Found them! Quickly! Don't let them escape!"</p><p>At this moment, the others also faintly heard sounds, seemingly the cries of beasts, and quite a few of them at that.</p><p>Throughout their journey, they had been avoiding the monsters within, but now Xiang Yi was actively seeking them out.</p><p>"These are small beasts called Purple Weasels. They are the Purple Star Eagles' favorite food..."</p><p>Xiang Yi quickened his pace, swiftly explaining, "In the direction we're heading, there's a Purple Star Eagle nest, occupied by a large flock. These eagles are incredibly powerful. Even if we join forces, we'd pay a heavy price to break through. The Purple Weasels, however, are much easier to deal with.  We'll hunt them and use their carcasses to lure the eagles away, allowing us to pass through effortlessly."</p><p>"The Merchant Alliance's preparations are indeed thorough."</p><p>The Liu couple expressed their admiration.</p><p>Everyone's confidence grew, eager to complete the mission quickly and attend to their own affairs.</p><p>Following the sounds, they pursued swiftly. Soon, they noticed the purple mist churning ahead and vaguely saw a group of raccoon-sized beasts leaping and running on the ground.</p><p>These beasts resembled yellow weasels in appearance and size, but their fur was entirely purple, even their pupils a deep violet.</p><p>The Purple Weasels were highly alert. Before the group got close, they sensed the disturbance and ceased their playful antics.</p><p>Standing on their hind legs, they stared with their purple eyes in the direction of the approaching group, throats emitting strange cries, their eyes filled with uncontainable frenzy.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>Xiang Yi barked, flicking his finger. A streak of light shot out, transforming into a spiritual net, falling upon the weasels.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were not to be outdone.</p><p>They coordinated seamlessly, deploying their magical treasures to seal off all escape routes, preventing the Purple Weasels from fleeing.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang commanded his Ebony Sword, cleaving through the purple mist. The sword's radiance surged several feet, becoming an insurmountable obstacle for the Purple Weasels.</p><p>After entering the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone, Qin Sang had attempted to release his Flying Night Devil, but he discovered that while its physical body was robust, it was still susceptible to the purple mist's corrosive effects, rapidly depleting its corpse energy.</p><p>It wouldn't be useful here.</p><p>*Thud! Thud! Thud!...*</p><p>Under attack, the Purple Weasels went into a frenzy.</p><p>Deep purple smoke billowed from their bodies, momentarily obscuring everything. Their figures vanished within the smoke.</p><p>This smoke not only contained the potent venom of the forbidden zone, but also carried the Purple Weasels' innate magical power. Prolonged exposure would severely damage the spiritual essence of magical treasures.</p><p>Similar to the Bloodfiend Divine Light, but far less potent.</p><p>When Xiang Yi had warned them earlier, Cui Ji immediately recalled his experience twenty years prior, subconsciously glancing at Qin Sang several times.</p><p>Prepared for this, the smoke had little effect. The Purple Weasels were quickly forced out by the descending spiritual net, squealing in panic and scurrying in all directions.</p><p>Like this, they posed no threat to Qin Sang and the others, and were quickly slain.</p><p>The group moved forward to collect the Purple Weasel carcasses.</p><p>There were quite a few of them. Qin Sang openly gathered some, and seeing this, the others followed suit. Xiang Yi didn't stop them.</p><p>Carrying the Purple Weasel carcasses, Xiang Yi led them back on course, heading straight towards the depths of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>The jungle transformed even further. The ancient trees here grew exceptionally tall, mutated, their branches covered in thorns that shimmered with purple light, clearly poisonous.</p><p>Moreover, the branches swayed without a breeze, as if hunting, nearly becoming tree spirits.</p><p>After traveling a certain distance at high speed, they were forced to stop.</p><p>"Why is there a cliff blocking our path? Have we reached the end of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone?" someone asked, frowning.</p><p>Their path was obstructed by a cliff. There was a restrictive formation in the air, and the threat from the thorny branches of the canopy above was too great.</p><p>Xiang Yi calmly replied, "We're still far from the end. This is only considered the outer periphery of the forbidden zone. Seeing the cliff means we're approaching the passage I mentioned earlier. Go right."</p><p>Shortly after, the group stopped in front of a canyon, holding their breath.</p><p>They looked up.</p><p>Gale-force winds howled above the canyon. They could only vaguely discern shadows circling in the sky, flapping their wings and stirring the sea of mist, accompanied by occasional sharp cries.</p><p>They hadn't clearly seen the Purple Star Eagles, but the number of shadows was enough to make their scalps tingle.</p><p>"Under normal circumstances, the Purple Star Eagles don't stray far from their nest. As long as we dash through the canyon, we won't have to worry about them."</p><p>As Xiang Yi spoke, he retreated a distance to an open area.</p><p>He tossed the Purple Weasel carcasses onto the ground, casting several restrictive spells, then led everyone to hide at the base of the cliff. He shouted, "Detonate!"</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The Purple Weasel carcasses, still seemingly fresh, exploded. Flesh and blood splattered everywhere, the pungent scent drifting towards the canyon.</p><p>The Purple Star Eagles, catching the scent of the Purple Weasels, instantly went into a frenzy. A large swarm of dark shadows stirred the purple mist, scrambling to fly out of the canyon and towards the explosion site.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Xiang Yi waved his hand sharply, and the group seized the opportunity to slip into the canyon.</p><p>Most of the Purple Star Eagles were lured away by the scent, but they were still spotted by the eagles remaining in the canyon. With enraged screeches, these eagles attacked them relentlessly.</p><p>Meanwhile, the eagles fighting over the food outside received the signal and were returning.</p><p>Trapped in the canyon, the consequences would be dire.</p><p>Everyone deployed their magical treasures, enduring the Purple Star Eagles' attacks while continuing to advance.</p><p>As they charged out of the canyon, the flock of eagles had caught up.  Just as Xiang Yi had predicted, they pursued for a short distance before giving up and returning to their nest.</p>
