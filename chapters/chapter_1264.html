<h1>Chapter 1256:  A Cleansing Ritual</h1><p>The ancient cultivator was utterly defenseless; he couldn't be allowed to fall into the hands of the Abyssal Cult.</p><p>Unlocking the ancient secrets might depend on this person!</p><p>If the ancient cultivator was as terrifying as the Demon Lord, then Ye Lao Mo couldn't be allowed to break the seal.</p><p>No matter what, they had to go and see.</p><p>Jing Yu saw Qin Sang deep in thought, about to retrieve the Lei Nianzhu. She whispered a few words in Fat Chicken’s ear.</p><p>Following his mother's instructions, Fat Chicken hid within the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan.  This place was far too dangerous for him; the residual energy alone could crush him to dust.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Jing Yu.</p><p>Jing Yu sighed softly, then said gravely,  "Regardless of what you do, I must return and find a way to obtain the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper."</p><p>"Ancient cultivators are enigmatic and unpredictable, and the Abyssal Cult is powerful.  It's unwise for you to go alone,"</p><p>Qin Sang tried to dissuade Jing Yu.</p><p>He didn't want Jing Yu to go to her death; it would be pointless to have saved her otherwise.</p><p>Jing Yu's expression fell, and she glanced at the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan on Qin Sang's wrist.</p><p>Before speaking, she had set up an invisible barrier to prevent Fat Chicken from hearing.</p><p>"After entering the dungeon, though my life wasn't in danger, my injuries were too severe. I lacked medicinal herbs and spent most of my energy healing. Moreover, this place is unsuitable for cultivation, so I've been virtually stagnant for the past two hundred years.</p><p>"Furthermore, all my protective treasures were destroyed by the flesh puppets.</p><p>"Soon after leaving, I will face a Heavenly Tribulation. If I cannot obtain the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper, attempting to breakthrough will be a fatal gamble, a sure death!"</p><p>Jing Yu spoke with bitterness.  She had barely been reunited with her child, and now she had to risk her life again.</p><p>Failure in the tribulation meant eternal separation.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. He had only recently formed his Nascent Soul and had not truly experienced the pressure of a Heavenly Tribulation, but he understood Jing Yu’s plight.</p><p>Under Heaven's way, all are but ants, all struggling to cross.</p><p>After a slight hesitation, Jing Yu continued, "Qin Daoyou, your human race can also refine the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper. Simply place it at the core of a top-tier spirit vein and use the vein and secret techniques to nurture it for ten years, washing away the blood poison.  The remaining medicinal power is extremely pure and can be directly refined into the body.  It’s an incredibly rare elixir, capable of directly improving Nascent Soul cultivation!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, falling silent as he considered the truth of Jing Yu’s words.</p><p>Could she be deceiving him, manipulating him into helping her acquire the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper?</p><p>The Qingluan blood essence was sealed within the Phoenix Wing; the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper was useless to him, only useful for trade.  No matter how precious the treasure, if it wasn't useful to him, Qin Sang needed to carefully weigh whether the risk was worthwhile.</p><p>Jing Yu, intelligent as she was, saw Qin Sang's hesitation.  She quickly said, "Qin Daoyou, I have just been rescued by you, how could I be so ungrateful as to deceive you? This is the secret technique for cleansing the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper; please take a look. My clan has passed it down through generations, knowing about this spiritual item. We only knew that the blood-poison-free Corpse Flower Blood Jasper could enhance cultivation, but we were unsure if it would aid in breakthroughs. The cost is that the spirit vein's spiritual energy will be affected by the blood poison, but it will recover fully in a few years…"</p><p>Qin Sang caught the silver light Jing Yu flicked towards him. A cultivation technique appeared in his mind; it was indeed profound and extraordinary, and Jing Yu couldn’t have faked it.</p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p>After achieving Nascent Soul, every hurdle must be overcome alone.</p><p>Even if the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper couldn’t help him break through bottlenecks, it would save years of arduous cultivation, making it worthwhile.  The Yuan Shen Gate could be used to borrow the spirit vein.</p><p>Besides, even without the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper, he needed to go to the center of the array.</p><p>"The Corpse Flower Blood Jasper is most effective in its first use, when it shocks the blood's energy, but after the blood poison is removed, the quantity doesn't matter for refinement. There were at least five at that time, and there might be more. I only need two…"</p><p>One for himself, one for Little Fat.</p><p>Jing Yu knew she was alone and weak, hoping to persuade Qin Sang to help.</p><p>Earlier, Little Fat had repeatedly praised this Qin senior, claiming he dominated the Bei Chen region, his strength unparalleled, the strongest in the world.</p><p>She felt it was exaggerated, but it did show that this man was extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate for long before agreeing.</p><p>Jing Yu was overjoyed, her eyes lingering on the Tong Xin Huan.  "Qin Daoyou, if something happens, or if I fail the tribulation, I entrust Little Fat to you."</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Jing Yu.  "He has the means to protect himself, and having integrated the Qingluan lightning power, his future is boundless and he needs no one's care.  Good fortune comes to those who deserve it.  Don't be too pessimistic; it may affect your tribulation."</p><p>"Thank you for the advice. I was overthinking it."</p><p>Jingyu took a deep breath, regaining his composure. He accepted a vial of restorative pills from Qin Sang, quickly regaining his full strength.</p><p>While leaving the Black Tower and during their exchange, Qin Sang had summoned a sword talisman. After activating it, she sensed the Demon Lord Tongyou's location.</p><p>They were now heading to meet Tongyou. Jingyu knew how to find the center of the great array.</p><p>Dealing with the ancient cultivators and the Abyss of Sin required everyone's combined efforts.  Then he and Jingyu could seize the chance to steal the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, using her magic treasure to clear a path, while Jingyu followed, silently refining the pills.</p><p>The scene within the array shifted several times.</p><p>Jingyu said, "They're wandering around in the array. It seems they haven't cracked its pattern yet. I've recovered nine-tenths of my strength. Let's hurry and join them. I've heard of the infamous Ye Lao, this person is no ordinary foe; delay might be dangerous."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The two used their escape techniques—one flying on a sword, the other manipulating lightning—to speed towards their destination.</p><p>Guided by the sword talisman, they drew closer.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Qin Sang and Jingyu arrived at a wide-open area. They saw a fierce battle raging before them, amidst a storm of blood-red lightning and dazzling light.</p><p>On closer inspection, they found Tongyou and his companions were besieging several flesh and blood puppets.</p><p>Everyone except Qin Sang was present.</p><p>The flesh and blood puppets roared in fury. Though covered in wounds, they fought with fierce tenacity, their injuries miraculously healing at a visible rate.  Their blood axes possessed the power to cleave mountains and seas; each swing unleashed a beam of blood-light, forcing everyone to dodge.</p><p>"Who's there?!"</p><p>"What person?!"</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang and Jingyu approached, several shouts rang out from ahead. Two figures, Qing Jun and the Demon Lord Tongyou, arrived on their escape techniques.</p><p>Both sides landed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun exchanged a brief glance and a slight nod.</p><p>Qing Jun looked at Jingyu beside him, surprised to see him unharmed.</p><p>"Daoist Jingyu?"</p><p>Tongyou, surprisingly, recognized Jingyu, his face filled with astonishment.</p><p>"Greetings, Daoist Tongyou, greetings, Daoist Leng…"</p><p>Jingyu greeted them both formally; they returned his greetings.</p><p>"Daoist Jingyu, you've been missing for many years. I thought…"</p><p>The Demon Lord Tongyou held considerable sway over the Xiaohan region's demonic cultivators. He had dealings with the demon king who lived in seclusion in Wuyagu Valley, but they generally kept to themselves.</p><p>After fusing with the Azure Bird's lightning power, the Fat Chicken's appearance had changed.</p><p>Tongyou glanced at Qin Sang, remembering Qin Sang's frequent release of the demonic bird during their journey, and the peculiar behavior.  He suddenly understood, "Daoist Jingyu has been in seclusion at Blood Lake?"</p>
