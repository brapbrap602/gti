     After dozens of layers of buffs were cast on Ames, her fury was
              finally dampened. She snorted and deactivated her Esper ability.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Heber did not mind it; it was not the first time he had confronted
              Ames. He turned and nodded at Zoel.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “So, I shall leave. I look forward to the result of your
              consideration.” Zoel got the gesture, gave his contact details to
              Ames, smiled, and was about to turn around and walk out of the
              room.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Looking at the envoy’s retreating back, Han Xiao was suddenly
              hesitant.
     <em class="calibre7">
      Should I plant a mark on Zoel? It seems quite rewarding.

    <div class="chapter-c">

    <p class="calibre5">
     He did not forget that this was a private meeting before the party
              officially started. When the party started the next day, only then
              would Heber introduce Zoel to all the guests. That would be the
              time that things started to escalate.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     The Crimson Empire would not snatch the territory themselves
              because once they did, the Federation of Light would act, and the
              conflict would grow into a much bigger issue. Since this was not
              yet the stage to have such a large-scale conflict, the Crimson
              Empire was trying to bond with the Shattered Star Ring’s
              organizations, drawing more chess pieces to their side of the
              universe chessboard.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Throwing an Observer’s Mark would allow him to see what the
              Crimson Empire was doing backstage and how many organizations
              joined the Crimson Empire. This was very precious intelligence.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     However, although Observer’s Mark left close to zero trails and
              even Ames could not notice it, there were two more Beyond Grade As
              present, so there was a chance that he might get noticed. Plus,
              the Crimson Empire’s people might have special techniques to
              prevent things like that.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     <em class="calibre7">
      Hmm, I’ll give it a try. Even if I get noticed, it’s not too
                serious a problem. He wants us to be on his side, and we’re not
                enemies.
     </em>
    </p>
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
    <p class="calibre5">
     A tiny tint of gray light flashed through his eyes, and an
              Observer’s Mark was planted on Zoel.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Ames and Heber did not notice at all.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Neither did Zoel. He left the room, and the gate covered his
              figure.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     This time, Han Xiao suddenly realized that someone was looking at
              him. He turned around and saw that Austin was staring right at
              him.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     <em class="calibre7">
      He noticed?
     </em>
     Han Xiao’s heart skipped a
              beat.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Everyone’s abilities were different. Ames and Heber could not
              notice, but Austin was a Mage, so he was sensitive to all kinds of
              energy. Despite the ripples of Void Energy being miniscule, they
              did not escape his senses.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     However, Austin did not say anything. He just gave Han Xiao a
              friendly smile and looked elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Han Xiao did not get what he meant. Anyway, not being exposed was
              a good thing.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “If there’s nothing else, I’m leaving.” Ames was annoyed by the
              sight of Heber and did not want to stay there.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Wait.” This time, Heber spoke.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “What else?” Ames frowned.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “I heard you’ve been expanding your forces recently. We can work
              together,” Heber slowly said.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Work together?” Ames gave a faint smile. “Do you think we have a
              very good relationship?”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “I can forget about that nonsense when you fought your way onto
              Planet Heber,” Heber said.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Then keep remembering.” Ames could not be bothered to argue. She
              stood up from the throne, turned away, and left.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Han Xiao took along Hila and Aurora and followed her out of the
              room.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Austin laughed loudly. “Hahaha, Heber, she just dislikes you more
              and more.”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Doesn’t matter.” Heber was not bothered.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “I thought you were going to make the marriage proposal again.”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Forget it, she probably won’t agree this time too.” Heber shook
              his head.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Seriously, you both have very tough personalities. If you want to
              get her, you have to tone it down,” Austin said jokingly. His
              personality was very casual, and he had a good relationship with
              both of them. He knew the history of Heber chasing Ames.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “I won’t change for any woman.” Heber waved his hands.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     He was not too determined about Ames. In the entire Shattered Star
              Ring, Heber thought only Ames who was Beyond Grade A like him
              could match him, only she was strong enough to be his partner. It
              had no element of love or emotion.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     If he could get Ames, his organization would have two Beyond Grade
              As, which would be a tremendous increase.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Heber disdained deception and did not bother wasting time; he had
              always been straight forward and did not avoid speaking of his
              real goal of chasing Ames.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Austin still remembered back then when Heber first proposed to
              Ames and how furious Ames had been. He wanted to laugh every time
              he thought of it.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     …
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     When Han Xiao and the others reached the gate of the palace,
              Carroll just happened to be on the way in, and they met.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “You people again.”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Carroll did not have any intention of taunting this time and did
              not glue his eyes to Ames, unlike last time. His expression was
              calm as if Han Xiao and the others were just passersby.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Ames glanced at him. Although she was unhappy, she could not do
              anything in Tyrant’s territory, so she ignored Carroll.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Just as they were about to pass each other by, Han Xiao suddenly
              pressed onto Carroll’s shoulder and grabbed him tightly like an
              iron claw.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Puzzled, Carroll turned around and asked, “What are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “I remember that you said before I’m just your replacement?” Han
              Xiao squinted. “Since you call yourself my senior, give me some
              guidance then.”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Carroll’s expression changed. He had thought that the previous
              taunting incident was over, but Han Xiao’s sudden action after a
              few days was unexpected to him.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Ames stopped, also surprised.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “What do you mean? Do you want to fight here? This is Planet
              Heber!” Carroll said in a slightly threatening manner.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Don’t worry, I just want to spar with you. I want to see how
              strong the traitor is.” Han Xiao chuckled. “The Tyrant’s
              subordinate wouldn’t not dare accept a challenge, right?”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “I got it. This is Ames’ orders, isn’t it?” Carroll felt that he
              had guessed correctly. It had to be because Ames was unhappy about
              the outcome of what had happened earlier, so she had ordered Black
              Star to challenge him. If it was just a spar between officers,
              Heber would not say anything.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     <em class="calibre7">
      Hehe, is she this confident in this new officer of hers?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Carroll’s face turned cold and said, “Okay, I accept your
              challenge. Hope you don’t lose too fast.”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Bloodshed Land was his stage; he could use countless machines.
              Even if Black Star’s name had been loud recently, he did not step
              back.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Carroll had heard about Ames’ new officer. He also wanted to gauge
              Han Xiao’s full strength. He wanted to see what kind of person
              Ames had found to replace him.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Furthermore, his position was sensitive. He now represented the
              Tyrant. Since Ames had ordered Black Star to challenge him, he
              could not back down. Even though Heber could protect him,
              considering the Tyrant’s personality, things would not go well for
              him if he was afraid of the challenge.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Bloodshed Land despised cowards the most. Someone that was not a
              battle maniac had no chance of obtaining a high position under the
              Tyrant.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Han Xiao curled his lips and suddenly said, “We’re both Mechanics,
              just sparring isn’t fun. How about a bet?”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “On what?”
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Let’s bet… five sets of machinery blueprints, what do you say?
              The loser has to give whatever blueprint the winner requests.” Han
              Xiao smiled wickedly.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Betting blueprints… Carroll frowned heavily. Blueprints were the
              lifeline of a Mechanic, so Mechanics betting blueprints on was not
              uncommon.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     “Okay.” Carroll nodded.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     There were many factors that had made him suddenly challenge
              Carroll.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Ames could not battle, but he could. Being high profile to a
              certain extent and showcasing his abilities was beneficial to
              increasing his position in this circle. Plus, it could help Ames
              relieve some anger.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     If the Tyrant interfered in a spar between officers, it would be
              utterly embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     Secondly, he had been peeking on Carroll for the past few days and
              roughly knew his strength. Knowing the enemy guaranteed him an
              edge in the battle. Furthermore, he had noticed that Carroll had a
              few rather good machines, so he had proposed a bet to win some
              machinery blueprints.
    </p>
    <div class="chapter-c">
    </div>
    <p class="calibre5">
     He would never fight a battle without benefits.
    </p>
    <p class="calibre5">
     The third and the most important reason was that a new faction
              mission had appeared on his interface.
