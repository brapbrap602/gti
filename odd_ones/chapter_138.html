      Stardragon’s missile-carrying vehicles fired mercilessly at the
                Germinal troops. The missiles approached with high-pitched
                screeches, adding to the heavy atmosphere
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ugar did not panic; he commanded the troops to close up the gaps
                in their formation, with the vehicles carrying multi-barreled
                machine guns at the front, forming an assault formation. This
                reduced the area of target, and the machine guns destroyed all
                the missiles in the area in midair, forming a vacuum, allowing
                the troops to smoothly sail through the explosion waves.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Huang Qiuming paused.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had just received news that the battle at Tedramira River was
                at a heated stage; the strategic team had primarily marked out a
                few locations where Germinal teams could have gathered. The
                strategic team advised him to change from the original plan to
                use Plan B. Huang Qiuming made some rearrangements and
                instructed the interception ring to leave a gap.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At the same time, Rainy Kim and the others made it to the front
                line. Large number of soldiers gathered with proper attire and
                equipment, armored vehicles had their engines running, and elite
                soldiers were standing by.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “How are we going to join in the fight?” Sleepy Winter asked
                helplessly.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Rainy Kim frowned and thought for a while before nodding. “I
                don’t know.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Then why are you nodding‽
      </em>
      Sleepy
                Winter wanted to bang his head against the floor.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Twinkle Fried Rice suddenly pointed to the battlefield and
                shouted, “Someone is coming! Oh sh*t! It looks like a high-level
                player!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The other two turned to look in the same direction. They watched
                as a buff man led a team of well-armed soldiers on heavy-armored
                motorbikes to separate from the main troop. They sped toward the
                Stardragon base while smoothly dodging all the bullets.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Mihawks dodged a series of attacks on his heavy-armored bike,
                but he inadvertently triggered a mine, and his bike was blown
                apart. He began to run, at a speed almost as fast as the
                motorbikes, through the bullets. His task was to deliver the
                bomb that he was carrying to the Stardragon base.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Superhumans usually fought in assault teams on the battlefields.
                Mihawks could see that the enemies had sent their elite teams
                toward them.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He concentrated expressionlessly and adjusted his inner energy
                to save up for later.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Suddenly, Mihawks instinctively felt that there was imminent
                danger, he reacted extremely quickly, pushed hard with his legs,
                and was going to change direction.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      But he was not fast enough.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      A bullet with blue light trailing behind it hit Mihawks’ neck
                from the side and caused a huge splatter of blood. He was
                critically injured. He groaned and spat out mouthfuls of blood.
                There was absolutely no cover on the fields; his only choice was
                to keep running forward, but his wound caused him to slow down
                significantly.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      A combat fighter, who could fight through gunfire, had been
                critically injured by one shot!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Huang Qiuming was shocked.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “That was not us. Who’s the sniper‽”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He remembered the suspicious target that had been detected at
                the start and felt that this shot seems really familiar. He
                pondered for two seconds, and his eyes widened.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Only a monster sniper could critically damage a superhuman—the
                Black Phantom that only recently had become involved in
                underground activities.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Bullet with blue light, it must be him!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       What is he doing here? Why help us?
      </em>
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Commander, what do we do now?” the vice-captain asked.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Huang Qiuming considered and made up his mind decisively “He
                doesn’t look like enemy. Don’t care about him; focus on fighting
                Germinal.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Usually, snipers’ skills would be of very limited use in this
                kind of battle, but when super snipers like Black Phantom came
                into the picture, it would be a completely different story.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Stardragon did not know why Black Phantom was helping them,
                but needless to say, this helped them greatly!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ugar was furious.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “One shot to critically injure Mihawks, that must be that damned
                Black Phantom! Not long ago, he got Freire’s team too. This
                monster must have joined the fight at Stardragon’s request!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ugar felt immense pressure when he thought of Black Phantom’s
                kill statistics that had been circulating on the Dark Web. He
                had been crowned a ‘Superhuman killer’—way too dangerous. Even
                though Ugar was stronger than Mihawks, he did not want to have a
                taste of Black Phantom’s strength.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Mistaking Han Xiao for someone on Stardragon’s side, Ugar
                angrily commanded, “Team 3, locate and terminate the sniper.
                Take the test subjects with you; you must at least divert his
                attention away from us!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      One armored vehicle left the main troop and sped toward Han
                Xiao’s location.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">

       Wow, this guy is quite tanky.
      </em>
      Han Xiao
                was surprised. This shot’s theoretical damage was 1,600. Taking
                combat fighters’ body attributes into consideration, it would be
                about 1,300. This had knocked out Bai Jin, who was Level 48, in one
                hit, but Mihawks was still up and running. Combat fighters are
                indeed very tanky.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This time [Flaming Will] was not too good; it only buffed his
                attack by 148%. His Ghost sniper rifle had been maxed out in all
                its attributes after the strengthening. None of the Experience earned
                had gone to waste. Han Xiao either saved the Experience or used it to
                level up skills, talents, and equipment, which were the key to
                having strong firepower!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After his first shot, Han Xiao activated a new task.

      Han Xiao was satisfied that he could earn Experience by being a
                busybody.

     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao fired single shots at Mihawks, who could not escape the
                fate of being swallowed by the explosions and shots. His death

      <em class="calibre7">
       Combat fighting makes use of energy. Everyone wants to be a

     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The snipers had greatly weakened the assault team, which had
                been caught by the counter troops from Stardragon. The assault
                plan had barely started and was already failing terribly under
                Han Xiao’s intervention.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this moment, he noticed that a troop had veered off from the
                Germinal main troop and was moving toward him. He changed his
                target and started firing using the Red Falcon sniper gun.
                Because Stardragon was also present, Han Xiao intentionally
                avoided using the high-explosive bullets.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      A sniper rifle could only deal limited damage to armored cars,
                so Han Xiao activated the portable battery that had been set up
                beforehand.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Three hundred meters in front of the Germinal troop, four
                portable batteries transformed into small multi-barreled machine
                guns. They fired rapidly, and some of the armored vehicles
                exploded on the spot. The remaining soldiers had to spread out
                and launch counterattacks on the portable batteries.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Once the team spread out, the portable battery was a lot less
                effective because it had to rotate and aim instead of aiming at
                one spot.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The portable batteries did not have defensive mechanisms, even
                if Han Xiao used platinum as the surface material, and two out
                of four were blown to bits very quickly. Overall, the result was
                good. More than half of the vehicles were destroyed, and the
                enemies were significantly weakened.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this moment, the troops did something that Han Xiao did not
                expect. The opened the rear of one of the armored vehicles.
                Three humanoids jumped out of the car and ran toward the
                portable batteries at a speed faster than car. They looked
                really strange, and Frenzied Sword was taken aback.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “What in the world are those things?” Frenzied Sword wanted to
                use detection on them but was informed that he was too far away.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The three humanoids were well-built and expressionless. There
                were large amounts of metallic joints and structures inside the
                arms, legs, and spinal regions. The metal was fixed into the
                bones at joints, such as in their knees and elbows. As they were
                running, the metallic joints would have blood seeping out. There
                was no doubt that every movement would inflict great pain, but
                the trio seemed emotionless as if they could not feel any pain.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Moreover, there was a layer of thin armor growing from the skin
                of the humanoids.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao recognized the humanoids the second he saw them.
