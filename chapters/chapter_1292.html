<h1>Chapter 1284: Slain in Battle</h1><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The female cultivators materialized, but before they could react, they were engulfed in a sea of fire.</p><p>The demonic flames seared their bodies, causing excruciating pain and screams.  They struggled desperately, but the flames’ power was overwhelming.  Their breathing grew ragged, and their situation desperate. Within moments, they fled into their folding fan, their cries echoing.</p><p>The demonic fire then slammed into the magical artifact!</p><p>The folding fan, a peculiar magical treasure, was inherently weak against defense.  The demonic fire struck, its light dimming instantly as it let out a mournful wail. It suffered significant damage and was sent flying.</p><p>The artifact was linked to Yue Sanren's spirit. The consecutive blows struck him as if he'd been struck by lightning. He felt a sweetness in his throat, spat blood, and his face turned ashen.</p><p>He was no match for the demonic fire!</p><p>Terror etched itself across Yue Sanren's face, and he frantically attempted to escape.</p><p>But unexpectedly, the demonic fire swirled back and was retrieved by Qin Sang.  Immediately, a blinding light burst from the flames, moving with incredible speed, instantly piercing towards him—the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang had made this considerable sacrifice to completely eliminate this person. If his Nascent Soul escaped, it would have all been for naught.</p><p>Annihilating a Nascent Soul required the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>Yue Sanren had no time to repair his folding fan.  Terrified, he hastily patted his storage pouch, sending a beam of green light hurtling out – a formless mass of red cloud.</p><p>This was Yue Sanren's usual defensive treasure, the Crimson Cloud Barrier.</p><p>The Crimson Cloud Barrier rapidly expanded, forming a cloud curtain behind him.</p><p>Yue Sanren didn't even look back, focused solely on escaping.  This was the greatest crisis of his life. He knew he wasn't Qin Sang's match and could only delay, hoping the woman in purple would notice the anomaly and activate the formation to save him.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword arrived in a flash.  Unhesitating, it pierced the curtain, its blade trembling as a stream of blood sprayed across it.</p><p>Defiled, the Crimson Cloud Barrier's light dimmed, its power greatly diminished.  Damaged, the cloud curtain dissipated, unable to maintain itself.</p><p>The Ebony Sword relentlessly pierced the curtain, catching up to Yue Sanren in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Yue Sanren tried to summon more treasures, but suddenly felt a darkening around him.  He cried out in his heart, realizing he'd fallen into the Seven Souls Killing Formation!</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The Ebony Sword vanished, the sword array transforming into countless sword threads, shredding Yue Sanren!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't fully mastered the Seven Souls Killing Formation. Against Ye Lao Mo and the others, its power was somewhat lacking, but against someone like Yue Sanren, its might was enough to terrify.</p><p>The duel was incredibly fast.</p><p>In a dizzying series of events, Yue Sanren lost his folding fan and then his Crimson Cloud Barrier.</p><p>The woman in purple, controlling the main formation, finally noticed.  Caught off guard, before she could react, Yue Sanren was already in extreme danger.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed, giant waves rising from all sides, crashing towards Qin Sang with incredible force.</p><p>Qin Sang completely ignored them, focusing on the sword array.</p><p>Within the array, Yue Sanren screamed repeatedly.</p><p>At that moment, a gray hurricane appeared above the battlefield. The hurricane pressed down, with the faint shadow of a tower within it, seemingly slow but fast, forming a thick wind wall, suppressing the giant waves at the critical moment.</p><p>This was planned. Qing Jun, while managing the main formation, had been constantly watching Qin Sang's movements and intervened promptly to eliminate external interference.  She integrated the pressure of the Xun Wind Array into the Seven Souls Killing Formation, helping Qin Sang subdue Yue Sanren and swiftly end the fight.</p><p>This completely extinguished Yue Sanren's hope of survival!</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>A sword thread flashed.</p><p>Yue Sanren's left arm was severed at the shoulder, his body covered in bloody wounds.  At the brink of death, he made a final desperate attempt, roaring as he lunged forward, unleashing dozens of poison-refined thunder beads, breaking free from the pressure. The sword array faltered. He let the sword array shred his physical body, his Nascent Soul escaping from the top of his head.  He glanced around blankly, fixing on a direction, ready to use his instant movement technique.</p><p>However, the Seven Souls Killing Formation suddenly emitted a bright, eerie light, unleashing a strange wave of energy.</p><p>Yue Sanren's Nascent Soul suddenly faltered, missing a crucial opportunity.  When he recovered, he was horrified to find a flying sword appearing before him, its energy razor-sharp!</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Unending fear filled Yue Sanren's eyes, his scream abruptly cut short.</p><p>The ebony sword pierced through him, shattering his Nascent Soul instantly!</p><p>Qin Sang showed no mercy, killing Yue Sanren decisively.</p><p>The sword array dissipated, the eerie light vanishing. Yue Sanren was completely gone from the world. Qin Sang reached out, taking Yue Sanren's storage pouch and magical treasures.</p><p>This was the second Nascent Soul from the Zu Yuan sect he had slain in this way.</p><p>On Shuangjing Mountain, the purple-robed woman directing the array was furious, her eyes blazing. They never expected Qin Sang's masterful disguise as Madam Luo, setting this trap.</p><p>Yue Sanren was incompetent; he was killed almost instantly, utterly helpless, without even a chance for his Nascent Soul to escape.  There was no time for rescue.</p><p>Since Qin Sang's emergence, including Ye Laomo's blood demon incarnation, three Zu Yuan Nascent Souls had fallen at his hands, utterly destroyed, body and soul. The losses were devastating.</p><p>Down the mountain, Madam Luo, assisting Qing Jun, had returned to her true form, smiling charmingly and provocatively towards the summit.</p><p>Madam Luo was delighted.</p><p>The plan had worked. While Qin Sang's incredible strength was responsible for the Nascent Soul's demise, Madam Luo's contribution was undeniable.  And it was Yue Sanren, her most hated enemy, who died – a double victory.</p><p>Early in the battle, the fall of a Nascent Soul sent shockwaves through the Zu Yuan forces; the remaining Nascent Souls' faces fell.</p><p>The purple-robed woman summoned others via divine sense to manage the array, then personally entered the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang put away Yue Sanren's storage pouch and scanned its contents with his divine sense. The Zu Yuan had been plundering Tianxing Alliance for years, and Yue Sanren had accumulated considerable wealth.</p><p>He glanced through it; there were no extraordinary treasures, only ordinary items.</p><p>Then, a cold snort pierced the air.  Ripples disturbed the water, and a figure emerged – the purple-robed woman.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly at her appearance. He quickly put away the pouch, flicked his sleeve, and unleashed his eighteen demonic banners; demonic flames swirled around him.</p><p>This woman was a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Her aura faintly surpassed that of Dongyang Bo.</p><p>"Immortal Qiu Zhi!"</p><p>Qin Sang remembered her identity.</p><p>She originally came from a minor sect under Xing Heng Sect, a sect forcefully absorbed.  Gifted, she soon formed her Nascent Soul and publicly declared her independence from Xing Heng Sect.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng had tried to subdue her, but she not only resisted but broke through to mid-Nascent Soul, forcing Elder Tianzheng to negotiate.</p><p>Qin Sang grew wary;  Immortal Qiu Zhi had come seeking him.</p>
