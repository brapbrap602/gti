<h1>Chapter 147: The Witchcraft Formation</h1><p>Tower of Heaven.</p><p>The group of witches traversed the valley's barrier and located the stone hall.  Inside, it was pitch black.  Upon entering, they discovered the absence of the dangerous restrictions present outside, yet they remained cautious, refraining from recklessly extending their spiritual senses and instead opting for a patient investigation.</p><p>Venerable Fang continued to lead the way.  The space within was more expansive than anticipated.  Seeing no apparent anomalies, the High Priestess instructed everyone to remain vigilant while spreading out slightly.</p><p>"Skeletal remains ahead!" Venerable Fang's voice suddenly transmitted through a mental connection.</p><p>Everyone tensed, quickly gathering behind Venerable Fang.  Their spiritual senses swept forward, confirming the presence of numerous skeletons scattered across the floor.</p><p>These remains, bleached white with age, had clearly been there for an immeasurable time. Venerable Fang sent a gust of wind towards one of the skeletons, instantly reducing it to dust, a testament to its complete decay.</p><p>The High Priestess, her expression grave, surveyed the area.  "Fellow Daoists, exercise caution."</p><p>Venerable Fang paused briefly before continuing forward. The others, each summoning their protective talismans, followed closely behind.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what do you think the chances are of finding Witch Clan relics in such a desolate place?" Venerable Fang communicated privately with the High Priestess, his tone laced with dissatisfaction.</p><p>The stone hall emanated an aura of emptiness and desolation. Aside from the scattered skeletons, there was nothing else, not even a trace of restrictions or spiritual formations.</p><p>The High Priestess reassured him, "Venerable Fang, have patience. The stone disc clearly belongs to the Witch Clan. The fact that the divine inscription activated the disc, opening the stone hall, isn't that proof enough of this place's connection to our clan? This hall might have been built by our ancestors, but its location within a human ancient sect's secret realm must have a reason."</p><p>"I hope your judgment is correct," Venerable Fang replied curtly, falling silent before abruptly accelerating forward.</p><p>After flying for a while, Venerable Fang stopped suddenly.  The High Priestess, arriving shortly after, caught sight of what lay ahead, a flicker of surprise in her eyes.</p><p>Before them stood a massive stone pillar, exuding an ancient aura.  Its surface was covered in intricate and complex carvings.  When their spiritual senses brushed against it, they detected no fluctuations.  The pillar bore no restrictive seals nor was it a magical artifact.</p><p>Yet, the High Priestess's eyes lit up with excitement.  She darted towards the pillar, gently tracing the carvings with her fingers. "These carvings bear the same essence as divine inscriptions. If I'm not mistaken, this is a unique formation recorded in our Witch Clan's history! There must be more than one pillar here. Fellow Daoists..."</p><p>Before she could finish, the others understood, dispersing to search for more pillars.</p><p>Soon, all the pillars within the hall were found.  There were eight in total, arranged in eight directions, forming a grand formation.  They carefully memorized the carvings on each pillar and gathered to analyze them.</p><p>However, with so little of the Witch Clan's heritage remaining, their understanding of this formation was superficial at best.  Despite their efforts, they made little headway, resorting to attempting to activate the pillars' power.</p><p>Even with the application of divine inscription power, the pillars remained unresponsive.  The High Priestess frowned, taken aback by this unexpected development.</p><p>Just then, Venerable Fang, after circling the pillars, spoke, "Could these pillars have lost their power due to the passage of time?"</p><p>"The restrictions outside the hall remain intact. The pillars, hidden within, untouched by anyone, how could they have deteriorated faster?" a Witch Clan elder questioned.</p><p>"That depends on the purpose of this formation. The outer restrictions were likely far more powerful initially.  They've undoubtedly weakened over time, allowing us passage with just two Wind Extremity Nails. The High Priestess suspected this formation was related to a seal. If the sealed demonic being is still alive and constantly attacking the seal, eventually breaking the formation, it's not impossible," Venerable Fang countered.</p><p>"The demonic being has broken the seal?" The others gasped in alarm.</p><p>The High Priestess remained calm. "Fellow Daoists, there's no need to worry.  A being worthy of being sealed by both the Human and Witch Clans must have been incredibly powerful.  If the pillars lost their power long ago and the demon had broken free, the Cang Lang Sea would be in ruins. Look at these skeletons, some with unusual forms. They might be the remains of the sealed demon, reduced to bones before the seal dissipated..."</p><p>As she spoke, the High Priestess suddenly activated her movement technique, flying towards the center of the formation.  Sweeping aside the bones to reveal the smooth floor beneath, her spiritual sense scanned the area.  Her eyes narrowed, and she began to form hand seals, slowly pressing downwards.</p><p>A rumbling sound echoed through the hall as a descending staircase materialized before them.</p><p>"There's another level below!"  Everyone was both surprised and excited.</p><p>Surprised because the demonic being sealed below was bound to be stronger, posing a threat should it be released. Excited because the seal below might still be intact, offering them a glimpse into the profound path of the Witch Clan.</p><p>"If there are similar seals below, be sure to memorize them. It will aid in comprehending the Dao of Divine Inscriptions. Even if we don't find ancestral relics, this journey won't be in vain," the High Priestess instructed.</p><p>Venerable Fang, once again, was the first to descend, scouting the path ahead.</p><p>The second level was considerably smaller than the first.  They quickly located the second seal, different from the pillars of the first level, but clearly also the work of Witch Clan ancestors.</p><p>Using a similar method, they found the entrance to the third level.</p><p>Their caution intensified. Venerable Fang employed some unknown technique, his figure flickering in and out of existence, almost ethereal.</p><p>Upon receiving Venerable Fang's signal, they cautiously entered the third level.  The sight that greeted them was astonishing.</p><p>The third level was the smallest, only a dozen or so meters across.  In the center of the stone hall stood a circular stone platform, surrounded by eight stone pillars, shorter than those on the first level.</p><p>However, the carvings on these pillars were far more exquisite and profound than those above.</p><p>The platform itself was empty, devoid of bones, unlike their expectation of a sealed demon.</p><p>Venerable Fang hovered beside the platform, gazing intently at one of the pillars.  He then delivered startling news, "This formation still retains some residual power!"</p><p>The High Priestess's face lit up with joy.  She swiftly approached the platform, cautiously observing for a moment before immersing herself in deciphering the formation.</p><p>The third level was small, and the others quickly searched the area, confirming the absence of any hidden demons. They then joined the High Priestess, examining the pillars.</p><p>A strange silence descended upon the stone hall.  Everyone stared intently at the seemingly ordinary pillars, as if they were priceless treasures.</p><p>But in the end, including Venerable Fang, they gradually withdrew their gazes, shaking their heads in disappointment.</p><p>Only the High Priestess remained deep in thought.</p>
