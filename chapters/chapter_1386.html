<h1>Chapter 1378 Xuan Tian Palace</h1><p>Chapter 1378 Xuan Tian Palace</p><p>“Are you satisfied, Daoist friend?”</p><p>The old steward asked with a smile, seeing Qin Sang withdraw his spiritual sense from the jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered inwardly.</p><p>The contents of the *Insect Flower Scripture* gave him some inspiration, but unfortunately, it was not of much help to his three spirit insects, and the content was rather superficial, offering little guidance in cultivating four-transformation spirit insects.</p><p>If he obtained the complete *Insect Flower Scripture*, perhaps he could truly gain something.</p><p>He should visit Hundred Flowers Valley for a chance to have a face-to-face exchange with high-level cultivators there.</p><p>Hearing the old steward's question, Qin Sang lifted his eyelids slightly, glancing at the scattered jade slips on the table, “Your trading house is backed by Master Feng; surely you have more than just this little collection?”</p><p>The old steward chuckled, “Master Feng’s supernatural powers are unparalleled, and there are many senior brothers on Fengyang Mountain with profound magical powers. Of course, we have more. However, although Fengyang Trading House has some reputation among low-level cultivators, it isn't highly regarded on Fengyang Mountain.  Some things aren't readily sold in the trading house; you should understand.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, put away the *Insect Flower Scripture*, looked at the old steward, and said calmly, “It seems I need to pay a personal visit and ask Master Feng for guidance in person.”</p><p>Hearing this, the old steward was stunned.</p><p>The next moment, the old steward felt a blur before his eyes, and the person opposite him had vanished into thin air.</p><p>The old steward's face changed drastically; he sprang up from his chair as if his seat were on fire.</p><p>He pushed open the door of the quiet room, about to rush out, when the old steward suddenly remembered something and hastily took out a message talisman.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>…</p><p>The divine bell rang out, its sound shaking the heavens, signifying the arrival of a distinguished guest.</p><p>It is said that the divine bell on Fengyang Mountain is an ancient treasure.</p><p>Within the city, whether commoners or cultivators, upon hearing the bell, felt a surge of blood and a tremor in their hearts. People rushed out of shops and caves, looking up at the mountaintop.</p><p>But they only saw clouds.</p><p>At the entrance of Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>A Golden Core cultivator, having received the news, hurried down the mountain. Seeing Qin Sang watching the scenery on the stone steps, he quickly stepped forward to pay his respects, “Junior Chu Huanqiang, I didn't know you had arrived, senior. I failed to greet you properly; please forgive me!”</p><p>“I heard that Master Feng has been looking for me. I also wanted to visit Master Feng, so I came… Why, isn't Master Feng in the mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Chu Huanqiang, frowning and asking.</p><p>“So it's you, senior!”</p><p>Chu Huanqiang suddenly realized, repeatedly apologizing, “With all due respect, senior, Master and the other senior brothers are at sea. Only I am left behind. However, Master instructed me to return to the mountain immediately upon receiving news of you.  If you have no urgent business, I hope you will stay in the mountain for a while. I will immediately send a message to Master…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then nodded, “Very well, lead the way.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Chu Huanqiang was overjoyed.</p><p>Qin Sang declined the customary courtesies, asked Chu Huanqiang to find him a quiet room, and then closed the door to all visitors.</p><p>…</p><p>Overseas.</p><p>On the same nameless islet.</p><p>In the palace, including Master Feng, the three Yuan Ying cultivators from before were all present.</p><p>At this time, the three of them looked somewhat tense, staring intently at the person in white sitting cross-legged in the middle.</p><p>This person was the scholar in white who, together with Master Feng, had startled away the Bi Fang.</p><p>The scholar in white had his eyes closed, his hands folded on his lap, palms upward, supporting a fist-sized sphere. At first glance, it looked like a pearl, but upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be a sphere of spiritual light.</p><p>Inside the sphere, a worm-like crimson object was wriggling.</p><p>The blood worm was like a living creature, its head raised high, swaying uncertainly.</p><p>The scholar in white remained motionless.</p><p>The blood worm's movements grew increasingly faster.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Master Feng and the others became even more nervous, afraid to disturb the scholar in white.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The blood worm exploded.</p><p>Fortunately, it was restrained by the light sphere, and it quickly recombined, but it transformed into a drop of blood, quietly suspended in the middle of the light sphere.</p><p>The crimson was striking.</p><p>A flush appeared on the scholar in white's face, his body trembled slightly, and he opened his eyes, revealing weariness in his gaze.</p><p>“Daoist Shen, are you injured?”</p><p>Master Feng asked with concern.</p><p>The scholar in white shook his head, “That demonic rat has perished. No matter how strange its bloodline abilities are, they couldn't possibly injure me. However, the consumption was indeed excessive, exceeding my expectations.”</p><p>“It's good that you're not injured. Did you discover that person's whereabouts?”</p><p>Master Feng nodded and pressed further.</p><p>The scholar in white gave a wry smile, “Not good. After all, I can only imitate the demonic rat's bloodline abilities and indirectly sense the mark the rat left on that person. The perception is very vague. I only know that this person hasn't left this sea area yet and is still hiding somewhere.”</p><p>Feng Shangshi frowned slightly, his expression unchanging.  He said reassuringly, "Don't worry. The demonic rat is dead. The demons won't find him any faster than we will.  What we've accomplished is already remarkable! If it weren't for Shen Daoyou's extraordinary abilities, his eavesdropping on the demons' plans, and his hunting of the demonic rat, we'd still be in the dark, believing the demons were about to launch a full-scale invasion. They completely deceived us!"</p><p>The scholar in white robes didn't boast. He sighed softly, "Unfortunately, what we've done is still too little! I suspect that the person is hiding in this sea area, remaining motionless for so long, not just because of severe injuries. I fear he's already devised a way to erase his identifying marks and is in the process of doing so."</p><p>Feng Shangshi responded nonchalantly, "We've done what we could; the rest is up to fate.  Obtaining the person's treasures would be good, of course, but even if he escapes, it's no great loss to us."</p><p>At this point, the female cultivator with the phoenix crown, who had been listening to their conversation, spoke up, "The person the two Daoists encountered earlier, the one pursued by the Bi Fang—could he be...?"</p><p>"It's not him."</p><p>The scholar in white shook his head. "We can be certain. The Xuan Tian Palace traitor the demons are searching for was only at the early Yuan Ying stage. He possessed considerable abilities and was exceptionally skilled in concealment, allowing him to evade capture for so long.  He couldn't have broken through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage in such a short time after being pursued, and if he were also proficient in lightning escape techniques, he would have shaken off his pursuers long ago. He wouldn't have ended up so badly."</p><p>"So, that person really just happened to stumble upon the Bi Fang by chance?"</p><p>The phoenix-crowned cultivator chuckled, finding the person's misfortune amusing.</p><p>The black-clad swordsman, unconcerned with Qin Sang, focused on the demonic blood in the white-robed scholar's hand, pressing, "That guy really is a Xuan Tian Palace traitor?  To escape from Xuan Tian Palace and reach here... it's over a million miles, and not from the Endless Sea. He was pursued by the demonic rat all the way, dragging his injured body, practically fleeing along the edge of the demon territory. It's almost unbelievable!"</p><p>"That's precisely what I overheard."</p><p>The scholar in white said, "This person was pursued by Xuan Tian Palace in Yin Ri Territory and, desperate, fled into the demon island, where he was secretly followed by the demonic rat. He came from Xuan Tian Palace, so he certainly wouldn't lack abilities or treasures. Also, the demonic rat coveted the secrets this person possessed and didn't want to share them with others, so he pursued him alone, giving the person a chance to breathe. If this person hadn't fled to this sea area, into our human territory, the demonic rat wouldn't have been so willing to invite other demon kings to help!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I'm late again. The next chapter will be delayed. I'll make up the missed updates later.</p>
