<h1>Chapter 1127: The Alliance Meeting</h1><p>Chapter 1127: The Alliance Meeting</p><p>The Zhitain Peak starstones are the key to activating the Xiaoběichén star array and entering the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Initially, the Xiao Han Domain and the Tianxing Alliance used Zhitain Peak as a battleground to decide who would provide the other materials for the array.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly brought Senior Sister Qingjun inside, ambushing the Yuan Shen Gate elders, and discovered a hidden teleportation array connecting to another immortal mansion.</p><p>That immortal mansion was previously controlled by the Yuan Shen Gate, but it should now be in Senior Sister Qingjun's hands.</p><p>They arrived at the tomb.</p><p>After paying their respects, they returned to the wooden hut.</p><p>Qingjun said, "The immortal mansion and the teleportation array are still there, but entering Zhitain Peak is not easy. We must wait for the two domains to jointly decide to lift the restrictions on Zhitain Peak before the teleportation array can be activated. The 'key' to unlocking Zhitain Peak's restrictions isn't solely in the hands of one or two powers; everyone must agree…"</p><p>"It's like that…"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>No wonder Qingjun was so confident she could ambush the Yuan Shen Gate people at Zhitain Peak; they also had to wait for the restrictions on Zhitain Peak to be lifted before they could enter and steal the starstones.</p><p>"I wonder if the two domains will hold another contest to obtain the starstones beforehand?"</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qingjun shook her head, "With the united front against the Abyss of Sin, the two domains don't want any further internal strife, so they've decided to abolish the contest rules.  Not long before the last appearance of the Purple Micro Palace, they jointly opened Zhitain Peak to obtain the starstones. The materials needed for the array were also provided equally by both domains. Unless there's a new opportunity in the future, it's unlikely to change."</p><p>"This…"</p><p>This greatly surprised Qin Sang. He hadn't expected so many obstacles to entering Zhitain Peak.</p><p>If he had to wait for the next appearance of the Purple Micro Palace to sneak into Zhitain Peak, it would be many years.</p><p>Although there have been recent changes to the Purple Micro Palace, shortening the intervals between its appearances.</p><p>The pattern remains elusive, even assuming the shortest interval,  it would still be at least 130 years – the amount of time he was trapped in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>He's only been back for less than thirty years.</p><p>His cultivation is about to reach the peak of the Golden Core stage, is he supposed to watch the Du E Pill and wait for a hundred years?</p><p>"Are there any signs of spiritual tides appearing in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Previously, the time intervals between appearances were getting shorter.</p><p>This time, might the Purple Micro Palace appear even sooner?</p><p>Qingjun saw what Qin Sang was thinking and said, "We've had similar speculations and have been monitoring changes in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. There's no news yet; it probably won't be as quick as anticipated. However, if Zhitain Peak isn't absolutely necessary, there might be other ways, it just depends on your courage…"</p><p>Qingjun seemed to remember something, and her tone suddenly changed, becoming deeply meaningful.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and repeatedly asked, "What other methods do you have, Senior Sister?"</p><p>Those who can cultivate to this level aren't cowards; it's simply a matter of necessity.</p><p>"Do you remember the ambush by the Abyss of Sin on the cultivators of both domains at the outer array of the Purple Micro Palace?"</p><p>Qingjun gestured towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"If you and that Taiyi Danzong disciple hadn't given advance warning and exposed the identity of the Lord of the Wujimen's spy, both domains would have suffered heavy losses, probably becoming the Abyss of Sin's territory already.</p><p>"In any case, both domains acknowledge your contribution, including myself; I owe you a debt of gratitude.</p><p>"While in the Purple Micro Palace, they decided to reward you two.</p><p>"The Taiyi Danzong disciple used the reward to repay his sect.  You disappeared from the Purple Micro Palace, and the Earl Dongyang wouldn't dare claim credit for your achievements; later, the matter was left unresolved.</p><p>"After so much time, things have changed; it would be difficult for you to gain much benefit from this now.</p><p>"However, getting them to agree to open Zhitain Peak and allow you to absorb the starstone energy should be possible. Since the inner palace array of the Purple Micro Palace has changed, the power of the outer array has also been significantly reduced.  Perhaps the Xiaoběichén star array might not be needed to enter the Purple Micro Palace in the future, making Zhitain Peak less crucial.</p><p>"The Abyss of Sin is stirring again, and the two domains are about to hold an alliance meeting on Cang Heng Island in the Yun Cang Great Marsh to discuss resisting them; that's why I'm back.</p><p>"You can come with me."</p><p>Qingjun finished, smiling at Qin Sang, her eyes slightly mischievous, as if teasing him.</p><p>This expression was new, quite fitting her youthful appearance.</p><p>Cang Heng Island, a large island in the Yun Cang Great Marsh, was originally unremarkable.  After the alliance between the two domains,  Cang Heng Island, conveniently located between the two powers, was chosen as the meeting place.</p><p>With the thawing of relations between the two domains, trade between cultivators opened up, and a sizable city quickly formed on Cang Heng Island, becoming increasingly prosperous in recent years.</p><p>"Earl Dongyang will be there too, won't he?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly, understanding why Qingjun said this.  He hasn't formed his Nascent Soul yet; going to Earl Dongyang now would be like walking into a trap.</p><p>Qingjun nodded, "Not long after the last time he left the Purple Micro Palace, Earl Dongyang's cultivation increased significantly."</p><p>Chongyi Daozhang, though he has nurtured two Yuan Ying stage disciples for Taiyi Danzong, has not made progress himself for many years.  "In Xiao Han domain, Dongyang Bo's strength is second only to Tongyou Lao Mo, making him the leader of the righteous path.  We must go."</p><p>"How does your strength compare to Dongyang Bo, Senior Sister?" Qin Sang asked curiously, noticing her high spirits. He still couldn't fathom Qing Jun's abilities.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's power also astonished him. No wonder Shaohua Mountain's status was rising. Dongyang Bo's cultivation is now the highest among the righteous path, undoubtedly at the mid-Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Facing such a formidable opponent, Qin Sang wouldn't dare to appear openly until at least after his own Yuan Ying breakthrough.</p><p>Qing Jun smiled without answering, "From what I know of Dongyang Bo, there's something fishy about his breakthrough. Let's wait and see. With me by your side, he won't dare attack you publicly. You're now an elder of Yuanshen Gate.  After we return, cultivate diligently at Yuanshen Gate and focus on your Yuan Ying breakthrough. Dongyang Bo is far less skilled as a teacher than Chongyi Daozhang. None of his disciples have achieved Yuan Ying, and the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace Master, who works closely with Shaohua Mountain, hasn't made much progress either. With your strength, you have nothing to fear from them."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, *This Senior Sister is truly unfathomable.*</p><p>He paced back and forth, pondering for a moment before deciding, "Thank you, Senior Sister! I'll go to Changheng Island with you!"</p><p>Let Senior Sister handle Dongyang Bo.</p><p>This Yuan Ying breakthrough is too important to be timid!</p><p>At worst, I can hide before the breakthrough.</p><p>Yunyouzi has prepared all the necessary pills for the breakthrough, and I've already purchased most of the other required spiritual materials.</p><p>From Senior Sister's tone, it seems the Zuoyuan is about to return with a vengeance, and chaos is imminent. I need to break through as soon as possible.</p><p>"The alliance meeting is in a month. Be prepared." Qing Jun nodded.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang expressed his concerns about the situation and asked his Senior Sister.</p><p>Qing Jun thought for a while and said, "It's hard to say what the Zuoyuan is planning. As for the Xiao Han domain, I haven't been in the two domains for years, but upon returning, I heard something significant:  the Pure Yang Sect recently split."</p><p>"The Pure Yang Sect split?"</p><p>Qin Sang had heard about the unrest in the Pure Yang Sect, but he didn't expect it to split so quickly.  These past few years, he had been focusing on cultivation and studying sword manuals, paying little attention to external affairs and missing this news.</p>
