<h1>Chapter 892: Entering the Island</h1><p>“Even so, Senior Brother Zhao must have put in a lot of effort to find out so much.”</p><p>The disguised Zhang Heng chuckled. “Senior Brother Zhao, I can't just take you to the Gloomwood based on your words alone. You must first tell me clearly what you intend to do. Otherwise, if something goes wrong, I won't be able to explain it to the sect.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao was silent for a moment, then said, “Junior Brother is right. I won't hide anything anymore! I once obtained a demonic secret art that can draw upon the power of thunder, guiding it into the Qi Sea, breaking it down and then rebuilding it, forcefully establishing the Foundation Establishment stage. Junior Brother also knows that the power of thunder is incredibly violent and terrifying. I'm afraid that before I even touch the thunder, I'll be incinerated. After much inquiry, I learned that in your sect's Gloomwood, due to the unique properties of the Gloomwood trees, a thin layer of Yin Thunder accumulates, and it's much gentler than elsewhere. I might have a chance of succeeding there. However, the elders of my sect would never allow me to risk my life with this method, so I can only ask Junior Brother Zhang for help. If I succeed, I'm willing to give this secret art to Junior Brother Zhang. You can also ask for other conditions; as long as I can do it, I won't refuse!”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao's tone was resolute.</p><p>“Foundation Establishment through thunder?”</p><p>Zhang Heng was stunned.</p><p>This was the first time he had heard of such a method. A Qi Refinement cultivator daring to draw thunder into their body? It would likely result in instant death. This person was truly audacious.</p><p>However, the concept of destruction and rebirth resonated deeply with him.  He and Wandering Scholar had both walked that path.</p><p>Was this another ruthless individual?</p><p>Zhang Heng glanced at Zhao Songqiao, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>At this moment, Fang Ting couldn't help but speak up, pleading, “Senior Brother Zhang, if it's possible to enter the Gloomwood, please help Senior Brother Zhao.”</p><p>Zhang Heng raised an eyebrow. “Junior Sister, you have top-tier dual spiritual roots. You won't lack Foundation Establishment pills in the future. Why do you need such a dangerous secret art?”</p><p>Fang Ting blushed, her lips moving slightly. Suddenly, she transmitted her voice softly, “Senior Brother Zhao gave me a Rejuvenation Pill. I initially thought Master would also go, so under Master's banner, I... ate the Rejuvenation Pill. Besides, Senior Brother, you might be able to use this secret art. If Senior Brother Zhao fails and dies, we simply won't cultivate it. We won't lose anything. If the secret art is successful, you can establish your foundation with me!”</p><p>“A Rejuvenation Pill? How old are you?”</p><p>Zhang Heng was speechless.</p><p>A Rejuvenation Pill could maintain one's youthful appearance. While not as effective as the legendary Eternal Youth Pill, it was still very rare.  Cultivators, especially those below the Core Formation stage, found it difficult to completely erase the marks of time. Not everyone had access to Three Lights Jade Liquid. This kind of medicinal herb was especially tempting to female cultivators.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao had truly given the right gift.</p><p>Fang Ting's face flushed crimson.</p><p>Zhang Heng detected a hint of sincerity in the latter part of Fang Ting's words and pondered silently.</p><p>Using Jin Yan's name to enter the Gloomwood wouldn't be difficult; he himself would wander around there anyway. Taking Zhao Songqiao along might be a bit more troublesome.</p><p>The key was whether it was worth it.</p><p>He was curious about this secret art, wondering if he could adapt it for his original body. With his original body's cultivation level, the danger of drawing thunder into the body would be much smaller.</p><p>Furthermore, he had recently learned of a location, occupied by both the Clepsydra Sect and the Misty Pavilion.  If he wanted to infiltrate it, he might need to use Fang Ting's identity.</p><p>“Junior Sister Fang, if it weren't for you, I would definitely hesitate. Since you're pleading for Senior Brother Zhao, I can try my best, but I can't guarantee it will work.”</p><p>Zhang Heng said after a moment of contemplation.</p><p>“Really! Thank you, Senior Brother! As long as you agree, it will definitely work!”</p><p>Fang Ting's heart was finally at ease.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao's face was also filled with joy. He stood up and bowed, his voice even trembling slightly, “Thank you, Junior Brother Zhang, for your trouble!”</p><p>“There's no need for such formalities, Senior Brother Zhao.”</p><p>Zhang Heng raised a hand dismissively.  His tone became serious, "Senior Brother Zhao, let's not talk about conditions. Consider it a favor for Junior Sister. But let's make things clear: once we're inside, you must obey my commands and not act on your own. Otherwise, if something happens, I won't speak a word for you."</p><p>He then looked at Fang Ting. “Junior Sister, don't get too excited.  I'll need you to do me a favor in the near future.”</p><p>“Consider it done.”</p><p>Fang Ting didn't even ask what it was, readily agreeing.</p><p>The three of them discussed for a while longer, and then Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao left with joyful expressions.</p><p>After seeing them off, Zhang Heng summoned the Celestial Eye Butterfly and pondered. The butterfly hadn't detected anything unusual about Zhao Songqiao earlier. Perhaps he was overthinking things.</p><p>He would have the butterfly keep an eye on Zhao Songqiao, observing him as he performed the secret art. If Zhao Songqiao made any suspicious moves, he would eliminate him immediately.</p><p>However, to bring them inside, Zhang Heng still needed to ask Jin Yan for a mission.</p><p>With this in mind, Zhang Heng flew out of his cave dwelling, heading straight for the stone hall.</p><p>…</p><p>Five days later.</p><p>A cloud of mist flew at breakneck speed, swiftly passing over the mountains and arriving above the shimmering sea. Its speed didn't decrease as it continued to race forward.</p><p>Faintly, figures could be seen standing within the cloud.</p><p>“Junior Brother Lu, your Cloud Mist Skiff has been refined to the point where you can control it at will. At full speed, it’s almost as fast as a high-grade magical treasure.”</p><p>Two Daoists stood at the front of the cloud.</p><p>One of them, holding a horsetail whisk, was Elder Hua Yang. He turned slightly, offering flattering words.</p><p>The other person looked much younger than Elder Hua Yang, with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, possessing a natural air of authority.</p><p>This person shared the same surname as the Clepsydra Sect's leader, Lu Xiaoyun, and was Lu Xiaoyun’s adopted son.  A remarkably talented cultivator, he was already at the peak of the Core Formation stage and was the First Peak Master of Azure Wave Peak.</p><p>With Lu Xiaoyun absent, he handled the sect’s affairs.  It was expected that he would succeed Lu Xiaoyun as the sect leader.</p><p>At this moment, Zhang Heng stood at the back of the Cloud Mist Skiff, hidden among the crowd, silent.</p><p>“Senior Brother Hua Yang flatters me. This treasure has been refined multiple times, exhausting its potential. It’s far from a high-grade magical treasure and can only be used for travel...”</p><p>Saying this, Peak Master Lu looked towards the distance. “We set off a little early. I wonder if the other sects have arrived.”</p><p>“According to custom, the Misty Pavilion and the others, who set up the restrictions on Insight Island with us, will arrive early. As for the other sects, they'll likely arrive after midnight tonight, when Mount Longxing opens.”</p><p>Elder Hua Yang seemed very familiar with the proceedings of the gathering.</p><p>Peak Master Lu nodded slightly. “This is the first time Junior Brother is presiding over the gathering. I’ll need Senior Brother Hua Yang’s assistance…”</p><p>As they spoke, the Cloud Mist Skiff glided across the blue sky and sea.</p><p>Before long, a few unusual glows appeared in the distance ahead – various flying artifacts.</p><p>“It’s actually Peak Master Lu himself!”</p><p>“Qi greets Peak Master Lu!”</p><p>…</p><p>Several figures flew out from the artifacts, welcoming them from afar.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Sorry, I overslept. This is to make up for yesterday’s. There’s more coming soon.</p>
