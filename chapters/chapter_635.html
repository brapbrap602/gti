<h1>Chapter 627: Fragments of the Forbidden Talisman</h1><p>Chapter 627: Fragments of the Forbidden Talisman</p><p>Putting away the three jade slips, Qin Sang examined his inner self.</p><p>Within his dantian, a five-colored golden core resided in the center, slowly rotating.</p><p>The golden core contained the beauty of the Dao, captivating and indescribable.</p><p>In comparison, the sealed bluish-black corpse core paled in comparison.</p><p>However, the power gap between the golden core and the corpse core was not large now; the corpse core was even slightly stronger. One gathered Qin Sang's essence, spirit, and energy; the other was refined from other people's golden cores and incorporated fierce煞 energy.</p><p>Only after Qin Sang breaks through to the mid-stage of the Core Formation stage will a clear difference appear.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang's expectations, the golden core was predominantly wood-green in color. At the moment of spiritual energy infusion during core formation, his true essence was replaced, primarily becoming wood-type spiritual energy.</p><p>The *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen* inherently does not belong to any of the five elements.</p><p>Qin Sang's foundation was the *幽冥经* (Youming Scripture), a water-type cultivation method.  Later, through the *玄牝玉鼎真经* (Xuanpin Jade Cauldron Scripture) and the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen*, he primarily used water-type spiritual energy, which did not affect his cultivation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it changed on its own after Core Formation.</p><p>It must be due to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>When he initially practiced the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen*, when choosing a spirit sword, he could only select one among the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) of spiritual materials. Qin Sang only had the Ebony Sword's embryo, so he naturally chose to refine the spirit wood.</p><p>After core formation, the cultivation method changed itself due to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>It seems that the importance of the natal spirit sword to the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen* and the cultivator in the future is even greater than Qin Sang imagined.</p><p>But he wonders what the complete *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen* would be like at higher levels?</p><p>Qin Sang yearned for it, but had no clue about the complete cultivation method, he could only follow the path pioneered by Elder Qingzhu, taking things one step at a time.</p><p>If he could form a Nascent Soul, he could consider these matters.</p><p>It would be great if Elder Qingzhu were still alive; he might have already created cultivation methods for the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang silently prayed for Elder Qingzhu, then moved his gaze from his golden core to other areas.</p><p>At this time, his qi sea could only be described as chaotic!</p><p>Besides the golden core and the corpse core, there was a mass of gray qi and some golden talisman fragments!</p><p>When he formed his core, Qin Sang sensed Cui Xuanzi's visit, but delayed going out because he was examining these two things.</p><p>Those talisman fragments were the forbidden talisman placed on him by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>During the spiritual energy infusion, as Qin Sang expected, the forbidden talisman was indeed broken, but not completely removed.  Some fragments remained in his dantian.</p><p>The success of his core formation was somewhat dampened by these stubborn talisman fragments.</p><p>This is the skill of a Nascent Soul ancestor; even a casually made forbidden talisman is so difficult to deal with?</p><p>He tried to use his golden core and true essence, but found a subtle delay caused by the talisman fragments. Under normal circumstances, this delay wouldn't matter. But in a life-or-death struggle against a strong enemy, it might cause a slight delay in casting spells or activating magic treasures, giving the enemy the upper hand.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to break them himself, but found that although the talisman was shattered, the fragments remained extremely hard. With his current strength, he couldn't forcefully break them; he would have to wait until he reached the late Core Formation stage.</p><p>A complete forbidden talisman would probably be troublesome even for a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Back then, if the jade Buddha hadn't protected his primordial spirit, and he hadn't retained some combat ability, even if Chen Yan had rescued him from Dongyang Bo, he wouldn't have been able to break the forbidden talisman in a short time, and he wouldn't have been able to escape on his own.</p><p>Qin Sang had to admit that Dongyang Bo was indeed cautious and meticulous, only overlooking the jade Buddha.</p><p>After trying many methods without success, Qin Sang finally gave up and temporarily ignored it.</p><p>The influence of the talisman fragments was neither small nor large; at least he didn't have to worry about it in the early Core Formation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang tried cultivating, discovering that the cultivation method required a complete cycle after another, and could not be rushed. The delay in true essence caused by the talisman fragments would not hinder his progress.</p><p>This greatly eased his concerns.</p><p>As for the influence during battle, he could compensate with an external pill.</p><p>The golden core is the most important thing for every Core Formation cultivator, and they generally do not dare to let it leave their body. If attacked by the enemy, the golden core may be damaged at best, and their cultivation will plummet at worst.</p><p>External pills do not have the same restrictions. If truly facing a critical situation, Qin Sang could move an external pill out of his qi sea, thus avoiding the restrictions of the talisman fragments.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still didn't know how to improve his external pill.</p><p>Once Qin Sang's cultivation breaks through to the mid-Core Formation stage, the external pill will be insufficient, and only helpful in the early Core Formation stage.</p><p>The hidden danger of the talisman fragments must be resolved sooner or later.</p><p>To ask someone else to break the talisman would require him to lower his defenses and open his qi sea, essentially putting his life in someone else's hands—something Qin Sang would never consider.</p><p>After much deliberation, before the late Core Formation stage, Qin Sang could only think of two methods.</p><p>Either he would research the Dao of Talismans himself and find a way to break them.</p><p>Or, try a spiritual energy infusion again!</p><p>Qin Sang only knows how to use talismans; she has no foundation in talisman crafting and lacks authentic teachings. She must first find a true lineage and start from scratch.</p><p>This is incredibly difficult.</p><p>Both weapon refinement and talisman crafting require vast resources.</p><p>She had already decided to pursue weapon refinement and also cultivate talisman crafting, but Qin Sang doesn't believe she has the time and energy for both.</p><p>Due to her cultivation method, her cultivation speed has indeed improved, but she can't be reckless.</p><p>At any time, her cultivation base is paramount; Qin Sang won't reverse priorities.</p><p>Insect control is different. Qin Sang has authentic teachings from the Spirit Controlling Sect, has luckily landed in the territory of the Wu tribe, who are masters of insect control, and possesses divine medicines like the Crimson Fire Gilded. This path is much easier than talisman crafting.</p><p>If she could learn from the Wu tribe and cultivate a lifebound insect.</p><p>Then, when the lifebound insect completes its third transformation and draws in spiritual energy, she could store it in her dantian and use it to clear away the prohibition talismans.</p><p>The lifebound insect's transformation and the influx of spiritual energy won't recognize Qin Sang.  It might injure her when it impacts her dantian, but the danger is minimal if controlled properly.</p><p>Choosing the lifebound insect path means giving up a lifebound treasure; one cannot have both.</p><p>However, Qin Sang is different; this choice is not difficult.</p><p>She already has the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Lifebound treasure, lifebound insect – she can have both!</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to meet Cui Xuanzi.</p><p>Now, having obtained the Wu tribe's lifebound insect technique, Qin Sang finds she can totally cultivate it and the numerous benefits solidify her determination to cultivate a lifebound insect.</p><p>The prohibition talisman fragments are merely a minor ailment.</p><p>What worries Qin Sang most is that mass of gray energy.</p><p>She is certain that before Dongyang Bo imposed the prohibition talismans, everything in her dantian was normal.</p><p>This gray energy appeared after she was bound by the prohibition talismans and lost control of her dantian.  Only after Qin Sang formed her golden core and broke the prohibition talismans did she discover the gray energy!</p>
