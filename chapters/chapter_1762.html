<h1>Chapter 1753: Capturing the Demon</h1><p>"That little wench had a real expert secretly following her, likely a high-ranking altar master..." the Beiyao (a type of demon) spoke truthfully, a flash of hatred in its eyes, gnashing its teeth.</p><p>The Jinshe (Golden Snake) revealed a mocking, almost human-like expression. If Daoist officials were so easy to kill, it wouldn't have needed to lie low for so long, relying on others to do its dirty work.</p><p>"Since you failed, why are you here?" the Jinshe's voice was icy, its tone devoid of emotion.</p><p>The Beiyao's expression turned ugly. "I went through all this trouble for you, and now I'm in this mess. Not only did I lose my altar and my wolf general, but if it weren't for my divine abilities allowing me to escape, you wouldn't even be seeing me today... Are you really so heartless?"</p><p>The Jinshe sneered, neither confirming nor denying. Its body began to fade, as if it were about to dissipate on the spot.</p><p>The Beiyao panicked. "Though my cultivation has suffered greatly, it won't be hard to recover. But with my altar taken, I can only beg you to teach me your methods. If you can protect me, I swear to serve you as my king, obeying your every command and being at your beck and call."</p><p>Hearing this, the Jinshe stopped its dissipation and stared at the Beiyao for a long time before speaking in a cold tone, "Six hundred miles northwest of this mountain, there is a cave in a deep ravine."</p><p>Without waiting for the Beiyao's response, it transformed into a pool of water and fell into the pond. No matter how much the Beiyao called out, there was no further response.</p><p>The Beiyao straightened up, its eyes shifting as it wondered what the immortal had planned. Should it follow the snake demon's instructions?</p><p>After waiting for a while and receiving no further orders, it left in frustration.</p><p>After traversing mountains and valleys, the Beiyao found the deep ravine the snake demon had mentioned. The cave was small, but it would serve as a temporary shelter. The Beiyao entered and began to cultivate in earnest, waiting for further instructions.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang had two treasures before him: a seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo and the Dao Manifestation Tree.</p><p>Restoring his true essence would likely depend on the "altar." Obtaining a high-grade altar was no easy task and would take time. For now, it was better to focus on improving his strength.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally thought of a secret technique he had obtained from the Strange-Faced Man: the "Postnatal Wooden Man Stele."</p><p>The seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo had been acquired through a trade with the Green Fox Saint King and was originally intended to be used as a spiritual medium for cultivating the "Postnatal Wooden Man Stele."</p><p>However, with his avatar having perished to save his true self, he now had a better option.</p><p>Recreating an avatar was not something Qin Sang would consider lightly. Back then, he had the foundation of a Nascent Soul puppet refined over many years by the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, allowing him to effortlessly create a Nascent Soul-level external avatar. Now, with the Dao Manifestation Tree reverting to its spiritual wood state, its power had dissipated.</p><p>Cultivation in this realm was difficult, and recreating an avatar would be a monumental task.</p><p>After weighing his options, Qin Sang put away the seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo and kept the Dao Manifestation Tree. The profound mysteries of the "Postnatal Wooden Man Stele" flowed through his mind.</p><p>This technique required spiritual wood as a medium to cultivate an incredibly powerful wooden body.</p><p>As for its power, the Strange-Faced Man had demonstrated it vividly during the battle at the Formless Immortal Sect. Back then, the Strange-Faced Man could draw upon the surrounding wood spirit energy simply by standing on the ground, making the forests and vegetation his endless source of power. Qin Sang had been forced to set the forest ablaze to limit him.</p><p>However, cultivating this technique was no easy feat.</p><p>Such a brutal absorption of external energy would place a tremendous burden on the cultivator if their physical body wasn't strong enough. In severe cases, it could even cause the body to explode.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang had planned to use the seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo as the medium, but he intended to wait until he reached the late fourth layer of the "Heavenly Demon Refinement" before attempting it. Unexpectedly, so many changes had occurred in the meantime.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man wasn't a body cultivator, but the technique he practiced, the "Wood Emperor Strategy," was a top-tier wood-element cultivation method, perfectly suited for this secret technique. It allowed him to utilize the absorbed wood spirit energy effectively. Even so, he had only dared to cultivate this technique after breaking through to the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had taken every opportunity to study this secret technique, and it was now deeply ingrained in his mind.</p><p>The first step in cultivating this technique wasn't external but internal. One had to refine the body's acupoints and maintain them in a special state.</p><p>Then, one had to open spiritual apertures in the chosen spiritual wood medium, ensuring they corresponded perfectly with the cultivator's own acupoints. Only by integrating the spiritual wood into one's body could the wooden body be forged.</p><p>After carefully studying the technique, Qin Sang understood why the Strange-Faced Man had repeatedly targeted external avatars.</p><p>The high-tier wood-element cultivation method he practiced made him highly sensitive to the aura of spiritual wood, but that was only part of the reason.</p><p>That special state also helped the cultivator find the most compatible medium. Once encountered, there would be an instinctive resonance.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man had already intended to refine a wooden body and had begun cultivating the "Postnatal Wooden Man Stele." When he encountered the external avatar, he felt a resonance, though he hadn't realized it was with the avatar's true body.</p><p>In fact, at least within the Storm Realm, it would be difficult to find a more suitable medium than the Dao Manifestation Tree.</p><p>Otherwise, after obtaining this secret technique, Qin Sang wouldn't have hesitated between it and the external avatar.</p><p>The Dao Manifestation Tree was a natural spiritual embryo, capable of allowing a soul to be reborn without losing cultivation. Even an immature Dao Manifestation Tree could be refined into a Nascent Soul puppet or an external avatar, containing countless profound mysteries.</p><p>After creating an external avatar, it would develop meridians and acupoints, just like a human.</p><p>When the second primordial spirit dissipated, the Dao Manifestation Tree reverted to its spiritual wood state, with the acupoints and meridians disappearing, as if all traces had vanished. This was another of its miraculous aspects.</p><p>Thus, opening acupoints in the Dao Manifestation Tree would be far easier than with other spiritual woods, second only to those legendary natural wonders that spontaneously developed divine apertures.</p><p>The medium was ready.</p><p>Qin Sang could refine his own acupoints and open spiritual apertures in the Dao Manifestation Tree simultaneously.</p><p>He patiently cultivated here, allowing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to slowly search for the snake demon's cave.</p><p>While Qin Sang cultivated, the Beiyao spent its days in anxiety.</p><p>As the saying goes, the heavens' will is hard to predict. The more Qin Sang remained inactive, the more uneasy the Beiyao became.</p><p>On a boulder beside the deep ravine, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly perched, waiting quietly for three days and nights. It found no abnormalities in the surroundings, indicating the snake demon's extreme caution.</p><p>Thus, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly flapped its wings and took flight, leaving graceful butterfly shadows across the mountains. Unfortunately, it had hidden itself with its divine abilities, so no one could appreciate its beauty.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly left its mark on every part of the towering mountains, gradually expanding its search radius.</p><p>After wandering for months and traversing countless peaks, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly finally returned to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>"Nine suspected lairs?"</p><p>Sensing the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's thoughts, Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly had ultimately found nine locations, each with a faint aura, suspected to be the snake demon's lairs.</p><p>Uncertain of the snake demon's methods and to avoid alerting it, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly hadn't ventured into the suspected lairs. From the outside, it was impossible to determine which one was real.</p><p>It was even possible that all nine were decoys.</p><p>The snake demon had left the Beiyao hanging, and it was unclear when it would reappear.</p><p>After some deliberation, Qin Sang decided not to wait any longer and to act directly.</p><p>Since demon altars existed in this world, the snake demon couldn't be the only one. There was no need to waste time here.</p><p>Even if this attempt failed and the target escaped, it would still provide insight into the methods of demon cultivators with altars, allowing him to pursue other targets.</p><p>If he attracted powerful demon cultivators, he could simply retreat to the Daoist Court.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly ventured out, delving deep into the wilderness to carefully survey the area. They eventually settled on a plan and leisurely flew toward one of the suspected lairs.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang held a spirit stone, gradually replenishing his true essence.</p><p>This lair, like the Beiyao's, was hidden at the bottom of a mountain stream between two peaks.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his aura and quietly landed on the eastern peak. After observing for a moment, he sent a thought to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly flapped its wings and flew into the distance.</p><p>In truth, he had two other helpers: the Fire Jade Centipede and the demonic soul of Su Zinan within the Three Corpses Death God Banner.</p><p>His external avatar hadn't had time to release the demon banner, so the treasure had been preserved.</p><p>However, the Fire Jade Centipede couldn't conceal itself and wasn't skilled in combat, while the demonic soul couldn't stray too far from him. This time, only the Heavenly Eye Butterfly could assist him.</p><p>Watching the Heavenly Eye Butterfly fly away, Qin Sang silently counted the time. With a flip of his hand, the Sun God Tree appeared in his palm, and his figure flickered, appearing above the mountain stream.</p><p>Looking down, Qin Sang's mind stirred, and three divine birds immediately took flight, streaking like arrows into the stream.</p><p>'Sizzle...'</p><p>As soon as the divine birds touched the water, they stirred up a massive mist, instantly drying up the entire stream with the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>Immediately after, a deafening roar came from the depths of the mist, and crimson flames shot into the sky. The two peaks on either side shook, and one seemed to have its foundation severed, tilting outward.</p><p>Rocks flew in all directions, and the mountain demons were terrified.</p><p>This realm was indeed teeming with demons and spirits. From the surrounding mountains, wisps of demonic and strange mists rose, filling the sky as they fled in panic.</p><p>For the first time since arriving in this realm, the Sun God Birds displayed their might, shaking heaven and earth!</p><p>How could the protective measures the snake demon had set up in its lair withstand three Sun God Birds?</p><p>The entrance to the lair and the rocks at the bottom of the stream were instantly obliterated by the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't restrained the power of the Nanming Li Fire, intending to capture the demon alive, a single strike would have leveled the lair.</p><p>Inside the lair.</p><p>A Jinshe with a human head and snake body coiled its lower half, deep in cultivation.</p><p>Surprisingly, the lair was elegantly furnished, with red candles, incense, and gauze curtains. The snake demon rested on a silk-covered bed, making it seem more like a noble lady's boudoir than a demon's lair.</p><p>The snake demon's appearance was also quite striking, though its features were too androgynous to determine its gender.</p><p>A calamity had descended from the heavens!</p><p>The lair's entrance was instantly breached, and a torrent of fiery energy surged in, instantly incinerating the curtains and tables.</p><p>Only then did the snake demon jolt awake, its eyes opening to an unbelievable sight: the stone door of its lair had vanished, and a wave of crimson fire was rolling in, exuding a world-destroying aura. Its eyes were filled with terror.</p><p>At the same time, in the other eight lairs, identical snake demons with the same appearance and furnishings also opened their eyes, their expressions mirroring the first.</p><p>The snake demon's face was filled with fear, and its body suddenly erupted with a seven-colored demonic light, its skin taking on a crystalline sheen, as if carved from jade.</p><p>But before its next thought could form, a "hum" and a "ha" sounded in its ears, and its entire body stiffened, its eyes filled with confusion.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang appeared beside the snake demon, reaching out to seize it. His hand encountered a strange, soft texture.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a layer of snake skin, with a force stirring within, eager to return to its source.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang acted faster. The Sun God Birds had breached the lair, and he immediately used a soul-shocking incantation to subdue the demon.</p><p>Even with his limited divine sense, the snake demon was no match. In an instant, it was captured.</p><p>Not finding the true body, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. He immediately had an idea: use this force to track the snake demon.</p><p>This force must have been split from the snake demon's body, maintaining a subtle connection.</p><p>However, just as he was about to sense the connection, it vanished. Clearly, the snake demon had realized something was wrong and had severed the link.</p><p>"Quite decisive!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. In that brief moment, he had already sensed the general direction. How could he let it escape?</p><p>Looking southwest, Qin Sang's back flickered with lightning, and wings appeared. With a thunderous roar, Qin Sang vanished, leaving only a streak of lightning.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The thunder echoed through the mountains, and countless demons and spirits looked on in terror.</p><p>A bolt of lightning streaked across the sky.</p><p>Ahead of the lightning's path, the snake demon suddenly turned its head.</p><p>In the next moment, the same scene repeated. The seven-colored demonic light flared, and a force vanished into thin air, leaving behind a snake skin that crumpled to the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't stop it in time, but he had already secured a complete snake skin. He could roughly discern the mysteries of the snake demon's divine ability and the direction the seven-colored demonic light had returned to.</p><p>"Let's see how many times you can switch..."</p><p>Qin Sang casually summoned a heavenly thunderbolt to reduce the snake skin on the ground to ashes. His escape light shifted, and he shot off in another direction.</p><p>High in the sky, the lightning zigzagged, causing demons to prostrate and spirits to flee.</p><p>Qin Sang soon spotted his next target, which also transformed into a snake skin before his eyes.</p><p>However, this time he couldn't sense where the demonic light had returned to. He quickly realized the reason: the snake demon, sensing danger, had decisively dispersed the demonic light rather than recalling it.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell that these snake skins weren't mere decoys. The demonic light within them was split from the true body, and each time one was lost, the snake demon's cultivation would diminish.</p><p>This was indeed the case.</p><p>This was the snake demon's unique divine ability. By refining its shed skins, it could split itself into demonic light, each merging with a shed skin, making its aura indistinguishable from its true body.</p><p>Moreover, it could maintain this split state while cultivating. If danger arose, it could recall all the demonic light to any shed skin, restoring its true body.</p><p>Even if some demonic light couldn't escape in time, it could be abandoned without hesitation. As long as one demonic light escaped, it could slowly recover later.</p><p>Now, it had accumulated nine shed skins, setting up nine decoy lairs, confident in its invincibility.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the profundity of this divine ability and realized he might fail today. Just as he was about to randomly choose a direction to pursue, his expression shifted, and he smiled, flying north.</p><p>Soon, he arrived at a valley where the Heavenly Eye Butterfly flew up to greet him. On the ground lay a charred python, no longer resembling the Jinshe.</p><p>Earlier, while investigating the nine suspected lairs, Qin Sang had noticed one that was particularly well-hidden. If not for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's divine abilities, it would have been easy to overlook. He guessed this might be the snake demon's carefully prepared lair and had the Heavenly Eye Butterfly keep watch.</p><p>Thinking it had lured the enemy away, the snake demon hurriedly recalled the remaining demonic light to this location to escape. Just as it revealed its true body, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly struck it unconscious.</p><p>Scooping up the demonic snake, Qin Sang continued his flight toward the Daoist Court, not forgetting to take the Beiyao along.</p><p>Returning to the Daoist Court's territory in one breath, Qin Sang sensed his own condition and sighed inwardly. He needed to stabilize his vital energy as soon as possible, or the restrictions would be too great.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
