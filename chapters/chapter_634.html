Chapter 626: The Decision

Thus, this person, existing in the body of a Gu worm, possessed the power of a Nascent Soul cultivator!

Qin Sang found the tale recorded in the jade slip incredibly bizarre.  It was comparable to Wu Shang, who willingly refined himself into a living corpse in his pursuit of Core Formation.

The difference was that Wu Shang failed.

While the rumored cultivator, surnamed Fang, succeeded, merging with his natal Gu and becoming a worm.

The rumor wasn't ancient. If this person truly existed, they might still be alive.

Qin Sang, consumed by curiosity, resolved to inquire about this extraordinary individual after leaving the Western Frontier.

Natal Gu offered numerous advantages. Not only could they aid in breaking through cultivation bottlenecks, but if they evolved alongside their master's cultivation, their power could surpass even natal magic treasures.  In combat, they acted independently, effectively doubling the master's fighting force.

Not to mention the many unique talents and divine abilities possessed by various spirit insects.

Of course, all of this hinged on the natal Gu's ability to evolve and keep pace with its master.

Gu evolution was incredibly difficult, even more so than a cultivator's breakthrough.

Refining a spirit insect into a natal Gu allowed for nurturing it with blood essence and specialized Gu control techniques, but evolution remained a formidable challenge.

Much like human cultivators after reaching Core Formation, many could only rely on talisman treasures while spending decades, even centuries, searching for spirit materials to refine their natal magic treasures.

Similarly, many witch cultivators found their natal Gu stuck at the second transformation after reaching Core Formation. They, too, had to exhaust all means to seek out spirit objects and elixirs to aid their Gu's evolution.

Finding a suitable natal Gu and knowing the precise resources for its evolution could significantly ease this process.

This was the core of the Gu control techniques of the major witch clans.

The criteria for the Witch Gu Ranking were also related to these factors.

A spirit insect's bloodline potential was only one aspect.

The Witch Gu Ranking, compiled by the witch cultivators, served as a reference for most of their kind.  The higher-ranked insects were not necessarily those with the highest potential.

The potential to reach the second transformation was a prerequisite for inclusion on the list.

Potential for a third transformation was ideal, while anything beyond that had diminishing significance.

Furthermore,

The insect's combat prowess in its first three transformations, as well as the ease of its second and third transformations, especially the third, were paramount.

These factors determined an insect's ranking on the Witch Gu Ranking.

Rare insects with the potential for fifth, sixth, or even higher transformations were regarded as extraordinary insects by the Spirit Control Sect but ranked low on the Witch Gu Ranking.

Firstly, they were weak in the early stages, with unremarkable divine abilities and limited combat effectiveness.

Secondly, their transformations were exceptionally difficult, requiring rare spirit medicines.

Using such insects as natal Gu would only hinder a cultivator's progress.

Ghost Head Wasps weren't individually powerful in their first transformation.  Their fearsome reputation stemmed from their swarming tactics.

However, their combat prowess increased dramatically after the second and third transformations.  This, despite their challenging evolution, earned them a ranking of around 500.

Of course, a ranking on the Witch Gu Ranking was one thing; finding the insect was another.

Qin Sang retrieved both the Witch Gu Ranking and the Extraordinary Insect List.

He believed that before reaching Core Formation, choosing a natal Gu based on the Witch Gu Ranking was sound advice.  However, having already formed his core, he felt it best to consult the Extraordinary Insect List as well, considering both an insect's potential and future prospects.

This highlighted the value of the Extraordinary Insect List. It detailed the transformation methods of several extraordinary insects, even up to the fourth and fifth transformations. The only obstacle was the scarcity of the required resources.

The Witch Gu Ranking he possessed was a common, widely circulated version.

Five of the insects listed were central to the Five Insects Sect's unique Gu control techniques, the core of their true inheritance. Cui Xuanzi had only shared this knowledge after Qin Sang swore an oath of secrecy.

Other major factions undoubtedly possessed similar secret techniques, guarded closely.

He wondered if the Gu control techniques of those powerful witch clans were more comprehensive and detailed than his Extraordinary Insect List.

Gu control was a complex art, and it took Qin Sang considerable time to peruse the entire text.

After absorbing its contents, Qin Sang resolved to select a suitable spirit insect and refine it into his natal Gu, replacing a natal magic treasure.

There were several reasons for this.

Human cultivators avoided this path for fear of backlash from their natal Gu.  Qin Sang, possessing the Jade Buddha, could perfectly mitigate this risk.

He even had an advantage over the witch cultivators in this regard.

He could fearlessly push his natal Gu to its fourth transformation.

At the Pseudo Core Formation stage, he had easily controlled the Flying Night Devil. Yi Tiannie, despite his meticulous efforts, couldn't erase Qin Sang's soul imprint, a testament to the Jade Buddha's power.

The prospect of a natal Gu aiding in breaking through cultivation bottlenecks deeply enticed Qin Sang.

Reflecting on his past, Qin Sang could foresee the immense difficulty of reaching Nascent Soul.

He was uncertain whether a single Pill of Tribulation Transcendence would suffice.

He would seize every opportunity, no matter how small.  Even without the Jade Buddha, he would have explored every avenue to refine a natal Gu.

Since he didn't need to worry about the consequences, he couldn't afford to miss this chance.

Furthermore, the knowledge gleaned from the Spirit Control Sect's ancient texts, particularly the Gu control techniques unknown to the witch clans, along with the Redfire Gilded Gold in his possession, bolstered his confidence in this path.

The Redgold Vine absorbed metallic spiritual fire energy, producing fruit which was essentially unrefined Redfire Gilded Gold.

It was typically used for refining tools.

However, a past Spirit Control Sect elder had discovered an ancient beast-taming manual in a cultivator's ruins.

It revealed that the Redgold Vine's fruit, if its pulp was extracted without smelting and fed to a spirit insect, had a chance of triggering its evolution!

Qin Sang had witnessed this firsthand in the ancient cultivator's ruins when Elder Di Que fed Redfire Gilded Gold to the Fire Jade Centipedes, inducing immediate signs of transformation.

Since acquiring the Redfire Gilded Gold, Qin Sang had been preoccupied with cultivating and repairing his foundation, neglecting Gu control.

His fortunate encounter with the Ghost Head Wasps was an anomaly, as they were mutated and incapable of further growth or transformation.

This left the Redfire Gilded Gold languishing unused in his storage pouch, a wasted treasure.

Finally, the Redfire Gilded Gold had a purpose.

Although Qin Sang possessed only a single Redgold Vine fruit, a cultivator could only have one natal Gu.  It should be enough to support his natal Gu through its third transformation, with some to spare.

Qin Sang held high hopes of nurturing a third transformation natal Gu.  He could then spend a few centuries gathering resources for its fourth transformation, a more focused approach than aimless cultivation.

With his improved aptitude, thanks to the Slaughter Talisman, his cultivation speed was now above average, allowing him to pursue this additional path.

However, these were not the primary reasons that drove Qin Sang to choose the path of the natal Gu.
