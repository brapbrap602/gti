<h1>Chapter 1292: Old Acquaintance</h1><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, a wave of old memories washing over her.</p><p>Cang Qing and Jing Yu stopped as well.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's gaze, Cang Qing saw a Jindan cultivator from Little Cold Region fiercely battling an opponent with a treasured blade, a flicker of recognition in his eyes.</p><p>"Do you know him, Daoist friend?"</p><p>Qin Sang turned, keenly noticing the change in Cang Qing's expression.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, do you have some connection with this young man?"</p><p>Cang Qing was surprised.  "I have some impression of him. His swordsmanship is quite good, relatively well-known among independent cultivators.  The esteemed Lord Huangfu of the Yinlu Sect saw his talent and wanted to recruit him, but the young man was rather stubborn, saying the Sect's teachings were completely different from his path. Fortunately, Lord Huangfu valued his talent and didn't force him."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, remembering the Lord Huangfu Cang Qing mentioned—the current sect master of the Yinlu Sect, one of the most likely among the Jindan cultivators of this generation to break through to Yuan Ying. It was said even Gongliang Yu's cultivation was inferior to his.</p><p>The Yinlu Sect was both righteous and evil, considering themselves unorthodox. They once gathered a force comparable to the combined power of righteous and demonic sects, forming a three-way standoff.</p><p>Later, they declined, but have shown signs of resurgence in recent years, with the current sect master having close ties to the demonic path. All Yinlu Sect cultivators were blade masters, inheriting two major traditions: the "Yinlu Blade" and the "Cicada Wing Sword Technique."</p><p>"Still an independent cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked down, musing for a moment.  "The two of you go ahead; I'll follow shortly."</p><p>…</p><p>On the battlefield, both sides were locked in a bloody battle.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>With a slash, a fiery red spear was cleaved in two. Shangguan Lifeng gasped for breath, his gaze sweeping around him, his heart sinking.</p><p>The main force of the Zuoyuan army shouldn't be here. It was as if they descended from the heavens.</p><p>The Two Regions Alliance hadn't expected the seemingly defeated Zuoyuan forces to ambush them here. They had walked straight into the enemy's trap, their formation shattered in the ensuing battle, forcing them to fight individually.</p><p>Though their overall strength surpassed Zuoyuan's, the situation was extremely unfavorable.</p><p>In the distance, dark clouds gathered in the sky, rain of thunder and fire falling, a breathtaking spectacle.</p><p>That was where the Yuan Ying masters were fighting.</p><p>The Yuan Ying ancestors of both sides were locked in a fierce battle, their figures hidden from view, the outcome uncertain.</p><p>"Zuoyuan is prepared and waiting, having set their trap in advance.  Our Yuan Ying ancestor will likely struggle to win quickly. If this continues, defeat is inevitable.  Securing a retreat should be our priority…"</p><p>The thought had barely crossed Shangguan Lifeng's mind when a sharp pain pierced his brow, the enemy's fiery red spear attacking again.</p><p>He quickly pushed the thought aside, forming a sword seal. His treasured blade hummed, and a terrifying blood-killing aura erupted!</p><p>His opponent, a young man in red robes, felt his spirit tremble under the impact of the blood-killing aura, a wave of fear washing over him.  Horrified, he quickly steadied his mind.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The treasured blade deflected the fiery red spear once more.</p><p>Simultaneously, faint ripples suddenly appeared in the void behind Shangguan Lifeng. A tiny, transparent sword, no thicker than a finger, appeared silently, then swiftly lunged toward him.</p><p>Someone was attacking him during the battle.</p><p>In this critical moment, Shangguan Lifeng's expression remained unchanged. Ignoring the hidden sword, he suddenly lunged towards his blade, gripping the hilt tightly, and charged at his opponent.</p><p>Man and blade as one!</p><p>In that instant, Shangguan Lifeng and his blade vanished, replaced by a crimson blade energy, tens of meters long, fast as lightning, appearing above the red-robed youth's head in an instant, about to deliver a fatal blow.</p><p>Those around them noticed the disturbance, their eyes widening in surprise.</p><p>"Save me!"</p><p>The red-robed youth's face was ashen, his scream piercing the air.</p><p>The cultivator secretly controlling the hidden sword cursed inwardly at the madman. Shangguan Lifeng was completely ignoring the hidden sword, clearly fighting to the death. Even if he killed this man, the red-robed youth would also die.</p><p>He couldn't just watch his comrade die, so he had to appear to save him.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The blade energy was stopped.</p><p>The red-robed youth, having narrowly escaped death, was both frightened and furious, roaring as he and his companion attacked Shangguan Lifeng.  Shangguan Lifeng, abandoning his earlier aggressive stance, fought and retreated, but facing two opponents, he was beginning to falter.</p><p>At that moment, unnoticed by all three, a sword shadow appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Only then did they realize the surrounding space had inexplicably darkened, and their opponent had vanished. They seemed to have been pulled into an unknown space.</p><p>A strange sight made Shangguan Lifeng's heart pound. He quickly sheathed his blade for protection, but oddly felt nothing amiss.</p><p>Then, he heard two screams. The darkness receded like a tide, and his vision returned.</p><p>To his horror, he found his two opponents lying dead.  Their bodies and magical artifacts were undamaged, showing no external wounds, yet they were lifeless, two corpses.</p><p>This ghostly method made Shangguan Lifeng gasp.</p><p>Their eyes were wide open, staring blankly at the sky, further chilling him to the bone.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The ebony sword flew back as a streak of light.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng hesitated for a moment, then followed the sword. He saw it fly towards a person and embed itself in their body.</p><p>"Junior Shangguan Lifeng thanks the senior for their assistance!"</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng quickly bowed respectfully, his head lowered, not daring to look closely.</p><p>A soft sigh echoed.</p><p>"Brother Shangguan, don't you remember an old friend?"</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng, lost in thought about why this Yuan Ying cultivator would save him, was startled. He looked up sharply, his expression uncertain. "Senior...?"</p><p>"This humble cultivator is Qingfeng.  Brother Daoist, how have you been?" Qin Sang said with a smile.</p><p>This person was a fellow cultivator he had met two hundred years ago while traveling with Yun Youzi to search for herbs. They had fought side-by-side. This was their first reunion since then.</p><p>Yun Youzi had spoken highly of Shangguan Lifeng back then.  His judgment of people was impeccable.  Indeed, Shangguan Lifeng was now a Golden Core cultivator, albeit at the early stage. For a solitary cultivator, this was quite an achievement.</p><p>Even more remarkable was Shangguan Lifeng's blade technique, which reminded Qin Sang of the killing style found in the "Chapter on Nurturing the Sword Spirit."</p><p>Before their parting two hundred years ago, Shangguan Lifeng had given up a thousand-year-old medicinal herb to request Qin Sang demonstrate his swordsmanship.  He had actually managed to gain insights, and now his style was quite impressive.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng!"</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng exclaimed in disbelief, his face a mixture of shock and wonder.</p><p>He could never forget that demonstration of swordsmanship; it profoundly influenced his path.</p><p>Two hundred years ago, both had been Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng had diligently cultivated, relentlessly pursuing his path, finally achieving Golden Core cultivation after more than two hundred years. With his exceptional blade skills, he was a formidable opponent among his peers, making a name for himself.</p><p>Now, they met again. His old friend was a Yuan Ying cultivator!</p><p>A Yuan Ying master under three hundred years old!</p>
