<h1>Chapter 1926: The Path</h1><p>“What is a Ghost Cloud Steed?”</p><p>Zhu Que heard of this type of demonic beast for the first time. Remembering that Luo Hou was still in spirit form, she suddenly understood.  “You want to perform a body snatching?”</p><p>Luo Hou had been injured badly by Qin Sang years ago and hadn’t found a suitable body since. She was unwilling to compromise, so she waited until now.</p><p>Luo Hou neither confirmed nor denied it, replying, “The Ghost Cloud Steed’s bloodline has a certain degree of compatibility with my own race.”</p><p>If she were to perform a body snatching, she didn’t have to limit herself to the Shadow Horse clan; she could choose a similar bloodline as a vessel.</p><p>Luo Hou had several options; the Ghost Cloud Steed was one of them.</p><p>Luo Hou’s expression showed some hesitation. Firstly, this Ghost Cloud Steed’s bloodline was weak; secondly, it wasn’t the best choice, only mediocre at best.</p><p>However, the demonic beasts Luo Hou chose, including the Ghost Cloud Steed, were all extremely rare. It had taken a long time to encounter one.</p><p>Deep within the Mu Luo Mountains, there might be better options.  She considered herself lucky to have survived as a defeated general and become a mountain guardian spirit beast. How could she dare ask her master to make a special trip to find her a body?</p><p>Furthermore, the situation in the Mu Luo Mountains was complex, with numerous Nascent Soul stage powerhouses; it was fraught with danger.</p><p>With only her spirit essence remaining, her strength was impaired. While she could easily deal with a demonic cultivator of the Purple Gold Divine Eagle’s level, she would be at a disadvantage against those of her own rank. She dared not venture into the Mu Luo Mountains alone.</p><p>Encountering a Ghost Cloud Steed was a small stroke of luck.</p><p>While body snatching the Ghost Cloud Steed wouldn't be as compatible as other demonic beasts, it still offered a chance to restore her to her peak strength, though it would require more effort.</p><p>If she missed this opportunity, she didn't know when the next one would come.  Lacking a physical body had a significant impact on her cultivation; the sooner she performed the body snatching, the better.</p><p>“Then what are we waiting for? Go, go, go!”</p><p>Zhu Que urged repeatedly, clamoring, “I'll deal with this thing!  It dares to call itself a Demon Emperor in front of this divine bird? Let it learn a lesson from this divine bird!”</p><p>Zhu Que rubbed her claws together, her tone arrogant.</p><p>However, Luo Hou didn’t move, hesitating, “But, Master…”</p><p>“Why are you worried about that? Do you think Qin will stop you from performing the body snatching?  He brought you down the mountain to help you recover; otherwise, why didn't he bring that fox?”</p><p>Zhu Que, a bit clever, rolled her eyes and guessed Luo Hou's concerns, suddenly cackling with laughter.</p><p>“Cackle…cackle… Do you really believe him?  He claimed he wouldn’t kill, but isn’t that to help Xiao Wu dispel his demonic intent?  He didn't specifically tell us to show mercy when we came. Do you think Qin is an inflexible pedant, or do you really see your master as a great benevolent person?”</p><p>“Cackle, cackle, cackle…”</p><p>Zhu Que seemed to have heard the greatest joke and laughed until her sides ached.</p><p>Following Qin Sang on his travels, she had learned many new words, such as "pedant.”</p><p>Her laughter reached the ears of the Purple Gold Divine Eagle, igniting his fury.</p><p>The opponent was pursuing him, yet daring to engage in conversation and unrestrained laughter—a great humiliation.</p><p>Luo Hou remained hesitant. Since Qin Sang descended the mountain, he had been slaying demonic beasts along the way, creating a river of blood. Body snatching was undoubtedly the act of a demon, even though the Ghost Cloud Steed had surely killed many mortals.</p><p>She was not Zhu Que; she didn't have the privilege to disregard Qin Sang’s words.</p><p>“Oh, my, you're such a coward!  Can you do it or not? Just ask Qin!  Hurry and capture that Ghost Steed before it escapes!”</p><p>Zhu Que flapped her wings, condensing a flame feather into a crimson streak of light that pierced the air.</p><p>Luo Hou left the Purple Gold Divine Eagle to Zhu Que, leaping towards the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Zhu Que shook her wings, glancing sideways at the enraged Purple Gold Divine Eagle, and let out a cackling laugh.</p><p>“You are doomed!”</p><p>Zhu Que had learned a more elegant word from the mortal world and roared, her whole body ablaze with raging flames, charging towards the Purple Gold Divine Eagle.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>The Purple Gold Divine Eagle was not one to be outdone verbally, but he didn’t turn around.  Nevertheless, he was easily overtaken by Zhu Que. As soon as they clashed, he realized something was amiss.</p><p>Zhu Que seemed to only possess the cultivation of a late Nascent Soul stage, similar to the Purple Gold Divine Eagle, but she absolutely couldn’t be treated as an ordinary demonic beast.</p><p>Furthermore, the Demon Emperor had just suffered a blow from Luo Hou and was already injured.  Soon, he fell into a disadvantage, swallowed by the overwhelming flames.</p><p>The palace was breached; the Demon Emperor was preoccupied with his own survival.</p><p>Other demonic beasts, each acting independently, were like a disorganized mob. They couldn't mount a proper attack and retreated steadily, escape itself a luxury they couldn't afford.</p><p>Luo Hou, capturing the Ghost Cloud Steed, moved like a phantom, clearing the battlefield.  The demonic horde could only surrender.</p><p>Above the capital city, Zhu Que and the Demon Emperor battled.</p><p>"No one is to interfere!"</p><p>Zhu Que's roar echoed through the flames.  This was a rare opportunity, and she intended to make the most of it.</p><p>"Senior Luo, what should we do now?"</p><p>A cultivator approached.</p><p>Luo Hou observed for a moment, confirming that the Golden-winged Roc couldn't escape.  "Let the Divine Sparrow have its fun," she said, "We'll reinforce elsewhere! Let's go!"</p><p>"Fun?"</p><p>Everyone looked at each other, dumbfounded.  To simply be playing with a late-stage transformed demon was unbelievable!</p><p>With reinforcements arriving, the other two battlefields fell just as swiftly.</p><p>Three demonic lairs were destroyed overnight!</p><p>Finally, everyone rushed towards the capital of Wanling Kingdom. The battle wasn't over, but the Golden-winged Roc was already at its wit's end.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A fiery blast slammed into the ground, like a meteorite, destroying half the palace in a earth-shattering explosion!</p><p>When the flames cleared…</p><p>Everyone saw a small Zhu Que, one foot planted on the head of the Golden-winged Roc, a creature many times its size.</p><p>Zhu Que preened her feathers and surveyed the scene with pride.  Amidst the praise, her little head rose higher and higher, her beak almost touching the sky.</p><p>Su Xuan and others cleaned up the mess. The three demons, their task complete, vanished without a trace.</p><p>Zhu Que stopped Luo Hou, shaking a fiery feather. "Your master has agreed.  Don't delay your body possession. What are you waiting for?"</p><p>"Please protect me while I perform this ritual."</p><p>Luo Hou didn't question the truth, making an immediate decision. She descended with the Ghost Cloud Steed to a mountaintop.  Zhu Que and Taiyi guarded her, one on each side.</p><p>...</p><p>Noon the next day.</p><p>The three demons returned to Taiyi's cave.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was studying the Taiyi Thunderbolt Talisman, was surprised to see Luo Hou. "You found a new body yourself? I was planning to go to Mu Luo Mountain anyway, so this saves me trouble. Take these pills.  Adapt to your new body and restore your strength quickly."</p><p>He tossed over a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside were three extremely valuable pills, obtained from the remains of a demon king, specifically crafted for demon cultivation, and highly beneficial to Luo Hou.</p><p>Luo Hou realized that Qin Sang had not forgotten her, and immediately knelt, bowing her head in gratitude. "Thank you, Master, for your gift."</p><p>"See? I told you he'd agree, but you insisted on asking…"</p><p>Zhu Que hopped onto Luo Hou's shoulder, smugly.</p><p>"Asking?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Zhu Que.</p><p>Zhu Que quickly covered her mouth, her eyes darting around. She turned and dashed for the exit, but a powerful force yanked her back, causing her to scream.</p><p>"Luo Hou needs to focus on refining her body and can no longer serve as a mount. You'll take her place."</p><p>Ignoring the screams, Qin Sang raised a finger, causing Zhu Que's flames to surge.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Luo Hou opened her mouth to speak, but Qin Sang's gaze silenced her.</p><p>Soon, a large red-feathered bird soared from the mountain, carrying everyone into the sky, leaving behind heart-wrenching cries.</p><p>"Ah! I, the glorious Zhu Que!"</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain, Daoist Grounds.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body awoke from meditation and calculated with his fingers, murmuring, "It's almost time for my appointment with the City Lord of Yun Ding City."</p><p>Restoring his foundation was no longer a problem. Qin Sang had to consider his next steps in cultivation.</p><p>Understanding the Dao of Killing wasn't something he could rush.  Seeking the Dao, the most crucial thing was insight and comprehension.  Enlightenment is precisely that.</p><p>His main body wouldn't perform better than his incarnation.</p><p>Leaving it to his incarnation to continue traveling the world and searching for opportunities was probably the best choice.</p><p>What Qin Sang's main body needed to do was quickly achieve strength comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Many of his previous abilities and treasures were insufficient, especially at the Nascent Soul level.</p><p>His three supremely powerful Buddha Seals, his most important techniques before the Nascent Soul stage, were now limited by his physical strength.</p><p>Comprehending thunder techniques would be difficult to achieve in a short time, unless the Thunder Altar could bring a surprise.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>One was to quickly increase his physical strength, breaking through the sixth level of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>The other was to understand the Seven Mansions Starfield Sword Formation, using the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* and Tianyue's sword light to deduce the Sword Domain.</p><p>Even a slight grasp of sword domain essence would give him a significant advantage against a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>A breakthrough in swordsmanship would undoubtedly lead to a massive leap in strength, but the difficulty would be immense.</p><p>For over three hundred years, Qin Sang had pondered his approach.</p><p>Gradually, he formulated a plan, though it remained untested.</p><p>The words of Tianyue Ren were a subtle guidance.</p><p>Using a sword array to simulate the celestial bodies was a daunting task; Qin Sang knew he wasn't ready for such ambition.</p><p>Creating a celestial body sword array required a gradual approach. He planned to emulate the Seven Mansions Sword Array, starting with the Southern, Eastern, and Northern Seven Mansions.</p><p>Once the four images were complete, he would achieve the Four Images Sword Array!</p><p>This would mark a minor accomplishment.  Subsequently, he would incorporate the Sun, Moon, and Nine Luminaries, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, the Great Brightness Enclosure, and the Heavenly Market Enclosure, ultimately culminating in the complete Celestial Body Sword Array.</p><p>It was an ambitious plan, and Qin Sang wasn't sure if he could complete it within his Nascent Soul cultivation stage.</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang's mind – memories from the Divine Court.</p><p>The scenes of being pursued by a demon king in the Western White Tiger star region.</p><p>And the time when the Thunder Ancestor possessed him, granting him control over heaven and earth, allowing him to command both the Divine Court and the realms.</p><p>This deeply ingrained memory seemed to include some impressions of the Divine Court, the four directions, and the Three Enclosures and Twenty-Eight Mansions.</p><p>His consciousness had been clouded then, and subsequent attacks left only faint memories.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure how much he could glean, but if he could grasp any essence from it, utilizing the Divine Court's aura to construct his sword array would be incredibly efficient!</p><p>This was undoubtedly a shortcut compared to directly observing the ethereal celestial bodies.</p><p>Of course, breakthroughs in the *Demon Refining Scripture* would grant him formidable power through the Three Buddha Seals.</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped his knees.</p><p>He had previously requested the Lord of Yun Ding City to collect potent poisons for him, and it was almost time to collect them.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture* was secondary, he mused. His focus should be on comprehending the Dharma Image, achieving deeper understanding to prepare for future breakthroughs.</p><p>Different paths may lead to the same destination. As a Nascent Soul cultivator, his understanding of the harmony between man and nature would benefit his Dharma Image comprehension.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gust of wind swept through the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Dharma Image.</p><p>He looked up at the Azure Bird Dharma Image, carefully sensing it.</p><p>Previously, guided by Left Zhenren, he had learned about the concepts of inner and outer scenes in physical cultivation, yet the understanding remained vague.</p><p>Now, he grasped the true meaning.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, manipulating heaven and earth’s energy is about control.</p><p>The transition from inner to outer scene in physical cultivation is also about harmony with nature, but it focuses on incorporating heaven and earth into oneself, oneself being the center.</p><p>It's like absorbing the power of heaven and earth to nourish oneself, forming one's own inner world, influencing the real world in turn.</p><p>And what about the Yang God?</p><p>Is it about using heaven and earth as roots, with the soul actively merging with them?</p><p>The most extreme path: relinquishing the self, merging with heaven and earth, becoming one with them?</p><p>This has similarities to those whose power is rooted in mountain ranges or sustained by incense offerings.</p><p>This thought led Qin Sang to recall the Yang God that attacked him in the Divine Court, its movements like a phantom, its approach imperceptible.</p><p>Do these three paths represent the three ultimate paths of cultivation for beings, with countless branches and variations arising from them?</p><p>These were the fruits of Qin Sang's continuous contemplation.</p><p>He knew there were errors, but that was alright.  With further cultivation, he would gradually refine his understanding, discovering the true nature of the Dao.</p><p>This process, a journey of seeking the Dao, was also his own transformation and elevation!</p><p>"Dao! Dao! Dao!"</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the word endlessly.</p><p>In fact, the higher the realm, the more important the Dao becomes, while the influence of innate talent diminishes.</p><p>At the Nascent Soul stage, who would care about whether one had five spiritual roots?</p><p>Of course, the speed of comprehending the Dao is also a form of talent.</p><p>Some attain enlightenment instantly, while others struggle for a lifetime.</p><p>"This is intuition, perhaps? But the level of intuition doesn't determine future achievements; it can be compensated for by external means, obtaining guidance."</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Azure Bird Dharma Image.</p><p>The Dharma Image is an external manifestation of inner world power. With his Nascent Soul understanding, his comprehension of the Dharma Image’s essence surpasses that of ordinary people.</p><p>Qin Sang silently cultivated the *Demon Refining Scripture*.</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>The cave entrance opened, Qin Sang emerged, refreshed. He instructed Gui Hou to guard the home and flew out of the training grounds.</p><p>He calmly flew across the Fire Region, arriving at Yun Du Mountain, observing the changes below.</p><p>Over two hundred years, Yun Du Mountain appeared unchanged, at least on the surface, it was remarkably peaceful.</p><p>Under the rule of Yun Du Tian, Yun Du Mountain enjoyed long-lasting peace and prosperity, a blessing for cultivators.</p><p>Yun Ding City.</p><p>Qin Sang visited the immortal city only every few decades, yet every guard knew his name.</p><p>Upon entering, he was escorted by the guard captain directly to the highest level of Yun Ding City.</p><p>The city lord personally greeted him.</p>
