<h1>Chapter 1546: An Honor</h1><p>Chapter 1546: An Honor</p><p>Master Mo, bewildered by Daoist Luo Rong's expression, felt increasingly uneasy, even experiencing the urge to flee.</p><p>The palanquin arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>A look of apprehension flashed in Daoist Luo Rong's eyes; secretly, he crushed a ring on his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, bowed slightly, and said, “This must be Daoist Luo Rong of the Six Emptiness Sect? My Daoist name is Qingfeng. I've long admired your reputation!”</p><p>“My Daoist name is indeed Luo Rong. I consider myself widely connected, and have many dealings with fellow Daoists. I don't believe we've met before, Daoist Qingfeng. May I ask where you hail from?”</p><p>Luo Rong's expression returned to normal, a strained smile on his lips.</p><p>“I'm a wandering recluse, an insignificant person. It's quite understandable that you wouldn't recognize me,” Qin Sang gestured towards the main hall, “Please.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s evasiveness and unwillingness to reveal his origins,</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong's face darkened, his tone turning cold, “No need! Master Mo has already explained the situation. I understand your intentions. Let's get down to business.”</p><p>A commotion arose among the crowd.</p><p>The Xie family members stood behind Qin Sang.</p><p>The Six Emptiness Sect disciples brought by Daoist Luo Rong and Master Mo landed on the ground.</p><p>The two sides were clearly separated.</p><p>Master Mo looked numb; the fate of Mount Pu had nothing to do with him anymore.</p><p>The Six Emptiness Sect disciples formed a defensive formation behind Daoist Luo Rong, secretly on guard.</p><p>“You’re a decisive person, Daoist Qingfeng.”</p><p>Apparently ignoring the Six Emptiness Sect disciples’ subtle movements, Qin Sang turned towards Mount Pu’s main peak, “This mountain was originally the ancestral land of the Xie family. Their lineage continues unbroken. The Six Emptiness Sect is the largest sect in the area, a fact you are likely aware of, Daoist Luo. The Luo Yan Sect drove the Xie family down the mountain and seized Mount Pu, refusing to relinquish it. This is unreasonable and unjust. Shouldn’t it be returned?”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong said calmly, “In the Central Plains, across nineteen states, I wouldn't dare say anything about other states, but at least in Zhuo State, peace prevails, and forceful seizure of another sect’s territory is unthinkable.  If such a thing happened, we at the Six Emptiness Sect would not stand idly by, even without your intervention.  As far as I know, the Xie family made a deal with the Luo Yan Sect using Mount Pu as collateral, and our sect was a witness to this agreement. Is that correct?”</p><p>Master Mo nodded numbly.</p><p>An elderly Golden Core cultivator stepped forward, “Reporting to my senior uncle, I was the witness to that agreement. The Luo Yan Sect temporarily borrowed Mount Pu, leaving the sect's treasure, the Green Dew Canopy, as collateral with the Xie family, with an agreed-upon return date.  The time has passed, but the Xie family destroyed the Green Dew Canopy and cannot return the treasure.  According to the agreement, Mount Pu should belong to the Luo Yan Sect.”</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong chuckled, shaking his head in what seemed like a sigh of pity for Qin Sang, “Did you hear that? You've only heard the Xie family's side of the story, so you’ve been misled. The Central Plains has its own rules, and rules cannot be disregarded. You are a celestial being, free and unconstrained. Why wade into this murky water and damage your reputation?”</p><p>Qin Sang clapped his hands.</p><p>Xie Qian stepped forward, presenting a wooden box.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the box, revealing a green gauze curtain.  He gently shook it, and the curtain unfolded, transforming into a wisp of green smoke—a magic treasure.</p><p>However, this treasure was dim, its power reduced to a tenth of its former glory, and it was beyond repair.</p><p>“Whether this treasure was destroyed by the Xie family is debatable. I consider myself adept in the art of refining, and I know at least ten ways to cause a treasure to self-destruct. Such a petty trick would fool inexperienced juniors, perhaps even your disciples and the Luo Yan Sect, but you wouldn't be deceived, would you? As for why I'm interfering…”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t dwell on the cause of the Green Dew Canopy's destruction, shifting his gaze to Master Mo, “Master Mo, would you please open the protective mountain array?”</p><p>Master Mo instinctively looked at Daoist Luo Rong.</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong frowned and said in a deep voice, “Open it!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Master Mo hastily flew towards the main peak.</p><p>The Luo Yan Sect disciples, witnessing their master’s demeanor, were silent, huddled together, the main peak falling deathly quiet.</p><p>The clouds parted on the main peak.</p><p>Qin Sang, clouds forming beneath his feet, led the Xie family disciples to the summit.</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong kept his gaze fixed on Qin Sang’s back, and followed, his sleeves billowing.</p><p>Moments later, they reached the Xie family stone.</p><p>Qin Sang approached alone and touched the Xie family stone, gently stroking it.  A barely audible sigh escaped his lips, “The Xie family stone, erected by the Xie family’s ancestors, has always been their symbol, used to test spiritual roots and transmit teachings. However, few know that due to its unique material, it once absorbed the ancestral blood essence.  Xie family members in direct contact with it will sense its presence.”</p><p>The moment he finished speaking, a faint white light illuminated the top of the Xie family stone, its texture transforming into smooth, jade-like white.</p><p>This sight stunned not only Luo Rongdao and the others, but also Xie Qian and Xie An.  Qin Sang's words were true.</p><p>Only those with Xie family blood could trigger this change in the Xie family stone.  The Xie family had declined, its resources dwindling, making it impossible to support all its branches. Could this Yuan Ying master be a lost member of the Xie family?</p><p>In an instant, the Xie family members' expressions shifted from shock to ecstatic joy.</p><p>"Are you a member of the Xie family?"</p><p>Luo Rongdao's face also changed. An outsider helping the Xie family reclaim Pushan Mountain and the return of their ancestor were two different things.  This meant a new Yuan Ying cultivator, a mid-stage expert, would be added to the Six Emptiness Sect's territory!</p><p>They might have been able to negotiate before, but now they absolutely couldn't easily concede!</p><p>Without concealing his intentions, Luo Rongdao unleashed his spiritual sense, scanning the Xie family stone repeatedly. He even personally examined it, but couldn't detect any trickery by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, remaining silent.  It was true only Xie family blood could activate the stone. However, he could subtly manipulate the restriction left by Xiao Xiangzi in the Qingxu Illusionary Realm to mimic the effect.  The Xie family still couldn't fathom this restriction.</p><p>Back then, Xiao Xiangzi's rage, had the Qingxu Illusionary Realm not been incredibly sturdy, would have destroyed the Daoist grounds. The restriction he left behind was extremely powerful and highly concealed.  Moreover, Luo Rongdao's cultivation was inferior to Qin Sang's, naturally making it impossible for him to see through Qin Sang's methods.</p><p>Luo Rongdao's expression shifted, contemplating how to respond, when his eyes suddenly lit up, his expression softening slightly. His lips moved, seemingly communicating with someone.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop Luo Rongdao, instead tilting his head to gaze at the sky. The sky was cloudless, a vast expanse of brilliant blue.  In the empty void, subtle ripples suddenly appeared, followed by two figures in Daoist robes materializing out of thin air – the other two Yuan Ying masters of the Six Emptiness Sect.</p><p>One was a female cultivator, Jingning, whose cultivation was similar to Luo Rongdao's, both at the early Yuan Ying stage. The other was a lean, elderly Daoist, holding a whisk, appearing ethereal and refined – Cheng Huanzi, the current sect leader of the Six Emptiness Sect and the strongest among the three, a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Luo Rongdao had sensed trouble and secretly contacted his sect. Now, the three Yuan Ying cultivators of the Six Emptiness Sect had arrived at Pushan Mountain.</p><p>"I am Cheng Huanzi."  His voice echoed far and wide.  By the time he finished speaking, Cheng Huanzi stood beside Luo Rongdao, followed by Jingning.</p><p>"Senior Brother, Junior Sister." Luo Rongdao bowed.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi nodded, turning to Qin Sang and waving his whisk. "Our Daoist sect indeed has outstanding talents.  Only after receiving my junior brother's message did I learn of Qingfeng Daoist's arrival. My apologies for not greeting you properly. Please forgive us."</p><p>"I didn't expect a minor dispute among juniors to disturb the three Daoists' cultivation. I am truly sorry," Qin Sang chuckled, his tone laced with sarcasm.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi glanced at the Xie family stone and said gravely, "We are aware of the situation. My methods may not match yours, but I can also create a deceptive display to activate the stone and mimic a Xie family member.  Using this as proof is rather flimsy."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze turned cold. He snorted, "Absurd! To return to my homeland and revive my family, must I obtain the approval of outsiders like you?"</p><p>"Not at all! Not at all! You misunderstand!" Cheng Huanzi shook his head. "The Central Plains boasts a flourishing Daoist cultivation, far surpassing the Northern Wilderness and Western Desert, thanks in no small part to its long-standing stability. Numerous individuals with ulterior motives infiltrate, attempting to wreak havoc and usurp territories, leading to devastating consequences.  We are acting for the greater good, identifying and deterring these threats. We hope you understand."</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, no sect wanted to offend a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator.  However, allowing this person to occupy Pushan Mountain would lead to bigger problems later!</p><p>Their positioning was calculated, forming a semi-circle facing Qin Sang, subtly encircling him. The three Yuan Ying cultivators’ auras merged, silently suppressing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over the three, a cold smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi narrowed his eyes and continued, "I have a bloodline test. If you are indeed a descendant of the Xie family, you may provide a drop of your blood.  Successfully passing the test will at least prove your identity."</p><p>The more Qin Sang acted, the less Cheng Huanzi believed in such a coincidence.</p><p>Master Mo's suspicion was likely correct; Mount Pu harbors a great secret!</p><p>"Friend, your words are inaccurate!"</p><p>Suddenly, a strange voice echoed from afar, like rolling thunder, clearly reaching everyone's ears.</p><p>A violent wind swept across Mount Pu.</p><p>A white cloud appeared in the air, and two figures arrived side-by-side.</p><p>"Friend Qingfeng, I have not failed in my mission.  I have brought Elder Lu to preside over justice."</p><p>Qin Sang's true form nodded to his illusory form, then turned to Cheng Huanzi. "Essence blood is the foundation of a cultivator. How can it be easily given to another?"</p><p>The composure on Cheng Huanzi's face vanished instantly.</p><p>Firstly, Qin Sang's true form's cultivation was no weaker than his illusory form, and another Yuan Ying expert of unknown origin had arrived!</p><p>Secondly, Lu Zhang was beside Qin Sang.</p><p>"Elder Lu!"</p><p>Why was Lu Zhang here?</p><p>In an instant, Cheng Huanzi considered many possibilities.</p><p>"Long time no see, friend. Your cultivation has become even more refined," Lu Zhang nodded, explaining, "I happened to be passing through Fudou County and heard of an injustice.  On a whim, I came, not expecting the three of you to arrive first."</p><p>Without giving Cheng Huanzi a chance to speak, Lu Zhang looked at the Qingluo Tent in Qin Sang's illusory form's hand. "Is this it?"</p><p>He drew the Qingluo Tent into his own hand.</p><p>Lu Zhang clasped his hands, briefly examined it, his face contorted with anger. He roared, "Incompatible spiritual materials were mixed into this during its refinement, deliberately concealed. Over time, it would self-destruct even without being used in combat. The creator's heart is wicked! Who is the sect master of the Luoyan Sect?!"</p><p>Little Mount Pu.</p><p>Six Yuan Ying cultivators had gathered.</p><p>Sect Master Mo never imagined things would escalate to this point; he was heartbroken.  Knowing this, he would have rather led his people down the mountain from the start.</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>Sect Master Mo, ashen-faced, knelt on the ground, desperately making a last-ditch effort.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Sect Master Mo repeatedly kowtowed, weeping bitterly, "The Qingluo Tent is my master's relic; this junior truly did not know its origins. Please forgive me! Please forgive me! Master Uncle, Master Uncle, save me…"</p><p>He shifted all the blame onto his deceased master.</p><p>A sect master, a respected Golden Core cultivator, had become a stray dog.</p><p>Everyone in the Luoyan Sect was terrified to the extreme.</p><p>"Insignificant!"</p><p>Lu Zhang disdainfully ignored Sect Master Mo, turning to Cheng Huanzi and the other two. "This person deliberately used a flawed treasure to plot against others, with ulterior motives! What do the three of you think?"</p><p>Sect Master Mo continued to plead with Daoist Luo Rong.</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong wished he could kick him away.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi watched Lu Zhang's actions coldly, but remained calm.</p><p>Lu Zhang's appearance here was certainly no accident.</p><p>In fact, the mastermind was likely the Buless Mountain Sect! Whether Mount Pu had secrets or not was unimportant; the Buless Mountain Sect was merely using this as an excuse to plant a pawn in Fudou County.</p><p>The ownership of Mount Pu, and whether this person was actually the Xie family ancestor, were no longer relevant.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi's concern now was the Buless Mountain Sect's motives.</p><p>These two Yuan Ying cultivators of unknown origin, willingly serving the Buless Mountain Sect, clearly targeted the Liuxu Sect. Was it merely to restrain them, or to expel them?</p><p>Cheng Huanzi regretted not contacting the Dragon Residence Heaven before coming.</p><p>The emergence of an unknown mid-Yuan Ying cultivator within the territory should have raised alarms.</p><p>His thoughts raced. Cheng Huanzi knew they were no match, so he decided to use a delaying tactic, lightly coughing, "Whether the Luoyan Sect had ulterior motives or acted deliberately cannot be definitively concluded. It may be a misunderstanding; the Luoyan Sect might also be a victim. Of course, the basis of this transaction has been lost, rendering it unnecessary. Mount Pu should be returned to the Xie family."</p><p>Lu Zhang seemed slightly displeased, but did not act, returning the Qingluo Tent to Qin Sang's illusory form. "I cannot stay long. I believe you will all ascertain the truth."</p><p>Qin Sang's true form smiled. "I also believe the Liuxu Sect is fair in its rewards and punishments."</p><p>No one cared about the fate of the Luoyan Sect and Sect Master Mo.</p><p>The atmosphere eased.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi looked at Qin Sang's true form. "Who might you be, friend?"</p><p>"My surname is Qin, given name Sang. I am an itinerant cultivator from overseas," Qin Sang repeated his previous statement.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Cheng Huanzi's expression changed. "Daoist Qingfeng also cultivated his profound abilities overseas? I've heard that overseas sects are different from those in the Central Plains. I've always been curious, but have had no opportunity to meet overseas cultivators. May I take this opportunity to boldly request your guidance, Daoist?"</p><p>If only Qin Sang and Daoist Qingfeng were present, Cheng Huanzi wouldn't be so reckless.</p><p>With Lu Zhang here, however, he was unafraid, seizing the opportunity to propose a sparring match to probe his opponent.</p><p>Qin Sang's illusory form was about to step forward, but was stopped by his true form.</p><p>"I will be returning to my mountain soon, and I regret that I have never had the chance to exchange blows with cultivators from the Central Plains.  It seems we are thinking alike, friend.  May I have this honor?"</p>
