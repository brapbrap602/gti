<h1>Chapter 1743: Dharma Form</h1><p>As the pain surged through him, Qin Sang felt not fear but joy.</p><p>From the Divine Fire Tribulation of the Nascent Soul stage, to the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern, and now to the Dragon Transformation Poolâ€”within just a few decades, Qin Sang had undergone three profound transformations, each accompanied by excruciating pain that would have been unbearable for most. Yet, it was precisely these trials that allowed his "Heavenly Demon Body Refinement" technique to advance at such an astonishing pace.</p><p>The spiritual liquid in the Dragon Transformation Pool seemed to contain an unknown power. While it appeared unremarkable from the outside, once it entered his body, drastic changes occurred. Qin Sang felt as though bolts of lightning were coursing through his limbs, bones, and meridians, penetrating his internal organs and bringing with them an inhuman agony.</p><p>His bones crackled incessantly, his blood qi surged violently, and his skin turned a deep crimson. In an instant, his blood qi erupted, forming a dense blood mist that merged with the spiritual mist in the pool. At the boundary between the two, the blood mist and spiritual mist began to intertwine, undergoing a strange transformation before the blood mist was drawn back into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>This cycle repeated endlessly.</p><p>Each time the blood qi returned, Qin Sang felt a slight relief from the pain, as if he had momentarily improved. However, the respite was short-lived, as the rate of recovery could not keep up with the rate of destruction. Although the spiritual liquid in the Dragon Transformation Pool might not be as intense as that in the Radiant Gold Sword Cavern, it was uniquely suited to the bloodline of the flood dragon. The liquid rushed through him without pause, leaving no time to catch his breath. Only a body like that of a flood dragon could withstand such an onslaught.</p><p>If this continued, Qin Sang would likely be forced to leave the pool. Yet, due to the ancient restrictions of the pool, he only had this one opportunity.</p><p>The Dragon King stood by the pool, watching as Qin Sang's body trembled uncontrollably. He stroked his beard and smiled. But the smile froze on his face as he noticed something unusual.</p><p>The Dragon King's eyes widened as he saw Qin Sang's body shudder, releasing an incredibly pure demonic aura. A pair of cyan wings unfurled from his back, glowing with a faint light.</p><p>The Dragon King nearly pulled out his beard in shock.</p><p>Then, something even more astonishing happened. A mysterious aura gathered above Qin Sang's head, and moments later, the phantom of a cyan luan bird appeared. It was lively and graceful, with long, flowing feathers that shimmered like silk, exuding an extraordinary beauty.</p><p>As soon as the phantom appeared, the spiritual mist seemed to retreat in fear.</p><p>The Dragon King, unaware that this was the manifestation of a Dharma Form, assumed it was merely an illusion created by Qin Sang's overwhelming blood qi. Such phenomena were not uncommon among demonic beings, but he couldn't understand why Qin Sang's blood qi would take the form of a cyan luan bird.</p><p>After a few more glances, he began to sense that something was amiss.</p><p>The Dragon King's expression changed drastically as he recalled a legend from his clan. His pupils contracted, and he was filled with astonishment.</p><p>"A Dharma Form?"</p><p>The cyan luan bird above Qin Sang's head was faint and indistinct, its outline barely visible. It couldn't even be considered a true phantom, and Qin Sang seemed unable to control it. Yet, it bore a striking resemblance to the Dharma Forms described in his clan's legends!</p><p>But Qin Sang's cultivation in the physical body was far from sufficient to manifest a Dharma Form, and he was clearly a human.</p><p>The Dragon King instinctively took a step forward to get a closer look, but suddenly felt the pool beneath him tremble. Looking down, he was horrified to see that a whirlpool had formed in the spiritual liquid. A powerful suction force emanated from Qin Sang's body, drawing the liquid into him like a bottomless pit. The water level dropped visibly, and even the spiritual mist thinned.</p><p>In just a few moments, a clear laugh rang out, and a cyan light shot out of the Dragon Transformation Pool. The pool, once half-full, now contained only a thin layer of liquid.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his wings still spread, did not retract his Dharma Form. He landed beside the Dragon King and clasped his hands in a respectful gesture, a smile on his face. "Thank you for the use of your precious pool. I must immediately enter seclusion. These spiritual treasures can remain here for now. Once you find the items I need, you can send them to me."</p><p>Without waiting for the Dragon King's response, Qin Sang eagerly left the ancestral grounds of the flood dragons and returned to his Dharma ship.</p><p>The Dragon King's expression shifted between dark and light as he looked at the jade box before him. There was no joy in his eyes, only a deep sigh as he waved his sleeve and stored the box away.</p><p>The Dragon Transformation Pool's spiritual liquid had been significantly depleted, which would undoubtedly affect the clan's strength. He could only console himself with the thought that, thanks to Qin Sang's mediation, there would likely be no major conflicts for the next few centuries.</p><p>Back on his Dharma ship, Qin Sang sat in meditation.</p><p>He wasn't worried about the flood dragons reneging on their agreement. Rather, he needed to immediately stabilize himself after absorbing such a vast amount of spiritual liquid.</p><p>At the last moment, he had a sudden inspiration. He imitated the Dharma Form to channel the power of the cyan luan bird's lightning, drawing the spiritual liquid into himself. To his surprise, it worked, and he was now using the Dharma Form to contain the liquid.</p><p>"I didn't expect the Dharma Form to have such miraculous effects. I'll have to study it more thoroughly when I have the time..."</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>The Dragon King returned to the Dharma ship, presenting a jade box filled with treasures that could aid Qin Sang's cultivation. The flood dragon clan couldn't have gathered so many on their own; some were from other tribes, but they had all passed through the Dragon King's hands, ensuring he received his share.</p><p>He requested to meet Qin Sang in person, but Qin Sang was too preoccupied to see him. His avatar inspected the items and clasped his hands in thanks. "You've gone to great trouble, my friend. I've overstayed my welcome and will take my leave now."</p><p>With that, the Dharma ship trembled and sailed away, cutting through the waves.</p><p>From the ancestral grounds of the flood dragons, heading east would take him directly to the Celestial Shaman Island.</p><p>Now, the shaman race could only hold onto this Celestial Shaman Island, surrounded by demonic forces. The shaman cultivators rarely dared to leave the island, as if trapped in a cage.</p><p>As they approached Celestial Shaman Island, Qin Sang finally emerged from seclusion. He examined his internal state and was astonished.</p><p>The unknown energy in the spiritual liquid, which he had thought would be useless and might need to be expelled, had almost entirely been absorbed and refined by him. Even the flood dragons couldn't achieve this!</p><p>He realized it must be due to the cyan luan bird's Dharma Form.</p><p>With this, he wouldn't need to wait until all the spiritual liquid was absorbed to attempt a breakthrough to the late stage of the fourth layer!</p><p>Following the conventional path of cultivation paled in comparison to gathering the resources of an entire realm to strengthen oneself.</p><p>Unfortunately, the ingredients for the supreme Spirit-Calming Incense were incomplete. After searching both regions, he had only found one of the required herbs. Completing the recipe would not be easy.</p><p>"I hope the shaman race can give me some pleasant surprises..."</p><p>Calculating the distance, Qin Sang stored his Dharma ship and avatar, then adjusted the black sleeve on his right arm.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird refused to return to the Thousand Jun Ring, so he had to keep the Sun God Tree in his sleeve. Fortunately, the Vermilion Bird could restrain its aura, preventing it from being detected by those with ill intentions, so Qin Sang didn't need to worry about concealing it.</p><p>He quietly passed through the demonic forces' defenses and landed on Celestial Shaman Island.</p><p>The layout of Celestial Shaman Island hadn't changed much in the past few centuries, but Qin Sang couldn't help feeling a sense of nostalgia. Soon, he arrived at a hall where an elderly shaman approached. Upon seeing Qin Sang's token, the man immediately knelt. "This humble servant greets the envoy."</p><p>Although this man was of the shaman race, he was actually a spy for the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>"Have you found the person?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The old man nodded repeatedly. "The last true disciple of the Black Snake lineage is hiding on the island, cultivating in secret. Although he has concealed his origins, he couldn't escape my notice. I've had people watching him."</p><p>Without further ado, Qin Sang asked for the location and disappeared.</p><p>...</p><p>In a courtyard within the city, a young man in black robes was meditating when he suddenly sensed something amiss. Opening his eyes, he saw a figure standing before him, the surrounding restrictions completely unresponsive.</p><p>The young man was terrified and quickly summoned a long blade, holding it defensively. "Who are you?"</p><p>"Are you the true disciple of the Black Snake Patriarch?" Qin Sang asked, standing with his hands behind his back, looking down at the young man.</p><p>The young man seemed to have expected this and gave a bitter smile.</p><p>After the Black Snake Patriarch disappeared, the Black Snake Mountain lineage quickly declined, and their sect was taken over by others.</p><p>This was partly due to Qin Sang, as he had killed most of the Black Snake Patriarch's true disciples, including his most favored senior disciple.</p><p>Although the Black Snake Patriarch had taken on new disciples later, finding talented individuals was not easy. While he was alive, the lineage managed to hold on, but after his death, the Black Snake Mountain lineage rapidly collapsed, and their mountain gate was overrun. The survivors became like stray dogs.</p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the Black Snake Patriarch had few enemies and the shaman race was dealing with internal and external troubles, preventing the Nascent Soul elders from paying attention to them, their lineage might have already been wiped out.</p><p>Private battles were forbidden on Celestial Shaman Island, so the surviving disciples hid here. However, they couldn't escape the war between the three races, and their numbers dwindled as more and more died on the battlefield, leaving only this young man.</p><p>He had thought that after several hundred years, the storm had passed, and he had let his guard down.</p><p>But now, someone had found him. Judging by the aura of the person before him, he was likely a Nascent Soul elder. Rules didn't apply to such people. If this person killed him, would the Great Shaman seek justice for him?</p><p>Knowing he was doomed, the young man's desperation turned to ferocity. Gripping his spirit blade tightly, he resolved to fight to the death.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him and sent out a beam of light from his right hand. "Have you seen this before?"</p><p>The young man was momentarily stunned. Looking closely, he saw a circular stone platform. He had never seen it before, but it felt strangely familiar. After a moment of thought, he suddenly remembered.</p><p>Seeing the change in the young man's expression, Qin Sang said, "Tell me everything you know."</p><p>Realizing that this person wasn't here to seek revenge, the young man quickly knelt and kowtowed, not daring to hide anything. "Esteemed elder, I once heard my master mention this in passing. Back then, the Black Snake Patriarch ordered his disciples to search for half of a similar stone platform. It was said to be an ancient treasure that had fallen from the sacred Mount Shaman God. The Great Shaman and the elders were also searching for it. The Black Snake Patriarch personally instructed us not to speak of it, but I was of low status and didn't know the truth..."</p><p>When the Seven Slaughter Palace ascended through the realms, many shaman experts were trapped in the inner palace and were obliterated by spatial storms. The Black Snake Patriarch was one of them.</p><p>Having died in the Seven Slaughter Palace, the Black Snake Patriarch left no relics or words behind. The young man racked his brain but couldn't provide any useful information. Fearing Qin Sang's anger, he hurriedly took out all the sect's ancient texts he had brought with him and offered them to Qin Sang for inspection.</p><p>After scanning through the texts and finding nothing useful, Qin Sang looked up in the direction of the teleportation hall, deep in thought. "Mount Shaman God..."</p><p>The young man remained kneeling for a long time before daring to look up. Seeing that the room was empty, he collapsed to the ground, drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>...</p><p>In front of the teleportation hall.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hide his identity. With his sleeves billowing, he ascended the steps.</p><p>The guards were about to stop him when they were suddenly called off. Three beams of light descended from above, all shaman elders. They glanced at Qin Sang, their expressions turning to shock, and quickly knelt. "We greet True Lord Qin."</p><p>In recent times, the movements of the human and demon races had been frequent, and they couldn't escape the notice of the shaman race. The Four Saints Palace had also sent word.</p><p>Unaware of when Qin Sang would arrive, Mount Shaman God had sent elders to wait here.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around but didn't see the Old Demon Fang.</p><p>One of the elders bowed and said, "The Great Shaman is hosting a banquet on Mount Shaman God and has sent us to welcome True Lord Qin."</p><p>The three elders surrounded Qin Sang like stars around the moon as they entered the teleportation array to Mount Shaman God.</p><p>Exiting the teleportation hall, Qin Sang saw a group of shaman Nascent Soul elders waiting in front of the hall. Leading them was a thin, elderly man in a black robe. Qin Sang immediately recognized him as a spiritual avatar, with a spirit cicada resting in his brain palace.</p><p>The cicada's body was crystal clear like jade, its thin wings dotted with starlight.</p><p>A Star-Winged Cicada!</p><p>Qin Sang vividly remembered that scene from the past. Could this old man be the true appearance of the Old Demon Fang?</p><p>"Greetings, True Lord Qin. Fang has been remiss in not welcoming you sooner. My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>The Old Demon Fang, now the Great Shaman, stepped forward and clasped his hands in greeting, his expression complex as he looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>His demeanor and movements were no different from an ordinary person. Only someone with Qin Sang's keen eyes could detect any abnormality.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly observed the Old Demon Fang. His aura was no weaker than that of a late-stage Nascent Soul grand cultivator. Despite losing a life-bound insect gu, his cultivation had not only not declined but had actually increased.</p><p>Now that he could manifest a spiritual avatar, perhaps his cultivation had advanced further, granting him new abilities. Could he even rebuild his physical body in the future?</p><p>Looking at the composed old man before him, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel surprised, recalling their first meeting. Back then, the Old Demon Fang had been arrogant and unruly, his cicada's cry striking fear into the hearts of human Nascent Soul cultivators. Even the Great Shaman of the shaman race couldn't control him.</p><p>It seemed that the Old Demon Fang's position as Great Shaman was not merely nominal. Qin Sang had heard Bao Zhengnan and others discuss him. He had led the shaman race through several crises, dedicating himself fully and impartially.</p><p>The shaman race had suffered repeated calamities, and their survival to this day was largely due to the Old Demon Fang's efforts.</p><p>The Great Shaman's life-and-death trust had finally moved this man.</p><p>As these thoughts crossed his mind, Qin Sang returned the greeting. "We are old acquaintances who have shared hardships. There's no need for such formalities, Fellow Daoist Fang."</p><p>"Indeed, True Lord Qin and I are old friends. It's rare that True Lord Qin still remembers this old man..."</p><p>The Old Demon Fang sighed.</p><p>After receiving Bao Zhengnan's message, he had to think hard to recall this person.</p><p>Back then, he had looked down on everyone. Qin Sang hadn't even reached the Nascent Soul stage, so how could he have caught his attention?</p><p>Who could have imagined that, as time passed, among the juniors, Bao Zhengnan could stand on equal footing with him, but this person had already surpassed him, reaching a realm that countless cultivators dreamed of, roaming freely in the world.</p><p>"True Lord Qin's talent is unparalleled. It's laughable that Fang was blind back then..."</p><p>The Old Demon Fang shook his head with a bitter smile and gestured to the side. "Fang has prepared some humble wine, though it may not be to True Lord Qin's taste."</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hands and expressed his gratitude.</p><p>A light rain began to fall.</p><p>The teleportation hall was located below the mountainside. Further up was the shaman race's forbidden area, the residence of the Great Shaman. Even shaman cultivators needed permission to enter.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to observe Mount Shaman God, so he didn't use any movement techniques. The Old Demon Fang and the others had no choice but to follow him step by step as they ascended the steps.</p><p>The raindrops pattered against the leaves, creating a fresh and natural atmosphere.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky. The summit of Mount Shaman God was shrouded in dark clouds. While it was night outside, the mountain was as bright as day.</p><p>A hundred-mile area above was covered in dark clouds, with lightning dancing wildly and silver snakes darting through the sky. Terrifying bolts of lightning flashed constantly, their thunderous roars blocked by the mountain's restrictions, just as Qin Sang had seen it the first time.</p><p>He had heard legends about Mount Shaman God before. The mountain had always been revered as a sacred site by the shaman race, with clouds and lightning that never dissipated. The shaman cultivators believed it to be a divine miracle.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the dark clouds and lightning here were ordinary natural phenomena, with nothing particularly unusual. But that was precisely what was strange!</p><p>The Shaman Continent was not a region with abundant water vapor. Ordinary clouds shouldn't remain for so long.</p><p>He glanced at the Old Demon Fang. With so many people around, he didn't say much, deciding to wait until after the banquet to ask for details.</p><p>Entering the banquet hall, they took their seats as host and guest. Maids gracefully brought forth immortal fruits and fine wine.</p><p>After a few cups of wine, Qin Sang brought up the main topic. "Do you all know why I've come?"</p><p>The shaman leaders set down their jade cups and sat up straight, looking at him solemnly.</p><p>The Old Demon Fang spoke in a deep voice, "Palace Master Bao sent a secret message. We have a rough idea, but there are many details we don't understand. Please enlighten us, True Lord Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and began to explain everything.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
