<h1>Chapter 586: A Feigned Attack</h1><p>Chapter 586: A Feigned Attack</p><p>This news both shocked and thrilled Qin Sang.</p><p>If what Yun Youzi said was true, this Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid was most likely taken from Xuanpu Palace by a Yuanzhao Sect ancestor. Otherwise, Yi Tiannie wouldn't be so persistent!</p><p>During their time in the Sunken Cave, Yi Tiannie secretly controlled the Flying Night Rakshasa. He could have easily escaped while Qin Sang was away, slowly erasing his soul mark, refining the Flying Night Rakshasa's primordial spirit, and completely taking over the body.</p><p>The fact that he risked staying meant he was after the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid!</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Yi Tiannie's expression darkening with each word from Yun Youzi.</p><p>Finally, Yun Youzi chuckled softly, saying, "Brother Qin, since this man knows about the Three Lights Jade Liquid, are you still afraid he'll destroy the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit?  The Three Lights Jade Liquid is known as a miraculous healing elixir. Healing your fundamental injuries will be a piece of cake. Why bother with the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit?  Seize him!"</p><p>Yun Youzi suddenly roared.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's face changed drastically. He never expected Yun Youzi to see through him so easily.</p><p>In a few words, the situation completely reversed.</p><p>He had become the prey.</p><p>Black energy surged from Yi Tiannie's palm, the corpse energy enveloping the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree, ready to destroy it.</p><p>He had discovered an ancient scroll from Ziwei Palace while sorting through Kuiyin Ancestor's belongings.  It was this scroll that revealed information about Xuanpu Palace and the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Later, he unintentionally learned a secret from Ziwei Palace, leading him to believe that Ziwei Palace likely also held some Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Upon learning this, his ambition ignited, and he remembered the Yuanzhao Sect's Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid was indeed obtained from Xuanpu Palace by a Yuanzhao ancestor; it was the lowest-grade treasure among the heavenly materials found there.  Kuiyin Ancestor had competed with the Yuanzhao ancestor for the orchid, knowing it was not fully mature.</p><p>However, even an immature orchid was still a treasure.  A few hundred years, and it could potentially create another Nascent Soul expert for the sect.</p><p>After the Yuanzhao ancestor's unexpected death, Kuiyin Ancestor had considered obtaining it. However, after a warning from Wujimen, one of the Eight Great Righteous Sects, and considering the strength of the Yuanzhao Sect itself, he decided to give up.</p><p>He couldn't use it himself, and he would be long gone in a few hundred years.</p><p>Furthermore, the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid wasn't guaranteed to allow someone to form a Nascent Soul; there was no need to antagonize Wujimen.</p><p>Yi Tiannie was nearing the end of his lifespan, one foot already in the grave. His desire for Nascent Soul cultivation had driven him to madness, willing to sacrifice everything, even his entire sect.</p><p>Therefore, after learning about the Three Lights Jade Liquid, he immediately began preparations.</p><p>He not only sought the weaknesses of the Yuanzhao Sect's protective mountain formation but also cultivated a ghost path secret technique left by Kuiyin Ancestor, in case he couldn't find a life-extending elixir before the opening of Ziwei Palace, allowing him to cultivate the ghost path instead.</p><p>Du E Dan, pills to overcome the tribulation of realm breakthroughs.</p><p>These pills were not only usable by cultivators, but also by demon cultivators transforming, ghost cultivators advancing, and spirit insects undergoing metamorphosis.</p><p>In reality, Yi Tiannie knew very little about the Three Lights Jade Liquid, his knowledge coming solely from the damaged ancient scroll left by Kuiyin Ancestor. He wasn't even sure if it could cure Qin Sang.</p><p>Yet Yun Youzi spoke with such certainty, seemingly possessing a deeper understanding of Xuanpu Palace, the Gathering Spirit Bowl, and the Three Lights Jade Liquid than Yi Tiannie himself.</p><p>Yi Tiannie was filled with suspicion and doubt. He realized that his threat wouldn't succeed. Qin Sang, having formed an external elixir, was no weaker than the Flying Night Rakshasa, and with his magical artifact, he couldn't be killed.</p><p>Therefore, Yi Tiannie decided to retreat, but his ruthless nature led him to try destroying the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree, denying Qin Sang access to its fruits.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Corpse energy swept towards the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree.</p><p>As the rare spirit tree was about to be consumed and destroyed by the demonic energy,</p><p>a white light surged from the roots of the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree. This light originated from the same source as the white light Yun Youzi had previously summoned, also from the Demon King's Blood Ban.</p><p>'Puff!'</p><p>The white light instantly enveloped the entire Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree, easily dispelling the corpse energy.</p><p>It turned out that when the Demon King discovered the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree and left the Demon King's Blood Ban, it was meant as a legacy for future generations.</p><p>Firstly, it sealed the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit's aura, concealing this treasure trove to prevent discovery by human cultivators.</p><p>Secondly, it was meant to protect the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree, preventing any future descendants from fighting over the fruits in the stone hall, carelessly destroying this treasured location and the spirit tree.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's attempt to destroy the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit tree triggered the Demon King's Blood Ban.</p><p>However, the Demon King's intention was to protect the tree, not to harm people. After the Demon King's Blood Ban activated, it did not attack Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Yi Tiannie’s attack missed.  Seeing the white light not targeting him, he quickly guessed the situation and immediately withdrew his corpse energy, reaching for the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.</p><p>This time, the Demon King's Blood Ban didn't stop him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Yi Tiannie's fingers were about to grasp the fruit, a faint image of a precious pearl, the Immaculate Pearl, suddenly appeared in front of it.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The pearl suddenly shone brightly, radiating light and unleashing immense force, resisting Yi Tiannie’s hand.  It then shattered the Blood Ban's light, sweeping the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit away.</p><p>Yi Tiannie was furious. He looked around and saw Yun Youzi still hidden in a corner, with his own Immaculate Pearl slowly fading away.</p><p>Yun Youzi, in his weakened state, had secretly placed the Immaculate Pearl near Yi Tiannie, completely undetected!</p><p>Qin Sang, having already acted, charged forward.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was quite surprised. He hadn't expected Yun Youzi to have the energy to steal the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit; he'd already given up on that possibility.</p><p>It now seemed that Yun Youzi's earlier claim about the Three Lights Jade Liquid curing his hidden injuries was a deception.</p><p>A few words had driven Yi Tiannie into a state of panic.</p><p>Qin Sang, having witnessed the miraculous abilities of the Immaculate Pearl many times, was somewhat numb to its power.</p><p>He looked coldly at Yi Tiannie, his eyes flashing with icy menace, as if looking at a dead man.</p><p>Yi Tiannie knew too many secrets, and Qin Sang hated him deeply. He couldn't be left alive!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner stood firmly before Qin Sang, drawing in energy and unleashing Nine Netherworld Magic Flames, spreading wildly.</p><p>*Hiss… hiss…*</p><p>The lake water boiled, the lakebed instantly drying up.</p><p>Waves of fire surged through the stone hall, crashing towards Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Yi Tiannie failed again, watching helplessly as the Immaculate Pearl carried the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit away. He cursed, but dared not pursue.</p><p>He feared being entangled by Qin Sang, giving Yun Youzi time to recover and reactivate the Demon King's Blood Ban, treating him the same way they dealt with the leopard.</p><p>Yi Tiannie, intimately familiar with the Ten Directions Yama Banner, saw a weak point in the raging inferno and dashed towards it.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The next moment, Yi Tiannie was sent flying back, his figure battered.</p><p>Then, a furious roar came from the sea of fire: "How can your Corpse Pill be so powerful?!"</p><p>(Thank you to the patrons  Fanxing Mantingkong, Longchanfumu, and Xiandoufu for their generous support.</p><p>Thank you to all the brothers for your votes and donations.</p><p>Thank you for your concern during the past period.
