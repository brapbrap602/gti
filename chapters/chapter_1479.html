<h1>Chapter 1471: Body Cultivation (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1471: Body Cultivation (4k)</p><p>The gems melted, the coral burned, and the magnificent underwater palace was transformed into a scene of fiery devastation.  Qin Sang's praise felt like a mockery.</p><p>Seeing the destruction of the palace, he was astonished by the power of the Sun God Tree, while simultaneously experiencing the sensation of controlling the Sun God Birds. He could only manage three birds with his utmost effort.  Because his mastery of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* was insufficient, he couldn't refine the Nanming Li Fire, and thus couldn't control it, resorting instead to the crude method of detonating the spiritual fire within the birds, using them like thunderbolts.</p><p>While the birds were powerful, they lacked agility and precision. Qin Sang could only slightly adjust their flight paths.  Therefore, using the Sun God Tree required precise timing. Against an opponent like the Hunmo Elder, who possessed the ability of shapeshifting, meticulous planning was essential, otherwise, failure was highly probable.</p><p>The four-tiered Serpent Seal in Tong Lingyu's hands, while less powerful than the Sun God Tree, seemed to benefit from the *Tongbao* technique.  She demonstrated clear control over the artifact, wielding it with flexibility and adaptability.</p><p>Both treasures had their advantages and disadvantages.  Their relative strengths were debatable.</p><p>Furthermore, the Sun God Tree's consumption far exceeded Qin Sang's expectations. In a single battle, his true essence could only sustain two attacks. Even absorbing spirit stones and consuming pills made it difficult to quickly replenish his true essence.  Divine treasures like the Three Lights Jade Liquid were extremely rare.  Moreover, he couldn't solely rely on the Sun God Tree during combat; he needed to reserve energy to control other artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind stirred.  The Sun God Tree, floating behind his head, zipped to his front, and the birds on the tree rapidly regenerated to nine. The treasure contained sealed Zhuque feathers, and the Nanming Li Fire was inexhaustible.  What limited Qin Sang was his cultivation, not the artifact or the fire itself.</p><p>After the Sun God Tree's first powerful display, Qin Sang immediately stored it in his Qianjun Ring. The palace’s light dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, meeting the frog-fish's shocked and terrified gaze.  He chuckled inwardly; for Yuan Ying cultivators and Demon Kings, the Sun God Tree's power was indeed overwhelming.</p><p>The frog-fish's pupils dilated, its heart sinking. Seeing Qin Sang emerge from the flames, its fear intensified to the point of utter despair and regret.  It cursed its own folly for crossing paths with such a terrifying foe.</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>The frog-fish spewed a ball of green light towards Qin Sang, not bothering to check the result before swiftly fleeing.  It had used this green light against Qin Sang before, attempting the same tactic again.</p><p>Instantly, the underwater palace was bathed in a sickly green glow, filled with insidious poison.  It was impossible to defend against.  Even a touch would cause flesh to melt, resulting in a slow, agonizing death, leaving behind only a pool of pus.</p><p>Thus, despite being only at the early stage of Transformation, the frog-fish was among the creatures the Demon Kings were most reluctant to provoke.</p><p>The green light dispersed the flames, aggressively transforming into waves that crashed towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Although the frog-fish seemed to have gained the upper hand, it knew Qin Sang possessed antidotal methods. Having nearly suffered defeat last time, it didn’t expect the green light to trap Qin Sang and fled without looking back towards another exit.  Escaping into the underground river, using the complex network of waterways, it hoped to evade its formidable enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang, clad in his anti-poison armor, was fearless. Without hesitation, he charged into the green light, pursuing the frog-fish.</p><p>The frog-fish, seemingly fleeing in panic, remained keenly aware of its pursuer.  Seeing its opponent fall for the trap, the frog-fish’s mouth split into a cruel smile, revealing its fangs.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A strange syllable escaped the frog-fish's throat.</p><p>The next moment, without warning, countless dark green orbs appeared within the green light, surrounding Qin Sang.  They detonated in rapid succession!</p><p>The underwater palace trembled again, buildings collapsing into ruins.  Qin Sang's figure was swallowed by the intense green light.  Green lightning danced through the light, connecting the orbs, creating a continuous chain of explosions, accompanied by deafening roars.</p><p>The frog-fish chuckled with self-satisfaction.  After its failed attempt to ambush Qin Sang last time, it realized its abilities were too limited. Against an opponent with powerful antidotal means, it was completely countered, a natural prey.</p><p>After much deliberation, Wa Yu devised a plan.  Mimicking the demonic cultivation method of creating Yin lightning, he infused Yin energy and condensed venomous light, forging a special type of poisonous thunderclap.</p><p>This thunderclap, upon exploding, would not only unleash potent poison but also possess tremendous destructive power.</p><p>Facing life or death, Wa Yu remained calm, his earlier demeanor a mix of genuine fear and calculated deception.  He aimed to make Qin Sang believe he was panicked and desperate, forcing him to rely on his venomous light for defense, thus fostering a sense of complacency.</p><p>The poison thunderclap hidden within the venomous light was the true killing blow.  Once it exploded, piercing the poison armor, Qin Sang would inevitably be poisoned.</p><p>The plan worked perfectly!</p><p>However, even after seeing Qin Sang fall victim, Wa Yu didn't turn back to counterattack. The power displayed by the Sun God Tree had genuinely terrified him.  The firebirds were instantly killed by contact; Wa Yu, not known for his physical strength as a demon king, knew he couldn't risk it.</p><p>Unless the poison thunderclap instantly killed Qin Sang, even a sliver of life left would allow Qin Sang to deliver a fatal blow—something Wa Yu couldn't afford. His only goal was to escape the powerful enemy.  It's better to live to fight another day.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned.</p><p>A scene of utter despair unfolded before Wa Yu. After the poison thunderclap detonated, the radiant aura surrounding Qin Sang, protected by the Ruyi Orb, effortlessly dispelled the venomous light, leaving him unscathed.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang's phoenix wings fluttered gently, effortlessly surpassing Wa Yu and blocking his path.</p><p>Wa Yu's face turned pale, the terror in his eyes now completely unconcealed.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was cold and indifferent as he swept it over Wa Yu.  Their feud was long-standing; there was nothing left to say. He didn't summon demonic fire or his Golden Sinking Sword. His blood surged, Buddhist chants filled the air, and he lunged at Wa Yu, intent on close-quarters combat!</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated the Seven Master Buddha Seals for many years, his mastery deepening daily. He no longer needed hand seals; visualizing the seals mentally allowed him to execute the first two.  This was the first seal, the Auspicious Seal!</p><p>Qin Sang's blood surged, his fighting spirit soaring. He even withdrew the Ruyi Orb's protective aura, intending to use Wa Yu to test the power of the Seven Master Buddha Seals.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>Knowing escape was impossible, Wa Yu's ferocity ignited. With a furious roar, he revealed his true form. Though not known for his physical strength, he was a demon king, far surpassing human cultivators.</p><p>His opponent's arrogance, abandoning the advantages of a human cultivator to engage in close combat, was sheer folly—a perfect opportunity for Wa Yu.</p><p>In an instant, Wa Yu transformed into a monstrous creature with a frog's body and a fish's head.  He let out a shriek, madness growing in his demonic eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang moved faster, condensing his blood energy into his palm.  He closed in, delivering a powerful strike aimed at Wa Yu.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A gust of wind struck Wa Yu's face.</p><p>Wa Yu's pupils constricted. His vision narrowed to just that single palm, that single Buddha Seal, the surrounding space locked down as if he were sinking into mud.</p><p>Then, his body twisted abruptly, like a fish, incredibly agile.  Light flowed across his scales as the force of the blow slid harmlessly off him, a masterful deflection.</p><p>Immediately, Wa Yu swung his upper body, his jaws opening to reveal fangs half a foot long, each glowing green with potent venom, transforming into poisonous spears.  Taking advantage of Qin Sang's momentary lapse in power, he lunged to bite.</p><p>If he had succeeded, Qin Sang would have been instantly riddled with dozens of wounds.</p><p>However, Wa Yu's attack missed. He was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Qin Sang, moving like a ghost, had mentally formed the Lotus Flower Seal, somehow appearing beside Wa Yu.</p><p>This wasn't solely reliant on speed, but rather an exceptional martial art.</p><p>It turned out the seven Buddha Seals of the Seven Master Buddha Seals, besides their raw power, each possessed unique applications.  Mastering all seven was equivalent to learning a complete set of close-combat techniques.</p><p>Lotus-like light shone around Qin Sang, like a Buddha born from a lotus flower.</p><p>His movements were subtle, as if he were gliding between petals, unpredictable and elusive, rendering his opponent helpless.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang vanish so abruptly, Wa Yu was indeed taken aback.</p><p>But this experienced demon quickly recovered. Instead of searching for Qin Sang, he raised his scales, a rustling sound filling the air, while golden light erupted from within, merging with his scales to form armor, strengthening his defense.</p><p>As he finished, a strong sense of foreboding overwhelmed Wa Yu. He felt an overwhelming force erupt beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang altered his hand seals, forming the fourth seal, the Demon-Crushing Seal.  This seal was a true killing strike, powerful and overwhelming, leaving no room for escape. Its power surpassed the first three seals.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was like a fearsome Vajrayana deity, his eyes blazing with fierce intent.</p><p>Buddhism emphasizes compassion, yet the Demon-Crushing Seal was the ultimate killing move!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Demon-Crushing Seal struck, and the demon was terrified!</p><p>The frog-fish was startled, sensing a mortal threat. This human cultivator's physique was comparable to a demon king, and he wielded such powerful abilities.</p><p>Even the most ferocious demon kings were no match for him!</p><p>Even more terrifying was the countless treasures on his person; he was clearly not a purely physical cultivator.</p><p>What kind of monster is this?!</p><p>The frog-fish screamed inwardly, not daring to confront him directly. It violently twisted its body, retreating at high speed, but it was a fraction of a second too slow.  A searing pain shot through its shoulder, its body violently shook, and it stumbled.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A large portion of the frog-fish's scales were swept away by Qin Sang's palm, its flesh and blood flying.</p><p>Fortunately, the frog-fish reacted quickly. Had it received the full force of the Demon-Crushing Seal, the injuries would have been far more severe.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The frog-fish screamed, its demonic eyes filled with blood.  Seeing Qin Sang approach again, it went completely berserk.</p><p>The next moment, its flesh swelled, and a small patch of scales on its chest slowly detached from its body, inch by inch, leaving countless bloody holes. The sight was horrifying.</p><p>The frog-fish gritted its teeth. This shedding of its scales was another of its deadly attacks. Refining the poisonous scales took years of effort, and the process was excruciatingly painful.</p><p>It had been waiting for a one-hit-kill opportunity, but Qin Sang was too strong. He could injure it with just his body, and if it waited any longer, it might not even get a chance to attack.</p><p>The hardness of its scales was comparable to metal, and they had been refined with poison for countless years, making them incredibly toxic.</p><p>*Swish swish swish…*</p><p>Poisonous scales rained down, covering the sky and earth.</p><p>Qin Sang was charging forward, completely unprepared, and at extremely close range, leaving him no time to dodge.  He was about to be riddled with the scales.</p><p>Faced with this perilous situation, Qin Sang remained calm. His form paused slightly, his fingers already forming a unique hand gesture – a new Buddha seal.</p><p>The third seal, the Rotating Altar Seal!</p><p>As the seal formed, Qin Sang's aura immediately changed.</p><p>He was no longer the same as when he used the Demon-Crushing Seal, his energy no longer explosive and unrestrained. Instead, it was contained, condensing around his body, as if enveloped by a diagram of an altar.</p><p>In the void around Qin Sang, blood energy and force swirled, and an invisible vortex appeared in the center of the altar diagram. The first incoming poisonous scales immediately felt a resistance, their trajectory altered slightly by the force, preventing them from getting close.</p><p>This was the miraculous ability of the Rotating Altar Seal.</p><p>It could not only counter the poisonous scales, but also target magical treasures. In the future, as Qin Sang's physical body grew stronger and his mastery of this ability deepened, the Rotating Altar Seal's range would expand, eventually enabling him to suppress magical treasures with his bare hands!</p><p>After mastering the first four seals of the Seven Masters Buddha Seals, Qin Sang admired the comprehensive nature of this skill. His understanding of physical cultivation deepened, and his anticipation for the remaining three seals grew.</p><p>The frog-fish was shocked and, without hesitation, forced the poisonous scales to merge. The scales melted, leaving behind a drop of dark green liquid that transformed into a small poisonous arrow, piercing the Rotating Altar Seal and vanishing in an instant.</p><p>But this brief delay was all Qin Sang needed. He used the Lotus Step to swiftly dodge the deadly blow.</p><p>The poison arrow missed its target.</p><p>The frog-fish was stunned. Qin Sang had dodged its killing move without even using his Ruyi Treasure Bead.  The difference in their strength was vast; today, the frog-fish was likely doomed.</p><p>Knowing it was in a desperate situation, it fully unleashed its ferocity, roaring miserably and recklessly charging towards Qin Sang, determined to make its opponent pay a price.</p><p>In warfare, there's no unchanging strategy, just as water has no constant form.</p><p>Qin Sang moved like lightning, his four Buddha seals shifting continuously, his performance mirroring this unpredictable nature. He easily countered the frog-fish’s attacks.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the human and the demon clashed countless times.</p><p>The vast underwater palace was completely destroyed, reduced to their battlefield.</p><p>The frog-fish was steadily retreating, gradually cornered by Qin Sang, its situation becoming increasingly dire. It roared repeatedly, but it was to no avail.  Its rage was futile.</p><p>The frog-fish was in such dire straits because, firstly, the Seven Masters Buddha Seals were indeed extraordinary.  Secondly, the frog-fish's poison attacks were completely countered by the fat silkworm. It had powerful abilities but couldn't use them, to its utmost frustration.</p><p>The frog-fish’s roars were filled with resentment and frustration.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity, striking the frog-fish in the chest with the Demon-Crushing Seal.</p><p>The frog-fish spewed blood, its body recoiling and smashing through three rocks in the underwater palace, its chest caved in.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the frog-fish had not given up, waiting for this moment. It rolled over, spitting out a white light that shot towards the exit with astonishing speed.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation descended, enveloping the white light and revealing a crystal-like fish skeleton, which shattered instantly under the sword energy, ending the frog-fish's last hope.</p><p>The power of the first four seals was proven, so Qin Sang sheathed his playful demeanor, unsheathing the Jinchen Sword for a quick and decisive kill, ending the frog-fish's life.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed, lifting the frog-fish's corpse.</p><p>He looked around at the ruined underwater palace.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang carefully erased all traces of the Sun God Bird, preventing the demon race from discovering anything suspicious.</p><p>—</p><p>I went out yesterday, came home intending to nap, and slept right through.  I wrote this early this morning.</p>
