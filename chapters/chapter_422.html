Chapter 415: Tianyou Pass


Tianyou Pass.

One of the two major passes controlled by the Demon Sect forces, not far from Yinshan Pass, with a similar landscape.  The difference is that Tianyou Pass's city is built on an island in a swamp, not on ancient trees.

Tianyou Pass attracts countless cultivators, especially now under these circumstances. Many cultivators dare not leave the pass, so naturally, there's no shortage of auctions, big and small.


In the southeastern corner of Tianyou Pass, within a large courtyard, the gate stands wide open. Two masked individuals guard either side of the entrance. Figures in black robes frequently enter the courtyard.


Oddly, they don't enter the rooms at the back, but instead head towards an octagonal gazebo in the courtyard.


The moment they step into the gazebo, they vanish.

Those with high cultivation can catch a glimpse of thin, silver threads of light flashing within the gazebo—a magical array—revealing the gazebo's hidden interior.


As night deepens, fewer people enter the courtyard.

Just as the two guards prepare to close the gate, a figure hurries towards the courtyard.


The newcomer wears a black robe that conceals their face, a magical artifact that shields their spiritual sense. Whether male or female, or their cultivation level, is impossible to determine by sight.


The two guards exchange a glance. One steps forward, raising a hand to stop the newcomer.  "Friend, please wait!"


The newcomer stops, looking around, and asks in a puzzled tone, "Isn't the auction today?"


The guard clears his throat and explains, "The auction is indeed today…  Let me inform you, the master has decreed that guests attending the auction must demonstrate eligibility. Do you have a token?"


"A token?"

The newcomer says with displeasure, "I've heard of Mr. Kan's auction for a long time, and I've long admired his reputation. I've never heard that an auction requires a token! Did everyone who went in earlier have a token? Are you deliberately making things difficult for me?"


The guard waves his hand, explaining repeatedly.

"No, no…

"Friend, please don't misunderstand. We ask this because the master did issue tokens. Each person with a token is a valued guest of our master…

"Of course, you can participate in the auction without a token, but with the growing reputation of our master, more and more cultivators are coming.

"Our master is overwhelmed but, unfortunately, due to space limitations, is unable to accommodate all the cultivators. Especially this auction which involves significant matters and valuable treasures. Many elusive seniors have also been drawn here.

"Therefore, the master has established a rule: Those wishing to participate must present one thousand low-grade spirit stones or have reached the tenth level of Qi Refinement.

"Of course, the treasures at the auction will not disappoint you. Please understand."


After hearing the explanation, the newcomer's tone softens. They hum, revealing their cultivation, and softly ask, "Is that all?"


"Foundation Establishment Late Stage!"


The guards' faces change slightly. They bow deeply, their voices becoming extremely respectful. "The honor of your presence brightens our humble establishment! Senior, you automatically qualify as a VIP. Please allow us to escort you to the VIP room. We will fulfill any other needs you may have."


"No need!"


The newcomer waves a hand. "I prefer to watch the excitement from the main hall.  A private room is not appealing. Just take me to the main hall. I hear the auction starts at midnight. Don't make me late."


"This…"


The guards look at each other wordlessly. One leads the way, guiding the newcomer into the gazebo.

Upon entering the gazebo, the scenery changes dramatically, revealing a beautifully decorated hall.


The hall is divided into three levels. The first level is filled with rows of seats, currently bustling with cultivators, the lowest cultivation being the tenth level of Qi Refinement.


The second and third levels are quiet, consisting of private boxes. Each box is shrouded in gray mist, making it impossible to see who is inside from the main hall.


This mist is one of the effects of the hall's spirit array.


In addition, golden, sharp rays of light flicker on the walls surrounding the hall, a chilling atmosphere reminding participants of the situation.


The guard is about to lead the newcomer to a seat when the newcomer's eyes scan the hall. They wave off the guard and sit in an inconspicuous corner at the back.


"Go. Tell your Mr. Kan that there's no need for special treatment. As long as the auction satisfies me, I will return again.  I don't need any token."


The guards, concluding that this senior has an unusual preference, leave.

Unbeknownst to them, the newcomer’s chosen spot offers a complete view of the auction.


He sat quietly, aloof from others, exuding an aura of unapproachability. His gaze silently swept across the cultivators in the hall, as if searching for something.

Finally, he leaned back, closed his eyes, and patiently waited for the auction to begin.

Midnight arrived.

The auction commenced.

Mr. Kan was a refined-looking middle-aged man.  A few words from him left everyone feeling at ease, prompting admiration for his reputation in Tianyou Pass.

Mr. Kan was an experienced auctioneer, efficiently handling the preliminaries before announcing the start of the auction.

One precious item after another was quickly sold.

Under Mr. Kan's skillful guidance, the auction atmosphere grew increasingly lively, with bids rising and falling.  The treasures fetched high prices.

Oddly, the man in the corner remained leaning back, seemingly asleep, uninterested in the treasures.

Mr. Kan, overseeing everything, occasionally glanced at the man, a questioning look in his eyes.

He had already received a report from his subordinates; the man was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

In the cultivation world, late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators were considered experts.  Befriending such a person would greatly benefit the auction house, and Mr. Kan certainly didn't want to miss the opportunity.

He was adept at understanding people's preferences, especially during auctions.  Even the most reserved individuals would reveal their desires when confronted with something they coveted.

But this man remained motionless and unmoved.

“Perhaps these treasures are too common for him?  He must be of extraordinary background, disdaining them all?”

Mr. Kan continued the auction smoothly, his mind racing with these thoughts, a silent sneer playing on his lips.

In the past, he would have been helpless against such a person.

But this time was different.  Among the remaining items were several truly exceptional treasures, accumulated over many years, and he anticipated a resounding success!

“I'll see how long you can hide it!”

Mr. Kan withdrew his gaze, no longer focusing on the man. A jeweled crown just sold for a high price, giving him the opportunity to raise his voice and bring the hall's excitement to another peak.
