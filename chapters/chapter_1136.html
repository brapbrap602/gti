<h1>Chapter 1128: Facing the Great Adversary</h1><p>"After the fall of the Crimson-Haired Ancestor, it seemed that the Pure Yang Sect was left with two Nascent Soul disciples, but in reality, a seed of calamity had been sown. The two had always been at odds, and when one became the sect master, how could the other accept it? They viewed each other as mortal enemies, their relationship as incompatible as fire and water, leading to a deep rift within the sect and a steady decline. Outsiders saw the opportunity and fanned the flames, with the shadow of Daoist Chongyi behind it all. Daoist Chongyi's next Heavenly Tribulation is approaching, and if he fails to overcome it, he will follow in the footsteps of the Crimson-Haired Ancestor. This move was also paving the way for the Supreme Pill Sect to become the dominant force, and other factions were happy to see it happen. Who would have thought he would actually succeed... The new sect master isn't foolish either, allying with the newly risen Mountain Shape Sect nearby. The result is that the Pure Yang Sect has split into two, each now calling the other traitors and claiming to be the true heirs of the Crimson-Haired Ancestor."</p><p>Though Qing Jun appeared detached from worldly affairs, she saw everything with crystal clarity.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>He pondered silently. Although the Pure Yang Sect had split into two, it seemed to have stabilized, and they would likely begin to address the chaos below.</p><p>Li Yufu's cave residence wasn't far from the Great Sui Dynasty. He needed to ensure they kept a low profile.</p><p>"Senior Sister, do you have any plans to expand the Illusory Mist Sect?"</p><p>Senior Sister Qing Jun was carefree in her actions, disappearing for decades at a time, seemingly indifferent to the Illusory Mist Sect. Qin Sang wondered what her true intentions were.</p><p>"I took over the Illusory Mist Sect on a whim, just to have them handle some trivial matters for me," Qing Jun replied nonchalantly.</p><p>Returning to his cave residence, Qin Sang began to busy himself.</p><p>First, he reviewed the *Heavenly Demon Transformation Scripture*, confirming there were no oversights and that his cultivation had reached completion.</p><p>Then, he left Peach Blossom Valley, traversed various marketplaces, and met with Tan Yi'en and Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu not only had the pills Qin Sang had given her but also received frequent guidance from Tan Yi'en and Li Yufu. She had already broken through to the 11th level of Qi Refining.</p><p>Among Four Spiritual Root cultivators, this speed was nothing short of astonishing.</p><p>"This is the Illusory Mist Sect's disciple token. If anyone comes looking, show it to them. In the coming years, I will be avoiding a powerful adversary and will rarely appear. When you go out to train, do not mention me..."</p><p>Qin Sang was preparing for the future.</p><p>He looked at Bai Hanqiu, who was no longer a young girl. "Hanqiu, these pills are for you. You have about ten years to prepare for Foundation Establishment. If you fail to establish your foundation, you can either choose a successor from the mortal world or leave behind the Bai family bloodline."</p><p>Though it was harsh, Qin Sang spoke frankly.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu was no naive girl; she understood reality, and a single sentence wouldn't shake her Dao heart.</p><p>"Your disciple obeys!" Bai Hanqiu's expression showed no fluctuation, but a glint of determination flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Tan Yi'en had also broken through to the late Foundation Establishment stage two years prior.</p><p>After giving them some guidance, Qin Sang returned to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Two streaks of light raced across the Yun Cang Great Marsh, heading directly south. They were Qing Jun and Qin Sang.</p><p>Ahead, the outline of a large island appeared.</p><p>"This is Cang Heng Island," Qing Jun transmitted her voice.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed into the distance and saw a towering peak at the center of Cang Heng Island, conveniently named Cang Heng Peak. At its summit stood a magnificent palace, the venue for the alliance meeting between the two regions.</p><p>Surrounding the slopes, rows of buildings stretched all the way to the ground, forming a grand city.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two flew into Cang Heng Island, their speed unabated, heading straight for Cang Heng Peak.</p><p>Before they reached the city, two Core Formation cultivators flew out from within. Sensing Qing Jun's aura, their expressions changed slightly, and they respectfully said, "Esteemed Senior, are you here for the alliance meeting?"</p><p>"Indeed. I am aware of the city's rules. You may withdraw," Qing Jun replied.</p><p>She landed on the ground and led Qin Sang into the city on foot.</p><p>The two cultivators retreated without hesitation, not daring to question Qing Jun's identity.</p><p>"Flying is prohibited within the city, and even Nascent Soul Ancestors must lead by example. I will head to the alliance hall first. You come as quickly as possible and wait for my message outside the hall."</p><p>Though Qing Jun concealed her cultivation and wore a veil, revealing only her lively eyes, her crimson dress was still strikingly eye-catching.</p><p>Qin Sang, wearing a cloak, walked beside her, largely ignored by others.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The two parted ways, and Qin Sang took the opportunity to visit various merchant guilds.</p><p>Treated as an honored guest by the Tian Xing Alliance's guild, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the past, when they had fought to the death over high-stakes bets between the two regions. It was possible that some of his former adversaries were in the city.</p><p>Only after forming a Nascent Soul could one become a player in the game; otherwise, one would remain a pawn.</p><p>This was the largest trading hub between the two regions, and Qin Sang didn't take long to acquire everything he needed before heading toward the mountain peak.</p><p>Around the alliance hall, there were numerous pavilions and towers of various shapes, sparsely populated and exuding an air of elegance.</p><p>Outside, there were restrictive formations, barring entry to unauthorized individuals.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Illusory Mist Sect elder's token and waved it in front of the formation, opening a passage through the light barrier.</p><p>One of the bamboo towers belonged to the Illusory Mist Sect, and low-level female cultivators were stationed there. Though they didn't recognize him, they were extremely enthusiastic upon seeing an elder from their sect.</p><p>"Has the sect master gone to the alliance hall?" Qin Sang asked, looking toward the center of the tower.</p><p>A female cultivator stepped forward and replied, "Reporting to the elder, the Ancestor just left not long ago. It is said that all the other invited Ancestors have already arrived..."</p><p>In front of the Illusory Mist Sect disciples, Qing Jun always presented herself as Leng Yuntian.</p><p>"Withdraw. Do not disturb me without my orders," Qin Sang said coldly.</p><p>The female cultivators withdrew, disappointment evident on their faces.</p><p>He sat cross-legged in the quiet room, waiting for news, his mind calm and unperturbed.</p><p>Previously, he hadn't expected to meet Dongyang Bo so soon.</p><p>Since fleeing the Purple Micro Palace, this was the first time he would face Dongyang Bo directly. He wondered what expression the man would have.</p><p>After the time it took to burn an incense stick.</p><p>A streak of light flew into the bamboo tower.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the light, removed his cloak, stood up, and strode out of the bamboo tower, heading straight for the alliance hall.</p><p>"Are you Elder Qin of the Illusory Mist Sect?" someone guarding the hall asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, showed his token, and was allowed to pass without hindrance.</p><p>The moment he entered the hall, Qin Sang felt an invisible pressure, his heart sinking slightly. Those attending the alliance meeting were the top experts of the two regions, and he felt the weight of their presence.</p><p>He bowed at the entrance and said, "Elder Qin Sang of the Illusory Mist Sect pays his respects to all esteemed Seniors."</p><p>Numerous gazes fell upon him.</p><p>Qin Sang distinctly felt one gaze as sharp as a sword.</p><p>"So you are Qin Sang? Come in," a familiar voice rang out. Qin Sang recognized it as Daoist Zhenyi.</p><p>Without looking around, he walked to stand behind Senior Sister Qing Jun.</p><p>His eyes quickly swept over the figures seated in the hall.</p><p>Some he had seen before.</p><p>Including the two on the main seat: Daoist Zhenyi and the Nether Demon Lord.</p><p>There was also Daoist Chongyi, the sect master of the Supreme Pill Sect, and the Snake Granny of the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p>However, the Snake Granny had now formed a Nascent Soul. Beside her stood a half-human, half-snake creature, her spirit beast, at the peak of the Demon Core stage, the only demon present.</p><p>More importantly, seated beside the Nether Demon Lord was a man in brocade robes.</p><p>Dongyang Bo!</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, Dongyang Bo showed no anger. Instead, he smiled and nodded at him.</p>
