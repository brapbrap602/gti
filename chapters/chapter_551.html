<h1>Chapter 544: Instinctive Peril</h1><p>Qin Sang stood on a mountain peak, hands clasped behind his back, surveying the world.</p><p>Reflecting on his past struggles, especially the period of aimless wandering when forming his core seemed impossible, he realized the damage to his foundation was now a minor ailment, nothing to fear.</p><p>His journey had been arduous, but he had finally emerged from the clouds to see the sun. A magnificent path lay ahead, the future bright.</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang felt an overwhelming joy, an urge to roar at the heavens!</p><p>His roar boomed like thunder.</p><p>Echoing endlessly.</p><p>Shaking the mountains and wilderness.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>A flash of sword light appeared, riding the wind and soaring into the distance.</p><p>"Ride the winds of fortune, carry me to the clouds!"</p><p>...</p><p>West of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, a small mortal town.</p><p>An old Daoist with a celestial air borrowed a table and chairs from a teahouse and set up shop by the roadside.  His divination banner, planted firmly in the ground, proclaimed, "Wandering the myriad realms, known as the Half-Immortal," a rather bold claim.</p><p>Beside him stood a sharp-faced, monkey-cheeked constable, surnamed Jia, his demeanor frivolous and improper, seeking advice on his romantic prospects.</p><p>A crowd of townsfolk initially seeking remedies and fortunes scattered like they were fleeing a plague upon the constable's arrival.</p><p>"My friend, your features suggest great wealth and prosperity, but wealth and poverty clash. If you marry that girl from a poor family, she won't bring you good fortune. Instead, she will hinder you, restrain you, and erode your existing blessings…"</p><p>The old Daoist, unfazed by the constable, shook his head and wagged a finger.</p><p>The constable, startled, pointed at his own unremarkable face and asked, "You can tell all that from looking at this?"</p><p>"Of course, that's why they call me the Half-Immortal…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, the old Daoist suddenly sensed something, turned to look outside the town, and his playful demeanor vanished.  He grabbed the turtle shell from his table and smacked it against the constable's head three times.</p><p>"Ouch! You old geezer, how dare you hit me! Ouch! Ouch…"</p><p>The constable cried out in pain.</p><p>Despite his decent martial arts skills, he couldn't dodge or retaliate, collapsing to the ground.</p><p>The old Daoist's voice boomed, "Lust and lechery will bring you ruin!"</p><p>When the constable regained his senses, only the empty divination stall remained. The old Daoist had vanished.</p><p>"A true immortal…"</p><p>The constable, his arrogance gone, clutched his head and scurried away.</p><p>From that day forward, whenever lustful thoughts arose in the constable's mind, the old Daoist's final warning would echo in his ears, inescapable. Gradually, the man began to reform.</p><p>Of course, this is a story for another time.</p><p>The old Daoist was Yunyou Zi.  While waiting for Qin Sang in town, he had grown bored and decided to pass the time by practicing his old trade from his mortal days, fortune-telling.</p><p>Yunyou Zi walked out of town, seemingly employing some space-folding technique.  His pace appeared slow, but he covered ground quickly, arriving at a small hill outside town in just a few steps.</p><p>Just then, a streak of sword light flew towards him, circling briefly above the hilltop before landing in front of Yunyou Zi, revealing Qin Sang.</p><p>"Brother Qin, you look radiant, the shadows are gone. You must have achieved your goal."</p><p>Yunyou Zi looked Qin Sang over, noting the difference in his demeanor from their last meeting, and knew he must have succeeded.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and bowed in thanks. "I haven't thanked you for your assistance, Senior. The beast tide in Boundless Valley must have been your doing, right?"</p><p>Yunyou Zi smiled slightly.  "How else could I draw out the Azure Sun Demonic Sect's Core Formation cultivators?  It just so happened that while gathering information in the Heavenly Yao Mound, I learned a few tricks to lure demonic beasts. I intended to provoke a conflict between two beast groups, but by a twist of fate, it triggered a small beast tide in the Azure Sun Demonic Sect's training grounds, saving me further trouble."</p><p>"So that's how it was."</p><p>Qin Sang understood and didn't pry further, seeing Yunyou Zi's reluctance to elaborate.</p><p>"What were the results, Brother? Did you sense the opportunity to form your core?"  Yunyou Zi asked curiously.</p><p>"Thanks to your help, Senior…"</p><p>There was no need to hide anything from Yunyou Zi. Qin Sang briefly explained how he had intentionally stopped his core formation process and his accidental discovery of the Celestial and Terrestrial forces' ability to aid in core formation.</p><p>If Yunyou Zi wanted a detailed explanation of the method, Qin Sang would readily share it.</p><p>However, the method of refining Celestial and Terrestrial energies based on the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* wouldn't be suitable for Yunyou Zi. He couldn't simply replicate it but would have to find his own path.</p><p>"Celestial and Terrestrial forces can assist core formation? This is truly unheard of. But those two forces are extremely dangerous.  Only you, Brother, would dare to attempt such a thing."</p><p>Yunyou Zi, however, wasn't particularly interested in the core formation method. He expressed his admiration for Qin Sang's decision. "You managed to maintain your Dao Heart in the face of the temptation of the Golden Core.  I didn't misjudge you!"</p><p>"One is known by the company they keep. Following in your footsteps, Senior, I've learned much by observation and experience," Qin Sang said sincerely.</p><p>He had to admit that his unwavering pursuit of the Dao was influenced by Yunyou Zi, even though they didn't have a formal master-disciple relationship. In Qin Sang's heart, Yunyou Zi was his guiding mentor.</p><p>Yunyou Zi stroked his beard and chuckled. "I don't have your patience, Brother. If it weren't for my incompatible soul, I would have formed my core long ago. Since your hidden injuries hinder your core formation, it seems the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit is essential. The Violet Firmament Palace will open soon; we should go to Suspension Bridge Pass early and make careful plans."</p><p>"That's precisely my intention…"</p><p>...</p><p>The two immediately returned to Shaohua Mountain. Upon passing the Shangyuan Serenity Palace, Yunyou Zi bid farewell to Qin Sang. He didn't intend to see Li Yufu and decided to head to Suspension Bridge Pass first.</p><p>Qin Sang still needed to check on the Night Fiend's condition, so they agreed on a meeting place and parted ways.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the Night Fiend's injuries wouldn't heal so quickly.</p><p>However, he was no longer the same as before.</p><p>In the process of refining himself into the Night Fiend, Qin Sang's understanding of the Corpse Core had deepened.</p><p>Before, he had been helpless against the Night Fiend's injuries, leaving it to heal on its own. Now, he could use his experience to assist and accelerate its recovery.</p><p>The Night Fiend was essential for the Violet Firmament Palace, and he had to heal it, no matter the cost.</p><p>Watching Yunyou Zi's light disappear into the distance, Qin Sang was about to fly south on his sword.</p><p>Suddenly, he paused, his brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>A moment later, the strange bloodlust subsided. Qin Sang relaxed his brow, letting out an almost imperceptible sigh.</p><p>After removing the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, Qin Sang immediately consumed the prepared pills to expel the corpse Qi from his body.  Unexpectedly, the corpse Qi accumulated within him, after the Corpse Core's formation, was far greater than during his living corpse stage.</p><p>On the surface, there were no traces of his corpse transformation, but only he knew he wasn't truly cured.</p><p>The bloodthirsty instinct would surface from time to time.</p><p>It wasn't severe, but it was bothersome.</p><p>These past few days, Qin Sang had tried many methods, but none could eradicate it.</p><p>He had also discreetly inquired with Yunyou Zi but found no effective solution other than waiting for core formation.</p><p>During core formation, spiritual power would flood the body, transforming the cultivator's physical form, easily erasing the lingering effects of corpse transformation. Until then, he could only endure.</p><p>Fortunately, his dantian was stabilized by the five Yin elements, and with the Golden Core now bearing the brunt of the Celestial and Terrestrial forces, the damage wasn't severe and had fully recovered.</p>
