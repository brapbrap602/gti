<h1>Chapter 182: The Struggle</h1><p>Chapter 182: The Struggle</p><p>All eyes instantly focused on the two demon kings.</p><p>The crowd watched with bated breath.</p><p>The Jiao Long Wang summoned his golden spear, coordinating with the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's shell, confident in their success.</p><p>Flames and the crimson barrier mingled.</p><p>The crimson barrier seemed to melt, pierced by the flames conjured from the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>It seemed the two demons were about to escape through the breach created by the Sky Phoenix Feather.</p><p>Just then, the Jiao Long Wang's smile froze, replaced by furious shock.</p><p>"Who?!" he roared.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle bellowed in anger.</p><p>Before the sound faded, darkness fell upon the two demons.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The shell trembled violently.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's face turned pale, and he spat blood.</p><p>A slender jade hand, seemingly emerging from thin air, appeared and pressed against the shell. The shell's mystical glow dimmed, cracks appearing across its surface.</p><p>Then, the figure of the Ancient Demon's fragment slowly materialized. His gaze was icy, filled with greed and madness, terrifying the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle.</p><p>Simultaneously, a roar erupted from behind the Jiao Long Wang.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu appeared beside the Jiao Long Wang without warning, his expression blank as he stared at the Jiao Long Wang.  With a grab, a surge of true demonic energy erupted.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu and the Ancient Demon's fragment worked in perfect coordination.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragment overwhelmed the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, while Mo Qingzhu targeted the Jiao Long Wang.</p><p>Using some unknown secret technique, a 'swish, swish' sound echoed from Mo Qingzhu's true demonic energy. Countless black chains, like pythons, materialized within the energy, swarming towards the Jiao Long Wang.</p><p>Only then did the distant illusory figures of the Ancient Demon's fragment and Qingzhu slowly dissipate.</p><p>Several human experts had clashed with the Ancient Demon's fragment before, aware of its power and remaining vigilant, allowing for timely mutual aid.</p><p>The Great Shaman and Fang Laomo, while secretly conferring with the humans, had also received warnings.</p><p>Only the Jiao Long Wang and the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, unaware of the situation, lacked this warning about the Ancient Demon's strength.  They also had to dedicate part of their focus to defending against the cultivators. They hadn't anticipated the Ancient Demon's speed and terrifying power.</p><p>The Jiao Long Wang was not completely unprepared.</p><p>He and the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle had secretly communicated, already summoning the golden spear and donning golden armor, preparing their Jiao dragon techniques.</p><p>While numerous cultivators were present, none possessed cultivation surpassing his own.  With the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, even a combined assault would allow them to hold out for a short time.</p><p>The Sky Phoenix Feather's power had been unleashed.</p><p>The next moment, they would break through the crimson barrier and escape.</p><p>No one could possibly stop their departure.</p><p>Yet, at the last moment, disaster struck.</p><p>Seeing Mo Qingzhu so close, meeting his crimson eyes, a chill gripped the Jiao Long Wang's heart.  As one of the two realms' top experts, he felt an ominous premonition.</p><p>It had been a long time since he'd felt such extreme danger.</p><p>The true demonic energy closed in.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Golden light blazed as thousands of spear shadows erupted, a brilliant golden expanse.</p><p>The Jiao Long Wang unleashed a powerful blow, the golden spear imbued with powerful Jiao dragon techniques, like a golden sun, its power unmatched.</p><p>However, the spear shadows, upon entering the true demonic energy, instantly dimmed.</p><p>*Swish, swish, swish…*</p><p>Countless chains instantly filled the Jiao Long Wang's vision, tearing apart the spear shadows, rendering his attack ineffective in an instant.</p><p>The true demonic energy engulfed the golden spear, surging relentlessly.</p><p>The Jiao Long Wang's face finally paled.  If he insisted on activating the Sky Phoenix Feather, he would likely fall at Mo Qingzhu's hands.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle was also in grave danger and could offer no help.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's fragment, having absorbed three Nascent Souls, had previously fought three late-stage Nascent Soul experts on Yitian Peak.</p><p>Although he had paid a significant price to activate the formation and destroy the altar, dealing with the merely peak mid-stage Transformation Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle was more than enough.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Muffled sounds echoed from the shell in rapid succession, easily mistaken for a single sound.</p><p>The seemingly delicate jade hand was, in the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's mind, nothing short of a death warrant.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The shell shattered.</p><p>It was a manifestation of the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's great divine ability, not a real shell, but it still possessed extremely strong defensive capabilities. The Ancient Demon's fragment had blown it to pieces.</p><p>Fragments flew, transforming back into Xuan water, forming a massive river that crashed towards the Ancient Demon's fragment.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>The river was torn apart by the palm.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>At the critical moment, the tortoise shell behind Jiu Ming Xuan Gui appeared in front of him, finally blocking the ancient demon's split soul's hand.  The tortoise shell was Jiu Ming Xuan Gui's life essence, and its defensive power was indeed extremely strong. It wasn't shattered by the attack, but Jiu Ming Xuan Gui's situation didn't improve at all.  His blood surged, his true energy stagnated.  Shocked by the terrifying power of the ancient demon's split soul, he saw a flash before his eyes, his heart leaped, and he knew things were bad.</p><p>Just then, a streak of green light suddenly slashed in from the side, emitting astonishing fluctuations that sent another jolt of fear through Jiu Ming Xuan Gui.</p><p>Simultaneously, Jiu Ming Xuan Gui heard Nan Gui Xianzi's voice transmission:</p><p>"The Jiao Long Wang has no chance!  Obtain the Phoenix Feather, and all will be forgiven!"</p><p>As the Jiao Long Wang summoned the Heavenly Phoenix Feather and the ancient demon's split soul attacked, the Demon Lord and others also moved, all rushing towards them.  However, their motives weren't necessarily to save anyone.</p><p>The ancient demon's split soul had left a deep impression on them. The power of Mo Qingzhu, personally controlled by the ancient demon himself, was undoubtedly even stronger. The Jiao Long Wang served as a touchstone, proving this point.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Feather was the only hope of escape, and everyone was eyeing this treasure, at least to prevent the ancient demon from seizing it.  Da Wu Zhu and Fang Lao Mo, needless to say. Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord had already formed an alliance.  Nan Gui Xianzi and the Elder reacted swiftly, but they didn't charge forward like the Demon Lord and his group.</p><p>Ignoring his injuries, the Elder forcefully activated the Sacrifice Yuan Technique, his cultivation instantly skyrocketing to rival Nan Gui Xianzi's. The cost was high; the Elder coughed up a mouthful of blood before stabilizing himself.  The two jointly activated the Demon Suppressing Stele.</p><p>During this time, the Demon Suppressing Stele had regained some of its power.  With the combined efforts of these two great cultivators, its power was even greater than before!</p><p>*WHOOSH!*</p><p>The Demon Suppressing Stele traversed the void, launching a surprise attack on the ancient demon's split soul.  Their choice differed from the Demon Lord's; they opted to save Jiu Ming Xuan Gui and then cooperate with him to seize the Heavenly Phoenix Feather. Jiu Ming Xuan Gui was closest to the Jiao Long Wang; being close to the action gave him a better chance of success.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace, having retreated from the world, was recuperating in a hidden realm within the storm zone at the edge of the North Sea Rain Desert, where Jiu Ming Xuan Gui's cave was located. This demon had a strong connection to the Four Saints Palace, having once been under their protection. However, after the Four Saints Palace’s decline, Jiu Ming Xuan Gui broke free from their control and now dared to collude with the sea demons, infiltrating the Seven Killing Hall. In this life-or-death situation, Jiu Ming Xuan Gui, unless a fool, knew what he had to do.</p><p>*BANG!*</p><p>The Demon Suppressing Stele arrived in an instant. The ancient demon's split soul, caught off guard, sensed the danger and hesitated slightly. Jiu Ming Xuan Gui had escaped death, gaining a moment's respite, allowing him to clearly see the Jiao Long Wang's plight.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>The end of the year is busy; only one chapter today. I will try to catch up tomorrow.</p>
