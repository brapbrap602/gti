<h1>Chapter 1688: Contingency</h1><p>After devouring the infant ancient demon, the chain marks on the Ancient Demon's body began to fade, and the sealing power gradually weakened.</p><p>“Contingency? Is this it?”</p><p>A talismanic phantom appeared on his wrist, but the Ancient Demon didn't even look at it. A mass of demonic energy lunged from the void towards the talisman, transforming into a demonic vortex that easily tore the talisman to shreds!</p><p>The Western Alliance Leader gave a tragic, wry smile.</p><p>“Trivial tricks!”</p><p>The Ancient Demon scoffed, looking at the Demonic Lord with a sarcastic tone. “You call yourself the Demonic Lord? Such arrogance!”</p><p>His gaze swept over the Western Alliance Leader and the Demonic Lord. “Will the two of you obediently offer your Nascent Souls, or will you actively open your minds and allow me to plant a demonic restriction, becoming demonic servants before my chariot?”</p><p>The Western Alliance Leader remained silent, a long flute floating before her, her natal magic treasure.</p><p>The flute sprinkled specks of starlight, like stardust, transforming into a galaxy-like barrier that encircled her.</p><p>The Demonic Lord remained calm, unangered.</p><p>“Since you are an Ancient Demon Monarch, imprisoned within the ancient restriction and yet still possessing such strength, you must have experienced the ancient upheaval. Do you know the reason for the current dilapidated state of the cultivation world?  As later cultivators, is there a way to break this deadlock in the current era?”</p><p>His tone wasn't that of someone facing a great enemy, but rather like a junior seeking guidance from a senior.</p><p>The Ancient Demon licked his lips, his eyes filled with bloodlust. He offered an enticing suggestion, “Want to know? Become my demonic servant, and I will naturally enlighten you. Only by pledging allegiance to me will you have a chance to break the deadlock. Otherwise, the late Nascent Soul stage will be your limit. Your cultivation will be unable to progress, and when the Heavenly Tribulation arrives one day, you will ultimately be reduced to ashes!”</p><p>The Demonic Lord sighed. “Perhaps it doesn't need to be so troublesome. Searching your soul will reveal everything…”</p><p>Hearing these words, the Ancient Demon's gaze turned gloomy. He coldly declared, “Since you are both so stubborn, I shall gladly accept your Nascent Souls! Kill!”</p><p>With a single command.</p><p>The spirit sword floating above the Eastern Alliance Leader's head hummed softly. Then, countless sword energies erupted, transforming into a magnificent formation in the sky, descending upon the Western Alliance Leader.</p><p>The Eastern Alliance Leader was a sword cultivator who had grasped sword momentum. The sword formation contained terrifying pressure, suppressing the Western Alliance Leader.</p><p>Sword light filled the air like a vast ocean, and sword energy seemed omnipresent.</p><p>In comparison, the galaxy manifested by the Western Alliance Leader's precious flute appeared weak, dim, and minuscule, giving the impression that it could be extinguished at any moment.</p><p>The Western Alliance Leader did not choose to directly confront the Eastern Alliance Leader.</p><p>As former companions who had spent many years together, although they had separated to establish their own trade alliances, they had always maintained a secret alliance to resist the pressure from other forces.  Having collaborated numerous times, they were very familiar with each other's strengths and methods.</p><p>The Western Alliance Leader remained unflustered, quickly locating the weak points in the sword formation.</p><p>Playing a melodious tune on her precious flute, waves of invisible fluctuations rippled outwards, and the specks of starlight bloomed like snowflakes.</p><p>The originally dim galaxy transformed into a profound icy light, protecting the Western Alliance Leader. The invisible fluctuations collided with the sword energy, annihilating each other. Her natal magic treasure shielded her from the might of the sword formation as she quickly approached the Demonic Lord.</p><p>The Ancient Demon moved even faster than the Eastern Alliance Leader, and with even more terrifying momentum.</p><p>Now wearing Su Nu's face, yet devoid of any trace of her charm, his expression was狰狞, his large mouth opened, emitting a shrill howl. Demonic light erupted from his body, and demonic energy surged wildly.</p><p>The already dim mountain valley instantly became pitch black, transformed into a demonic realm.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's figure vanished, hidden within the demonic energy. His concealment technique was exceptionally advanced and bizarre, making him undetectable.</p><p>Seeing this, the Demonic Lord's eyes narrowed slightly. Without any visible movement, ghostly wails suddenly erupted around him,淒慘and piercing, unsettling the mind.</p><p>Then, a dazzling light shone around him.</p><p>Within the dazzling light, countless evil ghosts huddled together, following his every move.  Their blood-red eyes glared fiercely, searching for the Ancient Demon's traces.</p><p>This was the Demonic Lord's renowned divine ability, the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light!</p><p>Demonic energy pressed down, revealing the Ancient Demon's grand ambition to capture both the Western Alliance Leader and the Demonic Lord in one fell swoop!</p><p>In an instant, the Demonic Lord was engulfed by demonic energy. However, the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light was not suppressed. It surged against the tide, like waves in a vast ocean, attempting to disperse the true demonic energy and force out the Ancient Demon's true form.</p><p>The Taiyin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light was hailed as the number one divine light of the Boundless Sea, and also an extremely yin and evil divine ability, feared by all who heard of it.</p><p>Yet, even the powerful Demonic Lord felt as though he were in a precarious situation when surrounded by the demonic energy.</p><p>The divine light failed to disperse the demonic energy and was forced into a defensive posture.  Some of the divine light was eroded, and the evil ghosts within it vanished simultaneously, without even a chance to scream.</p><p>His divine ability unable to overcome his opponent, the Demonic Lord remained unfazed.  With a glint in his eyes, he clenched his hand, and the divine light abruptly contracted, becoming extremely restrained, condensing into a Taiyin Ghost Blade. He then slashed fiercely towards a point within the demonic energy.</p><p>The Taiyin Ghost Blade instantly pierced through layers of demonic energy.</p><p>A soft gasp came from the depths of the demonic energy. A dark shadow appeared, then flickered illusorily.  The true form narrowly avoided the Taiyin Ghost Blade, a seemingly perilous escape.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's true form had been found.</p><p>But the Demonic Lord's deliberate strike still failed to harm him in the slightest.</p><p>This caused the relaxed expression on the Demonic Lord's face to dissipate, replaced by a grave look.</p><p>At this moment, the Eastern Alliance Leader and Western Alliance Leader, still entangled, arrived. The Ancient Demon simply wrapped his true demonic energy, transforming it into a massive curtain, suppressing both the Demonic Lord and the Western Alliance Leader simultaneously.</p><p>The curtain's might was earth-shattering, pressing down along with the Eastern Alliance Leader's sword formation.</p><p>The Western Alliance Leader's face paled as she urged her precious flute to maneuver through the gaps in the sword formation, converging with the Demonic Lord.</p><p>Just then, a figure hurried over, quietly appearing near the mountain valley.  It was the old man who had taken the jade tablet and rushed back.</p><p>Seeing the scene in the mountain valley, the old man gasped.</p><p>"Ancient Demon!"</p><p>He was a step too late.  The Ancient Demon had already broken free from the stone tablet, though fortunately, the seal hadn't been completely broken.</p><p>"Demonic Lord! Western Alliance Leader! Did you release the Ancient Demon?"</p><p>The old man noticed the Taiyin Ghost Blade and recognized the two fighting the Ancient Demon. He furiously questioned them via voice transmission.</p><p>The Demonic Lord, his attack ineffective, retracted the Taiyin Ghost Blade to protect himself.  Sensing the old man's voice transmission, a strange look flashed in his eyes.  "Who are you? You know the Ancient Demon was sealed here, could you be a descendant of the Four Saints Palace?  I didn't expect that the long-declined Four Saints Palace still had hidden experts.  You've arrived just in time…"</p><p>"Do you know what a grave sin you have committed! With the Ancient Demon's emergence, the Boundless Sea will be plunged into chaos!"</p><p>The old man was enraged, berating the Demonic Lord.</p><p>The Demonic Lord sneered. "I don't see how capable the Ancient Demon is now! Although his strength is great, it is limited. Let him run rampant for a while. If a few more people come, slaying this demon will be easy. You needn't spread alarm here! Instead of wasting your breath, you should help us escape and summon other fellow cultivators to besiege this demon.  If we wait any longer and allow the Ancient Demon to escape and pick us off one by one, devouring a few more Nascent Souls, that will be a true catastrophe!"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>The old man was rendered speechless by the Demonic Lord's attitude.</p><p>Then, he saw the Eastern Alliance Leader and became even more bewildered by the bizarre situation.</p><p>All three were renowned figures in the cultivation world.</p><p>Not only had they unsealed the Ancient Demon, but one of them had actually been swayed by the Ancient Demon.</p>
