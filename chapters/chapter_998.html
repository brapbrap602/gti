<h1>Chapter 990:  Passing on the Teachings</h1><p>Chapter 990:  Passing on the Teachings</p><p>Previously,</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing the two-headed creature’s obedience, abandoned the idea of subduing it, promising to release it back to the demon sea once she broke through to the late Jindan stage.  Perhaps because of her inability to break through, the two-headed creature became restless.</p><p>“Absorb the fire incantation into your body and try to buy me time. It will be dangerous.”</p><p>Qin Sang warned the two-headed creature.</p><p>The two-headed creature let out a low growl, making up its mind.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and hesitated no longer.</p><p>The white-eyed creature looked at the two-headed creature curiously, then nodded at Qin Sang, returning to continue researching the fire incantation and perfecting the incantation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the two-headed creature, her lips moving slightly.</p><p>After a moment, a ring on the two-headed creature loosened and came off, transforming into a stream of light that disappeared into Qin Sang’s palm.</p><p>The two-headed creature paced back and forth in the air.</p><p>Finally freed from its restraints, the two-headed creature felt incredibly light. It let out a long, joyful howl that echoed continuously.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing the two-headed creature’s relief, felt a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out the remaining two Ba Xue Fruits from her storage ring and handed them to the two-headed creature.</p><p>“Refine these Ba Xue Fruits here, I’ll protect you. Hopefully, you can directly break through to the late Yao Dan stage…”</p><p>She had two Ba Xue Fruits left.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned to give one to the two-headed creature when she released it.</p><p>The other was for Qin Sang herself.</p><p>If the two-headed creature failed, she would give it the remaining one as well.</p><p>Although the two-headed creature had reached its bottleneck and almost succeeded when consuming the Ba Xue Fruit before, cultivation breakthroughs aren't guaranteed. Otherwise, the two-headed creature would have broken through long ago.</p><p>It was difficult to say what might happen.</p><p>To help the two-headed creature break through, she was willing to give it all the Ba Xue Fruits.</p><p>Entering the late Yao Dan stage would greatly increase the two-headed creature's strength and enhance its innate abilities.  Since it excelled in wind escape techniques, its speed would be even faster after the breakthrough, allowing it to buy more time.</p><p>The two-headed creature received the Ba Xue Fruits with fiery eyes, swallowing one whole and closing its eyes tightly to fully refine the medicinal power.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed down, using her true energy to support the two-headed creature.</p><p>After a brief period of calm,</p><p>The two-headed creature arched its body, letting out a painful roar, its fur trembling, and faint bloody light emerged.</p><p>Then, the potent medicinal effects rampaged through its body.</p><p>The two-headed creature’s flesh writhed, its bones dislocated, emitting a crisp sound, as if its bones were about to break, causing one's heart to tremble.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two-headed creature both had experience consuming Ba Xue Fruits, so they were not panicked.</p><p>The two-headed creature’s roars became increasingly urgent. It curled up into a ball, enduring immense pain, but it was much better than the first time it consumed the Ba Xue Fruit.</p><p>This state lasted for a quarter of an hour before the two-headed creature gradually calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>A bulge appeared between its two heads, and the two-headed creature’s roars became low and less painful, its condition gradually stabilizing, as if it were asleep.</p><p>Eventually, a bump formed at the bulge, which was the rudimentary form of a third head.</p><p>The next moment, the two-headed creature opened its eyes, stood up, and its vertical pupils shot out sharp light.</p><p>Its fur danced wildly, and wisps of green aura surrounded it, containing extremely pure power.</p><p>More and more green aura appeared, becoming increasingly dense and profound, until it finally formed a huge green wind cocoon, encasing the two-headed creature.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A loud roar suddenly came from within the wind cocoon.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The wind cocoon shattered.</p><p>A powerful wave swept outwards.</p><p>The chaotic green aura scattered, and Qin Sang withdrew her true energy, moving far away.</p><p>The seawater was affected, causing waves to rise, creating huge waves that only subsided after a long time.</p><p>When the green aura completely dissipated, a burly figure emerged from it, looking down at all directions.</p><p>The two-headed creature had grown noticeably larger, and the bump on its neck was very obvious.</p><p>The growth of a third head marked its transformation.</p><p>Its aura had strengthened; it had successfully broken through to the late Yao Dan stage.</p><p>The two-headed creature, plagued for decades by a bottleneck in its cultivation, finally broke through.  Its gaze swept around, settling on Qin Sang. It wanted to spar.</p><p>“Under normal circumstances, I’d gladly play along,” Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Understanding the creature's limitations, Qin Sang said, “Even without my magic banner, you can’t beat me. Stop showing off and focus on stabilizing your cultivation!”</p><p>The two-headed creature obediently lay down at Qin Sang’s feet, closing its eyes in meditation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the creature, a mix of emotions swirling within him. He shook his head and continued his journey.</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression grew more anxious; he kept glancing at Bai.  He discovered that, using some unknown secret technique, the frequency and intensity of the fire curse's attacks were increasing at an alarming rate with each recurrence.  This meant that the enemy's escape speed had increased, making the situation more urgent than he'd anticipated.</p><p>Another two hours passed.</p><p>Finally, Bai brought good news.</p><p>Qin Sang rejoiced, immediately summoning his magic banner and collaborating with Bai to perform a sealing technique. Bai, using the same method as before, injected a fire curse into the two-headed creature.  Bai’s power, combined with the magical fire, formed the seal.  The magical fire transformed into a black curtain, enveloping Qin Sang completely. When the fire curse erupted again, Bai exerted all his strength to maintain the seal, successfully suppressing the curse!</p><p>A wave of relief washed over Qin Sang.  He looked at the two-headed creature; it was time for it to leave.</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the creature, extending his hand and sending a beam of light towards it.  The light entered the creature’s body.  After a moment, the two-headed creature's eyes widened in disbelief. The light contained the first four levels of the “Heavenly Demon Transformation” cultivation technique.  Qin Sang had passed on this powerful method.</p><p>He explained that as a human, he had to use external force—star energy—to cultivate the physical body refinement part of the technique. The two-headed creature, however, being a different race, could cultivate the complete technique, using its bloodline power to advance, without needing to seek out star energy.</p><p>The two-headed creature, having received this knowledge, finally understood some long-held questions.  It stared at Qin Sang, a little puzzled by this unexpected generosity.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, “That Blood Domination Fruit was always meant for you. You’ve been with me for a long time and have served faithfully. This technique is your reward. It’s incomplete; I only have the first four levels, but it's enough for you to reach the late transformation stage. How far you go beyond that will depend entirely on you…”</p><p>Qin Sang knew this might be their final meeting.  The path of the warrior was long, and parting was inevitable.</p><p>The two-headed creature let out a mighty roar that pierced the sky.  It turned decisively and vanished into the wind.</p>
