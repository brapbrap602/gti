<h1>Chapter 1939: The Storyteller</h1><p>Winter turned to spring.</p><p>In a blink, it was the end of the year.</p><p>This year was destined to be a bountiful one.</p><p>In just a few months, Qin Sang's reputation had spread far and wide.</p><p>Especially in the three villages at the foot of the mountain, the villagers had truly benefited from her.</p><p>No matter how big or small the illness, as long as they sought help at the temple, they were cured.</p><p>Qin Sang's ledger was already half full, yet she never urged anyone to repay her.  Even nearing the New Year, no Daoist priests from Qingyang Temple came down the mountain to collect debts.</p><p>Some poor families hadn't even paid for their first treatment before needing a second, entering with apprehensive faces.  Yet, Qin Sang never mentioned their debts.</p><p>Everyone saw this and said that a true deity had come to the mountain, causing the temple's incense offerings to flourish.</p><p>When people slaughtered their livestock for the New Year, they would always leave the best parts and send them up the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang refused the offerings, but they insisted it was to nourish the two young Daoist boys, and they wouldn't be dissuaded.  Daoists don't abstain from meat, after all.</p><p>It was difficult to refuse such kindness, and with the New Year festivities approaching, Qin Sang made an exception.</p><p>In just a few days, all sorts of New Year goods filled half the room.  The preparation might have been rough, but the food tasted good.</p><p>Nothing went to waste. The three disciples lived among mortals, experiencing the daily lives of ordinary people, enjoying their three meals a day.</p><p>The twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month.</p><p>The New Year was almost here.</p><p>Yu Lang, having cultivated all night, was refreshed and opened a crack in the window. A cold wind carrying snowflakes swirled in.</p><p>Outside, a heavy snow had begun to fall.</p><p>"A lucky snow heralds a bountiful year."</p><p>Yu Lang pushed the window wide open, without using any spells, letting the snow fall on him, looking carefree.</p><p>Schools were closed for the New Year, with holidays lasting until the eighth day of the first month, and he had already finished his studies.</p><p>Before school, he longed to study. After joining the school, he discovered the joys of holiday.</p><p>"I wonder if Shijie is awake yet?"</p><p>Yu Lang bowed slightly toward the window and glanced at the next room.</p><p>In the past six months at school, his Shijie still spoke little, but she was clearly not as silent as before.</p><p>He recently learned that Shijie didn't meditate at night; she slept like ordinary people.</p><p>"How did Shijie achieve her cultivation?"</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't understand.</p><p>"With this weather, the heavy snow blocking the mountain, nobody should be coming up. I wonder if Master will still leave seclusion.  Elder Luo Hou is still asleep, Elder Taiyi is gone again.  Senior Zhuque is the same; she's been holed up in her nest for days, hasn’t come out. Is it too boring on the mountain? Master strictly forbids her from playing pranks…"</p><p>Yu Lang fell into his thoughts, noticing the snow slowly lessening. By daybreak, the snow had completely stopped.</p><p>The temple was covered in a blanket of white snow, flawless and immaculate, even the walls were dusted with white.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Yu Lang opened the door, exhaling a puff of white air. As he picked up the broom beside the wall, he heard the door next to him creak open, and Xiao Wu walked out.</p><p>"Shijie."</p><p>Yu Lang called out.</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded and picked up a broom as well.</p><p>"Shijie, let's sweep all the way down the mountain. Qiu Hua and the others said they wanted to come up to see you. With this heavy snow, I don't know if they'll still come."</p><p>The Qiu Hua Yu Lang mentioned was a classmate.</p><p>A few of the girls usually played together, with Qiu Hua as their leader. She was quite feisty, daring to argue with boys and always winning.</p><p>Including Qiu Hua, they all liked Xiao Wu, believing her silence was due to her gentle nature, and they were determined to protect her from bullying.</p><p>Thinking about this, Yu Lang scratched his head; he couldn't figure out Shijie's feelings about these playmates.</p><p>The two first swept several paths in the temple, opened the temple doors, and swept down the mountain path.</p><p>Before reaching the foot of the mountain, three people approached.</p><p>It was Mr. Chen, accompanied by his servant, walking through the snow, and another classmate named Tao Teng, who was similar in temperament to Yu Lang.  Yu Lang quickly gave him the nickname "Noisy".</p><p>"Yu Lang! Shi~jie…hehe."</p><p>Tao Teng drawled out the word "Shijie," winking.</p><p>Yu Lang, who clearly looked several years older than Xiao Wu, had to call her Shijie, and he had been the subject of many jokes.</p><p>"Greetings, Master."</p><p>Yu Lang glared at Tao Teng, put down his broom with Xiao Wu, and bowed.</p><p>"I've come to test your studies today."</p><p>Mr. Chen started with a joke. Seeing no nervousness on the faces of his two students, he secretly admired the excellent disciples that Master Qingfeng had taken in.</p><p>Yu Lang was understandable; he had a foundation from his previous studies.</p><p>A young girl, Xiao Wu, barely seven or eight years old, possessed a phenomenal memory.  Within days of starting school, she had memorized several Confucian classics verbatim, including the master's interpretations.</p><p>Because of this, Mr. Chen specifically consulted Qin Sang, concluding that the children were not yet mature enough and should remain in elementary school.</p><p>"Such a pity she's a girl,"</p><p>Mr. Chen sighed.  While Yan Kingdom was relatively progressive, there was no precedent for women holding official positions.</p><p>Yu Lang, a spirited young man, usually displayed ambition, but his master seemed to have cast some sort of spell on him.  He showed no interest in fame or fortune, reading only to understand Daoist scriptures.</p><p>"If I'd met a master like that when I was young, I'd probably be like Yu Lang,"</p><p>Mr. Chen thought, recalling the demeanor of Master Qingfeng.  He gestured towards the food box carried by his servant. "The snow-covered mountains are breathtaking.  Such a scene demands sharing with good friends. My wife prepared some local delicacies. Master Qingfeng should have finished his morning prayers by now, don't you think?"</p><p>He lived in seclusion in Qipai Village, nestled beside a mountain and stream.  However, he had no one to converse with in the village, and his friends lived far away.  Finally, Master Qingfeng arrived, and Mr. Chen felt a profound sense of connection, though he found the master even busier than himself.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated, looking at his senior sister.</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded slightly. "Master has left seclusion."</p><p>The two quickly finished clearing the remaining snow; the mountain path below was indeed empty.</p><p>Back at the temple, they found Master Qingfeng and Mr. Chen already setting up a table and brazier in the small attic.</p><p>The attic was Mr. Chen's suggestion, built by his workers. The lower level was supported by wooden pillars, with a ladder leading to the second floor.  From the second floor, which extended above the courtyard wall, the view was superb, offering a panoramic vista of the mountains.</p><p>"Yu Lang, take the beef Zhang's family sent and prepare it for grilling.  Also, bring the fruit I gathered in the mountains; wash it and serve it," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>"Fruit? Oh, alright."</p><p>Yu Lang, understanding, called Tao Teng and hurried to the food storage room.  They found a string of bright red fruits.</p><p>"There are still fruits in the mountains at this time of year? What kind are they?" Mr. Chen asked.</p><p>"I don't know myself, Mr. Chen.  But rest assured, these fruits are harmless and possess a unique fragrance."</p><p>Mr. Chen chuckled. "Of course I trust you.  I always find novel things here. I wonder what magic you use in your seasonings; they transform the ordinary into something extraordinary. In comparison, what I brought is hardly palatable."</p><p>The seasonings were made with spirit herbs; of course they were delicious!</p><p>Qin Sang thought to herself.  She rarely indulged in culinary delights, but wanting to share the joys of earthly flavors with Xiao Wu, she had put considerable effort into preparing the meal.</p><p>She picked up her chopsticks, took a bite of a golden pastry, and chewed slowly.</p><p>It wasn't as exaggerated as Mr. Chen described.</p><p>"Mrs. Chen is a skilled cook; the food is quite unique."</p><p>However, Qin Sang's gaze was directed outside the temple.  Several people were approaching along the mountain path, led by two elderly men, one of whom was Doctor Liu.</p><p>"Huh?  More visitors today?" Mr. Chen leaned out to look.</p><p>"Probably someone with an urgent illness," Qin Sang glanced at the elderly man beside Doctor Liu, then rose. "Excuse me for a moment."</p><p>"Wait outside!"</p><p>Doctor Liu gestured, keeping his companions outside the temple and bringing only the elderly man inside.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Qin Sang waved, preventing them from bowing, and led them into the main hall.  The elderly man, richly dressed, was clearly of high status, his face flushed, though unnaturally so.</p><p>Doctor Liu, somewhat uneasy about disturbing them at this time of year, quickly explained the old man's condition.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "Medication is unsuitable for this ailment. Bring the silver needles."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Doctor Liu, familiar with the procedure, retrieved the needles from his medical kit, his face full of anticipation. He had witnessed Qin Sang's acupuncture skills before, and could only describe them as miraculous.</p><p>"Watch carefully!"</p><p>Qin Sang warned, instructing the old man to lie on the straw mat. She deliberately slowed her movements, allowing Doctor Liu to observe the tremor of each needle.</p><p>In less than a cup of tea's time, Qin Sang withdrew the needles and stepped back.  The old man's flushed complexion gradually faded.</p><p>"Miraculous! Absolutely miraculous!"</p><p>Doctor Liu, deeply impressed after witnessing the procedure, suddenly looked dejected.  "I'm too old... I can't replicate that!  What a pity I only encountered Master now!"</p><p>"You may not be able to, but you can teach your disciples," Qin Sang said.</p><p>The old man's entourage waited with the carriage below.  Doctor Liu was about to leave when Qin Sang kept him.</p><p>"Your timing is perfect; we need company today.  It's perfectly fine to spend the night here. Your family can pick you up tomorrow."</p><p>Overjoyed, Doctor Liu readily agreed, sending word to his family and joining Qin Sang in the attic.</p><p>"So Mr. Chen is here as well," Doctor Liu bowed slightly. They were old acquaintances and formality was unnecessary.</p><p>Come, come!  Try the Daoist master's treasured delicacies!  Guaranteed to be the best in the world, a rare treat!  Daoist master, if you don't come soon, I fear I'll be unable to resist!</p><p>Chen Xiucai couldn't wait, holding a skewer of meat sizzling over the charcoal fire.  He sprinkled on a pinch of spices, and a rich aroma exploded, perfectly complementing the savory meat.</p><p>Liu Daifu sniffed the air, exclaiming, "How fragrant!"</p><p>The attendant boy, Yulang, and Xiaowu were already swallowing their saliva.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang chuckled softly, "What a lively gathering we have today."</p><p>Everyone looked towards the outside of the Daoist temple. The old man and his entourage had disappeared from the mountain path, but two men had appeared.</p><p>One was young and handsome, the other somewhat older.</p><p>The older man stood slightly behind, but they didn't seem like master and servant. Both were dressed in white, with an air of refinement.</p><p>"Impressive!"</p><p>Chen Xiucai's eyes lit up.  He couldn't help but praise, "I've never seen such figures!  What a shame! What a shame! Are they friends of the Daoist master?"</p><p>"We've never met before, but I've heard of these two gentlemen.  They should be Mr. Yu and Mr. Yi,"</p><p>Qin Sang replied.</p><p>The newcomers seemed to sense something and looked up. The younger man smiled slightly, raising a clay pot in his hand.  "With such fine fruit and dishes, we can't be without good wine! I've brought a pot of hundred-year-old wine.  Might we have a couple of seats upstairs?"</p><p>"Mr. Yu, you're too kind.  It's a pleasure to have friends from afar.  Please come upstairs!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood by the window and instructed Yulang and Xiaowu to greet the guests.</p><p>The newcomers were the City God and the Literary Judge of this county. Qin Sang had already learned their names from the Earth Deity and recognized them immediately.</p><p>The upstairs room wasn't large.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Yu Cheng Huang (City God) and Yi Pan Guan (Literary Judge) sat down.  With the four attendants, it was a little crowded, thankfully no one else came up the mountain.</p><p>The fine wine was opened, its fragrance filling the air.</p><p>They shared a cup, and the initial strangeness between them quickly dissipated.</p><p>Only Yi Pan Guan occasionally glanced at the table, his pupils constricting slightly. He subtly signaled Yu Cheng Huang to pay attention to the dish of spices.</p><p>The fruit was called Jade Dan fruit, which could enhance the cultivation of Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Serving it to ordinary people was already extremely extravagant.</p><p>In the spice powder, there were herbs of even higher quality than the Jade Dan fruit, and other powders they couldn't identify.</p><p>The two exchanged a look, quite surprised, and held the Qingfeng Daoist master in even higher regard.</p><p>Chen Xiucai became even more interested in them.  "May I ask where you two gentlemen are from? You're not from Jien County, are you? Otherwise, I would surely recognize you."</p><p>Mr. Yu smiled, "We are indeed from Jien County, but we don't often appear in public, so it's understandable that Mr. Chen wouldn't recognize us."</p><p>"Two more recluses!"</p><p>Chen Xiucai chuckled self-deprecatingly, taking a drink.  "Compared to the two of you, my so-called seclusion seems like mere posturing."</p><p>"Our talents are limited to this county.  But Mr. Chen possesses the talent to govern the state and pacify the people, the bearing of a nobleman, we cannot compare," Yu Cheng Huang raised his cup in response.</p><p>"By your account, I'm just a simple mountain dweller," Qin Sang also took a sip.</p><p>"You are all extraordinary figures, only I am an ordinary person," Liu Daifu added, raising his cup.</p><p>Yi Pan Guan looked at him and took a sip of wine, saying pointedly, "If you could learn a bit of benevolence from Qingfeng Daoist master, instead of just medicine, it would benefit you for life."</p><p>Liu Daifu was taken aback.</p><p>Chen Xiucai seemed drunk, his eyes hazy. He murmured, "Mr. Yu's words might have been a jest, but scholars who don't serve the country and its people, what are our talents for?"</p><p>Qin Sang swirled the wine in his cup, then paused, his brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, in Jien County town.</p><p>A streak of green light fell in a corner of the town, and a young, pretty girl emerged a moment later.</p><p>A jade bird circled a few times before landing on her shoulder, its eyes bright and full of spiritual energy.</p><p>"So lively!"</p><p>The whole town was filled with the festive atmosphere of the New Year.  The City God Temple Street was even more crowded.</p><p>The girl found everything new and exciting. "The human world is so much better, much livelier than the mountain!  Don't you think so, Xiazhu?"</p><p>The jade bird fluttered its wings and chirped twice.</p><p>"So much delicious food too!"</p><p>The girl looked here and there, her mouth watering, until she stopped in front of a teahouse.</p><p>A loud voice came from inside.</p><p>After listening for a moment, the girl exclaimed, "Is this the storyteller the books talk about? It's New Year's, why is someone still telling stories?"</p><p>The girl didn't notice that her actions had drawn the attention of everyone on the street.</p><p>"Don't they eat during New Year's? That young man inside, he tells great stories," an old woman nearby couldn't help but chime in.</p><p>"Let's go in and listen," the girl stepped across the threshold. (End)</p>
