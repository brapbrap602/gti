<h1>Chapter 1911: The Soul-Falling Abyss</h1><p>From afar, one could see flames floating above Fire Source Valley.</p><p>Thousands of lights flickered, like stars in a river valley.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through it at a glance; these lights weren't naturally occurring, but manifestations of an array.</p><p>Old Ancestor Guan had received Yu Daozi's plea for help. He neither left the valley to save him nor fled, but instead took up a defensive position in his training grounds, waiting for an opportune moment.</p><p>A streak of light, swift as a meteor, approached Fire Source Valley.</p><p>Those within Fire Source Valley sensed the ominous aura, and the countless lights within the valley flickered slightly.</p><p>"What esteemed cultivator graces our humble abode?"</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang landed at the valley entrance, his voice echoing into Fire Source Valley, "This cultivator is Qingfeng. Are you the Old Ancestor Guan that Yu Daozi spoke of?"</p><p>Inside the valley.</p><p>On an exposed red stone, a strange man sat cross-legged.  His exposed head, face, and hands were completely hairless.</p><p>His rough skin was covered in bizarre scars, like those from burns, but black energy occasionally emanated from their surface.</p><p>Whenever black energy spread across a particular area, the flesh there would twitch, a faint blush momentarily suppressing the dark energy.</p><p>This was Old Ancestor Guan!</p><p>He opened his withered eyelids, looked towards the valley entrance, and said in a raspy voice, "It seems Yu Daozi has been killed by you, Daoist. Good riddance!"</p><p>"Oh?  You know why I killed Yu Daozi?"</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back at the valley entrance, his gaze sweeping across the countless lights.</p><p>"Heh heh…"</p><p>Old Ancestor Guan's laughter was as sharp as a ghost's wail, adding a touch of grimness to Fire Source Valley.  "Whatever the reason, that fellow was presumptuous. Provoking you, Daoist, meant death was his due!  Such a fool; keeping him alive would only bring greater trouble to me. So, I say, good riddance!"</p><p>"You are also decisive in matters of life and death."</p><p>Qin Sang looked directly at Fire Source Valley. "It seems those secretly aligned with you are not only Yu Daozi.  The loss of a late-Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't affect you much. No wonder the unrest in the cultivation world is growing, and the Sand Bandit menace is escalating."</p><p>A large array separated the two.</p><p>Yet Old Ancestor Guan felt Qin Sang's gaze like a sharp sword, piercing through the barrier and falling upon him.</p><p>His pupils constricted suddenly.  After a moment of silence, he countered, "I've heard of many powerful cultivators in the Fire Domain, yet never a Daoist Qingfeng.  I ask, to which sect does the Daoist belong?"</p><p>"I belong to no sect; I am a wandering cultivator."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Old Ancestor Guan was momentarily speechless.</p><p>If he were truly a wandering cultivator, why would he come looking for trouble?</p><p>Upon learning of Yu Daozi's sudden demise, Old Ancestor Guan guessed he might have overstepped somewhere, incurring the displeasure of the Three Sects of the Fire Domain, receiving a warning as a result.</p><p>Before this, Old Ancestor Guan had anticipated this. No matter how cautious, since he had intervened, this day would come eventually.</p><p>Old Ancestor Guan believed that as long as he acted cleverly and followed the rules, the Three Sects of the Fire Domain, being powerful and wealthy, wouldn't choose to fight to the death with a mid-Transformation Stage cultivator.</p><p>Old Ancestor Guan assumed Qin Sang was a hidden ancestor of one of the Three Sects of the Fire Domain, perhaps worried about his descendants facing retaliation and unwilling to reveal his identity.</p><p>"Sand bandits, by nature, won't leave the desert. Some truly defy the heavens, disobeying even my orders. Daoist, rest assured, those who lack vision will be dealt with.</p><p>"As for the unrest in the cultivation world, Daoist, you overstate the matter.</p><p>"The Three Sects of the Fire Domain are the overlords of the Fire Domain. I am a single, weak entity; how dare I challenge the authority of the Three Sects? It's simply that some crave the Dao and willingly sought me out, some even harboring malicious intent, using my name to act arrogantly. I've spent years in secluded cultivation, and have been deceived by such villains.</p><p>"If any descendants of the Daoist are among them, I will immediately sever ties and crush their hopes.</p><p>"But those who sincerely aspire to progress, those who are determined to follow me and seek the Dao together, I can't possibly turn them all away.</p><p>"Wouldn't you agree?"</p><p>Old Ancestor Guan had prepared his response, feigning weakness while subtly hinting at hidden strength, his words impeccable.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang knew Old Ancestor Guan had misjudged the situation.</p><p>If it had been anyone else, merely intending to warn Old Ancestor Guan, this response would have been sufficient.</p><p>Unfortunately, Old Ancestor Guan was having a bad year and encountered Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang said nothing more, raising his right hand.</p><p>In an instant, the sky thundered; dark clouds gathered above Fire Source Valley, and the countless lights flickered violently.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>Old Ancestor Guan's expression changed drastically, rapidly trying to figure out which word had been offensive, only to see a brilliant white light above.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The thunder shook the heavens.</p><p>A flash of lightning brewed within the thundercloud.</p><p>All the thunder was mobilized, the cloud erupting with bolts of lightning that danced wildly.</p><p>Spiritual energy surged, thousands of electric serpents and dragons weaving through the thundercloud, forming a vast net of lightning.</p><p>The lightning at the cloud's center possessed an immense pull, drawing in lightning from all directions.</p><p>Like a confluence of rivers, the lightning became increasingly dazzling, transforming into a mysterious thunder seal hanging high in the sky, its inscription faintly visible.</p><p>The scene was somewhat similar to when, in the Talisman Realm, he had borrowed the power of the Thunder Ancestor to cast the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman, but its power was far inferior.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Gu Ancestor’s face paled in alarm.</p><p>A ‘crack’ resounded, revealing every detail of the surrounding mountains, including Fire Source Valley.</p><p>The thunder seal unleashed a terrifying barrage of lightning, like heavenly thunder striking down!</p><p>The myriad sparks floating above Fire Source Valley solidified, then violently shook, extinguishing swathes of light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The mountains trembled.</p><p>Fire Source Valley's protective formation was shattered by the lightning, riddled with breaches.</p><p>Gu Ancestor abruptly rose, his cold eyes filled with terror, vomiting a cloud of blood.</p><p>A pungent smell of blood filled Fire Source Valley, the blood mist swirling with countless pale skeletons and twisted specters.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The blood mist exploded, transforming into a blood cloud, the skeletons and ghosts tumbling within, emitting mournful cries.  Their lingering aura revealed they had all been cultivators in life.</p><p>After spitting up the blood mist, Gu Ancestor’s body was enveloped by dark energy, his breath ragged.</p><p>Forcibly suppressing the dark energy, he attempted to use the blood mist as a defense against the lightning, making a hand gesture, and flickered, attempting to burrow underground.</p><p>At that moment, a five-colored light shot from the valley entrance, striking Gu Ancestor directly.</p><p>The main prohibition of the Five Elements Divine Light; he had no time to react, freezing in place, his face contorted in terror.</p><p>Moments later, the lightning vanished, and the thundercloud gradually dispersed.</p><p>Qin Sang silently contemplated the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman. He had, in effect, received guidance from the Thunder Ancestor; its power now was incomparable to before.</p><p>The High God of the Xuanxiao Palace was the core essence of all the Dao Court's thunder techniques; the deeper one's understanding of the Dao, the easier it was to comprehend the Five Thunder Academy's thunder techniques.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang regained his composure, leading Xiao Wu into the valley, and saw Gu Ancestor, stripped of his ability to resist.</p><p>“I was blind and failed to recognize a master. I am willing to follow the Daoist and serve at your side!”</p><p>Gu Ancestor cried out desperately.</p><p>“Do you have a master, and who instructed you?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Daoist, you have excellent judgment. I was expelled from my sect long ago, and am now unaligned, originally cultivating in Duskfall Mountain. I was later ambushed by scoundrels, forced out of Duskfall Mountain and relocated here.  I have no one behind me…” Gu Ancestor did not dare to hide anything, answering honestly.</p><p>These words also conveyed another meaning: taking him in wouldn't bring about much karmic entanglement; it was like gaining a capable subordinate for free.</p><p>His enemies were somewhat influential, but they certainly couldn't defeat this Daoist.</p><p>Even an ant clings to life.</p><p>Gu Ancestor was hopeful, but he sensed something odd in Qin Sang's expression.</p><p>The other party seemed… disappointed?</p><p>Qin Sang gently shook his head, his tone flat: “I came to kill you, not to negotiate.”</p><p>“Why! We have no grievances, why would you kill me!”</p><p>Gu Ancestor’s anger exploded in a roar.</p><p>He suddenly recalled Qin Sang's earlier questions.</p><p>“Just because of those sand bandits? Just because of those insignificant ants? You are going to act as Heaven’s instrument? Act as Heaven’s instrument!”</p><p>Gu Ancestor’s eyes widened in disbelief, as if looking at a madman, a deep sense of absurdity rising in his heart, bursting into manic laughter.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>“There are countless wicked people in the world, how many cultivators have clean hands, free of the souls of the innocent? Can you kill them all? Can you yourself be completely blameless?”</p><p>“Duskfall Mountain is teeming with demons, why don't you go to Duskfall Mountain and act as Heaven’s instrument! Do you dare to attack the Falling Soul Abyss!”</p><p>His questions echoed through Fire Source Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly looked at Gu Ancestor, his fingertip pointed at Gu Ancestor's forehead, and he said indifferently: “If necessary, I will…”</p><p>The laughter stopped abruptly.</p><p>Gu Ancestor's breath ceased, his eyes retaining a trace of unwillingness.</p><p>“Falling Soul Abyss…”</p><p>Qin Sang softly uttered the three words.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Falling Soul Abyss was the only force in the vicinity that could rival Cloud City Heaven, located deep within Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>Among cultivators of Cloud City Mountain, the Falling Soul Abyss was considered a nest of demons, yet they had coexisted peacefully with Cloud City Heaven for many years, demonstrating the Abyss's strength.</p><p>Both sides use Mulu Mountain as a boundary.  Cultivators from Yun Du Mountain rarely cross it; they avoid conflict.</p><p>Qin Sang understands that Yun Du Tian's supreme master is at the Transcending Void stage of cultivation, but doesn't know if it's early or later stage. No one in Yun Du Mountain dares disobey Yun Du Tian's orders, and no one has ever seen this supreme master make a move. The supreme master is the most powerful cultivator in Yun Du Tian, unless there are hidden Transcending Void cultivators.</p><p>If Luo Hun Abyss and Yun Du Tian are equally strong, or slightly weaker, Qin Sang wouldn't mind causing trouble for them in order to understand the Dao of Killing.  But…</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently.  He had killed from Si Huo Town to Huo Yuan Valley, without mercy towards any evil-doers, from Qi Condensation to Foundation Establishment, even to Yuan Ying and Divine Transformation stages, but still hadn't felt that spark of the Dao.</p><p>"To seek enlightenment so soon after leaving the mountain is too hasty," Qin Sang reflected. The Dao follows its own natural course.  As the saying goes, what you seek diligently often appears unexpectedly. Perhaps without deliberate effort, the way will open naturally.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Xiao Wu, remembering his initial intention of descending the mountain: to dispel Xiao Wu's demonic intent. He dispersed the vengeful spirits in the blood cloud.</p><p>Qin Sang collected the belongings of Old Ancestor Guan, finding many treasures, but none that particularly impressed him. However, some items could be useful. He thought of some treasures related to the Thunder Dao recorded in the Wu Lei Shi Yuan seal.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang and his companions left Huo Yuan Valley. He decided to continue south, but first to eliminate Old Ancestor Guan's remaining followers; a job started must be finished.</p><p>"Next, Shang Xue Palace."  Qin Sang gazed east. Two people, a horse, and a bird sped through the night.</p><p>"Give me a share this time!"  A disgruntled cry came from above.  The Vermillion Bird hadn't had a chance to attack and was restless.</p><p>…</p><p>Unlike other sects, Shang Xue Palace's gate is underground, built around a cold spring. Shang Xue Palace's cultivation techniques are unique, using fiery energy to refine their innate cold energy.  The Palace's founder chose this location, hollowing out the underground area. Numerous ice palaces, arranged around the cold spring, shine with icy blue light in the dark underground space, creating a breathtaking sight.</p><p>That day, Shang Xue Palace was devastated as if by a scorching wind; more than half of the ice palaces collapsed. Shang Xue Palace disciples huddled in the intact areas, looking at their ruined gate and destroyed protective formation. Some were filled with grief, others were dazed.  Everyone saw the shocking sight of numerous crimes carved in blood on an ice wall.</p><p>"Cough… cough…"  By the cold spring, two women supported an old woman, pale and constantly coughing. All three were shaken.  They had claimed it was an internal matter, but the attacker had broken through the gate without hesitation, fortunately only killing the guilty and sparing innocents.</p><p>"Red Grandmother brought this upon herself, implicating the sect. Even if she were to die, I wouldn't let her go! Order everyone not to spread this. I'm going to Liu He Gate…"</p><p>…</p><p>Shang Xue Palace, Gui Long Cave, Qing Bo Mountain, the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds… and various bandit groups like the Thirteen Eagles of Bei Mo.  Qin Sang tirelessly took them on one after another, leaving blood-soaked sands in his wake. The bandit forces were completely eradicated.</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Meng Mountain, one of the Three Mountain Bandit Strongholds. Qin Sang stood on the peak, countless corpses at his feet, blood-written messages covering the surrounding mountain walls.</p><p>"Time to head south…"</p><p>"Daoist, you have a heavy killing intent!"  A voice suddenly came from afar.  On a mountain peak outside Luo Meng Mountain, a burly man had appeared. He was over ten feet tall, imposing, wearing a fiery red robe embroidered with countless runes—clearly a magical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang already knew who it was.  Gazing across the mountains, his eyes held a strange light: "Does the friend believe these bandits shouldn't be killed? Or do they have some connection to you?"</p><p>The man's eyelids twitched. He had personally been to Huo Yuan Valley. Suppressing the urge to retreat, he shook his head repeatedly, disavowing any connection: "Bandits plague the world; everyone should kill them! We’ve long wanted to eliminate them, but were afraid of that demon's power, and dared not act rashly. Thank you, Daoist, for eliminating this menace!"</p><p>After a pause, the man bowed:  "I am Fu Xiao of Liu He Gate!  Would you honor me with a visit, allowing the three sects of the Fire Region to show our hospitality?"</p><p>"The Three Sects of the Fire Region, I've long heard of them. However, I'm going to travel elsewhere.  We'll meet again if fate allows." Qin Sang shook his head, preparing to leave. Liu He Gate was the closest to his current location, and clearly unaware of its new neighbor.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang was leaving, the man breathed a sigh of relief.  He hesitated, then couldn't help asking, "This… is this Yun Du Tian's order?"</p><p>He didn't believe Qin Sang was simply eliminating demons.</p>
