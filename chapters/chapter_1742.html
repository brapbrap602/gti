<h1>Chapter 1733: Legacy of a Transformation God</h1><p>Among the several great regions, the Cang Lang Sea and the Demon Sea were closest to the Ruins of Return. They were the first to discover the Savage Beasts prowling the storm belt, and the frequency of their appearances was higher than in other regions, causing a wave of panic.</p><p>The cultivators of the Cang Lang Sea discovered that the Demon Sea, not far from them, was also connected to the Savage Beasts.</p><p>At that time, cultivators captured a descendant of the Golden Toad Clan in the Demon Sea. This descendant held a high position within the clan, and many secrets were extracted from it through interrogation.</p><p>One piece of information initially went unnoticed: a group of Golden Toad Clan experts encountered a Savage Beast outside the Demon Sea and were nearly annihilated.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not long after, news arrived from the Cang Lang Sea that the same Savage Beast had been sighted near their shores.</p><p>By then, everyone was certain that the Savage Beasts wouldn't actively approach the cultivation world. Before they could breathe a sigh of relief, they realized the threat of the demon race was right at their doorstep.</p><p>Centuries passed, and the Savage Beasts' presence in the storm belt gradually diminished, but the threat remained, a fatal one for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Even cultivators as powerful as Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming dared only cautiously explore the outer regions. Qin Sang flying alone across the boundless storm, traversing several great regions, was something unimaginable to them; he was incredibly daring.</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering the matter of the Immortal Palaces.</p><p>He had a lingering question: what connection existed between the Immortal Palaces and the various cultivation regions?</p><p>Before the Immortal Palaces descended, this world was already as it was. Were the sanctuaries unrelated to the palaces?</p><p>Or was it that, as this world was about to be destroyed by the storm, the Immortal Palaces sensed it and activated an invisible barrier, creating the sanctuaries to protect the world's inhabitants?</p><p>Even more drastically, perhaps the storm itself was brought about by the Immortal Palaces' arrival!</p><p>Now, hearing that the Seven Slaughters Palace had been protecting the Demon Sea and the Cang Lang Sea was the first piece of evidence Qin Sang had found, and also the one he least wanted to see.</p><p>If the power protecting the cultivation world originated from the Immortal Palaces, and the palaces ascended, how long could the barrier against the storm last?</p><p>A mere few centuries was nothing in the cultivation world. Aside from the disappearance of the invisible barrier between the Cang Lang Sea and the Demon Sea, no significant changes had yet been felt.</p><p>But what about after a millennium, ten millennia…?</p><p>Was destruction by the storm the ultimate fate of this small world?</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang seemed to be startled by Zhuo Ming's question. He looked up to see the Bao siblings looking at him curiously. With a slight smile, he took out a jade box from his Spatial Ring. Inside, lay a demon core.</p><p>The three were captivated by the demon core in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The Cang Lang Sea had no shortage of demon cores.</p><p>Countless demon beasts had died at their hands, including many Transformation demons.</p><p>But as they perceived it, no demon core they had ever seen could compare to this one. The difference was in its essence, even though this core's luster appeared somewhat murky, lacking clarity.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Bao Xi hadn't yet grasped the significance, but Zhuo Ming and Bao Zhengnan's expressions suddenly changed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang placed the jade box on the table, generously pushing it towards them. "It was luck. When I encountered it in the storm belt, it had already fought a great battle with other Savage Beasts and was injured…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The three abruptly stood up.</p><p>The demon core before them, and the pressure Qin Sang suddenly emanated, struck their minds like a heavy hammer, leaving them utterly shocked.</p><p>…</p><p>The three remained seated before Qin Sang.</p><p>Bao Xi's eyes still held a trace of bewilderment and disbelief.</p><p>She clearly remembered that back on Yitian Peak, Qin Sang's cultivation was at most comparable to theirs.</p><p>They, especially her brother, had achieved their current accomplishments; anyone in the cultivation world who mentioned him would praise his brilliant strategies and talent in cultivation.</p><p>Upon this reunion, they were still toiling at the Nascent Soul realm, while their old friend had already crossed the most difficult hurdle, leaving them far behind!</p><p>Zhuo Ming sat the most upright, with an added touch of formality.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan, long accustomed to a position of power and widely experienced, coupled with his past relationship with Qin Sang, was momentarily unsure how to treat him. He shook his head repeatedly, "Fellow Daoist Qin, you kept us in the dark!"</p><p>Then, he cupped his fist towards Qin Sang, "Congratulations, Fellow Daoist, on achieving Transformation! The Immortal Path awaits!"</p><p>Bao Xi and Zhuo Ming also offered their congratulations.</p><p>For cultivators of this world, Transformation was enough to be called Transcendence.</p><p>"Transcendence?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly to himself, then his expression turned serious. "I have come here not to boast, but for an important matter."</p><p>The three exchanged glances discreetly.</p><p>With their intelligence, they quickly recovered from the shock Qin Sang had brought, involuntarily pondering the advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Had Qin Sang been only at Nascent Soul late stage, they would have been pleased by their friend's strength.</p><p>But Qin Sang was too powerful, beyond anyone's control, and whether this was beneficial or detrimental to the Cang Lang Sea was yet unknown.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was of human origin. If he were willing to protect humanity and appear on the battlefield, all dangers would be easily resolved. However, they didn't understand Qin Sang's temperament, and as someone from another region, he might not care about the lives of the Cang Lang Sea's people.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan hesitated, "What is this important matter? Speak freely. What others dare not promise, the Four Saints Palace will do its utmost to assist."</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I have come because of the heavenly changes…"</p><p>His purpose was to unite the cultivators of this world. Without any concealment, he recounted the events that had transpired in the Central Continent, beginning with the ascension of the Immortal Palaces and leading into the Demonic Whispers of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>The three were gradually drawn into the flourishing Immortal Path and the Central Continent’s cultivation world teeming with experts. They lamented the death of True Monarch Purple Lightning before suddenly realizing the implications, and they all froze.</p><p>Qin Sang, regardless of their thoughts, explained everything he knew.</p><p>Silence filled the hall for a long while.</p><p>What Qin Sang had described was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Yet, his account was coherent, unlike a fabrication.</p><p>"I wonder if you are familiar with the Karmic Oath. I am willing to erect an altar and swear that every word I have spoken is true," Qin Sang added, then continued in a deep voice, "My purpose here is twofold. First, to unite the cultivators of this world, regardless of whether they are human, demon, or witch, and to cease internal strife, working together to find the Ascension Platform! Second, to request the assistance of all regions' cultivators in searching for the source of the Demonic Whispers of the Heavenly Dao, especially treasures related to the Immortal Palaces…"</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Within the core forbidden grounds of the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang voluntarily requested to set up a ritual altar and, before Bao Zhengnan and the others, swore a Karmic Oath, dispelling their doubts.</p><p>Over these three days, Qin Sang hadn't disturbed Bao Zhengnan, giving them time to digest the news.</p><p>He believed Bao Zhengnan would make the right choice.</p><p>Once cultivators entered the path of cultivation, who didn't yearn for the Immortal Path?  Who would endure countless hardships, cultivating to their level, only for the sake of fighting and killing?</p><p>The oath was complete.</p><p>They returned to the quiet chamber.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan, a decisive man, had already thought it through and made his decision. "Tomorrow, I will personally draft a decree and send it to all sects and factions, summoning them to Tianxing Island to discuss this important matter. The constant fighting between the two regions and three races has caused heavy losses for humanity, and many elders of this palace have been killed or injured. Elders Wu and Xiao were both critically injured by Demon Kings and returned to the palace to heal. All factions are weary and surely long for someone to mediate. As for the Witch Clan and the Demon Clan, how does True Monarch plan to proceed?"</p><p>The hatred between the Demon Clan and the Human Clan ran deep, almost impossible to resolve.</p><p>Even if the Human Clan desired a truce, the Demon Clan wouldn't agree. It would depend on Qin Sang's methods.</p><p>The Human Clan and the Witch Clan were considered allies, but they also had their disagreements, and it would be difficult to bring them together unless it was to discuss a united front against the Demon Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang already knew that the current Great Witch Doctor of the Witch Clan was Old Devil Fang, a man of considerable skill, but even he could only barely hold on against the tide of events.</p><p>A look of relief crossed Qin Sang's face as he said, "Since we are old friends, let us address each other as fellow daoists. I will personally visit the Demon Sea and Witch God Mountain. I believe the Demon and Witch Clans will give me some face."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan sighed, "The resentment between the two regions has grown deeper and deeper, and no one can escape it. If Fellow Daoist can stop this war, it will be a great meritorious deed. These are the scriptures accumulated in the palace over many years. Please take a look, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>With that, Bao Zhengnan took out two mustard seed pouches.</p><p>One was filled with various jade slips and silk books.</p><p>The other contained some treasures.</p><p>"Over the years, a considerable number of treasures have been retrieved from the Seven Slaughters Palace, but most have been refined into pills and magical artifacts, or destroyed in battles.  Not much remains. I don’t know if there are any clues regarding the Demonic Whispers of the Heavenly Dao within."</p><p>He was so forthright because Qin Sang had first offered the formula for the Superior Soul-Calming Incense.</p><p>Qin Sang treated it as a precious treasure, sweeping his divine sense over the treasures and focusing on the contents of the jade slips.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan sat by patiently, waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang examined them one by one, but shook his head repeatedly, his face showing disappointment.</p><p>Putting down the last bamboo scroll, Qin Sang sighed softly, "Forgive my presumption, but did the four Saints leave anything behind in the palace?"</p><p>The Four Saints were the first to discover the Seven Slaughters Palace and obtain its heaven-defying opportunities, their power soaring.  They led the human race, enslaved by the Witch Clan, to become the overlords of the Cang Lang Sea. No one knew the Seven Slaughters Palace better than they.</p><p>The Western Earth Immortal Palace hadn't yet emerged, and the Purple Star Palace had concealed itself.</p><p>The Seven Slaughters Palace, like the Central Continent's Immortal Palaces, had truly emerged and been thoroughly explored. But the Central Continent's Immortal Palaces had changed hands several times, and as Transformation Gods ascended, they continually took treasures from the palaces.</p><p>The Seven Slaughters Palace had always been secretly controlled by the Four Saints Palace, with only one ascendant.  Anything left behind by the Four Saints was extraordinary!</p><p>Qin Sang's question went straight to the core secrets of the Four Saints Palace, which would have been incredibly presumptuous under normal circumstances.</p><p>He gazed at Bao Zhengnan; his formula for the Superior Soul-Calming Incense wasn't so easily obtained.</p><p>With the path of ascension at stake, he didn't want the Four Saints Palace to hide anything from him.</p><p>A flicker of light crossed Bao Zhengnan's eyes, as if he had anticipated this question.</p><p>Did the ancestors of the Four Saints Palace leave behind any relics?</p><p>Of course they did!</p><p>Back then, the Four Saints accidentally released a soul fragment of the Demon Lord. Paying the price of three of them being severely injured and perishing, they sealed the Demon Lord. Bao Gu was the sole survivor, and the only one to ascend.</p><p>Before ascending, Bao Gu had left behind ancestral instructions.  In her cave dwelling, there were things left for her descendants. In the Four Saints Palace, this was referred to as the Ancestral Legacy.</p><p>However, before her departure, Bao Gu had set up a grand formation around that cave, sealing it.</p><p>The ancestral instructions stated that descendants must reach the Transformation stage before opening it.</p><p>The Four Saints were broad-minded.  Bao Gu’s instructions didn’t specifically refer to the descendants of the Four Saints Palace, but to the entire human race. As long as a Transformation cultivator appeared, and their character wasn’t flawed, they could be invited to open the legacy.</p><p>As for whether future generations would abide by the ancestral instructions and hand over their own ancestral legacy, that was another matter.</p><p>After Bao Gu's departure, the Four Saints Palace declined generation after generation, with not a single person achieving Transformation.  Thus, the Ancestral Legacy had remained unopened.</p><p>Over these three days, Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming had carefully weighed their options.</p><p>Not to mention the ancestral instructions already clearly stated it.</p><p>Even if they kept the Ancestral Legacy for themselves, they lacked the ability to open it, making it useless.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan held himself in high regard and harbored ambitions for Transformation, but the news Qin Sang brought had dealt him a blow.  The Immortal Path was about to be severed, so what was the point of guarding the Ancestral Legacy?</p><p>The Four Saints Palace had various speculations about the Ancestral Legacy.</p><p>The most widely believed was that it was related to ascension. There might be complications with ascension; otherwise, their ancestor wouldn’t have set a seal requiring Transformation to open it.</p><p>After deliberation, they finally decided to reveal this matter to Qin Sang.</p><p>It was time for the Ancestral Legacy to be revealed.</p><p>Of course, Bao Zhengnan had conditions. If there were treasures related to breakthrough, Qin Sang couldn't take them away. If it was related to ascension, it should be shared with the Four Saints Palace, but this could only be guaranteed by an oath from Qin Sang.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan slowly began to speak, explaining the reason.</p><p>After listening, a look of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes. He agreed to Bao Zhengnan's conditions without hesitation, swore an oath, and eagerly asked, "Where is Senior's cave dwelling now?"</p><p>"This way, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan led Qin Sang out of the quiet chamber. Zhuo Ming and Bao Xi were already waiting outside.</p><p>The four flew out of the palace complex and arrived at a verdant hillside.</p><p>Before entering the mountain, they smelled a refreshing medicinal fragrance. It was a medicine garden.</p><p>The disciples guarding the garden had been dismissed.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan landed on the top of the hill and pointed to a stone tablet at the summit. "Fellow Daoist Qin, it's here."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's eyes gleaming, fixated on the stone tablet, Bao Zhengnan quickly fell silent and stepped aside.</p><p>The stone tablet was only half a person tall, with no inscriptions, only some complex patterns of unclear meaning. It stood alone in the earth, weathered by time and the elements.</p><p>With insufficient cultivation, standing here wouldn't reveal anything; it was the same for Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's eyes, the patterns on the stone tablet held a hidden mystique.</p><p>"What a profound formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>Bao Gu had left the treasures to be opened by her descendants, so breaking the seal here wasn't difficult, especially with the help of Qin Sang's Celestial Eye Butterfly.  He quickly found the key.</p><p>He was marveling at Bao Gu's deep mastery of formations.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of the three, Qin Sang extended his right hand, pressing it against the center of the stone tablet. True Essence flowed from his palm, tracing the patterns on the stone tablet, following a certain rhythm.</p><p>In an instant, the patterns shimmered with faint light, and the stone tablet became transparent, almost ethereal.</p><p>Before Bao Zhengnan and the others could clearly see the runes appearing within the tablet, they felt a sudden disorientation.  When they regained their senses, they found themselves no longer on the hillside, but transported into a hall.</p><p>The hall wasn't large, with a landscape screen placed in the center.</p><p>On the right were a meditation cushion and an incense burner, the latter empty of spirit incense.</p><p>Since it was Bao Gu's cave dwelling, this was likely where she cultivated and meditated.</p><p>On the left were chairs and cups, presumably for receiving guests.</p><p>The furnishings were simple but not crude, refined and elegant.</p><p>Time had stood still in this cave dwelling for thousands of years. Standing there, one could almost sense the lingering presence of its owner.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the others glanced around the cave, their attention drawn to a jade slip left on the table.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan's expression shifted slightly. He hesitated for a moment, then looked towards Qin Sang, only to find him staring intently at the screen. Following his gaze, they saw that he was looking at a full moon depicted within the landscape.</p><p>Only then did Bao Zhengnan notice the anomaly.  This full moon wasn’t part of the landscape painting; it was like a luminous sphere embedded within it, its moonlight constantly flowing, and within the moon, another world existed!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin?"</p><p>Bao Zhengnan couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the table and accessed the jade slip.  The words that met his eyes read:  The Path of Ascension is arduous, its mysteries unknown.  Descendants opening this cave shall receive my gifts and inherit my will, paving the way forward for humanity!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
