<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang had already made some preparations.</p><p>Including two third-transformation spirit insects, the Blazing Fire Silkworm and the Crimson Wasteland Worm.</p><p>The Blazing Fire Silkworm thrives in magma, while the Crimson Wasteland Worm is more active on the edges of magma, hiding in gray crevices, devouring the fire spirits within the magma to survive.</p><p>These two types of spirit insects are relatively common species in the cultivation world and share similar habits. With good luck, both could be captured at once.</p><p>But the transformation of spirit insects is a long and arduous process.</p><p>Qin Sang required two spirit insects, at least at the mid-third transformation stage, which were even harder to find than mid-Nascent Soul cultivators.  Personally searching would take an unknown amount of time, so he commissioned Jiang Mu to post a bug-hunting task at the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>Because Qin Sang offered a high price, it was said to have attracted many late-Nascent Soul cultivators.  In just over a month, both spirit insects were delivered to Qin Sang.</p><p>For more than ten years, Qin Sang had been feeding them Fire Melting Pills and other elixirs.  The Blazing Fire Silkworm reached the late-third transformation stage, while the Crimson Wasteland Worm reached the peak of the mid-third transformation stage.</p><p>They would serve as consumables for the Fire Jade Centipede's transformation.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang still needed to help the Crimson Wasteland Worm advance.</p><p>Third-transformation spirit insects are quite rare. Consuming two late-third transformation spirit insects to boost the Fire Jade Centipede's transformation seems extravagant.</p><p>But this was only because the Fire Jade Centipede had already consumed numerous heavenly treasures, and its cultivation had already reached the peak of the late-third transformation stage, just one step away from transformation. Otherwise, it would require even more.</p><p>The art of Gu cultivation is essentially accumulating a large number of resources to achieve qualitative change, consuming other spirit insects.</p><p>However, these two spirit insects were not extraordinary, their potential almost exhausted. Unless a special opportunity arose, the possibility of them transforming to the fourth stage in the future was negligible. In Qin Sang's view, there was nothing to regret.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang had prepared most of the elixirs listed in the *Gu Classic*.</p><p>Either acquiring them himself or through major trading companies, he gathered the spirit herbs and then hired alchemists to refine them.</p><p>Only one type of elixir, called Dream Dispersal Powder, had two main ingredients with no news for a long time. Later, inquiries revealed that the main ingredients were produced in the Savage Continent and monopolized by the Myriad Venom Mountain.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dream Dispersal Powder was essential. It could neutralize the ferocious Qi of Gu insects to a certain extent.  Qin Sang estimated that he needed to prepare at least three doses for the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>He could only purchase it from Myriad Venom Mountain.</p><p>Dream Dispersal Powder is not only useful in Gu cultivation, but cultivators can also use it to lure and appease spirit insects when subduing them, increasing the chances of success.</p><p>Myriad Venom Mountain occasionally releases a batch, but the price is extremely high.</p><p>Qin Sang only decided to purchase it after confirming the secret technique was usable.</p><p>Seven Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p>Although not as renowned as the Six Continents Hall, it is a prominent trading company in the Central Continent, with its influence reaching farther than the Six Continents Hall.  Their branches can be seen in large market towns of the Northern Wasteland.  Rumor has it that they have close ties with Myriad Venom Mountain.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, these were not secrets.  Anyone who cared to inquire could find out.</p><p>The B District of the Immortal City was where trading companies gathered, and there was a Seven Fragrance Pavilion there.</p><p>The B District was bustling with people.</p><p>In front of each trading company, there were crowds of people, and cultivators came and went constantly.</p><p>The Seven Fragrance Pavilion was a seven-story jade building constructed from a type of dark green jade, radiating a hazy green light.</p><p>Various mounts were tied to the jade pillars in front of the building: dragons, phoenixes, qilins â€“ a dazzling array. All had been completely tamed, lying lazily, dozing on the pillars.</p><p>Qin Sang disguised himself and strolled along a jade bridge to the jade pavilion, then stepped inside.</p><p>Inside the Seven Fragrance Pavilion was another world. Treasures filled the display cases, mostly elixirs and poisons.  At the entrance stood a dozen attendants and maids, all cultivators, with cultivation levels at the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>"Welcome, honored guest!"</p><p>As Qin Sang entered, a maid immediately greeted him with a smile, swaying her waist.  Just as she was about to approach, a deep voice suddenly rang in her ear.</p><p>"Please invite this senior upstairs."</p><p>The maid was startled, the smile on her face stiffening slightly. Fortunately, it wasn't her first time experiencing this, and she didn't lose her composure.  She bowed and said, "Please, senior."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the voice transmission, his expression unchanged. He followed the maid upstairs and saw a white-robed man hurrying down from the second floor. He said to the maid, "You may leave."</p><p>Then he bowed to Qin Sang, "Senior's presence honors us.  This junior apologizes for not welcoming you sooner.  I hope senior will forgive me. The treasures downstairs are surely beneath your notice. Please follow me to the quiet room for a detailed discussion."</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed. He followed the man to the fifth floor, where spirit tea and immortal fruits had already been prepared.</p><p>The two sat facing each other. The white-robed man was about to exchange pleasantries, but Qin Sang didn't want to waste time.  He interrupted the man, scrutinized him, and got straight to the point: "This Daoist wishes to acquire something from your esteemed pavilion. Are you in a position to make a decision?"</p><p>The white-robed man smiled apologetically. "This junior is the manager of the Seven Fragrance Pavilion. I can decide on most matters within the pavilion. If senior's request exceeds my authority, I will immediately report to the pavilion elders and ensure senior receives a satisfactory response."</p><p>Trading companies had branches all over the Central Plains. It was impossible for every branch to have a Nascent Soul cultivator stationed there.</p><p>For example, the Six Continents Hall in Smokewater Market. The original manager was a Golden Core cultivator. Because Mount Bunian was sealed and the Zhuo Province was unstable, the Six Continents Hall sent Jiang Mu to take charge.</p><p>Once the situation in the Zhuo Province stabilized, they transferred Jiang Mu back.</p><p>Only the Immortal City of Flying Cloud Ferry, due to its strategic importance, had a Nascent Soul cultivator stationed there at all times.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, and said calmly, "This Daoist wants to buy Dream Dispersal Powder."</p><p>The smile on the white-robed man's face froze. He immediately stood up and said, "Please wait a moment, senior."</p><p>Not long after the white-robed man left, someone knocked on the door.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the door and saw an elderly man with white hair and a youthful face enter. A flash of surprise crossed his eyes.</p><p>He was actually at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  Could he be the Pavilion Master of the Seven Fragrance Pavilion?</p><p>The elderly man was also sizing up Qin Sang, and upon realizing he couldn't see through Qin Sang's cultivation, he felt a sense of awe. He laughed heartily, "This old man was in secluded cultivation. Unfortunately, I was late in receiving you, fellow Daoist."</p><p>"It is this Daoist who is intruding."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and returned the greeting.</p><p>After some pleasantries, the elderly man still wanted to probe Qin Sang's background, but Qin Sang deflected him subtly.</p><p>Seeing this, the elderly man stopped wasting his efforts and pondered for a moment. "Fellow Daoist wishes to purchase Dream Dispersal Powder. You should know that this elixir is controlled by the Myriad Venom Mountain. They only release a small amount every once in a while, and it's extremely rare in the outside world, very precious."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>The elderly man's expression remained unchanged, but his tone shifted, "Our pavilion does have some in stock, but such a sought-after treasure is limited in quantity. I wonder how much fellow Daoist needs? Do you intend to barter, or purchase with spirit stones?"</p><p>"At least three portions!"</p><p>Qin Sang held up three fingers. "As for the method of transaction, it depends on the quality of the Dream Dispersal Powder."</p><p>Dream Dispersal Powder is divided into three grades: high, medium, and low. Both medium and high grades are effective, only with varying degrees. The low grade is basically useless for the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Hearing this, the elderly man knew that Qin Sang had come prepared. He put aside his other thoughts and took out three porcelain bottles from his storage pouch, placing them on the table.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the bottles and examined them one by one.</p><p>The bottles contained white powder, indeed Dream Dispersal Powder. One of the bottles had a slightly yellowish tint, indicating it was medium grade, while the other two were high grade.</p><p>These three bottles of Dream Dispersal Powder were basically enough.</p><p>The elderly man watched Qin Sang's actions, and suddenly smiled, "Congratulations, fellow Daoist!"</p><p>"What is there to congratulate?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist purchasing three bottles of Dream Dispersal Powder at once must mean you have encountered a fourth-transformation spirit insect, right? Isn't that a joyous occasion?" the elderly man said with envy.</p><p>Other insect control secret techniques, unlike the *Gu Classic*, didn't have such serious drawbacks and weren't so demanding.</p><p>The elderly man didn't know that Qin Sang possessed half of the *Gu Classic* and misunderstood his purpose.</p><p>In the cultivation world, third-transformation spirit insects could still be found, but naturally transformed fourth-transformation spirit insects were extremely rare. Moreover, such spirit insects had extremely high potential. Even Myriad Venom Mountain, which dominated the Savage Continent, hadn't seen many.</p><p>Encountering one didn't guarantee capture, and capturing one didn't guarantee subjugation.</p><p>The elderly man naturally envied Qin Sang's opportunity.</p><p>After carefully examining each bottle, Qin Sang put them down and replied seemingly casually, "Spirit insects have limited abilities. Even fourth-transformation spirit insects are mostly useless. This Daoist has paid such a high price and worked for many years, and I'm still not sure if it will be of any help to me.  If only it were like the spirit insect of a fellow Daoist I encountered before.  With just a single poisonous light, it could easily kill a fellow cultivator of the same rank. It was the most terrifying spirit insect I've ever seen!"</p><p>"Killed a Nascent Soul with poison?"</p><p>The elderly man's expression changed drastically, his voice urgent, "What kind of poisonous light? What did that spirit insect look like?"</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his expression unchanged, pretending to recall carefully for a moment.  He said, "The poisonous light flashed by in an instant. I remember it being milky white. As for that spirit insect, it seemed to be a jade-like beetle. Hehe...This Daoist has always suspected it belonged to some expert from Myriad Venom Mountain.  Does fellow Daoist recognize it?"</p><p>"Jade beetle...Jade beetle..."</p><p>The elderly man muttered to himself, then suddenly seemed to remember something.  He asked repeatedly, "Who was controlling the jade beetle? Where did fellow Daoist encounter him?"</p><p>There was definitely something going on!</p><p>After seeing the *Gu Classic*, Qin Sang had been pondering the relationship between the scarred-faced man and his disciple and Myriad Venom Mountain, but Myriad Venom Mountain didn't have such a figure publicly.</p><p>He suspected the *Gu Classic* had questionable origins and made a slight probe, unexpectedly uncovering what seemed to be a bigger secret.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, looking at the elderly man with a smile, glancing at the porcelain bottles on the table.</p><p>The elderly man paused, then understood. He gritted his teeth and said, "If fellow Daoist can provide this old man with useful information, these Dream Dispersal Powders can be gifted to you."</p><p>Qin Sang finally relented and said thoughtfully, "That person's methods were ruthless, instantly killing a Nascent Soul cultivator.  This Daoist only dared to observe from afar at the time, how would I dare approach? I vaguely saw that the man's face was covered in scars, very strange. As for his origins, fellow Daoist can search in the border region between the two Southern Savage Continents..."</p><p>As he spoke, he channeled his spiritual power, drawing a simplified map of the two Southern Savage Continents in the air, outlining a large area.</p><p>The elderly man stammered.  Qin Sang wasn't clear about the grudge between them and deliberately combined his two encounters with the scarred-faced man, guiding them to find the scarred-faced man's hiding place. That would be enough.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt that the scarred-faced man was most likely no longer in the Poison Miasma Basin.</p><p>The elderly man committed it to memory and said seriously, "Fellow Daoist must have guessed. This old man's other identity is an elder of Myriad Venom Mountain.  The person you speak of has a long-standing feud with our sect.  Two of our Nascent Soul elders tragically died at his hands. If fellow Daoist encounters this person in the future, please inform our sect immediately.  There will be a handsome reward!"</p><p>"The grudge between you and him has nothing to do with this Daoist.  That person's spirit insect is too ferocious. This Daoist values his life and doesn't want to encounter him again, nor do I want to provoke such a powerful enemy."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, collected the porcelain bottles, and stood up to leave.</p><p>The elderly man hurriedly stopped Qin Sang, "Please wait a moment, fellow Daoist."</p><p>With that, the elderly man hurried out the door and hurried back, carrying a jade box.</p><p>The jade box opened, revealing layers of restrictions covering a gray thread as thin as hair.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a gray down feather, unknown from what creature.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at it for a long while, unable to discern anything, his face showing a questioning expression.</p><p>The elderly man pushed the jade box towards Qin Sang. "That person was arrogant and conceited back then. He was struck by a supreme treasure of our sect, the poison entering his internal organs.  If not for his profound cultivation, he would have perished long ago. The strange scars on his face are a result of the poisoning. This item contains a portion of the power of the supreme treasure. If fellow Daoist encounters him in the future, you can activate this item to trigger the residual poison in his body, surely causing him to be preoccupied. You can then take the opportunity to escape!  Of course, if fellow Daoist can slay this person and capture the Jade Beetle alive, bringing the Jade Beetle back to Myriad Venom Mountain, our sect will exchange it for a valuable treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, so that's how it is.</p><p>No wonder a great cultivator like him couldn't even restore his appearance.</p><p>Myriad Venom Mountain's sect treasure actually forced a great cultivator into such a state.  The foundation of renowned sects is truly unfathomable!</p><p>Qin Sang reminded himself, frowning, "It has been decades since this Daoist encountered him. That person is a late-Nascent Soul cultivator. After so long, will this item still be effective?"</p><p>"The scars on that person's face haven't faded, indicating the residual poison hasn't been purged. It will definitely be effective!  If it were so easy to dispel, would it still be considered a supreme treasure of our sect?"</p><p>The elderly man was full of confidence. "The residual poison lies dormant in his body. As long as it isn't triggered, it won't cause much harm. That person is focused on nurturing the Jade Beetle, which will consume a great deal of his energy. He won't have the spare energy to purge the residual poison before the Jade Beetle matures."</p><p>Qin Sang claimed he only observed from afar.</p><p>But the elderly man knew better. The battles of great cultivators weren't something anyone could simply observe. Moreover, the scarred-faced man provoked a great enemy like Myriad Venom Mountain.  If there was any risk of his whereabouts being exposed, he would definitely silence witnesses.</p><p>They might have already fought a great battle.</p><p>Qin Sang being alive and well indicated that his abilities were not weak, at least.</p><p>Creating this kind of down feather would temporarily diminish some of the supreme treasure's power, which would recover over time. Giving one away wasn't a big deal.  The elderly man saw Qin Sang's wariness towards them and didn't expose him, but he didn't mind gaining an ally.</p><p>He wasn't worried that the Jade Beetle would be snatched away by Qin Sang.</p><p>Regardless of whether Qin Sang could kill the scarred-faced man, aside from Myriad Venom Mountain and the scarred-faced man who personally cultivated the Jade Beetle, no one else had the ability to tame it.  If Qin Sang obtained it, he could only seal it.</p><p>Sealing it for a long time carried the risk of the Jade Beetle exploiting a weakness and backfiring on him.</p><p>The best option was to trade with Myriad Venom Mountain.</p><p>"Then this Daoist will gratefully accept!"</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the jade box, bowed slightly, and turned to leave.</p><p>The elderly man personally escorted Qin Sang out of the Seven Fragrance Pavilion and returned to the quiet room, closing his eyes to meditate.</p><p>Not long after.</p><p>A shadowy figure appeared in the quiet room.</p><p>"Lost him?"</p><p>The elderly man asked calmly, seemingly not surprised at all.</p><p>The shadowy figure hummed, "That person's spiritual sense is acute.  I followed him for less than a hundred zhang before I faintly felt him lock onto me, giving a warning."</p><p>"Very good! The higher the cultivation, the better!  I didn't expect that guy to actually cultivate the Gu King.  We can't continue to suppress the news. Otherwise, relying solely on the sect's power will inevitably result in heavy losses...I will personally report to the Sect Master."</p><p>The elderly man said.</p>
