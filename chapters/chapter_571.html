<h1>Chapter 564: Sudden Change</h1><p>Besides the Thunder Swallowing Falcon, it was unlikely for any outsiders to pry, and the two were certain no one would dare to set up a teleportation formation under the Falcon's watchful eye, so they stopped hiding and used their best skills to slay demons.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang glanced sideways at the demon cultivators of the Heavenly Demon Mound. Not finding the Falcon meant that although they were both demon cultivators, the Mound and the Boundless Valley were not aligned.</p><p>Even if the two couldn't kill the Falcon, they didn't have to worry about exposing their identities.</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and he subconsciously looked at Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi was looking back at him, his expression also somewhat serious.</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved. He was hesitant about whether to tell Duke Dongyang about this matter.</p><p>Firstly, it was difficult to explain why he, only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage back then, was in the depths of the Boundless Valley and saw the two leaders of the Wuji Sect without being discovered.</p><p>Secondly, these were just suspicions. Without evidence, recklessly gossiping about Nascent Soul cultivators might bring reprimands and ruin Duke Dongyang's impression of him.</p><p>He hoped he was just being overly worried.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang hesitated, he suddenly heard Yun Youzi's voice transmission.</p><p>"Brother Qin, are you sure it was him?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback, realizing Yun Youzi was asking him to confirm whether the other black-robed figure was indeed the Wuji Sect leader.</p><p>Yun Youzi hadn't seen the two Nascent Soul cultivators battling the Thunder Swallowing Falcon and couldn't confirm the Wuji Sect Leader's identity.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know why Yun Youzi asked him. After thinking for a moment, he replied, "Yes!"</p><p>He didn't offer further explanation.</p><p>Yun Youzi didn't ask more either, saying, "Brother Qin, if it's difficult for you to explain, I'll do it."</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and nodded.</p><p>Yun Youzi turned and walked to Daoist Chongyi. After bowing, he moved his lips slightly and said something.</p><p>Then, Daoist Chongyi drew a sliver of light from his jade ruyi, enveloping Yun Youzi. Listening attentively for a moment, he nodded slightly, his expression unchanged, and waved for Yun Youzi to retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang observed silently for a while, but didn't see Daoist Chongyi take any action, so he stopped thinking about it.</p><p>After a while, all the Nascent Soul Grandmasters were ready.</p><p>Patriarch Chifa and Daoist Zhenyi suddenly acted together, opening a gap in the star chart and shouting, "Those holding the Purple Star Secret Tokens, quickly enter the formation!"</p><p>Upon receiving the order, no one dared to hesitate.  Those holding the tokens were already standing together, and upon hearing the command, they rushed towards the Little North Star Formation.</p><p>After everyone entered, the formation closed, and then the star chart began to rotate, slowly drifting forward as it turned.</p><p>Everyone was under the protection of the formation, approaching the eye of the storm together.</p><p>The star chart stabilized the swirling vortex.</p><p>Facing the impact of the eye, although the star chart appeared less stable, it still firmly protected them, reassuring everyone.</p><p>They proceeded unimpeded and quickly approached the direction the Feathered Demon King had indicated. There, faint clouds drifted, completely obscuring the immortal formation.</p><p>Patriarch Chifa and Daoist Zhenyi, leading at the forefront, simultaneously struck the Little North Star Formation with their palms.</p><p>The North Star shone brightly, suddenly shooting out a beam of starlight.</p><p>Like an arrow, the starlight pierced through the sea of stars and into the void.</p><p>*Boom*</p><p>Mysterious runes reappeared, and the vast immortal formation once again manifested before everyone.</p><p>The starlight shot into the immortal formation, but only caused ripples among the runes, failing to breach it.</p><p>Undeterred, Patriarch Chifa and Daoist Zhenyi continued to activate the Little North Star Formation, shooting out even thicker beams of starlight, continuously bombarding a single point on the immortal formation.</p><p>Accompanied by thunderous booms.</p><p>The fluctuations of the immortal formation intensified, and cracks finally began to appear in the runes.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The immortal formation finally cracked open, revealing a deep passage. The surrounding runes quickly drifted towards the opening, attempting to repair the formation, but inevitably leaving gaps.</p><p>Patriarch Chifa was overjoyed at the sight and waved his long arm, "Enter the formation!"</p><p>Myriad stars within the star chart twinkled.</p><p>The star chart flickered, rushing into the opening of the immortal formation in the nick of time. Almost the instant they entered, the opening closed, and the immortal formation returned to its original state.</p><p>*Whoosh...*</p><p>The next moment, everything before them suddenly darkened.</p><p>They had entered an endless gale.</p><p>Heaven and earth were a hazy yellow, with howling winds making it impossible to move.</p><p>This was no ordinary wind, but a soul-eroding divine wind. Deep within the gale, all was chaos, nothing visible.</p><p>The terrifying force of the wind slammed against the Little North Star Formation.</p><p>Gasps arose.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest, his blood churning. The Beast Seal Formation formed by the five of them nearly dispersed. Fortunately, a peculiar force subtly transmitted over, protecting them and stabilizing their footing.</p><p>"Chenyan is secretly helping."</p><p>Qin Sang realized, shocked by the power of the immortal formation.</p><p>Even with the Little North Star Formation shielding them from above, Duke Dongyang's protection beside them, and the Beast Seal Formation, they still couldn't withstand the onslaught of the divine wind. No wonder the others were certain they were doomed, looking on with amusement.</p><p>After the initial impact, the Little North Star Formation paused slightly before proceeding against the divine wind.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered countless types of divine wind.</p><p>There was a bone-chilling icy wind, no less potent than the Black Frost Wind.</p><p>There was a ghostly wind that sounded like the wails of a thousand spirits.</p><p>There was an extremely yang divine wind that could incinerate the heavens and boil the seas, with a hidden sun within its raging gusts.</p><p>There was also a seemingly calm wind, without a visible breath, yet upon contact, it nearly annihilated a corner of the Little North Star Formation â€“ the Void Wind.</p><p>...</p><p>This feast of divine winds showcased many only seen in ancient texts, even some unheard-of, all making their appearances within the immortal formation, ever-changing.</p><p>They had been within the immortal formation for a long time, yet still couldn't see the end.</p><p>Seeing the Little North Star Formation remain stable, weathering every danger, Qin Sang was relieved and began to appreciate the divine winds of the immortal formation.</p><p>It was unimaginable where the ancient cultivators had found so many strange divine winds and tamed them, sealing them within the immortal formation as a protective measure.</p><p>It was said that these divine winds were only a small fraction of the remaining power of the immortal formation after the Purple Star Palace's ruin. In the complete formation, the divine winds were merely one of the trials.</p><p>And these weren't even complete.</p><p>The Little North Star Formation was like a lone sail in the vast void, sailing alone, with no end in sight.</p><p>After passing through another Netherworld Demonic Wind, they plunged into darkness, eerily calm.</p><p>Everyone was on high alert. The previous encounter with the Void Wind had been just like this. Their carelessness led to a brush with a powerful gust, nearly causing disaster.</p><p>"The Heavenly Gate is ahead!"</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>Deep within the endless void, a faint white light appeared, the outline of the Heavenly Gate flickering in and out of view.</p><p>"The final trial!"</p><p>Everyone rejoiced, letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Little North Star Formation cautiously navigated the gaps between the Void Winds, almost reaching the edge of the immortal formation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at this moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>A strange fluctuation appeared ahead, as if something spread through the darkness, blocking their path!</p>
