<h1>Chapter 1476: Ascending Spirit (4k)</h1><p>Shi Xue publicly announced Qin Sang's status as a guest elder, drawing respectful gazes.  The story of how Qingfeng Daozhang, urged by Tong Lingyu, infiltrated the demon nest alone, delivered crucial intelligence, and achieved great merit, has recently spread throughout Xuantian Palace, portraying him as a courageous hero.</p><p>Facing praise from two other Yuan Ying cultivators, Qin Sang felt slightly embarrassed, repeatedly claiming to be unworthy. However, the disciples' respectful gazes quickly vanished when Shi Xue announced Qingfeng Daozhang's upcoming wedding to Liu Li, with the ceremony scheduled soon.  Even veiled, Liu Li's beauty was undeniable. Since her return to the Listening Snow Tower, disciples were captivated by her, even more so than during her time at Shao Hua Mountain.  To them, Liu Li embodied the image of a celestial fairy, her aloof demeanor truly like a fairy from the Moon Palace.  They were content just to catch a glimpse of her on occasion.</p><p>Now, however, their fairy was being drawn into the mortal world by a man, causing considerable displeasure.  Even more frustrating was the fact that the Sect Master had ordered them to prepare for the wedding, making them frantically busy.  Most frustrating of all, they dared not utter a word of complaint.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the tense atmosphere, recalling his time at Shao Hua Mountain and the infatuation of Senior Brother Zhuang Yan with Liu Li’s portrait. He only learned of Zhuang Yan's passing from Mu Yifeng; Zhuang Yan had died some time ago, thankfully leaving behind a granddaughter with considerable talent, whom Mu Yifeng intended to cultivate, with Qin Sang arranging for Li Yu Fu to assist.</p><p>“Thank you, everyone,” Qin Sang chuckled awkwardly, bowing to express his gratitude before hastily leaving the Listening Snow Tower with Liu Li.  They soared into the sky, heading towards Lingxiao Peak.</p><p>Before meeting the Palace Master, they needed to visit Elder Jiang. Elder Jiang was Bing Yao’s senior brother, reportedly the top disciple of Bing Yao’s generation. Though talented, his cultivation had peaked at mid-Yuan Ying stage, stagnating for many years. Bing Yao, essentially, grew up under his watchful eye.  He held immense prestige not only within the Listening Snow Tower, but throughout Xuantian Palace and beyond, a highly respected veteran powerhouse.</p><p>Each branch of Xuantian Palace, especially the four major branches, sent their strongest cultivators to serve as elders or hall masters, maintaining their influence within the palace.  According to the rules, these individuals were to be impartial, treating all branches equally, and could no longer serve as branch masters.  Had he not come to Lingxiao Peak and become the Yuanji Hall Master, the position of Listening Snow Tower Master would have been his.  Currently, Shi Xue consulted Elder Jiang before making any major decisions.  Even when Qin Sang was invited as a guest elder to the Listening Snow Tower, the Grand Elder had to personally visit Elder Jiang to discuss the matter, highlighting his status.</p><p>Yuanji Hall was named after its location atop one of the Seventy-Two Springs, the Yuanji Spring.  This spring was said to produce pearls, excellent materials for refining weapons and pills; thus, Yuanji Hall was responsible for the alchemy, weaponry, formations, and other external affairs of Xuantian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang had long wished to visit Elder Jiang.  Combining his cultivation of weapon refinement and formations, he aimed to study the Palace's vast collection of texts.</p><p>Yuanji Spring.  Qin Sang and Liu Li descended, seeing the ancient hall in the center of the lake, surrounded by numerous smaller structures. The hall, situated on an island, was shaded by lush trees, exuding tranquility.  From time to time, cultivators would arrive or depart, all disciples of Xuantian Palace studying external arts, the lowest being at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Approaching Yuanji Hall, even while conversing, these disciples instinctively fell silent, their expressions solemn. Liu Li’s fame was widespread, so to avoid attracting attention, Qin Sang and Liu Li disguised themselves slightly, joining the disciples at the entrance of Yuanji Hall before proceeding inside.</p><p>However, they were still noticed.  Having just passed through the gate, they saw an elderly man with white hair and a cane appear before them.  The busy disciples, upon seeing him, revealed surprised expressions, bowing respectfully, “Disciple greets Hall Master.”</p><p>“You may leave. Do not waste your time.” Elder Jiang nodded at them, offering a brief encouragement, then turned to Qin Sang, bowing slightly, “Are you Daoist Qingfeng?”</p><p>The disciples bowed and retreated, stealing glances at Qin Sang, speculating about the identities of these two who were being personally greeted by the Hall Master.</p><p>“Qingfeng is my name. I greet Elder Jiang.” Qin Sang returned the bow.</p><p>“Greetings, Grand Uncle Jiang.” Liu Li also bowed respectfully, handing Elder Jiang Shi Xue's letter.</p><p>Jiang, the Palace Master, unfolded the document, his brow furrowing slightly. He looked at Qin Sang, then at Liuli, and said kindly, “We’re family now. No need for formalities. Come with me.”</p><p>The three strolled among ancient trees and palace buildings.</p><p>They arrived at a quiet courtyard.</p><p>Jiang suddenly stopped, looked up at the sky, his gaze profound, as if lost in remembrance. After a long moment, he said, “I’ve long heard of Qingfeng Daochang’s abilities, and I pale in comparison. His joining us is a great boon to both the Listening Snow Pavilion and Xuan Tian Palace. Shi Xue told me you and Liuli met in humble circumstances. Liuli is my junior sister’s most prized disciple. Since she trusts you, I trust her judgment. I won’t interfere in your affairs; I don't want you to think this old man talks too much. However, I really didn't want to agree to this absurd arrangement. A fake marriage barely restrains the Daochang, and the Heart Demon Oath has loopholes.”</p><p>Meeting Jiang’s intense gaze, Qin Sang replied calmly, “I always abide by one principle – my word is my bond.”</p><p>They stared at each other.</p><p>After a long silence…</p><p>Jiang nodded slightly. “I’ve sent a message to the Grand Elder. She will take you to Lingxiao Peak to meet the Palace Master.”</p><p>This was his tacit approval.</p><p>For the Listening Snow Pavilion, Liuli was their only hope.</p><p>Liuli’s failed breakthrough meant the Pavilion had lost its eligibility.</p><p>Rejecting Qin Sang meant surrendering the opportunity to the other three sects.  The Pavilion’s decline would only worsen.</p><p>If Qin Sang gained the Palace Master’s approval and the right to use the Cleansing Pool, even a fleeting marriage would forge a beneficial connection for the Listening Snow Pavilion.</p><p>According to Shi Xue, this man, despite only being at the mid-Yuan Ying stage of cultivation, possessed the strength of a great cultivator, already a regional power, and his future was limitless.</p><p>Jiang had been skeptical, but confirmation from Tong Lingyu had convinced him.</p><p>The three waited in the courtyard.</p><p>Soon, a fragrant breeze arrived, and Tong Lingyu appeared gracefully.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and Liuli, her beautiful eyes lit up.  Raising a delicate hand, she smiled demurely, “What a handsome couple! Thankfully, I asked Palace Master Jiang and Master Shi for help, inviting the Daochang as a guest of the Listening Snow Pavilion, otherwise I would have missed this wonderful match!”</p><p>The fake marriage was naturally not revealed to Tong Lingyu.</p><p>She assumed they were reunited lovers, and smiled playfully.</p><p>Qin Sang returned her greeting.</p><p>After some pleasantries…</p><p>“Since you’re becoming Dao companions, I'm practically your matchmaker, so I have no objections.  However, it's only right to meet the Palace Master.”</p><p>Tong Lingyu stood. “No time to waste. Come, let's go to Lingxiao Peak.”</p><p>The three took leave of Jiang, flying towards the center of the Seventy-Two Springs, soon reaching the foot of Lingxiao Peak.</p><p>Even with the Grand Elder escorting them, they were still subject to the guards’ inspection before being allowed into the mountain.</p><p>They reached a pavilion halfway up the mountain.</p><p>“Wait here, I’ll go ahead.”</p><p>Tong Lingyu left them, surprisingly not asking Qin Sang to remove his Thousand Fox mask.  Her tone was odd.  “Don't be nervous, the Palace Master has been in seclusion for years, she may not have time to see you.”</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance.</p><p>The Palace Master refusing to receive them suited them perfectly.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the Palace Master, but he didn't want to cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p>As they spoke, Tong Lingyu moved swiftly, disappearing from sight.</p><p>At the summit of Lingxiao Peak…</p><p>A jade screen was embedded in the cliff face, south-facing, smooth as a mirror.</p><p>Before the screen was a small lake, with crystal-clear water and two golden carp swimming peacefully. The surface was still, unusually quiet, and there were no guards nearby.</p><p>Tong Lingyu arrived at the lakeside, bowed to the screen, and called out clearly, “Tong Lingyu greets the Palace Master.”</p><p>There was no response from within the jade screen.</p><p>Tong Lingyu stood motionless, showing no impatience.</p><p>After an indeterminate time…</p><p>A slightly hoarse voice came from within, “Lingyu, you’ve come.”</p><p>The voice was extremely calm, devoid of emotion.</p><p>Tong Lingyu said, “Palace Master, the Ice Demon Crystal is nearing maturity.  The sects have agreed to open the Sacred Land in a year’s time.”</p><p>“Good. I will be present then.”</p><p>Tong Lingyu hesitated, concerned, “Palace Master, your injury…”</p><p>“It’s fine.”</p><p>The voice from the jade screen remained flat.</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded, asking no more. “Two young cultivators wish to become Dao companions.  Their request concerns the Cleansing Pool, so they have come to see the Palace Master. They await below.”</p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p>"It's a perfect match," Tong Lingyu said without hesitation.</p><p>"Then it's settled."</p><p>The Palace Master readily approved the matter, just as Tong Lingyu expected, without summoning Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's expression faltered slightly. "Yes!"</p><p>She bowed her head slightly, a glint of understanding flashing in her eyes.  She performed another courtesy, then turned and walked down the mountain.</p><p>Inside the cliff.</p><p>Behind the pure and flawless jade wall was a stone cave so rudimentary as to be almost pathetic.</p><p>White mist swirled within the cave, radiating an intensely chilling aura. Cultivators of lower cultivation would freeze solid upon entering.</p><p>Beneath the layers of mist was a glacial pool.</p><p>Above the pool, an ice coffin floated silently, enveloped in the cold mist.</p><p>A man lay inside the coffin.</p><p>The cold mist swirled, tendrils seeping into the ice coffin.</p><p>Countless transparent runes flickered faintly on the ice coffin, though difficult to discern with the naked eye. These runes were extremely unique, and the coffin emitted a strange energy, as if the person inside was merging with Heaven and Earth.</p><p>The man wore a white robe and a jade crown, with a handsome face. Even lying lifeless in the coffin, he exuded an indescribable majesty, inspiring a spontaneous feeling of reverence.</p><p>He appeared quite young, yet emanated an aura of decay, his exposed skin startlingly pale.</p><p>He was the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace—Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Anyone witnessing the scene behind the jade wall would be astonished, unable to imagine that the Palace Master lay within an ice coffin.</p><p>The instant Tong Lingyu turned to leave,</p><p>Yin Changsheng's eyelids trembled slightly, then snapped open, revealing eyes like sculpted ice, his black pupils almost disappearing, before slowly closing again.</p><p>As Tong Lingyu descended Lingxiao Peak, Qin Sang, remembering the invitation from the Hun Mo Elder, indirectly asked a few questions, realizing Tong Lingyu hadn't received an invitation.</p><p>This was intriguing.</p><p>However, the Sacred Land would open in a year.</p><p>He now needed to focus on preparing for entry into the Sacred Land and competing for a place in the Cleansing Pool. He had much to do and couldn't be distracted, so he set the matter aside.</p><p>The two didn't stay long at Yuanji Palace. Qin Sang and the Jiang Palace Master made arrangements to visit again later, then returned to their residence.</p><p>The ceremony was being prepared in full swing.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli had no special requests, leaving everything to Shi Xue.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his seclusion in his small building.</p><p>Regardless of the external activity, Qin Sang refused visitors and sealed his cave dwelling.</p><p>He patted his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede flew out.</p><p>After using the Three Spirit King Array on it, the Fire Jade Centipede had been weak for a long time, recovering its energy only in recent years. It had also consumed numerous pills Qin Sang had obtained, and its cultivation had reached the peak of the third transformation.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Watching the two creatures play, Qin Sang fell into thought.</p><p>He had been considering whether to help the Sky-Eyed Butterfly ascend now, or let it cultivate slowly, breaking through to the mid-fourth transformation before assisting its ascension to the late-fourth transformation.</p><p>The higher the realm, the more difficult the cultivation.</p><p>This would maximize the value of the Ascension Ritual.</p><p>Qin Sang held high hopes for the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, needing its aid in the future to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage, and even the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>For this, he was willing to wait several hundred years.</p><p>However, Qin Sang now leaned toward assisting its ascension directly.</p><p>Firstly, the higher the realm, the greater the chance of ascension failure.  Greater gains later meant greater risks, which might not be a good thing.</p><p>Secondly, he was also influenced by Liuli's words.</p><p>Liuli's master was a true Grand Cultivator, who cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light. Her strength was unimaginable.</p><p>Qin Sang, a realm higher than Liuli, was still startled by her, and at that time Liuli's Ice Soul Divine Light was not yet perfected, showing the power of this technique.</p><p>Even with such strong power, her master feared the Palace Master so much that she didn't dare return to Xuan Tian Palace, preferring to be trapped in Ziwei Palace for hundreds of years rather than seek help from Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang found it hard to imagine Yin Changsheng's cultivation. Could the legendary Half-Step Nascent Soul really exist?</p><p>Or perhaps the Palace Master possessed a powerful treasure, or some similar means, that frightened Bing Yao.</p><p>Against Yin Changsheng, the Solar God Tree might not offer much advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang would try to avoid conflict with Yin Changsheng, but necessary preparations were still needed.</p><p>In a battle between Grand Cultivators, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly could only be used for warning; its Sky Eye ability could no longer secretly observe the opponent.</p><p>Breaking through to the mid-fourth transformation might allow it to escape the spiritual perception of a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I'm posting these two chapters for today.</p><p>I'm suddenly five new alliance leaders richer, totally dumbfounded.</p><p>Thank you to the generous patron Watermelon Taro Check-it-Out for the alliance leader donation.</p><p>Thank you to the generous patron  Most Love Char Siu Bao for donating four alliance leader positions.</p><p>The pressure is immense, I will continue to work hard!</p>
