<h1>Chapter 984: The Fire Curse</h1><p>They chased and fled, escaping the market and reaching the city outskirts.  Two Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivators were captured; only the left deputy remained. Despairing, he attempted to self-destruct his Golden Core.  Qin Sang, naturally, wouldn't allow this, and after some effort, captured him alive.</p><p>In the woods outside the city.</p><p>The left deputy and the others were bound, lying on the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, his gaze sweeping behind him.  A commotion arose in the distant forest; figures scattered like startled birds.  These people had followed, hoping to pick up the scraps, only to witness the deputy's swift and complete defeat and capture.  The other party seemed unharmed.</p><p>"What was that bead?"  Bai looked at Qin Sang, seeming to sense something, his expression grave.</p><p>"We'll find out by asking them!" Qin Sang said coldly.  He didn't want to waste time, and immediately seized a cultivator, employing the Soul Search technique.</p><p>Two Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivators died amidst screams.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't obtain the information he sought. He brought the left deputy over. The deputy glared at Qin Sang, but his consciousness and body were bound, leaving him powerless to resist.</p><p>Soon, the Soul Search was complete.</p><p>After performing the Soul Search three times in succession, Qin Sang's face paled slightly, and he slowly exhaled.</p><p>"Let's leave this place!"</p><p>Qin Sang incinerated the bodies, erased the traces, and put away his transformed body and twin-headed…[object removed].</p><p>The owner of the Dayu Zhou market hadn't appeared.  Qin Sang and the others had caused quite a disturbance; they didn't know what the owner might do, so this place was no longer safe.</p><p>Flying away from Dayu Zhou, Qin Sang turned to Fei You.</p><p>"Unexpected events have unfolded, and I haven't had the chance to thank Daoist Fei for risking your life to deliver the warning. The road ahead is uncertain, and I cannot burden you further. Let's part ways here.  The Merchant Guild is powerful; I don't know when I'll be able to avenge myself. Daoist Fei, because of me, you will likely have to live under a false name.  And the two Wang Daoists – please remind them to never reveal their identities…"</p><p>Fei You relaxed slightly, bowing. "Senior, don't worry.  The world is vast; we'll simply find a place to hide, cultivate diligently for several decades, and they won't find us."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, handing Fei You a pouch.  "I saw that you were using a magic weapon; you must have only recently reached Foundation Establishment, and haven't had time to refine a treasure.  These treasures within, choose two, as a thank you from me."</p><p>He could tell that Fei You's inner demonic energy was exceptionally strong, clearly from consuming several Demonic Pills, practically forcing his way to Foundation Establishment.</p><p>His future looked bleak.</p><p>Perhaps the elderly couple genuinely felt gratitude, but Fei You might not have such pure motives.</p><p>However, Fei You had risked his life to warn them, and even if he had ulterior motives, Qin Sang wouldn't be stingy.</p><p>The pouch contained items Qin Sang had collected from past enemies, as well as those taken from the warehouse by Bai and the ones he recently killed.</p><p>Two treasures were enough to change Fei You's destiny.</p><p>"How can I…" Fei You tried to refuse, but Qin Sang stopped him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Fei You's eyes widened. He swallowed, suppressing his excitement, secretly rejoicing at his gamble paying off.  He'd nearly exhausted his savings to reach Foundation Establishment, only to discover how difficult it was to refine a treasure. Even joining the Qiongyu Merchant Guild wouldn't guarantee him any priority; he didn't know when he'd achieve his dream.</p><p>Knowing the urgency, and that Qin Sang wouldn't let him take his time, Fei You chose a sword and a shield based on intuition.</p><p>Two treasures – one for offense, one for defense.</p><p>"Good eye, Daoist.  Both are high-quality treasures; with diligent refinement, they could become mid-grade treasures. However, they had previous owners. While I'm not worried, use caution."</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the pouch, offering a polite bow to Fei You.  "Daoist Fei, farewell!"</p><p>"I wish Daoist Qin safety and swift vengeance against your enemies!" Fei You said sincerely.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his figure flashing repeatedly, disappearing into the vast ocean.</p><p>Fei You watched Qin Sang go, cautiously scanning his surroundings. His joy was nearly uncontainable. He quickly put away the treasures and silently fled.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Bai followed Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly.  "You were right. The Guild issued a warrant for my capture, indeed connected to a Nascent Soul cultivator, who promised a hefty reward for information. But the left deputy didn't know much, and the Nascent Soul's identity remained unknown. However, I believe I know who my enemy is. The bead was delivered to the left deputy by the Guild.  I've seen the blue flames from the explosion before; I even obtained a trace of it.</p><p>This flame is called the Winter-Dark Cold Flame, a unique spiritual fire belonging to the Winter-Dark Recluse. After the Recluse's passing, the flame was lost in his cave, only to be retrieved by a cultivator of the demonic path named Old Mou.  Legend says this man was at the mid-Yuan Ying stage…"</p><p>"Mid-Yuan Ying stage, and possessing the secret arts to collect spiritual flames!"</p><p>Bai's expression changed.  "You mean...?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his voice strained. "It's very likely him! We were mistaken. His target may not have been the ancient treasures within the Demon Ban, but the demonic flame—or perhaps both!"</p><p>"Since you've encountered the Winter-Dark Cold Flame before, you should know its capabilities, right?"</p><p>Bai asked, scrutinizing Qin Sang, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "This flame's aura originates from the same source as the Winter-Dark Cold Flame, but the feeling it gives me is completely different. After the fire bead exploded, the power and fluctuations were unlike anything I've ever seen. All my methods were useless; it easily invaded my body and vanished without a trace…"</p><p>Before he could finish, Qin Sang's face suddenly changed, his body froze, and he abruptly raised his arms.</p><p>Unseen moments before, blue threads appeared on his arms, intertwining to form countless strange runes.</p><p>The runes were densely packed, covering his entire body.</p><p>Simultaneously, that peculiar fluctuation reappeared, seemingly echoing something in the distance.</p><p>After a while, the fluctuation dissipated, and the runes gradually faded, disappearing as before.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang's perception was clearer; these runes contained a trace of the Winter-Dark Cold Flame's power!</p><p>He had previously awakened his Sky-Eye Butterfly, keeping it focused on his body, finally discovering the clue.</p><p>These runes, infused with the Winter-Dark Cold Flame, were hidden within his flesh and meridians, integrated with his blood and flesh.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang and Bai exchanged a look, their expressions grave.</p><p>"This power…"</p><p>Bai pondered for a moment.  "In my hazy memories, I seem to have seen similar power—it should be some kind of curse. This power is very strange; ordinary methods are ineffective against it.  Since these runes are infused with the Winter-Dark Cold Flame, it would be more accurate to call it a fire curse…"</p><p>"Fire curse?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, hearing the term for the first time.</p><p>Bai's tone was heavy as he addressed Qin Sang. "The only thing that can resonate with a fire curse is the one who cast it. And… the closer the distance, the clearer the sensation!"</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I had things to do yesterday, so I wrote this early this morning.</p>
