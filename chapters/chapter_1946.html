<h1>Chapter 1937: Drawing Talismans</h1><p>Zhu Que, seemingly excited by something, was gesticulating wildly.</p><p>Xiao Wu lowered his head, following Zhu Que's gaze.</p><p>Below the sheer cliff was a lush jungle.</p><p>Ancient trees towered, their canopies intertwined, forming an impenetrable roof.  Occasionally, vines as thick as pythons could be seen emerging from beneath the canopy.</p><p>‘唧唧……’</p><p>“啾啾……”</p><p>‘扑腾腾！’</p><p>It was a bird's paradise; nests were everywhere in the treetops, and the sounds of scurrying creatures could be heard below from time to time – wild animals moving through the undergrowth.</p><p>However, the roars of large predators were almost entirely absent.  Animals like wolves, tigers, and leopards seemed rare here.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, traces of human passage were visible – a narrow path winding through the thorns and vegetation.</p><p>This wasn't actually a deep mountain.</p><p>The path led from outside the mountain to this point, vanishing at the base.</p><p>Overgrown with weeds, it was easy to miss unless one looked carefully.  Few people used it; probably a hunting trail carved out by hunters.</p><p>Following the path outwards, the mountain gradually leveled off.  When Qin Sang and the others arrived, they had seen a village in the distance.</p><p>Beyond this mountain lay the true wilderness, remote and teeming with wild animals.</p><p>Zhu Que's attention was fixed on the trail.</p><p>The sun was high now, its rays illuminating the forest. At the other end of the path, a figure appeared.</p><p>The newcomer was a boy of fourteen or fifteen, wearing rough homespun clothes and straw sandals, clearly from a poor family.  Yet, his clothes were clean, and his brow held a determined air, along with a scholarly grace unusual in ordinary villagers.</p><p>He walked with a bundle of rope in one hand and a sharpened steel awl in the other, his pace surprisingly brisk despite the uneven terrain.</p><p>His hands, gripping the rope and awl, were calloused, showing signs of training.</p><p>Hunters often possessed some martial arts skills; otherwise, even entering the mountains would be difficult, let alone hunting wild animals.</p><p>Whether the boy was gathering firewood or hunting was unclear, but he was certainly brave to venture into the mountains alone at such a young age.</p><p>‘沙沙沙！’</p><p>He was, after all, neither a cultivator nor one of those agile martial artists who could traverse rooftops and leave no trace in the snow.  As he walked, his body brushed against the tall grass, making rustling sounds.</p><p>His brow remained furrowed, his vigilance constant as he scanned for danger, pausing frequently to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Soon, a mountain appeared to the east, casting both the path and the boy into shadow.</p><p>At this point, it became clear he wasn't hunting. He slowed his pace, carefully studying the mountainside to his right.</p><p>This mountain wasn't like the majestic peak where Qin Sang and the others were located.</p><p>The slope here was uneven, sometimes steep, sometimes gentle.  Vegetation covered the mountain; sheer cliffs rose a hundred feet high in places, while in others, the incline was easily climbed.</p><p>The boy seemed to be searching for something, meticulously examining the area, shaking his head at times, stopping to ponder.</p><p>Finally, he found a location matching his expectations, his eyes lighting up. He quickened his pace.</p><p>His goal was a cliff face, about a hundred feet above the trail, beyond a gentler slope.</p><p>Just as he was about to approach, he seemed to remember something, glanced at the sky, and used his awl to mark a line on the ground.  After surveying the slope, he gathered his strength and leaped, landing steadily on a rock.  He repeated this several times, reaching the cliff face and looking up.</p><p>The cliff itself wasn't more than a hundred feet high, but it was flat, covered in clumps of grass.</p><p>A tree, growing stubbornly upward from a crevice, had vines intertwined with its branches. Two of these vines hung down, almost touching the ground.</p><p>The cliff wasn't wide; earthen slopes flanked it, with a large tree pressed close to the right side, also covered in vines.</p><p>The boy recognized these vines; they were incredibly strong and could serve as rope.</p><p>He quickly scanned the entire cliff face, his gaze flickering, seemingly in thought, finally settling on the top.</p><p>Looking up, a shadow was visible – a large, rounded boulder jutting out.  Its uneven surface made it look precarious, raising concerns about its stability.</p><p>This boulder was the boy's target. Using the same technique, he jumped from the side slope to the cliff top, secured the boulder, and gently pushed it. The boulder remained unmoved.</p><p>He increased his strength, feeling the large stone shift slightly.  A look of delight crossed his face. Ignoring the danger, he lay flat against the rock wall, observing where the base of the stone met the wall, trying to insert a steel pickaxe.</p><p>Next, he worked tirelessly, measuring and marking with the pickaxe and rope.</p><p>Lost in his work, the boy suddenly remembered something. He looked at the line he'd drawn earlier and saw the mountain's shadow was about to cross it.  His expression tightened, and he quickly hid the pickaxe and rope in the grass, running back with all his might.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Zhuque and Xiao Wu, who had been watching with great interest, were quite surprised to see the boy suddenly fleeing as if from a predator.</p><p>"He'll surely be back tomorrow," Zhuque declared confidently.</p><p>The next day, at the same time, the boy arrived as expected.</p><p>This time, he brought a shovel. He retrieved the rope and pickaxe from the grass and continued his work.  As before, he left promptly when the time came.</p><p>From then on, while Qin Sang was busy repairing the Thunder Altar, the boy became a welcome distraction for Zhuque and Xiao Wu's boredom.</p><p>Zhuque even tried to bet with Xiao Wu on what the boy was up to, but Xiao Wu wasn't interested.</p><p>This didn't dampen Zhuque's enthusiasm; she looked forward to sunrise every day.  However, to preserve their curiosity, they refrained from using their supernatural abilities to investigate the boy's intentions.</p><p>Over time, the boy brought new tools each visit.</p><p>For instance, wire mesh with iron nails, the nails unusually colored, likely poisoned.</p><p>Or a wooden shaft, tipped with iron, sharpened into a very effective spear.</p><p>And various mechanisms.</p><p>These mechanisms, ingenious hunting traps, showed the hunter's skill.</p><p>The boy experimented for over ten days before settling on the most suitable mechanisms.</p><p>"See! I guessed from the start he was building traps!"</p><p>Zhuque was pleased with herself, boasting to Xiao Wu.</p><p>However, it was puzzling.  Such effort suggested he was hunting extremely dangerous beasts, yet there were none nearby.  The deep mountain beasts were blocked by the mountain beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>The boy was incredibly patient, spending over a month meticulously setting the traps.</p><p>On the final day, he carefully checked each mechanism, meticulously clearing any trace, and even brought moss to cover any unavoidable marks on the stones.</p><p>He didn't leave any bait, nor did he lure any beasts.  When the time came, he went home.</p><p>"This kid's concealment isn't perfect enough. Let me help him."</p><p>Zhuque, eager for excitement, chuckled, flapping her wings.</p><p>For the next three days, the boy didn't appear.  Zhuque grew increasingly anxious, almost tempted to fly to the village and drag him out to find out what he was doing.</p><p>On the fourth day, as the sun rose, the boy finally reappeared.</p><p>His steps seemed heavier than before, but his pace was still brisk.</p><p>This time, he passed the traps without stopping, heading straight for their mountain.</p><p>For the first time in days, he entered the mountain.</p><p>The dense foliage couldn't hide him from Zhuque and Xiao Wu. They watched as he moved through the trees like a monkey.</p><p>A light crossbow was strapped to his right arm.  With the traps and crossbow working together, his hunt was successful.</p><p>Descending the mountain, his bag held several birds, and he carried a sizable deer.</p><p>Back on the mountain path, he glanced at the time; it was almost time for his usual departure.</p><p>This time, however, he didn't go home. He took his game to the traps, to a pre-selected spot on a north-facing slope, built a fire, took a bird, gutted it, and placed it over the flames.</p><p>The bird was fat and soon sizzled, its aroma spreading far and wide.</p><p>What followed was astonishing.  Unmoved by the enticing smell, he drew a short blade from his waist, gestured at his left arm, and then, without hesitation, inflicted a deep wound.</p><p>Flesh and blood appeared, bright red staining his clothes. The scent of blood mingled with the aroma of cooking meat.</p><p>'Hiss!'</p><p>The boy gasped, tore off a strip of cloth, and, biting one end, began to bandage the wound.</p><p>The bleeding was difficult to stop; the cloth quickly soaked through.</p><p>His face pale from blood loss, he drank deeply from a waterskin, then stared into the fire, concentrating on cooking the meat.</p><p>Shortly after...</p><p>A white shadow flickered atop the hill where the boy was, then vanished instantly.</p><p>“It’s coming!”</p><p>Zhu Que, watching the scene, lowered her voice, her eyes shining with excitement.</p><p>“No wonder, so it’s hunting a demon!  This kid must have nerves of steel!”</p><p>Xiao Wu’s eyes also glinted.</p><p>The white shadow’s movement didn’t escape their notice – a common demon-level white weasel.</p><p>While human warriors who reach the innate stage possess considerable strength and might even kill low-level Qi Refinement cultivators, the boy was clearly not one of these top experts. To lure a weasel to its death was incredibly audacious.</p><p>The weasel moved stealthily, its passage through the grass silent and unseen. It appeared behind the boy without a sound, then lunged.</p><p>The boy, seemingly focused on cooking meat, was actually on high alert. But the weasel was too fast. By the time he sensed the wind, he had no time to dodge.</p><p>The weasel was upon him, its sharp claws aiming for his back.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The sound was of metal striking metal.</p><p>Torn clothing revealed a layer of iron plates beneath.</p><p>Based on the bodies of the Master and others, and the survivors' accounts, the boy deduced the beast’s preference for surprise attacks, targeting the back. He’d prepared the iron plates as protection.</p><p>However, the weasel’s claws were unbelievably sharp, piercing the plates!</p><p>The boy felt a searing pain in his back, and a terrifying force slammed into him through the metal, causing him to instinctively lunge forward.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>He tumbled headfirst towards a stone wall, taking the cooking rack with him, falling into the sand below.</p><p>His body ached intensely; his internal organs felt displaced.  Even so, before hitting the ground, he managed to half-twist, aiming the light crossbow on his right arm behind him.</p><p>The weasel, failing to kill its prey, shrieked.</p><p>“Zee!”</p><p>The cry was ear-splitting.</p><p>Simultaneously, it transformed into a white blur, leaping down after the boy.  It shook its chin, releasing a cloud of white smoke that enveloped the boy.</p><p>The boy, anticipating this tactic, closed his eyes and held his breath.  Despite his preparations, the shriek made his head ring, causing him to feel momentarily dazed – even with cotton stuffed in his ears.</p><p>The smoke and shriek were terrifying demonic arts. The village's most skilled hunter had died from them, helpless, leaving the villagers terrified.</p><p>Luckily, the weasel didn't appear in the mornings; the villagers only dared to venture out then, closing their doors after midday, fearing the demon.</p><p>His preparations proved somewhat effective; he didn’t lose consciousness.  With sheer willpower, he raised his left arm and fired the crossbow.</p><p>The weasel attacked, threatening to tear his left arm apart.  Luckily, he'd secured iron plates around his forearm, though even these were ripped, leaving a deep wound.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Three crossbow bolts, their tips gleaming blue with poison, shot out.</p><p>The weasel was forced to dodge, twisting its body with impossible agility to avoid them, escaping unscathed.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The boy slammed onto the ground, spitting blood.</p><p>The weasel stared greedily at the vibrant body, preparing to leap.</p><p>At that moment, something triggered a mechanism; the sand erupted.</p><p>From the trees on either side, two curved branches snapped straight, making a loud *bang*.</p><p>The vines hanging from the branches were pulled from the ground, already attached to a wire mesh. The mesh sprang up, creating a net, aiming to ensnare the weasel.</p><p>But the demon was cunning; it grabbed the edge of the net and leaped.</p><p>Yet the trap continued. Another vine, close to the rock wall, was pulled, dislodging a large stone from the cliff edge.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A powerful gust of wind ruffled the weasel’s fur.</p><p>The weasel was completely within the falling rock’s shadow; at its level, being struck would mean certain death.</p><p>“Zee!”</p><p>The weasel shrieked in fury.</p><p>*Puff!* *Thwack!*</p><p>At the last second, it hastily released a puff of smoke to momentarily slow the rock, grabbing its edge with a forepaw and kicking off with its hind paws, performing a somersault to escape.</p><p>But this wasn't the end. As the rock fell, a third trap activated.  There was the click of a mechanism, and cold steel emerged from the grass.</p><p>Five poisoned spears sprang from each side, targeting the weasel as it was airborne and unable to gain purchase.</p><p>*Swish! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The spears' force was like that of a powerful crossbow.</p><p>The ten spears formed a deadly crossfire. The seasoned weasel couldn’t escape. Its enraged shriek turned to a terrified scream.</p><p>*Pchh!* *Bang!*</p><p>Demon blood painted a crimson line on the ground.</p><p>A spear pierced the weasel, its tip embedding deeply in a tree trunk, the shaft still vibrating.</p><p>“Magnificent!”</p><p>Zhu Que clapped her wings. “A pity, this weasel bore the scent of a cultivator – someone’s pet, I’d wager. This kid’s in trouble.”</p>
