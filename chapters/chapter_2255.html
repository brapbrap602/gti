<h1>Chapter 2245 Traitor</h1><p>Qi Bo's knowledge was no greater than Chen Yuze's.  The source of the problem lay with the Tianjing Sect Master.  It seemed that only by capturing him could the truth be uncovered.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled information about the Tianjing Sect Master. The problem was that the Sect Master's cultivation was equivalent to the early Nascent Divinity stage in later times, while Qin Sang was only at the early Core Formation stage. He could compensate for the difference in cultivation with his insight and experience, but only to a certain extent.  This was particularly true when both parties were in the same major realm; otherwise, it was like trying to make bricks without straw.</p><p>Breaking through a major realm represented a qualitative change. It was quite difficult for Qin Sang to outmaneuver the Tianjing Sect Master at his current level. He needed to plan carefully and lay an ambush. Things would be much easier if Qin Sang was at the late Core Formation stage.</p><p>However, Qin Sang worried that by the time he reached the late Core Formation stage, too much time would be lost, missing a crucial opportunity, unless…</p><p>He continued cultivating the *Celestial Demon Transformation Technique*.  Soon, he would possess the combat power of a late Core Formation cultivator!</p><p>But the strange changes in the Azure Bird Dharma Image made Qin Sang hesitate. The information revealed by Chen Yuze made Qin Sang increasingly suspect that the Tianjing Sect Master's interest in Mount Yuanjing was likely related to its legacy. Was it worth risking everything to find clues to the *Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondences*?</p><p>Qin Sang left Chen Yuze aside, sealed his five senses, but didn't kill him directly. He might be useful later.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, running the *Celestial Demon Transformation Technique*, sensing the stars, but all remained silent.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang decided to continue cultivating!</p><p>First, the calling had completely disappeared. After so long without any contact, the one who had called either perished or encountered a major problem. Even if it appeared again, it would likely be after a considerable time, perhaps even decades or centuries.  During this period, Qin Sang would focus on improving his main cultivation technique.  If the Dharma Image transformed, he would have the strength to suppress it – a race against time.</p><p>Second, the Azure Bird Dharma Image was only a phantom; it would begin to condense after reaching the fifth layer. If any being sought to be reborn through the Dharma Image, the phantom would likely be insufficient to support them. As long as Qin Sang maintained the Dharma Image as a phantom, and did not attempt to condense it, the danger would be controllable to some extent.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately set up an array around him and began to cultivate.</p><p>From Chen Yuze, he knew that the Tianjing Sect Master wasn't currently at the sect. Perhaps, by the time the Sect Master received news and returned, Qin Sang would have already reached the peak of the fourth layer of the *Celestial Demon Transformation Technique*!</p><p>While cultivating, Qin Sang made various preparations. Calculating against a Nascent Divinity cultivator wasn't simple; he needed, at the very least, a way to track their movements.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang stayed relatively close to the Tianjing Sect, observing their reactions and even controlling a few of their cultivators for this purpose. He would know immediately the moment the Tianjing Sect Master returned.</p><p>After Qi Bo's death and the young master's disappearance, coupled with the Sect Master's absence, the Tianjing Sect was initially in chaos. Later, the sect unified its efforts, prioritizing the search for their young master. They secretly investigated the killer while spreading news through various channels, offering substantial rewards for the young master's return and promising to consider any terms.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Tianjing Sect sent people to investigate the Qingjiang Sect and even questioned Mount Yuanjing because the incident occurred after their return from the Qingtuo River, and a disturbance had taken place on Mount Yuanjing before the incident, raising suspicion.</p><p>Fortunately, the Zhou elder and others held their ground, repelling the Tianjing Sect's people.</p><p>The Tianjing Sect didn't opt for a forceful attack on Mount Yuanjing.  The killer's efficiency suggested formidable power, requiring the Sect Master's personal intervention to deal with.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang deliberately used the Celestial Demon Transformation during Qi Bo's death and carefully arranged the battlefield afterwards, leading to suspicions of demonic involvement.</p><p>The Tianjing Sect was quite distant from Yongtu Immortal City. Though rare, demonic cultivators did infiltrate; and with the increasingly tense situation around Yongtu Immortal City, both sides attempted reconnaissance.</p><p>This led the Tianjing Sect to suspect whether Qi Bo and the young master had inadvertently discovered some secret or stumbled upon demonic spies during their travels, which brought about their demise.</p><p>The Tianjing Sect's actions yielded no results. Chen Yuze's soul lamp hadn't been extinguished, yet there was no news of the killer nor any claim for the ransom.  Fear gripped the entire sect.</p><p>Three months later, the Tianjing Sect Master finally returned.</p><p>That night.</p><p>In the main hall, the Tianjing Sect elders and hall masters gathered, scarcely daring to breathe.</p><p>Seated in the highest place was a middle-aged cultivator with a long beard, dressed in a dark brocade robe, his hair and beard neatly combed, his eyes deep and sharp beneath his brows, exuding an aura of authority. This was Chen, the Tianjing Sect Master.</p><p>A coffin lay before him, the hall silent as the grave.</p><p>"How long have I been gone?  Such chaos has erupted."</p><p>Chen, the sect leader, spoke, his voice raspy. There was no anger, only a tremor that unsettled everyone present.</p><p>The Grand Elder of the Tianjing Sect stepped forward, his face grim. "I have failed, Sect Leader.  Punish me as you see fit!"</p><p>"Punish us!"</p><p>A chorus of apologies followed, a prearranged plea for forgiveness.</p><p>Chen, the sect leader, coldly surveyed the assembly.  "Grand Elder," he said,  "what have you uncovered? Any news of Yu Ze?"</p><p>The Grand Elder recounted the events, patiently and in detail, to the sect leader.</p><p>Chen listened without comment, his gaze fixed on the body encased in glacial ice within the coffin.</p><p>The Grand Elder ventured cautiously, "Sect Leader, we believe the most significant clues lie in Qi's injuries and the battlefield's condition. Before Qi and the young master disappeared, they had confronted the Qingjiang Sect, forcing the Yuanjing Mountain sect, though without casualties.  This has likely created resentment…"</p><p>"Yuanjing Mountain…"</p><p>Chen's eyes darkened.  He knew perfectly well about that incident, it was his doing.</p><p>"The Transcendent One won't break through so quickly.  Before his breakthrough, he won't easily leave seclusion.  Yuanjing Mountain will avoid making enemies. They'll swallow this," Chen frowned.</p><p>The others were astonished. Their leader seemed to understand Yuanjing Mountain and the Transcendent One better than they did.</p><p>The Grand Elder continued, "Besides Yuanjing Mountain, the most likely suspect is a demonic spy, Sect Leader. Please observe…"</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, the Grand Elder dispelled the ice, revealing details of the corpse.  They had immediately encased the body of Qi Bo in ice, preserving the residual aura of the wounds.</p><p>Sensing this aura, Chen's eyes gleamed.</p><p>"This demonic energy is exceptionally pure, even rare among demons," the Grand Elder pointed to several wounds. He had studied the body countless times. "Powerful clans often cultivate superior techniques, leading to purer demonic energy. The beast was likely a Phoenix clan expert, possibly a high-ranking member of the Golden Eagle clan or a similar group, to possess this level of technique."</p><p>"The battlefield has also been sealed, preserved as it was.  Please, Sect Leader, come and see…"</p><p>The Grand Elder was mid-sentence when Chen's eyes flashed with killing intent. With a furious snort, he slammed the table and leaped to his feet.</p><p>The assembled members trembled. Chen vanished from the hall, bursting out of the mountain gate.</p><p>Watching him go, they exchanged bewildered glances, unsure what had just transpired.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Qin Sang's hidden location, events at Tianjing Sect's mountain gate were reflected through a spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang learned of Chen's return, only to see him leave again shortly afterward.</p><p>"Where is he going?"</p><p>Chen's actions were highly unusual, but the more unusual they were, the more likely they held crucial clues.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang left his cave, taking out a small pouch.</p><p>As he opened it, a buzzing sound, like a swarm of bees, emanated.  Two luminous points flew out.</p><p>These were two spirit insects, resembling tiny jade wasps. They were not living creatures, but magical artifacts called Earth-Listening Bees, created by Qin Sang for tracking purposes.</p><p>"If only I had the Sky-Eye Butterflies," Qin Sang sighed, releasing one of the bees.</p><p>The bee shot into the sky, its speed remarkable.  It traced Chen's path and instantly disappeared on the horizon.  Qin Sang then took the second bee and followed.</p><p>Fortunately, this era's teleportation arrays were rare and travel was inconvenient. During Chen's absence, Qin Sang had diligently cultivated the Heavenly Demon Transformation, reaching the late fourth stage, achieving strength comparable to a late Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>While still weaker than Chen, Qin Sang could compensate with his control of the Earth-Listening Bees.  It would be difficult for Chen to detect them.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his cultivation at this point. His Azure Luan avatar was still in an illusory form, but the changes in the illusion were increasingly apparent.</p><p>Now, if Qin Sang were to release the illusory avatar, one could clearly see the lively light in its eyes. Except for its ethereal body, it looked like a living Azure Luan, graceful and elegant.</p><p>Based on his understanding of the technique, he could fully condense a real avatar.  But Qin Sang dared not be careless, reminding himself not to take that step before uncovering the truth.</p><p>Chen flew with unremitting speed, his figure a flash of light, but Qin Sang, also skilled in escape techniques, managed to keep pace.</p><p>Unknowingly, Chen had left the main area of Tianjing Sect's influence.</p><p>This way…”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind conjured a detailed map showing all locations related to the Tianjing Sect.</p><p>"Three thousand li further lies a mine controlled by the Tianjing Sect.  Is Sect Leader Chen heading there?"</p><p>Qin Sang secretly rejoiced, sensing a big catch might be in store.</p><p>However, after flying for a while, the Earth-Listening Bees suddenly lost direction.</p><p>Qin Sang uttered a soft exclamation, catching up to the leading bee. He saw it hovering in place, its target seemingly vanished into thin air.</p><p>This was expected.  Unfazed, Qin Sang squeezed out two drops of his essence blood and fed them to the bees.  They transformed into blood bees, quickly rediscovering their target and resuming the pursuit.</p><p>Soon after, as Qin Sang anticipated, Sect Leader Chen entered the mine.</p><p>Years ago, a fierce battle erupted between the Tianjing Sect and another faction over this mine, which the Tianjing Sect ultimately seized.  The defeated faction, unwilling to accept the loss, constantly caused trouble.  Other factions also eyed the mine covetously.  Fearing instability, the Tianjing Sect rapidly mined it, aiming to maximize profits.</p><p>The mine's value plummeted, eventually becoming a haven for independent cultivators.  The Tianjing Sect left only a few disciples to oversee the site and search for remaining resources.</p><p>Sect Leader Chen stealthily descended into the mine's depths.</p><p>There, underground rivers crisscrossed, carving subterranean canyons that plunged into the darkness, filled with black mist.</p><p>Reaching the edge of a canyon, Sect Leader Chen reached out, shouting, “Come out!”</p><p>The mist violently churned, followed by a furious roar.</p><p>The roar wasn't human.  Moments later, the mist cleared, revealing a stunning woman with a phoenix hairpin adorned with vibrant feathers.</p><p>“Sect Leader Chen, why the anger?”</p><p>Her hair was disheveled, her attire disordered.  Seeing Chen, she looked surprised and confused.</p><p>“Hand over Yu Ze!” Chen's eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p>“Yu Ze?”</p><p>The woman's face paled. She quickly explained, “Has your son met with misfortune? Please calm yourself, Sect Leader Chen. I've been hiding here, knowing nothing of this. I don't understand why you suspect me.”</p><p>Chen coldly snorted, “Qi Lao was killed by demonic forces, and my son was abducted.  In this region, who else could it be but you!”</p><p>His killing intent was palpable.  “Though I promised your master I'd help him deal with the Transcendent Cultivator, how I do it is my own affair. Your attempt to coerce me will bring our enmity!”</p><p>The woman was a demon cultivator.</p><p>Facing Chen's rage, the woman struggled to defend herself, her anxiety evident.</p><p>“Sect Leader Chen, please calm down. Even if I were audacious, I wouldn’t dare coerce you!  The clan leader and you have a long-standing friendship.  This time, he asked for your help, offering no compensation. We are grateful for your assistance, how could we be so ungrateful?  Please tell me what happened. If it truly involves my clan, I will do everything I can to help you rescue your son…”</p><p>Chen narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the woman.</p><p>Seeing her sincerity, he frowned.</p><p>His secret dealings with the demons stemmed from past friendships and long-term strategy. If humanity lost, the Tianjing Sect would have a way out, preventing their annihilation.</p><p>However, with the current tensions, he didn't want to be branded a traitor.</p><p>He accepted their request without payment to avoid deep entanglement and avoid fully committing his sect's resources. Ideally, he could achieve his goal by simply disrupting the Transcendent Cultivator's seclusion.</p><p>Upon learning of Qi Bo’s suspected assassination by an insider, Chen immediately suspected these demon cultivators of kidnapping his son for leverage.</p><p>Even Qin Sang couldn't have imagined that his deceptive plan would unexpectedly hit its mark.</p>
