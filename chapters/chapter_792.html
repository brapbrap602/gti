<h1>Chapter 784: Mystery of the Valley</h1><p>Qin Sang leaped between the mountain fragments.</p><p>His goal was the valley.  As he passed the hidden areas, he occasionally probed with sword Qi, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea.</p><p>The seventh level seemed endless, with mountain fragments everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang flew at full speed, traversing countless fragments, and finally arrived near the valley.</p><p>Just then, he stopped abruptly, changed direction mid-flight, and landed in a nearby jungle. He concealed his aura and frowned towards the valley.</p><p>Just now, figures had flashed past the valley entrance, and it seemed there was more than one.</p><p>No wonder he hadn't seen anyone along the way.</p><p>Could it be that the cultivators who had previously entered the Celestial Tower were now gathered in the valley?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, suspecting that the battle between the Demon Lord and the Great Witch Priest had originated in the valley. After they left, these people gathered, hoping to find something of value.</p><p>The Great Witch Priest had found some kind of treasure in the valley, something unprecedented.</p><p>The valley might contain a portal to higher levels, related to the ancient cultivators' relics within the Celestial Tower. The Demon Lord pursued him relentlessly, seemingly for more than just the conflict between their two races.</p><p>The Witch Clan found something valuable as soon as they arrived.  Could they have obtained some ancient text, learning the secrets of the Seven Kills Hall?</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a while, confirming there were no Nascent Soul ancestors in the valley at the moment. Unable to restrain himself any longer, he transformed into a streak of light, flew out of the jungle, and headed straight for the valley.</p><p>The valley was vast.</p><p>It was the largest fragment Qin Sang had seen so far.</p><p>The mountain fragment encompassed an entire valley.</p><p>As he landed at the valley entrance, lush forests on both sides came into view, vibrant and green.</p><p>The riverbed in the middle of the valley was dry, yet the forests on both sides remained remarkably dense.  There was no wind, the leaves motionless. The entire forest felt strangely eerie and lifeless, contrasting sharply with its verdant appearance.</p><p>This feeling was similar to the lower levels.</p><p>At this time, cultivators were busy in the valley, searching for something.</p><p>They noticed Qin Sang's arrival, glancing up briefly before ignoring him.</p><p>However, judging by their expressions, they hadn't found anything useful yet.</p><p>Fallen ancient trees and signs of chaotic struggle everywhere indicated a fierce battle had taken place in the valley. He was right, the Nascent Soul ancestors of the two races had definitely fought here.</p><p>However, finding clues from these traces was like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance, surveying the area, his gaze finally fixing on the valley's interior.</p><p>It was enveloped by a mass of black light, resembling a black hole.</p><p>A closer look revealed the black light was composed of densely packed black threads, crisscrossing and tangled, obscuring the inner valley completely.</p><p>The cliff walls on both sides were covered in restrictions, their surfaces mottled like weathered stone. The black threads emanated from these walls.</p><p>These black threads were as thin as zither strings and seemed intangible. They hovered there, motionless.  Due to their sheer number, they appeared as a solid mass of black light.</p><p>The seemingly delicate threads were extremely dangerous. None of the cultivators searching the valley dared to approach them.</p><p>It was said that several Nascent Soul ancestors had perished here, their bodies never recovered.</p><p>For years, no one had successfully ventured inside.</p><p>The cliff walls near the threads were also covered with chaotic sword and blade marks, riddled with holes. Most were old, suggesting the Great Witch Priest and Demon Lord had been cautious during their fight, careful not to disturb the threads.</p><p>"What treasure did the Great Witch Priest obtain? How could he verify it with so many people watching?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, shaking his head helplessly, and then flashed into the valley.</p><p>He traversed the valley floor, his divine sense spread wide, searching openly and without restraint, just like the others.</p><p>Strangely, aside from the traces of battle, they found nothing.</p><p>The treasure couldn't be out in the open, otherwise, it would have been taken already.</p><p>If the Great Witch Priest obtained a treasure, he must have opened some hidden area.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang overheard other cultivators talking.</p><p>"Do you think there's actually no hidden realm or ancient hall? Could the Great Witch Priest have entered the inner valley and retrieved the treasure from there?"</p><p>A cultivator, having searched fruitlessly, straightened up, stared into the depths of the valley, and voiced his doubts.</p><p>The others also looked in that direction.</p><p>The black threads hung motionless, seemingly swallowing even light itself, a chilling sight.</p><p>"Wasn't it said that there's a portal to higher levels inside? Could we have been wrong all along?  Is this not a portal, but a treasure trove?  But the Seven Kills Hall has been opened so many times, and no one has ever entered. Our human race has produced countless outstanding predecessors, some no less powerful than the Great Witch Priest, and they were all helpless.  Is the Great Witch Priest really that strong, capable of withstanding the power of the black threads?" someone questioned.</p><p>Another person said, "Isn't everyone saying that the Witch Clan deliberately provoked this war, willing to go to such lengths, for the sake of the Seven Kills Hall? They must know something to dare such a gamble.  Besides, the Witch Clan possesses many strange and ancient witchcraft traditions. Some things are beyond our comprehension. It wouldn't be surprising if they have a way to deal with the black threads.  However, if there truly are ancient treasures of our human cultivators hidden here, and the Witch Clan got to them first, I wonder if our predecessors would be willing to let it go."</p><p>"The tides of change are rising in the Cang Lang Sea again!" the person sighed.</p><p>As they spoke, some cultivators flew over, scattering themselves before the black threads, their eyes filled with fear, not daring to cross the line.</p><p>No one could discern any secrets within.</p><p>Some continued searching, unwilling to give up, while others silently retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was sharp. He listened to their discussions while searching.</p><p>He summoned the Ebony Sword, pretending to clear debris from the ground, but secretly using sword Qi to probe everywhere.</p><p>The Sun Cliff of the Purple Star Palace looked no different from other places from the outside, but inside, it hid the Sword Path and the portal, which could only be opened by the unique sword Qi of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter."</p><p>He could only place his hopes on this.</p><p>In the end, like the others, Qin Sang found nothing.</p><p>He arrived at the depths of the valley, feeling troubled.</p><p>"Do I have to test every mountain fragment?  It's impossible to finish in such a short time."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the tangled threads with a helpless expression.</p><p>With his current cultivation, entering would be a dead end.</p><p>The threads themselves didn't seem related to sword Qi.  Neither the Ebony Sword nor the Killing Talismans reacted.</p><p>Unwilling to leave empty-handed, Qin Sang shifted his gaze, examining the cliff walls on both sides.</p><p>The walls were covered in scars, some sword marks possibly left by ancient cultivators countless years ago, enduring through the ages, now presented before him.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, fixated on a single sword mark.</p><p>This mark was at the edge of the black threads, hidden and extremely small, almost imperceptible!</p>
