<h1>Chapter 2145: Spreading the Dao and Transmitting the Dharma</h1><p>The Dharma Altar was constructed according to the rituals of the Celestial Court, divided into Governing Altars, Pacifying Altars, Metropolitan Altars, and Branch Altars. Since there were no Talisman Sect factions here, there were no Sect Altars.</p><p>The Storm Realm didn't possess the Celestial Court's formidable power and vast territory, so the regulations were scaled down accordingly.</p><p>The Governing Altar was chosen near the Transfer Formation leading to the Western Lands. This location was roughly at the center of the Storm Realm and not far from the Green Ram Temple, making it the ideal choice.</p><p>Qin Sang named his Daoist domain the Green Ram Prefecture, and this Governing Altar became the Green Ram Prefecture Altar.</p><p>Should the Green Ram Prefecture Altar one day connect to the Divine Court, or even condense a Metropolitan Merit Seal and be elevated to a formal prefecture of the Celestial Court, the Green Ram Temple would truly achieve resounding fame throughout the Great Thousand Worlds!</p><p>Beneath the Governing Altar, four Pacifying Altars were established.</p><p>During the Celestial Court's golden age, laws were stringent, and regulations dictated even the names of the Pacifying and Metropolitan Altars. For example, the "Jiazi Tongxuan Zhizheng Pacifying Altar" and the "Lingzhen Yingmiao Altar"— "Jiazi" denoted the sequence, followed by the altar's name.</p><p>With the Celestial Court in decline, and the Green Ram Prefecture not yet incorporated into it, there was no need to adhere rigidly to these rules, lest it seem jarring to the cultivators of the Storm Realm. Thus, when naming the Pacifying Altars, Qin Sang continued to use the names of the four domains from the lower realm.</p><p>The first Pacifying Altar, situated on the coast of the Eastern Sea, governed the entirety of the former Northern Wasteland, Central Continent, and Eastern Sea, including the Witch Clan's territory. Being the most powerful and central of the four, it was named the Jiazi Central Continent Pacifying Altar.</p><p>The second Pacifying Altar was established in the Northern Sea, the birthplace of the Green Ram Temple. It governed the four regions of the Northern Sea, with room for northward expansion, and was named the Yichou Northern Sea Pacifying Altar.</p><p>The third was established in the Western Lands. Now, with the climate and terrain of the Western Lands drastically transformed and its population steadily growing, coupled with the vast expanse beyond its borders, the three island chains would eventually be incorporated into the Green Ram Prefecture.  Holding the greatest future potential, it was named the Bingyin Western Lands Pacifying Altar.</p><p>The fourth was situated in the Boundless Sea, governing both the Boundless Sea and the Demon Sea. To the east, it could monitor the River of Calamity, and to the south lay a vast ocean expanse. It was named the Dingmao Boundless Pacifying Altar.</p><p>Beneath the four Pacifying Altars were Metropolitan Altars and Branch Altars, established as needed.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang instructed Li Yufu to establish a Metropolitan Altar within the sanctuary. Though external threats were eliminated, this location could not be abandoned, and cultivators would remain there permanently as a fallback position.</p><p>Regarding the Divine Dao, however, Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Fortunately, the Divine Dao in the Green Ram Prefecture was only nascent and not a cause for concern. Qin Sang emulated the Talisman Realm, employing Celestial Officials to oversee deities and tasking the deities with safeguarding the mortal world.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang had constructed the rudimentary form of a prefecture. Conventionally, he could now expand outwards, conquering territories and establishing more Pacifying, Metropolitan, and Branch Altars, attracting more cultivators to embrace the Dharma and cultivate the Dao.</p><p>The wider the territory and the more cultivators who received the Dharma, the greater the Governing Altar's power, increasing the likelihood of connecting to the Divine Court, condensing a Metropolitan Merit Seal, and being elevated to a formal prefecture.</p><p>Unfortunately, this was the Sea of Mists. The territory could not exceed the former territory of the Changyou Clan, and the Storm Realm could not possibly antagonize the entire Otherfolk race. Upon reaching its limits, it could only lie dormant.</p><p>If Qin Sang truly chose the path of Great Ascension, this Green Ram Prefecture wouldn't suffice to propel him to the Body Integration stage. It could only serve as a temporary measure; he would need to seek another location to establish a Daoist domain in the future.</p><p>"Do you have suitable candidates in mind for the lords of the four Pacifying Altars?" Qin Sang asked Li Yufu.</p><p>With Pacifying Altars, there must be Celestial Officials to preside over them.</p><p>As an Emissary of the Five Thunders Court, Qin Sang had the authority to make appointments within the Five Thunders Court, reporting them to the Divine Firmament Upper Palace afterward.</p><p>Within the Five Thunders Court's hierarchy, beneath the Emissary were the Third Rank Nine Heavens Golden Portal Upper卿, Divine Firmament Jade Pivot Deputy Emissary, and Five Thunders Court Deputy Emissary.</p><p>The Fourth Rank were the Jade Palace Upper卿 and Five Thunders Commanders, while the Fourth Rank Associate were the Jade Palace Upper卿 and Five Thunders Chief Commanders.</p><p>Below them were the Fifth Rank Jade Palace Upper卿 and Five Thunders Commanders; Fifth Rank Associate Upper Clarity Decree of Life Jade Palace Upper卿 and Profound Heaven Grand Dharma Master;</p><p>Sixth Rank Upper Clarity Decree of Life Jade Palace Upper卿, Five Thunders Summoning Emissary, and Five Thunders Demon Subduing Emissary;</p><p>Sixth Rank Associate Five Thunders Evil Warding Emissary and Five Thunders Evil Slaying Emissary.</p><p>Numerous other official positions were also assigned based on specific duties, such as Registrar Celestial Official, Assistant Registrar Celestial Official, Chief Registrar Celestial Official, Purple Star Inner Secretary, Purple Star Dharma Master, Great Peace Transforming Celestial卿, Divine Firmament Enforcement Celestial Official, Western Terrace Wind and Rain Official, Great Peace Transforming Recorder, Divine Firmament Herald, and so on, each with its own rank and position.</p><p>From the names of these positions, it was evident that during the Celestial Court's prime, the Fifth Rank marked a significant threshold, signifying high authority and power, unattainable for ordinary individuals.</p><p>Qin Sang had benefited from the Celestial Court's decline, receiving an extraordinary appointment, and the Celestial Officials below him could also benefit, with Nascent Soul cultivators able to preside over Pacifying Altars, being bestowed the Fourth Rank Jade Palace Upper卿 and Five Thunders Commander, and so on down the line.</p><p>"Disciple wishes to personally lead the Central Continent Pacifying Altar," Li Yufu bowed and said.</p><p>As the Green Ram Temple Master, representing Qin Sang's will, he had an unavoidable responsibility. The Central Continent Pacifying Altar was the most powerful, a mix of various factions, requiring someone of sufficient weight to preside over it, and Li Yufu was the only choice.</p><p>As he wasn't yet a Soul Formation cultivator, he could only temporarily act as the Five Thunders Court Deputy Emissary, later presiding over the Governing Altar for Qin Sang, but his actual position remained the Fourth Rank Five Thunders Commander.</p><p>"Palace Master Bao Zhengnan sent a letter, stating that Fellow Daoist Bao Xi wishes to cultivate thunder arts. In this disciple's opinion, Fellow Daoist Bao Xi can preside over the Western Lands Pacifying Altar. Palace Master Tong and Sect Master Shi are unwilling to change their cultivation methods. Venerable Yunxin recently relinquished her position as Abbess, and she herself seems to have the intention of converting from Buddhism to the Dao.  We could either request Palace Master Tong to appoint a Profound Heaven Palace expert, or invite Venerable Yunxin to preside over the Boundless Pacifying Altar. The contributions of the Four Saints Palace and Profound Heaven Palace in numerous battles are evident, and Fairy Liu Li has graced the entire realm, sufficient to command respect."</p><p>Li Yufu clearly had a plan, speaking eloquently. "As for the final Pacifying Altar, the Northern Sea Pacifying Altar, disciple believes we can allow the other factions to jointly nominate someone, as a gesture of benevolence and virtue."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly; Li Yufu's considerations were quite thorough.</p><p>He had both staggered the Pacifying Altar lords and their respective sects to prevent any single sect from dominating within a Pacifying Altar, and considered the perspectives of the other factions, truly a balanced approach.</p><p>Not to mention, the other factions would undoubtedly engage in some struggle when nominating their candidate. The chosen individual would lack a foundation in the Northern Sea, where the Green Ram Temple's ancestral grounds were located, along with the formidable presence of the Profound Heaven Palace, making it difficult for the Pacifying Altar lord to exert much influence.</p><p>Within the Celestial Court's system, Pacifying Altar lords couldn't act arbitrarily; key positions would only be filled with individuals trusted by the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>"With the Green Ram Prefecture entrusted to you, this poor Daoist will have no worries," Qin Sang said with satisfaction.</p><p>Li Yufu showed no sign of self-satisfaction, bowing and saying, "Master Uncle overpraises me."</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at the Governing Altar.</p><p>From afar, the landscape had drastically transformed.</p><p>A celestial city had originally formed around the ancient Transfer Formation, but now it had expanded, leaving the central mountain peaks clear.</p><p>The mountains weren't particularly rugged, shrouded in clouds and mist, with lush bamboo forests.  At the foot of the mountains stood a ceremonial archway, inscribed with the five golden characters "Green Ram Prefecture Altar," guarded by golden-armored sentinels.</p><p>Although it lacked the grandeur of the White Stone Prefecture Altar that Qin Sang had seen, with pavilions and towers hidden amongst the celestial clouds and ancient trees, and a bustling celestial city outside, it possessed a dynamic yet tranquil, fresh, and distant atmosphere, filled with mystery and an air of solemnity.</p><p>The ancient Transfer Formation, located near the foot of the mountains, was restricted to ordinary cultivators.</p><p>Near the summit were several golden halls, one of which was the Dharma Transmission Hall of the Dharma Bestowal Office, also the location of the Governing Altar.</p><p>The two landed before the golden hall, and Li Yufu stepped forward to open the doors. Qin Sang saw a Dharma Altar with its base already constructed.</p><p>In fact, the various Dharma Altars of the Daoist sects were, to some extent, interchangeable. The true core lay in what was inscribed within the altar, such as the Thunder Oath Chapters and other thunder talismans within a Thunder Altar, and the Metropolitan Merit Seal and Dharma within a Dharma Transmission Altar.</p><p>In ancient times, Dharma Transmission Altars could bestow Dharma, establish Four Divine Stations, summon deities and generals, cast thunder talismans and thunder arts, and so on, more comprehensive than a Thunder Altar.</p><p>Qin Sang could also integrate a Thunder Altar into the Governing Altar for ease of use. However, an altar with too many functions could lead to conflicts, depending on the altar master's cultivation and control.</p><p>Since this was his first time establishing an altar to transmit the Dharma, he decided to build a Governing Altar from scratch, both to protect the Green Ram Prefecture and for Dharma transmission. He would consider merging them once the Governing Altar had grown sufficiently powerful. However, preparations for future integration were already underway, with the three core Branch Altars situated adjacent to the Pacifying Altars.</p><p>Li Yufu stood respectfully at the entrance as Qin Sang entered the Dharma Transmission Hall.  The Thousand Jun Ring shimmered, countless spirit materials flowing out like water, transforming into various shapes before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang personally worked, rapidly shaping the Governing Altar. Apart from being larger than the Pacifying Altars, its form was essentially the same, lacking any further mystical qualities.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The Governing Altar trembled slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang gracefully landed atop the altar. With a thought, a point of azure light shot out from between his brows, instantly illuminating the entire hall, manifesting an illusory Celestial Altar.</p><p>Li Yufu, already possessing some understanding of the Celestial Court, sensed the mystical aura emanating from the Celestial Altar, his gaze shifting between awe and eagerness.</p><p>The altar-protecting Divine General, the Thunder Ancestor, was deliberately concealed by Qin Sang. As Qin Sang's thoughts flickered, the Imperial Decree Golden Book and the Five Thunders Emissary Court Seal flew out from the Celestial Altar, hovering above the Governing Altar.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal within the Celestial Altar was also activated, emitting three beams of azure light that coalesced into three illusory Dharma forms before Qin Sang: the First Stage Supreme True Unity Childlike Spirit Official General Dharma, the Second Stage Flowing Gold Fire Bell Dharma, and the Third Stage Five Thunders Secret Dharma.</p><p>The Imperial Decree Golden Book emitted a point of golden light, transforming into a blank golden talisman. One of the Dharma forms adhered to it, solidifying into a true golden talisman, whereupon the Five Thunders Emissary Court Seal split off an illusory seal, merging into the golden talisman.</p><p>The golden talisman trembled, its aura suddenly transforming, radiating a peculiar power.</p><p>All three golden talismans were fully formed, turning into three points of golden light that spiraled down into the Governing Altar.</p><p>Inside the Governing Altar, the three golden talismans revolved around each other, sometimes separating, sometimes merging. Within the golden light, the shadow of a golden seal occasionally appeared, its outline resembling the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal. Conventionally, upon the Governing Altar's completion and connection to the Divine Court, these three golden talismans would form the basis for the condensation of the Metropolitan Merit Seal.</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness sank into the Governing Altar, engaging the golden talismans, urging them with all his might, attempting to sense the Divine Court. The result was as expected: like a stone sinking into the sea, there was no response.</p><p>However, the golden talismans bore the Five Thunders Emissary Court Seal, meaning Qin Sang could bestow Dharma on others.  However, during the Dharma bestowal, the step of burning the memorial to the heavens wouldn't reach the Divine Court, but instead fly to the Governing Altar.</p><p>Sensing no response, Qin Sang abandoned the attempt, withdrawing his consciousness. True Essence surged into the Governing Altar, causing the Dharma Transmission Hall to tremble violently.  The Governing Altar erupted with a pillar of azure light that shot through the dome and soared into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, within the celestial city outside, and across most of the Central Continent, a rainbow arcing into the heavens could be seen. Immediately afterward, all the Pacifying Altars, Metropolitan Altars, and Branch Altars manifested auspicious phenomena, erupting with azure light, resonating with the Governing Altar.</p><p>This scene caused panic throughout the Storm Realm, with many fearing another major event was about to unfold.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon didn't last long. If someone were near a Pacifying or Metropolitan Altar at that moment, they would see a faint golden glimmer within the receding azure light as it merged back into the altar.</p><p>Now, all the altars possessed the ability to bestow Dharma, with the level of Dharma transmissible depending on the altar's hierarchy.</p><p>The highest, the Third Stage Five Thunders Secret Dharma, could only be bestowed by the Governing Altar.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, looking at Li Yufu, and said, "Choose an auspicious date, invite fellow Daoists, and come to the Governing Altar to witness your Dharma bestowal!"</p><p>Li Yufu would be the first to receive the Dharma.</p><p>"Which cultivation method have you chosen?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Daoist scriptures differed; even within the High Divine Firmament Dharma, various cultivation methods could be practiced.</p><p>"Disciple feels the *Divine Firmament Cross-Shaped Heavenly Scripture* is more suited to me!" Li Yufu replied respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang had presented Li Yufu with several thunder scriptures to choose from.</p><p>The superior thunder scriptures recorded within the Five Thunders Emissary Court Seal included the *Three Palaces Inner Decrees*, the *Primordial Chaos Six Heavens Wish-Fulfilling Scripture*, the *Cave Profound Jade Pivot Thunder Arts*, and so on. The *Divine Firmament Cross-Shaped Heavenly Scripture* was also among them.</p><p>Naturally, there were also ordinary thunder scriptures, such as the *Primordial Thunder Secret Canon* and the *Moving Clouds and Summoning Rain Secret Manual*, as well as the common Five Elements Thunder Arts, with cultivation methods for all five elemental spiritual roots.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't so readily offer the superior thunder scriptures to outsiders; there would be restrictions and conditions.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, taking out a jade slip. "This scripture originates from the era of the Divine Firmament General Administration within the Celestial Court. It is an ancient thunder scripture with formidable power. You're switching to the path of thunder midway; comprehending this scripture won't be easy. Although this master is not a true thunder cultivator, I have some insights into this Dao, which I've appended to the thunder scripture."</p><p>"Thank you, Master Uncle, for transmitting the Dharma!"</p><p>Li Yufu knelt on both knees, raising his hands, solemnly receiving the thunder scripture.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after, various factions received the message and came to the Governing Altar to witness the ceremony.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all, Qin Sang activated the Governing Altar, burning incense and praying, reporting to the Divine Firmament Upper Palace, and personally bestowing the Dharma upon Li Yufu.</p><p>Twenty or thirty others received the Dharma alongside him, all Nascent Soul cultivators who had decided to cultivate thunder arts.</p><p>Some were still hesitant, but they soon regretted it, because only the first time would Qin Sang personally bestow the Dharma.  Subsequent Dharma bestowals at the Governing Altar would wait until Li Yufu received the Five Thunders Secret Dharma and condensed his Celestial Altar, whereupon he would bestow the Dharma on others in Qin Sang's stead.</p><p>This meant that the first batch of Dharma recipients could call themselves disciples of the Emissary, and even if they weren't Green Ram Temple disciples, this connection was enviable.</p><p>With Li Yufu and the others receiving the Five Thunders Secret Dharma, candidates for the four Pacifying Altar lords were selected, lords for the Metropolitan and Branch Altars were assigned their respective duties, and the Green Ram Prefecture gradually got on track.</p><p>Thus, the Celestial Court's thunder arts flourished!</p><p>Every so often, countless cultivators and mortals received the Dharma at various Branch Altars.</p><p>Within the Dharma Transmission Hall, Qin Sang sat cross-legged atop the Governing Altar, focusing his senses.</p><p>"So there's this benefit to establishing a Governing Altar…" Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He sensed that as more and more people received and cultivated the Dharma and thunder arts, forming connections with the Governing Altar, its power was increasing in some subtle way, and the golden seal manifested by the three golden talismans became increasingly solid.  The Governing Altar could actually aid the altar master in comprehending thunder arts, and the stronger the altar, the more pronounced the effect.</p><p>Unfortunately, his fundamental cultivation method wasn't a thunder scripture, and he had already cultivated the Five Thunders Secret Dharma to its peak. He didn't know where to obtain the Fourth Stage Purple Void Directing Thunder Treasure Scripture.</p><p>However, there were still aspects he could draw upon.</p><p>After all, spreading the Dao and transmitting the Dharma was also part of the Great Ascension path!</p>
