<h1>Chapter 2130: The Sage</h1><p>Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>The Thunder Altar activates.</p><p>Thunder explodes, the earth shakes and mountains tremble.</p><p>The temple's protective array is unable to contain the lightning, which bursts through, shooting towards the heavens.</p><p>Surrounding mountains and plains, countless living beings, are gripped by fear, staring dumbly at Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>The dazzling lightning hurts their eyes. A colossal lightning pillar, thicker than a mountain, pierces the heavens, its base resting on the magnificent Thunder Altar.</p><p>The pillar reaches the ninth heaven, its power overwhelming.</p><p>The world is in chaos!</p><p>Birds, beasts, insects, humans, demons, and cultivators – all living beings are overwhelmed by the terrifying power, their cries of fear echoing, some even collapsing dead from fright.</p><p>The power of the thunder continues to surge.</p><p>Creatures in the Northern Wastelands, the Central Plains, and even further afield feel this earth-shattering force, their hearts uneasy, gripped by intense fear.</p><p>All beings tremble in terror!</p><p>Almost simultaneously, three more lightning beams erupt in distant lands: from the North Sea, the far west of the Central Plains, and the Canglang Sea—the three core sub-altars, echoing the main altar.</p><p>Su Nu and two others hold the sub-altars. Their pressure is second only to Qin Sang; they dare not relax.</p><p>This Thunder Altar's power far surpasses the previous one, making the demands on its operator far greater. Qin Sang keeps the Sky-Eyed Butterfly by his side to share the burden, allowing him to still fight.</p><p>Su Nu stands on the altar, her pretty face taut, performing the incantations taught by Qin Sang with meticulous precision.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The altar vibrates violently.</p><p>Previously, to prevent the enemy from discovering the core sub-altars, they had remained hidden, using only third-order lightning talismans, allowing them to manage easily.</p><p>Now, they must give their all; the altar can no longer be hidden, manifesting in the void as a phantom altar, second only in size and scale to the main altar.</p><p>Similar scenes unfold in the other two regions.</p><p>With the appearance of the three lightning pillars, from the Four Regions of the North Sea to the Central Plains, the East Sea, the Canglang Sea, and the Demon Sea, the altar arrays begin to manifest, all altar masters acting according to orders, giving their all. Wave after wave of lightning bursts forth.</p><p>Countless altars erupt with lightning, dense in some areas, sparse in others, appearing mostly around major sects and prominent mountains, surrounding the three sub-altars and the main altar.  Like countless lightning swords, they pierce the sky, standing between heaven and earth, transforming the Storm Realm into a forest of lightning swords.</p><p>The world's energy surges, instantly creating storm clouds; thunder rolls, echoing through the sky above the Storm Realm. This territory is enveloped by divine might, undergoing a baptism of divine thunder.</p><p>Above the clouds, lightning stretches endlessly, countless bolts appearing out of thin air, dancing wildly across the heavens.</p><p>At this moment, the Storm Realm appears to be divided into four thunder realms, vast and boundless, possessing terrifying power capable of overturning the earth and easily destroying countless beings.</p><p>Lightning surges from all directions, rushing from the distant horizon, its immense power gathering high in the sky.</p><p>The battlefield.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang shattered the Void-Breaking Spirit Pagoda, a warning flared in the Grand Protector's heart. Without hesitation, he activated the mutual-transformation technique. As expected, a layer of barrier-like energy appeared, severing the connection between him and the Nine-Colored Deer, limiting his abilities!</p><p>The Grand Protector's expression changed, overwhelmed by intense unease.  He immediately sent a warning signal and ordered Lu Gan to activate the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram to rescue them.</p><p>He couldn't understand what advantage the enemy had that allowed them to cut off their escape route.  Something was amiss; the enemy revealing this trump card must have a motive.</p><p>No matter what, retreat was the best strategy!</p><p>At that moment, within the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram, Lu Gan, Lu Wang, and Shao Shi were all stunned by the celestial phenomena over the Western Lands.</p><p>Dark clouds churned in the sky, azure lightning illuminating the heavens, endless thunder forming a surging tide, roaring towards them.</p><p>Despite the distance and the protection of the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram, they felt a sense of suffocation facing the thunderous tide; its oppressive might sent a chill down their spines.</p><p>“Save them!”</p><p>Lu Wang, sensing an ominous feeling, shouted fiercely.</p><p>The thunder tide already possessed such might; if it struck the army, the consequences would be unimaginable.  The Grand Protector, usually cautious, had yet to retreat. The Nine-Colored Deer lay motionless on the ground, clearly having encountered an accident.</p><p>Lu Gan, a seasoned warrior, understood this immediately.  The moment Lu Wang gave the order, he activated the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram with all his might, almost simultaneously receiving the Grand Protector's warning.</p><p>Mountains responded; eight clear pools appeared.</p><p>The next moment, above the Grand Protector and the other Sky Realm Second Tier experts, a glimmer of Xuanhuang light appeared.</p><p>A faint image of a scroll flickered around Huang Guangzhong.  Suddenly, thunder roared, shaking the heavens.  Above the storm, amidst boundless lightning, a sphere of pure azure lightning formed.</p><p>The azure lightning instantly eclipsed the surrounding bolts, as if swallowing all their power. Within the azure sphere, a “Thunder Scroll”—the Oath of Thunder—hovered.</p><p>In an instant, the Oath of Thunder traversed vast distances, descending upon the battlefield.  It didn't fall directly onto the battlefield, but materialized between the battlefield and the Undying Eight Extremes Diagram.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The void trembled violently.</p><p>The Oath of Thunder paused slightly, its celestial might illuminating the earth with its thunderous radiance.</p><p>The faces of the Grand Protector and the others turned ghastly. Just as the scroll was about to take shape, it abruptly disintegrated, its yellowish-brown light dissipating completely. Hope had been given, then cruelly snatched away!</p><p>The Undying Eight Extremes Diagram shook violently, causing the earth to crack, mountains to crumble, and rivers to flow backward—a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>“PUFF!”</p><p>Lu Gan spat out blood, his face pale, as if struck by a terrible blow. He was thrown back.</p><p>Seven of the nine clear pools shattered; the two remaining ones cracked and dried up.</p><p>Lu Gan fell off the cliff, severely injured.  He stared at the Thunder Scroll in the sky, his face filled with horror.</p><p>The Oath of Thunder suppressed the Undying Eight Extremes Diagram. After a brief pause, it continued its descent, carrying the might of the heavens.</p><p>On the battlefield, everyone, including the Grand Protector, was consumed by fear.</p><p>The Severing Void Pagoda could only cover a limited area. Qin Sang, using this treasure, targeted the Grand Protector.  Not all of the second-stage Void Realm experts' escape routes were cut off; only the Grand Protector and those closest to him had their abilities sealed.</p><p>As disaster struck, everyone looked out for themselves. Those who found their abilities still intact immediately used teleportation techniques to flee the battlefield.</p><p>Others weren't so lucky, including Li Yue.</p><p>Li Yue wasn't a loyal follower of the Lu King; he was merely attracted by the generous reward.  His death here was truly unfair.</p><p>The Yan Mountain Si family was still recovering. If possible, Qin Sang would have preferred to leave Li Yue for Si Lu, but his goal was to kill the Grand Protector, so he couldn't show mercy.  Li Yue and the others were simply victims of bad luck.</p><p>Celestial might suppressed everything, as if time itself had stopped. An eerie silence fell over the battlefield, broken only by the boundless azure lightning and the light “azure thunder scroll.”</p><p>A thin sheet of paper, seemingly bearing the weight of heavenly law, suppressing the world!</p><p>“AAAH!”</p><p>With a desperate scream, a second-stage Void Realm expert, a loyal follower of the Lu King, finally succumbed to the heavenly might.  His body cracked, lightning coursed through him, and he exploded.</p><p>Three beams of light shot out—his three companion beasts—before transforming into three balls of lightning, vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>A top-tier expert in the Illusory Void stage had fallen.</p><p>At this moment, the Grand Protector was the only one left with any fighting power; even Li Yue had no chance.</p><p>Fear?</p><p>Regret?</p><p>…</p><p>At this critical juncture, the Grand Protector couldn't afford such useless thoughts.  His only thought was to fight for a sliver of hope!</p><p>He tried to recall his Heaven-Binding Golden Lock, but the treasure was being restrained by the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal, and the power of the void realm likely couldn't withstand this thunder talisman.</p><p>The Grand Protector hastily took out a black dipper containing a full measure of silver sand. He overturned the dipper, spilling the sand. The earth began to warp and undulate, with countless rocks erupting from the ground.</p><p>The rocks transformed into winged celestial horses, majestic and imposing.</p><p>The horses took flight, fearlessly charging towards the Oath of Thunder.  The vast herd obscured the sky, representing the Grand Protector's last hope.</p><p>The Grand Protector didn't have time to look up. He desperately activated the treasure bottle in his hand, its cross-shaped light wave spinning rapidly, attempting to create a crack in the Severing Void Pagoda's power.</p><p>Azure lightning leaped through the horse herd; each strike annihilated a large number of celestial steeds.</p><p>A huge gap appeared in the horse herd, revealing the Oath of Thunder, its divine power irresistible.</p><p>The Grand Protector abruptly looked up, his pupils constricting before being swallowed by the lightning.</p><p>Within the Undying Eight Extremes Diagram,</p><p>The cultivators who had managed to escape were still terrified. The Lu King's face was as dark as water, because the Grand Protector had not returned!</p><p>Just then, the Nine-Colored Deer finally awoke, its hooves leaping, its form twisting, its face seemingly changing into the Grand Protector's.</p><p>The Lu King's face lit up with joy, then froze.  Lightning erupted from within the Nine-Colored Deer, which was torn apart by lightning before everyone's eyes.</p><p>The Shao Shi, the Lu Wang, and all the Siyou Cultivators witnessing the scene felt a chill run down their spines!</p><p>On the battlefield, Qin Sang watched the location of the Grand Protector, sensing the rapid dissipation of his aura.  To ensure no mistakes, he summoned the Five Elements Crown and unleashed a beam of Five Elements divine light—clearly an overkill.</p><p>The attack's power far exceeded his expectations.  This wasn't solely due to the Thunder Altar and the fourth-order thunder talisman; the Azure Luan True Thunder played a crucial role. The fourth-order talisman required the Azure Luan True Thunder to function, and conversely, only a talisman of this rank could unleash the true power of the Azure Luan True Thunder.  The two complemented each other, instantly obliterating a late Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Moreover, the thunder's power hadn't been exhausted!</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the Thunder Oath Talisman, soaring towards the Wu Ding Eight Extremes Diagram.</p><p>The Lu Wang, Shao Shi, and others could see Qin Sang and the Thunder Oath Talisman, which was becoming somewhat translucent but hadn't dissipated.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's voice boomed out.</p><p>"Shao Shi, do you still intend to oppose me?"</p><p>Do you still intend to oppose me?</p><p>His voice radiated immense confidence.</p><p>"Shao Shi…"</p><p>The Lu Wang's expression changed. Before he could finish, he saw Shao Shi flash through the crowd, instantly realizing something, and screamed, "Stop him!"</p><p>But with the Grand Protector dead and Lu Gan critically wounded, even the Lu Wang couldn't stop Shao Shi.</p><p>Shao Shi was also shocked by the talisman's power.</p><p>In fact, the Xuan Di Huang Scroll wasn't the Wu Ding Eight Extremes Diagram's most powerful ability. The Wu Ding Eight Extremes Diagram, a treasure passed down through the royal family for generations, possessed more than just healing capabilities. It was also a devastating weapon on the battlefield, something Shao Shi had planned to gradually reveal to Lu Gan depending on the battle's progress.</p><p>The problem was, even with these abilities, could he withstand that 'green thunder paper'?</p><p>Shao Shi had no confidence. Besides, who knew how many more attacks the enemy could launch?</p><p>Shao Shi understood the implication in Qin Sang's words.  As long as Si Lu wanted to return to the Siyou Clan and revive the Yan Shan Si family, he couldn't become mortal enemies with the royal family!</p><p>But if he didn't join forces with the Lu Wang and fully utilize the Wu Ding Eight Extremes Diagram, Qin Sang might turn against him, and the consequences would be dire.</p><p>The esteemed royal Shao Shi, having to gamble on his opponent's mercy—how far had he fallen?</p><p>Shao Shi chuckled bitterly, but his mind was made up. He coldly said, "Lu Wang, fend for yourself!"</p><p>Then he shouted, "The Yan Shan Si family and the royal family share the same Si bloodline. The Si Emperor never believed the Lu family's slander and sent people to protect the remnants of the Yan Shan.  Today, I have witnessed the Lu family's arrogance and self-destruction. The Yan Shan Si family is innocent, and we await the return of Young Master Si Lu!"</p><p>Above the Clear Pool, Shao Shi appeared, Lu Gan too badly injured to stop him. Control of the Wu Ding Eight Extremes Diagram was easily seized.</p><p>A stream of Xuanhuang light rose from the bottom of the Clear Pool, grasped by Shao Shi.</p><p>The earth began to fade.</p><p>Since the Lu Wang's army invaded the Western Lands, the desert had transformed into fertile land. While it hadn't reverted to desert yet, the spiritual energy and life force were being rapidly drained. The area was already ravaged by the Thunder Oath Talisman, now returning to a wasteland.</p><p>In Shao Shi's palm, the Xuanhuang light intensified, revealing a treasure map, its light dimmed, its power greatly diminished.</p><p>It had been a pyrrhic victory.</p><p>Ignoring the pain, Shao Shi used the map's power to protect himself, remaining vigilant as he fled towards the Western Lands border.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down from above, his eyes filled with killing intent. The Thunder Oath Talisman completely transformed into thunder, sweeping across the land with unstoppable force.</p><p>Others could be subdued, but the Lu Wang and his confidant Lu Gan had to die.</p><p>Who could have predicted such a dramatic turn of events, such a swift and complete defeat? The Lu Wang and his people hadn't considered leaving a companion beast besides the Wu Ding Eight Extremes Diagram.</p><p>Now, there was no escape!</p><p>The thunder roared behind him. Shao Shi glanced back, seeing the azure thunder covering the sky, but it didn't attack him, causing him to breathe a sigh of relief. Then he heard Qin Sang's reply.</p><p>"Convey my regards, and those of Daoist Si Lu, to the Si Emperor!"</p><p>…</p><p>Storm Realm.</p><p>Above all the branch temples, thunder surged like an ocean, mirroring the battlefield.</p><p>In the three core branch temples, Su Nu and the other two finally witnessed the Thunder Altar's true power, inspiring awe.</p><p>The other cultivators were even more shocked.</p><p>They finally knew what their enemy looked like, who was protecting the Storm Realm, and who had led them to annihilate their powerful foes.</p><p>A figure, wielding countless thunderbolts, was invincible, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies, leading to their utter defeat!</p><p>This scene was deeply etched into their hearts, never to be forgotten.</p><p>At that moment, regardless of race or sect, the cultivators showed heartfelt reverence.</p><p>Some prostrated themselves before the figure's back, calling him Great Real Person.</p><p>More voices called out—Saint!</p>
