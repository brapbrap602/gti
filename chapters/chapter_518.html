<h1>Chapter 511: The Deal</h1><p>A few days prior, Qin Sang adopted a new identity, presenting himself as a refiner and securing a position as a guest artisan at a shop in Qingyang Market, openly appearing in public.</p><p>He frequently interacted with Qingyang Demon Sect disciples, displaying exceptional kindness, offering them low-priced repair and refinement services for their magical artifacts.  He would engage in casual conversations, subtly gathering information about the sect.</p><p>Occasionally, he would offer seemingly innocuous advice, projecting an image of benevolence and care for his juniors.</p><p>Among them were many acquaintances he'd met at Tian Ge Tower years ago. They didn't recognize him as the Qingfeng Daoist they fondly remembered, yet they felt a sense of familiarity with him.</p><p>As a result, Qin Sang was very popular.</p><p>In reality, Qin Sang, under the guise of a necromancer, had been secretly contacting individuals interested in purchasing his corpses.  Most were Qi Condensation cultivators.</p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators were observing; a few corpses weren't enough to warrant their attention.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't concerned. His dealings were genuine transactions. He discreetly contacted many people, successfully selling four corpses, three of which went to Qingyang Demon Sect disciples.</p><p>This was perfectly normal; Qingyang Demon Sect disciples were generally wealthier than independent cultivators and were far more generous with their offers.  The corpses Qin Sang produced were certainly worth the price.</p><p>To this point, eight corpses had been sold. Qin Sang still possessed one zombie and five corpse puppets.</p><p>Among the five corpse puppets was the sole surviving mid-Foundation Establishment puppet from his battle with the Hooded Robe Daoist.</p><p>Of the fourteen remaining Kuiyin Sect remnants, four were refined into corpse puppets, nine into zombies, and one was kept for other purposes.</p><p>Several days later, corpses reappeared in Qingyang Market.  This time, however, alongside a zombie was a corpse puppet. While not particularly powerful—weaker than an average early-Foundation Establishment cultivator—</p><p>the commotion it caused was significantly different.</p><p>After the auction, the number of Foundation Establishment cultivators contacting Qin Sang through the Treasure Pavilion increased dramatically.</p><p>Qin Sang was always cautious. While his goal was the Qingyang Demon Sect, he wouldn't be foolish enough to reveal his true intentions and risk suspicion. Instead, he adopted a policy of selling to the highest bidder.</p><p>He secretly sold another corpse puppet, although the buyer wasn't a Qingyang Demon Sect disciple.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had three corpse puppets left; two were late-Foundation Establishment puppets he intended to keep, but for the sake of his advancement to the Golden Core stage, he needed to sell them.</p><p>However, late-Foundation Establishment corpse puppets were too conspicuous; Qin Sang dared not sell them easily.</p><p>Day after day passed.</p><p>With less than a month until the auction, the Treasure Pavilion suddenly delivered a message: a renowned expert from the Qingyang Demon Sect wished to meet Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon receiving this news, Qin Sang's heart stirred. The person he had been waiting for had finally arrived!</p><p>Suppressing his eagerness, Qin Sang arranged to meet the individual two days later.</p><p>…</p><p>Third day, evening.</p><p>Treasure Pavilion private room.</p><p>Qin Sang donned a black robe and entered the Treasure Pavilion. He was led by the manager into a private room, where a refined-looking middle-aged man sat calmly sipping tea, his face unobstructed.</p><p>Having spent twenty-eight years in Qingyang Market, Qin Sang was familiar with the prominent figures of the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>The man was named Wen Yanjie, a late-Foundation Establishment cultivator known within the Qingyang Demon Sect for his generosity and care for his juniors, possessing a masterful command of the Qingyang Demon Fire.</p><p>“So it's Daoist Wen in person!”</p><p>After the Treasure Pavilion manager withdrew, Qin Sang, adopting a hoarse and aged voice, sat down opposite Wen Yanjie.</p><p>Wen Yanjie narrowed his eyes, set down his teacup, and studied Qin Sang. “Daoist friend recognizes me?”</p><p>“Hard not to,” Qin Sang chuckled.  “Daoist Wen's reputation is known throughout Qingyang Market. I've heard so much about you, my ears are practically calloused.  I didn't expect Daoist Wen to be interested in corpses.  It seems my corpse puppets will fetch a good price.”</p><p>Wen Yanjie calmly replied, “Corpses are merely tools, no different from magical artifacts. I've always been interested in things that enhance strength.  As for the price, that depends on the quality of your corpses… the kind from the auction a few days ago need not be offered.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood; Wen Yanjie wouldn't be interested in ordinary corpse puppets.  He opened his corpse pouch and summoned the mid-Foundation Establishment corpse puppet.</p><p>"Fellow cultivator, what do you think of this one?"</p><p>Wen Yanjie's eyes lit up. He extended his spiritual sense to scan the corpse, then glanced at Qin Sang sideways.  "Fellow cultivator, you're clearly no ordinary person. No wonder I couldn't see through your strength! You must have even stronger corpses, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang countered, "This corpse isn't good enough for you, Cultivator Wen?"</p><p>"It's too weak," Wen Yanjie shook his head, leaning forward slightly, his gaze intense. His voice dropped. "You definitely have a late Foundation Establishment stage corpse. Don't hide it. Bring it out. I want them all."</p><p>Qin Sang was willing to sell, but Wen Yanjie's demeanor and tone implied a threat, making Qin Sang frown.</p><p>He wasn't sure if this man was trying to trick him or simply being arrogant.</p><p>This person's true nature seemed different from the rumors.</p><p>He wasn't afraid of Wen Yanjie. His knowledge of the Qingyang Market was as good as anyone in the Qingyang Demon Sect.  The market was full of complex factions, and even the Qingyang Demon Sect, now weakened, couldn't control everything.</p><p>Even if he wanted to sell, he couldn't appear weak, or Wen Yanjie would push him around.</p><p>Qin Sang thought quickly, stood up abruptly, and exclaimed, "Cultivator Wen, what do you mean? Do you intend to force a sale?"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's stance, Wen Yanjie's eyes gleamed.  "I guessed right. What are you hesitating for? I have plenty of top-grade artifacts.  Just name your price."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. "That corpse is my trump card. I need it to venture into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. What top-grade artifact could compare to such a powerful corpse? Cultivator Wen, don't dream. I'll pretend I never saw you today!"</p><p>Qin Sang put the corpse away and turned to leave, but Wen Yanjie intercepted him.</p><p>"Cultivator Wen, what's the meaning of this!"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned anger.</p><p>Wen Yanjie said calmly, "Don't misunderstand, fellow cultivator. I'm making a sincere offer. Look at this."</p><p>Wen Yanjie produced a jade box from his pouch and opened it. Inside was a small plant, bright red, emanating intense heat that made the room noticeably warmer.</p><p>"Firethorn Grass?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  An unexpected bonus.</p><p>Firethorn Grass was one of the most effective remedies for corpse transformation complications.</p><p>"Correct, it's Firethorn Grass,"</p><p>Wen Yanjie nodded. "You've purchased similar herbs several times. I suspect you suffered from corpse qi or corpse poison during corpse refinement...  Your urgency suggests a serious injury. Since you recognize Firethorn Grass, I won't explain its effects. How about this Firethorn Grass for your corpse?"</p>
