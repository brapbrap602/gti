<h1>Chapter 639: The Poison Spring</h1><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Elder Thunderclap kicked open the doors of the main hall.  His eyes swept across the room, and he froze, surprised to see a young man sitting there, leisurely sipping tea.</p><p>He hadn't sensed any presence outside the hall.</p><p>Either the hall had special wards, or…</p><p>Elder Thunderclap stepped inside.  He lifted his other foot, then stiffened, unable to advance or retreat.</p><p>The others, seeing Elder Thunderclap’s imposing entrance followed by his sudden halt at the doorway, were puzzled. Just as they were about to call out to him, a sharp ‘Crack!’ echoed through the hall.</p><p>A translucent hand lashed out, striking Elder Thunderclap. He spun like a top, flying backward until he crashed into a mountain peak at the edge of the Five Venom Sect.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Dust and debris billowed as rocks crumbled.</p><p>Elder Thunderclap’s screams pierced the air, echoing endlessly.</p><p>“Ambush!”</p><p>The others paled, hastily summoning their magical artifacts.</p><p>In an instant, dazzling lights filled the area before the Five Venom Sect's main hall, a spectacle never before witnessed.</p><p>They assumed Cui Xuanzi was playing his usual tricks, and confident in their numbers, they hadn't taken many precautions.</p><p>With Elder Thunderclap’s sudden attack, the group was thrown into disarray, each fighting for themselves.</p><p>Some cautiously retreated, others launched their artifacts and venomous insects toward the hall, while the majority rushed to attack Cui Xuanzi.</p><p>In the next moment, a shimmering figure, a young man, materialized at the hall’s entrance.</p><p>The artifacts and insects hurtled towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted. With a casual gesture, he unleashed his potent true essence, instantly sealing the space before him. The artifacts and insects became like fish caught in a net, their struggles futile.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A sword beam flashed.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!…’</p><p>The sounds continued as the sword light, like a silken thread, strung together the artifacts and insects, effortlessly destroying them in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Aagh!”</p><p>The destruction of their soul-bound insects caused their masters to recoil in agony.</p><p>“Annoying!”</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed.  The Ebony Sword flickered, accompanied by a faint rumble of thunder, as it plunged into the crowd. Blood sprayed, and bodies crumpled to the ground.</p><p>The aura of a Core Formation cultivator was undeniable!</p><p>Silence descended upon the Five Venom Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the survivors, each trembling in fear.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was also stunned. He hadn't expected Qin Sang’s swordsmanship to be so terrifying, as effortless as chopping vegetables. Though both were newly formed Core Formation cultivators, Qin Sang was stronger than even his former master.</p><p>Qin Sang had shown mercy to the Thunderclap Bandits and the Hundred Flowers Palace because he still needed their services. With their foundations intact, they wouldn’t dare disobey him.</p><p>As for the invited rogue cultivators, Cui Xuanzi recognized most of them as notorious bandits, cruel and unruly, their hands stained with blood. Killing them wouldn't weigh on his conscience.</p><p>These individuals, while not entirely useless, weren't what Qin Sang needed. Stability was paramount.</p><p>He could refine their corpses into powerful tools for later use in searching for insects and exploring secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang only had four Heavenly Corpse Talismans: one leftover and three more refined from the Soul-Attracting Grass he’d exchanged for using the Purple Subtlety Secret Technique.</p><p>He felt it best to conserve them until he had a clearer understanding of the Canghai Sea Region.</p><p>Since none of these bandits were at the Pseudo Core Formation stage, he wouldn't waste the talismans on them.</p><p>If the surrounding powers in the Xiongshan Region knew that the notorious bandits who plagued them had been wiped out, they would surely celebrate.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Main Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in the seat of honor, Cui Xuanzi, Elder Thunderclap, and the alluring woman standing below.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi’s expression was gloomy, disappointed that Qin Sang hadn't destroyed the Thunderclap Bandits and the Hundred Flowers Palace as he had hoped, but he dared not speak out.</p><p>The other two were still shaken, never having imagined that Cui Xuanzi wasn’t bluffing. The wolf had truly come.</p><p>“…Your sect and bandit group remain yours. If anyone uses my name to cause trouble, don't expect me to intervene. I simply require manpower and won't remain in the Western Frontier for long. I have no interest in meddling in your squabbles. However, I won't tolerate chaos and infighting affecting my plans. Since Fellow Daoist of the Five Venom Sect has set the rules, abide by them. Understood?”</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Thunderclap and the alluring woman exchanged glances, their worries easing slightly.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi, though still resentful, found this outcome far better than unconditional surrender.</p><p>All three bowed in agreement.</p><p>The alluring woman, regaining her composure, cast a seductive glance at Qin Sang, her voice a melodious purr, "We at the Hundred Flowers Palace will certainly obey your commands, Young Master. I've long yearned for a figure like yourself to offer our allegiance to.  When might Young Master grace the Hundred Flowers Palace with his presence…?"</p><p>A faint floral fragrance wafted from her, intoxicatingly sweet.</p><p>A sudden cold snort, sharp as a thunderclap, exploded beside her ear.</p><p>The alluring woman flinched, her face paling, her enchanting demeanor shattered. She dared not utter another word.</p><p>How dare she use her charm arts on him!</p><p>Qin Sang glared at her coldly. Protected by the Jade Buddha, such petty tricks were useless against him. After warning her, he returned to the matter at hand.</p><p>“If you handle these matters well, there will be rewards.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, talismans, artifacts, and spirit pills appeared. He regarded them with a faint smile. With threats and enticements, he wasn't worried about their cooperation.</p><p>…</p><p>Blackwind Valley.</p><p>Situated between the Five Venom Sect and the other two factions, Blackwind Valley had always been a contested territory. An agreement for ten-year rotations had maintained a period of stability, until the Five Venom Sect produced a Golden Core cultivator, shattering the peace.</p><p>Qin Sang and Cui Xuanzi stood at the valley's entrance, peering inside.</p><p>Two towering mountain ranges flanked the valley, shrouding it in perpetual darkness.</p><p>An eerie wind howled within the deep chasm. According to Cui Xuanzi, the valley hadn't been so treacherous originally. It had been carved out over time through spirit stone mining.</p><p>“Take me to the Poison Spring first,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>In his search for the ancient teleportation formation, he wouldn't overlook any anomaly.</p><p>Having searched the entire Xiongshan Region without success, Qin Sang knew he couldn't remain trapped there. He had already made arrangements with Cui Xuanzi and the others, preparing to delve deeper into the Western Frontier to search for insects and investigate secret realms.</p><p>Passing by Blackwind Valley, he decided to take a look.</p><p>Due to the fierce winds, Blackwind Valley could only be entered through its main entrance, heavily guarded and protected by spirit formations set up by the Five Venom Sect.</p><p>Without waiting for Cui Xuanzi, Qin Sang activated his movement technique and descended into the valley.</p><p>He quickly sensed the aura of the Poison Spring, a large area resembling a subterranean lake, its clear waters visible in the valley’s corner. </p>
