<h1>Chapter 218 Tracking</h1><p>Unbothered, Cloud Walker accepted the cup, sipped his wine, and held the goblet, lost in thought for a long time. Finally, he hesitantly said, "Brother Qin, when you met Solitude Heart, how…how was he?"</p><p>"Reverend Solitude Heart possesses a compassionate heart, adapts to a life of poverty, and treats the ailments of the poor and suffering. This junior took shelter in the Azure Sheep Temple during a year of calamity, when refugees from the North flocked south, and many starved to death. Reverend Solitude Heart provided medicine for free, saving countless lives…"</p><p>Seeing Cloud Walker's interest, Qin Sang recounted everything he saw and heard after entering the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>He admired Reverend Solitude Heart, who truly followed the belief of "If I could build countless mansions, I would happily shelter the poor from the world's cold."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't do it himself, but that didn't stop him from admiring those who could.</p><p>"He did good."</p><p>Cloud Walker nodded with a sense of relief.</p><p>"Reverend Solitude Heart passed down the lineage that his predecessor left behind in the mortal world. His disciple is called Bright Moon, who is also intelligent and righteous. However, before I left the Great Sui Dynasty, I visited the Azure Sheep Temple. In order to escape the war, Reverend Solitude Heart and Bright Moon had already left the temple, and it's been forty years since then, so I fear…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.</p><p>Time was merciless.</p><p>Bright Moon was only two years younger than him. If Reverend Solitude Heart didn't have any unexpected opportunities, he had probably already passed away.</p><p>Cloud Walker also thought of this and sighed. Once he stepped onto the path of immortality, the gap between immortals and mortals would be eternal.</p><p>"Senior, have you joined the Taiyi Danzong?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought back to when he first met Cloud Walker. The steward of the Taiyi Dan Pavilion called him 'Grand Uncle' when seeing him off, which showed how close their relationship was.</p><p>Cloud Walker hummed in agreement. "This old man's master, Real Person Piao Ya, is from the Taiyi Danzong. Back then, my master saw that this old man was proficient in medicine and had some talent in the Dao of Alchemy, so he made an exception and brought this old man into the immortal sect to be a medicine boy. Fortunately, this old man knows some medical skills and is proficient in the way of health preservation, so although I am old, my body is still strong. Later, I took a few spirit pills and managed to take this step."</p><p>Don't underestimate Cloud Walker's understatement. Qin Sang knew how much hardship was hidden in those words.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Changyang Market, Qin Sang sent Cloud Walker off.</p><p>"Junior Qin, please return! Junior Qin is a disciple of the Shaohua Sect. Our sects jointly guard the Xuanlan Pass. We will definitely meet again in the future. Farewell!"</p><p>Cloud Walker cupped his hands toward Qin Sang, turned around, and headed west alone.</p><p>Qin Sang watched until the slightly thin figure of Cloud Walker disappeared into the mountains.</p><p>According to Cloud Walker, although he had broken through to the Foundation Establishment Stage, because he was too old, he had left hidden dangers when he broke through that hindered his future cultivation.</p><p>He traveled the Ancient Immortal Battlefield for many years, searching for a way to solve the hidden dangers. This time, he finally received news, so he went on this trip. Unexpectedly, he met Qin Sang in the Changyang Market.</p><p>This reminded Qin Sang of himself. The two were suffering from the same problem. However, Qin Sang had brought it upon himself, while Cloud Walker had only encountered immortal fate at the age of seventy-eight. It was the will of the heavens, and there was nothing anyone could do.</p><p>As for what hidden dangers Cloud Walker had encountered, Qin Sang didn't ask further.</p><p>He had only met Cloud Walker because of Reverend Solitude Heart, and they had only met once. They didn't have a deep friendship, so they had to be careful not to overstep their boundaries.</p><p>Cloud Walker only gave a simple explanation without saying much more. He didn't ask Qin Sang for help, so Qin Sang wisely didn't say anything more.</p><p>Qin Sang stood there, turned to look in the southeast direction, and didn't move for a long time.</p><p>Meeting Cloud Walker suddenly evoked Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>If he had chosen to stay in the Great Sui Dynasty back then and not pursue the path of immortality, what would his life be like now?</p><p>Perhaps he would have great power, be rich beyond compare, or have a house full of children and grandchildren…</p><p>This life would also have been wonderful.</p><p>However, deep down in his heart, would there always be a trace of regret that he couldn't shake off, that would rise from the depths of his heart whenever he looked up at the night sky alone?</p><p>After all, there were really immortals in this world!</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky, turned, and walked into the market. He found a secluded corner, activated the "Spirit Concealment Technique" to hide his cultivation at the thirteenth level of the Qi Refining Stage, put on a ghost mask, and walked back to the street with hurried steps, as if he had something urgent to attend to.</p><p>…</p><p>Around the Changyang Market were rolling stone mountains of varying heights, forming a complex terrain.</p><p>At this moment, a figure wearing a mask left from the market. As soon as he left, he immediately used a flying magic device to fly towards the west with all his might, while frequently looking back, acting with great vigilance.</p><p>He seemed not to notice that between the mountains behind him, two people were concealed by the terrain, creeping up like deadly snakes without making a sound, trailing him the whole time!</p><p>These two individuals, one in a tight-fitting outfit with a robust physique, and the other resembling a frail scholar.</p><p>“Second Brother, he’s just a Level 13 Qi Refining cultivator, more or less at our level. Even if we don’t use the toxic miasma, two against one should be easy. Why bother alerting Big Brother?”</p><p>The strongman detested lurking and surveillance, feeling pent-up and uncomfortable to avoid being spotted by the target, making his tone discontented.</p><p>But the scholar insisted on waiting for Big Brother to make a move together.</p><p>Big Brother was a Foundation Building cultivator. It would be a lot of fuss to disturb his cultivation just for a Qi Refining fatty.</p><p>The scholar kept his eyes fixed on the shadow of the man ahead, saying calmly: “This person is very cautious, only selling a small amount at each shop. But we’ve been secretly following him and he’s already been to seven or eight shops, all selling the same thing. So, the Fire Essence Stones and possessed objects he has must be substantial. To get so many spiritual objects, even if this person has a low cultivation level, you shouldn’t underestimate him. We have to be careful. You should also keep an eye on him and stop talking nonsense, or he might escape with an illusion.”</p><p>After being reprimanded, the strongman had no choice but to suppress his discontent and follow orders.</p><p>Their three brothers had been running their risk-free business in different towns and cities for many years and managed to avoid trouble, all thanks to Second Brother’s planning and tactics, which even Big Brother obeyed. He wouldn’t dare to object either, only grumbling a little.</p><p>After following him for a while, either because the man ahead used up too much spiritual power and couldn’t keep up the magic tool, or because he saw nothing unusual and was not on his guard, his speed gradually slowed down.</p><p>At this moment, the scholar suddenly murmured: “Big Brother is here, take action!”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>The strongman gave a grim smile, stomped on the ground abruptly, and shot into the sky like an arrow, while the scholar followed closely behind. In the blink of an eye, they closed in on the other person, surrounding him on the left and right.</p><p>In their view, the eyes under the mask were full of helplessness and panic.</p><p>A plume of stinking toxic miasma emerged from the hands of the two men and after approaching the opponent, they immediately struck out with the miasma, instantly engulfing him completely.</p><p>“Finished!”</p><p>The strongman was still laughing maniacally.</p><p>But the scholar’s expression changed dramatically. “No good, the toxic miasma is useless! Hurry up, Big Brother!”</p>
