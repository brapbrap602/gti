  Chapter 962 - Gains and Losses

 <div class="chapter-c" id="calibre_link-2349">
  <p class="calibre5">
   Upon hearing Han Xiao say that, Kant naturally misunderstood Han
          Xiao’s intentions and chuckled.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Heh, you are truly open minded. This attitude isn’t too bad, and you
          should strive to keep such an attitude. Right, do you know why the
          Mechanic Emperor chose to attack you? The dynasty asked me to inform
          you of the reason, but there isn’t a need for me to do so if you are
          already aware of it.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I would have to trouble you to explain it to me.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao knew that this matter was related to the Machinery Faith, but
          it would not be a bad thing for him to hear the dynasty’s explanation.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Kant nodded and briefly explained the matter to him. His explanation
          was the same as the introduction of [Key of Adeptus Mechanicus]. The
          reason was to fight for the followers of the Machinery Faith. However,
          he had helped Han Xiao fill in some gaps.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   For example, even though the followers of the Machinery Faith were a
          group of people who believed a little in everyone, a follower was not
          able to give the bonus to more than one Machinery Deity.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Furthermore, only the members of the Machinery Faith could provide
          strength; other followers were not able to trigger the [Key of Adeptus
          Mechanicus]. This was related to some unspoken rule in the Machinery
          Faith. The Arcane Church was the expert in this area, and the dynasty
          had not researched too deeply into it.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Everyone knew that most of the Machinery Faith followers were
          Mechanics, and Manison had the most followers as the publicly
          acknowledged most powerful Mechanic.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The followers of the Machinery Faith were a bunch of pragmatic people.
          To most of the followers, they would follow the most powerful
          Mechanic. If the title of the most powerful Mechanic was changed, they
          would also change their idol. They were not too bothered about
          potential and only cared about who the strongest individual was.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Furthermore, the followers of the Machinery Faith only looked at the
          strength of a Mechanic in his Mechanic related skills and not his
          strength in other areas. Thus, the Mechanics that had a powerful body
          were not able to move them unless they could prove that their strength
          came from the source of being a Mechanic.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I wasn’t able to win against Manison back then. He’s defeated all his
          competitors and sat on the throne of Machinery Faith leader for a long
          time. Thus, there isn’t a need for you to feel discouraged. It is a
          normal thing for you to lose to him in terms of Virtual Technology.”
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Kant twiddled with the leaf on his head and consoled Han Xiao.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He had also been defeated by Manison before. Since he could not defeat
          the other party, he could only take a step back and not snatch
          Manison’s followers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Don’t worry, I’m alright.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao slightly raised his brows.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He did not intend to provoke Manison, and even if he had to become
          enemies with Manison one day, this was not the right time. It was a
          pity that the strength he had received spoiled his plans, and Manison
          had begun targeting him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Indeed, those of the same class were true nemeses!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao then paused for a moment before asking, “What is the attitude
          of the dynasty?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I know what you want to ask. However, don’t count on the dynasty
          standing up for you in this regard,” Kant said. “This isn’t the first
          time that Manison has provoked the other Mechanics. Since there wasn’t
          a risk to your life, there isn’t much that the dynasty can do. If you
          aren’t resigned, you can only issue a challenge in the name of the
          Black Star Army but not the dynasty’s name. Don’t think of using your
          title of being the dynasty’s ally to hold the dynasty hostage. I had a
          miserable lesson in this regard before.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Upon hearing that, Han Xiao shook his head. He now understood the
          dynasty’s attitude toward this matter. The dynasty would only console
          him but not stand up for him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was not the first time that Manison had done something like this.
          At the end of the day, his only motive was to defeat the Mechanics at
          the same level as him to prove that he was the boss. Thus, it was rare
          for lives to be lost. Since it was just a spar between Beyond Grade
          As, he could only blame his own lack of skill if he lost. The three
          Universal Civilizations would not be able to do a thing and would only
          ensure that things did not get blown out of proportion.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Furthermore, Manison was still an important ally of the Federation of
          Light, and his backer was extremely powerful.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Why didn’t the dynasty warn me beforehand?” Han Xiao raised his
          brows.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “You need to use your contribution to exchange for such intelligence,”
          Kant said with a strange tone. “Did the dynasty give you all your
          Class knowledge for free?”
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao was dumbfounded and understood what was going on.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Because a Divine Throne Mechanic might not be familiar with his own
          strength, the properties of [Key of Adeptus Mechanicus] were like
          Ultimate Knowledge and required Contribution Points in exchange for
          them. The three Universal Civilizations would not inform their allies
          about this matter casually, and it was an exception for them to take
          the initiative to explain this matter to Han Xiao.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This meant that the introduction on the interface had saved Han Xiao a
          sum of Contribution Points.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Don’t be too bothered about this. The dynasty didn’t take the
          initiative to inform you about this matter to protect you. They were
          probably afraid that you would try to gather followers after finding
          out about this and create conflicts with others. You have plenty of
          potential, and we are now in a sensitive period. They do not wish for
          you to face an old fogey like Manison head on and hope that you will
          take a step back regarding this matter.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I understand.” Han Xiao did not deny those words.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was indeed the logic of an advanced civilization. They would look
          at all their plans from the perspective of a few decades or centuries.
          The potential that he had shown made the dynasty very patient with him
          and treated him as a long-term chess piece. It would not matter if he
          could not beat Manison. He only needed to live longer than Manison,
          and the dynasty was extremely confident in Black Star’s ability to
          stay alive.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, this went against Han Xiao’s style.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After finishing what the dynasty wanted him to convey, Kant turned
          around and left. “Alright then, everything has already been settled,
          so I shall take my leave.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Isn’t this our first official meeting? Aren’t you going to stay
          behind and chat with me?” Han Xiao asked out of courtesy.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Forget it. It seems like you have plenty of things to take care of.”
          Kant then looked at the devastated main system of the Black Star Army
          and said, “We will have other chances to chat. I shall not disturb you
          today.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As he said that, Kant’s Virtual Soul turned into a ray of light and
          disappeared into the net.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His attitude toward Han Xiao was not too bad, but Kant would not have
          been so friendly if Han Xiao was not at the Divine Throne Mechanic
          level.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After watching Kant leave, Han Xiao heaved a sigh of relief and
          finally had the time to take care of the mess that Manison had left
          behind.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After clearing up the viruses that were left behind in Phillip’s logic
          module, Han Xiao got Phillip to perform a few diagnostics tests and
          confirmed that all the viruses were cleaned up before reopening the
          Black Star Army network.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Thank you, master. I am all recovered now, hum…” Phillip was
          extremely energetic now that he had recovered.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Eh? You called me daddy when you were in danger but changed your
          address now that you are alright,” Han Xiao teased.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Hehehe…” Phillip made a funny face.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Risda then floated to Han Xiao’s side and said, “Your Excellency Black
          Star, with regards to Manison…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I know what you want to say.”
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao then got Phillip to go to the side before looking at Risda
          with a solemn expression.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I am not going to hide things from you. I have always been hesitating
          over whether I should help you because I did not wish to provoke the
          Mechanic Emperor. However, you can see the situation now. If I don’t
          take a step back, both of us will have a conflict in terms of
          benefits.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I understand.” Risda nodded.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I am temporarily unable to beat Manison in terms of Mechanic skills.
          However, I will have a battle with him eventually, so our goals are
          aligned. Helping you complete your wish will weaken Manison. I will
          try my best to find a chance to save your AI civilization.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Previously, Han Xiao would only make excuses whenever Risda brought up
          this matter, but he finally made a promise this time.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The Indestructible Mechanic Empire troop was Manison’s trump card. It
          did not only have a powerful strength but also the Virtual Technology
          skills of the AI life forms. Thus, it was important for him to deal
          with them. If he could complete the entire [Reboot] mission, Manison’s
          strength would definitely decline.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Manison had modified the core logic of all the AI life forms, which
          was akin to brainwashing them. He had the strength of the Divine
          Throne Mechanic and had the rights to undo the brainwashing that
          Manison had done to free them from his clutches.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   However, the gap between them was large, and Han Xiao knew that he
          still needed to raise his Virtual Technology skills.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Furthermore, it would be difficult for him to come into contact with
          the data of the Indestructible Mechanic Empire. Manison would guard it
          tightly for sure.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I shall be at your service from today onward,” Risda said with
          excitement. He had finally received this promise from Black Star after
          waiting for such a long time!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   You make it sound as though I wasn’t making use of you before, Han
          Xiao thought to himself.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Although he had lost, Han Xiao’s mood was not too bad. No one in the
          universe would be able to beat him in terms of confidence.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After sending Risda away, Han Xiao got Phillip to look through the
          database and see how much information had been taken away by Manison.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Phillip then looked through the database and reported to Han Xiao,
          “Master, hum… 43.7% of our commonly accessed data, 35% of our low
          authority restriction data, 21.6% of our mid authority restricted
          data, 11.4% of our high authority restricted data, 2.5% of our
          confidential data, 27% of our blueprints data… Should I restore the
          backup?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Yeah, restore the backup.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao nodded and sighed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He was not too bothered by the loss of data. The data in the army’s
          database was mainly related to the development of the army, and it was
          not too important. Han Xiao got Phillip to make a daily backup of the
          data, and the lost data would be easily recovered.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   It would not matter much to him if Manison snatched that data away.
          There was very little data on himself in the army’s database. All the
          top-secret data was kept in his own mind, and the data that Manison
          had stolen was not too important.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Regardless of whether it was blueprints or Class knowledge, Manison
          had no lack of them. They both specialized in the same things, and it
          would be useless for Manison to obtain his blueprints because Manison
          already had a copy of them. Besides, Han Xiao’s Eternal Light
          blueprint had also been stolen from Manison…
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The thing that concerned Han Xiao the most was the strength that
          Manison had displayed. Manison had only carried out the Virtual
          Intrusion remotely, and his strength was greatly reduced. If he had
          brought all his trump cards along, who knew how powerful Manison would
          be?
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “What a terrifying enemy.” Han Xiao sighed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Losing to Manison was not too embarrassing. As a ‘newbie’ in the
          Beyond Grade A realm, it was not too surprising for him to lose to
          someone at the peak. Furthermore, Manison was not the Tyrant, and both
          of them did not have any grudges between them. Thus, the effect on his
          prestige would be limited. However, he would indeed be unable to shake
          Manison’s status within the Machinery Faith followers, and this was
          Manison’s objective.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He did not care about the views of ordinary galactic residents. Only
          the views of his followers were important.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “It seems like I don’t have to think about the Machinery Faith anytime
          soon. It will be difficult for my strength to exceed Manison during
          the version refresh period,” Han Xiao lamented.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Before his strength as a Mechanic could catch up to Manison, his [Key
          of Adeptus Mechanicus] can only collect dust.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Although Manison made a huge profit, I didn’t suffer a loss.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao looked at his interface and chuckled.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Manison had provided him with two new abilities because Manison ran
          over to fight him. It was truly difficult to tell which party was
          suffering a loss!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   If he could trigger such a mission every time, Han Xiao would not mind
          Manison coming over to his place to play every day.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In the eyes of Han Xiao, Manison was like a walking treasure chest,
          and he might be able to get all the Mechanic talents from Manison.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This saying was true indeed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   …
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Backing out from the quantum network, Han Xiao’s consciousness
          returned to his body. He then picked up his communicator, which had
          been vibrating without stopping. There were a bunch of questions sent
          by Sylvia and the other officers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao replied to them and got them to return to their posts.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After sending out the news, he then looked toward the Black Star
          Guards and Lagi, who had gathered.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Are you alright?” Aurora’s palm glowed, and she was prepared to fill
          Han Xiao up with life force.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I am very good. It is difficult for a virtual battle to threaten my
          life. Manison has retreated already.” Han Xiao waved his arms.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Lagi had a bitter look on his face and said, “To think that the
          Mechanic Emperor has actually set his eyes on us. Our future is bleak.
          As the vice commander of the army, I would like to request for
          sufficient time to train.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Shut up. Go and become the principal obediently,” Han Xiao said with
          exasperation. He understood Lagi too well.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After assuring his officers that he was alright, Han Xiao sent his
          officers away and touched Feidin a few times for luck before closing
          the door.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao then rubbed his hands excitedly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Let me see what I can get. My target this time is Manison. If I still
          draw some tanky talent, I will write my name upside down!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Opening the interface, Han Xiao completed the mission.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
