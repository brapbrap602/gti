<h1>Chapter 849: The Nine Revolutions Yin Body</h1><p>"The Five Yin Mystic Body, though inferior to the Nine Revolutions Yin Body the Alliance Leader seeks, can still barely withstand the erosion of Demonic Qi. It's a pity that this secret method of forcibly infusing Demonic Qi to refine the Five Yin Mystic Body not only has a pitifully low success rate but also has extremely demanding requirements. If I hadn't stumbled upon a Yin Stone in the Seven Kills Hall, I wouldn't have even been able to set up the spirit array. Fortunately, one succeeded. I only hope this Su Nu won't disappoint me..."</p><p>Grandmother Yue mused inwardly, her gaze softening as she looked at Su Nu.</p><p>She took a brocade robe from her storage pouch and draped it over Su Nu, her voice gentle, "Su Nu, you possess the Five Yin Mystic Body, your cultivation will be twice as effective, and your future is limitless.  I've exhausted my resources and traveled for a century to complete this ritual for you. Don't forget me when you achieve greatness."</p><p>Su Nu clutched the robe tightly, nodding slightly.</p><p>She had lost many memories, but those that remained showed that the person before her was her closest relative, the master who loved her most.</p><p>Her initial fear was gone, replaced by a look of childlike affection towards Grandmother Yue.</p><p>Grandmother Yue smiled with satisfaction. "Alright, the spirit array is about to be destroyed by the Demonic Qi backlash. We must leave this place quickly. The journey home is fraught with danger, and I can't protect you all the time. The Demonic Qi within the array is already connected to your Qi. Quickly absorb it and recover your original strength. You might even be able to break through.  It will give you a fighting chance if we encounter any trouble."</p><p>At this moment, Su Nu was not only physically frail but also extremely weak in terms of Qi, only slightly stronger than an ordinary person.</p><p>Su Nu obediently followed Grandmother Yue's instructions and lay back down in the jade coffin.</p><p>Grandmother Yue closed the coffin and gently pushed it to the center of the spirit array.</p><p>The array was peculiar. At its center was a palm-sized square stone, solid and without any openings, yet it continuously emitted a low, mournful whine.</p><p>As the jade coffin rested on the stone, Grandmother Yue once again inscribed blood runes onto it. Unlike last time, these runes were far more complex.</p><p>After completing the runes, Grandmother Yue's hand seals rapidly changed.</p><p>A stream of Demonic Qi, drawn by her, emerged and flowed into the jade coffin.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Su Nu within the coffin was submerged in Demonic Qi.</p><p>This Demonic Qi, unlike the turbulent and unruly Qi outside, was remarkably calm, flowing gently within the coffin.  A vortex gradually formed at the center, directed towards Su Nu's dantian.</p><p>Su Nu lay still, while Grandmother Yue outside seemed even more exhausted.</p><p>As Su Nu absorbed the Demonic Qi, her Qi steadily climbed, breaking through the thirteenth level of Qi Refining in one go before abruptly stopping.</p><p>Just then, cracks appeared at the edge of the spirit array, accompanied by crisp sounds. It was on the verge of collapse.  Grandmother Yue's expression became tense as she stared intently at Su Nu.</p><p>The pause in Su Nu's cultivation didn't last long. She successfully established her foundation, and her Qi continued to surge.</p><p>A look of joy flashed across Grandmother Yue's face. She opened her mouth to speak, then suddenly noticed cracks appearing on the stone at the center of the array. Her eyes widened in alarm, and without hesitation, she flicked her sleeve, shattering the jade coffin and scooping up Su Nu within before retreating rapidly.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Before they could escape the cave, the spirit array was completely destroyed by the Demonic Qi.</p><p>A tremendous roar echoed as the released Demonic Qi, like a ferocious black dragon, unstoppable and destructive, erupted from the depths of the cave. Its terrifying power shocked even Grandmother Yue.</p><p>They fled through the cave, scrambling out and not daring to linger.</p><p>At the top of the valley, Qin Sang and the other two sensed the disturbance and looked down into the mist-filled depths.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Grandmother Yue and Su Nu burst out of the mist, followed closely by a terrifying black shadow, like a dark behemoth rising from the abyss.</p><p>Witnessing this, the three exchanged grave looks.</p><p>Clearly, the dark behemoth was formed by Demonic Qi. Somehow, Grandmother Yue had triggered its eruption.  Unable to suppress it, they could only watch as it surged skyward, creating a phenomenon visible for hundreds of miles.</p><p>This island was home to countless demonic beasts.</p><p>Arriving had been easy; leaving safely would be another matter.</p><p>"Reverend Qing Feng, catch Su Nu!"</p><p>With the Demonic Qi closing in, Grandmother Yue shouted urgently, flinging Su Nu towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly channeled his True Essence, creating a gentle force to catch Su Nu.  He noticed how light she was, as if weightless, and couldn't help but glance at her.</p><p>Having nearly been swallowed by the Demonic Qi, Su Nu looked slightly frightened but remained composed. She softly said, "Thank you, Reverend."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something peculiar about Su Nu's Qi. It was faintly similar to Demonic Qi. She had been cultivating using Demonic Qi, which was extremely rare in the mortal realm.</p><p>She seemed to be employing some unique technique, making her body as light as a feather.</p><p>Carrying a low-level cultivator while using escape techniques would inevitably impact speed and energy consumption. Su Nu's technique would likely mitigate this.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, grasped Su Nu's wrist, and retreated from the valley entrance in a series of flashes.</p><p>At the same time, Grandmother Yue was overtaken by the Demonic Qi.  Her silk thread magic treasure formed a net to shield her from the impact, but its spiritual light rapidly dimmed and then vanished as it was engulfed.</p><p>A scream pierced the air as the Demonic Qi collided with Grandmother Yue's protective aura.</p><p>Fortunately, Elder Bamboo Mountain and Kong Yun reacted swiftly. Seeing the danger, they immediately charged back into the valley, deploying their magic treasures to help Grandmother Yue withstand the impact at the last moment, rescuing her.</p><p>'Whoosh, whoosh...'</p><p>Elder Bamboo Mountain and Kong Yun supported Grandmother Yue, one on each side, and flew to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>By now, the Demonic Qi had dispersed the mist and soared into the sky.</p><p>A black pillar of Qi was clearly visible against the dawn sky, forming a massive black cloud high above.  Powerful shockwaves spread outwards, awakening the sleeping demonic beasts in the mountains.</p><p>Ignoring the damage to her magic treasure, Grandmother Yue barked, "Let's go!"</p><p>Knowing the danger they were in, the group didn't hesitate. They protected Su Nu in their midst and fled along the path they had come, using all their speed.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others wisely refrained from asking about Su Nu's identity.</p><p>...</p><p>The Demonic Qi eruption had stirred the demonic island into a frenzy.  Weaker beasts were terrified, while powerful demons raced towards the black cloud.</p><p>Not far from the valley, a magnificent golden eagle, leading several hawks and vultures, flew towards the disturbance. Upon seeing the black pillar, the golden eagle screeched, abandoned its followers, and transformed into a golden streak of lightning.</p><p>Within a cave, a giant bear, awakened by the Demonic Qi's波动, opened its copper-bell eyes, radiating a menacing aura.  Sensing the golden eagle's approach into its territory, it flew into a rage.</p>
