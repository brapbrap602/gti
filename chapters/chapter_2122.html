<h1>Chapter 2112:  No Tribulation</h1><p>Could these visions be heart demons?</p><p>Qin Sang was alert.</p><p>Becoming an immortal had been his lifelong pursuit, his greatest obsession.</p><p>The Heart Demon Tribulation isn't always about triggering one's deepest fears and most traumatic memories.  It can also target one's obsessions.</p><p>It waits until one's guard is down, then delivers a fatal blow—a tragedy born of joy.</p><p>The Heart Demon Tribulation follows the Lightning Tribulation, highlighting its danger. Once lost within it, escape becomes impossible.</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>“Master Qin!”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone flew to the island, seeing Qin Sang sitting cross-legged. Although his body was charred black, looking somewhat comical, he was still alive.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as they landed beside Qin Sang, he suddenly flashed back several meters, his eyes wary, regarding them as mortal enemies, sword energy flickering in his palm.</p><p>"Master, you don't recognize me? I'm your little Fatty Chicken!"</p><p>Since Qin Sang had successfully broken through, Fatty Chicken’s attitude was vastly different, fawning and eager to approach, only to be grabbed by Bai.</p><p>"Brother Qin, are you still thinking you're in the Heart Demon Tribulation?"</p><p>Bai guessed the reason.</p><p>A moment passed in the real world, but for someone undergoing the Heart Demon Tribulation, countless years might have passed in the illusion.  Sudden awakening makes it hard to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>Bai gestured for everyone to step back, giving Qin Sang time.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at everyone, then down at his own disheveled appearance, his eyes flickering. Finally, he confirmed he wasn't in a Heart Demon Tribulation. This was real.</p><p>He had successfully passed the tribulation!</p><p>There was no Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>Only one explanation accounted for this situation—the jade Buddha!</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished by the jade Buddha's power. He had anticipated that under its protection, the power of the heart demons might be weakened, making his tribulation easier.</p><p>Incredibly, the jade Buddha had completely eliminated the Heart Demon Tribulation, the most dreaded ordeal for cultivators!</p><p>“What level of treasure is the jade Buddha?”</p><p>Qin Sang was lost in thought.</p><p>If this got out, the entire cultivation world would go mad.</p><p>The heavenly treasures recorded in ancient texts, no matter how precious or rare, could at most stabilize one's mind, increasing the chances of successfully passing a tribulation. No one had ever heard of one eliminating the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>He had already placed the jade Buddha very highly, but now it seemed he had still underestimated it.</p><p>“I’m a Yuan Ying cultivator?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, inspecting his nascent soul. His eyes gradually cleared.  Spiritual light flowed over him, healing his wounds, and he donned a new Taoist robe.</p><p>“Congratulations, Brother Qin, on your ascension to Yuan Ying!”</p><p>Bai offered his congratulations.</p><p>“Congratulations, Master!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Master Qin!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Master!”</p><p>…</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the three demons bowed together, using various titles, their faces beaming with joy and envy.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded, looking around, feeling refreshed.</p><p>The spirit island on the lake, birds and fish playing.</p><p>Everything around him was under his control!</p><p>Qin Sang felt boundless joy, suddenly letting out a roar that shook the heavens.</p><p>…</p><p>After a stick of incense.</p><p>Everyone sped across the Yun Cang Great Marsh, returning to the cave abode. Qin Sang, newly entered into the Yuan Ying stage, needed to close himself off to consolidate his cultivation.</p><p>“Master, should we hold a Yuan Ying celebration, establish a sect?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu took the initiative to ask.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, saying calmly, “I still have unfinished business! If I held a Yuan Ying ceremony now, how could I give that person the greatest surprise? Besides, the identity of the Bright Moon Demon King must remain hidden. As for establishing a sect…”</p><p>After a moment’s thought, Qin Sang said,  “The Abyss of Sin is not yet pacified, and the cultivation world is in turmoil. Now is not the best time. When you travel, if you encounter promising disciples, you can mentor them, but don’t publicly accept disciples yet. In the future, the sect will be called Qingyang Temple.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t have any attachment to establishing a sect. He originally wanted to take a few disciples to handle some chores, so he wouldn't have to do everything himself.</p><p>Since Youyunzi had a wish to rebuild Qingyang Temple, and Qin Sang had received considerable kindness from three generations of Qingyang Temple disciples, he decided to continue using that name for his sect.</p><p>“This disciple thanks Master on behalf of our ancestor!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu's eyes welled up. He carried his ancestor's legacy, yet he was only at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>The responsibility was immense, heavy as a mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang’s actions were tantamount to taking the weight off his shoulders.</p><p>“There’s no need for such formalities.”</p><p>Qin Sang helped Li Yu Fu up, encouraging him, “You are the true successor of your predecessor. I see you'll soon break through to the mid-Golden Core stage. With your talent, you have great hope of reaching the Nascent Soul stage.  From now on, don't let external matters distract you. Focus on your cultivation and reach the Nascent Soul stage as soon as possible, so I can rest assured about leaving Qingyang Temple in your hands and go on my travels.”</p><p>Having said that, Qin Sang looked towards the three demons and said to Xiaobai, “You don’t need to come back with me. Return to Qianshan Bamboo Sea now and tell Daoist Liu the good news. I will temporarily stay in Yuanshen Sect for secluded cultivation. If anything major happens, send me a message.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The three demons, reluctant to leave, bid farewell to Qin Sang and returned to Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang and the two others arrived near Yuanshen Sect, and Li Yu Fu parted ways with them, returning to his cave abode alone.</p><p>That cave abode was suitable for Golden Core cultivators, but seemed rather humble for a Nascent Soul master. Fortunately, Qin Sang possessed a Yuanshen Sect Elder's token, allowing free access to the sect, so he wasn't in a hurry to find a new abode.  It would be even better to see Senior Sister Qing Jun.</p><p>Li Yu Fu went back and told Tan Yi En and the others the good news; their excitement is needless to say.</p><p>Yuanshen Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his cultivation, disguising himself as a Golden Core cultivator, and arrived at the gate, only to find the Yuanshen Sect guards were much stricter than usual.</p><p>“Who's there!”</p><p>A group of disciples flew out from the gate, halting Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations from Qin Sang, the disciples' expressions stiffened. Upon seeing the token in Qin Sang's hand, their faces turned pale with alarm. They hurriedly activated the protective formation, stepping forward to salute, “Greetings, Elder Qin! We disciples were blind and heedless, please punish us, Elder Qin!”</p><p>“You are guarding the sect; there's no fault. Get up.”</p><p>Qin Sang was in a very good mood and naturally wouldn't make things difficult for these disciples.</p><p>Entering Yuanshen Sect, Qin Sang paused, asking, “Is the Ancestor within the sect?”</p><p>“Reporting to Elder Qin, to our knowledge, the Ancestor and the other Elders went to the front lines and haven't returned.”</p><p>The leading disciple replied.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, and flashed towards the Yuanshen Sect's restricted area.</p><p>After Qin Sang's figure disappeared into the restricted area, the other disciples gathered around.</p><p>“Is this the legendary, mysterious Elder Qin?”</p><p>“So young! And so approachable!”</p><p>“That’s called charisma!”</p><p>“I heard that Elder Qin appeared out of nowhere, a late Golden Core stage expert, deeply trusted by the Ancestor, allowed to cultivate in the restricted area. Do you think the Ancestor is grooming him as the next sect leader?”</p><p>“Possible! In this great war, so many elders have gone, yet an Elder with such high cultivation is left behind.  It must be to protect Elder Qin!”</p><p>…</p><p>(End)</p>
