<h1>Chapter 1916: Rainbow’s Appearance and Disappearance</h1><p>Qin Sang followed a group of ghosts and spirits.</p><p>It was a rarely used mountain path, overgrown with weeds as tall as a person.  Legend had it that this path led to Zeyang Prefecture to the east, but few dared to travel it, except for bold merchants seeking a shortcut, or martial artists.  Over time, it had become even more desolate.</p><p>The screech of night owls sounded like the cries of ghosts.</p><p>A group of ‘ghosts’ were indeed silently moving along the mountain path.</p><p>The rugged path did not hinder them in the least. The group of spirits crossed several mountains before suddenly veering off the path, following a valley deep into the mountains.</p><p>The deep mountain forest was shrouded in thick night fog.</p><p>After a period of hurried travel, a small path paved with blue stone slabs appeared ahead.</p><p>The path wound and climbed upwards, disappearing into the woods.</p><p>After rounding a bend, the spirits did not continue forward but instead concealed their auras, quietly approaching a mountain wall.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu raised his hand and made a magical gesture.</p><p>The surface of the mountain wall bulged, rippling like satin, transforming into a square human face. Its eyes rolled, and upon seeing the group of spirits, it immediately disappeared, and the mountain wall silently opened a passage.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu led his subordinates into the mountain wall.</p><p>“Greetings, City God!”</p><p>Inside the mountain wall, a surprisingly large space seemed to have been hollowed out, crammed with ghosts and spirits, all paying homage to Gao Ruoxu.</p><p>Two figures led them—a man and a woman.</p><p>The man was clad in black armor, appearing formidable, while the woman wore a white dress and skirt, equally serious. These were Gao Ruoxu’s subordinate Martial Judge and Literary Judge, second only to the City God in the City God Temple.</p><p>“How are the demons on the mountain?”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu asked in a low voice.</p><p>“We've investigated. They're a group of fox spirits with considerable power. The Taoists in the Yu Bai Temple were likely all murdered by these demons; their evil deeds must be punished!” the Martial Judge said angrily.</p><p>The Literary Judge calmly stated, “Two martial artists passed through here this afternoon and were taken into the temple by the fox spirits.  To avoid alarming them, we didn't intervene.”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu nodded. “Based on their usual behavior, they likely know we pay close attention to mortals. They probably only absorbed some yang energy from the two mortals before releasing them, avoiding killing them.  I fear, however, the temple’s Taoists are likely in grave danger!”</p><p>In this area, both the divine and immortal paths coexisted.</p><p>Immortal cultivators, as long as they did not massacre people, practice demonic arts, or perform blood sacrifices, and simply cultivated quietly in the mountains, would not be bothered by the spirits and ghosts.</p><p>The mountaintop and the mountain base seemed to be divided into Yin and Yang realms. Unless they had personal connections, they generally kept to themselves.</p><p>The Taoists on this mountain were the same, living in seclusion for years, with only the temple master occasionally visiting Gao Ruoxu.</p><p>At some point, the temple was usurped by a group of fox spirits, and all the Taoists disappeared.</p><p>Yu Bai Temple was far from the world, and the fox spirits had hidden themselves well, initially undetected by the ghosts and spirits of Beikuo County.</p><p>But some impatient lesser demons went down the mountain to abduct mortals, using demonic magic to charm and absorb yang energy to cultivate.</p><p>Although the mortals survived, they inevitably became listless and dazed.  When the number of such people increased, it was noticed by the underworld officials, who began a covert investigation.</p><p>The investigation startled Gao Ruoxu. Quite a few of the local solitary cultivators around Beikuo County had mysteriously disappeared. Most were dedicated to cultivation, with few friends—clearly, carefully selected targets.</p><p>All clues pointed to Yu Bai Temple.</p><p>Such a tragedy occurring under his nose, even if the missing were all cultivators, Gao Ruoxu could not ignore it.</p><p>“Is the Confinement Immortal Array set up?”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu looked at the Literary Judge.</p><p>The Literary Judge replied affirmatively, adding, “As per your instructions, we have determined that these fox spirits are still using Yu Bai Temple’s old formation. There’s not much damage inside the temple. The Taoists probably didn’t notice the demons sneaking in and were overcome from within.  These fox spirits are likely not as strong as we initially thought.”</p><p>“But we can’t underestimate them. The master of Yu Bai Temple was a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, with several powerful spells, yet even his temple was taken,” Gao Ruoxu shook his head, flicking his sleeve, sending out a silver spiritual talisman.  “I’ve personally written a Mountain-Subduing Incantation. We must seize this opportunity and take down these demons without letting a single one escape!  As soon as the fox spirits release those two people, we attack!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The Martial and Literary Judges bowed, each leading half of the underworld officials, and their figures sank into the ground.</p><p>Until dawn.</p><p>Several white figures suddenly ran down the mountain.</p><p>Three tiny white foxes frolicked along a stone path, chasing each other into the grass, playfully squabbling and emitting joyful chirps.  These adorable creatures each carried a swirling white mist atop their heads, within which lay two unconscious men in black.</p><p>Both men were powerfully built, with swords at their waists, clearly skilled warriors, yet they lay passively at the mercy of the foxes. Their eyes were sunken, their complexions pale, but their faces held serene smiles, as if lost in pleasant dreams or reliving cherished memories.</p><p>The foxes led the men to a secluded, overgrown area far from the Yu Bai Temple, and left them there unconscious.  The men had been enchanted; upon waking, they remembered nothing.</p><p>On their return, a sudden gust of chilling wind enveloped the three foxes.</p><p>"Chirp! Chirp!"</p><p>The foxes cried out in alarm, struggling against the wind's powerful grip, but their cries were swallowed by the gale, and they were whisked away.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gao Ruoxu returned to the stone path, accompanied only by a group of local earth gods.  A short distance ahead, the path abruptly ended, revealing a small temple nestled in the mountains.  Hidden within the woods, it was a place of serene beauty, a sanctuary far from the world.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu surveyed the area and commanded, "Create fog!"</p><p>The earth gods responded instantly.  Each carried a staff topped with a carved dragon's head, a symbol of their authority – some called them "Earth God's Staffs," others "Land Guiding Staves."  They raised their staffs, waving them towards the valley below.  Mist gathered, swirling and coalescing until a thick fog enveloped the mountain peaks.  The area was remote; a simple spell sufficed to conceal the upcoming battle's spectacle.</p><p>As the fog thickened, Gao Ruoxu held aloft a silver talisman and tossed it into the air, shouting,  "Move the mountain!"</p><p>The mountain gods obeyed, sinking into the earth.  The ground trembled violently. Surrounding peaks shook, one in particular shuddering intensely as rocks tumbled down its slopes.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>In the clear sky, a deafening clap of thunder echoed. The mountain inexplicably swelled a hundred meters taller.  Closer inspection revealed that the mountain wasn't growing; it was being lifted, its base torn from the earth, the power of the mountain gods at work!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Gao Ruoxu performed a hand gesture, sending the silver talisman into the mountain. The mountain's surface seemed coated in silver, becoming impossibly heavy.</p><p>Inside Yu Bai Temple, the quiet chambers once occupied by Taoist priests were now overrun by fox spirits.  The external commotion startled them.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Dozens of white figures burst from the rooms – over thirty white foxes, some still behaving like animals, others standing upright.</p><p>Urgent fox calls from the courtyard escalated into panicked screams. All the foxes stared blankly upwards, the temple and its inhabitants enveloped by an immense shadow.  A mountain, hurtling directly towards them.</p><p>"Chirp!"</p><p>Terror gripped the foxes, even the elder foxes exhibiting fear and confusion.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu's eyes, sharp as lightning, observed the fox spirits within the temple. He sneered, "Mere late-stage spirit demons, daring to wreak havoc under this City God's jurisdiction!"</p><p>Subduing these foxes was a simple task for Beikuang County's deities. The concern was that surviving temple inhabitants, driven to desperation, might unleash a bloodbath. Therefore, he used the mountain moving spell to break the temple's protective array and capture the foxes swiftly.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The silver mountain sliced through the air, crashing towards the temple's mountain peak.  Violent winds uprooted trees, the impending collision promising catastrophic devastation, burying the foxes beneath the mountain's weight.  By the time they perceived the danger, it was too late. They could only see the shattered base of the silver mountain as it descended.</p><p>In their terror, the foxes desperately activated the Yu Bai Temple's protective barrier.  A beam of green light shot from the temple, transforming into a colossal cypress tree in mid-air. Its branches spread wide, shading the temple with its leaves, scattering a shower of green light.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The silver mountain struck just as the cypress materialized.  The cypress blazed with dazzling green light, shedding branches and leaves like rain, yet ultimately overwhelmed by the mountain's weight, cracking and splintering under the relentless impact.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Finally, under the fearful gaze of the fox spirits, the cypress tree snapped, scattering green light.  The fox spirits, not being the masters of the Daoist temple, were unfamiliar with the temple's protective array.  Their hasty activation was easily broken by Yin Shan's single strike!</p><p>Gao Ruoxu had anticipated this. With a flick of his finger, he stopped Yin Shan, now embedded in the shattered array, mid-air.</p><p>Terrified, the fox spirits lost all will to fight and scattered in a panicked flight.</p><p>Before they could escape the courtyard walls, billowing black mist and icy winds surged into the temple from all directions.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The chilling winds and impenetrable darkness enveloped the temple.  Not only did this obscure vision, but it also disrupted the fox spirits' spiritual senses.  The weaker ones were instantly disoriented.</p><p>Frantic cries erupted.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A black chain suddenly shot from the mist, striking a dazed fox spirit.  The creature offered no resistance, bound and dragged into the depths of the mist, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu entered the temple, his eyes swiftly scanning the quiet rooms, searching for survivors.</p><p>The local earth gods, needing no instructions from the City God, sprang into action.  They tapped their earth staves, causing green light to erupt beneath the fox spirits, sprouting vines that bound them tightly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, only the most powerful fox spirits remained.</p><p>The Judge of Civil and Military Affairs, along with the Yama's attendants, materialized, charging towards the remaining fox spirits.  Their formations shifted rapidly, easily separating and isolating their opponents.</p><p>Despite their cunning magic, the fox spirits were gradually overwhelmed by the concerted assault of the ghosts and gods.  Their strength lay in enchantment, not direct combat, and they had no chance to use their abilities.</p><p>One by one, the fox spirits were captured, without Gao Ruoxu needing to lift a finger.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu remained vigilant against any lurking demons, but no further surprises occurred.</p><p>He noticed a quiet room, dashed inside, dispelled the magical seal on the door, and pushed it open.  Inside, he found a dozen or so cultivators, all familiar faces.</p><p>However, far more cultivators had gone missing during this time.  Yu Bai Temple was left with only two Daoists; the rest, including the temple master, were unaccounted for!</p><p>The cultivators were in poor condition, their cultivation suppressed, their faces pale and their vitality depleted.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu dispelled the magic affecting them; two immediately collapsed.</p><p>"The others…"</p><p>"Master… they… they were drained of their essence by those fox spirits!  City God, you must avenge us, kill those fox spirits, avenge Master and Grandmaster!"  The surviving Yu Bai Temple Daoists wailed.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu sighed.  Returning to the temple, he found all the fox spirits apprehended, shackled, and none escaped.</p><p>He surveyed the temple, feeling something was amiss, and pointed at the oldest fox spirit.  "Bring it forward!"</p><p>…</p><p>As the ghosts and gods appeared, preparing to break the temple's protective array…</p><p>In the innermost chamber of Yu Bai Temple—once the master's retreat—a young man sat cross-legged.</p><p>The youth, with rosy lips, white teeth, and an exceptionally handsome face, possessed the cultivation of a mid-Golden Core stage cultivator.  He was meditating with his eyes closed when he sensed something, opened his eyes, and furrowed his brow.</p><p>"So fast!  Hmph! I knew those sly foxes wouldn't be able to resist.  They must have harassed mortals again and left a trail. The Bei Kuo County City God has some ability; I had to abandon these foxes!  Unfortunately, my injuries aren't fully healed.  Without the fox spirits to help me replenish my Yang energy, it'll be troublesome…"</p><p>The youth shook his head, coughed into his hand, and produced a small wooden carving.  He imbued it with a drop of his essence blood. The carving erupted in bloody light, enveloping him.</p><p>The youth gradually faded, becoming a blood shadow, then completely disappearing.</p><p>In a nearby mountain, a sapling suddenly withered, revealing the youth's form.  He silently escaped the encirclement, undetected by even Gao Ruoxu.</p><p>The youth produced a talisman, its surface radiating faint electric sparks and rainbow light.  With a backhand strike, he transformed into a faint rainbow light and vanished into the morning mist, faster than lightning. Even if Gao Ruoxu had questioned him, he would not have been able to catch him.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang stood atop a mountain peak, observing everything.</p><p>The youth's cultivation surpassed even Gao Ruoxu's, yet he abandoned his companions and fled without a fight, surprising him.  Even more surprising was the talisman the youth used!</p><p>Qin Sang reached out.</p><p>The youth, using the talisman to flee, suddenly felt a tightening sensation, a dizzying disorientation, and he crashed to the ground. He looked up to see a Daoist standing before him.  Quickly, he knelt and kowtowed repeatedly.  "Senior, spare my life! Senior, spare my life!"</p><p>"Where did you learn this Rainbow Apparition Talisman?" Qin Sang asked. The Rainbow Apparition Talisman was a thunder talisman recorded in the Five Thunder Envoy's seal!</p><p>"Rainbow… Senior, you mean this Rainbow Electric Talisman?" The youth trembled, unable to hide the truth. "Junior is originally from Ji State.  After the Ji State's major sect, Lei Xiao Sect, crumbled, its scriptures spread far and wide.  Many cultivators around Ji State know some thunder techniques. Junior obtained this talisman's method by exchanging a family heirloom scripture with the Wu Hui Sect…"</p>
