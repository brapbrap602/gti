<h1>Chapter 1233: Purgatory</h1><p>Holding the jade pendant, Gong Liangyu seemed more confident, his expression slightly softening.  He held the figurine in one hand and the jade pendant in the other.  He then jumped into the blood lake.</p><p>…</p><p>The moment he touched the blood, Qin Sang felt an evil force invading his body, penetrating everywhere.  A strange chill seeped into his mind and bones.  Qin Sang, unusually, shivered, his face slightly changing.</p><p>Remembering his use of the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire to withstand the poisonous mist during his gamble with the Qieji Demon King, he tried the same technique, summoning the magic fire to form a fiery armor around his body.  Unexpectedly, the chill was incredibly strange, penetrating the magic fire.  He then transformed the fire armor into Ancestral Saint Fire, but it was still ineffective. Only when he withdrew the spiritual fire and activated his True Yuan to form armor did he feel any improvement. Fortunately, the True Yuan consumption wasn't too rapid, having little effect on him as a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The surroundings were blood-red, the blood swirling and gurgling, flowing towards an unknown destination. Qin Sang could sense that the evil force originated from a strange power within the blood, carrying him towards an unknown place.  He looked around, then his figure plummeted, feeling a release as he finally broke free from the blood's grip.</p><p>Below the blood was an unknown space filled with blood mist.</p><p>Qin Sang observed cautiously as he descended, soon landing on hard ground. The evil force persisted, filling the entire space through the blood mist.  He dared not remove his spiritual armor, but instead flicked his sleeve, releasing three magic banners that circled him protectively.  Simultaneously, he summoned the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, as the head of the Shaohua Mountain sect, must have studied the "Cultivating the Soul and Nurturing the Sword" chapter. Qin Sang's cultivation of this technique was known to Dongyang Bo.  If he used the Ebony Sword and sword formations in front of Dongyang Bo, even without seeing the second part of the technique, Dongyang Bo would surely suspect something and guess Qin Sang's identity.  Therefore, Qin Sang minimized his sword techniques, planning to rely primarily on the magic banners and magic fire, and avoid using the Seven Souls Killing Formation as much as possible. Eighteen magic banners were sufficient to handle any crisis.</p><p>As Qin Sang summoned his treasures, the Sky-Eye Butterfly awoke. It still preferred to rest on Qin Sang's shoulder, rubbing its soft wings against his cheek, close to its master. The Sky-Eye Butterfly had the ability to protect itself, so Qin Sang didn't worry about its safety.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly's vigilance allowed its sight to pierce through the blood mist, revealing a wider area. After some probing, Qin Sang determined that the blood mist only slightly obscured vision and had little effect on his spiritual sense; as long as he resisted the evil erosion, it posed no significant threat.</p><p>However, according to their gathered information, the interior of the blood lake was like purgatory.  They were warned not to extend their spiritual sense too far, lest they accidentally trigger mechanisms and attract danger.  The records were vague, and Qin Sang didn't know what was here, but caution was certainly necessary. He kept his spiritual sense within a ten-foot radius.  He had the Sky-Eye Butterfly; he didn't need to rely heavily on his spiritual sense.</p><p>Activating his Sky-Eye Divine Ability to see the surroundings clearly, Qin Sang finally understood why this place was called purgatory.</p><p>He stood on a barren rock; not far ahead was a mountain.  This mountain was also a stone mountain, devoid of soil, vegetation, or living creatures. The mountain was completely blood-red, whether dyed by the ubiquitous blood mist or inherently so.</p><p>The sight on the stone mountain was terrifying.</p><p>Lightning flashed and thunder boomed; an incessant evil wind blew.  The lightning was also blood-red. In the sky above the stone mountain, blood-red thunderbolts, thousands and tens of thousands of them, surged incessantly, as if intent on destroying everything around the mountain.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The thunder was deafening, shaking the mind.  These blood-red thunderbolts were certainly not benign; Qin Sang had no desire to experience their power.</p><p>The stone mountain endured the relentless bombardment day and night, yet remained unharmed for countless years, either due to its unique material or protective enchantments. Each blood-red thunderbolt that struck the mountain bloomed into a scarlet thunder flower, scattering wisps of blood energy that couldn't shake the mountain in the least.</p><p>The evil wind was also formidable, constantly circling the mountain. Sometimes, even the blood-red thunderbolts were dispersed by the wind, demonstrating its power.</p><p>The stone mountain endured, but human life could not.</p><p>Remembering his previous conjectures about the Abyssal Ruins, if someone were suppressed here, subjected to the relentless lightning strikes and the erosion of the evil wind, the torment would be no less than the tortures of hell. Even the most heinous criminals would find such punishment sufficient.</p><p>This unremarkable Fenglei Mountain, according to records, hardly warrants the fear and comparison to hell that previous adventurers felt towards the Blood Lake.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's Hun Yuan Tong Xin ring flashed, and Pang Ji hopped out.</p><p>"Any reaction?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Pang Ji remained silent, opening its mouth to release the orb.  After several breaths of its vital energy, the orb slowly ascended, hovering three inches above Pang Ji's head.</p><p>The orb pulsed with light, seemingly breathing, its fluorescence warding off the malevolent energies.</p><p>After a moment, a look of disappointment crossed Pang Ji's eyes. "If my mother were nearby, we could use the Lei Nian Orb and our bloodline connection to sense each other's location… but the orb is unresponsive."</p><p>After Qin Sang learned the range, he reassured Pang Ji, "Don't worry. The Blood Lake's interior is vast; exploring even the outer regions will take time.  And these outer areas are full of places like this Fenglei Mountain. Even your mother, with her abilities, could easily be trapped if she were to fall into one."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured towards a nearby stone mountain, his tone flat. He stood before the mountain but dared not approach.</p><p>The chilling wind and blood lightning enveloped the surrounding area, their residual energy affecting anyone nearby. Qin Sang suspected that venturing inside would be far more dangerous than just the wind and lightning; the mountain held unseen, unpredictable restrictions.</p><p>The sight of the mountain made Qin Sang's heart pound.  Reason told him to avoid it completely.</p><p>Pang Ji was overjoyed at the prospect but then voiced a concern, "What if this delays the Lord's mission?"</p><p>"I am alone and lack trust; a slight delay won't be a bad thing. However, we must first locate the places marked on this map and confirm their positions," Qin Sang replied calmly.</p><p>He had no intention of being the first to confront Ye Laomo, preferring to assess the situation first.  He also planned to circumnavigate the Blood Lake, to see if the Killing Sword's spirit would react.</p><p>Qin Sang produced a piece of animal hide with roughly sketched lines – a copy of the incomplete map left by a previous Blood Lake explorer, courtesy of Lord Tongyou.  Whether it remains accurate after all these years was unknown.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Fenglei Mountain before them was not depicted on the map.</p><p>As Qin Sang ordered Pang Ji to follow, and just as they started to go around the mountain, dozens of blood lightning bolts, without warning, suddenly changed course and struck at them!</p>
