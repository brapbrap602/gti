<h1>第一千三百七十六章 流言</h1><p>"Hiss..."</p><p>Waves of pain came from my meridians.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow slightly, then his expression returned to normal, and he entered meditation.</p><p>In fact, simply restoring true essence was not so troublesome.</p><p>While crossing the storm belt, Qin Sang frequently consumed elixirs and directly absorbed spiritual power from spirit stones. Residual medicinal power and impurities accumulated in his body, and he had been unable to refine them, damaging his meridians and qi sea, affecting himself. His true essence became disordered, and coupled with other injuries, it caused so many twists and turns.</p><p>More than a month later.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled a long breath of turbid air.</p><p>He inspected himself internally.</p><p>His injuries had healed, his true essence was full, and he finally had the confidence to travel outside.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned his Nascent Soul Puppet.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet's body was a natural treasure of heaven and earth and was not so easily destroyed, but the puppet seals inside it had collapsed in pieces during the great battle. Qin Sang needed to repair it personally.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>All the members of the Myriad Sword Sect crowded into the main hall.</p><p>The hall doors were wide open, with bright spring sunshine, singing birds, and fragrant flowers outside.</p><p>No one was blocking the entrance, but no one dared to take a step out of the hall.</p><p>Although, they did not know that in a corner of the hall, a beautiful Phoenix Butterfly was quietly lying there.</p><p>Qin Sang borrowed the cave and didn't want to start a killing spree, so he ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to be on guard outside and keep an eye on these people. If anyone disobeyed his orders, tried to escape, or send messages outside, he would take action.</p><p>The hall was deathly silent.</p><p>After the initial panic, the mood of the sect members had stabilized slightly.</p><p>Even so, no one could practice in peace. Everyone had a wooden expression, and they looked towards the direction of the cave from time to time, silently waiting for their final fate.</p><p>"Senior Sister, did that senior say when he would leave?"</p><p>A Foundation Establishment Late Stage man carefully transmitted his voice.</p><p>The female cultivator who had previously replied to Qin Sang was the personal disciple of the Myriad Sword Sect's Sect Master and also the First Disciple of the Myriad Sword Sect. Hearing her Junior Brother's voice transmission, she simply shook her head slightly.</p><p>The man said dryly, "Senior Sister, don't worry, that senior's cultivation is peerless, he shouldn't lie and deceive us."</p><p>But his tone didn't seem very confident.</p><p>The female cultivator was silent for a while, then she thought quietly, "Fortunately, the Sect Master and Junior Brother are outside, I only hope they don't come back so soon. No matter what happens, at least our Myriad Sword Sect won't have its lineage cut off..."</p><p>In this region, the Myriad Sword Sect could also be called a hegemonic power.</p><p>As the Myriad Sword Sect Sect Master's disciple, and with her own Pseudo Core Realm cultivation, the nearby cultivators treated her with utmost respect.</p><p>Only now did she understand how powerless she was when facing a true expert.</p><p>The other party only needed a finger to easily make the Myriad Sword Sect disappear from the world. Even if the Yin Moon Sect got the news, it would most likely turn a blind eye and would not offend a Nascent Soul cultivator for them.</p><p>They were fish on a chopping board, and they could only hope that the other party was not a bloodthirsty and cruel demon.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>A muffled sound came from the direction of the cave.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a stream of light shot out from the hall, and before everyone could see what the stream of light was, it disappeared into the sky.</p><p>The hall erupted in an uproar.</p><p>The female cultivator stood up abruptly, her expression changing uncertainly.</p><p>The others dared not move randomly and looked at the female cultivator.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, the female cultivator walked tremblingly towards the cave. She saw that the cave door had been opened, and it was empty, leaving behind a bag of spirit stones.</p><p>The female cultivator's heart suddenly relaxed, and she almost collapsed to the ground.</p><p>...</p><p>"That is Wind Yang Mountain..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the summit of a desolate mountain, looking at the majestic peak in the distance.</p><p>Wind Yang Mountain towered into the clouds, its momentum magnificent.</p><p>The surrounding myriad mountains seemed to gather their essence in one place at Wind Yang Mountain, making it a veritable immortal mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang had come non-stop after leaving the Myriad Sword Sect.</p><p>Below Wind Yang Mountain was the largest market in the vicinity, a good place to inquire about news.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heaven's Eye, spying on Wind Yang Mountain from a distance. He discovered that the spirit array on the mountain had been fully activated, surrounded by immortal clouds and heavily guarded, sure enough, something big was happening.</p><p>However, the market below the mountain looked normal, with a steady stream of people at the city gate, everything was normal.</p><p>It seemed that only the important places on the mountain were heavily guarded.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Qin Sang changed his appearance, dressed in a Daoist robe, and suppressed his cultivation to the Golden Core Stage. He activated his movement technique and flew leisurely towards Wind Yang Mountain.</p><p>The market was a city, built against the mountain.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang arrived at the city gate.</p><p>Sensing the aura Qin Sang revealed, the crowd immediately cleared a path.</p><p>The guard first bowed, then said politely, "Please show your fish token, Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed that the cultivators entering and leaving the market all held a fishbone-shaped token in their hands, presumably something similar to an identity token.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators could enter the city at will, but Golden Core cultivators could not avoid the custom.</p><p>He shook his head, "This poor Daoist has come from afar, I have long heard of the great name of Wind Shang, and I admire him in my heart. This is my first time at Wind Yang Mountain, and I have not yet received a fish token."</p><p>The guard dared not make things difficult and took out a golden fish token, "May I ask for Senior's Daoist name?"</p><p>"This poor Daoist is called Mingyue!" (Bright Moon)</p><p>...</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang entered the city, with a golden fish token in his hand.</p><p>He looked it over and put it into his Thousand Jun Bracelet.</p><p>"Senior, please wait."</p><p>An urgent call came from behind, and a man in green clothes quickly caught up.</p><p>When Qin Sang was negotiating with the guard, this person was craning his neck in front of the city gate.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang stop, the man in green was overjoyed, his face full of smiles, "Senior, you're new here, you must need a guide. This junior is not talented, but I have lived here for generations and know every corner of the city like the back of my hand..."</p><p>He was only halfway through his words when he was interrupted by the two spirit stones Qin Sang threw over.</p><p>The man in green hugged the spirit stones, not understanding why.</p><p>"What are the names of the largest chambers of commerce in the market, and where are they located?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The man in green was stunned for a moment, then pointed to the top of the mountain, "Replying to Senior, the largest chambers of commerce are three, all built in the Upper District..."</p><p>The Upper District was the most important trading area in the city.</p><p>The man in green was not bragging, he knew not only the addresses of the major chambers of commerce but also all kinds of rumors like the back of his hand.</p><p>"The third one is the Wind Yang Chamber of Commerce, which is also the strongest of the three major chambers of commerce. As the name suggests, it is affiliated with Wind Shang. Each chamber of commerce in the city is not simple, with different focuses and backgrounds, plus other taboos, it's hard to explain in a short time. I don't know what Senior needs, why not hire this junior for a few more days, just..."</p><p>The man in green spoke eloquently, suddenly touched Qin Sang's indifferent gaze, and felt like he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>Until Qin Sang's figure disappeared, he woke up as if from a dream, shuddered, and hurried away with the spirit stones.</p><p>Qin Sang did not rush to the Upper District. He wandered around the city for a long time, observing the local customs and inquiring about news.</p><p>Two hours later.</p><p>Qin Sang walked towards the Upper District, his eyes playful.</p><p>"Interesting, Wind Shang is actually looking for me, inviting me to be a guest at Wind Yang Mountain. It seems that one of the two people who scared away Bi Fang that day is likely to be him!"</p><p>It wasn't that Qin Sang was deliberately inquiring.</p><p>In fact, this matter had spread too widely and was rife.</p><p>Qin Sang casually entered a few shops and heard many cultivators discussing it.</p><p>```</p>
