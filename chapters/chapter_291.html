<h1>Chapter 284: Suspicion</h1><p>Chapter 284: Suspicion</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi had white hair and beard, his age comparable to Wanderer. He looked like an immortal, ethereal Daoist priest, but his expression and tone held a hint of scorn that belied his demeanor.</p><p>Before Yu Kong could even respond, someone else interjected, “You’re no better than that old ghost Yu, old fella. Fellow Daoists, be wary. Don’t end up getting sold out by these geezers and even counting the money for them.”</p><p>It was Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly shocked. According to the information he had obtained, although Yu Kong, Sheng Yuanzi, and Luo Xingnan had left Autumnsky Market together the last time, they had never worked together again afterward. This time, they had arrived separately, acting like they were too old to even bother having anything to do with each other. Yet, their feud ran so deep that they were publicly undermining each other at a crucial moment.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi scoffed and retorted, “You, old ghost Luo, are both the most insidious. From my observations, Daoist Shaw and the others’ deaths last time couldn’t be unrelated to you!”</p><p>Luo Xingnan sneered, “You’re always the first to play thief who cries thief, old fella! And that old ghost Yu is even more like an old dog that barks without biting! If I wasn’t born cautious, I would’ve suspected you two long ago. I might’ve even been swallowed whole by you two!”</p><p>…</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi’s forehead veins bulged after the exchange. When people pointed at Yu Kong’s nose to insult him, he didn’t show much anger, his tone remaining calm, like he wasn’t the one being called an old dog.</p><p>“Before Daoist Shaw and the others died, I was the only one who had never met with Daoist Shaw. I’m also confused about just what kind of treasure would make you forsake the relationship fellow Daoists should have and ruthlessly kill!”</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed. “No matter how much you talk, Yu will no longer trust any of you. Whoever the murderer is, it has nothing to do with Yu. Yu is not young, and he only wants to focus on cultivation to form a golden core as soon as possible. May we all become strangers once again.”</p><p>Yu Kong cupped his hands and turned to speak to Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>“The Spirit Treasure Pavilion that Yu has chosen excels in defensive and trapping techniques, but its offensive power is only medium, so there won’t be any fall guys.</p><p>Of course, the treasures in this Spirit Treasure Pavilion will be inferior to those in the other, more dangerous ones. You’ll have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Fellow Daoists, don’t be swayed by their words. Focus on breaking the formation. When we’re close to the Spirit Treasure Pavilion, You’ll know the truth of Yu’s words. If any fellow Daoist decides to leave then, Yu definitely will not stop them.”</p><p>After speaking, Yu ignored Luo Xingnan and Sheng Yuanzi, forming a cloud beneath his feet and flying toward the celestial beast pack.</p><p>Sheng Yuanzi and Luo Xingnan glared, finding this dull. They each flicked their sleeves and left.</p><p>Having watched a good show for nothing, everyone had different thoughts. Some had worry in their eyes, others remained contemplative, and their thoughts were hard to discern.</p><p>Qin Sang, Wanderer, and Ge Yuan exchanged glances from afar, having gleaned a lot of information from the conversation.</p><p>It seemed that thirty years ago, these three really had had some kind of incident with Shaw Chunhui and the others, resulting in Shaw Chunhui’s death and the three old guys suspecting each other. It was just uncertain if the incident had started over the herb garden or not.</p><p>Unfortunately, the three of them were pretending very well. There was no way to tell who was genuine and who was false.</p><p>It was even possible that neither of them were guilty. The true murderer could be someone else.</p><p>If that was the case, then Qin Sang and Wanderer could only reluctantly accept reality, grab a few random items, and then return to Hanging Sky Pass.</p><p>Under the leadership of an elder, the Foundation Establishment中期 and above experts formed a formation and charged straight into the celestial beast pack.</p><p>The den instantly erupted like a hornet’s nest.</p><p>Flying in the air and running on the ground, countless strange celestial beasts rushed out with a clamor. Qin Sang and his companions didn’t dare slack off either, swiftly brandishing their own artifacts and steeling themselves.</p><p>The battle lasted eight days, and many arriving later joined the fray. An unexpected Foundation Establishment expert even made an appearance, playing a major role.</p><p>This was Qin Sang’s first time experiencing such a large-scale hunt. He collected a number of spirit monsters, which would earn him a tidy sum upon his return.</p><p>At long last, all the celestial beasts were exterminated.</p><p>The cave had shown obvious signs of change three days before. The light was growing dimmer and narrower. Now, at most, it could only shine out about ten feet, completely incomparable to its original aura.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment expert flew to the cave and did a little probing before flashing in. The formation reacted, and the light knifed at him, but it couldn’t harm him. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared.</p><p>So many people can only watch outside, whose could blame them for not being as skilled?</p><p>So they waited for another half a day, until the evening, when the low point of the guarding matrix came!</p><p>Accompanying a roar that shook heaven and earth, trails of meteor-like escape light rose into the sky, competing to fly towards the cave, illuminating it like daylight.</p><p>Qin Sang and others tightly circled around Yu Kong, and before entering the cave, they set up their Origin Return Formation, and others did the same.</p><p>“Everyone, be careful!”</p><p>The cave was close at hand, dark and lightless inside.</p><p>Yu Kong shouted and led everyone to jump into the cave.</p><p>At the moment they fell into the cave, Qin Sang’s eyes were suddenly filled with dazzling white light, and he couldn’t even see the Xiu sisters who were right in front of him. He could only rely on the presence of the Origin Return Formation to sense that the formation was not chaotic.</p><p>Then, a strange force suddenly appeared from all directions, pressing down on them. Qin Sang felt like he had fallen into a swamp, and could hardly move a step.</p><p>Yu Kong was indeed experienced and prepared. The moment the pressure appeared, he released the power that everyone had gathered on him. This power turned into a several-zhang long Qi blade, cutting a path forward.</p><p>At this time, it was impossible to see what was ahead, but everyone could only choose to trust Yu Kong, follow him along the path cut by the saber Qi, and after flying not far, they felt their bodies lighten, and the pressure and light suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Their vision finally returned, and before everyone could look around, Yu Kong’s voice transmission was heard, “We are now in the formation, take the Spirit Pills immediately!”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone took the pills in a hurry, recovering their spiritual power that had just been consumed, then looked around.</p><p>This was a boundless space, where they stood in the void, with no objects up, down, left, or right, and surrounded by hazy cyan Qi. The cyan Qi below seemed a little dim, but was brighter above.</p><p>The entire space was dead silent.</p><p>However, Yu Kong’s expression was solemn, and he said in a deep voice: “This is a wind formation. The cyan Qi may seem calm, but it is likely to be bone-蚀ding wind!”</p><p>“Why can't we see anything?”</p><p>Yue Ya Xian’s slightly wrinkled eyebrows were also a bit charming, and she asked coquettishly: “Senior Yu, what kind of formation did you encounter when you entered the Immortal Mansion last time?”</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and said: “No, last time I encountered a fire formation. As soon as I entered the formation, endless flames swept in, as if they were going to burn us to ashes. I’ve also heard that the wind formation is equally violent. I don’t know why, but it is so calm here. It seems that there are new changes.”</p>
