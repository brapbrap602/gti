<h1>Chapter Ninety-Seven: The Unexpected and the Choice</h1><p>Chapter Ninety-Seven: The Unexpected and the Choice</p><p>The night sky was bright as day!</p><p>Qin Sang crawled out of a pile of mud, brushing off the debris clinging to him, spitting out blood and decaying leaves. He turned his head, staring in disbelief towards Yuanzhao.</p><p>A blazing sun hung in the sky, illuminating every detail of Mount Yuanzhao.  The entire mountain range was bathed in daylight.  Mountains crumbled, birds and beasts scattered.</p><p>Several furious roars followed, filled with boundless rage and sorrow.  Then, a blinding light engulfed everything, the earth trembled violently, and nothing could be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang squeezed his eyes shut, his heart pounding with fear. He didn't know what had happened, but he could sense terrifyingly powerful fluctuations emanating from that golden sun.</p><p>As the light gradually faded and his vision returned, Qin Sang discovered that the towering Mount Yuanzhao had been cleaved in two, and even the surrounding mountains had been drastically shortened.</p><p>*This* was the destructive power of a Core Formation cultivator. A mixture of fear and yearning stirred within Qin Sang.</p><p>His expression shifted slightly. He had originally planned to find a place to observe the battle.</p><p>He hadn't been opposed to the demonic path before, nor did he have a strong sense of the conflict between righteous and demonic cultivators.  He didn't harbor any deep-seated hatred, especially after hearing the revelations about the Ascension Ceremony from the young man in the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Land. Qin Sang understood that the righteous path wasn't necessarily pure.</p><p>His motivation was purely self-preservation, a desire to live longer.  That was why he was determined to leave the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>Still, there *was* a difference between the righteous and demonic paths.</p><p>Yuanzhao had at least used the Ascension Ceremony to lure rogue cultivators into the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Land, concealing their true purpose. They hadn't sent their own disciples to die.</p><p>If it were the Kuiyin Sect, even if it meant sacrificing the lives of all their disciples, Sect Leader Yi probably wouldn't hesitate. Just think of the souls lost in the Yin Sha Abyss, countless times more than those in the Eight Trigrams Forbidden Land.</p><p>There was a saying about sparing no cost.  In the cultivation world, low-level Qi Refinement cultivators without backing were often the 'cost' when things went wrong. This was even more likely in the demonic sects.</p><p>One needed to be either like Liang Yan, close to someone like Yue Wu, safe from harm, or like Yue Wu himself, a Foundation Establishment cultivator and a powerful asset to the sect, to have a chance at survival.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was just a disposable pawn.</p><p>But as they say, times change.</p><p>After obtaining the mysterious orchid, Qin Sang began to waver. If the Kuiyin Sect were to emerge victorious, no matter how valuable the orchid was, he wouldn't dare to run off with a spiritual herb coveted by a Core Formation cultivator, even if he had ten thousand lives.</p><p>He could flee for his life all day, but a Core Formation cultivator could catch up in an instant, their divine sense sweeping across the land, leaving him nowhere to hide.</p><p>With Zhao Yan dead and no witnesses, if he presented the mysterious orchid to the Sect Leader, establishing such a remarkable achievement, Sect Leader Yi would surely reward him handsomely. A few Foundation Establishment Pills shouldn't be difficult to obtain, or at least a life-saving talisman.</p><p>As long as there was a chance to break through to Foundation Establishment, staying on the demonic path wouldn't be so bad.</p><p>However, Yuanzhao didn't seem entirely defenseless. After the explosion of the blazing sun, an eerie silence had fallen over the sect.</p><p>Demonic flames, formations, ghostly shadows, cultivators...</p><p>All had vanished!</p><p>A deathly silence hung in the night sky!</p><p>Suddenly, a heart-wrenching cry echoed from the distant horizon: "Senior Brother!"</p><p>A crimson streak of light, like a meteor, shot across the sky, arriving above Yuanzhao in the blink of an eye. A young man in black robes appeared.</p><p>The young man looked at the ravaged Yuanzhao in disbelief, his face filled with grief.</p><p>Just then, a tremendous boom reverberated.</p><p>The remaining half of Mount Yuanzhao collapsed.  From amidst the dust and smoke, a dozen battered figures emerged.  Upon seeing the young man hovering in the air, they cried out in joy: "Martial Uncle! You've finally arrived!"</p><p>Only Yu Hua seemed stunned, his eyes vacant.</p><p>But as they met the young man's icy gaze and took in the devastation of their sect, a chilling realization washed over them.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A fissure suddenly split open in the sky, and a wisp of black qi drifted out...</p><p>The young man abruptly looked up, his eyes locking onto the depths of the fissure.  An insane hatred surged within them.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>…</p><p>A fiery-red divine sword, radiating an awe-inspiring aura, chased a thin wisp of black qi desperately fleeing northwards, not daring to pause for even a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang watched this scene with trepidation. Could this newcomer be Yuanzhao's reinforcement? Had Yuanzhao, besieged and their formations breached, somehow turned the tables in this desperate situation?</p><p>This was completely unexpected.</p><p>The divine sword and the black qi, one pursuing and the other fleeing, vanished into the horizon.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered indecisively, but he quickly made up his mind.  He tossed aside the Four Clouds Divine Restriction, clutched the jade box, hesitated for a long moment, and finally succumbed to his greed.</p><p>A self-deprecating smile touched Qin Sang's lips as he swiftly rummaged through Zhao Yan's storage pouch, taking out anything useful and leaving behind the rest.</p><p>To his delight, he found a familiar pearl.  The terrifying power of the pearl was still fresh in his memory. Even against a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the pearl could cause significant disruption, if not outright kill them.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the pearl, channeling all his energy into the Ethereal Wind technique.  His mind held only one thought—escape, and escape as far as possible.</p><p>Suppressing his injuries with medicinal pills, Qin Sang fled, heading west. After a few days, he found a cave, discarded Zhao Yan's storage pouch, and turned south.</p><p>Whenever his spiritual energy depleted, he would find a cave to recover and then continue his flight, sustaining himself on wild fruits and spring water, avoiding any contact with people.</p><p>He set his sights on the southwest.</p><p>Confined to Returning Sun Valley while at the Yuanzhao Sect, Qin Sang never had the chance to acquire a map of the cultivation world. His knowledge of it came primarily from Yue Wu's lectures at the Kuiyin Sect and conversations with fellow disciples. However, being only at the Qi Refinement stage, their knowledge was limited.</p><p>Their location was in the northwest corner of the continent, a region known in the cultivation world as the Small Cold Domain. Legend had it that the continent was vast, bordered by a boundless sea. But how far east and south it extended, and what great sects lay beyond, only Nascent Soul cultivators might know.</p><p>Even the western and northern borders of the Small Cold Domain, closest to them, were rarely reached.  The far west was the territory of the妖族 (demon race), while the north was the ancient battlefield of immortals!</p><p>The ancient battlefield was said to be incredibly dangerous, yet filled with opportunities for defying fate, containing countless ancient immortal caves and remains.</p><p>Yue Wu was tight-lipped about the ancient battlefield, while his fellow Qi Refinement disciples knew little, relying on hearsay and rumors.</p><p>Three main powers controlled the Small Cold Domain. The west was occupied by the demon race, the northeast by the demonic sects. Qin Sang was now fleeing towards the territory of the righteous sects.</p><p>The Kuiyin Sect and the Yuanzhao Sect were situated in the buffer zone between the righteous and demonic sects of the Small Cold Domain.  Both had once flourished under the protection of Nascent Soul ancestors. Though declining now, they still held considerable influence in the region.</p>
