<h1>Chapter 1459: A Crescent Moon, Myriad Stars (6k, 3-in-1, Make-up Chapter!)</h1><p>琉璃's glassy eyes flickered as she looked at the ice casket in Qin Sang's hand, calmly saying, "First, before you return the sacred artifact, I'd like to borrow it for a day to extract the power of the ice demon crystal."</p><p>It seems there's a second request.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated琉璃's first request and didn't ask what she intended to use the ice demon crystal's power for.  Slightly surprised, he asked, "Won't that affect the seal, or damage the ice demon crystal?"</p><p>"It won't."</p><p>琉璃's tone remained unwavering. "My master taught me this type of sealing technique. The Ice Soul Divine Light can penetrate the seal and extract the power of the ice demon crystal. It won't cause damage, only a weakening of the crystal's power. It will need to be nurtured in the Frozen Spring for over ten years, delaying the opening of the Sacred Land."</p><p>The environment within the Sacred Land is conducive to the cultivation of Xuan Tian Palace disciples.</p><p>Many in Xuan Tian Palace are stuck at cultivation bottlenecks, eagerly awaiting the Sacred Land's opening. Even a year's delay is incredibly difficult and unbearable for them.</p><p>Shi Xue is the leader of the Listening Snow Pavilion lineage.</p><p>As the junior master, her status isn't low.</p><p>But Xuan Tian Palace has complex factions. The Listening Snow Pavilion is only one of the four main lineages of Xuan Tian Palace, and currently the weakest. Beyond the four lineages are prominent families and various functional halls, overseen by elders and the Palace Master.</p><p>With so many eyes watching, under normal circumstances, she, considered unremarkable, couldn't possibly be authorized to use the sacred artifact. This is her only chance.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "You must extract the ice demon crystal's power in front of me."</p><p>This is to prevent the sacred artifact from being stolen, and he also wants to take this opportunity to observe the ice demon crystal.</p><p>As for the weakening of the ice demon crystal caused by琉璃's actions, it's not a big deal; it can be blamed on that traitor.</p><p>A ten-year delay in the opening of the Sacred Land is exactly what Qin Sang wants.</p><p>After this matter is settled, he plans to visit Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>If all goes well, in ten years, he should be able to complete the Ascension Ritual for the Sky Eye Butterfly. If successful, the Sky Eye Butterfly will advance to the mid-fourth transformation stage, greatly increasing its abilities.</p><p>Furthermore, the Sun God Bird might also be formed by then, adding another powerful magic treasure to his arsenal.</p><p>Before entering the Sacred Land, he needs to prepare thoroughly and anticipate any possible changes.</p><p>琉璃 hesitated slightly, "Good."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, accepting the request. "What's your second condition?"</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt琉璃's gaze change, becoming more serious and solemn.</p><p>She looked directly at Qin Sang, her tone heavy. "After you break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, I hope you will go with me to Zi Wei Palace to help rescue my master.  I will provide appropriate compensation."</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>There were too many questions in this statement, he didn't know where to begin.</p><p>After speaking, a glimmer of hope flashed in琉璃's eyes. For her, rescuing her master was even more important than obtaining the ice demon crystal.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his five-element spiritual roots, achieved such accomplishments before the age of four hundred, a feat that can be described as astonishing.  Even the self-proclaimed geniuses of Xuan Tian Palace are not as dazzling as him.</p><p>In琉璃's view, Qin Sang is the most promising cultivator in this era to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, perhaps the only one.</p><p>After a moment's daze, Qin Sang looked at琉璃, his eyes somewhat strange. "After I left Zi Wei Palace that time, were you still threatened by Dongyang Bo and unable to rescue your master?"</p><p>琉璃 shook her head, then nodded.</p><p>"After you escaped, he lost his leverage and couldn't threaten me. I agreed to participate in the Three Realms War, fighting for Shao Hua Mountain, and promised to ask my master to teach him a tribulation-crossing secret technique. Then we entered the Demon Cave together and sensed my master's presence, but we lacked the strength to rescue her."</p><p>Recalling that scene,琉璃's expression became somewhat gloomy.</p><p>Her master was so close, yet they were powerless, only hating their own low cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang felt琉璃's emotions, and remembering the past, how proud she was, yet willingly cultivated the forbidden "Yin-Yang Cultivation" technique to save her master, enduring countless hardships, only to fail in the end.</p><p>And now...</p><p>Thinking of the now ascended Zi Wei Palace, his gaze meeting琉璃's firm eyes, Qin Sang fell silent, only able to sigh at the cruelty of the world.</p><p>Shaking off her despondency,琉璃 showed a hopeful expression. "Fortunately, my master is still in good condition. She sent a message, ordering me to return to Xuan Tian Palace and cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light. Only after mastering the Ice Soul Divine Light can I invite a powerful cultivator to help open the ancient restrictions in the Demon Cave."</p><p>Hearing "Ice Soul Divine Light," Qin Sang remembered it was the strange ability she used against him before.  Truly a peerless divine ability.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, then asked, "Why didn't you ask the Palace Master of Xuan Tian Palace for help?  And the Grand Elder, surely she would have a better chance of breaking through to the late Yuan Ying stage than I do."</p><p>Liuli's eyes flickered. "The Palace Master... is unable to act. The Grand Elder was injured during the Great Upheaval.  The injury damaged her foundation, and nearly triggered a demonic possession.  The problem remains unresolved, and so..."</p><p>The Palace Master's condition is worse than I imagined!</p><p>No wonder Liuli didn't ask the Palace Master for help and hasn't returned to Bei Chen.</p><p>The Grand Elder must have been injured by Gui Mu.  The Ghost Mother, after recovering her strength, is incredibly powerful; even the Grand Elder, wielding a spiritual treasure, was no match for her.</p><p>How strong must Senior Tianyue have been to force the Ghost Mother, at her peak, into a desperate situation and seal her away until now?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, then he said, "I remember Dong Yangbo mentioned obtaining a certain treasure in the Bronze Hall."</p><p>Liuli answered truthfully, "Possibly because Master entered the Demon Cave, causing changes to the Bronze Hall's restrictions. We ultimately didn't find it."</p><p>A gleam flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>He had long suspected that the Murder Sword's spirit had possessed him in the Bronze Hall.  Hearing Liuli's words, he felt more certain.</p><p>Perhaps Liuli's Master's entry into the Demon Cave caused the spirit to unexpectedly break free from its seal, wandering in the Bronze Hall until it found him, a cultivator of the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*, and possessed him.</p><p>Of course, these are just speculations.</p><p>The spirit's origins and reasons for being sealed remain a mystery.</p><p>"Dong Yangbo..."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, "His breakthrough to the mid-Yuan Ying stage, and his success in the last heavenly tribulation, were due to your Master's help? Did he not seek you out at Xuan Tian Palace afterwards?"</p><p>Dong Yangbo's whereabouts are unknown.</p><p>If Dong Yangbo had visited her, even if constrained by his oath, he could have revealed the disappearance of Zi Wei Palace, ending her hopes.</p><p>It seems that although they made another deal, a deep rift remains, and Dong Yangbo didn't want to invite trouble.</p><p>"Master taught him an extremely costly breakthrough technique.  Coincidentally, the Three Realms War broke out, and Dong Yangbo exhausted himself gathering all the necessary conditions.  After forcibly breaking through, his vital energy will rapidly decay. Even with his methods to strengthen his foundation, he would undoubtedly die before the next heavenly tribulation. He only has a few decades left."</p><p>As she spoke, Liuli glanced at Qin Sang.</p><p>Suspecting that Dong Yangbo had already died at Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Dong Yangbo is no match for Qin Sang now, and the conflict between them is irreconcilable; after all, Qin Sang was deeply plotted against and nearly perished.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang recalled his senior sister's assessment of Dong Yangbo, and immediately understood.</p><p>No wonder Dong Yangbo had always chosen to retreat; he had only a few years to live.</p><p>His departure from Bei Chen suggests a faint hope of recovery, traveling widely, or perhaps assisting Qiu Mu Bai in finding the opportunity to form a Nascent Soul.</p><p>"Dong Yangbo should be in the North Sea now.  I wonder why he didn't visit you. How did you recognize me during our earlier encounter?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously. He had worn a mask and taken great precautions to disguise himself. He thought Dong Yangbo had told Liuli about him, that she already knew about his pair of phoenix wings and his mastery of lightning escape techniques.</p><p>Liuli remained silent for a moment, then softly said, "Sword intent."</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>The sword intent of the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* is unique, unparalleled in the world.</p><p>Since Liuli had sought him out later, she must have known he practiced this technique. He hadn't expected Liuli to recognize the sword intent and connect it to him so quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looked at Liuli, hesitated, and stammered, "There's something you may not know.  In just two hundred years, Zi Wei Palace has opened twice more, each time with a shorter interval."</p><p>He paused slightly.</p><p>Liuli seemed to sense something, her lips pressed together, her eyes fixed unblinkingly on Qin Sang.</p><p>Stared at by Liuli, Qin Sang felt immense pressure. He sighed inwardly, "The last time, Zi Wei Palace... for some unknown reason, its inner hall returned to its celestial form and ascended, leaving this world. This includes Mount Tian, the Bronze Hall, everything... Even if your Master survived that event, she's no longer in this world."</p><p>He gave a wry smile.  "You must swear an oath not to reveal this, or Bei Chen will never know peace."</p><p>He himself didn't fear the backlash of a demonic heart-demon.</p><p>After Qin Sang finished speaking, there was no response.</p><p>Dead silence.</p><p>Liuli's lips were bloodless, her face pale.</p><p>At that moment, her eyes seemed to lose all their light, staring blankly northward.</p><p>There were no tears, but Qin Sang felt a profound sadness.</p><p>He didn't know much about Liuli, but he deeply felt the bond between her and her master, as if rescuing her master was her only obsession in life.</p><p>Alas…</p><p>Heaven is merciless, always has been.</p><p>Liuli remained motionless, like an ice sculpture.</p><p>Qin Sang, worried that his words had driven her into a frenzy, cleared his throat and said, “Your master's cultivation is profound.  Trapped in the Demon Cave, she's protected by ancient seals – the Demon Cave seal, the Bronze Hall seal, the Black Tower seal, and the numerous Celestial seals on the Heavenly Mountain. These were originally restrictions, but at that time, they served as four layers of protection.  Your master might be unharmed, perhaps even benefitting from the ordeal, escaping her confinement and witnessing even more beautiful scenery and a broader path in the Upper Realm! This is a heaven-sent opportunity. Compared to her, we are all imprisoned, our paths cut off, our futures uncertain, unsure when we might break free…”</p><p>Though words of comfort, they also reflected some of Qin Sang's true thoughts.</p><p>After all, Purple Micro Palace hadn't completely shattered during the ascension.  A large portion of the Celestial Palace remained, perhaps with some special places where one could escape the impact and sneak through.</p><p>Unfortunately, the palace's ascension was too sudden, and everyone's attention was on the Jade Bone Demon and the Ascension Platform, leaving no time for investigation.</p><p>Liuli's stiff eyes finally moved, suddenly regaining some luster.</p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p>Her voice was raspy, yet held a glimmer of hope.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "You can ask for something else."</p><p>Liuli looked up at the sky, seemingly speaking to herself, yet also confiding, her voice somewhat ethereal, "I was once helpless, my master took me in, like a teacher and a mother. I remember clearly, that night, a crescent moon, countless stars…"</p><p>Qin Sang listened quietly, saying nothing.</p><p>He looked up at the horizon.</p><p>Stars glimmered, the moon shone brightly.</p><p>"Ah,"</p><p>Liuli sighed, regaining her composure, "Besides attending the ceremony at the Sacred Grounds, and the  'Nine Nether Yin Jade Scripture', what else do you require?"</p><p>"Let me think…  Ideally, access to the Xuan Tian Palace treasury, to choose whatever I want."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. Seeing that Liuli wasn't going to add any more conditions, he decisively handed over the ice box, "Let the exchange begin, Fairy! I'm essentially using your resources to obtain the Ice Soul Divine Energy, I'm already gaining a great advantage."</p><p>"You deserve it."</p><p>Liuli replied.</p><p>She didn't refuse, taking the ice box and glancing at it.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>Qin Sang led Liuli to the center of the island, where he'd prepared a cave dwelling. After setting up protective formations, they sat facing each other.</p><p>Liuli sat cross-legged, placing the ice box in front of her.</p><p>Then, she took something from her pouch and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang took it, feeling an icy chill travel from his fingertips to his very core, almost freezing his meridians. Looking down, he saw a white pouch like a small bag, woven from strands of transparent ice silk, heavy with its contents.</p><p>Liuli explained, "This is an Ice Soul pouch, made by Master years ago using Ice Soul Divine Light and ice silk. It's for storing Ice Soul energy.  Master didn't leave much, this is half, enough for your external avatar's foundation establishment."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, accepting it without hesitation, then quietly observed Liuli's actions.</p><p>The cave was silent.</p><p>Liuli closed her eyes, her breathing becoming steady, until only a faint trace remained. Her palms opened, hovering above the ice box.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, daylight broke outside. Liuli looked tired, seemingly having expended considerable energy.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt a chill.</p><p>He lowered his head, staring at Liuli's fingertips.</p><p>The space there was calm, yet he sensed that she had activated her Ice Soul Divine Light ability, detecting a subtle fluctuation.</p><p>"What a unique ability! It seems her skill isn't fully developed. Once perfected, I doubt I could detect it before being affected, quite sharp.  She hasn't broken through to mid-Yuan Ying stage for so long, perhaps she's devoted most of her energy to cultivating this Ice Soul Divine Light?"</p><p>Qin Sang speculated.</p><p>Then, he noticed the seal on the mysterious ice box loosening.  With Liuli's movements, a transparent, watery energy seeped out from the cracks.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at the sight.</p><p>If that traitor had Liuli's skill, he would have obtained the sacred artifact long ago and wouldn't have met such a tragic end.</p><p>Finally, the energy coalesced into a single droplet.</p><p>Liuli caught it, carefully sensing it before remaining motionless, lost in thought.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something amiss and quietly asked, "This... isn't suitable?"</p><p>Liuli nodded, her tone even.  "It's not compatible."</p><p>Qin Sang scratched his head. He didn't understand what Liuli was trying to do and couldn't offer any good suggestions.  However, he could tell she was searching for a treasure related to ice-type cultivation, most likely for a specific technique.</p><p>"Let me see it."</p><p>Qin Sang reached out.</p><p>Liuli didn't hesitate and handed the droplet to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it thoroughly but found nothing conclusive. He knew little about ice-type cultivation but understood that even similar spiritual objects differed greatly in essence, and the requirements were even stricter at the Yuan Ying stage, leaving no room for error.</p><p>For example, when refining his Golden Sink Sword, if he had insisted on extreme compatibility like others, only the Falling Phoenix Jade among his three spiritual objects would have been barely suitable; the Blue Dot Gold and the Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid wouldn't have worked.</p><p>A slight difference could lead to a huge mistake. This is why top-tier magic weapons are so difficult to refine.</p><p>Qin Sang returned the droplet, now largely convinced of Liuli's words.  Liuli hadn't previously known about the Ziwei Palace ascension and had asked for his help to save her master; she wouldn't lie or antagonize him on such a matter.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang asked, "Are the rumors about the Huanglongshi Palace a diversion orchestrated by the Xuan Tian Palace and the Hunmo Elder, secretly hastening the Wanmo Conference?"</p><p>Liuli hadn't known before.  Later, Shi Xue learned about it from an elder, and they understood. At this point, the truth or falsehood of the matter was irrelevant. Liuli nodded in agreement.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt more confident, stating firmly, "They didn't expect the sacred object to be in my possession. Their true goal is to lure the traitor into the open."</p><p>Liuli nodded again, her eyes flickering, seemingly grasping something.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke calmly.</p><p>"That guy isn't stupid. Knowing the Xuan Tian Palace can sense the sacred object, he wouldn't be as naive as I was, openly bringing it to the conference.</p><p>"The Xuan Tian Palace must have another way to pinpoint him!</p><p>"Your inability to act on Hunmo Island suggests your connection with the Hunmo Elder isn't deep, and the forces behind the Wanmo Conference wouldn't allow a large-scale search, breaking the rules.</p><p>"Therefore, the best approach is to let him reveal himself."</p><p>Qin Sang simply made a reasonable deduction based on the information he'd gathered, putting himself in their shoes.</p><p>He lifted his eyes, "Your Grand Elder likely prepared an extremely rare treasure, one that would tempt the traitor to risk exposure to obtain it."</p><p>Liuli stopped nodding and looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>This treasure might be exactly what she needed.</p><p>But given her position in the Xuan Tian Palace, obtaining it wouldn't be easy. Unless...</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "After meeting the Grand Elder, I'll tell her that the fairy, risking her life, persuaded me with reason and emotion, softening my anger and suspicion, leading me to agree to return the sacred object. The fairy deserves one-third of the credit for the sacred object's return.  How you explain it to the Grand Elder is your business."</p><p>Liuli looked intently at Qin Sang and said, "Thank you."</p><p>"You've said 'thank you' twice.  Can't you use a different word?"</p><p>Qin Sang made a lighthearted comment, then became serious, "It was a small favor. If you hadn't mediated, things wouldn't have been so smooth between me and the Xuan Tian Palace. There would have been more conflict, accumulating resentment. I might even have been ambushed by the Grand Elder with magic treasures. That truly is your merit!  Besides, we each got what we needed. Don't worry about it."</p><p>Throughout, both he and Liuli tacitly avoided mentioning the 'cultivation' matter. Liuli didn't bring it up, and he felt it inappropriate to do so.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to ask if she practiced the *Shiqiao Chan*, but seeing her serious demeanor, she didn't seem to have engaged in that unorthodox practice, so he didn't ask.</p><p>He remembered Dongyang Bo's warning about the dire consequences of the *Xuanpin Jade Cauldron True Scripture*. He himself, thanks to the Jade Buddha's protection, had luckily escaped this calamity, leaving the latent danger to fall upon Liuli.</p><p>Since meeting Liuli, Qin Sang had been silently observing her, not sensing any emotional ripples caused by him, making him doubt whether Dongyang Bo had been exaggerating.</p><p>Liuli remained silent for a long time, finally saying, "Thank you."</p><p>Qin Sang looked helpless.</p><p>Before parting, Qin Sang gave Liuli a communication talisman, instructing her, "If your Grand Elder agrees, crush this talisman near Mingzhu Island. I will communicate the meeting place to her, and we will discuss it in detail.  Tell the Grand Elder not to bring too many experts. I'm a coward."</p><p>Liuli's gaze quickly swept over Qin Sang's face, as if saying, "You a coward?"</p><p>Without saying anything more, she silently put away the communication talisman and flew off.</p><p>Qin Sang watched her from the shore.  After Liuli's light disappeared, he fell into deep thought, sighed softly, and turned to go home.</p><p>He first dismantled the formation, then went to pay his respects to Master Yinquan. Through him, he met several fellow cultivators. After a day, he took his leave and returned to Mingzhu Island with Master Yinquan.</p><p>Qin Sang was now considered a valued guest.  His request to rent the Dan Ding Hui's fire chamber angered Master Yinquan, so he reluctantly used it for free.</p><p>He knew that the other party valued him partly because of the ancient formulas.  Also, Dan Ding Mountain might already suspect his origins.</p><p>Regardless of whether Qin Sang knew the path to Bei Chen Realm or not, he wouldn't reveal it.</p><p>Through his travels, Qin Sang had come to deeply understand the strength of the Northern Sea cultivation world, far surpassing Bei Chen Realm. Fortunately, the human and demon races of the Northern Sea were at odds, and the human race was fragmented and mutually restrained.</p><p>Bei Chen Realm was still recovering from the great upheaval, its strong cultivators having ascended, leaving it weak.</p><p>Restoring contact between the two realms at this time would bring more harm than good to Bei Chen Realm's sects; it wasn't wise, best to wait for a great cultivator to emerge.</p><p>Therefore, he pretended to be oblivious, giving no indication of his thoughts.</p><p>After thanking Master Yinquan, Qin Sang entered the fire chamber, took out the Jinchen Sword, Luofeng Jade, and the other spirit items, preparing to upgrade them to top-grade magic treasures before meeting the Grand Elder.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he could completely use his own Infant Fire and Nine Netherworld Demon Fire for refining.</p><p>However, doing so would be too costly.</p><p>Refining magic treasures couldn't be done in one go.  For most of the process, such strong spirit fire wasn't necessary; the underground fire veins were sufficient, allowing him to work more easily.  Why not?</p><p>He added several more layers of restrictions outside the fire chamber.</p><p>Then, with a single hand gesture, he drew in the Luofeng Jade, his Infant Fire flickering in his palm.</p><p>The Luofeng Jade slowly rotated in his palm.  When it showed signs of melting, Qin Sang stopped, gently shaking his hand before putting it into the furnace to be burned by the earth fire.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the Luofeng Jade melted into a pool of spirit liquid, its impurities removed.</p><p>Qin Sang placed it above the furnace, maintaining this state, and then successively drew in the other two spirit items, refining them in the same way.</p><p>He didn't rush to re-refine the spirit sword. First, he grasped the sword, using his spiritual sense to understand the characteristics of the materials and the sword itself.  Once certain of success, he summoned the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and threw the Jinchen Sword into it.</p>
