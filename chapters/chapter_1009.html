<h1>Chapter 1001 Transformation</h1><p>Chapter 1001 Transformation</p><p>“Stabilizing my life force is only temporary.  Even if I don't want to remove the Corpse Seal, when I attempt the Corpse King realm, I'll need your help to succeed.” Bai said helplessly.</p><p>He’d tried many methods to no avail; the Corpse Seal was proving intractable.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>Bai’s willingness to follow him was a good thing; if Bai’s Corpse Seal could be removed, there was hope of saving Ya Gu as well.</p><p>“The Seven Killing Hall and the Purple Micro Palace are connected by an ancient teleportation array.  They were probably one entity in the past. The current world is so chaotic; it’s difficult to correlate it with the ancient cultivation world.  Perhaps traveling is a good idea. Before that, though, I want to explore the Cang Lang Sea for a while – ten years should be enough…”</p><p>Bai pondered for a moment.  “In that case, I won't rush my breakthrough for now. After temporarily stabilizing my life force, I can find a way to conceal the corpse aura on my body.  As long as I avoid major cultivator cities, I shouldn't be easily exposed. You must have your own matters to attend to, so let's act separately and set a time to meet again.”</p><p>Bai’s suggestion was excellent.</p><p>Qin Sang considered it and nodded.  “I’ve made an appointment with Ning Wu Hui to return to Heavenly Dao Sect ten years from now, before the Seven Killing Hall’s reappearance, to discuss entering the Hall.  Perhaps you could return then too?”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>The two returned to their cave dwelling and stayed for a few days. Qin Sang prepared some protective treasures for Bai.</p><p>In truth, even without the Ghost Mist enhancement, Bai's strength was rarely matched among those at the Golden Core stage. However, since he had to focus on stabilizing his life force, he would be hesitant when encountering cultivators of the same level and would avoid fighting unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang renewed the lease on their cave dwelling for ten years, arranging for Bai and Ning Wu Hui to meet there. Afterward, he left the market town.</p><p>“Take care, Daoist friend. Until we meet again!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai parted ways.</p><p>He would travel south to keep his appointment with Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Bai's choice was peculiar; he seemed interested in the North Sea Rain Desert and decided to explore it first.</p><p>“Until we meet again!”</p><p>Bai, wearing a large cloak to conceal himself, flew north towards the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Bai leave, waved his hand, summoned a flying vehicle, called out his Jiao soul to pull it, and headed in the opposite direction.</p><p>…</p><p>Storm Belt.</p><p>After a long journey, Qin Sang arrived near Yuan Zhu’s cave dwelling and activated the scale-based restriction.</p><p>Soon, a white light illuminated the seabed.</p><p>After a moment of shimmering, a column of light erupted before Qin Sang, carrying Yuan Zhu’s hearty laughter. “Friend Mingyue has finally arrived! Please, come in!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure flickered, and he entered the light column, disappearing into the secluded realm.</p><p>Yuan Zhu stood before his cave dwelling, smiling.</p><p>“Daoist Yuan looks well.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a stir in his heart and spoke.</p><p>He noticed a clear change in Yuan Zhu’s aura compared to ten years ago.  However, his understanding of the Yao race was limited, making it hard to determine whether the change was positive or negative, or its cause.</p><p>Yuan Zhu gestured inward. “That's thanks to you, Friend Mingyue.  It’s a long story. I’ve prepared a pot of spirit wine; please, come in…”</p><p>They settled into the cave dwelling.</p><p>Yuan Zhu produced two amber cups and a long-necked jade pot.</p><p>The liquid inside was a striking green, seemingly brimming with boundless vitality, making the entire jade pot look like a flawless jadeite—exquisitely beautiful.</p><p>Yuan Zhu tilted the pot, pouring the liquor into the cups.</p><p>A peculiar fragrance filled the cave dwelling.</p><p>“Fine wine!”</p><p>Qin Sang was moved.</p><p>This was no ordinary spirit wine. It was like a spirit pill, radiating intensely abundant spiritual energy.</p><p>“This wine is brewed by the monkey tribe in the Demon Sea using various rare spirit fruits. Drinking it enhances cultivation and is even better than the spirit pills your human race refines. It’s highly prized in the Demon Sea. Because the required fruits are extremely rare, the wine’s production is extremely low, with the monkey tribe only releasing a few pots occasionally. I was lucky enough to obtain one by chance. Sadly, I probably won’t have the chance to drink it again…”</p><p>Yuan Zhu’s smile faded as he recalled his displacement, sighing softly.</p><p>“Please, Daoist friend.”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Qin Sang took a cup, swirling it gently. The fragrance intensified.</p><p>He drank the spirit wine in one gulp.</p><p>It was initially sweet.</p><p>However, a burning sensation suddenly surged through him as the alcohol flowed down his throat, like a fiery line entering his stomach. The potency transformed into extremely pure spiritual energy, causing Qin Sang's expression to change slightly.  He focused on his cultivation techniques, slowly refining the alcohol's power.</p><p>“Excellent wine!”</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, closed his eyes to savor the experience, and couldn’t help but praise it again.</p><p>After only one sip of the spirit wine, his true essence had inexplicably increased.</p><p>"My friend, you've given such a great gift without reason. I'm truly humbled!"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes and looked at Yuan Zhu. "Friend Yuan, please speak frankly! I haven't forgotten our agreement from ten years ago. If you need my help, I will do my best."</p><p>Yuan Zhu chuckled, clapping his hands. "Why would it be without reason?  You don't know how much you've helped me. As for the agreement from ten years ago, let's not worry about it."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "Friend Yuan, what do you mean?"</p><p>"My friend, before questioning the Nine-Phoenix King, I had a premonition and searched for a way to break this secret technique.</p><p>"Later, I unexpectedly found an ancient sealed area in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>"This place isn't particularly hidden, but it's very unique. It's likely left behind by an ancient demon ancestor. Even if you humans found it, you wouldn't be able to discover its secrets.</p><p>"This sealed area is very mysterious and dangerous.</p><p>"Before, I felt desperate. I planned to invite you to join me at the right time, work together to break the seal, and investigate.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, I saw hope in the ‘Celestial Demon Transformation’ technique. There's no need to enter the sealed area, and you don't need to risk your life with me."</p><p>Yuan Zhu explained the reason calmly.</p><p>"My friend, cultivating the ‘Celestial Demon Transformation’ can unlock the secret technique on you and restore your true form?"</p><p>Qin Sang showed a surprised expression and asked.</p><p>Yuan Zhu's lips curved into a slight smile, and his tone was light. "While I can't be entirely certain, it's very promising.  Perhaps, after breaking the secret technique by cultivating this method, I might even have a chance to transform, a blessing in disguise! The ‘Celestial Demon Transformation’ has an extraordinary origin; I underestimated it before. In ancient times, this technique was absolutely a top-tier sect's secret art. I easily solved my biggest problem, how can I not thank you properly?"</p><p>Qin Sang was incredibly surprised to hear this. He never expected this outcome.</p><p>It was the best possible news that Yuan Zhu could resolve the danger.</p><p>Qin Sang considered himself a strong cultivator, but Yuan Zhu was also a top expert.  Even he considered the sealed area extremely dangerous, so one could imagine how perilous it was.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't take unnecessary risks.</p><p>He didn't ask further about the sealed area, smiling faintly. "Friend Yuan, you're exaggerating. I also relied on your Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn to escape my enemy! Now that you're safe, I'm relieved. I wish you a speedy recovery and freedom from your troubles."</p>
