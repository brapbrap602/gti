<h1>Chapter 753: The Third Transformation</h1><p>Chapter 753: The Third Transformation</p><p>A halo drifted onto Qin Sang, flickering before transforming into a gorgeous, form-fitting suit of seven-colored armor.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm had successfully completed its third transformation.</p><p>However, its form remained unchanged – round, plump, and covered in seven-colored skin.</p><p>Spirit insects usually undergo some degree of external change with each transformation. For example, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, after its third transformation, opens the eyes on its wings, granting it supernatural abilities.</p><p>This Fat Silkworm, however, was peculiar. It had devoured countless poison and demon pills, seemingly to no effect.</p><p>After its second transformation, the spirit insect could exhale a seven-colored halo that repelled poison, leading Qin Sang to have high expectations. But after its third transformation, it didn't seem to gain any new abilities.</p><p>Only the seven-colored halo had become denser, able to form threads that coalesced into actual poison-repelling armor, fulfilling Qin Sang's dream.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's innate ability isn't exceptionally strong, but it can manipulate lightning, making it a considerable fighter and a valuable asset after its transformation.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm, however, remained fat and vulnerable.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm slept for a long time, and its transformation hasn't been completed long. Qin Sang doesn't know if the silkworm's abilities are too subtle for him to detect, or if there's another reason.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's not his spirit insect but has sworn allegiance to Ya Gu, preventing direct communication.  Even if it were clever, many meanings couldn't be accurately conveyed.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the Fat Silkworm's transformation wasn't fruitless; it was even a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang distinctly felt a clearer connection with Ya Gu. If the bond were previously likened to a spider's silk, it was now thick as a rope.</p><p>Ya Gu remained asleep, but her spirit body was far more stable.</p><p>After the transformation, the Fat Silkworm sometimes likes to sleep in his hand, showing an inherent intimacy and dependence without a hint of artifice, giving Qin Sang the illusion of being with Ya Gu herself.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't know how long this state will last, but the Fat Silkworm buying him time to solve the Heavenly Corpse Talisman problem is already a huge boon.</p><p>The difficulty of a spirit insect's third and fourth transformations is vastly different, comparable to a cultivator forming their Golden Core and Nascent Soul.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's transformation isn't as easy as the Fat Silkworm's. After its third transformation consuming the Red Fire Gilded Pill, there's likely little left for its fourth transformation, its effectiveness then being uncertain.</p><p>What worries Qin Sang more is that after the Fat Silkworm's third transformation, poison beast demon pills, like the poison pills before, have become surprisingly ineffective.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained a mid-Golden Core stage venomous fish demon pill at an auction, yet the result was the same.</p><p>He wonders if the demon pill's grade is too low, or if the Fat Silkworm's taste has changed.</p><p>Late-stage demon pills can still be hunted, but Qin Sang dares not even dream of obtaining a Transformation stage demon pill.</p><p>In short, raising the Fat Silkworm will remain troublesome, let alone helping it achieve its fourth transformation. He can't put all his hopes on it.</p><p>Of course, the Fat Silkworm's transformation has undoubtedly brought improvements.</p><p>Before the transformation, the poison-repelling armor probably couldn't withstand the poison mist's erosion. Now, with his true energy withdrawn, the poison mist is easily blocked by the armor; Qin Sang's skin feels no stinging sensation.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm scurries into his sleeve with ease.</p><p>With the poison-repelling armor protecting him, Qin Sang withdrew his protective true energy, feeling much lighter.</p><p>Then, he ordered the Fat Silkworm to press the armor close to his body and conceal it; unless someone examines him carefully, it's completely invisible.</p><p>Being surrounded by Purple Star Eagles isn't the worst; the alarming consumption of energy from resisting the poison mist's erosion is what truly frightens every cultivator.</p><p>With the poison mist no longer a threat, Qin Sang breathes a sigh of relief, pondering his escape.</p><p>His position is extremely unfavorable; he's the first to be attacked in the assault by the beasts, now deep within the Purple Star Eagle flock, with potentially endless reinforcements ahead.  Charging forward is unwise.</p><p>Moreover, the situation is chaotic. Their positions were already scattered for the array, then completely disrupted.  He can't hear anything from elsewhere, suggesting the others are in the same predicament.</p><p>He doesn't know where the underground beast has gone; a chance encounter would be disastrous.</p><p>Qin Sang suspects the beasts' sudden appearance is due to their breaking the stone hall's restriction. If so, these are certainly not all; countless beasts are likely converging from the Purple Mist Wasteland.</p><p>The thought of being surrounded by a sea of beasts sends chills down his spine.</p><p>The wisest choice was to rendezvous with others and escape the Purple Mist Wasteland quickly.  The few purple ferret corpses he’d collected were useless against the onslaught of Purple Star Hawks.</p><p>Time was pressing. Qin Sang made a decision, angling his sword, and carved a bloody path. In his hand, the ebony sword danced like a dragon, then flashed like lightning, its hum a constant companion.</p><p>Free from the burden of the poisonous mist, Qin Sang unleashed his full power, pushing forward rapidly. He didn't use the Ten Directions Yama Banner; this was clearly going to be a hard fight, and the banner consumed far more energy than the ebony sword.</p><p>For now, he could hold his own.</p><p>Hawk corpses piled up at Qin Sang's feet, blood flowing, forming rivers, leaving a bloody trail with each step. Qin Sang, too, was fighting with bloodshot eyes, remembering the direction of the stone hall and charging towards it. He had retreated a considerable distance earlier to avoid the ground beast's attack, never expecting the return journey to be so difficult.</p><p>‘Buzz… buzz…’</p><p>The ebony sword, sensing its master's ferocity, vibrated, drinking deeply of the blood.  The blood couldn't stain the pure blade, but after killing so many Purple Star Hawks, the ebony sword shone brighter, its thirst for slaughter intensified.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, unaffected by his cultivation or his spirit sword, his gaze fixed ahead, forging his bloody path.</p><p>After a distance, Qin Sang noticed the encirclement thinning, then saw a pale glow.</p><p>“It’s the Bone Lotus’s protective shield!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred.  “Is Xiang Yi out there?”</p><p>He immediately pushed his sword to its limits. The ebony sword's radiance surged, its strikes wide and powerful, cleaving through the Purple Star Hawks.</p><p>The others on the other side detected the commotion and moved towards Qin Sang, coming to his rescue.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Two more Purple Star Hawks were beheaded by the spirit sword, opening a passage between them. Qin Sang finally saw the person protected by the Bone Lotus.</p><p>“Cui Ji?”</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the figure bathed in white light wasn't Xiang Yi, but Cui Ji!  The Bone Lotus was somehow in Cui Ji's possession, while Xiang Yi was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Cui Ji held the Bone Lotus in one hand and the Purple Gloom Pearl in the other. The pearl’s strange light was thick and substantial, clearly charged for a long time.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Cui Ji sneered, “Demon, I’ve been waiting for you! This time, see where you run!”</p>
