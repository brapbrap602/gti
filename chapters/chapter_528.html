<h1>Chapter 521: Reincarnation</h1><p>The lower layers have chaotic Qi, but it's easy to refine and is more suitable for lower-level disciples to absorb.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang fixed his gaze on the fire god-like phantom on the mountaintop, gazing for a long time.</p><p>"This is the Ancestor Saint Fire they spoke of…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his face full of shock.</p><p>The fire god-like flames towered above the heavens, seemingly about to burn through the sky!</p><p>Although he had long heard how frantic and terrifying the Ancestor Saint Fire on the summit of Shen Gang Peak was, upon finally seeing it with his own eyes, Qin Sang was still shocked.</p><p>He thought the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire in the Ten Directions Yama Banner was not only strange but also extremely powerful, but compared to the aura emanating from the Ancestor Saint Fire, it was like a tiny spark next to a raging inferno.</p><p>Qin Sang had once felt the aura emanating from the Yuan Ying battle in the Boundless Valley, and now comparing it to the Ancestor Saint Fire, he felt it was inferior.</p><p>As for how great the difference between the two was, Qin Sang couldn't say.</p><p>Firstly, both times he was far away, and his perception was not clear.</p><p>Secondly, both powers were beyond Qin Sang's comprehension; he had no ability to fathom their nature.</p><p>He could only vaguely feel that the Ancestor Saint Fire was extremely terrifying and incredibly violent!</p><p>It is said that the Ancestor Saint Fire didn't originally exist but was related to the first ancestor of the Qingyang Demon Sect, the predecessor who discovered the Qingyang Qi and established the sect here.</p><p>That's why it's called the Ancestor Saint Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Ancestor Saint Fire for a while, then looked past Shen Gang Peak to the further distance.</p><p>Not far behind Shen Gang Peak was the Qingyang Demon Sect's forbidden area.</p><p>There, the clouds were like a canopy, covering the surroundings, clearly sealed by a large formation.  Inside lay the Qingyang Demon Sect's treasure vault and the ancestral master's cave.</p><p>This formation was not simple; it was more mysterious than the Qingyang Demon Sect's protective mountain formation.  Strangely, this formation didn't encompass Shen Gang Peak, which is the most important to the Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>Could it be related to the Ancestor Saint Fire?</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.  The Ancestor Saint Fire was so violent that under the cloud cover, if the Qingyang Demon Sect lacked a means of suppression, it could easily destroy the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered that when the two Yuan Ying cultivators invaded the Qingyang Demon Sect and then suddenly retreated, and the details of that battle were kept secret, could it be related to the Ancestor Saint Fire?</p><p>If the Qingyang Demon Sect was driven to a desperate situation and detonated the Ancestor Saint Fire, even powerful Yuan Ying cultivators wouldn't be able to escape unscathed, would they?</p><p>Of the four Golden Core cultivators in the Qingyang Demon Sect, only one should still be in the sect, but it’s unknown where his cave is located.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the forbidden area and then at Shen Gang Peak.  He had failed to find out where that Golden Core cultivator usually practiced, so he must be careful in his actions going forward.</p><p>After more than two hours, Qin Sang had almost finished observing the inner sect of the Qingyang Demon Sect when he suddenly saw a figure breaking through the blue mist from Shen Gang Peak—it was Shi Ying.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly restored the restriction and lay back in the black coffin.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Shi Ying flashed into the cave, hastily closed the restriction, and sat cross-legged beside the coffin.</p><p>Her face was clearly tired, as if her recent trip to Shen Gang Peak had exhausted her greatly.</p><p>After a brief adjustment of her breath, Shi Ying perked up, extending both hands, palms facing her Dantian.</p><p>Then, her spiritual power whirled in her palms.  Strangely, her spiritual power shone with a green light, dyeing the cave green.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Suddenly, a small spark appeared in the middle of her spiritual power, quickly devouring the spiritual power and growing rapidly, soon transforming into a ball of green fire.</p><p>This was the Qingyang Demon Fire!</p><p>Unlike ordinary flames with intense heat, the Qingyang Demon Fire emitted a cool aura, appearing harmless, but in reality, it was extremely poisonous, making outsiders change color at the mere mention of it.</p><p>When facing Qingyang Demon Sect cultivators, one must not only guard against their magical weapons but also remain vigilant against the Qingyang Demon Fire, being careful not to be touched by it.</p><p>Fortunately, it's very energy-consuming for Qingyang Demon Sect cultivators to control the Qingyang Demon Fire, and they can't use it continuously. Especially disciples below the tenth level of Qi Refinement, they can only use the Demon Fire to maintain their cultivation and are unable to use it against enemies.</p><p>In Shi Ying's hands, this ball of Qingyang Demon Fire was very docile, gently swaying.</p><p>However, Shi Ying's eyes were tense, staring intently at the depths of the Qingyang Demon Fire.</p><p>If one looked closely, one could see a thread-like streak of green light in the heart of the Qingyang Demon Flame, even more intense than the Qingyang Demon Fire itself.</p><p>This green light, like a fish, swam continuously in the heart of the flame.</p><p>It tried to break out but was firmly sealed within the Qingyang Demon Fire.</p><p>After summoning the Demon Fire, Shi Ying's face paled slightly.</p><p>She usually practiced by absorbing a wisp of Qingyang Qi from Shen Gang Peak, refining it into her Demon Fire, and then returning to her cave to slowly refine it further.</p><p>She repeatedly refined the Qingyang Divine Energy until it was fully mastered, then returned to the Divine Energy Peak, repeating the process.  This was her first attempt to take the Qingyang Divine Energy out of the mountain.</p><p>Qingyang Demonic Fire originated from the Qingyang Divine Energy; they were inherently connected. After several tries, Shi Ying successfully sealed a wisp of the Qingyang Divine Energy.</p><p>However, the Qingyang Divine Energy proved highly unstable.  The first time she took it out, it dissipated before she even left the mountain.</p><p>To prevent the wisp from dissipating, Shi Ying condensed and dispersed it repeatedly, spending over an hour until she finally mastered the process and successfully brought a wisp outside.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Shi Ying stared at the flame heart and hissed.  The demonic fire surged, compressing inward. The wisp of Qingyang Divine Energy trembled, then compressed from both ends towards the middle, finally forming a tiny droplet, green and translucent like dew.</p><p>Having stabilized the Qingyang Divine Energy, Shi Ying flicked her sleeve, opening the black coffin and ordering the corpse to sit before her.</p><p>The next step was to attempt the Divine Energy-煞 Impetus Pill refinement.</p><p>The jade slip detailed the process, which seemed plausible enough, claiming that using the corpse’s power to suppress the three divine objects, with careful and precise movements, presented no danger.</p><p>But Shi Ying was still apprehensive. She wasn’t a newcomer to the cultivation world; she’d heard of many things she hadn't personally experienced.  The Qiantian Divine Energy, the Earthly煞 Qi, and the Golden Core—each was far beyond her control.  A single mishap, and her life would be forfeit.</p><p>Before leaving her cave, she'd consulted her sect's archives, but found no mention of the "Ancient Corpse Sect" mentioned in the jade slip.  Indirect inquiries to the senior disciple guarding the archives yielded no results either.</p><p>Therefore, Shi Ying decided to proceed cautiously, testing the feasibility of the jade slip’s method before committing fully.</p><p>With a thought, she separated a portion of the Qingyang Demonic Fire, shaping it into a fiery blade.  Carefully, she sliced off an even smaller wisp of the Qingyang Divine Energy.</p><p>The demonic fire, enveloping the Qingyang Divine Energy, drifted slowly towards the corpse.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shi Ying controlled the corpse, preparing for the impact of the Qingyang Divine Energy.</p><p>At this moment, Shi Ying felt the corpse more responsive than before, exceptionally docile and perfectly obedient, boosting her confidence.</p><p>“Brother Corpse, we must succeed! Once my revenge is achieved, I swear I will set you free, find a way to help your soul rest, and allow you to reincarnate.”</p>
