<h1>Chapter 1610: The Earthly Command</h1><p>Chapter 1610: The Earthly Command</p><p>Outside Hong City.</p><p>An old monk and a woman arrived from the north.</p><p>Near Hong City, the woman sensed something and her expression changed slightly.  She moved swiftly to the top of a nearby mountain.  With a light tap of her foot, the mountain trembled, rocks tumbled down, and her spiritual energy vibrated the air.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Several figures flashed out from the darkness.</p><p>Someone was hiding in these desolate mountains.</p><p>Two figures, one green and one black, were the fastest and strongest, their aura exceptionally sharp. A rough, thunderous shout came from the black figure.</p><p>“Who dares disturb me…”</p><p>The shout was abruptly cut short.</p><p>The person in the black light seemed to have their throat squeezed.</p><p>“Your Majesty!”</p><p>A surprised voice came from the green light. A person in green armor rushed to the mountaintop, bowing deeply. “Your servant greets the Saint King!”</p><p>The black light followed closely. It was a burly man in a black robe. Seeing the woman's ambiguous smile, he grew nervous and quickly bowed with the man in green armor. “Your servant was rude, please punish me, Your Majesty!”</p><p>They were all demons.</p><p>The clothing and armor of the man in green armor and the burly man were clearly magical treasures, effectively concealing their identities. The other demons all emitted varying degrees of demonic energy.</p><p>The woman was the current Demon King, the ruler of the East Sea Saint King Palace—the Qinghu Saint King!</p><p>The old monk was Hui Guang, a transcendent Buddhist sage, who had already entered Hong City.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King asked, “The humans are holding a Dharma Assembly. What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Reporting to Your Majesty, we haven't seen Your Majesty return for a long time and were worried about Your Majesty's safety. We searched all the way from the East Sea. We learned that the human Dharma Assembly usually has transcendent beings appearing, and there might be news of Your Majesty…”</p><p>The man in green armor was interrupted by the Qinghu Saint King's humph.</p><p>“You dared to divide up the Saint King Palace after confirming that I and a human transcendent went missing, didn't you?”</p><p>“Your servant wouldn’t dare!”</p><p>The man in green armor and the burly man were shocked and loudly protested their innocence.</p><p>The man in green armor was quick-witted, repeatedly saying, “Your Majesty, Your servant is wholeheartedly loyal to you! It's just that the Dragon Whale, seeing that Your Majesty was absent, secretly colluded with the Six-Legged One, plotting something. Your servant had no choice but to seal the Saint King Palace and flee here.”</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King merely warned them, not truly punishing them, and said, “What major events happened while I was away?”</p><p>“Two hundred years ago, that Dragon Whale started causing trouble, and many transformed demons were attacked and mysteriously disappeared, leaving no trace. It was likely him. A hundred years ago, he personally led his shrimp soldiers and crab generals, deliberately passing by the Saint King Palace – he should be punished for his disrespect!</p><p>“One hundred and thirty years ago, the seven-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo bloomed, and your servant has sealed the news.”</p><p>…</p><p>The man in green armor recounted the events of the past years.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King was somewhat absent-minded.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao's demonic sound persisted, and ascension seemed like a mirage. Nothing in the mortal world was more important than this; other matters hardly caused her any ripples.</p><p>But when the green-armored man mentioned one thing, the Qinghu Saint King's expression changed drastically, "What did you say?  Beasts?"</p><p>The green-armored man was very surprised that the Saint King didn't even know about the beasts.</p><p>Beasts roamed the Storm Belt, at least at the Transcendent level, and there was more than one.  A new beast passed through the Central Plains every few years, sometimes decades apart.</p><p>The Storm Belt was now countless times more dangerous than before.</p><p>At the Nascent Soul level, at least, the matter of the beasts was common knowledge.</p><p>Previously, some Nascent Soul cultivators would venture out of the barrier into the Storm Belt, hoping for opportunities or ancient treasures.</p><p>Now almost no one dared to go out; encountering a beast meant certain death.</p><p>The only fortunate thing was that the Central Plains barrier seemed to possess some power that these beasts feared or disliked, preventing them from approaching.</p><p>Inside the barrier, it was still safe.</p><p>The Saint King didn't know about the beasts?  Had she been trapped somewhere?</p><p>The green-armored man thought to himself, but wouldn't dare to ask about the Saint King's experiences. "More than two hundred years ago, someone first discovered the beasts, and then more appeared later.  The beasts are incredibly powerful; both races have had reckless individuals try to spy on them and lose their lives. Their origins are unknown, and their nature is frenzied and completely irrational…"</p><p>The woman's expression turned serious.  After a moment of thought, she suddenly leaped towards Hong City.</p><p>The green-armored man and the burly man exchanged glances, ordering the other demons to remain on standby. They quickly followed the Saint King.  Many human experts gathered in Hong City; before, they dared not approach, but now that the Saint King had returned, there was nothing to fear.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King flew above Hong City, her gaze sweeping across the city before she darted towards a verdant hill in the north of the city.</p><p>The hill was covered with lush bamboo forest and a temple was faintly visible.</p><p>A rapid series of bell tolls warned of approaching danger before anyone drew near the mountain temple.</p><p>"Who's there?!"</p><p>Dozens of monks sprang into action, instantly alert.</p><p>Then, the voice of Master Xingji, the abbot of Ganlu Monastery, boomed from within the temple, "Don't be rude!  Brother Xingzhen, please invite the guests in."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>A young-looking monk stepped forward, gesturing for the gatekeepers to open the protective formation.  He chanted a Buddhist invocation. "Esteemed guests, my senior brother requests your presence."</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang, showing no intention of stopping, barged directly into the temple, causing the monks to frown.</p><p>Inside the temple,</p><p>Master Xingji, despite his high rank as abbot, stood humbly before an older monk, respectfully speaking.  He fell silent upon seeing Qinghu Shengwang's forceful entry.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang spoke without ceremony, "Old monk, you know about the rampaging beasts?"</p><p>Huiguang Shengzhe nodded. "I have just learned of it."</p><p>After a pause, Huiguang Shengzhe addressed Master Xingji and the two demonic cultivators, "You two may leave now."</p><p>This was a prearranged plan between him and Qinghu Shengwang. The Heavenly Dao demonic sound couldn't be revealed yet; otherwise, it would cause widespread panic and chaos in the cultivation world.</p><p>For most cultivators, ascension was an unattainable goal, but at least it was a goal.</p><p>Now, regardless of ascension, under the influence of the Heavenly Dao demonic sound, the tribulation of inner demons during breakthroughs would be extremely terrifying, possibly insurmountable.</p><p>With the path to immortality severed, and their only hope lost, what would they strive for?</p><p>In despair, they might resort to reckless actions.</p><p>"The rampaging beasts began after the appearance of the Heavenly Dao demonic sound!"</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang stated gravely, "Gui Xu is the beast's lair, the location of the Dao Mark Gate. The beasts only roamed near Gui Xu; their sudden dispersal indicates a change in Gui Xu! The source of the Heavenly Dao demonic sound may be in Gui Xu; the ascension of the Immortal Palace was just a trigger!"</p><p>"I share that suspicion," Huiguang Shengzhe agreed.</p><p>Qinghu Shengwang acted decisively, "In that case, the priorities are clear.  We must quickly go to the sea, prepare for a hunt! The madness has been building within us for years; the influence of the Heavenly Dao demonic sound is growing stronger, and we'll soon lose control. I don't want to become completely insane!  We must capture the beasts alive.  If we can, we might find fragments of their memories, learning what happened in Gui Xu.  I will send someone back to the palace for the protective palace banners. Old monk, don't worry about the Dharma assembly. I will help you eliminate the villains after the hunt."</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Qin Sang traveled day and night, traversing the six states of Jiangzuo, reaching Nan Zhou.</p><p>Returning to Nan Zhou, Qin Sang knew the roads well and headed straight for Taiyue Sect.</p><p>Approaching Taiyue Sect, Qin Sang concealed himself, carefully approaching from the shadows.</p><p>There was nothing unusual along the way.</p><p>None of the factions showed signs of mobilizing troops; the attention of the Central State's cultivators was drawn to the Ullambana Festival.</p><p>Qin Sang was most concerned about the Eight Views; he hadn't yet discovered Zi Lei Zhenren's movements and didn't know how many experts the Eight Views had brought this time.</p><p>Taiyue Sect's mountain gate was nestled in the Taiyue Mountains in northern Nan Zhou.</p><p>The scenery there was excellent, unlike the poisonous miasma in the south, slightly inferior only to the six states of Jiangzuo.</p><p>Nan Zhou's sects were mostly concentrated in this area.</p><p>The Taiyue Mountains were strategically important, possessing abundant spiritual energy and devoid of poisonous miasma, making them an ideal cultivation location.</p><p>The mountain range stretched for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Taiyue Sect only occupied some of the most spiritually rich peaks, but the entire mountain range fell under their control. Only a few sects subordinate to Taiyue Sect were permitted to establish themselves within the mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang infiltrated the Taiyue Mountains without resistance.</p><p>Taiyue Sect seemed oblivious to any threat; their disciples remained carefree.  Qin Sang encountered several groups of disciples, some visiting relatives and friends, others on training excursions.</p><p>"It seems the Gu God Cult hasn't made a move yet."</p><p>Qin Sang silently appeared atop a barren mountain, gazing towards Taiyue Sect.  After some thought, he decided not to proceed further, instead creating a cave dwelling to lie in wait.</p><p>The emergence of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect would inevitably create a large stir and be impossible to conceal; otherwise, the Gu God Cult wouldn't wait for the Ullambana Festival. He could sense their presence here; getting too close might risk encountering both sides.</p><p>He had no grudges against the Eight Views or the Gu God Cult, and with the situation unclear, he didn't want to choose sides too soon.</p><p>Having established his cave dwelling and carefully concealed it, Qin Sang awakened his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to maintain vigilance while he continued his search for the Solar God Tree.</p><p>...</p><p>In a certain location,</p><p>It appeared to be an underground cavern.</p><p>The cavern was dim.</p><p>Figures, each exuding powerful auras, were crowded together, blending into the shadows.</p><p>Inside the cavern, there was a jade screen.</p><p>A jade disc emitted a faint glow, its surface shimmering like water, the light undulating, its interior a chaotic scene, indistinct.</p><p>Two figures stood before the disc, intently watching, silently awaiting something.  One was Zi Lei Zhenren, the Grandmaster of the Eight Scenery Sect.</p><p>The other was not a Daoist; he wore a dark yellow robe embroidered with mountain patterns.  Appearing to be in his forties, he possessed a strong face, sharp eyes, and an air of authority. This was Yue Lingtian, the current leader of the Taiyue Sect.</p><p>The heads of these two major sects were not in Jinyu Prefecture, but hidden in a cramped underground cavern!</p><p>A heavy silence descended.</p><p>Yue Lingtian checked the time and said, "Why haven't we heard from He Gao yet?"</p><p>"No need to rush,"</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren remained calm. "According to our intelligence, breaking the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's grand array requires the Five Elemental Orders. The more missing, the greater the difficulty and cost. Most critically, it slows the process, attracting more powerful figures.  My junior brother, possessing the Earth Order, infiltrated the Gu God Cult. Even if the Wuxiang remnants suspect him, they'll wait until the Wuxiang Immortal Sect is opened before acting."</p><p>Yue Lingtian hummed in agreement. "I'm worried about Qi Shen at the Dharma Assembly. That old bald-head's Buddhist practice is profound; he sees into people's hearts. I fear my junior brother's cultivation is too shallow to avoid being seen through."</p><p>"They took the Yunming Robe, so their cultivation is at least on par with yours and mine. As long as they are cautious and avoid conflict, they shouldn't be exposed. Even if discovered, it won't affect the overall plan once we're inside the Wuxiang Immortal Sect," Zi Lei Zhenren had clearly planned every step.</p><p>"Unfortunately, Qi Shen and the others must go to Jinyu Prefecture. We're short-handed here.  Brother, how confident are you in subduing the Wuxiang remnants?"</p><p>Yue Lingtian tapped his fingers, calculating. "Since the grand array is opened with the five elemental orders, excluding He Gao, we need at least four Grand Cultivators. If the orders are insufficient, even more.  The saying 'a centipede dies hard' is truly apt. The Wuxiang Immortal Sect has been destroyed for years yet has amassed such strength!  News from Jinyu Prefecture indicates Su Zinan hasn't appeared, and Mo Xingdao, the North Waste's top independent cultivator, is always with him.  I fear both have been drawn to the Gu God Cult."</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren said calmly, "Our goal isn't to eliminate the Wuxiang remnants. That should be the responsibility of the Buddhist and Daoist sects; we don't have to bear it alone."</p><p>Yue Lingtian pondered this, not pressing further.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>The jade disc flickered, its glow flowing inwards, outlining a blurry figure – a female cultivator.</p><p>"Greetings to Master Brother and Master Yue!"</p><p>The cultivator was the only Yuan Ying late-stage female cultivator of the Eight Scenery Sect, Daoist name Su Xia Zhenren.</p><p>Su Xia Zhenren's voice was ethereal, "Brother He Gao reports they have set out and infiltrated the Taiyue Sect, secretly setting up an array to seal it."</p><p>"The Wuxiang Immortal Sect is actually within our sect?"</p><p>While Yue Lingtian had anticipated this, confirmation still astonished him.  He pressed, "Which peak?"</p><p>"We don't know yet. However, the Wuxiang remnants went to Tenglong Cliff first," the female cultivator replied, "Master Brother, you should go now."</p><p>"Tenglong Cliff!"</p><p>Yue Lingtian's eyes widened in disbelief.  "I've cultivated on Tenglong Cliff for centuries and never sensed anything unusual!"</p><p>He wasn't alone.</p><p>Tenglong Cliff was the cultivation site of the Taiyue Sect's successive leaders, and the entire sect was kept in the dark.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren's expression didn't change.  He asked, "Besides the Wuxiang remnants, who else?"</p><p>Su Xia Zhenren said, "Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao are there, and they haven't concealed their identities.  However, Su Zinan isn't with his Moon Shadow Guards, suggesting the Wuxiang remnants haven't revealed crucial secrets to him. They are suspicious of each other and not a unified force.  This can be used to our advantage."</p><p>This was expected.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren wasn't surprised. He nodded. "Anything else?"</p><p>"There's another Grand Cultivator of unknown origin."</p><p>Su Xia Zhenren paused. "It's said he's also a Wuxiang descendant, but lacks a Five Elemental Order. My brother said the Gu God Cult only has the Gold and Wood Orders, plus my Earth Order, only three in total!"</p><p>"Water and Fire are missing!"</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren suddenly understood.  "The Gu God Cult leader is collecting Five Element treasures to refine artifacts to compensate for the missing Orders… Has my junior brother not discerned his true identity?"</p><p>Su Xia Zhenren shook her head slightly. "My brother isn't certain yet.  But based on his observations, the resources he commands are vast; he isn't an independent cultivator and must hold a high position in some sect."</p>
