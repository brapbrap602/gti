<h1>Chapter 628:  A Lingering Spark, Return to Reincarnation</h1><p>When did the grey energy invade my body, and I didn't notice at all?</p><p>Qin Sang's hair stood on end.</p><p>Could it have been during the period after I teleported here, when I was unconscious?</p><p>He couldn't remember how long he'd been out.</p><p>Could I have unknowingly encountered something strange during that time?  I didn't arrive at the other end of the teleportation array, but floated on the river – could that be because of this grey energy?</p><p>Another possibility is that Qin Sang was awake when the grey energy invaded, but didn't notice it.</p><p>Two places are the most suspicious: the bronze hall in Ziwei Palace and the ancient teleportation array.</p><p>These two places were built by ancient cultivators, each with its own mysteries.</p><p>In the bronze hall, Qin Sang's life was in the hands of others, and he was focused on escaping, so he didn't have time to examine the hall's layout carefully.</p><p>However, he still has impressions of the bronze hall: the altar, the demonic pit, and the blood bead in Chen Yan's hand.</p><p>It's clearly not something benevolent.</p><p>And the ancient teleportation array – even today's cultivators can't decipher the secrets of ancient teleportation arrays, let alone this one that requires two high-grade spirit stones and covers an extremely long distance.</p><p>During the teleportation, Qin Sang felt a terrifying power bearing down on him, almost tearing him apart.</p><p>These two places could both be the source of the grey energy.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't understand it – what exactly is this grey energy, and why is it targeting him?</p><p>Qin Sang began to use a wisp of true energy to touch the grey energy, but whether it was the corpse-cultivation or golden elixir true energy, upon entering the grey energy, it was swallowed, like a stone sinking into the sea, without the slightest reaction.</p><p>The same was true for his divine sense; upon entering, that strand of divine sense was immediately severed, and Qin Sang couldn't sense anything within the grey energy.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang dared to use more true energy and divine sense to assault the grey energy, but the result was the same.</p><p>It seems to have taken Qin Sang's qi sea as its nest, even more stubborn than the forbidden talisman fragments!</p><p>The only good news is that the grey energy has been quietly staying in his dantian, next to the golden elixir, motionless, and has not interfered with Qin Sang's cultivation or combat.</p><p>It's unsettling, but Qin Sang can't do anything about it.</p><p>With no other choice, he can only let the grey energy occupy his dantian.</p><p>Fortunately, for now, it seems harmless. He'll figure out a way later when his cultivation is higher.</p><p>Out of sight, out of mind. Qin Sang shifted his 'attention' away from his dantian to his physical body and primordial spirit.</p><p>The Golden Core breakthrough brought about a comprehensive leap; the stubborn corpse energy on his body was completely purged the moment his body was infused with spiritual energy.</p><p>He no longer has to worry about turning into a corpse.</p><p>Recalling the scene where he was rescued by Ya Gu on the Qingyi River, Qin Sang gave a wry smile.</p><p>At that time, he was floating among broken wood and branches, with a broken arm, his corpse energy erupting; not only was his body devoid of color, but it even had a bluish-black tinge, almost like a green-faced, fanged demon.</p><p>Ya Gu was washing clothes by the river and was startled by the corpse with a severed arm, almost kicking him back into the river. Luckily, Qin Sang woke up and called out for help, and was rescued by Ya Gu and taken home.</p><p>Otherwise, he didn't know how long he would have drifted, and if he drifted into the Wilds, it would be even more dangerous.</p><p>"I'll return to Qianhu Village first, settle the debt with Ya Gu, then go look for the spirit insects and the forbidden area."</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The Wu Chongmen's geomantic map isn't detailed outside, especially in the Wilds; it only marks the habitats of about twenty types of spirit insects, none of which are what Qin Sang wants.</p><p>He'll wait until Wu Chongmen gathers more information before searching for his life-bound insect Gu.</p><p>As for the ancient teleportation array, he can only look for it slowly. Qin Sang plans to follow the river he drifted down, to see if he can find anything.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang opened his Qianjun Ring and took out the three Ten Directions Yan Luo Banners.</p><p>One is intact, two are damaged, but only the banner surfaces are harmed.</p><p>According to the refining method of the Kui Yin Ancestor, one only needs to refine the purest essence of souls into silk threads to repair these two treasures.</p><p>The three Ten Directions Yan Luo Banners can be used to set up the simplest formation, yet have the power comparable to a mid-grade magic treasure. For now, they will be Qin Sang's strongest treasures.</p><p>The Ebony Sword and the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring are both low-grade magic treasures.</p><p>Now that Qin Sang has formed his Golden Core, he can start repairing them.</p><p>He placed the damaged banners on his lap, then took out all the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner artifacts.</p><p>Besides the ten he uses, he also has fourteen he seized from the remnants of the Kui Yin Sect, more than two sets.</p><p>These two sets of ghost banners are even more powerful than talisman treasures, arguably the strongest below magic treasures.</p><p>Now that Qin Sang has formed his Golden Core, he doesn't need them, but if he auctions them off, it will definitely cause a sensation, with countless Foundation Establishment cultivators vying for them, fetching a high price.</p><p>However, repairing the magical artifact requires a vast amount of pure soul energy, and these twenty-four banners may not be enough.</p><p>Qin Sang cannot leave the Western Frontier for now.  The Western Frontier is so barren that there are probably few soul-refining artifacts, and it's impossible to gather so much pure soul energy.  She has no choice but to extract the essence of the ghost banners to repair the artifact.</p><p>Whether searching for insects, secret realms, or forbidden lands, she must venture deep into the wilderness. Qin Sang needs to improve her strength as quickly as possible; she can't wait any longer.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>Twenty-four small ghost banners flew from Qin Sang's hand and were planted in three rows on the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the refining method several times, then picked up the least damaged artifact and summoned a ghost banner from the ground.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>Suddenly, a gust of cold wind howled, making the cave extremely frigid and filled with shadowy figures of countless ghosts.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A ghost banner suddenly shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind; she discarded the broken banner.  Her palm moved forward, instantly enveloping the cold wind with her substantial True Qi, squeezing it into a ball that floated towards her.</p><p>Piercing screams echoed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, her hand seals changing continuously as she sent complex restrictions from her fingertips into the cold wind.</p><p>After a moment, a wisp of grayish-white smoke slowly emerged from the cold wind, extremely fine, like a thread. This is the purest soul energy condensed into soul threads, which can be directly used to weave the surface of the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>As the soul threads were extracted, the movement of the cold wind lessened.</p><p>Soon, the soul thread broke, only a foot long.</p><p>Destroying one ghost banner yielded only such a short thread.  It's hard to imagine how the ancestor Kui Yin gathered enough for ten artifacts back then.</p><p>Qin Sang hooked a finger, and the soul thread floated to her fingertip, seeming to have life, automatically wrapping around it and conveying a chilling sensation.</p><p>She didn't rush to repair the artifact, instead refocusing on the ball of cold wind.</p><p>The screams had stopped, but some ghosts hadn't vanished, with green lights floating in the wind – the last trace of their spirits.</p><p>It's said in the cultivation world that if a single spirit remains, there's still a chance of reincarnation.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner artifact is less vicious than the other artifacts.  Repairing it only requires the purest soul energy and doesn't require continued imprisonment of souls.</p><p>"Is there truly reincarnation in this world?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, finally waving her hand and releasing the cold wind.  The green lights drifted away and gradually disappeared.</p>
