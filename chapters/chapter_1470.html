<h1>Chapter 1462: Unfettered Vajra (4k, two-in-one)</h1><p>Chapter 1462: Unfettered Vajra (4k, two-in-one)</p><p>Tong Lingyu spoke at length to dissuade Qin Sang.  </p><p>Revealing the “Treasure Tome” served as a subtle warning against any foolish ambitions. Qin Sang, not cultivating an ice-type cultivation method, could never gain the treasure's recognition.</p><p>Tong Lingyu hadn't expected that even 10% of the power of the Four-fold Serpent Seal wouldn't significantly trouble Qin Sang.</p><p>Most cultivators would have immediately surrendered upon witnessing that technique.</p><p>She hesitated to unleash her full power because, while the treasure was immensely strong, its drain on spiritual energy was equally terrifying.  This wasn't Xuan Tian Palace; she didn't want to expend so much spiritual energy in a pointless fight, increasing her own risk.</p><p>The swirling demonic flames surged towards Qin Sang, gathering before him to reform into a flame dragon, which then quietly coiled at his feet, its power subdued.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, his gaze fixed on the demonic flames.</p><p>He reviewed his experience countering the Four-fold Serpent Seal, making a mental assessment.</p><p>He hadn't felt overwhelmed; he was far from his limit.</p><p>If Tong Lingyu was being truthful, the demonic flames, controlled through the Fire Lotus and eighteen demonic banners, were slightly more powerful than 10% of the Four-fold Serpent Seal's might, but certainly couldn't withstand 20%.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's final statement must have held some reservation.</p><p>If Tong Lingyu had used her full power, the eighteen demonic banners wouldn't stand a chance against the Four-fold Serpent Seal; his defeat would have been certain.</p><p>There was indeed no need to continue fighting.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean Qin Sang was afraid of Tong Lingyu.</p><p>A treasure only represented a portion of her strength. Life and death in cultivation depended on numerous factors.</p><p>Though it was just a sparring match, with a direct confrontation, the Four-fold Serpent Seal hadn't displayed much versatility, but it was clear that it was an offensive treasure.</p><p>At least, relying solely on the Four-fold Serpent Seal, Tong Lingyu couldn't pursue and kill Qin Sang.</p><p>His exceptional escape techniques were Qin Sang's confidence against other powerful cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Tong Lingyu's hesitations, guessing that controlling the treasure must have been extremely draining on spiritual energy, a reason why even Yuan Ying stage cultivators couldn't fully utilize its power.</p><p>He wondered what percentage of the Four-fold Serpent Seal's power the Xuan Tian Palace master could wield.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought without asking; he knew Tong Lingyu wouldn't answer.</p><p>He refocused on himself, his gaze sweeping across the demonic banners.</p><p>He had initially held high hopes for the demonic fire entities sealed within the banners, even harboring unrealistic expectations.</p><p>The difference between artifacts and treasures was astounding!</p><p>The Xu Ling Sect and Bing Han might have been too optimistic about the difficulty of refining treasures.</p><p>He made his calculations.</p><p>By refining the nine nether demonic fire entities sealed within the eighteen demonic banners into a Fire Lotus, the power, due to the refinement process, might approach that of a treasure – a Nascent Soul-level divine ability.</p><p>This was just a rough estimate, as Qin Sang's mastery of the "Fire Seed Lotus" was still limited.</p><p>However, if he could complete the refinement before reaching the Nascent Soul stage, this ability would be incredibly powerful.  Other Yuan Ying cultivators, even wielding treasures, could only utilize a fraction of their power.</p><p>And he, with the Fire Lotus refined from the complete demonic fire, might even stand a chance against a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>Qin Sang envisioned that scene, then quickly returned to reality, knowing it was mere wishful thinking. He hadn't encountered a Nascent Soul cultivator, but he'd witnessed the terror of a Demon Lord.</p><p>The "Fire Seed Lotus" was the most difficult cultivation method among all his abilities.  How long it would take to refine the demonic fire entity remained unknown.</p><p>If the Fire Lotus's level surpassed his own cultivation, he wasn't certain he could wield it properly.  If the spiritual energy consumption was as terrifying as a treasure's, it would be very disappointing.</p><p>The good news was that as the Fire Lotus improved, his spiritual sense would also increase.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's prolonged silence, Tong Lingyu assumed he was awestruck by the treasure's power and didn't urge him, secretly mobilizing her spiritual energy. If Qin Sang remained unconvinced, she would have to act.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang collected his thoughts, raised his head, his expression serious, and bowed.  "The power of the treasure is beyond imagination. Qin acknowledges his defeat and thanks Daoist Tong for the instruction."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's surrender, Tong Lingyu's expression softened, and she smiled. "Daoist Qin's banner treasure is among the best artifacts this Palace has ever seen.  In time, Daoist Qin will surely dominate the North Sea!"</p><p>"It's still far inferior to a treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, seeming deeply disheartened.</p><p>Tong Lingyu smiled without speaking.</p><p>At this point, seeing the two cease their struggle, Liuli flew back from a distance, standing silently behind the Grand Elder, her gaze involuntarily drawn to the demonic banner surrounding Qin Sang.</p><p>She had long known the power of spiritual treasures, but only now did she realize she had underestimated the power of Qin Sang's artifact.  No wonder he was so confident.</p><p>"Friend Qin, do you have any other matters to attend to? If not, shall we depart now and return to Xuan Tian Palace?"</p><p>Tong Lingyu, eager to return to the palace to select treasures and return the sacred artifact, extended the invitation to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said, "Please wait a moment, my friends. I have some arrangements to make."</p><p>Leaving the two women, Qin Sang returned to Mingzhu Island. He first paid his respects to Yinquan Zhenren, bidding him farewell and promising to see him again later.  He also sent a letter to Tan Hao, using a code to inform him of his movements.</p><p>He instructed Tan Hao to remain in the Ghost Mother's Cave to focus on his cultivation and prepare for his Nascent Soul stage breakthrough, instructing him to contact Qin Sang if needed.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang returned to the small island and rejoined the two women.</p><p>The three set off eastward together.</p><p>During their flight, Tong Lingyu suddenly took an item from her pouch and gave it to Liuli. "This Yin Li Pearl was originally intended to lure the fiend and recover the sacred artifact. Now that Friend Qin has returned the sacred artifact, your contribution cannot be ignored. This treasure is a reward from the sect."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, unsure of its unique properties, and looked at Liuli.</p><p>Liuli caught the Yin Li Pearl, her expression remaining unreadable, showing no obvious signs of joy. "Thank you, Grand Elder, for your gift."</p><p>"I'm a few hundred years younger than your master. I used to call your master 'Ice Aunt.'  Technically, we're peers.  Calling me Grand Elder makes me feel old!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu, in high spirits, even made a playful remark to Liuli.</p><p>Tong Lingyu intended to tease the ice queen, but seeing Liuli's somber expression, she quickly stopped, sighing softly. "Your master, despite having the potential to become a great cultivator, tragically perished. Fortunately, she trained such a talented disciple like you, making her life worthwhile. As for me, I suffered from a bout of demonic possession, making a breakthrough hopeless. Otherwise, our Xuan Tian Palace would have had three late-stage cultivators, a glorious era indeed."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang subconsciously glanced at Liuli.</p><p>Tong Lingyu was unaware that Liuli's master was not dead, but imprisoned in Ziwei Palace for hundreds of years, her fate uncertain after the palace ascended.</p><p>Why had Liuli concealed this from the sect? Was there some hidden reason?</p><p>Qin Sang calmly withdrew his gaze, deciding not to meddle.</p><p>After comforting Liuli, Tong Lingyu turned to Qin Sang.  "As you will be a guest elder at Listening Snow Tower, you'll inevitably interact with Elder Mei and the others. The less we meet now, the less likely we are to expose ourselves.  Furthermore, the sacred artifact cannot be lost and must be returned to the forbidden area as soon as possible.  It's best if you and I depart immediately and return to Xuan Tian Palace with the utmost speed."</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections and agreed to follow her lead.</p><p>Upon reaching the vicinity of the Xuan Tian Palace's base, Tong Lingyu and Liuli left Qin Sang behind to make arrangements.</p><p>An hour later, Tong Lingyu returned. To conceal the relationship between Qin Sang and Liuli, Liuli contacted the Grand Elder secretly and did not accompany them this time.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to take flight.</p><p>Tong Lingyu then removed a delicately carved coral fish whistle from her wrist, smiled at Qin Sang, placed it to her lips, and blew gently.</p><p>"The journey east is long; this will save you some effort." she explained.</p><p>The whistle emitted a clear, melodious sound.</p><p>As the sound faded, the whistle subtly dissolved, transforming into a translucent, ethereal fish, seeming to be the fish's very spirit.</p><p>The silver crescent moon was just rising.</p><p>A faint moonlit glow bathed the vast ocean, gently rippling the surface. The lingering sound of the whistle created a unique tranquility.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was captivated by the ethereal fish.</p><p>The transparent fish leaped from Tong Lingyu's fingertip, lively and agile, soaring into the air like a carp leaping the Dragon Gate. It seemed as if the celestial crescent moon were a boat on the Milky Way, and the fish aimed to jump aboard.</p><p>As the ethereal fish leaped, the seawater was mysteriously drawn upward, the currents pulled against the flow, rising towards the fish.</p><p>In a short while, an inverted waterfall materialized before them, flowing from the sea towards the Milky Way.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, watching the ethereal fish swim gracefully within the waterfall, ascending steadily into the sky.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sound of the whistle lingered in his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed a strange energy emanating from the ethereal fish, its meaning elusive to him.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable urge, and looked down at the sea.</p><p>At some point, more and more fish were drawn to them, some oddly shaped, some vibrantly colored.  Many even glowed, scattered amongst the shoal, countless as if the Milky Way had descended to earth.</p><p>Just as they were captivated by the dreamlike beauty...</p><p>The fish suddenly stirred, two aggressive blue sharks swam in, circling at their feet.</p><p>Tong Lingyu pointed at the great fish spirit, about to act, when a ethereal cry came from afar, like a whisper from the deep sea.</p><p>"Whale song."</p><p>Tong Lingyu listened, smiling, "Good fortune. A deep-sea whale is nearby."</p><p>Qin Sang followed Tong Lingyu's gaze.</p><p>A moment later, a huge spout of water appeared first, a dark silhouette emerging from the sea – just a part of the enormous creature beneath.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The great fish spirit leaped from the waterfall, its body transforming into a blue orb of water.</p><p>The whistle dissipated.</p><p>The nearby fish lost their attraction, including the two blue sharks, swimming away reluctantly.  The deep-sea whale approached, and the water orb that was the great fish spirit merged into its head.</p><p>Then, Tong Lingyu produced a small palanquin, tossed it, and ropes automatically wrapped around the whale's dorsal fin. The palanquin, like a boat, settled steadily on the water, suspended behind the whale, its treasure light merging with the whale.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, please."</p><p>Tong Lingyu gestured. Qin Sang stepped into the palanquin and sat down.</p><p>Tong Lingyu whispered something to the whale, then took out a small vial, poured out a pill and fed it to the whale.  Gently patting the whale, she boarded the palanquin.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The whale turned, creating a massive wave, heading directly east at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The palanquin remained remarkably steady, the water unable to penetrate it.</p><p>Tong Lingyu nodded with satisfaction, reached out and gathered moonlight, gently smoothing it into a thin veil to hang over the window, shielding them from prying eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed, confident that no one would dare to interrupt their journey.  He apologized to Tong Lingyu, set up a protective barrier around himself, ordered the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to remain vigilant, then took out a jade slip, delved into it, and fell silent.</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't mind, also using a veil to create a barrier, and closed her eyes to cultivate.</p><p>Under the moonlight,</p><p>only the whale broke through the waves, its song and the sound of the surf composing a beautiful melody.</p><p>...</p><p>The contents of the jade slip were the "Seven Master Buddha Seals".</p><p>This place was far from the Yinri Realm, not reachable in a short time. Qin Sang finally had time to comprehend this physical cultivation technique.</p><p>He had skimmed through it once before.</p><p>Now, he started again, carefully considering each word, meticulously studying it.</p><p>He cultivated a demon-race body cultivation technique, vastly different from human techniques, and he was completely unfamiliar with human body cultivation techniques.  Comprehending this felt like entering a foreign realm; it was quite challenging.</p><p>The seven Buddha seals of the "Seven Master Buddha Seals" were seven techniques.</p><p>However, this technique required the use of Buddhist hand seals to mobilize the power of the body.</p><p>The general principle stated:  "Hands form the seals, mouth chants the mantras, heart visualizes the Buddha."</p><p>These words contained the true meaning, the key to understanding the "Seven Master Buddha Seals."  Qin Sang could only grasp the superficial aspects.</p><p>He understood the seals and mantras, but what puzzled him was the "heart visualization of the Buddha."  What he visualized was not the familiar Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, but a blurry Buddha statue.</p><p>He didn't understand, so he simply memorized it and continued to the next section.</p><p>The first seal of the "Seven Master Buddha Seals," the Auspicious Seal, could be practiced by Golden Core stage body cultivators, as it wasn't overly powerful and wouldn't backlash, being the first of the seven seals.  Its most important function was to mobilize the body's Qi and blood, allowing for peak combat readiness; its power was somewhat weak.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently at the early stage of the fourth level of the Heavenly Demon Transformation, and could practice the first four seals. The other three seals were the Lotus Seal, the Wheel Seal, and the Demon-Crushing Seal. Their seals were different, yet consistent, with power increasing progressively, all offensive seals.</p><p>Qin Sang could see some of the subtleties in these four seals.</p><p>As for the last three seals, he could only memorize them vaguely, without any understanding. They were the Diamond Great Wisdom Seal, the Diamond Heavenly Armor Seal, and the Diamond Free Seal!</p><p>"Legend says that Buddhist Vajras are indestructible and unbreakable, but I wonder if these last three seals live up to their name,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, returning his attention to the first four seals.</p><p>Though not a Buddhist disciple, his cultivation was high enough that once he grasped the true meaning of the technique, comprehending the first seal wouldn't be difficult.  He was only hindered by Tong Lingyu's presence, lacking the opportunity to practice.</p><p>Riding the whale.</p><p>The whale swam tirelessly, traversing countless miles across the boundless ocean.</p><p>Qin Sang immersed himself in the "Seven Master Buddha Seals," increasingly finding the technique ingenious, broadening his horizons, and even allowing him to reflect on himself and gain a deeper understanding of body cultivation.</p><p>Time passed in cultivation.</p><p>One day,</p><p>Qin Sang was awakened by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, sensing the barrier being touched, and hearing Tong Lingyu's voice: "Daoist Qin, we're almost ashore."</p><p>----Extra----</p><p>"Burning Cloud Immortal," a cultivation novel, written by a fellow reader.</p><p>Following the legacy of ancestors, walking the path of the strong, please support by collecting and liking.
