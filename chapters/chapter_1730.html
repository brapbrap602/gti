<h1>Chapter 1721: Who Descends into Hell</h1><p>“True Monarch Qin, these are the records concerning the ferocious beasts of the Returning Ruins.”</p><p>Master Xingji, holding a jade slip, presented it to Qin Sang.</p><p>His demeanor was respectful, his etiquette impeccable, yet his expression remained impassive.</p><p>Beside him, Xingren and another high-ranking monk of the Sweet Dew Monastery sat cross-legged on meditation cushions.  Except for those who were on pilgrimage, all the grand cultivators within the monastery had emerged from seclusion to welcome the True Monarch's arrival.</p><p>Xingren and the other monk looked at Qin Sang, seemingly wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p>Their eyes held questions and anticipation, as well as a barely suppressed elation.</p><p>For cultivators of their level to display such behavior indicated the gravity of the matter, something that stirred them deeply.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang had once gathered his disciples and spoken of the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Whispers. All grand cultivators of the Sweet Dew Monastery were privy to this knowledge, understanding that the whispers obstructed the path, making the Great Dao difficult to attain.</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation a hundred years ago was only at the late Nascent Soul stage, comparable to theirs.  He had been pursued by the Holy King Azure Fox, a fact beyond doubt.  It was impossible for him to have broken through before the Heavenly Transformation.</p><p>Yet, upon reappearing, he had ascended to the venerable position of True Monarch!</p><p>Could it be that a turning point had arrived?</p><p>Now, with the matter of the Red Cloud Blessed Land concluded, Qin Sang naturally hadn't harmed those novice monks. He released them and came to the Sweet Dew Monastery with the other monks.</p><p>This was the monastery's Boundless Hall.</p><p>The hall doors were tightly shut, with the Great Sage Black Lion lying before them.</p><p>The other monks of the Sweet Dew Monastery were unaware of the True Monarch's visit.  Seeing their fellow disciples safe and sound, they assumed the troubles within the Blessed Land had been resolved, and everything was as usual.</p><p>Within the hall.</p><p>Master Xingji sat cross-legged, eyes slightly closed, fingers rolling over prayer beads, silently reciting Buddhist scriptures.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, his divine sense probing into the jade slip.  The first things he saw were vivid images of ferocious beasts, each one bizarre and grotesque.</p><p>Some beasts had counterparts in the mortal world, resembling certain types of demonic beasts.</p><p>Yet, like the frenzied whale hunted by the Dragon Whale Clan, their essence was vastly different from demonic beasts.  From the images alone, one could sense their ferocious aura.</p><p>According to Master Xingji, these were ferocious beasts that cultivators of this world had witnessed firsthand.  They were records and images compiled over countless years by numerous predecessors, a legacy left behind.</p><p>These records originated not only from the Buddhist and Daoist sects, but also from the Formless Immortal Sect and even more ancient sects.</p><p>Most of the entries contained only an image; some didn't even have that, offering only a few terse descriptions.</p><p>Before the Heavenly Transformation, these beasts roamed only within the Returning Ruins, rarely leaving their lairs.</p><p>Only Nascent Soul cultivators had the ability to reach the Returning Ruins, and the recorded beasts were those that posed a threat to them. Therefore, the weakest beasts in the illustrations were at the Nascent Soul level.</p><p>Yet, the number was far fewer than Qin Sang had imagined.</p><p>Moreover, these were clearly not all the beasts within the Returning Ruins. For instance, the manta ray-like beast that the two Nascent Soul cultivators had lured out during their hunt was not recorded.</p><p>Furthermore, the descriptions of the beasts' powers were far from detailed, save for a few, most were brushed over briefly.</p><p>For example, one record read:</p><p>Resembling a Flood Dragon, with long horns and thousands of black boils on its back.  Slow of wit.  When startled, the boils rupture, releasing pus black as ink that can corrode True Essence.</p><p>The implication was that upon encountering such a beast, one should remain calm, conceal their presence and aura, and carefully avoid it. Otherwise, one would startle the beast.  Of course, this advice applied only before the Heavenly Transformation.</p><p>Regarding the beasts' powers and how to counter them, this record was considered relatively detailed.</p><p>Throughout the ages, Nascent Soul cultivators were numerous in the Middle Continent, yet these were the only records available.</p><p>The reason was that the Returning Ruins was easy to enter but difficult to exit, fraught with countless dangers. The purpose of entering the Returning Ruins was to seek the Dao Beacon for ascension; there was only this one path.  Forced returns carried the risk of death.  The ferocious beasts were powerful, and the surrounding area was perilous.  Cultivators were eager to avoid them, not provoke them.</p><p>Cases like the ancestor of the Great Sage Dragon Whale, who guarded the Returning Ruins for three hundred years, single-handedly slaying the frenzied whale and dragging it back to the Middle Continent, were extremely rare.</p><p>Images of various beasts flashed before his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang put down the jade slip and asked, "That ferocious beast you all captured alive back then, did you learn anything from it after capturing it?"</p><p>Shortly after the beast hunt, the Sweet Dew Monastery had publicly displayed their findings, which Qin Sang already knew through his avatar.</p><p>What Qin Sang was asking now, of course, was not this, but what they might have concealed.</p><p>"Everything obtained back then was made public, without reservation, nothing was concealed."</p><p>Master Xingji replied, palms pressed together.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that it seemed he could only learn what happened inside the Returning Ruins and what it looked like by entering it himself.</p><p>"When did the two fellow Daoists embark on their journey?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang and Holy King Azure Fox had already journeyed east for ascension.</p><p>Master Xingji answered without hesitation, "Sixty-five years ago."</p><p>After Qin Sang achieved Nascent Soul, consolidating his cultivation, along with his journey to the East Sea, had consumed nearly ten years.</p><p>Sixty-five years ago, just fifteen years after the three sects' oath.</p><p>They were truly in a hurry!</p><p>He wondered how deeply they were affected by the Demonic Whispers. Sixty-five years was enough time for Holy Sage Huiguang and Holy King Azure Fox to reach the Returning Ruins.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were less affected by the storm belt than Core Formation cultivators. They could also absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth while flying, allowing them to fly for extended periods without needing to search for refuge to recover True Essence. Before the Heavenly Transformation, it took only thirty years to reach the edge of the Returning Ruins.</p><p>Double that time, they should have arrived no matter what.</p><p>If all went well, they might have even ascended to the upper realm.</p><p>"Did the two fellow Daoists leave behind any treasures like soul lamps?"</p><p>Qin Sang speculated, if they discovered the changes in the Returning Ruins, if things were impossible, would they return to the Middle Continent?</p><p>Unexpectedly, Master Xingji shook his head. "My master uncle said that on this eastward journey, if ascension is achieved, so be it.  If ascension fails, then we shall perish within the Returning Ruins, leaving our findings and insights on Mount Daiyu. If future generations are fortunate enough to achieve Nascent Soul and inherit our will, they can reopen the Heavenly Gate. Therefore, there is no need to leave a soul lamp."</p><p>As he spoke, Master Xingji couldn't help but glance at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>Succeed or die trying.</p><p>The three who journeyed east had never considered turning back.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, whose puppet had been chosen, had also accompanied them, making it three.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up another jade slip, which contained information related to the Returning Ruins.</p><p>The Heavenly Gate mentioned by Master Xingji was the Dao Beacon referred to by the Ghost Mother. Cultivators ascended to the greater world through the Dao Beacon, hence it was called the Heavenly Gate.</p><p>There is a great chasm in the East Sea, truly a bottomless valley, its depths immeasurable, called the Returning Ruins.  The waters of the eight directions and nine regions, the flow of the Heavenly River, all pour into it, yet it neither increases nor decreases.</p><p>Entering the depths of the Returning Ruins, one can see a black, turbid current, flowing endlessly, its origin and destination unknown. The Heavenly Gate lies hidden within.</p><p>Mount Daiyu is a celestial island within the Returning Ruins.</p><p>This island is truly peculiar. The dangers within the Returning Ruins far exceed those of the storm belt.  The refuges that have survived the storm belt would soon capsize if they fell into the Returning Ruins.</p><p>One only sees ferocious beasts roaming and endless waters in the Returning Ruins, no blessed lands or cave heavens, yet there is such a celestial island, suspended alone, remaining safe and sound to this day.</p><p>Countless years ago, the cultivators of this world discovered Mount Daiyu.  It remains suspended within the Returning Ruins, its location unchanging for millennia.  Unfortunately, it is unsuitable for cultivation, serving only as a temporary resting place.</p><p>The jade slip Qin Sang now held contained rather general text, lacking a detailed description of the Returning Ruins' interior.</p><p>What he desired most now was the path to ascension, the safe route to the Heavenly Gate, and the insights and experiences of past generations within the Returning Ruins.</p><p>These were all invaluable experiences.</p><p>But the jade slip contained none of this, only marking the location of Mount Daiyu.</p><p>Because all of this was within Mount Daiyu.</p><p>Initially, the path to ascension was fraught with peril, a near-certain death.  Past generations inscribed their insights and experiences on the celestial island to guide those who followed.  Later generations, inheriting the legacy of their predecessors, would then guide those who came after.  That safe path to ascension was paved through such generations of accumulated effort.</p><p>Finding Mount Daiyu meant finding the path to ascension.</p><p>Holy Sage Huiguang and the others were venturing down this path.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully memorized the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>In fact, after the demonic beast rebellion ended, he had already obtained similar information from the demonic beast clans.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, this world was a cage, and the same held true for the Holy Kings of the demonic beasts. Ascending to the upper realm was a common pursuit for cultivators of both races, so they were willing to share information.  Hence, the content was largely the same.</p><p>‘Tap, tap, tap…’</p><p>Qin Sang’s fingers lightly tapped the jade slip, contemplating.</p><p>He remained silent, and the three high-ranking monks dared not ask.</p><p>The Boundless Hall was utterly silent.</p><p>What Qin Sang was thinking about was naturally the matter of ascension.</p><p>He wondered how Holy Sage Huiguang and the others were faring, and what they could accomplish within the Returning Ruins.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul cultivators of the two races, a Nascent Soul level puppet, and the Five Elements Crown, the Middle Continent’s premier spiritual treasure that had already given birth to a demonic spirit – their combined strength was terrifying.</p><p>Upon sensing the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Whispers, Qin Sang had guessed that something was amiss with the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Just now, upon inquiring with Master Xingji, his suspicions were confirmed. The one who had caused chaos back then was an Ancient Devil, and not just an Ancient Devil. The female cultivator who had set the trap at Mount Disho was actually the demonic spirit of the spiritual treasure, fused with the Ancient Devil.  Affected by the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Whispers, her intelligence had been replaced by madness, making communication impossible.</p><p>Even if this group perished within the Returning Ruins, they should have left behind some experience. He would know once he entered Mount Daiyu in the future.</p><p>If he went early enough, perhaps some of them might still be alive.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his own situation. He had only just consolidated his cultivation after achieving Nascent Soul and hadn’t had time to cultivate further. Even before the Heavenly Transformation, Nascent Soul cultivators would cultivate diligently for a while, and only after reaching a bottleneck would they consider ascension. Now, the Returning Ruins was certainly even more dangerous.</p><p>Going east too early, his cultivation wouldn’t be enough.</p><p>Going too late, he would be alone and isolated.</p><p>It was truly a difficult decision!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, flicking his finger to return the jade slip. He pondered for a moment, then asked, “You two fellow Daoists requested the Soul Calming Incense formula from this poor Daoist, also wanting to deduce a superior Soul Calming Incense with greater efficacy, correct? How many sticks have you refined? Do you have any left? Let me see them."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's question, both Xingren and the other monk's eyes brightened.</p><p>They keenly noticed the word "also" in Qin Sang's words.</p><p>Ever since Qin Sang reappeared, they had one question: how exactly did this person overcome the Heart Devil Tribulation?</p><p>Judging by Qin Sang's tone, the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Whispers hadn't vanished.</p><p>Since Qin Sang didn’t offer the information himself, they weren't comfortable asking directly.  They were practically bursting with curiosity.</p><p>They knew that Qin Sang, burdened by the immense pressure of being pursued by a demonic beast Holy King, could still achieve Nascent Soul so quickly; his mental fortitude was absolutely top-notch.  But Holy Sage Huiguang had said that the Heart Devil Tribulation couldn't be overcome by mental fortitude alone; there had to be something else.</p><p>They remembered that Qin Sang's avatar had studied alchemy in the monastery, often consulting with alchemy grandmasters.</p><p>Could it be that this True Monarch Qin also shared the same idea as their master uncle, starting his deductions before breaking through to Nascent Soul and successfully refining a superior Soul Calming Incense, inadvertently overcoming the Heart Devil Tribulation?</p><p>They hoped the superior Soul Calming Incense was effective, so they too would have a glimmer of hope!</p><p>With Qin Sang’s request, Master Xingji dared not refuse, rising and excusing himself.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I'll go with you."</p><p>Master Xingji silently stopped and said to Xingren and the other monk, "You two come as well."</p><p>Leaving the Boundless Hall, they arrived at a forbidden area within the Sweet Dew Monastery. Qin Sang watched as Master Xingji retrieved a jade casket.  Upon opening it, a碧 green light appeared, accompanied by a refreshing fragrance.</p><p>Seeing the treasures within the casket, Qin Sang furrowed his brow slightly.  Inside were not incense sticks, but three balls of green light, gently undulating, yet to take shape.</p><p>Master Xingji explained, "My master uncle and the Holy King gathered alchemy grandmasters to deduce the formula and finally achieved some results. They refined five sticks of superior Soul Calming Incense, but due to insufficient spiritual herbs, only two were successfully formed, leaving behind these three unfinished essences."</p><p>Qin Sang requested the superior Soul Calming Incense formula, and upon seeing the newly added spiritual herbs, he couldn't help but marvel.</p><p>The new herbs were all heavenly treasures, their value far exceeding that of the original formula’s ingredients, some even obtained from Immortal Palaces.  The two Nascent Soul cultivators, working together to scour the resources of both races, had only managed to refine two sticks, leaving behind three embryonic forms.</p><p>Of course, precious herbs alone weren't enough to refine the incense.  Xiao Xiangzi’s creation of the Soul Calming Incense was groundbreaking.  Continuing to deduce along Xiao Xiangzi's line of thought made it easier for them.</p><p>The newly added herbs were all compatible with the properties of the Soul Calming Incense.</p><p>With his avatar studying alchemy, Qin Sang, although not an alchemy grandmaster, could fully understand this formula and knew that as long as he gathered the spiritual herbs and refined these three green lights again, he could obtain three sticks of superior Soul Calming Incense, which was much simpler than starting from scratch.</p><p>"Thousand-Leaf Awakening Ganoderma…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the spiritual herbs he had never heard of and shook his head inwardly. Gathering all the ingredients was no easy task.</p><p>He naturally intended to accept these three Soul Calming Incense embryonic forms; he didn't think the Sweet Dew Monastery would dare refuse.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang could express his intentions, Master Xingji's expression turned solemn, and he bowed deeply to him. "This poor monk has revealed everything he knows and willingly offers these three essence embers to the True Monarch, hoping to be of some assistance."</p><p>Qin Sang held the jade casket, his expression unchanged, looking at him with a faint, almost imperceptible smile.</p><p>Xingren and the other monk's expressions shifted slightly.</p><p>Although they were just embryonic forms, the difficulty of refining them was extremely high, requiring the personal involvement of two Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Originally, they only needed to gather the missing spiritual herbs.  Giving away the embryonic forms meant not only starting the refining process from scratch, but also facing a much higher chance of failure without the assistance of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Ignoring the two monks, Master Xingji saw Qin Sang's expression and sighed deeply.  "Master Uncle Huiguang, blinded by obsession, used the 'Heavenly Devil Illumination Scripture' to manipulate the True Monarch, planting a karmic seed. Now that the True Monarch has arrived, his descendants should bear the consequences."</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, "This poor Daoist hasn't pursued the matter yet, but I didn't expect you to bring it up yourself."</p><p>Master Xingji felt a bitterness in his heart. This secret technique was a true inheritance of the monastery, impossible to deny.  It would be too late if he waited for Qin Sang to pursue it.</p><p>"Master Uncle informed this poor monk of this matter, and this poor monk is also at fault. I am willing to offer this life to repay the True Monarch, not seeking to sever karma, but only to appease the True Monarch's anger. The other monks in the monastery are unaware of this; I hope the True Monarch will not implicate the innocent."</p><p>As Master Xingji spoke, he sat cross-legged on the ground, his life force extinguishing itself.</p><p>Xingren and the other monk finally understood the reason, utterly shocked.</p><p>"Senior Brother, Junior Brother, you must remember that this is my own volition. Do not harbor resentment towards the True Monarch."</p><p>Master Xingji pressed his palms together as his life faded.</p><p>"Amitabha."</p><p>The two monks witnessed their abbot's passing, understanding his good intentions, their faces filled with grief.</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Master Xingji, sighed softly, and raised a finger, pressing it against the abbot's brow.</p><p>Master Xingji suddenly revived, momentarily believing he was in hell.  The two monks were filled with joy and gratitude.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the jade casket and said indifferently, "This is a karmic matter between this poor Daoist and Fellow Daoist Huiguang. I shall settle it with him personally.  Quickly summon the various sects of the Middle Continent; this poor Daoist has important matters to discuss."</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
