<h1>Chapter 517: The Unexpected</h1><p>When Yu Batian returned to his sect, he always took this path.</p><p>The mountain hollow was filled with the pungent smell of blood.</p><p>As time passed, the wind dispersed the odor. In the disheveled hollow, a corpse lay prone in the weeds, lifeless.</p><p>Qin Sang lay in the coffin, wary of his surroundings.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he waited for almost half an hour, but Yu Batian still didn't appear.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly. Could it be that Yu Batian wasn't finished yet and wasn't planning to return today?</p><p>If that were the case, Qin Sang would have to activate his backup plan, but that would require new preparations, wasting too much time.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that the longer he waited, the more variables there would be, and he might not be able to suppress his transformation into a ghoul.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait for another hour. If Yu Batian still didn't appear after an hour, he probably wouldn't come today.  If so, Yu Batian would only have himself to blame for missing this opportunity.</p><p>Trapped and immobile inside the coffin, Qin Sang calmed his mind. After reviewing his plan from start to finish, he began to let his thoughts wander.</p><p>Thinking about what he was doing now, Qin Sang decided that if he encountered such an opportunity again in the future, he would definitely think twice.</p><p>The wind rustled through the trees.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang, inside the coffin, suddenly stirred and instinctively adjusted his position.</p><p>Someone was coming!</p><p>The newcomer was still far away. Qin Sang could only vaguely sense someone using a movement technique, flying in his direction. Whether it was Yu Batian or not, he didn't know yet.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Qin Sang noticed that the person's speed was not fast, seemingly unlike that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He couldn't help but frown.  Could it be that it wasn't Yu Batian?</p><p>Before long, the newcomer finally arrived above the hollow.</p><p>She immediately noticed the unusual scene below.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang heard a gasp of surprise, a woman's voice!</p><p>It really wasn't Yu Batian. Qin Sang's heart sank. He hadn't expected an unexpected turn of events after everything had gone so smoothly.</p><p>With a whoosh, the startled woman blinked and vanished into the forest, concealing herself.</p><p>Qin Sang lay still in the coffin, making no sudden movements.</p><p>His plan had been discovered by an unexpected person, but Qin Sang didn't immediately change his plan. He sensed the aura of the Azure Yang Devilfire from this person.</p><p>The woman was also a disciple of the Azure Yang Devil Sect!</p><p>However, the woman's aura was unfamiliar. Qin Sang had never encountered her in all his years at Azure Yang Market.</p><p>The difference in their cultivation levels was vast.  Although the woman tried her best to conceal her aura, she couldn't hide it from Qin Sang's senses.</p><p>Interestingly, after discovering the unusual scene in the hollow and being greatly surprised, the woman didn't flee but hid in the forest, as if she believed herself concealed, and remained motionless.</p><p>She had clearly noticed the state of the corpse in the hollow.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the woman's cultivation was at the twelfth level of Qi Refining, just a step away from Foundation Establishment.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang suddenly cleared his mind, closed off his divine sense, guarded his inner thoughts, and ignored the outside world.</p><p>At this moment, the coffin was deathly silent, as if it truly contained a refined corpse.</p><p>His plan had been discovered, and changing it would take too long. Since the newcomer was also a disciple of the Azure Yang Devil Sect, he might as well try to make the best of the situation and continue with his plan.</p><p>It all depended on whether the woman had the courage.</p><p>The forest on both sides of the hollow was very quiet, and the chaotic scene at the bottom made it seem somewhat eerie.</p><p>After a while, a figure suddenly emerged from a thicket of trees. It was a young woman.</p><p>The young woman was dressed like a wandering knight-errant, but her expression wasn't sharp. Instead, she appeared somewhat delicate, especially her eyes, which seemed to have just cried, slightly red and swollen. Her clear gaze was even more endearing.</p><p>She carefully parted the leaves, peering down. Her gaze followed the bloodstains in the valley and fixed on the prone corpse.</p><p>The storage pouch at the corpse's waist deeply attracted her attention.</p><p>She bit her lip, a look of struggle and worry appearing on her face. A moment later, she suddenly looked up at where she had come from, and the worry in her eyes was replaced by deep-seated hatred.</p><p>The young woman gritted her teeth and summoned a small sparrow from the forest with a wave of her hand.</p><p>The sparrow landed in her palm, struggled a few times, and then settled down. The young woman extended a finger and tapped the sparrow several times before releasing it.</p><p>The sparrow soared into the sky, flying to the peaks on both sides and circling the area several times before quickly returning.</p><p>Now, the tension on the young woman's face eased slightly. After hesitating for a moment, she suddenly pointed at the sparrow and then at the corpse. The sparrow immediately plummeted at an alarming speed, crashing headfirst into the corpse's head.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The restriction on the sparrow detonated, easily shattering the corpse's head.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the next instant, the young woman darted out from the bushes, rushed to the corpse at top speed, grabbed the storage pouch, and waved her hand, sending out a burst of flames to incinerate the corpse and erase any traces.</p><p>Just as she was about to leave, the young woman suddenly noticed the coffin, unharmed amidst the flames.</p><p>"A Corpse Dao cultivator?"</p><p>The young woman froze, her movements halting.</p><p>For a Corpse Dao cultivator, the most valuable possession was their refined corpse. Now that the owner was dead, this refined corpse was ownerless.</p><p>But if the person was dead, why did the refined corpse in the coffin seem unharmed?</p><p>The young woman frowned, as if she had remembered something. She hurriedly immersed her mind into the storage pouch, easily finding the conspicuous jade slip. The more she read the contents of the jade slip, the more surprised she became. She quickly glanced at the last part and suddenly understood.</p><p>She grabbed the coffin, slung it on her back, completely destroyed all traces in the hollow, and quickly fled.</p><p>The young woman flew towards her sect with all her might, frequently looking back along the way. She didn't truly relax until she reached the vicinity of her sect and found no pursuers.</p><p>She clutched the storage pouch tightly, her eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>From a cursory glance, she had already noticed the countless treasures within the storage pouch, their quality and quantity beyond her imagination.</p><p>She had actually obtained all the belongings of a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p>And there was also the refined corpse, which she considered the most valuable, more so than all the other items in the storage pouch combined.</p><p>Thinking of the refined corpse, the young woman's heart stirred. She suddenly changed direction, flew towards Azure Yang Market, and finally landed in a secluded spot outside the market.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>The young woman let out a soft breath, realizing her heart was still pounding. She crouched down, hugging her knees, then patted her flushed cheeks with both hands before gradually calming down.</p><p>Then, she eagerly took out the jade slip and carefully examined it.</p><p>The secret techniques within the jade slip were beyond her imagination. The young woman couldn't help but wonder if such miraculous corpse refining techniques truly existed.</p><p>She put away the jade slip and looked at the coffin beside her. After hesitating for a moment, she took out two protective talismans for self-defense and opened the coffin from a distance.</p><p>The young woman saw a green-faced, fanged refined corpse lying quietly inside.</p><p>Qin Sang 'saw' the young woman's true appearance and learned her true identity.</p>
