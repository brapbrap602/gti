<h1>Chapter 487: An Unexpected Turn of Events</h1><p>As wisps of Earthly Yin Qi impacted the demon core, its color gradually changed, with a small portion now stained black.  The demon core appeared strange, neither fully demonic nor fully Yin.</p><p>Everything seemed calm. If this stability persisted, once the demon core turned completely black, the Yin Qi infusion would be complete, and the Flying Night Ghast would be successfully refined.</p><p>Unfortunately, things rarely go as planned.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, focusing all his energy on observing every subtle change in the demon core. Yet, he was still caught off guard by the sudden turn of events.</p><p>Without warning, the demonic energy within the core erupted. Before Qin Sang could withdraw the Yin Qi, the energy surged with astonishing speed, colliding violently with the Earthly Yin Qi.</p><p>Caught completely unprepared, Qin Sang desperately channeled his spiritual power, commanding Yu Hua, attempting to salvage the situation.</p><p>However, all his efforts were futile.  He couldn't stop the process.  Soon, Qin Sang felt the demon core begin to tear, on the verge of self-destruction.</p><p>The situation spiraled out of control in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank, his body turning cold.  Logic dictated that his only option was to abandon the process and flee immediately.</p><p>If he couldn't prevent the explosion, the corpse was lost.  Escaping before the detonation would give him a chance to avoid the epicenter and prevent severe injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that even among the disciples of the Heavenly Corpse Sect, only a select few dared to refine a Flying Night Ghast at the Foundation Establishment stage, and even fewer attempted it alone without the aid of masters or companions.</p><p>But how could Qin Sang give up?</p><p>He had invested countless resources into this Flying Night Ghast â€“ the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, the Pseudo Core Realm corpse, and the demon core, each incredibly precious.</p><p>More importantly, failure would drastically alter his subsequent plans.  Without the Flying Night Ghast, he would have to rely solely on two magical treasures with limited durations and a single Heaven's Void Thunder with a restricted area of effect.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the terrifying power of Core Formation cultivators.  Even if Jiupao Daoren remained severely injured, these items might not be enough.</p><p>He refused to accept defeat.</p><p>Magical Treasures!</p><p>Facing the increasingly volatile demon core, Qin Sang remained motionless. Suddenly, his brow flickered, and the Ebony Sword shot out, flying directly into Yu Hua's Qi Sea without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this scenario.  After much deliberation, he realized his only recourse was the power of the Ebony Sword.</p><p>As a magical treasure, the Ebony Sword was comparable to the demon core in rank. However, Qin Sang had no idea how much it could actually help.</p><p>But how could he know without trying?</p><p>Within Yu Hua's Qi Sea, the Ebony Sword silently positioned itself above the demon core.</p><p>The surrounding storm raged, but the Ebony Sword effortlessly pierced its center, locking onto the demon core.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Sword Qi erupted, revealing the full might of the magical treasure.  The sharp Sword Qi sliced through the storm, enveloping the demon core.</p><p>For a moment, the storm surrounding the demon core paused.</p><p>Success!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up with joy. Seizing this hard-won opportunity, he swiftly separated the two forces, and the storm gradually subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Ebony Sword hovering within Yu Hua's Qi Sea, continuing the Yin Qi infusion.</p><p>Whether due to the Ebony Sword or not, the subsequent steps proceeded remarkably smoothly.  Despite a few minor hiccups, he successfully refined the Yin Core.</p><p>As predicted, Yu Hua's internal Yin Qi proved insufficient, depleting halfway through. Fortunately, Qin Sang had chosen the Earth Sinkhole for the refinement, allowing him to replenish the Yin Qi in time and avert disaster.</p><p>The exquisite demon core transformed into a pitch-black sphere, almost painful to behold.</p><p>The Yin Core rotated within Yu Hua, releasing waves of Yin Qi that overwhelmed the existing restrictions. The potent Yin Qi surged through his meridians, even impacting his Nascent Soul, tempering his physical body while accelerating the zombification process.</p><p>Previously, Yu Hua's corpse transformation had been subtle.  Qin Sang's infusion of the Escaping Spirit Technique had masked the corpse Qi, making him appear almost human.</p><p>Now, his skin, including his face, had turned bluish-black, resembling Wushang from the ice cave in Boundless Valley.  This, however, was a minor issue.</p><p>Nearly exhausted, Qin Sang collapsed onto the ground, gazing at Yu Hua with elation.</p><p>A Flying Night Ghast!</p><p>A Flying Night Ghast!</p><p>Finally, it was complete!</p><p>With a Flying Night Ghast at his side, dominating the Foundation Establishment stage was no longer a pipe dream.</p><p>After a brief recovery, Qin Sang eagerly summoned the Flying Night Ghast, examining its Yin Core. The core had fully merged with Yu Hua, beginning its transformation into a Corpse Yin Core.</p><p>As he expected, his soul imprint remained firm. Even as a Flying Night Ghast, Yu Hua remained obedient without a hint of resistance.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, scrutinizing the Flying Night Ghast.  Its transformation aligned perfectly with Wushang's records.</p><p>Throughout the refinement process, Qin Sang gained a deeper understanding of Wushang's "Yin Condensation and Yang Refinement" secret technique.</p><p>Perhaps Wushang's technique truly held some merit.  If half of the Earthly Yin Qi were replaced with Heavenly Yang Qi... both being extraordinary substances born from the world's spiritual essence, perhaps they could harmonize the Yin Qi, preventing it from affecting areas beyond the Yin Core.</p><p>This would prevent the instantaneous and irreversible zombification that Yu Hua experienced.</p><p>The only remaining risk of the "Yin Condensation and Yang Refinement" technique would then be the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>And the Jade Buddha could shatter the Heavenly Corpse Talisman...</p><p>Theoretically, even if Wushang's technique failed, there would be no repercussions for him.</p><p>But everything was conjecture, full of uncertainty. Unless desperate, Qin Sang wouldn't gamble everything on this.</p><p>He still possessed the Kanli Golden Core and the pair of Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, renowned as the most beneficial spiritual herbs for Core Formation. There was no need to force himself down this path now.</p><p>Dismissing these distracting thoughts, Qin Sang observed for a while longer before storing the Flying Night Ghast in his Corpse Puppet Bag.  The Corpse Core transformation would require some time; only then would it be a true Flying Night Ghast.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang set up a simple Spirit Gathering Formation and began to meditate.</p><p>Once his strength was fully restored, Qin Sang immediately left the Earth Sinkhole.  Without even returning to his sect, he mounted the Stygian Cloud and flew northeast.</p><p>Cultivation and corpse refinement had consumed too much time.  He didn't know if Ji Wu had delivered the Returning Restoration Pill yet.</p><p>Qin Sang had to act quickly; delays only increased the chances of unforeseen events.</p><p>However, before confronting Jiupao Daoren, Qin Sang had one more task: to subdue the evil flood dragon's spirit in Boundless Valley and enhance the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>It was crucial to have an escape route in case of unforeseen circumstances.</p>
