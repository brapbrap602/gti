<h1>Chapter 2006: Fengju Jade Gate</h1><p>“Jiannu?”</p><p>After leaving the Fuyu Realm, Qin Sang lost contact with everyone she knew there.  Unexpectedly, the first person she encountered was Jiannu.</p><p>Senior Tianyue had sent Jiannu to wait for her in Baiyu Jing.  She wondered what his instructions were.</p><p>Reconnecting with Senior Tianyue made contacting the First Sword Attendant and the Dao Court much easier, saving her from aimlessly wandering around.</p><p>“This isn't the place for conversation.  Please follow me, Real Person,” Jiannu said, using his body technique to fly towards Baiyu Jing.</p><p>Baiyu Jing had thirty-three levels of heavenly palaces, countless golden halls lining up closely, with higher levels indicating higher status.  King Zhou resided on the highest level, the thirty-third.</p><p>But King Zhou’s death made Qin Sang question his cultivation level. The hierarchy within Baiyu Jing might not follow the common understanding in the cultivation world of strength being the ultimate measure of status.</p><p>“After my master sent me to Baiyu Jing, I cultivated while working my way up. Eventually, I became a member of King Zhou’s Golden Guard and now reside on the twenty-ninth level, always ready at his call,” Jiannu explained, leading Qin Sang towards the lowest level. His current residence was too close to King Zhou's palace, making it unsafe.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed it was an arrangement by Senior Tianyue or the Dao Court. She hadn't expected it to be Jiannu's own doing. Was it that easy to join King Zhou's Golden Guard?</p><p>“The members of King Zhou’s Golden Guard are sent from various factions, and there are regular selections held in the Eight Heavenly States. I earned my place using the swordsmanship my master taught me,” Jiannu explained.</p><p>Jiannu’s cultivation had now reached the peak of the Transcendence Stage, only a step away from the Void Refinement Stage.</p><p>She remembered when they last parted, Jiannu was only at the late Nascent Soul Stage.  His progress in the past five hundred years was truly remarkable – a testament to his hard work.</p><p>Without the opportunities she’d experienced, Qin Sang wasn’t sure if her current cultivation level could match Jiannu’s.</p><p>Although Senior Tianyue and Jiannu were nominally master and servant, their relationship was more like that of teacher and student. To be chosen by Senior Tianyue, Jiannu’s talent must have been exceptional. With a little more refinement, the chances of him breaking through to the Void Refinement Stage were high.</p><p>“The Golden Guard are all spies sent by various factions. King Zhou is truly a puppet,” Qin Sang thought to herself, looking up at King Zhou's palace on the thirty-third level.</p><p>As a member of King Zhou's Golden Guard, Jiannu had free access to Baiyu Jing. He brought Qin Sang to a secluded courtyard, activating the protective barrier and meticulously completing all the required rituals.</p><p>“In this vast universe, meeting an old friend should be a joyous occasion.  Why adhere to these formalities and create distance between us? I doubt Senior Tianyue would interfere with our friendship,” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>“Etiquette cannot be abandoned. I cannot bring shame upon my master,” Jiannu firmly stated.</p><p>Was it this unwavering steadfastness that made him so suitable to be a sword cultivator? Qin Sang sighed and let him be.</p><p>The courtyard wasn’t large. A stone table and stools were placed in the center. The two sat opposite each other.</p><p>After waiting for hundreds of years, a little longer wouldn't matter. They drank tea and talked. Qin Sang wasn't in a rush to ask anything, casually recounting her experiences over the years.</p><p>“I was sent into the Great Thousand World and ended up in the South China Sea, outside the territory of the Great Zhou. Luckily, it was still human territory, and I didn't encounter any danger.  These years have been spent consolidating my cultivation and honing my abilities. I only set out after making my preparations. I didn't expect you to be waiting for me all this time. I apologize for the wait.”</p><p>“During the demon uprising years ago, my master ordered me north to hunt down the demons. I broke through to the Transcendence Stage during this time. My master then brought me into the Great Thousand World, guided me in the Dao of the Sword for a while, and then ordered me to Baiyu Jing…”</p><p>Jiannu didn't have much more to say about his experiences.  Fearing he would miss Qin Sang, he had barely left Baiyu Jing.</p><p>“Where are Senior Tianyue and the Dao Court now?” This was Qin Sang's main concern.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Jiannu shook his head slightly.  “I don't know. My master sent me here and hasn't appeared since.”</p><p>Senior Tianyue seemed more like a disciple of the Sword Pavilion than her master.</p><p>His prolonged absence made her wonder if he was acting on the orders of the First Sword Attendant, planning some grand scheme.</p><p>Qin Sang mused, pressing further, “And there’s no news of the Dao Court? Its return to the Great Thousand World should have spread far and wide by now, right?”</p><p>Baiyu Jing was the heart of humanity, the place with the most up-to-date information in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>“I have indeed heard many rumors that the Dao Court has returned to the Great Thousand World and established the Myriad Dharma Altar, and the Daoist Fuyu lineage has reappeared. However, the location of the Myriad Dharma Altar remains uncertain. Some say it has been obtained by some powerful faction, others that it's outside the Eight Heavenly States, in the Western Buddha lands, or even the territory of the Witch Clan, Demon Clan or other alien races. Some even say it's hidden deep in the ocean or the wildlands… There's no consensus.”</p><p>A flash of unusual color crossed Jiannu’s eyes. He had followed Senior Tianyue in the Fuyu Realm and was himself a Daoist. He knew the Dao Court had returned, yet he didn’t know where his homeland was.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the Dao Court’s secrecy was wise.</p><p>Even if their former enemies who destroyed the Dao Court and brought down the Divine Court were gone, the Divine Court itself was a priceless Fuyu artifact that would surely attract the covetous eyes of powerful figures.</p><p>Now, the Great Thousand World’s human race was ruled peacefully by King Zhou, and the Eight Heavenly States were a place of competing factions.  The situation was definitely different from when the Dao Court was in power.</p><p>Times change, and it may be impossible to unite forces to attack the Daoist Court again.  Some might even become allies.</p><p>Qin Sang isn't high enough in the hierarchy to fully grasp these subtleties. He suspects that a true Mahayana cultivator needs to emerge before the Daoist Court begins to interact with the Greater World.</p><p>Hiding the Daoist Court wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>The Jitian Sect controls the Azure Sky Hollow Realm.  The top powers control countless Lesser Worlds—some with even more perfect and wondrous Heavenly Dao, perhaps even approaching that of the Greater World.</p><p>The Mahayana cultivator slain by Zhang Tianshi and the First Sword Servant likely cultivated in a hidden realm.</p><p>The Daoist Court could establish itself in an ordinary Lesser World, sealing the Dao Mark Gate, and recuperate.  As long as they stay hidden, who could find them?</p><p>It seems we won't see Tianyue and the Daoist Court anytime soon.  Qin Sang rubbed his warm cup, "Senior Tianyue asked you to wait for me here. What's the plan?"</p><p>The Sword Servant spoke solemnly, "Master has ordered that upon meeting you, you are to go to Purple Micro Palace to retrieve the sword!"</p><p>He doesn't know which sword, but Qin Sang does.</p><p>A fragment of the Earth-Slaying Sword!</p><p>The Purple Micro Sword Scripture!</p><p>Qin Sang sat up straight, his voice low, "Senior has found Purple Micro Palace?"</p><p>The fragment of the Earth-Slaying Sword is hidden in one of the fourteen sword pavilions of Purple Micro Palace. To obtain it, you must first find the Palace.  After being summoned from the Storm World to the Upper Realm, its location became unknown. Qin Sang had planned to wait until settling in Baiyu City to search for it more easily.</p><p>The Sword Servant nodded slightly, lowering his voice instinctively as he explained, allowing Qin Sang to understand the full story.</p><p>As suspected, someone in the Greater World summoned Purple Micro Palace, causing it to break through dimensional barriers and ascend.  The First Sword Servant, while crossing the River of Calamity, sensed the disturbance.  Unable to prevent it, he could only hastily intervene, stopping its return to the Greater World. He forced it into an Ancient Battlefield, using the residual energy from past battles of powerful cultivators there to conceal it and disrupt the plan to reclaim the Palace.</p><p>However, the First Sword Servant was affected by the Six Heavens' ancient Qi, and the spatial distortions of the River of Calamity meant the exact location of Purple Micro Palace within the Ancient Battlefield remained uncertain.  Senior Tianyue searched the Greater World before pinpointing its location.</p><p>"Where is this Ancient Battlefield?"</p><p>Qin Sang is very familiar with Ancient Battlefields—there are some in the Storm World, the Talisman World, and the Greater World.</p><p>"Master has confirmed its location: West of Duizhou, at Fengju Yumen!" said the Sword Servant.</p><p>Duizhou is one of the Eight Great Heavenly States, supposedly northwest of Baiyu City.</p><p>Fengju Yumen—a unique name, unheard of by Qin Sang.</p><p>"Fengju Yumen was once the sacred mountain of the ancient Wu tribe. They believed it to be where the sun and moon entered.  After the great war of the ancient tribes, the sacred mountain collapsed, becoming an Ancient Battlefield.  Within these battlefields, the powers of ancient cultivators remain, alongside shattered hidden realms and Lesser Worlds, with chaotic Heavenly Dao. They remain the most dangerous places in the Greater World," explained the Sword Servant.</p><p>"Since Master confirmed Purple Micro Palace's location at Fengju Yumen, some forces have become aware. The area is teeming with hidden activity, and some fragments have already been unearthed."</p><p>"The true Purple Micro Palace hasn't appeared yet, but relentless searches will inevitably expose it."</p><p>"Master dares not act rashly; doing so would immediately attract powerful cultivators, leaving no chance to retrieve the spirit sword."</p><p>"Only you can sense the spirit sword's location. Master will personally go to Fengju Yumen, using Purple Micro Palace to draw attention.  You will secretly retrieve the sword and immediately flee, without hesitation. At the right time, Master will meet you."</p><p>"Hiss!" Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>Senior Tianyue is diverting all attention to him, allowing himself to remain hidden.</p><p>Purple Micro Palace has become an enemy to all, and the First Sword Servant is in seclusion recovering.</p><p>From now on, Senior Tianyue will be embroiled in a life-or-death struggle, facing the Greater World alone with his sword!</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't know the true extent of the situation, but he must support Senior Tianyue's actions.</p><p>Although Senior Tianyue values the Earth-Slaying Sword and Qin Sang's status as the supposed heir of the Purple Micro Sword Venerable, Qin Sang cannot deny he is the biggest beneficiary.  The price is Senior Tianyue's life being at risk.</p><p>The First Sword Servant needs to remain hidden. What dangers await a mere Unity Stage cultivator like him? Can he truly succeed?</p><p>After a long silence, Qin Sang sighed inwardly and asked, "Will you accompany me?"</p><p>"Having found you, I must inform Master. I don't know how Master will arrange my tasks."</p><p>Jian Nu said, "Master's arrival is perfectly timed.  The Zhou King's death has caused a massive upheaval within the human race, drawing the attention of various factions and even other races.  Discussions on the Zhou King's lifespan will begin soon, easing the pressure on Fengju Yumen."</p><p>Qin Sang realized, "No wonder there was no reaction from Genzhou when the Zhou King died months ago.  It was kept secret; they were limiting his lifespan all along?"</p><p>Jian Nu nodded. "Since the Jade Emperor, successive Zhou Kings have been unable to surpass the Transcendence stage, thus limiting their lifespans. Legend says powerful beings agreed on this rule, stating that the Zhou King, having enjoyed all earthly glory, should not claim more years. Now, rumors are rampant in Baiyu City;  the next Zhou King remains unchosen, and factions are debating whether to break or relax this restriction."</p><p>Breaking the lifespan limit—if a supremely talented Zhou King were to emerge, reaching the Unity or even the Great Vehicle stage, wouldn't they become a living Jade Emperor, a true sovereign?</p><p>How could others accept that?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't understand why this was even a debate.</p><p>Then, a thought struck Qin Sang.  "The Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle dispute?"</p><p>The Great Vehicle cultivates enlightenment, whether through divine, kingly, or saintly paths; wielding royal authority undoubtedly makes it easier.</p><p>The Zhou King holds the moral high ground, irreplaceable.</p><p>In the immortal cultivation world, it's difficult to build momentum in just two or three thousand years.  Elevating a true Zhou King, using their authority to enact reforms and unify the land—all humans obeying their laws—would greatly benefit the pursuit of the Great Vehicle path.</p><p>This is a battle for the Dao!</p><p>Knowing this, the opposing sides become clear.</p><p>Even though Ziwei Palace is the domain of the Ziwei Sword Venerable, in the eyes of some powerful beings, it's likely less important than this Dao dispute.</p><p>Jian Nu nodded, "The debate has existed for a long time, but the Zhou King's death brought it to a head."</p><p>"Those carefree Great Vehicle cultivators and major sects certainly won't stand idly by…"</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt a profound sense of witnessing a cosmic shift, of being swept up in the current of history.</p><p>This debate isn't confined to humanity; it concerns the path of enlightenment for all beings in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Centuries later, the Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle dispute will be indelibly recorded in the history of the Great Thousand World, much like the earth-shattering events of the ancient era.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of excitement but also understood the danger—it might be the beginning of a great war. "Friend Daoist, you've surely seen many texts in Yu Jing Mountain. How much do you know about ancient history?"</p><p>He knew that only by understanding the history of the Great Thousand World could he unravel the truth and determine his own stance.  Otherwise, he'd remain ignorant and manipulated.</p><p>Unfortunately, after so many years, history has become hazy and even altered.  Available texts are full of legends and unreliable.  True ancient texts are only held by ancient lineages, top sects, and powerful clans, rarely shown to outsiders.</p><p>"Even the Zhou King's guards have limited access to ancient texts.  When my master discusses history, I've overheard some things.</p><p>"In ancient times, countless races existed, and humans were just one.</p><p>"After the rise of humanity, considering themselves the superior species, most other races were labeled as demons.</p><p>"But in ancient times, demons thrived under the rule of the Ancient Demon Court. The Witches secretly plotted.  Extra-dimensional demons breached the barriers and invaded…</p><p>"In the height of chaos, the Jade Emperor led humanity to shatter the Demon Court, subdue the Witches, expel the foreign demons, and seal the dimensional barriers.  The ancient battlefield of Fengju Yumen is a remnant of that time, with the Witches banished beyond it, unable to cross.</p><p>"Legend says the Jade Emperor wanted to establish a Heavenly Court of Humanity. No one knows exactly what happened then, only that Baiyu City and the Eight Great Heavenly States remain.  The dimensional barriers weren't completely sealed, setting the stage for future conflicts.</p><p>"Humanity seems prosperous, but foreign races lurk, and the Great Vehicle and Small Vehicle factions clash endlessly.  The Buddhist Western Lands stand independently. The Eight Great Heavenly States and various Daoist traditions are each self-governing. Extra-dimensional demons covet the Great Thousand World; dangers abound…"</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>This volume is entering its final arc.  I'll take a day's break to organize the outline.</p>
