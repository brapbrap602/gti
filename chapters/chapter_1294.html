<h1>Chapter 1286: Seeing Through</h1><p>The clay figure's strike missed.  Qin Sang realized these clay figures were different from the previous ones; they seemed to be some kind of sword puppets.</p><p>Autumn芷 (Autumn Zhi) let out a soft exclamation, somewhat surprised by Qin Sang's quick reaction.  However, the carefully planned attack she had set wasn't so easily avoided.  She immediately executed a strange sword technique, and the four clay figures shattered, transforming into thousands of swords!</p><p>At that moment, Autumn芷 felt a terrifying aura appear above her.  Her brows furrowed, a warning flaring in her heart.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A deafening thunderclap echoed.  It was Qin Sang's *Thunder Control Technique*.</p><p>Autumn芷 remembered Qin Sang possessed a powerful thunder magic and, not daring to be careless, glared at him resentfully before changing her incantation. The clay figures around her flew towards her head.</p><p>*Crack crack…*</p><p>In an instant, the clay figures merged, forming a thick stone wall.</p><p>The next moment, thunder descended from the heavens, striking the stone wall.  A tremendous boom echoed, the wall violently shaking. Cracks spread across its surface, and stones rained down.  The wall then split open, and the remaining lightning relentlessly pierced through, only to strike empty space.</p><p>Autumn芷's figure appeared a hundred meters away, unharmed but slightly disheveled from her hasty evasion. She recalled her clay figures, discovering several were completely shattered beyond repair.</p><p>In her heart, her assessment of Qin Sang rose another level.  Swordsmanship, thunder magic, and escape techniques—all threatened her. This person wasn't a cultivator who relied solely on external objects.  Without the demonic fire, his strength was still among the top in the Northern Star Realm.</p><p>The brief clash was extremely dangerous. Autumn芷 was forced to defend herself, and Qin Sang took the opportunity to escape the danger.</p><p>But he didn't stop. Taking advantage of the damage to Autumn芷's clay figures, he immediately used his ebony sword to attack again.  Then, with a flash of lightning, he lunged at Autumn芷.</p><p>Autumn芷 realized the danger. Her sneak attack had failed, and Qin Sang had seized the initiative. She hurriedly urged her Xuanhuang giant sword, retreating while summoning more clay figures to block Qin Sang.</p><p>In mid-air, the two flying swords intertwined, forming a chaotic ball of light, indistinguishable except for the constant clang of metal.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang, using only his fists, knocked several damaged clay figures away, rapidly closing the distance.</p><p>Autumn芷's face changed.  No wonder this person could disguise himself as a demon king without being discovered; his physical body was truly as strong as a demon beast!</p><p>Autumn芷 suddenly flung her arms, two white sleeves shooting out like agile white snakes—they were also magical artifacts.</p><p>At that moment, a blush suddenly appeared on Autumn芷's face. She angrily shouted, "Shameless!"</p><p>She hurriedly covered her face with her sleeves, retreating further and throwing out a green jade.</p><p>As the jade appeared, a suction force emanated, and something in the air was instantly absorbed by the jade, which then turned gray and lost its power.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>The jade fell to the ground, shattering into several pieces, becoming ordinary stones.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly felt regret. His advance was a feint. Autumn芷 had only lost one move and was far from exhausted, still holding back many cards and treasures.</p><p>Even with his enhanced physical strength, it had its limits, and Qin Sang didn't want to take a magical artifact's blow directly.</p><p>His true killing moves were the aphrodisiac poison and the following demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang, after obtaining the deceased Yue Sanren's belongings, discovered that the folding fan was Yue Sanren's life-bound treasure, which he couldn't currently use, but he could extract the aphrodisiac poison within.</p><p>This poison was painstakingly refined by Yue Sanren, colorless and odorless, making it extremely difficult to defend against.  Unfortunately, Yue Sanren died too quickly, and the poison proved no match for the demonic fire, failing to affect Qin Sang.</p><p>To deal with Autumn芷, Qin Sang used all of the poison secretly.  However, Autumn芷 possessed a poison-countering treasure, rendering it ineffective.</p><p>Autumn芷 quickly suppressed the blush on her face, clenching her teeth. Although uninjured, she was filled with shame and anger.  She attacked again with her sleeves.</p><p>To her surprise, Qin Sang, who clearly had the upper hand, suddenly sheathed his sword and retreated. Before she could react, he had already fled a considerable distance.</p><p>On the battlefield, a cowardly retreat!</p><p>Autumn芷 (Qiuzhi) was startled. Qin Sang's actions were too strange. She suspected a trap, but still locked onto him with her spiritual sense, preparing to pursue.</p><p>At that moment, the water in the distance suddenly churned, and two figures emerged, one on each side.  Looking in the direction of Qin Sang's escape, they coldly snorted, "That kid got away fast!"</p><p>"Daoist Shan! Daoist Song! When did you arrive?"</p><p>Autumn芷's face was filled with surprise. She stopped, a mix of shock and joy.</p><p>These two were renowned experts from the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>The Shan cultivator's cultivation was only slightly weaker than Autumn芷's.</p><p>The Song cultivator was a level lower, but his mastery of the Ethereal Wood Divine Blade was unparalleled, allowing him to challenge opponents beyond his level.  He had been absent from the Blood Pool Battle, assisting Jiang Chenzi and others in controlling the Flag Gate Array.</p><p>These two weren't originally at Double Mirror Mountain; they had been dispatched as reinforcements.</p><p>They had approached stealthily, intending to ambush Qin Sang, and to avoid detection, hadn't contacted Autumn芷.</p><p>Even Autumn芷 hadn't noticed them, yet Qin Sang had.</p><p>Qin Sang's sudden retreat caught them off guard, forcing them to abandon the pursuit.</p><p>Song cultivator gazed at the direction Qin Sang disappeared, saying calmly, "He didn't even use the Demon Fire Banner, clearly reserving his strength. Even if we surrounded him, we might not be able to stop him."</p><p>Autumn芷 recalled her Xuanhuang Giant Sword, adding, "This person's spiritual perception is far sharper than ordinary people. I hid a sword puppet underground, and he still found it. Elder Ye said he's proficient in formations, but I don't think so.  He must possess some powerful detection method, perhaps a secret spiritual sense technique, or some kind of spiritual sight…"</p><p>"Your sword puppet was disguised as a rock, inanimate and without any fluctuations, and he still detected it?"</p><p>Daoist Shan was startled. "You're always so perceptive of others, Autumn芷. It seems we need to guard against this from now on."</p><p>Pausing, Daoist Shan sighed, "What a tenacious fellow!"</p><p>"Indeed, he's difficult to deal with. Not only are his Dao techniques and magical treasures top-notch, but his physical strength is also unprecedented. He's mastered some kind of body refinement technique…"</p><p>Autumn芷 revealed her further observations, essentially laying bare Qin Sang's capabilities.</p><p>Humans lack the powerful bloodlines of the demons. In this age, the path of body refinement is incredibly difficult.</p><p>Shan and Song felt helpless, wondering how such a monster could emerge from Little Cold Region.</p><p>After a brief exchange:</p><p>Autumn芷 said lightly, "With the two of you, Double Mirror Mountain is safe. I'll return to oversee the array. Please remain here, targeting the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Two-Region Alliance, and seize opportunities to breach the Xunfeng Array!"</p><p>The two exchanged glances, then stopped Autumn芷.  "You don't know, Elder Ye and Senior Cang Hong have ordered a retreat. We're here to assist you in evacuating Double Mirror Mountain!"</p>
