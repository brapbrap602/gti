<h1>Chapter 803:  Celestial Demon Dharma Image</h1><p>This alchemist, though a Core Formation cultivator, had snow-white hair and an aged appearance.</p><p>His demeanor was extraordinary, leaving a lasting impression.</p><p>Observing the attendant's respectful manner, it was clear the alchemist held a high position within the auction house.</p><p>“Senior, this is Alchemist Yi.”</p><p>The attendant offered the introduction, then wisely closed the door and left.</p><p>“Alchemist Yi…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, a look of surprise crossing his face. He immediately rose and greeted the alchemist warmly, “To have disturbed Daoist Yi, I am truly honored!”</p><p>He had previously learned that Alchemist Yi was one of the renowned alchemists at the Xiang'an Auction House.</p><p>Seeing the man, Qin Sang couldn't help but mutter to himself, *Could this spirit fruit be something exceptionally rare, enough to alarm him?*  But his expression remained unchanged.</p><p>The two exchanged pleasantries and sat down.</p><p>“Daoist Qin, may I examine the jade slip?”</p><p>Alchemist Yi pointed to the jade slip.  Receiving Qin Sang's permission, he carefully examined it.</p><p>After a while, Alchemist Yi opened his eyes.  Noticing Qin Sang's curious gaze, he smiled faintly.  “The attendant described the spirit fruit you seek, and I found the characteristics quite unusual. It's a type I've never encountered, so I came to take a look.”</p><p>Qin Sang asked anxiously, “Daoist Yi, have you any leads?”</p><p>Alchemist Yi frowned thoughtfully for a moment, then asked, “Daoist Qin, are these two images all you have?  Truly no other information at all?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained firm on this point.</p><p>Alchemist Yi said, “To be frank, Daoist Qin, the images seem somewhat familiar. I may have seen it somewhere before, but it was so long ago, I can’t recall. Furthermore, this spirit fruit might be something I saw in ancient妖族 texts during my alchemy studies. Perhaps you could come back later; I’ll look into it when I return.”</p><p>“妖族?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Even a renowned human alchemist didn't recognize it, and he needed to consult妖族 texts?  Could this spirit fruit only be used by demonic beasts?</p><p>If so, all his efforts would be in vain.</p><p>“Then I'll trouble Daoist Yi. A small token of my appreciation.”</p><p>Qin Sang produced a small pouch of spirit stones as payment.</p><p>Alchemist Yi accepted them without hesitation.</p><p>Afterwards, the two chatted amiably. Qin Sang seized the opportunity to express his desire to learn妖文, seeking guidance from Alchemist Yi.</p><p>“I'm somewhat accomplished in the art of refinement. I hear that Tianxing City possesses妖族 texts plundered from the Demon Sea. They contain information on refinement, quite different from human methods, but with noteworthy aspects. I lack the knowledge to fully understand the subtleties, feeling like I'm in a fog. I wish to seek a master's guidance…”</p><p>He sensed Alchemist Yi's deep understanding of妖文, hence his request.</p><p>As a human cultivating妖族 techniques, he dared not rashly attempt anything before fully comprehending the *Celestial Demon Transformation*.</p><p>Upon hearing this, and learning that Qin Sang was a solitary cultivator, Alchemist Yi looked at him with new respect.  “Daoist Qin, at such a young age, you possess such high cultivation and are also skilled in refinement! I admire you! Forget about the talk of apprenticeship. I enjoy making friends. This妖文 is nothing special. Take this jade slip; it contains not only my insights but also the understanding of妖文 from fellow daoists at the auction house over the years. It’s sufficient for you to understand the ancient texts.”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and offered payment, but it was refused.</p><p>“This is just to build good karma, to make friends with a promising fellow daoist like yourself.  To be frank, among our auction house colleagues, each has a jade slip like this. It's not a big secret.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't insist and accepted the jade slip.  He reciprocated by purchasing a large amount of spirit materials and entrusting some demonic cores and other items to the auction house.</p><p>These materials were mostly for constructing spirit formations and refining the Ten Directions Yama Banner’s pole.</p><p>The spirit formation was complex, requiring numerous materials.</p><p>Xiang'an Auction House was wealthy, and the attendant, after receiving the order, soon returned with a spatial pouch containing seven or eight tenths of the materials. They promised to help find the rest.</p><p>Money talks.</p><p>With such a large order, the auction house became even more enthusiastic.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang requested high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>This posed a challenge to Alchemist Yi. “Daoist Qin, you should understand that high-grade and top-grade spirit stones have special uses. For instance, the protective formations of major sects require high-grade spirit stones to activate, their value exceeding their simple monetary worth.  In recent years, the amount of high-grade spirit stones mined has been dwindling, controlled by powerful forces, rarely falling into individual hands.”</p><p>Two clans have only recently established themselves in the Yao Sea and lack the resources to extensively search for spirit stones.  Therefore, high-quality spirit stones are increasingly scarce and their value has skyrocketed.  The associate said, "You can only wait for an opportunity. If someone is willing to sell, we will contact you."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. High-quality spirit stones are considered strategic resources by major factions, and the Xiang'an Auction House, backed by the three major trading alliances, is no exception.</p><p>The Canglang Sea is becoming more unstable, making high-quality spirit stones even more sought after. However, he only needs a few, so it shouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>Late into the night, Qin Sang finally left the auction, having made quite a few acquisitions at a considerable cost.</p><p>After leaving the auction house, Qin Sang didn't delay. He immediately returned to study the demon script.</p><p>Back in his cave dwelling, Qin Sang sealed the spirit formation, took out the jade slip, and shut out the world.</p><p>The jade slip's contents were far more detailed than what he had learned before, providing a deeper explanation of the demon script.  It was clearly meticulously researched by the auction house's experts.  Qin Sang carefully studied the "Heavenly Demon Transformation" technique using the jade slip as a guide.</p><p>With the jade slip's guidance, he finally fully understood the cultivation technique.</p><p>The first half of the technique is divided into four layers, with the latter parts shrouded in mystery. Qin Sang was certain that his insufficient cultivation was the reason he couldn't see beyond the fog.</p><p>He focused on the body refinement section.</p><p>The technique claims that it will ultimately forge a Heavenly Demon body, making body refinement its core.</p><p>In the first four layers, during normal cultivation, one only needs to draw upon the power of the celestial stars to gradually refine the body.  However, each breakthrough requires a process called Star Yuan Infusion.</p><p>Star Yuan Infusion involves drawing an immensely concentrated amount of celestial star power and instantly pouring it into the body to achieve a breakthrough. This process is inherently risky.</p><p>There's a reason why "Heavenly Demon Transformation" is considered a top-tier cultivation technique.</p><p>After reaching a certain level in the first three layers, one can cultivate a divine ability called Heavenly Demon Transformation, which greatly enhances combat strength.  The technique doesn't detail its effects; one only knows its power after cultivation.</p><p>Upon successfully breaking through to the fourth layer, one can unlock the Heavenly Demon Dharma Form.  It's said that this is the true entry point to the technique, and the Heavenly Demon Dharma Form grants access to some of the Heavenly Demon's divine abilities!</p><p>Legend has it that Heavenly Demons are comparable to Mahayana cultivators, only a step away from ascension.</p><p>Even a fraction of a Heavenly Demon's divine abilities would be terrifying. Qin Sang couldn't help but wonder if the technique exaggerated the effects of the Heavenly Demon Dharma Form.</p>
