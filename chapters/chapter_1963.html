<h1>Chapter 1954: Planning</h1><p>Faced with this problem, Qin Sang gave the same answer.</p><p>"I treat all who seek consultation at the temple equally."</p><p>Yin Heqian's expression softened slightly. He thanked Qin Sang and instructed someone to bring in the others.</p><p>The Yin family members entered one after another, lining up according to the severity of their symptoms.</p><p>The most severely injured was a young man. His body was rigid, his eyes a greyish-white. He was carried before Qin Sang, his eyes vacant, his expression dull.  If it weren't for the faint trace of breath, he would have been mistaken for a corpse.</p><p>Yin Heqian stood beside, watching Qin Sang examine the young man, and explained the situation in a low voice: "Last night, a branch of the Yin family sent a message reporting that a highly talented young member had suddenly disappeared – this is him…"</p><p>He pointed at the young man and continued, "That branch sent people to search, but to no avail. My daughter also led a search party. They found traces in a mountain cave.  Upon receiving the urgent message, I sensed something was wrong. When I arrived, my daughter and her party were investigating the cave, and then the accident happened. Initially, I thought they were poisoned and tried various elixirs, but none worked. This greyish-white aura initially latches onto the forehead. My daughter also unfortunately contracted it…"</p><p>Yin Heqian looked at his daughter.</p><p>Yin Qiao'er stepped forward. Her appearance hadn't changed much, but she seemed much calmer than she had been in Jinen County. She bowed to Qin Sang and described her experience.</p><p>At the initial stage of infection, there was only a faint grey aura on her forehead, with no significant symptoms.  The symptoms would suddenly erupt after some time.</p><p>The onset varied from person to person, possibly related to the degree of infection.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang stood up and looked directly into the young man's eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the young man's eyes slowly rolled, his pupils dilated, and he stared fixedly at Qin Sang, his mouth slightly open.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The young man suddenly screamed, startling everyone.</p><p>The shriek was even more terrifying than the most anguished cry, like the wail of a vengeful spirit. He thrashed his head violently, and the two people supporting him had to restrain him, nearly losing their grip.</p><p>The sudden change chilled everyone to the bone, especially the other affected Yin family members, who looked terrified, fearing a similar fate.</p><p>However, a gleam of joy flashed in Yin Heqian's eyes. He saw that the young man's change was related to Qin Sang's actions – something he hadn't been able to achieve himself.</p><p>This desperate plea for help seemed to be bearing fruit.</p><p>Yin Heqian knew that even taking these people back to the Yin family would hardly uncover the root cause; he had to seek outside help.</p><p>He had befriended several masters of alchemy.</p><p>But the greyish-white aura spread too quickly.  He feared that before he could summon help, including his daughter, they would all succumb to the illness.</p><p>In his anxiety, he remembered Qingfeng Daozhang of the Green Sheep Temple and rushed here to seek his assistance.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang extended a finger, using his powers to restrain the young man and touched his forehead.</p><p>Everyone subconsciously held their breath.  They saw Qin Sang gently press his finger, then slowly withdraw his hand.</p><p>With his movement, a greyish-white orb emerged from the young man's forehead.</p><p>As the orb appeared, the young man's expression became incredibly grotesque and terrifying. His eyes widened, and blood tears flowed from the corners of his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved, continuing his incantation.</p><p>The orb was gradually drawn from the young man's body. Countless white threads appeared on his face, one end connected to the orb and the other rooted within the young man's body.</p><p>Finally, the orb was completely separated, and the threads were pulled out. It was as if a hideous mask had been ripped from the young man's face.</p><p>In an instant, the young man calmed down, his head tilted to one side, and he fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>His breathing was still weak, his vitality severely depleted, but his skin gradually regained some color.</p><p>"What is this thing?"</p><p>Yin Heqian looked at the orb in Qin Sang's hand, his face full of confusion.</p><p>Even after being removed, the orb remained restless, with distorted human faces occasionally appearing on its surface, shrieking at Qin Sang like the most ferocious demons.</p><p>"It's a malevolent spirit,"</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yin Heqian was astonished. He hadn't expected that something that had left him helpless was merely a malevolent spirit.</p><p>Malevolent spirits can be considered a type of ghost, born in places of darkness, but this one was clearly unusual, unlike anything he had ever encountered before, since malevolent spirits themselves come in countless bizarre forms and possess diverse abilities.</p><p>"This thing is extremely vicious. It can parasitize deep within the soul, merging with its host's soul. After devouring its host completely, it might leave to find a new host or usurp the host's body, disguising itself as the host and continuing to live. Even close relatives may not notice.  However, if you know its nature, it's not difficult to deal with."</p><p>Qin Sang observed and analyzed, "Such ferocious malevolent spirits are rare in the world.  Only places of great calamity could give birth to such beings."</p><p>"A place of great calamity? Father, could it be an ancient battlefield?"  Yin Qiao'er interjected.</p><p>Yin Heqian nodded slightly.  "Correct. The location of that cave, though now deserted, has been a contested site throughout numerous dynastic changes before the establishment of the Yan Kingdom. Countless corpses are buried beneath the ground. However, there have been no abnormalities before. The sudden emergence of such strange evil spirits...could there be another reason?"</p><p>"We'll know after an investigation," Qin Sang said calmly.  He clasped his hands, confining the malevolent spirit into a small orb, and tossed it to Yin Heqian.</p><p>Yin Heqian caught the orb, hesitating. He wanted to ask Qin Sang to investigate, but seeing Qin Sang's apparent lack of interest, he swallowed his words.</p><p>"Removing the malevolent spirits will only leave them severely weakened, not fatally harmed.  Medicinal treatment to cleanse the Yin energy will restore their vitality," Qin Sang said, moving to the second person.</p><p>"Please, Daoist Master, refine some pills for them," Yin Heqian quickly said, worried about making a mistake himself.</p><p>Qin Sang then proceeded to remove the malevolent spirits from everyone.</p><p>Relieved to have survived, their expressions were no longer as grave.</p><p>Yin Qiaoer, regaining some of her vivacity, walked to the other side of the altar. "This is young Daoist Master Yulang, isn't it? You've changed so much, I almost didn't recognize you. Truly a prodigy. In just a few years, you've become a Foundation Establishment expert!"</p><p>Yulang expressed his humility.</p><p>Yin Qiaoer's eyes twinkled as she looked at the young man surnamed Shi. "And this Daoist friend?"</p><p>"My surname is Shi."</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi took the elixir, immediately suppressing the poison in his body, his complexion returning to normal.</p><p>"Daoist Shi, you're not a cultivator from near the Yan Kingdom, are you? Otherwise, someone as talented as you, I would surely recognize,"</p><p>Yin Heqian also approached.</p><p>Even facing the head of the clan and a Yuan Ying Grandmaster, the young man surnamed Shi remained composed.  "I was saved by the Daoist Master before he took charge of Qingyang Temple."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Yin Heqian's eyes gleamed, his expression growing warmer.  "A friend of the Daoist Master! My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>Qin Sang's origins were mysterious.  Yin Heqian had tried several times to visit him but couldn't find a reason.</p><p>After today's events, Yin Heqian respected Qin Sang even more, but he dared not be too abrupt, unsure of Qin Sang's preferences.</p><p>As a second best option, befriending this young man surnamed Shi might be a breakthrough.</p><p>The young man surnamed Shi secretly glanced at Qin Sang. Seeing no reaction, he didn't mind using Qin Sang's reputation, and softly coughed.  "I'm just someone seeking medicine.  It's perfectly normal that Patriarch Yin doesn't recognize me. However, I've long heard of your illustrious reputation and admired you greatly."</p><p>"Don't mention reputation in front of the Daoist Master, it's only laughable!"</p><p>Yin Heqian laughed heartily.</p><p>"Indeed, a large tree attracts the wind; it's not necessarily a good thing," the young man surnamed Shi echoed.</p><p>Yin Heqian's smile suddenly vanished as he scrutinized the young man. "Daoist Shi, you seem to have hidden meaning in your words?"</p><p>"Patriarch Yin thinks too much. I was merely speaking from my heart.  Worldly schemes are endless.  Patriarch Yin bears the responsibility of the family's rise and fall.  It's much easier to be a carefree hermit like myself," the young man shook his head and turned to his companions. "Xiao Wu, Yulang, it's getting late. I should be going."</p><p>"Brother Shi, be careful on your journey."</p><p>Yulang quickly escorted the young man out of the temple.</p><p>Their close relationship was observed by Yin Heqian.  Recalling the young man's words, Yin Heqian looked at his family members who had been afflicted by the malevolent spirits, his eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p>Yin Qiaoer, standing behind him, watched the young man leave, thoughtful, a hint of doubt in her eyes.</p><p>Soon, all the Yin family members were freed from the malevolent spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his seat, picking up a brush.  "Patriarch Yin, will you pay now or later?"</p><p>After clarifying the amount, Yin Heqian's mouth twitched.  "Please, Daoist Master, give me a day's grace. I will send the spirit stones tomorrow!"</p><p>...</p><p>In the underground chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation, motionless for a long time.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted. He waved his sleeve, opening the barrier. "Come in."</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Two figures darted into the chamber, bowing respectfully. It was Taiyi and Luo Hou.</p><p>The two demons had gone to find the sub-altars and had returned safely.</p><p>Taiyi presented a jade slip.  "Master, this is the location of all the thunder altars!"</p><p>The contents of the jade slip revealed a formation diagram.</p><p>Qin Sang's analysis of the array diagram showed slight discrepancies, but nothing significant.  The two demons' task was to correct these minor errors.</p><p>This diagram also included detailed topographical information, representing years of painstaking work by the demons.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely.  The diagram showed a total of sixty-four sub-altars, corresponding to the eight trigrams, but their arrangement didn't follow the usual trigram pattern.</p><p>The entire array extended from the edge of Yun Du Mountain in the east to the foot of Mu Luo Mountain in the west, overlooking the Fire Domain to the north and bordering the waters to the south.</p><p>Coincidentally, its layout largely matched the areas inhabited by ordinary people.</p><p>When Qin Sang projected the sub-altar array onto the main altar, an immediate connection was established; the array was accurate.</p><p>Including the main altar, all sixty-five thunder altars had been located.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly began to study the array. With the diagram as a reference, the process went smoothly, but he soon encountered a new obstacle. He realized that to truly repair the main altar, he had to restore the entire array!</p><p>He worked simultaneously on understanding the main altar and restoring the sub-altars, a process that complemented both tasks.</p><p>Perhaps "reconstruction" was a more accurate term.</p><p>Of the sixty-four sub-altars, only two, besides the three he'd already repaired, remained relatively intact.  Most had vanished, leaving no trace.</p><p>Time was one issue, but the resources required to rebuild fifty-nine sub-altars would be astronomical.</p><p>Even Qin Sang found this daunting.</p><p>Fortunately, the main altar's structure was still largely intact and only required repair, not reconstruction. Otherwise, Qin Sang wouldn't even dare imagine the task; even emptying the treasury of Yun Du wouldn't suffice.</p><p>After sending the demons to rest, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.  Having come this far, restoring the array was imperative. He had to go to Yun Du Mountain himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Upon receiving the news, Qin Sang immediately left seclusion and flew to Yun Ding City, where he successfully met with the city lord.</p><p>Explaining his purpose, Qin Sang presented a jade slip listing various spiritual materials.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang only included a portion of the requirements, the city lord's brow furrowed.</p><p>"Is there a problem, City Lord?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Setting down the jade slip, the city lord hesitated.  "Daoist, while the materials you've listed aren't exceptionally rare, they are still quite valuable, and the quantities are substantial…"</p><p>Daoist sects often construct dozens or even hundreds of altars, but except for the main altar, they rarely use extremely rare materials.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to gather everything at once. "There's no need to rush. How much can you provide now?"</p><p>The city lord shook his head. "If it were some time ago, I could have gathered more for you, but now it's extremely difficult."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed. "Has something changed?"</p><p>The city lord vaguely replied, "Times have changed. Spiritual materials and herbs are now scarce in Yun Du Mountain.  Unless you're willing to pay several times the usual price."</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes lit up.  "I recall you're a skilled refiner, Daoist?"</p><p>"Indeed."  Qin Sang didn't need to be modest.</p><p>"Could you refine spiritual treasures?" the city lord pressed.</p><p>"City Lord, you should understand that spiritual treasures can't be created overnight. Refining one would require immense time and effort," Qin Sang cautioned.</p><p>"It's fine.  Refining magical artifacts to the level of pseudo-spiritual treasures will suffice. As long as you're willing to work, we'll take however many you can produce.  Your compensation will be generous!"</p><p>The city lord tapped the jade slip.  "These materials are also negotiable!"</p><p>Even without explicitly stating it, Qin Sang guessed that this generous offer was from Yun Du Tian!</p><p>Given Yun Du Mountain's resources, the sect's Nascent Soul cultivators certainly wouldn't lack pseudo-spiritual treasures.</p><p>The demand for more pseudo-spiritual treasures, however many could be made, suggested either their consumption or preparation for Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>The undercurrents in the Fire Domain were clearly visible to Qin Sang.</p><p>He examined the bronze pillar repeatedly, but found nothing remarkable.</p><p>Yet, this object proved invaluable, attracting not only the interest of the Falling Soul Abyss, but also drawing a large-scale response from Yun Du Tian.</p><p>Dispatching Nascent Soul cultivators into the Fire Domain wasn't enough; they were preparing to send Yuan Ying cultivators. Were the two powers on the verge of all-out war?</p><p>What a chance to assess their strength!  Qin Sang mused.</p><p>This was beneficial to him as well. The opportunity would accelerate the construction of the sub-altars.</p><p>However, he would need to dedicate some time to refining.</p><p>Refining pseudo-spiritual treasures was less complex than creating true ones.  The city lord had implied that both artifacts and materials would be provided, and the focus wouldn't be on artistry, only surpassing the power of ordinary artifacts.</p><p>In duels between Yuan Ying cultivators, a pseudo-spiritual treasure would grant a significant advantage.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was an easy task.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Just got back from my hometown, arrived late. </p>
