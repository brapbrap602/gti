<h1>Chapter 865: Commanding Thunder</h1><p>Uninvited guests were rapidly approaching.</p><p>These individuals made no attempt to hide their intentions, brazenly charging towards Qin Sang and the others, who couldn't help but feel a sense of alarm and bewilderment. However, they were already committed, with no way to turn back.</p><p>The cage constricted, the power of the Glacial Gale Formation fully unleashed. Frigid air, sharp as blades, shredded the Kui Dragon.</p><p>The Kui Dragon’s scale armor, once a formidable lightning cloak, was now tattered and broken. Its roars lacked their previous vigor, suppressed by the icy winds and blood-red swords.  Each attempt to rise was met with failure, only adding to its wounds.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang urged the others on. They held nothing back, understanding that they had to severely wound the Kui Dragon before the newcomers arrived. Only then could they avoid being caught between cultivators and the beast, allowing them to focus solely on the intruders.</p><p>The Glacial Gale Formation was pushed to its limits. Columns of icy air collapsed inwards, slowly pressing down. The pale white mass of energy seemed to weigh a thousand tons, pinning the Kui Dragon to the ground.</p><p>Raindrops froze into icicles the moment they reached this area, covering the surrounding ground in a layer of ice shards.</p><p>The Kui Dragon's howls, mingled with the roar of thunder, carried far into the distance. The approaching cultivators, hearing the dragon's cries, felt their hearts clench with anguish.</p><p>The gale whipped up waves hundreds of feet high.</p><p>Rain poured down.</p><p>The thunder god hid within the dark clouds, beating his drum in accompaniment to the battle.</p><p>Braving the wind, rain, and lightning, the cultivators flew with all their might, finally nearing their destination. They saw the Kui Dragon trapped within the formation.</p><p>The once majestic beast was now a pitiful sight.</p><p>Chains of icy air held it down, forcing it to curl into a ball as it endured the onslaught.</p><p>Its scales were falling off, its flesh torn and bloody, stained with mud and ice. Its head and body were covered in sword and whip marks, its aura weaker than ever before.</p><p>The Kui Dragon roared, its voice hoarse. Seeing familiar faces arrive, hope flickered in its eyes as it struggled with renewed vigor.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>"Release it!"</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>…</p><p>Witnessing this scene, the cultivators' eyes widened in fury, their roars of outrage echoing as they commanded Qin Sang and the others to release the Kui Dragon.</p><p>This was the most crucial moment. Naturally, Qin Sang and his companions paid no heed to their cries, seizing the opportunity to continue their assault.</p><p>Young Master Fang glanced in the direction of the newcomers, his eyes flashing. He stepped forward, his hand gesturing as rain coalesced into a hundred-foot water sword, pointing it at them.  His voice boomed a warning, "We are hunting a demon here.  Stay back! Otherwise, don't blame us for being impolite!"</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>One of the newcomers jumped in anger. "The Kui Dragon is not a demon, but a spirit beast of my sect! You dare threaten us after unprovokedly attacking our sect's spirit beast?  Such arrogance!"</p><p>Spirit beast?</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang and the others were taken aback, exchanging surprised glances.</p><p>Spirit beasts as powerful as the Kui Dragon were rare, and few cultivators could subdue them. Judging by the newcomers’ fury, could it be true that this was their sect’s guardian spirit beast?</p><p>Young Master Fang scoffed, "You say the Kui Dragon is your spirit beast?  Is it truly so? This area is known for its spiritual barrenness. From where did a sect suddenly appear? This demon has been swallowing thunder and spitting mist, stirring up storms and repeatedly attacking passing caravans. Such a wicked demon should be slain by all, yet no one has ever come to restrain it!  Your honeyed words are nothing but a ploy to seize the Kui Dragon's spiritual materials. Don't try to deceive us. Kill it now!"</p><p>His last words were directed at Qin Sang and his companions.</p><p>Doubt filled their minds, unsure who was telling the truth.</p><p>However, Young Master Fang’s words held merit. These people were capable of anything for treasure, and pretending to be the demon's owners was not out of the realm of possibility.</p><p>Their apparent fury could very well be an act.</p><p>The treasures on the Kui Dragon were enough to make them take such risks.</p><p>The situation was unclear.</p><p>But after expending so much effort to hunt the Kui Dragon, they couldn't simply let it go.</p><p>"Bullshit!"</p><p>The other party was nearly driven mad, cursing loudly. "Ever since the Kui Dragon was subdued by my master, it has been gentle and has never harmed anyone..."</p><p>Curses were clearly ineffective.</p><p>The icy air within the Glacial Gale Formation pressed down further. The Kui Dragon could only lie prostrate on the ground, its whimpers barely audible.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>The newcomers flew closer, clearly seeing the Kui Dragon’s state, their rage boiling over. The leading man in blue robes was thoroughly enraged by the dragon's miserable condition. His eyes bloodshot, he roared, "Commanding Thunder!"</p><p>His fellow disciples had long been unable to restrain themselves. As they flew, their figures shifted rapidly, surrounding the man in blue before abruptly stopping.</p><p>This action was unexpected.</p><p>Young Master Fang's eyes narrowed, secretly circulating his true essence. He clutched a talisman in his hand, but made no outward sign.</p><p>Qin Sang, distracted, looked at the group. He saw them hovering in midair, seated beneath the dark clouds, their hands forming strange seals, fingers pointed upwards.</p><p>An inexplicable unease settled over him, causing him to frown.</p><p>These cultivators weren't exceptionally powerful. Only the middle-aged man was at the late Core Formation stage, not as strong as their group. Moreover, they controlled the Glacial Gale Formation. Once the Kui Dragon was eliminated, they could fully utilize the formation against their enemies.</p><p>The power of the Glacial Gale Formation had been proven in their battle with the Kui Dragon. Even if the newcomers had some tricks up their sleeves, they shouldn't be stronger than the formation.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. Before he could react, a wave of inexplicable fear suddenly washed over him, originating from the dark clouds above.</p><p>A jolt of terror shot through him. He abruptly looked up and saw the clouds churning, a blinding silver light radiating from a massive ball of lightning that had somehow gathered there!</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled.</p><p>The fluctuations of this lightning energy were terrifying.  Just who were these people? Whether it was a Daoist art or a formation, they had conjured such terrifying power in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Countless bolts of lightning in the sky above the island, as if drawn by some force, converged towards this point.</p><p>A gigantic sphere of lightning formed at an alarming speed, its accumulated power suddenly erupting outwards.</p><p>In Qin Sang's eyes, the dazzling lightning light abruptly began to expand, pouring downwards.</p><p>All of this happened in a fleeting instant.</p><p>The others were equally horrified.  No one had anticipated such a terrifying technique. Now, they had nowhere to hide. Someone shouted in desperation, "Quickly! Block it with the icy air!"</p><p>Everyone understood.</p><p>All five of them were focused on the formation; it was too late to use any other methods. The lightning was too fast, too powerful.</p><p>Only by manipulating the icy air of the Glacial Gale Formation could they hope to block the lightning and buy themselves time.</p><p>As for the Kui Dragon trapped within the icy air, they couldn't worry about it now.</p><p>"Rise!"</p><p>Chu Heng roared. With combined effort, they activated another aspect of the Glacial Gale Formation. The icy air reversed course, surging upwards.</p><p>In an instant, lightning and icy air collided.</p><p>The resulting shockwave instantly swept outwards, striking them first. They were tossed about like leaves in a storm.</p>
