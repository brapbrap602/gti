<h1>Chapter 361: Song Yi</h1><p>Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>The disciple guarding the Earth Sinkhole was cultivating in his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived, concealed by his invisibility technique, found the crevice from before, and landed on the stone platform.</p><p>He first took out the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle and filled it with Earthly Yin Qi. Afterward, he waved his hand, deploying a large formation to mask his presence, and summoned two refined corpses.</p><p>Only the last step remained – infusing the corpses with Yin Qi – before he could succeed.</p><p>However, this step was also the most difficult, and Qin Sang was unsure.</p><p>If the refinement failed, and the refined corpse's Qi Sea was destroyed, he could only turn it into a zombie.  It would be a small consolation, but a Celestial Corpse Talisman and a Foundation Establishment cultivator's body would be wasted.</p><p>It would have been better to kill them directly and then refine them into Yin Corpses.</p><p>The refining method in the *Celestial Yin Corpse Art* was indeed potent, but the cost was also very high. Not only were the materials rare and difficult to find, but every step was full of uncertainty. No wonder the disciples of the Celestial Corpse Sect couldn't have a living corpse each.</p><p>Qin Sang had already mentally rehearsed the process countless times. After checking the refined corpses, he began the preparations.</p><p>With two refined corpses, he had some room for error.</p><p>The young man in warrior attire had a lower cultivation level than Liang Yan, so Qin Sang started with him.</p><p>He channeled his spiritual power, drew in a stream of Earthly Yin Qi, subdued it, and then injected it into the Yin Corpse's Qi Sea.  This immediately caused a strong resistance from the spiritual power within the Yin Corpse.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, Qin Sang emerged from the Earth Sinkhole with a gloomy expression.</p><p>It was no wonder he was in a bad mood.  Of the two living corpses, only one was successfully refined.  Fortunately, the successful one was Liang Yan, the stronger of the two.</p><p>As for the young man in warrior attire, in the collision between his spiritual power and the Earthly Yin Qi, his dantian was completely destroyed. Qin Sang could only refine him into a cannon fodder zombie.</p><p>Liang Yan's Qi Sea had also suffered considerable damage, and the refinement almost failed. Luckily, it was salvaged.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back at the Earth Sinkhole. The refined corpses were left inside to be nurtured by the Earthly Yin Qi for a period of time and recover on their own.</p><p>Two of the three most important tasks were completed. The last one was to return to the sect and consult the Purple Subtlety Palace's records to see if there were any records within Pagoda Peak.</p><p>The remaining tasks were trivial. When the appointed time arrived, he could go to the Broken Sky Mountains and meet with Wanderer Yun.</p><p>He steered the Stygian Cloud towards Soaring Dragon Mountain in the Ancient Abyss Kingdom. Returning Dragon Abbey was where his public cave dwelling was located. If anyone had business with him, they would leave message talismans there.</p><p>After opening the Returning Dragon Abbey's restrictions, Qin Sang discovered quite a few accumulated message talismans inside.  Message talismans of various colors were trapped within the formation, drifting like mayflies, glittering like stars.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently examined them one by one.</p><p>Among them were some routine notifications from the sect, and many from passing cultivators who, sensing the spiritual formation at Returning Dragon Abbey, left messages expressing their desire to connect.</p><p>There were also messages from acquaintances such as Shopkeeper Wu, Senior Brother Wen, and Zhuang Yan.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, there was even one from Granny Jing, the senior who ran the secret shop in the Asking Moon Market, inviting him to help with a task and promising generous compensation.</p><p>Moreover, the task wasn't posted by other fellow Daoists in the secret shop but was issued in Granny Jing's name.</p><p>Calculating the time, it was shortly after he had set off for the Ancient Battlefield. Naturally, he couldn't respond to Granny Jing.</p><p>Holding the message talisman, Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>When he first met Granny Jing, she gave him a mysterious feeling that he couldn't quite grasp. After several interactions, the impression deepened, especially Granny Jing's insistence on the secret shop's rules, which Qin Sang appreciated.</p><p>Many members of the secret shop were Foundation Establishment cultivators, making it a good resource.</p><p>It wouldn't hurt to build a good relationship with Granny Jing.</p><p>Previously, he was unaware of this message talisman. Now that he was back, it was best to personally explain the situation, which wouldn't take much time.</p><p>More than ninety percent of the message talismans were useless.  Qin Sang stayed at Returning Dragon Abbey for an hour, organizing everything before flying towards Lesser Hua Mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>Asking Moon Market.</p><p>After several decades, the market had hardly changed.</p><p>Qin Sang walked down the street, heading for Shopkeeper Wu's shop.  There were several message talismans from Shopkeeper Wu at Returning Dragon Abbey, especially in recent years, almost one every year, the most recent one being from two months ago.</p><p>Although the message talismans contained only greetings, from their frequency, Qin Sang guessed that Shopkeeper Wu might have encountered something.</p><p>He was just about to ask Shopkeeper Wu to help refine some magical artifacts, so he came directly. If Shopkeeper Wu's matter wasn't serious, he could help within his capabilities.</p><p>The shop was still in its original location.  Qin Sang paused, glanced at the 'Li Residence' opposite the shop, and stepped inside.</p><p>“Welcome, Senior!  Is Senior looking to purchase or refine magical artifacts?”</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu wasn't in the shop. There was only a young man of eighteen or nineteen. Seeing Qin Sang enter, he immediately greeted him warmly, offering tea and a seat, displaying a rather lively disposition.</p><p>The young man was also a cultivator. Upon seeing his appearance, Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He took a sip of tea and said, “Is Fellow Daoist Wu not in the shop?”</p><p>The young man exclaimed, "So Senior knows my Master?  Master is refining magical artifacts in the back.  I'll go and inform him immediately."</p><p>Master?</p><p>Qin Sang watched the young man's retreating figure, a playful smile appearing on his lips.</p><p>Not long after the young man left, rapid footsteps sounded from the back.</p><p>Then, Shopkeeper Wu, now with a head of silver hair, hurried out, the young man trotting behind him.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin! It's been over thirty years. How have you been?” Shopkeeper Wu rushed to Qin Sang, his expression and voice filled with excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang rose to greet him, cupping his hands in return, "Fellow Daoist Wu, I trust you are well."</p><p>Before he left Lesser Hua Mountain, Shopkeeper Wu still had the appearance of a middle-aged man in his prime. Now, his dark hair had turned completely silver.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu hadn't achieved Foundation Establishment, and the ravages of time were evident on him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist still looks the same, while I am already old and frail! Shameful! Shameful!" Shopkeeper Wu sighed, wanting to cover his face.</p><p>The two sat down and exchanged pleasantries.</p><p>The young man stood respectfully at the side, quietly observing Qin Sang.</p><p>He was still young and didn't know how to hide his emotions. His eyes held easily detectable curiosity and anticipation.</p><p>After finishing a pot of tea, Qin Sang put down his cup and looked at the young man pouring the tea, asking kindly, "What's your name?"</p><p>The young man glanced at Shopkeeper Wu, who smiled without speaking.</p><p>“Replying to Senior, my name is Song Yi."</p><p>“Song Yi…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly and asked again, “What is your relationship with Song Ying and Song Chengxian?”</p><p>The moment he entered the shop and saw the young man, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity in his features.</p><p>Handsome and refined, he resembled Song Hua and Song Ying.</p><p>Song Chengxian was Song Ying's son. After Song Chengxian broke through to Foundation Establishment, Qin Sang, in fulfillment of his previous promise, returned to the Song family. Although he didn't accept Song Chengxian as a disciple, he gave him a Foundation Establishment Pill as repayment to the Song family.</p><p>“Replying to Senior, Song Ying is my grandmother, and Song Chengxian is my uncle,” Song Yi replied.</p>
