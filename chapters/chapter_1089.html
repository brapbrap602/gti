<h1>Chapter 181: Control</h1><p>Everyone understood that now was not the time to settle scores with the Dragon King.</p><p>The crimson barrier clearly originated from the blood-red coffin, a creation of the Ancient Demon himself. What was his motive for pulling them into this space?</p><p>The situation was strange and difficult to decipher.</p><p>The sword energy and the power of the blood-red coffin had merged, emitting terrifying fluctuations that made everyone's hearts pound. No one dared to approach the platform. It looked like a stalemate, and no one knew who would ultimately prevail.</p><p>If the sword energy were to be eroded by the blood-red light, and they had to face the Ancient Demon directly, everyone present would likely perish, and even the entire Canglang Sea would descend into chaos.</p><p>Everyone's gaze shifted to the Ancient Demon's soul fragment.</p><p>They saw the soul fragment standing close to Qingzhu, whose state seemed peculiar.</p><p>…</p><p>At the moment Qingzhu appeared after being pulled into this space, the Demonic Qi emanating from the blood-red coffin surged into his body.</p><p>The clarity in Qingzhu's eyes instantly faded, replaced by a bewildered expression, yet his aura was steadily rising.</p><p>At this point, Qingzhu's demonic soul had been controlled by the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Qingzhu had almost suppressed his demonic soul and was about to regain control of his body, but all his efforts were instantly undone by the Ancient Demon.</p><p>With his body under the Ancient Demon's control, Qingzhu's true self was powerless to resist.</p><p>"As expected!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's soul fragment glanced at Qingzhu. He had long suspected that his demonic seal had been tampered with by his true self.</p><p>He turned to the blood-red coffin and angrily rebuked his true self, "You still don't trust me!"</p><p>The true self was using a secret technique, forcibly infusing Qingzhu's body with Demonic Qi.</p><p>He had just forcibly activated the great formation, expending a great deal of energy. If that Demonic Qi had been given to him, his power would have surged instantly.</p><p>"Less talk!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon's true self's anxious and furious roar echoed in the soul fragment's ears. "I am consuming the sacred coffin's essence. Kill them quickly and set up the Blood River Formation to defile the sword energy. This sword energy has been weakened by time. These people are barely enough. Otherwise, when the sword energy strikes, you and I will be annihilated together!"</p><p>The soul fragment was startled and sensed the aura of the sword energy, revealing a trace of fear.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang, noticing that no one was paying attention to him, quietly moved to the edge of the crimson barrier.</p><p>The young man and woman were not far from Qin Sang. Following their master's orders, they, like Qin Sang, cautiously hid in the corner, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>Once the battle began, even a stray aftershock could claim their lives.</p><p>Qin Sang exchanged a glance with them, remaining silent, while secretly communicating with Bai, inquiring about Ya Gu's condition and discussing countermeasures.</p><p>"That girl is risking her life. Her consciousness is dormant, like death. The Fat Silkworm is slightly better, just exhausted and sleeping inside her."</p><p>Bai sighed. "Originally, by removing the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, she had a high chance of waking up. Now, it's hard to say. Fortunately, you fed her the Soul Cleansing Liquid, along with the Jade Nectar of Life and the Soul Nourishing Wood. Her condition won't worsen, at least. It depends on her fate... How did you run into so many dangerous individuals again?"</p><p>Bai's tone was filled with resentment and even despair.</p><p>Qin Sang was also worried.</p><p>He touched the crimson barrier and realized that it didn't actually exist, but was a manifestation of some profound mystical barrier technique. Seeing that the Demon Lord and the others were helpless against it, he knew that he couldn't escape in the chaos.</p><p>Out of the tiger's den, into the wolf's lair.</p><p>The only good news was that these people had no grudge against him, and no one cared about this insignificant little character.</p><p>"It's probably the Ancient Demon's scheme. I hope they can defeat him."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, feeling powerless.</p><p>No matter how desperate the situation, he had never given up, striving to carve a path to survival. Now, he was truly helpless, blaming only his own weakness.</p><p>Fortunately, there were others at the forefront.</p><p>If he were to fall into the hands of the demons, having so many prominent figures perish alongside him would at least be a grand exit.</p><p>After falling in, Qin Sang saw Qingzhu and felt a flicker of hope, only to find that Qingzhu's state was abnormal, not at all like he was conscious.</p><p>This extinguished Qin Sang's newly ignited hope. What had happened to Senior Qingzhu?</p><p>He scanned his surroundings, secretly observing the situation.</p><p>Seeing Su Nu possessed by the Ancient Demon's soul fragment, Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>Back on the mountain, when the soul fragment was in the ravine, surrounded by Demonic Qi, Qin Sang only dared to observe from a distance. He hadn't seen the soul fragment's true form, but he had his suspicions.</p><p>Su Nu's premonition was correct; the three trade alliances harbored ill intentions towards her.</p><p>But she was powerless to resist and ultimately met this fate.</p><p>Qin Sang's attention then turned to the blood-red coffin and the sword energy.</p><p>This sword energy was extremely powerful, the strongest he had ever seen. Fairy Nangui's words confirmed that it was left by an ancient cultivator.</p><p>A hint of surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The sword intent contained within the sword energy felt strangely familiar.</p><p>Different people cultivating the same technique would follow different paths, but the origin remained the same. Qin Sang stared intently at the sword energy, sensing the unique sword intent.</p><p>The person who left behind this sword energy likely also cultivated the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture"!</p><p>The "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture" truly had a deep connection with the Seven Kills Sect!</p><p>The outer sect's Heavenly Tower and the inner sect's Leaning Heaven Peak all pointed to this.</p><p>…</p><p>Demonic Qi surged into Qingzhu's body.</p><p>His face contorted, and his eyes were replaced by a bloody crimson, becoming eerie blood pupils.</p><p>Within him, another wave of energy emerged, silently roaring. Qingzhu's true self hadn't given up, struggling fiercely, but unable to stop the process.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances, chills running down their spines.</p><p>Although Qingzhu's cultivation was not as high as theirs, it was only slightly lower, yet he was completely powerless to resist.</p><p>If it were them, they might not fare any better.</p><p>Qingzhu's aura soared, instantly breaking through the bottleneck, advancing to Nascent Soul late stage, and continuing to rise without any sign of stopping, shocking everyone.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's true self's methods were even more terrifying than his soul fragment's.</p><p>Without needing to say much, the Great Shaman, understanding the situation, immediately formed an alliance with the humans.</p><p>Releasing the Ancient Demon would bring calamity to both races.</p><p>Just then, a peculiar fluctuation suddenly emerged behind the Dragon King, who was standing close to the crimson barrier.</p><p>Crimson flames appeared.</p><p>At the center of the flames was a phoenix feather, one end held tightly in the Dragon King's hand.</p><p>It was the Heavenly Phoenix Feather given to him by King Nine Phoenixes!</p><p>As the Heavenly Phoenix Feather appeared, its tip pointed towards the crimson barrier, and the flames burned, seemingly real and illusory.</p><p>The next moment, the crimson barrier distorted, as if about to be pierced by the Heavenly Phoenix Feather!</p><p>A faint smile appeared on the Dragon King's lips.</p><p>He had naturally been shocked and enraged upon seeing these powerful enemies appear one after another.</p><p>He didn't know the reason behind the sudden change or what was sealed inside the blood-red coffin.</p><p>But he understood one thing: regardless of the final outcome, he would not meet a good end, and might even be immediately besieged.</p><p>The Heavenly Phoenix Feather given to him by King Nine Phoenixes had taken effect. Although this treasure was not as powerful as a true feather, it still contained a trace of the Heavenly Phoenix's divine power.</p><p>He had discreetly activated the Heavenly Phoenix Feather, and it had worked!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Nine-Lived Black Tortoise, who had been secretly communicating with the Dragon King, flashed forward, blocking the Dragon King and manifesting a solid tortoise shell, firmly protecting them.</p><p>The Dragon King swung his arm, and the Heavenly Phoenix Feather gently swiped downwards.</p>
