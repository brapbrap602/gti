<h1>Chapter 1253: The Prison Cell</h1><p>Within the grand formation, aside from the flesh-and-blood puppets, there were numerous other transformations, all brimming with lethal intent. However, for one, the formation had no master controlling it, and for another, the black towers were heavily damaged. Though the formation was powerful, it was riddled with flaws.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Just as they passed through a soul-corroding gust of yin wind, they were met with a barrage of crimson divine light. Above them, the sky resembled a starry expanse, with blood-red stars floating and emitting malevolent radiance.</p><p>Qin Sang always managed to evade danger in advance, weaving through the gaps in the divine light. The black tower formation was incredibly complex, vast in scope, and ever-changing. It was impossible to grasp the entire formation's structure in a short time, so Qin Sang had no choice but to follow the guidance of the Thunder Bead.</p><p>By now, he couldn't even tell where he was anymore. The Thunder Bead grew brighter and brighter, to the point of being blinding.</p><p>At that moment, Fat Chicken suddenly pointed at a distant black tower and shouted urgently, "Master, my mother might be trapped inside that black tower!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed Fat Chicken's pointing finger and saw a black tower flickering in and out of existence amidst the divine light. He instructed Fat Chicken to sense again, and after confirming, they quickly pursued the black tower.</p><p>The Demon King, who had been quite powerful in her time, had been trapped here, so there must be hidden dangers. Naturally, Qin Sang had to be cautious. He ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to fully activate its Heavenly Eye ability, carefully observing their surroundings.</p><p>Under the guidance of the Thunder Bead, Qin Sang drew closer and closer to the black tower. Strangely, however, the area around the black tower seemed no different from anywhere else, as if everything was normal. There were no flesh-and-blood puppets blocking the entrance, nor were there any ancient restrictions of great power.</p><p>"Could the danger be hidden inside the black tower?" Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>He had never entered any of the black towers before and had no idea what they were like inside. The black tower before him was well-preserved, with only a few small cracks at its peak.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the black tower and found a stone door on the lowest level. The door was slightly ajar, revealing a wide, dark stone passageway. Standing before the door, Qin Sang felt an even more sinister aura emanating from within.</p><p>After listening quietly for a while, he heard no movement inside. Hesitating for a moment, Qin Sang ordered Fat Chicken to stay close behind him, summoned the Ebony Sword and the Eighteen Demon Banners to protect himself, and stepped inside.</p><p>As he entered the passageway, a sudden gust of wind rushed toward him. Qin Sang's expression changed slightly as the Ebony Sword flashed, unleashing a dazzling sword beam that slashed forward with incredible speed.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A deafening roar echoed through the passageway. Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw that what had attacked him was a humanoid figure clad in black armor, its face completely covered. The black-armored figure was of normal human size, holding a black chain that clattered noisily, exuding a thick aura of malevolence.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang had clearly sensed nothing inside. Yet, out of nowhere, this black-armored figure had appeared.</p><p>The attack had come so suddenly that Qin Sang was caught off guard. He had nearly used his full strength in that strike, yet it had only managed to sever the figure's chain in two and crack its faceplate. To his surprise, the faceplate revealed nothing insideâ€”only a swirling mass of blood energy.</p><p>The black-armored figure swayed for a moment, then swung its chain at him again.</p><p>"A puppet? Or something else?" Qin Sang speculated silently, his hands moving swiftly as he unleashed a flurry of sword strikes. He soon realized that the black-armored figure seemed to have no weak points, so he resorted to forcibly severing its limbs and body.</p><p>With a clatter, the black armor fragments fell to the ground, then silently melted away and disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings and noticed rows of stone cells lining the walls. Only upon entering did he realize that the damage to the stone tower was far more severe than it appeared from the outside. The walls were covered in spiderweb-like cracks, and most of the stone doors had completely collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to a stone cell near the entrance of the passageway. It was a very ordinary room, with nothing remarkable about it. Then he noticed another cell further inside that was relatively intact, and he spotted something unusual.</p><p>Just as he was about to take a closer look, a rumbling sound echoed through the passageway, and a group of black-armored figures charged out, wielding a variety of weapons.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately prepared for battle, activating his Heavenly Eye ability to carefully observe the intact stone cell. He saw that the stone door seemed to contain endless darkness, devouring his vision. On the door, faint blood-colored runes flickered briefly before vanishing.</p><p>It was clear that this place was protected by profound restrictions and talismanic techniques. Qin Sang also noticed that the stone door contained a dense illusory realm and various runes he couldn't comprehend. The ancient restrictions and talismanic techniques on the door were not only directed outward but also inward, with no less power.</p><p>"Is this a prison cell?" Qin Sang thought to himself, recalling what he had seen and heard in the Abyssal Ruins. He felt that this place was a massive prison, and these black-armored figures were likely the prison guards.</p><p>No wonder the black towers were arranged in such a grand formation. As long as someone was controlling the formation, it could unleash endless transformations. Combined with the flesh-and-blood puppets hunting outside, even if a prisoner managed to escape the black tower, they would have no chance of survival.</p><p>From this perspective, the Abyssal Ruins, the Blood Lake, and the Palace of Sinful Gods were likely all connected, forming a vast prison system. He wondered what kind of force the Purple Star Palace had been in its heyday to construct such terrifying prisons.</p><p>The stone door was tightly shut, and inside, there was only deathly silence. Could there still be prisoners alive here after all this time?</p><p>However, the restrictions on the door were far less powerful than the Demon-Suppressing Formation jointly set up by the three clans. The prisoners' cultivation levels were surely far inferior to that of the Demon Lord, and even less so compared to the mysterious figure imprisoned alone at the Heavenly Corpse Sect's headquarters. The likelihood of any prisoners surviving to this day was slim.</p><p>Most likely, these were just some minor minions from back then.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the ferocious Demon Lord suppressed in the Seven Slaughter Hall. The prisoners held here were surely no saints.</p><p>These black-armored figures were likely manifestations of the black tower's restrictions. With the black tower damaged, their strength was no longer what it once was, but they were still formidable, able to withstand several sword strikes.</p><p>If these black-armored figures were the only threat, though troublesome, they weren't much to worry about.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang's Ebony Sword shot forward like lightning, splitting into countless sword beams mid-flight. In an instant, the black-armored figures were engulfed in a rain of swords. Amidst the chaotic clashing sounds, they all met the same fate as the first black-armored figure before they could even get close.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after these black-armored figures fell, even more charged out. Qin Sang didn't dare hesitate and immediately rushed forward with Fat Chicken in tow. After a fierce battle, they reached the end of the passageway and found a staircase leading to the second level. Without pause, they ascended to the second floor.</p><p>The Ebony Sword danced through the crowd, cutting down countless black-armored figures. Yet, the black-armored figures seemed endless. If they were trapped here for too long, even Qin Sang would be worn down to death.</p><p>In one breath, they climbed to the sixth level.</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>As soon as they reached this level, Fat Chicken suddenly pointed at the first stone cell by the entrance and shouted excitedly.</p><p>This level was no different from the ones below, with the same monotonous passageways and prison cells. Fat Chicken stared intently at the stone cell, as the Thunder Bead's guidance was pointing directly inside it!</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised and quickly moved closer. The stone cell looked no different from the others. The stone door was completely shattered, and a few scattered rocks lay on the ground. Qin Sang's gaze swept over the area, but he couldn't detect anything unusual.</p><p>However, the Thunder Bead's guidance couldn't be wrong.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a sword formation in front of the door to block all the black-armored figures, then carefully examined the stone cell. Finally, he noticed something unusual on the floor of the cell.</p>
