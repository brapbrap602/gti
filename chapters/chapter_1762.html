<h1>Chapter 1753: Apprehending the Demon</h1><p>“That little she-devil was secretly followed by a cultivator, likely a temple master…”</p><p>The wolf demon spoke truthfully, hate flashing in its eyes, gnashing its teeth.</p><p>The snake demon let out a human-like chuckle. If Daoist officials were so easy to kill, it wouldn't have had to lie dormant for so long, resorting to using others.</p><p>“Since you failed, why are you still here?” The snake demon's eyes were cold, its tone flat.</p><p>The wolf demon's expression darkened.  “I toiled for you, friend, and suffered this setback. Not only did I lose my altar and wolf soldiers, if it weren't for my ability to deceive heaven and earth, you wouldn't even be seeing me today… Are you really so heartless?”</p><p>The snake demon scoffed, noncommittal, its body gradually turning translucent, about to dissipate.</p><p>The wolf demon panicked. “Though my cultivation is severely damaged, it’s not difficult to recover. But with my altar lost, I can only ask for your guidance, friend. As long as you protect me, I'll pledge allegiance to you, obey your commands, and serve you.”</p><p>Hearing this, the snake demon stopped dissipating, staring at the wolf demon for a long time before speaking in a detached tone, “Six hundred li northwest of this mountain, in a deep ravine, there's a cave dwelling.”</p><p>Without waiting for a response, it turned into a pool of water and fell into the pond.  No matter how the wolf demon called out, there was no reply.</p><p>The wolf demon straightened up, its eyes rolling. It wondered what scheme the immortal had in mind and whether it should honestly follow the snake demon’s instructions.</p><p>After waiting a while without receiving any orders, it left disgruntled.</p><p>After traversing mountains and valleys to the ravine the snake demon mentioned, the wolf demon found a small cave.  Making do, it used the cave as a refuge, entered, and diligently cultivated, awaiting further instructions.</p><p>Meanwhile, before Qin Sang lay two treasures: a seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo and an Evolution Tree.</p><p>Restoring his true essence would require relying on magic artifacts. Obtaining high-grade artifacts wasn't something that could be done overnight, so it was better to find a way to improve his strength first.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally thought of a secret technique, the *Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele*, obtained from the grotesque-faced man.</p><p>The seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo was obtained from a trade with the Qinghu Saint King. It was originally intended to be used as a spiritual medium for cultivating the *Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele*.</p><p>The death of his avatar, which sacrificed itself to protect him, had unexpectedly created a better choice.</p><p>Recreating an avatar was something Qin Sang wouldn't consider for now.  Back then, he had used a Yuan Ying spirit puppet refined by the Shangyuan Pure Quiet Palace for many years as a base, allowing him to effortlessly refine a Yuan Ying-level external avatar. Now, the Evolution Tree had reverted to its spirit wood state, its power dissipating.</p><p>Cultivation in this world wasn't easy; recreating an avatar would be a lengthy and complex undertaking.</p><p>After weighing his options, Qin Sang put away the seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo, leaving the Evolution Tree, and the intricacies of the *Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele* flowed through his mind.</p><p>This technique requires spirit wood as a medium to cultivate an incredibly powerful spirit wood body.</p><p>As for its power, the grotesque-faced man had demonstrated it vividly before him during the battle at the Wuxiang Immortal Gate.</p><p>Back then, the grotesque-faced man could draw upon the surrounding wood spirit energy by simply standing on the ground; the mountains, forests, and plants were all sources of his power, seemingly inexhaustible. Qin Sang had been forced to set fire to the forest to restrict him.</p><p>But cultivating this technique wasn't easy.</p><p>Such unrestrained absorption of external power would place a tremendous burden on the cultivator if their physical body wasn't strong enough.</p><p>In severe cases, it could even lead to body explosion.</p><p>To be safe, although Qin Sang was prepared to use the seventh-grade Azure Spirit Bamboo as a medium, he intended to wait until the *Celestial Demon Refining Form* reached the late fourth stage before cultivating it.  Unexpectedly, so many changes occurred in the meantime.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man wasn't a body cultivator, but the technique he cultivated was a top-tier Wood-attribute technique, the *Wood Emperor Strategy*, which was the most compatible with this secret technique, allowing him to utilize the absorbed wood spirit energy through the technique. Even so, he only dared to cultivate this technique after he broke through to the late Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Previously, whenever Qin Sang had free time, he would take out this secret technique to study it, until he had mastered it thoroughly.</p><p>The first step in cultivating this technique wasn't outward but inward; one must first refine the body's orifices and maintain a special state.</p><p>Then, one must open spiritual orifices on the chosen spirit wood medium, which must correspond one-to-one with the cultivator and be perfectly compatible. Only then, by integrating the spirit wood into oneself, could one forge a spirit wood body.</p><p>Only after carefully studying the technique did Qin Sang understand why the grotesque-faced man repeatedly attacked his external avatar.</p><p>His top-tier Wood-attribute technique gave him extremely keen sensitivity to the aura of spirit wood, but that was only one reason.</p><p>That special state served another purpose: it could help the cultivator find the most compatible medium. Once encountered, there would be a subtle connection.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man had already intended to condense a spirit wood body and begun cultivating the *Posterior Heaven Wooden Man Stele*. When he encountered the external avatar, he sensed a connection. He just didn't expect that the connection was actually with the external avatar's main body.</p><p>In the world of spiritual cultivation, it's hard to find a better medium than the Yandao Tree.  That's why Qin Sang didn't hesitate between using it and creating a physical manifestation after obtaining this secret technique.</p><p>The Yandao Tree is a naturally occurring spiritual being.  Its spirit can be used for rebirth without diminishing one's cultivation. Even an immature Yandao Tree can be refined into a Yuan Ying puppet or used to cultivate an external manifestation, holding countless mysteries within.</p><p>Once an external manifestation is cultivated, meridians and acupoints develop within the body, just like a normal person.  When the second spirit disperses, the Yandao Tree reverts to its original state as a spirit wood, with the meridians and acupoints vanishing without a trace—another one of its remarkable features.</p><p>This shows that opening acupoints on a Yandao Tree is far easier than on other spirit wood, second only to those legendary natural wonders with inherently divine acupoints.</p><p>The medium is ready. Qin Sang can refine his own acupoints and open the spiritual acupoints of the Yandao Tree simultaneously. He patiently cultivates here, allowing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to search for the snake demon's lair.</p><p>While Qin Sang cultivates, the wolf demon anxiously waits. The power of heaven is unpredictable; the less Qin Sang acts, the more uneasy the wolf demon becomes.</p><p>On a rock beside the ravine, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly waits for three days and nights, finding no abnormalities.  The snake demon is clearly very cautious.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly takes flight, leaving graceful butterfly trails across the mountains.  Unfortunately, her divine powers conceal her, preventing anyone from appreciating her beauty.</p><p>She leaves her mark across the mountain range, gradually widening her search area. After several months and countless mountains traversed, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly returns to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Nine suspicious locations?"</p><p>Sensing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's thoughts, Qin Sang muses.  The butterfly found nine places with subtle auras, possibly the snake demon's lair.</p><p>Unsure of the snake demon's abilities and to avoid alarming it, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly didn't enter any of the suspected lairs.  She couldn't determine which one was real from outside, or if any of them were real at all.</p><p>The snake demon has ignored the wolf demon for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decides to stop waiting and act. Since demonic cultivators exist, it's not unique to this snake demon; there's no need to waste time.</p><p>Even if he fails and the snake demon escapes, he can learn their methods and target others. If he attracts a powerful demonic cultivator, he can simply retreat to the Daoist Court.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly venture into the wild, thoroughly investigating the area before making a plan.  They fly towards one of the suspicious locations without haste.</p><p>Along the way, he holds spirit stones, his true energy gradually replenishing.</p><p>This hidden location, like the wolf demon's lair, is hidden beneath a ravine between two mountains. Qin Sang conceals his presence, landing on the eastern peak and observing for a moment before sending a message to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly flies off.</p><p>He actually has two other helpers: the Fire Jade Centipede and Su Zinan's demonic soul from the Three Corpses Demonic Banner. He didn't bring out the banner with his external manifestation; the treasure is preserved.</p><p>However, the Fire Jade Centipede is neither skilled in stealth nor combat, and the demonic soul cannot stray far. Only the Sky-Eyed Butterfly can help this time.</p><p>Watching the Sky-Eyed Butterfly fly away, Qin Sang silently calculates the time, flips his hand, revealing the Sun God Tree, and then appears above the ravine.</p><p>Looking down, Qin Sang mentally commands, and three divine birds take flight like arrows, diving into the ravine.</p><p>'Sizzle…'</p><p>The moment the birds touch the water, a towering mist erupts.  The entire ravine is instantly dried by the South Ming Li Fire.  Then, a deafening roar comes from within the mist, followed by a surge of crimson flames. The mountains on either side shake; one even seems to lose its foundation and leans to the side.</p><p>Rocks fly, and the mountain demons flee in terror.  This realm truly has many demons and monsters; demonic and monstrous auras rise from the surrounding mountains, filling the sky as they desperately escape.</p><p>This is the first time the Sun God Birds unleash their power in this realm, causing earth-shattering destruction!</p><p>The snake demon's defenses are no match for the three Sun God Birds.  The entrance to the lair and the rocks at the bottom of the ravine are instantly erased by the South Ming Li Fire.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't wanted to capture the snake demon alive, and hadn't slightly diverted the power of the South Ming Li Fire, the lair would have been leveled in a single strike.</p><p>Inside the lair…</p><p>A snake-bodied creature with a human head, a large錦蛇, is coiled and cultivating.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the cave was luxuriously furnished; red candles perfumed the air, light silk curtains draped everywhere, and the snake demon reclined on a silk-covered bed.  A stranger might have mistaken it for a noblewoman's boudoir.</p><p>The snake demon was strikingly beautiful, although its features were excessively delicate, making its gender ambiguous.</p><p>Disaster struck!</p><p>The cave's entrance burst open, a torrent of intense flames surging in, instantly consuming the curtains and furniture.</p><p>Only then did the snake demon awaken with a start, its eyes snapping open to an unbelievable sight: its cave entrance had vanished, replaced by a raging inferno exuding an apocalyptic aura.  Terror filled its eyes.</p><p>Furthermore, in each of the eight other caves, there was another snake demon, identical in appearance, and their furnishings were nearly the same.</p><p>At that moment, all eight snake demons opened their eyes simultaneously, their expressions mirroring the first.</p><p>Fear etched itself on the snake demon's face.  A vibrant, multicolored light erupted from its body, its skin taking on a luminous, almost jade-like sheen.</p><p>Before it could even formulate another thought, two resounding snorts filled its ears; its body stiffened, its eyes filled with bewilderment.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared beside the snake demon, seizing it with a hand. A strange, soft sensation met his touch.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was a layer of snakeskin, with a power within, restless and yearning to return to its source.</p><p>But Qin Sang was faster.  The Sun God Bird having breached the cave, he immediately used a soul-searing incantation to subdue the creature.  Even with his limited spiritual sense, it was no match for Qin Sang; in a moment, he had captured it.</p><p>Finding no main body, Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged.  He immediately devised a plan, using this power to locate the true snake demon.</p><p>This power must have been separated from the snake demon, maintaining a subtle connection.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the connection vanished just as he began to sense it. The snake demon, clearly realizing its predicament, had employed a tactic akin to a gecko shedding its tail.</p><p>"Quite decisive,"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. In that instant, he had already perceived the general direction; escape was impossible.</p><p>Looking towards the southwest, Qin Sang's back crackled with lightning, wings materialized, and with a deafening thunderclap, he vanished, leaving only a streak of lightning.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The thunder echoed through the myriad mountains, countless spirits and demons staring in terror.</p><p>A lightning bolt tore across the sky.</p><p>Directly in the path of the lightning, the snake demon suddenly turned.</p><p>The same scene repeated itself; a multicolored light flared, a power vanished into thin air, leaving only a discarded snakeskin on the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang was too late to stop it, but he now possessed an intact snakeskin, allowing him to discern the snake demon's abilities and roughly judge the direction the multicolored light had returned to.</p><p>"Let's see how many times you can transform..."</p><p>With a casual gesture, Qin Sang reduced the snakeskin to ash with a thunderbolt and, changing course, sped off in another direction.</p><p>High above, the lightning zig-zagged, causing spirits to prostrate themselves and demons to flee.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly found his next target, which again transformed into a snakeskin before him.</p><p>However, this time, he couldn't sense where the light had returned. He quickly understood; the snake demon, aware of the danger, had dispersed the light rather than recalling it.</p><p>Qin Sang realized these skins were more than a mere distraction. The light within each was a fragment of the main body, and its dissipation weakened the demon.</p><p>This was precisely the case.</p><p>This was a unique ability of the snake demon: by refining its shed skins, it could divide itself into beams of light, each fusing with a skin, maintaining the same aura as its true form.</p><p>It could even cultivate in this fragmented state.  If danger arose, it could recall all the light into any one skin, reforming its original body.</p><p>Even if some light failed to escape, it could readily be discarded.  As long as one fragment survived, it could slowly recover.</p><p>It had amassed nine shed skins, creating nine seemingly impregnable caves, believing itself completely secure.</p><p>Understanding this ability's intricacies, Qin Sang secretly thought he might fail.  Just as he was about to choose a direction to pursue, his expression shifted, a smile playing on his lips as he flew north.</p><p>Shortly after, he arrived at a valley. A Sky-Eyed Butterfly greeted him, a charred python lying lifeless below, its markings obliterated.</p><p>While investigating the nine caves, Qin Sang had discovered one particularly well-hidden; if not for the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's exceptional vision, it would have been easily overlooked.  Suspecting it to be the snake demon's true lair, he had stationed the butterfly there.</p><p>Believing its enemy had been lured away, the snake demon hastily recalled its remaining light to escape.  The moment it materialized, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly stunned it.</p><p>Taking the snake, Qin Sang continued his flight towards the Daoist Temple, not forgetting to take the wolf demon as well.</p><p>Upon returning to the Temple's territory, Qin Sang checked his own state, sighing inwardly. He needed to quickly stabilize his energy; otherwise, his limitations would be too great.</p><p>(End)</p>
