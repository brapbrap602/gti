<h1>Chapter 1774: True Treasure</h1><p>Before the courtyard.</p><p>Qin Sang, in disguise, had just presented his visiting card and stood with his hands clasped behind his back, surveying the surroundings.</p><p>Lush trees and fragrant flowers abounded, making it a superior cave dwelling rarely found anywhere.</p><p>This was the residence of Master Qi.</p><p>A moment later, a Dao Child hurried out, bowing deeply. “Senior Mingyue, Master invites you in.”</p><p>“Thank you, young Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang replied amiably, expressing his gratitude, and was led by the Dao Child into the reception hall.</p><p>The Dao Child offered fragrant tea and spirit fruits. “Senior, please wait a moment. Master still has some matters to attend to and will be here shortly.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Please, young Daoist, attend to your duties.”</p><p>After the Dao Child left, Qin Sang sipped the fragrant tea, pondering silently.</p><p>Visiting Master Qi wasn't for commissioning a magical treasure. Qin Sang had two objectives.</p><p>The first was to inquire about the art of refining.</p><p>His lifebound spirit sword, the Yunyou Sword, had not been used since the integration of the Jiao Mu True Spirit, and he had been waiting for the Yunyou Sword to give birth to sentience.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, while Qin Sang had received some guidance and access to ancient texts, he lacked practical experience to draw upon.</p><p>Secondly, he wanted to have this master appraise the three fragmented treasures to determine their origins.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that the three fragmented treasures might have come from the Immortal Palace, and their grade was certainly not low. Revealing all of them might arouse suspicion, and he wished to avoid any potential upheaval.</p><p>With his current strength, Qin Sang wasn't as wary of the forces in Jushan as he was of the Dao Court, though he feared some factions might have connections to the Dao Court.</p><p>It would be prudent to present one item first as a test.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense probed into the Qianjun Ring, where the three fragmented treasures came into view: a sword, a drum, and a scroll.</p><p>Qin Sang valued the Chengying Sword the most. After all, he considered himself a sword cultivator, and the sword appeared to be the most intact. However, the more he valued it, the more cautious he became.</p><p>The broken drum had a hole in its surface, and it seemed that restoring the hole might repair the treasure.</p><p>As for the scroll, it depicted a boundless expanse of water, constantly flowing, emitting a murmuring sound, a phenomenon inherent to the treasure itself.</p><p>When he first acquired the treasure, Qin Sang couldn't discern its purpose, only judging from its appearance that it might be the most precious.</p><p>Now, with his cultivation far surpassing what it once was, Qin Sang had a different understanding. He suspected the scroll was the most severely damaged.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed someone approaching the hall. He withdrew his divine sense, rose, and looked towards the door. Upon seeing the newcomer, he couldn't help but be taken aback.</p><p>Such an unconventional individual was truly rare!</p><p>The newcomer was a plump Daoist with disheveled hair and a hurried demeanor.  His Daoist robe was a magical treasure with self-cleaning abilities, appearing brand new despite a large tear at the side.</p><p>Combined with the man's attire, his rotund physique didn't seem as peculiar.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't imagine how a Daoist with Nascent Soul cultivation could appear in such a state.</p><p>Some alchemists who tested medicines on themselves, or perhaps unorthodox cultivators, might end up in such a disheveled state.</p><p>The plump Daoist was the Master Qi he sought.</p><p>This individual possessed profound skills in refining, having crafted pseudo-spirit treasures that had appeared in the Jushan Assembly auctions.</p><p>Yet, when Qin Sang discerned Master Qi's cultivation level, doubts arose in his heart.</p><p>“Appearances can be deceiving.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, but he couldn't help but wonder if this person met his expectations.</p><p>“Daoist Mingyue?”</p><p>Master Qi strode into the hall, bringing a gust of wind, and squinted at Qin Sang. “I thought some old fellow was using a pseudonym to jest with me. Unexpectedly, fellow Daoist is quite unfamiliar.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed. “This humble Daoist has rarely visited Star Island’s Immortal Lake. After my recent breakthrough, I embarked on a journey and wished to refine a suitable magical treasure, hence my visit to Master.”</p><p>“So it’s a recent breakthrough… Please, be seated.”</p><p>Master Qi suddenly understood.</p><p>Given Master Qi's reputation, numerous Profound Ascension True People came to visit, but not everyone could see him personally.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn’t displayed the aura of a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, Master Qi wouldn’t have invited him in so readily.</p><p>“What magical treasure does fellow Daoist intend to refine?” Master Qi, truly dedicated to refining, didn't inquire about Qin Sang’s background, getting straight to the point.</p><p>Qin Sang, also a refiner, subtly tested Master Qi's expertise through his questions, gradually dismissing his initial dismissiveness.</p><p>This person indeed lived up to his reputation. Sometimes, a few words would enlighten Qin Sang.</p><p>After a while, Master Qi furrowed his brow. “Fellow Daoist seems to lack a concrete idea.”</p><p>Qin Sang's previous questions had been all over the place.  If Master Qi hadn't found them intriguing himself, he would have become impatient by now.</p><p>“That is why I came to consult Master.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  “This humble Daoist will be staying in Hu Zhong City for a while. There's no rush. Besides that, this humble Daoist has acquired something and wishes to seek Master’s appraisal.”</p><p>As he spoke, light flickered from the Qianjun Ring, and a wooden box appeared in Qin Sang's hand. He opened the restriction.</p><p>“This treasure was obtained by chance. I've kept it for many years, yet I haven't been able to comprehend it. Please, Master, take a look.”</p><p>Master Qi knew this was Qin Sang’s true purpose. Somewhat surprised, he became intrigued, his gaze fixed on the wooden box.</p><p>Through their earlier exchange, Master Qi had discerned that Qin Sang wasn't entirely ignorant of refining.</p><p>Those questions were likely a test. What kind of treasure warranted such caution?</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The wooden box opened, and the sound of flowing water filled the hall.</p><p>Immediately, a scroll flew out of the box and hovered in mid-air. Its shape was irregular, with five corners.</p><p>The entire scroll was covered with a flowing surface of water, as if a section had been cut from a river, with neither source nor end in sight.</p><p>“Splash! Splash! Splash!”</p><p>The sound of flowing water echoed through the hall.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Master Qi stared intently at the scroll, seemingly entranced. He abruptly turned to Qin Sang, his voice urgent. “Could this humble Daoist hold it for a closer look?”</p><p>He knew the etiquette and refrained from asking about the treasure’s origins.</p><p>“Certainly.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, anticipation building within him. This person seemed to have recognized something.</p><p>Master Qi raised his right hand, and the scroll flew towards him on its own.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He sensed that Master Qi was employing some sort of secret technique, an invisible wave enveloping the scroll.</p><p>As the scroll landed in Master Qi's palm, beams of white light shot out from his hand, quickly forming a white mist that enveloped the scroll.</p><p>Unmindful of the stranger beside him, Master Qi closed his eyes, completely absorbed, his entire mind immersed in the white mist.</p><p>Qin Sang sipped his spirit tea, calmly observing Master Qi’s actions.</p><p>Master Qi made several hand seals and then sat motionless. The white mist and scroll hung before him, the mist swirling, the scroll appearing and disappearing within, rising and falling erratically.</p><p>After a while, Master Qi changed his hand seals, the scroll alternately rolling into a scroll and unfurling.</p><p>Qin Sang gradually discerned something. The mist contained a peculiar power, and Master Qi was attempting to manipulate this power to penetrate the scroll, a rather sophisticated secret technique of refining.</p><p>Unfortunately, the seemingly gentle flowing water repelled Master Qi’s attempts.  No matter how many hand seals he changed, they were deflected by the flowing water.</p><p>However, Master Qi hadn’t gained nothing. The mist gradually gathered towards the edges of the scroll, forming a misty ring.</p><p>Subsequently, the changes in the mist became increasingly subtle.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.</p><p>Master Qi suddenly exhaled deeply, withdrawing his focus.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Master Qi had exhausted his methods, yet the scroll remained unchanged.  Had he failed?</p><p>“Master, have you discerned anything?” Qin Sang inquired eagerly.</p><p>Master Qi pondered.  “This humble Daoist isn’t entirely certain, however…”</p><p>He paused, then abruptly changed his tone, asking Qin Sang, “Does fellow Daoist know what happens when a magical treasure gives birth to a spirit embryo and becomes a spirit treasure, and then continues to increase in grade?”</p><p>Qin Sang naturally knew. The spirit embryo Master Qi mentioned should be what he understood as sentience. After sentience was born, it would naturally nurture a tool spirit.</p><p>“The birth of a tool spirit?”</p><p>“That’s only one aspect.”</p><p>Master Qi nodded. “This humble Daoist was fortunate enough to read an ancient text which recorded that after achieving spirit treasure status, one can choose to help the spirit treasure nurture a tool spirit, which is further divided into innate and acquired.”</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively. This was a secret concerning realms beyond spirit treasures.</p><p>Although he only possessed one spirit treasure.</p><p>Since he had brought it up, Master Qi decided to explain in detail. “The distinction between innate and acquired is based on the origins of the treasure and the tool spirit. Treasures refined by cultivators are called acquired spirit nurturing treasures, or acquired spirit treasures. Legend has it that there are innately born spirit treasures, born with spirit embryos, their tool spirits nurtured by heaven and earth. These are called innate spirit embryo treasures, or innate spirit treasures. As for the other differences between innate and acquired spirit treasures, they are beyond this humble Daoist’s knowledge…”</p><p>Master Qi continued.  “Besides these, there’s another branch, known as True Treasures.”</p><p>“True Treasures?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression turned contemplative.</p><p>“Indeed. It is said that at the moment a tool spirit is about to be born, it can be forcefully interrupted with immense divine power, and the spirit embryo can be completely refined into the spirit treasure. This is how a True Treasure is created.”</p><p>At this point, Master Qi’s expression became one of awe.  “When I first learned of this secret, this humble Daoist was astonished for quite some time, believing it to be a waste of a precious resource. But according to the ancient text, True Treasures are not inferior to acquired spirit treasures, and in some aspects, they may even be superior. Beyond spirit treasures, innate spirit treasures, acquired spirit treasures, and True Treasures are said to each have their own unique qualities…”</p><p>As for the specific differences between the three supreme treasures, Master Qi couldn’t elaborate, as he hadn’t reached that realm.</p><p>Qin Sang also understood.  Perhaps the Dao Court possessed related ancient texts and inheritances within their archives, but Master Qi, not being a member of the Dao Court, lacked the qualifications to access them.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly composed himself, gazing at the scroll with astonishment.  “Could it be that this humble Daoist has stumbled upon a great opportunity? Is this one of the three supreme treasures?”</p><p>“Most likely a True Treasure fragment…”</p><p>Master Qi hesitated.  “When intact, it was likely a Spirit Map, a banner, or a cloud robe of some kind.”</p><p>“A True Treasure fragment?”</p><p>Disappointment flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes. He had thought it was a damaged True Treasure, but a damaged True Treasure and a True Treasure fragment were two different concepts.</p><p>He stared at the scroll.  He hadn’t expected such a prestigious origin. It seemed the Wuxiang Immortal Sect had explored the Immortal Palace quite deeply back then.</p><p>Among the treasures he had obtained from the Immortal Palace, the scroll, the Chengying Sword, and the broken drum were the most conspicuous.</p><p>“Could the other two also be True Treasures?”</p><p>Excitement surged through Qin Sang. He feigned agitation, looking at Master Qi. “Master, is there any way to repair this treasure?”</p><p>Master Qi forced a smile.  “Fellow Daoist overestimates this humble Daoist. Not to mention a True Treasure fragment, even a slightly damaged True Treasure is beyond my capabilities. To be honest, this humble Daoist’s lifelong ambition is merely to refine a spirit treasure.”</p><p>At this point, Master Qi, who had been hesitant to speak, finally couldn't contain himself.  Disregarding etiquette, he asked repeatedly, “Could fellow Daoist tell this humble Daoist where you obtained this treasure?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated before replying. “This humble Daoist obtained it by chance while traveling in the depths of the Nie Yuan. Seeing its mystical qualities, I brought it back, never expecting such a shocking origin.”</p><p>This was a pre-prepared excuse.</p><p>The Nie Yuan and Nie Hai were dangerous and mysterious, and it wasn't uncommon for people to find opportunities there.</p><p>Master Qi didn’t doubt him, pondering.  “Fellow Daoist likely encountered the site of a battle between Grand True People of the Dao Court, or perhaps even legendary True Monarchs. Only they possess the ability to refine and shatter True Treasures.”</p><p>Qin Sang then held the scroll, examining it closely, sighing softly.  “So, this treasure not only cannot be repaired, but even refining it anew for other purposes is also a hopeless endeavor.”</p><p>“This humble Daoist is indeed unable to do so. If fellow Daoist can invite a senior expert from the Dao Court, perhaps they could offer some guidance,” Master Qi shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>Visiting a senior expert of the Dao Court was definitely on his agenda for the future.</p><p>Since it was a True Treasure fragment, the risk of attracting covetous gazes was much smaller.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, flipping his palm to put away the scroll.</p><p>Master Qi became anxious. “Fellow Daoist, wait!”</p><p>“What urgent matter does Master have?” A smile played on Qin Sang’s lips.</p><p>In the cultivation world, those who devoted themselves to external paths, like those pursuing the path of immortality, were all obsessed.</p><p>He could lure Master Lingxu with Witch Clan pill formulas, and he could also lure Master Qi with True Treasure fragments.</p><p>This method had never failed him. He wasn't afraid that they wouldn't take the bait.</p><p>As expected, Master Qi rubbed his hands, cautiously saying, “Since fellow Daoist will be staying in Hu Zhong City for a while, could you lend this treasure to this humble Daoist for a closer look? Although this humble Daoist cannot refine it, comprehending it would be greatly beneficial… This humble Daoist would be eternally grateful.”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned hesitation.  “This humble Daoist is happy to witness Master’s cultivation progress.  It would be a boon for our Jushan cultivators.”</p><p>Master Qi’s face lit up with joy.</p><p>However, Qin Sang’s tone shifted.  “But…”</p><p>As Master Qi looked on with apprehension, Qin Sang continued unhurriedly, “To be honest, this humble Daoist is also quite interested in the art of refining, but unfortunately, I lack a proper teacher and am limited in my knowledge. When Master comprehends this treasure, could you allow this humble Daoist to observe and provide a brief explanation?  Also, this humble Daoist intends to take on a disciple and greatly admires the renowned sects of Star Island’s Immortal Lake.  I wish to secure a discipleship qualification for my disciple.  Could Master recommend me when the time comes?”</p><p>For Master Qi, only the first condition posed a dilemma.</p><p>The sects of Star Island’s Immortal Lake had all tried to recruit Master Qi, and he had some connections with most of them.  Securing a discipleship qualification wasn’t difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang’s request wasn’t simply asking him to share his insights. Comprehending a True Treasure required specific Daoist techniques, and explaining the intricacies would inevitably involve the core essence of Master Qi’s inheritance, almost akin to instructing a personal disciple.</p><p>He was essentially stealing his teachings in broad daylight.</p><p>However, the allure of a True Treasure was too great!</p><p>Master Qi ultimately succumbed to temptation.  “As fellow Daoist wishes! However, let us be clear. How much fellow Daoist can ultimately comprehend, I cannot guarantee.”</p><p>“That depends on whether this humble Daoist’s comprehension is high or low.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, handing over the scroll.</p>
