<h1>Chapter 1109: Old Acquaintances</h1><p>Emerald Bright Mountain.</p><p>Long ago, when Qin Sang first arrived here, he felt a sense of belonging to this world for the very first time at the Green Goat Temple on Emerald Bright Mountain. That period of time remains unforgettable to this day. Who could have imagined that such a small temple would produce so many cultivators?</p><p>Now, as Qin Sang approached the mountain, he noticed that the Green Goat Temple had built a new Taoist temple, inhabited by mortal priests. The original site, however, was concealed by a hidden spiritual formation, likely left behind by Wandering Cloud or Li Yufu.</p><p>After Wu Chuanzong's death, he was buried on Emerald Bright Mountain. Qin Sang found his grave, paid his respects, and then walked to the spiritual formation. Just as he was about to forcefully break through the formation, a sudden thought struck him, and a hint of joy appeared on his face. He merely sent a strand of true essence into the formation.</p><p>Then, with his hands behind his back, he stood motionless, as if waiting for someone.</p><p>Not long after, a streak of light appeared on the horizon, swift as a shooting star, racing toward him. In the blink of an eye, the light arrived, and before it even touched the ground, a voice cried out in surprise, "Uncle-Master!"</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The figure descended in front of Qin Sang, revealing himself.</p><p>It was Li Yufu!</p><p>"Uncle-Master! You're still alive!" Li Yufu's face was filled with joy and excitement, as if he couldn't believe his eyes.</p><p>Over a hundred years had passed without a single word. They had thought Qin Sang had long since perished.</p><p>"Yufu, it's been many years. You've already formed your Golden Core, and your cultivation is almost catching up to mine," Qin Sang said as he looked Li Yufu over.</p><p>Reuniting with an old friend brought him immense joy.</p><p>Li Yufu had a dual spiritual root talent and had received meticulous guidance from Wandering Cloud. Qin Sang wasn't surprised that he had formed his Golden Core.</p><p>"Uncle-Master, Grandmaster and I searched for you for so long! Where have you been?" Li Yufu's voice was tinged with excitement.</p><p>Even in the Cold Domain, there were still people who cared about him. Qin Sang felt a wave of emotion. "It's a long story. Open the spiritual formation, and let's go inside to talk..."</p><p>The two of them entered the Green Goat Temple.</p><p>"I went to the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect first, but none of you were there. Where have you been cultivating? Is your Grandmaster with you?" Qin Sang asked in rapid succession.</p><p>"We found an excellent spiritual vein downstream of the Wuling River and established a cave there. I sensed an opportunity to form my Golden Core, so I stayed there to cultivate. After successfully forming my core, I continued to seclude myself, rarely venturing out. Grandmaster isn't at the caveâ€”he went to the Demon Realm a few years ago. Unfortunately, I don't know how to contact him. If Grandmaster knew you had returned safely, he would be overjoyed..."</p><p>Li Yufu answered everything without hesitation.</p><p>"He went to the Demon Realm again?" Qin Sang was surprised. "Why is your Grandmaster so fond of the Demon Realm?"</p><p>"Grandmaster has never mentioned anything about the Demon Realm to me," Li Yufu shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a while but couldn't make sense of it. He would have to wait until he saw Wandering Cloud to understand the reason.</p><p>"Back then, I was threatened by Dongyang Bo and forced to flee. I was afraid of implicating you, so I didn't dare to contact your Grandmaster. Unexpectedly, the journey back was fraught with difficulties. It was only recently that I found an opportunity to return..." Qin Sang said lightly.</p><p>"No wonder! After returning from the Purple Micro Palace, Shaohua Mountain became tight-lipped about you. It turns out Dongyang Bo wanted to harm you. Grandmaster infiltrated the area near Shaohua Mountain and investigated for a long time but couldn't find any news about you. Later, he almost set up a scheme to kidnap Dongyang Bo's disciple, Qiu Mubai, to interrogate him!" Li Yufu said indignantly.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. He hadn't expected Wandering Cloud to go so far as to nearly kidnap Qiu Mubai in order to find him. Qiu Mubai was Dongyang Bo's most valued disciple. One could imagine the immense risk involved in such an act.</p><p>"Grandmaster went to great lengths for me. Did he end up taking action?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Li Yufu shook his head. "Later, Grandmaster seemed to have accidentally come into contact with a fellow disciple of yours named Mu Yifeng and learned something, so he gave up the plan."</p><p>"How is Mu Yifeng doing?" Qin Sang asked with a hint of joy.</p><p>The two people he most wanted to see upon his return were Wandering Cloud and Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Back then, Mu Yifeng had let him go. Although they had put on an act in the end, it was unlikely they could have fooled the eyes of a Nascent Soul Ancestor. Qin Sang had been worried that Mu Yifeng would suffer Dongyang Bo's wrath.</p><p>Li Yufu thought for a moment and said, "I remember Grandmaster mentioning that Mu Yifeng had already formed his Golden Core at the time. But since then, he has rarely appeared, and we haven't heard any news about him."</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow slightly but felt somewhat relieved.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu had once said that Dongyang Bo valued the sect highly. Since he hadn't taken his anger out on Mu Yifeng in the Purple Micro Palace, and Mu Yifeng had successfully broken through to become a rare Golden Core combatant, there was no reason for Dongyang Bo to settle scores afterward.</p><p>"The Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect profited greatly from the war and has been flourishing. The spiritual veins within the sect must be far superior to the ones you found yourselves. Why have you stayed in this remote wilderness to cultivate instead of returning to the sect? Did you have some disagreement with the sect?" Qin Sang asked curiously, changing the subject.</p><p>Li Yufu shook his head. "Grandmaster deliberately kept his distance from the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect. I have always been a nominal disciple of the sect, never formally joining. After the Sin Abyss invasion, Grandmaster voluntarily entered the battlefield and made great contributions to repay the sect. After that, he brought me here and rarely returned. I once heard Grandmaster say that he wanted me to focus on cultivation and, once my cultivation reached a certain level, to continue the legacy of the Green Goat Temple."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised. Wandering Cloud also wanted to establish his own sect, and their thoughts aligned.</p><p>"What is Grandmaster's current cultivation level?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Li Yufu's face was filled with admiration and reverence. "Grandmaster formed his Golden Core in the Purple Micro Palace. After returning, his cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds. He broke through to the peak of the Golden Core stage many years ago and has been refining his cultivation ever since. It shouldn't be difficult for him to form his Nascent Soul."</p><p>"This..." Qin Sang didn't know what to say. Wandering Cloud had truly not disappointed him.</p><p>He had thought his own cultivation speed was impressive, but Wandering Cloud's progress was even more astonishing. In just over a hundred years, he was on the verge of forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p>This was good. The sooner Wandering Cloud formed his Nascent Soul, the sooner he could help Qin Sang refine the Tribulation Alleviation Pill.</p><p>As they spoke, a streak of light flew toward Emerald Bright Mountain.</p><p>Li Yufu was about to reprimand the newcomers when Qin Sang stopped him. "These two are descendants of my old acquaintances. I've brought them along to serve me. Since I don't have a place to stay for now, let them cultivate with you for the time being."</p><p>"Understood!" Li Yufu readily agreed.</p><p>"Uncle-Master!"</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Tan Yien and Bai Hanqiu entered the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang introduced them to each other, feeling both amused and exasperated. Among his companions, one was at the Golden Core stage, one at the Foundation Establishment stage, and one at the Qi Refining stage. Their cultivation levels were vastly different. According to the rules of some sects, seniority was determined by cultivation level. But because of Qin Sang, they could only treat each other as equals.</p><p>"Uncle-Master, the situation in the Great Sui Dynasty has stabilized. The current emperor voluntarily abdicated the throne to the Qin family, and the rogue cultivators are willing to stay in the capital to assist the new emperor. Unfortunately, after thoroughly investigating the Qin family and other clans, I found no young descendants with spiritual roots," Tan Yien reported meticulously.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu glanced at Tan Yien, hesitating to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang made no comment and said indifferently, "Enough. Now that you've entered the path of immortality, don't involve yourselves too much in worldly affairs, especially you, Hanqiu. I have important matters to attend to. You can stay here for now. Yufu's guidance will be more than sufficient for you."</p>
