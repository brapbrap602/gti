<h1>Chapter 1608:  A Lack of Manpower</h1><p>Liuzhou Hall headquarters.</p><p>Following a disturbance caused by Gui Mu, security at Liuzhou Hall was extremely tight.  Jiang You, who was supposed to attend a grand auction, dared not leave the headquarters.</p><p>Someone entered the courtyard. Jiang You looked over and saw Jiang Mu.  "Still no news of Elder Qin?"</p><p>"Elder Qin likely hasn't returned to Hong City yet," Jiang Mu shook his head, hesitating slightly. "The thief might be connected to Elder Qin. If the losses are manageable, we could consider..."</p><p>Jiang You sighed, "Other treasures are secondary. One of them was specifically requested by the Enforcement Elder of the Qiongying Sect. It should have been delivered directly, but it was sent to Hong City to bolster the exchange. You know the Hall Master has some connections with the Qiongying Sect; they've secretly helped us through several difficult situations. Losing this treasure will be hard to explain."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Jiang Mu was also stumped.</p><p>Jiang You handed him a jade slip. "The grand auction is about to begin. Go to the main peak first.  Acquire as many of the listed treasures as possible. I'll wait for Elder Qin here."</p><p>"Yes!" Jiang Mu left to carry out his orders.</p><p>Shortly after Jiang Mu's departure, the barrier was triggered. Jiang You quickly rose to greet the arrival.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly entered the headquarters. Upon seeing Jiang You, he presented several jade boxes, smiling. "Mission accomplished!"</p><p>Gui Mu's theft was merely a ploy to draw Qin Sang out and verify his identity. The treasures of Liuzhou Hall were not worthy of her attention and were all returned.</p><p>Jiang You breathed a sigh of relief. Without inquiring about the thief's identity, he only took the item requested by the Qiongying Sect elder, offering the rest to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang declined. Looking around, he asked, "Hall Master Mu hasn't arrived yet?"</p><p>Jiang You nodded. "The Hall Master sent word that matters in the East Sea are proving troublesome and will delay him for a few days. He'll definitely be back before the treasure exchange."</p><p>Too late!</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly. Waiting for Hall Master Mu in Hong City was impossible.</p><p>His journey to Nan Prefecture would be a solo one.</p><p>The remnants of Baxian Pavilion and Wuxiang Immortal Sect were both suspicious, at odds with each other. He sought the remains of a Nascent Soul cultivator and the associated cultivation techniques.  He wasn't in conflict with either party, but unforeseen circumstances were possible, making a companion advisable.</p><p>He and Hall Master Mu were far from being sworn brothers, but cooperation was still possible for ordinary situations.</p><p>"Has Ganlu Zen Monastery made any moves?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards the main peak.</p><p>According to Gui Mu, the Pavilion Master of Baxian Pavilion was an imposter, and top experts from Ganlu Zen Monastery, including Master Xingji, were all in Hong City.</p><p>Whether this was to cooperate with Baxian Pavilion, to mislead the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, or if Ganlu Zen Monastery was unaware, was unclear. Qin Sang leaned towards the latter.</p><p>Both Buddhist and Daoist sects surely had their own agendas.</p><p>As far as Qin Sang knew, Taiyue Sect and Baxian Pavilion had close ties, with rumors suggesting Taiyue Sect was secretly fostered by Baxian Pavilion. Similar rumors circulated about Wan Du Mountain and Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>Baxian Pavilion probably felt confident in dealing with the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and didn't need the Buddhist sect to share the spoils.</p><p>Jiang You mistook Qin Sang's question for one about the Ullambana Festival. "The festival proceedings remain the same, with only minor adjustments. On the third day of the festival, the inter-sect competition involving Yuan Ying cultivators will take place. The outcome will directly influence the central state's layout for the next five hundred years. It will certainly be a fierce struggle."</p><p>Qin Sang had considered that, involving the Immortal Palace and cultivation techniques, it was best to avoid making things public knowledge.</p><p>When two tigers fight, the third party benefits.</p><p>With Baxian Pavilion and the Wuxiang Immortal Sect at odds, he would seize his opportunity.</p><p>With too many factions involved, countless people vying for limited opportunities, the situation would inevitably spin out of control, descending into chaos, while other forces would more or less find trustworthy allies.</p><p>The waters of the Central State run deep!</p><p>"I have other urgent matters and cannot participate in the treasure exchange. I'll apologize to Hall Master Mu another time," Qin Sang bowed and left hurriedly.</p><p>"Elder Qin... what was that about...?"</p><p>Jiang You was completely baffled but couldn't stop Qin Sang. He hastily summoned subordinates to investigate any significant recent events in the Central State.</p><p>Flying out of Hong City, Qin Sang flew south without stopping.</p><p>He arrived near Zhuozhou.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time, judging it sufficient. He released his physical body and created a cave dwelling in the mountains, sending his clone instead.</p><p>The clone flew to the gate of Buling Mountain, beneath the former White Cloud Waterfall.</p><p>The Ullambana Festival was imminent, yet Buling Mountain remained inactive.</p><p>Looking up at the boundless void, the clone summoned the Snow Stepping Divine Blade, wielding it in a soaring strike. The blade energy filled the sky, like vast waves, majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p>The blade energy shot into the heavens, visible for thousands of miles.</p><p>Lu Zhang had obtained the Stone Toad a hundred years ago.  He should have refined it by now. If his breakthrough was successful, he could be a strong reinforcement.</p><p>Unlike last time, this involved a struggle for the Immortal Palace, so, even though it was presumptuous, he had to use this method to invite them to join.</p><p>The blade energy lingered.</p><p>A point of light suddenly appeared in the void, growing into an opening, from which a man and a woman flew out, looking down in surprise and doubt.</p><p>“Excuse me, is Daoist Qingfeng from Fuyu Prefecture here?”</p><p>“It is I,” Huasheng nodded, confirming someone was indeed guarding the mountain.</p><p>“Greetings to Senior Qingfeng.” The two bowed.</p><p>Huasheng said without hesitation, “Quickly inform Master Situ and Elder Lu. I have urgent business.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The two exchanged glances. Seeing Huasheng’s unwavering tone, they ceased further argument and flew back to Xiaguang Cave.</p><p>Shortly after, figures flickered within Xiaguang Cave, and a person flew out, followed by a man and a woman, their expressions respectful.</p><p>The newcomer wore a Daoist robe and held a whisk; he looked unfamiliar.</p><p>“I am Cheng Shenzi. Greetings, Daoist Qingfeng.”</p><p>So it was him!</p><p>Huasheng returned the bow, exchanged a few pleasantries, then said gravely, “Master Situ and Daoist Lu are unable to meet personally?”  He understood the situation upon seeing Cheng Shenzi.</p><p>Cheng Shenzi glanced north and said, “The Ullambana Festival is approaching, and our sect remains closed.  Daoist Qingfeng should understand that this closure isn't merely a pretense; it's unavoidable.  Master Situ and Junior Brother Lu are both in secluded cultivation, at a critical juncture, and cannot be disturbed.  If you have any matter, I can only convey it on their behalf. Once they achieve their breakthrough, they will certainly come to Pushan to apologize personally.”</p><p>With that said, Huasheng didn't press further, apologized for the intrusion, and returned the way he came.</p><p>This is the drawback of focusing on cultivation and neglecting social interactions.  One only regrets a lack of connections when in need.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not regret it.  Without his dedicated cultivation, he wouldn't have reached his current level.</p><p>Failing to find reinforcements, he would venture into the dragon's lair alone!</p><p>Upon Huasheng's return, the original body was frowning, lost in thought.</p><p>The Gu God Sect choosing this time to act was truly inopportune.</p><p>Given more time, Qin Sang could achieve a comprehensive improvement: the original body refining the demonic fire, the second body breaking through, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly advancing—a significant increase in power!</p><p>Yet, he was stuck at this awkward stage, neither strong enough nor weak enough, making it the most difficult time.</p><p>Divine abilities cannot be achieved overnight.</p><p>Qin Sang had to find another way.</p><p>His strength was certainly not weak among cultivators of the same level, but he wasn't arrogant enough to believe himself invincible.  Against the Eight Scenery Sect Master, Purple Thunder True Person alone, Qin Sang needed to be cautious.</p><p>After much deliberation,</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly summoned the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The cave brightened suddenly, filled with firelight.</p><p>Since advancing to the late Yuan Ying stage, the original body had devoted almost all his energy to the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. Recently, he absorbed half of the Near-Dragon Saliva and had started refining the demonic fire essence; his spiritual sense had also made significant progress.</p><p>Although he hadn't broken through yet, the strength of his spiritual sense was unmatched among his peers!</p><p>The Sun God Tree floated before Qin Sang. Flames flowed between the Sun God Birds.  Beneath their adorable exteriors lay terrifying energy.</p><p>After staring at the birds for a while,</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision. A black light flashed from his brow, and the fire lotus slowly flew out.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, using only a small portion of his mind to maintain the fire lotus, while connecting most of his mind to the Sun God Tree, beginning his attempt.</p><p>Not long after, the fire lotus stopped rotating.  Petal by petal, it unfolded, transforming into streams of fire that flowed around the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang acted, completing hundreds of hand seals in an instant. The power of the fire lotus carefully approached the Sun God Birds, at an extremely slow speed.</p><p>Qin Sang could already control three birds simultaneously.  This time, he targeted six.</p><p>He knew he couldn't do it alone. Controlling the Sun God Birds through the fire lotus was a clever tactic, but he wasn't confident.</p><p>The fire lotus quickly enveloped six birds.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang focused his mind, he heard a series of “bangs” as the fire lotus's power was shattered by the Nanming Li Fire.  It was indeed too much.</p><p>Undeterred, he continued to try, his true energy rapidly depleting.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang had to stop to regulate his breathing.</p><p>He made some progress, but coordinating the fire lotus, spiritual sense, and true energy was crucial. As Qin Sang summarized his failures, he cultivated to recover.</p><p>During this respite,</p><p>Qin Sang took out the fat silkworm's poison pearl.</p><p>Sensing the fat silkworm's aura, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly flew out of his dantian, landing on Qin Sang's shoulder, snuggling close, its wings folded, its mood clearly low.</p><p>It and the fat silkworm had always disliked each other, constantly clashing. Now, separated, they missed each other.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at his waist.</p><p>The corpse puppet bag was empty.</p><p>Ya Gu and the fat silkworm had been his companions for five hundred years, now both gone.</p><p>The fat silkworm was lazy, but reliable in crucial moments.  Sometimes, the fat silkworm's jokes were a few rare moments of ease on his lonely path.</p><p>Leaving the poison pearl would be a memento.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, using his spiritual sense to probe inside the poison pearl.  Even Gui Mu didn't know how to use this pearl; Qin Sang could only explore it himself.</p><p>Recalling the scene of Gui Mu extracting the poison pearl from the fat silkworm, Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>He wondered if it was due to the silkworm's unique bloodline, or if it applied to all spirit insects.  This only strengthened Qin Sang's resolve to keep the Heaven-Eye Butterfly safe!</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  When he used his spiritual sense to investigate the poison pearl, he sensed a faint connection between himself and it.</p><p>How could he have a connection with the fat silkworm's poison pearl?</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.  He carefully sensed it again, confirming that the connection was real, not an illusion!</p><p>"Because of the fat silkworm's final bite?"</p><p>Qin Sang bent a finger; the wound had long healed.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang stored the poison pearl in his dantian and continued to sense it. The connection became clearer; he could easily control the poison pearl without needing to refine it.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>With a thought, a seven-colored halo burst from Qin Sang's body, forming an armor that covered his entire body – the extremely familiar Detoxification Armor!</p><p>The Detoxification Armor still worked!</p><p>After the poison pearl separated from the silkworm, had the armor's strength changed?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, continuing his experiments. He finally discovered that the fat silkworm had indeed only this one ability.</p><p>"I'll raise some poisonous Gu insects later and try if the poison pearl can still absorb poison. If it can still grow, it's truly a treasure. I'll have to thank them properly next time I see them…"</p><p>The things in his dantian were accumulating.</p><p>His Nascent Soul sat cross-legged, with the Earth-Slaying Sword lying flat on his knees.  The poison pearl floated before his Nascent Soul, emitting a faint seven-colored glow. The Heaven-Eye Butterfly returned to his dantian, resting on his Nascent Soul's shoulder.</p><p>"Like a Daoist with many treasures!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, dismissing his distracting thoughts, and continued to try controlling the Solar God Tree.  His distraction had actually given him new inspiration.</p><p>After repeated adjustments…</p><p>In the cave, demonic fire and Nanming Li fire flickered alternately, their brightness fluctuating.</p><p>Suddenly, joy flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, but his expression became extremely serious as he stared intently at the Solar God Tree.</p><p>The flames on the Solar God Tree leaped erratically.  The six divine birds enveloped by the fire lotus power's flames solidified, then trembled in unison!</p><p>At the same moment, the true energy within Qin Sang surged out like a dam breaking!  The sheer force startled him.</p><p>"Hiss…"</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, shocked.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the cave, his face beaming, heading directly south.</p><p>The journey was long.  Boats and flying artifacts were too slow. Qin Sang didn't stint on his true energy, flying through the air, leaving Zhuo Prefecture, crossing the six prefectures of Jiangzuo, flying over countless mountains and rivers, almost without stopping.</p><p>Taiyue Gate was in sight…</p><p>…</p><p>East Sea.</p><p>Chi Nan Island Chain.</p><p>Originally an obscure place, its fame exploded over the past hundred years or so.  The successive appearances of the Wuwang Palace attracted the attention of countless cultivators, giving rise to numerous legends that are still talked about today.</p><p>The period surrounding the first appearance of the Wuwang Palace was the most lively time for the Chi Nan Island Chain, with various factions and unparalleled experts appearing one after another.</p><p>Until Su Zinan reopened the Wuwang Palace, the Chi Nan Island Chain's prosperity declined.</p><p>Everyone knew that the Wuwang Palace was there, a legendary immortal palace with countless opportunities.  However, those who couldn't enter it were wasting their time. Even powerful cultivators like Su Zinan could only flee from the Gray Tide; for others, it was tantamount to suicide.</p><p>The fervor subsided, and most people left.</p><p>The sun blazed.</p><p>The sky was cloudless.</p><p>The sea was calm, windless, and sweltering.</p><p>A few treasure ships drifted on the sea, having found nothing. Even the most persistent treasure hunters were weary.</p><p>Without warning, a sudden clap of thunder shook the heavens and earth!</p><p>The cultivators on the treasure ships' faces changed, and they rushed out of the cabins. Seeing the sight in the sky, they were both shocked and delighted.</p><p>At some point, the sky had become gloomy, a gray whirlwind sweeping across the heavens.</p><p>Giant waves surged, and the treasure ships rocked violently.</p><p>The people remained unmoved, staring blankly at the sky.</p><p>The wind intensified.</p><p>The sun was obscured by the wind, the light growing dimmer.  Wave after wave relentlessly crashed against the treasure ships, creating an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>When darkness completely enveloped the sea area, thunder roared.</p><p>From the heart of the whirlwind, silver lightning suddenly pierced the darkness, bringing with it an even more terrifying spectacle.</p><p>In an instant, the thunder poured down like rain, terrifying to the extreme, capable of tearing apart everything in the world!</p><p>At this sight, the people on the treasure ships no longer had any thoughts of treasure hunting; they were all panicked.</p><p>Suddenly, someone pointed into the depths of the thunder and shouted.</p><p>"There's someone there!"</p>
