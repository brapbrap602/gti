<h1>Chapter 298: Guardian Beasts</h1><p>Yun Youzi relayed not only the path to break the restrictions, but also the status of Luo Xingnan's group and the situation within the mountain.  Two lives were lost to achieve this. One was Wu Chen, the other, a man surnamed Yin.  Desperate to survive, Yin readily betrayed Sheng Yuanzi, acting ruthlessly and decisively. This, however, made the others even more wary of him, and so when Luo Xingnan forced him to scout ahead, no one spoke up for him. Yun Youzi could do nothing about it.  Their available manpower dwindled, while Luo Xingnan's side remained at full strength.</p><p>Thanks to Yun Youzi's intel, Qin Sang and Ge Yuan's progress was much smoother than Luo Xingnan's group. However, Yun Youzi hadn't entered the mountain itself. Had they waited for Yun Youzi's further report, they might have missed out entirely.  Therefore, the final two layers of restrictions had to be breached by Qin Sang and Ge Yuan alone.</p><p>Though fraught with peril, they managed to navigate the restrictions and reach the foot of the mountain.  They were met with a scene shrouded in swirling clouds and mist, identical to what they'd observed from the outside.  Engulfed by the fog, unlike their previous vantage point, they couldn't see the glow of the spirit herbs, relying solely on memory to recall their locations.  However, neither Qin Sang nor Ge Yuan acted rashly.</p><p>[Announcement: Our official account will be giving out cash and reward points daily. Follow to claim yours.

He extended his divine sense into the thick fog, reaching its limit, but still found no trace of restrictions. Luo Xingnan and his group were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"This…" Ge Yuan, equally astonished, voiced his disbelief, "Could it be... that this truly is the cave master's herb garden?  Protected only by restrictions at the foot of the mountain, with no other defenses?  The spirit herbs… are free for the taking?"</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Ge Yuan's expressions darkened. This was completely different from their expectations. They'd anticipated further layers of restrictions within the mountain, making collecting the herbs a difficult task.  Only then would they have a chance to claim their share.  But now, they found no formations or restrictions, the spirit herbs seemingly there for anyone to pick. Even for a towering mountain, it would take a cultivator mere moments to reach the top.  Twenty-one spirit herbs in total. Perhaps Luo Xingnan and his group had already plundered them all!</p><p>Ge Yuan's face was etched with frustration.  After enduring countless hardships and treacherous schemes, having come this far with the spirit herbs within reach, only to return empty-handed, anyone would be bitter.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Ge Yuan shot towards the mountain. Qin Sang, equally swift, ignored Ge Yuan and headed straight for the location of the Primordial Yellow Qi. The Profound-Veined Yellow Essence was of paramount importance to him.  If that spirit herb wasn't the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, so be it, but if it was, he wouldn't give up easily.  Yun Youzi had mentioned that few truly understood the effects of the Profound Harmony Pill, most believing it only served to restore foundations. Among cultivators, very few suffered from damaged foundations. He didn't know who had obtained the herb, but perhaps a trade was possible.</p><p>They had barely traveled three meters when a deafening roar erupted from above.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The earth-shattering sound was followed by a violent tremor that shook the entire mountain.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>The sound of shattering rock echoed.  Then, a piercing shriek tore through the air.  The shriek was incredibly sharp, filled with rage and savagery, like a demonic sound capable of penetrating eardrums. Despite the distance, it was still incredibly unpleasant to hear.</p><p>Simultaneous with the shriek were several shouts, one of which belonged to Luo Xingnan!</p><p>Chaos erupted on the mountaintop.</p><p>The fluctuations of clashing spiritual power rippled outwards, violently disturbing the clouds and mist.</p><p>Similar shrieks followed, though none as powerful as the first.  Mixed together, they created a terrifying cacophony, making Luo Xingnan's shouts sound weak and faint. Their opponents were clearly some kind of demonic beasts, not only numerous but also powerful.  Judging by their increasingly frantic cries, they didn't seem to have the upper hand.</p><p>However, without witnessing the battle firsthand, it was impossible to ascertain the true situation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ge Yuan stopped abruptly, exchanging glances filled with surprise and uncertainty, but mostly relief. They both thought of the Hook Snakes guarding the entrance. No wonder there were no restrictions on the mountain; there were guardian beasts here as well. This was good news. Luo Xingnan's group was clearly entangled with the guardian beasts, meaning the spirit herbs hadn't been taken yet.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, can you tell what kind of beasts they are?" Ge Yuan transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently.  Countless types of demonic beasts existed, making identification by sound alone difficult. He shook his head.  "I can't tell, but they must be ferocious.  I hear Yun Youzi's voice, he's engaged with them too!"</p><p>Yun Youzi, usually calm and collected, was now shouting, likely sending them a signal.</p><p>"Gather the herbs!" Ge Yuan made a swift decision.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's group and the beasts were preoccupied with each other, presenting a perfect opportunity.  If not now, when?</p><p>As Ge Yuan darted towards a spirit herb he remembered, Qin Sang stopped him.  "Yun Youzi and I analyzed the light.  Its brightness likely corresponds to the herb's quality.  Most of the faint glows are at the foot of the mountain.  The most valuable ones are at the summit. The situation can change in an instant. Don't waste time down here."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang flew towards the peak.</p><p>Ge Yuan listened to the sounds from the summit again.  Was it his imagination, or were the beasts' cries indeed weakening?  Regardless, he knew Qin Sang was right and quickly followed.</p><p>They concealed their auras as best they could, flying at top speed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ge, did Yun Youzi mention which herb he needs?" Qin Sang asked urgently.</p><p>Yun Youzi was now trapped by the guardian beasts.</p><p>After obtaining the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, Qin Sang intended to help Yun Youzi collect his needed herb. After all, Yun Youzi had played a crucial role in getting them this far.  He couldn't just abandon him.</p><p>"I don't know," Ge Yuan shook his head, then his gaze fixed on the area ahead to the left.  "I recall a spirit herb's aura over there, one of the brightest!"  He sped past Qin Sang towards it.</p><p>*I'll have to look for any soul-restoring herbs later.  Fortunately, I know quite a few,* Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Watching Ge Yuan's receding figure, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then changed direction, following close behind.</p>
