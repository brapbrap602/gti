<h1>Chapter 1914: The Path to Divinity</h1><p>“Thank you, Immortal, for saving our lives.”</p><p>A faint, ethereal figure, resembling a scholar, emerged from a nearby willow tree.  It was Yue Kaishan, the village headman, the same person he had dreamt of. The scholar bowed deeply to Qin Sang, his words sincere and heartfelt.</p><p>Qin Sang replied, “I must first thank you for protecting these villagers, especially since the locust spirit didn’t actually kill anyone.”</p><p>The so-called locust god wasn’t a single, magically empowered locust. Qin Sang suspected it was a spirit born from the collective will of the locust swarm, a product of some peculiar circumstance.</p><p>The woman on the donkey, and the willow tree spirit before him, were both manifestations of this divine will, not actual physical transformations.  It reminded him of the mysterious spirit insect he’d encountered in the Storm Realm, during his early days in Central State, when he bartered with the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The scholar said, “Locusts feeding is their nature; it wasn’t intentional targeting of humans.”</p><p>“You’re quite kind, defending it.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, his gaze shifting to a small earth god temple in the village.</p><p>The stone structure was rudimentary, lacking a dedicated priest. The villagers couldn’t afford elaborate ornamentation; their offering was a simple clay statue.</p><p>In the mortal world, the image of the Earth God was largely consistent.</p><p>This statue, too, depicted an elderly man with a long beard, kind and amiable—bearing no resemblance to the scholar before him.</p><p>“Where’s the local Earth God? Why did you, an irrelevant willow spirit, step in to avert the disaster?”</p><p>Residual energy emanated from the statue; an Earth God had resided there.</p><p>The scholar’s expression dimmed.  “Three years ago, a tiger demon wreaked havoc in the mountains. The Earth God, protecting the villagers, was killed by it.  Since I gained sentience, the Earth God often nurtured me with spiritual energy, leading to my current state.  I am deeply grateful for his protection.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed the cracks in the statue, the broken arms mended with white ash.</p><p>“Since you’ve inherited the Earth God’s will, protecting the people, and demonstrating such kindness, do you wish to inherit his position?  If so, I will help the villagers recast the statue, and you can receive their offerings and enter the path of divinity.”</p><p>The scholar was suddenly agitated.  “I… I could? But…”</p><p>His delight was evident, yet worry clouded his face.</p><p>“What concerns you?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“I’ve heard that, aside from naturally occurring mountain gods and Earth Gods deep in the wilderness, all human gods must receive imperial appointment.  Without it, without being included in the temple registers, they are not considered legitimate deities, but rather evil spirits and unholy shrines, to be eradicated by the City God's forces, with temples destroyed.  Furthermore, appointed gods are all virtuous human beings.  My origins…”</p><p>The scholar’s worry was palpable.</p><p>“The City God of Beiku County hasn’t sent a new Earth God here in three years.  His negligence in this matter is his own fault. You drove away the locust spirit, protecting this place, essentially rectifying his failure. If he clings to his prejudiced views against non-human entities, he doesn’t deserve his position.”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>“Immortal, please be careful what you say!”</p><p>The willow spirit was terrified, shocked by such audacious words.</p><p>However, remembering Qin Sang's effortless restoration of his energy, the willow spirit realized the person before him was extraordinary.  His boldness suggested he had the power to back it up.</p><p>The scholar hesitated, bowing again. “Then I would implore you, Immortal, to intercede on my behalf with the City God, to secure an appointment. If… if… the City God refuses, please don’t feel obligated…”</p><p>The locust spirit was long gone. The villagers still knelt, praying incessantly, oblivious to Qin Sang and the scholar’s conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, clearing his throat.</p><p>Yue Kaishan was on the ground, murmuring something. Seeing Qin Sang, he was about to prostrate himself again.</p><p>“Thank you, Immortal…”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped him. “Let’s talk over here.”</p><p>Moving away from the crowd, under a willow tree, Qin Sang explained the situation to Yue Kaishan.</p><p>“…You can create a new statue based on the scholar from your dream, and offer it worship.”</p><p>Returning to the temple, Yue Kaishan shouted excitedly.</p><p>“The Willow God protected us! The Willow God protected us!”</p><p>…</p><p>On the path.</p><p>Qin Sang rode back, a willow tree by the roadside, where the scholar’s ethereal form bowed from afar.</p><p>On this journey, Qin Sang didn't fight, nor witnessed any intense battles. Zhuque slept soundly, Xiao Wu showed no particular reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang walked slowly, constantly pondering Xiao Wu’s question.</p><p>Seeing Xiao Wu catching fish, Qin Sang had a premonition, and this trip confirmed his suspicions.</p><p>Whether it was the desert massacre that skewed his perception, or simply his nature,</p><p>Xiao Wu seemed more like a killer than him.</p><p>“Could the key to eliminating demonic intent lie here?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t answer Xiao Wu’s question.</p><p>He could easily offer a dozen solutions, but he had to be extremely cautious with Xiao Wu.</p><p>“We can choose to kill or to save. During our travels, we will save, not kill!”</p><p>Qin Sang made a decision.</p><p>It sounded like he wouldn't be able to comprehend the "Dao" of killing this way.</p><p>However, based on Qin Sang's understanding of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, the Ziwei Emperor, during his cultivation, likely had a process of sheathing his sword, attempting to suppress his killing intent until he found his own path.</p><p>But Qin Sang had never had the thought of sheathing his sword.</p><p>In the world's Dao, there is always yin and yang, yang gives rise to yin, yin gives rise to yang.  Everything is like this; maybe he could gain some insight from it.</p><p>Since it was a journey, experiencing various states of mind was also the intention.</p><p>Qin Sang once again realized the benefits of the Void Refinement stage: a long lifespan, a heavenly tribulation every three thousand years, giving him more time to comprehend and seek the Dao.</p><p>Xiao Wu always obeyed Qin Sang without hesitation, nodding lightly.</p><p>“What's the point of that!” Zhuque grumbled, dissatisfied. “How can you punish evildoers without killing them?  What kind of 'acting on behalf of Heaven' is that?”</p><p>“Some stray from the right path, others make a momentary mistake.  All can be saved.  As for those utterly wicked, doesn't the City God Temple have a Department of Punishment?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, mounted his horse, gently shook the reins, and rode off like a worldly Taoist.</p><p>Luo Hou's speed was only slightly faster than an ordinary horse, but no obstacle could stop her as she galloped along the riverbank.</p><p>Qin Sang drew a picture of a willow spirit for the villagers and was asked to stay for a meal, so he didn't set off until dusk.</p><p>Before reaching Beikuai County, darkness had fallen, and a crescent moon hung high.</p><p>Moonlight scattered on the river, and the shadows of trees stretched like water ghosts.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>A sudden gust of wind arose on the river, a cold wind blowing towards them, adding a chilling touch to the night.</p><p>From where the wind came, faint mist spread along the riverbank, and two shadowy figures could be vaguely seen within the mist.</p><p>The two figures were fleeting, their feet not touching the ground.</p><p>However, judging by their attire—neat black robes, tall hats, swords at their waists, and solemn expressions—and the faint, strange spiritual light emanating from them, they were clearly not ordinary ghosts.</p><p>A "North" character was embroidered on the back of their robes.</p><p>They moved swiftly on the wind. Hearing the sound of approaching hooves, they flew to a high place to look, and saw a man riding a horse at night.</p><p>Although unusual, they didn't notice anything special about the Taoist.</p><p>They didn't reveal themselves and continued on their way. Just as they were about to pass by, the Taoist suddenly stopped, his eyes clearly fixed on them.</p><p>“You can see us?”</p><p>The two instinctively gripped their sword hilts.</p><p>Qin Sang dismounted and bowed slightly.  “Are you two the Yin officers of Beikuai County? My Taoist name is Qingfeng.”</p><p>“Indeed! We greet Daoist Qingfeng,” The two Yin officers, guessing that Qin Sang was a cultivator with far greater skill than themselves, returned the greeting.</p><p>“Judging by your direction, you must be investigating the locust plague. Why are you so late?”</p><p>When the villagers of Xiwu Village entered the city seeking work, a competent City God would immediately notice.</p><p>It took four days to send Yin officers.  If not for the willow spirit’s intervention, countless crops would have been devoured.</p><p>Faced with this direct rebuke, the Yin officers barely managed to restrain themselves. “There were other urgent matters in the city, and our superiors were stretched thin.  We only learned of the locust plague today and were immediately sent to investigate. If it's an ordinary plague, it's Heaven's will and doesn't need intervention; if there's demonic interference, it must be exterminated!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “There was indeed demonic locusts, but they have been driven into the mountains and haven't harmed the people.”</p><p>The two Yin officers exchanged glances, their expressions softening.  They bowed. “Thank you, Daoist, for driving away the demonic locusts.  It saves us a lot of trouble.”</p><p>“Not at all; it wasn’t I who did it.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and explained the situation, including the willow spirit’s request for official recognition.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The Yin officer hesitated.  “Such an important matter of bestowal, we dare not decide. We hope that Daoist will come with us to the county to report to our superiors.”</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections and gestured for the Yin officers to lead the way.</p><p>One Yin officer whispered a few words to his companion, transformed into a gust of wind, and went ahead to report to the city.  The remaining Yin officer led Qin Sang at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Their speed wasn't slow. Soon, a huge shadow appeared in the distance—the outline of the city.</p><p>Shortly after nightfall, the city was brightly lit.</p><p>One city gate was adjacent to the docks, with houses lining both banks of the river, bustling with activity, forming a small town.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a familiar boat. Chen Ya'er was cooking on the deck, and the rattle he had given was still in Xiao Wu's hands.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang noticed a man in ornate official robes standing imposingly before the city gate, a line of underworld constables behind him.  It wasn't curfew yet, and people were coming and going, yet no one seemed to see him.</p><p>“It’s the City God!”</p><p>The leading constable whispered, surprised that the City God would personally come out to greet them.</p><p>Qing Ma leaped across the river, landing steadily before the gate.</p><p>The City God, Gao Ruoxu, was a middle-aged man with a square face, thick brows, and large eyes.  His expression was upright and serious; he’d been silently observing Qin Sang from afar, already knowing his Daoist name through the constables.</p><p>“Gao Ruoxu, City God of Beikuang County, greets Daoist Qingfeng.”</p><p>Qin Sang dismounted, leading Little Five, and bowed slightly. “This humble Daoist, Qingfeng, doesn’t dare trouble the City God to personally greet us.”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu laughed heartily, saying to those beside him, “Present it.”</p><p>Immediately, a constable presented a scroll of golden silk.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu took it and slowly unfurled it before Qin Sang. It was an imperial decree appointing the Willow Spirit as a local deity.</p><p>“The Willow Spirit has repelled evil and protected the people. Although a different species, its heart is compassionate. As the City God of Beikuang County, I have the authority to issue this decree; I will report it to the prefectural city afterward. Daoist, please check for any errors.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected the City God to be so quick to agree.  “This humble Daoist thanks the City God on behalf of the Willow Spirit.”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu nodded and handed the scroll back to two constables.</p><p>“Quickly, to the Land Temple in West Five Village!”</p><p>The constables left, and Qin Sang and Gao Ruoxu walked into the city, chatting.</p><p>Chen Ya’er’s boat was nearby. He was blowing on the stove, and thought he heard the sound of a clapper. He looked up.</p><p>The night was dark, and the figure he expected wasn't there. Disappointment washed over him.</p><p>In Beikuang County, the City God Temple was even more magnificent than the county magistrate's office, and the street in front of it was the busiest in the city.</p><p>Qin Sang, leading Little Five, walked alongside Gao Ruoxu through the bustling market.</p><p>Luo Hou and the constables followed respectfully behind.</p><p>Even now, Qin Sang hadn't seen the City God's judge and other officials.  The City God was only accompanied by a few constables, and there was no other spiritual presence in the temple.</p><p>Combined with Gao Ruoxu’s unexpectedly warm welcome, Qin Sang knew something was unusual, but pretended otherwise, making polite conversation.</p><p>When asked about his sect, Qin Sang simply said he practiced in seclusion and was traveling through the area.</p><p>Suddenly, two constables left the group and disappeared down a dark alley.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped and turned.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu also stopped. “Old Mr. Sun of Jisheng Pharmacy is nearing the end of his life.”</p><p>“Are those two constables escorting Mr. Sun on his final journey?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>From his experience in the Storm Realm, ordinary people’s souls disperse upon death unless someone uses magic to take their souls, or some other unusual circumstance occurs; there was no reincarnation.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu nodded. “Old Mr. Sun was a kind doctor who helped many poor people. He was known for his benevolence and loved by all, and may be suitable for ascension to the divine realm.”</p><p>“Ascension to the divine realm?” Qin Sang glanced at the constables. “My lord and your constables, were you all righteous people in your lives, and ascended after death?”</p><p>“To be honest, I only did insignificant things in my previous life.”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu noticed Qin Sang’s apparent lack of knowledge about the divine realm and explained, “Humans have three souls. After death, the heavenly soul returns to heaven, the earthly soul returns to earth, and the human soul goes to an unknown place.  There are legends of reincarnation, but their truth is uncertain. However, some souls remain after death for various reasons.</p><p>“For example, souls entangled by hatred or obsession linger, sometimes becoming malevolent spirits that must be suppressed or eliminated.”</p><p>“If someone has done good deeds and is praised by thousands, their soul retains spiritual light after death, and may have the potential for divinity. This is perhaps heaven's recognition of their good deeds.”</p><p>“Our duty as City Gods is to guide such souls into the divine realm, so that even after our own lifespans end, there are still deities to protect this area.”</p><p>Qin Sang had been too busy to thoroughly understand these things.  Hearing Gao Ruoxu's explanation, he realized the true divine realm was different from the legends.  There were no Ox-Head and Horse-Face, no Yama, and no eighteen levels of hell…</p><p>Reincarnation, even, was just a legend to the City God.</p><p>The divine realm in this world differed from that of the Dao Court; ascension didn't require a true talisman.</p><p>He wondered which came first.</p><p>The Dao Court's divine realm was clearly more complex and controlled, making him wonder if the Dao Court was the origin of the divine realm, collapsing only for the divine realm to continue evolving in this world.</p><p>Otherwise, with similar offerings, why didn't the Storm Realm spontaneously develop a divine realm? Or was there another reason?</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was distant.</p><p>This was clearly another peculiarity of the Storm Realm!</p><p>Two figures appeared in his mind.</p><p>Separated by a thousand years, their faces were still so clear.</p><p>Jixin Daoist and Mingyue.</p><p>They had traveled, healing and giving medicine to countless people, for whom villages had built shrines.</p><p>If they had lived in this world, they would have been welcomed into the divine realm.</p><p>Sadly...</p>
