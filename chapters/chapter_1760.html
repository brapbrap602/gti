<h1>Chapter 1751</h1><p>The beast, resembling a dog but with short front legs, scurried low to the ground, its hind legs propelling it forward at a surprisingly fast pace, fearful of being discovered by the middle-aged Daoist.  Its stealth was broken abruptly.  The beast froze momentarily, then, its legs churning, it kicked up a devilish wind and fled towards the nearby forest.</p><p>Qin Sang followed leisurely, his gaze fixed on the beast with a curious expression.  The aura he’d sensed in Bai Long Ferry had belonged to this creature—a power level comparable to a transformed-stage great demon, the true master of the altar, secretly controlling the giant wolf with remarkable skill.</p><p>Now, however, the beast’s aura was drastically weakened, only at the early stage of its cultivation.  Qin Sang followed it, confirming that its decline wasn't due to injury or illness, but a significant drop in cultivation level. The giant wolf and the beast shared a single source of power, their cultivation intertwined and mutually convertible, deceiving even the middle-aged Daoist.</p><p>Seeing the beast still fleeing, Qin Sang lightly tapped his foot, effortlessly catching up and reaching out to grasp it. The beast was captured in his palm, its neck held fast, rendering it immobile.</p><p>Moving away from any settlements, Qin Sang found a level rock and dropped the beast.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The beast landed, its eyes closed, its body rigid, like a corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, “I know you understand human speech. If you wish to avoid soul-searching, answer my questions honestly.”</p><p>The beast trembled, opened its eyes, their pupils darting around. It rolled over, prostrated itself, and kowtowed repeatedly. “Immortal, spare my life! I’ll be your loyal servant. Whatever you want to know, I’ll tell you everything.”</p><p>This cunning beast was surprisingly compliant, saving Qin Sang trouble. He needed help, and highly intelligent demonic beasts were rare, making it a valuable asset.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. “Tell me, what region is this?”</p><p>He urgently needed to know how cultivators in this world stabilized their spiritual energy and what cultivation methods they practiced. But first, he needed to understand the overall situation.</p><p>The beast hesitated, cautiously looking up at Qin Sang. The man’s aura was so subtle that it could not gauge his cultivation level. However, it was clear that he was far stronger than the beast in its prime.  The sheer pressure emanating from him alone filled it with fear.</p><p>A Daoist master—would they get lost under the Daoist Court's rule?</p><p>Unsure of Qin Sang’s intentions, the beast racked its brains, recounting everything it knew.</p><p>Qin Sang listened quietly, learning that this was a land under Daoist rule.</p><p>The Kingdom of Nine Dragons, where he currently found himself, was under the jurisdiction of a branch altar of the Daoist sect. The monarch and officials were all mortals. The Daoist sect rarely interfered in the succession of mortal dynasties—a strategy consistent with the cultivation sects in the Storm Belt.</p><p>He had heard the nun's title, learning that the Nine Dragons Kingdom was governed by the Ninth Branch Altar of the Xuanmiao Yingzhen Altar.</p><p>According to the beast, however, the full name of this region was: Zhongmao Administration, Qingxu Jing, Xuanmiao Yingzhen Altar, Ninth Branch Altar, Nine Dragons Kingdom, Fulong City.</p><p>Legend spoke of the Nine Heavens Golden Que, but its existence and location remained unknown.</p><p>The altars were divided into Main Altars and Branch Altars.  Jing referred to the Jinglu, also known as Jing Altar.  Each Jing Altar had various departments overseeing mortals, gods, ghosts, and demons.  They had ranks and grades, like a mortal dynasty, divided into nine grades, with the first grade being the highest, each grade further divided into senior and junior positions.</p><p>The Branch Altar Master, like the nun, held the rank of Zheng Liu Pin (Sixth Grade Senior), Heavenly Pivot Academy's Head of Dharma, and handled the affairs of the Heavenly Pivot Academy.</p><p>Those below Sixth Grade served in various Branch Altars. National teachers had positions in the Heavenly Pivot Academy, overseeing their respective regions.</p><p>The Main Altar Master, titled Shangqing Xuandu Physician, was only a Cong Wu Pin (Fifth Grade Junior), though important Main Altars could receive a half-grade promotion.</p><p>Above them were the Jinglu leaders, the Imperial Historians of the Nine Heavens Golden Que, holding the rank of Zheng Si Pin (Fourth Grade Senior), overseeing the Heavenly Pivot Academy.</p><p>Beyond that was Zhongmao Administration, a level of authority beyond the beast's knowledge.</p><p>The hierarchical structure, clearly defined, was known as the Daoist Court. But the Daoist Court wasn't limited to the Heavenly Pivot Academy.</p><p>Zhongmao Administration was under the Heavenly Pivot Academy, while Baishi Administration was under the jurisdiction of the North Pole Exorcism Academy, together known as the Two Administrations. The North Pole Exorcism Academy was said to be on par with the Heavenly Pivot Academy in strength and rank, though their titles differed.</p><p>However, within Zhongmao Administration, the term "Daoist Court" generally referred to the Heavenly Pivot Academy.</p><p>Of course, not all Daoist cultivators in Zhongmao Zhi are affiliated with the Tian Shu Academy.  Many Daoist sects exist outside the Academy, yet they cannot truly live as recluses.  Under the Daoist court's rule, all are subject to its jurisdiction and must abide by celestial laws, lest they be punished by the court.</p><p>For example, the Bi Yao's former master came from Danxiao Mansion.  Danxiao Mansion's mountain gate is located in Jingzhi Zhen within Zhongmao Zhi. Even if not the chief of Jingzhi Zhen, but even the master of a sub-temple under Jingzhi Zhen would have to open the mountain gate to welcome him, showing great respect.</p><p>These Daoist cultivators can also become officials in Tian Shu Academy after passing examinations, though they remain a minority.</p><p>The Bi Yao's former master, having achieved the Shengxuan level, did not wish to enter the Daoist court.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was surprised.  Yuan Ying cultivators in Tian Shu Academy can only become fifth-rank temple masters. Above them are the Jing Lu and Zhongmao Zhi. If rank and cultivation level correspond, wouldn't this world have cultivators at the Lianxu level or even higher?</p><p>"How many levels are there in Daoist cultivation?" Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>The Bi Yao hesitated, momentarily unsure how to answer.</p><p>In this world, all human cultivators join the Daoist path; the order of Daoist cultivation is common knowledge, even clear to the demons and ghosts in the Dual Eastern Peaks.  This creature's clear mind and balanced, mystical aura clearly indicate proper training. Yet it doesn't know the methods of Daoist cultivation?</p><p>"Could it be a foreign demon?"</p><p>The Bi Yao, suddenly remembering a legend, shuddered, dared not think further, and hastily revealed what it knew.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, felt fortunate for his caution.</p><p>This world's Daoist cultivators are indeed exceptionally powerful, far surpassing those of the Storm World, eliminating worries about a dead end.</p><p>The levels of Daoist cultivation in this world are called "Levels of Power," divided into nine levels, from highest to lowest: Bi Dao, Dong Zhen, He Tu, Wu Fu, Dong Xuan, Sheng Xuan, Dong Shen, Dao De, and Zheng Yi.</p><p>His current understanding of the cultivation levels – Great Ascension, Unity, Void Refining, Divine Transformation, Yuan Ying, Golden Core, Foundation Establishment, and Qi Refinement – totals eight.</p><p>Due to limited cultivation and knowledge, the Bi Yao didn't know the abilities of the higher levels.</p><p>But from its description, Qin Sang could confirm that at least below the Divine Transformation stage, cultivation and strength corresponded.</p><p>For instance, the female cultivator was at the Dong Shen level, with an aura similar to a Golden Core cultivator, while the middle-aged Daoist from the sub-temple was certainly at the Sheng Xuan level, equivalent to a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>The Bi Yao had overheard its former master and his guards discussing Dong Xuan level masters; these were nearly comparable to Divine Transformation cultivators.</p><p>Thus, Great Ascension cultivators might only be at the Dong Zhen level. Whether this indicates a split within Great Ascension or higher levels exist remains unclear.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang is far from such realms; now is not the time to ponder these matters.</p><p>"Do the Levels of Power correspond to official rank?" Qin Sang calculated carefully. Tian Shu Academy's ranks are divided into nine grades, precisely corresponding to the nine Levels of Power.</p><p>This suggests that all first-rank officials in Tian Shu Academy are at the Great Ascension stage?  If so, Great Ascension cultivators would not remain in a lesser world; they would surely ascend to a greater world.</p><p>The Bi Yao, now unsurprised, treated Qin Sang as a foreign demon, saying, "Eighth and ninth ranks are held by Zheng Yi level cultivators.  It probably starts at seventh rank.  I haven't served my former master long, but from what I've seen, some might have a higher level but not yet a higher rank due to special circumstances, but I've never seen someone promoted to a higher position without the necessary cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  The Bi Dao level is indeed mysterious. "That means the chief of Zhongmao Zhi is at least at the Wu Fu level."</p><p>The chief is the highest authority in Zhongmao Zhi, holding the seal of authority.</p><p>And the Wu Fu level is very likely a Void Refining cultivator.</p><p>The Bi Yao chuckled, "My knowledge is limited, but I've heard that the Tian Shu Academy in Zhongmao Zhi does have great masters, but I don't know if that includes the chief."</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly scoffed.</p><p>He had already learned that in this world, Daoists who reach the Sheng Xuan level, Yuan Ying cultivators, can be called masters, consistent with the Storm World.  But the three levels above Sheng Xuan are also called masters; only those at the He Tu level, which he surmises are Unity cultivators, are revered as True Lords.  Those at the Wu Fu level, because they govern a region, are often prefixed with 'Great,' a convention.</p><p>He, a mere Divine Transformation cultivator, was revered as a True Lord for years; the thought made him feel ashamed.</p><p>If the high Daoists of this world were to find out, they would surely rebuke him for overstepping his bounds.</p><p>Having learned the general aspects of the Daoist path, Qin Sang then asked about their cultivation methods.</p><p>The answer surprised him greatly.</p><p>Based on his observations, he had assumed this world practiced both Divine and Talisman Dao, but that was not the case.  The Daoists here cultivate Talisman Dao and the Way of Contemplation.</p><p>The terms "Talisman" and "Contemplation" need to be separated.</p><p>The key is "Contemplation"!</p><p>Contemplation, also called Dharma Contemplation, is said by Daoists to possess immense power.</p><p>It can command the spirits of heaven and earth, summon and rebuke gods and spirits, judge sins and blessings, examine merits and demerits, and issue commands to all creatures.</p><p>It can also slay demons and subdue monsters, control mountains and rivers.</p><p>It can also cleanse filth and control the hundred breaths.</p><p>Dao Xuan can also be combined with this practice to achieve true enlightenment.</p><p>The so-called "Imprint," Qin Sang had seen it before at Qin Sang, namely the "Announcing to All Spirits Imprint" used in the female priest's ritual altar, and the "Crimson Cloud Banner" used in the wolf soldiers' altar.</p><p>These are the true forms of the Imprint, also called Seals.  Different traditions use different Seals.</p><p>The "Announcing to All Spirits Imprint" is unique to the Heavenly Pivot Academy.  It is said that the Seal used by the celestial officials of the North Pole Exorcism Academy is called the "Nine Heavens Military Talisman!"</p><p>When the hyena demon was summoned by its former master as a soldier, it already held the Sheng Xuan rank, so it didn't know the original form of the Imprint. It's said to be similar to a talisman, possibly a combination of obscure runes, or a tremendously complex diagram.</p><p>With increasing cultivation, a true Imprint will gradually condense.</p><p>Daoist disciples, after receiving initiation into the Dao, must then undergo the Imprint ceremony. Only after this ceremony can they begin cultivation.  This highlights two crucial functions of the Imprint:</p><p>1. To cleanse foul Qi and level the six celestial stagnant Qi.</p><p>2. To cultivate and focus the divine essence.</p><p>“Six celestial stagnant Qi…”</p><p>Qin Sang silently repeated the words.</p><p>In this world, Daoists consider chaotic Qi as the six celestial stagnant Qi. After the Imprint ceremony, using Heaven and Earth as an altar, with the ritual altar properly set up, one can borrow the altar's power to stabilize the primordial Qi and begin Daoist cultivation.</p><p>But stabilizing the primordial Qi is not enough. The six celestial stagnant Qi contains chaotic potential that, over time, will erode the cultivator's spirit, affecting their sanity, shaking their Dao foundation. Therefore, one must use the method of focused contemplation, visualizing celestial deities, using the Imprint as a reference point, connecting to the Heavenly heart, and concentrating on the divine beings to ensure safety.</p><p>This method is also known as "cultivating the divine essence," and the deity visualized is known as the protective deity or altar-guarding general. The Imprint and the altar-guarding general are both pillars of the ritual altar.</p><p>The Imprint not only protects the Daoist, but also the soldiers under their command who can cultivate around the altar under its protection. They can also join the Daoist in visualizing the protective deity, making the altar more stable. The loyalty of the soldiers and the Daoist's focused cultivation are mutually beneficial.</p><p>The ritual altar is not only for cultivation, but also for storing soldiers. When a Daoist travels, they can take their soldiers with them by collecting the altar.</p><p>Encountering a lone Daoist, one might assume they are easy to bully, but this would be a grave mistake. They might instantly summon countless demonic soldiers, their banners obscuring the sky—truly, one person is an army.</p><p>However, raising an army is not easy and carries the risk of the altar imploding.</p><p>Because the six celestial stagnant Qi is rampant in this world, solitary cultivation by demonic cultivators carries a higher risk of losing rationality as their cultivation deepens.  Even non-sentient demonic creatures can sense the benefits of a ritual altar, making it easier to subdue soldiers here than in normal realms.</p><p>Moreover, the Imprint has a spirit-imbuing ability. Without needing Imperial Dew, if the commanders among the soldiers are imbued with spirit by the Daoist, their gratitude leads to even greater loyalty.</p><p>There is naturally an upper limit to the number and cultivation level of soldiers, but the hyena demon isn’t entirely sure. It only knows it’s related to the Daoist's cultivation and the Imprint they have received.</p><p>The Imprint ceremony isn't a one-time event.  When one's cultivation is perfected, a higher-level Imprint must be conferred. This is the order of Daoist cultivation.</p><p>The Imprint ceremony must be performed at a ritual altar. Each sect has its mountain gate and main altar; the Heavenly Pivot Academy also has its own altars—the governing, pacifying, main, and branch altars—all with the responsibility of conferring Imprints.</p><p>Hearing this, the slightly relaxed feeling Qin Sang had began to weigh heavily on them again.</p><p>"You are one of those rebellious soldiers who caused the altar to implode?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked the hyena demon up and down.</p><p>The hyena demon flinched. It didn't want to reveal its shameful past, but considering its identity as a disciple had been exposed on the river, it knew this person would find out anyway, so it didn’t dare to hide it.</p><p>"That old Daoist was cruel and harsh. I was forcibly conscripted later on; I wasn't one of his personal soldiers. I suffered a lot of oppression. And that old Daoist was biased, repeatedly blaming me without reason..."</p><p>The hyena demon tried to argue further, but under Qin Sang's amused gaze, even with its sharp tongue, it eventually fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother with it, saying calmly, "Let me ask you, you just said that when a Daoist confers the Imprint and contemplates divine beings, they can summon celestial soldiers and generals to descend. Have you ever seen this happen?"</p><p>The hyena demon breathed a sigh of relief, quickly shaking its head. "No, when that old Daoist fought others, he only used his own troops. Because he wasn’t a celestial official of the Heavenly Pivot Academy, he didn't have the authority to command freely. Even summoning city gods and mountain gods required offering bribes first. There's no such thing as celestial soldiers and generals. That's just Daoist propaganda.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed, then asked, "If there are no celestial deities, then where did the city gods and mountain gods come from?"</p><p>"That…"</p><p>The hyena demon froze. It hadn’t really thought about that before.</p><p>Its eyes flickered, it mumbled for a while, and then suddenly remembered something, its face lighting up. It said repeatedly, "I remember! That old Daoist once said—'Gods are created by men!'"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to Lian Zui Lun for the generous donation that made them a Patron!
