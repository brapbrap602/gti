<h1>Chapter 832: The Ambush</h1><p>“Old Devil Mou…”</p><p>Qin Sang remembered this name.</p><p>The black-armored man dispatched by the Lord of Hutian Island to guard the Winter Nether Cold Flame had mentioned that Old Devil Mou was interested in it, and the island lord had invited him to subdue the flame.</p><p>Old Devil Mou was a powerful figure in the demonic path, his reputation long established.</p><p>“It's a pity the Winter Nether Cold Flame has already been taken. This person must be highly skilled in manipulating fire…”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of regret.</p><p>He knew that Immortal Winter Nether's possessions had been destroyed by the Cold Flame’s erosion, leaving only the flame itself as a unique treasure, a true rarity.</p><p>……</p><p>The journey was relatively smooth. They encountered no beast hordes and arrived at an island named Yu Heng.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lady Liu, disguised, landed on the island. Under the cover of Lady Liu's friend, they entered the city.</p><p>This friend was also a female cultivator named Jin Ying. She was attractive and had been monitoring Xiang Yi's activities on the island.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, her gaze was somewhat unfriendly, scrutinizing him.  She seemed to doubt his abilities, although she concealed it well, Qin Sang still noticed.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly understood the reason.  They had missed an opportunity because they couldn't contact him last time, so it was no wonder she was displeased.</p><p>“This is the Daoist Qing Feng I’ve often spoken of.”</p><p>The three hurried back to Jin Ying’s cave dwelling, where Lady Liu introduced them. “Daoist, this is my junior sister Jin Ying. I once cultivated at a sect for a time and befriended her. We have been like sisters ever since. She now serves as a steward in the Nine Star Association. Thanks to her help in concealing my identity over the years, Xiang Yi has remained unaware of my true self. This time, we also need Jin Ying's help to lure Xiang Yi off the island, so we have a chance to strike.”</p><p>So it was the Nine Star Association.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. The Nine Star Association was one of the top merchant guilds in the trade alliance.  Jin Ying certainly had the necessary influence.  Her willingness to break with the alliance and the guild to help Lady Liu avenge her husband spoke volumes about their bond.</p><p>“Senior sister, you needn’t say such things. If it weren’t for you and Brother Liu’s care back then, I wouldn't be where I am today.”</p><p>Jin Ying looked at Qin Sang, then turned to Lady Liu and said gravely, “Xiang Yi is currently on the island. The leaders of several nearby large islands are preparing to gather here, fortifying this island. The trade alliance is also dispatching reinforcements. Xiang Yi can’t leave for now. But before we act, you two must think carefully. If we fail and alert him, not only will Brother Liu’s revenge go unfulfilled, but Xiang Yi will certainly not spare us. In such a situation, with the trade alliance hunting us, we won’t be able to return to the Canglang Sea, forced to wander the Demonic Sea, living amongst the beasts. This is likely our only chance.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang knew that Jin Ying’s words were directed at him. She still doubted his abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly and said nothing.</p><p>Lady Liu smoothed things over, “Junior Sister, rest assured.  The Daoist moved freely within the Seven Kills Palace and instantly killed a late Core Formation cultivator. His strength is beyond doubt. As long as that Restriction Talisman can be used, defeating Xiang Yi shouldn’t be a problem. But the Daoist mustn’t be careless. I must ensure Xiang Yi is utterly annihilated, body and soul, to appease my husband’s spirit in heaven!”</p><p>Lady Liu's tone was resolute, filled with hatred for Xiang Yi.</p><p>“As long as your arrangements are flawless, I'm confident I won’t give Xiang Yi a chance to escape.”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped smiling, making his promise. Then he began to inquire about their plan. “How do you two intend to lure Xiang Yi off the island? What if he doesn't leave alone and has other experts with him? From what you’ve said, it seems Xiang Yi has several experts sent by the trade alliance with him.”</p><p>The two women exchanged glances, and Lady Liu nodded at Jin Ying.</p><p>Out of caution, Jin Ying waved her hand and set up a soundproof barrier before explaining in detail, "According to our information, Xiang Yi has been searching for a type of spiritual tree called Tortoise-Shell Wood, a little-known spiritual material. This Tortoise-Shell Wood is quite unique. It seems to breathe mist like a demonic beast, and every hundred years, there’s an eruption, with mist covering an area of several miles, emitting a peculiar scent. We'll create a similar phenomenon in the Demonic Sea and, through Nine Star Association’s connections within the trade alliance, leak news of it to Xiang Yi.  As for Xiang Yi's companions…"</p><p>Lady Liu continued, "My husband also made some friends during his lifetime. It was a friend who told me about Xiang Yi's need for Tortoise-Shell Wood. Although they fear the alliance leader and dare not oppose Xiang Yi, they’re willing to provide what help they can. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have come this far. One friend, also working for the trade alliance, happens to be on the island. Before we strike, he will try his best to restrain the alliance's experts, but the ambush itself must be carried out by us.  Furthermore, Xiang Yi is greedy and cunning. As long as he believes a treasure exists, he’ll certainly not bring others along, lest he has to share the spoils…"</p><p>“Try his best… So, Xiang Yi might still have help. We can't afford to be unprepared…”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He wasn't comfortable placing his hopes on others.</p><p>Lady Liu said helplessly, “Indeed, but there won’t be a better opportunity. This risk must be taken. Once Xiang Yi returns to secluded cultivation for his breakthrough, we won’t have any chance at all.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood this reasoning.</p><p>Confident in his ability to escape even if the ambush failed, he said no more.</p><p>The three discussed their strategy for a day.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lady Liu left Yu Heng Island first.  After searching for several days, they found a suitable small island and set up an illusionary formation mimicking the Tortoise-Shell Wood.</p><p>Then began the long wait.</p><p>Two months passed before they finally got their chance!</p><p>……</p><p>Outside Yu Heng Island, Qin Sang and Lady Liu waited anxiously.</p><p>Suddenly, the water surface rippled, and a carp-like sea beast leaped out. It was Jin Ying’s tamed spirit beast. It opened its mouth and spat out a message talisman.</p><p>“The fish has taken the bait!”</p><p>Lady Liu read.</p><p>They exchanged glances and immediately concealed themselves.</p><p>They lay in ambush along the route, with Jin Ying relaying information. She wasn't strong enough to participate in the ambush and was now arranging their escape route, so they could flee immediately if the ambush failed.</p><p>However, Jin Ying’s spirit beast was certainly slower than Xiang Yi’s escape speed. They only knew the news of the spiritual material had been successfully delivered, but not when Xiang Yi would arrive or if he’d have companions. They had to adapt to the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lady Liu kept some distance between them.</p><p>He held the Mixed-Yuan Concentric Rings and commanded the Sky-Eye Butterfly to activate its Sky-Eye, patrolling the sea surface to detect Xiang Yi's arrival in time.</p><p>Time passed slowly, seemingly endless.</p><p>Xiang Yi remained unseen.</p><p>However, Jin Ying hadn't sent any new messages, indicating no unexpected changes.</p><p>The sea breeze blew against his face, and Qin Sang listened to the sound of the waves. His gaze suddenly sharpened. In the distance, on the sea surface, faint, meteor-like streaks of light appeared, speeding towards them.</p>
