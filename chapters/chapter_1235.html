<h1>Chapter 1227: The Fire Lotus Seed</h1><p>Atop Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiang Qing sat cross-legged on either side of the Ancestral Sacred Fire, like statues carved from wood and clay. One focused intently on cultivating a secret technique, while the other exerted all their strength to maintain the large array, restraining the Ancestral Sacred Fire.</p><p>Wu Youdao, leading several disciples of the Qingyang Demon Sect, stood guard at the foot of Shen Gang Peak, forming a battle formation, ready to obey orders at any moment.</p><p>They occasionally looked up at the peak, whispering amongst themselves.</p><p>“The Sect Master has been in seclusion on the peak for months, not even going to the front lines.  Could something have gone wrong with the suppression of the Ancestral Sacred Fire?”</p><p>“Suppression?  Before, we were allowed to go up the mountain to absorb the Qingyang Gang Qi. Now we’re forbidden. It doesn’t look like it’s been suppressed at all.”</p><p>Among the disciples, only Wu Youdao knew some of the truth.  However, they were all intelligent, and could see the odd signs from the sect's strange behavior.</p><p>Wu Youdao looked up, gazing at the peak.</p><p>He heard the disciples’ murmurs, but didn't stop them.</p><p>Because the Sect Master had recently sent a message: this time, the sect's hidden danger would be completely resolved, and they would no longer need to hide it!</p><p>At this thought, Wu Youdao felt unusually excited.</p><p>Since his entry into the sect, he had known that the Ancestral Sacred Fire was on the verge of losing control, like a dark cloud hanging over the Qingyang Demon Sect, suffocating everyone.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect both revered and feared this ancestral flame. It had once repelled invading enemies and protected the sect, yet had become a mortal threat, potentially destroying Shen Gang Peak and severing the Qingyang Demon Sect's roots.</p><p>It was simply that later generations were incompetent, and no one could subdue the Ancestral Sacred Fire, leading to an accumulation of problems.</p><p>Xiang Qing had gone deep into the battlefield, facing death and then rebirth, breaking through to the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>They had thought they could finally suppress the Ancestral Sacred Fire, but unexpectedly, Xiang Qing could only temporarily restrain it.</p><p>“I wonder what method the Sect Master has come up with. Is it related to that ancestor of the Demon Flame Sect?”</p><p>Wu Youdao thought.</p><p>He remembered that the ancestor of the Demon Flame Sect had visited and seemed to have stayed ever since.</p><p>“I hope it can be resolved quickly!  Otherwise, we can’t go up the mountain.  This unified distribution of Gang Ying can only barely support our cultivation. The most annoying thing is that the Gang Ying is difficult to preserve. If something happens and we can't refine it in time, it will dissipate,” someone sighed, eliciting a chorus of agreement.</p><p>“Yeah, I've lost it twice, it's heartbreaking!”</p><p>“Isn’t there any other place in the world with Qingyang Gang Ying?”</p><p>“Gang Ying is formed when the Qiantian Gang Qi from the nine heavens descends to the world. Even the Sect Master doesn’t have the ability to collect Gang Qi from the heavens. And the Qiantian Gang Qi isn't just Qingyang Gang Qi, legend says there are thirty-six kinds.  Even if other places have Gang Ying, it may not be Qingyang Gang Ying. The Sect Master must have searched everywhere…”</p><p>These Qingyang Demon Sect disciples relied on the Qingyang Gang Ying for their daily cultivation and were quite knowledgeable about the Qiantian Gang Qi.</p><p>“The Sect Master has been in seclusion for so long this time, they must have a way. Maybe they couldn't suppress it before, but didn't want to!” someone snorted.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the others' eyes lit up.</p><p>“They didn’t want to suppress it? Does the Sect Master want to refine the Ancestral Sacred Fire?”</p><p>“The Sect Master’s strength is…”</p><p>…</p><p>Regardless of the commotion below.</p><p>Qin Sang refined another stream of the Ancestral Sacred Fire and recalled the fire seed.</p><p>A light green fire seed hovered before them, shaped like a lotus seed, though only half-formed; the rest was ethereal.</p><p>Besides initially using the Nine Nether Demon Fire to forge a rudimentary fire seed as a primer, Qin Sang had been diligently refining the Ancestral Sacred Fire.</p><p>At this point, the Ancestral Sacred Fire was still raging, but its main body was a full size smaller than months ago.</p><p>The weakened Ancestral Sacred Fire was much easier to deal with.</p><p>With the original array, Xiang Qing only needed to put in some effort to reseal the Ancestral Sacred Fire. Then, by gradually refining it while improving their own strength, they could resolve this mortal threat.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang stop, Xiang Qing looked over. “Is that enough?”</p><p>Qin Sang's condition for helping suppress the Ancestral Sacred Fire was that they could refine it at will.  More than a month ago, Xiang Qing could have sealed the Ancestral Sacred Fire themselves, but seeing Qin Sang hadn't stopped, they let them continue.</p><p>“Enough! Thank you, Daoist Xiang, for your help!”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fire seed, stored it in their Purple Mansion, and nodded in response.</p><p>Previously, they had estimated they needed to first use the Ancestral Sacred Fire to condense the Fire Lotus Seed before refining the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>After referencing the Qingyang Demon Sect’s secret techniques, Qin Sang could refine the demon fire more effectively, making it easier to subdue than before, so they didn’t need to wait for the Fire Lotus Seed to fully form.</p><p>News had arrived from the Boundless Valley: the Blood Lake seal was becoming increasingly unstable.</p><p>Since Qin Sang's trip to the Abyssal Ruins, almost two years had passed, and Elder Ye's progress had been slow, demonstrating just how strong the Blood Lake seal was.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance has been watching and preparing secretly, choosing not to help break the seal.  They want Ye Laomo to expend as much energy as possible.</p><p>Before entering Blood Lake, Qin Sang needed to quickly refine the Nine Nether Magic Fire and control more magic banners, so he decided to end his current task early.</p><p>Xiang Qing smiled broadly, stood up and bowed.  "Fellow Daoist Mingyue, your words leave me humbled! Your actions are tantamount to saving our sect's lineage. The importance of this is self-evident; I should be thanking you!"</p><p>Both had overcome a major hurdle and laughed together.</p><p>After a short rest, Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>He first visited the Magic Flame Gate, reminding Zhao Shanran to focus on cultivating disciples and building a solid foundation, warning against aiming too high too soon. Then he went to the Yuan Shen Gate, but found Bai still in seclusion, so he returned to Sandie Pass.</p><p>Months had passed, but Sandie Pass remained unchanged. Qin Sang instructed some junior disciples before returning to seclusion.</p><p>He took out the complete magic banner his senior sister had given him and expertly began refining the magic fire.</p><p>The *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* proved extraordinary. Two completely different spirit fires, when refined according to the secret technique, could be integrated into the fire seed without conflict.</p><p>The two spirit fires didn't truly merge into a new fire with combined properties.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated the fire seed with his spiritual sense, a teal flame appearing at his fingertip, then turning black, changing back and forth with ease.</p><p>The flame then dispersed, forming a thin, gauzy layer, its shape constantly shifting.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a blood connection with the spirit fire, a feeling entirely different from controlling it through the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  He had complete control, eliminating any risk of revealing weaknesses during combat.</p><p>However, his current cultivation level prevented him from refining all the Nine Nether Magic Fire within the banners; he still needed the magic banner formation. His immediate goal remained controlling more banners.</p><p>Days turned into weeks.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in his secluded chamber, concentrating on refining the magic fire. Li Yu Fu and the others had been instructed not to disturb him unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>Several more months passed.</p><p>The last trace of illusion in the Fire Lotus Seed was finally filled by the spirit fire!</p><p>Next, he would continuously nourish it with spiritual sense, allowing the spirit fire to nurture the Fire Lotus Seed. When the time was right, the Fire Lotus Seed would 'sprout,' advancing to the next stage and blooming.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the magic banner, rested briefly, and then swiftly departed the Hanling Formation.</p>
