<h1>Chapter 500: As If in a Dream</h1><p>A day in the cave, a thousand years in the world.</p><p>Qin Sang, a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator, was far from reaching such an immortal state.</p><p>However, for cultivators, time did indeed pass extremely quickly during meditative retreats.</p><p>Unknowingly, another month passed in a snap of the fingers.</p><p>The last trace left by the failed consumption of the Kanli Golden Elixir had long been erased from his heart. With a clear mind, Qin Sang once again adjusted his state to its peak.</p><p>Snow Spirit Lotus.</p><p>Iris Flower.</p><p>One white, one red, one yin, one yang, the two spiritual herbs were placed side by side in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>The two spiritual herbs emitted a gentle aura. Even when they met in the air, they wouldn't clash violently like the medicinal power of the Kanli Golden Elixir.</p><p>Right now, other Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Small Cold Realm were surely envious of Qin Sang's luck.</p><p>Unlike the Kanli Golden Elixir, where the main ingredients could be cultivated and refined, these two herbs were mutually dependent and couldn't survive alone. The Snow Spirit Lotus thrived in icy lands, while the Iris Flower needed scorching heat. Thus, they had to grow in a place where cold and heat converged, and the balance between the two had to be perfect, a very demanding condition.</p><p>Such spiritual herbs were a rare find.</p><p>However, supplementary items were, after all, just supplementary.</p><p>Recalling the consumption method instructed by Granny Snake when he chose the spiritual herbs, Qin Sang took out a few restorative and healing pills and held them in his mouth. Then, he lifted one spiritual herb in each hand, holding them up in front of him.</p><p>Spiritual power surged into Qin Sang's palms, transforming them into a furnace to refine the spiritual herbs.</p><p>Starting from the roots, the two spiritual herbs were refined almost simultaneously.</p><p>One transformed into an ice crystal-like spiritual liquid, sparkling and translucent.</p><p>The other was refined into a red spiritual liquid, as if a layer of flame was burning on its surface.</p><p>Qin Sang was very cautious. It took him a long time to slowly refine the impurities from the two spiritual herbs, leaving only the purest essence of their medicinal power.</p><p>The two clusters of spiritual liquid were of equal size, neither more nor less.</p><p>Then, he swallowed the restorative pills in his mouth.</p><p>A moment later, his depleted spiritual power returned to its peak. Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, he gently exhaled, and swallowed the two clusters of spiritual liquid together.</p><p>Miraculously, after entering Qin Sang's meridians, the two clusters of spiritual liquid intertwined into one, flowing together into his Qi Sea.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The familiar storm struck again, but it wasn't as violent as the last time.</p><p>Moreover, the medicinal power of these two spiritual herbs was not only gentle but also far more enduring than the Kanli Golden Elixir.</p><p>After confirming that his Qi Sea was unharmed, Qin Sang immersed himself in meditation and cultivation.</p><p>The Spiritual Eye constantly gushed with rich spiritual energy.</p><p>The Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid in the Jade Pond remained still as a maiden.</p><p>A lone cultivator in meditative retreat.</p><p>A scene of peace and harmony.</p><p>Unfortunately, this peaceful scene persisted for more than ten days and seemed likely to continue.</p><p>From beginning to end, the legendary scene of converging winds and clouds, of heaven and earth intermingling, never appeared.</p><p>Twenty days, enough was enough.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, with endless disappointment in their depths.</p><p>He gave up because there was no need to persist any longer.</p><p>The Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were very potent, their effects far exceeding the Kanli Golden Elixir. They were indeed top-grade spiritual herbs that greatly aided Core Formation.</p><p>But they hadn't brought Qin Sang good fortune.</p><p>He had gained some insights and made some progress, but the crucial condensation of spiritual power only showed subtle signs before the medicinal power quickly depleted.</p><p>Twenty days, as if in a dream.</p><p>[Read books and earn cash] Follow the WeChat public account [Book Friends Base Camp] Read books and earn cash!</p><p>Both the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower had failed. Qin Sang didn't know what other spiritual herbs could help him.</p><p>It was almost impossible to achieve Core Formation by relying solely on spiritual herbs.  Herbs inferior to the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, such as the next tier down from the Kanli Golden Elixir, would have no effect on him.</p><p>Even if he sold everything he owned, how many could he afford?</p><p>Moreover, the effectiveness of such Core Formation assisting elixirs greatly diminished after the second dose.</p><p>"Sigh..."</p><p>A soft sigh echoed in the dim cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat by the edge of the pool, gazing at the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, motionless, lost in thought. He remained seated like this for an entire day.</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared as usual, seemingly having forgotten yesterday's frustration. He left his magical treasures, iron rings, and other items in the cave dwelling, then rode the clouds towards Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>...</p><p>It seemed that Granny Snake was right. The tension between the Small Cold Realm and the Heavenly Path Alliance had eased.  Shaohua Mountain's protective formation had been deactivated, and the patrolling disciples had withdrawn.</p><p>Unhindered, Qin Sang flew into the mountain gate and headed straight for Qi Yuan Shou's cave dwelling.</p><p>Qi Yuan Shou had returned the leadership peak to the current sect leader and occupied a peak on Shaohua Mountain for himself. His disciple, Gao Yang, was also on the mountain, cultivating alongside him.</p><p>The peak wasn't tall but was quite picturesque.</p><p>Its location was right on a main branch of the mountain gate's spiritual vein. The spiritual energy here was even richer than in Qin Sang's Spirit Spring Cave.</p><p>Soon, the green peak came into view, shrouded in a light mist.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his flight, landing gently at the foot of the mountain. The cloud beneath his feet dispersed. He adjusted his clothes, bowed respectfully towards the summit, and announced in a clear voice,</p><p>"Disciple Qin Sang, paying respects to Uncle-Master Qi."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang's voice fell, the mist above churned and parted to the sides, revealing a small path through the fog.  Then, a figure was seen flying down on a sword, landing lightly in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Sword light flashed around him before vanishing.</p><p>"Junior Brother Gao's swordsmanship has become even more refined," Qin Sang complimented.</p><p>"Thanks to the sword Senior Brother gifted me!"</p><p>Gao Yang, constantly cultivating with Qi Yuan Shou, hadn't changed much in appearance or temperament.  Upon seeing Qin Sang, he greeted him warmly and said directly, "Senior Brother Qin, Master is in seclusion. Before he entered seclusion, he explicitly forbade any disturbances.  If Senior Brother has no urgent matter, please wait for a while.  I will inform Master as soon as he exits seclusion..."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to speak.</p><p>Just then, a strange expression appeared on Gao Yang's face. His demeanor turned solemn as he listened intently. After a moment, he bowed towards the mountaintop and said, "Disciple obeys."</p><p>Then, he turned and urged Qin Sang excitedly, "Senior Brother, hurry! Master wants to see you. He just sent a message, telling you to come up yourself!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed to Gao Yang and, using his movement technique, sped towards Qi Yuan Shou's cave dwelling alone.</p><p>He rushed along the path.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang arrived at the cave dwelling, but the entrance was closed, and Qi Yuan Shou was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was puzzled, Qi Yuan Shou's voice came from within the cave.</p><p>"Have you consumed the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower?"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped in front of the cave dwelling and hurriedly bowed, saying, "Greetings, Uncle-Master Qi.  Reporting to Uncle-Master Qi, this disciple has refined the two spiritual herbs."</p><p>Qi Yuan Shou hummed from inside the cave. After a moment of contemplation, he said indifferently, "That's good. It's an explanation for the other Senior Brothers..."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill in his heart.</p><p>As expected, even the Core Formation elders in the sect were keeping an eye on the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower in his possession.</p><p>These two spiritual herbs were exceptionally rare, and even Core Formation cultivators didn't easily acquire them.</p><p>They didn't need them themselves, but they could give them to their personal disciples or relatives.</p>
