<h1>Chapter 786: Demonic Seed Embryo</h1><p>A dark opening appeared on the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated the Golden Yao Lock for protection and flashed to the entrance.</p><p>But unexpectedly, inside was a scene completely different from the Violet Palace. It wasn't a hall filled with stone swords, but a familiar-looking blue-brick passage.</p><p>The floor of the passage was also paved with blue bricks, very smooth.</p><p>The wide passage stretched straight into the darkness. Inside, there were no sculptures, puppets, altars, or anything of the sort. Not even a single word or pattern could be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance and observed. After confirming there was nothing unusual inside, he stepped in.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Footsteps echoed in the empty passage.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the passage. Out of the corner of his eye, he suddenly caught sight of something. He abruptly turned around and saw a jade slip placed squarely in the corner of the passage.</p><p>The jade slip lay there alone, with a few simple lines written on the ground beneath it.</p><p>---</p><p>This is the incomplete work I once cultivated, now I am unable to continue.</p><p>Life is unpredictable, human effort cannot overcome fate.</p><p>Alas! Alas! Alas!</p><p>---</p><p>Finally, there were four more words: Spirit Turtle Islander.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was full of surprise. He composed himself and carefully looked at these lines.</p><p>The person who left the writing signed it as Spirit Turtle Islander, not Green Bamboo, which surprised Qin Sang. He guessed that Spirit Turtle Islander was likely a pseudonym of Senior Green Bamboo.</p><p>Leaving behind his cultivation method, bestowing it upon future generations, guiding those who come after, and not letting his hard work be buriedâ€”this was exactly Senior Green Bamboo's style.</p><p>Back then, in the Violet Palace, when Senior Green Bamboo was being pursued by powerful enemies, he didn't forget to leave behind his life's work, inscribing two killing talismans beside the teleportation formation.</p><p>Moreover, these lines and the writing on the stone pillars of the teleportation formation were clearly from the same hand. The person who left the message was indeed Senior Green Bamboo himself.</p><p>Only this time, there seemed to be no powerful enemies chasing him. The writing was extremely neat, completed stroke by stroke, meticulously, and the strokes appeared very heavy.</p><p>The three large characters for "alas" carried a sense of helplessness that seemed to impact one's heart.</p><p>Qin Sang was moved by the message, his expression grave.</p><p>Seeing the sword marks in the valley, he suspected that Senior Green Bamboo's guidance was meant for him. But he had no other choice. Relying on himself alone, the hope of finding the teleportation formation was too slim. He decided to gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard many rumors about Senior Green Bamboo. He had formed an image in his mind. Although he couldn't grasp the full picture of Senior Green Bamboo, he was at least certain that he was a true sword cultivator who avenged his grudges and settled his grievances.</p><p>But after seeing these lines, he felt that he might have been mistaken. Senior Green Bamboo's guidance and message might not have been for him.</p><p>Or rather, not specifically for any one person.</p><p>Anyone who had cultivated the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" and been teleported here would see the killing talismans he left at the teleportation formation and thus find this place.</p><p>Senior Green Bamboo hoped that someone would continue down this path.</p><p>"Spirit Turtle Islander..."</p><p>It sounded as though Senior Green Bamboo had occupied an island and taken the pseudonym of Islander.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled those renowned Nascent Soul ancestors. He hadn't heard of a similar title. He had previously thought that Senior Green Bamboo must have already formed his Nascent Soul, but now he wasn't so sure.</p><p>He couldn't understand it.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the jade slip beside him. After thinking for a moment, he summoned a Corpse Soldier and simultaneously retreated to the entrance.</p><p>The Corpse Soldier walked over and easily picked up the jade slip, handing it to Qin Sang without encountering any obstacles.</p><p>There were no hidden restrictions around the jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed self-deprecatingly. He picked up the jade slip, hesitated for a moment, and then used his divine sense to examine it.</p><p>While examining the jade slip, Qin Sang's expression changed constantly, sometimes excited, sometimes disappointed. Finally, he opened his eyes and stood there, lost in thought.</p><p>The jade slip contained the first half of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" and the two killing talismans created by Senior Green Bamboo.</p><p>Unlike the Violet Palace, these two killing talismans were complete!</p><p>Senior Green Bamboo's message mentioned that while honing his skills on the sword path, he had gained further insights and could complete the seventh killing talisman, but he had to leave. It wasn't empty talk; he had indeed completed this killing talisman.</p><p>But, that was all!</p><p>With Senior Green Bamboo's extraordinary talent, he could only deduce the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" to the seventh level before being unable to continue, leaving behind these disheartened words.</p><p>"Has this path... ended?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured sadly.</p><p>It was impossible for Senior Green Bamboo not to sense the special sword intent in the teleportation hall. He must have searched everywhere, and now it seemed he had failed.</p><p>Had Senior Green Bamboo broken through to the Nascent Soul stage?</p><p>What did he mean by "human effort cannot overcome fate" in his message? If it was merely being unable to deduce the cultivation method further, it wouldn't warrant such a sigh. Could Senior Green Bamboo have encountered something at that time?</p><p>Qin Sang had a splitting headache.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after reading the jade slip, his doubts hadn't been resolved but had instead increased.</p><p>Inside the jade slip, besides this cultivation method, there was also a secret technique for creating an external avatar. It was a separate avatar secret technique that Senior Green Bamboo created by adapting the demonic cultivation method "Demonic Seed Embryo".</p><p>Obtaining these cultivation methods and secret techniques was indeed something to be happy about, but Qin Sang felt more disappointed.</p><p>Because apart from this, there were no other messages.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to find hidden messages but found nothing.</p><p>"Demonic Seed Embryo..."</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts and carefully studied this avatar secret technique.</p><p>He had originally wondered if Green Bamboo had fallen into the demonic path. After reading it, he suddenly understood and thought to himself, no wonder Senior Green Bamboo left this particular secret technique here.</p><p>"Demonic Seed Embryo" was an unequivocally demonic and evil technique. Those who practiced it would split their own divine soul and refine demonic seeds. Demonic seeds were fragile and needed to be implanted into low-level cultivators to be nurtured.</p><p>Once the demonic seed hatched and the demonic embryo secretly formed, it could gradually devour the host, and then, through blood feeding and various secret techniques, be refined into one's own external avatar.</p><p>The success rate of this evil technique was extremely low.</p><p>Demonic seeds were difficult to refine; it wasn't as simple as just splitting one's divine soul. The cultivator had to endure immense pain and suffer significant damage to their vital energy. Moreover, accidents could easily occur during the hatching of the demonic seed.</p><p>Even after successfully refining the avatar, one had to constantly guard against it backfiring and taking over.</p><p>Once the external avatar escaped control, it could manipulate or even devour the main body.</p><p>But the benefits were obvious. After being refined, the external avatar's cultivation could rapidly increase to the same level as the main body. It could also cultivate independently, act autonomously, and be no different from an ordinary person.</p><p>The reason why Green Bamboo was able to cultivate and modify this demonic technique was surprisingly due to the sword light splitting divine ability granted by the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter".</p><p>According to Green Bamboo's own explanation, after he formed his Gold Core, his mirrored divine ability and swordsmanship rapidly improved. It didn't take long for him to comprehend the sword light splitting divine ability on his own.</p><p>But as his swordsmanship became more and more profound, he gradually sensed something unusual.</p><p>The sword light split by the cultivation method seemed to be different from the one he split himself.</p><p>Green Bamboo was puzzled by this.</p><p>He pondered for many years and finally discovered the mystery.</p><p>The sword light split by the cultivation method carried divine soul power and seemed to have fused with a part of his divine soul!</p><p>And before this, he hadn't noticed it at all.</p>
