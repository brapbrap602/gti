<h1>Chapter 1185: Reversal</h1><p>The Golden Mirror of Transcendence shone with an almost blinding radiance.  </p><p>Endless golden light cascaded like a waterfall, suppressing the fiery chains!  </p><p>Yet, the chains of fire were not to be underestimated, resisting fiercely.  </p><p>In an instant, the heavens and earth seemed to shift.  </p><p>Above the void, water and fire intertwined. With the combined power of two treasures, the chains of fire surged with unending strength, relentlessly assaulting the golden light. Against all odds, they began to push back the golden radiance, gradually gaining the upper hand.  </p><p>Si Di, exerting all his strength to control the Golden Mirror of Transcendence, found himself unable to withstand the combined assault of the two treasures. Seeing the mirror falter, he grew anxious. With a swift motion, he slapped his waist, preparing to summon another treasure.  </p><p>At that moment, a figure silently materialized.  </p><p>It was Chan Ling, who had been lying in wait!  </p><p>Seizing the perfect opportunity, Chan Ling emerged from beneath the Veil of Shadows during the most intense moment of the battle, appearing behind Si Di.  </p><p>His posture was peculiar.  </p><p>He was not standing but sitting cross-legged in mid-air, one hand clutching a jade vial while the other stretched out toward the unsuspecting Si Di, fingers splayed.  </p><p>The jade vial had already been opened, containing a black venom. Though it emitted no scent or visible aura, it exuded an overwhelmingly sinister presence.  </p><p>His other hand was even more sinister, bearing a spider tattoo on its back.  </p><p>The spider was lifelike, as if a real arachnid were perched on his hand.  </p><p>Withdrawing the Veil of Shadows, Chan Ling’s spider tattoo began to glow with a dark light, conjuring a black spider. His fingers moved like spider legs, and the spider itself was grotesque and menacing, clearly no ordinary creature.  </p><p>Anyone who laid eyes on such a vile spider would feel a chill creep into their very soul.  </p><p>As the spider appeared, Chan Ling gave a slight shake of the jade vial, and the venom shot into the spider’s body like an arrow.  </p><p>Having consumed every drop of the venom, the spider grew even more sinister, emitting a low, eerie screech that seemed to pierce directly into the mind.  </p><p>Its two rows of malevolent eyes glowed with malice and greed, fixed unwaveringly on Si Di’s back.  </p><p>The moment Chan Ling revealed himself, Old Demon Tan roared, “Now!”  </p><p>The three Netherworld Pagodas trembled in unison. Old Demon Pei, who had been closely monitoring the battle, immediately activated the pagodas according to their prearranged plan.  </p><p>The crystal spheres, now pitch-black, shot out three massive beams of light that vanished into the Frost Mist Formation.  </p><p>These beams were not aimed at Si Di but instead converged mid-air, forming a dark dome that descended over the battlefield where Si Di and the others were fighting.  </p><p>In that instant, the icy winds and snow were blocked by the dome.  </p><p>The purpose of this move was to neutralize the power of the Frost Bell Formation, preventing its controller from aiding Si Di and disrupting their assassination plan.  </p><p>As long as the Netherworld Pagodas’ power isolated the formation, Si Di would be left completely alone!  </p><p>However, the pagodas’ function did not end there. Old Demon Pei directed them fully at Si Di, and the dome carried a force of suppression and restraint, bearing down on him.  </p><p>The three Nascent Soul cultivators worked in perfect harmony.  </p><p>As Chan Ling appeared and the dome descended, Old Demon Tan suddenly flipped his hand and pressed it against the Triangular Banner.  </p><p>In that moment, the two treasures underwent a reversal. The chains of fire dimmed, while the Triangular Banner’s power surged.  </p><p>Until now, Old Demon Tan’s two treasures had always relied on the chains of fire as the primary weapon, with the banner playing a supporting role.  </p><p>But now, the banner had become the main force.  </p><p>This was the true harmony of water and fire!  </p><p>While the opponent focused on defending against the chains of fire, this unexpected shift made it easy to catch them off guard.  </p><p>And Si Di was precisely that opponent.  </p><p>The water currents converged into a mighty river, surging upward from below and striking at Si Di’s legs with cunning precision.  </p><p>Caught off guard, Si Di had no time to control the Golden Mirror of Transcendence to save himself. Just as he prepared to leap away, the dome above him crashed down.  </p><p>*Crack! Crack!*  </p><p>The river froze into an icy mountain, sealing the space around Si Di. The power of the Profound Water, sharp as blades, surged toward him, joining the assault.  </p><p>Two forces now trapped Si Di between them.  </p><p>However, neither of these was the killing blow. If Si Di could react in time and receive reinforcements from the Frost Bell Formation, he still had a chance to escape.  </p><p>The true killing blow lay with Chan Ling!  </p><p>“Go!”  </p><p>Chan Ling uttered a single word.  </p><p>The spider transformed into a streak of black light, appearing behind Si Di in the next instant.  </p><p>The icy mountain conjured by the Triangular Banner could not stop the spider. In the blink of an eye, the spider burrowed into Si Di’s protective spiritual barrier without the slightest resistance.  </p><p>A sinister smile crept across Chan Ling’s lips. While his other techniques might have delays, this recently mastered evil art perfectly complemented the Veil of Shadows.  </p><p>The spider, fed with potent venom, was specifically designed to breach the protective barriers of cultivators. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator, if caught off guard and bitten by the spider, would face dire consequences.  </p><p>At this moment, Si Di had no way to escape. The three Nascent Soul cultivators wore expressions of confidence.  </p><p>However, they aimed to capture Si Di’s Nascent Soul as well, so Old Demon Pei and Old Demon Tan remained fully vigilant against the Frost Bell Formation, preventing any reinforcements.  </p><p>The next moment, the spider bit into Si Di.  </p><p>What followed left the three Nascent Soul cultivators utterly stunned.  </p><p>The spider’s bite produced a metallic clang, accompanied by its agonized screech. Si Di’s figure flickered and vanished, replaced by the Golden Mirror of Transcendence!  </p><p>A faint shadow of Si Di appeared on the mirror’s surface.  </p><p>Somehow, Si Di’s true body had escaped the trap and appeared where the Golden Mirror of Transcendence had been moments before.  </p><p>In the critical moment, he had switched places with his own treasure!  </p><p>Chan Ling and the others were momentarily dumbfounded. They had watched Si Di vanish from their meticulously laid trap but could not comprehend how he had done it.  </p><p>Si Di’s face was flushed, his breathing rapid, and his expression filled with mockery.  </p><p>He was unharmed, as the Golden Mirror of Transcendence had taken the blow for him.  </p><p>Chan Ling and Old Demon Tan, seasoned veterans, were undeterred by the failed ambush. They immediately prepared to activate their treasures and continue the hunt.  </p><p>Judging by Si Di’s condition, using such an escape technique had clearly taken a heavy toll. There was still a chance!  </p><p>But just as this thought crossed their minds, a thunderous roar erupted from outside the formation, accompanied by Old Demon Pei’s furious cry.  </p><p>The two finally showed signs of alarm!  </p><p>Outside the formation, at the edge of the Netherworld Pagodas, two figures had appeared—both of them Nascent Soul-level experts.  </p><p>“You…”  </p><p>Old Demon Tan, noticing Si Di’s mocking expression, suddenly understood.  </p><p>No wonder they had succeeded so easily. When they launched their ambush, the Frost Bell Formation had not retaliated as expected—because it was not being controlled by a Nascent Soul cultivator!  </p><p>They had thought their plan foolproof.  </p><p>Little did they know, their opponent had been fishing all along!  </p><p>Chan Ling’s expression darkened to the extreme. Countless thoughts raced through his mind.  </p><p>He couldn’t tell whether the opponent had set this trap to lure Old Demon Pei and Old Demon Tan, with him stumbling into it by coincidence, or if he had already been exposed and the opponent had turned the tables on him.  </p><p>If he had been discovered long ago, Chan Ling’s concerns were no longer about the outcome of this battle.  </p><p>As long as he didn’t face figures like True One Daoist, Chan Ling could act with near impunity on the battlefield, thanks to the Veil of Shadows. But the three individuals who had appeared were not among those he feared.  </p><p>Had the Two Realms Alliance already devised a way to counter the Veil of Shadows?  </p><p>“Rescue them!”  </p><p>Chan Ling barked coldly.</p>
