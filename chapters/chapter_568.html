Chapter 561: Above the Nine Heavens, the Immortal Palace Appears

Ahead lies a swirling vortex of wind and clouds.
Behind, countless spatial rifts.
They paused briefly, then descended, flying close to the desert surface, the vortex looming overhead.  Their destination was clearly within the heart of the vortex.

Only upon approach did the true nature of the vortex reveal itself.  It was far from tranquil.
Within, the clouds churned like the sea, a constant, albeit slow, motion.  The density and uniformity of the clouds masked this movement from a distance.
This seemingly peaceful vortex brewed a palpable, terrifying power.
Were it to collapse, no one present, not even Nascent Soul cultivators, would survive.

Qin Sang suppressed his unease, staring up at the swirling clouds.
Judging by the actions of the Nascent Soul grandmasters, the Violet Citadel definitely lay within the vortex.  However, the dense clouds obscured all vision, preventing him from seeing what lay within.
Qin Sang couldn't determine whether this power originated from the vortex itself, or from the Immortal Formation sealing the Violet Citadel hidden deep within.

Lost in thought, Qin Sang was startled when the Red Cloud suddenly stopped again.
They had reached the vortex's core.  Ahead, swirling clouds converged, forming a colossal maelstrom. At its center, a vast void beckoned, yet its contents remained hidden.
Time passed slowly. They waited for over an hour.
The four-colored cloud formations and the Skyfaring Battleship remained motionless.  Even the Nascent Soul grandmasters showed no signs of activity. The purpose of this delay remained a mystery.
Qin Sang looked around.
Duke Dongyang stood nearby, at the edge of the Red Cloud, hands clasped behind his back.
Iron Crown, Morning Mist, Uncle Fengming, and the others, clearly privy to inside information, calmly meditated.
Unable to freely communicate through voice transmission near his master, Qin Sang approached Qiu Mubai, seeking answers.
Ji Qing and the others, equally curious about the Violet Citadel, gathered around.

"The entrance to the Violet Citadel is within the eye of the vortex."
Qiu Mubai, as expected, possessed the knowledge. He pointed at the void, explaining in a low voice, "The time for the Violet Citadel to emerge has not yet arrived. When an anomaly appears within the eye, signifying the Citadel's emergence and the weakening of the Immortal Formation, we will have the opportunity to break the formation and enter. We are simply waiting for the right moment... It shouldn't be much longer."
Qiu Mubai glanced at Qin Sang.
"The Spirit Formation designed to break the Violet Citadel's Immortal Formation is called the Lesser North Star Formation. Developed over countless years by our predecessors, it's the most reliable method. Other Spirit Formations exist, but they are not guaranteed to work and have even provoked the Immortal Formation's defenses, resulting in heavy casualties.
"Constructing the Lesser North Star Formation requires countless rare spiritual materials, including a crucial item called the Star Essence Stone, found only on Skyreach Peak.
"Skyreach Peak's spatial structure is fragile, allowing only a small amount of Star Essence Stone to be collected at a time, lest it collapse completely. Furthermore, Skyreach Peak drifts unpredictably within the Azurecloud Great Marsh, preventing either domain from claiming sole ownership.
"Thus, the two domains agreed to share Skyreach Peak, opening it only before the Violet Citadel emerges to gather Star Essence Stone. This arrangement later evolved into one of the domains' competitive trials.
"Incidentally, we cultivators of the Lesser Cold Domain owe you a debt of gratitude, Junior Brother Qin.
"Your crucial role in that trial secured a victory for the Lesser Cold Domain. Otherwise, we might have been responsible for providing the formation materials, which would have been a substantial burden.
"Therefore, you rightfully earned the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower."

Star Essence Stone... Skyreach Peak...
It all clicked for Qin Sang. Although he had suspected a connection, Qiu Mubai's explanation brought clarity.
That trial was actually linked to the Lesser North Star Formation, making the rewards from Stargazing Island seem rather paltry!
However, Qin Sang reconsidered. The amount of Star Essence Stone collected on Skyreach Peak depended more on luck than strength or morale.
Granny Jing's Star Net was the only anomaly.
Qin Sang still possessed the Star Net; Granny Jing hadn't reclaimed it.
If he were to use the Star Net to cheat in every trial, ensuring victory for the Lesser Cold Domain, the Heavenly Alliance would undoubtedly notice the pattern after a couple of attempts.

Now aware of the situation, Qin Sang and the others waited patiently.
The wait stretched for six long hours.  
Half a day passed before the vortex finally showed signs of change.
Thunderous booms echoed from the eye as the swirling clouds accelerated, their movement now visible to the naked eye.
The entire vortex began to slowly rotate, accompanied by the rumbling sound.
A powerful suction force emanated from the eye, drawing the surrounding clouds upwards.
An endless void in the sky seemed to devour countless clouds without being filled.
As more clouds were absorbed, the void within the eye expanded, its edges becoming increasingly diffuse.
The collision between the upward suction and the vortex's own force created increasing chaos.
Fierce winds howled.
Sand and stones flew through the air.
Turbulent spiritual energy and clouds surged towards them, shaking the Skyfaring Battleship and the four-colored cloud formations.
Everyone watched, mesmerized by the unfolding spectacle.
Such a sight was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, even more so at such close proximity.

The vortex spun faster, reaching its peak within a quarter of an hour.  The eye had expanded tenfold.  With a resounding boom, a brilliant light descended from the heavens, filling the eye and rapidly expanding outwards.
The onlookers gasped, awestruck.
Through the thinning clouds, layers of clouds could be seen, piled high up to the Nine Heavens.  There, resembling a celestial palace, stood a majestic gate.
Emblazoned across the gate were the words "Violet Citadel," identical to the depiction on the Violet Citadel Secret Map!
However, witnessing the gate firsthand was profoundly different from seeing it on the map. The map couldn't capture its magnificence.

The heavily damaged gate bore the marks of countless ages.
A sense of ancient history and profound desolation washed over them as they beheld the gate.
The Violet Citadel's gate stood solitary in the clouds, its former glory faded, not even ruins remaining, only this broken gate.
Yet, it remained standing, the words "Violet Citadel" still gleaming brightly.
A final testament to the Immortal Palace.
A silent narrator of history to future generations!
