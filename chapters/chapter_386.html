Chapter 379: An Unexpected Turn


Looking back now, the bloody rain was completely gone.  The previous experience felt like a dream.  In its place were countless, incredibly intricate runes floating in the air.


Qin Sang clicked her tongue in wonder, turning to look at the deep mountain cave.


The cave was silent. The entrance was only wide enough for one person to pass through, but it seemed to widen further inside. There was no overwhelming demonic energy, no ghostly figures; everything appeared normal.


Qin Sang glanced at the cave wall.  A shimmering glaze coated the smooth stone, its fine texture as hard as metal, exceptionally strong.


The entire mountain was covered by a restriction.  Not only were earth-遁 spells unusable, but brute force was ineffective as well. To pass through the mountain, one had to go through the cave.


However, this cave felt very strange to Qin Sang; it didn't seem naturally formed. Could it have been opened by a powerful cultivator using immense magic?


Qin Sang was startled.


“Senior, can we reach the inner valley by going through this cave?”


Yun Youzi nodded, staring into the depths of the cave as if searching for something. Then, with a gesture, a beam of white light flew out of the cave and landed in his palm.


“No one else has been here!”


Yun Youzi nodded, about to enter the cave, when he suddenly remembered something. He took out a jade bottle and tossed it to Qin Sang.  “Qin Lao Di, take this.”


Qin Sang took the bottle and looked inside. It contained two dark green pills.


The two pills were identical, about the size of a dragon's eye. Their surfaces were uneven, as if coated in mud, looking rather strange. A dark green aura emanated from them, filling the bottle.


The healing and medicinal pills she had seen before, while varying in color, were mostly crystalline and translucent, with an impressive appearance—clearly precious pills.  She had never seen such bizarre-looking pills.


Could they be poison?


Qin Sang muttered to herself.


Opening the bottle, an extremely foul odor hit her, making her nauseous. Qin Sang's face changed, and she quickly closed the bottle.


Yun Youzi laughed heartily. “Qin Lao Di, don't let the pills’ strange appearance fool you. We'll need them to save our lives later. Keep them; take them when I tell you to.”


Seeing Yun Youzi being secretive, Qin Sang didn't ask further.  From the smell, she could tell the pills weren’t poisonous.


These green pills weren't poison; they probably had another function.


Qin Sang suppressed her curiosity, held the jade bottle, and followed Yun Youzi into the cave.


The passage was dark and lightless. Even with spiritual energy infused into her eyes, she could only barely see her immediate surroundings. Yun Youzi didn't bother lighting a fire, moving silently through the passage.


They could clearly feel the passage sloping downwards, becoming increasingly steep. Without Yun Youzi's instructions, Qin Sang dared not use her spiritual energy, and could only walk.


After an unknown amount of time, Yun Youzi stopped.


Then, Qin Sang heard Yun Youzi's voice transmission, "Qin Lao Di, the path ahead is difficult; you can't use spiritual energy. Be careful, don't slip. And, when you see my signal, take one of the pills immediately.”


Qin Sang walked forward and saw that the mountain wall remained on the right, but the left side had become very wide, with no visible end.


The path hadn't ended, but it had become extremely narrow, only wide enough for a single foot.


The air was very humid, and it seemed there was a pool of water below.


At the same time, Qin Sang noticed a green mist floating ahead, and smelled a faint fishy stench, identical to the pills' odor.


Seeing this, Qin Sang had a general idea.


The two pressed their backs against the stone wall and slowly moved forward. The stone path continued to slope downwards.  After walking a long distance, Qin Sang didn't hear any flowing water, but the air grew noticeably more humid.


And the green mist became denser, the stench overwhelming.


Suddenly, Yun Youzi stopped and remained motionless for a long time.


Qin Sang wondered what was wrong, and looked to the side. She saw Yun Youzi staring ahead with a doubtful expression.


"Senior, what's wrong?"


Qin Sang's heart sank. She prepared her magical artifact and transmitted her question.


Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment before replying, "There's no sound."


No sound?


Qin Sang thought, Isn't this good news?


Yun Youzi then explained to Qin Sang.


"This used to be a nest of Star Poison Frogs. This green mist is their breath.


"These frogs are extremely venomous.  Even Golden Core cultivators would retreat and avoid contact with their poison when facing adult Star Poison Frogs."


However, strangely, a common toad's scent is remarkably similar to that of the star poison frog.

"I collected some venom from common toads, combined it with several foul-smelling herbs, and refined it into a pill.  It allows the user to mask their scent for about half an hour, almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

"This will deceive the star poison frog's senses, allowing us to easily pass through its lair.

"I wonder why, even though we're here, we haven't heard any star poison frogs. Could something have happened to them?"

Qin Sang looked ahead, but the thick green fog obscured everything.  "Senior, were the star poison frogs always croaking when you came here before?"

"Yes!"

Yun Youzi nodded.  "The sounds of the star poison frogs aren't much different from ordinary frogs; you can hear them from afar."

"Could the star poison frogs be hibernating?"

Qin Sang racked her brains. "Besides that, what other changes are there? Such as the fog, or the smell?"

"Nothing, that's why I find it so strange… Never mind! Qin, swallow that pill. Let's go and see..."

Yun Youzi made up his mind, swallowed the pill, and continued forward.

Shortly after, Qin Sang noticed the green fog had disappeared from underfoot.  It wasn't a pool of water, but a mire.

The stone path no longer went down, but continued straight ahead.

They proceeded cautiously along the edge of the mire, both Yun Youzi and Qin Sang on high alert.

After a few steps, Qin Sang noticed something unusual in the depths of the green fog and quickly stopped Yun Youzi.  "Senior, look, what's that?"

Yun Youzi paused, looked in the direction Qin Sang indicated, and his expression changed. He took a thin, transparent thread from his pouch and flicked it.

The thread silently shot into the green fog and returned, carrying a white object.

It was the corpse of a poison frog!

About the size of a hand.  Its belly was white, its back a dark green that blended with the fog, covered with bumps and lumps.  Smeared with mire, it looked even more disgusting.

"Dead!"

Qin Sang pointed to the frog's head; there was a hole through its skull, a fatal blow.

"It's a juvenile star poison frog!"

Yun Youzi's face was grim. "Killed so easily, and its precious venom sac removed."
