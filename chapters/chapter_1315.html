<h1>Chapter 1307: Yun Tai</h1><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p>A Qi cultivator sighed inwardly, quietly instructing his confidants to monitor the movements of the Two Realms Alliance. These old fellows were unruly and wouldn't completely obey his orders.</p><p>“Where are Ye Laomo’s associates being held?”</p><p>An elder suddenly spoke, looking at the Qi cultivator.</p><p>The Qi cultivator was about to answer when a middle-aged man beside the elder sneered, “Ye Laomo is clearly insane. Do you think you can threaten him with these people? His associates and successors are merely tools to deceive others; Ye Laomo wouldn't reveal any secrets to them.”</p><p>“Thinking back, I’ve never heard of Ye Laomo having any blood relatives alive.  It's a pity his few disciples were quite talented.”</p><p>Someone said indifferently.</p><p>Ye Laomo had offended so many factions; it was easy to imagine the fate of his disciples.  Unable to find Ye Laomo, they could only vent their anger on them.</p><p>These old masters didn't lack methods of torture; even death would be a difficult escape.</p><p>Even among Yuan Ying cultivators, there were Ye Laomo's loyalists, such as Jiang Chenzi, but Ye Laomo killed them all before they could act.  The brutal execution of Yuan Ying cultivators showed just how ruthless and vicious Ye Laomo was.</p><p>The other demonic cultivators merely submitted to Ye Laomo's overwhelming power, not out of loyalty.</p><p>“I’ll go take a look.”</p><p>The elder coldly snorted, rising and walking out.</p><p>The Qi cultivator silently mourned for those people.</p><p>At that moment, a wave of energy suddenly came from outside the hall.</p><p>“Master Cang Hong is back!”</p><p>Everyone abruptly stood up.</p><p>The next moment, Master Cang Hong entered, and the elder quickly stopped.</p><p>Seeing that Master Cang Hong was alone, a sense of foreboding washed over everyone.</p><p>“I’m afraid I’ve disappointed you all. My skills were insufficient, and I couldn't stop Ye Laomo. He escaped into the Sinful God Palace.  Fairy Qiu Zhi is setting up an array to seal the exit.”</p><p>Master Cang Hong looked around at everyone, his tone slightly heavy.  “Furthermore, I’ve just received news…”</p><p>An hour later, everyone filed out, each with a grave expression, hurrying along.</p><p>…</p><p>Two Realms Alliance Camp.</p><p>Everyone was discussing strategies to break the array.</p><p>Suddenly, a Foundation Establishment junior entered to report, presenting a jade slip.</p><p>Daoist Zhen Yi took the jade slip, his face showing a hint of surprise. He chuckled, “This is a handwritten note from Master Cang Hong. The Abyss wants to negotiate.”</p><p>“Negotiate or surrender?”</p><p>Everyone was astonished.</p><p>They had expected this day to come. Even if they drove the enemy out of the Abyss, it would be difficult to eliminate them completely, as they still had top experts.</p><p>They just didn't expect it to happen so soon.</p><p>“Negotiate!”</p><p>Daoist Zhen Yi emphasized. “The specific terms will be discussed face-to-face tomorrow morning.  What do you all think?”</p><p>Saying this, Daoist Zhen Yi passed the jade slip around for everyone to read.</p><p>“It’s not unexpected that they want to negotiate. The Ku Yuan Dan was a complete fraud. Continuing the fight won't benefit the Abyss at all.”</p><p>“However, unless we force them into a desperate situation, they won't easily give in.  Negotiating now will make it hard to get the best terms.”</p><p>“It wouldn't hurt to meet them first and see what they offer. If we can't reach an agreement, we can fight again!”</p><p>“We don't know whether Ye Laomo is dead or alive.  Their eagerness to negotiate suggests a change of circumstances. They must have discovered something. We need to find out.”</p><p>“Yes! We must uncover everything about Ye Laomo!”</p><p>“Master Cang Hong wrote in his note that he can discuss Ye Laomo with us. It seems he wants to use this as a bargaining chip.”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone discussed animatedly, quickly shifting the topic to Ye Laomo.</p><p>Clearly, like the Abyss’ Yuan Ying cultivators, their interest in Ye Laomo far surpassed everything else.  For them, conquering the Abyss was merely gaining territory; the secrets Ye Laomo held were far more valuable.</p><p>Master Cang Hong had seized upon this point!</p><p>Demon Lord Tong You tapped his fingers on the table and said solemnly, “This war has inflicted heavy losses on the Two Realms. It's time for peace and recovery. However, as you fellow Daoists have said, we can't let them off easily. The Abyss must compensate us for the losses it has caused.  Furthermore, the situation has reversed, and if they want to negotiate, they must give up certain things.  Additionally, the previously decided attack plan will continue!”</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p><p>Negotiations were acceptable, but the Abyss couldn't use them to stall!</p><p>At this moment, Qu Huan suddenly spoke, “I don't care about anything else, but tell them they must deliver a Huang Luo Vine!”</p><p>“A Huang Luo Vine? Isn't that one of Xing Heng Sect's most precious medicinal herbs?  It's said that only one mature Huang Luo Vine emerges every thousand years and is never circulated externally?”</p><p>Elder Ji exclaimed in surprise, revealing the vine's origin.</p><p>Qu Huan chuckled, “Elder Ji, you are indeed knowledgeable! That’s right. If the Huang Luo Vine weren't so rare, I would have gotten my hands on it long ago.”</p><p>Master Zhen nodded slightly: "Daoist Qu's contributions are evident. Since you have a request, we will do our utmost to help.  If any of you have requests, please state them now so we can proceed effectively."</p><p>The negotiators were tentatively selected: Master Zhen, Elder Ji, Lord Tongyou, Qing Jun, and Qin Sang, along with Qu Huan, who was most familiar with the Abyss of Sin.</p><p>"Oh? Daoist Leng is still outside?"</p><p>Master Zhen looked at Qin Sang, asking in surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Master, don't worry. I will inform Daoist Leng of the situation. If he hasn't returned by tomorrow morning, we needn't wait for him."</p><p>After breaching Yu City's protective array, Qing Jun found Qin Sang, claiming an urgent matter required immediate attention, then left and hasn't returned.</p><p>Qin Sang, unsure of the reason, didn't ask further and temporarily assumed her senior sister's duties.</p><p>Fortunately, the Abyss of Sin remained within the city walls, not daring to attack, so there were no unforeseen events.</p><p>…</p><p>All night, the area outside the city was brightly lit.  The Two Realms Alliance prepared for war in an orderly manner, unaffected by the upcoming negotiations.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>As the east brightened, the morning light shone alongside the golden protective dome.</p><p>Qing Jun had not returned.</p><p>The battle erupted, the cries of war shaking the heavens.</p><p>Few noticed five figures silently ascending into the sky.</p><p>Clouds gathered, forming a wide cloud platform high above.  The moment they stepped onto it, several figures appeared on the other side, the central figure being Master Canghong.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a familiar face: Fairy Qiu Zhi.</p><p>Their eyes met, acknowledging each other with a nod.  Despite their recent battle, there was little animosity between them; rather, a certain admiration for each other's abilities.</p><p>"You dare venture outside the city, Daoist? Are you not afraid we'll attack?"</p><p>Master Zhen raised his whisk, his eyes narrowed, his tone icy.</p><p>"Try it, if you dare."</p><p>Master Canghong seemed fearless. His gaze swept across the five, noting Qing Jun's absence, his expression unchanged as he stepped onto the cloud platform.</p><p>Qin Sang activated her Sky-Eyed Butterfly, discovering a subtle golden armor on these individuals, seemingly originating from the same source as the golden protective dome of the array.</p>
