<h1>**Chapter 140: Natal Sword of Essence**</h1><p>After planting the Nine Illusions Orchid, Qin Sang sealed the cave entrance, took out the Five Elements Law Breaking Sword, sacrificed it and put it aside. He turned his mind inwards to read the chapter on Essence Nurturing Sword.</p><p>The partial Essence Nurturing Sword technique had five levels. The first level taught cultivators to merge their sword with their soul, nurture their sword with their essence, and visualize killing incantations. The second to fourth levels were the true cultivation method, corresponding to the Foundation Establishment period. The fifth level corresponded to the initial stage of Golden Core, and the subsequent levels were missing.</p><p>Just reading the cultivation process of the first level made one's scalp tingle.</p><p>Qin Sang read the entire chapter. Although he had the protection of the Jade Buddha and was not afraid of the killing intent eroding his mind, he was still a little apprehensive.</p><p>Merging the sword with his soul would cause his essence to be cut by the spiritual sword, and when the spiritual sword was placed in his essence and fused with it, he would have to endure the pain of the sword energy devouring his soul at all times.</p><p>During cultivation, he needed to have a strong willpower to calm his mind and focus. Only after he condensed the first killing incantation would he be able to control the sword energy in his heart, and the pain would gradually become better.</p><p>Nurturing the sword with essence was also the process of refining the sword.</p><p>At each level of the technique, he needed to visualize the killing incantation in the technique during cultivation, draw the purest killing intent into his essence, and use his essence as a furnace to use the killing intent to refine the spiritual sword, until a killing incantation was engraved on the sword.</p><p>Once the killing incantation was engraved, the spiritual sword's sword energy would carry an extreme killing intent.</p><p>When fighting others, once the spiritual sword was released, the killing intent would erupt and have a soul-stirring effect. Those with poor mental fortitude might even be scared out of their wits by the terrifying killing intent and lose without fighting.</p><p>In addition, the killing incantation could also help the cultivator absorb spirit energy into their body and increase their cultivation speed. This was also the reason why Qin Sang had not hesitated to choose this technique.</p><p>Due to his mediocre aptitude, he had to seize every opportunity to increase his cultivation speed. One killing incantation might not be enough to make up for the lack of his aptitude, but the more he advanced, the more killing incantations he could condense, and his cultivation speed might even be comparable to those with true spiritual roots. This was something he had never dared to think of before.</p><p>No wonder Senior Jade Bamboo's cultivation speed was so fast. His aptitude was not as bad as QIn Sang's, and after gaining the killing incantation, he surpassed true geniuses, but he also paid the price of splitting his essence and becoming half-crazy. It was unknown whether he was alive or dead now.</p><p>The requirements of the Essence Nurturing Sword technique for cultivators were not limited to this. They also needed a high-quality spiritual sword to fuse with their essence and become their natal sword for mutual cultivation.</p><p>The killing incantation was the condensation of extreme killing intent.</p><p>This incantation was engraved on the body of the spiritual sword, so the requirements for the spiritual sword itself were extremely high. If the material and strength of the spiritual sword were not enough, the spiritual sword would collapse on its own before the killing incantation could be completed.</p><p>If it were anyone else, they would have to choose a suitable top-grade or上品法器. Qin Sang could directly use the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was originally a fragment of a magic treasure. Its strength was self-evident, but it still did not fully meet the requirements of the technique.</p><p>The Essence Nurturing Sword technique required the material of the spiritual sword to be extremely pure. Of the five elements of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, only one could be selected, and mixed materials could not withstand the pressure of the killing incantation.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was later re-sacrificed by the Song family's refining master, and although it became a magic treasure that even Foundation Establishment cultivators could use, there were also many impurities on the spiritual sword, and its quality was far inferior to that of the magic treasure itself. Qin Sang needed to refine these impurities bit by bit during the process of nurturing the sword with essence.</p><p>According to Qin Sang's estimate, the Ebony Sword could at least withstand two killing incantations, enough for him to advance to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Once all the impurities on the Ebony Sword were refined away, it would turn into a sword embryo. After that, Qin Sang would need to collect as many spirit trees as possible and refine them into the sword embryo bit by bit to strengthen the Ebony Sword.</p><p>When the Ebony Sword fused with enough spirit trees, according to the technique, if the material of the spiritual sword was strong enough, after reaching the fourth level, which was the late stage of Foundation Establishment, and after engraving the fourth killing incantation, the威威力of the spiritual sword would be comparable to a low-grade magic treasure! This spiritual sword would also be one of his natal magic treasures after he advanced to the Golden Core period.</p><p>The reason why it was only one was because the Essence Nurturing Sword technique had another magical characteristic that after advancing to Golden Core, the spiritual sword of the mutual cultivation would not take up the cultivator's natal magic treasure slot. If the cultivator was rich, he could refine another magic treasure and place it in the dantian to nourish with the dan fire.</p><p>However, the Essence Nurturing Sword technique was incomplete and did not have a higher technique after advancing to the middle stage of Golden Core. If the cultivator changed to another technique, they would have to give up their natal spiritual sword and turn it into an ordinary magic treasure.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn’t think about it at the moment. He could only drool over the thought of possessing a Natal Spiritual Sword comparable to a magic weapon during the Foundation Establishment period.</p><p>After he purified the impurities from the Ebony Sword, only a small piece of magic weapon fragment remained. He couldn’t even imagine the gap between it and a genuine magic weapon. How many Wood Element spiritual materials would he need to fuse before it could reach the quality of a magic weapon?</p><p>After Qin Sang obtained the Primordial Spirit Nurture Sword Chapter, he順便 checked out the records on how to refine magic weapons at the Treasure Pagoda Peak.</p><p>In order to refine their Natal Magic Weapons, Golden Core cultivators would travel the world, racking their brains, entering dangerous mystic realms, and spending more than ten years or even decades before they could barely gather enough spiritual materials.</p><p>Some Golden Core cultivators even made do with extreme magic weapons and talisman treasures.</p><p>With his current cultivation at the Foundation Establishment period, even if Qin Sang didn’t cultivate every day and spent his time running around outside, with good luck, he might be able to gather enough spiritual wood in his lifetime. However, that would’ve taken up all his cultivation time. What was the point of having a magic weapon then?</p><p>Unless Qin Sang could find the the Ten Great Divine Trees that were only found in legends in the cultivation world, it was possible to succeed in one attempt and possess a spiritual sword comparable to a genuine magic weapon during the Foundation Establishment period.</p><p>However, those Ten Great Divine Trees only existed in old books and legends. Even if they had existed in the mortal world before, it was during the ancient times when spiritual energy was abundant and natural treasures were everywhere. By now, they had long since disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang read through the Primordial Spirit Nurture Sword Chapter from start to finish, placing emphasis on the five killing symbols in the technique. They were extremely profound and each had a different form. However, they all exuded a shocking killing intent.</p><p>The first two symbols were still okay. With the fifth killing symbol, Qin Sang didn’t even dare use his Divine Sense to touch it.</p><p>If it weren’t for the Jade Buddha maintaining his true self, his soul would’ve been dragged into an illusion of a bloody battlefield the moment he made contact with it, and his Divine Sense would’ve been consumed by the terrifying killing intent, turning him into a walking corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang sat motionlessly in his cave dwelling, constantly contemplating the Primordial Spirit Nurture Sword Chapter.</p><p>Ten days later, Qin Sang’s eyes suddenly flashed open. With an idea in his mind, the Ebony Sword flew out of his Dantian and suspended itself in front of him.</p><p>Recalling the requirements for the first layer of the Primordial Spirit Nurture Sword Chapter, he guided his spiritual energy with his Divine Sense and carved runes onto the Ebony Sword.</p><p>After some time, the Ebony Sword was covered in tiny, intricate runes. Its appearance changed completely.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Ebony Sword for a long time, his eyes gradually firming. Finally, he inhaled deeply and led the Ebony Sword into his Sea of Consciousness, placing it in front of his Primordial Spirit.</p>
