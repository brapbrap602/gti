Chapter 108: Trespass


“Senior Brother Sun, fellow Daoists, I may not be able to make it to the next gathering. Please accept my apologies in advance.”
Qin Sang raised his glass and toasted everyone.
A swordsman in a green robe’s expression shifted slightly. He leaned forward and asked, “Fellow Daoist Qin, are you about to have a breakthrough?”
Qin Sang nodded with a smile, immediately drawing congratulations and envious glances.
Since joining Lesser Hua Mountain, he had never slackened in his cultivation. A few days ago, he finally sensed the vital energy for breaking through to the tenth level. He had spent the last couple of days adjusting his mindset, preparing to return to his cave tonight for secluded cultivation.
With this breakthrough, he would be able to return to Lesser Hua Mountain and receive a Foundation Establishment Pill. However, Qin Sang wasn't planning on taking it immediately. With his talent, taking it too early would be a waste. He had cultivated for so long; he had the patience to wait until he reached the thirteenth level.
It was a shame the Kuiyin Sect attacked so early. If he had a few more years, he could have had two Foundation Establishment Pills.
Sun De was also exceptionally happy. He raised his glass toward the moon and exclaimed, “Then let us wish Brother Qin an early breakthrough, so we can celebrate your success!”
……
Back in his cave, Qin Sang inspected the Earth Sinkhole, sent a message talisman to his sect to report his status, and routinely set up the Bewildering Mirror Formation in his cave. Then he sat on the Water Heart Bamboo cushion, silently recited the *Qingjing Jing* several times, and when he achieved a state of tranquility, he entered meditative cultivation, circulating his cultivation technique.
The bottleneck of the tenth level was as difficult to break through as the ninth level. However, there was a method, and all it needed was time and effort. More than twenty days passed in a blink of an eye, and Qin Sang smoothly broke through to the tenth level. Although ecstatic, he didn’t stop. He remained in meditative cultivation, consolidating his newly achieved, still unstable realm.
Time flew by. Qin Sang remained in seclusion, while more than a dozen message talismans accumulated outside his cave.
The Earth Sinkhole was deathly silent and desolate. Waves of Yin Sha Qi surged from the ground, attempting to break through the seal. The escaping Yin Sha Qi constantly eroded the surrounding forests and vegetation.
One day, a figure silently intruded into this area. Standing at the edge of the Earth Sinkhole, he stared into the deep opening below, his gaze flickering.
This person wore the Dust-Clean Robe of Lesser Hua Mountain. It was Sun De!
Sun De stared at the Earth Sinkhole for a moment, a contemplative look on his face. He muttered to himself, “One month should be enough. I hope Junior Brother Qin will be up to the task.”
With that, Sun De looked around, then swiftly entered a crevice beside the Earth Sinkhole. He seemed very familiar with the Earth Sinkhole, knowing the winding fissures and passages like the back of his hand. His figure flashed repeatedly, and soon he appeared before Qin Sang's cave.
Seeing the message talismans hovering outside the cave’s restrictive formation, Sun De counted them, not one missing, a cryptic smile appearing on his face. With a wave of his hand, he collected all the talismans.
*Bang, bang…*
Sun De stood at the entrance and knocked twice on the stone door. Hearing no response, he impatiently pressed his hand against the door. Spiritual energy surged from his palm, and the cave’s restrictive formation immediately began to disintegrate.
Inside the cave, Qin Sang was both shocked and furious. Awakened by the knocking, he had just recovered his composure when he realized that the person outside was breaking the formation.
The restrictive formation left on the cave by the sect was not weak. Ordinary rogue cultivators would find it difficult to break in. Qin Sang had set up the Bewildering Mirror Formation as an extra precaution.
The intruder was cracking the formation with such ease. Who was he?
Qin Sang racked his brain. Since joining Lesser Hua Mountain, he had been honest and kept to himself, never provoking anyone.  He shouldn't have offended anyone. Could it be a rogue cultivator who had stumbled into the Earth Sinkhole, discovered the cultivator's cave within, and had malicious intent?
Regardless of this person’s identity, trespassing into his cave without permission was definitely a hostile act. With the intruder right outside, any message talisman sent to the sect for help would surely be intercepted.
Qin Sang's thoughts raced. Seeing the mirror formation in front of him, he felt slightly reassured. He thought to himself, *The mirror formation is right by the door. As soon as the intruder opens the cave, he will be trapped.* *If the enemy is powerful, I will seize the opportunity to escape while he's trapped and send a message talisman for help.*
*With all my top-grade magical artifacts, even if I can't defeat him, I should be able to hold out until the sect’s reinforcements arrive, especially with that black pearl.*
*If this person is weak, I'll kill him with one strike, and no one can blame me. The Earth Sinkhole is the perfect place to dispose of a body.*
With this thought, Qin Sang quickly calmed down. He glanced at the fluctuating restrictive formation on the cave door, sent a clone to sit on the cushion, hid his true body in a corner, and summoned his Ebony Sword. 


He had broken through to the tenth level, possessing profound spiritual power. He could control his sword to slay enemies without replenishing spiritual stones, though channeling sword Qi was extremely taxing. Without prior preparation, he couldn't sustain it for long.

To be safe, Qin Sang still took out a mid-grade spiritual stone, secretly accumulating spiritual power.

A moment later, the cave entrance emitted a 'crack', the restrictive light flickered, then vanished as the door was pushed open from the outside.

Sun Degang opened the cave entrance.  Darkness immediately enveloped him as he fell into the Mirror Array ambush, his whole body entangled in black mist. Yet, his face showed no panic.  Examining the swirling black Qi, a smile played on his lips. "A cursed tool personally refined by Old Ghost Yi... Junior Brother Qin is truly cautious, no wonder you've managed to survive until now.  Unfortunately, you're destined to become a sacrifice."

Speaking, Sun De drew a mystical rune in the air before him and struck it into the black mist. Immediately, the black mist began to dissipate.

Outside, Qin Sang saw it more clearly. Not long after Sun Degang entered the Mirror Array, the Bewitching Mirrors themselves began to tremble violently, emitting subtle 'crackling' sounds.  Fine cracks appeared on their surfaces, threatening to shatter them completely. The black mist within dispersed at an alarming rate.

Initially, upon discovering the intruder was Sun De, Qin Sang was surprised, wondering if it was a misunderstanding.

Of course, Qin Sang had no intention of stopping. Sun De had trespassed into his cave. Misunderstanding or not, he had to subdue him first; otherwise, he would be the one in danger.

Seeing the Bewitching Mirrors easily broken by Sun De, Qin Sang was horrified. Without hesitation, he silently recited the sword incantation. Sword Qi surged from the Ebony Sword, instantly plunging into the black mist.

"Ah!"

A scream erupted from the black mist, followed by Sun De scrambling out of the Mirror Array.  His left arm was severed at the shoulder, blood gushing out. His smug smile vanished, replaced by a deathly pallor.

Clutching his wound with one hand, Sun De met Qin Sang's icy gaze.  His eyes bulged, his face filled with shock.  He cried out, "Tenth level! You're still alive?"

Qin Sang frowned, sighing inwardly at the missed opportunity. He launched a Yin Thunder attack, then with a thought, recalled the Ebony Sword, aiming it directly at Sun De's vital point.
