<h1>Chapter 675: The Ember Sparrow and the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet</h1><p>“Greetings, Senior! What would you like to purchase? I can fetch it for you.”</p><p>The attendant, a cultivator at the eighth level of Qi Refining, had an air of worldliness about her, her mannerisms flirtatious and her tone laced with flattery and charm.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Ran Luo mentioning that many low-level cultivators in the Demon Sea, especially female cultivators, willingly became concubines or even cauldrons for high-level cultivators for survival and cultivation.</p><p>Such things weren't unheard of in the Canglang Sea, but at least there was a pretense of discretion, not this blatant display.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't feel it was his place to judge, and said in a normal tone, “I'd like to buy one type of spiritual material and two types of spiritual herbs, all of the rare variety. Please take me to your manager.”</p><p>A flicker of disappointment crossed the attendant’s eyes. She complied and led Qin Sang upstairs.</p><p>The manager here was only a cultivator at the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura, and the manager immediately welcomed him warmly, dismissing the attendant with a wave of his hand.</p><p>After they were seated in a private room, Qin Sang got straight to the point. “I'm looking for a natural treasure called the Myriad-Year Camphorwood, as well as two spiritual herbs known as the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet and the Soul-Guiding Grass.  Do you have any in stock?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's directness, the manager understood he was dealing with a dedicated cultivator who didn’t appreciate distractions. Without further ado, he replied calmly, “Please wait a moment, Senior. I’ll check the storehouse. If we don’t have them, it might take a bit longer. I'll send someone to contact the various trading companies on Sky Witch Island to inquire for you, so you don't have to go around yourself.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang sized up the manager. The man looked to be about fifty, with a goatee, and seemed rather shrewd.  No wonder he was a manager on Sky Witch Island.</p><p>“Good. If you can find what I need, you'll be well rewarded. I'll wait patiently here.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior.”</p><p>The manager’s face lit up with joy, and he hurriedly excused himself.</p><p>After a good while, the manager returned. “I apologize for the wait, Senior. I've had my people inquire with the major trading companies, and none have the Myriad-Year Camphorwood or the Soul-Guiding Grass. However, we learned that the Wuchen Trading Company happens to have two Six-Petal Butterfly Violets on consignment. As you wish, Senior, should I have them delivered here, or…?”</p><p>As expected, neither the Myriad-Year Camphorwood nor the Soul-Guiding Grass was available.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, but two Six-Petal Butterfly Violets were an unexpected boon. He stood up and tossed a small bag of spirit stones to the manager. “Have someone lead the way; I’ll go there myself. By the way, do you know where I can find the most detailed map, including the distribution of demonic beasts?”</p><p>Unable to find the Myriad-Year Camphorwood, he had to pursue the Ember Sparrow.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously investigated a few places with scattered traces of Ember Sparrows, but the likelihood of finding Myriad-Year Camphorwood in those locations was slim.</p><p>The Myriad-Year Camphorwood should attract at least a flock of Ember Sparrows.  Only a large number of Ember Sparrows in one area would suggest the presence of the Myriad-Year Camphorwood.</p><p>The manager hefted the small bag, his face beaming.  “Not only a map, Senior, even a list of treasures from the Grand Auction, I can manage to obtain.  Please come back later to retrieve it, and I'll have everything arranged for you.”</p><p>“A list of treasures from the Grand Auction?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a low voice, “Can you guarantee its accuracy?”</p><p>The manager puffed out his chest. “Rest assured, Senior. Sky Witch Island actually releases it intentionally, so it's definitely accurate. However, no one can find out about the most valuable treasures reserved for the finale.  Only by attending the auction itself will you know what they are.”</p><p>“Good, bring that as well.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t yet committed to the Qiongyu Trading Company. If the Grand Auction had something he needed, he intended to stay and decide where to go after it concluded.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the Wuchen Trading Company's outpost, where the manager, having received notice, was already waiting.</p><p>“The senior who consigned the Six-Petal Butterfly Violets requests that they be exchanged for a talisman treasure.”</p><p>The manager of the Wuchen Trading Company, a woman of the Wu tribe, placed the jade box containing the Six-Petal Butterfly Violets before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the box. Inside lay two flowers.</p><p>Their six petals unfurled naturally, like butterfly wings, brilliantly colored and exceptionally beautiful.</p><p>“A talisman treasure?”</p><p>Considering the exchange condition, Qin Sang mentally calculated. The value of two Six-Petal Butterfly Violets was less than a complete talisman treasure, but as he urgently needed them, the exchange was acceptable.</p><p>However, two Six-Petal Butterfly Violets were only enough for the Skyeye Butterfly to transition to the mid-second transformation stage. It showed how difficult it was to cultivate a rare insect.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang took out a talisman treasure he obtained from Daoist Jiu Pao.</p><p>The female manager took it, examined it, and said delightedly, “Senior, this talisman treasure is fully potent, a rare and excellent piece. I'll contact that senior immediately. He will certainly be willing to exchange.”</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped the female manager. “When you contact him, tell him I'd like to meet him and make his acquaintance. Ask if he's willing.”</p><p>The Spirit Controlling Sect's pharmacopoeia had a detailed description of the Six-Petal Butterfly Violet.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell at a glance that these two flowers were definitely picked within the last two years.</p><p>Six-Petal Butterfly Violets didn't grow in isolation. When they appeared, it was always at least a few plants together.  This person might have more Six-Petal Butterfly Violets, or perhaps he could be persuaded to reveal their location.</p><p>Seeing the female manager's hesitation, Qin Sang's expression darkened, and he said coldly, “The meeting will take place here.  You’ll still get your cut.”</p><p>The female manager's expression eased, and she hurriedly left.</p><p>Soon, heavy footsteps approached from outside. A brawny Wu tribesman pushed the door open and strode in, complaining, "If you want to buy spirit herbs, just buy them. Why the extra trouble of calling me here? I don’t believe you’re this interested in making friends. Just say what you want."</p><p>The tribesman sat down heavily across from Qin Sang, slapped the jade box on the table, and stared fixedly at the talisman treasure in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't take offense, and chuckled. "You're straightforward, Fellow Daoist Wu.  Then I’ll be frank. I’m willing to buy these two Six-Petal Butterfly Violets."</p><p>Qin Sang pushed the talisman treasure forward.</p><p>The tribesman took it, examined it, and exclaimed with admiration, “That girl didn't lie to me. This truly is a fine talisman treasure.”</p><p>Qin Sang caught the jade box that the tribesman tossed back, stored it in his Thousand Jun Ring, and continued, “I happen to know a little about Six-Petal Butterfly Violets. When this spiritual flower blooms, there won't be only two. How many more Six-Petal Butterfly Violets do you have, Fellow Daoist Wu? I'll take them all, and we can discuss the price. Or, would you be willing to sell me the location where they grow?”</p><p>"So that's what this is about? What kind of pill are you refining that requires so many Six-Petal Butterfly Violets?"</p><p>The tribesman looked at Qin Sang with surprise, pondered for a long while, and then said, "I really only have these two, no more. As for the location of the spiritual herbs, seeing how straightforward you are, I won’t hide it from you, lest you come looking for trouble later. There are indeed a few immature flowers on that island, but it’s not a safe place.  I was lucky to get these two and wouldn’t dare return. Are you sure you want to buy the information, Fellow Daoist?"</p>
