<h1>Chapter 566: Unexpected Events</h1><p>Chapter 566: Unexpected Events</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened.  He saw it.</p><p>Before Huang Tian and the Wuji Sect Master, the same thing was suspended in the air.</p><p>A strange formation composed of countless fragments of the Interminable Blood Mulberry. These fragments weren't as large as the one refined by the Ebony Sword, but the combined number in both formations was considerable.</p><p>At least half of an Interminable Blood Mulberry!</p><p>Once the formation activated, it brutally extracted all the blood-polluting divine light from the fragments, converging it into a blinding beam of blood.</p><p>This process was incredibly fast. The formation completed the absorption in an instant, leaving no time for others to intervene, even if they had seen it.</p><p>This brutal act came at a price. Once the blood-polluting divine light was completely absorbed, the fragments visibly turned pale.</p><p>Even more shockingly, cracks appeared on the fragments, which then shattered one after another.</p><p>Their essence was destroyed, turning them into ordinary wood.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, all the Interminable Blood Mulberry fragments were destroyed.</p><p>This was fishing the pond dry!</p><p>This was squandering precious resources!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were bloodshot, his heart filled with rage. This scene broke his heart.</p><p>If he'd had those Interminable Blood Mulberry fragments, even if he couldn't upgrade the Ebony Sword to a top-tier magical artifact, it would definitely become a high-grade one!</p><p>He wouldn't have to worry about improving the Ebony Sword anymore!</p><p>But no one cared about Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>The moment the blood light appeared, Zhenyi Daoist immediately understood the meaning behind the Red-haired Ancestor's words; everyone else realized something was wrong with those two.</p><p>Ahead, the Abyss of Sin loomed menacingly.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master and Huang Tian had been bought off by the Abyss of Sin!</p><p>The Little North Star Yuan Array could only withstand a portion of the Immortal Array's divine wind's impact. The Yuan Ying cultivators had to deploy their magical artifacts for additional protection.</p><p>Since they had to protect their disciples, they mostly used their strongest artifacts – primarily their lifebound ones – for safety.</p><p>If they released the blood-polluting divine light, their artifacts would be polluted.  The significant loss of power would be the least of their worries; they wouldn't have time to deploy other artifacts.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin probably wouldn't give them a chance to counterattack.</p><p>The Little North Star Yuan Array wasn't designed for combat.  Without their artifacts, surrounded by the omnipresent Void Wind, escape would be impossible; their only option would be to surrender to death.</p><p>If the high-level cultivators of the two domains were completely annihilated, the Abyss of Sin could easily control the three domains without effort.</p><p>Such a vicious scheme!</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance's Yuan Ying cultivators were terrified, but Huang Tian and the Wuji Sect Master had maniacal grins on their faces.</p><p>"Explode!"</p><p>They had already prepared an escape route.  Shouting, they were about to detonate the blood orb.</p><p>However, at that instant, the Wuji Sect Master's smile froze.  His eyes reflected countless magical artifacts, and his face was filled with terror.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master never expected that after Chongyi Daoist passed the message to the Red-haired Ancestor, they had already been anticipating his actions.</p><p>They initially thought he was colluding with the Tianxing Alliance.  They didn't expect him to be bought by the Abyss of Sin and to act during the Immortal Array's attack.</p><p>Even so, their reaction was much faster than the Tianxing Alliance's.</p><p>In an instant, the Wuji Sect Master was engulfed by a full-powered attack from various magical artifacts.</p><p>With so many Yuan Ying cultivators attacking simultaneously, amidst a kaleidoscope of light, the Wuji Sect Master was almost defenseless. His lifebound spiritual sword was shattered in an instant.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Amidst a deafening roar, the Wuji Sect Master and several Golden Core cultivators under his protection were reduced to dust.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master had only brought one disciple whose lifespan was nearing its end; the others were affiliated with the Wuji Sect or independent cultivators, clearly expendable.</p><p>Now, they were all turned to dust along with him.</p><p>Before the attacks dissipated, a damaged Yuan Ying jumped out from a gap. He looked like a smaller version of the Wuji Sect Master, his face full of panic.</p><p>Surrounded by so many Yuan Ying cultivators, he had no chance to escape.  As soon as he appeared, Dongyang Bo's long-prepared sword light pierced him, killing him instantly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Wuji Sect Master was dead.</p><p>Unfortunately, although they killed the Wuji Sect Master, they failed to prevent the blood-polluting divine light from erupting.</p><p>The method was too unexpected; no one had anticipated the Abyss of Sin would use the Interminable Blood Mulberry against them.</p><p>Luckily, they had already been anticipating the Wuji Sect Master's actions, so their response was swift.  They launched a lightning-fast strike, instantly killing Leng Yuntian, while hurriedly maneuvering their artifacts to dodge, buying themselves precious time.</p><p>However, the few people around the Wuji Sect Master weren't so fortunate.</p><p>Leng Yuntian was the first to suffer.</p><p>He was closest to the Wujimen master and also had to focus on maintaining the Xiaoběichén Star Yuan Formation.</p><p>Above his head floated a dark, black iron tower.</p><p>The Xuan Tower was nine stories high, with a gourd-shaped object carved on the top, emitting a faint golden light. Each of its eight sides on each level had a window, and there was a door on the lowest level, all of which were closed.</p><p>The characters "Five-Element Tower" were inscribed on the tower's body.</p><p>The Xuan Tower itself was only palm-sized, emitting a faint black light that enveloped Leng Yuntian and his disciples. It seemed unremarkable, inconspicuous.</p><p>However, when pursuing the Wujimen master, the Xuan Tower projected a towering shadow, shining brilliantly.</p><p>It easily destroyed the Wujimen master's natal spirit sword, leaving him no chance to breathe. The tower's shadow played a significant role.</p><p>Sadly, even the powerful Xuan Tower couldn't escape being engulfed by the Blood-Soiled Divine Light.</p><p>The Blood-Soiled Divine Light was incredibly intense, like a basin of blood being splashed out.</p><p>Once the Xuan Tower was engulfed, the black light dissipated instantly, and the golden light from the gourd on top and the black light from the tower body vanished. The once inconspicuous tower became pitch-black, completely devoid of any magical aura. It tilted sharply and fell from Leng Yuntian's head.</p><p>Leng Yuntian would likely need months to restore the treasure.</p><p>"My Five-Element Tower!"</p><p>Clutching the Five-Element Tower, Leng Yuntian tried to activate it, only to feel the treasure's immense stagnation. It was unusable in the Purple Micro Palace, causing him to cry out in anguish.</p><p>Suffering a similar fate was Bing Han, the ancestral master of the Xuling Sect. Her originally magical garment was reduced to coarse burlap after being defiled.</p><p>Bing Han shook her head. Although heartbroken, she wasn't as distraught as Leng Yuntian.</p><p>Besides them, one cultivator was unlucky.  Others managed to escape with their treasures, albeit somewhat tainted, the damage being manageable.</p><p>Chen Yan dashed in front of Qin Sang and the others, sacrificing a treasure to protect them; otherwise, the Five Elements Beast Seal would have also suffered.</p><p>The Blood-Soiled Divine Light erupted quickly and dissipated just as fast.</p><p>Overall, the Xiaohan Domain's overall strength suffered minimal losses.</p><p>However, the Tianxing Alliance wasn't so fortunate. Their delayed response not only allowed Huang Tian to detonate the Blood-Soiled Divine Light but also allowed him to successfully break through and escape.</p><p>Their treasures were all more or less affected by the Blood-Soiled Divine Light.</p>
