<h1>Chapter 1360: Sermon from the Immortal Platform</h1><p>Qin Sang sat high upon the Immortal Platform.</p><p>The disciples put away their Beast King Banners and silently stood on either side.</p><p>The grand ceremony was nearing its end.</p><p>However, the expectant expressions on the faces of the cultivators below the mountain grew increasingly intense.</p><p>According to custom, the founder of a sect would open an altar to preach the Dharma as a return gift on the day of the grand ceremony.</p><p>Unfortunately, such opportunities were rare.</p><p>Those qualified and capable of founding a sect, and daring enough to hold a grand ceremony, widely inviting guests, were few and far between.</p><p>For rogue cultivators, the chance to hear a Golden Core Perfected Person preach was an enviable stroke of luck.</p><p>Even disciples of sects did not easily encounter a Nascent Soul Ancestor opening an altar to preach.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang no longer possessed a sword intent that revealed its sharpness; his aura was restrained, as if he were an ordinary person.</p><p>He nodded slightly and spoke, his voice not loud, but able to clearly reach everyoneâ€™s ears, even the cultivators standing on the outermost edge of the mountain.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists have not spared the effort to come and witness the ceremony. Qin (This Humble One) thanks you all. I have nothing to repay you with, except for a few insights into cultivation, which I would like to discuss with everyone."</p><p>When he said the last sentence, Qin Sang's gaze fell upon the Nascent Souls on the Immortal Platform.</p><p>As soon as these words came out, all ten thousand cultivators below the mountain looked solemn and sat upright in an orderly manner.</p><p>In an instant, the vast Azure Sheep Temple (Azure Ram Temple) was silent, with only the gentle breeze blowing.</p><p>On the Immortal Platform, the Nascent Souls also sat up straight, taking Qin Sang very seriously.</p><p>But to their surprise, Qin Sang actually started from the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>Fortunately, the Nascent Souls were not impatient, listening patiently to the Dao, waiting for the subsequent content.</p><p>The cultivators below the mountain, especially the rogue cultivators, were overjoyed, not expecting the Azure Sheep Temple Master to be so generous.</p><p>Qin Sang's sermon was concise and to the point, outlining the essentials, only speaking of the key points. How much they could comprehend depended entirely on the listener's talent.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly finished the content of the Qi Refining stage and began to talk about Foundation Establishment.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang didn't have any profound insights into Foundation Establishment. He had forcibly improved with the spiritual medicine bestowed by Dongyang Bo (Count Dongyang).</p><p>But with his current realm, looking back at Foundation Establishment was effortless, and he could still offer unique insights.</p><p>It was different when it came to the Golden Core stage.</p><p>Perhaps, it would be difficult to find anyone in the world of cultivation whose Golden Core formation process was more tortuous and unforgettable than his.</p><p>The Golden Core secretly conforms to the Dao of Yin and Yang; those who understand it find it easy, those who don't find it difficult. Without someone to guide them, they wouldn't understand it even until death.</p><p>Those who had gained some understanding finally realized what kind of opportunity they had encountered today. Overjoyed, and filled with gratitude, they didn't care about the gazes around them and kowtowed to the ethereal figure on the Immortal Platform.</p><p>As Qin Sang's sermon continued, more and more people knelt on the ground.</p><p>Li Yufu (Li Jade Axe) and others, who were serving on the left and right sides of the Immortal Platform, stared intently at the foot of the mountain, especially paying attention to those rogue cultivators, busily recording something.</p><p>The Dharma cannot be easily transmitted. After the Golden Core stage, Qin Sang spoke very briefly.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had spent almost all of his Golden Core stage in the Canglang Sea, and the inheritance of the Canglang Sea was different from that of the Northern Chen Domain, so some of the content was very novel to the cultivators of the Northern Chen Domain.</p><p>In particular, Qin Sang had also absorbed a portion of the inheritance from the Demon and Witch clans.</p><p>Some perspectives had never even been considered by Nascent Souls and Transforming Great Demons.</p><p>The Nascent Souls listened intently, not entirely out of consideration for Qin Sang's reputation, but because they were genuinely listening attentively and thinking carefully.</p><p>Si Di (Si Barbarian) and Yao Jing (Yao Serenity) exchanged a glance in secret, extremely surprised, because they too had received some inspiration.</p><p>The Northern Chen Domain didn't have similar inheritances. Could it be that Qin Sang obtained them from some ancient secret realm?</p><p>If all of this was comprehended by Qin Sang out of thin air, this person was truly an unparalleled genius!</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't explain anything, letting them speculate.</p><p>Gradually, subtle changes appeared in the expressions of the Nascent Souls, some pondering, some frowning.</p><p>Because Qin Sang always stopped short of the full explanation, as if there was a door that could be opened with effort, and behind the door there should be a wider and more enchanting world. They didn't know if Qin Sang had failed to comprehend it, or was deliberately keeping them in suspense, making them itch in their hearts.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators below the mountain were even more so, scratching their heads and cheeks, looking anxious, looking around, trying to find like-minded people to exchange insights with.</p><p>But they couldn't blame Qin Sang for anything; the more specific content must be the true inheritance of the sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had already been very benevolent in pointing out the existence of this door to them.</p><p>The Nascent Souls suppressed their thoughts, looking at the Qin Sang who was speaking eloquently, their expressions becoming more serious, because Qin Sang was about to talk about the Nascent Soul stage, and there would definitely be unique insights!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang stopped abruptly here!</p><p>He had only formed his Nascent Soul for less than a hundred years, and he hadn't even understood it himself. It was really not appropriate to show off in front of experts, and there were not a few mid-stage Nascent Soul experts on the Immortal Platform.</p><p>But the shallow content from just now was not enough, and stopping the sermon now would definitely become a laughing stock.</p><p>Qin Sang simply concealed his shortcomings, changed the subject, and began to talk about the Sword Dao!</p><p>In the Sword Dao, Qin Sang had enough confidence!</p><p>Both the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* and the *Azure Bamboo Sword Scripture* were extremely profound.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to mainly talk about the *Azure Bamboo Sword Scripture*.</p><p>The *Azure Bamboo Sword Scripture* was created by Qingzhu (Azure Bamboo) based on the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*. Qin Sang took it out from time to time, comprehending the true meaning of the Sword Scripture, which was also of great benefit to his own cultivation.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng (Shangguan Sharp Edge) had long known the content of Qin Sang's sermon and immediately transmitted his voice to the sword cultivator disciples, telling them to eliminate all distracting thoughts and listen to the sermon.</p><p>After a brief disappointment, the Nascent Souls also showed interested expressions after hearing such a profound Sword Dao.</p><p>As for the cultivators below the mountain, few could understand it, but they were all trying hard to remember every word of Qin Sang's.</p><p>In the vast Azure Sheep Temple, only Qin Sang's voice echoed.</p><p>The sky was clear and the air was fresh, with a gentle and pleasant breeze.</p><p>The cultivators were immersed in the mysterious and ethereal Immortal Dao and Sword Dao, forgetting about time.</p><p>It wasn't until they heard the four words 'to this point' that they suddenly woke up, but were still intoxicated in the atmosphere just now, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang's voice seemed to still linger in their ears.</p><p>Some people even found that their extremely stubborn bottleneck had actually loosened slightly!</p><p>"Thank you, Temple Master Qin, for the grace of preaching the Dao!"</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>The cultivators below the mountain suddenly knelt down in large numbers, followed by loud shouts.</p><p>The sound waves were like overwhelming mountains and seas, echoing in the mountains for a long time!</p><p>On the Immortal Platform.</p><p>The Nascent Souls got up and thanked Qin Sang with cupped hands. They had also gained a lot today.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it calmly and waved his sleeves.</p><p>The clouds gathered and obscured the Immortal Platform.</p><p>The grand ceremony ended!</p><p>The cultivators below the mountain were still not satisfied, unwilling to disperse for a long time.</p><p>At this time, Li Yufu and others hurriedly went down the mountain, acting separately.</p><p>During Qin Sang's sermon, those who could immediately have an epiphany must be people with excellent talent. Sect disciples were fine, but rogue cultivators were all outstanding and should not be missed.</p><p>The Azure Sheep Temple was newly established, and it was time to widely recruit disciples.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang did not yet have the ability to teach all classes, and would not blindly accept disciples. He had already formulated several standards.</p><p>Some people said goodbye, some stayed.</p><p>The Azure Sheep Temple gradually returned to calm. The disciples in the temple looked at each other, their faces full of joy. Finally, with reverence, they looked up at the sword character on the main peak -- Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Leaving aside the trivial matters at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>On the Immortal Platform, the Nascent Souls took Qin Sang's sermon as a starting point to discuss the mysteries of the Dao.</p>
