Chapter 1845: The Primordial Embryo


Remaining within his secluded abode, sealed away from the outside world, might allow Qin Sang to weather this storm.  However, he had to consider the possibility of the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom clashing within the Ritual坛, destabilizing its structure, throwing the illusory landscapes into chaos, and potentially bringing about utter destruction.  Could his cave dwelling withstand such an event?

Finding another cave wasn't difficult; relocating the Flower Spirit was.

Gazing at the flower field below, Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh. The Flower Spirit was delicate, and suitable flower fields were rare.

Moreover, moving the Flower Spirit would inevitably damage its vital essence. Even with minimal damage and immediate relocation to a new flower field, it would take over a century for the spirit to recover.  A slight misstep could sever the Flower Spirit's life veins, causing it to wither instantly.

Before its recovery, the Flower Spirit couldn't produce Flower Dew, and the remaining pulp of the poisonous fruit was far from sufficient to sustain his cultivation to the peak of Nascent Soul.

His cultivation would be affected; he couldn't afford to be careless.

Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, sweeping his eyes across the entire flower field space. Divine light flickered, revealing the grand formation in its entirety.

After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, channeling his True Essence and weaving hand seals. Transparent Dharma Seals materialized before him, flickering as they flew towards the various nodes of the grand formation.

As he continued to cast the seals, even with Qin Sang's cultivation level, his breathing grew rapid, the energy expenditure immense.

With the sudden turn of events, Qin Sang could only do this, enhancing the formation's power as much as possible, hoping it would protect the flower field when the upheaval came.

Should the formation fail to withstand the storm, Qin Sang would have no choice but to relocate the Flower Spirit and his cave dwelling.

After a period of intense effort, no visible change occurred, yet within the space, a noticeable tightening of the flow of vital energy could be felt.

Having completed this, Qin Sang stood, his mind stirring as he recalled another matter that required preparation.

As the saying goes, "The tree desires stillness, but the wind will not cease."

He wished to remain untouched by the turmoil, but he couldn't guarantee that disaster wouldn't come knocking. The Ritual坛 now teemed with powerful cultivators. The other two factions held numerical superiority; he, as a third party, was the weakest.

If he were to be dragged into the conflict, explanations would be futile, escape impossible.  Only battle would remain.

His escape techniques were unmatched, but they were only for fleeing, not enough on their own.

Qin Sang thought of another illusory landscape, the jungle realm that had aided him in slaying Marquis Li.  There, Wood Spirit energy was boundless. Within the jungle, relying on his Wood Spirit Body, he was virtually invincible.

Over the years, Qin Sang had discovered several illusory landscapes within the Ritual坛 containing Wood Spirit energy, but none compared to this place.

No matter how powerful the secluded experts of the Dao Court and the Ghostfang Kingdom were, they couldn't instantly kill him. As long as the fight became a stalemate, Qin Sang feared no one.

With this in mind, Qin Sang once again left the flower field space.

He had long since established a path between his cave and the jungle, traversing numerous illusory landscapes to quickly reach the jungle realm.

Entering the jungle, the refreshing Wood Spirit energy washed over him, and Qin Sang felt instantly invigorated.

The scars left by the previous battle had vanished. Trees destroyed in the fighting had regrown, presenting a scene of lush vitality.

If not for its distance from the flower field, inconvenient for collecting Flower Dew, Qin Sang would have considered establishing his cave dwelling here.

For him, the jungle realm was undoubtedly the ideal battlefield, requiring no further preparation.  Given the suddenness of events, Qin Sang only made a few simple arrangements.

His gaze swept across the jungle, and Qin Sang nodded silently, not lingering for long before setting off for other locations.

Next, Qin Sang visited several illusory landscapes, each carefully chosen as a potential battlefield, all rich in Wood Spirit energy.

As he worked, Qin Sang occasionally looked up towards the depths of the Ritual坛.

By now, the experts of both sides must have delved deep into the Ritual坛. Within, an unsettling calm prevailed.  Whenever Qin Sang thought of the armies outside, a sense of oppression lingered, impossible to shake off.

Having done all he could, he left the matter to fate.

Since his cultivation had recovered, Qin Sang had rarely felt so powerless. Sighing inwardly, he departed the last chosen illusory landscape and returned to his cave.

Halfway there, Qin Sang seemed to sense something, abruptly turning around. His eyes instantly transformed into golden pupils.

Golden light!

A familiar scene replayed.

Qin Sang stared intently at the depths of the Ritual坛 as golden light surged skyward, rushing forth like a bursting dam, flooding over one illusory landscape after another. Qin Sang's entire body was bathed in gold, like a gilded statue.

The golden light showed no sign of abating, flowing past Qin Sang and continuing to spread.

In the blink of an eye, the entire Ritual坛 seemed to be awash in a golden ocean.

The golden light’s appearance was too sudden, originating from the depths of the Ritual坛. By the time Qin Sang noticed it, he could no longer pinpoint its source, only roughly estimate its location.

"The source seems different from last time..."

Qin Sang vividly remembered the previous eruption of golden light.  This thought flashed through his mind. Not daring to hesitate, he immediately summoned his escape light and flew towards his cave.

As he flew, Qin Sang remained tense. His strength was far greater than before, but the Ritual坛 held countless beings capable of ending his life.

Those seemingly tranquil illusory landscapes might only be temporarily dormant. Once stimulated by the golden light, they could instantly transform into death traps.

The golden light's eruption was instantaneous, and signs of its recession soon appeared, though at a far slower pace than its outburst.

Qin Sang maintained his speed.  As he flew, he gradually noticed a difference.

This eruption of golden light, though no less grand in scale than the last, had a far lesser impact on the illusory landscapes.

He recalled the past, with countless landscapes in turmoil, dangers lurking everywhere.

Now, most of the landscapes remained unchanged. Only those already somewhat unstable showed slight ripples, quickly calming as the golden light receded.

What the difference between the two golden light eruptions signified, Qin Sang didn't know. Carrying this question, he safely returned to the flower field.


Qin Sang stood at the edge of the flower field, carefully observing the Flower Spirit, then entered his aperture to check on the poisonous fruit.

The poisonous fruit was noticeably shriveled, having been drained of much of its pulp.  It appeared unaffected by the golden light.


Qin Sang exited his aperture and sat cross-legged directly outside the poisonous cavity. If he detected any instability in the formation's foundation, he would destroy the aperture formation without hesitation to retrieve the poisonous fruit first.


With the situation uncertain, Qin Sang had no mind for cultivation.  Staring out at the flower field, he mentally reviewed his divine abilities and treasures.


After a while,


Five-colored divine light suddenly appeared before Qin Sang, the Five Elements Crown slowly rotating within.


Since acquiring this treasure, Qin Sang had continuously pondered its workings, confirming his initial idea was feasible: to guide the demonic spirit's consumption himself and gradually gain its recognition.


The process of consumption was incredibly slow, and achieving the status of a Postnatal Spirit Treasure remained a distant prospect. Qin Sang held no expectations for now, and so his thoughts turned elsewhere.


Before the demonic spirit's consumption was complete, could he wield this treasure in combat?


After some experimentation, Qin Sang discovered that his disguised self was gradually gaining the demonic spirit's trust.  As long as he was sufficiently cautious and avoided startling the demonic spirit, it might be achievable.


The Five Elements Crown birthing a humanoid demonic spirit, though not of righteous origin, was extremely rare.  The Cloud Roaming Sword, also a Spirit Treasure, was somewhat less potent.


Qin Sang rubbed his chin, gazing intently at the Five Elements Crown, lost in thought.


…


In the depths of the Ritual坛,


Wan Zhenren and his group were cautiously navigating the illusory landscapes.


When the golden light erupted, it was visible throughout the entire Ritual坛. All cultivators and demon cultivators who had entered stopped, gazing at the source of the golden light, their expressions varied.


Wan Zhenren and his companions were no exception.


They needed no words, their coordination seamless. The instant the anomaly appeared, they shifted their formation, on guard against their surroundings.


Wan Zhenren and the old Daoist continued to stare at the source of the golden light until it faded.


Having personally experienced the previous golden light eruption, Wan Zhenren quickly perceived the difference this time.  He immediately led the True Masters on a circuit of the surrounding illusory landscapes, confirming his suspicions. He transmitted his voice, "Senior Uncle, this golden light's power is less than the last time.  Could it be a deception?"


Just as he spoke, Wan Zhenren saw the old Daoist holding a jade talisman, his eyes closed, seemingly sensing something. He quickly fell silent.


Without specific instructions, Wan Zhenren ordered the group to continue their search instead of approaching the source of the golden light.


After the time it takes to brew tea, the old Daoist slowly opened his eyes and calmly said, "There's no need to concern ourselves with it for now. Such phenomena are within expectations.  It doesn't confirm the Divine Court's location is truly there.  Nearby comrades will go investigate. It could also be a demonic ploy. We have similar preparations to confuse the demons. You'll see in a moment."


Just as the old Daoist predicted, a group of True Masters near the source of the golden light immediately changed direction, converging towards it.


Wan Zhenren acknowledged with a "Yes," but doubt lingered in his heart. If the golden light wasn't a demonic fabrication... could the Divine Court have a concealed, illusory entrance?


That day, the old Daoist had told him about the Divine Court's origins, but hadn't described it in detail, nor instructed him on what to do upon finding it.


Wan Zhenren had no concept of the Divine Court's form, unable to imagine its appearance. Perhaps it was vast and boundless, perhaps hidden within the infinitesimal. He even suspected the Divine Court wasn't a tangible entity.


At this moment, another group of True Masters was gradually approaching the source of the golden light.


This group consisted of five people, three men and two women, all wearing ordinary Daoist robes, their hair tied in high buns.  The leader was a female Daoist, youthful in appearance, looking to be only twenty years old.


The other four varied in age, but all possessed an otherworldly air.


The five True Masters weren't clustered together, maintaining some distance between them, yet their formation projected a sense of seamless unity, quite peculiar.


The young female Daoist was at the forefront, her divine eyes sharp, seemingly able to pierce through the illusory landscapes to see the source of the golden light.


The further they advanced, the more dazzling and intense the golden light became, the True Masters as if wading through a golden sea.


A white mist arose, coalescing above the young female Daoist's head into a white jade hu tablet, hovering above her.


The other four True Masters' expressions were serious, each summoning their protective treasures.


Judging by their divine light and aura, the young female Daoist's white jade hu was of the highest grade, likely a Spirit Treasure.


'Hum!'


The white jade hu trembled slightly. The True Masters immediately stopped as a white streak shot out from the hu, piercing forward against the golden light.


Influenced by the golden light, the scene within the illusory landscape they occupied was chaotic. Wherever the streak passed, the chaos subsided, forming a stable path. The True Masters seized the opportunity, increasing their speed and following the streak.


"Sect Leader Yue, it should be just ahead. Be careful..."


A True Master from behind offered a reminder.


The young female Daoist nodded slightly.  She wasn't from the Dao Court, but the Sect Leader of the Pure Spring Abbey of Moon鴻 Mountain, located in the Middle茂 Region.  She had entered the Ritual坛 on her master's orders, and her master, the other female Daoist, was also present.


The old Sect Leader of Pure Spring Abbey, like the old Daoist, had severed her cultivation and infiltrated the Ritual坛.


The remaining three were also Sect Leaders or Abbey Masters from other Daoist sects and temples.


The Ten Directions Monasteries and the Dao Court were interconnected, their fates intertwined. The struggle for the Divine Court concerned the rise and fall of the Daoist sect, so naturally, they advanced and retreated together.


Though the young female Daoist knew her master was protecting her from behind, she dared not relax her vigilance, lest she fail to react in time and lose face for Pure Spring Abbey.


She pointed her jade finger, and a talismanic image appeared in the void, flashing into the white jade hu.  The treasure's light intensified, splitting into eight illusory hus.


The eight illusory hus positioned themselves in the eight trigram directions, their spiritual light connecting as one, rotating as they detached from the main body and flew forward.


The illusory hus rotated faster and faster, manifesting the image of a Bagua compass in the void. Wherever they passed, the chaos subsided, and the golden light retreated.


The next moment, the True Masters' gazes all focused.


Within the depths of the golden light, amidst the illusory hus, something extraordinary appeared.


This object wasn't directly before them, still separated by illusory landscapes, but the True Masters increased their speed, finally discerning its outline.


The object was the size of an infant, shaped like a chicken egg, suspended in the void, rising and falling as if breathing, like a primordial embryo about to give birth.


In Daoist legends, there were tales of a primordial embryo dividing heaven and earth, giving birth to all things.


This naturally couldn't be the true primordial embryo of heaven and earth, but it was sufficiently wondrous to captivate the True Masters' attention.


The golden light was receding, flowing back towards the embryo.


The embryo's rising and falling accelerated, as if something was about to break free.


The True Masters held their breath, checking the jade talismans in their hands, noticing the talismans' light fluctuating, their alternating brightness and dimness mirroring the embryo's pulsations, resonating with each other.


The jade talismans' reaction wasn't as pronounced as expected, but no one dared to draw conclusions, lest they miss an opportunity.


The True Masters quickly exchanged words. The young female Daoist didn't recall the illusory hus, continuing to clear the path, breaking through the final layer of the illusory landscape.


At the same time, the True Masters became even more vigilant, guarding against demonic ambushes.


They quickly passed through the last illusory landscape, seeing a vast expanse of auspicious clouds ahead.


The embryo floated within the auspicious clouds, having expanded to twice its previous size.


Stepping out of the illusory landscape, the young female Daoist swiftly scanned the area around the embryo, her brows furrowing slightly.


There were no demons nearby!


If demons had discovered the Divine Court, had they already entered?


Just then, her master's voice suddenly transmitted into her ear, "Retreat!"


The young female Daoist, though unsure of the reason, trusted her master implicitly and immediately withdrew the foot she had stepped forward, retreating rapidly.


The other True Masters, needing no prompting, seeing the young female Daoist's actions, quickly retreated as well.


Simultaneously, the power of the illusory hus surged, taking on a sharper edge, like whirling blades, slashing towards the embryo.


Their trajectory aimed directly at the embryo's center.


Just as the embryo was about to be cleaved open, it suddenly burst with a 'bang,' shattering into specks of golden light that scattered in all directions.


The embryo was clearly empty inside.


As the embryo disintegrated, eerie, chilling laughter echoed around the True Masters, drifting and elusive, yet omnipresent.


Their surroundings instantly darkened, murky waves surging, as if they had fallen into a polluted realm.


The True Masters' expressions changed drastically, sensing the shift in the surrounding vital energy. They had unknowingly fallen into a formation!


A soft sigh.


The female Daoist from behind gracefully stepped forward, her jade hand gently sweeping through the air, accompanied by a divine incantation.

"Jade Morning Crown, cloud-clad and rosy-robed.
Five Turbidities swiftly depart, Eight Landscapes illuminate."

A gurgling stream appeared, a clear spring from an unknown source. Wherever it flowed, the sky brightened, and the pollution was washed away.
