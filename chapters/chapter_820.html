<h1>Chapter 812: Angling</h1><p>Qin Sang emerged from behind the trees.  The two men, judging by their robes, were disciples of the Hanhai Sect.  Qin Sang initially thought they were greedy, seeing her as an outsider.  However, their earlier conversation suggested something more complex was afoot.</p><p>The two men jumped, whirling around. Seeing Qin Sang's nonchalant appearance and her lack of flight despite being discovered following them, they suspected a trap.  They scanned their surroundings, finding no one else. The taller cultivator’s face darkened, and he barked, “Who are you? What is your purpose in infiltrating Bamen Island?”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, reaching into the air.  A ripple disturbed the space behind the two men; a barely perceptible shadow was captured and flung back into Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>The two men were instantly terrified. This was their sect's unique, highly covert communication method, and it had been effortlessly exposed.</p><p>"You followed me with malicious intent, and yet you dare to accuse me? I didn't want to make a big fuss, but since you've come to me, don't blame me..."</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.  Before she finished speaking, the two men felt a flash before their eyes.  Horrified, they found themselves paralyzed, realizing the terrifying power of their opponent.  Terror etched their faces; they were speechless.</p><p>Qin Sang then pressed her hand to the head of one of the men. The taller cultivator watched in horror as his companion was soul-searched and killed, a gruesome death that shattered his composure. He was so terrified that he urinated.</p><p>"The Hanhai Sect Master once secretly investigated all cultivators connected to the Linggui Island Master. Shortly after, Linggui Island was attacked…"</p><p>The information gleaned from the soul-search piqued Qin Sang's interest. The Hanhai Sect Master operated with extreme secrecy; only a few core disciples knew, with no outside awareness. Even the Wu Sect Master of the Sanshan Sect was unaware of being investigated.</p><p>After the Linggui Island incident, the Hanhai Sect stopped.  There were seemingly no further actions, and the Wu Sect Master and others were unharmed. But Qin Sang sensed something was amiss.  Whatever orders the Hanhai Sect Master was following, it wasn't for nothing.</p><p>Just because the Wu Sect Master was safe didn't mean others were.  Perhaps their cultivation was too low to be worth targeting.  Elder Qingzhu's teachings spanned over a hundred years.  Among the cultivators who had received his favor, several had reached the Nascent Soul stage and traveled widely. These individuals had long since lost contact; their deaths abroad would have gone unnoticed.</p><p>“The one who manipulated the Hanhai Sect Master is likely the true culprit. Finding the Hanhai Sect Master will reveal the truth.  His cultivation is similar to Lady Liu's; capturing and killing him would be easy.  But the real culprits might still be around.  It's best to lure them out and ambush them! Even if something goes wrong, it'll be easy to escape.”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the taller cultivator.  While the city was controlled by the Hanhai Sect, several other factions existed; united, they were a force to be reckoned with. These two were the Hanhai Sect's managers; they could be useful. The Hanhai Sect Master had ordered them to monitor unfamiliar powerful cultivators, especially Nascent Soul stage cultivators with close ties to the Linggui Island Master, and to immediately report them to the sect.  Qin Sang's low profile had led them to misjudge her.</p><p>An idea struck Qin Sang.  Under the taller cultivator's terrified gaze, she pointed to the corpse and said coldly, "If you don't want to share his fate, you will send a new message…according to my instructions…"</p><p>…</p><p>Hanhai Sect.</p><p>In a wooden hall, a disciple meditated.  A rapid bird’s chirping startled him. Rushing outside, he saw the sect's pet bird carrying a black ‘insect.’  The insect was actually a wisp of black energy, which transformed into a letter upon landing in the disciple's palm.  Seeing the name on the letter, the disciple didn't dare delay, racing to a cave on the mountain behind the hall and presenting the message.</p><p>"Master, it's an urgent message from Brother He."</p><p>Inside the cave, a middle-aged cultivator was meditating.  Disturbed, he frowned, taking the letter and reading it. His face turned red with anger. "Hmph! What are those old fools trying to do?  They dare to disobey openly and meddle in matters they shouldn't. If Luo Island Master hadn't intervened two years ago, I would have eliminated them long ago. How dare they continue to act up to this day!"</p><p>"So they're using the Island Master Luo as a shield? It's time to clip their wings and teach them a lesson!"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator crushed the letter, rising abruptly.  But after his anger subsided, he sat back down after a moment's thought, and said to his disciple below, "However, out of respect for Island Master Luo, we can't just kill them... Go and summon your senior brother from seclusion. Have him lead some men to secretly infiltrate the market town and assist your two senior brothers.  They'll investigate those people's intentions, and I will personally go and confront them."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The disciple hurried away.</p><p>Shortly after, the gates of the Hanhai Sect opened, and several figures flew towards the market town.</p><p>As they left, Qin Sang's figure appeared from a distant mountain peak.  Seeing that only a few Foundation Establishment disciples had been caught, Qin Sang glanced towards the Hanhai Sect, inwardly cursing the man's cowardice. Fortunately, he had known there was only one letter and it wasn't very useful, so he had prepared a backup plan.</p><p>To keep himself out of trouble and avoid being targeted by the enemies of Elder Qingzhu, Qin Sang was willing to go to extra lengths.</p><p>The contents of the letter weren't entirely fabricated.</p><p>While the Hanhai Sect was powerful, it wasn't all-powerful on Ba Men Island. Other factions wouldn't necessarily obey them completely.  Finding some evidence wasn't difficult. The two stewards had already gathered some, though not as serious. Qin Sang embellished it to make it seem like they were planning a rebellion.</p><p>When the Hanhai Sect disciples arrived at the market town and secretly infiltrated the city, they saw the tall cultivator.</p><p>"Brother He, where's Brother Ren? Why are you the only one here?"</p><p>Wei Yu, the Hanhai Sect Master's eldest disciple, couldn't see him. A person was sitting in a corner of the hall.</p><p>Brother He, however, saw him clearly. This person was naturally cowardly and was under Qin Sang's control.  He knew he was betraying his sect but dared not refuse. "Brother Ren… Brother Ren is monitoring the people from Yaohu Mountain.  Only I am here waiting for Master. Senior Brother, why didn't Master come?"</p><p>He performed as rehearsed. His act was passable.</p><p>"Master ordered me to gather evidence first."</p><p>The eldest disciple didn't notice anything amiss with Brother He.  Seeing the evidence Qin Sang had carefully prepared, he believed it without question. He ordered men to guard the market town, to avoid alarming anyone, and personally took the evidence back to the mountain.</p><p>After he left, Qin Sang captured everyone, then silently followed behind.</p><p>This whole scheme took a lot of effort from Qin Sang. Fortunately, after using soul searching, he knew everything about the Hanhai Sect and the market town. He couldn't be fooled by the tall cultivator.</p>
