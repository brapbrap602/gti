Chapter 389: A Long-Awaited Encounter


Wu Shang's notes detailed his desperate attempts, after his transformation into a Flying Night Rakshasa, to undo the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and escape his cursed state.  If someone unaffected by the talisman's power were to achieve such a transformation and then break free, what would happen to their Corpse Pill? Would they… regress in cultivation?

Qin Sang pondered this, finally shaking his head.


…


Qin Sang controlled the living corpse, bowing to 'Wu Shang'. Wu Shang was the second person Qin Sang had met, after the Wandering Cultivator, whose devotion to their path was unwavering and resolute, never giving up.  Ultimately, becoming a Flying Night Rakshasa, losing their sanity, and their spirit eternally bound within a corpse, endlessly wandering the silent ice cave, was a price willingly paid.  


Madness is the price of survival!


A true cultivator indeed.


Coincidentally, both the Wandering Cultivator and Wu Shang had converged here seeking the Nightfall Lily, proving that different paths can lead to the same destination. You may not like such individuals, but you cannot help but respect them.


The living corpse slowly retreated from the side chamber, casting one last glance at 'Wu Shang'.  'Wu Shang' sat cross-legged on the ice, sensing the living corpse's movement, raising their head to meet its gaze.  Only coldness filled their dark pupils before they closed their eyes, returning to stillness.


In the faint blue light, only a solitary figure remained.


The living corpse returned to Qin Sang. Qin Sang opened his corpse puppet bag and stored the living corpse. Its injuries had almost fully healed.  Delivering the Wandering Cultivator would complete the mission, allowing him to leave for the Qingyang Market and await the outcome.


From Wu Shang's notes, Qin Sang learned that a Nightfall Lily, a heavenly treasure capable of purifying the spirit and nurturing the soul, grew in this place.


He only hoped the Wandering Cultivator would obtain this herb and heal their hidden injuries.


Next, Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword, the Ten Directions Yama Banner, and the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman.


He relied on these three treasures to contend with the Flying Night Rakshasa.


The Jiao Dragon Essence was unharmed by the Flying Night Rakshasa, and the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman remained intact.  The ebony sword took a direct hit, its luster slightly dimmed. Qin Sang examined it carefully with his divine sense; there was no damage, merely requiring spiritual nourishment to easily restore it.


The most likely damaged item, having done the most work, was the Ten Directions Yama Banner.  The spectral threads were forcefully torn by the Flying Night Rakshasa, and the main soul was directly shattered by a powerful blow.  Qin Sang hadn’t had time to examine it until now.


Qin Sang unfurled the Ten Directions Yama Banner and, after checking it, breathed a sigh of relief.  The banner was even more potent than he’d imagined. After the battle, the main soul had indeed been weak for a time, but with countless souls within the banner, it had fully recovered after returning to rest within.


A true treasure born from a Nascent Soul-level artifact.


Qin Sang silently praised it before putting everything away. He glanced at the empty ice hall, his figure flashing as he sped towards the exit.


During his flight, Qin Sang wore a thoughtful expression.


Soon, nearing the dark pool where the Flying Horned Dragonfish resided, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, staring ahead with suspicion.


Thunderous roars and piercing cries echoed from ahead.


Deep within the ice plains, the ice layer was thousands of meters thick. No lightning could penetrate.  Only one possibility remained: the lightning power released from the Flying Horned Dragonfish’s horns.


Were they… playing?


Qin Sang frowned, regretting not asking the Wandering Cultivator more about the Flying Horned Dragonfish's habits.  These ancient beasts possessed incredibly powerful innate abilities, and even playful interactions couldn't be treated lightly. Approaching them now could be dangerous.


It would be best to wait until they calmed down before releasing the Drunken Demon Saliva.


The further he went, the deeper Qin Sang's frown became. The commotion from the Flying Horned Dragonfish was far too intense. The surrounding spiritual energy was chaotic, and the ice cave trembled.


Were they fighting other ancient beasts?


Qin Sang's mind raced. The deep pool was bottomless; it was possible that other ancient beasts lived there.


He hadn't anticipated other intruders, but this place was incredibly remote. Reaching this spot required passing through the inner valley's restrictions, avoiding countless dangerous traps, and finally breaking through the illusion.


The Wandering Cultivator had said that no one had been here since their last visit, making it unlikely that they would encounter others so soon after arrival.


With that thought, Qin Sang slowed his pace.


Feijiao, with his keen senses, dared not reveal his spiritual awareness, fearing it would attract unwanted attention. He concealed himself, took out his artifact, and stealthily approached the dark pool.

Rounding a bend, Qin Sang saw the pool at the end of the passage and his expression changed drastically. He had been wrong; someone was there!

Before he could get a clear look, a sudden warning filled him. He stamped his foot, his body flashing as he instantly moved to the other side of the passage.

Almost simultaneously, a blinding bolt of lightning shot from the pool, striking the spot where he had just been standing, blasting a large hole in the incredibly hard ice, shattering it with countless cracks.

Qin Sang stared at the hole, his face grim.  He hadn't expected to be discovered so quickly and forced out of hiding. He had been cautious, constantly using the *Dunling Jue* to conceal his presence. How had they found him?

Unless…the opponent's strength far surpassed his own, rendering the *Dunling Jue* ineffective.

'Boom!'

Without a word, the opponent unleashed another lightning bolt.

Qin Sang knew the power of the lightning and didn't dare to withstand it, hastily dodging.  Just as he began to move, the heart-eating insect Gu on his spiritual body stirred, its fangs snapping at his soul, only to be blocked by his jade Buddha amulet.

Heart-eating insect!
Kuiyin Sect!

The thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind, and he suddenly understood.

Instinctively, using his superb acting skills, he cried out in pain, staggering to the front right, appearing to be barely escaping the heart-eating insect's attack and the lightning bolt.

Next, he heard the opponent let out a surprised sound—a sound that seemed familiar.

He looked up.

Their eyes met.

"Eh? Qin Sang? You're still alive?"

"Yu Hua!"

Seeing the face beneath the wide-brimmed hat, long-dormant memories flooded back. Qin Sang instantly recognized him, gritting his teeth as he spoke the name, his heart filled with shock.

Yu Hua was alive!

It was Yu Hua!

The Yuanzhao Gate traitor, the Foundation Establishment cultivator who had controlled them alongside Zhao Yan within Yuanzhao Gate!

On the night of the Kuiyin Sect's surprise attack on Yuanzhao Gate, the Yuanzhao Gate's Grandmaster had detonated the protective formation and spiritual vein, dying along with high-ranking members of the Kuiyin Sect. Yu Hua, acting as an inside man, had somehow survived.

And now, Yu Hua was no ordinary cultivator who had just broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage decades ago.

His cultivation was astonishingly high, his aura as strong as that of Senior Brother Qi Yuanshou—False Core stage!
