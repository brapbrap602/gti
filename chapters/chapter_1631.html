<h1>Chapter 1622: Blood Sacrifice</h1><p>Above the precipice.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and the others had already crossed the mountain's mid-slope, ascending along a stone path that led directly to the summit. This route was the quickest of all the stone paths, yet the restrictions along the way were numerous. Even with the immense divine abilities of Zhu Wudao's group of four, they felt their minds and spirits weary, forcing them to pause for rest midway.</p><p>They drew ever closer to the precipice's peak, but the scene there remained hidden from view. A swirling crimson mist drifted just below the summit. The mist held its form, dense and unyielding, obstructing their line of sight. Further barriers lay between them and the summit, leaving the source of the crimson mist unclear.</p><p>Combining their powers, the four broke through layer after layer of restrictions, finally arriving beneath the crimson mist.</p><p>They looked up.</p><p>The mist was thick, like a viscous, inseparable liquid. Not only did it block their vision, but when they attempted to utilize divine abilities like Spirit Vision, they were repeatedly thwarted.</p><p>Zhu Wudao concealed the golden light in his eyes, his face contemplative.</p><p>Due to their prior encounter with the Strange-Faced Man, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was somewhat acquainted with Zhu Wudao and stood closest to him, shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>The Swordsman stood to their right, level with them, but maintaining a certain distance.</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained at the rear of the four, rarely offering his opinion, seemingly detached from the group.</p><p>The Swordsman extended a wisp of divine sense into the mist.</p><p>The mist, like a tenacious affliction, spread along his divine sense towards him.</p><p>The Swordsman sensed a chilling yin energy and, not daring to delay, instinctively severed the connection of his divine sense. He turned to Zhu Wudao, voicing his question.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhu, what kind of restriction is this crimson mist?"</p><p>At the beginning of their ascent, the Swordsman and the others had blatantly trailed Zhu Wudao, posturing to share in any fortuitous encounters. Uncertain of Zhu Wudao's intentions, they remained wary of him turning hostile.</p><p>The atmosphere at that time had been tense.</p><p>Throughout the climb, however, Zhu Wudao hadn't shown any anger, seemingly unconcerned about others partaking in the spoils. They had cooperated closely to unravel layer upon layer of restrictions, gradually easing the tension and resuming communication.</p><p>Thus, upon encountering this obstacle, the Swordsman didn't hesitate to seek Zhu Wudao's insight.</p><p>Gazing at the mist, Zhu Wudao mused, "If I'm not mistaken, we should now be standing on the Path of Heart Refinement for the disciples of the Formless Immortal Sect."</p><p>"Path of Heart Refinement?"</p><p>The Swordsman echoed these words, lost in thought.</p><p>The name itself hinted at the purpose of this path, yet they hadn't felt anything unusual during their ascent.</p><p>Moreover, if it truly was a Path of Heart Refinement prepared for the Formless Immortal Sect's disciples, it implied that this precipice wasn't a forbidden area and was accessible to all.</p><p>Could it be that the Formless Immortal Sect had intentionally placed the teleportation formation here to mislead others?</p><p>The Swordsman was convinced that Zhu Wudao's ascent of the precipice wasn't aimless. The Heavenly Harmony Hall teleportation formation had to be at the summit.</p><p>"For the Path of Heart Refinement to have become like this, this final restriction must also be at its end…"</p><p>Zhu Wudao shook his head with a hint of lament. Without any defensive measures, he stepped into the crimson mist.</p><p>Seeing this, the other three followed suit.</p><p>The moment they entered, the crimson mist reacted, churning violently and converging towards them, a peculiar fluctuation spreading outwards.</p><p>In the next instant, a long howl erupted from within the mist.</p><p>The howl resonated like thunder, continuous and unending.</p><p>A large hole suddenly appeared in the center of the mist, the brilliance of magical treasures and divine abilities flickering intermittently.</p><p>The howl carried an invisible wave, which, aided by other magical treasures, pierced through the mist and rapidly spread outwards, driving away the remaining crimson mist until it was completely dispelled!</p><p>Zhu Wudao closed his mouth, the howling abruptly ceasing.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master and the other two also ceased their techniques, eagerly leaping onto the summit of the precipice.</p><p>Breaking through the final barrier, the summit of the precipice was revealed before their eyes.</p><p>Then they were dumbfounded.</p><p>The summit was completely empty!</p><p>It was remarkably flat, clearly artificially created, yet it held none of the anticipated teleportation formations, not even a single pavilion!</p><p>The Swordsman's gaze darkened. "Fellow Daoist Zhu, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p>"Don't be anxious, Fellow Daoist," Zhu Wudao replied confidently. "The Immortal Hall is the Formless Immortal Sect's greatest secret. How could they leave the teleportation formation openly displayed? After the demonic tribulation, the Formless Immortal Sect completely sealed the teleportation formation. We still need to exert some effort to activate it."</p><p>He truly was after the teleportation formation!</p><p>The Swordsman's expression softened slightly.</p><p>"Can the teleportation formation directly transport us into the Immortal Hall?" Mo Xingdao couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Stepping forward, Zhu Wudao said, "The Formless Immortal Sect's dominance over the Middle Continent relied on this teleportation formation to the Heavenly Harmony Hall, firmly controlling the Immortal Hall. If not for the demonic tribulation, perhaps no one would have been able to challenge the Formless Immortal Sect's authority to this day."</p><p>Hearing this, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master expressed some unease. "Are you certain the teleportation formation is intact?"</p><p>"Although the Immortal Hall was later occupied by the Daoist and Buddhist sects, the location of the teleportation formation within the Immortal Hall is extremely secretive. It's virtually impossible to find it from the other side, unless the Formless Immortal Sect destroyed it themselves…"</p><p>As he spoke, Zhu Wudao walked to the center of the summit, surveying his surroundings.</p><p>Then, with a flick of his finger, he shot out a streak of light.</p><p>Within the streak of light seemed to be a crystalline stele, but before the others could get a clear look, it vanished into the ground with a flash.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and the other two couldn't help but glance at Zhu Wudao once more.</p><p>This person knew far too many secrets!</p><p>All being descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect, the others paled in comparison to Zhu Wudao, leading them to suspect that he possessed more than just the Golden Aspect lineage's inheritance.</p><p>This was understandable. The Golden Aspect lineage occupied Quyang Mountain, integrated into the Sky Reaching Tower, and didn't have to live in hiding. Not only was their inheritance completely preserved, but they could also use the Sky Reaching Tower's reputation to gather the Formless Immortal Sect's lost treasures.</p><p>The moment it entered the ground, the crystalline stele split into four. The main body plunged downwards, while three illusory copies shot towards three different directions, reaching the edges of the platform.</p><p>Zhu Wudao turned to face the three, saying, "If you wish to enter the Immortal Hall, lend this old man your strength!"</p><p>The three looked at each other, none dissenting. Following Zhu Wudao's instructions, they landed on top of the three illusory steles, extending their divine senses into the ground to sense the location of the main stele.</p><p>Zhu Wudao stamped his foot heavily, soaring to a height of ten feet, looking down as he surveyed the scene. His fingers moved like a wheel, swiftly completing an incredibly complex hand seal, striking the stele below.</p><p>A muffled sound emanated from within the precipice, followed by ten thousand rays of brilliant light bursting forth from the ground.</p><p>These rays of light didn't shoot into the sky but, guided by some unseen force, converged at the locations of the four steles, transforming into four gigantic light steles that stood tall upon the precipice!</p><p>The four figures flashed and landed on top of the light steles, sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Led by Zhu Wudao, they performed the same secret technique.</p><p>Soon, another transformation occurred. The three outer light steles emitted thick beams of light, pouring into the central light stele beneath Zhu Wudao, while their own light gradually dimmed.</p><p>Infused with the power of the strange treasure and the four cultivators, this central light stele grew increasingly solid, almost tangible.</p><p>A bright halo rippled outwards in all directions, light waves like water, spreading across the entire summit.</p><p>An astonishing scene unfolded.</p><p>Under the illumination of the light, a faint shimmer appeared on the previously empty platform, revealing the illusory form of a magnificent ancient hall.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's position was precisely in front of the ancient hall's main gate!</p><p>As the light waves rippled, the illusory ancient hall also swayed, clearly not a physical structure.</p><p>The three others revealed expressions of astonishment, sending their divine senses to sweep the area, but the feedback remained empty!</p><p>They quickly realized that with Zhu Wudao's efforts, the illusory ancient hall became clearer and clearer, being pulled from illusion into reality.</p><p>A peculiar restriction, a dreamlike spectacle, captivated their attention.</p><p>The faint shimmer and the light waves converged.</p><p>The illusory ancient hall became even more distinct, its details now visible.</p><p>The exterior of the ancient hall lacked ornamentation. Its doors were tightly closed, seemingly without any other halls within. The vast space could easily accommodate a teleportation formation!</p><p>As the illusory ancient hall reached a state of half-solidity, half-illusion, Zhu Wudao's breathing grew rapid.</p><p>At that moment, the ancient hall suddenly trembled violently. Everyone's expressions changed as they watched a corner of the hall's eaves crumble.</p><p>Undeterred, Zhu Wudao increased his pace.</p><p>The faint shimmer fluctuated wildly, the illusory ancient hall trembling with increasing frequency and intensity, causing significant damage to its structure.</p><p>The eaves continued to break apart.</p><p>Cracks appeared on the walls and pillars.</p><p>Finally, a damaged ancient hall materialized before them, thankfully not yet collapsed.</p><p>Zhu Wudao retrieved the crystalline stele, flashing to the front of the hall's doors. Just as he was about to push them open, he felt a scorching sensation on his right arm.</p><p>Hidden within his sleeve was a strange wooden carving, similar in form to the sculptures worshipped by the Gu God Sect's followers, except for the absence of the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>The wooden carving was deathly pale.</p><p>But at this moment, it was suddenly suffused with a bloody hue.</p><p>Zhu Wudao paused imperceptibly, then pushed open the ancient hall's doors!</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>In the heartland of the two Southern Barbarian provinces.</p><p>After years of development, the Gu God Sect's influence had spread far and wide.</p><p>At this very moment, all followers of the Gu God Sect received a divine oracle, gathering before their deity's statues, consuming immortal medicine, creating scenes of madness and demonic chaos everywhere.</p><p>The immortal medicine sent them into a euphoric state.</p><p>The divine oracle brought hope of life to all followers, proclaiming that the Immortal Palace would open this day, guiding the pious believers into the Vacuum Immortal Paradise to enjoy eternal bliss!</p><p>A scene even more horrifying than the demonic tribulation unfolded.</p><p>They praised their god, and as their last vestiges of clarity faded, they began to slaughter each other before the statues.</p><p>Corpses littered the ground, rivers of blood flowed!</p><p>Countless villages were utterly annihilated, transformed into infernal ghost realms.</p><p>The deity's statues sat amidst mountains of corpses and seas of blood, their crude faces stained crimson, becoming grotesquely eerie.</p><p>The blood on the ground flowed silently towards the statues, absorbed by them along with the souls of the dead.</p><p>Even in the cultivation world, where mortals were viewed as ants, this was a blood sacrifice unprecedented in scale and brutality, one that would surely shake the world if it became known!</p><p>The night moon seemed to be veiled in a bloody gauze.</p><p>Under the moonlight, figures clad in black moved through the silent villages, busily at work. These individuals appeared to belong to a mysterious faction.</p><p>As time passed.</p><p>One after another, the deity statues drank their fill of blood, their malevolent gazes fixed upon the world.</p><p>If someone were to stand at a height of ten thousand feet, overlooking the heartland of the Southern Border, they would see that within the Gu God Sect's territory, the locations of the statues resembled nodes, their energies interconnected, forming an incredibly complex and vast mystical formation!</p><p>At the center of the formation.</p><p>Within a dark stone cave.</p><p>Two figures in black robes sat facing each other, guarding a deity statue.</p><p>The bloodstained statue, bathed in crimson light, transformed the cave into a blood cave, illuminating two sinister and terrifying faces.</p><p>"The formation is complete!"</p><p>The figure to the left of the statue exclaimed, their voice filled with uncontainable excitement. "Lord Emissary must have entered the Formless Immortal Sect by now. The Holy Sovereign will surely reign supreme over the world!"</p><p>Their companion wasn't as optimistic, their expression hesitant. "Legend says the Holy Sovereign was sealed by the Formless Immortal Sect within the Immortal Hall, in the Immortal Hall south of the South Sea. It's so far from here. Can our blood sacrifice here truly help the Holy Sovereign break free from the seal?"</p><p>"Of course it can!"</p><p>The figure on the left raised their head, glaring fiercely at their companion. "The Heavenly Dao, the Earthly Dao, and the Human Dao! The Formless Immortal Sect diverted the Southern Border's earth energy into the Immortal Hall to seal the Holy Sovereign. We use human blood to sacrifice and break the earth energy formation, why wouldn't it work? We must also thank the Daoist and Buddhist sects for sweeping away the Formless Immortal Sect, leaving the nodes unguarded and giving us this opportunity! Lord Emissary disguised himself as a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, rallying heroes and confusing all sides. Even if we're exposed, we can escape unscathed and plan again. Multiple gains with one move, truly a brilliant strategy!"</p><p>"We both cultivated the Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance. It's not an exaggeration to call ourselves descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect."</p><p>The companion gave a self-deprecating laugh.</p><p>"A temporary measure, nothing more!"</p><p>The figure on the left snorted, their face filled with disdain. "The Holy Sovereign possesses profound methods. We both contributed to his rescue, though not as much as Lord Emissary. Even a small reward from him can transform us completely. How can it compare to a few mere divine abilities?"</p><p>As the two conversed.</p><p>The deity statue transformed completely into a blood-red human figure, then suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p>Seeing the malevolent gaze of those eyes, the figure on the left felt a tremor in their heart, instinctively taking a few steps back.</p><p>The statue gazed northwards, establishing a connection with some unknown entity.</p><p>…</p><p>Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang moved stealthily, arriving silently at the foot of the precipice.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and the others had reached the summit, their activities unclear.</p><p>They had cleared the restrictions of a stone path, presumably believing that no uninvited guests would enter the Formless Immortal Sect in a short time, and hadn't left any obstacles behind.</p><p>This stone path was a clear route.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly ascended, commanding the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to exert its full vision, searching inch by inch along the stone path. Finally, at a stone pavilion halfway up the mountain, he detected something unusual.</p><p>No need to guess, it must be Purple Thunder Patriarch and Yue Lingtian hiding there, waiting for the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect to activate the teleportation formation.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang found a concealed spot and also paused.</p><p>He raised his left hand, palm upwards.</p><p>With a flicker of thought, complex divine markings appeared on his left arm.</p><p>The power of the divine markings converged towards the back of his hand, gradually forming a blood moon pattern.</p><p>This divine marking was left by the Ghost Mother, the Bone Seeking secret technique of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared to activate it now.</p><p>Searching for the skeletal remains of the Witch Clan's Nascent Soul cultivator was also one of his objectives.</p><p>If the blood moon pattern exhibited any unusual changes, it would indicate that the Nascent Soul remains were nearby.</p><p>To be honest, Qin Sang didn't have much faith in the effectiveness of the Bone Seeking secret technique after countless years, especially when searching for the remains of someone he had never met.</p><p>Was the Witch Clan bloodline truly that special?</p><p>However, after the blood moon appeared, Qin Sang changed his mind.</p><p>Within the blood moon was a very distinct aura.</p><p>"Could it be the aura of that Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>Unless one possessed a treasure closely related to the Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator, it would be impossible to extract such an aura.</p><p>The Witch Clan also excelled in blood refinement techniques, their lifeblood insect gu incorporating blood refinement as well. Could it be that the Ghost Mother had truly found a relic refined by a Nascent Soul cultivator's blood?</p><p>She had crossed three great regions, tirelessly searching for over two hundred years, and it seemed her efforts hadn't been in vain.</p>
