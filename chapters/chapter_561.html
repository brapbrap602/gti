Chapter 554: Nascent Soul


Going to them directly was even more impossible.
Unless he could find a way to make Duke Dongyang or Chenyan willingly release him.
Qin Sang put away his thoughts and carefully examined the Black Tortoise Seal.
The beast soul roared, still restless.
He couldn't even tell what spiritual materials the seal was made of. The method of sealing the beast soul was also extremely sophisticated, far beyond Qin Sang's understanding.
Withstanding the impact of the beast soul, Qin Sang probed the seal with his divine sense and finally saw the complete form of the beast soul.
It was actually a true Black Tortoise beast soul, identical to the carving on the seal!
Qin Sang was greatly shocked. Could the beast souls in the other four seals also be real? Where did Duke Dongyang find these divine beasts that only existed in legends?
However, when Qin Sang carefully observed the beast soul, he finally discovered its peculiarity. It was definitely not extracted from a real divine beast.
It was a peculiar ferocious soul, artificially refined through some unknown method, devoid of any intelligence, leaving only pure ferocity. No wonder it was so frenzied.
Qin Sang held the Black Tortoise Seal in his hands and activated the incantation to refine it.
Although the beast soul was unruly, with the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang could complete the refinement within half a month, instead of half a year. It wouldn't delay healing the Night Sky Yaksha.
Che Yutao was cultivating in the cave dwelling deep within the residence. He had to be careful when healing the Night Sky Yaksha.
While subduing the beast soul, Qin Sang also pondered if there was anything he could do with the beast soul seal.
He waited patiently until late at night. There was an auction tonight.
Che Yutao hadn't strictly confined him. Qin Sang stored the beast seal within his body, preparing to take the opportunity to go out and meet Yun Youzi to seek his advice.
Just as Qin Sang reached the door and pushed it open, his expression suddenly changed. He abruptly turned around and saw a figure that had appeared in the room at some point.
It was Granny Jing!
Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief. His face lit up with joy as he hurried forward and bowed, "Greetings, Senior. Did you just arrive at Skull Fortress today?"
He had assumed Granny Jing was still at Jiuyong Pass, secretly investigating the Yuan Mirage Sect and Leng Yuntian.
Granny Jing still leaned on a cane, appearing as an old woman, just like when they first met at the Moon Inquiry Market.
Qin Sang had already seen Granny Jing's true appearance. Seeing her in this guise, he felt an inexplicable strangeness. He wondered why Granny Jing was unwilling to show her true face.
Granny Jing shook her head. "I've been at Skull Fortress for a while. Some trivial matters have kept me from meeting you. Today, I saw Duke Dongyang unexpectedly leave his seclusion, and I learned that you were summoned here. I suspected something might have happened."
"Indeed, something unexpected occurred…"
Seeing Granny Jing, Qin Sang felt instantly relieved. He nodded repeatedly and hurriedly recounted the day's events.
Granny Jing asked Qin Sang to summon the beast seal and held it in her hand to examine it.
After a moment, Granny Jing raised her head and asked, "There are five of these seals in total?"
"That's right," Qin Sang pointed to the adjacent room. "They each possess the Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Black Tortoise seals, which, together with the one in my hand, form the Five Elements Beast Seals."
"Five Elements Beast Seals… Five Elements… Ferocious Souls…"
Granny Jing fell into deep thought.
Suddenly, her eyes lit up. "I see! They're going to *that place*! No wonder they need the Five Elements Beast Seals. Duke Dongyang is resourceful; he actually thought of this method! Although it's a bit forced, with the two of them working together, they might actually be able to forge a new path."
Saying this, Granny Jing tossed the seal back to Qin Sang. "Che didn't lie to you. You only need to use the seals to break the restriction. There's no danger. Besides, with two Nascent Soul cultivators protecting you, what's there to be afraid of?"
"Two?"
Qin Sang was startled, then realized Granny Jing was referring to Chenyan. He asked in surprise, "Miss Chenyan truly succeeded in forming her Nascent Soul? Why hasn't there been any news?"
Granny Jing said, "You'll have to ask your Patriarch about that. Over a decade ago, when that woman was undergoing her Nascent Soul tribulation, she chose a desolate and remote location. Duke Dongyang also spent a fortune on spiritual materials to set up a concealing formation. If I hadn't been near your sect at the time and accidentally noticed something, no one would know that Mount Shaohua now has two Nascent Soul cultivators! If this news were to spread, the various sects in the Xiaohan Region would be restless. However…"
Granny Jing's tone shifted, and she said doubtfully, "After I discovered this, I investigated secretly, but I couldn't find any information about that woman's background. 'Chenyan' is likely an alias. She was brought back to Mount Shaohua by Duke Dongyang after the last closure of the Violet Palace. She shouldn't have been very old at the time. The last time the Violet Palace appeared was only a little over two hundred years ago. She's probably less than three hundred years old now. Even with a Heavenly Spiritual Root, it's very rare to break through to Nascent Soul at such a young age. Her origin is definitely not simple."
Granny Jing didn't know about Chenyan's dual cultivation practices.
Only Qin Sang knew that Chenyan's Nascent Soul formation wasn't as easy as it sounded.
This speed still made Qin Sang envious. At three hundred years old, he didn't even know if he could reach the late Gold Core stage, while Chenyan was already a genuine Nascent Soul expert.
He wondered why she was so eager to use邪法 (removed as per localization instruction - evil method) to form her Nascent Soul at such a young age.
Learning these things from Granny Jing calmed Qin Sang down considerably. He had seen enough scheming and backstabbing in the cultivation world. He was most afraid of being used as a pawn and discarded.
However, when Qin Sang inquired about the details, Granny Jing also claimed ignorance. "I only know that place is regarded by many Nascent Soul cultivators as a crucial location within the Violet Palace. I haven't been inside myself. You just need to follow their orders when the time comes. Duke Dongyang has a good reputation in the righteous path; he's not like those ruthless demonic cultivators. What use would there be in deceiving someone with your level of cultivation? Take this…"
Granny Jing tossed a wooden bracelet to Qin Sang and taught him how to use it.
"Before entering the inner hall, just follow them obediently. I've learned that Leng Yuntian will be going to the inner hall. We'll make our move there! Take this bracelet and put it on the moment you enter the inner hall. It can temporarily conceal your mark. If Duke Dongyang finds you, just say you accidentally stumbled into an ancient hall and were trapped by the restrictions inside."
Granny Jing果然还是 (still has a way)!
Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy as he picked up the bracelet and examined it.
The carving was very simple, like an ordinary wooden ring, with distinct edges and corners, without any decoration.
For some reason, it possessed a unique charm, making one marvel at Granny Jing's craftsmanship, which had returned to its natural state, almost Dao-like.
"Senior, how long can this bracelet last?"
A thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, and he looked up and asked.
"What else do you want to do?"
Granny Jing gave him a strange look. "You only need to unleash the Bloodfiend Divine Light. You won't be needed after that. It won't take long."
Qin Sang quickly explained, "I still need to go to the place where Senior Qingzhu fell. I don't know what the situation is there, and I'm afraid of delaying too long and the bracelet losing its effect."
If the bracelet lasted long enough, Qin Sang was determined to risk punishment and go with Yun Youzi to finish his own business before rejoining Duke Dongyang.
