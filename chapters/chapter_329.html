Chapter 322 The Strong Man


Qin Sang put on a mask.


This mask, carved from what looked like old bark, was crudely made and unsightly, yet it was a mid-grade magic artifact.  Its only ability was to block sight and spiritual sense; if anyone tried to spy on him, Qin Sang would instantly know.


Looking at the people in front of the tall building, most were dressed similarly to Qin Sang – wearing cloaks and masks, or even heavy robes that completely concealed their bodies.


Even those openly showing their faces couldn't be trusted.  Shape-shifting and illusionary artifacts and spells were common in the cultivation world.


After all, Yinshan Pass only guaranteed absolute safety on the stone island.


After putting on his mask, Qin Sang waited for an opening, slightly bowed his head, and walked to the entrance.


Several Qi Condensation stage cultivators stood at the entrance.  Despite their low cultivation, those attending the auction dared not show any disrespect, as they wore robes embroidered with a miniature version of Yinshan Pass, signifying their status as disciples under the Yinshan Pass City Lord.


They were checking the attendees' tokens; those without tokens were not allowed entry.


Qin Sang's token was given by Manager Pu. He hadn't bothered to learn how to obtain one, but he assumed it shouldn't be too difficult for a Foundation Establishment stage cultivator.


After handing his token to the guards and receiving permission to enter, Qin Sang was about to step inside when he caught sight of a figure beside him, causing him to pause slightly.  A look of surprise flickered beneath his mask.


"Little brother, could you take a look? This token should be genuine, right?"


A powerfully built cultivator, a head taller than Qin Sang, was holding a token, his voice tinged with urgency as he questioned the guards.


The token looked like a toy in his large hand.


This man wore a cloak-like artifact, with wisps of dark mist swirling around his head.  Combined with his imposing stature, he blocked the light of the night pearls embedded in the tall building, casting Qin Sang into his shadow.


The voice was male.


Given his physique, it was unlikely to be a female cultivator.


Qin Sang held up his own token, casually observing the strong man from the corner of his eye.


The man wasn't concealing his aura; it was easy to see he was at the early Foundation Establishment stage, though it was possible he was deliberately concealing his true strength.


His massive physique resembled a bear, uncommon among cultivators.  Luckily, his robe seemed to be flexible, otherwise, it would have burst.


For some reason, Qin Sang felt a vague sense of familiarity, a strange feeling that puzzled him.


Qin Sang had met many Foundation Establishment stage cultivators. After considering this for a moment he couldn't recall seeing this man before, leaving him wondering where this strange sense of familiarity came from.


"Senior, your token is genuine, please enter!"


After checking the token, the guard respectfully invited the strong man inside.


The strong man seemed relieved, thanking him repeatedly before hurrying inside.


Qin Sang slowly followed, still unable to place the man, and stopped dwelling on it.


It was possible his physique was an illusion, or perhaps he was simply a stranger who happened to resemble someone Qin Sang had seen before.


Regardless, it was best not to disturb him in a place like this; otherwise, he might be seen as hostile.


Entering the hall, there were no walls or corridors ahead, only a curtain-like darkness. Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to probe, discovering the darkness to be completely empty. Once others entered the darkness, they seemed to vanish completely.


Qin Sang continued walking, stepping into the darkness.  After a few steps, his vision blurred, and he found himself in front of a seat in a hall.


The hall was square, but similarly enveloped in darkness without visible walls.


A high platform stood in front of the seats.  It was empty except for ten girls in Yinshan Pass attire standing on both sides.


As soon as Qin Sang appeared, he heard a girl's voice transmission, "Senior, please be seated. The auction will begin soon.  Allow me to explain the auction rules..."


Qin Sang already knew the rules, but didn't interrupt the girl.  He listened to her clear, melodious voice while observing his surroundings.


The hall was already filled with many people, but it was unusually quiet; everyone patiently awaited the auction's commencement.


Qin Sang soon spotted the strong man in a corner.


The man sat motionless, his fists clenched, veins bulging on his hands.  For some reason, he seemed restless.


The sense of familiarity, which had been vague and sudden, was still unexplained, possibly a mere illusion.


Qin Sang frowned, glancing away.


At that moment, a black light flashed before Qin Sang's eyes, and a cultivator landed beside him.


A man, startled by Qin Sang's sudden presence nearby, quickly assumed a defensive stance.  After surveying the hall, he apologetically sent a voice transmission: "I apologize for my abruptness, please forgive me."

Qin Sang nodded, avoiding further eye contact, and pretended to doze off in her seat.

More people steadily filled the hall.

Past half-past nine.

The hall was seven or eight tenths full.  Fewer people were entering. After a short wait, a ripple of energy suddenly appeared in the darkness behind the raised platform.

All the cultivators in the hall instantly straightened, alert. A contingent of Yin Shan Pass guards marched out, splitting to occupy the corners of the hall, taking up positions for security.

Finally, a middle-aged cultivator in ornate robes, with strong eyebrows and bright eyes, emerged.

He confidently walked onto the platform, paused briefly, bowed, and in a strong voice declared, "I am Gao Yi, the honored commander of Yin Shan Pass's guards. I will be presiding over this auction.  Please forgive any shortcomings."

Immediately, the hall erupted in polite compliments.

Qin Sang covertly observed Gao Yi.  She knew from Manager Pu that he was the top commander of Yin Shan Pass, his cultivation comparable to Senior Brother Qi Yuan Shou—a Nascent Soul cultivator!

He was extremely famous, and ruthless. Countless cultivators had met their end at his hands.

Some whispered that he was the strongest cultivator below the Golden Core stage in Xiao Han Region.

This auction attracted only Foundation Establishment and Qi Condensation cultivators; a Golden Core cultivator wasn't needed. Gao Yi alone was enough to keep order, ensuring no one dared to act out.

"The auction rules are known to you all, so I won't repeat them. However, I must add..."

Gao Yi's face darkened, his voice laced with killing intent, "Whatever schemes you may harbor, best abandon them! Regardless of your background or status, Yin Shan Pass will eliminate you!"

Overwhelmed by Gao Yi's aura, a chilling silence descended upon the hall.
