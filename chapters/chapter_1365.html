<h1>Chapter 1357:  Many Come to Congratulate</h1><p>“Tomorrow is the grand opening ceremony of Qingyang Temple; countless cultivators will surely come to offer their congratulations.”</p><p>Mu Yifeng took out a pouch, “My brother has had people bring all the immortal peaches, spiritual fruits, and celestial liquors from Xiaohua Mountain. You should find them useful. We’ll talk about the other gifts tomorrow.  Don’t reject them, junior brother.”</p><p>“Senior Brother Mu, this is truly timely assistance!”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the gifts without hesitation, “If you ever encounter any difficulties, feel free to seek me out. When you reach the peak of Golden Core stage, you must visit Qingyang Temple; I have a big surprise for you!”</p><p>Mu Yifeng was also eligible to comprehend the Heartlight Cushion. This was Qin Sang’s greatest reward to Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Mu Yifeng showed an expectant expression, then remembered something else, saying, “There’s someone else who wishes to meet you, junior brother: Huang Shengzi, the Palace Master of Shangyuan Quiet Palace.  Xiaohua Mountain is preoccupied with its own affairs, and Shangyuan Quiet Palace is also looking for a new patron. If you’re not interested, just send him away.”</p><p>Gong Liangyu died mysteriously in Blood Lake. The Palace Master’s whereabouts are unknown, and the soul lamp in the sect has been extinguished.</p><p>Even more shocking to Shangyuan Quiet Palace was the disappearance of their most important Nascent Soul puppet along with Gong Liangyu.</p><p>Those in Shangyuan Quiet Palace who knew the truth remained silent. After the initial panic, they hastily elected Huang Shengzi as the new Palace Master, barely stabilizing the situation.</p><p>“Junior Huang Shengzi, greets Senior Qin.”</p><p>Huang Shengzi entered the hall and bowed deeply. He appeared as a calm middle-aged man, familiar with Mu Yifeng, secretly using his eyes to gauge Qin Sang’s attitude.</p><p>“Daoist Friend Huang, there’s no need for such formality.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was gentle.</p><p>Huang Shengzi’s heart eased slightly.  He had been warned by Mu Yifeng, so he didn’t hesitate, taking out a jade slip from his bosom and respectfully said, “These are several secret realms controlled by my Shangyuan Quiet Palace; they are rich in spiritual herbs and immortal fruits…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking,</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the jade slip into his hand, flipping through it casually, seemingly not very interested.</p><p>Huang Shengzi observed Qin Sang's expression, growing increasingly anxious. Just as he was about to speak again, he heard Qin Sang say, “I’ve long heard of Shangyuan Quiet Palace’s four great mystic talismans, their profound mysteries.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Huang Shengzi inwardly despaired. He hadn’t expected this person’s appetite to be so large, actually eyeing the Shangyuan Quiet Palace’s four great mystic talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped the jade slip in his hand, returning it to Huang Shengzi, and meaningfully said, “Qin has some interest in the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman. I wonder if Daoist Friend Huang would be willing to offer some guidance?”</p><p>The Inner Scene Primordial Talisman protects the soul, making the comprehension of the Heartlight Cushion much safer.  Qin Sang had planned to visit Shangyuan Quiet Palace to exchange treasures for the refining method of the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman.  With the loss of the Nascent Soul puppet, Shangyuan Quiet Palace would probably not refuse. Since the other party had come to him, Qin Sang wouldn’t stand on ceremony.</p><p>Huang Shengzi was momentarily stunned. Of the four great talismans, the Nascent Soul puppet was lost. The Heavenly Gang Blade Talisman and the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman were for battle and escape respectively.  In comparison, the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman was the most difficult to cultivate and had the most limited use, especially after the loss of the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>After weighing his options, Huang Shengzi solemnly said, “Guidance is too much to say. If Senior Qin is interested, junior will impart all I know without reservation!”</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Yuan Shen Gate, now Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The mountain gate was wide open!</p><p>Welcoming guests!</p><p>News of Qin Sang establishing his sect spread throughout the Northern Star Territory. Rumors circulated among the unaffiliated cultivators that Qingyang Temple would be accepting disciples on the day of the celebration.</p><p>Even some unaffiliated cultivators from the Northern Star Desert traveled thousands of miles to attend the ceremony.</p><p>As dawn broke, the area outside Qingyang Temple was already filled with people.</p><p>In the surrounding mountains, birds, beasts, and insects were startled from their sleep, witnessing the streaks of light like rainbows in the sky, sensing the terrifying auras emanating from these people, and falling into terror.</p><p>Qingyang Temple’s Guest Reception Peak.</p><p>Led by Li Yu Fu, numerous disciples were all overjoyed and full of energy.</p><p>After years of preparation, they had finally reached the day of the sect’s founding.  Especially since their sect master was Qin Sang, one of the Northern Star Alliance Elders and one of the top experts in the Northern Star Territory;  this filled all the disciples with pride.</p><p>The celebration hadn’t even begun, and the major sects hadn’t arrived yet, but judging by the current situation, some were beginning to worry whether the sect would be able to accommodate so many attending cultivators.</p><p>Over the decades, Qingyang Temple had recruited many new disciples. Except for Shangguan Lifeng, who was accompanying Qin Sang, everyone was on Guest Reception Peak, awaiting instructions.</p><p>The myriad demons of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea were also present.</p><p>Tan Yi En, having served as the chief steward for many years, was extremely adept at handling such matters, working efficiently and methodically.</p><p>Li Yu Feng and the others also obeyed Tan Yi En’s instructions.</p><p>“Grandmaster, did you see that?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu raised his head and looked towards the forbidden area.</p><p>Qin Sang relocated the entire Qingyang Temple, bringing with him the memorial tablets of Yunyouzi, Jixin Dao Ren, and Mingyue, which are now enshrined here.  The earthly lineage of Qingyang Temple has continued unbroken.  Jingtian, upon his ascension, lived to be eighty-two and had dozens of disciples. These disciples spread the teachings throughout the lands under Qingyang Temple's influence. Today, there are thousands of Qingyang Temple branches in the mortal realm, with countless followers and flourishing prosperity.</p><p>"Daoist Chi Lei, Brother Li, Sister Mei, you will greet the guests.  The prominent sects of the Beichen Alliance will surely send representatives, as will Yuan Ying masters and demon kings who were friends of our Master.  Be sure to maintain proper etiquette."</p><p>Tan Yi'en's words brought him back to the present.</p><p>Li Yu'fu nodded, seeing Elder Xun of the Yuanshen Sect nearby, said, "Elder Xun, please join us as well."</p><p>While the Yuanshen Sect did not merge with Qingyang Temple, it remains deeply connected and completely loyal to Qin Sang.  Some of Qingyang Temple's disciples originally came from Yuanshen Sect.  These disciples, later accepted by Qingjun, have no emotional ties to the Leng family and are considered Qingjun's successors.  At Qingjun's behest, Qin Sang incorporated them into Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Currently, within Qingyang Temple:</p><p>Li Yu'fu leads the main lineage as Yunyouzi's successor, representing Qingyang Temple's orthodoxy.</p><p>Mei Gu leads the Moyan Sect lineage, now renamed Moyan Peak.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng brought in several disciples from outside, establishing a sword cultivation lineage.</p><p>Qingjun, daughter of Qingzhu, had no successors to her puppetry techniques, a lineage unrelated to Qingzhu’s.  A Golden Core disciple named Zhao Ying leads this lineage, which primarily cultivates Yuanshen Sect's array formations.</p><p>In addition, some demonic beasts from the Qianshan Bamboo Sea will remain at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang also possesses various cultivation techniques, including but not limited to *The All-Heaven Demon Sound*, which are available for disciples to choose and practice.</p><p>Although several lineages have formed, Qin Sang wishes to avoid internal division within Qingyang Temple. Therefore, the lineages will not be strictly separated. Disciples are free to change cultivation methods as long as it doesn't hinder their own path.</p><p>Qingyang Temple will also have inner and outer courts. Bai Hanqiu will manage the outer court. Outer court disciples may enter the inner court after reaching the Foundation Establishment stage. Seniority will not be based on cultivation level, but on the time of entry into the inner court.</p><p>For example, Li Yu'fu, Mei Gu, and Tan Yi'en are all considered second-generation disciples of Qingyang Temple!</p><p>Tan Yi'en spoke rapidly, and squads of disciples flew from Yingke Peak to greet the arriving guests in an orderly fashion.</p><p>Shortly after, as the sun rose, purple auspicious clouds appeared in the east. A bell suddenly tolled from the forbidden area.  The sound shook the heavens!</p>
