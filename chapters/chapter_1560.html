<h1>Chapter 1551: The Crimson Southern Archipelago</h1><p>Having journeyed through the Boundless Sea and the Northern Sea, Qin Sang was no stranger to the vast ocean.  Returning to the sea brought a sense of inexplicable ease; the Central Plains held too many constraints.</p><p>“Splash…”</p><p>The spray of the waves drew Qin Sang’s thoughts back. He closed the window and sat in meditative stillness.</p><p>Several times during the voyage, the dragon ship docked, and the boatman knocked, suggesting Qin Sang disembark for supplies, sightseeing, or to trade for rare spiritual materials and medicines found only on land.  Qin Sang declined each time.</p><p>This merchant guild was well-versed in such voyages.  They expertly managed all affairs along the way, encountering neither bandits nor pirates, and smoothly arrived at their destination: Parting Isle.</p><p>This island was located near the edge of the Inner Sea.  For human cultivators, the area within Parting Isle was relatively safe.  Beyond Parting Isle lay the Outer Sea, teeming with danger and uncertainty, hence the name “Parting.”</p><p>However, even the most daunting name couldn’t deter the treasure-seeking zeal of cultivators.</p><p>Cultivators would venture into the Outer Sea, then bring their spoils to Parting Isle to sell or exchange for necessities.  Parting Isle gradually became one of the largest trading hubs in the Eastern Sea, its commerce flourishing. The dragon ship’s merchant guild's primary purpose was to procure goods on Parting Isle, with passenger transport as a secondary business.</p><p>“Farewell, honored guest.”</p><p>The ship's steward waited on the dock. Seeing Qin Sang disembark, he presented a silk scroll with a beaming smile. “This island has its share of unscrupulous petty thieves.  Please be careful not to be deceived by them.  The names listed here are all reputable merchants, guaranteed by the reputation of our Mountain and Sea Merchant Guild.”</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the scroll and thanked the steward.</p><p>The steward returned a fawning smile.</p><p>He couldn't explain it, but despite the young scholar showing no particular prowess, the steward always felt inferior in his presence.  It wasn't a suppression of cultivation; it was as if the young man possessed an innate nobility.</p><p>The steward, well-traveled and experienced, trusted his intuition.  He understood the wisdom of courtesy, knowing that building goodwill wouldn't hurt, even if his judgment proved wrong.</p><p>Soon, the steward was glad he’d acted as he did.</p><p>Qin Sang walked through the crowd, heading directly towards a man and a woman waiting outside the dock.  On Parting Isle, with its abundance of cultivators, the couple’s appearance and demeanor couldn't be overlooked.</p><p>“The woman is late Foundation Establishment, the man is even stronger!”</p><p>The steward’s heart trembled.  Especially when he saw the couple greet the young scholar with utmost respect, he realized he’d still underestimated him.  Appearances were indeed deceptive.  Who knew which old monster was playing at being mortal!</p><p>They were Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu, now husband and wife. After Ruan Yu’s illness was cured, they confessed their feelings for each other and asked Qin Sang to officiate their wedding.</p><p>Years ago, Qin Sang had instructed them to journey east across the sea to scout ahead.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Qin.”</p><p>Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu stepped forward, about to bow, but Qin Sang stopped them.</p><p>They were the only two who knew Qin Sang and Daoist Qing Feng were one and the same, though they could only speculate that Daoist Qing Feng might be Qin Sang’s avatar.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked them over with approval.  Both possessed excellent talent, handpicked by the previous generation’s Tower Terrace View Sect Master.</p><p>When they departed, Zhou Jin was at early Gold Core realm; now he’d broken through to mid Gold Core.  Ruan Yu was at the Pseudo Core realm, just one step away from Gold Core.</p><p>However, this hurdle wasn’t easily overcome.</p><p>On their way back to the inn, Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu seized the opportunity to seek Qin Sang's guidance.  Qin Sang answered all their questions.  Enlightened by his advice, they were overjoyed with their gains.</p><p>As they spoke, the three entered the inn.</p><p>The protective formations were activated.</p><p>Zhou Jin’s smile vanished, and he spoke seriously, “Senior Qin, we arrived in the Eastern Sea and followed your instructions, searching for the Nascent Soul legends. We discovered we weren't alone; many cultivators of unknown origin have appeared in the Eastern Sea, with similar aims.  We attempted to contact some, but haven't found any concrete information.”</p><p>Ruan Yu continued, “We tried to trace the source of the legends.  The place where the Nascent Soul cultivator appeared couldn’t have been the Inner Sea.  The witnesses must have been cultivators venturing into the Outer Sea, at least at Foundation Establishment realm. If there were any Gold Core cultivators present, they likely haven't reached the end of their lifespans. But after years of searching, we haven't found any witnesses.  The information is chaotic, and we can't even determine the island where the rumors originated.  Venturing into the Outer Sea is perilous, and the witnesses might have perished in accidents.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t surprised.  Two hundred years had passed; tracing the source was incredibly difficult.  Moreover, he didn't know how many factions were secretly manipulating events, muddying the waters.</p><p>Another possibility had to be considered: the witnesses might already be under the control of some faction.</p><p>Besides searching for people, Qin Sang had tasked Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu with gathering other information.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that after the Violet Firmament Palace ascended, it left a deep pit in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, filled with terrifying Ancient Forbidden Storms and spatial rifts.</p><p>Abyssal Ruins and Boundless Valley were also affected, becoming forbidden zones.</p><p>The interior of Abyssal Ruins was impassable; True Person Cang Hong had unfortunately perished within.</p><p>Assuming the Celestial Halls of Coequal and Minister were also affected by the Violet Firmament Palace, they might have caused similar phenomena.</p><p>Zhou Jin shook his head, "My Junior Sister and I have ventured into the Outer Sea several times, but haven't found such a place. However, there's a recent rumor that someone uncovered records of an extremely powerful ancient Immortal Sect that existed in the Eastern Sea.  In ancient times, demonic beasts ran rampant in the Eastern Sea, and this ancient Immortal Sect was destroyed in the beast tide.  It's said that if one can find the ruins of this ancient Immortal Sect, they can obtain a supreme inheritance.  The Nascent Soul cultivator might have gained some clue and headed towards this ancient Immortal Sect.  The rumors are quite detailed, and many have already been drawn there…”</p><p>It seemed the situation in the Middle Continent wasn’t always stable; peace was hard-won.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then asked, “Has anyone found anything?”</p><p>“We haven’t received any news yet.”</p><p>As she spoke, Ruan Yu channeled her true essence, conjuring a sea chart that included the most famous islands of the Eastern Sea.  She pointed to an archipelago located south.</p><p>“This is called the Crimson Southern Archipelago. Many cultivators have gathered there.”</p><p>The reason they sent a message back to the sect, requesting Qin Sang’s presence, was the increasing number of experts gathering at the Crimson Southern Archipelago. With Zhou Jin and Ruan Yu’s cultivation levels, they couldn’t achieve much, and even if they found something, they wouldn't be able to contact Qin Sang in time, potentially missing a crucial opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected the investigation into the Nascent Soul cultivator’s whereabouts and the two Celestial Halls to involve an ancient Immortal Sect.</p><p>If Sage Hui Guang and True Monarch Dan Yu were truly trapped within the ruins of an ancient Immortal Sect, wouldn’t it be suicidal for Nascent Soul cultivators like them to enter?</p><p>His main body’s breakthrough to late Nascent Soul was practically guaranteed. There was no need to take risks during this period.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his finger lightly on the table, contemplated briefly, and decided to go there and assess the situation.</p><p>His mind made up, the three rested briefly on Parting Isle, gathered more information, and then set off for the Crimson Southern Archipelago.</p><p>Instead of chartering a vessel, Qin Sang summoned a flying treasure, carrying the two with him as they soared through the sky.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Two thousand words first, more coming later.</p><p>Sigh, writing is a constant battle against one’s sleep schedule.</p>
