<h1>**Chapter 234 Plundering**</h1><p>**Chapter 234 Plundering**</p><p>But this did not mean that the Firebirds were weak. Their greatest ability was their strange calls that carried strange sonic waves that could strike one's primordial spirit. Qin Sang was not afraid, but that did not mean other cultivators could be as calm as he was.</p><p>Furthermore, who knew how many Firebirds were lurking in the boundless fog?</p><p>If he were besieged by tens of thousands of Firebirds at once, that scene was too horrible to contemplate.</p><p>Qin Sang had just had this thought when he suddenly found that the surrounding fog was becoming unstable and turbulent. Then, countless red dots appeared in the depths of the fog, quickly dyeing it red!</p><p>These dots were like countless red eyes, everywhere above and below and to the left and right. A great wind rolled up the fog, carrying hot breath that struck the stone disk. These eyes had either been drawn by the cries of the Firebirds or had been alerted by Qin Sang's spiritual fluctuations, but they were rapidly approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang's scalp went numb, and he was almost breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Just as he had imagined, there really were countless Fire Beasts hiding in the fog. If they were all Firebirds, it would still be acceptable, but if there were Fire Beasts with other abilities, being beset by so many Fire Beasts would certainly mean a miserable end!</p><p>When he saw this scene, Qin Sang did not dare stay in place. There was only one thought in his mind: quickly kill his way out!</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Wumu split apart into a formation, and sword energy suddenly erupted, killing a path through the besieging Firebirds.</p><p>Qin Sang's feet stamped on the iron chain, and his figure flashed out. As he moved, the Fire Beasts in the depths of the fog arrived. The sound of the birds became dozens of times louder.</p><p>The deafening cries struck the fog, forming a sound wave visible to the naked eye. These sound waves叠加在一起, like a raging storm of extreme power.</p><p>The place at the center of the impact was Qin Sang's position.</p><p>While fleeing, Qin Sang glanced at his surroundings. They were all identical Firebirds!</p><p>There were no other Fire Beasts.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the faster Qin Sang went, the more Firebirds he drew. Very quickly, he was surrounded by countless Firebirds. Wumu and the Ten Directions Netherworld Banner could not kill them all.</p><p>The strange cries were like thunder and waves, deafening and maddening.</p><p>Qin Sang's primordial spirit was fine, but even it could not withstand this. He suddenly realized that these Firebirds could sense his spiritual fluctuations. Even if he used his divine sense, they would perceive him.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang could not help but break out in a cold sweat for the others. Encountering a siege from Firebirds, their primordial spirits would suffer from sonic attacks, forcing them to resist; as soon as they took action, they would attract even more Firebirds.</p><p>The more Firebirds there were, the more the Nascent Soul of the Foundation Establishment cultivator would be wounded, causing them to fail the trial.</p><p>This was a vicious cycle. He could only endure the attack of the Firebirds, not looking back as he charged toward the end of the iron chain, clearing this stage of the trial as quickly as possible.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly put Wumu and the Ten Directions Netherworld Banner away and then flickered, disappearing from his original spot.</p><p>The cries of the Firebirds started to carry a hint of puzzlement. Even more violent sound waves struck the place where Qin Sang had disappeared, with waves of fire hurricanes mixed in. But they could not find the intruder.</p><p>Finally, these Firebirds dispersed in vain with looks of puzzlement.</p><p>Qin Sang was quietly standing before the group of Firebirds. He had found a way to pass this stage.</p><p>Thanks to the Buddha, there were countless Firebirds in the fog, and they cried without ceasing. No matter where you were, you would be struck by the sound waves. But he was not afraid.</p><p>When he saw the group of Firebirds disperse, Qin Sang calmly walked forward. From time to time, he would see groups of Firebirds howling as they rushed past.</p><p>So, all the opponents in this stage of the trial were Firebirds?</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred. He stopped on the iron chain, looking down at the lava river below. His face carried a thoughtful expression.</p><p>Going back to the history of this ancient Immortal's Abode, ten thousand years ago, it had been occupied by the Demonic Sect for a time. Unless it was a forbidden preserve that a Sect kept secret, countless Demonic Cultivators must have come here.</p><p>Previously, he had heard Che Yutao say that the restrictions encountered by the Foundation Establishment and Core Formation stages were different, so the trials they encountered were likely different as well.</p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators who came in could only clear the trial with their own abilities. It was impossible to receive help from their Sect Elders.</p><p>Of course, they might be able to cooperate with the others.</p><p>A total of twenty-seven people had entered the stone tablet, but Qin Sang had not met any companions until now. But this place was extremely vast, so perhaps there were many stone disks like this, but they were too far apart to find each other.</p><p>It was still too early to tell. He needed to verify this.</p><p>In this area, teaming up would not just be impossible. Any minor misstep would alert the firebirds, and attacking them would have the same effect. They could only wait for their fellow disciples to make contact with them. Staying there only meant certain death. As such, there would definitely be disciples who could not complete their trials and would, therefore, perish in this place. Passing through the passages, Qin Sang concluded that this trial was not designed with any kindness. If he made a mistake, the golden-armored divine general would definitely kill him, and there was no reason to think that this place would be any different. Failure meant death! Could there be the remains of demonic cultivators who had fallen down below and… demonic weapons? From above, the lava river appeared as a red line which suggested that it had borders. The river was not a sea of lava. If the body of a cultivator fell into the lava, it would definitely turn into ash. If it fell onto the bank, it was possible that the bones would still be intact… Unless someone like Qin Sang could be impervious to sonic attacks and collect everything, there was a good chance that the area below contained treasures. Qin Sang was deeply moved. It just so happened that his opponents for this trial were firebirds. Since his jade Buddha was able to counter their abilities, he didn’t need to leave immediately. After exiting the passage, Qin Sang did not discover any signs of time limitations. As long as he was not killed by the firebirds, it should not count as failing the challenge. Even if he was kicked out due to exceeding the time limit, if he could find and loot the bodies of some demonic cultivators on the banks of the lava river, his trip would not have been in vain. Being kicked out of the trial would have been worth it. After all, there would have been no danger, and it would have been completely free. Entering the ruins of ancient cultivators brought about many unknown dangers. Furthermore, demonic cultivators would have long since plundered the place, so there may not have been much to obtain anyway. He had spent twenty years just to advance the four Ten Yama Banners to the completion level. The black market had supplied fewer and fewer demonic weapons, so advancing the remaining two banners to that level would likely take an indeterminate amount of time. If he could find enough soul refining demonic weapons below, he could save a lot of time and effort. This opportunity would only come once. Future trials would definitely not have just this type of firebird. Che Yutao had said that there would be a strange change in the ancient immortal’s ruins. Whether or not they could enter again was unknown. If they did not seize this opportunity, there would likely not be another one in the future. After hesitating briefly, Qin Sang immediately made his decision. He gently tapped his toes on the iron chains, not going downward, but instead slowly flying upward. While flying upward, Qin Sang could clearly feel the increasing pressure surrounding his body. As he reached an altitude of several tens of zhang, the pressure on his body was already extremely terrifying, and he had to labor to breathe.</p>
