<h1>Chapter 1564: The Fat Silkworm's Transformation</h1><p>Quiet Void Realm.</p><p>The external avatar returned, entered the cave, and sat cross-legged before its master.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>The master completed a full cycle of cultivation and awoke from meditation. The second Nascent Soul flew out from the top of the avatar's head, and instantly merged into the master's body for nourishment.</p><p>The master was already aware of everything that had happened during this trip.</p><p>Various experiences flashed through his mind.</p><p>"Southern Sea Immortal Palace, Gu God Sect…"</p><p>This was the information Qin Sang cared most about; at least it was a clue.</p><p>He wasn't planning to return to the Southern Barbarian provinces to contact the Gu God Sect immediately.</p><p>The Gu God Sect was lurking in the shadows, poised to act.  They were clearly not aligned with the overt Buddhist and Daoist forces. Contacting them now could easily draw him into an inexplicable conflict, leaving him trapped and unable to retreat or advance.</p><p>The Gu God Sect would eventually reveal their hand if they had any ulterior motives.</p><p>His purpose in seeking the Immortal Palace was cultivation techniques, not the treasures everyone was vying for. As long as the Palace remained, there was no rush. He would wait to understand the overall situation before acting.</p><p>Until then, it was best to focus on cultivation and break through as soon as possible.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang gestured, drawing the ice cube from his avatar's hand into his palm. The multicolored poisonous spider was sealed within the ice, still alive, its vitality remarkably tenacious.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang broke the ice.</p><p>The multicolored poisonous spider curled into a ball, its eight legs hugging itself. Feeling the restraints vanish, its legs trembled slightly. Suddenly it turned, its eight legs dancing, ready to flee.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The multicolored poisonous spider and the poison web froze in place. Then it discovered several invisible walls surrounding it, trapped in a small space, unable to see anything, emitting anxious cries.</p><p>Qin Sang had set up an invisible cage.  His eyes closed, he carefully sensed the spider, muttering to himself, "It doesn't seem to be a naturally occurring spirit insect. The venom it spits seems to be a fusion of various toxins, with a sense of incongruity.  Moreover, its temperament is extremely vicious. I've heard that there's a method in the cultivation world to cultivate evil insects: feeding them other spirit insects, or placing several specific spirit insects together to make them fight each other, selecting the most ferocious one—called a Gu. This is clearly different from the Witch Clan's life-bound insect Gu technique…Could this be artificially bred?"</p><p>Having raised so many spirit insects, Qin Sang had heard of various insect-controlling techniques.</p><p>The Witch Clan's life-bound insect Gu wasn't suitable for this kind of enhancement.</p><p>Life-bound insect Gu already carries the risk of backlash.  A Gu cultivated in this way would be extremely brutal, exacerbating the problem.  Using it as a life-bound insect Gu would likely cause it to turn on its master immediately.</p><p>Furthermore, life-bound insect Gu and cultivators cultivate together, and cannot be taken by others.</p><p>This multicolored spider's relationship with its owner was not so close. The mark the grey-robed man left on it had been erased by Qin Sang, severing its connection to him.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered and awakened the fat silkworm.</p><p>The fat silkworm, sleepy and still wanting to sleep, was grabbed by the scruff of its neck by Qin Sang and thrown before the multicolored poisonous spider.</p><p>The multicolored poisonous spider, spinning like a headless fly, suddenly saw an uninvited guest, immediately becoming wary. Its body tensed, staring intently at the fat silkworm, warning it with sharp cries.</p><p>The fat silkworm barely lifted its eyelids, glanced at the multicolored poisonous spider, and stretched.</p><p>Enraged by its attitude, the multicolored poisonous spider's belly swelled, its rear end aimed at the fat silkworm, brewing a ball of multicolored venom—vibrant, yet dangerous.</p><p>Instead of shooting out, the venom dissipated.</p><p>The next moment, a transparent spiderweb appeared around the fat silkworm, instantly transforming into a multicolored poison web, 'Bang!' opening and enveloping the silkworm.</p><p>The crisis approached.</p><p>The fat silkworm's eyelids twitched, the laziness in its eyes gone, replaced by interest, then even excitement.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The edge of the web stuck to the fat silkworm, instantly tightening, its contact point firmly constricting the silkworm’s body, raising a lump of fat.</p><p>Venom was about to seep into the constriction.</p><p>The fat silkworm looked disdainful, snorted, opened its mouth, and spat out a familiar detoxifying aura, but denser than any Qin Sang had seen before.</p><p>Within the aura, the outline of a round bead was even forming.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a soft exclamation. He had thought the Fat Silkworm remained useless even after its advancement, but it seemed there were changes after all!</p><p>A halo expanded outward.  When it reached the poisonous spider's silk, the orb within the halo suddenly emitted a powerful suction, instantly drawing in all the silk.</p><p>Only one strand of the web remained, forcibly revealing its connection to the Five-Colored Poison Spider's abdomen.</p><p>The Five-Colored Poison Spider, its meager intelligence completely baffled, displayed an expression of disbelief and frantically pumped its abdomen, spewing more venom.</p><p>But no matter how much venom it produced, the Fat Silkworm accepted it all, the orb swallowing everything.  It even seemed to grow more energetic, wagging its head and tail, looking quite pleased with itself.</p><p>"Hiss hiss…"</p><p>The Five-Colored Poison Spider began to feel fear, its cries filled with panic as its body glowed with a glaze-like sheen, its entire form melting into a pool of liquid.</p><p>This was a scene Qin Sang had witnessed before, signifying the spider's attempt to escape.</p><p>An idea struck Qin Sang.  Wishing to test the Fat Silkworm's abilities, he removed the restraints surrounding the Five-Colored Poison Spider.</p><p>In the void, the transparent threads were clearly visible to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly. Venom rolled along an invisible thread, fleeing the Fat Silkworm's grasp.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's performance surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>The detoxifying halo suddenly flared, appearing before the Five-Colored Poison Spider even had a chance to revert to its original form, engulfing it whole.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, but didn't interfere.</p><p>After the Five-Colored Spider was consumed, it vanished. The detoxifying halo flickered, the orb within pulsating as if digesting its new meal, gradually calming.</p><p>Finally, only a complete, but empty, spider shell was expelled.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm opened its mouth wide, swallowing the detoxifying halo, then let out a satisfied burp.</p><p>Qin Sang, having observed the two insects battling, had a newfound respect for the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Before this, the Fat Silkworm had consumed many things – demon cores, purple crystals, poisonous algae seeds, frog fish venom sacs – but none were purely poisonous substances, and they took a long time to digest.</p><p>Clearly, the Fat Silkworm couldn't directly absorb toxins before.</p><p>In its struggle with the Five-Colored Poison Spider, it had drained its enemy on the spot. This ability to directly consume poison was definitely a newly acquired skill after its transformation.</p><p>Whether the Fat Silkworm would receive significant benefits from consuming the Five-Colored Poison Spider remained to be seen.</p><p>Examining the Fat Silkworm, Qin Sang realized he needed to reassess this creature.</p><p>Was this ability simply due to its transformation?  Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he glanced at the spider's corpse, deep in thought.</p><p>He considered three possibilities.</p><p>The first was the Fat Silkworm's own bloodline; perhaps all of its kind possessed this ability after their fourth transformation.</p><p>The second possibility involved the unique nature of the Five-Colored Poison Spider.</p><p>The Five-Colored Poison Spider was an artificially bred evil insect.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's first encounter with such an insect, and it might possess special properties that happened to be countered by, or were a favorite food of, the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The third possibility was linked to a past event.</p><p>When they first arrived in Central State, they encountered a swarm of phosphorescent insects in the Northern Wasteland's Sky-Splitting Valley.  The Fat Silkworm had made a deal with the insect king, obtaining amber insect crystals.</p><p>He vividly remembered that day.</p><p>Wherever the swarm of phosphorescent insects passed, all living things were drained of their life force, leaving behind desolation.</p><p>Could it be that after refining the amber insect crystals, the Fat Silkworm also acquired the ability to 'plunder,' merging it with its own abilities to develop a new power?</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang considered the third possibility the most likely, as it had a basis in fact.</p><p>However, insect transformations were inherently illogical, and humanity's understanding was only superficial.  Without a large number of samples, it was difficult to draw accurate conclusions.</p><p>Regardless of Qin Sang's thoughts, the Fat Silkworm, having eaten its fill, decided to sleep, retreating into Ya Gu's mind.</p><p>"This guy's getting lazier and lazier,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm's strengthening was good news, but it didn't warrant ecstatic joy. After all, it was still limited to the domain of poison, a narrow range of abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, entering meditation once more.</p><p>After the second Nascent Soul had been nurtured within his body for several days, Xie An came with news of visitors from Bu Nian Mountain.</p><p>Lu Zhang had brought gifts!</p><p>The Nascent Soul returned, and the incarnation rose and walked out of the cave.  The visitor was a young Daoist, appearing youthful, yet possessing the cultivation of a Nascent Soul at the initial stage.</p><p>The visitor bowed respectfully, "Fu Han greets Daoist Qingfeng."</p><p>"Is Daoist Friend Fu the esteemed disciple of Master Situ?"</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of him.  The current head of the Unending Mountain sect, Situ Yu, considered Fu Han his most gifted student, a true genius among the younger generation, and the undisputed next head of the sect.</p><p>Fu Han humbly replied, and followed Qin Sang into the main hall.  He didn't sit, but instead produced two jade boxes, opening them one by one. "Master and Uncle Lu originally intended to come personally to express their gratitude. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, they asked me to deliver these treasures... I hope you won't mind."</p><p>Seeing Fu Han's slight urgency, Qin Sang dispensed with further formalities, and looked at the boxes. One contained a white crystal.</p><p>Its texture was like ice jade, emitting faint white vapor, sealed by the box's enchantment – a Cold Crystal.</p><p>The other box held a pill.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the Cold Crystal without hesitation, but left the pill untouched. "Daoist Lu is a man of integrity, but I have a prior agreement with him; one Cold Crystal is sufficient."</p><p>Fu Han shook his head repeatedly. "I am merely the messenger. Uncle Lu entrusted me with his thanks for your valiant assistance, Daoist. You must accept this True Protection Pill; otherwise, I cannot account for it upon my return to the mountain."</p><p>The True Protection Pill could save one's life in a crisis.</p><p>Unexpectedly generous of Lu Zhang.</p><p>After some polite refusal, Qin Sang accepted the True Protection Pill.</p><p>Fu Han breathed a sigh of relief and prepared to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to detain him.</p><p>Fu Han explained, "With respect, Daoist, the Sitting Bell is extremely important to Uncle Lu; it needs re-refining for his cultivation to advance.  To help Uncle Lu, Master and another uncle have also gone into seclusion with him.  With many matters to attend to at the mountain, we younger generations must share the burden. We've dispatched people to secretly investigate that strange-faced man.  As soon as there’s news, we will send it to Mount Pu..."</p><p>Fu Han's visit was brief.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the Clear Void Realm with the treasures.</p><p>His main body continued its cultivation.</p><p>His physical manifestation also ceased its wanderings, attempting to refine the Cold Crystal to aid his cultivation of the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Firstly, because of the strange-faced man.  Lu Zhang holds a high position; it would be easy for the strange-faced man to recognize him, leading to the Unending Mountain and thus to Qin Sang – a potential threat.</p><p>Secondly, upon his return, he discovered that his main body's cultivation had almost reached the peak of mid-Yuan Ying stage, soon to begin breaking through the late stage bottleneck.</p><p>A breakthrough requires an undisturbed environment; his physical manifestation had to remain at Mount Pu, acting as a protector.</p><p>Seasons changed.</p><p>More than a decade passed.</p><p>Xie An and others suddenly received an order from the Patriarch: the Clear Void Realm was closed, and no one was allowed entry without permission.</p><p>The secret realm.</p><p>The cave dwelling was also completely sealed.</p><p>The physical manifestation sat outside in a wooden tower, protecting the main body.</p><p>By this time, the main body had been in seclusion in the Clear Void Realm for nearly ninety years, finally reaching the peak of the mid-Yuan Ying stage, touching the bottleneck.</p><p>This breakthrough wouldn't be achieved overnight.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't predict how long it would take.</p><p>The only good news was that the Buddha Bone Relic was still effective; the chances of success were high!</p><p>Unexpectedly, this seclusion lasted twenty years.</p><p>During this time, many significant events transpired in Central State, but none concerned Qin Sang.  Even momentous events couldn’t disturb his main body.</p><p>In fact, his physical manifestation barely left the Clear Void Realm.</p><p>The Xie family controlled Fudu Prefecture, coexisting peacefully with the Six Emptiness Sect.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, the Xie family disciples dared not act arrogantly.  Xie An and the Zhou couple handled the affairs of the prefecture; there was no need to disturb Qin Sang.</p><p>Lu Zhang also remained in seclusion.</p><p>After re-refining the Sitting Bell, he still had to refine the Stone Toad and cultivate his divine ability – tasks that couldn't be completed quickly; it would be a long time before they would meet again.</p><p>During this time, the Unending Mountain sent several messages, but the strange-faced man’s whereabouts remained unknown, and as he was a powerful cultivator, revenge was difficult.</p><p>One day.</p><p>Xie An was demonstrating a spell to younger disciples.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt something, looked up, and saw a streak of light flying towards Mount Pu, transforming into a dazzling rainbow outside the mountain, its red glow illuminating the mountain peak.</p><p>"An alarm signal from Unending Mountain!"</p><p>Xie An was startled, his face changing drastically. He ordered all disciples back to the cave dwelling, leaped into the air, grabbed the signal, and hurried back to the mountain.</p><p>Within the Clear Void Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's physical manifestation received the report, and ordered Xie An to bring the signal inside.</p><p>After reading it.</p><p>Qin Sang crushed the signal, murmuring, "Things are getting more chaotic!"</p><p>He stood up and said to Xie An beside him, "From today, Mount Pu is closed; Xie family disciples must not leave the mountain unless necessary. Tell Zhou Jin to be cautious at the Tower Pavilion as well."</p><p>Xie An was uneasy and asked softly, "Ancestor, has something happened to Unending Mountain?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "For now, no one dares provoke Unending Mountain, but other places might not be so fortunate.  The family of a deceased elder from Unending Mountain was attacked by unknown assailants, sending a message for help. The attackers were well-prepared; Unending Mountain couldn't respond in time. Fortunately, it's not far from Fudu Prefecture, so I’ve been asked to intervene."</p><p>"Are they northern wasteland demons again? They dare infiltrate Zhuozhou!"</p><p>Xie An exclaimed.</p><p>He had heard of the frequent chaos in Zhaoyao Prefecture to the north.</p><p>Being closest to the northern wasteland, Zhaoyao Prefecture had often been harassed by demons in the past. These demons came and went without a trace, fleeing into the northern wasteland after their attacks, acting ruthlessly, often slaughtering entire families.</p><p>In recent years, such incidents have become increasingly frequent, causing widespread fear in Zhaoyao Prefecture.  Now, the demons are becoming even bolder, extending their evil influence to Zhuozhou!</p>
