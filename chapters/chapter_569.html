<h1>Chapter 562: The Yokai Treasure</h1><p>Chapter 562: The Yokai Treasure</p><p>The moment the Heavenly Gate appeared,</p><p>more than a dozen figures flew out from the warships and the four-colored clouds, standing in formation.</p><p>Half were from Xiaohan Region, led by Zhenyi the Daoist; the other half from the Tianxing League, led by the Red-haired Patriarch.  Between them stood a strangely attired man in feathered robes.</p><p>He was tall and slender, with narrow, slightly hooked eyes that held a touch of effeminacy. His robes were exquisitely crafted, a riot of colors that seemed woven from countless feathers.</p><p>He wore an ornate crown, glittering with jewels.  A closer look, however, revealed a shocking truth: the crown's frame was made from the bones of some unknown beast, though the stark white bone was mostly hidden by the gems' brilliance.</p><p>His attire resembled a mortal prince more than a cultivator.</p><p>"The Heavenly Gate has opened; time is of the essence.  We implore the Feather Yokai King to utilize your precious treasure and quickly locate the array's weakest point," the Red-haired Patriarch and Zhenyi the Daoist bowed to the feathered man.</p><p>He was the Tianyaoqiu Yokai King!</p><p>The feathered man nodded slightly, removed his crown, and said, "I shall begin.  Please, esteemed cultivators, step back."</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch, Zhenyi, and the others retreated.</p><p>The feathered man stood alone at the front, beckoning.</p><p>Two similarly unusual-looking cultivators, a man and a woman, also from Tianyaoqiu, flew forward, positioning themselves between the human cultivators and the feathered man, watching the humans warily.</p><p>After a moment, the feathered man leaped forward, closer to the eye of the storm, until he neared the limit of his ability to withstand its chaotic power, then stopped and looked upward.</p><p>After observing for some time, the feathered man tossed the crown skyward, muttering incantations, his face showing a flicker of pain.  He then spat a stream of blood, which landed precisely on the crown and was absorbed.</p><p>After absorbing the blood, the crown emitted a brilliant light.</p><p>In an instant, countless rays of different colors shot out, a myriad of rainbows obscuring not only the crown itself but the feathered man as well.</p><p>At that moment, an extremely sharp cry came from the heart of the light, even overpowering the roar of the wind and clouds.</p><p>As the cry grew louder, a gigantic shadow emerged from the light.</p><p>The shadow stood on one leg, like a divine bird, its species obscured by the dazzling light.</p><p>However, the powerful aura emanating from the bird was undeniable.  All present were Yuan Ying cultivators, their expressions grave, even the Red-haired Patriarch and Zhenyi the Daoist.</p><p>‘Li!’</p><p>The bird shrieked, then spread its wings and fearlessly charged toward the eye of the storm.</p><p>But the eye of the storm was not easily breached.</p><p>The chaotic forces within were like countless blades, shredding the bird.  Even such a powerful creature struggled; as it flew, countless fragments scattered, like shattered feathers, leaving a comet-like trail.</p><p>Yet it showed no fear, pressing onward, its gaze bright and unwavering.</p><p>The eye of the storm began to be affected by the bird.</p><p>The bird's forceful entry stirred the scattered clouds, causing them to radiate outward.</p><p>But this did not prevent the bird's demise; its body grew smaller, seemingly about to be completely annihilated.</p><p>Suddenly, the bird let out a long cry.</p><p>Its body burst into flames.</p><p>As its spirit intentionally burned its body, its eyes shot out two beams of pure energy, like swords, piercing deep into the eye of the storm.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The eye of the storm convulsed violently, and strange phenomena appeared.</p><p>Below the Heavenly Gate, mysterious runes materialized out of thin air, existing only for a fleeting moment before vanishing.</p><p>With that strike, the bird revealed the celestial array!</p><p>With the bird's demise,</p><p>the brilliant light vanished, revealing the feathered man and the crown.</p><p>The feathered man caught the crown, flashed back swiftly, and was immediately protected by the two other Yokai Kings who flanked him as they flew back together.</p><p>The feathered man's face was unnaturally pale, and the once brilliantly shining crown was now somewhat dimmed.</p><p>Clearly, controlling the bird had taken a heavy toll.</p><p>"Each use of this treasure consumes more than half my essence. Even with my cultivation, I nearly lost control; I had to damage the treasure's essence to succeed.  It will require a long time to recover."</p><p>The feathered-cloak man swallowed a blue pill, his complexion improving slightly.  He sighed softly, turned, and pointed to a spot in the eye of the wind.  "Mission accomplished! As you all saw, that's the weakest point in the celestial array. It won't change within an incense stick's time."</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch and True One Daoist exchanged glances and bowed. "We appreciate the Feather King's efforts. Your clan's treasure is truly extraordinary! Without it, we would have been utterly unable to break the celestial array using only the Little North Star Array. Your single treasure saved us countless precious spirit materials!"</p><p>The Feather King waved his hand dismissively. "When our ancestors led our clan to establish ourselves in the Little Cold Domain, assisting in the destruction of the Purple Micro Palace celestial array was one of the conditions agreed upon with your human race.  As descendants of our sacred race, we naturally uphold our agreement and fully support your efforts. Besides, entering the Purple Micro Palace benefits us as well. I've just taken a healing pill and need to recover my qi a bit to refine its power. Please proceed."</p><p>The Feather King alone flew back to his colorful mount, but the other two demon kings remained.</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch and True One Daoist both stepped forward, followed by one person each from their respective sides: Cold Cloud Sky of the Yuan Shen Gate, and a young Daoist in a yellow robe.</p><p>The four briefly conferred, then quickly separated, each taking a position and sitting cross-legged in the void.</p><p>Others flew forward, forming a ring around the four, also sitting cross-legged with closed eyes.</p><p>The qi of the numerous Nascent Soul cultivators merged as one.</p><p>Then, the Red-haired Patriarch and True One Daoist simultaneously produced a pouch and flung it into the air.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>A tinkling sound rang out as countless crystal beads, reflecting dazzling light, poured forth from the pouch, converging into a stream in the air.  These beads were the star stones gathered from the two domains.</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch and True One Daoist began chanting incantations.</p><p>The star stones, initially scattered, flew towards the four under their guidance, gathering into a sphere above them, suspended motionlessly.</p><p>The Red-haired Patriarch called out, "Fellow Daoists, you may begin!"</p><p>Cold Cloud Sky and the Daoist in the yellow robe stiffened, quickly entering a meditative state, fully cooperating in the array formation.</p><p>Immediately, incantation seals formed on the tips of the four's fingers, continuously flying towards the star stone sphere. Each seal pulled several star stones, the number varying each time.</p>
