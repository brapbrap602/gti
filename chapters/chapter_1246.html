<h1>Chapter 1238: Blood Shadow Evil Spirits</h1><p>As Dongyang Bo followed Gongliang Yu into the depths, Qin Sang also arrived above the Blood River.  </p><p>"That's the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet from the Upper Yuan Pure Palace. Its reputation is indeed well-deserved."  </p><p>Though Qin Sang was far away, he could still sense a threatening aura emanating from the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet.  </p><p>The puppet itself was incredibly powerful, and since it felt no pain and feared no death, Dongyang Bo would likely find it difficult to subdue it quickly.  </p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected Gongliang Yu to be able to bring out the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, let alone control it alone without suffering backlash, despite the vast disparity in their cultivation levels.  </p><p>This time, Dongyang Bo might have miscalculated.  </p><p>Qin Sang sneered. The stronger Gongliang Yu was, the better. A fierce battle between him and Dongyang Bo would force the latter to reveal his true capabilities, giving Qin Sang the perfect opportunity to assess Dongyang Bo’s strengths and weaknesses.  </p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang’s heart leaned toward saving Gongliang Yu.  </p><p>Regardless of the Upper Yuan Pure Palace, Gongliang Yu’s ability to control such a powerful talisman puppet was proof enough of his value, making him a worthy ally.  </p><p>However, the timing of his intervention needed careful consideration.  </p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know much about Gongliang Yu, nor how bold or resourceful he was.  </p><p>At the very least, he would wait until Dongyang Bo revealed his true intentions and the two had a falling out.  </p><p>Of course, the best moment to act would be when Gongliang Yu was on the verge of defeat, at his most desperate moment. Saving him then would earn Qin Sang his gratitude.  </p><p>After all, the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was still just a lifeless object. As its controller, Gongliang Yu’s cultivation was far inferior to Dongyang Bo’s. This gap wasn’t something a mere puppet could bridge.  </p><p>Dongyang Bo undoubtedly had this confidence, which was why he followed without hesitation upon seeing the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet.  </p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang was curious about what treasure Gongliang Yu had discovered that could tempt Dongyang Bo to turn against an ally.  </p><p>As for Dongyang Bo bullying the weak—he had done it countless times before. He had long since abandoned any sense of shame.  </p><p>While pondering this, Qin Sang used his Heavenly Eye technique to observe the interior of the Blood River. Gradually, his expression grew solemn.  </p><p>"No wonder Gongliang Yu summoned the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet..."  </p><p>As Gongliang Yu and Dongyang Bo ventured deeper into the Blood River, Qin Sang could wait no longer. He quietly prepared the Eighteen Demon Banner Formation and entered the river.  </p><p>*Whoosh...*  </p><p>The moment he entered, he was met not with gentle currents but with a violent, howling gale. The surface of the blood mist appeared calm, but beneath it, chaotic currents clashed and surged endlessly.  </p><p>Along with the blood mist came an overwhelming surge of Yin-Evil energy.  </p><p>This Yin-Evil energy was so dense it felt tangible, like a bone-scraping blade or a flesh-grinding mill, relentlessly assaulting the protective spiritual armor Qin Sang had formed with his true essence, threatening to tear him apart.  </p><p>*Hiss...*  </p><p>To resist the Yin-Evil invasion, Qin Sang had no choice but to increase his true essence output, significantly increasing his consumption.  </p><p>As the Yin-Evil energy surged, several serpentine blood shadows silently emerged from the mist. Sensing Qin Sang, they immediately lunged at him.  </p><p>These blood shadows had no physical form, with the longest stretching several meters and the shortest only three feet.  </p><p>In the chaotic blood mist and the omnipresent Yin-Evil energy, they moved with ease, as if in their natural habitat.  </p><p>The few blood shadows Qin Sang had disturbed were but a trivial fraction.  </p><p>The entire Blood River was teeming with countless blood shadows, numbering in the millions, impossible to avoid.  </p><p>These blood shadows were a type of evil spirit born from the accumulated blood mist of the river over countless years. Nurtured and grown here, they thrived by absorbing Yin-Evil energy, making them naturally immune to its corrosive effects.  </p><p>In other words, they were the true masters of the Blood River.  </p><p>Disturbed by Qin Sang, the blood shadows surged toward him without hesitation. They possessed little intelligence, driven solely by the instinct to devour intruders.  </p><p>Before the blood shadows could get close, Qin Sang paused slightly, and a fiery lotus seed appeared between his brows. A few small, flower-like flames drifted out, accurately targeting the blood shadows and landing on them before they could react.  </p><p>These spiritual flames, refined by Qin Sang, had their fluctuations suppressed to the minimum. By the time they reached the blood shadows, the latter were still oblivious to the danger.  </p><p>By the time the blood shadows realized what was happening, it was too late.  </p><p>The flames quickly spread across their forms, reducing them to nothing in moments, leaving no trace behind.  </p><p>Immediately after, the flames retracted back into the fiery lotus seed.  </p><p>All of this happened in an instant, with neither the blood shadows nor the lotus seed emitting noticeable fluctuations. Moreover, the chaotic blood mist helped conceal the activity, ensuring that neither Gongliang Yu nor Dongyang Bo noticed anything amiss.  </p><p>"Although the Nine Nether Demonic Flames aren’t specifically designed to counter evil spirits, these spirits are at most at the Qi Refining stage. Killing them is as easy as flipping a hand," Qin Sang thought to himself.  </p><p>However, these few blood shadows were among the weakest. The deeper one ventured into the Blood River, the stronger the blood shadows became. If tens of thousands of blood shadows were disturbed at the river’s depths, even a Nascent Soul cultivator might face grave danger.  </p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang tentatively extended his divine sense, immediately attracting over a dozen blood shadows, which he swiftly eliminated.  </p><p>"Indeed! These blood shadows are similar to blood lightning—highly sensitive to divine sense. It’s best not to extend my divine sense too far here. Who knows what other monsters might lurk at the bottom of the Blood River? This works in my favor, though, as it reduces the chance of Dongyang Bo detecting me."  </p><p>Having figured out the blood shadows’ abilities, Qin Sang continued his descent.  </p><p>However, he deliberately slowed his pace, increasing the distance between himself and Dongyang Bo.  </p><p>This was a necessary precaution. The Blood River was teeming with blood shadows, and even without using divine sense, it was impossible to avoid them all.  </p><p>Near the surface, the blood shadows were manageable, and their numbers posed little threat.  </p><p>But the deeper one went, the stronger the blood shadows became, making them harder to kill. Qin Sang didn’t know what methods Dongyang Bo might have, so he dared not follow too closely.  </p><p>Dongyang Bo, focused on Gongliang Yu, didn’t face the same trouble and continued to press forward.  </p><p>Qin Sang lagged far behind, using his Heavenly Eye technique to barely keep track of Dongyang Bo’s movements. With the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet by his side, Gongliang Yu could hold off Dongyang Bo for a while, giving Qin Sang enough time to catch up.  </p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly not only kept a firm watch on Dongyang Bo but also allowed Qin Sang to see through the blood shadows’ movements.  </p><p>Qin Sang chose paths with fewer blood shadows, ensuring his presence remained inconspicuous.  </p><p>The Blood River seemed bottomless.  </p><p>Even after the time it took to burn an incense stick, Gongliang Yu still hadn’t reached the riverbed.  </p><p>Without the Heavenly Eye Butterfly’s abilities, he couldn’t discern where the blood shadows were dense or sparse. Relying solely on the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, he charged forward recklessly.  </p><p>Countless blood shadows surged toward them, surrounding them completely.  </p><p>*Boom! Boom!*  </p><p>The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was ferocious, seemingly venting all its resentment toward Gongliang Yu on the blood shadows. Its talismanic light flickered as it moved like lightning, its heavy fists striking like thunder, leaving behind afterimages.  </p><p>The blood shadows here were far stronger than those near the surface, but they still couldn’t withstand a single punch, their bodies shattering upon impact, unable to reform.  </p><p>All the blood shadows were kept at bay by the puppet, unable to get close.  </p><p>Behind Gongliang Yu, Dongyang Bo was also harassed by blood shadows, though their numbers were fewer since Gongliang Yu had drawn most of them away. Still, more continued to emerge from the depths, replenishing their ranks.</p>
