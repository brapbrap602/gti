<h1>Chapter 445: The Le Sisters</h1><p>Qin Sang’s greatest excitement stemmed from battling human cultivators.  This significantly accelerated his comprehension of the Killing Talisman.  </p><p>Participating in several large-scale battles involving thousands, amidst the terrifying battlefield, facing constant slaughter and the ever-present threat of death…</p><p>His combat experience and understanding of the Killing Dao improved at an astonishing rate.</p><p>This was one of the reasons Qin Sang relentlessly pursued his cultivation; the Killing Talisman was no longer a constraint.</p><p>“I suppose it’s a blessing in disguise,” Qin Sang chuckled wryly.</p><p>…</p><p>The cave held only a meditation cushion.  Seated upon it, Qin Sang, his Qi fully restored, opened his eyes and his storage pouches.</p><p>Various spiritual materials and artifacts flew out of the pouches.</p><p>Artifacts were most numerous, mostly damaged; few were intact, but their quality was generally good.</p><p>Qin Sang ignited a Stonefire, selecting artifacts easily repairable. He meticulously restored them, as damaged ones would be drastically undervalued by unscrupulous merchants.</p><p>Severely damaged items were discarded; repair would be too time-consuming.</p><p>After repairing the artifacts, Qin Sang’s gaze fell upon three corpses on the ground.</p><p>His outing wasn't limited to a single engagement.</p><p>During this patrol, Qin Sang had several skirmishes, but only killed three cultivators from the Skywalk League, largely thanks to his ebony sword.</p><p>Initially, both sides suffered heavy casualties. However, after countless battles, both sides had become exceedingly cautious, experienced, and their formations were tighter, making kills increasingly difficult.</p><p>Capture was even more improbable.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang often operated alone, but no longer dared.</p><p>Not everyone was as wealthy as Qin Sang, with abundant spirit stones. Many weaker cultivators suffered greatly, relying on meager spiritual energy for cultivation, leading precarious lives.</p><p>They endured, hoping for the war’s eventual end.</p><p>Qin Sang’s advantage rested on his substantial reserves from the previous two years.</p><p>Recently, he’d found an opportunity to return to his sect, ensuring an ample supply of earth-煞 energy in his Yin-magnetic bottle.</p><p>Qin Sang refined the three corpses into煞 corpses. After checking his cultivation, he rose, collected his partially depleted spirit stones, and left the cave.</p><p>Torrential rain lashed down.</p><p>A biting wind pierced through him.</p><p>Visibility was poor, but many escaping lights could be seen crisscrossing the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang tightened his robes, activated his protective Qi, and took to the air, heading northeast.</p><p>He'd returned early for a personal matter.  The rest of his patrol team, led by Mu Yifeng, would continue their mission before returning.</p><p>He flew over a hundred islands.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow remained furrowed in thought, then suddenly looked up.</p><p>Three streams of escaping light were approaching head-on.</p><p>The rain obscured his vision; Qin Sang didn't use his spiritual sense to identify them. Within the True Water Thousand Illusions Array, even the most savage demons wouldn't act recklessly.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The lights intersected, then a surprised voice rang out.</p><p>The four lights stopped simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to face the three individuals: two men and a woman.</p><p>The men, of similar age, wore matching blue robes. One was refined in appearance, carrying a folding fan; the other was stern, with a sword at his hip.</p><p>The woman was a forty-year-old beauty, not strikingly beautiful, but possessing undeniable charm.</p><p>She stood close to the swordsman, suggesting intimacy.</p><p>“Rou’er, do you recognize this cultivator?”  Seeing the woman's surprised expression, the swordsman questioned her.</p><p>The woman hummed, hesitating slightly, about to speak.</p><p>Hearing the swordsman address her, Qin Sang preempted her, asking, “Are you Le Rou?”</p><p>The woman was indeed the younger Le sister, Le Rou, who had sold him the spiritual spring.</p><p>It had been sixty or seventy years since their last encounter.</p><p>He had helped the Le sisters unlock their cave's restrictions.  Since then, they'd never met again.</p><p>Both sisters had been at the Qi Condensation stage back then. Now Le Rou was a Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator.</p><p>Time had left light traces on Le Rou's face.  Qin Sang had initially felt a sense of familiarity, but couldn’t determine whether it was the older or younger sister.</p><p>“Senior Qin, it’s really you! I’m Le Rou!”</p><p>Le Rou, besides her advanced cultivation, possessed a calmer demeanor than Qin Sang remembered, yet still bore traces of her former self; her face was alight with uncontainable joy.</p><p>“Miss Le, you’re a Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator now. We can address each other as fellow cultivators.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and shook her head.  "Back then, I took your tree roots and promised to open the cave for you.  It was only right, no need to thank me. Who are these two friends?"</p><p>Le Rou pointed to the man with the sword, her head tilted up.  "This is my husband, Luo.  I often spoke of you, Senior Qin, do you remember me?"</p><p>The swordsman, whose cultivation was similar to Le Rou’s, nodded repeatedly and also bowed to thank Qin Sang.</p><p>"This is Daoist Du, a friend of ours."</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang asked, "Is your sister, Le Xing, here as well?"</p><p>Le Rou still addressed Qin Sang as Senior. "Sister couldn't break through to the Foundation Establishment stage. She's married and settled down with her family on an island at the edge of the Yun Cang Marsh. She has four generations living together, comfortably well-off...  It was because of Senior Qin's help in opening the cave that Le Rou is where I am today. I've always wanted to thank you. But you disappeared without a trace; even Granny Jing couldn't find you..."</p><p>Qin Sang uttered an "Oh," briefly explaining her trip to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. "I never expected to be gone for decades. When I returned to the cave and found Granny Jing's message, I went to apologize, but she was gone."</p><p>Le Rou nodded repeatedly. "After we helped Granny Jing with something she asked of us, she told us she was leaving temporarily, but it's been so long. I was just conscripted and passed by the Moonlit Market. I went to Granny Jing's shop to take a look, but it was still closed. I don't know where she is..."</p><p>A worried expression appeared on Le Rou's face, clearly showing the depth of her affection for Granny Jing.</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked, "Daoist Le was also invited by Granny Jing? I saw the message when I returned, but it was too late.  I wonder what Granny Jing needed help with, and if it was successfully completed?"</p><p>Le Rou said apologetically, "Please forgive me, Senior. I've sworn an oath to Granny Jing and cannot reveal a single detail to outsiders."</p><p>Qin Sang understood and wasn't overly curious; it was just a casual question.</p><p>After a pleasant exchange, Qin Sang told them the location of the cave and declined their invitation to a feast before speeding away.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Du watched Qin Sang's departing light disappear from sight, his expression peculiar.</p><p>Le Rou looked over in surprise. "Daoist Du, what are you looking at?"</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Du seemed to snap out of a trance, his face filled with envy. "I can't believe you know the renowned Shadowless Sword of Mount Shaohua! He's a formidable figure who single-handedly killed a Nascent Soul cultivator!"</p>
