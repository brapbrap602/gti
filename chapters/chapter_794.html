<h1>Chapter 786: The Seed-Origin Demonic Fetus</h1><p>A dark opening appeared in the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly activated the Jin Yao Lock for protection, and dashed to the entrance.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the scene inside was completely different from the Ziwei Palace.  Instead of a hall filled with stone swords, it was a familiar-looking brick pathway.</p><p>The pathway was paved with blue bricks, very smooth and even.</p><p>The wide pathway extended straight into the darkness.  There were no sculptures, puppets, altars, or any writing or patterns at all.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance, observing to make sure there was nothing unusual, before stepping inside.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>His footsteps echoed in the empty passage.</p><p>As Qin Sang entered, he caught sight of something out of the corner of his eye. He spun around to see a jade slip neatly placed in the corner of the pathway.</p><p>The jade slip lay there alone, with a few simple lines written on the ground beside it:</p><p>—</p><p>This is the remnant of my cultivation, which I can no longer continue.</p><p>Worldly affairs are unpredictable, human effort is no match for fate.</p><p>Sigh! Sigh! Sigh!</p><p>—</p><p>The last four characters read:  Ling Gui Island Master.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.  He steadied himself and carefully examined the inscription.</p><p>The writer identified himself as the Ling Gui Island Master, not Qingzhu, which surprised Qin Sang. He guessed that Ling Gui Island Master was likely Qingzhu's alias.</p><p>Leaving behind his cultivation techniques, a gift for future generations, guiding those who would follow, refusing to let his life's work be buried – this was very much in Qingzhu's style.</p><p>Back in the Ziwei Palace, even when pursued by powerful enemies, Qingzhu had not forgotten to leave behind the fruits of his lifelong work, carving two talismans onto the side of the teleportation array.</p><p>Moreover, the handwriting here was clearly from the same person who inscribed the stone pillars of the teleportation array – Qingzhu himself.</p><p>This time, however, he did not seem to be pursued by enemies. The writing was extremely neat and meticulous, each stroke carefully executed, with a very heavy touch.</p><p>The three large sigh characters conveyed a sense of helplessness that seemed to resonate deep within the soul.</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply affected by the inscription, his expression grave.</p><p>Having seen the sword marks in the valley, he suspected that Qingzhu's guidance was meant for him.  But he had no choice. Relying only on himself, the chance of finding the teleportation array was too slim. He decided to gamble.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard many rumors about Qingzhu, building an image in his mind. Though he couldn't fully grasp the man's character, he was at least certain that he was a true sword cultivator who repaid both hatred and grievances.</p><p>But after seeing this inscription, he felt he might have been wrong. Qingzhu's guidance and message may not have been intended for him specifically.</p><p>Or rather, not for any particular person.</p><p>Anyone who had cultivated the "Chapter on Nurturing the Soul Sword" would, upon being teleported here, see the talismans he left behind, thus finding this place.</p><p>Qingzhu hoped someone would continue along this path.</p><p>"Ling Gui Island Master…"</p><p>It sounded as though Qingzhu had occupied an island and adopted the name Island Master.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully recalled all the renowned Yuan Ying masters but had never heard of such a title. He had previously thought Qingzhu must have already reached the Yuan Ying stage, but now he was unsure.</p><p>Completely baffled.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his gaze to the jade slip beside him. After a moment's thought, he summoned a corpse-soldier, while he himself retreated to the entrance.</p><p>The corpse-soldier walked over, easily picked up the jade slip, and handed it to Qin Sang without encountering any obstacles.</p><p>There were no hidden restrictions around the jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled self-deprecatingly.  He picked up the jade slip, hesitated for a moment, and then activated his divine sense to examine it.</p><p>While examining the jade slip, Qin Sang's expression shifted between excitement and disappointment. Finally, he opened his eyes, standing there lost in thought.</p><p>Inside the jade slip were the first half of the "Chapter on Nurturing the Soul Sword," and two talismans created by Qingzhu himself.</p><p>Unlike in the Ziwei Palace, these two talismans were complete!</p><p>Qingzhu's message about his further insights during the tempering of the sword path, allowing him to complete the seventh talisman, before he had to leave, was true – he had indeed completed this talisman.</p><p>But that was all!</p><p>Even with Qingzhu's astounding talent, he could only refine the "Chapter on Nurturing the Soul Sword" to the seventh level before he was forced to stop, leaving behind these disheartening words.</p><p>"This path... is severed?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured with a sigh.</p><p>Qingzhu could not have failed to sense the special sword intent in the teleportation hall. He must have searched extensively, but it seems he ultimately failed.</p><p>Has Senior Qingzhu reached Yuan Ying stage?</p><p>What did he mean by "human effort cannot match the course of heaven" in his note?  If it were simply the inability to refine his cultivation techniques, he wouldn't have made such a remark. Did Senior Qingzhu encounter something?</p><p>Qin Sang had a splitting headache.</p><p>After reading the jade slip, his questions were not only unresolved but multiplied.</p><p>Besides the cultivation technique, the jade slip contained a secret art for creating an external avatar.  Senior Qingzhu had adapted the demonic cultivation technique "Seed of the Demon Fetus" to create this unique technique.</p><p>While obtaining these cultivation techniques and secret arts was certainly cause for celebration, Qin Sang felt more disappointment.</p><p>There were no other messages.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to find hidden meanings, but found nothing.</p><p>"Seed of the Demon Fetus…"</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts and carefully studied this avatar technique.</p><p>He had initially wondered if Qingzhu had fallen into the demonic path, but after reading it, he suddenly understood why Senior Qingzhu left only this technique behind.</p><p>"Seed of the Demon Fetus" is an undeniably demonic and evil technique.  Cultivators split their souls to create a demonic seed.  The seed is fragile and needs to be nurtured within a low-level cultivator.</p><p>Once the seed hatches and the fetal form secretly forms, it gradually consumes the host.  Through blood sacrifices and various secret techniques, it is refined into an external avatar.</p><p>The success rate of this evil technique is extremely low.</p><p>The demonic seed is difficult to create; it's not as simple as splitting one's soul. The cultivator endures immense pain and suffers severe depletion of energy. Accidents are also prone to happen during the seed's incubation.</p><p>After creation, one must always be wary of the avatar turning against its master.</p><p>If the external avatar loses control, it could even manipulate, or even consume, the main body.</p><p>But the benefits are obvious. Once refined, the external avatar can quickly reach the same cultivation level as the main body, cultivate independently, act autonomously, and appear indistinguishable from an ordinary person.</p><p>The reason Qingzhu could cultivate and modify this demonic technique was due to the sword light splitting ability granted by the "Chapter on Nurturing the Soul with Swords".</p><p>According to Qingzhu's own account, after reaching the Core Formation stage, his abilities reflected his improved swordsmanship, rapidly advancing his cultivation. He soon independently developed the sword light splitting ability.</p><p>However, as his swordsmanship deepened, he began to notice something unusual.</p><p>The sword light split by his technique seemed different from what he had split himself.</p><p>Qingzhu was puzzled.</p><p>After years of contemplation, he finally discovered the mystery.</p><p>The sword light created by the technique contained soul power, seemingly incorporating a part of his soul!</p><p>Before this, he had not noticed anything at all.</p>
