<h1>Chapter 2010: Jade Gate Pass</h1><p>‘Pat, pat!’</p><p>Walking on the lotus leaves without using magical power felt like traversing a floating bridge.</p><p>The lotus leaves swayed gently, fish swam in the water, and a misty rain shrouded the surroundings, like a dream.</p><p>Many cultivators, like ordinary people, strolled under oil-paper umbrellas among the lotus leaves and arched bridges, their expressions relaxed, intoxicated by the unique charm of Liancheng.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Occasionally, thunder rumbled from the dark clouds, the sound very muffled, as if coming from afar. It is said that the rain clouds above Liancheng never disperse, yet lightning is rare.</p><p>Qin Sang and Jian Nu made some inquiries and gained a general understanding of the city's layout.</p><p>Because Liancheng's buildings were all built on lotus leaves, often a single leaf served as a shop, with its sign carved on a lotus flower nearby.</p><p>Every fairy city has places to rent cave dwellings. In Liancheng, the area with the most abundant spiritual energy was in the east, where many reclusive masters were said to live, perfectly embodying the ideal of "great concealment within the bustling world".</p><p>After discussion, Qin Sang and Jian Nu decided to find an inconspicuous location on the outskirts and buy a courtyard.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the western edge of Liancheng, almost at the city limits, and purchased a courtyard through a real estate agency, paying in spirit stones.</p><p>The courtyard was built on a gigantic lotus leaf spanning tens of thousands of meters. Numerous small courtyards huddled together; the spiritual energy here was the thinnest in Liancheng. However, Qin Sang planned to use this place as a future contact point, not a permanent residence, so the abundance of spiritual energy was unimportant.</p><p>“Once you contact Senior Tianyue, you can wait for me here. If everything goes smoothly, I’ll come to join you. If anything goes wrong and I'm forced to flee beyond Da Zhou, I may send a message here to ask for your help,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Jian Nu knew his cultivation couldn't protect Qin Sang from powerful enemies; he could only help him gather necessary supplies.  With a grave expression, he nodded.  “Take care, Master!”</p><p>“Take care! Until we meet again!”</p><p>Qin Sang set up a spirit array, gave Jian Nu a jade talisman, and personally escorted him out of the city.</p><p>Jian Nu bowed slightly to Qin Sang, concealed his aura, and silently vanished into the rainy depths.</p><p>After Jian Nu left, Qin Sang diligently began preparations. He stayed in Liancheng for some time, investigating the terrain and the situation in Due State, and combined this with purchased topographic maps to form a general impression of the region.</p><p>Unlike Gen State, Due State's capital, Liancheng, wasn't located in the center.</p><p>Due State only occupied a portion of the Great Swamp. North of Due State, beyond Da Zhou's borders, lay a region more chaotic and dangerous than the South Sea.  This area, situated between the Wilds and Da Zhou, was a mixture of human and non-human races, with demons and monsters running rampant, lacking order, and scattered with powerful clans and forces.</p><p>Further north lay the Wilds. Legend says that after the destruction of the Yao Court, the Yao race fell from power, driven to the Wilds by the Jade Emperor.</p><p>However, modern humans know very little about the Wilds. It's said to be even vaster than the Eight Great Heavenly States. Beyond Fengju Jade Gate, the northern part of the Witch Tribe's territory also forms part of the Wilds, extending even further west.</p><p>"Wilds" is a broad term. In the eyes of humans, any unconquered territory is uncivilized wasteland, considered part of the Wilds. The vast world is immense; even the Eight Great Heavenly States aren't truly interconnected.</p><p>What had become of the Yao race? Had they rebuilt their court? Were the majority of the Yao race in northern Da Zhou, poised for a southern counterattack?</p><p>Qin Sang attempted to gather information and arrange an escape route but only found unreliable rumors. However, Due State's capital city, Liancheng, being near Due State's northern border, clearly showed a defensive posture against the north.</p><p>To reach Fengju Jade Gate from Liancheng, one must travel northwest, eventually arriving at a place called ‘Jade Gate Pass,’ while Fengju Jade Gate itself lies outside Due State.</p><p>As the name suggests, Jade Gate Pass is the final gate leading to Fengju Jade Gate. There's still a considerable distance between Jade Gate Pass and Fengju Jade Gate, but there are no fairy cities in between; only spontaneously formed settlements and towns of cultivators traveling between them, often lasting several hundred years before being buried in the sand. Jade Gate Pass, however, has existed since ancient times.</p><p>Legend says that Due State's Great Swamp extends to the Witch Tribe's territory, encompassing Fengju Jade Gate.  However, the terrain near Fengju Jade Gate is different, possibly due to an ancient battlefield; the area is filled with wind and sand, a desolate landscape.</p><p>Qin Sang organized the data he'd gathered, finalized his route, and left Liancheng via a large teleportation array.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Crack!  Sizzle!’</p><p>The clouds hung low.</p><p>The wind and rain intensified.</p><p>A violent storm raged over the swamp below, lightning flashing amidst the thunder.  A streak of red lightning cut through the clouds.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning illuminated the area, revealing the red lightning to be a majestic hawk with crimson feathers.  Its gaze was sharp and unwavering, its wings spanning over a hundred feet, yet it moved with the speed of thunder, the wind and rain unable to impede its progress.</p><p>A figure was visible on the hawk's back. This was Qin Sang. After leaving Lian City, and several stops along the way, he was finally nearing the Jade Gate Pass. For reasons unknown, the Jade Gate Pass lacked a large teleportation array connecting it to the outside world.</p><p>In Duizhou, the dominant force in the transportation business wasn’t Canjin City, but a group called the Beast Taming Pavilion.  Qin Sang had hired a hawk from the Pavilion for his journey to the Jade Gate Pass.</p><p>“After leaving the Jade Gate Pass, can I continue to hire your services?” Qin Sang asked, speaking directly to the hawk.</p><p>“I’m afraid not, sir. We at the Beast Taming Pavilion do not conduct business outside the Jade Gate Pass,” the hawk replied in a high-pitched, childish voice, like that of an eight-or-nine-year-old.</p><p>“Oh?” Qin Sang questioned. “Why is that? Surely many cultivators travel beyond the Pass.”</p><p>“Sir, we wouldn’t want to give up business outside the Pass, but the forces of Duizhou give us some leeway.  We even have allies to the north. But it’s impossible beyond the Pass…”</p><p>The hawk sighed. “Many who dare to seek treasure in the Fengju Jade Gate are outlaws, acting without restraint. Moreover, the land beyond the Pass is desolate, making it easy for them to hide after committing crimes.  It’s nearly impossible to investigate.  Previous attempts have resulted in the loss of many of our predecessors… Sir, you must be extremely careful once you leave the Pass.”</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in acknowledgement, examining the back of the hawk’s head.  Suddenly, he said, “You’re not a true demon beast, are you?”</p><p>The hawk Qin Sang had hired from the Beast Taming Pavilion was unaccompanied by its owner.  From the moment he’d seen it, Qin Sang had sensed something unusual about the hawk – it didn’t feel like a transformed demon beast, and his suspicion only grew stronger throughout the journey.</p><p>“You have sharp eyes, sir!”</p><p>The hawk answered frankly. “You can regard me as a hawk, sir. This is a unique beast-controlling technique of our Beast Taming Pavilion. The master and the beast cultivate together. This hawk is my lifebound beast, and my primordial spirit is merging with its essence.  Our close bond enhances our flight capabilities.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, *These transportation businesses all have such strange cultivation methods.  The Beast Taming Pavilion, and Canjin City, both*.</p><p>Under the dark clouds, the light was dim. After a night of swift travel through the thunder and lightning, the next morning, Qin Sang saw a beautiful sunrise on the horizon.</p><p>But the ‘sunrise’ appeared in the west.</p><p>At the edge of the storm clouds, colorful rays suddenly emerged, illuminating the sky.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it wasn’t a sunrise at all, but a violent sandstorm, its wind tearing through the clouds. The sunlight refracted through the sand, creating a vibrant spectacle of colors.</p><p>Between the sandstorm and the clouds, the outline of a city emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen many immortal cities in Duizhou, similar to Lian City, graceful and elegant. But this city was drastically different – a formidable fortress in the desert, majestic and rugged.</p><p>“Sir, we’ve arrived at the Jade Gate Pass!”</p><p>The hawk released a red ray towards the Jade Gate Pass.  A slight ripple appeared in the void, like a gate opening, and the hawk flew directly into the city without hindrance or interrogation.</p><p>It was as if they’d crossed a boundary.  Inside the Jade Gate Pass, the land was swampy, contrasting sharply with the endless sand outside.</p><p>The architecture of the Jade Gate Pass was similar to that of mundane cities, primarily built of earth and stone. The walls facing outward were incredibly thick, and heavily armed guards patrolled the ramparts, the city’s protective formation radiating subtle energy, seemingly vigilant against something.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed many people rushing through the streets, most likely not locals, but adventurers drawn to the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>The western gate stood wide open, with a constant stream of people flowing through it.</p><p>The Five Elements League also had a branch here.  Qin Sang inquired about its location and went straight there, presenting his token.</p><p>Upon seeing the Elder’s token, a steward surnamed Ruan immediately led Qin Sang to a back room, bowing deeply, “Greetings, Elder Qin!”</p><p>Ruan’s demeanor towards Qin Sang was relaxed, clearly indicating this wasn’t his first time receiving a League Elder.</p><p>“Which Elder is stationed here?” Qin Sang asked, looking around.</p><p>The Five Elements League wouldn’t assign an Elder to every branch, but a place as important as the Jade Gate Pass certainly would have one.</p><p>Elder Qin was informed, “The person in charge of this outpost is Elder Hong, but he’s away from the city on business.”</p><p>The steward, Ruan, offered no further explanation, and Qin Sang didn’t press.  Instead, he said, “You must have a catalog of the spiritual objects found in the Fengju Jade Gate area.  Let me see it.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Ruan was unsurprised. Most visitors to the Jade Gate came for the treasures within the Fengju area.</p><p>Several jade slips were quickly produced, each representing years of accumulated knowledge by the Five Elements League.  Only Elders and above were usually permitted access to these records within the League.</p><p>The Fengju Jade Gate was an ancient battlefield, remnants of a bygone era.  It contained powerful remnants of ancient techniques left by long-dead masters, fragments of shattered small worlds, and countless wondrous locations producing many rare and valuable treasures unavailable elsewhere.</p><p>Legends of cultivators finding immense treasures or ancient legacies within Fengju, achieving overnight success, were commonplace.  Despite the known dangers, countless individuals continued to venture in.</p><p>The Five Elements League had long collected and recorded information on any treasures discovered within Fengju. Some entries were mere rumors, others detailed accounts, even specifying potential locations.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't access all the information available to the Guest Elder, but this was still invaluable.</p><p>“The Earth Splendor Jade Vine… only this much information?”</p><p>Qin Sang activated the jade slip, highlighting several entries, frowning as he asked.</p><p>The Earth Splendor Jade Vine was a rare and precious spiritual treasure.  The records showed five instances of its discovery, the earliest dating back seven thousand years, the most recent just thirty years ago.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't actually need the Earth Splendor Jade Vine; he was using it as a pretext to enter Fengju, masking his true purpose.</p><p>Ruan thought, *So the Elder Qin is after the Earth Splendor Jade Vine*.  “Elder Qin, I wrote that latest entry myself. Thirty years ago, a rumor spread that someone took a piece of the vine from the area, but they disappeared quickly. I couldn't find concrete information, but given the four previous, more reliable records, I included it.”</p><p>“So, nobody knows where within Fengju the vine is most likely to be found?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Ruan nodded. “I'm not boasting, Elder, but I have a good network of informants within the city. I doubt anyone else could uncover more than I have. If you need this item, Elder, I will immediately issue a reward; a generous bounty will certainly attract the brave…”</p><p>“Hmph!  You don’t understand! The Earth Splendor Jade Vine I need must be harvested using my special technique; otherwise, its power will be diminished, rendering it useless!” Qin Sang snapped.</p><p>“My apologies, Elder. My incompetence nearly jeopardized your endeavors. Please punish me as you see fit,” Ruan stammered, terrified.</p><p>“It’s alright, you meant well.  Post the reward. I need information on the vine's location.  Also, I’ll pay top prices for these other spiritual objects as well—the more, the merrier. For exceptionally fine treasures, I will even personally refine a tailored spiritual weapon for the finder!” Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively.</p><p>Ruan knew this would cause quite a stir in Jade Gate. A Guest Elder personally refining a tailored item? Even Nascent Soul cultivators would be tempted.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped Ruan, who was about to leave. “Find me some people as well—individuals who can protect me in Fengju, and who are familiar with the area, to assist me in my search.”</p><p>Ruan looked hesitant.  “This… ”</p><p>“What? Are there no such groups in the city?” Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>“There are!  But the situation is unusual. Those truly familiar with Fengju are in high demand, mostly already hired for exorbitant fees.  Perhaps Elder Qin has heard…”</p><p>Ruan glanced west.  “For years, rumors have circulated about the emergence of an ancient sword cultivator's pavilion, the Jian Ge, within Fengju.  It's a special training ground, used for honing sword intent and heart, possibly containing the legacies of ancient sword cultivators.  With the discovery of several fragments, its authenticity has been confirmed, and the excitement is growing.  Some even whisper that Fengju hides a special pavilion, the Ziwei Palace, the training ground of the supreme sword cultivator, Ziwei Sword Venerable, the ultimate master of the sword.  The truth is unknown, but it’s attracting more and more people to Jade Gate…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this; fragments of Jian Ge had surfaced. Five were known to the Storm World—Ziwei, Tian Tong, Tian Xiang, Qi Sha, and an unnamed pavilion in the West. He wondered if one had already been unearthed.</p>
