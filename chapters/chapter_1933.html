<h1>Chapter 1924: Taiyi</h1><p>“You should be a Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, right?”</p><p>Qin Sang guessed.</p><p>The Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman and the Taiyi Thunder罡 Talisman were both orthodox inheritances of the Dao Court’s Thunder Division.</p><p>The former was a second-rank spirit talisman, while the latter was third-rank.  The two talismans were essentially derived from the same lineage.</p><p>The aura emanating from Taiyi didn't exceed the late Nascent Soul stage.  Judging solely by cultivation, it aligned perfectly with the second-rank Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman.</p><p>However, it was the first time Qin Sang had seen a spirit talisman gain sentience. He'd never encountered such a marvel before.  Unless he employed special means to peer into Taiyi's true form, he couldn't be entirely certain.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Taiyi's expression shifted drastically. The lightning surging between his palms abruptly retracted.</p><p>“Who are you?! How do you know about the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman and the Taiyi Thunder罡 Talisman?!”</p><p>He stared at Qin Sang, his eyes filled with shock.</p><p>At this moment, Taiyi noticed the surprise on Steward Su's face, realizing his astonishment had caused him to overlook the most important thing.</p><p>The person before him not only knew of these two talismans, but also discerned his true identity in one sentence.</p><p>Deep vigilance flickered in his eyes, but he understood clearly that any action he took now would be futile.</p><p>This person had infiltrated his abode, reaching a point less than ten feet behind him, and he still hadn't noticed.</p><p>If it weren't for Steward Su's warning, he probably wouldn't have discovered him until the attack had already landed.</p><p>This meant the disparity in their strength was vast. Faced with such a gap, any action on his part would be meaningless.</p><p>Taiyi forced himself to compose his thoughts and addressed Steward Su, “Fellow Daoist Su, I have matters to discuss with this Daoist Priest.  Would Fellow Daoist Su please move to my cave dwelling and wait for a short while?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Steward Su hesitated.</p><p>He wasn't sure whether Taiyi genuinely had secrets he wanted to keep from him or if he didn't want him to be implicated.</p><p>But on second thought, if this Daoist Priest Qing Feng harbored malicious intent, even if he stayed and joined forces with Taiyi, they likely wouldn't gain any advantage.</p><p>“In that case, Su will not disturb the two Fellow Daoists.”</p><p>Steward Su glanced at Qin Sang, seeing that he didn't object.  He then cupped his hands in farewell, but couldn't resist saying before descending the mountain, "Cultivation is hard-won, and now with demonic evils rampant and sentient beings suffering, we still need Fellow Daoist Taiyi to suppress these demons.  Both of you are accomplished individuals; I hope you will cherish yourselves and the lives of all beings…”</p><p>He didn't know what grievances lay between them, and could only offer this indirect advice.</p><p>As he rode his crane toward Taiyi’s cave dwelling, Steward Su couldn’t help but look back at the mountaintop.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Taiyi is actually a spirit talisman that gained sentience…”</p><p>Among the demonic kind, it was commonly believed that beasts who attained enlightenment became demons, plants that gained sentience became spirits, and rocks imbued with spirit became monsters. Some also considered everything beyond humanity as demonic, without clear boundaries.</p><p>The most common demonic beings were undoubtedly those of the bird, beast, fish, and insect kind.</p><p>A talisman becoming demonic, let alone Steward Su, even Qin Sang had never seen it.  He couldn't help but marvel at the boundless wonders of the vast world.</p><p>"I've heard that when spiritual treasures are refined to the utmost limit, they can give birth to tool spirits, but Fellow Daoist Taiyi's situation doesn't seem to be the same…"</p><p>Steward Su found it unbelievable, but judging by Taiyi’s reaction, it was likely true.</p><p>After sending Steward Su off, Taiyi's thoughts raced. He spoke gravely, "Indeed, I am a Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, having gained sentience by chance. Daoist Priest, being able to discern my origin with a single word, and knowing these two talismans, you must have also inherited the legacy of a certain Thunder Altar, right?"</p><p>“It seems your origin is from a certain Dharma Altar. Do you know the origins of these Dharma Altars?” Qin Sang countered.</p><p>“There's no need for Daoist Priest to probe. With this connection of the Thunder Altar between us, I don't mind telling you everything I know…”</p><p>Taiyi gradually regained his composure and spoke truthfully.</p><p>“As far as I know, these Dharma Altars are a type of Thunder Altar from the Dao Court’s Thunder Division. I may be a talisman refined by the ancient mighty figure who constructed these Thunder Altars… This is all I know. If you ask me what kind of power the Dao Court is, I can't answer you. The world changes constantly, and nothing can last forever. Even the most prominent Immortal Sects can be reduced to ashes. The Dao Court might have been a great power in ancient times, but it has long since vanished into the river of time.”</p><p>Taiyi spread his hands.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Taiyi’s expression suddenly froze, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang’s left hand.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his left hand, revealing a treasure seal in his palm—it was the Five Thunders Emissary’s Seal!</p><p>Of course, the true seal wasn't here. This was an illusion conjured by Qin Sang.</p><p>But the aura of this seal was identical to the original, making it difficult for others to distinguish its authenticity.</p><p>“Could this be… the Five Thunders Emissary’s Seal!” Taiyi’s face was full of shock, his voice trembling.</p><p>Qin Sang held the seal in his hand, "You don't understand the Dao Court, yet you recognize the Five Thunders Emissary’s Seal."</p><p>“After my cultivation matured, I obtained some surviving ancient texts.  They recorded this seal, the seal of the Emissary of the Five Thunders Court of the Dao Court’s Thunder Division!  You…”</p><p>Taiyi suddenly realized that this seal was in Qin Sang's hands, and its aura resonated perfectly with him, indicating that Qin Sang had complete control over it.</p><p>As far as he knew, to fully and freely manipulate such a seal, one must receive the Dao Court’s recognition.</p><p>In a sense, this type of seal was the official seal of the Dao Court, and seeing the seal was like seeing the person themselves!</p><p>Taiyi’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>In the next moment, Taiyi seemed to recall something. He hastily withdrew the lightning from his palms and bowed deeply to Qin Sang with a solemn expression.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Emissary!”</p><p>His demeanor was exceptionally respectful, his tone carrying a trace of uncontainable excitement.</p><p>"It seems that the official position bestowed upon me by the Dao Court isn't entirely meaningless…"  This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He retracted the seal with a wave of his hand and looked at Taiyi, who remained bowed, "Rise. You are not an immortal official of the Dao Court, there’s no need for such formality."</p><p>Taiyi straightened up, repeatedly saying, "I dare not! The one who created my original form might be the master of the Thunder Altar, or his disciple.  The master of the Thunder Altar hailed from Penglai's Water Division, and even he would bow and pay respects to Lord Emissary. How dare I be disrespectful!"</p><p>At this moment, Taiyi's heart surged with emotion.</p><p>In the Dao Court’s Thunder Division, the Five Thunders Court was on par with the renowned Penglai Water Division.  The Lord of a Court was at least a mighty figure of the Body Integration stage!</p><p>It was said that even Cloud Capital Mountain’s hegemon, Cloud Capital Heaven, didn't have a Body Integration stage expert residing within their sect.</p><p>My perseverance has been rewarded!</p><p>Taiyi nearly burst into tears.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t expose him. He walked to the edge of the mountaintop, sweeping his gaze across the surrounding peaks, and said indifferently, "Tell me about your experiences over the years."</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Taiyi stood respectfully behind Qin Sang and began to narrate his story.</p><p>“Lord Emissary, please look. The Thunder Altar is within this mountain. It's now dilapidated, with only a bit of the altar's foundation remaining.”</p><p>He pointed towards the mountain where his cave dwelling was located.</p><p>“I am a Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman. I don't know who created me, nor do I know why I ended up in the ruins.  Originally, I was without consciousness, a mere inanimate object.</p><p>“Originally, the surrounding terrain wasn't as rugged as it is now. The land was relatively flat, and many mortals lived here.</p><p>“At some point, a Mountain God Temple was erected in the mountains, right above the ruins of the Thunder Altar. A Mountain God resided there, and the incense offerings were abundant.</p><p>“Perhaps it was because of this that I was touched by ‘human qi,’ nurtured by it, and gradually gave birth to sentience.</p><p>“Perhaps the Mountain God here didn't discover me, or perhaps he sensed the changes in the spirit talisman and, pitying my difficult birth, kept me there.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to thank him personally.</p><p>“By the time I truly gained sentience, the world had undergone drastic changes. The Mountain God Temple had also become ruins.”</p><p>His birth was an extremely long process.</p><p>Taiyi’s tone was wistful, a single sentence encapsulating the passage of time.</p><p>What he spoke of was partly based on vague, lingering sensations and partly on deductions made from various traces. Before gaining sentience, he didn’t have accurate memories.</p><p>“After awakening, day after day, I pondered my origins, cautiously exploring this world. I tried to befriend humans.  At that time, unaware of the dangers of the human heart, my mind was simple. I readily revealed my identity, but it only attracted covetousness and pursuit.  Later, I began searching everywhere for these Thunder Altars, collecting related ancient texts.  I learned about the Dao Court, the Thunder Division, and Daoist thunder arts…”</p><p>His memories after awakening were much clearer.</p><p>"Thunder Firmament Sect, you've been there too, right?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Taiyi nodded, sighing regretfully, "The Thunder Firmament Sect obtained some inheritances and developed into a renowned sect. Unfortunately, by the time I found them, the Thunder Firmament Sect had already splintered."</p><p>“There shouldn’t be too many similar to the Thunder Firmament Sect, right?”</p><p>If there were several renowned sects like the Thunder Firmament Sect, the legacy of the Thunder Division wouldn't be so insignificant in Cloud Capital Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the question he cared about most, "Over the years, how many Thunder Altars have you found, and what have you gained?"</p><p>Taiyi nodded, smiling wryly, "None of the Thunder Altars I’ve found were intact. Most of them are like this one, with only the foundation remaining. The inherited legacies and texts are also scarce and scattered. I've exhausted all my efforts to piece together these things.  The texts have been organized and stored in my cave dwelling. Lord Emissary, please follow me…"</p><p>With that, Taiyi flew towards his cave dwelling, and Qin Sang followed.</p><p>Little Five and the others were still waiting outside the mountain.  Having received the message, they were currently hurrying towards them.</p><p>Taiyi’s cave dwelling was also a mountain cave, but its layout was rather elegant.</p><p>Steward Su was sitting in meditation. Seeing the two arrive one after the other, he quickly rose and observed them.</p><p>He noticed Taiyi’s respectful demeanor towards Daoist Priest Qing Feng, without a trace of pretense, entirely from the heart, and couldn't help but be secretly surprised.</p><p>He understood his old friend's temperament. Mere strength wouldn't make him submit.</p><p>"I have important matters to attend to today and have no time to entertain Fellow Daoist. I will personally visit your residence to apologize another day."  Taiyi's words were a dismissal.</p><p>He and Steward Su were close friends and didn't need to beat around the bush.</p><p>“It seems the two Fellow Daoists have settled things.  Su is relieved.  Until we meet again.” Steward Su was straightforward.  He summoned his crane, cupped his hands slightly, and rode northwards.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Taiyi into the innermost chamber, a quiet room furnished like a mortal scholar’s study, complete with brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.</p><p>On one bookshelf, dozens of books were neatly arranged, while the back held wooden tablets, bamboo slips, jade scrolls, and the like, many of them damaged.</p><p>"These are the original texts. These books are the organized content after I verified and compared them. Whenever I have free time, I read them repeatedly, trying to find useful clues between the lines…"</p><p>Taiyi explained clearly and retreated to the back.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up a book and flipped through it, "You yearn for the Dao Court. Have you never thought of leaving Cloud Capital Mountain?"</p><p>Taiyi’s every move showed his longing for the Dao Court, and the contents of the books reflected this as well.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his divine sense, rapidly scanning through the books one by one, before turning to examine the originals.</p><p>Taiyi sighed, “Learning from the past, I have the intention but don't dare. Once my origin is discovered, my fate will not be pleasant.  I planned to wait until my strength increases further before cautiously venturing outwards…”</p><p>Cloud Capital Mountain and Twilight Fall Mountain were teeming with experts, including many Nascent Soul stage powerhouses.  There was no guarantee that someone wouldn’t see through his identity.</p><p>A spirit talisman that had gained sentience was rare and easily aroused covetousness.</p><p>Taiyi could only be cautious, hiding amongst mortals.</p><p>As Taiyi had said, the content here regarding thunder arts and inheritance wasn't of a high level, with little information beyond the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>However, some content piqued Qin Sang’s interest.</p><p>Taiyi had also been comprehending these Dharma Altars and had recorded his discoveries and thoughts.</p><p>“I also want to restore those Thunder Altars, but unfortunately, my talent is shallow, and I’ve been unable to do so,” Taiyi said shamefacedly.</p><p>Qin Sang examined everything, then frowned and asked, “You haven’t found the main altar?”</p><p>When Daoists established altars, there was a primary and secondary distinction.</p><p>The main altar was the core!</p><p>If they could find the main altar, all questions would be answered.</p><p>Taiyi hesitated, “I’m not sure what the main altar is. Perhaps the main altar, like most Thunder Altars, has been completely destroyed.”</p><p>If the master of the Thunder Altar had been slain by a powerful enemy, the main altar would have been the primary target of attack. Taiyi’s conjecture was reasonable.</p><p>Regardless, they had to determine the location of the main altar first.</p><p>Qin Sang had Taiyi lead him to the altar's foundation. He couldn’t help but sigh.  The main structure of the Dharma Altar was completely gone, leaving only a few stone pillars embedded in the ground.</p><p>It was impossible to deduce the entire Dharma Altar from just these pillars.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had repaired branch altars before, the branch altars weren't entirely identical, having subtle differences, which were often the most crucial aspects.</p><p>He could have Taiyi lead him to other branch altars later; there was no need to rush.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, looking at Taiyi.</p><p>Taiyi felt uneasy under Qin Sang’s gaze.</p><p>“You want to advance further. Have you thought about how to break through?” Qin Sang suddenly asked.</p><p>Taiyi’s heart was filled with joy, and he immediately replied respectfully, “I await Lord Emissary’s guidance!”</p><p>“This is the first time I’ve seen a talisman spirit like you.  I wonder how much your cultivation is related to your original form? If your original form is elevated to a third-rank Taiyi Thunder罡 Talisman, would it be like a cultivator undergoing a rebirth?”</p><p>The two talismans were from the same lineage, their talismanic patterns interconnected.</p><p>Theoretically, it was possible to redraw the talismanic patterns on the basis of the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, upgrading it to the more powerful Taiyi Thunder罡 Talisman.</p><p>Putting it into practice, however, wouldn’t be easy, especially on a sentient talisman.</p><p>However, if Qin Sang could truly accomplish this, it would undoubtedly greatly enhance his comprehension of both thunder and talismanic arts.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before Qin Sang finished speaking, Taiyi’s entire body flashed with lightning, his figure transforming into a shimmering silver talisman.</p><p>The talisman was less than a foot long and only three inches wide, gleaming with lightning.  It was inscribed with incredibly complex thunder patterns, forming a vivid image of a thunder drill, brimming with sharp energy, as if ready to burst forth from the paper at any moment.</p><p>“Thank you, Lord Emissary, for your grace!”</p><p>Taiyi’s ecstatic voice emanated from the talisman as it zipped toward Qin Sang.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Qin Sang was both amused and exasperated. He extended a finger, pushing Taiyi back into his human form.</p><p>Even with Taiyi's willingness, he couldn't be careless. A single mistake could result in his complete annihilation.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
