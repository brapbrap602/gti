<h1></h1><p>A faint light shone in the darkness, revealing glimpses of bamboo buildings hidden within, with Venerable Chongtai standing on a tall platform in the very center.</p><p>After reciting his customary opening remarks, he straightforwardly announced the commencement of the trading convention.</p><p>Qin Sang sat up slightly straighter.</p><p>The treasures listed on the previous inventory would be presented first.</p><p>"I wonder what the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* seeks in exchange? I inquired with True Person Yinquan beforehand; there are no renowned body cultivators at least within the Crescent Moon Realm. Given its lack of market, they likely wouldn't dare propose excessively high conditions…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered in his heart, simultaneously sorting through his needs and the items he could offer in trade.</p><p>First and foremost was the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals*.</p><p>Then, the final spiritual material required for refining the Golden Sinking Sword, which he had a high probability of acquiring at the trading convention.</p><p>And also the three primary spiritual objects for the Spirit Ascension Ritual.</p><p>Yuan Yin Water.</p><p>The fruit of the Seven-Colored Mushroom.</p><p>Netherworld Earth.</p><p>The items needed for the Spirit Ascension Ritual were exceedingly peculiar, encompassing spiritual waters, spiritual medicines, and more. Especially the third, Netherworld Earth, which Qin Sang had never even heard of.</p><p>Would merely four spiritual herbs suffice?</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly. He possessed many valuable treasures, but few were suitable for trading, owing to the lack of preparation time.</p><p>Just then, a bamboo building was somehow moved to the very center, beside Venerable Chongtai, its interior shrouded in darkness, obscuring the figures within.</p><p>Subsequently, a white light emanated from within the bamboo building, accompanied by a mechanical voice, its intonation utterly devoid of inflection. "Three Star Feathers of a Star-Dwelling Bird, their roots retaining traces of the Star-Dwelling Bird's True Blood…"</p><p>As the voice presented its introduction, three feathers materialized within the white light.</p><p>Qin Sang, seated within his room, could discern them clearly. These three feathers emitted a faint azure glow, their forms resembling illusory stars, constantly shifting and flowing.</p><p>At the base of the three feathers, within the translucent feather shafts, resided a droplet of blue blood, seemingly yet to dry.</p><p>At this juncture, others could extend their spiritual sense, probing within the white light to inspect the treasures.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang extended a wisp of his spiritual sense, he detected a spiritual sense, undisguised in its overbearingness, sweep across the three feathers, causing the other spiritual senses to hesitate momentarily.</p><p>"Great Sage Heavenly Peng?"</p><p>A thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind as his spiritual sense scanned the feathers.</p><p>The star feathers were damaged, their spiritual energy depleted, making them difficult to refine into magical artifacts. They were clearly intended to entice demon cultivators to participate.</p><p>However, Qin Sang scanned them back and forth several times, failing to detect anything unusual about the so-called True Blood.</p><p>"The three star feathers must be sold together, in exchange for a wood-attribute magical artifact of at least superior grade, and it must possess healing effects. Hmm, if the healing effects are exceptionally potent, the grade requirement can be lowered."</p><p>Before the words had faded, a voice echoed from a bamboo building shrouded in darkness. "I'll take the star feathers. Here is a superior grade wooden flute refined from the main root of a Drunken Cloud Tree."</p><p>Simultaneously, a bamboo building illuminated with white light, revealing a wooden flute with a mottled exterior, imperceptible to anyone other than the owner of the star feathers.</p><p>"Are there any other cultivators willing to make an offer?"</p><p>The owner of the star feathers remained silent for a moment before asking the question, and, seeing no one respond, stated, "Deal!"</p><p>Two balls of white light, enveloping their respective treasures, flew into the opposing bamboo buildings.</p><p>The transaction did not need to be completed immediately. If dissatisfied, the treasures could be displayed outside, awaiting subsequent trades, potentially offering better opportunities.</p><p>The Myriad Demons Assembly would collect its commission after the trading convention concluded.</p><p>Throughout the exchange, Venerable Chongtai remained silent. Witnessing such smooth progress with the first deal, a smile graced his face, his ears twitching slightly as he spoke, "Next, please!"</p><p>The bamboo building retreated into the darkness, and another bamboo building moved forward.</p><p>"Heavenfall Iron, suitable for refining cold-attribute magical artifacts…"</p><p>"Cold Bone Demon Hand, an ancient Cold Bone Dao demon weapon, superior grade, activated by essence blood, possessing the power of an excellent item…"</p><p>…</p><p>Rare and precious treasures, seldom seen in ordinary times, were showcased in turn.</p><p>Some reached a transaction, while others were placed before the bamboo buildings, awaiting a suitable price.</p><p>"*Seven Teacher Buddha Seals*, a Buddhist body cultivator martial art…"</p><p>Finally, the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* that Qin Sang had anticipated made its appearance. He grasped the jade talisman, watching as a jade scroll floated before the central bamboo building.</p><p>A body cultivation martial art of the Nascent Soul stage was a rarity even at past Myriad Demons Assemblies. Qin Sang keenly sensed the fluctuations of spiritual senses emanating from numerous bamboo buildings, indicating a widespread curiosity about this divine ability.</p><p>"Hopefully, Great Sage Heavenly Peng won't make a move."</p><p>Qin Sang assessed his assets, lacking the confidence to compete with a demon saint.</p><p>At that moment, the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* offered a brief introduction before hesitating and stating, "Exchanging for a top-tier earth-attribute evasion technique."</p><p>This declaration elicited a stir.</p><p>"You jest, Daoist friend? A body cultivation divine ability in exchange for a top-tier evasion technique?"</p><p>Someone couldn't resist speaking out. Although the tone was devoid of inflection, the skepticism was unmistakable.</p><p>If the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* hadn't exaggerated, its value could indeed be equivalent.</p><p>But the reality was that body cultivation was nearing extinction.</p><p>Then, the bamboo building that had acquired the star feathers earlier echoed with a voice. "Why not release your spiritual sense, Daoist friend, and allow us to observe a portion of its contents, to better judge its value? We can't simply rely on your one-sided account."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a knot tighten in his heart.</p><p>The demons indeed had designs!</p><p>The owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* ignored the skepticism, uttering a simple, "Very well!"</p><p>Subsequently, strands of spiritual sense probed into the jade scroll in succession, each exhibiting profound curiosity towards the body cultivation divine ability.</p><p>The jade scroll only revealed a portion of the general principles.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly perused the entirety of the exposed content.</p><p>The *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* were, in fact, seven types of Buddhist hand seals. According to the description in the general principles, each hand seal possessed extreme strength and ferocity, boasting extraordinary power.</p><p>Correspondingly, the execution of this divine ability placed an immense burden on the practitioner's physical body, only bearable by a pure body cultivator.</p><p>Body cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage could barely execute the first seal, while those in the early Nascent Soul stage could only execute the first four seals.</p><p>This alone demonstrated the extraordinary nature of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals*.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Qin Sang also secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>For, according to the description in the general principles, this divine ability was specifically created according to the characteristics of the human race. Even if demons forcibly executed it, the power of the Buddha Seals would clash with their own bloodlines, injuring themselves before harming others, and severely diminishing its power.</p><p>Great Sage Heavenly Peng would likely not participate in the competition with fervor.</p><p>Otherwise, the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* wouldn't have hesitated so much when proposing the conditions.</p><p>The current problem was that Qin Sang possessed no top-tier earth-attribute evasion technique. What could he use to persuade the other party?</p><p>A moment of silence descended upon the Lake Heart Island.</p><p>Then, a voice suddenly resounded, "I heard that an ancient Buddhist Sect relic emerged two years ago. Daoist friend, you likely obtained the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* from there, correct?"</p><p>After pausing, and seeing that the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seals* remained silent, the person continued, "May I ask, Daoist friend, do you possess any other Buddhist techniques or divine abilities? Hmm, excluding those related to body cultivation."</p><p>Had someone from a Buddhist Sect arrived?</p><p>Everyone followed the sound, only to see a stretch of darkness.</p><p>It was unheard of for any Buddhist Sect to possess a Nascent Soul stage senior monk, likely entrusting a Nascent Soul cultivator to make the purchase on their behalf.</p>
