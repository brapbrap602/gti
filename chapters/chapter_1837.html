Chapter 1828 Self-Detonation


Nine Sun Divine Birds emerged simultaneously!

Crimson Southern Bright Emberfire coalesced before Qin Sang's chest, birthing a miniature sun.

This strike had clearly been planned for a long time. Because it was the Vermillion Bird fledgling spirit controlling the Sun Divine Birds, Qin Sang didn't need to divide his attention during the fight.

The Celestial Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang, and the Vermillion Bird fledgling spirit cooperated flawlessly in this moment, leaving their opponent no chance to react!

True Essence surged forth like a bursting dam.

From the start of his battle with Xiahou, Qin Sang had withdrawn the Four-Chariot Serpent Seal, and only occasionally used the Grey Warbler Sword, all to conserve True Essence for this very moment!

The blazing flames stung Xiahou's eyes and shook its spirit. Its pupils constricted sharply, revealing a look of terror.

Reflected in its eyes was the miniature sun, and also Qin Sang's gaze – a calm, indifferent gaze.

This calmness, in Xiahou's view, was the ultimate madness.

The miniature sun expanded, the overwhelmingly violent power about to erupt. Yet Qin Sang continued to grapple with it, showing no sign of retreat, utterly indifferent to the danger.

That resolute determination, a vow to perish alongside his opponent!

What else could this be but madness?

Among cultivators who had reached their level, there was no shortage of courageous and ferocious individuals, but few would wager their lives for external gains.

Xiahou was terrified. It wanted to break free from Qin Sang, to dodge, but the Sun Divine Tree had appeared too suddenly, the Southern Bright Emberfire erupted too quickly.

‘Boom!’

Intense crimson light burst forth from the chests of both combatants, and raging flames instantly engulfed man and deer.

The flames continued to expand, fiery pythons danced wildly, and the firelight illuminated the palace, turning everything crimson, making it impossible to see.

Xiahou's eyes bulged in fury. In its panic, it struggled frantically, its body twisting and contorting. It had just interrupted its Deer Shadow divine ability due to the tribulation lightning, and the Deer Shadow, still hovering mid-air, was out of reach!

At this moment, the restraints binding Xiahou vanished.

But the terror in its heart didn't diminish in the slightest.

‘Crack!’

The Deer Shadow shattered.

Xiahou's blood surged violently, and a faint Deer Shadow reappeared, attempting to shield it, forming a layer of shadow armor.

But before the Deer Shadow could fully materialize, the flames arrived.

Xiahou tried to retreat, watching helplessly as the Deer Shadow was instantly dyed crimson, melting and shattering within the flames. The fragments of the Deer Shadow were then swept away by the fire, annihilated within the inferno.

The Southern Bright Emberfire, carrying the might of shattering shadows, engulfed Xiahou before its horrified gaze!

Xiahou's vision was filled with crimson. It felt an incomparably violent force slam into it, and with a shrill, miserable cry, it was sent flying, the blood spraying from its mouth instantly evaporated by the flames.

As the flames erupted, a bolt of azure lightning shot out from the center of the inferno, as if frantically escaping, or perhaps flung out by the terrifying force of the explosion. It slammed directly into the palace wall.

A resounding ‘Dong’ echoed as a figure, practically plastered against the wall in a spread-eagle position, became visible beneath the azure light.

It was Qin Sang. His entire body emanated a scorched smell, and his Returning Wind Armor was gone.

The precious armor, having endured Xiahou's fierce attacks and the devouring flames, was completely destroyed, reduced to nothingness.

Not even a single fragment remained.

Before this, Qin Sang and Master Qi had discussed it numerous times, and Master Qi had racked his brains to improve the Returning Wind Armor,一心 wanting to fuse the True Treasure fragment with it, to forge a true treasure armor.

The armor, meticulously crafted with Master Qi's countless efforts and painstaking care, was destroyed in this battle!

Fortunately, as Qin Sang retreated, a canvas-like object fell down – the True Treasure fragment.

The True Treasure fragment remained, swept away by the flames, fluttering up and down like a butterfly within the inferno.

"Pfft!"

Qin Sang slumped to the ground, spitting blood, his breath ragged.

His chest was caved in, a bloody hole gaping within, and he felt his internal organs displaced, grievously wounded.

Qin Sang had held on until the very last moment before the Southern Bright Emberfire erupted before releasing his hold.

Even though the Vermillion Bird fledgling spirit could slightly guide the direction of the explosion, even though everything was under his control, and his timing was extremely precise, he still couldn't avoid injury.

Ignoring his own wounds, Qin Sang stared intently at the center of the flames. He had estimated the power of the Nine Birds based on his own strength, and at the moment of their fusion and explosion, he had restrained Xiahou at close range, ensuring it would at least be severely injured!

‘Swish!’

Dots of jade light appeared before Qin Sang – jade bottles.

‘Crack, crack, crack…’

The jade bottles shattered simultaneously, a portion of the flower nectar being sucked into Qin Sang's mouth, while most dissipated into the air.

Poisons, feared by others like tigers, became Qin Sang's quick replenishment for True Essence.

Breathing heavily, he narrowed his eyes slightly, the scene within the sea of fire reflected in his mind through his Celestial Eye divine ability.

He saw the black deer within the sea of fire, just like him, crashed against the opposite wall, in a sorry state.

It was still alive!

After all, it was a late Nascent Soul realm demon beast. Qin Sang had anticipated this, his expression calm.  He didn't rush to heal, his five fingers moving in the air as if playing a zither.

The formless poison he had secretly deployed earlier, during his fierce battle with Xiahou, had been subtly introduced into Xiahou's body.

The formless poison had remained dormant.

Following Qin Sang's movements, runes appeared between his fingers, merging with the poison, a faint green light flickering and vanishing.

Within the green light was a green square seal, which turned formless and instantly disappeared, followed by the diffusion of a strange power.

This was a venomous divine ability from the *Poison God Canon*, called the Annihilating Poison Domain.

The Annihilating Poison Domain, combined with the formless poison refined from flower nectar, hidden until now, finally revealed its fangs!

Xiahou slammed hard against the wall, the intense pain assaulting its senses, pain coursing through its entire body.

Its chest and abdomen were even more severely injured than Qin Sang's, its fur melted away, exposing bright red internal organs, nearly pierced through by the Southern Bright Emberfire.

Its remaining vital essence desperately converged towards its inner core, resisting the erosion of the flames.

Fear arose within Xiahou's heart. After entering the Hollow Profound realm, it wasn't that it hadn't been seriously injured, but this was the first time it had been so grievously wounded after using its innate divine ability.

Even more terrifying, the new injuries had triggered old ones, waves of weakness washing over it.

It was in unprecedented danger!

Xiahou desperately circulated its innate divine ability to suppress its injuries, then felt a numbness spreading through its mangled body.

"This is…"

The more critical the situation, the clearer Xiahou's mind became. It immediately thought of the poisonous qi that permeated Qin Sang's body.

"Poison!"

Xiahou was horrified.

Under normal circumstances, it could suppress the poison within its body, but in its current state, it was like adding insult to injury.

In the next moment, Qin Sang, having deployed the Annihilating Poison Domain, stood up, then heard an extremely shrill roar, his gaze hardening.

Xiahou raised its head and howled, its mangled body erupting with an overwhelmingly powerful aura, an aura filled with resolve and the will to die.

Qin Sang was secretly alarmed, discovering that the operation of the Annihilating Poison Domain had stagnated. Then, he saw black and white auras surging from Xiahou's body, growing increasingly dense.

At the same time, Xiahou's blood essence burned rapidly, its roars becoming increasingly sharp.

Old injuries were ignited, but Xiahou ignored them completely.

Its demonic eyes were bloodshot, filled with boundless hatred.

‘Whoosh!’

The black and white auras shot through the air like two giant pythons, one black and one white, heading straight for Qin Sang.

Xiahou merged with the two auras, its blood essence burning, its life force weakening, yet the black and white auras grew stronger.

This was its final, desperate counterattack, a reckless charge, a display of suicidal intent!

Qin Sang's expression changed, immediately about to dodge, adopting a defensive posture.

Unexpectedly, the black and white auras, halfway through their flight, changed direction, charging towards the palace gate at an even greater speed.

Qin Sang's expression darkened. He had risked everything, exhausted almost all his trump cards, and finally forced Xiahou to a dead end. How could he let it escape!

The two black dragons outside the palace gate might not be able to stop Xiahou if it fled with all its might.

Qin Sang didn't hesitate to stop his evasive maneuver. With a powerful flap of his phoenix wings, he arrived at the palace gate almost simultaneously with Xiahou.

At this moment, a glint of cunning flashed in Xiahou's hate-filled eyes.

‘Boom!’

A vortex suddenly formed at the center of the black and white auras. Antlers emerged from the vortex, drawing in the black and white auras, flashing towards Qin Sang, and striking out with a sudden sweep.

This strike contained no crescent moon cold light, only a startling binding force that enveloped Qin Sang.

This strike burned through all of Xiahou's remaining blood essence, exhausting all its power!

Following the antlers, another object emerged from the vortex, a pill, half black and half white, its luster pure.

A Demon Core!

The black deer raised its head and spat out its Demon Core, its expression filled with resolve.

At this point, only this could offer a chance to turn the tables, even if the price was incredibly painful!

As it unleashed its antlers and spat out its Demon Core, Xiahou's aura surged out of the palace, alerting the black dragons.

The black dragons roared, flying away from the palace gate, their bodies coiling, their massive heads fixed on the gate, staring intently at Xiahou.

If Xiahou dared to take half a step out of the palace, it would be met with a thunderous attack.

‘Swish!’

The antlers bound Qin Sang.

The lightning dimmed, and Qin Sang, caught off guard, was paralyzed.

The Demon Core spun as it flew, its rotation seemingly slow, yet it captivated Qin Sang's gaze.

Sensing Xiahou's resolute intent, Qin Sang opened his mouth as if to scream, his expression filled with fear.

The Demon Core reflected in his pupils, and several cracks appeared on its surface.

Then, an overwhelmingly powerful aura erupted!

At this moment, the fear in Qin Sang's expression vanished abruptly, replaced by his usual composure.

He skillfully executed a hand seal, and flesh began to regenerate in the bloody hole in his chest. His heavily injured body recovered at a visible speed, and his weakened aura surged.

‘Whoosh!’

An aura no less powerful than his peak state erupted from Qin Sang, and in Xiahou's shocked and despairing gaze, he punched forcefully at the void before him.

‘Crack!’

The void exploded with a sonic boom, and the antlers trembled violently.

Under this punch, the binding force crumbled.

Qin Sang broke free from the restraints, flapping his phoenix wings, calmly retreating.

‘Boom!’

The Demon Core detonated!

Chaotic black and white currents swept in all directions.

The two black dragons waiting at the archway bore the brunt of the blast, their heads exploding instantly, their remains swept away by the currents and vanishing without a sound.

The dragon image on the palace gate reappeared, somewhat dimmer than before.

According to Xiahou's plan, the self-detonation of the Demon Core would eliminate Qin Sang and the two black dragons in one fell swoop, allowing its remnant soul to escape.

As for how the remnant soul would survive within the Ritual Arena, it couldn't consider that now.

Qin Sang retreated again and again, his expression grave. The power of the detonating Demon Core was even greater than the combined might of the Nine Birds.

If he hadn't been a step ahead, he wouldn't have escaped this calamity.

Facing Xiahou, Qin Sang had never considered capturing it alive.

He believed he had a chance to kill Xiahou, but after careful consideration, he felt there was considerable risk.

Luring Xiahou into self-detonating its Demon Core would destroy all the spoils, but Qin Sang could ensure his own safety.

He was slaying Xiahou for enlightenment, and the spoils were not important.

As he retreated, a cold glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.  A clear sword cry seemed to resonate within him, his entire being transforming into a sword, erupting with sharp sword intent.

Outside the palace.

Within the turbulent currents, a small, illusory deer shadow wore a look of shock and unwillingness. Seeing Qin Sang break free from the antlers, it foresaw its own end.

In the next moment, the deer shadow froze, shattering from its brow, dissipating like the wind.

Xiahou, dead!

The chaos gradually subsided.

A soft sigh echoed from within the palace.

Qin Sang let out a long breath, surveying the devastated palace. The structure, exceptionally sturdy, remained unscathed after the continuous battles.

Lingering flames burned within the palace, along with the remnants of the Demon Core's aura.

Finally, Qin Sang looked towards the Five Elements Crown on the well platform.

When unleashing the Southern Bright Emberfire, he had deliberately chosen a location not far from the palace gate, as far away from the Five Elements Crown as possible. The Demon Core had also detonated at the gate, most of its residual force directed outwards.

It seemed the Five Elements Crown's artifact spirit hadn't been disturbed.

He took out a handful of pills and swallowed them whole, then moved to the well platform.

The Inner Lion Seal had a limited duration, and he had to return to his cave dwelling to heal as soon as possible.

If he couldn't subdue the Five Elements Crown, he could only leave it here and return later.

Recalling the information Mo Xingdao had given him, Qin Sang raised his hand, pressing it virtually above the Five Elements Crown, closing his eyes slightly.

As his divine sense touched the Five Elements Crown, Qin Sang immediately sensed incredibly frantic demonic thoughts.

It was vastly different from Mo Xingdao's description.

Previously, although the artifact spirit was frantic, due to the timely response of Sage Hui Guang and Sage Qing Hu, they had sealed the artifact spirit with restrictions, making it possible to control the treasure.

Now, all the restrictions within the Five Elements Crown had vanished.

As the fusion between the artifact spirit and the demonic soul deepened, the artifact spirit had grown stronger.

The previous methods were no longer applicable.

The artifact spirit's consciousness was chaotic, making communication impossible.

A thoughtful look appeared on Qin Sang's face. His immunity to demonic thoughts was his advantage. As a temporary measure, he could actively allow his divine sense to accept the demonic thoughts, using them as a disguise to appease the artifact spirit, temporarily easing its rejection of him, and retrieving the treasure first.

But subduing the treasure in the future would still be no easy task, requiring long-term planning.

Having devised a plan, Qin Sang was about to act when he suddenly turned around, his expression drastically changing.

‘Swish!’

Mo Xingdao was summoned by Qin Sang. Regaining his senses, he looked at Qin Sang with some bewilderment.

He was still unaware of the battle's outcome, seeing only the chaotic cave dwelling and Qin Sang alone.

With his intelligence, he immediately guessed part of what had transpired, his eyes filled with shock.

"How could Hong Yuzi have found this place?"

Qin Sang stared at Mo Xingdao, his voice heavy with questioning.

He had left a warning restriction outside, and it had just been triggered from the outside.  Currently, only Hong Yuzi was likely to seek him out here.

Mo Xingdao was startled. "I never told him about the Five Elements Crown."

Qin Sang gazed outside the palace.

He had repeatedly confirmed that the mirror's interior was a unique space, and no matter how intense the battle, it wouldn't affect the outside world.

It was even less likely for Sage Qing Hu and Xiahou to leave any traces, intentionally leading Hong Yuzi here.

Perhaps Hong Yuzi was proficient in tracking techniques.

Or perhaps Hong Yuzi had known something all along!
