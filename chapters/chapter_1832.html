<h1>Chapter 1823: Mirror Image</h1><p>Mo Xingdao's belongings did not contain the key, indicating that he had been completely controlled by Hong Yuzi, not only revealing the secret of the innate spiritual treasure but also handing over the key.</p><p>This was their worst-case scenario.</p><p>With the key in Hong Yuzi's possession, they either had to kill Hong Yuzi and seize the key, or restrain Hong Yuzi for a while to retrieve the treasure as quickly as possible.</p><p>The latter, however, was risky. Their abilities might not be able to restrain Hong Yuzi for long. If Hong Yuzi escaped and interfered, it would only complicate matters further.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King remained silent, looking towards the battlefield, waiting for Xia Hou's decision.</p><p>She couldn't command Xia Hou, only observing whether Xia Hou would choose to fight Hong Yuzi to the death.</p><p>Four celestial pillars stood in the lake, reaching up to the bright moon.</p><p>One was a fourth-rank Daoist official, the other a follower of the Yao Wang, Tianqiu Wang, known as the second Yao Hou under Tianqiu Wang.</p><p>The figures of these two top-tier experts were currently invisible.</p><p>Between the pillars, qi and blood were swirling, with black and white qi constantly circulating, forming a black and white vortex.</p><p>At the center of the vortex, radiant light overflowed, seemingly about to break through the black and white qi, clearly the treasure light emanating from the Jiuhui Orb.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King's eyes gleamed with divine light as she saw the situation on the battlefield.</p><p>Xia Hou was nowhere to be seen, only the divine deer. It was unclear whether he was constantly merging with the divine deer's phantom or had manifested his true form.</p><p>The two antlers on the divine deer's head, one black and one white, respectively emitted black and white light, the source of the ceaseless black and white qi.</p><p>The black and white qi complemented each other, and their fusion created a strange suction force.</p><p>The Jiuhui Orb floated in the vortex, repeatedly attempting to break free, but was pulled back and tightly bound by the black and white qi.</p><p>Simultaneously, the divine deer's eyes, like its antlers, were one black and one white, staring at the black giant mountain transformed from the Qianshan scroll, shooting out two substantial beams of light.</p><p>Strange patterns appeared in the beams of light, falling onto the black giant mountain.</p><p>Whether it was a divine deer ability or a unique treasure, the patterns twisted and formed eye-like images, creating a giant eye out of thin air.</p><p>The giant eye, half black and half white, like a celestial eye, locked onto the black giant mountain, emitting an invisible force to withstand its repeated impacts.</p><p>The divine deer stood between Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao, adopting a half-offensive, half-defensive strategy, not aiming to kill but to prevent Hong Yuzi from approaching another battlefield.</p><p>Hong Yuzi stood below the Jiuhui Orb; although his troops had suffered losses, he remained unharmed.</p><p>With one hand, he continuously waved his whisk, while with the other, his fingers spun like wheels, continuously changing hand seals.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Jiuhui Orb emitted seven different colored lights in succession.</p><p>The seven beams of treasure light, forceful and imposing, continuously bombarded the black and white qi. Finally, the seven lights merged into a seven-colored rainbow, striking the center of the black and white qi vortex.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The vortex suddenly solidified, and the black and white qi even showed signs of dissipation.</p><p>Seeing this, Xia Hou knew it was bad, roared loudly, spat out a mass of crimson energy, which instantly contracted, shooting out red lightning. With a 'crack,' it pierced through the air, striking the Jiuhui Orb.</p><p>Xia Hou's true form also reared up, his upper body standing erect, his aura surging, before he stomped heavily forward!</p><p>An astonishing pressure erupted, distorting the void, and a black shadow descended from the sky, a gigantic deer leg, crushing down with the force to tear through space.</p><p>It seemed as if he was about to be crushed to a pulp.</p><p>Hong Yuzi remained calm in the face of danger, a strange color flashing in his eyes.  He'd finally gotten his chance and quickly cast a secret incantation, his figure flickering, becoming gradually illusory like a shadow.</p><p>The next moment, Hong Yuzi froze, suddenly looking towards another battlefield, his expression surprised.</p><p>Xia Hou was entangled with him, equally restrained, leaving Mo Xingdao to face the other Yao Hou.</p><p>This Yao was a small realm stronger than Mo Xingdao.  Even if Mo Xingdao was outmatched, he should have been able to resist for a while.</p><p>Hong Yuzi had finally stabilized his position and was preparing a powerful combination attack, sending a message to Mo Xingdao to attack together. Once the technique was deployed, they had hoped to drive back the two Yao and escape the unfavorable situation.</p><p>Unbelievably, Mo Xingdao was incredibly weak, almost instantly killed by that Yao Hou!</p><p>This shows that the ambush was not accidental; the opponent certainly knew Mo Xingdao and his weaknesses.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's death put Hong Yuzi in a more precarious position, his expression grave.  Xia Hou also learned of the outcome on the other battlefield, receiving a message from the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>It stared at Hong Yuzi, its gaze flickering.  If it had brought a few helpers, it would have stayed to hunt Hong Yuzi down decisively!  But now it had to consider the cost of killing him, and whether it would affect obtaining the treasure.</p><p>Though Hong Yuzi was on the defensive, he still had the power to fight back.  His troops were only wounded; if Hong Yuzi sacrificed them to unleash a desperate technique, the power would be unpredictable.</p><p>Xia Hou didn't hesitate long before making a decision, ordering, "Form the array!"</p><p>A hint of disappointment flashed in Qinghu Saint King's eyes, but she didn't object, obeying Xia Hou without question.  She leaped towards the Moonlit Lake.</p><p>Midway, she transformed into a fox spirit, a celestial fox under the moon, her tail swaying gently, instantly splitting into four fox images.</p><p>Bathed in moonlight, the images, as lively as the real thing, descended onto the four celestial pillars, assuming a moon-worshipping posture, standing atop the pillars like statues.</p><p>After creating the images, Qinghu Saint King looked somewhat weakened. She urged, "Quickly!"</p><p>The divine deer, prepared beforehand, leaped and retreated, forcing out a ball of its essence blood, also dividing it into four parts, merging each into a celestial pillar.</p><p>Four crimson deer images appeared at the center of the pillars, forming a sealing array with the fox images.</p><p>Hong Yuzi's expression changed, sensing danger. He commanded the Nine Return Pearls and the black mountain to charge outwards, but it was too late.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The lake water surged, the Moonlit Lake descended, the sealing array fully formed, imprisoning Hong Yuzi within.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King descended gracefully.  Xia Hou also returned to human form, his face somewhat pale. The blood array had taken a toll on him, but compared to being injured, this cost was negligible.</p><p>The sealing array, formed by the two demons, couldn't inflict serious harm on the trapped enemy, but it was incredibly strong.  Furthermore, more and more figures were drawn to the demonic blood, rushing into the array, hindering Hong Yuzi's escape.</p><p>Hong Yuzi would be unable to break free for a while!</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Time was pressing. Xia Hou glanced at the array and immediately ordered Qinghu Saint King to lead the way.</p><p>The two quickly retreated, swiftly moving through the illusions, going deeper and deeper until they reached another illusion.</p><p>This illusion was peculiar, like a mirror, perfectly round, floating in mid-air.  Only a thin line could be seen from directly in front.  From above or below, the mirror and its reflection were visible.</p><p>The mirror's surface was extremely calm; they were very close, feeling no danger.</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>Qinghu Saint King pointed to the mirror.</p><p>Xia Hou surveyed the surroundings, frowning.  "Where's the hall you mentioned?"</p><p>Qinghu Saint King paused. "I need to see the Nine-Tailed Spirit Fox's sacred blood first."</p><p>"Do you still not trust this Marquis?"</p><p>Xia Hou snorted, shaking his sleeve, releasing a jade bottle which he held in his hand.</p><p>The jade bottle contained a crimson pill.  Upon closer inspection, it wasn't a pill, but blood that had coalesced into a sphere.</p><p>Even through the bottle, a faint, peculiar aura emanated. Sensing this, Qinghu Saint King's bloodline stirred with longing.</p><p>She gazed at the bottle, her eyes greedy.  Taking a deep breath, she said, "The hall is within the mirror!"</p><p>Speaking, Qinghu Saint King was the first to fly above the mirror's surface, lightly touching it with her toes, creating subtle ripples.</p><p>The next moment, an astonishing force erupted.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King, anticipating this, shifted her footwork, easily evading the force. When the ripples subsided slightly, she touched the mirror again.</p><p>The mirror seemed filled with chaotic forces, triggered repeatedly by Qinghu Saint King.  Patiently dodging, she persistently touched the mirror, eventually causing a different phenomenon.</p><p>This time, the center of the ripples, contrary to before, created suction. It seemed as if there was an unknown space within the mirror.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King nodded to Xia Hou, not dodging, letting the suction pull her into the mirror.</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes flashed, following Qinghu Saint King into the space within the mirror.</p><p>…</p><p>Before their arrival, Qin Sang and Mo Xingdao had already been to this place.</p><p>A spatial distortion caused the surrounding illusions to change. The last thing I saw in the mirror was an ancient palace, which emitted an incredibly strong suction force, instantly drawing in the Five Elements Crown," Mo Xingdao said, pointing at the mirror below him.</p><p>"How do we get in?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Mo Xingdao hesitated.  "When the palace gate was open years ago, I saw a strange rune. I've remembered it ever since.  I wonder if it's the key to opening this place…"</p><p>He had been unconscious and ended up in the hands of Hong Yuzi. This was his first time back.</p><p>Mo Xingdao approached the mirror, raised his hand, and drew the rune in mid-air.</p><p>Qin Sang also examined the mirror, awakening his Sky Eye Butterfly and activating his Sky Eye ability to try and find the pathways within the mirror.</p><p>However, before he could do much, Mo Xingdao finished drawing the rune and infused it into the mirror.  Ripples immediately spread across the surface.</p><p>The mirror then flickered, revealing a dark void, its depths filled with a powerful suction force.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed into the void. "Friend Mo, please transform back into a kingfisher."</p><p>Mo Xingdao, with only his Yuan Ying-stage strength remaining, couldn't help him; he needed protection instead.  If it weren't for needing Mo Xingdao to guide the way, it would have been best to leave him outside.</p><p>Mo Xingdao transformed into a kingfisher and landed on Qin Sang's shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Grey Warbler Sword, his body trembled, and he stepped into the void.</p><p>A sucking sensation enveloped him, and his descent accelerated sharply.</p><p>Qin Sang's skin shimmered with a pale gold light, resisting the suction as he slowly descended.</p><p>The deeper he fell, the stronger the suction became, eventually turning into a tearing force, intertwined with chaotic energy.</p><p>'Buzz...buzz...buzz...'</p><p>The sword hummed continuously as waves of sword energy slashed around Qin Sang, resisting the impact of the forces.</p><p>Sometimes Qin Sang had to evade the attacks, moving back and forth, but his descent remained relentless.</p><p>He continued to descend, following the pull of the suction.</p><p>Shortly afterward, the light and shadow shifted dramatically.</p><p>With a loud boom, Qin Sang felt as if he'd struck an invisible door, forcing it open.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's vision went black, nearly colliding with a tightly closed palace gate.</p><p>He managed to regain his balance, and upon looking around, a round, ancient palace came into view.</p><p>…</p><p>"This is the place!"</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King gently swayed her fox tail, a soft force enveloping her body.  She moved slightly to the side, stopping precisely in front of the palace gate.</p><p>Xia Hou followed closely behind, almost crashing into it.</p><p>A flash of annoyance crossed his eyes, but Xia Hou didn't argue with the Qinghu Saint King, instead focusing on the palace before them.</p><p>The mirror space was remarkably empty, with only this solitary palace suspended in mid-air.</p><p>Two black palace gates stood before them, firmly shut.</p><p>The palace was remarkably simple, lacking any ornate decoration.  Only two dragon-shaped patterns were carved onto the gates.</p><p>The strokes were quite rough; one might mistake them for crocodiles or pythons if not looking closely.</p><p>"The innate spiritual treasure is here?"</p><p>Xia Hou frowned. This palace didn't match his expectations; it didn't look like a place to store treasures.</p><p>"Indeed, but we must first open the gates," said the Qinghu Saint King, her gaze fixed on the two dragon patterns.  The danger lay within them.</p><p>She struck the gate with a palm strike. A roar that shook the very soul echoed out.</p><p>Black light erupted from the gate, and two black dragons burst forth, each with black scales, five claws, and horns. Majestic and imposing, they were vastly different from the carvings on the gate.</p><p>The black dragons possessed not only the form of true dragons but also their terrifying aura.  Under their gaze, both demons froze.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King had summoned a protective circle beforehand.</p><p>The circle expanded, instantly trapping one of the black dragons, but violent tremors immediately followed.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King retreated rapidly.</p><p>Xia Hou focused on the other black dragon, his eyes turning black and white, his Heavenly Eyes activated, locking onto the dragon with intense pressure.</p><p>The black dragon stiffened, its body sinking suddenly, roaring furiously in defiance.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the two demons working together could have subdued the dragons, but the powerful suction force in this place, laced with chaotic energy, hampered their movements.</p><p>"Open the gate!"</p><p>Xia Hou roared, spewing red lightning that struck the black dragon attacking the Qinghu Saint King, drawing both dragons toward him.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King seized the opportunity to escape, rushing to the gate without looking back, repeatedly striking it with her palms.</p><p>The gate remained unmoved.</p><p>Xia Hou fought both dragons alone, buying time for the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>"How much longer?"</p><p>Finally, Xia Hou, impatient, shouted angrily.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King's eyes flickered. "It's open!"</p><p>As soon as she spoke, the gate thundered open, accompanied by a deafening roar from behind.</p><p>Xia Hou's face lit up.  Black and white energy formed a vortex above his head, catching the two black dragons off guard, causing them to stumble.</p><p>Xia Hou seized the chance to escape, rushing toward the gate, deliberately keeping a step behind the Qinghu Saint King as he entered the palace.</p><p>The two black dragons chased after them but seemed restricted by some kind of prohibition; they dared not enter the palace, roaring outside before transforming back into the dragon patterns on the stone gate.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King stepped into the palace, stood firmly on the threshold, and pointed to the center of the palace. "The treasure is there!"</p><p>In the center of the palace, a faint, multicolored light shimmered, and at its heart, a magnificent crown floated.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King kept her promise, not vying for the treasure.  She turned to Xia Hou. "Give me the Sacred Blood!"</p><p>At that moment, an obscure fluctuation spread through her body, undetected even by Xia Hou.</p><p>After the Qinghu Saint King entered the palace, Xia Hou crossed the threshold, his eyes fixed on the Five Elements Crown, his face full of delight.</p><p>The moment he stepped into the palace, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The Five Elements Crown suddenly emitted a fierce light, instantly striking Xia Hou's face, too fast for him to react!</p>
