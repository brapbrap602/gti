<h1>Chapter 1403: Waiting</h1><p>"What are you looking for?"</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo retracted his gaze, falling on True Person Chijie.</p><p>True Person Chijie was stunned, only then realizing that Old Demon Hunmo was referring to the treasures hidden within the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo's eyes were cloudy and peaceful.</p><p>But for some reason, True Person Chijie felt a chill run down his spine, clenching his fist slightly, feeling the warmth of the Nine Rings Thumbs Ring (Nine Precepts Ring), and pondered, "This junior's greatest wish is to fulfill my master's last wish, to obtain the complete inheritance of the Pure Sea Sect, and to revitalize Buddhism. In addition, due to the nature of my cultivation method, this junior has never had a very satisfactory magical treasure and hopes to find one or two Buddhist treasures for protection..."</p><p>The implication being.</p><p>Apart from these two requests, everything else could be offered to Old Demon Hunmo.</p><p>After saying these words, True Person Chijie lowered his head slightly.</p><p>He had already made this decision when he decided to use the Hunmo Token.</p><p>Inviting other Daoists, although the conditions are not so harsh, they are probably not a match for Valley Master Mu and the others, and may not succeed at that time.</p><p>It is better to directly invite Old Demon Hunmo to take action to ensure everything is foolproof.</p><p>Even if he gets fewer treasures himself, it is better than ending up with nothing.</p><p>As long as he is honest and keeps his master's legacy alive, Old Demon Hunmo will not turn against him for these things.</p><p>After a moment, feeling Old Demon Hunmo's gaze move away from him, True Person Chijie's mind eased slightly, and he heard Old Demon Hunmo ask, "How many people are there, and what are their origins?"</p><p>True Person Chijie was overjoyed upon hearing this, knowing that Old Demon Hunmo had already agreed, and quickly said, "One is Qi Huanyu, who cultivates on Guiling Island in the southern part of the Emptyspirit Sea. This junior has a feud with him. The other female cultivator surnamed Wang is his concubine, and she only recently broke through to the nascent soul stage, so she is not a concern. The last one is a helper they invited from outside, who is in the middle nascent soul stage and has extraordinary skills, specializing in controlling insects. According to the information this junior has found, they may be from the Crescent Realm, the current valley master of Hundred Flowers Valley."</p><p>"Only three people?"</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo dismissed the thought, "Two early nascent soul cultivators and one middle nascent soul cultivator. The enemy is in the open, and you are in the shadows. Just find a helper, and with your understanding of the Pure Sea Sect, it shouldn't be difficult to do some things in secret, right?"</p><p>True Person Chijie said 'yes' and replied respectfully, "If it were just the three of them, this junior would not dare to disturb the senior's secluded cultivation. Unexpectedly, these people are not good at breaking the formation and are unwilling to give up. They don't know where they found another middle nascent soul stage helper. This person's origins are mysterious, and they have considerable means. It seems that they have made progress not long after arriving."</p><p>"Oh? Two middle nascent soul cultivators..."</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo became interested.</p><p>After carefully inquiring about Qin Sang's appearance, Old Demon Hunmo pondered for a moment, "Not those few troublesome old things! Take this old man over to take a look."</p><p>Hunmo Island is famous in the Boundless Sea, but Old Demon Hunmo has always been a lone wolf, more like a reclusive cultivator. He doesn't even have any nascent souls under his command.</p><p>However, based on the status of Hunmo Island alone, all forces in the Boundless Sea must give him face. If Old Demon Hunmo intends to find a helper, it is definitely not difficult.</p><p>Seeing that he seemed to be preparing to go alone, True Person Chijie hesitated for a moment, but did not ask any further questions, assuming that Old Demon Hunmo had enough confidence to deal with two middle nascent soul stage cultivators.</p><p>Before long, the two entered the Emptyspirit Sea.</p><p>They restrained their escape light, flying quietly along the sea surface, arriving at the place where True Person Chijie had hidden before.</p><p>True Person Chijie took out the yellow round pearl to observe.</p><p>He saw that on the edge of the formation, an altar suspended in the seawater was already seventy to eighty percent complete and about to take shape.</p><p>"What speed!"</p><p>True Person Chijie exclaimed softly.</p><p>These people are probably about to take action soon, and it may be too late to call for a helper now.</p><p>The altar was square, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom.</p><p>The entire altar was engraved with countless ghost-like patterns, and upon closer inspection, one could see that they were all kinds of spirit insects (spiritual bugs), some of which even True Person Chijie and Old Demon Hunmo had never heard of.</p><p>The scene in the pearl was blurry.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo took a glance and lost interest, flashing forward and approaching the formation.</p><p>Not far after escaping, Old Demon Hunmo suddenly let out a soft gasp, surprisingly stopping.</p><p>A gleam flashed through his cloudy eyes.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo ordered Chijie to hand over the pearl, and his gaze swept over Qin Sang and the other three, nodding with a half-smile, "A bit interesting."</p><p>After a pause, Old Demon Hunmo tapped his black bamboo staff, "The other party should have a clever secret technique for probing. If this old man wasn't always vigilant and had divine sense far surpassing you all, we might have already been exposed."</p><p>True Person Chijie was shocked upon hearing this, glad that he had been cautious enough, "What do we do now?"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo said lightly, "Do you really think the Pure Sea Sect is so easy to break into? Why not let the other party open the formation for us? We can also take a look at their abilities."</p><p>True Person Chijie was secretly surprised.</p><p>They, master and disciple, cultivated the Pure Sea Sect's cultivation method, but their knowledge of the Pure Sea Sect was very limited.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo seemed to know the Pure Sea Sect extremely well.</p><p>...</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu were refining the last part of the altar.</p><p>Amidst the busyness.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the Celestial Eye Butterfly in his qi sea gently flutter its wings, then quieted down again. Qin Sang distracted himself to sense it, but there was nothing unusual, and he comforted it.</p><p>Before uncovering the secret behind Hundred Flowers Valley, he must not expose the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>In the early hours of the third day.</p><p>The eastern Emptyspirit Sea was still dark.</p><p>The bright moon still hung high, scattering a cold moonlight on the sea surface.</p><p>The altar was finally refined!</p><p>As the last rune was engraved, the altar lit up with azure light, quickly running through its entire body. The entire altar's aura changed drastically, becoming a complete entity, like a bronze platform.</p><p>On the surface of the altar.</p><p>The patterns of the spirit insects were even more lifelike, giving the feeling that they could revive at any moment and crawl out from the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu smiled at each other, sitting cross-legged to adjust their breathing.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>The two woke up one after another. After discussing, they decided to immediately set up the insect formation to avoid any unforeseen events.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>In the past few days, Qin Sang had fed it a Fire Fusion Pill. Valley Master Mu was also generous, sending out a few bottles of elixirs that would help the spirit insect's cultivation, trying to improve the Fire Jade Centipede as much as possible.</p><p>Valley Master Mu also summoned his own spirit insects.</p><p>One was his natal spirit insect, the Tide-Drawing Horseshoe Crab of the early Fourth Transformation stage.</p><p>The other was the Black Demon Ant of the late Third Transformation stage.</p><p>The Tide-Drawing Horseshoe Crab was crab-like in shape, the size of Valley Master Mu's palm, and its whole body was blue like the sea water. One could even see the blue blood flowing inside its body.</p><p>A long sword-tail extended from its tail, which had been vibrating slightly with a mysterious rhythm.</p><p>Qin Sang knew very little about the Tide-Drawing Horseshoe Crab, but every spirit insect in the Fourth Transformation stage was not simple.</p><p>As for the Black Demon Ant, it was just an ordinary black ant in appearance, but it had a pair of bat-like mini wings. It was said that its natal divine ability had a certain restraining effect on demon cultivators.</p><p>With three spirit insects ready.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the Fire Jade Centipede, touched its back with his finger, and gently placed it on the altar.</p><p>Valley Master Mu also placed his spirit insects on it together, and he flashed to the middle of the three spirit insects, sat cross-legged, nodded to Qin Sang, and closed his eyes tightly.</p>
