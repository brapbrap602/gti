<h1></h1><p>After leaving the Water Mansion, Qin Sang wasted no time and swiftly fled overseas, distancing himself from the demon realm. He found a desolate island, where he set down the demon corpse.</p><p>Most of the essence of the Frogfish lay in its innate poisonous scales. Qin Sang held little hope, and after dissecting the demon corpse, he indeed found no trace of the so-called poison core.</p><p>Just then, the plump silkworm suddenly squeaked and jumped out, twisting its body as it burrowed into the Frogfish's lower jaw. It dragged out a small, transparent sac.</p><p>"Is this... a poison sac?" Qin Sang's heart stirred, but he did not stop the silkworm.</p><p>The plump silkworm glanced sideways at Qin Sang, and seeing his tacit approval, its squeaks grew more delighted. It spewed a multicolored halo, enveloping the poison sac, and swallowed it whole before darting back into Yagu's body.</p><p>Qin Sang watched this unfold, thinking to himself that this creature was indeed picky. During his travels in the demon realm, he had encountered several poisonous beasts, but the silkworm had shown no interest. Only the poison sac of this transformed great demon could captivate it.</p><p>The reason, he surmised, was not only the Frogfish's high cultivation level but also the fact that its innate abilities were entirely poison-related.</p><p>"After devouring the poison sac, I wonder if the plump silkworm can advance to its fourth transformation. Such poisonous beasts are rare even in the demon realm. I've heard of a Poison Cloud Steed, a general under the Nine-Headed Great Sage, who trains year-round in the Ten Thousand Demon Cave and rarely shows itself. It would be difficult to obtain its poison sac."</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang extracted the bones and skin from the Frogfish's remains, refining them into spiritual materials. He sorted and stored them in his Qianjun Ring before heading south.</p><p>This journey was also a return to familiar territory.</p><p>Qin Sang passed through Fengyang Mountain and re-entered the Crescent Moon Realm, but he did not disturb Master Feng or the others, choosing instead to travel discreetly.</p><p>From the demon realm to the Star Sand Archipelago and then to the Crescent Moon Realm, although he had not found any fragments of the Slaughter Sword, he had gained much knowledge and experience, making the effort worthwhile.</p><p>He leisurely made his way south, covertly approaching various sects in the Crescent Moon Realm. If no Slaughter Sword fragments were detected, he would leave without alerting anyone, ensuring minimal time was wasted.</p><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly, and before long, he arrived at one of the most perilous forbidden zones in the Crescent Moon Realm—the Bottomless Demon Cave!</p><p>Years ago, when Qin Sang was seeking materials to forge the Golden Sinking Sword, a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Crescent Moon Realm had offered to explore the Bottomless Demon Cave with him as a condition for obtaining the materials. However, Qin Sang had declined.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang had no intention of delving deep into the Bottomless Demon Cave either.</p><p>Although his strength had grown significantly, time was not on his side. He had to return to the Profound Heaven Palace before the Holy Land opened.</p><p>The exit of the Bottomless Demon Cave was surrounded by stone mountains, nestled between three peaks.</p><p>These three peaks were entirely composed of massive boulders, devoid of any greenery. The surrounding area for dozens of miles was equally desolate, devoid of life.</p><p>Standing at the entrance of the demon cave, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable chill. After a moment of contemplation, he summoned his spirit sword for protection and leaped inside.</p><p>Three days later, Qin Sang emerged from the demon cave.</p><p>The cave was indeed as the legends said—bottomless, with ancient restrictions layered throughout. Qin Sang cautiously ventured deep, reaching a point where even he felt danger. The sword spirit remained unresponsive, indicating a high likelihood that no Slaughter Sword fragments were present.</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley lay to the east of the Bottomless Demon Cave, on the other side of the Black Swamp.</p><p>Qin Sang traversed the Black Swamp and, following his memory, located the entrance to the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>To his surprise, the scenery had drastically changed. The vast miasma that once covered the area had dissipated, and the massive mountain range and Hundred Flowers Valley within had vanished.</p><p>The scene before him was no different from the rest of the Black Swamp.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he noticed something amiss. He awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Indeed, the true landscape of this place was concealed by a grand formation.</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley had gone to such lengths—had something significant happened recently, or had Valley Master Mu failed to escape the clutches of the Old Demon Hunmo as Qin Sang had speculated?</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly as he emerged from the shadows and approached the edge of the illusionary formation. He sent a streak of light into the formation.</p><p>Moments later, the miasma reappeared, rolling to the sides as a familiar voice emerged from within, "Daoist Mingyue, I've been waiting for you for a long time!"</p><p>"Valley Master Mu, it's been a while!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt slightly reassured and smiled as he looked into the miasma.</p><p>Valley Master Mu emerged from the miasma, personally welcoming him.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Valley Master Mu's slightly pale complexion and sensed that his aura was unstable, as if he was injured. He asked with concern, "Valley Master Mu, what happened?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu's tone was bitter, "You guessed correctly, Daoist. I was severely injured by the old demon and have yet to fully recover. My strength has been greatly affected."</p><p>As he spoke, Valley Master Mu invited Qin Sang into the formation.</p><p>The two flew towards the Hundred Flowers Valley while conversing.</p><p>Qin Sang observed Valley Master Mu, surprised that his injuries were so severe that they were evident even on the surface.</p><p>Valley Master Mu recounted the events in detail, "Fortunately, Daoist, you activated the power of the Thousand Buddha Wall at the last moment, delaying the Old Demon Hunmo. I seized the opportunity to catch my breath and escape the assault of that ghost spirit. Sadly, Fellow Daoists Qi and Wang were not so lucky. Not only were their physical bodies destroyed, but their Nascent Souls were also captured. The old demon even attempted to search their souls. Unable to bear their suffering, I desperately disrupted the old demon's soul-searching technique, resulting in the self-destruction of my Black Demon Ants and my own severe injury..."</p><p>After that, Valley Master Mu, knowing he was no longer capable of participating in the treasure hunt, withdrew from the Pure Sea Sect in despair. He took with him the descendants of Qi and Wang to prevent them from being slaughtered by the old demon in a fit of rage.</p><p>Upon returning to the Hundred Flowers Valley, he sealed the mountain and remained in seclusion ever since.</p><p>At this point, Valley Master Mu's expression darkened, and he said coldly, "Over the years, there have been frequent activities by unidentified individuals near the valley, spying on us."</p><p>"Is the old demon so brazen?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, realizing that the Old Demon Hunmo had not given up.</p><p>Valley Master Mu snorted, "In the Crescent Moon Realm, I naturally have no fear of this demon. If not for my injuries, I would have already confronted him! I've been worried that you, Daoist, might also fall victim to the old demon. Now that I see you unharmed, I can finally rest easy."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled inwardly, knowing that Valley Master Mu's true concern was the Ten Thousand Spirit Fruit.</p><p>He had come precisely for this matter and did not beat around the bush. He admitted that he had obtained the Ten Thousand Spirit Fruit under the guidance of the Fire Jade Centipede but concealed the true quantity, stating only that he had obtained four.</p><p>As for the Ten Thousand Spirit Fruit Tree and the events in the Buddha Hall, he made no mention.</p><p>Valley Master Mu neither confirmed nor denied, clearly not fully convinced but also not calling him out.</p><p>As they spoke, the two entered the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang saw many unfamiliar faces in the valley, all descendants of Qi and Wang.</p><p>Lan Jingsi, who had been in seclusion, also emerged from her cave to welcome Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a hidden eagerness in Lan Jingsi's gaze. Her innate insect gu was still at the peak of the third transformation, and she had been hesitant to attempt the fourth transformation, needing the Ten Thousand Spirit Fruit to increase her chances of success.</p><p>The three of them, each with their own thoughts, conversed amiably and entered a bamboo pavilion to sit down.</p><p>After the pleasantries, Qin Sang said, "I have come for two reasons. First, to visit Valley Master Mu, and second, to seek your assistance."</p><p>Valley Master Mu automatically ignored the first part, "Daoist, what difficulties do you face? Please speak freely. If it is within the capabilities of the Hundred Flowers Valley, my junior sister and I will do our utmost to help!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "If it were a trivial matter, I would not trouble you. My Fire Jade Centipede is about to face the challenge of the fourth transformation, as you both know. After learning of the Spirit Ascension Technique, I have been searching everywhere for spiritual materials, but they are exceedingly rare and difficult to obtain. I thought that the Hundred Flowers Valley must have some treasures stored away, so I came here to ask for your help."</p><p>Valley Master Mu, fully aware of the situation, put on a troubled expression, "This... the materials required for Spirit Ascension are extremely rare and are crucial to the inheritance of our valley. After generations of consumption, there are very few left. I'm afraid..."</p><p>"I see. I have been presumptuous!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed and immediately stood up, "Let us pretend I never mentioned this matter..."</p><p>"Daoist, wait!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu, caught off guard by Qin Sang's unconventional approach, quickly stood up and called out to him. Seeing the teasing look in Qin Sang's eyes, he felt a pang of shame and decided to drop the act, stating his terms directly, "I can provide you with a complete set of materials required for Spirit Ascension. However... I hope you can understand our difficulties. For the three most crucial materials, including the Primordial Yin Water, we would like to exchange them for three Ten Thousand Spirit Fruits. You would not be at a loss, and the rest of the materials would be my gift to you."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly, "I only have four Ten Thousand Spirit Fruits, and you are asking for the majority of them."</p><p>Valley Master Mu said seriously, "If it were already refined Spirit-Calming Incense, even if you offered more materials, I would not dare to hope for it. The Ten Thousand Spirit Fruit is merely one ingredient in the Spirit-Calming Incense, and its efficacy is limited. This price is already very fair."</p><p>Qin Sang did not agree.</p><p>By claiming to have four Ten Thousand Spirit Fruits instead of any other number, he was subtly indicating his bottom line.</p><p>He could part with three Ten Thousand Spirit Fruits, but Valley Master Mu would have to offer more in exchange.</p><p>"A complete set of materials, plus two additional portions of Netherworld Earth!" Qin Sang first raised one finger, then two.</p><p>"Why do you need so much Netherworld Earth?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu was prepared to bargain but did not expect Qin Sang's request to be so peculiar.</p><p>He exchanged a glance with Lan Jingsi and said after a moment of thought, "Daoist, you may not know this, but Netherworld Earth is an extremely rare material. Our founder once traveled throughout the North Sea and only managed to obtain a small piece from an ancient cultivator's cave. After generations of use by our predecessors, there is very little left, and we have never been able to replenish it. This has long been our greatest challenge. My junior sister and I must consider the future generations, so we can only offer you one more portion of Netherworld Earth."</p><p>Valley Master Mu's tone was firm.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell that there was no room for negotiation on this matter.</p><p>He pondered silently. He had requested three portions of Netherworld Earth in preparation for his three spirit insects.</p><p>However, the plump silkworm was not Qin Sang's spirit insect, and the chances of successfully ascending it were slim. Moreover, the silkworm was currently devouring the poison sac, and it might break through to the fourth transformation without needing the Spirit Ascension.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang no longer insisted and changed his condition, "I entered the path of insect taming late and have limited knowledge. I hope Valley Master Mu can offer some guidance."</p><p>"That is easily done!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu clapped his hands and laughed, readily agreeing.</p><p>Qin Sang also smiled and took out three jade boxes, placing them on the table.</p><p>Valley Master Mu gave Lan Jingsi a meaningful look, and they carefully inspected the Ten Thousand Spirit Fruits. Although the fruit skins were slightly dull and wrinkled, they were indeed genuine.</p><p>Lan Jingsi went to the treasury and returned shortly, handing Qin Sang a storage pouch.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully checked the contents and confirmed they were correct.</p><p>The Netherworld Earth turned out to be a grayish-white stone block, with nothing outwardly remarkable about it.</p><p>Both parties stored their respective treasures, each pleased with the exchange.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang planned to stay at the Hundred Flowers Valley for a while to learn more about insect taming.</p><p>Valley Master Mu hosted a grand banquet in Qin Sang's honor.</p><p>Amidst the clinking of cups, a disciple suddenly reported that a Golden Core cultivator had arrived outside the formation, claiming to be a disciple of the Old Demon Hunmo and requesting an audience with the valley master.</p><p>The lively atmosphere instantly turned icy.</p><p>Qin Sang twirled his wine cup, remaining silent.</p><p>Valley Master Mu pressed his hands on the table and angrily said, "The old demon is truly brazen! I did not deal with him before, and now he dares to come to my doorstep! Men, kill this person immediately and throw his body out to feed the poison insects!"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and said in a low voice, "Valley Master Mu, calm your anger. Even in war, envoys are not killed. Let us see what the Old Demon Hunmo wants."</p><p>The timing of the Old Demon Hunmo's envoy's arrival was suspicious—why now, when Qin Sang was present?</p><p>Valley Master Mu frowned and ordered the disciple, "The Daoist is right. Spare his life for now. Bring him in!"</p><p>Moments later, the disciple led a black-robed youth into the hall.</p><p>The black-robed youth, facing the three Nascent Soul cultivators who did not conceal their auras, remained composed and bowed, "Junior Yun Haifeng pays his respects to the three seniors."</p><p>"What is your relationship with the Old Demon Hunmo? Why have you come here?" Lan Jingsi asked.</p><p>"He is my grandmaster!"</p><p>The black-robed youth kept his head down, not daring to look up, "My grandmaster has sent me to deliver a letter of invitation, but it is not for the two seniors of the Hundred Flowers Valley. It is to be presented when the Hundred Flowers Valley opens its gates to welcome an esteemed guest."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Valley Master Mu and Lan Jingsi both turned to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo was likely targeting Qin Sang. Unable to find Qin Sang, he knew of Qin Sang's relationship with Valley Master Mu. Qin Sang also guessed this possibility, wondering what scheme the old demon was plotting.</p><p>During the Ten Thousand Demon Assembly, the old demon had pursued him across thousands of miles. Was he now seeking reconciliation?</p><p>"Where is the letter of invitation?"</p><p>The black-robed youth spoke with utmost respect, "Forgive my impertinence, but may I ask if you are the person my grandmaster met in the Buddha Hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "Indeed."</p><p>Receiving confirmation, the black-robed youth dared not ask further and immediately presented the letter of invitation, standing quietly to the side.</p><p>Under the curious gazes of Valley Master Mu and Lan Jingsi, Qin Sang unfolded the letter and read through it. His expression turned peculiar, and he remained silent.</p><p>"Is the old demon threatening you, Daoist?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu grew even more curious and sent a voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and directly handed the letter to Valley Master Mu.</p><p>Valley Master Mu read it and was momentarily stunned, finding it hard to believe, "The old demon wants to bury the hatchet with you and collaborate wholeheartedly?"</p><p>The contents of the letter were simple.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo claimed to greatly admire Qin Sang's abilities and stated that neither side had suffered irreparable losses, so there was no deep-seated enmity. He hoped to turn hostility into friendship.</p><p>Moreover, they had a common enemy, a powerful force that could serve as a foundation for their alliance.</p><p>The Old Demon Hunmo even admitted his own wrongdoing and offered treasures as an apology to resolve their grievances. He proposed collaborating on a grand endeavor.</p><p>If Qin Sang was interested, they could meet to discuss further, with Qin Sang choosing the location to demonstrate sincerity.</p><p>From the black-robed youth's words and the contents of the letter, Valley Master Mu deduced that Qin Sang and the Old Demon Hunmo had clashed in the Pure Sea Sect, resulting in a feud.</p><p>It seemed the Old Demon Hunmo had not gained the upper hand and now recognized Qin Sang as a peer, actively seeking reconciliation.</p><p>Furthermore, the only forces in the North Sea capable of forcing two top experts to unite against them were either the demon race or the Profound Heaven Palace. Valley Master Mu wondered what Qin Sang had done to provoke them!</p><p>Valley Master Mu's thoughts raced, deepening his understanding of Qin Sang's strength and solidifying his resolve to befriend him.</p><p>What intrigued him more, however, was the grand endeavor mentioned by the Old Demon Hunmo. But he also understood that such a venture was akin to making a pact with a tiger, fraught with great risk.</p><p>Valley Master Mu glanced at Qin Sang, curious about his decision.</p>
