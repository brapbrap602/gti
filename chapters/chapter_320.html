Chapter 313 Heavenly Alliance

"Junior Martial Brother Yu's effort is in my eyes, but unfortunately, fate is a matter of chance..."

Yu Yangzi had seen many cultivators at Xuanlan Pass. He spoke with Qin Sang in a very calm tone, "Most cultivators are like Junior Martial Brother Yu. The disciples of our sect are no different. Eventually, they must either understand that they have no hope in pursuing immortality and give up on their own, returning to serve minor duties in the sect or returning to their hometowns to start a family; some may even establish a business and become founders of a cultivating family affiliated with the sect. Otherwise, they cannot give up and spend their lives frequenting the ancient immortal battlefields in search of ephemeral opportunities, only to suddenly disappear one day. Only a very few succeed..."

Yu Yangzi suddenly laughed self-deprecatingly, "I have just taken one step further. Who am I to judge them? That's enough. Let's not talk about it anymore..."

The atmosphere suddenly became heavy, and the two lost their previous interest in talking. They remained silent and went to see Senior Martial Brother Qi.

At this moment, there was another person in the house.

His surname was Rong and he was also Senior Martial Brother Shaohua, with a cultivation at the late stage of Foundation Establishment; only slightly lower than Senior Martial Brother Qi.

This person had a square face and a tan complexion. He looked serious and stern. When Qin Sang and Yu Yangzi greeted him, he returned the greeting in a monotonous voice.

"You are here at a good time. Junior Martial Brother Rong just rushed over from the sect. The affairs of Xuanlan Pass will be managed by Junior Martial Brother Rong in the future."

Qi Yuanchou pointed at Qin Sang and the two and introduced them to the cultivator surnamed Rong one by one.

He then told Qin Sang and Yu Yangzi that he was going back to the sect. After that, any affairs could be discussed with the cultivator surnamed Rong.

Yu Yangzi had just received this news and was slightly surprised. Then, he suddenly thought of something and said in surprise and delight, "Senior Martial Brother Qi has sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough? Junior Martial Brother Qin has just broken through to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, and Senior Martial Brother Qi is about to break through to the Core Formation stage. Today is a day of double happiness!"

Qi Yuanchou laughed, "Junior Martial Brother Qin breaking through is indeed a happy event. However, I am not returning to the sect to break through but because I have other important matters."

Yu Yangzi asked with a slightly serious expression, "Senior Martial Brother Qi, did something happen in the sect?"

The relationship between these disciples and Mount Shaohua was like the relationship between branches and leaves and the trunk.

If the skin is gone, how can the hair still grow?

If something happened to Mount Shaohua, even if they could keep their lives, without the support of the sect they would become loose cultivators, and their path of cultivation would become much more difficult in the future.

At the very least, it would be impossible to occupy such a good cave mansion outside Xuanlan Pass.

Mount Shaohua had a Nascent Soul ancestor and several Core Formation uncles in seclusion. However, at this moment, Qi Yuanchou had been summoned back from thousands of miles away. It was hard for them not to think too much.

Qi Yuanchou shook his head and said, "Junior Martial Brothers, do not worry. Nothing has happened to the sect. With the ancestor and the great sect protection formation, the sect is as solid as a rock. It is just that there is a strange atmosphere in Tianduan Mountain and Yuncang Great Swamp. Master summoned me back to help investigate the matter."

"Tianduan Mountain and Yuncang Great Swamp..."

Yu Yangzi's expression suddenly lightened, and he said with hatred, "The people from the Heavenly Alliance have started again?"

Qi Yuanchou replied with an 'Mm', "The spiritual tide is approaching. Every time this happens, the Heavenly Alliance will stir. Whether they will make a move is still unknown. This is not only the responsibility of our Mount Shaohua but also the responsibility of the entire Xiaohan Region. However, Mount Shaohua is in a special location and will be the first to be affected. We must be careful. I will return and investigate. Once the news is confirmed, I will send a message to all the major sects to unite and fight the enemy. You must also make preparations in advance. If there is a major war, no cultivator in the Xiaohan Region will be able to stay out of it."

Qin Sang silently listened to Qi Yuanchou and Yu Yangzi's conversation. He also understood the general idea.

The Heavenly Alliance was another major force outside the Xiaohan Region. It bordered the Xiaohan Region, separated by the Tianduan Mountain and Yuncang Great Swamp. The two major chasms became the boundary between the two regions.

The Xiaohan Region and the Heavenly Alliance had been hostile to each other since ancient times. It was no exaggeration to call them sworn enemies. Qin Sang knew that the several major wars he had been involved in were mostly between the two regions.

At the most tragic moment, even half of the Xiaohan Region had fallen. The three forces of righteous, demonic, and devilish cultivators joined forces to expel the Heavenly Alliance.

However, the last war had already happened a long time ago. In the past thousand years, the Xiaohan Region had been very stable. There had been peace between the two sides and they maintained a tacit understanding.

Qin Sang's cultivation had been low before, and he had only focused on breaking through. There were so many high-level cultivators in the Xiaohan Region, and the sky falling was something that he did not need to worry about. Therefore, he had never understood it in detail.

He did not expect to encounter a war between two regions during his cultivation journey!

This made Qin Sang frown and worry.

He had experienced the war between mortals and some of the tragic scenes were still fresh in his mind. The war between cultivators would definitely be even more terrifying!

Once the war started, the situation would be like a mighty flood, rushing forward.

Only Nascent Soul Grandmasters at the top of the pyramid could withdraw at any time, and even Golden Core Venerables might be swept away by the waves.

These Foundation Establishment cultivators, let alone attempt to stop an unstoppable force, could only follow the trend and go with the flow.

There might be opportunities in this, but there were more dangers.

The scariest thing was that they had absolutely no control over their own future and fate!

Although he cultivated through killing, he didn't want to involve himself in a catastrophe like this.

The path he had chosen didn't require him to experience any epiphanies during such a catastrophe. He just had to cultivate honestly in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and he would be able to advance to the Half-step Nascent Soul realm steadily.

Thinking until this point, Qin Sang hastily inquired for more details.

"With the arrival of the spirit tide, we must leave people at the Seven Heroes Pass to resist the frenzied cloud beasts. If the Skymarch Alliance were to invade at this time, the Small Icesky would be attacked from the front and back, which would be the perfect opportunity for the Skymarch Alliance. Therefore, looking back on past events, every war has occurred during the arrival of a spirit tide."

Qi Yuanzhou sighed softly. "As for the reasons for the war, it's nothing more than a battle for cultivation resources. Although the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is dangerous, it's a land of treasures, which is monopolized by Small Icesky cultivators. Do you really think that others aren't envious? Moreover, in the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, there are also..."

Having said this, Qi Yuanzhou paused for a moment, and then changed the topic, saying, "You don't have to worry too much either. When the spirit tide last arrived, the Skymarch Alliance took some action, but before we could organize a counterattack, they had already retreated on their own. It seemed like a reluctant harassment, likely because the lesson they learned from that great battle a thousand years ago was great enough. This time is probably the same; they might not dare to act, but we still have to make the necessary precautions."

Then, Qi Yuanzhou gave a brief explanation and made some necessary arrangements.

Qin Sang still planned to return to the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm to cultivate, and declined Senior Brother Rong's request for him to stay at the Cranium Cliff Pass. After talking for a while, he left.

Qin Sang walked worriedly towards the Great Simplicity Pill Pavilion.

He also knew that with his weak strength, he wasn't able to change anything at all. No matter how the situation changed, he could only accept it. The only thing he could do was to raise his strength quickly.
