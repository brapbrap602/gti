<h1>Chapter 924: The Sword Wheel</h1><p>Chapter 924: The Sword Wheel</p><p>‘嗡！’</p><p>As the blood sword exploded,</p><p>a low hum of a sword came from the opposite side.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>The next moment, a brilliant sword light erupted.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure disappeared, replaced by countless sword lights and energy forming a sword wheel, like a full moon, blooming before the astonished gaze of the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had mastered the art of sword light division. However, due to his cultivation level, the number of sword lights he could produce was limited; most were actually disguised sword energy.</p><p>The sword lights and illusory sword energy, interwoven from the ebony sword, formed a dazzling sword wheel, making it hard to distinguish the real from the fake, but its momentum and power were certainly real!</p><p>After mastering sword light division, Qin Sang had attempted to comprehend the next sword dao realm – 'One Sword, One Formation', but he had been unsuccessful.</p><p>The texts he had gathered recorded that to achieve this realm, one must grasp an elusive 'momentum', understand true sword momentum and intent, to gather thousands of sword lights and spontaneously create a sword formation.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't find a way in, but he didn't give up. Recalling the sword techniques he learned on the Sword Path, he painstakingly devised a weaker version of the sword wheel, which only recently took its final form.</p><p>While far from a true sword formation, it was considered a powerful supernatural ability among Foundation Establishment cultivators. During his sparring with the Golden Core cultivator from the Corpse Sect in the Windsplit Islands, Qin Sang hadn't used the sword wheel; otherwise, he could have easily defeated him.</p><p>Its power would continue to increase once he comprehended the true meaning of sword momentum.</p><p>With Qin Sang's full power, the sword light surged like azure clouds, and the sword wheel shone like a bright moon, dazzling and unstoppable.</p><p>Wherever it passed, it seemed invincible, its momentum extremely frightening.</p><p>If anyone had seen this spectacular sight from a distance, they would have thought it was a Nascent Soul cultivator making a move. Little did they know, it was mostly for show.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang knew that the opponent's swordsmanship wasn't as terrifying as it appeared, but among Foundation Establishment cultivators, it was definitely top-tier.</p><p>Now, he truly felt the danger.</p><p>‘嗡嗡……’</p><p>A buzzing sound emanated from the young man surnamed Fang's body.  Purple threads suddenly appeared within his insect armor, instantly filling the entire armor, looking like it was made of purple crystals.</p><p>The buzzing sound became incredibly urgent, and a strong purple light suddenly erupted, engulfing the young man and quickly transforming into a huge beetle.</p><p>The beetle shone with purple light all over its body, with sharp spines on its back and claws sharp as knives, extremely fierce.</p><p>“This is the Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor…”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>He had been guessing what the young man surnamed Fang's soul insect was. Seeing the insect's true form, he realized it was the Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor, ranked tenth on the Witch Insect List.</p><p>This level of spirit insect was raised by witch clans. The young man surnamed Fang, being the eldest disciple of Black Serpent Mountain, having such a soul insect wasn't surprising.</p><p>The Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor's carapace was extremely hard. When transformed into armor, it was lauded as the most defensive spirit insect on the Witch Insect List, only slightly weaker than those rare insects.</p><p>Most preciously, cultivating the Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor was much easier than those rare insects.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang had invested countless efforts in the Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor, and it had reached the late third transformation stage. After using the secret technique to transform into armor, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle to penetrate the armor, let alone injure the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>No wonder he was still lively and kicking after being hit by the 《Slave Lightning Technique》; even with his precautions, the contribution of this armor couldn't be ignored.</p><p>After the Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor appeared, its claws retracted, forming a purple barrier, firmly protecting the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>At the same time, the young man frantically poured his true essence into the blood sword. The blood-colored sword energy grew stronger and stronger, as thick as a pillar, with blood-red light soaring into the sky, stabbing directly at the sword wheel.</p><p>‘砰！’</p><p>After a terrifying collision, visible shockwaves swept across in all directions. The ancient trees beneath them, which had stood for countless years, suffered, turning into dust.</p><p>In the center of the battlefield,</p><p>the sword wheel shone brightly like a real giant wheel, the blood-colored sword energy being shredded and broken.</p><p>The next moment, the sword wheel trembled violently, and the remaining sword light poured out.</p><p>The Purple Crystal Heavenly Armor phantom was engulfed by the sword light, only the sound of a violent storm could be heard, and there was no scream from the young man surnamed Fang. Qin Sang's eyes narrowed; his figure had already followed the sword wheel, and without hesitation, he struck decisively, pressing his hand towards the insect shadow.</p><p>‘轰！’</p><p>With a loud bang, a figure flew backwards, staggering, it was the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>A young man surnamed Fang looked rather disheveled, though he wasn't seriously injured.  The phantom image of his purple crystal armor was somewhat dissipated, and there were a few shallow, irregular marks on the insect armor itself.</p><p>His eyes were fierce. He opened his mouth to speak, but a scream cut him short.  He glanced and saw his junior disciple flung away by Qin Sang's avatar, then dragged off by a two-headed creature, losing an arm in the process.</p><p>This cultivator was merely at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  Against a late-Nascent Soul avatar and the two-headed beast, he was utterly defenseless, unable even to attempt an escape.</p><p>"Senior Brother, save me!"</p><p>The older cultivator cried out in anguish.</p><p>Fang's face flickered.  He gritted his teeth, tore his gaze away, and abruptly turned to flee. He knew his junior disciple wouldn't last long.  If he died, Fang would face the three masters alone.  Qin Sang's true form was already a match for him, and any further entanglement would likely be fatal.</p><p>However, just a few feet away, Fang's escape was blocked by Qin Sang.</p><p>His expression changed, and he instantly altered course, only to be intercepted again with ease.</p><p>After several attempts, Fang stopped, staring fixedly at Qin Sang, his face ashen, his heart filled with terror.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed was terrifying.</p><p>Though Fang wasn't skilled in escape techniques, as a peak Nascent Soul cultivator, he believed no one at his level could stop him.  Now, he knew better.  Even at the Nascent Soul stage, such speed was possible.</p><p>Escape was impossible unless he defeated Qin Sang.</p><p>And that was indeed the case.</p><p>After activating the Heavenly Demon Transformation, Qin Sang's speed was already exceptional among those of his cultivation level.  Coupled with the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, though not quite matching a Nascent Soul Master, the speed was close enough, far exceeding what Fang could achieve.</p><p>Otherwise, given Qin Sang's nature, he would have prepared a lightning strike spell and used it immediately.</p><p>Engaging Fang was a test of his own strength. It seemed his decades of cultivation hadn't been wasted.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Another cultivator's corpse, now desiccated, was flung away like a rag.</p><p>The two-headed creature blocked the other directions, supporting Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, his ebony sword in hand, once again closing in.  The whirling sword reappeared.</p><p>Seeing this, Fang understood that a peaceful resolution was unlikely.  He couldn't beg for mercy.  Only a desperate struggle remained.</p><p>Fang laughed wildly, his heart stirred.  His insect puppet, reacting to its master's mood, emitted a mournful ‘woo-woo’ sound.</p>
