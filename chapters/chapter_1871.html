<h1>Chapter 1862:  Summoning Soldiers</h1><p>Left Daoist and Sword Daoist knew each other, but Qin Sang felt a distance between himself and Left Daoist, preventing complete trust.  If Left Daoist's aim was to wear down Lingyou King and then seize the opportunity, it would require a desperate battle between Qin Sang and the King.  Even if he succeeded in killing Lingyou King, Qin Sang's condition would be precarious.  Facing Left Daoist alone, how could he protect himself if the Daoist had malicious intent?</p><p>Given the current situation, Qin Sang might have a chance to escape Lingyou King, making a risky gamble unnecessary.  However, being the weakest among the three, some things were beyond his control.  He needed to carefully consider how to maneuver between these two powerful figures and ensure his own safety.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, Left Daoist calmly said, “Such old demons are extremely cunning and cautious; any unusual activity will alert them. Unless meticulously planned, it's difficult to lure them into a trap.  Ultimately, a direct confrontation is necessary. You don't need to fight the demon king to the death. I will make some arrangements; just follow my instructions.”</p><p>Left Daoist seemed to have understood Qin Sang’s concerns and had no intention of using him as bait.  Qin Sang felt a slight relief.  He understood that while Left Daoist’s words held some truth, weakening Lingyou King further was certainly beneficial.  Left Daoist's choice not to employ the most reliable method clearly showed consideration for Qin Sang's concerns, signaling that he was not viewed as a pawn but a collaborator, a gesture of good faith.</p><p>Things are rarely perfect. Left Daoist clearly understood the art of compromise. Lingyou King had been pursuing Qin Sang, suffering some degree of depletion himself.  The priority now was to gain Qin Sang's trust. This proposal was one Qin Sang could not refuse.  Whether or not Lingyou King was ultimately killed, the immediate danger to Qin Sang would be resolved; it was a win-win situation.</p><p>After a pause, Left Daoist continued, "The Gui Fang Kingdom is a major threat to the Daoist sect; the Demon King has stained his hands with the blood of our brethren.  Daoist friend, if you help me eliminate this fiend, I will personally report your merits to the Daoist Court upon my return. When rewards are given, this fiend will be considered a true Demon King.  Whatever you request, the Daoist Court will do its utmost to fulfill…"</p><p>Qin Sang was moved by these words.  It was common knowledge that the Daoist Court always rewarded merit, regardless of background, and did so generously.  Qin Sang couldn't accurately gauge the extent of the merit for slaying a Demon King, but even a small fraction of the reward would be unimaginable to ordinary cultivators.</p><p>His cultivation of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* was already in its fifth stage, late-phase.  While his *Spirit Cultivation Sword Scripture* was at the eleventh layer, mid-phase, this battle would push him to the late phase in no time.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang needed to plan his breakthrough to the Void Refinement stage, a stage he knew almost nothing about, and he lacked a master to guide him.  This was a rare opportunity to connect with the Daoist Court and meet with a Grand Daoist, and even better if he could receive personal guidance. Furthermore, killing such a powerful enemy as Lingyou King would be invaluable in his future understanding of the Dao of Slaughter.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t think of a reason to refuse, though he maintained a necessary level of caution. After some thought, he agreed.</p><p>Upon receiving the response, Left Daoist fell silent. Qin Sang remained composed, focusing his mind on parrying Lingyou King’s relentless attacks. The subtle struggle continued.</p><p>Outside the Celestial Wall:</p><p>After securing Qin Sang's cooperation, Left Daoist turned his right palm, revealing a jade bowl in his palm. The bowl was flatter than ordinary bowls, made of black jade, exquisitely transparent.  The bowl was empty.</p><p>Holding the bowl in one hand, Left Daoist raised his other arm, shaking his sleeve.  Points of golden light flew out and fell into the bowl.  A tinkling sound followed as the golden light dispersed, revealing numerous soybeans.  These were rounder and fuller than ordinary soybeans, appearing to be coated with a layer of gold leaf, shining brightly. There were probably dozens of them.</p><p>Left Daoist held the bowl before him, gazing for a moment before gently shaking his wrist.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>A faint sound of water appeared.  Looking inside, the bowl was now filled with water. The soybeans soaked in the water, and with a series of tiny bubbles, the water was absorbed, the soybean skins cracked, seemingly sprouting in an instant.</p><p>However, the soybeans didn't sprout. Instead, a strange sight occurred. Each soybean grew limbs and a head. In a blink, half a bowl of soybeans had transformed into tiny golden figures, each wearing golden armor and wielding weapons, clearly miniature golden soldiers.</p><p>Left Daoist flicked his fingers, sending a divine talisman into the bowl, which split into streams of light and entered the foreheads of the golden figures.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The golden figures suddenly opened their eyes, shining with life, now fully animated.</p><p>A rustling sound arose as the tiny golden figures spontaneously arranged themselves in a square formation within the bowl, bowing uniformly to the Left Realist.</p><p>A fierce, suppressed aura emanated from them; no one dared to underestimate these miniature golden soldiers.</p><p>The Left Realist stroked his beard and smiled.  Though he didn't command an army, he was adept at animating and controlling spiritual beings—a master of the art of creating soldiers from beans!</p><p>“Be careful, friend!”</p><p>The Left Realist looked down, transmitting a warning to Qin Sang.  He inverted the jade bowl.</p><p>In the forest…</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  Suddenly abandoning his defensive stance, he charged forward.</p><p>Two long tendrils lashed out.  Seeing two streaks of white light crisscrossing before him, Qin Sang, despite their ferocious momentum, didn't dodge. He extended his hands, grasping for the white tendrils with his bare palms.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The tendrils were incredibly fast.</p><p>Using his Celestial Eye ability, Qin Sang precisely tracked their trajectory, lightning-fast seizing the tips of the tendrils.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The tendrils felt like smooth icicles in his grasp, offering little purchase.  A terrifying impact slammed into his palms.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, his arms burning with pain.  Ignoring the agony, he held on tight, his grip unwavering.</p><p>Seeing this unusual action, Ling You Wang’s heart leaped, a sudden unease washing over him.</p><p>Furthermore, Ling You Wang noticed the surrounding starlight had intensified.</p><p>Simultaneously with Qin Sang’s move, the stars shifted.  The center of the starry river was directly above Ling You Wang, causing the sword formation to undergo a dramatic transformation.</p><p>The sword array remained, but its range shrunk considerably. The starlight sharpened, the river of stars became denser, and the sword energy more concentrated!</p><p>The stars turned, their light reaching the heavens, like a fierce tiger poised to pounce. The formation's shifts were unpredictable.</p><p>At the same time…</p><p>Points of golden light pierced the celestial barrier. Initially no bigger than beans, they rapidly expanded as they plummeted.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Ling You Wang roared.</p><p>The black fish apparition violently shook its head, its long tendrils flashing blinding white light, their tips erupting with terrifying force.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt his fingers nearly snap.  He held on for only a moment before the tendrils broke free.  His eyes blazing, he materialized a blood-red sword in his right palm and struck one of the tendrils.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Though the tendril didn't break, it was flung far away.</p><p>Ling You Wang couldn't ignore the force of the blow; his fish body tilted.  He didn’t retaliate, but instead lashed his tail and surged towards the starry river.</p><p>At that moment, the Sea-Swallowing Clam appeared within the starry river, transforming into a colossal creature capable of swallowing the heavens. The water within its shell had vanished. Its shell gaped open, aimed at the Zui constellation of the Seven Mansions.</p><p>The clam's shell obscured a large portion of the starry river, capable of swallowing all the stars within the constellation in a single gulp.</p><p>Just then, the Left Realist passed through the celestial barrier, strolling leisurely into the forest. He gently lowered his hand, releasing a wooden bead.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The bead fell into the starry river, easily penetrating the sword formation.  In a flash, it appeared at the opening of the clam shell.</p><p>The Sea-Swallowing Clam’s closing motion abruptly stopped; its suction force faltered. The wooden bead was firmly wedged between its shells, immovable.</p><p>With the clam restrained, the two tendrils sprang up, lashing toward the starry river.  But the Yunyou Sword was a spiritual treasure; even if the sword formation couldn't completely withstand the attack, it wouldn't be easily broken.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He propelled himself forward, his phoenix wings beating rapidly, fiercely charging towards the black fish apparition.</p><p>Since the start of the fight with Ling You Wang, Qin Sang had rarely taken the initiative. Now, his massive spiritual wood body leaped high, arms outstretched, embracing the fish's tail in a bear hug.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>Ling You Wang roared in fury.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang…’</p><p>The fish tail thrashed wildly in his embrace.  Each twist felt like a brutal whiplash, dislocating Qin Sang's bones, causing excruciating pain. The glow of the Mingshan Armor flickered, seemingly strained to its limit.</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p>Ignoring his injuries, Qin Sang strained every muscle, attempting to drag the black fish apparition to the ground.</p><p>At that moment, the sword stars shifted. The White Tiger Demonic Beast materialized, diving down, its ferocity palpable.</p><p>The White Tiger Demonic Beast slammed into the two tendrils. A tremendous roar echoed through the heavens.</p><p>The tendrils swayed, and a spiritual sword shot forth from the White Tiger Demonic Beast's forehead, piercing between the two tendrils.  In an instant, the sword light blazed, seven ethereal shadows flashing before merging with the light, swiftly slicing towards the black fish apparition!</p><p>This sword strike utilized the even more lethal Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.</p><p>Even with Ling You Wang's formidable strength, he dared not underestimate this sword;  Ding Xiang Hou had almost perished by it!</p><p>Ling You Wang's rage was immense, but he could only suppress it, hastily retracting his long whiskers. The white light separated, reforming into a thin white cord, its ends joining to form a white ring.</p><p>The ring, seemingly carved from jade, shielded Ling You Wang above. Still uneasy, he spat out a scale-like artifact, sending it towards the ring's center.</p><p>Looking down at Qin Sang, who relentlessly attacked, Ling You Wang's eyes burned with fury, threatening to incinerate him. With a roar, he twisted his upper body and lunged at Qin Sang, his fangs rapidly enlarging in Qin Sang's sight.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Two enormous monsters entangled, crashing into the earth and tearing it apart, creating a network of fissures.</p><p>In the air, the sword light struck the white ring; white and sword light merged, erupting in a blinding flash.</p><p>The white ring trembled, its ends separating and falling like a writhing serpent.</p><p>Yun You Sword paused slightly, then struck again!</p><p>Just as Qin Sang desperately grappled with Ling You Wang, a tearing sound echoed through the forest.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>Golden light descended from the heavens, its momentum immense, like falling meteors.  The earth roared.</p><p>The golden light slammed into the ground, causing the forest to tremble violently. Dozens of large craters appeared.</p><p>Golden light shone within the craters, and golden armored warriors leaped out, no longer tiny, but towering thirty feet tall, magnificent and imposing.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The golden armored warriors landed around the battlefield.</p><p>All the warriors wielded identical weapons: golden iron chains.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren descended slowly, his feet on a platform, the Nine Heavens Military Talismans within it shining brightly.  He formed a sword gesture, two fingers pinching a yellow talisman, drawing power from the Nine Heavens Military Talismans and flinging it downwards, commanding: "Form the array!"</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>The golden armored warriors roared in unison.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The iron chains connected, the golden armored warriors forming a three-layered iron chain array, encircling the entangled combatants.</p><p>Because of Qin Sang, Ling You Wang failed to escape the encirclement, watching helplessly as the golden armored warriors formed their formation.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The yellow talisman floated into the array.</p><p>The golden armored warriors spun rapidly, their forms soon indistinguishable.  Three golden circles appeared on the ground, then, as the golden light intensified, the circles connected.</p><p>In an instant, a golden Bagua array materialized on the ground.</p><p>Within the array, Qin Sang, having endured a blow from Ling You Wang, retreated a few steps, quickly absorbing wood spirit energy to recover.</p><p>The situation had reversed; Ling You Wang no longer had the leisure to manipulate the wood spirit energy.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Ling You Wang glared at Zuo Zhenren in the sky, clearly recognizing him.</p><p>"Old monster, long time no see?"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren smiled faintly. "It seems fate has brought us together.  … I was delayed, missing a great opportunity.  Eliminating an old demon like you is not a wasted trip."</p><p>"Old man, you dare act without authorization!  Are you not afraid of jeopardizing the Heavenly Court, destroying our lineage, and allowing the human race to become food for our demonic kin!?"</p><p>Ling You Wang's voice was chilling, but his mind was tense. He hadn't expected a Grand Master to be here. His daring disregard for the Heavenly Court conflict in his search for treasure hinted at something more.</p><p>Logically, the Heavenly Court conflict was a matter of life and death for the Daoist sect and Gui Fang, leaving neither side any room for retreat—only death!</p><p>His current predicament was dire. Zuo Fengdao alone was enough to make him cautious, and coupled with Qin Sang, who was slightly weaker but held a geographical advantage, Ling You Wang felt a sudden unease.</p><p>These words seemed to strike a nerve with Zuo Zhenren.  His eyes flashed with killing intent, and he said coldly: "I will send you to the Netherworld first, and let you see which lineage is truly destroyed!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Zuo Zhenren took a step, chanting an incantation.</p><p>"Northern Yin Emperor, command the Nine Netherworlds.</p><p>Summon the prison guards, to capture and punish the evil.</p><p>Following the Imperial Decree, to examine and judge wickedness.</p><p>Millions of troops, to dismember and reshape.</p><p>Quickly!"</p><p>While chanting, he used his joined fingers to draw in the air, completing three incredibly complex talismans in one breath.</p><p>The three talismans shone with different colors—black, green, and gold.</p><p>The talismanic light rained down upon the earth.</p><p>Empowered by the talismanic power, the golden armored warriors’ momentum surged, transforming into veritable divine generals, appearing to subdue evil.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Dozens of golden chains shot through the air, all aimed at Ling You Wang within the array. The chains resembled the soul-reaping chains of prison guards, not only incredibly strong but also imbued with strange power, capable of capturing souls, suppressing and subduing demons.</p><p>Ling You Wang felt a terrifying pressure descend, as if several mountains were pressing down on his heart.</p><p>Unrestricted, Qin Sang finally unleashed his full potential, absorbing wood spirit energy at will. After a brief recovery, he charged at Ling You Wang again.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Each step Qin Sang took caused the earth to tremble, as if venting his pent-up frustration from the previous beating.  His momentum continued to build.  Reaching Ling You Wang, he formed a palm strike, a dazzling Buddha light appearing in his palm.</p><p>In a blink, the Buddha light condensed into a huge Buddha seal, containing astounding vital energy.  With Qin Sang's palm, it smashed down.</p><p>Above, the wooden bead continued its battle with the Sea Swallowing Clam.</p><p>Ling You Wang tried several times, but could not force the wooden bead back.  He couldn't retrieve the Sea Swallowing Clam in time, as the attack arrived!</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
