<h1>Chapter 523: Success</h1><p>Chapter 523: Success</p><p>Soon after.</p><p>Shi Ying regained her composure and cut another strand of Qingyang Divine Energy, sending it into Qin Sang's energy sea.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang's strategy changed. He tried to use his spiritual energy to mask the aura of the Earthly Fiend Qi. Though he still failed, the situation was much better than before.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shi Ying were less tense, calmly accepting the failure, and continuing to try after recovering their breath.</p><p>Soon, the Qingyang Divine Energy Shi Ying had gathered was exhausted.</p><p>A whole night passed.</p><p>Shi Ying had gone to Divine Energy Peak twice more, yet hadn't even attempted a Core Refinement using the fiend energy, because to do so, she first had to allow the Qingyang Divine Energy and Earthly Fiend Qi to coexist in her energy sea, then together impact the Golden Core.</p><p>After Shi Ying meditated to recover, she left the cave and returned to Divine Energy Peak.</p><p>After she left, Qin Sang opened his eyes.</p><p>That night, besides trying the secret technique and making adjustments repeatedly, he listened to Shi Ying recount her story.</p><p>Shi Ying's real name was Lan Ying. Her parents were originally independent cultivators, but their cultivation was not low.  Shi Ying's father came from a cultivation family, though the family had fallen from grace, their resources were still far more substantial than the average cultivator. Both parents successfully built their foundations.</p><p>After Shi Ying was born, she was found to have insufficient innate energy.  Examination revealed a hidden illness that would worsen with age.</p><p>Her parents learned of a spiritual herb in the second level of the Boundless Valley that could cure her.  Shortly after her birth, they entrusted a friend with Shi Ying's care while they went to gather the herb.</p><p>However, they never returned, both dying in the Boundless Valley.</p><p>Their friend, realizing something was wrong, immediately took Shi Ying far away, changing their identities, and adopting her as a foster daughter, changing her surname to Shi.</p><p>Shi Ying's foster mother treated her like her own daughter, and at great risk, entered the Boundless Valley to obtain the necessary herb for Shi Ying’s treatment.  She also investigated the murderers, finding them to be Wen Yanjie, who had accompanied Shi Ying's parents to the Boundless Valley.</p><p>This man coveted the Lan family's heirloom artifact and plotted to murder the couple.</p><p>Although the Qingyang Demon Sect carried the name of a demonic sect, its disciples were not inherently cruel; the Lan couple were unsuspecting of Wen Yanjie, resulting in their deaths.</p><p>After discovering the truth, Shi Ying's foster mother tried to avenge them, but failed in her assassination attempt and also died at Wen Yanjie's hands.</p><p>The revenge Shi Ying spoke of included not only her biological parents, but also her nurturing foster mother.</p><p>By that point, Shi Ying had already been sent to the Qingyang Demon Sect by her foster mother.</p><p>From the moment she entered at the age of twelve, Shi Ying’s heart held only revenge.  Yet she could only helplessly watch as her enemy thrived on murder and plunder, his cultivation soaring.</p><p>As the saying goes, 'those who kill and set fire amass wealth.'</p><p>The gap between the two grew ever wider, a chasm!</p><p>Shi Ying experienced immense despair and pain, with nowhere to vent it.  During a visit to her parents' and foster mother's graves, she wept bitterly.</p><p>If not for this tragedy, Shi Ying would likely have been a very sociable person; her true nature had been suppressed by her deep-seated hatred.</p><p>…</p><p>The stone door was pushed open from the outside; Shi Ying returned.</p><p>She was much faster this time, successfully collecting a strand of Qingyang Divine Energy in less than a quarter of an hour.</p><p>"Going to Divine Energy Peak four times in less than a day; if my uncle finds out, he'll surely suspect me…"</p><p>Shi Ying looked anxious. Cultivating the Qingyang Demon Fire didn't require such frequent trips into the mountains.</p><p>The reason for her risk was that she'd noticed the time taken seemed to increase each time, and the situation gradually improved, suggesting success might be within reach.</p><p>However, if she failed again, she would have to wait two days before trying again.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang showed no anxiety; he had a lead, and was confident that the two energies could coexist. Now it depended on whether his concept of Core Refinement was feasible.</p><p>One person and one corpse sat facing each other.</p><p>The Qingyang Divine Energy entered her body.</p><p>The moment Shi Ying withdrew the Qingyang Demon Fire, Qin Sang used all his strength to seal the aura of the Earthly Fiend Qi, simultaneously releasing a roughly equal amount of Earthly Fiend Qi, controlling it to surge towards the Golden Core.</p><p>This wasn't solely Qin Sang's action, it was also guided by Shi Ying’s intent.</p><p>The reason for the delay was that Qin Sang had been skillfully guiding the process, patiently showing signs of improvement, subtly 'guiding' Shi Ying toward the right path.</p><p>Before confirming the outcome, he didn't want to reveal himself; thus he couldn't let Shi Ying feel the slightest dissonance.</p><p>From Shi Ying's perspective, she was in control. In reality, she was under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>The Earthly Fiend Qi appeared, immediately sensed by the Qingyang Divine Energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's Qingyang Divine Force, like a striking serpent, pursued the Earthly煞 energy.  Both approached the Golden Core, nearing a collision.  At this critical moment, Qin Sang channeled his spiritual energy, enveloping both forces.</p><p>A breath was held.</p><p>The conflict continued, but Qin Sang, at great spiritual cost, delayed the explosion.  He then propelled the combined energies towards the Golden Core.</p><p>The Earthly煞 energy, enhanced by the Qingyang Divine Force, proved far more destructive. The Golden Core, though powerful, was unowned.  Qin Sang, having concentrated the forces to their peak, breached the Core's defenses, making contact.</p><p>A resounding boom echoed.</p><p>The Qi Sea violently convulsed!</p><p>Shi Ying’s face turned pale. Her consciousness was instantly shattered by the immense waves of energy.  Without hesitation, she regained control of her Corpse, focusing on calming its Qi Sea, anxiously awaiting the outcome.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Shi Ying, a transparent spiritual sword silently materialized above the Golden Core.  The sword energy, concentrated into a beam, enveloped the Core.  Remembering the lesson from refining the Flying Night Rakshasa, Qin Sang summoned the ebony sword, adding another layer of protection, regardless of its effectiveness.</p><p>The Earthly煞 energy, the Qingyang Divine Force, and the Golden Core—three formidable powers clashed on the Core as a battlefield, releasing astonishing fluctuations.</p><p>However, these fluctuations were as fleeting as they were intense.  The Earthly煞 energy and the Qingyang Divine Force, minuscule compared to the Golden Core, quickly dissipated.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the turmoil subsided, and the Golden Core and Qi Sea returned to normal.</p><p>Shi Ying gasped for air.  Seeing Qin Sang's Qi Sea stabilize, her anxiety eased.  Carefully examining the Golden Core, she found no abnormalities, a wave of disappointment washing over her. After a brief rest, she renewed her attempts.</p><p>A third time…</p><p>A fourth time…</p><p>The Qingyang Divine Force was depleted. Shi Ying sighed deeply and entered meditation.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang opened his eyes, black pupils gleaming with intense light, and vanished.</p><p>The next instant, he appeared silently behind Shi Ying, touching her with a restraining enchantment.</p><p>Shi Ying collapsed, and Qin Sang gently helped her to bed.</p><p>Standing, he gazed towards Divine Force Peak, a faint smile gracing his lips.  He had finally glimpsed the signs of success!</p>
