<h1>Chapter 1706: Hunting the Beast</h1><p>The journey continued across the Western Desert.</p><p>Then, teleportation to the North Sea.</p><p>Entering the storm zone.</p><p>The hurricane howled, figures hurtling through the tempest.</p><p>Shortly after, a golden light approached, revealing a serenely majestic monk who bowed to Hui Guang and the others.</p><p>“Xing Zhi, how is the beast-luring going?” Hui Guang asked.</p><p>“Reporting to Master Uncle, good news keeps coming from the front. The lures set by the various sects have all been effective, with no casualties so far. However, no one dares approach the beast, and its power remains unknown…”</p><p>Xing Zhi reported the situation in detail.</p><p>Hui Guang nodded, glancing at the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>“Old monk, set up the formation here and make sure there are no mistakes. This battle can only be won, not lost!”  Qinghu Saint King stepped forward, vanishing into the heart of the storm in an instant.</p><p>The others followed Hui Guang, seeing five towering pillars rising straight from the sea in the distance.</p><p>There were no islands at the base of the pillars, their foundation a mystery.  A cultivator sat atop each pillar.</p><p>The pillars were made of extraordinary materials, forged jointly by humans and demons.  Five identical pillars and a group of guards stood in the south, but they weren't needed for now.</p><p>Before reaching them, Hua Shen discerned something, “The Golden Rainbow Array, the Earth-Breath Array… all common five-element formations in the cultivation world.”</p><p>Hua Shen couldn't help but think of the Five Element Divine Prohibition on Emperor's Mandate Mountain.  These formations lacked the mystical power of the Divine Prohibition, but they were superior in being manned and more flexible, plus the arrangers were all experts.</p><p>Hui Guang made the arrangements, with the main arrangers of the five-element formations all being Buddhist monks.</p><p>Additional arrays with different functions were deployed around the perimeter, creating a comprehensive net.</p><p>The formations were quickly deployed.</p><p>More experts arrived, following the Buddhist arrangements, either staying on the outer perimeter (reducing the pressure), or choosing to enter the five-element arrays to experience the beast's power firsthand.</p><p>Hua Shen chose to remain outside, but saw Mo Xing Dao summoned into the five-element array by Hui Guang.</p><p>“This monk and the Saint King must control the five elements and the Five Element Crown, leaving us little room to maneuver. When the beast appears, we'll need your help, Daoist friend, to use the puppet to lure the beast into the trap,” Hui Guang instructed Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>With many cultivators assisting, several main arrangers, Buddhist monks, were able to share the burden, allowing two Nascent Soul cultivators to operate the Five Element Crown. Thus, Mo Xing Dao would be free to act.</p><p>This was different from the hunting operation at the Eight Views. This time, the lure had to constantly engage and adjust with the beast. Others would only act once the beast was drawn to the convergence point of the great array's energy, leaving no room for error. Only then could they succeed. Besides the two Nascent Soul cultivators, only a puppet proficient in Yin-Yang Escape techniques could accomplish this.</p><p>The trap was set, and everyone waited intently for the beast's arrival.</p><p>Unnoticed, someone quietly approached.</p><p>Qin Sang, light as a swallow, bobbed on the surface of the water, maintaining a safe distance and gazing into the distance.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, Qin Sang closed her eyes, remaining still.</p><p>Days turned into weeks, and a whole month passed without the beast appearing.</p><p>As everyone began to speculate and worry about unforeseen complications, Qinghu Saint King finally returned.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>A blue shadow cut through the waves, rushing into the formation.</p><p>Qinghu Saint King said gravely, “Be careful, the beast's cultivation might be higher than early Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Hui Guang and Mo Xing Dao's expressions turned serious upon hearing this, but they showed no sign of retreat.</p><p>No matter how strong the beast was, they had to face it head-on. No one knew when the next beast would arrive, and they couldn't afford to wait any longer.</p><p>“Daoist Mo…”</p><p>Hui Guang looked over, and Mo Xing Dao nodded. He listened to Qinghu Saint King's description of the beast's abilities, then flew out of the array alone towards the direction indicated by Qinghu Saint King, followed by a shadow.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>The fierce wind and waves relentlessly battered the pillars, causing them to slowly sink into the ocean.</p><p>Everyone looked up into the heart of the storm, their hearts pounding.</p><p>Suddenly, a roar like a thunderbolt shook the heavens and earth. Judging from the sound, the beast was still some distance away.</p><p>But the pressure from the roar pierced through the storm and the water, causing everyone to feel an immense oppression. Many showed expressions of terror, witnessing such a terrifying beast for the first time in their lives.</p><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>Each roar was closer than the last.</p><p>Soon, cultivators skilled in spiritual sight saw something unusual.</p><p>The waves surged in the distance, and a gigantic figure appeared in the storm.</p><p>The assembled group included not only human cultivators but also demon kings.  Seeing the beast's enormous body, they all recalled the famed Dragon Whale Great Saint of the East Sea.</p><p>The Dragon Whale Sage, possessing the bloodline of a dragon whale, is hailed as the greatest sage among the demon tribe.  Independent of the Saint King's Palace, his true form is that of a colossal dragon whale, whose size surpasses all others in the East Sea. Yet, compared to the monstrous beast before them, even he appeared small and delicate.</p><p>A wall of water advanced with terrifying speed, the sea behind it shrouded in impenetrable darkness.</p><p>The darkness was the beast's body—a creature resembling a manta ray, its immense fleshy wings extending endlessly. A single flap sent mountainous waves crashing down, a spectacle that threatened to shatter the very heavens, chilling all who witnessed it.</p><p>Before the beast, a figure flickered in and out of sight.</p><p>In the face of such a powerful foe, this figure was insignificantly small; a single wave from the beast would be enough to obliterate him.  Yet, he was incredibly tenacious, vanishing into thin air just as an attack landed, only to reappear before the beast once more.</p><p>Enraged by this elusive insect, the beast pursued it relentlessly.</p><p>“Activate the formation!”</p><p>Everyone received the reminder from the Hui Guang Sage simultaneously.</p><p>Huan Shen, his gaze darkening, looked towards the beast, sensing a pressure far greater than the one he had encountered before.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The figure, luring the beast, reappeared, incredibly close to the array, darting through a gap deliberately left open.</p><p>Just as the puppet charged forward, it was suddenly enveloped in shadow.</p><p>All eyes lifted in alarm; the monstrous beast had flown into the air, its wings like descending clouds. Its left wing, bearing an immense wind pressure, targeted the puppet, delivering a devastating blow.</p><p>This was no ordinary wind pressure; it was a force of nature. Anyone else would have been rendered helpless, but once again, the puppet vanished.</p><p>The instant the puppet disappeared, a five-colored crown materialized above the beast.</p><p>The size difference was immense, but the crown’s aura was in no way inferior.</p><p>The Hui Guang Sage and the Qinghu Saint King stood on either side of the crown. Five celestial pillars simultaneously erupted from the sea, forming a five-element array, each element displaying a distinct phenomenon.  These phenomena, though distinct, were interconnected by the five-colored crown, forming a massive, sky-obscuring canopy above the beast.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The five-element crown erupted in a radiant light, similar to before but far more potent.</p><p>The opposing five-element energies—one for restraint, the other for annihilation.  The ancient demon, intent only on killing, had only used annihilation, while this time, the primary goal was to restrain the beast.</p><p>Five-colored light instantly enveloped the beast, its black body becoming a kaleidoscope of colors.  The light constricted layer upon layer, like successive cages.</p><p>Simultaneously, a piercing sound filled the air, as countless iron chains, like writhing dragons, shot into the formation. The chains interconnected, crisscrossing and binding the beast, adding to its confinement.</p><p>Huan Shen was one of those manipulating the chains.</p><p>Numerous other phenomena unfolded in a coordinated manner, sealing off this area and the monstrous beast within.</p><p>Anyone who knew the entire trap beforehand would have deemed it unbreakable.</p><p>Then, they witnessed something astonishing.</p><p>The cage barely formed when the beast roared like thunder.  Vast waves surged skyward, like a great river bursting its banks, a force capable of shaking the heavens.</p><p>‘Bang bang bang…’</p><p>Over half the chains snapped, the celestial pillars swayed, and though the five-element crown remained relatively stable, the two transcendent cultivators visibly reeled.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao appeared in the distance, still shaken by what he’d witnessed.</p><p>Several times during the beast’s lure, he had faced near-death experiences, exhausting all the treasures the two transcendent cultivators had given him.</p><p>He consumed several pills, rapidly recovering, and flew towards the battlefield.</p><p>As he was about to join the formation, he received a transmission: “Friend Mo, do you have the Spiritual Rhinoceros Fruit with you?”</p><p>It was Qin Sang, seeing an opportune moment for their trade!</p><p>Mo Xing Dao paused, his eyes flickering in surprise, “Friend Daoist has the Five Element Pills?”</p><p>After a brief exchange, Mo Xing Dao remained on the outer edges of the battlefield, remotely controlling the puppet to assist the others.</p><p>The clash had reached its most intense point.</p><p>The beast unleashed its full power, but the carefully laid trap, backed by transcendent cultivators, was not easily breached.</p><p>Initially chaotic, they gradually grasped the beast's attack patterns and adapted.</p><p>Chains tightened, snapped, and repeated countless times, while the transcendent cultivators manipulating them were heavily taxed.</p><p>“Prepare to combine the arrays!”</p><p>The Hui Guang Sage’s voice was heavy, this was the deciding step.  If successful, there was a 50% chance of capturing the beast.  Of course, this combination held its own dangers.</p><p>Liu Daoyou…”</p><p>Huasheng looked at a tall, thin Daoist beside him. This person was an elder of the Qiongying Sect, rumored to be from an overseas immortal island.</p><p>The Liu surname cultivator understood and took over controlling the iron chain from Huasheng. Similar rotations were happening elsewhere.</p><p>Those relieved of their duties retreated to rest, but Huasheng retreated again and again, then turned and fled into the heart of the storm, disappearing without a trace. Those who noticed his actions were dumbfounded.</p><p>Even though it was a crucial moment for the combined formation, the Qinghu Saint King glanced over, a look of disdain flashing in her eyes, too lazy to bother.</p><p>Just as Mo Xingdao felt surprised and puzzled, a voice suddenly rang out in his ear, “Mo Daoyou, long time no see.”</p><p>The voice was close at hand, making Mo Xingdao’s back stiffen and a chill run down his spine. He abruptly turned his head, seeing a figure appear beside him at some point.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He never expected that Qin Sang would dare to show his true form!</p><p>No, not his true form, a phantom condensed from divine sense.  This wasn't a simple divine sense transformation; it had condensed into a real form!</p><p>Mo Xingdao fully extended his divine sense, becoming even more shocked.  The person's true body must be nearby, yet he hadn't noticed it at all.</p><p>The phantom held a jade bottle, smiling at Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was silent, taking out the Lingxi Immortal Fruit.</p><p>They confirmed that both treasures were genuine.</p><p>The phantom vanished in a flash, disappearing to an unknown location, leaving only the words, “Thank you, Daoyou, for your help. Until we meet again!”</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained silent, looking at the fiercely contested battlefield. He wasn't sure if the two Nascent Soul cultivators had noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, he turned to gaze at the boundless storm, silent for a moment before letting out a soft sigh.</p><p>In the distance, the true body and the phantom merged, put away the treasures without lingering, and vanished into the air.</p><p>“There was no ambush by the demon kings…”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.</p><p>To avoid any unforeseen complications, he chose to make the exchange now, cunningly selecting the crucial moment of the combined formation.</p><p>He had expected the Qinghu Saint King might order her demon kings to set an ambush, and Qin Sang wouldn't mind casually killing a few demon kings to enrich his treasury.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Qinghu Saint King actually kept her word.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, while the Qinghu Saint King held the title of Saint King, she lacked the substance.  Her killing intent was too strong, and she didn't involve herself in external affairs. The major clans of the East Sea demon race feared her, but their submission was only superficial; secretly, they colluded and defied her openly.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King had limited usable demons under her command, and other demon kings were unwilling to offend a powerful enemy for her.</p><p>The journey was unimpeded.  After escaping the storm, Qin Sang didn't think any more about it, and headed straight back to Luye.</p><p>Gathering Spirit Array, pills, spirit materials…</p><p>Qin Sang put away all the treasures one by one, but didn't examine them immediately.</p><p>There was one thing he was eager to do, waiting only for the return of his phantom.</p><p>Luye changed course, heading west along the edge of the North Sea.</p><p>It stopped near the storm zone in a deserted area in the west.</p><p>Qin Sang and his phantom flew out of Luye and into a barren mountain range.</p><p>This was a location Qin Sang had specifically chosen for summoning the Heavenly Demon.</p><p>“Swish! Swish!”</p><p>Two figures flew to the top of a basin.</p><p>The Mingyue Guards guarding the basin sensed something and flew up to salute.</p><p>“Patrol the surroundings. No one is to approach!”</p><p>Qin Sang gave the order in a deep voice, landing on the ground.</p><p>Several black square high platforms stood in the basin; their material was indistinguishable.</p><p>There were seven platforms in total, arranged according to the positions of the Big Dipper stars.  There was nothing connecting the platforms, yet they possessed a strange aura that circulated ceaselessly among them.</p><p>This was the altar required by the "Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture." It was less an altar and more a special array that could break through invisible barriers and call upon the extraterrestrial Heavenly Demon.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed to the position directly opposite the handle of the Dipper.</p><p>The phantom also approached, standing behind Qin Sang, serving as a protector while also ready to replace or shield him from harm.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the ground, his mind withdrawn, meditating for a long time, silently practicing the secret techniques of the "Heavenly Demon Illumination Scripture."</p><p>The next moment, one of the seven platforms emitted a black light.</p><p>Above the platform, a ball of black energy twisted and writhed within the black light.</p><p>Then a second platform showed an anomaly.</p><p>The order of the platforms' changes wasn't strictly according to distance from Qin Sang; no clear pattern was discernible.</p><p>As more and more platforms underwent changes, clumps of black energy surrounded Qin Sang. His consciousness then fell into a hazy stupor, as if being pulled into the depths of boundless space by a strange force.</p><p>He heard strange sounds, not human voices, like many strange energies gurgling and flowing in the void.</p><p>His mind remained clear, not lost in the process, focusing on recalling the scripture.</p><p>According to the scripture, there would be a special sensation when the secret technique was complete and made contact with the Heavenly Demon.</p><p>However, as time went on, when the secret technique was completed, Qin Sang felt nothing unusual.</p><p>Just as he was thinking, Qin Sang suddenly felt a wave of coldness descend.</p><p>“It’s coming!”</p>
