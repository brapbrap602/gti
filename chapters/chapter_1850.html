<h1>Chapter 1841: Winds of Change in Jushan Prefecture</h1><p>Master Wan finally understood the critical importance of the Jushan battle and dared not urge his senior uncle to revoke the order.  He knew he was incapable of shouldering this responsibility; only a Grand Master of his senior uncle's prestige and standing could handle it. Even after self-reducing his cultivation, his senior uncle’s strength was unmatched by them. If this battle involved a dispute over the Divine Court, then the Grand Master entering Jushan Prefecture to participate would not be the only one to self-reduce their cultivation.</p><p>Next, Master Wan saw the old Daoist pick up a golden brush from the table, dip it in vermillion ink, and swiftly complete a talisman.  A flash of light erupted, transforming the talisman into a white crane. The crane stretched its neck, let out a high-pitched cry, and spread its wings as if ready to fly. It circled briefly before the old Daoist, then shot out of the hall like an arrow, gradually fading into the distance until it disappeared into the clouds.</p><p>“Jushan Prefecture, the earliest of the Four Prefectures, should have been the largest.  However, it was also the first to be hit hard by the cataclysm, suffering the most severe damage.  The Prefecture’s Seal of Power was initially the most solidified and closest to completion among the four, but it shattered during the catastrophe.  Vast swathes of land cultivated by our Daoist ancestors over generations, including the prefecture’s altar, once again became a miasma-ridden wasteland. The noxious Qi of the Six Heavens ran rampant…”</p><p>The old Daoist put down the brush and walked towards the hall's exit, speaking as he went. Master Wan bowed slightly, respectfully following behind.  His expression shifted at his uncle's words; his doubts were resolved. After a moment's thought, he asked, “Even with the Daoist Court's power back then, refining the Seal of Power wasn’t easy, was it?”</p><p>Born and raised there, Master Wan had long found it strange that Jushan Prefecture, despite its devastation, was so vast. In the Daoist scriptures, a complete Jushan Prefecture was larger than the other three combined. It turned out to be related to the Seal of Power.</p><p>The Seal of Power connected to the Divine Court and communicated with the Heavenly Gods.  Whether it was the Daoist Court's main altar, the pacification altar, the capital altar, branch altars, or the various sect altars, their authority to bestow cultivation was derived from inheriting the Seal of Power.  Through the Seal of Power, reports were presented to the Divine Court, giving the Daoist’s authority its power.</p><p>From his uncle’s words, the more solidified a prefecture’s Seal of Power, the more extensive its territory. Jushan Prefecture’s territory now only extended south of Xingdao Xianhu, because its Seal of Power had been shattered.  He wondered how large the territory of a prefecture with a fully formed Seal of Power would be.</p><p>The current state of Jushan Prefecture's altar was certainly related to that great upheaval.  However, since Jushan Prefecture still existed, and those demonic kingdoms and sects could still confer cultivation, the Seal of Power couldn’t have been completely destroyed.  It was likely that fragments were held by both the Daoist Court and the Guifang Kingdom, resulting in the current situation of shared rule between cultivators and demonic kingdoms.</p><p>Master Wan pondered this, only to hear his senior uncle say, “Indeed, the Seal of Power can present reports to the Divine Court and bestow cultivation, making it the very foundation of a prefecture, and our foothold in the wasteland! For a prefecture, only with a completed Seal of Power can it be considered a proper prefecture.  The Divine Court possesses the ability to govern the four directions, eight extremes, and pacify the noxious Qi of the Six Heavens. Because the Divine Court is hidden, the connection between the Seal of Power and the Divine Court is weaker than ever. Not only can it not be further refined, but it must always be enshrined in the prefecture’s altar, maintained by the True Monarch. Its power is greatly affected; the higher the cultivation, the more noticeable the effect.  Once a Grand Master leaves the prefecture's territory, they risk instability and unrest in the wasteland. The so-called celestial phenomena are actually signs of our unstable foundations due to the impact of the Six Heavens’ noxious Qi.”</p><p>The shock Master Wan felt upon hearing these secrets was no less than before.  No wonder the Grand Masters’ movements caused celestial phenomena, no wonder True Monarchs were rarely seen, and even someone of his rank had never seen a True Monarch’s face. No wonder his senior uncle was willing to self-reduce his cultivation but hadn't considered asking a True Monarch for help.  The foundation of the Daoist sect lay not only in the Seal of Power, but also in the two True Monarchs maintaining it, allowing for no mistakes!</p><p>Master Wan, forgetting his disciplely etiquette, stepped forward and asked repeatedly, "Why not ask Senior Ling for help?"</p><p>The so-called Senior Ling was the spirit of a postnatal spiritual treasure from the Northern Pole Exorcism Court.  He had been fortunate enough to be protected by Senior Ling when he entered the Miasma Sea. He had never heard of spirits bestowing cultivation, but the postnatal spiritual treasure did not trigger celestial phenomena in the Miasma Sea.</p><p>“A spirit housed within its treasure can block the Six Heavens’ noxious Qi, but if it acts to its full potential in the Jushan Prefecture altar, the consequences will be the same as ours.  Restricting itself makes it no different from a normal treasure.  Many illusions within the altar are remnants of the great powers’ abilities from antiquity. After countless years of change, some have temporarily subsided, some balance each other, maintaining a fragile equilibrium. Once the power exceeds a certain limit, triggering the abilities to strike back, it will inevitably cause chaos.  If the hard-won clues are damaged, we will be worthy of a thousand deaths!”</p><p>The old Daoist sighed as he left the hall and stood in the courtyard.  He stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the heavens, his back to Master Wan.</p><p>Master Wan's expression was complex; he secretly guessed what his senior uncle was looking at—was it the legendary Divine Court, or was he ‘seeing’ the Dao?  Putting himself in his senior uncle's place, he knew that self-reducing his cultivation would undoubtedly be extremely reluctant.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, the wind roared.</p><p>A surge of spiritual energy roiled throughout the Jingtan Temple, flooding towards a courtyard deep within its grounds.  The temple's Daoists sensed the disturbance, their expressions a mix of surprise and apprehension.  Those with higher cultivation quickly understood the cause; even the less experienced officials, recalling ancient texts and legends, began to grasp the situation.</p><p>Rumors of a Grand Master's secluded palace within Jingtan, a place of frequent meditation, had circulated for years – now they were confirmed.  One by one, Daoists emerged from their residences, their gazes fixed on the courtyard.</p><p>Soon, the energy subsided.  After a long wait, seeing no further changes, the assembled Daoists, their curiosity piqued, dispersed, leaving the event as a future topic of conversation.</p><p>Within the courtyard, the converging spiritual energy coalesced into a phantom body, an exact replica of the old Daoist. The phantom hovered above the main hall, mirroring its physical counterpart before descending.  At about a meter from the ground, it paused, a blue light flashing as it seemed to dissolve, turning translucent. Simultaneously, a talisman appeared above the old Daoist's head.</p><p>Witnessing his master's talisman, Wan Zhenren displayed a mix of admiration and regret.  Within the talisman, the Northern Emperor resided, manifesting as the familiar Nine Heavens Military Seal, nearly solidifying into a tangible form.  Previously mystified by the seal's meaning, Wan Zhenren now understood: it was a token to summon divine beings, a command seal for both underworld and earthly forces!</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>Even before the talisman opened, mournful roars echoed forth.  Suddenly, a silver light shot into the courtyard, transforming into a silver bird that circled the old Daoist, emitting a plaintive cry, seeming to lament.</p><p>The old Daoist's face paled slightly. He groaned, and from where the phantom body had dissipated, a point of blue light descended, merging with his head. In an instant, his energy plummeted, falling below the Five Talismans rank, settling at the peak of the Cave Xuan stage. The talisman and the Nine Heavens Military Seal within dimmed considerably.</p><p>Similar events unfolded not only in this Jingtan, but also in Baishi, Zhongmao, and even in Guifang, causing widespread alarm.  A great upheaval was imminent…</p><p>At the Jushan Temple, Qin Sang remained oblivious to the disturbances, lost within the illusory landscapes, his exploration continuing. He considered himself virtually invulnerable within the Temple, especially after his breakthrough in the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* and the ascension of his Yun You sword to spiritual treasure status. He never expected a powerful cultivator to deliberately lower their own cultivation and enter.</p><p>“It’s becoming clearer…”</p><p>Qin Sang meditated in a narrow band of auspicious clouds within the illusory realm, spreading his palm, sensing the markings.  Each exploration ended in failure, yet he drew closer to his goal. The auspicious clouds thinned.</p><p>Finding such a region here was rare. Qin Sang noted its location as a future waypoint. Soon, his strength fully recovered, he rose and faced forward.  Based on the markings, he estimated that the target lay no more than three illusions away. The terrain was incredibly complex, with illusions intertwined, making progress difficult.  Detours could cost him significantly more time and effort, but the markings ensured he wouldn't get lost.</p><p>“Best to push through in one go,” he thought, carefully observing the illusion before him.  Its edge was less than a foot away, a scene of stark white, the biting wind almost tangible.</p><p>Having navigated many such illusions, Qin Sang followed a practiced routine, summoning his Qingluan Dharma Image, merging it with his own body, but not activating its power yet. He then activated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, transforming into a Vajra Glass Body. The Yun You sword floated above his head, its energy pulsing, ready to strike.</p><p>Given the scene before him, he took two additional precautions: he activated the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire, forming a fire armor for protection, and roused the young Vermilion Bird spirit, prepared to summon the Solar God Bird at any moment.</p><p>Prepared, Qin Sang stepped into the snow and wind. Instantly, an icy chill pierced his bones. Even his resilient body shuddered.  However, he endured, focusing his gaze on his surroundings.</p><p>Before him lay nothing but heavy snowfall and deep drifts, with underlying hills and valleys obscured by the snow.  Strangely, the snow fell endlessly, yet the snow depth remained constant. He noticed footprints would appear in the snow, but vanished instantly as he lifted his foot.</p><p>It seemed harmless, but as Qin Sang was about to proceed, a nameless unease settled upon him.</p><p>He frowned and stopped, unable to pinpoint the source of his apprehension.  He chose to retrace his steps out of the snowfield.</p><p>This was his experience from his adventures in the  Realm – never to force things, a strategy that had saved him many times before.</p><p>After a brief pause outside, Qin Sang returned. The unease returned. Several attempts yielded the same result, yet he couldn't identify the cause.</p><p>He summoned a puppet, which froze solid upon entering the snowfield.  Then, before his eyes, it turned white.</p><p>It wasn't covered in snow; the puppet itself was transforming into snow, eventually dissolving into the blizzard.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled but remained calm, pondering the scene reflected in his eyes.</p><p>Gazing at the swirling snow and raging wind, Qin Sang had an idea. He produced the four-serpent seal.</p><p>Four serpents uncoiled from the seal, darting into the snowfield, seemingly energized by the environment, writhing in the snow.</p><p>Qin Sang commanded the serpents to exhale, releasing frigid flames noticeably stronger than outside the snowfield.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang re-entered the snowfield and ordered the serpents to target him.</p><p>The icy flames coalesced, encasing him completely without a gap. Qin Sang felt as if encased in an ice ball, and his unease vanished.</p><p>"So simple?"</p><p>Qin Sang was incredulous, but he had to try.</p><p>He walked slowly; his footprints were immediately covered by the snow, leaving no trace.</p><p>The four serpents circled above him, like protective guardian beasts.</p><p>A man and 'four beasts' silently traversed the snowfield. His solitary figure blended seamlessly with the desolate landscape.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, his eyes sharp, until he reached the end of the snowfield without encountering any danger.</p><p>He’d encountered similar situations before. These illusions were unguarded; finding a countermeasure allowed for easy passage, and his methods were diverse.</p><p>Qin Sang turned back, sighing inwardly. He’d had a stroke of luck near his goal, saving considerable time.</p><p>The snowfield was likely a manifestation of some powerful ice-based technique.  Sadly, the creator was deceased; otherwise, studying it would have yielded rewards.</p><p>Leaving the snowfield, he stowed the four-serpent seal.  Upon seeing what lay ahead, his pupils constricted.</p><p>Before him was a pitch-black expanse. Two beams of light, like a pair of shears or a closing guillotine, crisscrossed the darkness.</p><p>He sensed the dark area wasn't large; it seemed safe passage lay beyond the blades. He flicked a bird-shaped puppet into the air.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had crafted various puppets for Qin Sang, to handle diverse situations.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The bird flew between the blades.</p><p>The two beams of light flickered faintly. The bird was severed in two, but continued its forward trajectory before falling to dust.</p><p>Qin Sang remained for several days, testing various methods. Finally, he stood before the blades, his phoenix wings unfolding. He unleashed a powerful beat.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Thunder roared, brilliant lightning tearing through the darkness.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang held nothing back. His Dharma image drew upon the essence of the Azure Luan’s thunder power, pushing his lightning escape technique to its peak.</p><p>This instantaneous speed would astound any cultivator at the Divine Transformation stage and cause even those at the Void Refinement stage to look twice.</p><p>Lightning pierced the blades.</p><p>Only after the lightning passed did the blades strike, but Qin Sang reappeared unscathed on the other side, smiling slightly. He turned and flew away from the darkness, instantly seeing a giant ancient mirror.</p><p>The mirror was round, its surface angled towards Qin Sang, standing before him; it seemed solid, yet wasn't.</p><p>Perhaps his luck had turned sour; in his many adventures in the Realm, Qin Sang had never encountered any true treasures.</p><p>The mirror reflected a familiar sight: the Vermillion Gold Needles!</p><p>Qin Sang stared for a moment, then slightly turned his head, seeing the overwhelming Vermillion Gold Needles, radiating an incredibly dangerous aura.</p><p>The reality matched his earlier guess: the needles’ reflection in the mirror, somehow traversing the Realm’s space, was projected to the outer edge.</p><p>The true scene was more intricate and extraordinary than its reflection.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up. Above was an inverted continent. Mountains and rivers mirrored the outside world; looking down, he saw a blue sky dotted with white clouds.</p><p>The world was inverted, causing dizziness.</p><p>The Vermillion Gold Needles originated from two inverted peaks; the mountains were deserted and lacked any formations.</p><p>Approaching slightly, Qin Sang felt an aura several times more dangerous than the reflection; he dared not act rashly.</p><p>The scene lacked the Ascension Path as described by Mo Xingdao, suggesting he was not yet at the end.</p><p>Qin Sang continued his explorations, memorizing every detail, planning to consult Mo Xingdao or bring him here.</p><p>Having accomplished his objective, Qin Sang retreated as planned, returning to his cave abode to rest.</p>
