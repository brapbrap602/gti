<h1>Chapter 1863: Arctic Ghost Slaughter</h1><p>At the heart of the golden armor formation, Qin Sang and Ling You Wang were locked in fierce combat.  Qin Sang was at the center, surrounded by the golden armored warriors, with Zuo Zhenren positioned above, forming a small, coordinated battle array. Qin Sang fought like a valiant general, leading his troops to encircle and annihilate the enemy, while Zuo Zhenren provided support and tactical direction.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was completely absorbed in the fight, launching a frenzied assault on his opponent. He fought without any formal techniques, relying solely on raw, powerful punches and kicks, a style that surprisingly aligned with the true essence of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal. He disregarded his injuries and exhaustion, fighting with a wild, almost manic energy. The strength of his spiritual wood body was finally on full display.</p><p>Even in his long life, Ling You Wang had never encountered such a ferocious opponent.  The sight of Qin Sang's bloodshot eyes filled him with a chilling dread. Ling You Wang had to simultaneously contend with the attacks of Qin Sang and the golden armored warriors, while also constantly guarding against Zuo Zhenren's talismans.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren, perched high on the altar, appeared calm and collected, but he was far from idle.  He moved with precise steps, his fingers weaving intricate hand seals, conjuring streams of talismanic images.  Sometimes these images merged with the golden armored warriors, and sometimes they shot directly at Ling You Wang.  These talismans could transform into swords, spears, halberds, or even evoke wind, flowers, snow, and moon, concealing deadly intent within their ethereal beauty. Their versatility kept Ling You Wang constantly on the defensive, forcing him to remain vigilant.</p><p>In a short span of time, Zuo Zhenren had deployed far more talismans than Qin Sang had ever seen, showcasing the incredible subtlety and power of Daoist talismanic arts.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A furious roar shook the heavens.  Qin Sang's relentless assault had unleashed Ling You Wang's savage nature.  His eyes blazed with ferocity, his body radiating a brilliant light as it visibly shrank.  His fish form was now less than half its original size, appearing almost dainty before Qin Sang, yet the gleam of his scales seemed deeper and more intense. At the same time, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable threat emanating from him and grew wary.</p><p>The transformation wasn't over. It began to affect the surroundings. A faint, watery aura emanated from Ling You Wang, spreading outward.  The aura dissipated upon contact with the golden armored warriors' formation, seemingly dispelled by the golden light.</p><p>On the altar, Zuo Zhenren's expression turned grave. His gaze shifted to a point outside the battle array.  The watery aura reappeared at the edge of the formation, ceasing its expansion and concentrating within a radius of several meters, only to undergo another transformation.</p><p>It seemed as if water had genuinely materialized there.  Within the shimmering water, a large black fish appeared out of thin air.  The fish, like the aura, was translucent, like a phantom.  It swam within the confines of the watery area, seemingly confined to a pool, yet it appeared quite at ease.</p><p>Two more black fish phantoms emerged, positioning themselves to form a three-talent formation, effectively encircling the golden armored warriors.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's expression shifted slightly. He gave a command, and a chorus of tearing sounds filled the battlefield. The golden ropes in the hands of the golden armored warriors were swiftly retracted and flung outwards, striking at the three black fish phantoms.</p><p>*‘Crack!’*</p><p>The golden ropes possessed immense power, seeming to tear through the very fabric of space as they struck, producing a deafening boom.  The golden light pierced through the black fish phantoms, then retracted.</p><p>Yet, the black fish phantoms remained unharmed, not a single scale out of place, the watery aura undisturbed.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren paused, momentarily unable to discern the nature of these fish phantoms, surmising they were a newly mastered technique of Ling You Wang.</p><p>Quickly adapting, he ordered the golden armored warriors to continue attacking Ling You Wang, while he himself produced three yellow talismans from his sleeve.  With a flick of his wrist, they transformed into three streaks of golden light, each targeting one of the black fish phantoms.</p><p>The talismans descended silently.  The paper vanished, leaving only three crimson characters written in cinnabar, floating on the surface of the watery aura.  The black fish phantoms immediately became less agile.</p><p>These were talismans of restraint, possessing powerful sealing abilities, effective against unknown entities.</p><p>However, Zuo Zhenren had been slightly too slow.</p><p>Within the formation, Ling You Wang suddenly lashed out with his tail. Simultaneously, the three black fish phantoms outside also whipped their tails.</p><p>Their tails moved with the speed of lightning; even the Sky-Eye Butterfly nearly failed to track their movements.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly raised his arms. With a deafening *bang*, he felt as if a mountain had struck him. He groaned, flung backward, nearly disrupting the formation of the golden armored warriors.</p><p>Once he recovered his composure, he raised his arms and discovered a significant dent in his Ming Shan armor on his forearms, crisscrossed with cracks.</p><p>This precious armor had protected him from countless attacks during the battle with Ling You Wang, but it had finally reached its limit.  While the material of the Ming Shan armor was exceptional, it was still inferior to a true treasure; its strength, dispersed throughout the body, had its limitations, and against a powerful demon king, its weaknesses were readily apparent.</p><p>Last time I was too greedy.  The full body armor dispersed the True Treasure's power too much, making it ineffective. Refining an inner armor would be best...</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the thought, his attack unrelenting. He spun and charged forward.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren noticed their movements. His gaze swept over Qin Sang, and he produced a small jade slip from his sleeve.  It resembled a jade slip, but was actually a talisman, called the  Responding Spirit Subduing Demon Jade Inscription.</p><p>This talisman could subdue demons and ghosts, preventing them from approaching, providing excellent protection.  It was a secret technique of the Daoist Court. This powerful talisman was difficult to refine; even the "talisman paper" required an extremely rare spiritual jade of exceptional quality, needing seventy-seven forty-nine steps of meticulous refinement before completion.</p><p>Producing this talisman showed Zuo Zhenren's determination to kill Ling You Wang!</p><p>*啪!*</p><p>The talisman shattered, transforming into a jade-colored stream of light.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed it, perceiving the light as beneficial, not harmful. He didn't resist, letting it envelop him.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang's figure became somewhat hazy. He felt lighter, the oppressive feeling he had faced Ling You Wang disappearing, replaced by a sense of superiority, as if he had become a deity subduing evil spirits, naturally suppressing his opponent.</p><p>Of course, this was an illusion.  Whether he could subdue Ling You Wang depended on who was stronger.</p><p>*轰!*</p><p>Qin Sang rushed forward, only to meet a sweeping fishtail. He countered with a heavy punch.</p><p>*砰!*</p><p>The impact shook Qin Sang's body. The fishtail's force was as powerful as before, but Qin Sang's response was far calmer.</p><p>"Indeed, it's a divine talisman!"</p><p>Qin Sang deflected the force, secretly praising it.  His footwork shifted, and he saw Ling You Wang leap into the air.</p><p>Just then, the Swallowing Sea Clam finally broke free from the wooden bead's entanglement and shot downward.</p><p>Seeing Ling You Wang's move, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  His phoenix wings beat rapidly, and he swooped down.</p><p>The sharp sound of piercing air filled his ears as dozens of golden ropes shot towards Ling You Wang, like an umbrella opening mid-air.</p><p>*咻!*</p><p>The Swallowing Sea Clam transformed into a dark light, returning to Ling You Wang's side.  Its shell slightly opened, swallowing Ling You Wang whole, then rapidly shot into the air.</p><p>*砰!砰!砰!*</p><p>The golden ropes struck, failing to break the clam shell, instead wrapping around it.  Dozens of golden ropes instantly bound the Swallowing Sea Clam.</p><p>*哗啦啦…*</p><p>The ropes strained. All the golden armored warriors roared, using all their strength to pull downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang also pursued, clapping his hands firmly onto the Swallowing Sea Clam. He used a 'thousand-jin fall' technique. From above, sword cries like thunder echoed as the Cloud Wandering Sword, like a dragon, rapidly struck the Swallowing Sea Clam.</p><p>Three black fish phantoms wildly lashed their tails.</p><p>Ling You Wang was formidable.  Even under this attack, he relentlessly pushed outwards.</p><p>*嘎吱吱!*</p><p>The golden ropes stretched to their breaking point.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's brow furrowed slightly. He immediately ordered half the golden armored warriors to pass their ropes to their comrades.  They bent their knees, leaped into the air, and with loud *bang*s, collided with each other.</p><p>A blinding golden light erupted. As the light subsided, the golden armored warriors had transformed into a golden mountain, aimed at the Swallowing Sea Clam, crashing down upon it.</p><p>No one knew how heavy this mountain was. Qin Sang caught a glimpse, his eyelids twitching involuntarily.</p><p>*轰隆!*</p><p>The mountain struck the Swallowing Sea Clam.</p><p>The treasure light was almost completely scattered. The clam shell, under the impact, cracked open, seemingly smashed apart.</p><p>The clam shell opened wide, revealing a dark interior, and Ling You Wang emerged.</p><p>Seeing Ling You Wang again, Qin Sang's eyes showed surprise, a strange feeling rising in his heart.</p><p>For some reason, the black fish apparition was significantly more illusory than before.  Completely ignoring the surrounding enemies, it tilted its head upwards, its mouth wide open, as if swallowing something.  After appearing, the apparition changed rapidly, about to dissipate.</p><p>Meanwhile, the three black fish phantoms around him solidified, mimicking the posture of the main apparition, their mouths also open.</p><p>In fact, the three phantom black fish had acted earlier, but Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren were distracted by the Swallowing Sea Clam.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang had an epiphany, suddenly remembering Ling You Wang's water-element attack. His expression tightened, and he urgently warned, "Senior, be careful..."</p><p>Nearby, there were also illusory scenes containing water vapor, though not connected to the jungle area.</p><p>Before he finished speaking...</p><p>The sky suddenly darkened.  An extraordinary amount of water vapor, from an unknown source, gathered in the sky to form clouds.</p><p>The next moment, torrential rain poured down.</p><p>In a short time, the land transformed into a lake, the water continuing to rise, already submerging half the tree trunks.</p><p>The black fish apparition glowed with a幽蓝幽蓝 light, flickering like flames.</p><p>Ling Youwang, his face contorted with ferocious hatred, glared at Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren, his sworn enemies.  He was forced to sacrifice his Dharma image, unleashing a power far beyond the capabilities of a Dongxuan-stage cultivator, just to escape.  Any further delay, any more depletion of his strength, would render even this sacrifice useless.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a suffocating pressure, the terrifying torrent of water blotting out the sky, filling him with dread. This was true demonic king power!</p><p>At that moment, Zuo Zhenren calmly replied, "It's fine."</p><p>His tone was supremely confident, as if he had been anticipating this very moment, easing Qin Sang's apprehension.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The torrential rain abruptly ceased, ending rather abruptly.</p><p>But the sky remained overcast, thick water vapor filling the space, shrouding the forest in mist.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren suddenly heard the ethereal sound of waves.</p><p>In an instant, their surroundings transformed.  The space had become a deep lake; the ancient trees, the golden armored soldiers, Qin Sang, and Zuo Zhenren, all found themselves submerged.</p><p>The world was like water, all living beings like fish in a sea.  Now, Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren were trapped fish, their freedom limited by the surface of the water – a tangible boundary only the most powerful cultivators could breach.</p><p>This was both real and illusion.  Their world remained unchanged to Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren; they felt no water, saw no boundary, yet Ling Youwang had vanished before their eyes – a sudden, unexpected disappearance.</p><p>"Indeed, the descendants of the Dao soldiers and demon gods, carefully selected by the ancients, all possess extraordinary bloodlines…"</p><p>Zuo Zhenren murmured, expressing his awe at Ling Youwang's power.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>A splash erupted from the still surface of the water; a black fish leaped into the air. Its body arched like a crescent moon, its ascent relentless. Its tail flicked slightly.  The fish was leaping the Dragon's Gate!</p><p>Wherever the fish passed, water vapor followed, rising ceaselessly. Wherever the vapor touched, the scenery changed.  Even the sky was pressed down by the rising water, which continued to climb, threatening to engulf the forest, even the illusory scenes above.</p><p>As the fish soared, Ling Youwang's Dharma image continued to burn, slowly revealing his true form: a black fish with a tail almost transformed into a dragon's. He was exhausted, his scales dull, but he dared not stop, using all his strength to flee the battlefield, to escape.  Even severely weakened, he could still survive in a place rich in water-based spiritual energy.</p><p>Finally, Ling Youwang broke through the sky.</p><p>"Faster! Faster!"</p><p>He urged himself inwardly. His enemies were below, seemingly unaware of his escape, searching blindly for him.  Fortunately, Zuo Fengdao's cultivation had been reduced to the Dongxuan realm, limiting his spiritual perception; otherwise, the deception wouldn't have lasted long.</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, a flash of green light caught Ling Youwang's eye.  It clung to the edge of the sky, almost invisible.  Yet, Ling Youwang couldn't tear his gaze away.</p><p>The green light flashed, blocking his path, revealing a small seal – three inches long, two and a fifth inches wide.  Carved from jade, the seal's handle was broken, one corner chipped, and the inscription on its surface was incomplete and scratched.</p><p>"North… Kill… Ghost…"</p><p>Recognizing the fragmented inscription, Ling Youwang's eyes widened in disbelief. Could it be… the North Pole Kill-Ghost Seal?</p><p>The North Pole Kill-Ghost Seal, one of the legendary Daoist seals, originating from the North Pole Exorcism Academy, was renowned for its power over demons and evil spirits.  It vanished after the decline of the Divine Court and the Daoist Court.  Some speculated it had been destroyed in the catastrophic war that ended the Daoist Court.  Countless Daoist masters and treasures were lost in that war. The Daoists believed that the seal was a testament to heaven and earth, usable for writing talismans, casting spells, establishing altars, summoning soldiers, performing rituals, submitting petitions, exorcising evil, cultivating, and making supplications. Over many years, powerful Daoists produced many seals; however, few survived.</p><p>Legend had it that the seal appeared in the final battle, surviving partially, and its fragments ended up at the Jushan altar.  Another tale claimed the North Pole Exorcism Academy recovered the seal and enshrined it at Baishi, though the current Daoist court lacks the ability to repair it.</p><p>The North Pole Kill-Ghost Seal was in Zuo Fengdao's possession, and he could activate it!  Even if it was just a fragment!</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The North Pole Kill-Ghost Seal flew towards Ling Youwang, its gentle green light radiating, yet filling him with terror.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren looked up.</p><p>Qin Sang had somehow summoned the Five Elements Crown, holding it in his palm.  The crown spun, its five-colored light piercing the sky!</p><p></p>
