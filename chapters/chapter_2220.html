<h1>Chapter 2210: The Celestial Serpent General</h1><p>Besides Yu Zhen, Qin Sang sensed many eyes on him—some scrutinizing, some probing, others wary.  He frowned, guessing the robed cultivator had revealed his exploits. This wasn't good; too much attention would hamper his actions. He preferred to remain hidden, observing the shifting tides.</p><p>He scanned the crowd, finding the robed cultivator and his two female companions; they too were watching him, their expressions complex.</p><p>Different backgrounds and various reasons had naturally divided the people into two camps, now facing off. Personal grudges were insignificant; neither Qin Sang nor the robed cultivator would make a move now.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the Mermaid Queen stepped forward, gesturing towards the storm, and declared loudly, "We dare not disrupt the Ancestors' grand plan.  Therefore, esteemed friends, please proceed!"</p><p>Qin Sang observed coldly, guessing the Queen's intention: to send the Ancestor's disciples ahead to complete their tasks. Any subsequent turmoil, so long as it didn't affect the Ancestors' grand scheme, would be inconsequential.  Ideally, avoiding conflict and completing the trial to obtain the treasures would be perfect.</p><p>However, if Hong Tian and the others had sent everyone here, they had a way to ensure compliance; the Mermaid Queen's plan might fail.</p><p>As a human, Qin Sang didn't concern himself with these machinations. Regardless of the factions’ maneuvering, he'd follow his own plan.</p><p>He looked skyward, wondering if Hong Tian and the others could see them.  No one stopped the Mermaid Queen.</p><p>The Ancestor's disciples’ faces shifted between gloom and uncertainty. They saw the Queen's confidence, understood its source, and knew it couldn't be dissuaded by words.  If a fight broke out, they wouldn't necessarily win.</p><p>Then, a cultivator flew into the storm. The radiant light hadn't fully dissipated, but no gray figures emerged.</p><p>"Let's go. No need to tangle with them," someone whispered.</p><p>Many were restless; they weren't a monolith, each with their own agenda.</p><p>Several figures darted into the storm, vanishing quickly. More followed, until everyone had left, leaving the area outside empty.</p><p>Having patiently waited, they flew to the storm's edge.  They’d witnessed the other disciples' fate firsthand.  Besides its destructive power, the storm held no other peculiarities; scouting was unnecessary.</p><p>"Those who wish to accompany me, follow!"</p><p>The winged prince gave a sharp whistle, leading the winged people into the storm.  Many followed, including Yuan Jian.</p><p>A similar scene unfolded elsewhere; soon, many groups entered the storm from different directions, ignoring each other.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. The situation was chaotic: a power struggle among Saint Realm elders, open and covert conflict between the Water and Sky clans, and the internal and external struggles of the sacred lands.  Even those of the same clan were divided, perhaps to secretly collude later.  The future was unclear.</p><p>"We should go," the Yuanxiang Clan leader said.</p><p>Their group included Qin Sang, Liuli, Ji Xia, the Yuanxiang Clan leader, Yuan Ren, and several others—a Zhuyan clan member, an old friend, and some who had joined for the clan's reputation.</p><p>Around a dozen in total, they weren't the weakest group. The Mermaid and winged people had the largest and strongest contingents.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The wind cut like knives.</p><p>They used their True Energy for protection, yet felt a slight stinging, as if the wind eroded their True Energy.</p><p>Inside the storm, the view was filled with chaotic winds. The ground was ruins, carved into countless ravines by the wind.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance. Before the change, the realm wasn't like this.  Records showed the realm's appearance wasn't static, so what they saw might not be the reality, and the realm might not be destroyed.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang said, "Friends, we shall proceed."</p><p>There was no need to hide; he'd already informed the Yuanxiang Clan leader and others that he and Liuli had other matters to attend to.</p><p>Next, the top priority is for Liuli to undergo her tribulation and restore Mount Taiyu. The trial rewards are secondary, so Qin Sang plans to separate from the group for now and rejoin them later.</p><p>If Liuli can successfully pass her tribulation, things will be much easier regardless of the outcome.</p><p>However, this place is drastically different from the records. There's no precise rendezvous point, so they can only agree on a general direction and head towards it.</p><p>“Only the two of you?  Wouldn't it be safer if two more cultivators went with you?” the Yuanxiang Clan leader expressed concern.</p><p>“No need.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and refused. Liuli's tribulation wasn't his main concern; he needed to secretly obtain the spiritual essence of Mount Yuanjiao, requiring stealth.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader guessed it might be Ning Zhenren's instruction and didn't ask further. They bid farewell, and Qin Sang and Liuli left the group.</p><p>…</p><p>The wind howled fiercely.</p><p>The world was shrouded in a vast expanse of mist.</p><p>Two streaks of light cut through the storm, their speed fluctuating—Qin Sang and Liuli.</p><p>They were trying their best to find traces of the remaining ruins as a reference.</p><p>According to the classics, the place that could help Liuli with her tribulation was straight ahead.  Even with everything going smoothly, it would take three days when the ruins were intact. Now that there are no formations blocking the way, it should be faster.</p><p>But the ruins have been completely changed. If even the direction has shifted, they might end up going in completely the wrong direction.</p><p>Unfortunately, after flying for two hours, Qin Sang and Liuli found no useful clues and could only continue along their original route.</p><p>Their observations along the way made them increasingly pessimistic; the ruins seemed to be truly destroyed.</p><p>However, until they see it with their own eyes, they won't easily give up.</p><p>The area was vast. They continued flying for another hour, still encountering no one.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang stopped, gesturing for Liuli to halt, and listened intently.</p><p>The wind carried an unusual scent.</p><p>After a moment, both Qin Sang and Liuli faintly heard howls—sharp and wolf-like.</p><p>“Beasts!”</p><p>Qin Sang whispered.  As expected, there were indeed beasts here.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a group of beasts approaching, not many in number. He planned to test their nature to see if they were like the outside beast tide.</p><p>However, they needed to guard against the unpredictable gray figures. Qin Sang told Liuli to be prepared; he could handle it alone.</p><p>The howls grew clearer, rising and falling.</p><p>They continued flying forward, and soon, countless dark shadows appeared on the horizon—a pack of wolf demons.</p><p>These wolf demons roamed the wasteland, large and with green fur. The strongest one was like a small mountain, its enormous eyes glowing coldly.</p><p>The wolf demons also spotted Qin Sang and Liuli, all staring over. In the dim storm, their eyes seemed sinister.</p><p>“Aooo!”</p><p>The alpha wolf howled, its cry filled with rage and frenzy, as if Qin Sang and Liuli had a deadly feud with them.</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The wolf pack charged, the ground trembling violently.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved. Even the strongest alpha wolf was only at the late Nascent Soul stage, and this pack alone couldn't form a beast tide.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A lightning bolt illuminated the earth, striking the wolf pack.  Half the wolf demons instantly vanished.</p><p>The death of their companions only enraged the wolf demons further, but as the lightning spread, they all met their end.</p><p>Like the outside beast tide, these wolf demons left nothing behind after death; they weren't truly real.</p><p>“We should get out before the beast tide forms,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Before he finished, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed. He looked up, and a crimson expanse appeared high in the sky—a giant fireball, like a meteor, falling from the heavens.</p><p>The sky was practically ablaze, the red flames blotting out the sky.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The fire meteor crashed into the earth, the ground shaking violently, the sound deafening.</p><p>The fire meteor landed not far from them. The two of them used their spiritual vision and saw the fire meteor hit a mountain, instantly obliterating the peak and creating a large crater.</p><p>Flames erupted continuously from the crater, burning even the earth.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli's expressions turned serious. They sensed a powerful aura from the crater; the fire meteor was a living being!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Flames shot into the sky.</p><p>A figure burst from the fire pit—a crimson-scaled giant python.</p><p>The python stretched its body, nearly a thousand meters long, a colossal creature.</p><p>Its body, serpentine and vast, resembled a mountain range.  Its scales shimmered with an uncanny luster, untouched by the surrounding flames.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The giant serpent rolled through the sky, its tail lashing out, effortlessly shattering two mountain peaks.  It seemed to be in great pain, its expression contorted with struggle, its roars echoing through the mountains.</p><p>The serpent's aura was comparable to a late-stage Transcendent cultivator. Qin Sang, unwilling to engage, prepared to retreat.  But then he saw the serpent's eyes and paused.</p><p>Its gaze was unlike any beast he'd encountered before.  There was intelligence in those eyes, not just mindless savagery.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a surprised glance.  The previous demonic beasts had been mere facades, but this serpent... this was different.</p><p>Perhaps, if it could communicate, it could answer many of their questions!</p><p>The serpent noticed them, its eyes locking onto them, cold and menacing.</p><p>“Hiss…Roar!”</p><p>It roared, its body coiling tightly, its eyes flashing with the same madness as the other beasts.  But unlike them, this serpent was fighting against it.</p><p>Whenever a flicker of lucidity broke through, it would fix its gaze on the uninvited guests, emitting broken sounds.</p><p>“You…are…human…”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He understood the meaning, but the phrasing and tone were peculiar.</p><p>Since arriving in the Grand Thousand World, Qin Sang had, in his spare time, studied the development of its language and writing.  He found that the reign of the Jade Emperor marked a turning point.</p><p>Currently, the human race in the Grand Thousand World, regardless of location, used the same language, with only dialectal variations.  Other races, the Yi, the Wu, and even the demons, had adapted it, adding their own characteristics.  Inter-racial communication wasn't a major obstacle.  For cultivators, language wasn't a barrier, with various secret techniques and, most directly, spiritual sense.</p><p>Human language is the most common tongue in the Grand Thousand World, thanks to the Jade Emperor.</p><p>Before his time, in antiquity, countless ancient languages existed, each race with its own communication method.  Only when the Jade Emperor led the human race to ascendancy did a unified language emerge, drawing from ancient tongues.  It was a masterpiece, not only for communication but also incorporating ancient cloud-and-thunder script and other powerful spiritual characters; many runes are derived from these characters.</p><p>The rise of the human race was closely tied to this development.</p><p>But this serpent spoke an ancient tongue.</p><p>Qin Sang could understand it because this language, prevalent among demons before the Jade Emperor, was recorded in ancient texts!</p><p>“Could this serpent be from antiquity? A traveler through time?”</p><p>Finding the situation odd, Qin Sang bowed.  “We are human cultivators.  May I ask your name, friend?”</p><p>“I…am…Yi…Yi Su…Celestial Serpent…General…”</p><p>The serpent's speech was fragmented and unclear.  Qin Sang found the connection to the asterisms increasingly strange.</p><p>“This…General…patrolling…here…”</p><p>Suddenly, the serpent seemed to recall something. Its eyes widened, blazing with furious rage.</p><p>“Inferior beings!”</p><p>“…Insolence…deserving death!”</p><p>The serpent fell into a frenzy.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Mountain peaks were smashed by its tail, collapsing in clouds of dust.</p><p>The wolf demons left no corpses after their deaths; only if the serpent had witnessed that event during its fall would there be any trace.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli felt a knot in their stomachs, and annoyance stirred within them. Humanity now ruled the Grand Thousand World; this serpent's arrogance was infuriating.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A wave of searing heat washed over them.</p><p>Consumed by rage, the serpent lost all reason.  Fury and madness filled its eyes.  It reared up, spewing a torrent of flames.</p><p>The flames shot forth, twisting the very fabric of space. The sheer power within them made Qin Sang and Liuli pale.</p><p>Simultaneously, an even larger shadow emerged behind the serpent, engulfing the mountain range.</p><p>It was a colossal demonic serpent apparition, towering over the landscape, looking down upon its foes. Compared to it, Qin Sang and Liuli were insignificant insects.</p>
