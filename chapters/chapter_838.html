<h1>Chapter 830: The Decision</h1><p>When Qin Sang arrived at the small courtyard, Madam Liu was already waiting.</p><p>In the few short years since leaving Seven Kills Hall, her cultivation had indeed greatly improved, just a step away from late Core Formation.</p><p>Despite her advancements, no joy could be seen on her face, only a faint sorrow and weariness in her brows.</p><p>Tracking down Xiang Yi had consumed a great deal of her energy.</p><p>“I finally see you in person, Daoist,” Madam Liu said softly, a hint of reproach in her voice.  When Qin Sang left Tianxing Island, Madam Liu was no match for Xiang Yi alone and missed a golden opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he was at fault. “I was compelled by circumstances.  A critical matter demanded my immediate attention. Madam, you've been investigating Xiang Yi for years, have you made any progress?”</p><p>Madam Liu was intelligent. After expressing a touch of dissatisfaction, she didn't dwell on the matter.  Her expression turned serious. “Fortunately, you've returned in time, or I would have truly despaired.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Qin Sang activated the spirit array and invited Madam Liu into the house, setting up a soundproof barrier.</p><p>The two sat down.</p><p>Once seated, Madam Liu explained, “Do you recall what I said before, Daoist? Xiang Yi is highly valued by the Merchant Alliance's leader. After leaving Seven Kills Hall, he's expected to quickly reach the peak of late Core Formation.”</p><p>“Of course,” Qin Sang said gravely, “Has he already broken through?”</p><p>Qin Sang had faced peak late Core Formation cultivators before and prevailed for good reason.</p><p>Against the young master of the Western Gloom Alliance, he had used the Blood Defilement Divine Light in a surprise attack, destroying the opponent’s poison warding artifact and using poison mist to secure the kill.  The mysterious body cultivator had perished in the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>The Soul Refiner he encountered not long ago was completely countered by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>"That's precisely my worry. Upon my return, I immediately began investigating Xiang Yi’s whereabouts. Before his breakthrough, there was a slim chance.  But with you absent, I didn't dare act rashly, fearing I'd alert him.  I could only watch helplessly as that villain continued to roam free…"</p><p>Bound by deep love for her husband, Madam Liu's hatred for Xiang Yi only intensified. “Fortunately, heaven has eyes. Xiang Yi hasn't been able to cultivate in seclusion for long. He was forced to leave and hasn't yet broken through.  You must have heard about the disturbances in the Demon Sea, haven't you, Daoist?”</p><p>“You mean the demon unrest?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. All sorts of rumors had been circulating.</p><p>"I've heard of the demon activity and the frequent beast tides in the Demon Sea, with even established islands coming under attack. However, I believe this is just a new cycle, a back-and-forth struggle like before.  Regardless, neither humans nor witches will abandon the Demon Sea.”</p><p>Madam Liu hummed in agreement. "Whatever the demons’ motives are, and however the situation unfolds, it's beyond our control.  These beast tides are actually beneficial for us. To address the crisis, the Merchant Alliance has deployed its experts to the Demon Sea, including Xiang Yi.  He was supposed to be in secluded cultivation, but he had to interrupt it and obey the summons.  He’s currently on an island in the Demon Sea.  Upon his return, he'll surely prioritize his breakthrough. This is likely our only opportunity…”</p><p>Pausing briefly, Madam Liu added, “Acting in the Demon Sea has another advantage. Amidst the current chaos, if Xiang Yi dies there, the Merchant Alliance will simply assume he perished at the hands of demons and won't suspect us…”</p><p>"It seems you've made thorough arrangements.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked intently at Madam Liu.</p><p>As she said, the timing was indeed excellent. The only concern was entering the Demon Sea against the tide, risking being swept up in the chaos.</p><p>Driven by vengeance, Madam Liu disregarded her own safety.</p><p>Xiang Yi had to die; otherwise, Qin Sang would have no peace. But sacrificing himself wasn’t worth it.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, weighing his options. He decided a trip might be worthwhile.</p><p>While the demons were powerful, the humans and witches had established a strong presence in the Demon Sea over the years and wouldn't be easily defeated.</p><p>Confident in his improved swordsmanship and protected by the Star Conch treasure and the Dual-Headed Serpent, Qin Sang believed he could handle the dangers of the Demon Sea.</p><p>Killing Xiang Yi not only eliminated a serious threat but also promised substantial rewards, freeing Qin Sang from distractions and allowing him to focus on cultivation.</p><p>He needed to reach the late third stage of the “Demonic Transformation” before the next Seven Kills Hall opening, and time was tight.</p><p>As a trusted confidant of the Eastern Pole Alliance leader, Xiang Yi possessed considerable wealth.  To persuade Qin Sang, Madam Liu had promised him all the spoils.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang had another hidden motive. He wanted to take this opportunity to visit Hutian Island and see if he could acquire more Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>He still yearned for the flame.</p><p>The power of the fire pearls remained vivid in his memory.</p><p>With a few more fire pearls, he could dominate the Core Formation stage.</p><p>The Winter Nether Cold Flame was guarded by the Hutian Island Master's subordinates. Having already stolen a wisp, Qin Sang dared not return for fear of a trap.  If the Transforming Demon or Nascent Soul Patriarch knew he had taken some, they wouldn't let him go.</p><p>Now, with the demon unrest, the Hutian Island Master was preoccupied, presenting a golden opportunity.</p><p>He just didn't know if the Winter Nether Cold Flame was still there.</p><p>Madam Liu anxiously awaited Qin Sang's response.</p><p>"Besides myself, who else have you recruited, Madam?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't immediately agree, instead posing a question.</p><p>Madam Liu gave a wry smile. “My husband's savings are almost depleted. Even if I could find help, who would dare challenge a late Core Formation expert and a trusted confidant of the Alliance Leader?  Only a friend of mine is currently in the Demon Sea monitoring Xiang Yi, but she recently reached Core Formation and can't offer much assistance.  I have a plan. After we arrive, we’ll lure Xiang Yi off the island and strike.  I’ve managed to acquire a rare talisman that can temporarily suppress Xiang Yi’s true essence, weakening him. But the talisman takes time to activate.  During that time, you must hold him off, Daoist, and buy me time…”</p><p>To convince Qin Sang, Madam Liu revealed her plan without reservation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. Of course, he wouldn't completely trust her plan. He would assess the situation upon arrival and adapt accordingly. Even if the assassination failed, he could escape safely.</p><p>"Alright, I'll accompany you, Madam. However, this is unexpected, and I have some matters to arrange. Wait for me one night, and we'll depart tomorrow morning, how about that?”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>Madam Liu's face lit up with joy.  "Time is of the essence, Daoist!  Please make haste!"</p>
