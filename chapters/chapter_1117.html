<h1>Chapter 1109: Old Friends</h1><p>Cuiming Mountain.</p><p>I remember, back then, when I first arrived.</p><p>At the Qingyang Temple on Cuiming Mountain, Qin Sang felt a sense of belonging to this world for the first time.</p><p>I still remember that time vividly.</p><p>Who would have thought that so many cultivators would come from the small Qingyang Temple?</p><p>Now, Qin Sang arrived at the foot of the mountain and found that the Qingyang Temple had been rebuilt with new structures, housing ordinary Taoist priests.  The old site was hidden by a concealed spirit array, likely left by Yunyouzi or Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Wu Chuanzong was buried on Cuiming Mountain after his death.</p><p>Qin Sang found his grave, paid his respects, and went to the spirit array. Just as he was about to forcefully break the array, he suddenly had a thought, his face breaking into a smile, and he sent a single strand of True Qi into it.</p><p>Then, he stood with his hands behind his back, motionless, as if waiting for someone.</p><p>Not long after, a streak of light suddenly appeared on the horizon, swift as a meteor, rushing towards him.</p><p>In an instant, the light arrived, and before it even landed, a surprised shout echoed from within: "Master Uncle!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The person landed before Qin Sang, revealing their figure.</p><p>It was Li Yu Fu!</p><p>"Master Uncle! You're still alive!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu's face was filled with surprise and excitement, disbelief etched across his features.</p><p>More than a hundred years had passed, with no news.</p><p>They had assumed Qin Sang had perished.</p><p>"Yu Fu, it's been many years. You've already formed your Golden Core; your cultivation is almost catching up to your Master Uncle."</p><p>Qin Sang looked Li Yu Fu over.</p><p>Reuniting with an old friend, his joy was evident.</p><p>Li Yu Fu possessed a dual-spiritual root talent and received meticulous guidance from Yunyouzi.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised he had formed his Golden Core.</p><p>"Master Uncle, Grandmaster and I have been searching for you for so long! Where have you been?"</p><p>Li Yu Fu's voice was thick with emotion.</p><p>Even in the Xiaohan region, some still remembered him.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of emotion.  "It's a long story. Open the spirit array, and we'll talk inside…"</p><p>The two entered the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"I'll go to the Taiyi Danzong first.  You weren't there. Where have you been cultivating? Was your Grandmaster with you?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked urgently.</p><p>"We discovered an excellent spirit vein downstream of the Wuling River and established a cave dwelling. I sensed an opportunity to form my Golden Core, so I stayed there to cultivate. After I luckily formed my Core, I also remained in seclusion, rarely going out. Grandmaster wasn't in the cave dwelling; he went to the Demon Realm several years ago. Unfortunately, I don't know how to contact him. He'll be overjoyed to know Master Uncle is safe…"</p><p>Li Yu Fu answered without reservation.</p><p>"To the Demon Realm again?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "Why is your Grandmaster so fond of the Demon Realm?"</p><p>"Grandmaster never mentioned anything about the Demon Realm to me."</p><p>Li Yu Fu shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, without any clues. He could only wait until he saw Yunyouzi to find out the reason.</p><p>"Back then, I was threatened by Dongyang Bo and forced to flee.  I was afraid of implicating you both, so I didn't dare to contact your Grandmaster. The journey back was difficult, and I only recently found an opportunity to return…"</p><p>Qin Sang explained lightly.</p><p>"No wonder! After returning from the Ziwei Palace, Shaohua Mountain remained tight-lipped about you. It turns out Dongyang Bo wanted to harm you. Grandmaster infiltrated the area near Shaohua Mountain and investigated for a long time without finding any information about you.  He almost devised a plan to kidnap Dongyang Bo's disciple, Qiu Mubai, to force an answer!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu said indignantly.</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. He hadn't expected Yunyouzi to almost kidnap Qiu Mubai to find him.</p><p>Qiu Mubai was Dongyang Bo's most valued disciple.  It was obvious how great the risk was.</p><p>"I appreciate the effort, Senior.  Did Senior not act rashly?"</p><p>Li Yu Fu shook his head. "Later, Grandmaster seemed to have accidentally contacted a fellow disciple of yours, Mu Yifeng, and learned something, so he stopped."</p><p>"How is Mu Yifeng doing?"</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened.</p><p>The two people he most wanted to see upon his return were Yunyouzi and Mu Yifeng.</p><p>That day, Mu Yifeng let him go. Although they staged a scene, it was probably hard to conceal it from the discerning eyes of a Nascent Soul master. He was worried that Mu Yifeng would suffer Dongyang Bo's wrath.</p><p>Li Yu Fu thought for a moment and said, "I remember Grandmaster mentioning that Mu Yifeng had already formed his Golden Core at that time. But since then, he rarely appeared, and we haven't heard from him."</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow slightly, feeling a little relieved.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu had said that Dongyang Bo valued his sect greatly.</p><p>Since he hadn't punished Mu Yifeng in the Ziwei Palace, and Mu Yifeng had successfully broken through to become a rare Golden Core powerhouse, there was no reason to settle the score later.</p><p>Taiyi Danzong profited greatly from the war and grew increasingly prosperous.  Their internal spiritual veins are undoubtedly far superior to anything you could find on your own. Why stay in this remote wilderness to cultivate instead of returning to your sect? Is there some kind of conflict with your sect?”</p><p>Qin Sang changed his tone and asked curiously.</p><p>Li Yu Fu shook his head and said, “Grandmaster intentionally keeps a distance from Taiyi Danzong. I was only a registered disciple, never formally admitted. After the Crime Abyss invasion, Grandmaster voluntarily went to the battlefield, achieving great military merits for the sect. Afterwards, he brought me here and rarely returned. I heard Grandmaster mention that I should focus on my cultivation and, upon reaching a high level, continue the Qingyang Temple lineage.”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.  The wandering cultivator also wanted to establish a sect; they had the same idea.</p><p>“What realm is your Grandmaster at now?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu's face was full of admiration and respect. “Grandmaster formed his golden core at Ziwei Palace.  His cultivation progressed rapidly after returning, breaking through to the peak of the Golden Core stage years ago. He has been refining his cultivation all these years, and it seems forming a Nascent Soul is not difficult for him.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what to say. The wandering cultivator had truly not disappointed him.</p><p>He had thought his cultivation speed was already fast, but the wandering cultivator was even more astonishing. In just over a hundred years, he was only a hair's breadth away from forming a Nascent Soul.</p><p>This was good. The sooner the wandering cultivator formed a Nascent Soul, the sooner he could help him refine the Du E Dan.</p><p>As they spoke, they arrived at Cuiming Mountain.</p><p>Li Yu Fu was about to scold them.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped him, saying, “These two are descendants of old friends, serving by my side.  Since I don't have a place to stay yet, let them cultivate at your place for now.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu readily agreed.</p><p>“Uncle Master!”</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Tan Yi En and Bai Han Qiu entered the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang introduced them to each other, feeling somewhat amused.</p><p>He had a Golden Core cultivator, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and a Qi Refinement cultivator with him—vastly different cultivation levels.  According to some sects’ rules, seniority is determined by realm. Because of him, they could only be equals.</p><p>“Uncle Master, the situation in Da Sui has stabilized. The current emperor voluntarily ceded the throne to the Qin family, and those independent cultivators are willing to stay in the capital to assist the new emperor. Unfortunately, I have checked the direct descendants of the Qin family and others, and found no young descendants with spiritual roots.”</p><p>Tan Yi En reported meticulously.</p><p>Bai Han Qiu glanced at Tan Yi En, hesitating to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't comment, saying calmly, “Alright, you’ve entered the immortal path, don’t get too involved in the mundane world, especially Han Qiu. I have important matters to attend to. You two stay here for now; Yu Fu’s guidance will be more than enough for you.”</p>
