<h1>Chapter 1224: Illusionary Realm</h1><p>Chapter 1224: Illusionary Realm</p><p>Few could traverse the Glacial Plain as effortlessly as Qin Sang.  </p><p>The cultivators present, even those uninjured, had expended considerable spiritual energy resisting the cold.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally noted each of them; they would likely be his rivals when the time came to compete for the Soul-Washing Liquid. Finally, his gaze shifted to two pavilions ahead.</p><p>Each pavilion contained a teleportation array.</p><p>One led outside the hall, the other to the third trial.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang entered a pavilion and proceeded to the next trial, amidst several surprised stares.</p><p>He found himself in what appeared to be a canyon.</p><p>Thick, impenetrable fog filled the air, obscuring his spiritual sense and carrying a chilling dampness, though it was far warmer than the Glacial Plain.</p><p>In the distance, shadowy forms loomed, resembling cliffs or perhaps mountain silhouettes.</p><p>More alarmingly, these shadows seemed animate, shifting and disappearing at will.</p><p>From deep within the fog, monstrous roars periodically echoed, suggesting either prior entrants had disturbed beasts, or the creatures roamed freely.</p><p>Qin Sang wasted no time, immediately transforming using the Sky Demon Transformation and summoning his ebony sword for protection.</p><p>He also awakened the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The scene within the fog gave him an idea.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly landed on his shoulder, nuzzling his chin before unfolding its wings and activating its Sky Eye.</p><p>The eyes on its wings came alive, swiveling subtly, creating an eerie effect.</p><p>Using the Sky Eye's power, Qin Sang saw through the fog, focusing on a distant mountain shadow, and finally understood.</p><p>"It's an illusionary realm..."</p><p>He muttered, remembering.</p><p>Among the trials, one was renowned for its illusionary array, the Thousand Mountains Array.</p><p>Legend claimed a complete Thousand Mountains Array was a top-tier ancient illusion array, utilizing countless peaks to form the formation.  Anyone entering would face endless changes, forever lost.</p><p>Of course, the trial wouldn't contain a complete array, only a fragment, but its power remained formidable.</p><p>The Thousand Mountains Array, due to its unpredictable nature, was considered one of the most dangerous trials known.</p><p>Their group had the misfortune of encountering it.</p><p>However, Qin Sang felt no panic.  The Sky Eye Butterfly's ability was a perfect counter to this type of array; as long as he didn't encounter top-tier beasts, escaping the illusion should be relatively easy.</p><p>Qin Sang remained stationary, using his Sky Eye to observe his surroundings.</p><p>In an illusionary array, maintaining composure and avoiding disorientation were crucial.</p><p>This was not a concern for him.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang took his first step.</p><p>The fog parted, revealing a seemingly normal canyon.  Aside from the distant roars, it was eerily quiet; he could even hear the fog shifting.</p><p>After a few steps, the Sky Eye Butterfly clarified the area it had previously observed.</p><p>There were no mountain shadows; they were merely illusions created by the array, appearing and disappearing, all part of the array's trickery.</p><p>After some exploration, Qin Sang grasped the array's methods and increased his pace.</p><p>Soon, he reached the canyon's mouth.</p><p>Suddenly, the fog ahead violently surged, and a hyena-like beast appeared before him, claws extended, lunging at him.</p><p>"An illusion!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered; the Sky Eye Butterfly had already seen through the beast.</p><p>He swung his sword, only to strike empty air.</p><p>The illusory beast was bisected by the ebony sword, shattering instantly.</p><p>Immediately, identical beasts attacked from all sides.</p><p>"Three illusions, one real!"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the beast falling from above was real, surprised.</p><p>He was certain this beast hadn't been there before, appearing out of thin air.  The Thousand Mountains Array not only created illusions, but could also teleport beasts.</p><p>Distinguishing real from fake was impossible without countermeasures.</p><p>Fortunately, the illusions were useless against the Sky Eye.</p><p>Remaining calm, Qin Sang channeled his spiritual energy, unleashing a circular wave that shattered the remaining illusions, then swiftly struck the real beast.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The beast died instantly, its corpse falling to the ground, the stench of blood sharp.</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly ignited a flame, burning the corpse and eliminating the smell, before surveying his surroundings.</p><p>Beyond the canyon, three mountain shadows stood side-by-side, three paths leading to their respective peaks, looking indistinguishable to the naked eye.</p><p>These paths, a mix of real and illusion, require finding the true one.  A cultivator skilled in illusionary formations could analyze the shifts and find the way out, otherwise, it's a matter of trial and error. The rumors are true; the mix of real and illusion here is extremely dangerous.</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, ordering the Sky Eye Butterfly to fully activate its divine ability.</p><p>Soon, the Sky Eye Butterfly eliminated the mountain on the left.  The end of that path was an illusion.</p><p>But to Qin Sang's surprise, the other two mountains were real, without any visible flaws.</p><p>"The Thousand Mountain Formation has more than one exit. I still need to find the correct one among these two?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know much about this place and wasn't sure.  Previously, the Seven Killing Hall only opened about every three hundred years, and the Thousand Mountain Formation appeared even less frequently.  There was little information available; he had to rely on his own exploration.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang walked towards the middle mountain.</p><p>He walked slowly, having the Sky Eye Butterfly observe the surroundings.</p><p>His ebony sword led the way.  He reached the foot of the mountain without encountering any danger.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, looked up at the summit, waited a moment, and stepped onto the first step. At that moment, his eyes flashed, and he suddenly swung his sword at an empty space to his right.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A ferocious beast, before it could even appear, was sent flying by the ebony sword, letting out a whimper before dying instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, a fluctuation appeared on the right.</p><p>"An illusion!"</p><p>Qin Sang nonchalantly waved a burst of spiritual energy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the spiritual energy was easily shattered upon contact.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>"Aoooow!"</p><p>The beast, which should have been an illusion, let out a wolf-like howl, opening its bloody maw and lunging to bite.</p><p>A wave of stench washed over him!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>The Sky Eye divine ability couldn't be wrong.</p><p>But this Thousand Mountain Formation was truly strange, capable of shifting from illusion to reality in an instant, teleporting a real beast upon contact.  A cultivator could easily be severely injured if they weren't careful.</p><p>Fortunately, this beast wasn't strong; it was likely just an appetizer, a warning to those who dared to enter.</p><p>Qin Sang slightly shifted his body, using his ebony sword to kill the beast.</p><p>He stood there for a while, seeing no further changes in the formation, and continued upward.</p><p>At intervals, he was attacked by beasts, sometimes real, sometimes illusions, the real and the fake constantly switching, making it incredibly frustrating. He dared not relax even when facing illusions.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang's pace quickened, until he reached the summit.</p>
