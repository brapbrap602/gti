<h1>Chapter 1200  Save Me</h1><p>Chapter 1200  Save Me</p><p>Information is scarce, and Tan Hao's whereabouts remain a mystery.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang makes a new discovery.  He lowers his head, looking at the floor, and with a flick of his sleeve, moves the cushions, the spirit array, and everything else out of the stone house.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>Qin Sang extends a hand, palm facing the ground, slowly pressing down.</p><p>The patterns in the eyes of the Sky-Eye Butterfly intertwine.</p><p>'Crack… crack…'</p><p>The ground, unable to bear the pressure, develops cracks.</p><p>Suddenly, a surge of dark light erupts, the ground collapses, and the stone house tilts.</p><p>There's something more beneath!</p><p>Qin Sang casually waves his hand, stabilizing the stone house. Twelve Demon Banners continuously whirl around him, ready for any possible change.</p><p>However, the restriction beneath the stone house is unexpectedly weak, far less powerful than the Wu tribe's outer barrier, and clearly set up by a human cultivator.</p><p>"This does match Tan Hao's cultivation level…"</p><p>Qin Sang muses.</p><p>He easily finds the hidden secret beneath the stone house.  Discovering a rather spacious area below, he enters a fissure and slowly descends.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly lands on solid ground.</p><p>His spiritual sense spreads out, taking in the surrounding terrain.</p><p>In the center of the space, there is a strange circular altar.</p><p>Besides that, the entire space is empty. Qin Sang sees some fragments, possibly remnants of artifacts that were once here, destroyed by an impact.</p><p>Only the altar remains intact, and it's obvious it holds some mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang is about to approach the altar when he seems to discover something, pausing, his hand reaching down to grasp a fragment.</p><p>This fragment is exquisite and translucent, as white as jade, without a single blemish.</p><p>"Jade…"</p><p>Qin Sang recalls their incursion into a Tian Shi Sect branch years ago.</p><p>During the eruption of the Earth煞 Qi, he and Yu Daiyue had hidden in the sect's forbidden area, relying on a spirit array with a jade core to survive.</p><p>The fragment's texture is very similar to that jade.</p><p>"Is this a Tian Shi Sect branch? There's no Earth煞 Qi. Could it have all been dissipated by that hundred-year-old event?"</p><p>A thought strikes Qin Sang, and he moves towards the altar.</p><p>The circular altar is engraved with strange patterns.  At its center floats a mass of dark energy, persistently凝而不散, its nature unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang observes it for a while, unable to determine its origin. Hesitating, he sends out a wisp of spiritual sense to tentatively touch the dark energy.</p><p>"Save me…"</p><p>The instant his spiritual sense touches the dark energy, a voice suddenly comes from within.</p><p>The voice is hoarse and unpleasant, like two pieces of metal scraping together, the desperate plea of an old woman parched for countless years.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changes. He immediately cuts off that strand of spiritual sense, the Demon Banners around him fluttering violently.</p><p>The dark energy then returns to normal.</p><p>After waiting for a moment, confirming there's nothing unusual, Qin Sang once again probes with his spiritual sense.</p><p>"Save me…"</p><p>The same voice rings out again.</p><p>Clearly, this is not a newly uttered voice, but one that has continuously existed within the altar, crying for help.</p><p>Qin Sang, bold and skilled, uses his spiritual sense to inquire, but the voice remains unchanged, unresponsive, only repeating its plea.</p><p>"Tan Hao must have found the altar, Chen Heng certainly came here too. They likely saw the person calling for help, or already rescued her."</p><p>Qin Sang thinks to himself.</p><p>Then, he discovers that besides the cries for help, the dark mist contains other words: "Save me, and I will bestow upon you supreme cultivation techniques. I swear on the karmic oath, there will be a reward!"</p><p>"Karmic oath?"</p><p>Qin Sang silently repeats these four words.  It's the first time he's heard of such a thing.</p><p>It sounds similar to a Heart Demon oath, but the words 'karma' are far more mysterious.</p><p>'Karma', this elusive concept, is beyond the reach of Yuan Ying cultivators. Qin Sang has never even heard of it, let alone Tan Hao and Chen Heng. Who knows what a karmic oath is, or if it holds any binding power?</p><p>After these words, the dark energy suddenly churns, then forms an image, quickly reverting to its previous dark form.</p><p>"That outline… it's the entire Tian Hen!"</p><p>Qin Sang instantly memorizes the image, then realizes that a specific location on the Tian Hen image is uniquely marked, likely a guiding marker to the trapped person's location.</p><p>Thus, the picture becomes clear.</p><p>This is most likely a branch of the Tian Shi Sect.</p><p>With the Tian Shi Sect's destruction, the branch has long been abandoned.</p><p>But a mysterious person is trapped here, continuously attempting to call for help. The disturbance a hundred years ago was likely caused by this person, to attract someone to save them.</p><p>Chen Heng was drawn here.</p><p>He certainly obtained the Tian Shi Sect's legacy, but whether he rescued the mysterious person is unknown.</p><p>Tan Hao, finding Chen Heng's belongings, followed the trail, discovered the person's pleas for help, stayed here for a while, then disappeared.</p><p>The marked location might be the main headquarters of the Heavenly Corpse Sect.  The headquarters and branch temples could communicate through these altars, perhaps even remotely triggering their power; ancient texts mention similar things. The sealed mysterious person's nature is unknown; their oath is certainly impressive. However, Tan Hao is desperate to save someone, so regardless of truth or falsehood, he'll certainly try the marked location.</p><p>Now that we have leads on the Heavenly Corpse Sect, Chen Heng's whereabouts are less important.</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed this information, deducing Tan Hao's movements.  His biggest question: why did Tan Hao stay here so long? And where did the Wu tribe's prohibition come from?</p><p>"Tan Hao has rescued the mysterious person, so no one answers me. Then they returned here, using this place as a hideout, resting before leaving... Did the mysterious person leave the prohibition?"</p><p>Qin Sang reasoned, believing this was the only logical explanation.</p><p>The mysterious person either masters Wu tribe secrets, or is of Wu tribe origin!</p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill.  The Northern Star Realm and the other three realms don't have Wu tribe members. Could this person, like Bai, be an ancient Wu tribe expert who has lived until now?  Where are they now?</p><p>As for why the mysterious person was trapped, and their connection to the Heavenly Corpse Sect, Qin Sang couldn't guess. He’ll have to go there himself to find out.</p><p>After much thought, Qin Sang decided to go to the marked location himself.</p><p>He and Tan Hao share the same goal: finding a way to save someone.  He has to retrace Tan Hao's steps.</p><p>Qin Sang is very wary of the mysterious person.</p><p>If the mysterious person is the Heavenly Corpse Sect's ancestor, passing down the sect's lineage, they're likely not righteous.</p><p>However, Tan Hao went first as a scout.  Tan Hao's cultivation is limited; he couldn't perfectly conceal his tracks.  If he visited the marked location, Qin Sang will find traces and make informed decisions.</p><p>Confirming there were no oversights, Qin Sang flew back to the ground, activating his true energy to restore the stone hut's prohibitions and all items.</p><p>He didn't know what Tan Hao did back then, nor his fate.  Worried about Tan Hao's safety (knowing this Tan Hao might be a different person than the one he was investigating), he decided not to leave any message.</p>
