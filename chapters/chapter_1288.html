<h1>Chapter 1280: The Shapeshifting Pearl</h1><p>The army advanced to the foot of Twin Mirror Mountain.</p><p>The scene on Twin Mirror Mountain was quite peculiar. The lower half was covered in a blizzard, consistent with the weather outside.  Spiritual sense could penetrate unimpeded, indicating that the forces of the Abyss had made no preparations here.  However, the scene dramatically changed at the summit. There, a brilliant blue expanse stretched out, the water shimmering like a vast lake inverted over the mountain, enveloping it. Any spiritual sense or other detection method, upon contact with the blue waves, was immediately repelled, blocked from entering. This was clearly a spiritual formation manifesting as an illusion, and the Abyss was prepared for battle.</p><p>Qing Jun tilted her head slightly, observing the formation for a moment before confidently beginning to deploy her troops. She showed no signs of hesitation.  Previously hampered by an evil curse, she had not fully displayed her capabilities, but she had never shirked her responsibility as a cultivator from Little Cold Domain, remaining on the battlefield and participating in nearly every battle against the Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Qing Jun's orders meticulously, and the others, naturally, dared not speak out, each performing their duties.</p><p>As Qing Jun and the others were discussing how to break the formation, a female cultivator from the Skywalk Alliance stepped forward.  "I have a plan," she said, "that might allow us to directly eliminate one of the Abyss' Yuan Ying cultivators."</p><p>The woman possessed a graceful figure and delicate features.  Her every movement was elegant, and she wore a purplish-red qipao, appearing refined and poised.  A captivating fragrance seemed to surround her, refreshing and pleasant.  She looked like a gentle, mature woman. But she was, in fact, a formidable Yuan Ying cultivator.  She and her husband had once been an enviable couple, but unfortunately, her husband had failed to break through to the Yuan Ying stage. She had not remarried since. The ensuing gossip was, however, inevitable.</p><p>"What is your plan, Madam Luo?"</p><p>Upon hearing Madam Luo's words, everyone looked at her.  Her strength, however, was unremarkable among her peers. Her techniques were standard, and she had consistently performed adequately throughout years of warfare, rarely exhibiting any outstanding feats. This was the first time she had volunteered a plan.</p><p>Madam Luo's beautiful eyes flickered as she looked at Qin Sang, covering her mouth with a laugh. "It's not exactly a brilliant plan, but I do have a strategy, it just depends on whether Daoist Qin is willing to participate."</p><p>Madam Luo possessed exceptional beauty and a refined temperament. Her smile was captivating.</p><p>Her words further piqued everyone's curiosity, some looking at Qin Sang with suggestive glances.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely bewildered, having never met Madam Luo before.</p><p>"Madam Luo, please explain. If it's helpful, I will do my utmost."</p><p>Madam Luo nodded. "Daoist Qin's reputation precedes him. You have achieved astonishing feats in battle, but many of the Abyss' cultivators remain unfamiliar with you.  If we can take them by surprise, we might find an opportunity. I am skilled in illusion techniques. I have a Shapeshifting Pearl that could allow you to disguise yourself as me, while I take on your appearance…"</p><p>With that, Madam Luo produced a blue pearl – the Shapeshifting Pearl.</p><p>Madam Luo's plan was clear to everyone. The Abyss would not be wary of Madam Luo, and if a Yuan Ying cultivator could be lured, Qin Sang would have a strong chance of defeating them, given his capabilities. However, this required Qin Sang to impersonate Madam Luo, and his demeanor and actions must be impeccable to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Qin Sang's face twitched slightly.</p><p>"Madam Luo possesses such a technique?  I've never seen you use it before," Jing Lin exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Madam Luo tapped the Shapeshifting Pearl with a jade finger, and a miniature version of herself, expressionless but otherwise identical, appeared within the pearl.</p><p>"This treasure allows for disguise, but it has limitations and can easily be detected. It cannot be used on cultivators stronger than myself.  Cultivators at the same level aren't significantly stronger than me. Although it's claimed that you can transcend your realm of cultivation when challenging stronger opponents, we all know that there's still a considerable gap to bridge.  This technique can only be used once, so I've kept it hidden until now, waiting for the right opportunity.  With Daoist Qin, an anomaly who could defeat Ye Laomo's incarnation at the Yuan Ying initial stage, this plan should be extremely effective!"</p><p>Madam Luo smiled at Qin Sang.  "Daoist Qin, remember, have Daoist Leng use the formation to provide cover. As soon as you encounter a Yuan Ying cultivator from the Abyss, strike without hesitation, and don't let them become suspicious. Moreover, we need to practice, mimicking each other's mannerisms. If we reveal ourselves in this way, it will all be for nothing."</p><p>…</p><p>Qing Jun led the troops up the mountain.</p><p>Two armies faced each other, the Double Mirror Mountain remaining deathly silent.</p><p>Qing Jun ordered the deployment of a large formation, making final preparations while simultaneously preventing any observation from cultivators on Double Mirror Mountain.  Qin Sang and Madam Luo, under the cover of others, secretly entered a snow cave.</p><p>Qin Sang opened her mouth to speak, but then saw Madam Luo raise her hand. A white light flew from a magical item, revealing Madam Luo's illusory double.</p><p>As the illusion approached, Qin Sang felt a surge within, suppressing her inner energy.  Upon the illusion's possession, she felt no abnormalities, but only upon using a water-based mirror technique did she realize her appearance had drastically changed; she had become another Madam Luo.</p><p>However, her demeanor and expressions were stiff and uncoordinated. Even without specialized vision, it was clear the transformation was fake.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively touched her chest; the feeling was surprisingly soft, almost identical to the real thing. It was a remarkably skillful illusion.</p><p>Turning her head, she noticed Madam Luo, who had somehow assumed Qin Sang's appearance, looking at her with an odd expression.</p><p>Qin Sang cleared her throat, examining Madam Luo, and complimented, "Madam Luo, you are quite handsome."</p><p>Madam Luo covered her mouth and chuckled softly, "Madam Qin, you are quite beautiful."</p><p>The awkwardness eased, and the two began to mimic each other's mannerisms.  Qin Sang's imitation was easy; Madam Luo needed only to maintain a stoic demeanor as a man, standing beside Qing Jun, assisting her with the spirit array, without raising suspicion.</p><p>Madam Luo's inherent charm wasn't so easily concealed, especially since Qin Sang needed to infiltrate the enemy's camp to find her target, allowing no flaws.</p><p>Fortunately, Yuan Ying cultivators had incredibly precise control over their bodies. With patient practice and Madam Luo's dedicated guidance, Qin Sang made rapid progress.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was perfecting her posture, Qing Jun unexpectedly arrived.</p><p>Her gaze shifted, recognizing Madam Luo as Qin Sang. Her beautiful eyes widened, a subtle smile playing on her lips, "Junior Sister, you are quite striking."</p><p>"Thank you for the compliment."</p><p>The real Madam Luo laughed uproariously.</p><p>"To complete the act, this is my usual treasured item, a Kirin hairpin. Madam Qin, like myself, cultivates wood-elemental inner energy. Using the inscription I've left, you won't need special refinement; you can wield about 70% of its power. You can freely activate it until the inscription's power is depleted.  Being cautious within the enemy's spirit array is expected; they shouldn't suspect anything…"</p><p>Madam Luo handed Qin Sang a jade hairpin, similar in overall appearance to an ordinary phoenix hairpin, but one end was carved with a vivid, lifelike green Kirin.</p>
