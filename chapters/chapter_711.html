<h1>Chapter 703: The Signal</h1><p>“Perhaps,”</p><p>The stout cultivator chuckled wryly.  “The sea around this island is vast.  A thorough patrol will take a considerable amount of time. Should we split up, or stick together?”</p><p>“I believe it’s best to stay together, as we did on our arrival. We can watch each other’s backs and conduct a more thorough search,” the scholar in green robes calmly replied.</p><p>“Agreed! Let’s stick together!”</p><p>The stout cultivator readily agreed. “Time is of the essence. Let’s not waste any more time, let’s get going.”</p><p>Just as they were about to set off, the thin old man suddenly turned, frowning. “Qin, what are you doing?”</p><p>Everyone then noticed that while they were discussing the patrol, Qin Sang had been crouching at the edge of the cold mist, holding a plant frozen into an ice ball, intently observing something.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, pulled up another plant from the ground, and said, “Has anyone noticed anything strange about this cold mist? When I use my true essence to dispel it, it doesn't feel like simple cold air; it's more like my true essence is being consumed by spirit fire.  Furthermore, I've discovered something odd. Look…”</p><p>With a flash of true essence from his fingertips, Qin Sang melted the ice on the surface of the herb.</p><p>The herb then visibly lost its green color, turning into something like black ash.  Qin Sang flicked his wrist, and it vanished into dust.</p><p>Everyone watching was amazed.</p><p>“Qin's observation is meticulous. I've been here once before and didn't notice anything unusual about the mist,” the stout cultivator bent down, pulled up a blade of grass, and crushed it in his hand, turning it to ash.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, saying nothing.</p><p>A female cultivator chopped down an ice tree; once the ice melted, the same thing happened.</p><p>Witnessing this bizarre phenomenon, everyone was speechless.</p><p>“There’s something wrong with the mist. If it were ordinary cold air, it would only freeze the plants to death; it wouldn't turn them into this,” the female cultivator said gravely.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, the stout cultivator could only chuckle wryly. “I've sworn an oath on my inner demon; everything I said before is true, yet you still don't believe me. After entering the cave, I didn't encounter this situation, and I dared not deplete my true essence inside, allowing the cold mist to invade my body.  If you feel your true essence is being depleted too much, just retreat.”</p><p>“Perhaps the strangeness of the cold mist is what attracted the Yuan Ying Grandmaster to establish his cave here?”</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>Unable to find any clues, they temporarily abandoned their investigation, concealed themselves, and left the island to patrol the surrounding waters.</p><p>Their search was thorough, including the area beneath the surface of the sea.</p><p>Returning to the island, they found that the cold mist had expanded outward.  Without wasting time, after a brief discussion, they jointly set up a warning formation and headed towards the cave together.</p><p>The formation at the cave entrance seemed only to seal the cold mist and did not obstruct their entry.</p><p>The cave had man-made stone steps.  Dense cold mist obscured their vision inside; they couldn't see anything.</p><p>The stout cultivator led the way, followed by pairs of cultivators walking side-by-side. Qin Sang volunteered to be in the rear with the thin old man, maintaining a short distance between them so they could vaguely see each other's movements even in the mist.</p><p>The moment they entered the cave, everyone involuntarily gasped.</p><p>The cold mist inside was far more potent than outside.  Everyone shivered, quickly using their true essence to protect themselves; noticing how quickly their true essence was being consumed, they urged the stout cultivator to hurry.</p><p>The stout cultivator didn’t hesitate, walking quickly deeper into the cave, followed closely by the others.</p><p>The cave was unusually winding; the deeper they went, the more spacious it became, unlike the tight entrance. They spread out slightly, wielding their respective magical treasures, vigilantly looking towards the cave's depths.</p><p>Qin Sang took out three Ten Directions Yama Banners at once.</p><p>He formed them into an array, quickly storing them again. Though the appearance was fleeting, the sudden surge and then disappearance of demonic fire aura was detected by others.</p><p>Someone turned their head, but they didn't see the banners clearly and weren't sure, so they looked away.</p><p>"Your magical treasure seems extraordinary,"</p><p>Qin Sang heard the thin old man's voice transmission and glanced sideways, calmly saying, “You flatter me. My cultivation is the lowest among you; I only recently broke through to the Core Formation stage a few years ago.  Fortunately, I have a fairly powerful magical treasure, which allows me to stand my ground in the Demon Sea.  Magical treasures are ultimately external; cultivation is the foundation.”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke truthfully. The thin old man chuckled, saying nothing more.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang held the Ten Directions Yama Banner, a wisp of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire swirling around his fingertip, his expression calm.</p><p>But doubts swirled in his mind.</p><p>Just now, when he deployed the Ten Directions Yama Banner and secretly activated the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, he noticed something unusual. The fire seemed to sense something, exhibiting signs of unrest.  This had never happened in all the time he'd possessed the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang curled his fingers, trying his best to soothe it, but the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire remained agitated. It wasn't the joyous reaction of encountering a similar flame; it felt more like facing a rival, eager for annihilation.</p><p>Previously, the strongest cultivator Qin Sang had encountered who wielded a similar flame was a Golden Core cultivator from the Qingyang Demon Sect. This person cultivated the Qingyang Demon Fire, and Qin Sang had fought him using the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.  Back then, his flame hadn’t reacted like this.</p><p>Could it be that the previous opponent was too weak, beneath the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's notice?</p><p>"Could some powerful flame be hidden deep within the cold mist, even stronger than the Qingyang Demon Fire wielded by Wu Youdao?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, his gaze flickering as he stared towards the end of the cave.</p><p>If a flame comparable in power to the Ancestral Saint Fire truly existed within the cave, it would explain why even the hide of a transformed-stage demon beast had been so quickly corroded.</p><p>But equally, such a dangerous place was certainly beyond the capabilities of Gold Core cultivators like them to explore.</p><p>"This man is hiding something."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe the short, stout cultivator had revealed everything he knew.  There was definitely something concealed, though it might not be about the flame.  Facing such power, any trickery would be useless.  The stout cultivator had come in as well; anyone daring to covet the flame wouldn't escape.</p><p>But Qin Sang still couldn't confirm his suspicions. The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was inanimate and couldn't provide clear information.</p><p>"For now, the cold mist's power seems manageable. Let's see what kind of restriction guards the first level of this cave abode."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, retracting the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire into the banner, his eyes fixed on the short, stout cultivator's back.</p>
