<h1>Chapter 625: The Witch Tribe's Gift</h1><p>This world is full of mysteries!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>He wondered if the storms surrounding the Tempest Sea, like the ancient immortal battlefield, were also remnants of a great battle between ancient powers.</p><p>Were there also hidden realms, ancient ruins, and treasures left behind?</p><p>If he had the chance, he'd like to take a look at the edge of the storm.</p><p>After examining the map, Qin Sang felt a sense of stability, as if an anchor had settled in his heart.</p><p>As for a detailed chart of the Tempest Sea, he wasn't in a hurry. Once he left the Western Frontier and made contact with powerful cultivators from the Witch Continent or the Human Realm, obtaining one wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>The Witch Continent, the Tempest Sea, the Stormy Demon Sea...</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure where to go yet. He decided to stay in the Western Frontier for the time being and make plans later.</p><p>Withdrawing his divine sense from the map, Qin Sang opened another jade slip.</p><p>The jade slip contained the Five Insects Sect's true inheritance of insect control techniques.</p><p>After reading the contents, a look of surprise crossed Qin Sang's face. He quickly opened the final jade slip and studied it carefully for a long time before putting it away, lost in thought.</p><p>The Witch Tribe’s insect and gu system was completely different from that of the Small Cold Realm. It wasn't just the difference between the Witch Insect List and the Strange Insect List, but also the way they identified and cultivated spirit insects, which was fundamentally different.</p><p>Spirit insects possessed strength comparable to Qi Refining stage cultivators from birth.</p><p>In the Small Cold Realm, it was commonly believed that a spirit insect's first transformation, similar to a cultivator establishing their foundation, was its first metamorphosis. After this transformation, their strength greatly increased, becoming comparable to Foundation Establishment cultivators or Demon Spirit stage demonic beasts.</p><p>However, the Witch Tribe considered a spirit insect's birth to be its first metamorphosis. Humans had a mortal stage before Qi Refining, but these spirit insects possessed extraordinary power from birth. They must have undergone a transformation before hatching.</p><p>After the first metamorphosis, they were similar to cultivators in the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>The second metamorphosis corresponded to the Foundation Establishment stage…</p><p>The third metamorphosis corresponded to the Core Formation stage…</p><p>And so on, up to the ninth metamorphosis, where they would transcend tribulation and become immortals!</p><p>In Witch Tribe mythology, there was a legend of a spirit silkworm that became an immortal after nine metamorphoses. This spirit silkworm was the Witch God's gu insect, although whether it was the Witch God's lifeblood gu was uncertain.</p><p>Comparing the two different systems, Qin Sang felt that the Spirit Control Sect and the Small Cold Realm's understanding of spirit insects was inferior to that of the Witch Tribe. After all, there weren't many cultivators specializing in insect control, and spirit insects were rare in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Although there was a lot of knowledge from ancient texts, with many insightful points, it wasn't systematic, more like a hodgepodge of information pieced together by later generations.</p><p>In comparison, the Witch Tribe’s system was more complete, their insect control techniques more detailed, with a long and rich history, making it more credible.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to follow the Witch Tribe's system in the future, integrating the Spirit Control Sect's knowledge into it.</p><p>Although the Spirit Control Sect’s knowledge wasn't as comprehensive as the Witch Tribe's, it contained many insights gleaned from ancient texts found in the ancient immortal battlefield, representing the wisdom of ancient cultivators, which the Witch Tribe lacked.</p><p>Among them, the most valuable were the methods for cultivating several precious strange insects and assisting their metamorphoses.</p><p>These strange insects were extinct in the Small Cold Realm. He wondered if he could find them in the Witch Continent.</p><p>However, all of this was within his expectations. What truly intrigued Qin Sang was the lifeblood gu.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang’s understanding of the Witch Tribe was superficial. He thought they were not much different from humans, even their cultivation was largely similar, requiring them to absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth, and following the same path of Foundation Establishment and Core Formation.</p><p>The only exception was the Witch Tribe’s lifeblood gu, which he had never seen before.</p><p>Only after reading the jade slip did he learn that the Witch Tribe possessed an innate affinity for nature, a gift that allowed them to communicate with nature and easily interact with spirit insects, a gift that humans lacked.</p><p>Even ordinary people of the Witch Tribe were skilled in insect control, almost as if it were instinctive.</p><p>When Qin Sang was hiding in the Thousand Households Village, he had seen ordinary people raising poisonous insects.</p><p>Some ordinary people, through chance encounters, might even gain the recognition of a transformed spirit insect. It wasn't impossible for a careless cultivator to be killed by an ordinary person.</p><p>It was this gift that allowed the Witch Tribe to develop the lifeblood gu secret technique.</p><p>By cultivating the lifeblood gu secret technique, at the sixth level of Qi Refining, a cultivator could subdue a spirit insect, store it in their Qi Sea, connect their minds with it, and nourish it with their blood essence.</p><p>Some cultivation methods required refining a special magical tool before the Core Formation stage, to be used in conjunction with the cultivation method. This could be considered a lifeblood magical tool, similar to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>However, the “Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter” was unique, allowing cultivators to nurture a sword with their primordial spirit at a low cultivation level, which was unheard of.</p><p>There were also cultivators like Mu Yifeng, who chose a specific magical tool, kept it with them constantly, and did everything possible to enhance it, continuing to upgrade it to a magical treasure after Core Formation, treating it as their lifeblood magical treasure.</p><p>But if one chose the lifeblood gu path, none of this could be done.</p><p>After Core Formation, the lifeblood gu would also occupy the place of the lifeblood magical treasure.</p><p>The lifeblood magical treasure was crucial for cultivators.</p><p>Without a lifeblood magical treasure, if a cultivator failed to cultivate their lifeblood gu successfully, their strength would be greatly affected, far weaker than cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>Moreover, there was a greater risk.</p><p>After refining a spirit insect into a lifeblood gu, the cultivator needed to nourish it with their blood essence. It was also known as a blood gu. Over time, the more blood the lifeblood gu devoured, the more ferocious and violent its nature would become, increasing the risk of it devouring its master.</p><p>The original consciousness of the gu couldn't be erased, otherwise, it would become a dead gu, losing its vitality and unable to improve further, becoming useless.</p><p>Due to their innate gift, Witch Tribe cultivators could appease the gu, having greater control over their lifeblood gu.</p><p>Human cultivators could also cultivate the Witch Tribe's lifeblood gu technique, but lacking this gift, they faced significant limitations. Once the lifeblood gu reached the same cultivation level as themselves, they would lose control.</p><p>In this case, the most valuable benefit of painstakingly cultivating a lifeblood gu would be unattainable, making it a burden.</p><p>Because the lifeblood gu had a remarkable benefit – it could assist in breaking through bottlenecks!</p><p>It was even effective in breaking through major realms like Foundation Establishment and Core Formation!</p><p>When a cultivator reached the Pseudo Core Formation stage, if they also cultivated their lifeblood gu to the peak of the second metamorphosis, merging with it during their Core Formation attempt would increase their chances of success.</p><p>The lifeblood gu’s cultivation had to be equal to the cultivator's for this to work, otherwise it would have no effect.</p><p>Furthermore, if the lifeblood gu could reach the third metamorphosis before its master, the effect would be even better.</p><p>Of course, the risk of being devoured would also be greater!</p><p>Even if human cultivators stole the Witch Tribe's lifeblood gu secret technique, they wouldn't dare to let their lifeblood gu surpass their own cultivation. Only Witch Tribe cultivators, relying on their innate gift, dared to do so, albeit with constant vigilance against being devoured by their lifeblood gu.</p><p>It was said that this effect persisted even during Nascent Soul formation!</p><p>There was even a legend of a Witch Tribe elder who, based on the lifeblood gu, embarked on another path, a very sinister one.</p><p>This was a rumor from outside. Because it was so shocking, cultivators in the Western Frontier doubted its veracity.</p><p>The person in the rumor was surnamed Fang. His lifeblood gu had reached the fourth metamorphosis ahead of him.</p><p>But he was unlucky. Even with the help of his lifeblood gu, he failed several times to form his Nascent Soul. Finally, with his lifespan nearing its end and no hope of forming his Nascent Soul, he abandoned his physical body and fused his primordial spirit with his lifeblood gu!</p>
