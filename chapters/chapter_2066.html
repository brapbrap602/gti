<h1>Chapter 2057: The Man in the Ear</h1><p>“This person must be the mysterious expert that the Si You clansman spoke of…”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave.  He hadn't expected that capturing two Si You clansmen would not only involve so many Void Refinement experts, but also have a late Void Refinement cultivator presiding!</p><p>This indicated that the identities of the two Si You clansmen were definitely not simple.</p><p>Now wasn't the time to delve into this. Even if the opponent was such a powerful expert, since he had already made his move, the arrow was on the string and had to be fired. It was impossible to give up at this point.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. Although the mysterious expert had released his oppressive aura from afar, judging by his escape technique, it was impossible for him to instantly cross the vast sea between them. This was his opportunity.</p><p>As long as Su Nu and the Si You clansman could reach safety before the opponent arrived, he could use his Lightning Escape to flee.</p><p>However, before that, Qin Sang had to make sure he wasn't entangled by the two opponents in front of him. If he were to be surrounded by all three, even with his exceptional escape technique, he would have no room to maneuver.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of wind interrupted Qin Sang’s thoughts.</p><p>The twang of the bowstring sounded as if it were right beside his ear. A silver streak shot towards his face. Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, keenly aware that this arrow was different from before.</p><p>Que Li had also sensed Elder Quan’s aura and changed her strategy accordingly.</p><p>She hadn't desperately tried to stop Su Nu before, partly because Qin Sang’s strength was truly astonishing, and partly because she was waiting for this opportunity. If she couldn't keep the Si You Clan’s young master, she would keep Qin Sang, forcing his accomplice to come and rescue him!</p><p>Que Li, who had been retreating steadily, suddenly stopped and stomped her foot on the sea surface below.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Waves surged. Amidst the spray, the seawater transformed into a blue Qilin-scaled dragon, majestic and awe-inspiring, raising its head and rushing out of the sea.</p><p>The blue dragon roared, flying to Que Li’s feet and allowing her to step onto its head. Then, it transformed into a streak of blue light, soaring into the sky.</p><p>At the same time, Que Li had somehow changed to a larger, more exquisite blue bow. Riding the blue dragon, she looked down from above. The bowstring in her hand twanged continuously, arrows flying like a torrential storm. Some shot towards Qin Sang, while others shot into empty space, exploding mid-air.</p><p>The fragments of the spiritual arrows didn't dissipate as usual. Like willow catkins in the wind, they danced freely in the air.</p><p>Surrounded by them, Qin Sang instinctively felt something was amiss. Then, he felt a heavy pressure coming from all directions, pressing down on him alone, causing his breath to hitch.</p><p>If someone were looking down from high above, they would see a vast expanse of blue, with a giant water sphere appearing out of thin air, enveloping Qin Sang within.</p><p>Within the water sphere, streaks of silver light continuously swam. Que Li’s arrow-shooting speed increased even further, and with each draw of the bow, dozens of silver streaks shot out.</p><p>These silver streaks plunged into the water sphere and instantly transformed into silver needlefish. Their slender heads were as sharp as arrowheads, frantically attacking Qin Sang.</p><p>They were all formed from the purest water elemental energy, and the water elemental energy here was inexhaustible. Moreover, within the water sphere, they seemed to gain some kind of enhancement, swarming together with considerable power. Qin Sang was overwhelmed, dispersing one group only to have more needlefish immediately replenish their ranks. At the same time, he had to endure the increasing pressure, feeling like a lone boat in the sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the sword formation.</p><p>Ji Qiong didn't know the situation outside, but he calculated that Elder Quan should be arriving soon after receiving the warning.</p><p>Just now, relying on his Divine Ear technique, he had already heard some fluctuations that ordinary people couldn't detect. However, he wasn't in a hurry to counterattack. He gently rubbed his right ear, and ripples of gray energy荡漾ed outwards.</p><p>These ripples were unaffected by the sword stars, spreading out from him as the center, through the starry sky.  No matter how the sword light slashed, it couldn’t erase them.</p><p>Then, Ji Qiong flicked his sleeve, throwing out a black seed. This seed was melon-shaped, the size of a fingernail, and its origin was unknown. Upon contact with the ripples, it immediately took root and sprouted in the void, extending thin vines.</p><p>These vines swayed and wriggled, as agile as snakes, actively exploring in all directions, growing at a visible speed. After merging with the ripples, they spread outwards even faster, filling a section of the starry sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A sword star was entangled by a vine and instantly dimmed, its starlight completely obscured by the dense net woven by the vines.</p><p>Sword light rained down, constantly slashing, but the vines grew even faster, showing no signs of stopping. At this rate, the entire starry sky would become the domain of the vines, and the sword stars would be completely surrounded.</p><p>Ji Qiong smiled confidently, his figure quietly disappearing. Under the cover of the vines, he rushed towards a fluctuation he had heard with his Divine Ear.</p><p>His intention coincided with Que Li's. He not only wanted to break the formation but also wanted the vines to take root in the starry sky, sealing the sword formation and trapping Qin Sang's spiritual swords within, making it impossible for him to retrieve them!</p><p>At that time, if Qin Sang wanted to escape, he would have to abandon his spiritual swords, which for a sword cultivator was no different from severing an arm!</p><p>Just as Ji Qiong thought he had succeeded, he suddenly felt an unfamiliar fluctuation descend, and at the same time, the sword formation’s structure changed drastically.</p><p>Knowing that Qin Sang must have seen through his scheme and started to counterattack, Ji Qiong wouldn't give him the chance. He immediately pushed his Divine Ear technique to the limit, and the vines were about to cover the entire starry sky.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the change in the formation far exceeded Ji Qiong’s expectations. Dazzling starlight shone through the gaps between the vines, and the vines’ frantic growth was instantly suppressed, coming to an abrupt halt.</p><p>The number of sword stars had doubled. Ji Qiong’s eyes narrowed slightly, a dangerous premonition arising in his heart. Then, he heard the roar of a tiger and the cry of a phoenix, and the sky suddenly brightened, showering down vast starlight.</p><p>Countless vines shattered. Within the starlight, there seemed to be a terrifying beast, or a peerless sword light, cleaving heaven and earth.</p><p>Overwhelmed by the might, Ji Qiong felt as if all the blood in his body had solidified. His mind was shaken, and he was secretly shocked.</p><p>The power of this sword far exceeded his expectations. Ji Qiong no longer had the composure he had before. In his urgency, he no longer cared about entangling Qin Sang and hurriedly changed his hand seals.</p><p>‘Swish, swish, swish!’</p><p>The vines surged wildly.</p><p>Waves of gray surged above Ji Qiong. Layers upon layers of vines intertwined, forming multiple barriers to block the fierce sword light.</p><p>Just then, a deafening roar of a strange beast suddenly came from the horizon.</p><p>Faint cold light lit up the four corners of the sky. In an instant, a biting cold wind swept across heaven and earth.</p><p>Four pillars had appeared at the four corners of the sky. Upon closer inspection, they turned out to be four Frost Serpents, opening their bloody maws and spewing cold air towards the sky.</p><p>Heavy snow fell from the sky, transforming the area into a domain of extreme cold.</p><p>‘Crack, crack, crack…’</p><p>Ice rapidly spread along the vines. The originally agile vines became slow and stiff until they were completely covered in a layer of hard ice, frozen solid.</p><p>In a moment, the world was covered in silver, and the frozen vines lay there stiffly.</p><p>Ji Qiong's plan to block the sword light with the vines naturally failed.</p><p>Trapped within the sword formation, isolated from the outside world, he hadn't seen Qin Sang summon his Dharma Idol and didn't know the situation outside. From his perspective, Qin Sang was fighting one against two, and their cultivation levels were similar. He believed that with Que Li's strength, she could definitely hold Qin Sang back. The fact that Qin Sang had only used the sword formation to trap him and hadn't launched any other attacks seemed to confirm this speculation.</p><p>Logically, Qin Sang shouldn't have the time to deal with his counterattack, but the reality before him couldn't be denied.</p><p>The situation suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse, and Ji Qiong was greatly alarmed. In his haste, he could only activate the protective treasure he had used before.</p><p>Then, he heard a crisp cracking sound. The protective treasure only held for an instant before being shattered by the sword light!</p><p>In his desperation, Ji Qiong didn't have time to cast any major divine abilities. He continuously threw out various treasures, but to no avail.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Qin Sang was currently using the Cascading Formation technique.  After his battle with the two Palace Lords of the Li Yu Palace, Qin Sang had identified his own shortcomings and, after dedicated contemplation, had refined the Cascading Formation technique to near perfection. Its power was naturally incomparable to its previous state and could not be resisted by ordinary means.</p><p>The sword light swept through everything, shattering all obstacles in its path, closing in on him!</p><p>No, it was no longer simply sword light, but the Grey Warbler Sword, channeling the power of the entire sword formation, aimed to kill Ji Qiong!</p><p>Ji Qiong's eyes widened. There were no barriers left in front of him, and the aura of death was imminent.</p><p>At the last moment, Ji Qiong struggled to unleash a divine ability, but the profound light formed by the divine ability was instantly pierced through.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>An earth-shattering wave erupted in the void.</p><p>Que Li, who was fiercely attacking Qin Sang, couldn’t help but turn her head, witnessing a scene that horrified her.</p><p>The void enveloped by the sword formation, originally filled with obscure energy, now transformed entirely into a sword.</p><p>Ji Qiong appeared beneath the sword tip, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>“Brother Ji!”</p><p>Que Li exclaimed, quickly turning her longbow and aiming it at the Grey Warbler Sword, but it was already too late.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Quan, who was flying at full speed from the distant sea, also saw this scene from afar and was instantly enraged.</p><p>“Insolent!”</p><p>His voice resounded across the world, filled with滔tian fury.</p><p>Qin Sang remained deaf to his words.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword pierced through Ji Qiong’s crown, passing through his body. Ji Qiong appeared unharmed, but his eyes were fixed, motionless.</p><p>Then, blood seeped from his brow, a line of blood appearing precisely between his eyebrows. His body swayed slightly, splitting in two, blood and internal organs spraying out.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>Qin Sang was also slightly surprised. He hadn’t expected his opponent to be slain with a single sword strike. The power of the Cascading Formation was even stronger than he had anticipated.</p><p>Que Li’s pupils constricted, and the hand holding the blue bow trembled slightly. Fear crept into her heart.  Her opponent, clearly at the same realm as them, could not only fight one against two but had also killed Ji Qiong. Such strength was simply too shocking.</p><p>Now, she was alone against him…</p><p>Elder Quan, watching from afar, witnessed Ji Qiong’s death but was unable to prevent it.  He was instantly filled with rage. His expression, however, was unusually calm, his eyes desolate.  Only the bulging veins on his hands, tightly gripping his walking stick, revealed his inner fury.</p><p>Suddenly, Elder Quan's figure paused for a moment, the black and white of his eyes completely consumed by white.</p><p>Within the white eyeballs, only a pinprick-sized black dot remained, staring coldly at Qin Sang.  His lips moved slightly, silently reciting a few incantations. The senility on Elder Quan deepened, and he visibly aged, seeming to have paid a considerable price.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang felt a sense of danger for no apparent reason and couldn't help but look up at the sky.</p><p>The bright sun hung high in the clear blue sky.</p><p>In the next moment, a long crack appeared in the sky, filled with chaotic scenes. A stone tablet fell from within.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed an immense threat from the stone tablet. Before he could examine it closely, another unexpected change occurred.</p><p>A ripple of gray suddenly appeared in a nearby patch of void beside the battlefield, rippling outwards in successive waves. A strange aura revived at the center of the ripples.</p><p>The ripples gradually took on the shape of an ear.  Then, with a flash of white light, a tiny figure jumped out. The figure was the size of a mung bean, stark naked, yet with complete facial features and limbs.</p><p>The little figure had a look of lingering fear, his eyes filled with terror. He didn't even dare to look back, quickly escaping into the distance, shouting,</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Que Li, hold him back for me!”</p><p>“Brother Ji?” Que Li’s surprise turned to joy.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the small figure with astonishment.  The figure's aura was completely different from Ji Qiong’s, yet there was an inexplicable connection between them, as if they were one. He didn't know what kind of existence this was.</p><p>Clearly, Ji Qiong hadn't perished. This was likely a life-saving technique of the Quan Feng Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't let him go easily. His Dharma Idol immediately summoned the Grey Warbler Sword, slashing through the air.</p><p>Que Li, who had just tried to rescue Ji Qiong, had slowed her attack, and Qin Sang’s main body seized this fleeting opportunity. He disregarded Que Li entirely, ignoring the stone tablet in the sky and charging straight towards the small figure.</p><p>Que Li couldn’t just watch Ji Qiong perish before her eyes. Even if not for the camaraderie between their clans, she needed to join forces with Ji Qiong to have the confidence to continue facing Qin Sang.</p><p>She pushed off with her foot, and the blue dragon transformed into a streak of blue light, shooting towards the small figure.  At the same time, she drew her bow and fired, each arrow aimed at Qin Sang’s vital points.</p><p>The small figure didn't look back, running frantically. As he fled, his aura continuously climbed, but then his expression faltered. He hadn’t felt the same powerful pressure from the Grey Warbler Sword as before. After a moment's thought, he seemed to realize something and shouted urgently, “Careful, it’s a trick!”</p><p>At this moment, the blue light formed by the blue dragon had transformed into a screen of light, protecting the small figure.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword pierced through, only causing the light screen to ripple, but it failed to break through.</p><p>Que Li paused, also realizing something. From the corner of her eye, she saw a five-colored light shoot out from Qin Sang's Dharma Idol's sleeve, seemingly originating from a crown.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang’s main body also went all out, sweeping his hand and shattering all the incoming arrows. A counter-shock force transmitted through the blue bow, causing her arm to tremble involuntarily.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body and Dharma Idol coordinated seamlessly. This momentary opening was fleeting, and the five-colored light had already been unleashed.</p><p>It was the Five Elements Restrictive Divine Light, focused on restriction. Since Que Li had channeled her protective energy to the small figure, she couldn't react in time, freezing in place. Her consciousness remained, but she found that all her treasures were unusable.  Panic filled her heart as she saw another five-colored divine light approaching.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The same five-colored light gave Que Li a completely different premonition, a sense of extreme danger surging through her heart.</p><p>A struggle flashed in her eyes, and a shrill cry escaped her throat. Forced to use her clan’s strongest life-saving secret technique, she reversed her blood flow, her entire body splitting and cracking as dense fish scales sprouted.</p><p>The silver fish scales were stained with blood, emitting a demonic sheen. They appeared incredibly smooth, forcibly pulling her body upwards, protecting her vital points. The Reverse Five Elements Restrictive Divine Light struck the silver scales and was slightly deflected.</p><p>Unfortunately, Que Li ultimately couldn't dodge completely. The Reverse Five Elements Divine Light struck her chest squarely.</p><p>In an instant, silver scales flew everywhere, and a bloody hole appeared in her chest!</p>
