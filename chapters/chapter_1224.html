<h1>Chapter 1216: A Plea for Help</h1><p>Qin Sang had been too focused on fleeing to give much thought to the Blood Lake. The fact that the old demon Ye wasn’t on the frontlines but instead lurking in the Blood Lake suggested he had some ulterior motive. During their confrontation with Ye and his allies, Qin Sang had sensed that Jiang Chenzi and the others were desperate to keep them all there, not allowing a single one to escape.</p><p>After Qin Sang revealed himself, their side had demonstrated the strength of three experts comparable to mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators. Even the Cold Lizard wasn’t far behind, and it, along with the Lu family cultivator, was skilled in joint attack techniques. Although the Sin Abyss side had similar numbers, apart from the unfathomable old demon Ye, their strength was lackluster, relying only on three precious banners. Even with the malevolent spirits aiding them, it was unrealistic for them to try to keep all four of Qin Sang’s group there. Unless, of course, they were trying to conceal some secret.</p><p>Thinking this way, the Blood Lake was definitely no ordinary place. However, Qin Sang hadn’t expected the Blood Lake to be connected to the Boundless Valley. He suddenly recalled the blood miasma at the outskirts of the Boundless Valley, which blocked the entire entrance. The blood miasma was fraught with dangers. Back when he and Wandering Cloud entered the Boundless Valley, both of them had Foundation Establishment cultivation, and they still needed a guide to lead them through the perilous journey. Could the blood miasma be related to the Blood Lake?</p><p>Qin Sang called out Fatty Chicken and gestured for it to continue.</p><p>“The Blood Lake is located deep within the third layer of the Boundless Valley. After my mother achieved her transformation, she moved her dwelling to the Boundless Valley and became very familiar with the area. However, even she had to be extremely cautious when approaching the Blood Lake. I heard from her…” Fatty Chicken hesitated for a moment before cautiously adding, “That Blood Mulberry Tree of Endless Sorrow was born in the Blood Lake.”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled as he glanced at Fatty Chicken. Back then, it was he who had snatched the treasure from Fatty Chicken, not the other way around. He didn’t understand why Fatty Chicken was so nervous. The Blood Mulberry Tree of Endless Sorrow actually originated from the Blood Lake. It seemed the Blood Lake was indeed a treasure trove, but whether the old demon Ye was simply there to seek treasures or had other motives remained unclear.</p><p>“Are you suggesting that the Blood Lake in the Boundless Valley is connected to the one in the Abyssal Ruins? Did your mother ever mention what kind of place the Blood Lake is?” Qin Sang asked in return.</p><p>Fatty Chicken recalled, “The aura of this Blood Lake is identical to that of the Boundless Valley, so there must be a deep connection. But back then, my cultivation was too low, and my mother didn’t tell me much about the Blood Lake.” After a pause, Fatty Chicken hesitated, then gritted its teeth and said, “Master, I have a favor to ask of you…”</p><p>“Is it about your mother?” Qin Sang asked with a faint smile.</p><p>“Master, you already knew?” Fatty Chicken was stunned.</p><p>Qin Sang replied leisurely, “Heh, I’ve been waiting to see how long you could hold out.”</p><p>Fatty Chicken was the offspring of a transformed demon king, a genuine second-generation demon. With a demon king mother protecting it, it could have roamed freely in the cultivation world, as human cultivators would avoid provoking such a creature. Its own talent wasn’t bad either, on the verge of breaking through to the late-stage Demon Core realm, with hopes of transformation. With such a background and talent, it was unlikely that Fatty Chicken would have developed such a submissive, cunning, and shameless personality. It seemed more like Fatty Chicken had been struggling on its own, enduring the harsh realities of the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang had long suspected that the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon Demon King might have met with some misfortune. Otherwise, how could Fatty Chicken have fallen to such a state? Alternatively, the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon Demon King might have been ruthless enough to kick Fatty Chicken out to fend for itself. However, this matter didn’t concern Qin Sang, and it might involve some hidden secrets. Since Fatty Chicken hadn’t brought it up, Qin Sang didn’t feel it was his place to pry.</p><p>Fatty Chicken awkwardly explained, “My mother disappeared shortly after I hatched. Fortunately, she left me a few treasures before she left, which allowed me to successfully form my core and reach my current level of cultivation. I had planned to follow you, Master, and earn some merits before shamelessly asking for your help. I never expected to encounter the Blood Lake here…”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “Did your mother disappear in the Blood Lake?”</p><p>“Back then, my mother suddenly told me that the ancient restrictions of the Blood Lake had loosened, and strange phenomena had appeared. She decided to enter the lake to investigate. After that, I waited in our dwelling for a long time, but she never returned. After I formed my core, I went to the Blood Lake once, but I found it impossible to break through the ancient restrictions. I don’t know where she is now…” Fatty Chicken nodded, its eyes filled with deep sorrow and longing, a rare moment of seriousness for it.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. “Your mother was capable of fighting two Nascent Soul cultivators back then, yet she was trapped in the Blood Lake. Even if I entered, I might not be able to accomplish much.”</p><p>Fatty Chicken hurriedly said, “I know the Blood Lake is extremely dangerous, and I wouldn’t dare ask you to risk entering it alone. However, if the Blood Lake is connected to the Abyssal Ruins, wouldn’t the Two Domains Alliance decide to open the Blood Lake and disrupt the Sin Abyss’s schemes? With so many people involved, the danger should be much less. I also know that the chances of my mother being alive are slim, but I only ask that you take me in to search for her, whether she’s alive or dead, so I can have closure. I’m willing to pledge myself to you, Master, and serve you faithfully…”</p><p>Fatty Chicken was desperate to save its mother, even willing to become Qin Sang’s mount. Its mother had been missing for two hundred years, and this might be its only chance.</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought upon hearing this.</p><p>If he reported this information, the Two Domains Alliance would surely send people to investigate the Blood Lake in the Boundless Valley. Whether they would enter the Blood Lake to contend with the Sin Abyss was uncertain, as they would first need to clarify the old demon Ye’s intentions. The demonic factions of the Cold Domain, especially the Green Sun Demon Sect, which was located just outside the Boundless Valley, might know some secrets about the Blood Lake.</p><p>However, the Two Domains Alliance would need to hear the details before making any decisions. How to present the information would require careful consideration. He would first discuss it with Senior Sister Qingjun upon his return.</p><p>If the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon Demon King was still alive, rescuing her would undoubtedly be a good thing. Whether Fatty Chicken pledged itself to him was of little consequence, as Qin Sang wasn’t lacking in Demon Core-level spirit beasts. What Qin Sang valued most was the opportunity to earn the gratitude of a demon king, gaining a powerful ally for the future, especially when dealing with Dongyang Bo. Perhaps he could even persuade the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon Demon King to stay in the Thousand Bamboo Sea, allowing him to travel without worries.</p><p>He needed to travel extensively to search for fragments of the Slaughter Sword, which meant he couldn’t stay in the Cold Domain indefinitely. Establishing a sect and protecting the Thousand Bamboo Sea were mostly to fulfill the wishes of Senior Wandering Cloud, and he didn’t want to trouble Senior Sister Qingjun with such matters.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang waved his hand and said, “We’ll discuss this matter after we return. For now, tell me everything you know in detail…”</p><p>“Yes!” Fatty Chicken was overjoyed to see Qin Sang’s willingness to help.</p><p>…</p><p>The journey back was smooth. Upon reaching the desert and leaving the territory of the Sin Abyss, Qin Sang headed toward the agreed meeting point.</p><p>Far from the Sin Abyss, deep in the desert, stood a ruined city surrounded by towering stone pillars. These stone pillars ranged from a few zhang to several dozen zhang in height. This place had once been a mortal city, but now it was deserted and eerily silent.</p><p>However, Qin Sang suspected it was the work of cultivators, as mortals couldn’t have carved thousands of such massive stone pillars in the desert.</p><p>Standing on a sand dune in the distance, Qin Sang surveyed the ruins to ensure there was no danger. He then crushed a bone talisman in his hand, and the fragments transformed into the phantom of the Snake King.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang was unharmed, the Snake King breathed a sigh of relief. He had personally witnessed the old demon Ye chasing after Qin Sang.</p><p>“I knew you’d make it out alive, Mingyue!”</p>
