<h1>Chapter 609: Forbidden Arts of the Demon Sect</h1><p>Chapter 609: Forbidden Arts of the Demon Sect</p><p>Inside the bronze hall.</p><p>The Vajra pestle restrained Qin Sang, then flew back into the hall, hovering beside the two.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, seemingly still uneasy, produced a strange talisman and implanted it into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was not only completely restrained, but his primordial spirit, meridians, and dantian were also sealed by the talisman, rendering him powerless.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed the confrontation between the two in the hall.</p><p>Making an agreement to seek treasure, only to turn against each other later – this wasn't uncommon in the cultivation world.</p><p>But why was he involved, and why was Dongyang Bo attacking him?</p><p>Qin Sang was both shocked and furious.</p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed, “Miss Chenyan, I've been planning this for many years.  Getting this young man here so smoothly is finally paying off. Do you know how much effort I’ve put into this?”</p><p>A thunderbolt from the blue!</p><p>Upon hearing Dongyang Bo's words, Qin Sang was greatly shaken, staring at Dongyang Bo in disbelief.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, boasting of his masterpiece, elaborated further.</p><p>“This boy's talent is abysmal; it's a miracle he's lived this long!</p><p>“To avoid your suspicion, I couldn't directly contact him, nor could I let Che Yutao and the others break the rules and take him as a disciple.</p><p>“At the time, I didn't expect him to have such a great impact on you. I only made a casual arrangement, leaving it to fate.</p><p>“I arranged for my disciples to befriend him, forming a bond, then providing him with some support, letting him live a little longer, to avoid an untimely death.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, this boy had quite good luck, and he actually made a name for himself.</p><p>“Later, I discovered the secret about you, and this casual arrangement actually became useful, requiring only slight guidance…”</p><p>Who?</p><p>Zhuangyan?  Master Wen?  Mu Yifeng?</p><p>Qi Yuanshou!</p><p>It was Qi Yuanshou!</p><p>A series of familiar names flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave.</p><p>If what Dongyang Bo said were true, the only person it could be was Qi Yuanshou!</p><p>He recalled his first encounter with Qi Yuanshou when he first entered the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>While Qi Yuanshou initially showed no favoritism, after a couple of encounters, their relationship quickly warmed.</p><p>For many years after, Qi Yuanshou remained stationed at Xuanlu Pass, assigning him very simple tasks, never exposing him to great danger.</p><p>Later, Qi Yuanshou was recalled to his sect…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered that the auxiliary spiritual object that helped Qi Yuanshou achieve Golden Core was a gift from Dongyang Bo!</p><p>Was this a reward for Qi Yuanshou's actions?</p><p>After Qi Yuanshou achieved Golden Core, Qin Sang decided to train in the Wuyaya Valley.  Seeing his resolve, Qi Yuanshou even revealed the sect’s hidden forces in the Demon Sect's territory, allowing him to seek help if he encountered danger.</p><p>How many Foundation Establishment cultivators had such an honor?</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that Qi Yuanshou, with his increased power after forming his Golden Core, could achieve this, and he was touched by Qi Yuanshou's care.</p><p>While Qin Sang had wondered about his own value and why Qi Yuanshou would take him under his wing, he had never considered this possibility.</p><p>Who could have imagined there was a Yuan Ying cultivator behind it?</p><p>Throughout his cultivation journey, those Golden Core cultivators ignored him. However, when he achieved the Primordial Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter and obtained the Sword Qi Thunder Sound Divine Ability, no one questioned how he did it.</p><p>Only the Snow Spirit Lotus and the Iris Flower were too precious, causing a stir, but once they learned he had already consumed them, no one bothered him further.</p><p>Thinking back, aside from several of his own adventures where he ventured out and left Qi Yuanshou's control,</p><p>His entire cultivation journey was under Qi Yuanshou's watchful eye, always very safe.</p><p>Except for the time he participated in the battle in the  Turbulent Islands Waters.</p><p>However, Che Yutao was stationed on Guansxing Island then!</p><p>There was a constant danger of death during the war.</p><p>But if Che Yutao was watching, arranging for him to avoid the most dangerous battles, even if he did encounter an accident, he could use his Sword Qi Thunder Sound to escape at any time.</p><p>As the saying goes, great wealth is obtained through great risk, and that period was when he gained the most.  His rapid cultivation to the False Core stage was inseparable from that war.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, finally understanding.</p><p>He hadn't done anything earth-shattering, yet he had achieved such fame.</p><p>It wasn't because "those who do not boast of their achievements are not necessarily without them," but because someone was manipulating events behind the scenes.</p><p>Their goal was to cooperate with Dongyang Bo, allowing him to obtain a Five Elements Beast Seal, and sending him to the Ziwei Palace without alerting Chenyan.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou had given him a Xuanlu Guard token under the pretext of allowing him to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield early, urging him to wait at Xuanlu Pass ahead of time.</p><p>At the time, Qi Yuanshou had advised him not to spend all his time cultivating, but to experience the world more.</p><p>Doesn't it sound like someone saying, "Eat something good?"</p><p>During the final period, he wouldn't even see me.  Was he ashamed?</p><p>At Xuanlu Pass, Lord Dongyang suddenly gathered his men and took control of the Beast Seal.</p><p>Because of my reputation from that great battle,  Che Yutao was able to directly take charge of a Beast Seal without needing to participate in the tests.</p><p>The reason was quite sound; Chen Yan didn't suspect anything.</p><p>Event after event from that time flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Individually, they didn't seem significant, but after reviewing them all, Qin Sang suddenly felt a chill.</p><p>It was like an invisible hand.</p><p>Especially during that final period, guiding me step by step into a trap.</p><p>I didn't even notice, let alone Chen Yan.</p><p>Could it be anyone other than Qi Yuanshou?</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.  Was Yunyouzi also Lord Dongyang's man?</p><p>I could accept anyone else, but not him!</p><p>Our relationship is too deep. Yunyouzi was both mentor and friend to Qin Sang.</p><p>There was a clear distance between Qin Sang and Qi Yuanshou.</p><p>But Yunyouzi was different; he was the person Qin Sang respected and admired the most. If he was also involved, Qin Sang couldn't accept it.</p><p>Moreover, Yunyouzi knew so many of my secrets.</p><p>After reflecting, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Yunyouzi couldn't be Lord Dongyang's man; otherwise, he wouldn't have to struggle so hard, always fighting for a life-or-death chance to break through.</p><p>Yunyouzi brought a sliver of comfort to the disheartened Qin Sang.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was puzzled.  "What secret did Lord Dongyang discover about Chen Yan?  Besides that incident of the "Yin and Yang cultivation," Chen Yan and I have had no further interaction, and she didn't seem to treat me differently. What reason does he have to capture me and threaten Chen Yan?"</p><p>Chen Yan glanced at Qin Sang, remaining unmoved.  She coldly said, "Threatening me with your own disciple?  Is that not laughable?"</p><p>Lord Dongyang looked at Chen Yan with amusement, then at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Miss Chen Yan, you should know that the '玄牝玉鼎真经' (Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing) is considered a forbidden technique even within the Hehuan Sect. Even the crazed members of the Demon Sect dare not easily use this method to seek a breakthrough; those who obtain it invariably keep it under lock and key.</p><p>"Although you are exceptionally gifted, using the secret method just once allowed you to find a breakthrough and achieve Nascent Soul, you’ve already stepped onto a path of no return.</p><p>"Don't you think you can rest easy from now on?"</p>
