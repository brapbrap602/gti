<h1>Chapter 939: Memory</h1><p>“You want the Soul Nourishing Wood?”</p><p>A smile appeared on Bai’s face as he looked Qin Sang up and down. “It seems the Soul Nourishing Wood was your true objective all along. Do you know the value of this treasure? It's the only treasure I retained from my previous life. It's immensely helpful to ghost cultivators like us. Do you think I would trade the Soul Nourishing Wood for my survival?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused for a moment, then said, “It seems, trapped within this demonic restriction, you're unaware of the outside situation. This place has become a secret realm, opening only once every few decades. Due to the extreme dangers within, and the mindless, ferocious beasts within the Seven Killing Hall, none who entered have ever emerged, including renowned cultivators.  There are other strange omens too. Therefore, no one dares remain here after the realm closes. Yet, you’ve managed to stay peacefully within this ghostly land. You're the only exception I've encountered. Could the demonic restriction shield you from the Seven Killing Hall's influence? Perhaps I needn't rush to leave.  I could remain within this restriction for decades until the Seven Killing Hall opens again. He wouldn't dare keep watch outside indefinitely, would he?”</p><p>The smile on Bai’s face froze.</p><p>The threat in Qin Sang’s words was crystal clear. At worst, they could both perish together. He was gambling that the demonic restriction could protect him until the Seven Killing Hall reopened.</p><p>“You're gambling with your future! Your physical body is strong, your body refinement is no less than your cultivation. The cultivation method you practice must be extraordinary, possibly leading to immortality. This place is filled with endless ghostly mist. If you stay here for decades, even if your spirit remains unharmed, your physical body will likely succumb to the mist’s erosion, forcing you to cultivate the Corpse-Ghost Path. Is it worth it for a mere external object?”</p><p>Bai stared intently at Qin Sang, offering his counsel.</p><p>But his intuition told him this man would dare do anything when pushed.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly chuckled, a playful tone in his voice. “Do you know? In order to form my core, I once took a desperate gamble, willingly entering the Corpse Path. But later, by a stroke of luck, I returned to the righteous path and successfully formed my core.”</p><p>Hearing these words, a flicker of surprise flashed in Bai's eyes. His understanding of Qin Sang deepened.</p><p>“Moreover, the Soul Nourishing Wood is not merely an external object to me."</p><p>Qin Sang's brow flickered. The Ebony Wood Sword appeared, hovering between them. "This sword, the Ebony Wood Sword, is my life-bound treasure, inextricably linked to my cultivation. It requires fusion with spirit wood to grow. Now, only spirit wood of the Ten Great Divine Woods caliber can further enhance it. My cultivation has stagnated for years because of this. With the Soul Nourishing Wood before me, if you were in my shoes, would you forgo such an opportunity?”</p><p>Qin Sang also understood the risks of staying in the ghostly land. He didn't want to have a falling out with Bai unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>He cultivated both body and spirit, possessing top-tier cultivation methods from two lineages. If the ghostly mist corrupted him and forced him onto the Corpse-Ghost Path, the loss would be immense. He didn't possess any top-tier cultivation methods of that kind.</p><p>Therefore, he revealed the Ebony Wood Sword, signaling to Bai that the Soul Nourishing Wood was something he would fight for.</p><p>“The Soul Nourishing Wood is a supreme treasure for ghost cultivators. You no longer rely on it, do you? After regaining your freedom, with your abilities, you might find a way to restore your human form…”</p><p>Qin Sang tried to persuade him, but he saw Bai staring fixedly at the Ebony Wood Sword, his expression strange.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He hurriedly asked, “Did you recall something?”</p><p>Bai was a remnant soul of an ancient cultivator. Could he have gleaned some secret from seeing the Ebony Wood Sword?</p><p>Qin Sang actively circulated the "Spirit Nourishing Sword Chapter," activating the Ebony Wood Sword. Circles of light flickered around the sword, displaying it for Bai to see.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Bai suddenly cried out, clutching his head in pain. After a while, he returned to normal, saying to Qin Sang, whose gaze was filled with anticipation, “Infernal Blood Mulberry! I only just realized, your treasure is forged from the Infernal Blood Mulberry?”</p><p>"Indeed, it's the Infernal Blood Mulberry!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought Bai had discerned the origins of his cultivation method and was somewhat disappointed. He tentatively asked, “Have you recovered your memories?”</p><p>Bai shook his head, his tone laced with a hint of excitement. “No. Perhaps because I possess the Soul Nourishing Wood, my subconscious connected it to related matters. Seeing this sword, the words 'Infernal Blood Mulberry' suddenly surfaced in my soul. It seems there's a possibility I can recover my memories! I understand now. No wonder your life-bound treasure can't be enhanced. The Infernal Blood Mulberry is the most defiled wood in existence, on par with the Soul Nourishing Wood. Unless it's a top-tier spiritual object that can withstand the defilement of the Infernal Blood Mulberry's power, it cannot be refined together with it. It would be tainted, losing all spirituality. You are truly blessed to have obtained the Infernal Blood Mulberry.”</p><p>"I wouldn't dare claim such fortune. I only obtained a thin sliver of the wood. I was ecstatic at the time, thinking it was a stroke of luck, but little did I know fortune brings misfortune…"</p><p>Qin Sang explained, unable to resist further questioning Bai, “So, as long as you see familiar objects from your past, you can recall that part of your memory?”</p><p>“Not necessarily!”</p><p>Bai's tone shifted, his expression less optimistic. “I only have a wisp of a remnant soul. Even if I recover, it will be a very small portion of my memory, and most of it will be insignificant. Regaining my sense of self is incredibly difficult!  The Infernal Blood Mulberry is a case in point. I must have known much more about it in my previous life, but now I only recall these superficial details…”</p><p>As he spoke, Bai rubbed his forehead, falling silent for a moment. He then looked up and said, “You're right. When it comes to one's own path, I wouldn't miss this opportunity either.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered slightly. "What do you mean?"</p><p>“It seems I can only offer the Soul Nourishing Wood as payment for my life."</p><p>Bai let out a wry smile.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he agreed to Qin Sang’s terms readily.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. This was undoubtedly a happy ending for both of them.</p><p>Bai reminded Qin Sang not to celebrate too soon. "I can't directly hand over the Soul Nourishing Wood to you. We'll make a three-part agreement, sealed with a heart demon oath. After you help me break the demonic restriction and guide the lost souls, I can give you the treasure.  Afterward, you must assist me with all your might in refining this physical body and refrain from attacking me…”</p><p>He seemed to have planned this in advance, speaking rapidly, outlining a foolproof heart demon oath.</p><p>Qin Sang considered it carefully for a while, then said in a softer tone, “Unless absolutely necessary, I don't wish to be your enemy. I can swear a heart demon oath according to these terms. Furthermore, if you encounter trouble in your search for your past self, I might be able to offer some assistance. However, shouldn't you let me see the Soul Nourishing Wood first, just to confirm?”</p><p>He wasn’t afraid of a heart demon oath, but he wouldn’t go back on his word either.</p><p>“No problem. I’ll remember what you’ve said…”</p><p>Bai nodded readily with a sly smile.</p><p>Opening his mouth wide, he spewed out a stream of deathly energy, seemingly containing something within. As it landed in Bai’s palm, it transformed into a nearly half-foot long, forearm-thick piece of black, decaying wood.</p><p>It was the Soul Nourishing Wood!</p><p>And within Bai's body, another piece of Soul Nourishing Wood of similar size was hidden.</p><p>It seemed he had anticipated this, dividing the Soul Nourishing Wood into two pieces beforehand.</p>
