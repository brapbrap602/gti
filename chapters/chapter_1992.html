<h1>Chapter 1983: Epilogue</h1><p>Qin Sang thought of Qing Yuan.</p><p>The other party's elucidation of the Lesser Vehicle and Greater Vehicle paths had enlightened him, allowing him to finally find the gateway.</p><p>This descent from the mountain for enlightenment had yielded satisfactory results.</p><p>Xiao Wu, having experienced worldly affairs, now had his human nature suppressing his demonic nature.  From now on, he only needed to gradually erode the demonic intent, and his transformation was just around the corner.</p><p>Although it was an unorthodox approach, Qin Sang had finally grasped the Dao of the *Purple Star Sword Canon*.</p><p>He wondered if Qing Yuan had spoken so much to introduce the Dao Court, or if he had discerned his confusion and bottleneck, specifically offering guidance.</p><p>Even though, after a period of contemplation and encounters with other powerful figures in the vast world, he would eventually have understood, he still couldn't help but acknowledge Qing Yuan's kindness.</p><p>The vast world was boundless, the road ahead unpredictable.  He didn't know if they would meet again in the future.</p><p>"Greater Vehicle."</p><p>These two words churned in Qin Sang's mind, lingering persistently.</p><p>Ordinary people could hardly imagine that there could be a Greater Vehicle Path of Slaughter in this world.</p><p>Qin Sang initially found it somewhat absurd, but upon closer reflection, it wasn't entirely without basis.</p><p>Through the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, one could glimpse the changes in the Purple Star Sword Sovereign's state of mind and the trajectory of his cultivation.</p><p>It could be roughly divided into two stages, with the Nascent Soul realm as the boundary.</p><p>Before Nascent Soul, the killing intent condensed into killing talismans, overflowing with a thirst for blood.</p><p>After experiencing the confusion of the Nascent Soul period and breaking through to Deity Transformation, he sheathed his sword, gaining control over his killing heart. He was no longer the killing star who only knew slaughter.</p><p>However, the reason why the Purple Star Sword Sovereign comprehended the Greater Vehicle Path of Slaughter and what he experienced afterward remained intriguing.</p><p>During the Deity Transformation stage, he was still struggling to suppress his killing nature, yet in the Void Refinement stage, he could transcend slaughter, a truly earth-shattering transformation.</p><p>Even more perplexing, if the Purple Star Sword Sovereign was truly concerned with protecting sentient beings, why did he end up with his pavilion shattered, his sword broken, and the whole world as his enemy?</p><p>Now, with the Purple Star Sword Sovereign missing, his forces scattered like the stars, and his enemies still relentless, even he, the 'successor,' had to live in hiding.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom it, but he wasn't anxious.</p><p>From this day forward, he would step onto the stage openly, interacting with the major powers of the vast world, believing that he would eventually uncover some secrets.</p><p>The Dao Court and the Purple Star Sword Pavilion possessed unfathomable strength. They must have been significant forces in the vast world, and even in decline, they would have left traces.</p><p>Unless...</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Formless Immortal Sect of the Central Continent, erased from history by the combined forces of Daoism and Buddhism, and he wasn't so certain anymore.</p><p>A flurry of thoughts surfaced, quickly suppressed by Qin Sang.  Excessive contemplation was futile; the most crucial thing was his own cultivation.</p><p>The return of the Dao Court and the Purple Star Sword Pavilion was a game between mighty figures.</p><p>Without sufficient strength, he would be nothing more than a pawn, just like those swept along by the currents of this upheaval.</p><p>When that day came, even the Purple Star Child would likely abandon him.</p><p>Sighing inwardly, Qin Sang saw Yu Lang standing outside the plaza, hesitating to approach, and beckoned him over.</p><p>Yu Lang's mind echoed with those words, understanding yet not fully comprehending.  He composed himself and stepped forward, bowing, "Greetings, Master."</p><p>He understood that Daoist Qing Feng was likely an avatar or something similar, but he felt that his Master's words held a deeper meaning that he couldn't grasp.</p><p>Looking at the unfamiliar figure before him, Yu Lang's thoughts were in turmoil, still deeply shaken.</p><p>Judging by his senior sister's reaction, he knew his master was powerful, but he hadn't expected such overwhelming might.</p><p>A single decree, and the mortal world was overturned!</p><p>Immortal Master Yun, from Cloud Metropolis Heaven, had left a sound transmission talisman for Tao Teng and fled back to Cloud Metropolis Mountain, not daring to show his face since.</p><p>The various sects of the Yan Kingdom's cultivation world had all retreated to their mountains, sealing their gates and isolating themselves from the mortal realm.</p><p>Brother Sha and Tao Teng didn't dare enter the city, waiting anxiously outside.</p><p>His Master's words were like heavenly decrees.</p><p>The game board had been overturned, and the Void Refinement Patriarchs of the Soulfall Abyss and Cloud Metropolis Heaven hadn't appeared, seemingly acquiescing.</p><p>He still didn't know that Patriarch Ming Hu had fallen, and that the Soulfall Abyss was in turmoil, or he would have been even more shocked.</p><p>"You should return to the mountain," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yu Lang was momentarily stunned, then replied, "This disciple obeys."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Yu Lang sensed something and looked north, seeing a procession escorting an imperial palanquin from the royal palace.</p><p>Soldiers cleared the way, separating the commoners, with civil and military officials following closely behind.  Only he, the prime minister, was absent.</p><p>The procession arrived before the statue, seemingly oblivious to them standing there.</p><p>Master must have used some sort of illusion, Yu Lang thought, then his expression turned to astonishment.</p><p>He watched as they set up an altar before the statue, with offerings of three animals and other tributes.  The monarch personally led the civil and military officials in a sacrificial ceremony, reciting eulogies, a grander spectacle than even the Heaven Worshiping Ceremony.</p><p>The greatest affairs of state were sacrifices and military campaigns.</p><p>Sacrificial rites had always been of utmost importance, and Yu Lang was no stranger to them.</p><p>Now, the Yan Kingdom was using the rites of Heaven Worship to venerate his Master's statue!</p><p>The eulogy contained phrases like "acting on behalf of heaven," "purging demonic influences," "guarding the mortal realm," and "sage of the world."</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't help but glance at his Master.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone with divine light, gazing beyond the city, his gaze seeming to sweep across the entire mortal realm.</p><p>At the same moment, identical ceremonies were taking place in the mortal kingdoms, and would replace the Heaven Worshiping Ceremony, becoming a regular practice, an annual event, with the eulogy circulated throughout the world!</p><p>Daoist Qing Feng's deeds were known to everyone in the mortal realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit wandered beyond the physical world.</p><p>As the sacrificial ceremony progressed, Qin Sang vaguely sensed a subtle, indefinable connection forming between himself and those statues.</p><p>There was no significant improvement in his cultivation, but using this to verify his cultivation method, his understanding became slightly clearer.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained impassive, and he felt no particular joy.</p><p>In this battle, only Patriarch Ming Hu had fallen.  Qin Sang had merely issued a verbal warning to Gu Yun Sou, assuming that Cloud Metropolis Heaven wouldn't dare interfere in the mortal realm again.</p><p>The mortal realm would be his mortal realm.</p><p>When he descended the mountain, Qin Sang hadn't anticipated that he would step forward so quickly, seizing a territory from the clutches of two major forces.</p><p>Moreover, this territory was the least valuable in the vicinity.</p><p>He had even less anticipated that this would be his place of enlightenment.</p><p>If this was his Dao, and it stemmed from his true heart, continuing on this path would surely lead to some accomplishment, and his future cultivation of the *Purple Star Sword Canon* would become much smoother.</p><p>But was he willing?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his cultivation journey.</p><p>When he first cultivated the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, back then called the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, he and this cultivation method were far from compatible.</p><p>Relying on the Jade Buddha, he had reached this point step by step, but the rift had grown wider and wider.</p><p>Before today, Qin Sang believed he would follow the Purple Star Sword Sovereign's path, continuing to treat the *Purple Star Sword Canon* as his fundamental cultivation method, eager to obtain the latter half of the sword canon.</p><p>Suddenly, he wasn't so eager anymore.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean that Qin Sang would give up searching for the latter half of the sword canon. Even if he changed his cultivation method, the *Purple Star Sword Canon*, as a top-tier cultivation method in this world, would still be the best reference.</p><p>"I intend to establish sixty-four branch temples in the mortal realm, along with the main temple, and entrust their management to you.</p><p>"Each branch temple will have a guardian spirit beast for the time being.  There's no need to rush to recruit disciples. I'll have Tai Yi and the others disperse into the mortal realm to search for children with exceptional talent and virtuous character to bring into the sect.</p><p>"My words were not empty.</p><p>"The Green Ram Temple will be responsible for overseeing the world.  From now on, all sects and factions in the mortal realm will be under our control, to prevent anyone from defying us in secret and disrupting the mortal realm."</p><p>Qin Sang declared.</p><p>The mortal realm was settled.</p><p>The Green Ram Temple overseeing the world couldn't be accomplished with just an empty shell. Human hearts were fickle, and intimidation could only last for a while.</p><p>From this point on, the Green Ram Temple would truly take root in the vast world.</p><p>Yu Lang listened respectfully to Qin Sang's instructions, his expression gradually becoming serious.</p><p>His master had driven away Cloud Metropolis Heaven and the Soulfall Abyss, awing the cultivation world, and from now on, cultivators were forbidden from interfering in the mortal realm. This was precisely what he had aspired to; how could he refuse?</p><p>But this responsibility was heavy.</p><p>Overseeing the world was not comparable to a small Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang added, "With Tai Yi and the others assisting you, and the divine dao overseeing matters, there's no need to handle everything personally.  Prioritize your cultivation."</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had used his disciple's heart to comprehend the Dao, allowing Yu Lang to descend the mountain and experience the world before his cultivation was complete, without urging him to cultivate.</p><p>Yu Lang had talent, and his unwavering Dao heart was rare.  Qin Sang didn't want to see this disciple live a mediocre life.</p><p>"Master's painstaking efforts, this disciple will keep in mind."</p><p>Yu Lang took a deep breath and nodded firmly.</p><p>His Master had taught him a valuable lesson through words and actions.  Without his Master, he would be nothing more than a pawn, struggling in the murky currents, any aspiration a mere fantasy, all his passion ultimately in vain.</p><p>Only someone like his Master could deter the wicked and restore order to the mortal realm!</p><p>His heart filled with gratitude for his Master, believing that his Master had taken such drastic action to enlighten him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't elaborate. After watching the entire sacrificial ceremony with Yu Lang, he left alone, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Yu Lang remained in the Yan Kingdom, appearing at the imperial court to resign from his official position, calling Sha Jiayu into the city to bring his family back to the mountain together.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled among the clouds, heading west. He moved unhurriedly, as if inspecting the mortal realm.</p><p>As he was traveling, a purple streak shot towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it in his hand, seeing that it was a purple bamboo slip.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>The purple bamboo slip spontaneously combusted without fire, transmitting Gu Yun Sou's voice.</p><p>…</p><p>West of Twilightfall Mountain.</p><p>On the plains, long ravines stretched, their depths unseen.</p><p>This was originally the Soulfall Abyss's mountain gate, Patriarch Ming Hu's domain.</p><p>Now, white clouds hovered above the ravines, densely packed with figures.</p><p>These people had sharp brows and starry eyes, dressed in snow-white robes, exuding a pure aura, devoid of any demonic qi.</p><p>At the center of the cloud formation, nine figures sat or stood upon a single cloud. They were the Nine Immortals of Cloud Metropolis.</p><p>The Nine Immortals' expressions were filled with excitement and bewilderment, occasionally glancing upwards.</p><p>In a place unseen by the other disciples, Gu Yun Sou, the Supreme Patriarch of Cloud Metropolis Heaven, sat in meditation on a cloud, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>"Why is Master entering meditation at this time?"</p><p>A female cultivator among the Nine Immortals asked in a low voice.</p><p>Everyone looked towards Yun Xi, who shook his head slightly, indicating that he didn't know either.</p><p>The Nine Immortals exchanged glances.</p><p>When Patriarch Ming Hu had left the mountain to seize the treasure, they had fled in panic, followed by a series of unforeseen events, including the heavenly changes.</p><p>Just as the Nine Immortals were at a loss, their Master had arrived late, finally calming their nerves.</p><p>Unexpectedly, their Master had ordered them to mobilize the entire sect's strength to eradicate the corpse demons of the Soulfall Abyss.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were utterly shocked, yet they didn't dare disobey. To their surprise, the subsequent eradication went remarkably smoothly.</p><p>Their Master personally took action, capturing the several top experts of the Soulfall Abyss with ease.</p><p>The remaining members were scattered and posed little threat, and most of their efforts were spent pursuing deserters.</p><p>Until they reached the mountain gate, Patriarch Ming Hu hadn't appeared to intervene, which spoke volumes.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were both surprised and delighted.</p><p>They were delighted that Cloud Metropolis Heaven had finally eliminated this formidable foe, and surprised at Patriarch Ming Hu's demise.</p><p>Their Master's cultivation level was no secret. It was said that Patriarch Ming Hu was cultivating a powerful divine ability. Even if their Master had broken through to the mid-Void Refinement stage and could defeat Patriarch Ming Hu, killing him would likely be difficult.</p><p>If the roots weren't eradicated, Cloud Metropolis Heaven couldn't withstand Patriarch Ming Hu's furious retaliation.</p><p>Therefore, although the two sides were irreconcilable, neither wanted a fight to the death.</p><p>Their Master's decision to exterminate the Soulfall Abyss meant that Patriarch Ming Hu must have fallen. Could the mysterious figure who issued the decree be a helper invited by their Master?</p><p>Over these past few days, everyone in Cloud Metropolis Heaven had been incredibly excited. Just as they were about to completely wipe out the Soulfall Abyss, their Master had ordered them to stop, without explanation.</p><p>Morale was beginning to wane.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou wasn't in meditation at this moment.  He was still thinking about that day's events.</p><p>When the Daoist had declared his intention to protect the mortal realm, Gu Yun Sou's heart had skipped a beat, fearing that he would be targeted next.</p><p>After all, the chaos in the mortal realm stemmed from the two sects using it as a chessboard, and Cloud Metropolis Heaven couldn't escape responsibility.</p><p>He, Gu Yun Sou, was also one of the masterminds behind it.</p><p>Fortunately, the Daoist had spared him in the end, only demanding that Cloud Metropolis Heaven eradicate the demons, leaving no survivors.</p><p>The Daoist hadn't sent anyone to monitor them, so Gu Yun Sou, being sensible, had ordered his disciples to hand over any belongings of corpse demons above the Deity Transformation stage after killing them.</p><p>As for the treasures within the Soulfall Abyss's mountain gate, Gu Yun Sou didn't dare keep them for himself, inviting the Daoist to collect them personally.</p><p>Otherwise, a bolt of lightning would likely strike Cloud Metropolis Heaven on the spot.</p><p>From that brief glimpse, Gu Yun Sou couldn't discern the details of the altar formation, unsure of its range or how many thunderbolts it could unleash. How could he dare offend Qin Sang?</p><p>During this period, Gu Yun Sou had considered every sect, including the Clear Sky Sect, but couldn't figure out the Daoist's background.</p><p>He seemed to have appeared out of nowhere, yet he acted with such confidence.</p><p>He certainly had the capital to be confident.</p><p>Dual cultivation of body and dharma, a Postnatal spiritual treasure, a sword domain, and a dharma altar - all these signs indicated that the Daoist's sect must be extremely powerful, or at the very least, he had a highly skilled master.</p><p>Perhaps even a Body Integration stage grandmaster!</p><p>Without the guidance of a Body Integration grandmaster, how could he have comprehended the sword domain at the early Void Refinement stage? How could he have a spirit servant brewing tea for him?</p><p>Every time he thought of this, Gu Yun Sou felt uneasy.</p><p>If he were alone, he could flee to distant lands, but relocating a sect wasn't so simple, and he couldn't abandon the sect's foundation.</p><p>With the mortal realm occupied by the Daoist and so many dharma altars established, expecting him to leave on his own was impossible.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou's headache was how to manage the relationship between them. He now only hoped that the Daoist's sect wouldn't clash with the Clear Sky Sect.</p><p>If the two powers were to fight, the tiny Cloud Metropolis Heaven caught in the middle would be crushed.</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou sighed inwardly, sensing the Daoist approaching, and rose to greet him.</p><p>"The remnants of the Soulfall Abyss are hiding below. The Soulfall Abyss's sect-protecting formation is an ancient formation obtained by the old ghoul many years ago. It's somewhat intricate.  I'll need your assistance, Daoist, to break through it together!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded noncommittally.</p><p>The darkness of the Soulfall Abyss couldn't obstruct his vision.</p><p>Through the formation, he saw panicked faces.</p><p>Strictly speaking, he had no grudge against Patriarch Ming Hu. Patriarch Ming Hu was merely a tool for him to prove his Dao.</p>
