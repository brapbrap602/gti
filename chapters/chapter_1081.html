<h1>Chapter 1773: Return of the Soul</h1><p>Chapter 1773: Return of the Soul</p><p>“Yin Laomo was betrayed by you!”</p><p>At this moment, the Demon Lord finally understood.</p><p>Yin Laomo had mentioned this person many times, recommending him to the Demon Lord.  However, the Demon Lord, preoccupied with preparations for the Demon-slaying and Stele-seizing operation, hadn't paid much attention.</p><p>This person was actually an ancient demon spy!</p><p>The Demon Lord glanced at Lingzhuzi.</p><p>Lingzhuzi's brow furrowed.</p><p>“You want me to help you break the ancient seal and release him?  You’re dreaming!”</p><p>The ancient demons, repeatedly provoked, were enraged beyond measure, eager to devour Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu remained unfazed, his expression calm.  “The Demon Lord wants me to tell you, it's not a return to your original form, but soul scattering, or even imprisonment and soul searching. You know what to do! I…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Mo Qingzhu’s body suddenly trembled, his breath fluctuating violently.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu's face contorted, quickly suppressing his true soul, angrily shouting.</p><p>“What are you trying to do!”</p><p>The sudden change surprised everyone, unsure what had happened to Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>While Mo Qingzhu and the ancient demon were conversing, they had been secretly communicating, deciding to strike together, using swift force to eliminate the weaker Mo Qingzhu first.</p><p>Though the ancient seal showed no abnormalities, and they didn't know what he had done, eliminating him first couldn't hurt. They could deal with the ancient demon later.</p><p>Seeing Mo Qingzhu's strange aura, everyone was about to attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a faint shout echoed from within Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>“Sword Soul, return!”</p><p>With these words, a piercing sound came from above, and a figure flashed into view.</p><p>Everyone looked up in surprise.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Lingzhuzi’s face was full of astonishment.</p><p>He actually recognized this person.</p><p>This person's name was Ning Wuhu, a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect, who willingly accepted the menial task of guarding the gate. However, he possessed considerable talent, earning him a place in the trial realm.</p><p>This time, Lingzhuzi led his disciples into the Seven Killing Hall, and Ning Wuhu was one of them. However, because Ning Wuhu was very low-key in the sect, Lingzhuzi knew little about him.</p><p>But how did he, with only late-stage Golden Core cultivation, enter the Spirit Suppressing Domain?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Lingzhuzi was about to question him.</p><p>But then, a flash of light emanated from Ning Wuhu’s head, revealing a Nascent Soul, leaping out, clutching an unidentified fragment, and instantly darting towards Mo Qingzhu, merging into his body.</p><p>“Heretical Nascent Soul!”</p><p>The Demon Lord identified the Nascent Soul's nature.</p><p>With the Nascent Soul entering his body, Mo Qingzhu’s expression froze, then erupted in fury.</p><p>His breath was chaotic, his facial expression horribly contorted, like a madman, his eyes bloodshot, then one side of his face gradually returned to normal.</p><p>The same face, yet giving completely different impressions.</p><p>One side was demon, the other human!</p><p>Seeing this, everyone vaguely guessed what was happening, pausing their actions.</p><p>The two sides were locked in a stalemate, but clearly, the normal side was gaining the upper hand, the demon soul gradually suppressed.</p><p>“Who are you? I am not the Sword Soul!”</p><p>A furious roar echoed from within Qingzhu, the voice of the demon soul, filled with resentment.</p><p>“That's right.”</p><p>Qingzhu's true soul took the initiative, his eyes regaining clarity, letting out a barely audible sigh, “You were a fragment of my killing intent, created to cultivate my techniques. I could usually suppress you, but I was seriously injured upon arrival here, nearly overwhelmed by you.  I had no choice but to seal you on Yitian Peak.  Unexpectedly, an ancient demon lurked in the mountain, and when I returned for you, you were gone, seduced by the ancient demon, becoming its pawn, committing countless atrocities! Thankfully, you haven't discovered the memory-sealing restriction within you, unaware of your true origin.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The demon soul was shocked, instantly realizing something.  “The jade slip in the sword…”</p><p>Qingzhu hummed, “The jade slip was left for you! Your cultivation progressed far beyond my expectations, the seal within you loosened, your memories about to return.  I had no choice but to use this tactic, leaving the jade slip to lure you to me.  You and I were originally one, a split soul, indistinguishable. When I found you, your cultivation surpassed mine. If your memories were restored, and you came for me, insisting on merging, I would have no power to resist. If we merged, we would become a killing maniac.  The Sword Soul is different, forged by cultivation techniques, its soul essence merging with sword light, forging a demonic seed. To devour its master, it must first suppress my soul, consuming my soul when I’m unable to fight back. Only by misleading you, making you believe you are the Sword Soul, could I buy time, strengthen the seal within you, and wait for the right moment…”</p><p>While Qingzhu and the demon soul clashed.</p><p>Within.</p><p>The Sword Soul Nascent Soul released the fragment in its arms, using it to suppress the demon soul.</p><p>A fragment of the demon soul core, imbued with a strange prohibition, was being manipulated by Qingzhu’s true soul.  It was clearly a piece of the same artifact, differing only in shape.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The two fragments collided and merged, revealing sword edges – part of a spiritual sword!  An ancient character, "Kill," was now complete on the blade.</p><p>The merged fragment shone faintly, emitting a strange, blade-like energy. The demon soul screamed, resisting fiercely, unwilling to submit.  But with the power of the sword fragment, Qingzhu’s true soul gained the upper hand.  The frantic look in Qingzhu's eyes gradually faded.</p><p>For decades, Qingzhu had endured humiliation, willingly drawing the demon soul into their body.  They had sent a clone into the trial realm to obtain a Blood Ginseng, cultivate an unorthodox Nascent Soul, and retrieve the other sword fragment from the Nether Valley.  Finally, the moment of victory had arrived!  Resealing the demon soul was imminent.</p><p>The Demon Lord and others, all seasoned experts, though only witnessing the interaction between Qingzhu’s two souls within their Purple Mansion, could guess what was happening.</p><p>“You’re just a fragment of a soul! Hahaha!”</p><p>The Ancient Demon laughed cruelly.  His laughter ceased abruptly as he lunged towards a fissure in the ground.  His main body had cornered him; escape was impossible. He had only one option.</p><p>“Stop him!”</p><p>A chorus of shouts erupted.  As Qingzhu sealed the demon soul, they revealed a shocking truth: “Kill this demon! The Witch Clan has also been drawn here…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Nan Gui Xianzi gasped.  “The Demon Sealing Prohibition… it's an ancient restriction of the Human, Witch, and Yao clans!”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the ancient temple, Qin Sang stood hidden on a cliff, observing from afar. His earlier conjectures were confirmed; the grey energy protected him as he left the temple unharmed.</p><p>The air throbbed with demonic energy.  Top-tier experts were everywhere.  He dared not approach, only observing from a distance, gathering fragmented information, unable to fully grasp the intricacies.</p><p>Renowned human experts appeared and disappeared like fleeting shadows, the situation shifting rapidly.  Then Qingzhu appeared.  Upon hearing their shout, Qin Sang was struck by a sudden revelation.  Unlike others, he knew Qingzhu had once self-immolated their soul to cultivate the *Spirit Soul Sword Chapter*.</p><p>The battle raged anew.</p><p>Qin Sang’s thoughts raced.  Suddenly Bai spoke: “The Fire Curse Seed is reacting.  Old Demon Mu is faking his death!”</p>
