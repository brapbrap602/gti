<h1>Chapter 1029: Stone Spirit Apes</h1><p>The leaders of the Xi You and Bei Chen alliances departed with their teams.</p><p>Soon, others were dispatched by them.</p><p>These individuals acted separately, stealthily disappearing in different directions.</p><p>Only the two alliance leaders remained.</p><p>The Bei Chen leader turned to look at the mountain where the Dong Ji alliance leader was, and said calmly, “Years of planning, and finally it’s time to close the net! I didn't expect that the last altar was hidden so deeply, actually sealed by the Four Saints within a Foundation Establishment trial realm. We only pinpointed this altar's location after figuring out the entire formation's structure. Thankfully, the trial realm is a patchwork of restrictions by the Four Saints and the original secret realm's inner hall, not a completely unified formation, so it inevitably has flaws.  Leave this place to Daoist Bai Li; the other two altars are equally dangerous, and we should act."</p><p>The Xi You leader nodded, their figure vanishing into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>The Bei Chen leader watched the Xi You leader go, pondered for a moment, and flew off in another direction.</p><p>…</p><p>Trial Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the final trial.</p><p>The instant he was transported, Qin Sang felt a sudden drop, finding himself in mid-air as if falling from the sky. He quickly activated his movement technique to stabilize himself.</p><p>‘Hiss!’</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly gasped.</p><p>Just over a hundred meters in front of him, a long silver streak appeared in the void – a spatial fissure!</p><p>"A spatial fissure, such a dangerous thing, in a Foundation Establishment cultivator's trial realm!  It's unimaginable how this secret realm was arranged."</p><p>Qin Sang stayed put, not daring to move rashly.</p><p>He looked far into the distance and found more than one spatial fissure floating in the void, though not many.  They looked dangerous, but as long as one was cautious, they weren't that easy to run into.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang awakened his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to confirm there were no more dangerous invisible or moving spatial fissures nearby.</p><p>Compared to the depths of the storm belt, this place was relatively safe.</p><p>However, that didn't mean other places were safe. Qin Sang kept the Sky-Eyed Butterfly on guard, looked around, and used his movement technique to fly to a nearby mountaintop.</p><p>He didn't see Ming Wei, nor any other cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that everyone's landing points were different. He and Ming Wei were likely among the first cultivators to enter, so it was normal not to encounter others.</p><p>They still had plenty of time, as long as they could meet before the Cleansing Soul Liquid appeared.</p><p>"First, I need to determine my location…"</p><p>Qin Sang learned that the entire trial realm was divided into four regions, each with different terrain, and the Hundred Treasures Pavilion was located in the center of the four regions.</p><p>The treasures in the Hundred Treasures Pavilion were fixed in number; only those who arrived fastest could get them.</p><p>"Is that a lake?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked far into the distance, his gaze passing over several mountain ranges, vaguely seeing shimmering waves, seemingly quite extensive.</p><p>He had an idea and was about to use his movement technique to go and check it out.</p><p>At that moment, the mountain peak beneath his feet suddenly shook violently.  The ground undulated like a swamp, rolling wildly.</p><p>After a few ‘bangs’, clumps of yellowish ‘stone balls’ jumped out from the ground, each with a diameter of several meters.</p><p>It was as if several mountains appeared out of nowhere around Qin Sang, and he fell into shadow.</p><p>‘Crack crack crack…’</p><p>These stone balls began to crack in mid-air.</p><p>Dust and smoke rose.</p><p>Amidst the billowing smoke and dust, the stone balls drastically changed, transforming into giant ape-like creatures. Their bodies were pitted and composed entirely of sharply angled stones.</p><p>But they all possessed four limbs, their posture and appearance resembling apes, and they moved freely.</p><p>On each stone ape's head, two hole-like eyes flashed with ferocious light, staring fixedly at Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Squeak squeak…’</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The stone apes beat their chests, emitting sharp, unfriendly cries, filled with clear hostility.</p><p>"Stone Apes!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, realizing his location.</p><p>These stone apes were rock-born earth spirits, unique to the Wu Tu region of the trial realm, known as the guardians of the trial realm.  The other three regions also had similar creatures.</p><p>These stone apes possessed immense strength and extremely sharp senses.</p><p>They dwelled underground, blending seamlessly with the rocks and were difficult to detect.  Cultivators participating in the trial could easily stumble into the stone apes’ territory and be attacked.</p><p>Clearly, Qin Sang had just entered the stone apes' territory, provoking their anger.</p><p>Before encountering these stone apes, Qin Sang had used his spiritual sense to scan the surroundings, yet found nothing unusual.  Their ability to conceal themselves was truly remarkable.</p><p>The stone apes, enraged by the intrusion, shrieked loudly.</p><p>Simultaneously, in the dense forest below, the trees swayed like waves, accompanied by rustling sounds, followed by a series of beast roars.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang muttered to himself, "Trouble."</p><p>These stone apes could actually command the surrounding beasts to hunt him down. The beasts wouldn't recognize the demonic aura on him; once a beast tide formed, escaping would require considerable effort.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A sword glow flashed, striking a stone ape in front.</p><p>Thunder rumbled, the sword light like lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang attacked with all his might. The stone ape couldn't react in time; just as it was about to raise its fists, the Ebony Sword had already cleaved its chest.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The Ebony Sword left a deep gash on the stone ape.</p><p>Failing to cleave it in two surprised Qin Sang, revealing the incredible defensive power of these stone spirits.</p><p>He then changed his hand seal, and the Ebony Sword flickered, splitting into a dozen sword beams that simultaneously struck various parts of the stone ape, targeting its joints.</p><p>The stone ape froze, then shattered into numerous pieces of stone, falling to the ground.</p><p>Surprisingly, the dismembered stone ape didn't die. After falling, its body dissolved into the ground. Quickly, a new stone ape's outline swelled from the earth, forming before Qin Sang's eyes, slowly rising to its feet.</p><p>These stone apes were effectively immortal.</p><p>"Indeed, they're tough.  And this one wasn't even the strongest. However, although they can regenerate, it takes time. That gap will be my chance to escape."</p><p>Qin Sang reflected, having grasped their characteristic.</p><p>At this point, the other stone apes, enraged by their companion's destruction, launched a furious counterattack with heavy blows.  The forest below erupted in chaos, the roars of beasts blending with the stone apes' cries, their numbers unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated no longer, and lightly pointed his Ebony Sword.</p><p>A spinning sword-wheel erupted among the stone apes.</p><p>They staggered wildly.  Qin Sang summoned his phoenix wings and dragon shadow, seizing an opening to burst out of the encirclement. He easily left the stone apes behind.</p><p>Qin Sang's escape technique far surpassed these beasts'. He sped away like the wind.</p><p>The stone apes, unable to keep up, beat their chests, roaring toward the sky. Some beasts from the surrounding forest charged to intercept him, only to be either slain or outrun by Qin Sang.</p>
