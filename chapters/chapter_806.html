<h1>Chapter 798: The Jiao Clan</h1><p>A crystal exploded.</p><p>Feathers scattered, trembling in mid-air before dissolving rapidly from the tips, as if weathered away, eventually vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>A whooshing sound pierced the air.</p><p>A streak of blue light darted into the cave.</p><p>It was a demonic bird.</p><p>Any cultivator witnessing this would recognize it as a Biqiu, a venomous beast requiring extreme caution.</p><p>This Biqiu was far smaller than its kind, yet displayed exceptional intelligence.  Its cultivation was far from the Transformation Stage, clearly imbued with power from the Emperor's Flowing Liquid.</p><p>Seeing the dissolving feathers, fear flashed in the Biqiu's eyes.  It shrieked, flapping its wings frantically as it flew out, nearly colliding with the rock wall, incessantly crying, "Disaster… disaster…"</p><p>The cave within the mountain was vast, extending deep underground.</p><p>The Biqiu flew straight down, relentlessly, finally reaching a stone gate encircled by blue light, breathing heavily.</p><p>Before it could speak, a deep voice boomed from within the gate.</p><p>"What happened outside?  Why the alarm?"</p><p>The Biqiu spread its wings, prostrate on the ground, trembling, "Your Majesty, the soul feather left by the Young Saint… is shattered. He may have perished…"</p><p>The voice from behind the stone gate remained unperturbed, "Which Young Saint?"</p><p>The Biqiu, supporting itself with its wings, pointed towards the cave above, "The one Your Majesty personally selected, the one sent to the Seven Killing Hall, the human sacred site, after aiding his transformation. Before his departure, the Young Saint left behind a soul feather…"</p><p>A sound like 'Oh' came from behind the gate, followed by, "Him! I understand."</p><p>The tone remained calm, devoid of anger, then fell silent.</p><p>The Biqiu was secretly surprised, somewhat unexpected.</p><p>After a while, the King behind the stone gate asked again, "Anything else?"</p><p>The Biqiu quickly replied, "Your Majesty, I was wondering if we should send a new Young Saint.  I await your command."</p><p>"No need."</p><p>The King decisively stated, "Sending a Young Saint fulfilled our agreement with the Jiao dragon clan.  An accident occurring after infiltrating a human sacred site is normal."</p><p>"Then…"</p><p>The Biqiu hesitated, "Should we inform the Jiao clan of the Saint's death?"</p><p>The King fell silent for a moment before saying,</p><p>"No! The Jiao King is arrogant and domineering.  Learning of this, he will surely pressure our clan to send another Young Saint.</p><p>To successfully infiltrate the human Canglang Sea, only a Young Saint below the Transformation Stage can go undetected.  We use the ancient secret technique, 'Burning Blood True Art,' to prematurely transform the Saint. Although some demonic aura will remain after transformation, humans using demonic creatures for alchemy often have this aura in their pills.  Only we can distinguish between these two types of demonic auras, thus allowing us to deceive everyone and infiltrate the Great Waste Island.</p><p>This technique is incredibly costly.  It not only demands high talent from the Young Saint, but after transforming into human form, their cultivation cannot progress further, forever losing the chance to break through the Transformation Stage, and their lifespan is greatly reduced.</p><p>Furthermore, this technique requires me to perform it personally, each time leaving me gravely injured, requiring years of seclusion to recover.</p><p>This useless technique… I wonder where the Jiao clan obtained it.</p><p>The Jiao clan claims that a treasure exists in the human Seven Killing Hall, even a chance for Divine Transformation, yet they refuse to reveal the source of this information, only wanting to use the various clans to work for them!  Regardless of the truth of this matter, even if it were true, the Seven Killing Hall has opened before; many human experts exist, how could they have missed it?</p><p>I only agreed to their request out of necessity. We need not go through with this. Do not reveal this matter. Take another Sea Soul Crystal and a blue feather and return them to their original place.”</p><p>The Biqiu bowed its head submissively. When hearing the secrets of the technique, it was incredibly shocked, and after receiving the King's command, it said, "Yes," and flew back along the same path.</p><p>Silence returned to the cave.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang remained oblivious to everything happening in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>He was desperately fleeing, occasionally glancing back, his heart pounding in fear.</p><p>When the Cold Flame erupted, he was at the heart of the storm. The surrounding hurricane was affected by the power of the Dongming Cold Flame, causing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to become chaotic, forming a small whirlwind.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang reacted quickly enough to escape.</p><p>"If it weren't for the Fire Pearl, this time I would've been in serious trouble…"</p><p>A wry smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Although he eagerly wanted to know the function of the bone flute, this was no place to linger. He took out a jade talisman, identified the direction, and flew towards the edge of the storm.</p><p>After the chase, he had strayed far from his route. After difficult travel, he finally reached the edge of the storm.</p><p>He remained cautious and vigilant, seeing that it was calm beyond the storm, before venturing out.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang arrived near Dongmen Island and was surprised to find it in ruins, completely deserted.  The island's city was severely damaged; parts of the island had even collapsed and sunk into the sea, clearly affected by a terrible force.  This gateway of the Qisha Hall was now a wasteland. He saw no corpses, indicating the islanders had fled beforehand.</p><p>"A Yuan Ying battle extended even here!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, growing wary. Seeing no unusual activity, he didn't linger, and after a moment's thought, flew northwest.</p><p>The closest large island was Leichen Island, home to a cultivator city and the heart of the nearby sea region. He went to Leichen Island hoping to learn more about the aftermath of the Yuan Ying battle.</p><p>His journey was uneventful.</p><p>Leichen Island came into view.  Seeing nothing amiss, Qin Sang landed and entered the city to seek information.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist inquiring about the Yuan Ying Masters?"</p><p>The shopkeeper sized Qin Sang up. "Fellow Daoist, you're too late. The Yuan Ying battle is over. They say it raged from Qisha Hall all the way to the outer storm, incredibly fierce and shocking, nearly destroying Dongmen Island. We on Leichen Island were terrified, even considering evacuating the entire island. Then, for some reason, the two factions' Yuan Ying suddenly stopped fighting and left."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised, suspecting the Demon Lord and the Great Witch Doctor had reached some agreement.</p><p>"Did those Yuan Ying Masters leave any messages before departing? Anything about Qisha Hall…"</p><p>The shopkeeper pondered. "There were rumors that the Witch Clan will be responsible for opening Qisha Hall again; it’s said it won't be long, but no specific time was mentioned. However, I've been on the island the whole time, and I'm not sure if that rumor is true…"</p><p>Qin Sang left some spirit stones, and the shopkeeper, pleased, personally escorted him out.</p><p>Qin Sang was now using his true appearance.</p><p>The Qiongyu Trading Company had a branch on Leichen Island, doing quite well – one of the company's most valued locations. But before dealing with Xiang Yi, Qin Sang would avoid contact with the Qiongyu Trading Company to prevent exposing his identity.</p><p>"So, the Witch Clan hasn't achieved their goal.  The next attempt might lead to even fiercer conflict, but that doesn't concern me. The more frequently Qisha Hall opens, the better my chances of finding the teleportation array.  I should focus on my own matters first.  I'll go straight to Tianxing Island…"</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision.</p>
