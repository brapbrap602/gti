<h1>Chapter 551: Old Friends Meet as Strangers</h1><p>Che Yutao's residence wasn't extravagant. The courtyard held a simple arrangement of flowers and plants.  Most of Mount Shaohua's disciples at or above Foundation Establishment late-stage who were stationed at Suspension Pass were present, save for a select few.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed some unfamiliar faces, likely disciples who had recently arrived from the sect.</p><p>These individuals stood silently in the courtyard, maintaining a respectful quiet.</p><p>Beside Che Yutao stood a powerfully built man with a ruddy complexion and a composed demeanor.  Unusually, he carried an extremely heavy black iron sword strapped to his back with cloth, resembling a mortal world swordsman.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't met this person before, but upon seeing the black iron sword, he immediately guessed his identity.</p><p>Ji Qing!</p><p>Che Yutao's eldest disciple.</p><p>While Zhan Yi was indeed favored by Che Yutao, Ji Qing, this imposing figure, held the reputation of being Che Yutao's most renowned disciple and the former number one expert of Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Unlike Qin Sang, this title of "number one expert" was earned through battles fought in the Eight Righteous Sects Grand Tournament.</p><p>Qin Sang was still cultivating in seclusion at Sunny Market during the tournament, having just recently broken through to Foundation Establishment late-stage. Even if he had participated, he would have struggled to achieve a good ranking without resorting to his corpse refinement or magical treasures.</p><p>However, Qiu Mubai hadn't participated in that tournament. Ji Qing hadn't fought against Qiu Mubai, so it was unknown which of them was stronger.</p><p>After the tournament, Ji Qing received his reward and disappeared.  He hadn't appeared even during the turmoil in the Small Cold Region, suggesting that he was either on an extended training journey or in secluded cultivation, preparing for Core Formation.</p><p>It seemed he had failed to form his core and was still at the pseudo-Core Formation stage.</p><p>A woman in a hooded cloak occupied the main seat, her face concealed.</p><p>For Che Yutao to personally accompany her, this woman's status must be extraordinary. Could she be a reclusive Golden Core cultivator from the sect?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't recall any of his elders who favored wearing cloaks.</p><p>This thought flashed through his mind, and he couldn't help but steal another glance.  Suddenly, he froze. For some inexplicable reason, the woman, completely shrouded by the cloak, gave him a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>Uncertainty stirred within Qin Sang.</p><p>“Mubai, come here!”</p><p>Seeing them enter, Che Yutao greeted them warmly and beckoned Qiu Mubai forward. Then, he noticed Qin Sang.</p><p>“Eh? Qin Sang is at Suspension Pass too? You, come forward as well.”</p><p>Qin Sang and Qiu Mubai exchanged glances.</p><p>Seeing the same puzzled expression on Qiu Mubai's face, Qin Sang felt slightly reassured. Although he didn't know why Che Yutao had summoned them, it seemed that with Qiu Mubai and Ji Qing also involved, it couldn't be anything bad.</p><p>“Greetings, Elder Che.”</p><p>The two stepped forward and bowed in unison.</p><p>Che Yutao gestured for them to dispense with the formalities and asked Qin Sang, “I recall you primarily cultivate water-attribute spiritual energy?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately replied, “Yes.”</p><p>Che Yutao nodded and turned to the cloaked woman.</p><p>“Lady Chenyan, Mubai's strength is undeniable. He will surely handle the White Tiger Seal flawlessly. This is also Master's intention, to allow Mubai to gain experience.</p><p>“This is Disciple Qin Sang. Lady Chenyan has been in secluded cultivation and likely hasn't met him.</p><p>“He is known as the Shadowless Sword, having shone brightly during the conflicts with the Heavenly Travel Alliance. His strength is among the top of the younger generation.  Aside from Mubai and Ji Qing, likely no one here is his match. He can wield the Black Tortoise Seal.</p><p>“Along with Ji Qing wielding the Hook Chen Seal, we only need to select two more individuals.”</p><p>The moment Che Yutao uttered the name "Lady Chenyan," Qin Sang froze in place.</p><p>It was her!</p><p>The only woman he had ever been intimate with, their encounter stemming from a reason he found difficult to speak of. How could Qin Sang forget her?</p><p>She was also the reason for the damage to his foundation, making him hesitant to attempt Core Formation.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang harbored no resentment.</p><p>Damaging his foundation to achieve Foundation Establishment was his own choice, and he had no right to blame others.</p><p>Such was the way of the world. When one took shortcuts to overcome difficulties, they might have to pay a thousandfold price later to compensate.</p><p>If not for that encounter, he might never have had the chance to reach Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Foundation Establishment and Core Formation were different.</p><p>Pseudo-Core Formation cultivators were considered experts in the cultivation world.  They could venture out to seek opportunities, capable of self-preservation, and possess the capital to take risks. Qi Refinement cultivators, on the other hand, could easily lose their lives during training journeys.</p><p>Back then, it was a fair exchange. After that night, they were no longer connected.</p><p>Since then, both had strictly adhered to their agreement, tacitly choosing to forget the matter.</p><p>No matter how great the difficulties Qin Sang faced, he never considered seeking her help.  In fact, since that incident, he had never mentioned the name "Chenyan" to anyone.</p><p>Chenyan was the same. She hadn't offered him any assistance nor caused him any trouble, treating him as if he didn't exist.</p><p>Nearly a century had passed since that incident, and Qin Sang finally saw Chenyan again.</p><p>For a hundred years, Chenyan had remained hidden, so disciples who joined later were unaware of her existence within the sect.</p><p>A while ago, Qin Sang had a sudden thought about Chenyan, wondering if she had succeeded in Nascent Soul formation.  He hadn't expected to see her in person under these circumstances.</p><p>Judging by Che Yutao's tone, even he had been kept in the dark about their past.  No wonder such great lengths were taken back then, using Elder Mawu's name as a cover.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was in turmoil, but his expression remained unchanged, calmly glancing at Chenyan.</p><p>He noticed Chenyan sitting quietly, listening to Che Yutao, seemingly indifferent to him and Qiu Mubai.</p><p>It was best to follow the old agreement.</p><p>They would treat each other as strangers, forgetting their past encounter.</p><p>Qin Sang thought silently.</p><p>Yet, he couldn't help but wonder why Chenyan had quietly left seclusion and come to Suspension Pass. Had she formed her Nascent Soul?  What was the purpose of summoning them here?</p><p>Hearing Che Yutao mention the White Tiger Seal, the Black Tortoise Seal, and the Hook Chen Seal, Qin Sang was still completely clueless.</p><p>He had never heard of these seals before. What were they, and why were they being asked to control them?</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways at Qiu Mubai, seeking answers with his gaze.</p><p>Qiu Mubai subtly shook his head.</p><p>Qin Sang could only patiently wait for Che Yutao's explanation, refraining from looking at Chenyan again.</p><p>Che Yutao finished speaking.</p><p>A calm voice emerged from beneath the cloak: “Alright.”</p><p>Just like in the past.</p><p>The familiar voice evoked Qin Sang's past memories, which he instantly suppressed.</p><p>Old friends met, yet they acted as strangers.</p><p>…</p><p>Che Yutao, obedient to Chenyan's every word, turned to face the courtyard.</p><p>At this point, apart from Qin Sang, Qiu Mubai, and Ji Qing, the other disciples stood in neat rows, including pseudo-Core Formation experts like Zhan Yi and Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Che Yutao addressed those in the courtyard, “Spread out and demonstrate your best skills. Lady Chenyan will assess you. Don't hold back. Maintain your stance with all your might until you can no longer endure.”</p><p>Hearing this, those in the courtyard exchanged glances.</p><p>Although they didn't know the reason for this assessment, seeing Qiu Mubai and the other two, all prominent figures in the sect, they understood that being ranked alongside them would be advantageous.</p><p>Immediately, everyone followed Che Yutao's instructions, spreading out and occupying their own small spaces.</p>
