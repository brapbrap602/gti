Chapter 367: Entering the Valley


After introducing both parties, the shop owner excused himself.  “Kong Dao-you is very familiar with the Wuyaya Valley. If you have any requests, feel free to ask Kong Dao-you. I won't disturb the three of you.”
The three of them entered the wooden house.
There was no one else inside.
Kong Xin, without any pleasantries, went straight to the point. “Please have a seat, Dao-you. A senior just contacted me, asking if I knew where Huanglong Grass grows.  So, you two are entering the valley to collect Huanglong Grass?  Are there any other purposes?”
Yun Youzi hummed, and asked back, “Does Kong Dao-you really know where Huanglong Grass grows?”
Kong Xin replied calmly, “Yes, I do know a place where Huanglong Grass grows.
“However, I must warn you both in advance that it’s not a safe place. There are already considerable dangers. After the recent beast tide, a group of Tiger-winged Eagles suddenly appeared, making a nearby stone mountain their nest.
“Among this group of Tiger-winged Eagles are over a dozen妖灵期 (Yaolingqi)  great demons. They are very restless, have a strong territorial sense, and, even worse, their demonic eyes can see through invisibility.  It’s very difficult for ordinary cultivators to hide from them.
“Collecting Huanglong Grass means risking being discovered by the Tiger-winged Eagles.
“I earn my living honestly and don’t want to risk my life. I can only take you both to a safe place deep within Wuyaya Valley; after that, you'll have to proceed on your own. If you’re unwilling, I won’t force you.
“You might as well ask around; other guides are all the same.”
Yun Youzi frowned, “It’s fine if Dao-you doesn't want to lead the way, but you should tell us about the terrain and how to get there, right?”
Sun Xin nodded, “That's only right.”
Qin Sang and the other only used the Huanglong Grass as an excuse; they didn't care whether they could collect it or not.  Knowing the location was not far from their second destination, they agreed to join Sun Xin's group.
Sun Xin got two more clients, and couldn't help but smile.
Unfortunately, his face was unnaturally pale, and the smile made him look even more eerie.
“Three more Dao-you will arrive tomorrow morning.  You two might as well rest and recuperate at my humble abode. We'll set off tomorrow. Also, you'll need some supplies to enter Wuyaya Valley. I'll give you a list; make sure you have everything ready to avoid any setbacks.”
Qin Sang and the other had no objections.
Sun Xin had been hanging around Wuyaya Valley for years, and knew the valley better than Yun Youzi. The items on the list were exceptionally detailed, each with its purpose clearly stated.
The total cost was not much in spirit stones, and they purchased everything needed.
As they were about to return to the wooden house, Yun Youzi suddenly sent a voice transmission, “Qin Lao-di, what’s your impression of that Sun Xin?”
Qin Sang paused, looking at Yun Youzi, “What do you mean, senior?”
“His skin is unnaturally pale, likely due to his cultivation method.”
Yun Youzi mused, “I can't sense any demonic energy or blood energy from him. I can't tell what cultivation method he practices.  Such a significant effect on his body suggests some kind of demonic cult's evil technique.”
“This is Wuyaya Valley; it's normal for Sun Xin to be a demonic cultivator.  He seems sane and doesn't have any blood煞气(shasa qi). Since you mentioned that Tianfeng Tower has a good reputation, and the owner of Tianfeng Tower dared to use his reputation as a guarantee, it means that this person is at least not an unrestrained demon on the surface…”
Qin Sang recalled his *Dunling Jue*, and thought for a moment, “He could also be extremely good at disguising himself. As long as we keep an eye on his every move, if anything goes wrong, we can strike first and don't need to be afraid of him.”
Yun Youzi hummed, “Qin Lao-di is right. If he leads the way honestly, it's best if we peacefully coexist. If he dares to have ulterior motives, give him a lesson he'll never forget!”
They waited another night in the market town.
The next morning, everyone arrived.
Besides Qin Sang, Yun Youzi, and Sun Xin, there were four other people: three men and one woman.
The woman arrived first. She wore a red dress and a veil, hiding her face. But her figure was excellent, and her expression was cold.
The second to arrive was a refined middle-aged man. After meeting everyone, he took the initiative to talk and introduced himself as Bao.
Both of them were Foundation Establishment cultivators.
The last two were an old and a young master-apprentice pair. The old man was a Foundation Establishment early stage cultivator, but his apprentice was only at the Qi Condensation stage.
Except for the man surnamed Bao, no one else showed any interest in getting to know each other. They were just fellow travelers brought together by Sun Xin, and they would part ways once they reached their destination.
Sun Xin stood up and said, “Everyone is here. Let's set off.”
The woman in red had been waiting impatiently and looked at the master-apprentice pair with displeasure. Her voice was rather sharp as she questioned, “Why is there a Qi Condensation cultivator among us? If his low cultivation level causes trouble, are we going to clean up after him?”
The apprentice's face flushed.


The old man restrained his disciple, chuckling, "Friends, rest assured. My disciple and I only seek a medicinal herb to cure an illness. We have no intention of venturing deep into the Wuyagu Valley and will not burden you."

The woman in red harrumphed and said nothing.

Sun Xin breathed a sigh of relief and urged them to hurry.

The market town was not far from the valley entrance.  Using their flying artifacts, they reached the edge of Wuyagu Valley within an hour.

A blood-red wall loomed before them. The blood miasma was incredibly viscous, rippling like water.

Stopping before the miasma, Qin Sang immediately smelled a pungent stench of blood, causing a slight dizziness.  The miasma's toxicity was evident.  He quickly channeled his spiritual energy to create a barrier against it.

Equally formidable was the biting chill emanating from the blood miasma.

The disciple's face was turning as pale as Sun Xin's; his arms wrapped around himself, he trembled violently next to his master.

Sun Xin glanced at his disciple, "Fellow cultivators, you may now activate your protective artifacts. Once inside the miasma, do not cease activating them."

Qin Sang and Yunyouzi produced jade pendants, holding them in their palms.

Once spiritual energy was channeled, the Qingyang demonic fire surged from the pendants, quickly forming a layer of green demonic fire around them.

A hissing sound followed as the blood miasma was burned away by the demonic fire, instantly dispelling the chill.

Despite being demonic fire, it contained an intensely pure and yang energy, causing wonder and amazement.  This energy likely originated from the Qingyang Divine Might.

Others employed their own methods.

The woman in red summoned a red cloth; red light pulsed, enveloping her entire body.

The Bao cultivator and the master-disciple pair also used artifacts sealed with Qingyang demonic fire, though of lesser quality than Qin Sang's jade pendant.

Sun Xin, however, was the most unique.

In his palm rested a pill the size of a longan, crimson red with a perpetually burning flame flickering upon its surface.

A thick,妖气 (ya qi - demonic aura) radiated from the pill.
