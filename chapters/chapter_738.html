<h1>Chapter 730:  The Challenge</h1><p>Cui Ji had lorded over Wu Yuan Island for many years, his background well-known unless he had deliberately concealed his true abilities.  </p><p>Having learned that Cui Ji had also broken through by consuming the Sha Yao Pill, and that the demonic煞 energy within him hadn’t been completely purged, Qin Sang had a pretty good idea of what he was dealing with.</p><p>After fifteen years of hunting demons…</p><p>Before subduing the two-headed… beast, Qin Sang had already been completely unafraid of mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators, let alone one whose strength was impaired by demonic煞 energy.</p><p>Now, with the two-headed… beast, defeating this person would be effortless.</p><p>However, he had sent the black-armored man with the two-headed… beast to steal the Winter Nether Cold Flame not long ago. If word reached Hun Tian Island, it might attract the attention of those with ulterior motives, so he needed to be cautious in its use.</p><p>“Let’s go. Take me to meet Cui Ji.”</p><p>Qin Sang stood up.</p><p>As a manager, his income was directly tied to the trading company’s business. Even a small amount is something. In order to gain entry into the Seven Killing Hall, he was now penniless and in debt.</p><p>If the other party was willing to cooperate peacefully, that would be fine. But Cui Ji’s actions clearly indicated he wasn’t someone who could be reasoned with.</p><p>Humiliating the Wang sisters and suppressing the Qiong Yu Trading Company—was this meant to be a warning to others?</p><p>Unfortunately for Cui Ji, he wasn’t the chicken he could easily slaughter. Since Cui Ji had handed him this opportunity, not taking advantage of it would be a disservice to himself.</p><p>Four people left the shop. The elder looked worried, but dared not stop Qin Sang, only praying silently that Qin Sang’s abilities would be sufficient.</p><p>Qin Sang sent a voice transmission to the Wang sisters, asking for their opinions.</p><p>Wang Shi’s cheeks flushed, while Wang Xiang was clearly excited, seemingly eager for a fight, and both finally agreed.</p><p>…</p><p>“The newly appointed manager of the Qiong Yu Trading Company is strikingly beautiful.  The two sisters are almost identical, yet their temperaments are completely different, each with their own strengths – a rare find.”</p><p>In the hall, a group of people sat together, apparently discussing something, when one person suddenly let out a sigh.</p><p>“She’s incredibly presumptuous!”</p><p>On the main seat, a young man with a somewhat gloomy and pale complexion coldly snorted, “I heard these two were originally loose cultivators with no foundation in the Qiong Yu Trading Company. They offended someone, and Elder Zou sent them here. Cui *I* offered them kind words, but they not only refused to appreciate it, they even dared to glare at me.”</p><p>This person was Cui Ji.</p><p>“Such a beautiful pair of sisters, both with exceptional talent. The elder sister is already a Foundation Establishment cultivator; the younger sister shouldn’t be far behind. This is a rare find, an absolute treasure. As the saying goes, beautiful women love heroes, and those close at hand have the advantage. Manager Cui, with a little effort, what chance do they have of escaping your grasp? Liu here congratulates you in advance…”</p><p>A man with a goatee made a lewd remark, winking and bowing to the young man.</p><p>A wave of lecherous laughter immediately filled the hall.</p><p>A few individuals looked uneasy, unwilling to participate, but they dared not openly defy the young man, so they could only laugh along awkwardly.</p><p>Just then, a muffled thud suddenly came from outside the hall.</p><p>The laughter stopped abruptly, and everyone looked at each other, just about to get up to see what happened, when a scream followed.</p><p>Then, a series of screams and muffled thuds rang out from outside the hall, clearly indicating that the Nine Star Society’s guards had been easily dealt with by the intruders.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Cui Ji slammed his fist on the table, furious, “Who dares to cause trouble in my Nine Star Society!”</p><p>Before his words had finished, everyone felt two auras heading straight for the hall.  The others’ faces changed slightly, and they exchanged glances, secretly preparing themselves, but none dared to act rashly.</p><p>Cui Ji and the other Nine Star Society cultivators darted out of the hall.  What they saw was the Nine Star Society guards lying scattered on the ground, and the Foundation Establishment-level guard captain was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>At this sight, Cui Ji’s pupils constricted slightly.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Two streaks of light landed before them, revealing the Wang sisters.</p><p>Cui Ji laughed angrily, “The two of you have returned. Have you changed your minds and decided to accept Cui’s terms and become Cui’s women?”</p><p>His words were vulgar, and Cui Ji looked around, not only failing to see his capable subordinates, but also the lack of any sign of a fight, which filled him with a sense of unease.</p><p>“You scoundrel…”</p><p>Wang Xiang glared, finally able to unleash a torrent of abuse. To be able to curse a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator to their face made Wang Xiang feel both slightly guilty and secretly exhilarated.</p><p>Cui Ji seemed not to hear Wang Xiang's curses, his eyes fixed on a shadowy corner.</p><p>At this moment, the others in the hall also poured out. Seeing the scene outside, they were all shocked.</p><p>If Cui Ji's enemies came looking for trouble, they naturally wouldn't get involved.  The real worry was someone targeting the entire East Pole Alliance. Even if they disliked Cui Ji, they would still need him.</p><p>Then, a figure emerged from the shadows – Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was holding someone: the Nine Stars Society's head guard.</p><p>They entered under the guise of the Qiong Yu Trading Company, taking the Nine Stars Society by surprise and quickly dispatching the outer guards. Although this head guard was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he was no match for Qin Sang and was easily captured and his cultivation suppressed.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Qin Sang threw the unconscious guard to the ground, sending up a cloud of dust.</p><p>Cui Ji's eyes twitched, and he angrily demanded, "Who are you?  To injure someone on Nine Stars Society grounds, are you trying to make an enemy of the East Pole Alliance?"</p><p>"I am Qingfeng, a Daoist priest.  Sent by Elder Zou, I am the newly appointed manager of the Qiong Yu Trading Company, and I am a member of the East Pole Alliance myself. How could I possibly be at odds with the Alliance?"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, turning to the Wang sisters.  "This man publicly insulted you, intending to take you as concubines, is that right?"</p><p>"Yes, him!" Wang Xiang said crisply.</p><p>Wang Shi nodded slightly.</p><p>"To covet my women, you have quite the nerve!"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned outrage.</p><p>Wang Shi blushed slightly, while Wang Xiang looked more excited.</p><p>"Considering you are accomplices, and fellow members of the trading alliance, I'll let it slide.  But this man's actions are unacceptable, both publicly and privately. I cannot let this go!  This isn't the end of it; I will write to the trading alliance and demand justice! Are you planning to collude with him?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was icy, sweeping across the group.</p><p>Even through the cloak, they felt her gaze like sharp knives cutting their skin. They dared not meet her eyes, instinctively backing away.</p><p>The way Qin Sang silently subdued the Nine Stars Society's head guard was simply shocking. So many people present, and no one noticed how she did it.</p><p>Besides, they were all members of the East Pole Alliance. Why would they get involved and help Cui Ji settle a personal grudge?</p><p>They were all fence-sitters, clearly. Given any excuse, they would run away faster than anyone else.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered inwardly, turning her attention to Cui Ji.</p><p>Cui Ji's expression was grim, trying to see through the cloak to Qin Sang's face. "A cloaked, nameless Daoist priest dares to speak so boldly before me, Cui? Beware you don't bite off more than you can chew!"</p>
