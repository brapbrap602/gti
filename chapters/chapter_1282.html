<h1>Chapter 1274:  The Roaring Thunder</h1><p>If there were spirit shadows of mid- or even late-Nascent Soul stage cultivators, wouldn't I be able to sense them and comprehend a higher realm of cultivation? Sensing the spirit shadows left behind by cultivators of the same realm would certainly greatly benefit me!  At Blood Lake, I didn't have time to carefully investigate. Qin Sang only noticed countless chaotic and frenzied spirit shadows within the talisman puppet, like a night of a hundred ghosts.  Unexpectedly, there's a bonus!</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, holding the talisman puppet. A green glow clung to the puppet's surface; Qing Jun had placed several layers of restrictions on it to prevent it from losing control. Qin Sang doesn't know how the Upper Clarity Quiet Palace did it. However, he has the Jade Buddha protecting him, so he's not afraid of the talisman puppet absorbing his primordial spirit at all.  He fearlessly delved into the talisman puppet, searching extensively within.</p><p>Actually, Qin Sang wasn't the first to have this idea.  Successive ancestors of the Upper Clarity Quiet Palace had all tried. There were indeed mid-Nascent Soul stage spirit shadows within the Nascent Soul talisman puppet, but none of higher realms.  It’s unknown whether it's because no Grand Cultivator has ever used the puppet, or for other reasons. However, the strongest spirit shadows were deeply hidden within the puppet's core.  Upper Clarity Quiet Palace cultivators dared only sense the two or three outermost shadows. Now, the inside of the puppet is increasingly chaotic, even the outer spirit shadows are extremely dangerous.</p><p>To find a mid-Nascent Soul stage spirit shadow requires searching deep within the talisman puppet.  Doing so without any protection, exposing one's primordial spirit to the spirit shadows, experiencing them while suffering from the soul-devouring agony – even Grand Cultivators can't handle it.  Unless there's a way to fully protect one's primordial spirit, it's not worth the risk.</p><p>Qin Sang had no such worries.  His golden primordial spirit shone brightly, causing the spirit shadows to retreat, unable to harm him in the slightest.  The deeper he went, the stronger the spirit shadows became.  Finally, he found three mid-Nascent Soul stage spirit shadows!</p><p>"I wonder which generation of ancestors from the Upper Clarity Quiet Palace refined this talisman puppet," Qin Sang mused, overjoyed.  "It looks like it's been around for quite some time, and three more mid-Nascent Soul stage ancestors have appeared since then."</p><p>The spirit shadows, faces contorted with ferocity, lunged at him, but were helpless against him.  Qin Sang paused, deciding not to sense the spirit shadows immediately, but to retreat instead.  He only recently formed his Nascent Soul; the mid-Nascent Soul stage is still far off. He can start with the outer spirit shadows, gradually comprehending them as his cultivation improves.</p><p>"What kind of spiritual materials was this talisman puppet refined from, to have such a heaven-defying effect?  It's a pity there aren't any late-Nascent Soul or Divine Transformation stage spirit shadows; otherwise, breakthroughs later would be much easier..."</p><p>Qin Sang played with the Nascent Soul talisman puppet, reluctant to let it go. Its touch was smooth as jade, its material indistinguishable.</p><p>"Thankfully, I didn't let Lord Dongyang obtain it; otherwise, Mount Shao Hua might have seen a new Nascent Soul cultivator emerge.  I should let Mu Yifeng and Li Yu Fu try it sometime. The prosperity of Qingyang Temple is just around the corner! But they don't have the Jade Buddha; how will they sense the spirit shadows?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this problem, then suddenly remembered something. "The Inner Scene Yuan Talisman!  So that's it!  The Inner Scene Yuan Talisman must be a treasure that helps Upper Clarity Quiet Palace disciples sense spirit shadows. It could also divert attention, preventing people from associating it with the talisman puppet. But none of the Upper Clarity Quiet Palace disciples for generations have formed Nascent Souls. Was it simply because their aptitude was insufficient?"</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Inner Scene Yuan Talisman is a Golden Core level secret talisman; it might be insufficient to protect them. The inside of the talisman puppet is extremely chaotic; without the Jade Buddha, he wouldn't dare to try it easily.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang couldn't think of a good solution.  Then, he sensed the cave's restrictions being triggered.  Qin Sang looked up, swept his spiritual sense, and saw Jing Yu and the fat chicken. He got up and went out.</p><p>"Your cultivation has recovered?" Qin Sang examined Jing Yu. Her cultivation was higher than his, likely at the peak of early Transformation stage. If Jing Yu could break through to the mid-stage and agree to protect Qingyang Temple, he could travel with peace of mind in the future.</p><p>Jing Yu nodded.  "Thank you for the pills you gave me.  With a little more rest, I can attempt a breakthrough. But before I go into seclusion, I'll help you place the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper into the spirit vein. Have you gathered all the spiritual materials needed for the formation in the secret technique?"</p><p>"I've already sent people to search.  Although those materials are rare, they shouldn't be too difficult to find.  I wonder how many years of cultivation these three Corpse Flower Blood Jaspers will save me!" Qin Sang showed a look of anticipation.</p><p>After purifying the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, he sensed the spirit shadow while refining the elixir, his cultivation was bound to improve by leaps and bounds!</p><p>Jing Yu hesitated, "I'm not sure. My ancestors who obtained Corpse Flower Blood Amber treated it as a treasure, using it for breakthroughs. No one has ever directly refined and absorbed it!  Wouldn't you consider exchanging the Corpse Flower Blood Amber for other treasures with other Demon Kings?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then resolutely shook his head.</p><p>At this stage, even saving ten years of arduous cultivation is incredibly precious, signifying more possibilities. Since he could use it, there was no need to exchange it, as it might not fetch something better, unless it was an item that aided breakthroughs.</p><p>Now, with the spirit puppet, if he could break through to the mid-Yuan Ying stage soon, he could travel and seek opportunities for ascension and the remaining fragments of the Killing Sword.</p><p>Even if he exchanged it for other items, how could it compare to his own advancement?</p><p>He didn't lack magic treasures.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's determination, Jing Yu stopped persuading her. She hesitated for a moment, her face showing difficulty.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious and watched quietly.</p><p>Jing Yu called the fat chicken over, and said, "When I left, he was still young, only having a nickname, and still doesn't have a formal name.  It's quite embarrassing.  Qin Daoist, you're his benefactor, could you bestow a name upon him?"</p><p>"How could I do that?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, waving his hands in refusal, feeling it was a bit strange.</p><p>But Jing Yu insisted, and the fat chicken bowed to Qin Sang.</p><p>Unable to refuse, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, "The Thunder Swallowing Falcon has an innate ability to control thunder. From now on, his Dharma name will be Chi Lei (Thunderclap)."</p><p>The fat chicken joyfully thanked him, "Chi Lei thanks the senior for the name!"</p><p>Jing Yu looked relieved, and said, "Qin Daoist, I just heard Chi Lei mention that he vowed, if he could be rescued, he would pledge allegiance to you..."</p><p>Before Jing Yu could finish, Qin Sang interrupted her, smiling, "It was just a playful remark. I didn't agree to Chi Lei's request, you don't need to worry about it."</p><p>"Qin Daoist, don't misunderstand!"</p><p>Jing Yu hurriedly said, "Daoist, you gave Chi Lei the power of the Green Luan Divine Beast, greatly increasing his potential, and rescued me from the dungeon. We, mother and son, are not ungrateful. I heard you have intentions of establishing a sect, leading the myriad demons of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea. If I fail to break through, naturally everything is off the table, and Chi Lei will serve you.  If I succeed, could I replace Chi Lei and remain as your mountain guardian spirit beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly stunned. He had originally targeted Jing Yu, but unexpectedly, Jing Yu had brought it up herself, and volunteered to be the mountain guardian spirit beast.</p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p>Jing Yu said solemnly, "I can swear on my blood."</p><p>The fat chicken panicked, wanting to argue, but Jing Yu pointed a jade finger at him, silencing him.</p><p>Qin Sang contemplated. This outcome was even better than he expected.</p><p>However, a dignified transformed demon certainly wouldn't be treated as a mere spirit beast, and it would be impossible to keep her confined to the sect forever.</p>
