<h1></h1><p>Venerable Hunmo, with the Hunmo Token hovering above his head, stepped out of the ghostly mist.</p><p>Lightning struck the Hunmo Token, and electrical light flowed across its surface, as if plating it with a layer of silvery-white armor, blocked from entering.</p><p>Because Qin Sang had not used his full power, coupled with the extraordinary power of the Hunmo Token itself, he was unable to harm Venerable Hunmo in the slightest.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Where Venerable Hunmo had been standing, a wisp of ghostly mist quietly flickered, appearing much more dissipated than before. After a moment of writhing, it reverted to the shape of a ghost spirit, its body even more transparent.</p><p>Venerable Hunmo had actually switched places with the ghost spirit!</p><p>The method for refining this ghost spirit was something he had gleaned from deciphering ancient Demonic Arts. He had used countless rare treasures, along with his own lifeblood essence and the souls of cultivators as nourishment. The effort he had poured into the ghost spirit was no less than that of any magical artifact.</p><p>The ghost spirit was connected to Venerable Hunmo's mind, akin to an incarnation. It was not only filled with monstrous Demonic Might, but also possessed incredible Divine Abilities such as Shadow Shift .</p><p>Space Manipulation  was nothing more than this!</p><p>This scene caused everyone, including Qin Sang, to feel a chill run down their spines.</p><p>Possessing such Divine Abilities, anyone who fell into the clutches of Venerable Hunmo would find it impossible to escape.</p><p>Just now, Qin Sang had noticed that Venerable Hunmo's speed was indeed slower than his own. Furthermore, he had decisively disengaged from the battle and had already created some distance.</p><p>His Divine Sense had greatly improved, and Venerable Hunmo's Divine Sense could no longer lock onto him from a distance. He would be safe as soon as he left Venerable Hunmo's sight.</p><p>However, before he could even rejoice, Venerable Hunmo had traversed the void and instantly closed in.</p><p>Such Divine Abilities greatly astonished Qin Sang.</p><p>The question from before flashed through his mind again. When they were vying for treasures in the Golden Summit Buddha Hall, why hadn't Venerable Hunmo released the ghost spirit? Otherwise, he would have been facing Venerable Hunmo's true body and would have been forced to act, exposing himself at that time.</p><p>As his thoughts turned, Qin Sang noticed that the ghost spirit had become much weaker than before. It was lingering behind, hesitant to approach, and dared not join the battle.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flickered. He guessed that the Shadow Shift Divine Ability had significant limitations and consumed a great deal of energy, similar to Chen Yan's strange Divine Ability. It could not be used continuously.</p><p>This slightly eased his tense mind. Otherwise, he would have begun to doubt whether his two backup plans could stop Venerable Hunmo.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The sound of thunder shook the heavens.</p><p>Venerable Hunmo walked out of the lightning, his turbid eyes looking at Qin Sang with an indifferent gaze devoid of emotion. Reflected in his pupils was the dazzling sword light.</p><p>Seeing his great enemy, Qin Sang knew that there was no way to resolve this peacefully today. Venerable Hunmo had sought him out instead of the Xuantian Palace, with whom he had a feud, definitely because he had seen through or guessed something.</p><p>Once he attacked, it would surely be with thunderous force, not stopping until his goal was achieved.</p><p>Without saying a word, Qin Sang didn't ask any questions and immediately launched a sword attack.</p><p>Venerable Hunmo was expressionless. Without any visible movement, the Hunmo Token above his head flashed in front of him, emitting a strange 'whooshing' sound.</p><p>The Hunmo Token paused in the void, transforming into a hundred-foot-tall phantom image, like a giant wall of light blocking the way.</p><p>‘Pff!’</p><p>The Jinchen Sword arrived in an instant. The sharp sword light deeply pierced into the illusory wall of light. The resistance grew greater and greater, forcing the sword light to contract inward.</p><p>Just then, Venerable Hunmo let out a cold snort.</p><p>The Hunmo Token leaped above the Jinchen Sword, and the illusory wall of light rapidly condensed towards the center, as if carrying the weight of ten thousand jun, pressing down fiercely to suppress the Jinchen Sword.</p><p>‘Buzz buzz buzz…’</p><p>The Jinchen Sword was of too low a grade and was unable to bear the heavy burden. The sword body trembled.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying pressure transmitted from the spirit sword, Qin Sang's expression turned grim. While constantly retreating, he continuously cast sword incantations, repeating his old trick, manipulating the Jinchen Sword to set up a sword formation.</p><p>In the next moment, the Jinchen Sword turned defense into offense. The sword formation reversed and enveloped the Hunmo Token, attempting to pull Venerable Hunmo into the sword formation.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's plan failed.</p><p>Venerable Hunmo already had some understanding of Qin Sang's swordsmanship. He seized upon the flaw that the Jinchen Sword was of low grade, using the advantage of his own cultivation level and the Hunmo Token's high grade, forcing Qin Sang to use the sword formation to counterattack prematurely.</p><p>In this way, Venerable Hunmo could calmly dodge, avoiding being trapped by the sword formation.</p><p>He tapped the black bamboo staff forcefully in the void.</p><p>Venerable Hunmo's figure flashed repeatedly, appearing dozens of zhang away, successfully moving away from this range before the sword formation was fully formed.</p><p>Only the Hunmo Token was trapped in the Seven Soul Slaughter Formation.</p><p>Venerable Hunmo turned his head to look at the sword formation and made a strange sound in his throat.</p><p>Immediately, the Hunmo Token shook violently, emitting the sound of bells and chimes. In an instant, ten thousand rays of light burst forth. Had it been any other sword formation or restriction, it would probably have been completely disrupted by this power, full of flaws.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not be negligent in the slightest. The sword formation evolved into endless variations. Countless sword threads gathered and dispersed continuously, seemingly chaotic but actually extremely organized, obliterating those rays of light.</p><p>On the surface, it seemed that neither side could do anything to the other.</p><p>Only Qin Sang knew how much pressure he was under. He only felt more exhausted than when he had dealt with the Xuantian Palace before, and this was just the beginning.</p><p>Facing an opponent like Venerable Hunmo, an upper-grade spirit sword was still too weak. He must reforge the Jinchen Sword as soon as he returned!</p><p>Seeing this scene, a hint of solemnity also appeared in Venerable Hunmo's eyes.</p><p>In terms of this sword formation alone, the other party was enough to become famous throughout the Endless Sea.</p><p>Venerable Hunmo secretly wondered, with the other party's strength, obtaining an extreme-grade spirit sword should not be too difficult. Otherwise, when facing a fully-formed sword formation, he would have to treat it cautiously.</p><p>After testing the power of the sword formation, Venerable Hunmo no longer paid attention to it. His gaze shifted to Qin Sang, and he lightly raised the black bamboo staff, shooting out a stream of light.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled a breath. The Demonic Fire that formed the fire armor flowed back into his sleeves. His arm lightly shook, and a row of small Demonic Banners flew out.</p><p>Now that things had come to this, there was no need to hide anything anymore.</p><p>It was a good opportunity to measure the true strength of a Great Cultivator!</p><p>"It really is you!"</p><p>Without seeing the Demonic Fire, just seeing the Demonic Banners, Venerable Hunmo recalled the unique aura that was still fresh in his memory. A furious roar escaped his lips, his killing intent soaring to the heavens!</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled strangely, sarcastically saying, "Why is Fellow Daoist so furious? Could it be that only Fellow Daoist is allowed to launch sneak attacks, and I am not allowed to return the favor?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking.</p><p>Streams of Demonic Fire flew out from the Demonic Banners, transforming into a fiery dragon, devouring the stream of light without causing much of a ripple.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The members of the Xuantian Palace, who were far behind, widened their eyes in disbelief, unable to believe what they were seeing.</p><p>The mysterious man who had toyed with them so miserably had not even used his full strength. Even from this distance, they felt a sense of palpitations.</p><p>The two elders exchanged glances, their faces turning green and white. They were still worried that the Sacred Artifact would fall into someone else's hands when Venerable Hunmo attacked, but now they knew that they were thinking too much.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator protecting Shi Xue and the others came up and swallowed hard, murmuring, "Even if the Grand Elder were here, he might not be able to trap him, right?"</p><p>A moment of silence.</p><p>They were unwilling to admit it, but this was probably the truth.</p><p>The Grand Elder might be able to defeat him, but it wouldn't be easy to keep him.</p><p>Unless they anticipated this person's strength in advance, made preparations before making a move, and left no loopholes.</p>
