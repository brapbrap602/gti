<h1>Chapter 238 Flaming Monkey</h1><p>Chapter 238 Flaming Monkey</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yunqing, farewell!"</p><p>Qinsang clasped his hands in farewell to Yunqing.</p><p>An auspicious cloud in five colors now floated above his head, without the need to control it with his mind, the cloud followed him automatically. As soon as Qinsang thought about it, the cloud would turn into a protective shield or rain down water drops to attack his enemies, both without consuming Qinsang's spiritual power.</p><p>However, if the cloud exhausted its power, it would eventually dissipate and could not last forever.</p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p>Yunqing's aura had clearly waned considerably. Splitting apart the power of the five-colored glass had taken a great toll on her, and she needed time to recuperate.</p><p>She returned the gesture of farewell, hastily sat down cross-legged to circulate her cultivation technique, and prepared to leave the legacy abode after recovering.</p><p>Qinsang walked to the edge of the stone disk, looking into the seemingly peaceful mist with a solemn face, devoid of any relief.</p><p>When he and Yunqing came to the stone disk, they had been mindful to conceal their auras, so as not to alarm the fire spirits in the mist. He did not know what these fire spirits were like, or what their abilities were.</p><p>Qinsang's figure gradually faded, and finally vanished into thin air. If he could pass through this level by relying on his concealing technique, that would naturally be the best option, but Qinsang knew deep down that it would not be that simple.</p><p>Advancing soundlessly along the chain, as soon as he entered the mist, Qinsang saw a red cloud of fire spirits fly past in front of him. He stopped where he was and observed them closely. The fire spirits looked very strange, rather like monkeys with wings.</p><p>Their thin lips and pointy chins, coupled with the two straight-up wings, were exceedingly ugly.</p><p>Thousands of fire monkeys cried out in a cacophony of screeches, sounding just like ordinary monkeys, rather than the singing of firebirds that could assault the primordial spirit. This suggested they must possess other abilities.</p><p>Their nature also resembled that of actual monkeys, frolicking and causing a general uproar.</p><p>However, the moment the red cloud flew past Qinsang, the clamorous cries abruptly stopped and all the fire monkeys suddenly ceased their antics, turning as one to look at Qinsang's hiding place. The eyes of all the monkeys flashed with a strange golden light and a trace of violence gradually emerged in their fixed gazes.</p><p>"Oops!"</p><p>Qinsang's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>In the previous level, the firebirds had forced intruders to use their spiritual power or consciousness to defend themselves by means of their cries. Someone like Qinsang, who could withstand the assault of sound waves, could use a concealing technique to avoid the birds' perception.</p><p>It seemed these flying monkeys could see straight through the concealing technique, rendering anyone invisible in their line of sight.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A gust of cold air suddenly blew.</p><p>Six ghost banners grew larger as they flew with the wind, instantly forming a large array around Qinsang.</p><p>When he had entered the mist, avoiding Yunqing's gaze, Qinsang had taken out the ghost banners in secret, prepared to use the Ten Directions閻羅 Array. Now that the fire spirits had discovered him, he naturally did not dare to hesitate.</p><p>The moment the Ten Directions閻羅 Array took shape, those flying monkeys suddenly let out a deafening scream. Their expressions twisted to the extreme, becoming even uglier. Their screams were filled with an endless sense of violence and rage.</p><p>The flying monkeys, now enraged, were driven by one thought: to tear apart the intruder who had entered their territory!</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Flames suddenly ignited all over the bodies of the flying monkeys, turning them into a sea of fire. The monkeys became even more frenzied, and those flames turned into rod-like weapons in their hands.</p><p>Then, amidst a series of piercing screams, all the flying monkeys charged towards Qinsang, countless rods forming a dense forest in the air!</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang... '</p><p>A volley of sharp cracks rang out like raindrops as countless rods struck the cloud shield.</p><p>The horde of flying monkeys engulfed Qinsang, and the power of the five-colored glass that he had activated on his behalf began to waver violently after taking the brunt of the monkeys' attack, much like a cloud caught in a hurricane, torn apart by the omnipresent force of chaos.</p><p>Fortunately, at this moment, the Ten Directions閻羅 banners emitted a vast amount of dark energy, and countless soul refiners swarmed out from the ghost banners, outnumbering the flying monkeys. The area around Qinsang transformed into a battlefield where soul refiners and flying monkeys fought.</p><p>"What formidable power!"</p><p>Qinsang's heart trembled. If he had not provided timely support, the fire monkeys would have almost shattered the five-colored glass. While the firebirds' sound waves assaulted the primordial spirit, these flying monkeys represented the ultimate power, demanding a head-on confrontation! Fortunately, despite the large number of flying monkeys, the evil spirits of the Ten Directions閻羅 Array were even more numerous, easily dividing the horde of monkeys and taking them down one by one.</p><p>But Qin Sang immediately found that the Flying Monkeys, after discovering they were no match for the Refined Souls, started merging. Several Flying Monkeys combined into one, with bodies several times larger and strength soaring. However, their agility was not affected in the slightest. With fierce aggression, they waved their long staffs and sent the approaching Refined Souls scattering.</p><p>Their merging seemed to be limitless. One giant monkey devoured hundreds of its kind in the blink of an eye and was already taller than Qin Sang!</p><p>At this moment, there was a chaotic shaking deep within the fog, which obviously meant that more and more Flying Monkeys were being drawn to the battle.</p><p>If all of these Flying Monkeys were to fuse into one, forming a colossal Flying Monkey, how terrifying would its strength be?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang shuddered. This was not a place to linger. And these Monkeys absolutely could not be allowed to keep merging!</p><p>Without hesitation, a sword light flashed between his eyebrows. The Ebony Sword let out a howl and rushed out, working with the Ten Directions Yama Formation to instantly slaughter most of the Flying Monkeys in front of Qin Sang, clearing a path.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed his body technique to the limit, using the Five-Color Glazed Light to protect his body while using the Ten Directions Yama Formation to kill as many Flying Monkeys as possible. His figure sped forward, flying away.</p><p>At the same time, his mind was not at ease, his Divine Consciousness spread out. The Ebony Sword shuttled back and forth like a fish, finding any Flying Monkey that had merged with dozens of others and prioritizing their destruction to prevent any accidents.</p><p>More and more Flying Monkeys charged out of the fog, but thankfully Qin Sang had found the right strategy and was still quite in control.</p><p>However, as time passed, the speed at which the Flying Monkeys merged grew faster and faster. The Ebony Sword alone could no longer handle it.</p><p>Behind Qin Sang, several giant Flying Monkeys had already appeared. With a swing of their staffs, they formed a flaming hurricane. Their power was so great that even Qin Sang was secretly alarmed. He could only dodge left and right.</p><p>As a result, he could no longer keep following the iron chains. He had to try to keep moving forward, taking it one step at a time.</p><p>Even worse, Qin Sang suddenly encountered another red cloud. This one seemed to be much more at ease surrounded by countless Flying Monkeys.</p><p>Obviously, Qin Sang was also discovered by the other party. The red cloud paused slightly and approached him without a word.</p><p>They were still far away, and with the monkeys blocking his vision, he could not see who it was at all.</p><p>This made Qin Sang's heart fill with alarm.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed and, after a moment's hesitation, he suddenly reached out and pointed at the Ten Directions Yama Formation.</p><p>The Six Main Souls, who were fighting hard, roared at the heavens and devoured all of the Refined Souls in the formation. In the blink of an eye, they transformed into six burly Fiends and charged fiercely at the giant monkeys in the back.</p><p>After the giant monkeys were torn apart by the Fiends, the situation on Qin Sang's side stabilized.</p><p>The red cloud stopped in its tracks for a moment, seeming to hesitate. After a moment, it started to move in the opposite direction, putting some distance between itself and Qin Sang before finally disappearing into the fog.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a cold snort and looked away.</p>
