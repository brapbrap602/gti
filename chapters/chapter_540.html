<h1>Chapter 533:  The Strange Transformation of the Green Yang Demon Fire</h1><p>Chapter 533:  The Strange Transformation of the Green Yang Demon Fire</p><p>The bronze cone, incredibly agile, missed its target and immediately reversed course, continuing its pursuit of Qin Sang.  Wu Youdao, using some unknown secret technique, also experienced a sudden surge in speed, rapidly closing the distance between himself and Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, a distant flying vessel, noticing the commotion, altered its course, increasing its speed to block Qin Sang's path.</p><p>Wu Youdao's eyes lit up. He shouted towards the vessel, "Form the Green Fire Flag Gate Array!"</p><p>At his command, the flying vessel came to an abrupt halt, perfectly positioned to obstruct Qin Sang's path to where he had hidden his treasure.</p><p>Nearly twenty figures then emerged from the vessel – all Foundation Establishment cultivators. The weakest were at the early Foundation Establishment stage, but they also included a Li surname cultivator, a powerful False Core expert.</p><p>Upon exiting the vessel, they levitated in mid-air. Three of them, including the Li surname cultivator, retrieved a green triangular flag from their storage pouches.</p><p>These triangular flags were identical to the ones Qin Sang had seen on Shen Gang Peak!</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The three simultaneously unleashed their flags.</p><p>Three green flags soared into the air, settling in the positions of the three talents (Heaven, Earth, and Man).</p><p>The others then channeled their Green Yang Demon Fire, continuously pouring it into the flag array, holding nothing back.</p><p>As the Green Yang Demon Fire continuously flowed in, the flags glowed even brighter, gradually forming a green fireball in their center.</p><p>The demon fire burned fiercely, radiating a savage aura.</p><p>Qin Sang felt an ominous premonition.</p><p>While most of the twenty individuals were not particularly strong – he could easily handle any one of them, or even all of them together, at his current level of power – those three flags seemed extremely dangerous.  Once they completed their so-called Green Fire Flag Gate Array, it would be a major problem!</p><p>He would then be facing an attack from both sides, placing him in a very precarious situation.</p><p>His only option was to destroy the array before its completion.</p><p>However, Wu Youdao was relentlessly harassing him with the bronze cone, preventing him from escaping.  With Wu Youdao so close, escaping was becoming increasingly difficult.</p><p>The bronze cone pressed its attack, striking again.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn't dodge. He used his spiritual sense to control the Blackwood Sword, clashing it against the bronze cone.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The two magical weapons collided for the first time, both trembling violently.</p><p>The Green Yang Demon Fire on the bronze cone dimmed, and the golden rings on its surface cracked, beginning to rapidly repair themselves.  The Blackwood Sword also flickered uncertainly.</p><p>Just then, an unnatural crimson light erupted from the center of the Blackwood Sword, instantly transforming it into a blood-red sword.</p><p>Seeing this, Wu Youdao felt a sudden premonition of danger. He reacted swiftly, attempting to retrieve the bronze cone, but he was too late.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Blackwood Sword swept out, its bloody aura striking the bronze cone directly.</p><p>In an instant, the demon fire on the bronze cone dissipated. The cracked golden rings ceased their repair, and the cone became dull and lifeless, like rusty patches, its spiritual essence severely damaged!</p><p>The blood-light ambush was highly effective.  As long as an opponent wasn't aware of the Blackwood Sword's blood-light ability, it was nearly impossible to avoid.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't used the blood-light technique immediately because he wasn't certain if the bronze cone was Wu Youdao's natal magic weapon.</p><p>Although Wu Youdao had only recently attained the Core Formation stage, the Green Yang Demon Sect had a deep heritage, and he might possess more than one magic weapon.</p><p>Qin Sang hoped to destroy Wu Youdao's natal magic weapon to significantly weaken him, increasing his chances of escape.  But he could delay no longer.</p><p>The bronze cone wobbled back into Wu Youdao's hands.</p><p>"Blood-light aura!"</p><p>Seeing the condition of his magic weapon, Wu Youdao was furious.  He never imagined he'd encounter a magical weapon forged from one of the Ten Great Divine Woods.</p><p>The bronze cone was unusable, requiring a long period of nurturing before it could be restored. Wu Youdao's hatred for Qin Sang intensified.</p><p>His gaze, cold and unwavering, fixed upon the Blackwood Sword. Knowing the blood-light technique couldn't be used again for a while, he turned his palm inward and patted his dantian.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A jade-green gourd flew out from Wu Youdao's dantian. Initially no bigger than a thumb, it rapidly expanded until it was barely manageable in one hand.</p><p>The gourd hovered above Wu Youdao's head, spinning, its opening pointed at Qin Sang.  Through the opening, one could see a fiery world within the gourd, where extremely pure Green Yang Demon Fire burned, poised to erupt.</p><p>"The bronze cone isn't his main magical weapon!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly upon seeing this, knowing she couldn't continue to be entangled with Wu Youdao.  She suddenly opened her right hand, revealing something in her palm, as if about to throw it.</p><p>A surge of energy was unleashed by Qin Sang.</p><p>"Void Lightning!"</p><p>Wu Youdao was busy manipulating his fire gourd when he glanced over, his expression suddenly changing.</p><p>Void Lightning was extremely rare, but even these Golden Core stage experts, even if they hadn't seen it in person, at least knew what it looked like and its power.  If he were struck by Void Lightning, he probably wouldn't see the next sunrise.</p><p>Wu Youdao was startled, his body halting abruptly as he quickly dodged.</p><p>However, the Void Lightning was merely a feint.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the Void Lightning's range was limited. Trying to kill her opponent in such an open area was futile, so she never intended to actually unleash it.  Very few had ever witnessed Void Lightning firsthand; Wu Youdao certainly wouldn't dare bet on whether she had truly activated it.</p><p>The facts proved Qin Sang right.</p><p>The moment Wu Youdao retreated, she immediately flew forward on her sword, her sword light like electricity, instantly reaching the Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Wu Youdao realized he'd been tricked, filled with regret, but it was too late to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>The Li cultivator remained calm, shouting, "Scatter!"</p><p>The others moved in a flash, dispersing immediately. However, their formation, though seemingly scattered, maintained internal connections; three green flags remained in place, unaffected.</p><p>The fireballs in the formation swelled suddenly, then transformed into a stream of fire, surging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Some of the Foundation Establishment cultivators' Green Sun Demon Fire had undergone a transformation within the green flags. This stream of fire, though seemingly thin, was exceptionally pure, and Qin Sang didn't dare underestimate it.</p><p>But after a moment's thought, Qin Sang made an unexpected move.  She showed no intention of dodging, her speed undiminished as she channeled her true energy, attempting a head-on collision with the fire stream.</p><p>The Green Sun Demon Fire's strength lay in its ability to cling to an opponent's spiritual energy or true energy like a parasitic growth, extremely difficult to remove.</p><p>Anyone else, knowing the Green Sun Demon Fire's power, would never have dared do this.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's arrogant move, the Green Sun Demon Sect cultivators sneered.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the next moment they nearly had their jaws drop.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully shattered the fire stream, only staggering slightly.</p><p>The flying embers, upon contacting Qin Sang's true energy, should have immediately adhered, burning fiercely and causing her immense suffering.</p><p>Instead, they acted as if they'd lost their fuel and extinguished themselves.</p>
