<h1>Chapter 876 Fang Ting</h1><p>When an avatar is too far from its original body, the connection fades.</p><p>Qin Sang dared to send his avatar in because it inherited his memories and could act independently. The only differences were cultivation level and physical body.</p><p>Of course, as a precaution, Qin Sang withheld some key secrets, such as his origins and the existence of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>The avatar, controlling a bamboo leaf artifact, flew over mountains and valleys towards Smokewater Pavilion.</p><p>Smokewater Pavilion was located deep within the Barrier Mountains, on an island in a vast lake stretching for dozens of miles.  Known for its water-based techniques, the sect had some local renown, also thanks to the Barrier Sect.</p><p>After flying for a while, the avatar found a place to briefly adjust its breath and then continued on its journey.</p><p>It was still some distance from Smokewater Pavilion.</p><p>The avatar looked towards the horizon, where the mountain peaks seemed to thin out, and a faint mist rose, indicating the location of the lake.</p><p>Suddenly, the flying avatar stopped, hovering in mid-air atop the bamboo leaf artifact, and turned its head to the left.</p><p>It was nearing noon, and the sun was high in the sky.</p><p>The thin mist in the mountains had mostly dispersed, revealing lush greenery, towering ancient trees, and the sounds of birds and animals, a vibrant scene.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang looked over, the crown of a tree in the forest shook violently, followed by a whooshing sound. A small figure appeared in Qin Sang's view.</p><p>A girl with short hair was flying towards him on a sword. Judging by her direction, she was probably also heading to Smokewater Pavilion.</p><p>Their eyes met, and the girl paused, immediately halting her sword.</p><p>"Qi Refinement Eighth Stage..."</p><p>The avatar thought to himself.</p><p>Without needing to cast a spell, the Skyeye Butterfly instantly saw through the girl's cultivation.</p><p>The girl seemed quite young. To have such a high level of cultivation at her age, she must have good talent and was likely also here for the Smokewater Pavilion disciple selection ceremony.</p><p>The avatar gave his competitor a long look and left without a word.</p><p>Smokewater Pavilion didn't select disciples through arena combat or the brutal battles like the Yuanzhao Sect.  The girl's talent, however great, wouldn't affect him.</p><p>The girl, initially wary, noticed the avatar's direction and, with a flicker of expression, actually followed, calling out, "Fellow Daoist, please wait..."</p><p>The avatar frowned slightly, slowed down, and turned to face the girl.</p><p>"My name is Fang Ting. May I ask for your name? Are you also going to the Smokewater Pavilion disciple selection ceremony?"</p><p>The short-haired girl quickly caught up on her sword, a blush rising on her cheeks as she introduced herself.</p><p>The girl had large eyes and a bright smile, revealing two small canine teeth.</p><p>"My name is Zhang Yue," the avatar replied amicably, not wanting to appear aloof. He figured the girl was likely to be chosen by Smokewater Pavilion, and a good relationship might be useful.</p><p>"Miss Fang, you also intend to join Smokewater Pavilion?"</p><p>Fang Ting nodded repeatedly. "Like Brother Zhang, I'm also going to the disciple selection ceremony. Since we've met so serendipitously, how about we travel together? I've heard the Barrier Mountains aren't entirely safe. The Barrier Sect, to temper its disciples, hasn't cleared out all the lesser demons in the mountains. Some of them can be quite difficult to deal with."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>The avatar feigned surprise. "I haven't encountered any demons along the way. It seems I've been lucky. Miss Fang seems quite knowledgeable about this area."</p><p>Fang Ting replied modestly, "Not really. I just live on a small island not far from Barrier Island and have heard some rumors. Is Brother Zhang not a cultivator from Barrier Island?"</p><p>"Indeed, I'm a rogue cultivator from Heron Island. I heard that a major sect here was selecting disciples, so I came..."</p><p>The avatar told the truth, not hiding his origins.</p><p>Fang Ting inquired about Heron Island's location and gasped, expressing admiration for his courage in traveling so far across the ocean.</p><p>After a brief exchange, the avatar agreed to travel together, and the two flew towards Smokewater Pavilion.</p><p>Fang Ting seemed very innocent, her conversation peppered with naive remarks.</p><p>However, the avatar knew that a girl of her age, with such cultivation, couldn't be entirely guileless. Her demeanor was likely a facade.</p><p>As long as the girl didn't harbor any ill will towards him, he wouldn't mind.</p><p>They chatted pleasantly and quickly became acquainted.</p><p>On their way, they did encounter a Mortal Demon stage monkey demon. They worked together to slay it, each taking half of the carcass. Fang Ting's smile widened, her eyes curving into crescents.</p><p>The avatar didn't value these meager spoils, but he pretended to be pleased and accepted his share.</p><p>After this battle, the avatar's performance increased Fang Ting's trust in him.</p><p>"Brother Zhang, you're so young and yet have such high cultivation, and your swordsmanship is so good. You'll definitely be chosen by Smokewater Pavilion!"</p><p>Fang Ting reassured the avatar.</p><p>The avatar slowly shook his head and said gravely, "My talent isn't good. I only experienced a sudden surge in cultivation due to a fortunate encounter during my travels. But I've nearly exhausted my potential. I don't know if I can break through to the tenth stage, let alone Foundation Establishment.  Smokewater Pavilion may not find me suitable. Miss Fang, you are truly the one with exceptional talent.  Don't forget about me after you join the great sect."</p><p>Fang Ting blushed slightly and said shyly, "I don't know if I'll be chosen either... Brother Zhang, don't lose heart. People often say talent doesn't mean everything.  Your significant improvement shows you have strong luck. You'll surely have more opportunities in the future."</p><p>The avatar nodded silently and glanced at Fang Ting discreetly.</p><p>No matter how deep the girl's cunning, it couldn't fool an old monster like him.</p><p>Fang Ting expressed concern about failing the selection, but there was a definite hint of confidence in her expression.  He wondered if her talent was truly exceptional or if she had some other advantage.</p><p>They chatted as they flew, crossing mountains and valleys, and before they knew it, they arrived at their destination.</p><p>Shimmering water appeared between two mountains.  They exchanged a glance and sped up, flying past the mountains.  Suddenly, their view opened up to a boundless lake.</p><p>Mist lingered over the center of the lake, where a sizable island could be faintly seen, with pavilions, towers, and bamboo groves.</p><p>The mist, neither dispersing nor accumulating, flowed rhythmically, clearly not a natural phenomenon.</p><p>"This is Smokewater Pavilion! We're finally here!"</p><p>Fang Ting cheered, then her gaze swept across the area and she pointed in the distance, exclaiming, "There are people over there!"</p><p>The avatar saw them too. On the shore of the lake, there was a large area of green stone, where dozens of figures were gathered, some sitting, some standing. He didn't know what they were doing.</p><p>Only after receiving information from the Skyeye Butterfly did he realize that these people were mostly at the Qi Refinement stage, probably, like them, here for the disciple selection ceremony.</p><p>Among them was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, a man in a blue robe, sitting cross-legged on the highest stone, wearing the insignia of a Smokewater Pavilion disciple at his waist.</p><p>"Holding the disciple selection ceremony in this wilderness seems a bit shabby," the avatar muttered to himself. He called out to Fang Ting and they flew over.</p>
