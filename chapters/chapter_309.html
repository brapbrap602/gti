Chapter 302: Driving the Tiger to Devour the Wolf

Although the Man-Headed Bird was powerful, its intelligence was limited. It only knew how to use brute force against the lightning and couldn't possibly break such a sophisticated restriction.  Fortunately, this was the case, allowing spiritual herbs like the Striped Yellow Essence to be preserved until now, instead of ending up in the bird's belly.

Yun Youzi had his eyes on a spiritual herb called the Nine Flowers Frost Grass.

Qin Sang had already collected the Striped Yellow Essence and stored it in a jade box. As he went to search for the Nine Flowers Frost Grass, he heard thunderous roars echoing from the back mountain. He knew that Shangguan Lifeng was harvesting the Bleeding Ghost Mushroom.

The seven spiritual herbs were: Bleeding Ghost Mushroom, Nine Flowers Frost Grass, Striped Yellow Essence, Smoky Herb, Spirit Jade Tree, Blue Dew Epiphyllum, and Ice Spirit Fruit.

Their values varied, but not drastically. In ancient times, none of them were considered particularly precious, far less so than the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.

Moreover, their medicinal effects were not uniform, each having its own focus. For someone in dire need of a specific herb, even one of lesser value would be more important than the others.

However, because they were protected by restrictions and had remained unharvested for a thousand years, coupled with their rarity in the current cultivation world – some even extinct – they had become treasures everyone fought over.

The Bleeding Ghost Mushroom was the most valuable of the seven. Qin Sang, Yun Youzi, and Ge Yuan all had their specific targets, and the Scholar in White didn't dare to compete with Luo Xingnan.

Qin Sang recalled what the Scholar in White had said through voice transmission:  "That Ice Spirit Fruit is enough for me."

The Ice Spirit Fruit was the least valuable of the seven.  The scholar wasn't greedy at all.

The Nine Flowers Frost Grass had three long, sword-shaped green leaves, like three sharp swords.  The leaves seemed to be coated with morning frost, surrounded by a faint moonlight glow, and emitted a subtle herbal fragrance.

Qin Sang's knowledge of spiritual herbs wasn't as extensive as Yun Youzi's, so he didn't know what kind of elixir the Nine Flowers Frost Grass could be used to refine.

However, having obtained the Striped Yellow Essence, Qin Sang was already very satisfied and didn't care about the rest.  Now, he needed to figure out how to leave this place safely with the herbs.

With the previous experience, Qin Sang harvested the Nine Flowers Frost Grass much faster.

At this time, the distant battle intensified significantly.  Qin Sang knew that the Golden Ring Formation wouldn't be able to suppress the Man-Headed Bird for much longer. He quickly stored the Nine Flowers Frost Grass in a jade box and rushed towards the location of the Blue Dew Epiphyllum.

With the Blue Dew Epiphyllum and the Ice Spirit Fruit, he had four spiritual herbs.

He and Shangguan Lifeng returned to the battlefield one after the other.

Shangguan Lifeng presented the three spiritual herbs he had collected. Luo Xingnan tossed the Spirit Jade Tree back to Shangguan Lifeng and pocketed the other two. He watched impassively as Qin Sang handed over the herbs to Yun Youzi and the others, making no other moves.

"Fellow Daoists, unleash your full power to activate the Golden Ring Formation's maximum strength. We can trap the Man-Headed Bird for three breaths.  Then, immediately descend the mountain. Don't delay!"

As Yun Youzi spoke, he poured his spiritual energy frantically into the copper ring he controlled. This ring, similar to the transparent jade of the Four Clouds Divine Restriction, was the core of the entire Golden Ring Formation.

Now sharing a common fate, upon hearing Yun Youzi's warning, everyone, including Luo Xingnan, didn't hesitate and immediately joined Yun Youzi in fully activating the Golden Ring Formation.

The seven copper rings surrounded the Man-Headed Bird, vibrating incessantly with a crisp, clanging sound.

Immediately afterward, countless illusory images erupted, trailing streaks of yellow light, engulfing the Man-Headed Bird. These illusory images merged in mid-air, forming a massive and solid copper ring that tightly bound the creature.

The Man-Headed Bird shrieked incessantly but couldn't break free from the copper ring's restraints in the short term.

"Go!"

Yun Youzi immediately retracted the Golden Ring Formation and turned to flee down the mountain.

The others followed closely behind.

Seven streaks of light, each a different color, flew at roughly the same speed.  Because they had enough time, Yun Youzi and Luo Xingnan deliberately controlled their pace, and Qin Sang didn't use his Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman.

The escaping lights were clearly divided into two groups. Shangguan Lifeng stayed with Luo Xingnan, while the Scholar in White followed Qin Sang and the others closely, surrounding Yun Youzi.

The two sides subconsciously kept a distance, neither interfering with the other.

Luo Xingnan didn't make any moves until they returned to the restriction.

He seemed to have accepted the outcome.

At the last moment, they saw the ferocious figure of the Man-Headed Bird in hot pursuit. However, as they entered the restriction, the screeching sound immediately disappeared.

The Man-Headed Bird didn't follow them in, which eased everyone's expressions, but they weren't completely relieved.

They moved through the restriction even faster than before.  The exit was just ahead. Once they passed through the Hook Serpents' territory, they could leave this place.

Before they could steady themselves, Luo Xingnan gave them a cold glance and, without a word, suddenly shot forward with Shangguan Lifeng.

In that instant, his speed reached its peak.  Since everyone else was at the early stage of Foundation Establishment, logically, no one should have been faster than him.

Luo Xingnan's intentions were crystal clear: he was emulating Yu Kong's tactic of driving the tiger to devour the wolf!

The Hook Serpents had suffered heavy casualties, and their king was also severely injured and dying. If they could cooperate fully and use the Golden Ring Formation, escaping without alerting the Hook Serpents beforehand wouldn't be difficult.

There could have been a happy ending for everyone.

But Luo Xingnan was clearly not satisfied with just two spiritual herbs!

Unlike Ge Yuan's shock and anger, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi showed no panic at this scene. Instead, they sneered at Luo Xingnan's actions.

No matter how fast Luo Xingnan was, could he match Yun Youzi's Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat?

*Whoosh!*

A streak of light flew out from Yun Youzi's palm, expanding in the wind to reveal the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat.

"Quick…"

Yun Youzi and Qin Sang leaped onto the boat.  Just as they were about to urge Ge Yuan and the Scholar in White, a familiar screech came from above.

Everyone was startled and looked up abruptly.

They saw the restriction above violently shaking.  Within the restriction, a huge black shadow was squeezing its way through.

It was the Man-Headed Bird!

The Man-Headed Bird struggled through the layers of the restriction. Its body seemed distorted by the pressure, and its cries were filled with pain, but it didn't suffer any serious injuries.

Its feathers were exceptionally bright, shining with a strange luster.  It was this luster that protected it from the restriction.

The fact that the restriction here couldn't trap the Man-Headed Bird surprised everyone greatly. They immediately realized that it was likely a deliberate arrangement by the cave's owner.

After all, the Man-Headed Bird was the owner's guardian spirit beast.

The Man-Headed Bird looked down from above, letting out sharp shrieks. Its eyes, filled with murderous intent, glared fiercely at Qin Sang and the others, as if they had an irreconcilable blood feud with these herb thieves who had injured it.

This wasn't the worst of it.

What made everyone even more panicked was that as the Man-Headed Bird's shrieks echoed through the space, the ground began to tremble.  A wisp of red mist rose from the abyss ahead, accompanied by a familiar hissing sound.

They knew this sound very well.

Without Luo Xingnan's intervention, the Hook Serpents had already been awakened by the Man-Headed Bird!
