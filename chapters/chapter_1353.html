<h1>Chapter 1345: Bai's Entreaty</h1><p>A shadowy figure looked down on the battlefield.</p><p>Its eyes, condensed from white light, subtly shifted, settling on the bone claw.</p><p>It raised its right hand, extended its index finger, and lightly tapped the bone claw.</p><p>Simultaneously,</p><p>Daoist Zhen appeared from a shower of light.</p><p>A gentle breeze and light rain created a hazy atmosphere.</p><p>His figure seemed somewhat ethereal, his movements no slower than Grandmaster Cang Hong's; he quickly formed a hand seal, then clasped his hands together. A phantom array shot out from his palm.</p><p>Grandmaster Cang Hong targeted the bone claw itself.</p><p>The instant the shadowy figure tapped, the void trembled. A pinpoint of white light struck the bone claw with perfect timing.</p><p>'Clack clack clack...'</p><p>The white light seemed to contain thousands of blades, frantically cutting at the ghostly claw.</p><p>While Daoist Zhen chose to protect Qin Sang.</p><p>The array flashed, appearing between Qin Sang and the bone claw, unfolding and rising, its center directly facing the claw, spinning rapidly.</p><p>The array stirred the wind and clouds, its runes flickering.</p><p>Two top-tier experts simultaneously made their move, unleashing extraordinary secret techniques to jointly stop the bone claw!</p><p>The next moment, a look of shock appeared on all three faces!</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The white light dimmed, countless filaments scattering.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A hole in the shape of a hand ripped through the center of the array.</p><p>The bone claw forcefully broke through the two obstacles, its momentum slightly reduced, but still brimming with demonic energy!</p><p>At this critical juncture,</p><p>A dark shadow dashed forward, just barely inserting itself between Qin Sang and the bone claw—it was the Yuan Ying spirit puppet, appearing to save its master.</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet knew no fear, facing the bone claw directly. Its expression remained rigidly unchanged, it charged forward.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet and the bone claw collided.</p><p>In an instant, a dark shadow flew back, crashing heavily to the ground.</p><p>Shockingly, a claw mark appeared on the Yuan Ying puppet's chest, deeply embedded in its torso.  An ordinary person would have been disemboweled.</p><p>The Yuan Ying puppet sprang back up, the claw mark on its chest smoothing over at a visible rate. It appeared unscathed, only the damaged puppet seal within revealing its injury.</p><p>Yu Gu was rather surprised.</p><p>While aware it was a puppet body, and this wouldn't cause a fatal wound, the puppet's easy recovery surprised it. It was clearly crafted from superior spiritual materials.</p><p>However, its target was not the puppet; its soul fire remained fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>With Grandmaster Cang Hong, Daoist Zhen, and the Yuan Ying spirit puppet working together to block it, the bone claw finally stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to retreat, his vigilance unabated, for he knew that Yu Gu had its sights set on him, and would not give up until it achieved its goal!</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>Yu Gu's true form appeared, its head turning, sweeping over Grandmaster Cang Hong and Daoist Zhen.  The soul fire in its eyes suddenly erupted.</p><p>Daoist Zhen felt an immediate warning, his figure instantly shifting dozens of meters, then felt a sharp pain.  He discovered in horror that his Thousand Jade Whisk had reverted to its original form, surrounded by soul fire, and quickly retracted it.</p><p>Grandmaster Cang Hong groaned, blood trickling from his mouth, the shadowy figure behind him shattering.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>Beams of treasure light continuously shot out from the blood clouds, all converging on Yu Gu.</p><p>By this time, the other Yuan Ying cultivators had finally steadied themselves from the initial shock. Seeing the situation outside, they all summoned their treasures to provide support.</p><p>Daoist Zhen and Grandmaster Cang Hong suppressed their injuries and attacked again.</p><p>Yu Gu coldly snorted, its face full of disdain, its figure vanishing on the spot.</p><p>All the Yuan Ying cultivators were battle-hardened.  Though unable to see through Yu Gu's movements, they could judge from its determination to capture Qin Sang, and all unanimously redirected their treasures.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Streams of light scattered.</p><p>Their attacks struck a single point, but only a phantom of Yu Gu was destroyed.</p><p>A purple light burst forth from Yu Gu, surging like a tide, directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Yuan Ying spirit puppet was predictably sent flying again.</p><p>Qin Sang was affected, his body trembling violently.</p><p>He held the Soul Binding Rope, but hadn't used it yet.</p><p>Bai had secretly sent the Soul Binding Rope, instructing him to use it against Yu Gu if he felt his life was in danger. However, he should avoid using it unless absolutely necessary, to buy him as much time as possible.</p><p>Yu Gu's power is terrifying.  It's hard to say whether it's stronger or weaker than the demonic spirit from Yi Tian Peak. Qin Sang lacked the ability to confront the demonic spirit back then, so she couldn't judge.  But it's certain that the demonic lord of Cang Lang Sea and Ling Zhuzi are no match for it!</p><p>"This thing has its eyes on me..."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and she wielded her ebony sword again.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>This time, the sword array lasted even less time.</p><p>Daoist Zhen and the others dared not delay, hurriedly deploying their own trump cards to rescue her.</p><p>Those present might not have any particular fondness for Qin Sang, but absolutely no one wanted to see her die at Yu Gu's hands. If that happened, their own situation would become extremely perilous.</p><p>Seeming to be at her wit's end, Qin Sang made a final gamble, forcefully flicking her sleeve. Eighteen demonic banners swirled out, their demonic flames unleashed, transforming into a fire dragon poised to strike.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Yu Gu laughed wildly. This was precisely what it had been waiting for. Killing Qin Sang would be a permanent solution, but even if it couldn't kill her, forcing her to use the demonic fire would still achieve its objective.</p><p>Upon seeing the demonic fire, Yu Gu relentlessly pursued Qin Sang.</p><p>A strange suction force appeared in the void.  Soul energy filled the air, and a pitch-black funnel materialized before everyone.</p><p>The funnel was only palm-sized, yet its power was astonishing.  The surrounding blood clouds were affected, swirling and twisting.</p><p>The funnel inverted, aimed directly at Qin Sang—or rather, at the eighteen demonic banners surrounding her.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, the formation unfolded, but the banners didn't become several zhang high.  Each one was less than a person's height, whirling around her.</p><p>The suction force descended.</p><p>The banners trembled violently, showing signs of instability.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, pouring all her true energy into the banners, yet she couldn't stabilize them.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The banners shook even more fiercely.</p><p>The demonic fire, previously formed into a fire dragon, now had clumps of flames peeling away, drifting towards the funnel.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone was shocked.</p><p>They finally understood why Yu Gu relentlessly pursued Qin Sang: it coveted the demonic fire in her possession, and it had the power to forcibly seize it—an act of extreme tyranny!</p><p>Even more astonishing, Qin Sang could clearly sense that the remaining demonic fire sealed within the banners was also becoming restless, the flames writhing, attempting to break the seals.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The soul-silk banners fluttered violently, giving the impression that they were about to be torn apart at any moment.</p><p>No matter how hard Qin Sang tried, she couldn't control the demonic fire, nor could she prevent the funnel from drawing it in.</p><p>Yu Gu formed a hand seal and forcefully struck the funnel.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The demonic fire, which had formed into a fire dragon, suddenly erupted, escaping Qin Sang's control and involuntarily floating upwards.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly raised her head, gazing coldly at Yu Gu, her expression devoid of any anxiety.
