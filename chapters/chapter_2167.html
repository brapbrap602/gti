<h1>Chapter 2157: Mirror God Art</h1><p>The two evenly divided the spoils and stealthily approached the lair of the Great Fiend.</p><p>The traces left by the Great Fiend were incredibly obvious.  The lingering deathly aura could be sensed from afar, so they didn't need to risk getting close. Following the trail alone would lead them to its lair.</p><p>Here, mountain peaks stood in dense clusters, and rivers flowed ceaselessly.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi didn't rashly approach the lair.  Instead, they landed on a distant mountain peak and surveyed the area from afar.</p><p>Even from this distance, they could still see the grey miasma, exuding an aura of decay and decline. This miasma must have lingered there for a long time and wouldn't dissipate quickly, even after the Great Fiend's departure.</p><p>The hiding places of Great Fiends often exhibited similar phenomena, allowing cultivators to avoid them from a distance.</p><p>“This Great Fiend…”</p><p>Seeing the grey mist, Shaoshi's eyes flickered. He seemed to recall something and fell into deep thought.</p><p>Qin Sang kept his gaze fixed on the direction the Great Fiend had left.  The fiend was no longer in sight, and its oppressive aura was undetectable, but it could return to its lair at any moment, so they still needed to be cautious.</p><p>They paused here not only to observe the Great Fiend's movements but also to see if any competitors would help scout the way.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Shaoshi shook his head slightly and said, “This Great Fiend’s previous lair shouldn't have been here. Someone once witnessed a similar phenomenon within the Sacred Ground.  Unfortunately, there isn’t detailed information, so it's uncertain if it's the same one."</p><p>They waited for a long time, and everything remained normal.  The two decided not to wait any longer and set off immediately, aiming for a swift round trip.</p><p>They left the mountain and quietly approached the lair.  Halfway there, Shaoshi unveiled the Eight Trigrams Diagram of Uncertainty.</p><p>The treasure map slowly unfolded, and wisps of primordial Xuanhuang energy seeped into the earth.  An obscure fluctuation spread through the surrounding mountains and rivers, quickly returning to normal.  Having preemptively deployed the treasure map as a precaution, the two continued towards the Great Fiend’s lair.</p><p>As they neared the grey miasma, a putrid odor assaulted them. Within the miasma were numerous black, lifeless mountains, and at their bases lay foul-smelling, decaying swamps.  No trace of life could be found here.</p><p>They stopped at the edge of the grey miasma and scanned the area. The mist obstructed their vision and perception.  Spotting a fractured mountain peak among the range, they flashed into the mist.</p><p>Enveloped by the grey mist, they immediately sensed something strange and exchanged glances, both circulating their True Essence in defense.</p><p>The moment they contacted the grey mist, it seemed to possess life, attempting to invade their bodies.  The mist wasn't composed of dust or water droplets but resembled incredibly fine, downy hairs, searching for fertile ground to take root and sprout.</p><p>The grey mist carried a powerful invasive and corrosive force.  Once it entered the body and gained the upper hand, it would seize everything from its host, transforming them into monsters covered in downy hairs, ultimately leading to death and decay.</p><p>"Not a living thing," Shaoshi transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He, too, realized these downy hairs weren't living beings, or even truly tangible.  When they tried to grab them, they grasped nothing.  This was a power they'd never encountered before, and the downy hairs were its manifestation.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Grey Warbler Sword and silently unleashed a sword beam. The beam cleaved a gap in the grey mist, which instantly closed.</p><p>He sensed some of the downy hairs annihilated by the sword beam, but the effect wasn't as significant as he'd expected, considering this was merely the residual power of a Body Integration stage Great Fiend.</p><p>With their strength, completely clearing the grey mist would be difficult, and they didn't have the time to waste here.  Defense had to be their priority. However, this meant they couldn't perfectly conceal their auras as they had before, due to the constant need to resist the mist's invasion.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no other cultivators around.  Qin Sang and Shaoshi each employed protective secret techniques.  Qin Sang even summoned his Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>Continuing onward, the grey mist's power intensified, as they had anticipated, but it couldn't halt their advance.</p><p>The scene around the fractured mountain gradually became clearer, but Qin Sang had already seen it beforehand using his Heavenly Eye divine ability.</p><p>Deeper within the fractured mountain, the earth was in ruins, littered with the remnants of collapsed mountain peaks.  The swamps were filled with rubble, painting a picture of a great upheaval.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi deduced that this likely wasn't the Great Fiend’s true lair. They continued deeper, reaching the innermost area, where the sight before them made their hearts tighten.</p><p>It was a vast black mud swamp.  There were no mountain peaks within the swamp, perhaps flattened by the Great Fiend, although some traces were impossible for the swamp to conceal.</p><p>They noticed a deep pit beneath the swamp, its bottom filled with bottomless ravines crisscrossing and tearing the earth apart.</p><p>All signs indicated the Great Fiend’s lair should be nearby but was undoubtedly in ruins.  The pit and ravines were new.</p><p>"This should be the source of the rosy glow," Shaoshi deduced based on Ji Qiong’s description.  Looking around, he couldn't help but sigh, "It looks like a battlefield!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.</p><p>He discovered something unusual about the ground beneath the swamp. It was covered in a type of spiritual material called Tortoise Shell Stone. Once a Tortoise Shell Stone vein formed, it became incredibly hard.  Several Tortoise Shell Stone mountains likely existed here originally, their hardness imaginable, capable of withstanding even the battles of Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>"We can only detect the aura of that Great Fiend here," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Shaoshi nodded. "Unless the Great Fiend suddenly went berserk, there’s another possibility: it fought a battle with a non-existent enemy.”</p><p>This speculation seemed unbelievable, but Shaoshi explained, "Things that defy common sense often occur within the Sacred Ground, without any discernible pattern. This is also part of the trial. If that rosy glow is related to this trial, we need to be careful.”</p><p>The rosy glow could drive a Great Fiend from its lair, so how could they be arrogant?</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi meticulously searched the swamp and its surroundings but found nothing unusual.  All signs pointed to the Great Fiend suddenly going berserk, destroying its own lair, and migrating elsewhere.</p><p>“The rosy glow hasn’t left any traces, and its source is unknown," Qin Sang said, frowning.</p><p>"If it's related to the secrets of the trial, it won’t be easily deciphered. To understand the truth, we'd likely need to find that Great Fiend, or even slay it, to see if it carried away anything special."</p><p>Shaoshi said, understanding that this was impossible. His tone shifted, "There's another possibility: a passage to leave the Sacred Ground is hidden here, but the time hasn't come for it to appear."</p><p>Their search yielded no results, and their various speculations couldn’t be verified. After discussing, they decided to follow the Great Fiend’s escape route to see if they could find other clues; otherwise, they could only give up.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi left the swamp, following the traces, and quickly arrived at the edge of the grey mist.</p><p>Just as they were about to fly out of the mist, Qin Sang seemed to sense something. His expression shifted slightly, and he abruptly looked towards a mountain peak ahead, simultaneously transmitting a warning: "Ambush!"</p><p>Shaoshi immediately detected the anomaly as well, but a step slower than Qin Sang. If not for Qin Sang’s warning, he might have needed to approach the mountain peak to discover it.</p><p>Their figures abruptly halted, and then they heard a silvery laughter.</p><p>"Such keen spiritual senses!"</p><p>In the next moment, the space above the mountain peak distorted, and an oval mirror appeared. The mirror’s surface was composed of water, with a constant stream flowing within, resembling a Water Curtain Cave.</p><p>Shaoshi’s voice deepened: "Mirror God Art! It's a Merfolk!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He hadn't expected to encounter a Merfolk expert so soon after entering the Sacred Ground.</p><p>During his time at the Yuanjiao Sea Market, he'd gained a clearer understanding of the Feathered Race’s strength, and the Merfolk, as the rulers of the water domain, were on par with them!</p><p>This Mirror God Art was also quite profound. Only upon closer inspection did the Heavenly Eye Butterfly detect the anomaly.</p><p>Faint shadows appeared behind the water curtain. A slender hand lifted the curtain, revealing a being with a human torso and a fishtail.  It swam out from behind the curtain with elegant and refined movements, as if welcoming guests.</p><p>The Merfolk revered women, with males merely serving as subordinates, holding a low status.  It was said this custom arose because the Merfolk’s innate divine abilities were more compatible with women, resulting in most of the clan’s experts being female.</p><p>The figure before them was indeed a Merfolk woman. Her lower body was a long fishtail, its blue scales reflecting shimmering light.  Her upper body was no different from a human woman’s, but her skin was exceptionally pale, and her features were breathtakingly beautiful. She had blue hair and blue eyes, her gaze shifting like gentle ripples, sometimes妩媚and alluring, sometimes delicate and pitiful.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi, both individuals with strong minds, wouldn't be seduced by her appearance.  Simultaneously, as the Merfolk woman revealed herself, a sense of foreboding arose in their hearts.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>Qin Sang, who had never relaxed his vigilance, immediately activated his sword art, and sword light flashed before him.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang and Shaoshi felt the surrounding atmosphere drastically change, the world turning a cerulean blue.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the void transformed into a watery domain, and they unknowingly descended to the seabed.  The seawater, however, was incredibly strange, fluctuating like clusters of blue flames.</p><p>“Be careful, Fellow Daoist Qin!  This is the Merfolk’s divine ability, the Everlasting Flame!  This flame is said to burn for ten thousand years without extinguishing. Once touched by it, it clings like a leech, difficult to remove, burning all the way to the bone marrow."</p><p>Shaoshi quickly transmitted his voice while simultaneously throwing a silver streak from his right hand.  The silver streak divided, transforming into small silver rings, each containing a powerful but distinct aura.</p><p>These auras originated from his companion beasts, clearly a sophisticated method of utilizing their power.</p><p>The small rings spun, encircling Shaoshi. Ripples of energy emanated outwards, forcing the blue flames to recede, unable to harm him.</p><p>Seeing the gravity in Shaoshi’s tone, Qin Sang didn't dare be careless. He abandoned the idea of trapping the Merfolk woman with his sword array. The Grey Warbler Sword abruptly unleashed a sword beam.</p><p>The sword beam arced like a rainbow, and the Everlasting Flames retreated.</p><p>Pressing his advantage, Qin Sang’s sword beam slashed towards the Merfolk woman. Shaoshi reacted swiftly as well, four beast shadows leaping from the silver rings, roaring like thunder as they pounced on the mountain peak.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The Merfolk woman allowed the sword beam to pierce her, her entire being exploding like a burst of water.</p><p>Immediately after, from another mountain behind her, giggling echoed, and a mass of water coalesced, reforming into the Merfolk woman's shape.</p><p>With a beaming smile, the Merfolk woman fixed her beautiful eyes on Qin Sang, asking in surprise, “Are you a human cultivator?”</p><p>Then, she scolded Shaoshi in a coquettish voice, "You are the Shaoshi under Si Huang, aren’t you? You dare to privately bring outsiders into the Sacred Ground!  What is your crime?!"</p><p>Shaoshi sneered, too lazy to argue with her, and retorted, “Which princess of the Merfolk are you, daring to ambush me?!"</p><p>The Merfolk had an Empress, the supreme ruler of the clan. Whenever talented offspring appeared, recognized by the Empress, they would be conferred the title of Princess.  Upon passing the Empress’s trials, princesses could receive fiefdoms and be crowned as queens.</p><p>Shaoshi knew the names of all the current Merfolk queens.  This Merfolk woman before him wasn't renowned but was a late-stage expert, no weaker than the queens.  She must be at least a princess.</p><p>The Merfolk woman scoffed, “Do I need a reason to ambush you Heavenly Department people? It's a pity that this princess underestimated you. Leave behind the things you obtained from within, and this princess will let you leave! Otherwise, you don't think that you, along with a mid-stage Void Refinement cultivator, are a match for this princess, do you?”</p><p>While Shaoshi and the Merfolk woman exchanged words, Qin Sang remained tense.</p><p>He sensed an unfamiliar aura locking onto him, searching for an opportunity.  Another expert was hidden beside the Merfolk woman!</p><p>This person’s aura was erratic, making it difficult for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to pinpoint.  Qin Sang suspected that this person was also employing the Mirror God Art, but more cautiously.</p><p>“I think it’s best not to get entangled with them for too long.  What are your thoughts, Brother Qin?”</p><p>Shaoshi transmitted his voice.</p><p>Fleeing without a fight would be a loss of face, but pride was secondary. Continuing to tangle with the Merfolk woman wasn’t in their best interest.</p><p>They initially believed there was a great opportunity here, but their search had yielded nothing.</p><p>Once they clashed with the Merfolk woman, it would be difficult to determine a victor quickly, making obtaining any opportunity even harder.  Moreover, they weren’t confident of victory. Si Huang’s matter was more important; they didn't have time to waste here.</p><p>Surrendering the Great Fiend’s lair was a pity, but in Qin Sang and Shaoshi's view, continuing the search might not uncover anything and could be a waste of effort.</p><p>The advantages and disadvantages were clear, making the decision easy.</p><p>In truth, even without the Merfolk woman’s interference, they would have given up after searching for a while longer without results.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to speak, a glint flashed in his eyes, and he looked towards the edge of the battlefield.</p><p>A plume of red smoke, exceptionally vibrant in color, was rising from the distant horizon and moving towards them.</p><p>Wherever the red smoke passed, large and small red mushrooms sprouted from the ground.  The larger ones had caps that unfurled like small hills, while the smaller ones were as tiny as ants, countless and densely packed.</p><p>Shaoshi’s expression changed slightly. "It’s the Fungus People!"</p><p>The Fungus People were one of the higher races of the water domain.  It was said their size was even smaller than the Jiaojiao race, making them the small people of the water domain. They possessed unique divine abilities, often only revealing mushrooms in their surroundings, concealing their true forms.</p><p>The red smoke’s speed increased, as if a fungal carpet was unrolling across the earth, rapidly spreading towards them.  Only the countless sprouting red mushrooms were visible, the Fungus People themselves hidden.</p><p>They hadn't expected to encounter three waves of water domain experts here consecutively, without seeing a single Heavenly Department expert. There was no reason to stay any longer.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the location of the lair and the direction the Great Fiend had fled.  He and Shaoshi immediately joined forces, beast shadows and sword light surging outwards.</p><p>The Everlasting Flames churned, then launched an even fiercer counterattack.</p><p>The Merfolk woman, noticing the arrival of the Fungus People and believing their side had the advantage, attempted to detain Shaoshi and Qin Sang. However, Qin Sang and Shaoshi cooperated closely, never giving the hidden expert a chance to strike, fighting and retreating simultaneously, successfully withdrawing to the vicinity of the Eight Trigrams Diagram of Uncertainty.</p>
