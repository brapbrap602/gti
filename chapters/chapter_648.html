<h1>Chapter 640: Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit</h1><p>“Such a large expanse of poison springs is truly rare. Unfortunately, the toxicity is too weak, requiring an extra purification step. It's not as good as the smaller springs controlled by the Imperial Spirit Sect.”</p><p>Qin Sang stood by the lake, his divine sense spreading out, taking in the surroundings.</p><p>Although it was a poison spring, the water itself appeared no different from ordinary spring water, crystal clear.</p><p>The formation of poison springs is complex, often due to sudden, drastic changes in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which cause the accumulation of toxins.  Later, even when the spiritual energy returns to normal, the spring remains poisoned.</p><p>Qin Sang probed the ground and crevices with his divine sense, searching inch by inch.</p><p>“Senior, have you made any discoveries?”</p><p>Just then, Cui Xuanzi arrived, panting.  Qin Sang didn't wait for him, his figure flashing as he directly entered the deepest part of the mine, searching it thoroughly.</p><p>At the mouth of Blackwind Valley, a sword light pierced through the gloomy wind, circled in the air, then shot towards the heart of the Western Frontier, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A moment later, Cui Xuanzi returned to the valley entrance.</p><p>He bowed respectfully in the direction Qin Sang had departed.</p><p>After a full quarter of an hour, Cui Xuanzi finally straightened up, retracted his gaze, and glanced into Blackwind Valley. A hesitant expression appeared on his face, but he finally shook his head gently and ordered inwards, “Seal the entrance. No one is allowed to enter or exit, except for me.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Spiritual energy surged within Blackwind Valley, sealing off the entrance.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi flew off, returning to the Five Venom Sect.</p><p>As soon as he entered the sect, he saw Junior Brother Tong emerge from the shadows. Seeing that Cui Xuanzi was alone, he approached with an anxious expression and was about to speak when Cui Xuanzi glared at him fiercely.</p><p>Junior Brother Tong suddenly understood and closed his mouth.</p><p>The two flew back to the main hall in silence.  After some idle chatter over tea, they activated a mechanism and entered a secret chamber.</p><p>Activating the restrictions within the chamber, both of them let out a sigh of relief in unison.</p><p>Junior Brother Tong couldn't hold back any longer, “Senior Brother, he didn't discover the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit in the poison spring, did he?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi closed his eyes in thought, shaking his head. "No. Before the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit ripens, its spiritual power won't leak out of the ancient restriction, and the spring water won't show any abnormalities.  Since Blackwind Valley was discovered, cultivators have been coming and going constantly, and none of them found the ancient restriction. No matter how high his cultivation is, he couldn't have easily detected it. If it weren't for our Uncle's good fortune, happening to enter Blackwind Valley to refine the poison spring water right when the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was ripening, our Five Venom Sect would have missed out on this spiritual fruit."</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Junior Brother Tong nodded repeatedly. "The Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit can actually help venomous insect spirits undergo their third transformation! I used to think it was just a legend, but now I know it's true. Our Uncle truly has exceptional luck to encounter such a great opportunity. His natal insect underwent its transformation, and then he successfully formed his Core. And there were actually three Thousand-Hand Spider Fruits on the tree! It's a pity they don't ripen at the same time. It's been nearly a hundred years since the first one ripened, and only now is the second one showing signs of maturity…"</p><p>Junior Brother Tong spoke at length, but didn't receive a response. Seeing Cui Xuanzi deep in thought, he couldn't help but ask curiously, “Senior Brother, what are you thinking about?”</p><p>"I'm reflecting on whether there were any flaws in my words or actions during this period, especially when facing that old ghost Qin."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi said in a deep voice, “That man is definitely not some secluded cultivator who stays in his cave all the time.  Even a single slip-up could lead to discovery.”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong empathized, sighing, “This time has truly been full of twists and turns. My heart has been up and down.  Fortunately, we've managed to protect Blackwind Valley and the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit. Otherwise, with the fruit about to ripen, if Blackwind Valley had changed hands, it would have fallen into the possession of others.  It's fortunate that Senior Brother was willing to take the risk and befriend that old ghost Qin…  It’s such a coincidence that Thunderclap Fortress and Hundred Flowers Palace attacked together while that old ghost Qin was present. Could that have been orchestrated by Senior Brother as well?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi snorted.  “If it were truly orchestrated by me, the regional overlord of Bear Mountain would have already changed! Junior Brother Tong, don't treat Core Formation cultivators as fools, always trying to scheme against them. I merely sensed the coming storm and, knowing Old Man Thunderclap's temperament, guided things along.  He’s a devout believer in the Witch God, seeking his protection for everything. It’s quite possible he’d choose the Witch God Festival for such an important matter.  Even if he hadn't come, I still had ways to place myself under that old ghost Qin's protection. As long as I'm willing to be a loyal and useful dog, would he be willing to kick me aside?”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong's face showed a hint of sympathy. “Senior Brother, you've suffered too much indignity.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi shook his head.  “All our careful planning is just to buy us a few more years, until the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit ripens. What indignity is there to speak of?”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong said hatefully, “The fruit is about to ripen. Once Senior Brother’s natal insect consumes it, our sect will have a third-transformation insect spirit, and we won't have to put up with anyone else's condescending attitude!”</p><p>“Absolutely not!”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi stopped Junior Brother Tong. “Not to mention that the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit only increases the probability of transformation, it doesn't guarantee it. Even if the transformation is successful and I successfully form my Core, we still cannot show any disrespect towards that old ghost Qin.  If I, as a Core Formation cultivator, offer my allegiance to him, he’ll surely be interested.”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong's face was full of unwillingness.  “After Senior Brother forms your Core, we will be able to dominate. Why should we remain subservient…”</p><p>He stopped mid-sentence, his face showing alarm. “Senior Brother, after forming your Core, are you… are you also planning to leave the Five Venom Sect?”</p><p>"What are you thinking? What future does the Five Venom Sect have, stuck in the Western Frontier? That man's origins are extraordinary. He must have a powerful backing, which could be our sect's opportunity to leave the Western Frontier. It's just a matter of humbling ourselves for a while.  It's all benefit and no harm to us."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi glared at him, then suddenly frowned, as if remembering something.  “Do you still resent our Uncle?”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong remained silent, his lips pressed together.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi sighed. “Back then, our Uncle and the sect didn’t get along. He was an orphan taken in by our Grand Master, but the reason he became an orphan can't be separated from our Grand Master… I’ve never told you these secrets.”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong was utterly shocked.</p><p>“…Before our Uncle left, he left the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit tree to the sect and suppressed the surrounding powers, ensuring the Five Venom Sect's prosperity for a hundred years. He has already done his utmost. It is we who are incompetent, failing our ancestors.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi’s face was filled with shame.</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>Cui Xuanzi waved his hand.  “The past is the past. There’s no need to dwell on it. As long as I can form my Core, these are all minor matters.  Listen to me, don’t have any unnecessary thoughts.  Take good care of the woman that old ghost Qin left behind.  Cultivate her at all costs."</p><p>“Her?”</p><p>Junior Brother Tong hesitated.  “Senior Brother, what do you think the relationship between Ya Gu and that old ghost Qin really is?  Arranging her to cultivate in the sect’s best cave dwelling has already caused discontent among some disciples…”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi also frowned slightly.</p><p>He initially thought that since Ya Gu had been chosen by Qin Sang, she must possess extraordinary talent.  Later, he discovered that she only had four spiritual roots.</p><p>In the days since Ya Gu joined the sect, she had only focused on cultivating, not interacting with anyone. Even he, her nominal master, couldn’t get a single word out of her.</p><p>If one didn’t know better, one would think she was mute.</p>
