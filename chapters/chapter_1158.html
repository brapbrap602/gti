<h1>Chapter 1150: The Qingluan Consciousness</h1><p>Put yourself in my shoes.</p><p>How would you feel if you discovered your child had been forcibly subdued?</p><p>Qin Sang never intended to feud with the Thunder Hawk...</p><p>After returning, Qin Sang would prepare for his Nascent Soul stage breakthrough, and now he must consider his situation afterward.</p><p>No matter what he does, he must consider the threat from Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Compared to Dongyang Bo, who has been running Xiao Han Domain for many years, Qin Sang only has his senior sister, Qing Jun, as an ally. But Qing Jun has already stated that she will not help him against Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The more allies he has, the more options he has.</p><p>Especially someone like the Thunder Hawk, who is unconcerned with the world and has little entanglement with various forces.  Building a good relationship through the Fat Chicken is certainly a good thing.</p><p>Although he had a conflict with the Fat Chicken, for the demon race, Qingluan lightning power can enhance aptitude, far rarer and more precious than the Wujian Blood Mulberry.</p><p>Even if the Thunder Hawk is unreasonable, Qin Sang isn't necessarily afraid of her.</p><p>"Before transformation, stay by my side and be my guardian beast. After transformation, I will no longer restrict you; you only need to do one thing for me. I haven't thought of it yet, of course it won't exceed your capabilities. If you agree to these conditions, I can consider giving you some Qingluan lightning power."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered and said.</p><p>The Fat Chicken was overjoyed upon hearing this, without any hesitation. Such favorable conditions, fearing Qin Sang would change his mind, it immediately swore, "Little one greets Master! Just now, consider it as the little one letting out a fart. My mother will thank Master for this great opportunity on my behalf!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but laugh, really not knowing how such a descendant could come from the awe-inspiring Thunder Hawk.</p><p>This kid agreed so readily, could he be confident in transforming within a hundred years?</p><p>"Are you sure your mother will thank me?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, removing his mask, smiling ambiguously, "Long time no see, you're still such a glutton, you even sold yourself. The nickname Fat Chicken isn't wrong…"</p><p>The Fat Chicken's eyes bulged, looking as if it had seen a ghost.</p><p>This face, it would absolutely never forget.</p><p>It wasn't concerned about the Wujian Blood Mulberry; its mother had left it plenty of treasures.</p><p>What it cared about was the emotional trauma!</p><p>Years ago, when it had just hatched, it was beaten up, made to cry, and given a nickname.</p><p>After the Fat Chicken broke through to the Core Formation stage, it repeatedly infiltrated human territory, just to find that guy. It had to use lightning to strike him a thousand times and give him a thousand nicknames to relieve its anger.</p><p>For years, it hadn't found the culprit, and the Fat Chicken estimated that the person was already dead, quite regretful about it.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>The Fat Chicken gritted its teeth.</p><p>"What, still not convinced?"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly, "If you still hold a grudge over a hundred-year-old grievance, I won't force you, consider your oath void. Without me, even with the stone tablet, you couldn't absorb the Qingluan lightning power.  Back then, I took the Wujian Blood Mulberry from your cave, letting you go now is even."</p><p>"You call that taking?"</p><p>The Fat Chicken wanted to cry.</p><p>It only then realized that its enemy wasn't dead, and was even stronger than itself. Now, not only could it not avenge itself, but it was also being controlled by its enemy, and forced to become a subservient offspring.</p><p>Finally, the Fat Chicken decided to swallow its anger and accept its fate.</p><p>Qin Sang circulated his cultivation technique.</p><p>The Fat Chicken was by Qin Sang's side, absorbing the Qingluan lightning power emanating from him.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped his cultivation, the Qingluan essence blood finally refined and completely integrated into his phoenix wings.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A thought crossed his mind, and the phoenix wings fluttered.</p><p>He reached out to touch them.</p><p>These were real wings, reshaped by the Qingluan essence blood.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't tell if the phoenix wings were a treasure or a divine ability.</p><p>Being human, the Qingluan essence blood in the wings couldn't be refined into his body, it shouldn't be considered part of his body, and in the future, it could only be used to perform lightning escape techniques.</p><p>However, this was enough.</p><p>After reaching the Nascent Soul stage, with lightning escape combined with sword escape, Qin Sang estimated that his escape techniques would not be weaker than a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, allowing him to face Dongyang Bo without fear.</p><p>He turned to look at the Fat Chicken, which was sleeping soundly, unaware of how much it had gained.</p><p>Standing up.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his powerful body.</p><p>His heart beat powerfully, his body full of explosive strength. If the Qieji Demon King appeared before him now, he would dare to punch him!</p><p>"You're awake?"</p><p>Bai, who had been on guard all night, walked in from outside.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern, Brother Bai."</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his fists.</p><p>Bai waved his hand, eagerly saying, "Quickly summon the Sky-Eyed Butterfly for me to see!"</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly as requested.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly was also asleep, its size having returned to its previous size.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully held the Sky Eye Butterfly.  This night, the butterfly had brought him many surprises.</p><p>“Capturing the Thunder Tribulation!  In my memory, something unheard of, truly miraculous! You must cultivate her diligently. If she truly masters the ability to absorb the tribulation, the Heavenly Tribulation will pose far less threat to you. This means you'll have more time, more opportunities, and a far greater chance of reaching the Mahayana stage than anyone else!” Bai exclaimed, his words laced with envy and resentment.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen Bai so excited; he hadn’t had time to process it all.</p><p>“Her advancement to the fourth transformation was sheer luck.  I don't know how to help her advance further; it’s too early to talk about the future.  And as for me,  ascended cultivators are practically extinct in this era, and the Mahayana stage is simply a fantasy.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained level-headed despite his joy.</p><p>Bai shook his head, silently fixated on the Sky Eye Butterfly, unable to tear his gaze away. Suddenly remembering something, he looked up.  “I sense there’s more to the stone tablet than just the Qingluan’s true blood…”</p><p>“What do you mean, Brother Bai?”</p><p>“The Qingluan’s true blood, sealed within the stone tablet for so many ages, yet its power hasn't completely dissipated. Could there be another reason?” Bai hinted.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>“Brother Bai suspects that the blood may contain remnants of the Qingluan’s consciousness?” Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>Bai nodded. “Hearing you say that the Qingluan's phantom willingly entered your body…I’m a little worried. You cultivate a demon clan technique, visualizing the Qingluan.  If its consciousness mistook you for a descendant and used your body for rebirth, it's not unheard of. Since neither you nor the Sky Eye Butterfly feels anything unusual, I’m probably overthinking it. Perhaps the Qingluan's remaining consciousness has been eroded by time, or perhaps this is its legacy to its descendants…your luck is certainly good!”</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>The Qingluan’s consciousness sealed in the stone tablet, preserved from ancient times to the present, capable of rebirth through another being – it was terrifying.</p><p>But considering that Bai himself had lived from ancient times to the present, Qin Sang thought it wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p>What he didn't tell Bai was:</p><p>He had just noticed, upon inspecting his Purple Mansion, that the Yin-Yang armor on his primordial spirit had shattered at some point, and the jade Buddha phantom appeared, shining with golden light.</p><p>The impact of the Qingluan’s true blood had caused Qin Sang excruciating pain, almost causing him to self-destruct. He had been completely focused on his cultivation techniques and hadn't noticed when the change occurred.</p><p>Fortunately, after a thorough check, he and the Sky Eye Butterfly were otherwise unharmed.</p>
