<h1>Chapter 2082: Inside and Outside the Mountain Gate</h1><p>Spring was warm and sunny.</p><p>The new Qingyang Temple mountain gate, like the early spring earth, was full of life and vitality.</p><p>Previously, this was a desolate and dangerous mountain, with strange rocks, chaotic rivers, and dense weeds and trees.  Although the spiritual energy was rich, it was filled with an uncultivated, wild atmosphere.</p><p>Now, after careful renovation by the Qingyang Temple, the spiritual energy is even richer than before.  Green mountains stand like ink paintings, the river water is as blue as jade.  There are stunning peaks and vast lakes, a place of spiritual beauty and outstanding people.  Palaces and pavilions are nestled among the mists, creating a dreamy landscape.  Immortal trees and spiritual flowers are planted in the mountains and by the water, and spiritual beasts leap and fly, giving the place the air of a fairyland.</p><p>The sky was clear and vast, with white clouds drifting lazily.</p><p>A white cloud rose from the eastern lake, slowly drifting westward, passing through the clouds.</p><p>A Qingyang Temple attendant stood on the cloud, with a dozen teenagers following behind him.  All were captivated by the magnificent landscape below, their faces filled with wonder and pride, pointing at the ground and exclaiming in surprise.</p><p>These were all junior disciples of the Qingyang Temple, some from the ancestral court in Xiaohan, some from Qingyang Island, and others who had been practicing in Luye or other temples since childhood.  Regardless of their origins, none could compare to the grandeur of the mountain gate under construction.</p><p>They had been brought here in recent years and had been placed together.  Because of the heavy work of constructing the mountain gate and their own cultivation, their instructors frequently checked on their studies, leaving them little free time. This was their first time viewing the mountain gate in its entirety with an attendant.</p><p>Everyone couldn't help but imagine the future, the completed mountain gate, practicing here, and having their own cave dwelling.  What a wonderful life!</p><p>At that moment, they saw a green light flying towards them, caught by the attendant.</p><p>The attendant smiled and turned around, saying, "Brother Bai has arrived.  Among the spiritual beasts he brought, several have top-tier bloodline qualities. You must seize this opportunity."</p><p>Everyone responded in unison, their faces filled with anticipation.</p><p>When the mountain gate opens, the Qingyang Temple will record the disciples' contributions and reward them accordingly to encourage their enthusiasm.</p><p>These disciples had been given the chance to choose spiritual beasts first.</p><p>After Yu Wang moved to the Demon Realm, he took his subordinates and clansmen with him, gradually relinquishing control of Tianyao Hill.  Qianshan Bamboo Sea became the de facto leader of the northern region's demon tribes.  Even after Wupu Peak eliminated most of Qianshan Bamboo Sea's experts, Yu Wang showed no interest in intervening.</p><p>The relationship between Qianshan Bamboo Sea and Qingyang Temple remained close.  Li Yu Fu and Yu Nu, to deepen the bond between the two groups, encouraged Qingyang Temple disciples and the beasts of Qianshan Bamboo Sea to support each other.</p><p>Of course, this selection was mutual.  Cultivators could choose spiritual beasts, and spiritual beasts could choose cultivators.</p><p>Unlike the Yuling Sect, the Qingyang Temple's legacy didn't rely on spiritual beasts to assist in cultivation, so they didn't force the formation of spirit contracts; it was entirely voluntary.</p><p>If a cultivator could have a powerful spiritual beast as a companion, it would be of great benefit to their cultivation, and vice versa.</p><p>However, exceptionally talented spiritual beasts were rare. Whether one could gain the recognition of such a beast depended entirely on chance.  Having the opportunity to choose first was a significant advantage.</p><p>Within the sect, they couldn’t use force to subdue spiritual beasts like they could outside. Everyone began to think hard about how to impress the beasts.</p><p>The new mountain gate was far larger than Luye.  As they pondered, they realized they hadn't yet reached their destination, having already passed countless mountain ranges and lakes.</p><p>Finally, the white cloud stopped in mid-air, then suddenly descended rapidly, and everyone felt a sudden weight as they landed on a broad mountaintop.</p><p>The mountaintop was a scene of bustling activity. Eagles, hawks, foxes, leopards, and various plant spirits, totaling dozens of spiritual beasts, stood in orderly formation behind an elderly man.</p><p>The elder was tall and thin, with skin as rough as tree bark and a stern expression, like an old scholar.</p><p>"Brother Bai!" the attendant greeted him with a bow.</p><p>The elder returned the bow meticulously, "Greetings, Daoist Tan Yi."</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Tan Yi looked at the beasts behind the elder. "Brother Bai, is this all you've brought?"</p><p>"These are the most talented, the others are on Yuanling Peak."</p><p>The demon cultivator surnamed Bai replied.</p><p>They also had their own interests:  they wanted the most talented young beasts to pair with the most promising disciples of Qingyang Temple, achieving a strong union.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was secretly excited, looking at the group of beasts behind the elder.  The beasts also looked at them with their bright eyes.</p><p>The spiritual beasts from Qianshan Bamboo Sea were unlike those from outside; their auras were peaceful, their eyes shone with intelligence. Some were small and cute, some were adorable, and some were awe-inspiring and majestic.</p><p>Qin, captivated by a small, seemingly immature fox with snow-white fur and a black ruff around its neck and chest, found himself completely drawn to it.  The little fox, noticing his gaze, glared back fiercely. Qin, though captivated, tried to subtly glance away.</p><p>Seeing this, the fox's eyes twinkled mischievously.  It stepped out from its pack, glancing back at Qin with alluring eyes, before leaping down the mountain.  Qin felt a thrill; it seemed like an invitation.  For some reason, none of the other creatures held the same allure, and he didn't care about the fox's abilities.</p><p>He excused himself from a conversation with an elder, and, following his heart, swiftly moved down the mountain towards the fox. After chasing for a while, Qin realized the fox was deliberately waiting for him.</p><p>The fox leaped into a tree, glancing back as if urging him on, before disappearing into the woods.  Finding the fox waiting, Qin pursued, using his best speed. However, the fox was faster.  He would have lost sight of it if the fox hadn't waited for him each time.</p><p>"Where are you taking me?" Qin called out.</p><p>The fox didn't answer, only glancing back.  Qin’s energy was draining, yet he was completely oblivious, his eyes fixed on the fox.</p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p>A cry echoed through the woods. Qin tripped over a vine, his spiritual energy disrupted, sending him tumbling headfirst into a mud pit.  Emerging covered in mud, he heard the fox’s joyous laughter from a nearby branch.  It covered its mouth with its paws, seemingly commenting on his messy state.</p><p>"I... I'm sorry..." Qin stammered, regretting his lack of training in evasion techniques. He hadn't noticed how strangely placed the vine was.  He quickly cleansed himself with a water spell, relieved that the fox didn't seem to mind, and followed its guiding gaze.</p><p>Their journey continued through the forest.  Mishaps occurred repeatedly, always with Qin stumbling and the fox’s joyful calls echoing. Qin, though initially frustrated, refused to believe the fox was playing tricks, instead believing the area was unexplored and hazardous.</p><p>After crossing several mountains, Qin followed the fox to a cliff face overlooking a large river.  The air was scorching; the cliff was riddled with vents spewing flames and thick smoke, heating even the nearby water.</p><p>The fox pointed towards the smoke and chirped. Qin looked up and saw a small tree halfway up the cliff, bearing two bright red fruits. The fox chirped again, looking at Qin expectantly.</p><p>"You want me to get those spirit fruits?" Qin asked.</p><p>The fox nodded repeatedly.</p><p>"It really was looking for my help," Qin thought, energized. He surveyed the cliff. "This isn't ordinary earth fire; the smoke is somehow altered, making it more dangerous. I'll have to climb close to the rock face..."</p><p>He prepared himself, consuming pills, donning his most protective garment, and using a water spell to coat himself in ice before beginning his ascent.  The climb was difficult, the flames capable of burning through his protective gear.</p><p>When Qin _something_  was almost at the base of the spirit tree, he was already covered in soot, his robes torn, and his body blistered. He was in terrible condition, and could only desperately chant incantations.</p><p>After much hardship, he finally reached the base of the spirit tree.  He grabbed onto the stone platform with his right hand, feeling a soft touch on his fingertips. His heart tightened.  Looking up, he was astonished.</p><p>A little fox had somehow arrived beneath the tree. Its paws rested on his hand, completely unharmed. It tilted its head, studying him with a critical gaze.</p><p>"You..." Qin _something_ stammered.</p><p>The little fox wrinkled its delicate nose. "You're so clumsy, how will you ever protect me?"</p><p>"You can talk?"</p><p>Qin _something_'s shock caused his spiritual energy to fluctuate, destabilizing his incantation.  He was immediately engulfed in flames, yelping as he tumbled down.</p><p>The little fox sighed wearily, covering its eyes with its paws.</p><p>There was no shortage of demon kings in Qianshan Bamboo Sea.  The Emperor's Flowing Liquid was plentiful; a single drop was enough to awaken a young demon's intelligence.</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>Qin _something_ landed in the river, drifting in the water before struggling to shore. The burning sensation eased somewhat.</p><p>The little fox hopped down, about to speak, but suddenly froze. With a whoosh, it darted to Qin _something_'s side, curling into a ball and covering its head with its tail.</p><p>Qin _something_ looked around and then saw two figures in the air.  Upon recognizing one of them, he was terrified.</p><p>"Ancestor..."</p><p>Qin _something_ dropped to his knees. "Ancestor Qin Niansui!"</p><p>Qin Niansui had just arrived from the North Sea and happened to be passing by. He ignored the young Qin family member, glancing only at the little fox before continuing towards the main peak.</p><p>The little fox trembled. After a while, it cautiously lifted its tail. Seeing that the figure in the air was gone, it breathed a sigh of relief.  Seeing Qin _something_ still there, it patted his arm. "Hey! What's your name?"</p><p>"My name is Qin _something_," Qin _something_ replied.</p><p>"Qin?"</p><p>The little fox's eyes twinkled.  It hopped onto his shoulder and gave him a fruit. "It's you!"</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Niansui didn't concern himself with the youngsters' games. His brow furrowed in worry for the future of his sect.</p><p>Currently, only a few transcendent cultivators in the Qingyang Temple knew of Qin Sang's return.</p><p>Qin Niansui didn't understand why Master Li Yu Fu made such a decision. The Qingyang Temple had long wanted to rebuild its mountain gate, but they knew the world was watching them, and they had repeatedly delayed the process.</p><p>The Qingyang Temple led various clans and sects against the Changyou tribe, holding the moral high ground and leading the charge.  Initially, there was skepticism, but after the Qianshan Bamboo Sea's experts were defeated at the Mist Waterfall, and the Qingyang Temple suffered heavy losses, they showed their unwavering determination, silencing their critics.</p><p>This situation was hard-won. The Qingyang Temple had gone to great lengths to unite everyone. Each clan and sect had its own agenda, but with the Qingyang Temple leading the way, they had to consider the greater good, otherwise they risked incurring the wrath of the world.</p><p>Now, with external enemies still at large, the Qingyang Temple's decision to withdraw personnel in order to rebuild their mountain gate was seen by others as selfish.</p><p>How would they control the ambitions of others if the Qingyang Temple acted in such a manner?</p><p>Were the rumors true—that after her last battle with the Changyou tribe's leader, the Glass Fairy was gravely injured, forcing the Qingyang Temple to prepare a retreat?</p><p>Even the North Sea was abuzz with speculation, not to mention the Central Plains.</p><p>It was rumored that during the recent meeting of the three tribes, the Demon Sea demon tribe was the first to act, demanding help in reclaiming their ancestral lands. While the Four Sacred Palaces and the Witch tribe didn't explicitly support them, the scene was very ugly.</p><p>"My husband, don't worry.  Master Li must have thought this through carefully.  We will understand in time."</p><p>Qin Niansui's wife, Bai Hanqiu's eldest daughter, comforted him gently. Bai Hanqiu had mentioned this to Qin Sang years ago, leaving them each a jade pendant, which they still carried.</p><p>"Though Master Li has his reasons, for the sake of the sect, regardless of what others think, husband, I see a danger that must be addressed!"</p><p>Qin Niansui shook his head slightly, his gaze sweeping across the ground.</p><p>He had to admit, the new mountain gate was truly magnificent, surpassing other temples. Even he was moved by it; no wonder the disciples were so spirited. Unfortunately, they only saw the present joy, not the future dangers.</p><p>They quickened their pace, soon arriving at the main peak, where attendants greeted them upon landing.</p><p>Upon learning their purpose, the attendant went into the hall to report.</p><p>...</p><p>Meanwhile, Li Yu Fu was behind the main peak, standing respectfully before Qin Sang's cave.</p><p>After a while, he saw the stone door glow and slowly open.  Moments later, Qin Sang emerged.</p><p>"Greetings, Master."</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed and flew with Qin Sang to the mountaintop.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, unleashing his spiritual sense to silently scan the land, perceiving the changes within the Qingyang Temple.</p><p>After his retreat, his cultivation had stabilized, and the Qingyang Temple had undergone significant improvements, essentially meeting the conditions he set before his retreat.</p><p>Next, preparations for the Thunder Altar would begin. Qin Sang planned to first establish the main altar, then the branch altars, building the mountain gate and altars simultaneously.</p><p>Due to the rigorous requirements of the Thunder Altar, the Qingyang Temple alone couldn't accomplish it; some tasks required his personal involvement.
