<h1>Chapter 142: Plunder</h1><p>Heavenly thunder descended.</p><p>Lightning flashed, blindingly bright.</p><p>The divine thunder targeted Venerable Ye.</p><p>Venerable Ye was caught completely off guard. After unleashing a blade strike that had stunned everyone present, he hadn't anticipated a sneak attack.</p><p>There couldn't be a second Nascent Soul Grandmaster here.  Someone had the audacity to snatch food from a tiger's mouth.</p><p>Qin Sang chose his moment perfectly. He struck when Venerable Ye had exhausted his power delivering the blade strike and resisting the pressure of the Secret Realm, a moment of vulnerability.</p><p>This thunder technique was undoubtedly a top-tier Daoist art, a core inheritance in any sect. It couldn't be unknown in the cultivation world, yet despite Venerable Ye's vast knowledge, he had never encountered it before.</p><p>The power of the Thunder Control Technique surpassed the limits of Core Formation cultivators. Venerable Ye dared not underestimate it; he sensed a threat to his life!</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The cavern trembled.</p><p>The earth spirits surrounding Venerable Ye were shattered, his figure swallowed by thunder, leaving only dazzling electric light.</p><p>Witnessing this, the cultivators were dumbfounded, gripped by disbelief. They wondered if they had stumbled into the wrong place, this couldn't be the Trial Realm.</p><p>Why were they encountering such overwhelmingly powerful opponents one after another?</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>While Venerable Ye was reeling from the surprise attack of the Thunder Control Technique, the other cultivators were bewildered by the successive appearances of mysterious adversaries and the unpredictable situation, unsure of what to do.</p><p>A grey shadow abruptly darted out from the earth spirit army and, in full view of everyone, rushed towards the seal.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A ghostly hand reached out, grabbing at the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>This person had clearly planned this for a long time. Their movements were smooth and fluid, instantly seizing all four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid before retreating rapidly.</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>Venerable Ye's furious roar echoed from within the lightning.</p><p>The one who snatched the Soul Cleansing Liquid was Bai.</p><p>He and Qin Sang had split up, hiding in the shadows, waiting for the opportune moment.  They coordinated closely; Qin Sang launched the sneak attack while Bai seized the Soul Cleansing Liquid when Venerable Ye was preoccupied.</p><p>Blood Bat and the others were severely injured and unable to compete.</p><p>The remaining cultivators were leaderless and intimidated by Venerable Ye, hesitant to intervene.  No one dared to disrupt the situation.</p><p>Having secured the Soul Cleansing Liquid, Bai immediately turned and dashed towards Qin Sang's location. Hearing Venerable Ye's powerful bellow, Bai's heart tightened.</p><p>Qin Sang's caution was justified. These old monsters were formidable. Even with their cultivation restricted, the Thunder Control Technique alone wasn't enough to kill Venerable Ye.</p><p>Venerable Ye's roar, louder than the thunderclap, was deafening.</p><p>Elder Longbeard and the others knew the command was directed at them.</p><p>When Venerable Ye had effortlessly disabled Blood Bat's group and broken the seal to retrieve the Soul Cleansing Liquid, they were overjoyed, their minds filled with fantasies.</p><p>But with the appearance of the Thunder Control Technique and Venerable Ye seemingly helpless against it, swallowed by lightning, they plummeted from elation to despair.</p><p>Standing behind Venerable Ye, they could clearly sense the terrifying power of the Thunder Control Technique.</p><p>With Venerable Ye's cultivation restricted and his injuries, after unleashing that powerful blade strike, how could he withstand it?</p><p>What if Venerable Ye…</p><p>They were terrified, lost, and dared not continue that thought.</p><p>Finally hearing Venerable Ye's voice, Elder Longbeard and the others breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>"Master is unharmed!"</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>Their relief quickly turned to rage.</p><p>This person not only attacked their master but also stole their Soul Cleansing Liquid!</p><p>The four had prepared their flag formation, ready to assist Venerable Ye's retreat from the cavern. It would serve perfectly to deal with Bai.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Banners fluttered.</p><p>Boundless rosy clouds and auspicious mists billowed from the spirit banners.</p><p>This flag formation was mysterious, its aura impressive and its power undeniable.</p><p>"Drop the Soul Cleansing Liquid!"</p><p>Elder Longbeard's fury was palpable, his long beard bristling.  Suddenly, he sensed the formation falter.</p><p>He glanced over to see Su Nü clutching a spirit banner, staring at Venerable Ye with fear and sorrow, frozen in place.</p><p>"Junior Sister!"</p><p>Elder Longbeard roared.</p><p>Su Nü jolted, meeting Elder Longbeard's gaze with a dazed expression, as if just regaining her senses.  Her face flushed, she fumbled with the spirit banner.</p><p>Panic only exacerbated her mistakes.</p><p>Elder Longbeard sighed. Su Nü was clearly shaken by the previous scene, believing Venerable Ye to be in mortal danger.</p><p>He and his two siblings had traveled extensively, gaining rich experience. In this situation, they would react swiftly and decisively.</p><p>However, Su Nü had always cultivated within the Eastern Extremity Alliance, sheltered by the Alliance Leader and Venerable Ye.  She had never faced any real danger, and no one dared provoke her.</p><p>The consequence was that despite her cultivation, her combat experience was perhaps less than that of a newly formed Core Formation cultivator. In crucial moments, she didn't know what to do.</p><p>Hampered by Su Nü and forced to activate the formation, it was riddled with flaws.</p><p>Decisive as they were, Elder Longbeard and the other two knew Su Nü was unreliable.  They immediately abandoned the spirit banners, activating their magical treasures and encircling Bai.</p><p>Bai sneered, flinging his arm. Corpse Qi enveloped one of the bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid and hurled it away.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>All eyes followed its trajectory.</p><p>The cultivators in that direction stirred.</p><p>Hoping to benefit from the conflict, a daring individual prepared to intervene.</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid shimmered, about to escape right under their noses.</p><p>Although aware of the ploy, Elder Longbeard and the others were momentarily distracted.  The Enchanting Woman couldn't resist, flicking her sleeve and sending a ribbon of energy towards the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Bai's speed didn't falter. Corpse Qi surged around him, forcing his way through.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>A crane's cry pierced the air from behind, a gust of wind袭至. The Strong Man felt a chill down his spine and, abandoning all else, spun around, slashing with his blade.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Bai and Elder Longbeard clashed.</p><p>The White Crane, cunningly, had already taken flight, avoiding a direct confrontation with the Strong Man.  It knew it was no match and only needed to divert his attention.</p><p>In this fleeting opening, another figure emerged: Qin Sang.</p><p>Having expended most of his cultivation using the Thunder Control Technique, he entrusted the task of seizing the treasure to Bai.  After consuming a spirit pill, Qin Sang rushed to provide support.</p><p>The White Crane and Bai converged, their forms blurring before one vanished into the Corpse Puppet Sack and the other transformed into the Mixed-Elemental Concentric Rings, encircling Qin Sang's wrist.</p><p>Before the elders could close in,</p><p>Three-colored escape lights erupted from Qin Sang's body.</p><p>蛟dragon's shadow, phoenix wings, and sword light intertwined in a dazzling display.</p><p>"No! Stop him!"</p><p>Elder Longbeard, gripped by a premonition, paled.</p><p>The Strong Man acted even faster, unleashing a blinding blade strike that echoed Venerable Ye's technique, clearly a direct inheritance.</p><p>But they were too slow.</p><p>Qin Sang's escape technique left them in despair. He instantly broke through their encirclement, leaving them far behind.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>Venerable Ye's thunderous roar struck Qin Sang, sending a surge of blood through his body.  He was secretly alarmed.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw the heavenly thunder that had struck Venerable Ye begin to crack.</p><p>Heavenly thunder descended.</p><p>Lightning flashed, blindingly bright.</p><p>The divine thunder targeted Venerable Ye.</p><p>Venerable Ye was caught off guard.  After unleashing a blade strike that awed everyone present, he hadn't expected a sneak attack.</p><p>There couldn't be a second Nascent Soul Grandmaster here.  Someone was incredibly audacious, daring to snatch food from a tiger's mouth.</p><p>Qin Sang chose his moment perfectly.  It was precisely when Venerable Ye had exerted all his power for the blade attack, resisting the suppression of the secret realm, and his strength hadn't yet recovered.  He struck at Venerable Ye's most vulnerable moment.</p><p>This type of thunder technique had to be a top-tier Daoist art, a core inheritance of any sect. It couldn't be unknown in the cultivation world. Yet, despite Venerable Ye's vast knowledge, he'd never encountered it before.</p><p>The power of the Command Thunder Technique exceeded the limits of Core Formation cultivators.  Venerable Ye didn't dare to be careless; he even sensed a threat to his life!</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The cavern trembled.</p><p>The earth spirits around Venerable Ye were shattered.  His figure was swallowed by the thunder, leaving only dazzling electric light visible.</p><p>Witnessing this, the cultivators stood frozen, a sense of unreality washing over them.  They wondered if this wasn't a trial realm at all, and if they'd stumbled into the wrong place.</p><p>Otherwise, why would they encounter such overwhelmingly powerful opponents one after another?</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Just as Venerable Ye was caught off guard by the Command Thunder Technique, and the other cultivators were bewildered by the successive appearances of mysterious adversaries and the unpredictable situation, unsure of what to do,</p><p>a gray shadow suddenly darted out from the earth spirit army.  In full view of everyone, it rushed into the seal.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A ghostly hand reached out, grabbing for the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>This person had clearly planned this for a long time. Their movements were smooth and flowing, instantly seizing all four bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid. Then, the figure shot back.</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>Venerable Ye's furious roar echoed from within the lightning.</p><p>The one who snatched the Soul Cleansing Liquid was Bai.</p><p>He and Qin Sang had split up, hiding in the shadows, waiting for the right moment. They cooperated closely, with Qin Sang launching a surprise attack on Venerable Ye, while Bai took advantage of Venerable Ye's distraction to seize the liquid.</p><p>Blood Bat and the others were severely injured and no longer had the strength to compete.</p><p>The other cultivators were leaderless and had been intimidated by Venerable Ye.  They didn't dare to step forward, and for a moment, no one interfered.</p><p>Having secured the Soul Cleansing Liquid, Bai immediately turned and rushed toward Qin Sang. Hearing Venerable Ye's powerful shout, Bai's heart tightened.</p><p>Qin Sang's caution was justified. These old monsters were indeed formidable. Even with their cultivation restricted, the Command Thunder Technique alone wouldn't be enough to kill Venerable Ye.</p><p>Venerable Ye's roar was deafening, overpowering even the thunderclaps.</p><p>Elder Longbeard and the others knew the command was directed at them.</p><p>When they saw Venerable Ye disable Blood Bat and the others with a single move and easily break the seal to retrieve the Soul Cleansing Liquid, their hearts had been filled with joy and anticipation.</p><p>But when the Command Thunder Technique appeared, and Venerable Ye was engulfed by lightning, seemingly unable to resist, their joy instantly turned to despair.</p><p>They were behind Venerable Ye and could clearly sense the terrifying power of the Command Thunder Technique.</p><p>With Venerable Ye's cultivation restricted and his injuries, and after expending his energy on that blade strike, how could he possibly withstand it?</p><p>What if Venerable Ye…</p><p>They were terrified and bewildered, not daring to think any further.</p><p>Finally, when they heard Venerable Ye's voice, Elder Longbeard and the others breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Master is alright!"</p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p>After their elation came a surge of anger.</p><p>That person not only attacked their Master but also stole their Soul Cleansing Liquid!</p><p>The four had already prepared their flag formation, ready to help Venerable Ye escape from the cavern. Now, it would be used against Bai.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The flags fluttered.</p><p>Boundless rays of light and auspicious clouds billowed from the spirit flags.</p><p>This flag formation was mysterious, awe-inspiring, and undeniably powerful.</p><p>"Drop the Soul Cleansing Liquid!"</p><p>Elder Longbeard's beard bristled with rage, but then he suddenly felt the formation falter.</p><p>He glanced over and saw Su Nü clutching a spirit flag, staring in fear and sorrow at Venerable Ye, frozen in place.</p><p>"Junior Sister!"</p><p>Elder Longbeard roared.</p><p>Su Nü jolted, meeting Elder Longbeard's gaze with a dazed expression, as if just coming back to her senses.  Her face flushed, and she fumbled with the spirit flag.</p><p>The more panicked she became, the more mistakes she made.</p><p>Elder Longbeard sighed inwardly. Su Nü had clearly been frightened by the previous scene, believing Venerable Ye to be in mortal danger.</p><p>He and his two siblings had traveled extensively for many years and were experienced. In such a situation, they could react swiftly.</p><p>However, Su Nü had always cultivated within the Eastern Polar Alliance, sheltered by the Alliance Leader and Venerable Ye.  She had never faced any real danger, nor had anyone dared to provoke her.</p><p>The consequence was that despite her cultivation, her combat experience might be less than that of a newly formed Core Formation cultivator. In critical moments, she didn't know what to do.</p><p>Hindered by Su Nü, forcing the activation of the flag formation only created more vulnerabilities.</p><p>Elder Longbeard and the other two were decisive individuals.  Knowing Su Nü was unreliable, they immediately abandoned the spirit flags, activating their magical treasures and surrounding Bai.</p><p>Bai sneered, flicking his wrist. Corpse Qi enveloped one of the bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid and flung it away.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>All eyes followed it.</p><p>The cultivators in that direction stirred.</p><p>In this struggle between snipe and clam, someone daring was preparing to be the fisherman.</p><p>The Soul Cleansing Liquid shimmered like fireflies, about to escape right under their noses.</p><p>Although Elder Longbeard and the others knew this was a ploy, their attention was partially diverted.  The Alluring Woman couldn't resist, flicking her sleeve and sending a ribbon of energy towards the liquid.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Bai's speed didn't falter. Corpse Qi surged around him as he forced his way through.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>A crane's cry came from behind, followed by a gust of wind.  The Strong Man felt a chill down his spine and, ignoring everything else, spun around, slashing with his blade.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Bai and Elder Longbeard clashed.</p><p>The White Crane, cunningly, flapped its wings and dodged, knowing it wasn't a match for the Strong Man. It didn't engage directly; simply drawing the Strong Man's attention was enough.</p><p>In that fleeting moment, another figure flashed out – Qin Sang.</p><p>Using the Command Thunder Technique had drained most of his cultivation.  The task of seizing the treasure had fallen to Bai.  Having consumed a spirit pill, Qin Sang now came to support him.</p><p>The White Crane and Bai both lunged forward. Then, their figures blurred, one disappearing into the Corpse Puppet Sack, the other transforming into the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings on Qin Sang's wrist.</p><p>Before the elders could encircle them,</p><p>three-colored escape lights erupted from Qin Sang.</p><p>A Flood Dragon's shadow, Phoenix wings, and sword light intertwined in a dazzling display.</p><p>"No! Stop him!"</p><p>Elder Longbeard felt a sense of foreboding, his expression drastically changing.</p><p>The Strong Man was more direct. He unleashed a blade attack, the blade light dazzling, reminiscent of Venerable Ye's technique, clearly a direct inheritance.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were too slow.</p><p>The escape technique Qin Sang displayed filled them with despair. He instantly broke through their encirclement, leaving them far behind.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>Venerable Ye roared in thunderous fury. Qin Sang felt his blood churn, secretly startled.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw the heavenly thunder that struck Venerable Ye… cracking.</p>
