<h1></h1><p>"The Rat Demon isn't dead!"</p><p>Island Lord Shen exclaimed.</p><p>Venerable Feng, who was flying at the very front, frowned slightly upon hearing this.</p><p>He and Island Lord Shen had personally laid an ambush to kill the Rat Demon, and he had personally witnessed the Rat Demon's demise. How could he have failed?</p><p>Could it be that what they had killed before wasn't the Rat Demon's true body, but only an incarnation?</p><p>The situation didn't allow Venerable Feng to dwell on it.</p><p>The mark had lost its connection, but the direction was clear.</p><p>His figure was like smoke as he continued his escape technique without pause. After flying for a distance, he suddenly saw a dark silhouette on the sea ahead, clearly an island.</p><p>The island was completely dark and uninhabited—a deserted island.</p><p>Venerable Feng was inwardly delighted.</p><p>The appearance of a deserted island here was no coincidence. The Xuan Tian Palace traitor was likely hiding here!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Venerable Feng flew to the edge of the deserted island and unceremoniously released his divine sense, searching the island thoroughly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he didn't find anything unusual.</p><p>…</p><p>In the secret cave.</p><p>As the Nascent Soul cultivators and Demon Kings converged and appeared near the deserted island,</p><p>the white-clothed man who was frozen in ice sensed something amiss, and his eyelids twitched slightly.</p><p>"They've arrived so quickly…"</p><p>A soft sigh echoed from the quiet secret cave.</p><p>However, there was no panic in the white-clothed man's expression.</p><p>A cold aura condensed above the mystic ice, forming a circular ice mirror, which reflected the scene near the deserted island.</p><p>In an instant, the white-clothed man's composure vanished without a trace, his face ashen!</p><p>"How can there be so many people!"</p><p>If he weren't frozen, the white-clothed man would probably have jumped up.</p><p>He had made preparations, and this time he had a 60-70% chance of escaping and shaking off the Rainbow Rat's pursuit.</p><p>The white-clothed man had never imagined that so many changes would occur outside while he was frozen, and now there were as many as six Demon Kings who had been attracted, along with Nascent Soul human cultivators joining in the fun.</p><p>Even in his prime, he wouldn't be able to escape if targeted by so many people.</p><p>Despair!</p><p>Filled his heart.</p><p>The white-clothed man's face was bitter.</p><p>If he had another chance, he would never have chosen to betray Xuan Tian Palace, but now it was too late for regrets.</p><p>Suddenly, the ice mirror reflected the Rainbow Rat on the Eagle Demon's back.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat had revived using a clone, and its secret technique wasn't complete. It was already weakened, its strength greatly diminished, and it had just exhausted itself further to sense the mark.</p><p>Staring intently at the Rainbow Rat,</p><p>a cold glint flashed in the white-clothed man's eyes, and a resolute look appeared on his face as his arms trembled slightly.</p><p>*Crack… Crack…*</p><p>The mystic ice emitted a series of cracking sounds.</p><p>Cracks gradually covered the entire piece of mystic ice.</p><p>…</p><p>The battlefield between Qin Sang and Bi Fang.</p><p>Demonic fire and blood flames clashed, the raging flames incinerating the sky.</p><p>The battle had reached a fever pitch.</p><p>Bi Fang's demonic eyes were filled with savage light, as if they could pierce through the raging flames and stab into Qin Sang.</p><p>The power of the Demonic Fire was unprecedented in its life.</p><p>It didn't know when such an expert had emerged among the human race.</p><p>Under the impact of the Demonic Fire, the blood flames were forced to retreat. If this continued, they would soon show signs of defeat and be completely suppressed by the Demonic Fire.</p><p>However, Bi Fang hadn't displayed its full strength.</p><p>This was because it was saving its trump card to guard against Qin Sang's Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>But unexpectedly, after fighting for so long, Qin Sang hadn't shown any intention of releasing the puppet. On the bright side, the puppet might have suffered too much damage previously and was difficult to repair, so he couldn't use it to fight.</p><p>Bi Fang's eyes darted around, and it already had a plan in mind.</p><p>The others had already flown far away, and it couldn't delay any longer.</p><p>The blood flames danced wildly, rapidly converging towards the center, then began to counterattack the Demonic Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang was behind the Demonic Fire, manipulating the Demonic Banner, his expression calm. Seeing this, he was slightly moved. It seemed that he could force out another of Bi Fang's abilities.</p><p>Just as this thought flashed through his mind,</p><p>suddenly, accompanied by a booming sound, a pillar of fire formed from blood flames shot towards the sky.</p><p>The pillar of fire was extremely thick, and it transformed into a cloud of fire in mid-air.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to act, he saw that the fire cloud changed form, actually transforming into a true Bi Fang divine bird, standing on one leg, its divine might unmatched, looking down upon all directions!</p><p>He hurriedly looked towards the center of the sea of fire.</p><p>Bi Fang's true body had disappeared, merging with the blood flames to become this Blood Flame Bi Fang!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Blood Flame Bi Fang turned its neck, and its eyes, formed of blood flames, stared intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his whole body tighten, as if he were being targeted by an unparalleled fierce beast, and he felt somewhat parched. He couldn't help but become more vigilant, carefully guarding himself.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, a cold snort exploded in Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>The Blood Flame Bi Fang retracted its gaze and looked towards the direction Venerable Feng and the others had escaped. It folded its wings together and suddenly shot out a stream of fire, its main body following closely behind.</p><p>Demonic fire surged, spanning the sky and preventing Bi Fang from escaping.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bi Fang's strength had increased dramatically, and it forcibly broke through the Demonic Fire's blockade, piercing through the air and leaving.</p><p>Scarlet flames rained down, scattering along the way, creating a poignant scene.</p><p>The Demonic Fire didn't pursue Bi Fang, but gathered towards the center, transforming into a flame dragon and flying back in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the air, watching the direction the Blood Flame Bi Fang had flown, hesitating slightly. He collected the Demonic Fire and chased after it.</p><p>He didn't want to force Bi Fang into a desperate fight, so he hadn't spared no effort in dealing with Bi Fang. Seeing that the time was right, he stopped being so aggressive and let Bi Fang leave.</p><p>Having held back Bi Fang for so long, Venerable Feng couldn't say that he was at fault.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang was very curious about what treasure lay ahead that had such a great attraction for the experts of both races.</p><p>From Venerable Feng's actions, Qin Sang could tell that they definitely knew something.</p><p>He just wasn't sure if Venerable Feng had only just seen through the demon race's intentions, or if he had known all along but deliberately concealed it from him, fearing that he would develop evil intentions.</p><p>The content of the agreement was to ask Qin Sang to entangle Bi Fang in the event of a great battle.</p><p>Venerable Feng's concealment of key information didn't count as breaking his word.</p><p>Since that was the case, he couldn't blame Qin Sang for wanting to take a share.</p><p>And Qin Sang happened to have the strength to do so!</p><p>Qin Sang knew clearly that once he showed any intention of competing for the treasure, not only the Demon Kings, but also Venerable Feng and the others would immediately turn against him.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang planned to remain silent and observe for a while.</p><p>He still had plans for Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, he didn't want to become enemies with Venerable Feng.</p><p>Unless it was a treasure that would benefit his cultivation, Qin Sang wouldn't rashly make a move, and he could take this opportunity to make another deal with Venerable Feng.</p><p>Thinking about these things, Qin Sang's speed didn't slow down at all.</p><p>He sensed the current location of the Nascent Soul talisman puppet. During his battle with Bi Fang, the Nascent Soul talisman puppet had gradually caught up and was following behind.</p><p>Originally, leaving the puppet outside was to guard against Venerable Feng and the others, in case he inadvertently fell into a trap, so it could provide assistance from the outside.</p><p>Now it seemed that this backup plan wouldn't be needed.</p><p>However, there was no time to retrieve it for now.</p><p>Leaving it outside wasn't a problem. In case of any changes, the Nascent Soul talisman puppet could still respond from the outside.</p><p>The path ahead was unknown.</p><p>The situation would inevitably be very chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bi Fang's escape techniques were among the best of the experts. Although the fight had delayed them for a while, it wasn't long before they saw the escaping lights of the others.</p><p>Qin Sang still didn't stop, occasionally attacking to harass Bi Fang.</p><p>In reality, most of his attention was on the others in front.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang also saw the outline of the deserted island, and discovered that everyone was scrambling to rush towards it.</p><p>They had arrived!</p>
