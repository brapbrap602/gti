<h1>Chapter 2034: Betrayal</h1><p>Chapter 583: Betrayal</p><p>The Shadow Leopard attacked again.</p><p>This time, under the illumination of the Blood Ban, Qin Sang vaguely saw a phantom shadow, rushing towards Yun Youzi with astonishing speed.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard’s stealth ability was rendered useless here.</p><p>Not only that, its speed was slower than before, as if it were carrying a mountain on its back.</p><p>“Attack its abdomen, it's seriously injured!”</p><p>Yun Youzi urged the flawless pearl with all his might, shouting loudly.</p><p>Qin Sang understood immediately. The Shadow Leopard must have been injured when it shattered the Xia Bei Chen Star Array in the Abyss of Sin; this injury was difficult to heal, and its abdomen was its weakness.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed behind Yun Youzi, unleashing all of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, and ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to attack.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire transformed into a fire dragon, shooting out to block the Shadow Leopard's path.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, the Shadow Leopard's eyes narrowed slightly. It felt that this strange flame was extraordinary and seemed to threaten it.</p><p>What bad luck!</p><p>Two cultivators, whose cultivation hadn't even reached the Golden Core stage, not only possessed magical treasures that threatened it, but also manipulated the Blood Ban.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard regretted it.  If it had known, it should have secretly eliminated these two people while hiding in the dark.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The Shadow Leopard regretted its actions, but its movements were unaffected.</p><p>With a roar, countless claw shadows appeared, with an awe-inspiring momentum to tear everything apart. Unexpectedly, after the claw shadows and the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire collided, the expected one-sided situation did not occur.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire was torn apart by the Shadow Leopard, but after dispersing, it quickly recombined, and was not defeated.</p><p>At the same time, the Flying Night Rakshasa emerged from the flames without warning, choosing a very tricky angle, and suddenly punched the Shadow Leopard's abdomen.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard roared repeatedly, twisting its body sharply, not daring to receive the Flying Night Rakshasa's punch head-on.</p><p>There really was an injury there!</p><p>After dodging the sneak attack, the Shadow Leopard finally repelled the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa flew back, with several claw marks on its body that looked serious, but its core wasn't damaged.</p><p>The combined efforts of the two actually managed to hold back the Shadow Leopard!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was also surprised. The Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner was only a low-grade magical treasure; the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Flying Night Rakshasa were absolutely no match for the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>Only one possibility explained this situation: the Shadow Leopard was restricted by the Blood Ban, greatly reducing its power!</p><p>He glanced at Yun Youzi, but saw that Yun Youzi’s movements were getting faster and faster, it was impossible to see how many hand seals he cast, and the light on the four walls of the stone hall was getting brighter and brighter, pressing down on the Shadow Leopard layer by layer.</p><p>Remembering Yun Youzi's earlier transmission, Qin Sang hurriedly urged the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and the Flying Night Rakshasa to continue fighting, focusing on the Shadow Leopard's injured area, secretly manipulating the ebony sword, and focusing all his attention on the Shadow Leopard.</p><p>At this moment, a surprising scene unfolded.</p><p>The Shadow Leopard repeatedly tore apart the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire and repelled the Flying Night Rakshasa, but it was unable to get close to Yun Youzi.  Attempts to rush towards the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit were also repelled, and the pressure on it grew stronger.</p><p>Then, it coldly glanced at Yun Youzi, and decisively turned around and left.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately guessed its intentions.</p><p>The Blood Ban only existed within the stone hall. Once it left the range of the Blood Ban, they would lose their greatest reliance and be at its mercy.</p><p>…</p><p>The Shadow Leopard was well aware of the power of the Blood Ban. It was left by a transformed Great Demon and was extremely terrifying. If Yun Youzi unleashed the full power of the Blood Ban, he could easily kill it.</p><p>It didn't know the depth of Yun Youzi's abilities and didn't want to take any more risks. As long as it blocked the waterfall entrance, it could easily capture Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect the Shadow Leopard to be so decisive, abandoning the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit without hesitation.</p><p>It absolutely couldn't be allowed to escape!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Shadow Leopard was too fast for them to stop.</p><p>“Qin Lao Di!”</p><p>Yun Youzi suddenly shouted angrily.</p><p>Qin Sang had always kept Yun Youzi's instructions in mind. Upon hearing the shout, he almost didn't have time to think, instinctively summoning the ebony sword, instantly transforming into a sword light and shooting out.</p><p>The sound of thunder echoed in the stone hall, deafening.</p><p>The flying sword was like a dazzling rainbow, unstoppable.</p><p>Yun Youzi did not let Qin Sang down; he lightly touched the flawless pearl.</p><p>The stone hall plunged into sudden darkness.  Yun Youzi unleashed the power of the blood restriction, focusing all the light onto the Shadow Leopard, intensifying the pressure on it.</p><p>Immediately, the Immaculate Pearl vibrated, firing a strange light arrow.  Faster than Qin Sang's flying sword, it overtook the Shadow Leopard, enveloping it.</p><p>Instantly, the Shadow Leopard froze in a bizarre pose, held in place. Yun Youzi's words weren't empty boasts; the Immaculate Pearl truly restrained the demonic cultivator. Even a mid-stage Core Transformation Shadow Leopard was trapped.</p><p>A lightning-fast sword flash followed.  After the Shadow Leopard was pinned by the Immaculate Pearl, a grey orb, about the size of a dragon's eye, shot from the sword light.</p><p>The orb was greyish-white, occasionally flashing silver. It floated towards the Shadow Leopard, seeming slow but moving swiftly.  It spun gently, creating an illusion of slowness, but the silver light intensified.</p><p>The small orb revealed immense, increasingly violent power, causing tremors throughout the body.</p><p>Yun Youzi narrowed his eyes from afar.  The Ebony Sword halted abruptly then retreated violently.  Qin Sang, the wielder, also feared the Void Sky Thunder, wary of being affected.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Shadow Leopard finally broke free from the Immaculate Pearl's hold, but faced the terrifying Void Sky Thunder, letting out an enraged roar.</p><p>Silver light exploded, dazzlingly bright.  The stone hall seemed to contain a miniature sun.  However, the silver light's range was small, only covering a few feet.</p><p>From explosion to dissipation, it was instantaneous, silent, and then vanished. Only a semi-circular pit in the ground and pulverized stones remained, as if nothing had happened. The Shadow Leopard disappeared, seemingly consumed by the silver light.</p><p>Then, a sudden change. The void twisted, revealing the black leopard's form.  It was horrific; its entire left foreleg, from the neck down, was gone, its bloody innards exposed, its breath weak.  Yet it lived, leaping away, leaving a trail of blood!</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, prepared. He hadn't undone the Corpse Pill's seal; firstly, Yun Youzi's plan didn't require his intervention, and secondly, he waited for this opportunity, to strike unexpectedly.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind, enveloping the Corpse Pill. Just as he was about to undo the seal, an urgent warning flashed through him.  He caught a glimpse of a dark figure lunging.</p><p>It was the Flying Night Yaksha!</p><p></p><p>39314241...</p>
