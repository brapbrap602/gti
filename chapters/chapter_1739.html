<h1>Chapter 1730: Return to the Ruins</h1><p>Qin Sang, oblivious to the changes behind him, dragged the Thunder Turtle far from the battlefield before choosing a spot to stop. He split off an avatar to guard the Thunder Turtle while his true body settled on the turtle's back to meditate and recover.</p><p>Once his True Essence was replenished, Qin Sang rose and looked down at the Thunder Turtle with a contemplative expression.  The Thunder Turtle remained unconscious, frozen into a massive chunk of ice adrift on the sea.</p><p>From their clash, Qin Sang had ascertained that normal communication with the Thunder Turtle was impossible. His only option was forced soul searching, gleaning insights from the creature's fragmented memories.</p><p>However, soul searching a Thunder Turtle was no easy task. He had to be wary of the encroaching madness. Back then, two Nascent Soul cultivators, after capturing the Manta Ray, spent considerable time devising strategies, preparing various secret arts, and setting up spirit arrays before daring to attempt it.</p><p>Qin Sang was unafraid of the madness' taint, but his cultivation was inferior to the Thunder Turtle's. Attempting soul searching alone carried a high risk of failure.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang's fingers flickered, manipulating the Demonic Fire Black Ropes. Black thorns sprouted from the ropes, piercing deep into the Thunder Turtle's flesh.</p><p>Even unconscious, the Thunder Turtle shuddered, hinting at the unimaginable agony it was enduring. Yet, under Qin Sang's precise control, it remained unconscious, gradually weakening and its aura fading with time.</p><p>Finally, the Thunder Turtle was roused, letting out a series of piercing howls that made one's hair stand on end. By now, it was completely powerless, at Qin Sang's mercy.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, sword threads danced around him, the Seven Souls Killing Formation reappearing.  This time, it wasn't meant to kill the Thunder Turtle, but to exploit the formation's soul-shaking killing intent, amplifying the Demonic Fire's assault on the turtle's consciousness.</p><p>Judging the moment opportune, Qin Sang's expression turned serious. Placing a hand on the Thunder Turtle's crown, he closed his eyes and began the soul search! His avatar, armed with a spirit treasure, stood guard on the periphery.</p><p>‘Crash… Crash… Crash…’</p><p>Waves churned violently.  The Thunder Turtle's massive body thrashed desperately, yet it couldn't escape Qin Sang's grasp. Its cries, initially sharp, gradually weakened until its body convulsed in spasms, its life force extinguished.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly, retracting his hand.  He looked down at the lifeless Thunder Turtle, his eyes flickering. The information gleaned from the soul search flowed through his mind.</p><p>Most of it was meaningless noise, the madness having thoroughly corrupted the Thunder Turtle's consciousness, rendering its memories chaotic.</p><p>The only clear fragment, likely seared into the Thunder Turtle's memory due to its recent occurrence and sheer impact, depicted a gaping maw filled with fangs. The creature's head resembled a fusion of a wolf and a crocodile demon, its elongated body akin to a Flood Dragon.</p><p>It was another monstrous beast, the culprit behind the Thunder Turtle's injuries. With a single bite, it had shattered the Thunder Turtle's lightning-infused shell, devouring a large chunk of flesh, leaving behind an unforgettable agony.</p><p>It was unclear how the Thunder Turtle had escaped.  Through the memory fragment, Qin Sang could viscerally experience the monstrous beast's terrifying power, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>If such beasts lurked within the depths of the Return to the Ruins, it was no wonder the path of ascension was fraught with peril.</p><p>The scene had unfolded underwater.  Unfamiliar with the environment within the Return to the Ruins, Qin Sang couldn't determine whether the two beasts had clashed within its depths or encountered each other while roaming outside their lairs.</p><p>Aside from learning about a more ferocious beast, Qin Sang had gained little useful information.</p><p>He sighed inwardly.  With a flick of his finger, the Demonic Fire detached from the Thunder Turtle's corpse, transforming into a fiery blade in the air. The ice encasing the turtle began to melt.</p><p>‘Sizzle!’</p><p>The fire blade sliced through flesh, skinning and deboning the carcass.  This was Qin Sang's first encounter with a Thunder Turtle. He could only rely on his past refining experience to assess the value of each part as he dissected the corpse.</p><p>With the Demonic Fire's aid, the dissection proceeded swiftly.  Left with the skeleton, Qin Sang beckoned, and a streak of light flew into his palm.</p><p>A demon core resided within the monstrous beast!</p><p>Qin Sang examined it, tentatively calling it a demon core.  It appeared similar to ordinary demon cores, formed from the Thunder Turtle's essence, equally radiant and breathtaking.</p><p>This demon core shimmered with silver light, with what appeared to be electric arcs dancing on its surface. It seemed to have integrated the Thunder Turtle's innate divine ability, possessing unique powers.</p><p>A Nascent Soul level demon core!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, extending a sliver of divine sense, attempting to probe the demon core's inner power. His expression shifted abruptly.</p><p>He had handled countless demon cores, but none like this. The difference wasn't merely due to realm. The power within the core was incredibly volatile, mirroring the monstrous beast's ferocity in life.</p><p>Yet, the Thunder Turtle was dead, its consciousness absent from the demon core.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to the Thunder Turtle's remains, summoning a section of demon bone. He discovered the bone shared the same volatile nature. Despite trying various methods, he couldn't pinpoint the source of this instability.</p><p>If the volatility couldn't be quelled, the materials were useless for refining or alchemy!</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>Was it a consequence of the Heavenly Change? Did the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Resonance not only assault the soul but also fundamentally alter affected beings?</p><p>Another possibility: the unique environment within the Return to the Ruins caused the monstrous beasts to be inherently like this.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Dragon Whale Clan's sacred artifact, known as the Mad Whale. It was said the Dragon Whale Clan had poured their entire clan's essence blood into it for ages before barely managing to refine it.  Back then, there was no Heavenly Dao's Demonic Resonance.</p><p>Qin Sang's refining knowledge was insufficient to handle these materials. He attempted every technique he'd learned, trying to refine the demon bone, only to ruin several pieces, finally abandoning the endeavor.</p><p>Such a massive demon corpse, yet to him, it was as useful as chicken ribs.</p><p>Nevertheless, given the Thunder Turtle's high cultivation, these materials, regardless of their current usability, were incredibly rare and precious. Unable to refine them and limited by the Thousand Jun Ring's spatial capacity, Qin Sang could only seal the essential parts, saving them for future experimentation.</p><p>A great battle yielded only unusable materials.  His desire to hunt monstrous beasts waned, his focus shifting to his journey.</p><p>Since leaving the Central Continent, Qin Sang had been traveling southeast.</p><p>The Beacon Gate, according to his senses, lay due east of the Central Continent.</p><p>The Beacon Gate was situated within the Return to the Ruins. However, the Return to the Ruins wasn't limited to just the gate. It was a vast chasm in the deep sea, stretching endlessly.</p><p>Based on the sea chart left by the Nascent Soul cultivator of the Wu Clan, the Canglang Sea shouldn't be too far from the Return to the Ruins.  Qin Sang intended to visit the Canglang Sea and also take a look at the Return to the Ruins.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Thump! Thump! Thump!’</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded fiercely. He hovered in mid-air, his face grave as he gazed ahead.</p><p>The scene within the heart of the storm was no different from elsewhere, yet a strange rumbling resonated amidst the wind, like the pulse of the world. Hearing this sound, Qin Sang's blood surged uncontrollably, a sense of inexplicable oppression weighing upon him.</p><p>He transformed into a bolt of lightning, streaking towards the source of the sound.</p><p>Soon, his light abruptly stopped. Qin Sang reappeared, staring ahead, nearly speechless.</p><p>In the East Sea, there is a great chasm, truly a bottomless valley. The waters of the eight directions and nine regions, the flow of the Heavenly River, all pour into it, yet it neither increases nor decreases…</p><p>The words from ancient texts surfaced in Qin Sang's mind, describing the scene before him, yet failing to capture the awe it inspired.</p><p>This was the eastern edge of the sea, where all waters converged and plunged into the great chasm.</p><p>‘Rumble… Rumble… Rumble…’</p><p>Qin Sang saw a waterfall stretching across the horizon. Its ends extended infinitely, its origin and destination unknown. The seawater, reaching this point, cascaded downwards, its roar deafening, drowning out the storm's howl.</p><p>For countless years, the seawater had flowed endlessly, relentlessly.</p><p>An immeasurable volume of water had poured into the chasm, yet the world's waters remained undiminished, the chasm never filled.</p><p>Looking down into the chasm, one could only see the waterfall plunging into the unknown, bottomless depths!</p><p>This was the Return to the Ruins!</p><p>The waterfall seemed to mark the storm's boundary, like a deep blue ribbon dividing the world into two halves: black and white.</p><p>On Qin Sang's side, fierce winds howled, the sky gloomy.  Yet, the overwhelming tempest couldn't penetrate the Return to the Ruins. It wasn't due to a barrier or boundary, but because a force greater than the hurricane resided within the chasm, repelling its intrusion.</p><p>Within the Return to the Ruins, a white expanse of churning mist formed a boundless sea of clouds.</p><p>The hurricane brushed against the cloud sea, causing the mist to ripple, creating waves.  As the wind ventured deeper, it visibly weakened until it was swallowed by the mist.</p><p>Unlike the dim storm, the sky above the Return to the Ruins was brightly lit. The source of the light was unknown, as if a great sun hung beyond the cloud sea.  Yet, the chasm's depths remained shrouded in utter darkness.</p><p>Within the cloud sea, immortal clouds drifted, morphing into countless forms.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, pavilions, towers, flying birds, and roaming beasts flickered into existence, a mesmerizing spectacle.</p><p>It seemed to contain a vast space, layered with immortal realms!</p><p>Qin Sang stood frozen, gazing at the Return to the Ruins, his blood boiling, his thoughts churning, unable to regain his composure.</p><p>He had achieved Nascent Soul cultivation, standing at the pinnacle of this world. Yet, before such cosmic power, he felt his own insignificance, igniting an even stronger fighting spirit!</p><p>Refined Void?</p><p>Body Integration?</p><p>Or perhaps Grand Completion?</p><p>He only wished that one day, having witnessed all the world's wonders, he could regard this place with indifference.</p><p>He stopped before the waterfall, venturing no further.</p><p>He hadn't forgotten the ancient texts' warnings: beneath the beauty lurked dangers capable of devouring even Nascent Soul cultivators. He strained his eyes, peering into the depths of the Return to the Ruins. A hint of gloom seemed to emanate from the cloud sea, perhaps the legendary Black Tide.</p><p>Even before entering, Qin Sang could sense the chaotic energy within, cautioning him against recklessness, especially with monstrous beasts lurking about.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the cloud sea, observing for a long while. Occasionally, massive ripples would surge within the depths, causing him to feel a pang of fear even from afar. Unfortunately, the distance and intervening obstacles, even with his Heavenly Eye divine ability, prevented him from seeing clearly. He couldn't tell if they were monstrous beasts.</p><p>The Return to the Ruins was easy to enter but difficult to exit, a truth not to be taken lightly.</p><p>He wasn't ready to traverse the path of ascension yet. He only wished to witness the legendary Return to the Ruins, having no intention of entering for now. If he were to venture in, it wouldn't be here. He should head north, first seeking Mount Daiyu, then the Beacon Gate.</p><p>Not having personally witnessed the monstrous beasts within, Qin Sang felt a lingering sense of unease. He lingered at the edge of the Return to the Ruins, reluctant to leave.</p><p>Months passed, and Qin Sang finally got his wish.</p><p>One day, a dazzling, multicolored light erupted from the cloud sea, piercing the sky, accompanied by a sharp, piercing cry.</p><p>Qin Sang's instinctive reaction was to retreat and conceal his aura. He then awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, activating his Heavenly Eye divine ability to peer into the light. However, the light vanished in a flash. In that fleeting glimpse, Qin Sang only saw half a wing.</p><p>The feathers on the wing were vibrantly colored and radiant, surpassing even legendary phoenixes.  Unfortunately, he couldn't discern the creature's true form. He didn't know what kind of monstrous beast it was.</p><p>He was certain it was a monstrous beast because he detected the familiar madness in its cry.</p><p>This colorful feathered monstrous bird was likely even more powerful than the Thunder Turtle, similarly plagued by the Demonic Resonance.</p><p>This proved that despite many monstrous beasts fleeing their lairs, some remained, and they were incredibly powerful, roaming above the Return to the Ruins.</p><p>The Return to the Ruins was now even more dangerous!</p><p>Having confirmed the presence of monstrous beasts, Qin Sang lingered no longer.  Encountering one emerging from the Return to the Ruins would be disastrous.</p><p>Taking one last look at the Return to the Ruins, Qin Sang turned westward, beginning his return journey.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept back and forth, recalling the markings on the sea chart, constantly adjusting his direction.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, seemingly sensing something. He flashed towards the front-left.</p><p>After flying for over a hundred miles, Qin Sang glanced upwards, flicking his sleeve. A surge of True Essence shot out, colliding with the void.</p><p>The seemingly empty void rippled, then a fissure cracked open. Within the fissure was darkness, yet Qin Sang could see a section of a coiled dragon stone pillar.</p><p>Atop the pillar was a carved stone dais.</p><p>He flashed inside, leaving the storm behind.</p><p>According to the sea chart, this was the first sanctuary after leaving the Canglang Sea. From here, traveling south would soon lead him to the Canglang Sea.</p><p>This sanctuary wasn't discovered by the Nascent Soul cultivator of the Wu Clan. It had been under the Wu Clan's control long ago.  Years later, the sanctuary remained, showing no signs of disturbance.</p><p>Since the rise of the Human Clan, the Wu Clan had been preoccupied, likely leaving little time for their experts to wander afar.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, closing his eyes to meditate, restoring himself to peak condition before setting off again.</p><p>Thirty-five years after entering the storm belt, he finally arrived at the Canglang Sea!</p><p>A vastly different scene appeared ahead. Qin Sang's face brightened as he sped forward, passing through an invisible barrier, finally escaping the storm!</p><p>Due to its proximity to the storm belt, the area was still affected, but far calmer.</p><p>Night had fallen.</p><p>Torrential rain poured down, the droplets striking the sea with incessant pitter-patter.</p><p>Observing the surroundings, the downpour showed no signs of stopping.  Qin Sang pondered, "This must be the Rain Desert."</p><p>The Rain Desert was the northernmost region of the Canglang Sea.  Influenced by the storm belt, it was perpetually drenched in rain, never seeing the sun. Even in his previous life, Qin Sang had never reached this place.</p><p>Flipping his palm, Qin Sang produced a token.</p><p>This was the token given to him by the descendants of the Four Saints Palace after the Seven Kills Hall battle. They had said that activating the token in the northernmost part of the Rain Desert would allow them to sense its fluctuations and personally come to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the young boy and girl, siblings.  The brother was called Bao Zhengnan, the sister Bao Xi. They were likely descendants of one of the Four Saints, Bao Gu.</p><p>"Centuries have passed. I wonder how the situation in the Canglang Sea has changed, and if they are still alive."</p><p>Qin Sang wished to unite the cultivators of a region, and the Four Saints Palace would be his greatest ally.</p><p>His divine sense activated the token, triggering its restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang's sleeves billowed as he slowly flew through the downpour.</p><p>Before long, his expression shifted, and he stopped.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
