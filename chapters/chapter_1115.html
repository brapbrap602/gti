<h1>Chapter 1107: The Pilgrimage Mountain</h1><p>---</p><p>"Have you ever sought a master while cultivating here?"  </p><p>Qin Sang put away the letter and looked at Tan Yien, asking.  </p><p>Tan Yien, hearing this, realized something and suppressed his excitement as he replied, "This junior was previously guided by my father. Due to my mediocre aptitude and the fear of joining another sect without a foundation, only to be sent to the battlefield as cannon fodder, I have been hiding in the Yin Mountain Pass, cultivating alone..."  </p><p>"Your talent is decent. There’s still a chance for you to form a Golden Core. I happen to be in need of assistance. Would you be willing to follow me?"  </p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, speaking in a calm tone.  </p><p>On one hand, as he had mentioned, Qin Sang had just returned to the Cold Domain and was short of capable hands to handle various trivial matters. Since he had already begun to entertain the idea of building his own faction, taking in a few disciples was a natural step.  </p><p>He had been observing Tan Yien for some time. The young man’s temperament and talent were both commendable, and as the son of an old acquaintance, he had no ties to other factions. His background was clean, making him a suitable candidate.  </p><p>On the other hand, Tan Yien was the son of Tan Hao. If Tan Hao were to return one day, they could meet directly.  </p><p>"This junior would be honored!"  </p><p>Tan Yien was overjoyed and immediately bowed deeply. "Disciple Tan Yien pays his respects to Uncle-Master Qin!"  </p><p>Qin Sang did not explicitly offer to take him as a disciple, so Tan Yien could only address him as "Uncle-Master."  </p><p>He wasn’t worried about this. Both his parents held Qin Sang in high esteem, and with his father’s connection, he was confident that Qin Sang would not treat him unfairly.  </p><p>"Rise. I cannot stay in the Yin Mountain Pass for long. If you have any unfinished business, settle it quickly and follow me," Qin Sang said.  </p><p>"Disciple obeys!"  </p><p>Tan Yien was a decisive person. He immediately packed up his mother’s memorial tablet and other belongings from his cave dwelling, left a letter for his father explaining his situation, sealed the cave, and followed Qin Sang.  </p><p>After leaving the Yin Mountain Pass, Qin Sang led Tan Yien westward.  </p><p>Though Tan Yien appeared rough and straightforward, he was actually quite meticulous. Although he didn’t know where Qin Sang was heading, he followed silently without asking too many questions.  </p><p>Qin Sang was very pleased with this and often gave him pointers on cultivation, which delighted Tan Yien.  </p><p>After a long journey, the two arrived at a picturesque region.  </p><p>Ahead, mountains and rivers stretched endlessly, their grandeur overwhelming. Clouds and mist swirled around the peaks, creating a majestic and ever-changing landscape.  </p><p>The Taiyi Alchemy Sect’s mountain gate was located deep within these mountains!  </p><p>This place was situated at the northwestern edge of the righteous faction’s territory, bordering the Heavenly Demon Hills to the west and the Arctic Ice Plains to the north. During autumn and winter, the scenery transformed into a different kind of beauty—a vast expanse of snow, blanketing everything in silver.  </p><p>"Wait here. Digest what I’ve taught you, and your cultivation should improve slightly," Qin Sang said, leaving Tan Yien behind as he flew alone toward the Taiyi Alchemy Sect.  </p><p>He had come to meet Wanderer Yun.  </p><p>The Taiyi Alchemy Sect’s mountain gate was built on both sides of a great river, surrounded by numerous lakes like scattered stars, with strange peaks rising all around.  </p><p>The scenery was a harmonious blend of lakes and mountains.  </p><p>After the great war in the cultivation world, the Taiyi Alchemy Sect had not declined but instead flourished. Arriving here, Qin Sang dared not act recklessly. He donned a cloak, descended to the riverbank, and proceeded on foot up the mountain.  </p><p>"May I ask for your esteemed name and the purpose of your visit?"  </p><p>Before Qin Sang had taken more than a few steps, he heard the sound of rushing air.  </p><p>A beam of light descended, revealing a young man dressed in the robes of the Taiyi Alchemy Sect.  </p><p>Qin Sang did not conceal his cultivation level.  </p><p>The young man’s tone was respectful.  </p><p>"This humble Daoist is named Qingfeng. I’ve come to visit an old friend, Fellow Daoist Wanderer Yun of your esteemed sect. Could you kindly inform him of my arrival?" Qin Sang stood still and spoke calmly.  </p><p>"Uncle-Master Yun!"  </p><p>The young man exclaimed, clearly familiar with Wanderer Yun.  </p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred. The young man appeared to have just reached the Foundation Establishment stage and addressed Wanderer Yun as "Uncle-Master," indicating that Wanderer Yun was not only alive but had also formed a Golden Core.  </p><p>No wonder he hadn’t heard of Wanderer Yun among the newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivators in recent years.  </p><p>Back then, after resolving his hidden ailment, Wanderer Yun’s cultivation speed had shocked Qin Sang.  </p><p>He had thought that after being reborn from the flames, Wanderer Yun might have ascended to Nascent Soul before him.  </p><p>"Esteemed senior, please wait a moment..."  </p><p>The young man hurried back up the mountain and soon returned, cupping his hands and saying, "Esteemed senior, Uncle-Master Yun is not currently at the sect. He left many years ago to travel and has not returned..."  </p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "Is Li Yufu here?"  </p><p>The young man shook his head again.  </p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to leave a letter and depart.  </p><p>After picking up Tan Yien, Qin Sang turned south, heading straight for the Yun Cang Marsh.  </p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang deliberately changed course, passing through the territory of the Great Sui Dynasty.  </p><p>He did not enter the capital.  </p><p>The acquaintances he had made in the Great Sui Dynasty had long turned to dust.  </p><p>The only thing worth remembering was a single monument.  </p><p>At nightfall, Qin Sang arrived alone at the Pilgrimage Mountain.  </p><p>Time was merciless. The unmarked monument still stood, but it was now covered in moss and wear.  </p><p>Qin Sang stood before the monument, silent for a long time.  </p><p>He looked up at the sky, recalling the bold words he had once spoken before her.  </p><p>Looking back now, he realized how naive and presumptuous he had been.  </p><p>Fortunately, he had stumbled his way through.  </p><p>"Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core... next is Nascent Soul..."  </p><p>Qin Sang gently touched the tombstone and murmured, "If I can reach that stage, I would be what mortals call an immortal. But that shouldn’t be my end. Otherwise, how could I fulfill the bold promises I made back then?"  </p><p>He poured wine for the one buried beneath the tomb.  </p><p>The chirping of insects around him gradually faded.  </p><p>But suddenly, a commotion arose at the foot of the mountain.  </p><p>Soon, Tan Yien hurried over. "Uncle-Master, there’s a mortal army fighting at the foot of the mountain. Both sides are led by nobles. There are also cultivators among them. I went to investigate and found that they are mostly at the Qi Refinement stage, likely rogue cultivators who have gotten involved in mortal conflicts..."  </p><p>"Cultivators?"  </p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze shifted, and he sighed. "No wonder I’ve been noticing traces of cultivators along the way. With the cultivation world in chaos, all sorts of petty figures are emerging, abandoning their cultivation to stir up trouble in the mortal realm. It seems the Pure Yang Sect has indeed declined, unable to even maintain order in the mortal world."  </p><p>How lamentable!  </p><p>The great achievements of the Empress had been destroyed in a short time due to this turmoil.  </p><p>The Great Sui Dynasty had fallen apart, and chaos reigned within its borders.  </p><p>Tan Yien nodded. "These rogue cultivators have no hope in their cultivation journey and limited lifespans. Mortal wealth holds great allure for them. My father once said that in the past, righteous factions would restrict cultivators from interfering in mortal affairs. But under the pressure of the Sin Abyss, they can only focus on their own territories and can no longer manage other regions."  </p><p>"In this way, mortals have easier access to cultivators than before."  </p><p>Qin Sang thought back to the difficulties he had faced in seeking immortality and sighed deeply.  </p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang said, "Go down and investigate. Find out the identities of the leaders of both mortal armies, and bring those rogue cultivators here as well."  </p><p>"Yes!"  </p><p>Tan Yien accepted the order and left.  </p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the unmarked monument for a while, then took out a few spiritual items and talismans from his Thousand Jun Ring.  </p><p>In the depths of the night, a thick fog suddenly enveloped the area around the monument.  </p><p>The fog condensed, the ground shook, and the monument sank into the earth, disappearing along with the fog. The area was left empty.  </p><p>Qin Sang could not stay to guard the Pilgrimage Mountain, so he used his methods to conceal the Empress’s monument, ensuring it would not be destroyed in the chaos of war.  </p><p>If he ever ascended to immortality, he wanted to be able to look down from the heavens and see it once more.</p>
