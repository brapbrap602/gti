<h1>Chapter 2081: Demonic Cultivator</h1><p>The Middle Continent, vast and boundless, easily accommodated the Human, Demon, and Witch races.</p><p>For the time being, the races didn't need to fight over territory, each recuperating and thriving within their own clearly defined domains.</p><p>The Demon Sea's territory, close to the Western Wastelands and bordering the Southern Sea, saw squadrons of demon soldiers soaring through clouds and mist on patrol, forming a tight defensive line, an atmosphere of grim readiness permeating the air.</p><p>Over a certain patch of sea, shortly after a squadron of demon soldiers flew past, the water suddenly surged. With a splash, waves erupted as a mature Shark-Jiao broke the surface, its maw wide open, revealing rows of razor-sharp fangs.</p><p>The Shark-Jiao spewed a column of water, and within it, surprisingly, was a whale, smaller than even a typical whale calf.</p><p>After expelling the whale, the Shark-Jiao's body stiffened, its eyes rapidly clouding over with a white film.  Belly up, it drifted along the current, lifeless.</p><p>The small whale wiggled its tail and swam into the sea. Its eyes, sharp and intelligent, glittered with an unusual light, clearly not those of an ordinary beast.</p><p>The surrounding demon soldiers remained completely oblivious.  The small whale oriented itself, then swam silently for a while, arriving beside an island. It poked its head out of the water, and a ball of cyan light floated out of its mouth, faintly revealing a round pearl within its throat.</p><p>The cyan light, once free, flickered and transformed into a pool of clear water. The small whale immediately closed its mouth and dove beneath the waves.</p><p>The water in midair wriggled, first sprouting limbs and a head, then hands, feet, and facial features, morphing into a water-formed being identical to Dragon Whale Holy King, though a head shorter.</p><p>The water-formed being blinked, instantly coming to life. Its aura shifted, exuding a pressure similar to the Dragon Whale Holy King's.  It abruptly raised its head, gazing towards the island's peak, its gaze like two sharp swords, clashing mid-air with another pair of eyes.</p><p>Atop the island, amidst a tangle of weeds, stood a towering figure clad in a dragon robe, exuding a heroic aura.  It was Flood Dragon King.</p><p>Flood Dragon King had witnessed the entire transformation. Seeing Dragon Whale Holy King's water spirit embodiment looking towards him, he nodded slightly, offering a friendly smile.</p><p>The water spirit embodiment took a step forward and, in the next instant, appeared at the edge of the boulder.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, why have you summoned me?" the water spirit embodiment spoke, its voice that of Dragon Whale Holy King, though slightly muffled.</p><p>Flood Dragon King observed him closely. This was his first encounter with the water spirit embodiment, unsure if Dragon Whale Holy King was directly manipulating it from the Eastern Sea, conversing with him across the distance.</p><p>"Golden Toad King returned saying Fellow Daoist Dragon Whale's cultivation has greatly advanced, and you are soon expected to attempt the late Nascent Soul stage?" Flood Dragon King asked curiously.</p><p>"This water spirit embodiment can only be maintained for a hundred breaths," the water spirit embodiment stated flatly, not answering the question.  This was a clear signal to Flood Dragon King not to waste time.</p><p>Flood Dragon King, unfazed, continued, "Hearing Golden Toad King speak of Green Goat View's protective formation, this King, before Green Goat View closed its mountain gates, specifically investigated. Golden Toad King's words were not exaggerated."</p><p>The water spirit embodiment hummed in acknowledgment.</p><p>Flood Dragon King didn't dwell on this matter, changing the subject, and asked in a low voice, "After Fellow Daoist breaks through to late Nascent Soul, what are your plans?"</p><p>The water spirit embodiment stared at Flood Dragon King, silent.</p><p>Flood Dragon King smiled, his expression turning grim.</p><p>"These past years, fighting against the Changyou Clan, our race has suffered countless casualties.  Despite our contributions no less than the humans', we are constantly suppressed by them.</p><p>"The humans are treacherous, only collaborating with us to fight external enemies.  Yet, every time Azure Spirit Qi is distributed, we must heed their wishes. Fortunately, our race is naturally gifted, otherwise, even after expelling the Changyou Clan, we would remain under their thumb, never to rise.</p><p>"Before, our race was weak, and we could only lie low and endure.  Once you and I both achieve late Nascent Soul, the balance of power will shift.  It will be time to reshape the world. Will Fellow Daoist continue to tolerate this?"</p><p>His tone carried a hint of enticement as he watched the water spirit embodiment.  Unfortunately, the water spirit embodiment remained expressionless.</p><p>The corner of Flood Dragon King's mouth curled upwards.  "Could it be that Fellow Daoist is reluctant to overthrow that Ice Beauty? Her lover drained this King's Dragon Transformation Pool, otherwise, this King wouldn't have been so gravely injured, nearly perishing during the Heavenly Tribulation. If you could take her into your fold, you could also help this King avenge this grievance.  But, pray tell, it's not that Fellow Daoist has fallen under her spell, haha…"</p><p>The provocation was useless against Dragon Whale Holy King. The water spirit embodiment calmly stated, "The Changyou Clan also has a few capable individuals."</p><p>Flood Dragon King's laughter ceased, understanding the underlying meaning.</p><p>The human race's gradual weakening stemmed from a lack of inheritance. The Changyou Clan, however, possessed both inheritance and divine abilities. In the previous battle, several of them displayed remarkable cultivation.</p><p>Not only was their strength increasing, but the enemy was also growing stronger.</p><p>The Changyou Clan could also produce one, or even several, late Nascent Soul experts.  Their breakthrough wouldn't change the Tempest Realm's predicament.  Now was not the time for internal strife.</p><p>"This King doesn't intend to annihilate the human race.  With our race's growing power, the Tempest Realm should be led by us, with us distributing the Azure Spirit Qi. Of course, if the Ice Beauty and the Changyou Clan Leader could be manipulated into mutually assured destruction, that would be the most beneficial for our race."</p><p>Flood Dragon King deliberately paused, and seeing no reaction from Dragon Whale Holy King, continued, "Those who are not of our kind are surely treacherous! Even if we suppress the Changyou Clan, the three races can never coexist peacefully. We, as fellow demonkind, are far more trustworthy than outsiders.  Why don't the Eastern Sea and the Demon Sea join forces?"</p><p>Dragon Whale Holy King remained noncommittal, asking, "Has Fellow Daoist consulted with Feather King?"</p><p>Flood Dragon King sneered.  "That fellow has fostered some Spirit Taming Sect, thick as thieves with the human race, seemingly content. However, his domain lies in the heart of the Northern Sea, adjacent to the Profound Heaven Palace and Green Goat View's ancestral grounds.  His true intentions may not be so clear. This King will find a way to test him."</p><p>The water spirit embodiment nodded, finally offering a direct response. "This King has yet to break through.  Considering these matters now is premature."</p><p>This was not the answer Flood Dragon King sought.  He furrowed his brow.  "Fellow Daoist might as well hear this King's plan first.  There is another like-minded friend.  Would Fellow Daoist like to meet him?"</p><p>"There's no need! If Fellow Daoist has no other matters, this King will take his leave."</p><p>The water spirit embodiment flatly refused, its body melting like a candle, about to turn into a puddle of water.</p><p>Flood Dragon King's expression shifted slightly, and he quickly said, "This King is not forcing Fellow Daoist to take a stance immediately. However, Fellow Daoist should at least give this King a promise of neutrality."</p><p>"This King needs to enter secluded cultivation…"</p><p>The water spirit embodiment left these words behind, completely dissolving.</p><p>Flood Dragon King's brow relaxed slightly.  "Green Goat View speaks lofty words, but simply for the sake of re-establishing their mountain gates, they dare to demand everyone's cooperation! Since they disregarded the bigger picture first, at the next tri-racial council, this King intends to demand the human race assist our race in reclaiming our ancestral lands. I hope Fellow Daoist can lend your support."</p><p>There was no response. Only a patch of dampness remained on the boulder.</p><p>Just then, a ball of green ghostly fire drifted out from the grass beside the boulder, floating above the rock. The flames flickered, and a spectral figure emerged.</p><p>The figure, like a wraith, surrounded by ghostly fire, was pale and lifeless, radiating a chilling aura even under the blazing sun.</p><p>The ghostly figure glanced at the water stain, worried. "Dragon Whale Holy King refused?"</p><p>"He didn't agree, but he didn't refuse either."</p><p>Flood Dragon King sneered.  "That fellow only sides with the victor. As long as we gain the upper hand, he will come to us on his own."</p><p>Hearing this, the ghostly figure's expression eased somewhat, but doubts lingered. He originally thought that, in this inter-racial conflict, Dragon Whale Holy King would certainly agree to join forces with Flood Dragon King.</p><p>What was Dragon Whale Holy King thinking?</p><p>If all the demon races united against them, the human race, if they wanted to avoid division, would have to make significant concessions.</p><p>With only the Demon Sea demon race, their strength was much weaker.  Their plan was likely to encounter variables.</p><p>In truth, Flood Dragon King wasn't as confident as he appeared. Hidden beneath Dragon Whale Holy King's rough exterior and domineering demeanor was a profound mind, unfathomable until the very end.</p><p>But overthrowing the human race would benefit all demonkind. Flood Dragon King couldn't fathom a reason for Dragon Whale Holy King's betrayal.</p><p>He lifted his eyes, looking at the ghostly figure, and said, "Next, it depends on Fellow Daoist Hong."</p><p>The ghostly figure bowed slightly.  "Rest assured, Flood Dragon King. Hong will not disappoint."</p><p>Flood Dragon King stared into the ghostly figure's eyes, a cold smile spreading across his face.  "This King naturally trusts Fellow Daoist Hong, but as for the others under your command, this King has had little contact with them. I wonder if their origins are truly clean, if they all possess the necessary ruthlessness."</p><p>The ghostly figure's expression turned serious. "Hong understands the gravity of this matter and has personally overseen everything, investigating each Fellow Daoist's background. They are absolutely clean. As for their ruthlessness, Flood Dragon King need not worry.  These Fellow Daoists were once demonic giants, just like Hong, having slaughtered countless humans.  Their hearts hold only the Great Dao. Even if millions die before them, they wouldn't blink.  As long as it benefits their path, they are willing to do anything!"</p><p>"That's good."</p><p>Flood Dragon King clasped his hands behind his back, gazing towards the Middle Continent.  "Fellow Daoist Hong should know that once we begin, there is no turning back, and you, even less so!"</p><p>"Hmph! Though we are demonic cultivators, we can also slay enemies and earn merit! Yet, when they distribute the Azure Spirit Qi, they exclude us."</p><p>The ghostly figure's face was filled with hatred. "Fortunately, Heaven has eyes, allowing Hong to step into the Nascent Soul realm.  They are unjust, so don't blame Hong for being unrighteous!"</p><p>Demonic cultivators also had their hierarchy. Some cultivated demonic arts, some refused to be bound by rules, and some were truly evil, devoid of any good intentions.</p><p>Among them, the most notorious were those lawless individuals, unrestrained and unburdened, who happened to cultivate the most sinister demonic arts, resorting to blood sacrifices at every turn.</p><p>These demonic cultivators were uncontrollable.  As long as they deemed it beneficial, they would do anything. Demonic sects like the Sky Hao Tower refused to associate with them. Yet, such actions often yielded the greatest benefits, allowing them to rise above the rest and become demonic giants.</p><p>If these demonic cultivators gained power, there would be no hope of them protecting the Tempest Realm.  Once the situation turned dire, they would flee faster than anyone.</p><p>The Tempest Realm hadn't reached the point of needing to compromise with such individuals. It was impossible to share Azure Spirit Qi with them. They had even been specifically purged to prevent them from wreaking havoc behind the lines during the war ahead.</p><p>These demonic cultivators could only hide and endure,不敢出来作乱.</p><p>However, with the resurgence of Heaven and Earth spiritual energy, whether through innate talent or fortuitous encounters, there were always individuals who could ascend to the Nascent Soul stage on their own.</p><p>The carnage and rivers of blood resulting from the great war were also welcomed by some demonic cultivators.</p><p>Ghost Shadow was one of them. He had gathered around him a group of similarly aggrieved demonic cultivators, forming a considerable force.</p><p>The temptation of Azure Spirit Qi was too great. They were unwilling to live in the shadows forever.</p><p>They had considered defecting to the Changyou Clan, but a broken nest offered no safe eggs. The Changyou Clan's genocidal attitude meant that once the Tempest Realm fell, they would lose their value.  So, they had hesitated.</p><p>However, they soon came into contact with Flood Dragon King and, recruited by him, decided to pledge their allegiance.</p><p>"Azure Spirit Qi?"</p><p>Flood Dragon King suddenly asked, "Is Fellow Daoist Hong not afraid this King will also go back on his word?"</p><p>The ghostly figure's expression remained unchanged.  "As long as the human race is not extinguished, Flood Dragon King will have need of us. In the future, when Flood Dragon King's divine might prevails, and he consecutively vanquishes the Changyou Clan, the human race, and the demon races, if we ask for a bit of Azure Spirit Qi and leave this place, Flood Dragon King, as the sole ruler, surely won't begrudge us this small amount?"</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>Flood Dragon King roared with laughter, his eyes flashing.  "Dragon Whale Holy King is right.  It's premature to consider these things now.  Fellow Daoist Hong can return and prepare.  Await this King's good news!"</p><p>The ghostly figure bowed deeply.  "I shall take my leave!"</p><p>With that, the ghostly figure flashed and merged into the ghostly fire. With a 'crack', the ghostly fire flared, leaving no trace.</p><p>Flood Dragon King remained in place for a long time before departing.</p><p>The sea breeze dried the water stain on the boulder, and the island returned to its desolation.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Goat View.</p><p>With Qin Sang's tailored plan for Green Goat View, the re-establishment of the mountain gates progressed smoothly.</p><p>With the united efforts of Green Goat View, the landscape had transformed dramatically.  Several peaks and even a large river had been relocated.  The picturesque mountains and rivers already hinted at the future grandeur of a major sect.</p><p>Unseen beneath the surface, Green Goat View channeled spiritual veins, converging them towards the chosen main peak, gradually creating a confluence of power.</p><p>Seeing the mountain gates improve bit by bit under their own hands, the Green Goat View disciples were filled with pride.</p><p>If someone were to enter at this time, they might glimpse the secrets of the protective formation. Therefore, Li Yufu had recently announced the closure of the mountain, refusing all visitors.  The other sects tactfully refrained from disturbing them.</p><p>Having received so many guests previously, Li Yufu worried about revealing flaws in their presence and was exhausted. Finally, he had a period of peace, but he wasn't idle.  All matters of Green Goat View required his personal attention.</p><p>"Senior Brother."</p><p>Shen Chen's voice came from outside the temporary palace.</p><p>Li Yufu opened the door, allowing Shen Chen to enter.  "Junior Brother, another batch of spirit banners refined?"</p><p>Shen Chen nodded, placing down a storage pouch.  "All the spirit banners are here. We can select a group of disciples to begin refining them."</p><p>He noticed Li Yufu's solemn expression and asked, "What worries Senior Brother? Are you still afraid they will object?  Could it be that the Changyou Clan is making moves again?"</p><p>The day of the tri-racial council was approaching, and Li Yufu had already spread the word that this meeting would decide the matter.</p><p>Li Yufu's brow relaxed. "I'm not worried about that. We are voluntarily consolidating our power, something they would welcome, how could they object?  But these individuals are all shrewd. Every word and action of mine needs careful consideration, rehearsed several times in my mind beforehand."</p>
