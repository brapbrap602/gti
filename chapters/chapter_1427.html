<h1>Chapter 1419: The Slave Dao Divine Ability (Supplementary Update)</h1><p>Chapter 1419: The Slave Dao Divine Ability (Supplementary Update)</p><p>Descendant of the Wu Tribe.</p><p>The Wu Tribe!</p><p>A flash of insight struck Qin Sang.</p><p>So that's it!</p><p>The Ghost Mother is very likely a powerful cultivator from the ancient Wu Tribe.</p><p>A powerful cultivator of the Wu Tribe, living to this day, not slumbering on the Wu God Continent, but instead coming to a place without the Wu Tribe, then sealed by the Sky Transcendent Cultivator upon awakening, nearly perishing…</p><p>Qin Sang truly didn't know whether to say the Ghost Mother was lucky or unlucky.</p><p>No wonder Hundred Flowers Valley has Wu Tribe inheritance.</p><p>Even Qin Sang, who cultivates natal insect Gu, couldn't achieve this level of refinement. It originated from a powerful cultivator of the Wu Tribe!</p><p>No wonder the Hundred Flowers Valley founder came from the Empty Spirit Sea.</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley founder was likely a disciple of the Ghost Mother back then.</p><p>No, maybe not a disciple.</p><p>Perhaps when the Ghost Mother first awoke, she was weak and casually guided a few people to work for her. Otherwise, she wouldn't have let her disciple go astray.</p><p>A casual act, yet it led to the creation of a renowned sect in the Xuan Yue Realm.</p><p>To find the insect control secret arts, Hundred Flowers Valley is unavoidable. Discovering the insect control secret arts in Hundred Flowers Valley and then investigating the Empty Spirit Sea was inevitable; it was only a matter of time.</p><p>If I had been a step slower, I would have missed Tan Hao.</p><p>Conversely, arriving earlier would have allowed me to meet the Ghost Mother.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but lament the twists of fate.</p><p>He has a Wu Tribe descendant right beside him, someone the Ghost Mother is looking for.</p><p>It's unclear what the Ghost Mother's purpose is, but the Wu Tribe descendant is certainly extremely important to her. Without Qin Sang needing to say much, the Ghost Mother would have done everything to awaken Ya Gu.</p><p>Yet he perfectly missed the Ghost Mother!</p><p>“The Tian Shi Sect's inheritance isn't entirely Corpse Dao. The Tian Shi Talisman was created by the Ghost Mother senior to quickly improve the Tian Shi Sect's strength.  She combined human Corpse Dao and simplified a top-tier Slave Dao divine ability of the Wu Tribe, resulting in such miraculous effects. If I had found the senior earlier, there might have been a chance to save Tan Jie, but it's too late. He has completely fallen, and the senior tried several times, all failing…”</p><p>Tan Hao only regretted his weak cultivation back then, missing the opportunity.</p><p>“So it's a Slave Dao divine ability.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; everything made sense.</p><p>This is the Ghost Mother's style: improving the natal insect Gu and the Slave Dao to suit human cultivation.</p><p>Right, there's also the Bone Curse, similar to divine runes!</p><p>Living corpses aren't 'corpses,' but corpse slaves. No wonder the Tian Shi Talisman is engraved in the primordial spirit.</p><p>Presumably, the complete Slave Dao divine ability must be extraordinary. The simplified Tian Shi Talisman can be used by low-level cultivators to forcibly control cultivators of the same level.</p><p>However, the Cang Lang Sea Wu Tribe doesn't seem to understand Slave Dao. Otherwise, he would have discovered something amiss.</p><p>Perhaps they lost this part of the inheritance.</p><p>Slave Dao, natal insect Gu, divine runes—the Wu Tribe inheritance is truly exceptionally sinister.</p><p>Well, it's barbaric.</p><p>No… it's primal, but also closer to nature.</p><p>Qin Sang's impression of the Wu Tribe surfaced in his mind. He asked, “Did Ghost Mother senior ever mention the purpose of searching for a Wu Tribe descendant?”</p><p>Tan Hao recalled, “She mentioned something about the Wu Tribe bloodline… helping her return.”</p><p>Return? What does that mean?</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of the Ascension Platform, and the departing Bai, his senior sister, and Ye Lao Mo.</p><p>Powerful Wu Tribe cultivators are also striving for transcendence.</p><p>They need Wu Tribe bloodline. Is it to obtain guidance from the outside world? If the Ghost Mother is found, will it be good or bad for Ya Gu?</p><p>Various possibilities flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The Ghost Mother is gone, and there's no way to verify it.</p><p>Missing this opportunity, finding the Ghost Mother again will be difficult.</p><p>Central Plains.</p><p>That doesn't sound simple. There might also be Wu Tribe people there. After the Ghost Mother achieves her goal, will she return to the North Sea, or will she directly return?</p><p>If I go to the Central Plains…</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't optimistic.</p><p>He wasn't willing to stop here.  Since he knows about the Central Plains and that there are sea charts leading there from the North Sea, he will definitely make a trip to find a way out of this cage and explore the truth of this world.</p><p>But this won't be until hundreds of years later.</p><p>He first needs to find a way to obtain the sea chart, and then he needs enough strength to survive in the storm belt.</p><p>The Central Plains will certainly not be close.</p><p>Qin Sang risked so much going from the Northern Star Realm to the North Sea, only daring to set off after reaching the late Yuan Ying stage. If it's too far, and the sea chart doesn't show clear shelters, he might even need to reach the Transformation God stage.</p><p>Transformation God.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not even hope for that.</p><p>Can Ya Gu hold on until then?</p><p>He no longer has the Three Lights Jade Liquid. If he can't find a replacement elixir, even if Ya Gu's soul can be maintained by the Soul-Nurturing Wood, her body will lose its vitality and completely turn into a corpse.</p><p>“What method did Ghost Mother senior use when saving Tan Jie?”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked.</p><p>As he spoke, he summoned Ya Gu.</p><p>Tan Hao glanced at Ya Gu, then at Qin Sang, without probing their relationship.  He lowered his head, contemplating for a moment before saying, "A senior once said that the Heavenly Corpse Talisman she created was imperfect, easy to apply but difficult to remove. It requires the use of a top-tier Wu Clan soul-binding secret technique for careful removal. Otherwise, it's easy to backfire and cause irreversible damage. The senior only dared to attempt it after returning to Beihai and recovering her strength."</p><p>Qin Sang felt even heavier after Tan Hao's words.</p><p>The more significant the Heavenly Corpse Talisman's origins, the smaller the chance of Ya Gu waking up on her own.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Tan Hao examined Ya Gu, a surprised expression on his face. "How long has she been asleep?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "Over two hundred and fifty years."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Tan Hao exclaimed, "Not much later than Tan Jie. How did you keep her in such good condition?"</p><p>Three Lights Jade Liquid, Soul-Nourishing Wood, and a mysterious spirit insect that willingly submitted to her.</p><p>Qin Sang silently recited these in her mind, suddenly realizing that compared to Tan Jie, Ya Gu's luck was unbelievably good.</p><p>With so many treasures used on her, there had to be a difference.</p><p>Seeing Tan Hao's expression, Qin Sang hurriedly asked, "Brother Tan, what have you noticed?"</p><p>Tan Hao recalled unpleasant memories, his voice low. "After Brother Qin left, I stayed with Tan Jie. Corpse Qi quickly polluted his physical body. That crystal coffin only delayed the inevitable. Thankfully, Tan Jie's soul wasn't extinguished; his consciousness, though hazy, was still perceptible, giving me a sliver of hope. But as time went on, I noticed a strange change in his soul—it became rigid, lifeless, his consciousness fading until it completely vanished.  After meeting the Ghost Mother senior, she tried some methods to nurture his soul, to awaken some of his consciousness, but it was futile.  If we'd met Brother Qin earlier, the outcome might have been different."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know how to comfort Tan Hao.</p><p>He still had a few Soul-Nourishing Wood talismans; giving one away wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>But the fat silkworm that willingly submitted as an anchor—there was no second one.</p><p>Qin Sang had a feeling that the fat silkworm, not the Soul-Nourishing Wood, was likely the most crucial factor in Ya Gu's condition.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Tan Hao reached into his bosom and took out a round jade pendant.</p><p>"This was personally refined by the senior when she infiltrated Xuan Tian Palace, a warning token given to me, containing a trace of her spiritual sense. If we encounter her again, she should be able to sense it."</p><p>"If you have the chance, please save her!"</p><p>"Definitely!"</p><p>Tan Hao's gaze shifted from Tan Jie's tombstone to Qin Sang, solemnly handing him the pendant.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to the generous patron, Qi Zhi You Zou, for the generous donation.</p><p>I owe more and more, so let me quickly repay with this update.</p>
