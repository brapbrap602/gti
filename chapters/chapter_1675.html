<h1>Chapter 1666 A Spark of Understanding</h1><p>As Qin Sang moved, he pretended to intently analyze the protective spirit array, using the Fire Jade Centipede’s sensitivity to the Crimson Immortal Pendant to locate Kun Dao’s position.</p><p>He gradually approached Kun Dao, reaching the closest point, only to be stopped by the spirit array protecting the medicinal garden.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, passing that spot as if searching for flaws in the array, avoiding alarming her.</p><p>The target was indeed inside the medicinal garden, stationary.</p><p>However…</p><p>Through the Fire Jade Centipede's perception, Kun Dao’s location didn’t seem to be truly within the garden, but above it, in… the sky!</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, filled with doubts. He casually glanced upwards, only to see a surging wind煞, his vision blocked by layers of protective arrays.</p><p>He recalled his initial feeling upon entering; the summit of Di Shou Mountain seemed to have a barrier, connected to the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, sealing off this small area.</p><p>He hadn’t bothered to verify it then, as even if he had, it wouldn't have mattered much. He couldn't destroy the barrier alone, and might suffer backlash or unnecessary danger from a reckless attempt.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang felt he grasped some key details.</p><p>Kun Dao's performance on the mountain and within the Five Elements Divine Prohibition differed greatly. Within the Prohibition, she was untraceable, elusive, causing Qin Sang to abandon the thought of pursuing her.</p><p>After entering the mountain, she acted strangely; her movements were clearly captured by the Fire Jade Centipede, unless she was disguising herself, or was somehow restricted.</p><p>But the Fire Jade Centipede hadn't been exposed, so she had no need for disguise.</p><p>It's reasonable to speculate that the barrier integrated the power of the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, or that the Prohibition formed the basis of the barrier.  However, the entire barrier wasn't entirely composed of the Prohibition, limiting her to utilizing only part of its power.</p><p>She hid within the barrier, remaining concealed, stirring up trouble from the shadows, but no longer as freely as before.</p><p>New discoveries and previously noted details flowed through his mind, combined with his knowledge of prohibition arrays, leading Qin Sang to a seemingly logical conclusion.</p><p>If his guess was correct, it was doable!</p><p>The key was planning, how to trap Kun Dao.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his own resources. His spells and artifacts were mostly straightforward, but the Ice Soul Divine Light and Xuan Tian Yi Qi Da Qin Na were usable, followed by a sword array to finish.</p><p>What medicinal herbs would the female cultivator use as bait, and who was the target?</p><p>As he pondered, a glint suddenly flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He inwardly exclaimed, realizing Kun Dao, swift as a rabbit, had reached her peak speed and was charging towards the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>“She’s making her move!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Kun Dao's trap was unexpectedly swift; they hadn't even entered the garden, and the “fish” weren't all gathered yet!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang sensed frequent tremors in the medicinal garden's protective array, causing the wind煞 to rage. Mo Xing Dao and the others had begun to break the array.</p><p>Simultaneously, the strange fragrance intensified.</p><p>Without time to think, Qin Sang quickly flew towards the entrance.</p><p>However, the unexpected at the entrance proved far faster than anticipated.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao was present, awed by the two True Persons' presence, standing at a distance.  Seeing them remain still, he wouldn't act rashly, but neither did he retreat.</p><p>From his position, he could see the purple light in Zi Lei Zhenren’s pupils and noticed his nostrils flaring, sensing the source of the strange fragrance.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao had tried; the scent was elusive, untraceable, only confirming it originated from the garden.</p><p>Curious about Zi Lei Zhenren’s methods, he watched intently.</p><p>At that time, He Gao Zhenren, unable to find Qin Sang, turned to Mo Xing Dao and bowed slightly, “Daoist Mo, you and Su Zi Nan have separated?”</p><p>During the teleportation array battle, Mo Xing Dao had aided Zhu Wu Dao's escape, causing friction.  He Gao Zhenren, though annoyed, didn't show it, keeping his tone civil.</p><p>“Daoist Su has other matters,” Mo Xing Dao responded briefly, as always.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren frowned, “Daoist Mo, unaffiliated with any sect, yet achieving such accomplishments, living freely—I’ve long admired it. But, since you are not a member of the demonic sect, why do you repeatedly collude with those demons?”</p><p>He attempted to persuade Mo Xing Dao.</p><p>This person, adrift in the northern wasteland’s demonic lands, wasn’t entirely pure, but his harsh methods were mostly used against his enemies, preventing a seriously wicked reputation.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Mo Xing Dao suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p>Noticing the change in Mo Xing Dao’s gaze, He Gao Zhenren looked and found his senior brother had withdrawn his divine powers, shifting his attention away from the medicinal garden.</p><p>“No heavenly treasures in the garden?”</p><p>Master Hegao, sensing his senior brother’s lack of interest and intent to leave, hurriedly used voice transmission to inquire.</p><p>Master Zilei slightly nodded, saying, “The fragrance is likely a blend of Wanlixiang, Ganlu Mingtan, and several other rare herbs known for their potent scents, hence the far-reaching aroma.”</p><p>Upon hearing the names of these herbs, Master Hegao instantly recalled their properties from memory.  They were indeed rare and exceedingly old, capable of producing at least top-quality elixirs.</p><p>Such herbs, if found elsewhere, would be fiercely contested.</p><p>But how could they compare to the number one spiritual treasure of Central Plains?</p><p>Of course, the garden might hold even more precious treasures, but it was surely heavily guarded, making a search too troublesome.  Wasting time on that could jeopardize the competition for the main treasure.</p><p>He glanced at Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Master Hegao felt a pang of regret.  This vast treasure trove was about to fall into another's hands.</p><p>Mo Xingdao felt a warning, growing wary.</p><p>Master Zilei, a master of strategic decision-making, didn't give Mo Xingdao another glance and prepared to leave.</p><p>Just then, likely due to the accumulated power of the wind demon and the long neglect of the spirit array, the protective array suddenly vibrated violently.</p><p>Master Zilei’s eyebrows shot up as he abruptly turned around.</p><p>Mo Xingdao and Master Hegao felt it too, both gazing towards the garden entrance.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The stone hut at the garden entrance shook violently, threatening to collapse. However, the three weren't looking at the hut, but at the stone wall above it.</p><p>Atop the hill, a transparent light barrier appeared out of thin air.  Simultaneously, a green shadow materialized, clinging to the light barrier's surface.</p><p>It was a green vine, thick at the base like a sapling, needing no support.</p><p>The vine was vibrant, its leaves lush and green.  Below the layers of leaves, fruits seemed to be forming, with two clusters of milky-white light peeking through the gaps.</p><p>The glow was soft, possessing a strange allure, making one itch to uncover the mystery of the fruit.</p><p>The vine pressed against the barrier, its tendrils like feelers, seemingly trying to break through.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Master Zilei paused, finding the vine vaguely familiar but unable to place it.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The light barrier unleashed a bolt of lightning, striking the vine.</p><p>The vine, reacting like a living creature, convulsed, shrinking and recoiling before vanishing in an instant.</p><p>“A transformed herb?”</p><p>Master Hegao exclaimed, then refuted himself.  “No, it's not a transformed herb, but it has developed sentience, capable of moving freely.  There are seals and restrictions inside, and it's trying to escape…”</p><p>Mid-sentence, Master Hegao noticed the changed expressions of his senior brother and Mo Xingdao.  Mo Xingdao, in particular, showed undisguised joy and burgeoning greed.</p><p>Master Hegao was surprised and immediately recalled the fleeting glimpse of the vine.</p><p>The vine's fruit, round like a miniature moon, emitted a radiant light, creating an illusion of a celestial palace, with fairies dancing around the divine fruit…</p><p>Master Hegao's mouth fell open, his voice trembling.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“The Lingxi Immortal Fruit!”</p><p>Master Zilei's voice cut through the air.</p><p>A single drop of Lingxi, communicating with the heavenly mechanism!</p><p>Legend has it that this herb was rare even in ancient times, a superior immortal medicine used for ascension.</p><p>For the first time since joining the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, Master Zilei showed emotion.  He was only a step away from ascension, but that step felt like a chasm, requiring external assistance.</p><p>The Sword Tomb was undoubtedly the best choice.</p><p>While not as good as the Sword Tomb, the Lingxi Immortal Fruit was a rare immortal medicine in this world, unmatched even by the Eight Scenic Spots.</p><p>To think that the Wuxiang Immortal Sect possessed such a treasure!</p><p>With the Lingxi Immortal Fruit, he had a high chance of ascension, returning to his original plan. Achieving ascension would solve all problems, eliminating the need to struggle for the spiritual treasure.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A dull explosion echoed through the void.</p><p>A purple light tore through the wind demon, and Master Zilei instantly appeared at the garden entrance.</p><p>Master Hegao and Master Zilei, understanding the fruit's importance, instinctively sought to prevent interference.  Master Hegao summoned his jade smoke and flowing water, intending to block Mo Xingdao, when he sensed fluctuations within the wind demon behind Mo Xingdao.</p><p>More people have arrived!</p><p>And Qin Sang, who disappeared a short while ago, is surely watching from the shadows.  Seeing them break the spirit array, he'll be drawn in.</p><p>This means they're up against at least three powerful cultivators.</p><p>Even Master Hegao, with his profound cultivation, finds this difficult.</p><p>A moment's hesitation is all Mo Xingdao needs. He unleashes his spiritual energy, aiming not at Master Hegao, but towards the entrance of the medicinal garden.</p><p>The protective spirit array continues to tremble from the impact of the gale.</p><p>During the previous standoff, they had secretly analyzed the array, identifying several weak points, not just at the garden entrance.</p><p>In a flash of insight, Master Hegao decides not to engage Mo Xingdao.  His participation will speed up the process of breaking the array.  Securing the Spirit-Sensitive Vine before others arrive would benefit them.</p><p>Observing Mo Xingdao's calm demeanor, Master Hegao gives him a deep look, impressed by his courage. He moves swiftly to Master Zilei's side, and the two brothers attack the array together.</p><p>A deafening roar erupts from the garden entrance.</p><p>Master Zilei's forehead shows a thunder mark; purple lightning erupts, continuously bombarding the misty form of the array.</p><p>Master Hegao unleashes his jade smoke to its fullest extent, alongside the purple lightning, like two mighty rivers, their abundant true energy surging like a vast ocean.</p><p>Simultaneously, he holds up his Qingluo Treasure Umbrella to deflect the array's counterattack.</p><p>The two masters unleash their power, and Mo Xingdao doesn't lag behind. His spiritual energy expands to the size of a millstone, repeatedly smashing against the array, causing it to tremble violently.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The three powerful cultivators attack with all their might.</p><p>The violent impact reverberates, and the stone house collapses first.</p><p>The light barrier on the ceiling shakes, but it's sturdy. The vine attacks again, but is repelled by the barrier's enchantments.</p><p>It seems to sense the impending danger and struggles desperately.</p><p>Next, the three use artifacts specializing in breaking enchantments.  After a violent tremor, the mist at the garden entrance is finally blasted open by the two masters. The opening is brief, but enough for Master Zilei.</p><p>A violet light shines from his forehead.  The thunder mark detaches and flies into the crack. Simultaneously, Master Hegao throws his Qingluo Treasure Umbrella in, and Mo Xingdao smashes through the mist with his spiritual energy millstone.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The array entrance finally gives way, the mist exploding outward with tremendous force.</p><p>In an instant, two shadowy figures appear atop the stone wall, near the light barrier, but the vine is gone.</p><p>Mo Xingdao is caught in the array's backlash, slightly disheveled. He falls behind, entering the medicinal garden to see Master Zilei's hand, charged with endless purple lightning, striking the light barrier.</p><p>Without a spectacular lightning strike, his hand passes straight through, shattering the barrier into pieces.</p><p>Without hesitation, the two masters step through the remnants of the barrier and unleash their spiritual senses, sweeping the area with furious intensity.</p><p>Working together perfectly, each searches half the area. The hilltop is larger than expected, but the two masters quickly complete their search.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's expression changes slightly as he rushes up the wall. Although he tries to avoid detection, he feels the two masters locking onto him, the pressure mounting.</p><p>Just as he reaches the hilltop, the two masters suddenly focus on him, the light barrier fragments around him shimmering with green light.</p><p>"The vine!"</p><p>Mo Xingdao's eyes narrow; without fully seeing, he instinctively extends his hand, imbued with true energy, to grab something ahead.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Mo Xingdao is stunned. He missed.  The vine was shattered—it was an illusion.</p><p>However, the attacks of the two masters don't stop.</p><p>Thunder roars in his ears, along with the sound of crashing waves—the jade smoke.</p><p>Simultaneously, a voice rings out from behind him, "Fellow Daoist, do you intend to keep the immortal fruit for yourself?"</p><p>It's the Poison King, who also saw the Spirit-Sensitive Vine.</p><p>A three-way assault ensues. Powerful true energy thunders, deafeningly loud. Mo Xingdao's figure is engulfed in the energy. Qin Sang, arriving from afar, witnesses this, but his attention is elsewhere.</p><p>Another figure appears behind the Poison King—Su Zinan, arriving last.</p><p>He and Qin Sang entered together, only slightly behind Qin Sang on the Celestial Ladder.  But Kun Dao, knowing of his connection with Mo Xingdao, worried about a warning, hindered him, delaying him even further than the Poison King.</p><p>Qin Sang was being pursued and couldn't warn Mo Xingdao, so Kun Dao didn't treat him differently.</p><p>Actually, Kun Dao's actions were entirely unnecessary—Su Zinan wasn't that kind.</p><p>Su Zinan arrives, seeing Mo Xingdao surrounded, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>This scene is too familiar!</p><p>The three are after the immortal fruit. If Mo Xingdao backs down, they might not kill him, but what about Kun Dao in the shadows?</p><p>"Mo Daoist, be careful!"</p><p>Su Zinan shouts, his magic banner appearing openly for the first time.  Two demonic souls don't block the attacks, instead going straight for Mo Xingdao.</p><p>The moment is fleeting. He's like a hunter seizing prey.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A clang of metal echoes.</p><p>Everyone is shocked to see that Mo Xingdao's position is now occupied by a dark-skinned figure.</p><p>Su Zinan's face darkens, his words barely audible, "Yuanhou Puppet!"</p>
