<h1>Chapter 1891: Seated in the Shrine of the Venerable God</h1><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>A silver lightning serpent tore through the celestial clouds, rapidly enlarging in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>Infinite divine power descended with the thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes widened, his body stiffening, his blood freezing, a primal tremor seizing him.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two gusts of evil wind attacked from behind, the Azure-scaled Serpent and the Black Roc.</p><p>The two demons saw that Qin Sang had abandoned his escape and remained motionless, seemingly stunned by the events in the Thunder City.</p><p>They knew that the situation in the lower realms must have changed, yet they were desperate for a gamble.</p><p>The Celestial Inspection Chariot beneath Qin Sang was perhaps their only hope.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the two demons moved, the Thunder God appeared, his target Qin Sang!</p><p>They were not far from Qin Sang, and as he felt the Thunder God’s presence, the God's oppressive might descended, striking them first.</p><p>The two demons were powerless to resist, like they were swatted, tumbling into the sea of clouds like rolling gourds, spraying blood, curling up, trembling all over, their hearts filled with terror.</p><p>Qin Sang was oblivious to what was happening behind him.</p><p>His mind was filled only with the roar of the thunder; he couldn't even hear the sounds around him.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Celestial Inspection Chariot was also struck.</p><p>The parts Qin Sang had repaired were damaged during the chase and were now severely broken.</p><p>Finally overwhelmed, cracks spread across the chariot, even more severe than before.</p><p>The golden dragon pulling the chariot, the moment the Thunder God's presence manifested, respectfully prostrated itself.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang still possessed reason and wanted to control the golden dragon, it was a futile wish.</p><p>‘Crack crack crack…’</p><p>The sounds of shattering continued, the golden dragon's body becoming increasingly ethereal, until finally, like a dream bubble, it shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang stood alone on the remnants of the chariot, unable to do anything.</p><p>He had cultivated the High Godly Xuan Thunder Jade Palace, and knew the sacred title of the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universalizing Heaven Venerable, the chief of the Thunder Gods, known as the Thunder God.</p><p>Coupled with his experiences and discoveries after entering the Divine Court, he guessed the origin of this thunderbolt.</p><p>“Could it be the Thunder God?”</p><p>“Who is performing the ritual to summon the Thunder God?”</p><p>Suddenly struck by this cataclysm, Qin Sang had countless questions, but the biggest question was only one.</p><p>“Why… me?”</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The thunderbolt, without deviation, struck Qin Sang’s head.</p><p>Where he stood, only blinding lightning could be seen, obscuring Qin Sang’s figure.</p><p>He seemed to have transformed into lightning.</p><p>Within him, a far more violent cataclysm raged than the one outside.</p><p>The Thunder God's power poured down upon him, how could his mere late-stage Nascent Divinity cultivation withstand such power?</p><p>Yet Qin Sang was powerless to resist, only allowing that terrifying power to flood into his body.</p><p>He felt no pain, because he was numb.</p><p>He felt like he had fallen into a sea of thunder, his body melting in the lightning, losing himself.</p><p>The Thunder God's power exceeded the limits of Qin Sang's perception, he had no idea what this power would bring.</p><p>However, the most terrifying change for Qin Sang came from his primordial spirit!</p><p>As the Thunder God's power poured in, his Purple Mansion suffered unimaginable impact.</p><p>All Qin Sang could do was protect his primordial spirit, praying that the one who summoned the God had left some leeway, that they could restrain this power, so he wouldn't explode and die.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after his millennia of cultivation, his Jade Buddha, which had always been as solid as gold, for the first time, trembled under the Thunder God’s assault!</p><p>Lightning illuminated the Purple Mansion.</p><p>Countless rays of lightning seemed to strike Qin Sang's primordial spirit; amidst the lightning, a faint Buddha light flickered uncertainly.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness roared, and he was horrified to ‘see’ the Buddha light surging on the surface of the Jade Buddha, the most violent fluctuations emanating from the broken arm.</p><p>The Jade Buddha was damaged in his previous life; it was a family heirloom, his ancestors were reluctant to discard it, and ultimately passed it down to Qin Sang.</p><p>After arriving in this world, knowing the Jade Buddha's power, Qin Sang always intended to explore its origins.</p><p>In the Central Plains of the Storm World, he had extensively studied Buddhist scriptures, with this in mind, but to no avail.</p><p>Even though the Jade Buddha had lost an arm, it seemed to have little impact, it had withstood the active summoning of heavenly demons, the crossing of the Nascent Divinity Heart Demon Tribulation, and the heavenly demonic sounds of the Storm World—all failing to shake the Jade Buddha; Qin Sang had almost forgotten that the Jade Buddha had a flaw.</p><p>Now, the Jade Buddha finally revealed its limits.</p><p>The flaw in the broken arm caused the Buddha light to become unstable, the impact transmitted to Qin Sang's primordial spirit, and for the first time in his thousand years of cultivation, Qin Sang experienced pain in his primordial spirit that was not self-inflicted!</p><p>It was as if his primordial spirit was being torn apart.</p><p>The pain was terrifying, but worse was the illusion that Qin Sang was experiencing.  He felt himself transformed into the true Lei Zu, the Thunder God, high above the heavens, supreme among all thunder.  </p><p>Boundless majesty, infinite power, overlooking all creation.</p><p>Invoking divine generals can grant power beyond one's own. Those with exceptional talent might even achieve enlightenment through this, but it's fraught with danger.  The feeling is intoxicating, but extremely perilous. Those lacking strong resolve risk losing their cultivation base and being destroyed. This is why Daoist cultivators place such importance on mental fortitude.</p><p>Fortunately, the jade Buddha continued to protect Qin Sang. Without it, the pain and mental trauma he suffered would have been far greater. He might have clung only to a sliver of consciousness in his primordial spirit, lost and unaware of life or death, barely surviving.  Even so, the shock was beyond comprehension for an ordinary person.</p><p>As a result, Qin Sang didn't notice the changes at the altar.  The position of the altar's guardian god, originally occupied by Qin Sang's inner energy, was now filled by a descending beam of lightning, revealing the shadowy form of a divine being – the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't believe he had summoned a guardian god at such a moment.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>Qin Sang involuntarily spread his arms, rising from the broken palanquin, his body slowly lifting.  Countless bolts of lightning danced around him, transforming into thunder dragons beneath his feet.  Thunder condensed into a thunder robe and an emperor's crown.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, clad in the thunder robe and crown, wielding heavenly thunder, soaring above the clouds, like the Thunder God descended to earth.  However, no statue of the Thunder God ever wore such a ferocious and pained expression.</p><p>"Aaah!"</p><p>Qin Sang finally let out an unrestrained cry, a mixture of anguish and the release of terrifying power.</p><p>The situation was somewhat better than anticipated. The power of the Thunder God hadn't instantly destroyed his body; it felt as if some unseen force was helping to contain it.  Nevertheless, Qin Sang couldn't control the power within him and still faced imminent danger.</p><p>He desperately needed to release it.  A talisman flashed in his mind – the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman! This was the highest-level, most powerful thunder talisman he had learned, capable of channeling the power of five thunderbolts.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang raised his right hand.  Whether this was his own will, driven by the Thunder God's power, or someone else's influence, even Qin Sang didn't know. It was a purely instinctive action.</p><p>In that moment.</p><p>The demonic gods in the Divine Court saw a thunder god.</p><p>A thunder god of unparalleled majesty, commanding the wind and thunder, wielding lightning as a whip, controlling the creation, and terrifying all living beings!  His index finger pointed to the heavens, a point of lightning emanating from its tip.  The lightning transformed into a bolt that shot towards the sky, like a droplet of concentrated thunder, finally exploding high above.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The lightning spread like ripples, branching into countless smaller bolts.  The lightning and ripples filled the heavens.</p><p>Outside the Divine Court, strange phenomena also appeared.</p><p>The Daoist court officials and the cultivators of Ju Mountain, the demonic cultivators of Guifang, the soldiers on the battlefields north and south, even the beasts of the Nieyuan and Niehai…</p><p>All living beings in this world sensed it and looked up.</p><p>Water-like threads of lightning filled the sky, spreading rapidly.  The twisting, shimmering threads resembled countless mysterious characters, forming a gigantic thunder talisman that unfolded in the heavens, encompassing the Daoist court but not yet reaching its limits.</p><p>Even the moonlight dimmed.</p><p>The seemingly delicate threads contained terrifying, violent power.  Once unleashed, all living beings beneath the heavenly thunder would be annihilated.</p><p>Ordinary people knelt and prayed.</p><p>Demon beasts cowered, their bodies trembling.</p><p>The ferocious beasts were also affected by the heavenly might, their instincts partially restored.  This was a more terrifying shock than the drumbeats.  The momentum of the beast tide immediately lessened.</p><p>Piercing howls echoed from the depths of the Nieyuan and Niehai.</p><p>In Guifang and the Grand Saint's Mansion, the demon kings held their drumsticks, staring blankly at the heavenly thunder, forgetting to beat their drums.</p><p>Only the Daoist cultivators showed excitement and awe.  Those in the Left and Right Thunder Palaces, especially those cultivating the High God Thunder-Heaven techniques, were moved to tears, unable to contain their emotion.</p><p>The Thunder Jade Palace, once comparable to the Heavenly Pivot Academy and the North Pole Exorcism Academy, had fallen into decline because they couldn't summon a guardian god.</p><p>How many years had passed?</p><p>At last, the Heavenly might of the Thunder Department was seen!  At last, the divine power of the Thunder God was seen!</p><p>The lightning threads stretched across the boundless sky, but the celestial phenomenon wasn't over.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>A series of muffled thunder sounds echoed from the heavens.  Soon, everyone realized that this wasn't thunder, but the resonance of the world's vital energy.  The night sky visibly distorted.</p><p>High above, the celestial energy was stirred by the silver thread, causing unrest.  A visible surge of spiritual energy appeared.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The surge roared, like a terrifying tidal wave threatening to tear the heavens apart.  Immense celestial energy frantically surged towards the center of the silver thread, the point of the ‘thunder drop’s’ eruption.</p><p>As the surge flowed, it merged with the silver thread, transforming into countless thunder dragons and lightning pythons.  Creatures on the ground could all see them.</p><p>Countless thunder dragons and lightning pythons raced across the sky, riding the surge, magnificent and awe-inspiring. The scene was as if eight directions' dragons were gathering, paying homage to the celestial court!</p><p>The point where the thunder dragons and lightning pythons converged was exactly where Qin Sang pointed.  Within the dazzling lightning, lightning glyphs formed, arranged in a specific pattern in the void.</p><p>The glyphs were as large as a bushel, together forming a divine talisman.  The talisman, outlined by thunder, resembled a thunder seal.</p><p>This seal, positioned in the center of the heavens, was like the seal of the heavenly heart—the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal!</p><p>The seal was square, majestic, and imposing.  Compared to this seal, the one Qin Sang had used before was merely a fragment, incomparable to this.</p><p>Qin Sang had been taught the Five Thunder Technique and continuously studied this talisman. However, the Five Thunder Technique was a third-order spell, spanning the Transcendence and Void Refinement realms. Before now, Qin Sang's understanding of the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal was less than half. Now, he had fully manifested it!</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning from a clear sky.  Heavenly thunder illuminated the world!  Creatures looking up felt a stabbing pain in their eyes; their vision was filled with blinding white, rendering them unable to see. For a moment, the world was as bright as day.</p><p>All creatures were terrified!</p><p>As the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal erupted, the silver thread had already pierced the Divine Court, locking onto its target and shooting towards the ninth heaven of Thunder City.  Before the silver thread even arrived, the celestial clouds of the ninth heaven could no longer maintain their stability.</p><p>At this moment, the silver thread seemed to sense something and abruptly stopped, hesitating for a moment before the power of the seal exploded.</p><p>The seal unleashed countless thunderbolts, each possessing the power to destroy the world, striking at the silver thread.  The silver thread swayed and flew back upwards, but it was too late. In an instant, the tip of the silver thread was swallowed by several thunderbolts.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The Divine Court shook violently.  A section at the tip of the silver thread was destroyed by the thunderbolts, and the remaining thread escaped at an even faster speed.</p><p>Clearly, the person manipulating the thread from the other side of the void was trying to withdraw it.  But the thunder relentlessly pursued it.</p><p>Section after section of the silver thread broke and was destroyed by the crisscrossing thunderbolts. Countless thunderbolts chased the silver thread, reaching the apex of the heavens, leaving a conspicuous trail, like a pillar of thunder coiled around the thread, connecting to the depths of the void.</p><p>Finally, the thunderbolts surged into the vortex in the void, the source of the silver thread, and without pause, gathered all their power and forcefully charged into the center of the vortex.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The void, already unstable after the divine ability manifested, showed various ominous signs and was about to tear apart.  The situation worsened; a violent storm erupted in the center of the vortex, the void roared, as if someone was screaming in rage.</p><p>…</p><p>The heavenly thunder faded.  But the shock the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal had given to all beings would remain deeply imprinted on their hearts.</p><p>…</p><p>White Stone's altar.</p><p>Kun Dao's body went limp, and she collapsed onto the altar, her face pale, her breath weak. She had been exerting herself to the utmost, sharing the burden and restraining the power of the Thunder Ancestor for Qin Sang.  Otherwise, Qin Sang alone couldn't have withstood the Thunder Ancestor's power; he would have exploded and died.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside and outside the Divine Court, all was silent.  Qin Sang hovered in mid-air, standing motionless.</p><p>“Huff…huff…huff!”</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes, breathing heavily, his chest rising and falling rapidly, still not recovering from the impact of the Thunder Ancestor’s power. His aura drastically weakened.  He had destroyed the silver thread with one strike, but that was all the power he had left.</p><p>In the great battle of that year, the Thunder Department suffered the most grievous losses. The Thunder Ancestor was severely damaged and, although nurtured in the Divine Court for countless years, still hadn't fully recovered.</p><p>Now, only Qin Sang remained within the Divine Court!  As for the Azure-Scaled Serpent, the Black Roc, and the demon gods in Thunder City, they had been shattered and destroyed by the thunder the moment it struck.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang’s eyelids trembled slightly, as if he was about to wake up.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Divine Court trembled violently again.  A sound no less powerful than the previous heavenly thunder echoed almost beside Qin Sang, instantly awakening him.</p><p>Qin Sang looked dazed, opened his eyes, then widened them again.  Before him, less than ten meters away, a gigantic palm print appeared in the void!</p><p>Countless cracks spread across the palm print.  It was as if someone outside the void had struck the Divine Court's barrier with a palm, shattering the void!</p><p>The area where the palm print struck turned dark red, the dark red light twisting and changing, like a pool formed from a mixture of mud and blood.  Heart-wrenching screams emanated from the blood pool, as if it was suffering unimaginable pain.</p><p>In an instant, a strange, illusory figure struggled out of the blood pool.  The figure's aura was weak, the pain on its face still evident, but its eyes blazed with intensity. Its gaze swept across the Divine Court, locking onto Qin Sang, and a cruel smile appeared.</p><p>“Hand over the Emperor Sword, and I will spare your life!” (End)</p>
