<h1>Chapter 712: Taking Advantage of the Situation</h1><p>Qin Sang, seeing this, dared not expose himself. He suppressed his aura and quietly fled south.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this demonic beast was incredibly fast.</p><p>This demonic beast was a demonic bird, its body huge, its feathers entirely black, and its body seemingly coated in black flames.  Its wings, when spread, were nearly thirty feet across, incredibly imposing.</p><p>With a slight flap of its wings, the demonic bird shot forward like a black streak.  In a few flickers, it rapidly closed the distance between itself and Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a growing anxiety. The noise from his talismans and sword-energy thunder sounds were impossible to hide, and without them, his escape speed was far too slow to put enough distance between them.</p><p>His worries quickly became reality. The demonic bird pressed closer. Suddenly, it seemed to sense something, turning its head south, its sharp gaze sweeping the area.</p><p>The vast sea was calm, seemingly empty. But the demonic bird's senses were exceptionally keen. A fierce light flashed in its eyes as it fixed its gaze on a point on the sea's surface.</p><p>The next moment, a figure shot out from there.</p><p>Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, sword-energy thunder…</p><p>Qin Sang used all his methods, pushing his speed to the limit.  A chill ran down his spine; the demonic bird was a late-stage Core Formation demon, and its senses were extremely sharp. He had been hiding motionless beneath the surface, suppressing his aura, yet he had still been discovered.</p><p>‘Lì!’</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's conspicuous escape, the demonic bird let out an angry shriek, immediately changing its course, its murderous intent blazing, pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>On the empty sea, two escaping lights chased each other, breaking the stillness of the night.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.  Fortunately, only this one demonic bird was pursuing him; it hadn’t alerted other demonic beasts.</p><p>At that moment, in the direction from which the transformed demon had flown...</p><p>Soaring demonic energy filled the air, blotting out the sun, a terrifying number of huge figures following one after another, making it impossible to see how many demons there were. If this many beasts were chasing him, Qin Sang would have despaired.</p><p>Moreover, the demonic bird's appearance and actions indicated that, while its physical body was exceptionally strong, it wasn't skilled in escape techniques. Its speed was slower than other demons of the same cultivation level, even slightly slower than Qin Sang.</p><p>However, easily escaping the demonic bird was a foolish dream.  A late-stage Core Formation demonic bird's endurance far exceeded Qin Sang's.  Even his combined Golden Core and Corpse Core couldn't compare. If he couldn't shake off his pursuer, Qin Sang would find himself in a difficult situation.</p><p>The demonic bird was relentlessly persistent.</p><p>Qin Sang could only blindly flee south, deliberately avoiding the snowy mountain where the Fire Sparrow nest was located, passing to the west.  In a hurried glance behind him, Qin Sang unexpectedly saw streams of blue light erupting from the mountaintop.</p><p>Vaguely, a Fire Sparrow, far larger than its kin, flew out from the blue light.</p><p>“Has this guy also been disturbed by the transformed demons?”</p><p>Qin Sang was certain this was the Fire Sparrow king, finally venturing out of its nest.</p><p>Unfortunately, the distance was too far to discern the demon's cultivation.  Being chased by the demonic bird, Qin Sang dared not approach, lest he be attacked by a large group of demons.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang hated the demonic bird even more, though he could only curse it in his heart.</p><p>The Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman and sword-energy thunder were incredibly draining.  He didn't know how far he'd escaped, but Qin Sang gradually felt his true energy reserves weakening, while the demonic bird behind him still relentlessly pursued him.</p><p>The demonic bird's cries were like the screech of an eagle, each one sharper than the last, grating on the nerves.</p><p>Its eyes blazed, clearly enraged by Qin Sang. It had thought to easily capture a small insect, yet this insect had escaped for so long, and was even getting farther away, filling it with furious frustration.</p><p>However, the demonic bird's satisfaction was short-lived.  Qin Sang's escaping light dimmed, then suddenly brightened, his true energy instantly restored to its peak, his speed unabated.</p><p>This was Qin Sang, seeing the situation turning unfavorable, unleashing his Corpse Core.</p><p>The demonic bird froze, feeling tricked, leaping with rage.</p><p>Hearing the furious cries behind him, Qin Sang felt no relief. He already held the Three Lights Jade Liquid in his hand.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>One person, one demon, raced through the air.</p><p>Under the silvery moonlight, a monstrous bird relentlessly pursued Qin Sang.  Demonic energy filled the air, its potent aura causing the sea beasts to tremble in fear, unwilling to surface—a small mercy for Qin Sang.</p><p>At this point, half the spiritual energy in his Corpse Pill was depleted.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back, seeing only a mass of darkness, from which two ferocious eyes glared, terrifyingly intense.</p><p>Then, to his surprise, the pursuing bird abruptly halted, cocked its head, and turned towards the northwest.  After a moment, it glared at Qin Sang, then abandoned the chase, spreading its wings and flying away in that direction.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang faintly hear a monstrous roar.</p><p>He hovered in mid-air, watching the bird disappear, his heart filled with suspicion and uncertainty.</p><p>The roar came from the direction the transformed demon had fled. Could it have been a summoning signal, forcing the bird to abandon its pursuit?</p><p>Regardless, he had escaped immediate danger.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh, the nearness of death still sending shivers down his spine. Any cultivator with slightly inferior escape techniques would have already perished.  The Demon Sea was truly a place of constant peril.</p><p>The thought that this incident might be connected to the Cold Flame, and that the Cold Flame's appearance was somehow linked to him, brought a wry smile to his face.</p><p>Certain the bird was gone, Qin Sang didn't dare linger. Choosing a direction, he quickly fled.</p><p>Finding a deserted island, he established a temporary dwelling.  Sitting on the ground, he focused on his cultivation, gradually replenishing his nearly depleted spiritual energy.</p><p>By the time he reached full strength it was already dawn.  Awakening from meditation, Qin Sang reflected on the previous night's events.</p><p>"Were all those sea beasts summoned by that transformed demon?  Why summon so many for a single Cold Flame?  Could it be…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, a suspicion forming.</p><p>"Has the Cold Flame alerted the island master of Huntian Island? Is the transformed demon vying for it with the island master? Either way, this place will become chaotic soon. I can't stay. Both paths back are blocked; I must continue south.  I don't know how long it will take them to return. Time is short. I need to obtain the Wan Shi Chang before then…"</p><p>Qin Sang stood abruptly, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>If his guess was correct, even the king of the firebirds wouldn't dare disobey the transformed demon's orders.  Last night, it was likely summoned and forced to leave its nest.  It might have followed the transformed demon, which presented the perfect opportunity.</p>
