<h1>Chapter 2129: Divine Mountain</h1><p>Great Mercy Zen Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped out of the Shifting Formation and immediately sensed the oppressive atmosphere shrouding the temple.</p><p>Flying into the air, the scene of the battlefield unfolded before his eyes.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor personally led the army, charging forward with a ferocious momentum. Under the impact of this overwhelming power, the curtain of rain seemed to stagnate.</p><p>The Thunder Altar had already been activated and was ready to unleash its power.</p><p>In the battle at Moon's Embrace Bay, he had personally intervened, masking Patriarch Minghu's perception, because activating the Thunder Altar took time. Before it could truly unleash its power, Minghu might have escaped.</p><p>The new Thunder Altar was incomparable to its predecessor, both in power and activation speed, but because of the Siyou Clan's unique abilities and their life-saving treasures, he still had to come in person.</p><p>'哗啦啦……'</p><p>The incessant sound of torrential rain filled the air.</p><p>Under the gloomy sky, the Grand Preceptor's eyes shone brightly and intimidatingly, his divine gaze piercing like lightning, seemingly capable of penetrating the rain.</p><p>He didn't conceal his presence, standing majestically at the front of the army, with thousands of troops behind him!</p><p>Qin Sang spotted him at a glance, his expression slightly darkening as his figure quietly merged into the rain.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Lu King's army approached the rain curtain. The Grand Preceptor, with an imposing posture, charged into it without hesitation.</p><p>'哗！  '</p><p>The downpour was like a gigantic maw of the abyss.</p><p>Upon entering the rain curtain, the familiar scene reappeared. Countless shadows stood silently in the rain, awaiting them.</p><p>The figures were densely packed, stretching as far as the eye could see, yet utterly silent, giving off an eerie feeling.</p><p>These were the Thunder Soldiers, their old adversaries. However, this time, they came prepared.</p><p>Before the close-quarters combat began, wisps of cloud qi rose from within the Lu King's army. They were still employing that formation, only the position of the formation eye had been replaced by a Siyou Clan expert. But with the experience from last time, they could now respond with precision, ensuring the safety of the formation eye.</p><p>The cloud qi stretched continuously, drifting towards the sky, and the rain suddenly weakened.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor searched for a moment but couldn't find any trace of Qin Sang and his companions. Without further hesitation, he ordered the army to attack.</p><p>'轰！  '</p><p>The two armies clashed abruptly, creating an earth-shattering roar.</p><p>The cloud qi moved with the cultivators, and the flow of the cloud qi revealed the distribution of the Lu King's forces.</p><p>Like sharp blades, they pierced into the ranks of the Thunder Soldiers, unstoppable. In the blink of an eye, countless Thunder Soldiers fell.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor, who had been constantly scanning the surroundings, searching for Qin Sang and the others, seemed to sense something, his expression shifting slightly. But he was immediately drawn to an anomaly elsewhere.</p><p>Qin Sang, Frost Marten, the Stone Statue, and the Fire Spirit appeared simultaneously, charging into the battlefield from four directions, just like last time.</p><p>Apart from Qin Sang, the Frost Marten, Stone Statue, and Fire Spirit possessed average strength, mainly serving as distractions before. The Grand Preceptor immediately dispatched men to confront them and secretly transmitted a message to Li Yue, ordering him to intercept Qin Sang.</p><p>Last time, Li Yue fought Qin Sang alone and was trapped in the sword formation from the start, his cultivation rendered useless as he struck only empty space.</p><p>This time, with the Grand Preceptor present, Li Yue vowed to avenge his previous defeat. He immediately summoned his companion beast, donned his spirit armor, and stepped forward.</p><p>At the same time, the Grand Preceptor flipped his palm and summoned a Six Harmonies Decree. The other Siyou Clan experts also summoned this treasure. The decrees hovered in the air, spinning continuously, adapting to the situation, preventing the Five Elements Crown from activating.</p><p>'轰隆！  '</p><p>As Li Yue moved, his momentum was like a landslide, shaking the void, his power surpassing Qin Sang's.</p><p>A sword's clang rang out.</p><p>Just like last time, Qin Sang began with a sword beam, the Gray Warbler Sword slashing towards Li Yue in mid-air.</p><p>Li Yue responded as he did before, attempting to withstand the spirit sword with his physical body, seemingly forgetting the previous lesson.</p><p>As he wished, the sword light flickered in mid-air, then the spirit sword vanished, and the void instantly became incredibly silent as the sword formation unfolded, instantly trapping Li Yue within.</p><p>As he succeeded, Qin Sang suddenly heard a dog's howl. His gaze sharpened as he looked behind Li Yue. He saw two black-furred spirit hounds, which hadn't been there before, now flanking the Grand Preceptor.</p><p>The hounds had short, fine fur, long wedge-shaped heads, deep chests, slender waists, and long, slender limbs, straight in the front and curved in the back.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the two spirit hounds were the Grand Preceptor's companion beasts.</p><p>They raised their heads and howled towards the sky. The howls were long and piercing, capable of penetrating the clouds.</p><p>Moments later, a faint light poured into the battlefield, and a circular spot of light appeared in the sky, gradually brightening, like a full moon hanging on the horizon.</p><p>Spirit Hounds Howling at the Moon!</p><p>A beam of light shot down from the 'full moon' and landed within the sword formation.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang faintly sensed a connection forming between Li Yue within the formation and the 'full moon'. Knowing something was amiss, he constantly shifted the formation, but couldn't sever the link.</p><p>Li Yue, trapped within the sword formation and faced with the vast starry sky, was initially bewildered. After all, their last encounter was too brief, and he hadn't yet figured out a way to break the formation.</p><p>But when the 'full moon' appeared, his bewilderment quickly vanished, as if he had received some kind of guidance.  Li Yue abruptly turned his head, his gaze sharp as a blade, locking onto a specific star within the formation. Then, he charged forward like a raging bull, his momentum astonishing.</p><p>Li Yue's own cultivation was considerable, and with the Grand Preceptor's assistance, if he were allowed to rampage within the sword formation, he might actually break it.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Grand Preceptor.  This man still wanted to remotely control the battlefield. However, he wouldn't let him have his way.</p><p>Just then, the sensation the Grand Preceptor felt earlier returned. He realized the situation on the battlefield was somewhat unexpected. These Thunder Soldiers had become significantly weaker, showing signs of defeat after a brief clash.</p><p>Although they were well-prepared, the effect shouldn't have been so immediate.</p><p>“Are they planning to abandon Great Mercy Zen Temple?”</p><p>In fact, after Qin Sang activated the Thunder Summoning Oath but kept it concealed, all the altar masters were under immense pressure. The longer the Thunder Talismans remained inactive, the greater the pressure they felt.</p><p>At this moment, including Su Nu and the other two, none dared to be distracted. The Nine Heavens Azure Pond Thunder Rain Great Art was currently fueled by the residual power Qin Sang had activated earlier. Every bit consumed was a bit lost. Without the cooperation of the altar masters, many variations couldn't be employed, hence the seemingly unstoppable advance of the Lu King's army.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor noticed this, but before he could ponder it further, he was startled by the sound of thunder.</p><p>The Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal followed his will, thunder covering the sky, transforming into a thunder seal.  Terrifying thunderous power pierced through the void, striking at Li Yue within the formation.</p><p>This strike was almost Qin Sang's full power.  Even someone as strong as Li Yue would be in grave danger if he couldn't dodge in time.</p><p>However, the Grand Preceptor wouldn't let Qin Sang succeed so easily. A golden light immediately shot out from his sleeve.</p><p>This time, he was fully prepared, holding nothing back. The Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock unleashed its full power, an obscure ripple spreading with the golden light.</p><p>Almost all the Refinement Void realm experts on the battlefield were drawn to this ripple, for it was the power they had been tirelessly pursuing—Domain power! Only Qin Sang could discern that it was still far from a true Domain.</p><p>Despite this, the Grand Preceptor's ability to manifest a Pseudo-Domain with the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock placed him among the top experts of his realm.</p><p>The Pseudo-Domain enveloped the battlefield, causing the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal to dim.  Previously, even if it wouldn't be completely extinguished by the Pseudo-Domain, the thunderous power would become extremely sluggish.</p><p>But after forging the Thunder Altar, Qin Sang had gained significantly, pushing the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal to its limits, granting it power beyond his own cultivation level.</p><p>'轰隆隆……'</p><p>The thunder rumbled incessantly.</p><p>Amidst the golden light, azure lightning bolts, like sharp arrows, streaked across the sky, attempting to pierce through the Pseudo-Domain.</p><p>The Grand Preceptor's expression turned grave. The thunderous might exceeded his expectations. He hurriedly chanted incantations, the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock emitting clicking sounds as golden tides surged within the Pseudo-Domain.</p><p>Just as the Thunder Seal clashed with the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock, the Grand Preceptor suddenly sensed something amiss and abruptly looked towards the sword formation.</p><p>Through his two spirit hound companion beasts and the 'full moon', he had established a connection with Li Yue, allowing him to faintly perceive the changes in Li Yue.</p><p>At this moment, the feeling transmitted from Li Yue was actually—fear!</p><p>Li Yue, at the second stage of the Void Inquiry realm, with three companion beasts possessing him, facing an opponent of the same realm, an opponent he was currently holding back, why would he feel fear?</p><p>Within the sword formation.</p><p>Li Yue sprinted through the starry sky, swinging his fists, shattering one star after another, incredibly powerful and unstoppable, the sword formation seemingly ineffective against him.</p><p>But just as the situation seemed favorable, the myriad stars suddenly trembled, starlight converging into the White Tiger Sha and Vermillion Bird Sha, which lunged at Li Yue together.</p><p>Li Yue stopped, bracing himself, then sensed something unusual. As the Sha attacked, the formation seemed to have undergone a transformation, the starry sky becoming unfamiliar.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Li Yue's expression changed drastically, a flicker of terror in his eyes.</p><p>Sword Domain!</p><p>He had personally witnessed the Grand Preceptor manifest a Pseudo-Domain with the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock, but the aura of this Sword Domain felt more real, a true Domain!</p><p>Li Yue considered himself to have extraordinary abilities, but he didn't believe he could stand a chance against a Sword Domain. His opponent, clearly of the same realm, had actually comprehended a Domain.</p><p>At the same time, the Grand Preceptor outside also sensed the aura of the Sword Domain.</p><p>Li Yue was a crucial general and couldn't be abandoned. The Grand Preceptor raised his right hand, a treasure vase resting on his palm. The vase had a narrow mouth and a round belly, its body shimmering with light, becoming transparent in his hand.</p><p>Inside the vase, there was nothing but a sphere of light, fluctuating in brightness, emitting two dazzling white beams.</p><p>The two beams intersected in a cross shape with the vase as the center. The white cross rapidly rotated, suddenly transforming into a giant wheel of light, which tilted and sliced into the sword formation at high speed.</p><p>Just then, the Grand Preceptor's eyes flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang had previously imitated a trace of Domain aura, scaring Gu Yun Sou and Patriarch Minghu out of their wits, but the Grand Preceptor had broader horizons, having witnessed true Domains and being able to manifest a Pseudo-Domain himself.</p><p>“All show, no substance!”</p><p>The Grand Preceptor sneered, yet he was also extremely astonished.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang's Sword Domain was merely an illusion, the fact that he could manifest it proved he had grasped a sliver of its essence. Any late-stage expert would be envious upon hearing this. The Grand Preceptor was no exception, and a killing intent arose within him.</p><p>He even began to doubt whether provoking this individual had been a wise decision. However, the Mist Sea ultimately belonged to the Heterodox Cultivators, and outsiders couldn't stir up any significant trouble.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, the light wheel collided with the sword formation.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's figure appeared within the sword formation.  Ignoring the light wheel beside him, he looked at the Grand Preceptor, murmuring, “This distance… is just right.”</p><p>In the next moment, a crystal pagoda flew out from his chest.</p><p>A three-tiered pagoda—the Void Severing Spirit Pagoda!</p><p>Upon seeing the Void Severing Spirit Pagoda, the Grand Preceptor's expression froze, a sense of danger abruptly arising in his heart.</p><p>'咔嚓！  '</p><p>'啪！  '</p><p>The Void Severing Spirit Pagoda exploded, fragments flying in all directions, continuing to shatter into the finest dust, scattering with the wind.</p><p>The Void Severing Spirit Pagoda was undoubtedly the ultimate weapon against the Siyou Clan.  Unfortunately, it was extremely difficult to refine and had a limited number of uses.  With careful calculation, it could be used three times at most.</p><p>To ensure absolute success, Qin Sang held nothing back, completely unleashing the power of the Void Severing Spirit Pagoda.</p><p>An invisible, hidden power spread with the dust, permeating the battlefield.</p><p>At the same moment, all the altars within the Storm Realm activated simultaneously, cultivators pacing in ritualistic steps, their resounding chants shaking the heavens and earth!</p><p>…</p><p>Tainted Lands.</p><p>The Azure Phoenix manifestation followed Min Zhuo into the source of the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>As if passing through a barrier, the seawater vanished ahead, and a deep, dark abyss appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, recalling the scene of the Returning Ruin he had witnessed before. That place was also an abyss, where seawater cascaded down, forming a waterfall.</p><p>However, the Returning Ruin was vibrant and filled with strange sights, while this abyss was pitch black.</p><p>Qin Sang lost track of Min Zhuo, but he wasn't worried.  Entering the abyss, the tremors became increasingly clear. Following the source of the tremors would lead him to his target.</p><p>He flapped his wings, flying towards the depths of the abyss, feeling the mounting pressure.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang encountered his first obstacle—a damaged ancient restriction.</p><p>Although broken, the fluctuations emanating from the ancient restriction indicated its considerable power.</p><p>Qin Sang studied it for a moment, carefully passing through the gaps in the restriction.  After traveling a short distance, he encountered another ancient restriction.</p><p>He had heard Mo Xing Dao recount his experiences in the Returning Ruin, which was also riddled with ancient restrictions and dangers.</p><p>“Could this truly be the transformed Returning Ruin, or perhaps a fragment left behind?”</p><p>As this thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, he suddenly noticed a glimmer of azure light—a wisp of Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>The ancient restrictions here didn't harm it. The Azure Spirit Qi moved as if there were no obstacles. Qin Sang captured it from afar, observed it for a moment, then released it, choosing not to collect it.</p><p>Continuing onward, drawing closer to the source of the tremors, Qin Sang finally found traces of Min Zhuo.</p><p>Because Qin Sang and Min Zhuo hadn't taken the same path, the warning measures Min Zhuo left behind hadn't been triggered, leaving him completely unaware of the pursuer closing in.</p><p>'轰！  '</p><p>The tremor came clearly from just ahead.</p><p>Min Zhuo could no longer contain his excitement. He abruptly increased his speed, and moments later, dots of azure light appeared in the darkness ahead.</p><p>Several wisps of Azure Spirit Qi brushed past him, but Min Zhuo ignored them, his gaze fixed on the end of the darkness.</p><p>There, within a mass of dense azure light, stood a divine mountain, towering amidst the darkness, captivating Min Zhuo's attention.</p><p>This mountain was devoid of vegetation, a stone mountain, its peaks lofty and perilous, jagged and rugged. The cliffs and rocks were all a deep azure, appearing incredibly heavy, yet it floated in the void.</p><p>The mountain trembled, as if struggling to break free from some kind of restraint, to escape the abyss and reappear in the world.</p><p>With each tremor, the azure light brightened, revealing a fissure that almost split the mountain in two. This was the source of the azure light, the source of the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>Facing this mountain, a sense of awe rose within Min Zhuo, his eyes filled with greed.</p>
