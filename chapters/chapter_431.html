<h1>Chapter 424: The Arranged Meeting</h1><p>Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Qin Sang landed at the mountain gate on his cloud, noticing that the gate's protective formation was partially active. Several squads of Shaohua disciples patrolled the area.</p><p>Mount Shaohua, being the closest major sect in the Xiaohan Domain to the vast Cloudsea Marsh, was a prominent target.</p><p>Should conflict erupt, Shaohua would undoubtedly be on the front lines, necessitating their vigilance.</p><p>Rumors circulated that many marketplaces near Cloudsea Marsh, including the Moonlit Market, had closed. Those remaining operated under strict security, scrutinizing anyone entering or leaving.</p><p>The precarious situation was evident.</p><p>"Welcome, Elder Qin!"</p><p>Qin Sang presented his identification. After verifying his identity, the patrolling disciples respectfully bowed and allowed him entry.</p><p>Before entering, Qin Sang flew higher to survey the surroundings.</p><p>The endless expanse of Cloudsea Marsh shimmered under the sunlight, a scene of breathtaking beauty. This deceptive tranquility masked underlying currents, threatening to erupt into a bloody battlefield that could consume countless cultivators.</p><p>Parting the clouds, Qin Sang flew into his sect, landing on Dao Gate Peak and encountering Zhuang Yan.</p><p>"Congratulations on your marriage, Brother Zhuang! Forgive my belated well wishes," Qin Sang greeted with a cheerful bow.</p><p>Years had passed, and Zhuang Yan had reached the middle stage of Foundation Establishment. Considering his age, his cultivation progress was considered slow.</p><p>If Zhuang Yan couldn't soon break through to the late stage, he'd have little time to prepare for Core Formation once he reached the pseudo-Core Formation realm due to his limited lifespan.</p><p>This meant his chances of forming a core were slim.</p><p>Elder Wen had returned to his homeland for retirement, leaving Zhuang Yan to take over as head of Dao Gate Peak.</p><p>A decade ago, Zhuang Yan had married a fellow disciple named Xiao Qiuyue. Unable to return for the ceremony, Qin Sang had sent a pair of spiritual swords as a wedding gift.</p><p>Zhuang Yan pulled Qin Sang down to sit, sighing, "Brother Qin, after decades apart, your first words upon returning are to tease me.  Be careful or I'll throw you out!"</p><p>Qin Sang sat opposite him, perplexed. "What are you saying, Brother Zhuang? I offer sincere congratulations. How is that teasing? Where is Sister Xiao? I've yet to meet her. Did she like the Auspicious Union Swords?"</p><p>"With the quality of your gift, she must have liked them."</p><p>Zhuang Yan sighed. "Unfortunately, 'Auspicious Union' is not a fitting description for us. We're unworthy of the name."</p><p>Seeing Zhuang Yan's genuine expression, Qin Sang's smile faded. "I heard Sister Xiao is a renowned beauty in our sect, quite the prominent figure. What could you possibly be dissatisfied with?"</p><p>"Brother, have you ever lived among mortals?"</p><p>Zhuang Yan wore a distressed expression. "Mortal men and women, when they marry, engage in a custom called 'arranging a meeting.' By the will of their parents and the words of a matchmaker, two strangers are forced together. How much true affection can there be? They merely endure, barely making do."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, *Brother, if you only knew how many single people nearing thirty yearn for the guidance of their parents and a matchmaker, a wish they can't fulfill.*</p><p>*You're too young to understand the benefits of arranged meetings.*</p><p>"Did Elder Wen force you into this?"</p><p>Zhuang Yan's "yes" was barely audible. "Not exactly..."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, recognizing the evasion. Cultivators forming partnerships differed from mortal marriages, free from the pressures of societal norms and not intended for procreation.</p><p>Elder Wen wouldn't have forced Zhuang Yan if he hadn't agreed.</p><p>"Brother, you're over a hundred years old. Surely you see through such matters. Do you still expect true love to fall into your lap?  Have you forgotten Elder Ma Wu's advice when he sought a dual cultivation partner and spoke to me?  Don't tell me you're now blinded by your situation within these mountain walls?"</p><p>"Even without true love, you can't... you can't..."</p><p>Zhuang Yan scratched his head, stammering, then glanced around before leaning closer to Qin Sang and whispering, "Brother Qin, do you know her reason for marrying me is because my constitution is best suited for cultivating the *Yin-Yang Harmony Scripture* with her?"</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with the *Yin-Yang Harmony Scripture*.</p><p>It was one of Shaohua's most treasured dual cultivation techniques, unlike the *Mysteries of the Jade Cauldron*. It was a righteous Daoist practice where both man and woman cultivated the Dao of Yin and Yang, harmless to either party.</p><p>The technique was said to have specific requirements for practitioners, but upon successful cultivation, the man and woman, through dual cultivation, would reap significant benefits.</p><p>Senior Sister Qingting and Senior Brother Jiang practiced the *Yin-Yang Harmony Scripture*.</p><p>Zhuang Yan's revelation didn't surprise Qin Sang.</p><p>He countered, "Brother Zhuang, didn't you agree to dual cultivate with the same purpose in mind?"</p><p>"Yes! Indeed!"  Zhuang Yan didn't deny it.</p><p>"But, Brother Qin, you don't understand.  The *Yin-Yang Harmony Scripture* yields the best results when both cultivators have similar cultivation levels.</p><p>"If one of us breaks through to the late Foundation Establishment stage first, the other can still benefit, but for the one who broke through, the technique becomes less effective, unless the other also advances.</p><p>"She spoke to me frankly a while ago.</p><p>"She said that if I reach the late stage before her, she'll withdraw and seek another partner, refusing to hinder me. If she breaks through first, she hopes I'll do the same...</p><p>"What... what is this!"</p><p>Qin Sang watched Zhuang Yan cradle his head, his voice heavy, and shook his head slightly.</p><p>He agreed with Sister Xiao's reasoning, but seeing Zhuang Yan's state, he held back some words.</p><p>"Perhaps with time, Brother Zhuang, have you fallen for Sister Xiao?"</p><p>Qin Sang's words were startling.</p><p>Zhuang Yan froze.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood. He spoke softly, "Brother Zhuang, we cultivators seek immortality and the Dao, ultimately for freedom. Ask yourself, what do you truly desire? If it's longevity, then choices must be made, why torment yourself?  If it's Sister Xiao... surely you can at least speak your mind?"</p><p>Just then, a message talisman flew into the hall.</p><p>Zhuang Yan received it, glanced at the sky, and abruptly stood.  "It's time for cultivation. Brother Qin, you've just returned, you must have much to attend to. I'll invite you for drinks tomorrow."</p><p>"Go ahead, Brother Zhuang."</p><p>Qin Sang saw Zhuang Yan off.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after flying a short distance, Zhuang Yan hurriedly returned and tossed a token to Qin Sang. "Brother Qin, the outer caves aren't safe, and you don't have a place to stay within the sect. I'm not using this cave at the moment, take it."</p><p>Qin Sang caught the token, watching Zhuang Yan's light disappear into the depths of the mountain. He lowered his head, lost in thought.</p><p>After a long while, he chuckled softly and, summoning his Nethercloud, flew towards the main peak.</p>
