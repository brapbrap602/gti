<h1>Chapter 1169: Resolution</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist's spiritual perception is indeed sharp. I was barely approaching when you detected me."</p><p>On the mountain peak, a faint ripple stirred in the void. A figure gradually solidified from its ethereal form.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted slightly. The figure had a human body and a serpent's tail—it was none other than the Serpent King, whom he had just parted ways with at the Feather King's Palace.</p><p>The Serpent King, having been discovered by Qin Sang, remained composed, even wearing a faint smile. His figure flickered as he descended the mountain, arriving before Qin Sang.</p><p>The plump chicken and the white crane beside Qin Sang bristled, not daring to make a sound. The Serpent King made no effort to conceal his cultivation, and the oppressive aura of a mid-stage transformed demon caused the two birds to tremble.</p><p>"So, it is the Serpent King who graces us with his presence!" Qin Sang shielded the two birds from the demon king's pressure, his tone laced with sarcasm to express his displeasure.</p><p>"I believe we first met at the Feather King's Palace, correct?"</p><p>"Indeed," the Serpent King nodded. "Though we met at the Feather King's Palace, I had long heard of Daoist Mingyue. It was said that Daoist Bamboo had nurtured an extraordinary successor."</p><p>Qin Sang was not swayed by the Serpent King's seemingly flattering words. He replied coldly, "I dare not accept such praise! I, on the other hand, have long admired the Serpent King's reputation. Might I ask what business you have with me? You did not bring it up at the Feather King's Palace, yet you chose to follow me in secret. Fortunately, my spiritual perception is somewhat sharp. Were you perhaps waiting until we were far from the Ten Thousand Demons City to make your move?"</p><p>"The Feather King's Palace was crowded, and some matters are indeed difficult to discuss in front of other fellow Daoists. As for Daoist Mingyue's concerns..." The Serpent King's lips curled into a mocking smile. "My actions are merely an imitation of your past deeds. If you could do it, why can't we?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.</p><p>Not long after leaving the city, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had alerted him, and Qin Sang had detected the Serpent King's presence. Although the Serpent King was at the mid-stage of transformation, one level higher in cultivation, it was nearly impossible for him to follow Qin Sang without being detected. Under the power of the Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, unless one possessed the most advanced concealment techniques, all would be revealed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, flying for a while before confirming that the one following him was indeed the Serpent King. He realized that his theft from the Qianji Demon King's cave might have been exposed. The Serpent King was the father-in-law of the Qianji Demon King. Apart from this, Qin Sang could think of no other reason for the Serpent King to follow him.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang decided to stop here and directly expose the Serpent King's presence. This place was not far from the Ten Thousand Demons City, and the major demon kings had not been gone for long. With the Feather Demon King still presiding over the city, the Serpent King would have to exercise some caution.</p><p>Qin Sang was not afraid of the Serpent King. During his time of secluded cultivation at the Yuan Shen Sect, Qin Sang had not neglected his training in the "Heavenly Demon Transformation." He had now fully mastered the Azure Phoenix Wings on his back, greatly enhancing his escape techniques.</p><p>Facing a renowned figure like the Feather Demon King, who possessed a great legacy, Qin Sang would still feel some apprehension. After all, using the Thunder Escape required the power of thunder generated by the Azure Phoenix Wings. Qin Sang had deliberately tested this; limited by his realm, the thunder power he could control had its limits. Once exhausted, it could only slowly recover, so it was best not to put himself in such a situation.</p><p>However, escaping from the Serpent King was not difficult. Yet, this karmic entanglement would need to be resolved sooner or later. If the enmity could be peacefully resolved, that would be for the best. Qin Sang did not want to be constantly watched by this pair of transformed demon father-in-law and son-in-law, always worrying about ambushes and feeling restrained in his actions, which might also implicate the demons of the Thousand Bamboo Sea.</p><p>As Qin Sang had expected, after the Serpent King finished speaking, he suddenly flicked his finger, sending a streak of light into the sky. Moments later, the sound of something cutting through the air could be heard from afar.</p><p>A streak of light flew over. Qin Sang sensed a familiar aura—it was the Qianji Demon King. Behind the Qianji Demon King followed a cloud of demonic energy, the subordinates of the two demon kings.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang frowned slightly, unsure of their intentions. The Qianji Demon King had also come, yet he had not shown himself at the Feather King's Palace. Had he been waiting outside the city to intercept him? But bringing only a few minor demons would only make it easier to expose their tracks and be detected by him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Qianji Demon King flew to the Serpent King's side, glaring coldly at Qin Sang with a hostile expression.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue once visited my son-in-law's cave. Surely you recognize him?" the Serpent King said meaningfully.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat curious. "When did the two of you trace this back to me?"</p><p>"Though you made various attempts to conceal yourself—first hiding your cultivation, then deliberately using human sword techniques—the fact that you could subdue a fourth-stage spirit insect and easily shake off Qianji is not something an ordinary person could achieve," the Serpent King shook his head. "After Qianji obtained the stone slab, he even kept it hidden from me. How could others know? The person who competed with Qianji for the slab only recognized it as a demonic treasure and did not witness the Azure Phoenix's phantom. The only explanation is a bloodline ability. The other fellow Daoists have been famous for many years, and I have some understanding of their abilities and bloodlines. Only Daoist Mingyue is a new face, a newly transformed demon with no known background. I boldly speculated that you must be a rare descendant of the Azure Phoenix to sense the aura of the Azure Phoenix's phantom."</p><p>"Indeed, it was me," Qin Sang admitted straightforwardly. Since he had been exposed, there was no need for further concealment.</p><p>The Serpent King had mistaken the cause and effect. It was not that Qin Sang had the Azure Phoenix bloodline, but that someone had discovered the Azure Phoenix's phantom before the Qianji Demon King's competition. However, this misunderstanding was not a bad thing for Qin Sang.</p><p>"You have the nerve to admit it! Why aren't you running today?" the Qianji Demon King sneered.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he glanced at the late-arriving demon king's subordinates. "After all, I was in the wrong first. Since the two of you have come to find me, why keep hiding? Sooner or later, we will have to settle this. How do you two plan to resolve this? Going to such lengths, do you think you can keep us here?"</p><p>The Qianji Demon King angrily retorted, "You arrogant thief! Do you really think I can't kill you?"</p><p>The Serpent King restrained the Qianji Demon King and said in a deep voice, "I know that Daoist Mingyue is the successor of Daoist Bamboo, and your escape techniques are so advanced that Qianji cannot hope to match them. That gives you the confidence to speak so boldly. Even if you are not afraid, what about the members of the Thousand Bamboo Sea? Can you truly bear the consequences of starting a war? Daoist Bamboo has been in seclusion for hundreds of years. Is there something to that? I have always advocated for harmony, but my hands have never been free of blood."</p><p>After the threat, the Serpent King paused, then softened his tone.</p><p>"Do you think that if we truly had any ill intentions, we would be so foolish as to mobilize troops for an ambush, especially near the Ten Thousand Demons City, where the Feather King and other fellow Daoists could easily see?</p><p>"The stone slab is indeed a rare treasure, but now we know that only those with the Azure Phoenix bloodline can control it. It seems that in your hands, it has found its proper use.</p><p>"Earlier at the Feather King's Palace, it was I who brought it up, and the fellow Daoists have already reached a consensus to explore the Purple Palace together in the future. As long as it is not a blood feud, it can be resolved.</p><p>"The stone slab has already shattered, and the Azure Phoenix's power sealed within has been refined by you. What's done is done. We cannot ask you to spit it out..."</p><p>The Qianji Demon King snorted but did not stop the Serpent King.</p>
