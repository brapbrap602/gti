<h1>Chapter 647: The Obedient One</h1><p>Qin Sang was preparing to teach it a lesson.</p><p>This fellow was lazy and gluttonous, never learning from its mistakes. Ordinary methods were useless; it would forget everything in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang held a Demonic Fire Needle in one hand, while his other hand formed a cage of true essence, trapping the fat silkworm.</p><p>Perhaps sensing the aura of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, the silkworm became agitated as soon as it emerged from its basket.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately brought the needle closer. The silkworm recoiled desperately, attempting to flee, but it was trapped by the cage of true essence. Its almost invisible eyes were filled with terror, emitting sharp hissing sounds.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was surprisingly effective. The silkworm was more afraid than if it had encountered a natural predator, utterly terrified.</p><p>Qin Sang remained indifferent, his gaze icy as the needle drew nearer.</p><p>Suddenly, the silkworm stiffened and stopped moving.</p><p>It had actually fainted from fright.</p><p>“Scared to death? Such a useless thing, it’s even more useless dead. Might as well burn it,” Qin Sang muttered. With a flick of his finger, a wisp of Nine Nether Demonic Fire shot towards the silkworm.</p><p>A shriek pierced the air as the silkworm sprang up, desperately fleeing. It had been playing dead! However, confined within the cage, its speed was no match for the Demonic Fire, and it was instantly engulfed.</p><p>The silkworm’s eyes rolled back. This time, it had truly fainted, drooling or perhaps crying, leaving a puddle behind.</p><p>A smile played on Qin Sang’s lips. He transformed the Demonic Fire into chains, binding the silkworm.</p><p>A short while later, the silkworm awoke. Before it could rejoice, it noticed the Demonic Fire chains and fainted again.</p><p>After several repetitions of this ordeal, the silkworm finally became numb.</p><p>Now, its gaze towards Qin Sang had changed. It looked at him as if he were a great demon, filled with fear, trembling pitifully.</p><p>If it had higher intelligence, it might have regretted boarding this thief's ship.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't withdraw the Demonic Fire, keeping it bound with the fiery chains. He then took out a berry, squeezed some juice in front of the silkworm, and stared at it with an icy gaze.</p><p>This berry was a spirit fruit, very suitable for feeding spirit insects, especially during their first transformation. It could accelerate their growth and fetched a high price in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang had taken some from the Five Insects Sect.</p><p>Previously, when he offered it to the silkworm, it had disdained it. Now, without any prompting, it devoured the juice with relish.</p><p>“Eat your fill and go back to sleep!” Qin Sang said, deeply moved by the tears of gratitude welling up in the silkworm’s eyes.</p><p>The silkworm crawled back into its basket after eating, finally quiet.</p><p>Having dealt with the silkworm, Qin Sang set off again, arriving at the entrance of Butterfly Valley.</p><p>At this time of year, the climate of the Wu God Continent had turned cold, but Butterfly Valley remained warm and spring-like, filled with the songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers.</p><p>The beauty of this place truly lived up to its reputation. A blanket of flowers covered the valley, with several clear streams winding through it. Bees and butterflies danced around the blossoms.</p><p>Qin Sang admired the scenery, then contemplated the thousands of butterflies.</p><p>Skyeye Butterflies were extremely timid. Any disturbance would frighten them back into their nests. Things that tempted other spirit insects were useless against them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush in. He quietly circled the valley, but found nothing unusual. Every butterfly seemed ordinary.</p><p>Even if he caught every butterfly in the valley, it would be useless. The Skyeye Butterfly's camouflage was too good to discern. If it weren't for the Redfire Liquid Gold, Qin Sang wouldn't have known how to lure it out.</p><p>Fearing that the corpse energy from his refined corpse might scare the butterfly, Qin Sang could only rely on himself.</p><p>He didn't dare to enter the valley invisibly either, unsure if this Skyeye Butterfly had completed its third transformation. If it had already opened its Skyeye, any concealment method would be useless.</p><p>Qin Sang found an excellent hiding spot at the edge of the valley, with a view of most of it. He took out the Redfire Liquid Gold and scattered it.</p><p>Then, he waited patiently.</p><p>Butterfly Valley was vast. If the Skyeye Butterfly was still there and had a keen sense, it should detect the Redfire Liquid Gold quickly. But given its timid nature, there was no telling how long it might take.</p><p>Qin Sang hid, holding his breath, patiently waiting.</p><p>Catching a desired spirit insect in the wild was difficult. Rogue cultivators without inheritance sometimes waited near a spirit insect's nest for years, a common occurrence.</p><p>They might even waste years only to find the nest empty.</p><p>Qin Sang had the advantage of the Redfire Liquid Gold, its immense allure for spirit insects allowing him to quickly determine their presence. He had ruled out six locations in less than a month.</p><p>The sun set, and the moon rose and fell.</p><p>A night passed.</p><p>Butterfly Valley was even more beautiful at night. The stars reflected in the streams like jade ribbons, and under the faint glow of fireflies, the flowers and butterflies seemed to be holding a grand ball.</p><p>Throughout the night, nothing unusual happened in the valley.</p><p>Until dawn.</p><p>A group of butterflies of various shapes flew over the stream. Their flight path was erratic, sometimes left, sometimes right, up and down, fast and slow…</p><p>Occasionally, the group would scatter and then suddenly regroup.</p><p>Some members would leave, while others joined.  If a flower caught their interest, they would dance around it, forming a small, colorful ball.</p><p>This was a common sight in Butterfly Valley.</p><p>However, as this group flew over a patch of grass, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within them.</p><p>A drop of Redfire Liquid Gold had vanished!</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze locked onto the group of butterflies that had just passed over the grass.</p><p>His eyesight was exceptional. Even without using his divine sense, he could clearly see the nearly hundred butterflies of various species. Their behavior seemed no different from other groups.</p><p>Qin Sang examined each one, but they all appeared to be ordinary butterflies, without any flaws.</p><p>He tentatively used his divine sense, enveloping the group, but found nothing.</p><p>“What impressive concealment abilities!” Qin Sang marveled. It was said that once a Skyeye Butterfly concealed itself, even a Core Formation cultivator couldn't see through it.  This seemed to be true.</p><p>As Qin Sang observed the group's movements, another drop of Redfire Liquid Gold was consumed.</p><p>“Playing a diversionary tactic?  It managed to resist for a whole night; it seems to possess a decent level of intelligence.”  Qin Sang chuckled inwardly.</p><p>Now certain that the Skyeye Butterfly was still present, he felt reassured.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped tracking the group, focusing only on the Redfire Liquid Gold closest to him, ready to strike.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly, having spent the night ensuring there was no danger, finally succumbed to the temptation of the Redfire Liquid Gold.  It moved swiftly, devouring the liquid gold drop by drop.</p>
