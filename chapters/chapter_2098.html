<h1>Chapter 2089  Big Brother</h1><p>The sky was overcast, the sun hidden behind a thick blanket of clouds.</p><p>The sea wind picked up, waves crashing against each other, a clear sign of an approaching storm.  </p><p>Dark clouds were visibly gathering in the distance.</p><p>Amidst the wind and waves, a small boat slowly approached.  Such a small, covered boat shouldn't be out in the open sea; a single wave could easily capsize it.</p><p>However, an unusual spiritual light shimmered from the vessel, making it seem unusually light and nimble.  Ordinary people couldn't even see it; it was a cultivator's magic boat.</p><p>Three people stood at the bow, with more figures visible within the covered section.</p><p>One of them was Qin Li, holding a small fox in his arms. The fox was drowsy and half asleep.</p><p>After being sent to the North Sea, they hadn't had much peace before being rotated from Butterfly Island to the front lines.  The "front lines" were a narrow strip of sea where the Storm Realm and the Changyou forces were locked in a tense standoff.</p><p>Both sides were recovering, lacking the will for a major offensive, but their deep-seated hatred prevented any peaceful coexistence. They constantly sought ways to probe and harass each other, weakening their opponent's strength.</p><p>This sea area had become a battleground, with both sides frequently sending out small squads to skirmish—a hunting ground of sorts. Victory boosted morale.</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox had never experienced such brutal warfare. Initially, they were disoriented and even terrified, but their "little brother" proved crucial.</p><p>Jian Yi was exceptionally brave and decisive in battle, perfectly adapted to the environment, as if he had been honed in countless skirmishes. Under Jian Yi's guidance, they quickly adapted to the battlefield and achieved repeated victories.</p><p>The battlefield was dangerous, yet it offered opportunities. The various sects of the Storm Realm were undeniably generous in rewarding those who earned merit; the treasures offered were dazzling and seemingly endless.</p><p>With accumulating achievements, Qin Li and the little fox's cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds, undergoing a transformation that left them somewhat reluctant to leave.</p><p>“Why haven’t we encountered anyone yet? This is so boring! Why don't we move closer?”</p><p>The little fox stretched, grumbling.</p><p>This sea voyage aimed to accumulate enough merit to exchange for a spiritual object used in crafting magical artifacts, preparing for Qin Li's future spirit weapon.</p><p>Their magical equipment was top-notch, needing no replacements, and they couldn't consume pills indiscriminately. Although still some distance from the Golden Core stage, at this rate, a breakthrough seemed achievable, so they started planning ahead.</p><p>“Fox Immortal friend, you're confident, but caution is still advised. We are close enough. Though we are on the periphery of the main battlefield, there's always the risk of Changyou elite forces appearing. There are many precedents…”</p><p>A middle-aged man beside them gently advised.</p><p>Rumor had it that the core battlefield saw clashes involving even Yuan Ying and even Hua Shen stage cultivators, whose residual power alone was beyond their ability to withstand.</p><p>“Do you think this fox doesn’t know that?”</p><p>The little fox huffed.  “You don't need to lecture me!”</p><p>The middle-aged man looked helpless; he couldn’t control this wayward little fox, but thankfully, the fox knew its limits and wouldn't cause trouble in serious matters.  Besides, Qin Li would apologize, so no one would truly dislike it.</p><p>Qin Li indeed apologized repeatedly. He still looked honest, but after the baptism of war, he was completely transformed. Any enemy who underestimated him based on appearance would surely suffer.</p><p>Suddenly, the middle-aged man's expression changed, and he shouted, “Careful!”</p><p>Simultaneously, everyone on the boat sensed impending danger. The area around the magic boat suddenly turned blindingly white, fierce winds swept in, and the boat lurched violently.</p><p>They then saw dozens of silver fish appearing on the sea around the boat.  These were just ordinary, early-stage demonic beasts; they'd noticed them earlier but hadn't paid attention.</p><p>Now, however, powerful energy emanated from the silver fish, and they spewed white light.</p><p>The next moment, all the silver fish were disemboweled and instantly killed.  A luminous orb shot out from their bellies. With their appearance, the white light became even more intense, forming chains of light between the orbs, weaving a massive net that enveloped the magic boat. It seemed to be draining the boat's power, causing the spiritual light to dim drastically.</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>A wild laugh echoed from afar. “You’ve fallen into this general’s carefully laid trap! Let’s see if you can survive!”</p><p>“No good, retreat!”</p><p>The middle-aged man looked furious, taking out a fist-sized jade orb from his sleeve and activating it with all his might to counter the light net.</p><p>Qin Li and the others reacted swiftly, raising their magical weapons and, without needing to confer,  simultaneously attacked the same orb of light.</p><p>Several beams of light shot from their vessel, seemingly about to strike the orb. However, the enemy, well-prepared, would not let them succeed so easily.</p><p>All the orbs exploded, showering the vessel with countless fragments. In an instant, the vessel was overwhelmed.</p><p>The middle-aged man was startled. He immediately activated the vessel's strongest protective formation, raising a transparent shield like an eggshell. A deafening roar followed as the shield, bearing the brunt of the attack, instantly cracked.</p><p>The jade orb in the middle-aged man's hand also cracked, nearly shattering.  This vessel was obtained using a large amount of military merit.  To have it near destruction so soon after a battle was devastating, but he had no time for remorse. He shouted, "Retreat!"</p><p>Understanding the gravity of the situation, Qin Li and the others didn't hesitate. They unleashed their own magical weapons, seizing the opportunity to break free and fled back the way they came.</p><p>A group of Changyou warriors then appeared, but Qin Li and his companions had reacted quickly enough to avoid being surrounded.</p><p>Seeing that they had failed to trap their opponents, a Changyou leader roared.  All the Changyou warriors' four ears glowed blue, converging into a single blue beam of light, like a river of water.</p><p>The seawater seemed to be drawn upwards, flowing into the blue light.</p><p>The blue light swirled around the Changyou warriors, incorporating more and more seawater until it completely enveloped them, transforming them into towering water giants.</p><p>The Changyou, unlike the Zhuyan, did not focus on physical cultivation. However, one of their innate abilities is to transform into these water giants, possessing strength comparable to physical cultivators, and possessing no pain nor fatigue.</p><p>This ability is not easily mastered, but the fact that this entire group could transform shows they were an elite Changyou unit.</p><p>The water giants, their bodies entirely composed of water, moved across the sea surface as if on land.</p><p>They charged, the sound of rushing water echoing, their speed not inferior to Qin Li and the others' flying vessels.</p><p>The seawater was their power source. One water giant reached down, drawing a massive amount of seawater which solidified and reshaped in his hand into an axe, which he hurled at a fleeing figure.</p><p>"Dodge!"</p><p>Qin Li was responsible for the escape; the little fox provided lookout. Seeing the axe approaching, the fox warned Qin Li.</p><p>Their vessel shifted, narrowly avoiding the axe. The axe smashed into the sea, creating a deep crater with the force of its impact.</p><p>Witnessing the axe's power, everyone felt a chill, realizing they absolutely couldn't be hit by such an attack.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Spears, swords, halberds, axes, and other weapons, all formed from solidified seawater, forced Qin Li and his companions to dodge frantically, preventing them from forming a defensive formation.</p><p>The Changyou relentlessly pursued, slowly closing in.</p><p>Qin Li and his party were disorganized, and if caught, defeat was inevitable.  Just then, without warning, the sea beneath one of the water giants exploded.</p><p>A sword beam shot from the water, incredibly sharp, piercing the water giant's body as easily as cutting through tofu.  The Changyou warrior inside had no time to react before being impaled and killed instantly!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The water giant's body burst, seawater mixed with blood shocking everyone.</p><p>Before the water giant had even fully disintegrated, the sword beam had already shot towards another water giant. The sword roared like a dragon and tiger, slicing the giant in half.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>This water giant was cut in two, the Changyou warrior inside bisected, their face still frozen in an expression of excitement.</p><p>Two instantaneous kills disrupted the Changyou formation.</p><p>Making matters worse, Qin Li and his companions turned, their earlier retreat a clever deception.  They charged.</p><p>"Only you can set traps?"</p><p>The little fox laughed wildly, shouting excitedly, "Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p>The sword beam turned in mid-air, continuing its assault on the remaining water giants.  Those it targeted met the same fate.</p><p>The tide turned in an instant. The Changyou warriors fled in terror, but under the relentless assault of the sword beam and Qin Li’s group, they fell one by one.</p><p>Blood stained the sea until the last Changyou warrior fell, the enemy completely annihilated. Qin Li's side suffered only three minor injuries. The middle-aged man's vessel was the greatest loss.</p><p>The group excitedly collected the spoils of war. The sword beam returned to Jian Yi's hand.</p><p>"Jianxiong, your swordsmanship is getting more and more amazing!" Qin Li exclaimed, full of admiration.</p><p>The little fox eyed Jian Yi with suspicion. "Aren't you going to break through again this time when we get back?"</p><p>Since meeting Jian Yi, they had learned what true genius meant.  Over the years, Jian Yi's cultivation had improved at an unbelievable rate, eventually surpassing everyone else and breaking through to the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>His strength was beyond question. Without Jian Yi, they would likely have died on the battlefield long ago.</p><p>Everyone speculated that Jian Yi never used any magical artifacts other than his sword.  His battlefield achievements were probably all exchanged for pills to improve his cultivation, even so, his speed of cultivation was astounding.</p><p>The little fox's address for Jian Yi had quietly changed from "Jian Laodi"  to "Jianxiong" .</p><p>"No."</p><p>Jian Yi shook his head slightly and sheathed his sword.</p><p>Everyone quickly collected the spoils of war.  A middle-aged man brought Jian Yi's share, but Jian Yi didn't reach for them. He suddenly looked up at the sky, his gaze sharp.</p><p>"What's wrong?" the little fox asked nervously.  Whenever Jian Yi showed this expression before, something bad always happened.</p><p>Before the words were finished, a thunderous roar came from the horizon, "Dare to slaughter my people, you seek death!"</p><p>With the roar, a powerful aura rapidly approached. The horizon was like a stormy sea, a hurricane seemed to be approaching.</p><p>"A Yuanjing 3rd-stage expert!"</p><p>The middle-aged man cried out in alarm. A Yuanjing 3rd-stage expert from the Changyou tribe was equivalent to a Golden Core stage cultivator in human terms; no one present was a match for him.</p><p>With a clang, Jian Yi drew his sword and said in a low voice, "You go first, I'll draw him away!"</p><p>"No..."</p><p>Qin Li hesitated, but Jian Yi sharply commanded, "Go!"</p><p>Everyone obeyed Jian Yi without question. They guessed he might have a way to escape, and staying would only mean certain death. Returning to seek reinforcements might give them a chance of survival.</p><p>The middle-aged man bowed respectfully. "Jianxiong, take care! Let's split up!"</p><p>"You must come back alive!"</p><p>The little fox cried out.</p><p>Sword in hand, Jian Yi stood against the wind, his expression calm, his aura restrained, as if gathering strength.</p><p>He had learned sword-nurturing techniques from Jiannu.  To pursue his own path, he had decided to return to the path of sword cultivation, sealing his cultivation and focusing on enlightenment. Only by constantly seeking opponents on the battlefield, honing his skills, and clarifying his path, could he unlock the next level of cultivation.</p><p>However, he had to choose his opponents carefully. He cultivated a killer sword, not a reckless one. He didn't want to be forced to unlock his cultivation before reaching enlightenment, and he certainly didn't want to die.</p><p>He was already at the pre-Golden Core stage. This Yuanjing 3rd-stage expert coming alone was perfect for honing his sword!</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The raging storm approached, but Jian Yi remained calm. With a flick of his wrist, his sword shot out.</p><p>By this time, Qin Li and the little fox had fled far away, but they dared not stop, exerting all their strength to power their flying artifacts, hurrying back for reinforcements.</p><p>"Jianxiong will be alright!"</p><p>Qin Li kept repeating the same sentence.</p><p>The little fox also lost her usual cheerfulness, regretting her low cultivation and inability to help.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>The little fox suddenly shouted, pointing towards the main battlefield, "Go in there!"</p><p>Qin Li exclaimed, instantly understanding. Returning to the camp was too slow. Going inside might lead them to their own experts, but it could also mean encountering powerful enemies – a high-risk gamble.</p><p>But the fox and Qin Li didn't hesitate, immediately changing direction and charging into the heart of the battle.</p><p>After a burst of speed, they sensed unusual fluctuations, the energy of a fight. From a distance, they saw both sides locked in a fierce struggle. Their own experts were surrounded and losing ground, unable to send anyone to rescue Jian Yi. They could only search elsewhere.</p><p>Whether lucky or unlucky, they encountered two more groups in the same situation.</p><p>They felt something was wrong but couldn't figure out what. Gritting their teeth, they were about to search elsewhere when their minds suddenly tensed.</p><p>In the midst of the battle, a Changyou expert suddenly turned his gaze towards them, sneering, "Two things that don't know when to die, I shall grant you your wish!"</p><p>A white wave of seawater surged upwards, shooting towards them.</p><p>Qin Li and the little fox were terrified, desperately trying to escape, but they were locked onto by the wave and could only watch in despair as it approached.</p><p>At that critical moment, they sensed a familiar aura. The little fox looked up, her eyes widening in surprise.</p><p>Sword energy pierced the sky. It was Jian Yi.</p><p>He came flying on his sword, unscathed. In that short time, he had not only slain his opponent but had successfully broken through to the Golden Core stage!</p><p>The little fox and Qin Li stared at him in disbelief.</p><p>The white wave drew closer. The little fox snapped out of her stupor, seeing a savior, she cried out, "Jian Dage, save me!"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to Xigua Taro Chekenao for the generous donation!</p>
