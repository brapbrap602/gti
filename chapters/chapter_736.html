<h1>Chapter 728: Mutation</h1><p>The underground cavern resembled a realm of thunder and marshes.</p><p>Knee-high dark water flowed below, while heavy thunderclouds hung above.</p><p>Such a peculiar landscape was a first for Qin Sang.</p><p>How could thunderous energy be nurtured in this sunless subterranean world?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't comprehend it.</p><p>The Six-Petal Violet plants grew on the other side of the dark river, rooted between crevices in the stone. Besides that location, Qin Sang also found two excavated areas along the riverbank.</p><p>Judging by the traces, Qin Sang guessed that it might not have been herbs, but some kind of ore.</p><p>This place not only harbored the Six-Petal Violet, but also rare minerals, making it a veritable treasure trove.</p><p>The ore had fallen into the hands of the Wu tribe's burly man and had been thoroughly mined. As for what kind of ore it was and its value, it was impossible to verify.</p><p>Immature Six-Petal Violets would wither immediately after being forcibly picked, losing most of their medicinal potency.</p><p>Judging by this man's actions, if the Six-Petal Violets didn't have this characteristic, these plants probably wouldn't have lasted until maturity; he would have dug them all up.</p><p>Perhaps the formation of the thunderclouds was related to that unknown ore.</p><p>Standing in the water, Qin Sang looked up at the thunderclouds, then down at the Sky-Eye Butterfly in his palm.</p><p>After entering the underground space, the Sky-Eye Butterfly had awakened on its own. It conveyed a yearning desire, eager to come out, its target seemingly something within the thunderclouds.</p><p>If there were treasures in the thunderclouds, wouldn't the Wu tribesman have taken them already?</p><p>As a Wu tribe cultivator, he would likely have a natal insect蛊, as expected.</p><p>Could it be that the thunderclouds only attracted the Sky-Eye Butterfly?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rashly release the Sky-Eye Butterfly. Instead, he took out the Fat Silkworm and found it indifferent, confirming his guess.</p><p>The thunderous energy within the thunderclouds wasn't as terrifying as that of the outside world; the lightning generated was very thin.  However, trying to probe it with divine sense was also wishful thinking.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, causing the thunderclouds to vibrate.</p><p>For a time, smoke and clouds filled the cavern, accompanied by rumbling thunder.  Qin Sang quickly stopped, having seen the core of the thundercloud: it contained nothing but a mass of cloud vapor.</p><p>His search fruitless, Qin Sang released the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly happily flapped its wings, flew beneath the thunderclouds, and began to circle.</p><p>Soon, the Sky-Eye Butterfly hovered at the center point below the thundercloud and began to rapidly beat its wings. The Sky-Eye Butterfly's strength was considerable; its flapping wings generated a strong wind, stirring the thunderclouds.</p><p>But unlike Qin Sang, the wind created by the Sky-Eye Butterfly had a peculiar suction force. As the thundercloud churned, a wisp of milky-white mist gradually formed in Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>This wisp of mist was extremely thin, pulled into a thread by the suction force.  The other end was connected to the Sky-Eye Butterfly's proboscis.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly was absorbing the mist!</p><p>A look of surprise crossed Qin Sang's face.  To him, the thundercloud seemed ordinary, merely condensed water vapor, yet the Sky-Eye Butterfly treated it as a delicacy. Qin Sang could clearly sense the butterfly's joy and satisfaction.</p><p>"What could be in the thundercloud…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, glanced at the Six-Petal Violets in the distance, and flashed over.</p><p>The Six-Petal Violets were exquisitely beautiful, vibrantly colored, and there were six of them, enough for the Sky-Eye Butterfly to grow to the peak of its second transformation.</p><p>The ancient texts of the Spirit Controlling Sect offered a simple description of the Six-Petal Violet, stating only that it was a spirit flower favored by the Sky-Eye Butterfly and could be used to nurture it.</p><p>There was no detailed description of its characteristics or growing environment.</p><p>"Because of the unknown white mist in the thundercloud, the Six-Petal Violet is nurtured.  Could it be that what the Sky-Eye Butterfly truly desires is the white mist?"</p><p>Qin Sang could only speculate.</p><p>He took out six jade boxes and carefully collected the Six-Petal Violets. Looking around and seeing no other treasures, he returned to the center of the dark river and observed the Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>In a short time, the white mist had thickened to the size of a chopstick.</p><p>The small body of the Sky-Eye Butterfly seemed like a bottomless pit, greedily devouring the mist, seemingly without limit.</p><p>Just then, dense thunder rumbled deep within the thundercloud. Then, a flash of lightning appeared within the white mist, the two merging into one.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression changed.  He was about to urge the Sky-Eye Butterfly to evade, but unexpectedly, it showed no fear. Instead, it flapped its wings and flew upwards, sucking in both the white mist and the lightning!</p><p>Qin Sang was dumbfounded. He hadn't anticipated this at all and couldn't react in time. He hurriedly flew over, anxiously watching the Sky-Eye Butterfly's changes.</p><p>What would be the consequences of swallowing lightning?</p><p>Even the smallest lightning bolt represented the most violent force in the world!</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly hovered in mid-air. The white mist dissipated, and calm returned, as if the butterfly had fallen asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang was very nervous.  He communicated with the Sky-Eye Butterfly's consciousness.  The good news was that its consciousness remained stable, but its aura was fluctuating.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly rested on Qin Sang's hand, enveloped by wisps of white mist. Its body trembled, clearly affected by the lightning.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly's impulsive action caught Qin Sang off guard, but he couldn't stand idly by. The only thing he could do was utilize the connection between their bloodlines and pour his True Essence into it.</p><p>As time passed, the trembling gradually subsided; the most critical moment had passed. Then, its aura finally stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief and leaned in for a closer look. He discovered that the Sky-Eye Butterfly hadn't changed much after swallowing the lightning.</p><p>Only the patterns on its wings seemed somewhat brighter.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Sky-Eye Butterfly flapped its wings again, flew back up, and continued to devour the white mist and lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. This time, he didn't interfere, letting the Sky-Eye Butterfly do as it pleased.</p><p>Rising and falling repeatedly, the Sky-Eye Butterfly became more and more at ease, swallowing large amounts of mist and lightning.</p><p>Until the last wisp of mist was consumed, the Sky-Eye Butterfly returned to Qin Sang's palm and lay there, looking listless.  Then, its wings suddenly began to glow.</p><p>Silver light flowed between the peculiar patterns.</p><p>The light grew brighter and brighter, and white mist diffused, eventually forming a cocoon of lightning that enveloped the Sky-Eye Butterfly. It lay within the lightning cocoon, falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the entire process without intervening, but he remained anxiously focused on the Sky-Eye Butterfly's condition.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that this sleep wasn't a transformation, but rather related to a rare phenomenon recorded in the Wu tribe's history – a Spirit Insect mutation!</p><p>Generally, Spirit Insects possessed only a single ability.</p><p>It had been discovered that Spirit Insects had a chance to mutate under certain fortuitous circumstances. The probability of mutation was very small, but not uncommon in the Wu tribe's long history of insect control.</p><p>Spirit Insect mutations were random and couldn't be replicated.  Qin Sang hadn't expected to encounter such an opportunity here.</p>
