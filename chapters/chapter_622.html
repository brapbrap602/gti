<h1>Chapter 614: Doubts (A bonus chapter for Ma Mang Meng!)</h1><p>Strange, unfamiliar restriction runes floated within Qin Sang's meridians and Qi Sea. His spiritual power was abundant, yet completely unusable, firmly locked away. The restriction rune left by Duke Dongyang was no simple matter. Over the past few days, Qin Sang had made countless attempts, exhausting every method, but couldn't budge the runes in the slightest.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang had been skeptical of the "Stone Bridge Zen" technique offered by Duke Dongyang. This meditative practice was clearly different from orthodox Buddhist teachings, resembling demonic arts more than contemplative practices. It felt incongruous with the Buddhist path of severing emotions, and Qin Sang suspected Dongyang was mostly trying to deceive Chen Yan.</p><p>But after experiencing the restriction rune, Qin Sang's perspective changed, filled with fear. Breaking this rune would likely require someone incredibly powerful. Qin Sang even doubted if a late-stage Gold Core cultivator could manage it. If "Stone Bridge Zen" was a mere deception, Dongyang wouldn't waste this precious restriction rune on him. A simple gesture would suffice; a mere False Core cultivator couldn't escape his grasp.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if Dongyang was unwilling or afraid to openly antagonize Chen Yan, having already planned a fallback. He must have been certain Chen Yan would eventually comply, using the restriction rune as a display of good faith.  "Stone Bridge Zen," the path of severing emotions, killing one's husband to achieve enlightenmentâ€”they must all be real.</p><p>If not for the Jade Buddha protecting his Nascent Soul, shielding him from the rune's full effect and granting him a sliver of hope, he would be completely powerless and at someone's mercy, facing certain death. Qin Sang felt a deep sense of dread.  The path of severing emotions, unlike dual cultivation, offered no logic or reason.</p><p>*I would turn into a stone bridge, enduring five hundred years of wind, five hundred years of sun, five hundred years of rain, just to have her walk across.*</p><p>The path of severing emotions requires the cultivator to fall deeply in love, the deeper the better, an eternal love. The other person's feelings were completely irrelevant.</p><p>*Mountains crumble, rivers run dry.*</p><p>*Winter thunder rumbles, summer snow falls.*</p><p>*Heaven and earth merge.*</p><p>*Only then would I dare to part with you.*</p><p>*This is the ideal scenario.*</p><p>At the moment of enlightenment, in the depths of grief, one takes the life of their beloved, experiencing the most agonizing heartbreak, completely shattering their own heart. </p><p>*A newly widowed woman, enlightened through heartbreak!*</p><p>However, this was also the inherent danger of the path of severing emotions. Under normal circumstances, achieving this extreme effect was difficult. Insufficient progress could create flaws in the cultivator's Dao Heart.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang and Chen Yan were bound by the "Mystical Jade Cauldron Scripture," leaving an indelible mark on Chen Yan's heart.  If Chen Yan opened her heart, letting the imprint guide her, she might actually achieve it. In that scenario, the Jade Buddha wouldn't save Qin Sang; it would become a death warrant, intensifying Chen Yan's love. Once her cultivation was complete, Chen Yan would behead Qin Sang with a single stroke, and a hundred Jade Buddhas couldn't stop her.</p><p>With the restriction rune active, seeking external help was impossible. In this unfamiliar place, finding a rune master in a short time was unlikely.  Moreover, it would require lowering all defenses, opening his Qi Sea and meridians to another's intrusion, essentially placing his life in their hands. Qin Sang wouldn't risk it.</p><p>Qin Sang's only hope was to leverage the influx of spiritual energy during Core Formation, attempting to flush out the restriction rune. However, while Core Formation involved the convergence of heaven and earth's spiritual energies, its primary function was to refine the body and spirit, its raw power actually limited. Qin Sang couldn't be certain if it would be enough to break the rune.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang subconsciously touched his empty left shoulder. He had severed this arm himself, preparing to use the "Severing Body Puppet Technique." He acquired this technique from the ancient cultivator's legacy at the Hanging Skull Pass, after eliminating Elder Di Que. It was a technique of self-preservation, like a lizard shedding its tail. Elder Di Que's attempt on Master Xuanyu's life relied on this method, severing his left arm. His previous leg injury likely stemmed from the same technique.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't used the "Severing Body Puppet Technique" since acquiring it. He wouldn't resort to it unless absolutely necessary. After severing a limb with this technique, even Elder Di Que couldn't regenerate it, becoming crippled.</p><p>Yet, in the Violet Palace, facing Dongyang, Qin Sang was prepared to sever his arm to survive. He knew a Nascent Soul ancestor possessed unpredictable methods. If Dongyang suddenly attacked, he might have a way to retaliate. Qin Sang planned to use the puppet to escape, severing his arm to break free from Dongyang's lock.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Chen Yan acted decisively, successfully intercepting Dongyang, sparing Qin Sang from losing his arm. However, after entering the teleportation formation, Qin Sang's left arm wasn't spared after all.</p><p>His divine sense instantly drained, his spiritual power unusable. Before losing consciousness, he felt a terrifying force lock onto him.  A direct hit would mean certain death. In that final moment, as a last resort, Qin Sang severed his arm, hoping to escape the force, then fell unconscious.</p><p>The teleportation was instantaneous. Even now, Qin Sang didn't know if he was lucky, teleporting before the force struck, or if the technique actually worked. Because when he awoke, he found himself not at the other end of the teleportation formation, nor rescued by anyone, but drifting alone in a river!</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly baffled. Countless speculations led nowhere. Besides his self-inflicted arm wound, he only had bruises and scrapes from drifting in the river, no signs of being attacked. Could the other side of the teleportation formation have been a cliff? Did he fall after teleporting?</p><p>Adrift in the river, Qin Sang's divine sense was depleted, his spiritual power restricted, his body severely injured. The corpse transformation within him surged uncontrollably, his body emanating corpse Qi, indistinguishable from a true corpse.</p><p>The most dangerous moment came when he encountered the man in animal skins. Fortunately, the man's cultivation was low. Seeing the dense corpse Qi, he let his guard down, carelessly opening his spirit beast pouch and falling prey to the Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets.</p><p>In truth, whether the man opened a corpse puppet pouch or a spirit beast pouch, he was doomed. The Flying Night Devil had completed its transformation.  Had he opened a corpse puppet pouch, Qin Sang would have the Flying Night Devil's protection, avoiding such a miserable state.</p><p>Although he hadn't fully subdued the Bloodwing Ghost Head Hornets, he had nurtured them for so long, fostering a slight connection. Familiar with Qin Sang's aura, they initially refrained from attacking him. However, once they devoured all surrounding life, that might change.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare linger.  Mustering all his strength, he turned over, using the river current and a broken log to drift away, eventually being rescued by Ya Gu.</p><p>After days of recuperation, he finally regained some vitality. Once his divine sense recovered slightly, he could open his Qianjun Ring, retrieve the healing medicines within, and accelerate his recovery.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Ya Gu, saying softly, "The old man was right. You're too naive. You can't trust others so easily in the future."</p><p>*(Didn't rest at noon, rushed out a chapter, evening as usual.*</p><p>*I'm curious, the last chapter only mentioned spiritual power being restricted, when did I say anything about needing to recultivate?*</p><p>*Why are you all talking about it as if it's a fact, looking so angry-_-||*</p><p>*Do you think my plot is so easily predictable?)*</p>
