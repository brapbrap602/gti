<h1>Chapter 308 Dividing the Spoils</h1><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>Luo Xingnan made a desperate last stand, unleashing the full power of his Silver Knife talisman. A dazzling silver light, several meters long, tore through the air.</p><p>Qin Sang, with the Dragon Spirit suddenly manifesting around him, experienced a surge in speed. His figure twisted sharply, narrowly dodging the surprise attack. He grunted, his body sent flying.</p><p>He clutched his right chest, his hand covered in blood.</p><p>Using himself as bait and relying on the Nine Dragons Chariot talisman, Qin Sang had evaded the Silver Knife's fatal blow at the last moment.  His right chest was still grazed by the blade's aura, leaving a serious wound.</p><p>Fortunately, the talisman was fast enough to protect his vital organs.</p><p>Still, a wound was better than death.</p><p>Inside the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation, Shangguan Lifeng's vision was completely obscured by ghostly energy. Moreover, Qin Sang was disguised as Daoist Qingfeng. Even if Shangguan Lifeng noticed the Nine Dragons Chariot talisman, it wouldn't be a major concern.</p><p>The Silver Knife's surprise attack failed. The blade's aura trembled, poised to continue pursuing Qin Sang, but abruptly transformed back into a talisman mid-air, fluttering down.</p><p>The talisman was covered in cracks, only slightly better off than the Jade Ruyi talisman. It seemed it could be used only once or twice more.</p><p>Luo Xingnan had possessed the Silver Knife talisman for quite a while. Once its power was depleted, it couldn't be replenished. Though he had used it sparingly, it was nearing exhaustion.</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual energy to retrieve the talisman.  He hastily sealed his wound and rushed to the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation, catching Shangguan Lifeng as he collapsed from exhaustion.</p><p>At the same time, the main spirit of the Yama Banner, carrying Luo Xingnan's body, scurried over with a fawning expression.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's body was crisscrossed with knife and sword wounds. His heart was shredded by sword energy. He had died with his eyes wide open, unwilling to accept his demise, unable to believe he had died here.</p><p>His energy core was intact, suitable for creating a Malignant Corpse.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly, tidying up Luo Xingnan's body and storing it in his storage pouch.</p><p>According to the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*, the strength of a Malignant Corpse was closely related to the cultivator's strength during their lifetime. A corpse refined from a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator would be significantly stronger than his previous ones.</p><p>Recalling the battle, Qin Sang's heart still pounded.  Although he had been 80% confident, the actual execution had been incredibly dangerous.</p><p>Luo Xingnan also possessed a talisman.  Having witnessed Qin Sang use the Jade Ruyi talisman, he would have been prepared.  Neither the talisman nor the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation alone could have killed him.</p><p>Using both would have drained his spiritual energy too quickly, making it difficult to forcibly kill Luo Xingnan protected by his talisman.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang had devised this strategy, taking a significant risk.  Fortunately, it had succeeded.</p><p>Instead of immediately withdrawing the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation, Qin Sang had the main spirit return to the banner and concealed it.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng watched Qin Sang manipulate the demonic artifact but asked nothing.</p><p>Returning to the cave entrance, Qin Sang had Shangguan Lifeng focus on recovery.  He himself, enduring his injuries, hid at the entrance, vigilantly observing the surroundings.</p><p>Some time passed, and everything remained calm.</p><p>"It seems the Scholar in White has left."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to himself. The Scholar truly wasn't greedy.  Otherwise, he might have stayed to reap the benefits.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't have allowed him to succeed.</p><p>This place wasn't safe for long. Qin Sang summoned the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation, turned back, and entered the cave. He found Yun Youzi sitting cross-legged. Although still weak, he looked better than before.</p><p>Hearing this, both Yun Youzi and Shangguan Lifeng agreed. The three of them, defying expectations, flew deeper into the Ancient Battlefield.</p><p>Not long after their departure.</p><p>Within the cave, the main hall suddenly trembled, emitting strange waves.</p><p>Everyone in the cave felt the tremors, looking towards the summit with puzzled expressions.</p><p>Then, a rainbow shot out of the hall, followed by the roar of the Hook Serpent.</p><p>Everyone knew something had happened in the main hall.  This location was special and significant.  If a treasure had appeared, it would be extraordinary.</p><p>Instantly, except for those already in the Treasure Pavilion, everyone rushed towards the main hall. Countless streaks of light, like fireflies, converged at the summit, a magnificent sight.</p><p>These events were no longer Qin Sang's concern.</p><p>After distancing themselves from the Qiuhong Market, they found a hidden spot. All three were injured, and deep within the Ancient Battlefield, dangers lurked everywhere.  They needed to recover quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang was the least injured. After consuming a few spirit pills and meditating, the effects of his injuries lessened considerably.</p><p>Shangguan Lifeng's most serious injury was his severed left arm.  Apart from that, he was mainly suffering from spiritual energy depletion, recovering around the same time as Qin Sang.</p><p>Only Yun Youzi, despite meditating for so long, showed little improvement.  The price he had paid for activating the Flawless Pearl was greater than Qin Sang had imagined.</p><p>Yun Youzi opened his eyes, the fatigue in them slightly reduced.  He said with some helplessness, "This old Daoist fears he'll need a few years of recuperation to recover. I can't help Brother Qin refine pills during this time.  Forcing it would drastically reduce the success rate, wasting that hard-earned Striped Yellow Essence."</p><p>"There's no rush, Senior…"</p><p>The matter of his foundation wouldn't affect him much in the short term. A few years wouldn't make a big difference.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke, suddenly remembering something. He retrieved Ge Yuan and Luo Xingnan's storage pouches and took out the three spirit herbs, placing them before him.</p><p>"Among these three spirit herbs, is there anything that could aid Senior's recovery?"</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head repeatedly. "Absolutely not! Although this old Daoist didn't witness it personally, Brother Qin must have risked his life to kill Luo Xingnan. One wrong move, and it would have been disastrous! These are the fruits of Brother Qin's struggle. This old Daoist cannot accept them."</p><p>Qin Sang disagreed.  "Without Senior gravely injuring the Snakehead and scaring off the Hook Serpent, this junior would have already perished at the hands of the beast, with no chance to fight Luo Xingnan.  Surely Senior doesn't want this junior to be ungrateful?  Fellow Daoist Shangguan also contributed.  The three spirit herbs can be divided equally."</p><p>Unexpectedly, Shangguan Lifeng also refused his share without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat amused. He never thought that thousand-year spirit herbs, for which countless cultivators would fight tooth and nail, would be pushed back and forth between the three of them.</p><p>As for Qin Sang himself, he was content with the Striped Yellow Essence. Obtaining another spirit herb was a bonus; he wouldn't be so greedy as to keep all three.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Yun Youzi declined again, but seeing Qin Sang's resolute expression, he finally accepted, pointing to the Haze Grass.</p><p>"This Haze Grass can be directly refined and consumed without being made into a pill.  A thousand-year-old Haze Grass is truly rare. This one's age is sufficient, and its efficacy far surpasses ordinary Haze Grass.  If nothing goes wrong, it should allow this old Daoist to recover at least two years earlier."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded, closed the jade box containing the Haze Grass, and handed it to Yun Youzi.</p>
