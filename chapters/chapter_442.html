Chapter 435: A Single Sword


The men on the sampan saw the fighter jet and exerted all their strength, increasing the sampan's speed.


Just then, a loud "bang" echoed from the center of the purple glow, as if something had shattered.


Countless purple lights shot out in all directions, and the glow quickly dissipated.


The purple treasure bottle had been forcibly destroyed by the Nine-Flame Divine Blade!


Although the Nine-Flame Divine Blade did not perish with it, its luster had dimmed considerably, and numerous fine cracks appeared on its body.  Six of the nine fire dragons encircling the blade had vanished, leaving only three, their breaths weak and forms dissipating.


"Go!"


Mu Yifeng roared.


The Nine-Flame Divine Blade shone brightly red, its energy pouring into the remaining three fire dragons.


The three fire dragons, as if in a final blaze of glory, rapidly expanded their energy before intertwining their bodies and hurtling towards their opponent with astonishing speed.


The man from the Tianxing League hadn't expected Mu Yifeng's magical weapon to be so powerful.  His face showed a look of astonishment as he retreated clumsily, desperately deploying various techniques to barely disperse the fire dragons.


Mu Yifeng, seizing the opportunity, quickly retrieved the Nine-Flame Divine Blade and fled.


The distance between them, already close, had been significantly widened.


"I'll see where you can run to!"


The man from the Tianxing League, enraged, let out a cruel smile. Without waiting for his breath to steady, he pursued relentlessly.


At this moment, Qin Sang had already moved secretly.


He remained hidden underwater, using water-遁术 (water escape technique), suppressing his aura, yet moving swiftly.


No one noticed Qin Sang.  Firstly, Qin Sang acted cautiously and was still far away. Secondly, both Mu Yifeng's opponent and the people on the sampan were captivated by the battle.


Qin Sang's target was the direction Mu Yifeng was fleeing.


As he sped underwater, he silently calculated the distance between them.


The sampan was far behind, and the other pursuer had been left a significant distance behind thanks to Mu Yifeng's sacrifice of his Nine-Flame Divine Blade; he wouldn't be able to catch up in a short time.


As long as Mu Yifeng didn't give up or change direction, he would definitely make it.


During the chase, Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he considered his strategy.


In the vast waters,


birds were invisible, fish and shrimp unseen.


Between the sky and water, two遁光 (escape lights) tore through the air, shattering the tranquility.


On the surface, the sampan charged aggressively, splitting the waves.


Underwater, a person stealthily moved.


Mu Yifeng glanced back at his relentless pursuer, a faint wry smile on his face.  The spiritual energy in his dantian was almost exhausted; soon, he would be depleted.


He had sacrificed his decades-old magical weapon, yet still failed to kill his opponent.


But even if he had killed this person, what good would it do?


He couldn't escape the pursuit of the treasure ship.


It's a pity; he hadn't even seen the landscape beyond the Golden Core stage.


A hint of regret flashed in Mu Yifeng's eyes. He looked down at the Nine-Flame Divine Blade in his hand, this old warhorse that had accompanied him since the Foundation Establishment stage, now dim and cracked.


Though not completely destroyed, it would require at least several years to recover.


Mu Yifeng clenched his hand, feeling the familiar aura of the Nine-Flame Divine Blade, and his heart seemed to settle.


For a cultivator devoted to the Dao, his magical weapon was his only solace.


"Don't worry, I'll take you with me.  I wouldn't leave you to fall into the hands of villains,"


Mu Yifeng chuckled, murmuring to the Nine-Flame Divine Blade.


He had already made up his mind to kill himself.  Falling into the enemy's hands would be worse than a swift death.


Just then, Mu Yifeng suddenly heard a faint voice transmission.


"Senior Brother Mu…"


Mu Yifeng looked doubtful, staring at the boundless water ahead, thinking he had hallucinated before death.  But then, a clearer voice came again.


"Senior Brother Mu… it's me… it's Qin Sang!"


A flash of lightning struck Mu Yifeng's mind. He suddenly remembered someone and couldn't help but rejoice.  But with his vast experience, he immediately realized that Qin Sang must be hiding in the shadows.  He kept his speed and gaze unchanged.


"Senior Brother Mu, I'm underwater…"


By this time, Qin Sang had arrived ahead of Mu Yifeng, lurking underwater and using the 《遁灵诀》(Dun Ling Jue) to secretly contact Mu Yifeng.


The opportunity was fleeting, and he spoke rapidly, "Senior Brother Mu, how many experts are on the ship?"


"Junior Brother Qin, just you?"


Mu Yifeng immediately understood something; the joy on his face was instantly replaced by deep disappointment.  He remembered Qin Sang's cultivation level; when they last parted, it was far inferior to his.


Even with any adventures over the years, his cultivation at most barely exceeded the late Foundation Establishment stage.  Furthermore, being a man at the end of his life, if exposed, there would be no outcome other than death for both of them.

Hearing Qin Sang's question, Mu Yifeng, without time to consider why Qin Sang was also there, hurriedly transmitted a voice to dissuade him: "Junior Brother Qin, don't reveal yourself. There are two late Foundation Establishment cultivators on the boat. Don't let them discover you..."

Qin Sang already understood.  Before taking action, he had guessed as much.

The people on the sampan, no matter how high their cultivation, couldn't possibly be Golden Core masters. Otherwise, crushing Mu Yifeng would be as easy as crushing an ant. They wouldn't have tolerated his escape for so long.

But to be safe, he didn't act rashly. He chose to find Mu Yifeng first and ascertain the opponent's strength. He could save people, but not at the cost of his own life.

Mu Yifeng, with his extremely fast escape technique, sped past. Receiving no further response from Qin Sang, he felt a mix of emotions, sighing silently.

Suddenly, a thunderclap exploded behind him.  A bolt from the blue!

Mu Yifeng was startled. He turned his head and saw the calm water surface torn open by a lightning bolt.

A sword light shot out from the water with unbelievable speed, like thunder and lightning, soaring straight into the sky.

At that moment, the Tianxing League cultivator's escaping light happened to fly overhead.

Qin Sang's timing was perfect. In an instant, the ebony sword, like a manifestation of thunder, struck the cultivator.

This attack was completely unexpected.  The cultivator's protective artifact had been destroyed by Mu Yifeng. Furious and shocked, his entire attention was focused on Mu Yifeng, pursuing him with all his might. Faced with the suddenly appearing ebony sword, he couldn't react at all.

Furthermore, the thunderous sword energy was an astonishingly powerful technique. Once the divine sword was unleashed, thunder followed, its speed far exceeding imagination.

Even if the cultivator hadn't been distracted, at such close range, under Qin Sang's deliberate sneak attack, he couldn't escape his fate.

Only when he saw the ebony sword was close at hand did the rumbling thunder reach his ears.

"Ambush!"

The thought barely crossed his mind before his consciousness was overwhelmed by the deafening thunder.  Then he felt a chill, and lost consciousness.

'Splash!'

Blood rained down from the sky.

The bisected corpse, its momentum unchecked, flew a considerable distance before separating completely.

The scene was horrifying.

The ebony sword killed its enemy with one strike, then was retrieved by Qin Sang, its feat remaining unknown.
