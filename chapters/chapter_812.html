<h1>Chapter 804: Azure Bird</h1><p>Chapter 804: Azure Bird</p><p>The fourth level of the Heavenly Demon Dharma requires a cultivation level equivalent to the Yuan Ying stage, which is still far beyond his reach. Qin Sang focused on the first three levels, carefully considering whether he could cultivate them.</p><p>He worked tirelessly for several days.</p><p>One day, he suddenly left Tianxing Island, flew far away from the island chain for a whole day, and arrived at an uninhabited deserted island. He planned to try practicing the "Heavenly Demon Transformation Technique" here.</p><p>This technique draws upon the power of the stars, and Qin Sang wasn't sure how much commotion it would cause during cultivation, so he decided to experiment first in a secluded place.</p><p>He casually set up a large array. Because of the nature of the technique, he needed direct access to the starry sky, so he didn't even need a cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a rock, waiting for nightfall.</p><p>During the day, the scorching sun was filled with solar energy, which, while also capable of drawing upon the power of the stars, was not a good time to cultivate.  The sun's power was at its peak, intense and violent.  Cultivating during this time was very likely to cause self-harm, and a moment of carelessness could even lead to being burned to death by the sun. Only those with a high enough cultivation level could withstand it.</p><p>Only when the night was cool could he connect with the stars.</p><p>The sun set in the west.</p><p>Darkness enveloped everything.</p><p>A thin veil covered the world, and the light gradually dimmed.</p><p>Finally, it was completely dark. The moon in the sky mirrored the moon in the sea, and two rivers of stars, one in the sky and one in the ocean, shone in Qin Sang's view, scattering starlight, ethereal and serene, a breathtakingly beautiful scene.</p><p>After appreciating the view, Qin Sang took out his bone flute, placing it on his lap, and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p>"Discard distracting thoughts, maintain your original intention, visualize the Heavenly Demon... like a bright lamp hanging high, dispelling the clouds and mist, illuminating the path forward…"</p><p>Qin Sang silently recalled his understanding of the scripture.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Transformation Technique" contained profound meaning; every word and phrase needed careful consideration. Fortunately, Qin Sang came from a reputable orthodox sect and had a deep foundation.</p><p>Visualization techniques were commonly found in Buddhist scriptures, which Qin Sang had not been exposed to before. But whether Buddhist, Taoist, or demonic, the principles of maintaining one's original intention and discarding distracting thoughts were the same, so entry wasn't difficult.</p><p>The soft moonlight bathed Qin Sang.</p><p>The bone flute lay on his lap.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless. At this moment, even the wind seemed to have stopped, the sea surface was calm, and Qin Sang seemed to have transformed into an old pine tree, rooted to this deserted island.</p><p>His thoughts were moving, attempting visualization.</p><p>Visualization was the most perplexing aspect of this technique for Qin Sang.</p><p>Demonic cultivators didn't need to worry; they simply needed to activate their bloodline and visualize their ancestors. Their bloodlines carried the deep imprints of their ancestors.</p><p>Guided by their ancestors, they followed the path of their ancestors, undergoing transformation after transformation, ultimately becoming Heavenly Demons.</p><p>As a human, Qin Sang didn't know who to visualize.</p><p>This was a lost world; Qin Sang didn't even know the true names of the Great Ascension Stage cultivators, let alone visualize them. Ultimately, he chose a target: the jade Buddha.</p><p>He wasn't sure if this decision was right or wrong; he had to try to find out.</p><p>In his Purple Mansion, a faint yellow Buddhist light emanated from his primordial spirit; the image of the broken-armed jade Buddha was already deeply ingrained in his mind.</p><p>"Jade Buddha…"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He raised his head, opened his eyes, and looked up at the sky.</p><p>Countless stars shone in the night sky, full of mystery.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang stored the image of the countless stars in his mind, then closed his eyes, imagining the starlight condensing, the stars shifting, and in the starry sky of his consciousness, a golden Buddha gradually appeared.</p><p>Everything was born from his will.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Transformation Technique" stated that once this step of visualization was successful, the bone flute would respond, helping the cultivator to begin the practice and guiding them to absorb starlight, starting the first step of body tempering.</p><p>At the same time, the bone flute was not as simple as Qin Sang had previously thought, merely a jade slip and a trigger.</p><p>The bone flute should have been specially refined by the great demon who created the technique. During cultivation, holding the bone flute would provide assistance. Although not strictly necessary, cultivating without it would be far more difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang forgot everything, with only the image of the jade Buddha in his heart, waiting for the bone flute's response.</p><p>He cultivated without a sense of time.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered during the day and cultivated at night, never slacking off.</p><p>But to his disappointment, not only did the bone flute not respond, but the technique also showed no progress.</p><p>"I have no worries of inner demons; I learned how to eliminate distracting thoughts at the beginning of my cultivation and have long since reached a state of equanimity."</p><p>The "Soul Cultivation Sword Chapter" can't be worse than the "Heavenly Demon Transformation," but if the cultivation method's requirements are this harsh, even I can't grasp the basic concepts. Those unintelligent, unformed demonic beasts would never be able to cultivate it…"</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on his recent experiences, pinpointing the problem.  "Visualizing the Jade Buddha isn't working!  Then I can only try the Heavenly Demon…"</p><p>Heavenly Demons are only mentioned briefly in ancient texts.</p><p>Some ancient texts describe famous sacred beasts and great demons like dragons, phoenixes, and qilin in detail. But Qin Sang had never seen these great demons firsthand, making visualization difficult.</p><p>The only one he'd ever seen was a Qingluan!</p><p>Years ago in the Turbulent Islands waters, Old Madam Jing summoned a Qingluan wooden puppet to fight, an image deeply etched in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>He remembered Old Madam Jing saying she'd been fortunate enough to see a real Qingluan and feel its presence. While she hadn't touched the divine beast itself, her wooden carving captured the Qingluan's essence better than any ancient text.</p><p>At the time, he couldn't spot any flaws; he thought it was a living Qingluan.</p><p>Visualizing the Qingluan was the best option.</p><p>However, Old Madam Jing's carving wasn't a real Heavenly Demon; whether it could activate the bone flute was unknown.</p><p>"Worth a try…"</p><p>Qin Sang had prepared for this moment.  He'd spent time recalling every detail of seeing the Qingluan, missing nothing.</p><p>The Qingluan's initial playfulness, its majestic power wielding blue flames during the battle at Yushan Pavilion, its heroic self-sacrifice…</p><p>He'd already sketched the Qingluan's image in his mind; visualization was easy.</p><p>In his mind's eye, countless stars shot out brilliant light.  A magnificent Qingluan soared through the starry sea, spreading its wings. Its feathers were wreathed in blue flames, like a divine bird bathed in fire.</p><p>Suddenly, the bone flute in his hand moved.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a powerful pull within him.  The Qingluan in the star sea opened its divine eyes, looked at him, then spread its wings and flew toward him.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>A gale howled in the visualized starry sky, leaving him breathless.</p><p>The Qingluan’s speed was astonishing.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, the Qingluan descended.</p><p>His thoughts were beyond his control.  In his imagination, the stars shimmered, long rays of light shooting down from the heavens, converging with the Qingluan and falling onto his head, entering his body through his Baihui acupoint.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang felt a cool, ethereal energy enter his body, bringing with it an indescribable comfort; a gentle breeze surrounded him, making him feel light and ethereal, intoxicatingly blissful.</p>
