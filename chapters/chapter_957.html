<h1>Chapter 949: Another Attempt</h1><p>Deep in a secluded valley.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, wondering if he had come to the wrong place.</p><p>Bloodsoul Fruits grew in the crevices of cliffs, and the Red-tailed Cranes also nested there.</p><p>The scene before him didn't match his memory.</p><p>A waterfall now cascaded down the middle of the cliff, and the rock walls on both sides were shattered and covered in cracks.  It didn't look natural, but rather like the claw marks of several monstrous beasts, and cracks left by powerful collisions.</p><p>Had a great battle taken place here after he left?</p><p>Qin Sang had a vague guess.</p><p>The Seven Kills Domain was never peaceful. Bloodsoul Fruits held immense allure for ferocious beasts, and the Red-tailed Cranes weren't powerful enough to monopolize them.  If other beasts discovered the fruits, a fierce battle was inevitable.</p><p>“Judging by the scene, the battle must have been brutal.  The Red-tailed Cranes were probably driven away. I wonder if the spiritual herb that bore the Bloodsoul Fruit still exists?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, but felt little hope.</p><p>Hidden in the person-high weeds, he awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly to observe the waterfall. As expected, he found something unusual.  There were large and small openings within the waterfall, dozens of them, densely packed together.</p><p>They didn't look like Red-tailed Crane nests.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a Corpse Soldier and directed it towards the pool beneath the waterfall.  The Corpse Soldier burst through the weeds, and just as it approached the pool, a series of hostile cries suddenly echoed from above.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>Water erupted from the waterfall as a flock of snow-white, hawk-like birds burst forth, their speed astonishing, leaving trails of afterimages in the air as they charged towards the Corpse Soldier.</p><p>These adult white birds were comparable in strength to Core Formation cultivators. The Corpse Soldier had no power to resist, turning to flee, but it hadn't gone far before the birds caught up, instantly tearing it to pieces.</p><p>If not for the bizarre odor emanating from the Corpse Soldier, the birds would have devoured it whole.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang seized the opportunity to approach the waterfall and examine the nests. Finally, in one nest, he saw what appeared to be the remnants of a spiritual herb. The Bloodsoul Fruit vine, once verdant and laden with green fruits, now lay as a withered root.</p><p>New sprouts and two tender green leaves emerged from the remnant root, indicating it was still alive, but it would take a long time for it to bear new fruit again.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of regret.</p><p>Bloodsoul Fruits were rare, and one had grown in the Seven Kills Domain, only to be destroyed in a beastly conflict.</p><p>Sensing a stranger’s presence, the birds became enraged, screeching as they charged towards Qin Sang.  A flash of light erupted from his body, revealing a speed that left the birds in the dust. With a few flickers, he vanished into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang barely paused on his journey, heading directly towards the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>The tower pierced the clouds, an unmistakable landmark.</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang stood on a hill, observing the activity around the tower.</p><p>Unlike last time, the area around the tower was quiet, not a soul in sight.</p><p>No Nascent Soul ancestors guarded the entrance, suggesting anyone could enter and exit freely.</p><p>But Qin Sang didn't rush.</p><p>This time, the Witch Clan not only had the Grand Witch Priest, but also the infamous Old Devil Fang. If chaos erupted, it would be no small matter, and he didn't want to be caught in it.</p><p>The experience of being caught in the crossfire between the Grand Witch Priest and the Devil Lord was still fresh in his memory.</p><p>Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag and stood beside Qin Sang, gazing up at the Heavenly Tower.</p><p>“Does this place look familiar to you?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Bai frowned, silent for a moment.  “I don’t remember. Perhaps that part of my memory is lost. I can’t recall anything. However, the contents of the jade slips you gave me have been somewhat helpful.”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly disappointed. “Those jade slips only record common knowledge of the current world, along with information about spiritual herbs and materials. They can't be of much help to you, can they?”</p><p>Bai said solemnly, “And those few corpse refinement techniques… I’ve even forgotten my past cultivation methods.  After occupying this body, I could only rely on my own exploration to improve, but I've encountered a bottleneck.  Coupled with the unresolved trouble of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I feel lost. These corpse refinement techniques have given me inspiration. Perhaps I can use external forces to help me break through forcibly.”</p><p>“Do you intend to continue your breakthrough and advance to Corpse King?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression grew serious. “How much certainty do you have? What if, after advancing to Corpse King, you lose control, and your original life essence is dispersed by the dense corpse Qi?”</p><p>Corpse Kings were apex refined corpses comparable in strength to Nascent Soul cultivators. Naturally born Corpse Kings were bloodthirsty and cruel, with fierce flames and bodies as hard as iron. Even Nascent Soul cultivators struggled against them, and their every appearance brought calamity.</p><p>Records of Corpse Kings appearing in the Small Cold Realm and the Canglang Sea were extremely rare. Even for those long-established corpse refining sects, refining a Corpse King was no easy task.</p><p>Bai had spent decades refining the Flying Night Devil’s body, reaching the verge of a breakthrough, only to encounter a bottleneck.</p><p>Qin Sang welcomed Bai's breakthrough; it would be like having another Nascent Soul-level helper.</p><p>But if the advancement led to the complete loss of Bai’s life essence, leaving no other choice but to become a Ghost Cultivator, there would be no need to seek the Heavenly Corpse Sect, rendering their previous agreement void.</p><p>Bai pondered for a while. “That's why I need to be cautious. I want to return to my human form. I certainly can’t destroy my remaining life essence. I need to carefully study various spiritual herbs and make multiple attempts. Perhaps I can find a way. I’ve been a lone ghost for so many years, and I’ve gained considerable experience in the path of Ghost Cultivation. After advancing to Corpse King, I have a 20% chance of suppressing the corpse Qi and protecting my life essence.  If I go further and become a Yin-Yang Heavenly魈, then there will be truly no turning back.”</p><p>“Yin-Yang Heavenly魈?  Those only exist in legends in the current world. But if you weren't aiming to regain your human form, you might truly have a chance to advance to Yin-Yang Heavenly魈…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Yin-Yang Heavenly魈 were Deity Transformation level refined corpses, said to possess incredibly profound Yin-Yang escape techniques, making them elusive and unpredictable.</p><p>Bai glanced at the Heavenly Tower again, seemingly disinterested. "I'll return to the Corpse Puppet Bag to avoid being seen by those with ulterior motives and causing trouble.  Please, when you have time, write down all the spiritual herbs and materials that can be found in the current world…"</p><p>Qin Sang waited a while longer, and seeing no unusual activity near the Heavenly Tower, he quietly approached, lingering nearby before flashing into the tower.</p><p>The familiar scene came into view. Everything inside the Heavenly Tower seemed normal.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He immediately and decisively spread his wings, but didn't rush to release his Two-Headed Green-Eyed Vulture avatar.</p><p>The puppets on each level of the tower no longer posed much of a threat to him. He could easily handle them alone.  What he needed to be wary of were the Nascent Soul cultivators who might appear at any moment.  His avatar and the Two-Headed Green-Eyed Vulture were his strongest assets.</p><p>Returning to the Heavenly Tower, Qin Sang moved with familiarity, quickly locating the ancient hall where the first-level teleportation formation was located.</p><p>His swordsmanship had improved, and his perception was clearer. The sword intent contained within the ancient hall likely originated from the same source as the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter."</p><p>"This time, I will pass through the Sword Path and see what secrets are hidden within this Heavenly Tower!"</p><p>Qin Sang silently surveyed the ancient hall, deploying his sword wheel to slay all the obstructing puppets before stepping into the teleportation formation.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang ascended the tower, reaching the fifth level without any obstacles.  The journey was remarkably smooth.</p>
