Chapter 197: Shangyuan Pure Palace


After boarding the treasure ship, Qin Sang was assigned to a narrow room; solid wooden walls surrounded him from the top, bottom, left, and right. It could only accommodate one person to sit and cultivate; it was hard to imagine how many spaces the treasure ship had been divided into in order to accommodate so many people.
Shangyuan Pure Palace was located north of Mount Zhaohua, and the distance between the two sects was not too far.
To the northeast of Shangyuan Pure Palace, near Mount Tiandian, was where the sect of the Pure Yang Sect was located. The Pure Yang Sect was powerful; after the fall of the demonic sect Blood God Sect, they had stubbornly blocked Mount Tiandian, causing the demonic sect to not dare to go south, and they had forcefully seized the southern part of Mount Tiandian from the demonic sect.
After Qin Sang obtained the geomancy map of the Lesser Cold Region, he discovered that the location of the Great Sui was northwest of the Pure Yang Sect's sect, and was also within the Pure Yang Sect's sphere of influence. That Immortal Master Han's family was likely a cultivation family that relied on the Pure Yang Sect, and controlled the surrounding countries like the Great Sui for the Pure Yang Sect.
The Pure Yang Sect had its own ancient teleportation array; although it could not directly enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, it could land near the ice field, and the Pure Yang Sect's Pure Gang City was being protected, and it was not on the same path as Shangyuan Pure Palace, so they would not come over.
In addition, the Taiyi Elixirs Sect was in the far northwest of the righteous sects' sphere of influence, and was west of the Heavenly Demon Mound, and north of the Extreme Northern Ice Field; they could go directly to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.
One could imagine the speed of a Nascent Soul cultivator's flight.
Qin Sang stayed in the room, and could not see outside; it only felt like a few hours had passed before the treasure ship beneath him shook slightly, and then his body felt light as it was thrown out of the treasure ship.
Immediately after, Qin Sang heard sounds of exclamation.
His sight returned, and Qin Sang looked around; this was no longer the Lesser Cold Region's Mount Zhaohua filled with continuous waters and towering peaks, but rather a celestial palace above the clouds.
They were currently standing on the peak of a large mountain; a huge platform had been artificially cut out of the mountain peak, and the surrounding mountains were continuous, with ancient trees reaching the sky, and the roars of beasts and birds rang out one after another.
On that horizon, there was a boundless sea of clouds.
Peaks reaching up to the clouds grew out of the sea of clouds, like lonely islands in the clouds; the lonely islands were surrounded by clouds and mist, and on them were countless palaces, jade railings, and carved cornices.
Cultivators were flying around on their tools, as if they were遨游 navigating in the clouds.
Celestial palaces above the clouds, as if they were a fairyland.
This was one of the eight righteous sects, Shangyuan Pure Palace.
Qin Sang looked at the magnificent scene before him with some admiration, and was moved; he lowered his head and looked around, then walked to the edge of the platform, and stepped off the platform.
He looked up again; the blue sky and bright sun,万里无云 without a single cloud.
He wondered what Martial Uncle Che's meaning was in placing them here; Qin Sang quietly looked around, and did not see where the ancient teleportation array was, or did not see any Shangyuan Pure Palace cultivators come out to receive them.
Just as Qin Sang was secretly puzzled, Che Yutao, who was standing at the front, suddenly raised his head to look at the sky, his gaze like electricity.
Then, one could vaguely see an old man in a green Daoist robe slowly coming from the depths of the sea of clouds; before the person arrived, a hearty laugh was heard.
"Old Man Che, I didn't expect you to personally lead the team; an old Daoist like me is unexpectedly going to defend Skull Pass with an uninteresting person like you; I'm afraid that the next few decades will be hard to endure!"
Che Yutao seemed to be very familiar with this person, and chuckled, responding tit-for-tat: "I see that your lifespan, Old Cow Nose, is about to end, and I'm afraid you won't make it another twenty years; after your ascension, this old man will definitely return your remains intact, don't be scared, don't be scared..."
Everyone only felt something flash before their eyes, and the old man had already stepped onto the platform; hearing Che Yutao's teasing, he helplessly shook his head, and pointed at him with a smile and a curse.
Che Yutao turned around to look at everyone, and said seriously: "This is Shangyuan Pure Palace's Xuan Yu Daoist, you can call him martial uncle."
He was mainly speaking to the Foundation Establishment cultivators like Qin Sang.
Shangyuan Pure Palace and Mount Zhaohua were closely related, and the disciples of the two sects were also very close to each other; some names were通用 common, and calling Xuan Yu Daoist martial uncle was not out of bounds.
Everyone quickly greeted him.
Xuan Yu Daoist nodded with a smile, and said: "Martial Brother Du has already gone to prepare the ancient teleportation array; I will first go and bring those loose cultivators and family disciples up, little brother, you can directly take them over there."
"Good!"
...
Everyone used their own methods, and followed behind Che Yutao, flying towards the sea of clouds; just as they flew to the edge of the sea of clouds, Qin Sang felt a layer of invisible restriction quietly open, and understood that it was likely Shangyuan Pure Palace's protective sect array.
Che Yutao seemed to be very familiar with Shangyuan Pure Palace, and their journey was smooth; along the way, they met some Shangyuan Pure Palace disciples, who curiously looked them over.
Passing through the lonely islands in the clouds, they finally arrived at the depths of Shangyuan Pure Palace, at a "lonely island" that was not small.

The entire "solitary island" had been covered by a grand hall, outside the entrance of which stood a Foundation Establishment cultivator. When the group arrived, this man stepped forward and respectfully said, "Fellow Disciple Che, Steward Du is in the process of activating the ancient teleportation array. Please come with this humble one."
Qin Sang followed him into the grand hall to find it extremely spacious. In the rear of the grand hall, there were four teleportation arrays lined up in a row: one large and three small, all set far apart from each other.
He had finally seen the legendary teleportation array.
Qin Sang curiously surveyed it.
The largest teleportation array should be the ancient teleportation array that directly led to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, while the other three were small teleportation arrays that were constructed by Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace itself.
Sure enough, there was a considerable difference between the two.
Based on size alone, the ancient teleportation array was comparable to more than ten small teleportation arrays combined. The octagonal array disk was extremely ancient, and each of its eight corners pointed to one of the eight trigrams. Ancient runes and restrictions covered it densely, making people feel dizzy.
Qin Sang felt somewhat dizzy from merely looking at just a small segment of its restrictions. He couldn't help but be shocked: just how was this spirit array constructed?
In contrast, both the structures and the runes and restrictions of the three small teleportation arrays were much simpler and cruder than the ancient teleportation array.
Not only were the transmission distances of these teleportation arrays shorter, but if an enemy had a means of sealing space, they would also become ineffective. The fact that Shangyuan Pure Serenity Palace had built three of them suggested that they must have a special purpose.
Standing behind the ancient teleportation array was a stern-looking, middle-aged man, who should have been the Du cultivator. He had placed his palm over the core restriction of the teleportation array and was currently pouring spiritual energy into it in order to activate the ancient teleportation array's restrictions.
Activating the teleportation array did not require a great deal of spiritual energy. After waiting calmly for a few moments, everyone saw the ancient restrictions on the teleportation array suddenly begin to spin rapidly.
The sound of "Om" filled the air as this spirit array, which had existed for an unknown number of years, caused the entire grand hall to seem to shake.
Next, the Du cultivator opened his other palm, revealing eight medium-grade spirit stones in his hand.
With a flick of his wrist, the eight spirit stones landed on the eight corners of the teleportation array, respectively.
"Hong!"
Suddenly, a massive and dazzling beam of light shot out from the array disk before being swiftly restrained by the restrictions that had come with the ancient teleportation array itself. Divine light swirled like an ancient gate of light, exuding a mysterious air.
Qin Sang was greatly surprised to find out that activating the teleportation required so many medium-grade spirit stones.
The Du cultivator withdrew his hand and looked at the group.
"Fellow Disciple Du!"
Che Yutao greeted him with his hands cupped despite Xuan Yu Daoist's nonchalance.
