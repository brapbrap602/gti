<h1>Chapter 1749: Establishing the Prison</h1><p>Qin Sang stood up at some point, gazing intently at the altar beneath the female cultivator, his eyes gleaming with curiosity.  </p><p>This altar seemed to possess the ability to stabilize spiritual energy. The female cultivator's aura clearly indicated a mid-stage Golden Core cultivation, yet her internal true essence showed no signs of disorder!  </p><p>With his keen insight, Qin Sang could naturally discern that the key likely lay in the altar beneath her and the slowly rotating "Proclamation to All Spirits Seal" within it.  </p><p>Though the Proclamation to All Spirits Seal was small, even in a battlefield teeming with demonic soldiers, no one could overlook this spiritual seal.  </p><p>It was evident that this seal was not a physical one. Most of its body, including the seal knob, was indistinct, only vaguely revealing its shape. Yet, it radiated a brilliant spiritual light, seemingly adorned with cloud-like inscriptions, thunder patterns, phoenix symbols, and dragon scriptsâ€”divine artifacts that rarely revealed themselves to mortals.  </p><p>Only the four large characters at the bottom, "Proclamation to All Spirits," were exceptionally clear, surrounded by intricate and mysterious runic patterns.  </p><p>The female cultivator was bathed in golden light, as if clad in golden armor, exuding an extraordinary aura of immense authority that made it difficult for others to look directly at her.  </p><p>Moreover, the altar's function was not limited to this!  </p><p>At this moment, a thick fog enveloped the river, obscuring the aerial confrontation from mortal eyes. The people, gripped by fear, knew all too well the adage that when immortals clash, mortals suffer. They abandoned their homes and fled in panic, leaving White Dragon Crossing nearly deserted.  </p><p>Qin Sang, too, went with the flow, leaving White Dragon Crossing with the elderly man and the young boy. However, his Celestial Eye Butterfly remained fixed on the battlefield.  </p><p>He saw clearly that the two squads of water snake soldiers had emerged from the altar in formation after the female cultivator issued her command.  </p><p>Like the three squads of wolf soldiers hidden in the marshes, Qin Sang had only sensed the presence of the female cultivator on the solitary peak earlier, with no trace of the two squads of water snake soldiers.  </p><p>Before the wolf soldiers revealed themselves, a fleeting glimpse of an altar had also appeared within the black smoke.  </p><p>This indicated that the altar also had the ability to nurture and store soldiers.  </p><p>This technique reminded Qin Sang of the beast-taming sects in the Storm Realm, such as the Spirit Taming Sect of the North Star Realm, but there were significant differences.  </p><p>Cultivators of the Spirit Taming Sect would choose a compatible demon beast upon entering the Dao, forming a life-bound contract. The two would become as one, with the demon beast referred to as their life-bound spirit beast.  </p><p>Apart from their life-bound spirit beast, they might also raise a few other spirit beasts with unique abilities for use in battle, but the numbers were usually limited. Most could not afford to raise an army of demon soldiers, as it would hinder their own cultivation progress.  </p><p>The cultivation of spirit beasts was not achieved effortlessly. Qin Sang himself had spent considerable effort raising a few fourth-transformation spirit insects, gathering the treasures they needed for their cultivation. It was only after receiving the "Panhu True Scripture" that things improved.  </p><p>The two squads of water snake soldiers before him were not only well-disciplined and obedient, but their cultivation levels were also impressive.  </p><p>Especially the leaders of the two squads, whose cultivation was only slightly inferior to the female cultivator's, both being early-stage demon core snake demons.  </p><p>Under the leaders' command were several spirit-level water snakes, with over a hundred mortal-level water snake soldiers under their jurisdiction.  </p><p>The two squads of water snake soldiers were tightly arrayed, led by two water snake demon generals, with the female cultivator as the axis. Their auras were interconnected, forming a unified whole, subtly hinting at a mysterious formation with immense power. This was no ordinary military formation.  </p><p>At this moment, only two gates were open. What would it be like if all eight gates were opened? What if the altar master was at the Nascent Soul or even the Deity Transformation stage, or higher?  </p><p>Could it be that a single cultivator in this realm could command an army of thousands?  </p><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.  </p><p>Of course, he understood well that summoning and training demon soldiers, ensuring their unwavering loyalty and absolute obedience, was far from as simple as it appeared.  </p><p>Finally encountering a cultivator from this realm, Qin Sang felt a slight relief upon seeing a method to resolve the chaotic spiritual energy. At the same time, he grew increasingly curious about the cultivators of this realm. In the Storm Realm, cultivators focused on self-cultivation, and such scenes were rarely seen.  </p><p>However, if he were asked to train an army, he would be reluctant. Why would cultivators in this realm expend so much energy on military forces? Were they not afraid of hindering their own cultivation progress? Or was there some other benefit?  </p><p>As Qin Sang pondered this, another change occurred on the river.  </p><p>After her stern questioning, the female cultivator did not wait for the wolf demon's response. The wolf demon had dared to openly harm the river god under her jurisdiction, a crime punishable by death!  </p><p>Moreover, this squad of wolf soldiers was clearly a rogue army.  </p><p>Rogue armies were originally under the command of a Daoist priest. Due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the priest's death without a disciple to inherit their legacy, or the army rebelling against their master, the priest might lose control, leading to the altar's destruction and the army's escape, becoming a rogue force.  </p><p>Rogue armies with benign natures would not pose significant threats. However, wolf soldiers like these, who feasted on blood and dared to attack water palaces and city gods, were likely rebellious troops from a destroyed altar.  </p><p>Any disciple of the Daoist sects had the responsibility to slay demons and subdue monsters, reclaiming the altar!  </p><p>The female cultivator formed hand seals, her feet tracing the steps of Yu the Great, moving swiftly as if treading on stars.  </p><p>At her command, the leaders of the two squads of water snake soldiers vigorously shook their banners, releasing waves of watery light that infused the water snake soldiers. The soldiers roared in unison, their voices shaking the mountains.  </p><p>The watery light connected, forming a celestial river that coiled above the river, enveloping all the water snake soldiers.  </p><p>The water snake soldiers drifted within the river, their bodies faintly glowing with golden light under the blazing sun, their demonic auras interconnected.  </p><p>Then, one of the water snake demon generals raised his banner, pointing it skyward, while the other pointed toward the struggling White Dragon Lord on the river.  </p><p>The formation of the water snake soldiers shifted, and the celestial river suddenly surged upward, darkening the sky.  </p><p>The sun disappeared, replaced by an azure water sword hanging inverted above the river, its blue light spreading across the mountains and rivers. The sword's tip trembled slightly, pointing directly at the giant wolf.  </p><p>At the same time, a loud splash echoed from the river as the water beneath the White Dragon Lord surged, forming a mass of cold air that instantly froze into an ice pillar, encasing the White Dragon Lord.  </p><p>This move was to protect the White Dragon Lord, preventing the wolf demon from resorting to desperate measures.  </p><p>Though the female cultivator's cultivation far surpassed the wolf demon's, she remained extremely cautious.  </p><p>The wolf demon had no time to react, watching helplessly as its prey was frozen and sank to the riverbed.  </p><p>Simultaneously, the azure magical sword trembled lightly, shooting down like lightning.  </p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. The power of this sword strike was comparable to that of a late-stage Golden Core cultivator!  </p><p>Unexpectedly, the wolf demon showed no fear, allowing the female cultivator to rescue the White Dragon Lord. It looked up at the sky, letting out a series of cold laughs.  </p><p>"Altar Master? So you're a high-ranking official from the Celestial Pivot Court. I've caught a big fish today. My apologies! My apologies!"  </p><p>The wolf demon let out a strange howl, its hooves stomping heavily as an altar suddenly appeared beneath it.  </p><p>The demon had clearly used some method to conceal the altar earlier, only revealing it now that its true target had arrived.  </p><p>This altar was similar in structure to the female cultivator's, also divided into three layers with four pillars and ten directions and eight gates. However, floating within it was a spiritual banner.  </p><p>The banner was damaged, and the altar's pillars were tilted, making it appear even more dilapidated compared to the female cultivator's altar.  </p><p>Yet, the spiritual banner within this altar was more solid than the female cultivator's Proclamation to All Spirits Seal.  </p><p>As soon as the altar appeared, two gates opened, and black smoke billowed out, revealing two more squads of black wolf demon soldiers. Among them were three demon core-stage giant wolves, dozens of black-furred demon wolves, and over a hundred miscellaneous soldiers including foxes, jackals, and tigers.  </p><p>Seeing the altar beneath the black wolf's feet, the female cultivator's eyes flashed with surprise. "The Danxiao Banner, the Ascendant Mystic Rank?"  </p><p>She was currently only at the mid-stage of the Cave Spirit Rank. Only after achieving great success in her cultivation could she reach the Ascendant Mystic Rank.  </p><p>In the Celestial Pivot Court, the Ascendant Mystic Rank was equivalent to the rank of a chief altar master, a fifth-grade official with the honorary title of Supreme Purity Mystic Capital Grand Master. This demon was actually a soldier under a True Lord's command!  </p><p>The several squads of wolf soldiers merged into one.  </p><p>Among the three wolf generals, one was at the mid-stage of the demon core, leading the elite troops, while the other two were at the early stage, managing the miscellaneous soldiers.  </p><p>The three generals coordinated seamlessly. At the giant wolf's command, they howled in unison, spewing thick black smoke. The demons within shifted their formation, disappearing into the smoke, their figures flickering, mysterious and unpredictable.  </p><p>The black smoke coalesced and dispersed, forming a majestic celestial wolf dozens of feet tall. It opened its mouth wide, swallowing the magical sword in one gulp.  </p><p>A faint blue light flickered within the celestial wolf's belly before fading away.  </p><p>The celestial wolf grinned wickedly, licking its fangs as if savoring a delicious meal. It shook its head and lunged toward the water snake soldiers' formation.  </p><p>The giant wolf remained unharmed, sneering at the female cultivator. It seemed to have broken free from some shackles, its aura skyrocketing, soon matching the female cultivator's and continuing to rise.  </p><p>The female cultivator's expression changed slightly. Though she had anticipated that the giant wolf's origins were not simple, she had not expected it to be a rogue soldier who had seized a True Lord's altar.  </p><p>However, she did not panic.  </p><p>The strongest generals under a True Lord's command would have followed the True Lord for many years and were almost impossible to betray.  </p><p>The altar beneath the giant wolf was damaged, and the Danxiao Banner was in tatters. It was likely that the True Lord had faced a powerful enemy, suffered severe injuries, and the giant wolf had taken advantage of the situation.  </p><p>In such a case, the True Lord's personal guards were probably already dead, and the giant wolf's cultivation might not be as high as it seemed.  </p><p>She was a high-ranking official of the Celestial Pivot Court, in charge of a branch altar, with authority over all the local deities.  </p><p>The female cultivator remained calm in the face of danger, suddenly changing her steps. Her body swayed like a willow, her feet tracing the stars as she pointed into the air, swiftly drawing a spiritual talisman. The talisman transformed into a streak of light, instantly merging into the treasure seal on the altar.  </p><p>The treasure seal erupted with golden light, and the female cultivator's clear incantation echoed through the heavens and earth.  </p><p>"By the decree of the Divine Firmament, I command the soldiers of the palace.  </p><p>Earth gods and local deities, all obey my orders.  </p><p>With a single talisman, all is united.  </p><p>Where the talisman reaches, all gods shall follow!  </p><p>Quickly!"  </p><p>The incantation resonated like divine words, spreading invisibly in all directions.  </p><p>As soon as the incantation was uttered, all city gods, earth gods, mountain gods, and water gods within the jurisdiction of the branch altar would receive the talisman's summons and must immediately send troops to assist, or else face punishment.  </p><p>The first to respond were naturally the soldiers of the White Dragon Lord's palace.  </p><p>The White Dragon Lord had not yet escaped, and his soldiers dared not disobey the summons. Coincidentally, the white wolf soldiers they had been entangled with retreated, allowing them to quickly ride the waves upward, joining the water snake soldiers.  </p><p>The city god arriving from downstream also received the summons, hurriedly commanding his troops to accelerate.  </p><p>From afar, a divine light pierced through the sky.  </p><p>At the same time, across the mountains, lakes, and seas near Floating Dragon City, as well as the capital of Nine Dragons City and the surrounding nations, all within the jurisdiction of the female cultivator's branch altar, sensed the summons.  </p><p>However, those too far away might not make it in time. Only the nearby mountains and cities raised their banners, riding divine light as they rushed toward the scene.  </p><p>As the female cultivator issued the summons,  </p><p>the two water snake demon generals shook their banners once more. The sky brightened abruptly, and the overwhelming water mist pressed down, momentarily halting the celestial wolf. Then, they led their troops to soar high, forming a formation around the altar.  </p><p>The water snake demon generals continuously waved their banners, and the water snake soldiers obeyed their commands. In an instant, streams of watery light rose, forming a transparent token that hovered above the altar.  </p><p>The token trembled slightly, and the celestial river reappeared, this time hidden but not unleashed, encircling the demon soldiers like a celestial serpent with its head and tail connected. With the token's enhancement, its power was clearly far greater than before.  </p><p>Knowing that this was a trap set by the giant wolf, targeting her, the female cultivator immediately adopted a defensive stance.  </p><p>The celestial river enveloped the demon soldiers and the altar, swiftly rushing downstream to join forces with the city god.  </p><p>Though her strength was slightly inferior to this group of wolf soldiers, she was not afraid. As long as she held out until the temple soldiers arrived and surrounded them, they would have no chance of escape.  </p><p>Just as this thought crossed her mind, the female cultivator's expression changed drastically.  </p><p>The giant wolf's cultivation had been rapidly increasing and had now reached the peak of the demon core stage, showing no signs of stopping.  </p><p>*Crack...*  </p><p>The giant wolf twisted its head, its bones cracking loudly. Its aura surged once more, instantly breaking through to the Transformation stage.  </p><p>"Roar!"  </p><p>The wolf's howl shook the heavens, startling both gods and ghosts.  </p><p>The giant wolf transformed into a black light, darting into the black smoke. "My minions, follow me to capture this tender-skinned human. We'll boil her for wine, and the blood feast in this kingdom is ours for the taking!"  </p><p>*Howl howl howl...*  </p><p>Excited wolf howls echoed from within the black smoke.  </p><p>With the giant wolf personally commanding the altar, the wolf soldiers' morale soared. Endless black smoke converged into the celestial wolf's body.  </p><p>In the blink of an eye, the celestial wolf grew to a hundred feet tall, its body comparable to a mountain, majestic and awe-inspiring. Its breath could summon wind and thunder, and its exhalation could shake mountains and rivers.  </p><p>Downstream on the great river,  </p><p>banners stood like a forest, belonging to the divine soldiers of Floating Dragon City's city god temple.  </p><p>The city god was not a demon but a young man in his thirties, with a fair complexion and a short beard. He wore a black gauze official hat and a blue robe, his features sharp and imposing, exuding authority.  </p><p>He had come in response to the summons, but upon seeing the towering celestial wolf in the distance, he was struck with terror.  </p><p>Though he was the city god of this region, his cultivation was only slightly stronger than the White Dragon Lord's. Facing a Transformation-stage demon with countless demon soldiers under its command, how could he not be afraid?  </p><p>If the deities of Nine Dragons Kingdom could arrive in time, they might be able to deal with the evil demon. But with only the deities of his city, even under the command of the Celestial Pivot Court's high-ranking official, they were likely no match for the demon.  </p><p>Thinking this, the city god's heart wavered.  </p><p>"Rather than going to my death, it's better to preserve myself and quickly report to my superiors. That way, I can atone for my crimes..."  </p><p>However, with the summons in place, he had no choice but to comply.  </p><p>With a change of heart, the city god mounted his divine chariot, pointing forward and ordering his troops to hasten to the aid without delay.  </p><p>Seated on the chariot, his expression stiffened slightly as a cold wind quietly slipped into the mountains.  </p><p>The soldiers, unaware of his thoughts, dared not disobey and flew toward the battlefield with trepidation.  </p><p>At that moment, the celestial wolf easily caught up to the female cultivator, opening its massive mouth and sucking in a torrent of river water like a silken ribbon. The riverbed was exposed in an instantâ€”a single breath had severed the river!  </p><p>The protective celestial river also churned violently, waves surging, and the token trembled uncontrollably.  </p><p>The female cultivator's face paled slightly as she hurriedly cast talismans. The demon soldiers continuously shifted their formation, sending streams of light toward the token to stabilize the celestial river.  </p><p>Unexpectedly, the celestial wolf leaped forward, bringing with it a foul wind as it pounced.  </p><p>"Is that person still not going to make a move?"  </p><p>Qin Sang, who had been observing the battlefield from afar, glanced toward the solitary peak where the female cultivator had previously hidden.  </p><p>While on the boat, he had detected two people hiding on the peak, one of whom had an obscure aura comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.  </p><p>If this person was the female cultivator's master, the time was ripe for him to act.  </p><p>As expected, just as he shifted his gaze, he saw a faint glimmer of light rise from the mountain, followed by a resonant voice echoing through the heavens.  </p><p>"Fire and water intertwine, the celestial prison awakens.  </p><p>Subdue demons and capture ghosts, reveal the evil's form.  </p><p>Quickly!"  </p><p>On both banks of the great river, atop the peaks, four celestial pillars hundreds of feet tall suddenly rose, sealing the female cultivator and the wolf soldiers within.  </p><p>Inside the pillars, one side was crimson with rolling flames, while the other was pale with chilling cold</p>
