<h1>Chapter 934: A Fierce Battle Against Three</h1><p>Qin Sang and his avatar attacked simultaneously.  Any other Core Formation cultivator would have fared no better than the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, although the nonchalant expression on Bai's face vanished, he still showed little fear.</p><p>"Could he be confident in facing both me and my avatar at the same time?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Many of his techniques, such as the Bloodlight Divine Radiance, were ineffective against Bai.</p><p>Treasures like the Star Conch were also restricted.</p><p>Bai occupied the Yaksha's body, a refined corpse, and seemed able to freely detach from it. Even if the Star Conch could severely injure the body, it might not harm Bai's spectral form.  Moreover, the Yaksha had been controlled by Bai for so long that no one knew what changes had occurred. Its previous weaknesses might no longer exist.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he urged the sword wheel with all his might.</p><p>Blood Qi surged from his avatar, and the blood sword, seemingly exhilarated, erupted in a blinding crimson light. A several-meter-long streak of blood-red sword Qi slashed out, whistling through the air.</p><p>The metallic scent of blood filled the air.</p><p>Bai, observing the attacks of Qin Sang and his avatar, remained motionless, extraordinarily calm.  He swung both arms, attempting to fight both Qin Sang and the avatar single-handedly.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh...*</p><p>Shadows of ghost claws filled the sky like a massive black wave, surging towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Having already tested the power of the ghost claws, Qin Sang and his avatar didn't hesitate. They poured more True Essence into their flying swords.  Both swords emitted clear, resonant hums, cutting through everything in their path.</p><p>The barrier formed by the ghost claws didn't hold for long. Countless ghost claws were annihilated under the mighty sword Qi, steadily retreating.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai's face remained devoid of anxiety.</p><p>He took a deep breath, corpse Qi seething within him.  A faint layer of corpse Qi appeared on his body, accompanied by a strange fluctuation. Looking closely, one could see that the corpse Qi was a pale white, very similar to the surrounding ghost mist.</p><p>For decades, Bai had been refining this body.</p><p>Before the Yaksha was seized, the corpse Qi within was refined from Earthly Yin Qi, appearing darker than the ghost mist.</p><p>*Bang, bang!*  The sounds continued as the ghost claws were shattered by the two flying swords, the barrier thinning rapidly.</p><p>At that moment, Bai suddenly let out a low growl.  The corpse Qi within him erupted without warning, transforming into grayish-white chains that shot into the depths of the surrounding ghost mist.  Strange runes appeared on the chains.</p><p>Instantly, the ghost mist churned.</p><p>The atmosphere changed dramatically.</p><p>The ghost mist, stirred by the corpse Qi, surged madly towards Bai, forming a whirlwind of ghost mist where he stood.</p><p>The whirlwind spread, collapsing bone mountains and shattering skeletons.</p><p>The startled wraiths roared in fury, but sensing the terrifying aura emanating from the clash, they instinctively recoiled in fear, only daring to circle the periphery, not venturing closer.</p><p>During the earlier battle, wraiths had already gathered outside, their rising and falling howls seeming to cheer on both sides.</p><p>Now, these wraiths, along with new ones, were bound by the chains and pulled into the ghost mist whirlwind.</p><p>The mist spun frantically, emitting chilling howls. Its momentum was terrifying, like a white silk ribbon covering the sky.</p><p>Bai muttered a few words, his eyes flashing. He abruptly waved his hand.</p><p>With a deafening roar, the ghost mist whirlwind slammed down towards Qin Sang and his avatar. The irresistible whirlwind seemed capable of crushing everything.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed.  Bai had used some unknown technique to manipulate the ghost mist and gather the power of the wraiths.</p><p>The pressure from the ghost mist whirlwind tightened his chest. Without hesitation, he flew backward, ordering his avatar to retreat with him, temporarily avoiding the attack.</p><p>The whirlwind struck, engulfing the sword wheel and the blood-red sword Qi.</p><p>The sword wheel was forced into a defensive position, the blood sword vibrating constantly, seemingly suppressed.</p><p>In the next moment, Bai's eyes shifted, and his figure vanished, merging into the ghost mist.  Ignoring the avatar, he flickered several times, heading straight for Qin Sang's main body.</p><p>Then, with a sudden palm strike, empowered by the ghost mist, he unleashed a grayish-white giant palm that crashed down.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, retreating while flicking his wrist.  The Concentric Rings passed through the giant palm, appearing above Bai's head.</p><p>Then, the treasure flashed, and the Twin-Headed Flood Dragon sprang out. With a shake, it split into several illusions, all baring fangs and claws, lunging at Bai's face.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The Twin-Headed Flood Dragon's attack landed. Bai's body tumbled in mid-air, retreating to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>Suddenly attacked, Bai was forced to defend, his offensive faltering. Qin Sang and his avatar seized the opportunity to escape the ghost mist whirlwind, retrieving their flying swords and retreating.</p><p>"You also have a spirit beast?"</p><p>Bai was even more surprised, clearly not expecting Qin Sang to be so difficult.</p><p>His eyes flickered, pressing his advantage without hesitation, urging the ghost mist to attack again.</p><p>In an instant, both sides were locked in combat.</p><p>The battlefield shifted back and forth.</p><p>The ghost mist whirlwind, having swallowed the wraiths, raged everywhere, blood-red and cyan light flashing within.</p><p>Bai displayed his power, hiding within the depths of the ghost mist, making him difficult to target.</p><p>Qin Sang grew more apprehensive as the fight continued. He, his avatar, and the Twin-Headed Flood Dragon, equivalent to three late-Core Formation cultivators, hadn't gained any significant advantage.</p><p>"I told you, as long as we're in this space, you'll never be able to defeat me."</p><p>Bai's voice echoed from the ghost mist, slightly ethereal.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a disdainful snort.  "Stop your pretentious nonsense! Manipulating the ghost mist and spirits must be a tremendous burden.  With your strength, you definitely can't maintain it for long!  Moreover, you haven't fully taken over this body!"</p><p>During the intense battle, Bai couldn't perfectly conceal his flaws.  In a moment of carelessness, Qin Sang noticed a clue.  The Yaksha's Nascent Soul, and the soul mark he had left on it, seemed not to have been completely refined by Bai.</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. He didn't know if it was the effect of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman or because his soul mark contained the Jade Buddha's aura.</p><p>The last time he came to the Seven Kill Hall, Bai must have been very weak, not even daring to face him.</p><p>Now, Bai could fight three strong opponents, but only a few decades had passed.  It was entirely possible that he hadn't had time to fully refine the Yaksha.</p><p>If the Yaksha's Nascent Soul still existed, when Bai weakened, he could try to regain control of the Yaksha.</p><p>As if his weakness had been exposed, Bai remained silent for a moment before speaking, "You are indeed perceptive, but can you wait until I'm exhausted? Although I don't know what the outside is like, someone appears every few years and then leaves quickly. Presumably, you can't stay here for long either, unless you plan to be trapped here with me."</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>The battle continued. With the help of his avatar and the Twin-Headed Flood Dragon, Qin Sang relentlessly attacked the depths of the ghost mist, searching for Bai's true body.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's apparent agreement, Bai's spirits lifted.  "Since neither of us can defeat the other, why don't we stop fighting and discuss a deal that benefits us both?"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't answer, sneering inwardly as he secretly formed hand seals, the faint sounds of wind and thunder emanating from within him.</p>
