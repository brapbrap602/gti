Chapter 332: The Pursuit


The exchange meeting proceeded swiftly, concluding in less than an hour. Both hosts and guests were satisfied. The old man, having made a substantial profit, beamed at everyone.  The participants departed through a hidden passage, emerging not at the original stone hut but in a narrow alley, a testament to the old man's caution. Upon leaving the alley, everyone dispersed, heading their separate ways.

Despite his assertive demeanor at the secret market, Qin Sang knew his display of strength wouldn't deter truly formidable cultivators.  He remained cautious, wary of being followed.

The moonless night was dark. Even cultivators were influenced by the diurnal rhythm of the mortal world, rarely venturing out at night unless necessary. Most returned to their rented stone huts for cultivation.

A large figure suddenly appeared in the deserted alley: the masked, powerfully built man.  His actions contrasted sharply with his imposing physique. He moved cautiously, constantly looking over his shoulder, as wary as a timid mouse.

The alley led directly out of Stone Island.

Reaching the edge without incident, the man activated his escape technique, melting into the night and quietly leaving the island.

Shortly after his departure, the space at the end of the alley shimmered, revealing a blurry figure that quickly transformed into a streak of faint light, following after him.

But this individual was unaware that, like a mantis stalking a cicada, there was another predator lurking nearby.

After this second figure vanished, a third emerged – Qin Sang. He gazed at the murky swamp, pondered for a moment, and then activated the recently acquired Shadow Cloud, departing silently.

The alley, having witnessed the passage of three figures, finally fell still.

The fleeting sense of familiarity he experienced outside the auction house hadn't initially troubled Qin Sang. It had come and gone too quickly.

However, at the secret market, the masked man's true voice, inadvertently revealed in a moment of urgency, rekindled that familiarity, stirring a memory buried deep within Qin Sang, a memory from decades past.

The voice wasn't an exact match. After so many years, time and circumstances change people.

People grow older, their voices change.

But for cultivators, this process is much slower than for mortals.

Thus, although the man's voice had become rougher and more weathered, its fundamental timbre retained a trace of its former self, the source of Qin Sang's familiarity.

Searching his memories, Qin Sang suddenly recalled a name, someone he'd never expected to encounter again.

Tan Hao!

Back in the Unyielding Mountain Market, Tan Hao had spoken up for him against a dishonest merchant, allowing Qin Sang to purchase the "Underworld Scripture" with its accompanying incantations at a reasonable price.

After joining the Gloom Yin Sect, Tan Hao dedicated himself to cultivation within his cave, rarely seen.

While Qin Sang was close with Tan Hao's younger brother, Tan Jie, he wasn't particularly acquainted with Tan Hao himself.

The more he thought about it, the more convinced Qin Sang became.  Tan Hao had been tall even as a youth, in stark contrast to his brother. As an adult, he would undoubtedly be even more imposing.

But this realization only deepened Qin Sang's bewilderment. How could it be him?

After the Gloom Yin Sect's failed invasion of the Yuanzhao School, the sect scattered like fallen leaves. Tan Hao and Tan Jie hadn't been sent as spies to the Yuanzhao School, nor had they been chosen as sacrifices like Shi Hong.

When the Gloom Yin Sect fell, the Yin Sha Abyss was no longer controlled, and the Yuanzhao School wouldn't relentlessly pursue low-level disciples.  Escape was indeed possible.

But escape didn't guarantee survival; this was the insidious nature of the Gloom Yin Sect and the Yama Banners.

Once cultivators began using the Yama Banner cultivation technique, they had only two paths:

One was to cultivate diligently to the tenth level of Qi Refining, be devoured by Yama, and become the host soul of the Yama Banner. The other was to detect the dangers of the Yama Banner early on and disperse their cultivation to start anew.

When the Gloom Yin Sect fell, Tan Hao was already in his twenties.  Given his talent, if he had dispersed his cultivation and started again as a rogue cultivator, his chances of reaching Foundation Establishment were practically nonexistent.

Moreover, even if Tan Hao had recognized the dangers of the Yama Banner, he might not have been able to abandon it. The allure of Soul Core cultivation wasn't something everyone could resist.

If Sun De hadn't offered himself up, Qin Sang might never have understood the secrets of the Yama Banner.

Qin Sang had assumed that Tan Jie, Shi Hong, and the others were all dead. To suddenly encounter someone who resembled Tan Hao brought both surprise and a flicker of joy.

He hadn't made many friends since embarking on the path of cultivation. In the Gloom Yin Sect, he, Tan Jie, and Shi Hong had supported each other, forging a strong bond.

A reunion with an old friend.  Yet Qin Sang didn't reveal himself.

Firstly, he was now a disciple of Mount Shaohua. He couldn't risk exposing his past with the Gloom Yin Sect. Even if he acknowledged his friend, he would need a disguise.

Secondly, after all these years, was Tan Hao still the same person? Had his character changed? Was he still the same impulsive youth who stood up for what was right?

The ambush a year ago remained vivid in his mind.

Yu Daiyue's drastic transformation wasn't due to his inherent nature; it was the result of being driven to desperation by his cultivation bottleneck.

How many others like Yu Daiyue existed in the cultivation world?

More importantly, was Tan Hao still connected to remnants of the Gloom Yin Sect?

Tan Hao's unusual cultivation level made Qin Sang wary.  He decided to follow him, to observe Tan Hao's current situation.

The events at the auction house and the secret market clearly indicated that Tan Hao's cultivation journey wasn't going smoothly. He likely suffered from soul injuries and was spending everything he had on healing pills, a situation somewhat similar to Wandering Scholar's.

However, Tan Hao was far more impoverished than Wandering Scholar.  He lacked the backing of the Taiyi Pill Sect and his artifacts were several grades inferior.

During the struggle for the Tranquility Pill, the best artifact he could produce in his desperation was only a high-grade one.

Qin Sang remembered Tan Hao's act of kindness in the Unyielding Mountain Market. If possible, he wouldn't hesitate to lend a hand.

There was another reason. If Tan Hao was still linked to the Gloom Yin Sect, Qin Sang could use him to track down the sect's remnants.

Having broken through to mid-stage Foundation Establishment, equipped with several artifacts and a talisman treasure, he was no longer the naive youth he once was. Unless he encountered a fake Core Formation Gloom Yin Sect devil, the outcome of a fight was uncertain.

The sooner he dealt with the Heart-Eating Worm, the better.

And then there were the Yama Banners. He only possessed six. Perhaps by finding the Gloom Yin Sect remnants, he could gather all ten and complete the Ten Directions Yama Formation.

…

As he followed Tan Hao, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.  Careful observation revealed another person secretly trailing Tan Hao.

The masked man who had competed with Tan Hao for the Tranquility Pill.

His purpose in following Tan Hao was obvious.

At the time, the masked man had readily relinquished the Tranquility Pill, giving no indication of his malicious intent.  Truly, a biting dog doesn't bark.

The masked man, cautiously tracking Tan Hao, was completely unaware of his own pursuer.

Qin Sang immediately shifted his focus to the masked man.

The three figures, forming a strange procession, left Stone Island one after another, entering the treacherous swamp.
