<h1>Chapter 2032:  Equal Blessing of the Rain and Dew</h1><p>“Gao!”</p><p>The incantation, resonant as thunder, reverberated within his heart.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his astonishment, completely immersed in the incantation's strange rhythm.</p><p>He seemed to be back on the mountaintop altar, towering over the land.  A shaman led his tribal people below, offering devout prayers to Heaven.</p><p>As the incantation echoed through the mountains, a fierce wind swept across the plains, carrying sand and stones.</p><p>The twilight glow gradually faded into the gathering storm clouds, until the last ray of sunlight was swallowed, and darkness enveloped the land.</p><p>Night fell, but the plains remained restless, an unsettling atmosphere permeating the air.</p><p>The wild beasts ceased their howls, restlessly pawing the ground. Smaller creatures frantically fled to their burrows, trembling with fear.</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing wail echoed across the plains, followed by the roar of a predator.</p><p>The roars ignited chaos.</p><p>In the darkness, the torches around the altar provided the only light.  Illuminated by the flames, the mountain seemed a sacred peak, capable of communicating with Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Countless beasts fought around it, yet none dared approach the mountain.  As the incantation grew louder, they seemed to be stirred by a primal fear deep within their souls, desperately fleeing.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The wind whipped up more clouds.</p><p>The flames flickered violently but stubbornly illuminated the altar.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>Above the clouds, lightning danced, the rumbling thunder seeming to echo the incantation.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Torrential rain poured down.</p><p>The figures below the altar remained motionless in the downpour. The incantation grew louder. The shaman ascended the steps, dancing alone; his movements were powerful and full of energy.</p><p>The torches were extinguished, but in the flashes of lightning, his silhouette was imprinted on Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed sacrificial dances before; the Ghost Mother had danced one during her ascension.  These were two very different dances.  He desperately wanted to see clearly, but the more urgent he became, the blurrier it grew, reminding him this was not reality.</p><p>Scenes, both illusory and yet incredibly real, appeared in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>When the atmosphere of the ritual reached its peak, the incantation and the thunder merged, and the wind, rain, and lightning, representing the power of Heaven and Earth, converged above the altar.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt his body explode, transforming into countless tiny particles, involuntarily rising, merging with the wind, rain, clouds, and lightning, becoming one with nature.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>A series of loud bangs echoed in his heart, as if touching the pulse of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to consider the source of these sounds. At this moment, he sensed a powerful presence.</p><p>As vast as the sky, as heavy as the earth.</p><p>As his body drew close to this presence, it was like returning to his mother's embrace – incredibly warm, incredibly comforting, almost lulling him into forgetting everything, completely merging with it.</p><p>He felt this unknown presence, and also sensed a strange energy floating in the void. Every particle of his body was immersed in this energy.</p><p>This energy was inherently thick, but upon contact with Qin Sang’s body, it suddenly surged, like a tsunami on the ocean.</p><p>Qin Sang’s body was like a sponge, frantically absorbing the surrounding energy. Every particle felt like a hungry lamb, ravenously devouring it.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang instinctively activated his fundamental cultivation technique, the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, and his cultivation began to soar. He was lost in this blissful sensation, unable to extricate himself.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Qin Sang suddenly awoke, immediately realizing his cultivation had inexplicably increased significantly.</p><p>After his enlightenment at Yue Du Bay, the path ahead was clear; he only lacked cultivation. This incantation provided a shortcut.</p><p>The shamanistic incantation was miraculous, a power beyond Qin Sang's comprehension. He did not experience the pain of the ritualistic empowerment he had undergone in the talismanic world, yet his cultivation genuinely improved, seamlessly and naturally.</p><p>Yet, at this very moment, Qin Sang felt a subtle discord.</p><p>The energy remained immense, not fully absorbed.</p><p>Whether this was because he wasn't a descendant of the shamanistic tribe, unable to fully harmonize with the incantation, or for some other reason, he couldn't say. After Qin Sang awoke, this dissonance became increasingly pronounced.  Unusual fluctuations constantly bombarded him, causing Qin Sang to feel a growing unease; he seemed to be about to be expelled.</p><p>His heart sank. This opportunity was rare and precious; the longer he endured, the greater the benefits.  No matter what, he had to persevere.</p><p>Others, their minds ensnared by the incantation's power, could only cling to their inner selves until ejected, too late to recover.</p><p>Thanks to the jade Buddha, Qin Sang remained calm. He noticed his Sky-Eye Butterfly, also slightly unsettled, experiencing the same phenomenon.  The butterfly's cultivation had also improved; it had only recently broken through, and the gains from its tribulation were still being digested.</p><p>Even the spirit insect benefited! What a miraculous incantation!</p><p>As the discord began, he acted swiftly. Qin Sang consciously made various attempts to adjust himself, resisting the impact and guiding the Sky-Eye Butterfly to prolong the state.</p><p>His efforts proved effective.</p><p>After some time, he and the butterfly should have been expelled, yet they persisted.</p><p>Finally reaching their limit, the repulsive waves crashed upon them like tidal surges. Qin Sang yielded.</p><p>In an instant, all illusions vanished, returning to reality. Slowly opening his eyes, he saw the stone hall's door, cracked open.</p><p>No firelight emerged from the doorway, only darkness.</p><p>Looking around, Luo Hou, Gui Hou, the Fire Jade Centipede, and the Vermilion Bird lay scattered.</p><p>They had retreated from the incantation's sound earlier, but had also benefited, now diligently absorbing the gains.</p><p>Among the two demon lords, Gui Hou, already more powerful, used this opportunity to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage. Luo Hou, at the peak of the mid-Nascent Soul stage, was poised to advance further after absorbing his gains.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede, though not breaking through to the late fifth transformation, showed significant improvement. Whether it could surpass its racial limitations remained to be seen.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird, comparatively, made the least progress, remaining at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, demonstrating how difficult it was to break into the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Sky-Eye Butterfly reaped the greatest rewards.</p><p>Qin Sang, enduring to the very end, possessed the highest cultivation and strongest resistance to the impact.  His continuous adjustments led to an astonishing improvement from the incantation.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Even Qin Sang was shocked. After digesting his gains, he might be close to the mid-Void Refinement stage!</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly gave up earlier than Qin Sang, but still saved considerable time and energy.</p><p>Qin Sang examined himself. The power he gained was not his own; an unstable foundation was inevitable, but far better than after Lei Zu's infusion.</p><p>Temporarily stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Sang turned to Young Master Xin.</p><p>Young Master Xin sat in the void, having also broken through to the Nascent Soul peak within the incantation.  Perhaps due to the Spirit Stone's acknowledgment of her, she remained immersed in the incantation’s sound.</p><p>Her true essence surged in waves, repeatedly assaulting the bottleneck.</p><p>If she truly broke through to the Void Refinement stage, it would be truly astonishing!</p><p>Qin Sang mused.  Undeniably, without Young Master Xin’s invitation, he would have missed this opportunity, and there would be no chance to restore the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Young Master Xin had spoken the truth. Qin Sang released the restrictions on her, then dashed to the hall's entrance.</p><p>Peering through the crack, he saw the interior.</p><p>Surprisingly, the hall was empty, save for a few stone pillars and a large stone dais, like a throne.  The dais' back bore a circular recess; within, a sculpted orchid resembled the pattern on the door.</p><p>Qin Sang entered, finding nothing unusual.  The hall seemed to only contain the incantation.</p><p>After searching, finding nothing, Qin Sang exited and looked around.  The five-colored glow had faded since the hall's appearance; no other phenomena occurred within the deeper array.</p><p>He then flew elsewhere, gathering fragments, the Qianjun Ring's internal space gradually expanding until it became a spatial treasure a hundred miles across!</p><p>Qin Sang, carrying the Qianjun Ring, now possessed a personal small spatial realm.</p><p>The realm's spiritual energy was thin, insufficient for cultivation.  Besides its large size, and the potential to serve as refuge, it seemed useless.  Perhaps it would improve after restoration.</p><p>He still didn't know how to repair it.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew the Qianjun Ring, examining it repeatedly, hoping for spontaneous recovery, knowing it would be a long process.</p><p>Returning to the hall's entrance, Qin Sang saw Young Master Xin's aura waning, having reached her limit without breaking through to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Before she awoke, Qin Sang collected Luo Hou and the others into the magic cauldron.</p><p>The seals shattered, the stone hall losing its mystical properties and becoming ordinary stone. Qin Sang tested it, successfully storing the entire hall within her spatial ring without causing instability.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Young Master Xin’s eyelids fluttered, and she slowly awoke to find the space before her empty, causing her to pause.</p><p>“You’re awake.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice came from behind.</p><p>Young Master Xin turned, seeing Qin Sang with her back to her, gazing towards the entrance of the formation.  She noticed her own seals had been removed.  Qin Sang’s breath was slightly unsteady, unlike her previous composure. Young Master Xin’s expression relaxed slightly. “Elder Qin, you should believe me now; I spoke the truth.”</p><p>“Where is the hidden realm your father spoke of?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Young Master Xin immediately understood.  “It’s also within the Fengju Jade Gate.  Would you have the time to go there now, Senior?”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, mentioning no payment; her attitude spoke volumes.</p><p>Young Master Xin flew to Qin Sang’s side, remaining half a step behind as they both watched the destructive storm.  It seemed they would have to wait some time before leaving.</p><p>“Tell me how you discovered this place,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“Years ago, I was caught in a rogue energy surge and fled, stumbling upon this area. The strange light outside, caused by the surge, shifted, revealing a hidden place. After the surge subsided, I returned and found this tomb. Luckily, the talisman stone was discarded on a high platform outside; I was able to claim it with a drop of blood. Otherwise, I wouldn't have opened the first seal…”</p><p>Young Master Xin softly recounted the events, showing Qin Sang the items she’d obtained here.</p><p>She then briefly described the situation of the Xin family, and the surroundings of the  Pei Attendant and Zhong Liang Recluse’s area, but Qin Sang didn't respond.</p><p>Finally, the destructive storm began to wane.</p><p>When the outside was safe enough, they approached. Inside was chaos; no trace remained of the cultivators. Pei Attendant and Zhong Liang Recluse were utterly gone, their treasures lost.  It was a pity.</p><p>Two formidable Nascent Soul cultivators, now traveling the path to the underworld together. They likely never imagined they’d fall at the hands of a Metamorphosis cultivator.</p><p>“Young Master!”</p><p>“Elder Qin?”</p><p>As Qin Sang and Young Master Xin emerged from the formation, Steward Luo and others were waiting anxiously.</p><p>Not all of the Xin family cultivators had escaped; casualties were unavoidable. Steward Luo and the Xin family Elder had braced themselves for the possibility of everyone’s demise.</p><p>Seeing Young Master Xin not only safe but also with significantly improved cultivation, they rejoiced, then were shocked.</p><p>The plan had worked perfectly, eliminating the Pei Attendant and Recluse, yet a change had occurred.  They had presumed Qin Sang perished inside, and were astonished to see her emerge with the Young Master.</p><p>“Surprised to see this old man, are you?”</p><p>Qin Sang calmly surveyed the Xin family members.</p><p>Fear shot through them; their faces showed their terror.</p><p>Young Master Xin stepped forward. “Concerning today’s events, once we leave, everyone swears an oath of secrecy; otherwise, family law will be enforced!”</p><p>Under her sharp gaze, they bowed their heads, responding respectfully.</p><p>After this, no one in the family dared challenge Young Master Xin’s authority.</p><p>“Our strong enemies are gone, but that doesn't mean the Xin family can rest easy. Elder, Steward Luo… you likely guessed that the hidden realm Father spoke of before his death isn't this place.  Elder Qin has agreed to help us enter it.  You should rest and then we will depart.”</p><p>Hearing this, they finally relaxed, realizing Elder Qin was a friend, not a foe.  For the Xin family, this was the best possible outcome.</p><p>The destruction of the formation affected the outside world, shattering the strange spaces along their path. The danger was eliminated, so they didn't need Qin Sang's protection. Steward Luo and the others left first.</p><p>Qin Sang and Young Master Xin remained, intending to explore every corner.</p><p>“It seems this place won’t last long.”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the destructive storm hadn’t completely dissipated and was expanding.  The formation was the tomb's foundation; with its destruction, the tomb was crumbling.</p><p>He couldn't stop it, only salvage useful items before its destruction, storing them in his inner space for later analysis.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang led the Xin family cultivators out of the luminous region and rejoined those waiting outside.</p><p>Fewer people were needed now; Young Master Xin selected core family members to accompany Qin Sang to the hidden realm.</p>
