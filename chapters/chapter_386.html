<h1>Chapter 379: The Unexpected</h1><p>Looking back, the rain of blood was completely gone, the previous experience like a dream. In its place, countless profound runes floated in mid-air.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at the sight, then turned to face the deep cavern.</p><p>The cave was silent. Its entrance, barely wide enough for one person, seemed to open into a larger space within. There was no overwhelming demonic aura, no ghostly shadows—everything appeared normal.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze shifted to the cave walls. A smooth, glossy sheen flowed over the stone surface, its dense texture as hard as iron.</p><p>The entire mountain was covered by a barrier, negating earth-遁 techniques and brute force attempts at entry. The only way through was the cave itself.</p><p>However, the cave felt strangely artificial, as if carved out by some powerful force. This startled Qin Sang.</p><p>“Senior, does this cave lead to the inner valley?”</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, his eyes scanning the depths as if searching for something. He then gestured, and a white light flew from the cave into his palm.</p><p>“No one else has been here!”</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded again, about to enter when he suddenly paused. He retrieved a jade bottle and tossed it to Qin Sang. “Brother Qin, take this.”</p><p>Qin Sang caught the bottle and peered inside. Two dark green pills lay within.</p><p>Identical in size, about as big as a dragon’s eye, the pills were bumpy and uneven, like mud-caked clumps. A strange, dark green aura emanated from them, filling the bottle.</p><p>Healing pills Qin Sang had encountered before were often translucent and visually appealing, regardless of their color.  These, however, were bizarre.</p><p>Could they be poison? Qin Sang wondered.</p><p>He opened the bottle. An intensely foul odor wafted out, making him recoil and quickly reseal it.</p><p>Yun Youzi laughed. “Brother Qin, don’t be put off by their appearance. We’ll need these to protect ourselves later. Keep them for now and take them when I tell you.”</p><p>Seeing Yun Youzi’s cryptic behavior, Qin Sang didn't press further. The smell, though unpleasant, didn't seem poisonous.</p><p>If this green pill wasn't poison, it must have some other purpose.</p><p>Suppressing his curiosity, Qin Sang held the bottle and followed Yun Youzi into the cave.</p><p>The passage was pitch black. Even channeling spiritual energy into his eyes only allowed him to see the immediate surroundings. Yun Youzi didn't bother with illumination, moving silently through the darkness.</p><p>The passage sloped downwards, becoming increasingly steep.  Without Yun Youzi's instruction, Qin Sang didn't dare use his spiritual power, proceeding on foot.</p><p>After some time, Yun Youzi stopped.</p><p>Qin Sang heard his voice through mental transmission, “Brother Qin, the path ahead is treacherous. We can’t use spiritual power. Be careful not to slip. And when I signal, swallow the pill immediately.”</p><p>Qin Sang approached and looked ahead. The right wall continued, but the left side opened into a vast expanse, its edge unseen.</p><p>The path remained, but narrowed to the width of a single foot.</p><p>The air ahead was humid, suggesting a body of water below.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang noticed a green mist floating ahead, carrying a faint, fishy stench identical to the pills.</p><p>This gave him a hunch about their purpose.</p><p>The two men pressed their backs against the wall and inched forward. The path continued its descent.  Even after a considerable distance, Qin Sang heard no flowing water, but the humidity intensified.</p><p>The green mist thickened, the stench growing stronger.</p><p>Suddenly, Yun Youzi stopped, motionless.</p><p>Puzzled, Qin Sang glanced over and saw Yun Youzi staring ahead, his expression uncertain.</p><p>“Senior, is something wrong?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart sank. He prepared his magical tools, sending his question through mental transmission.</p><p>Yun Youzi hesitated, then replied, “There’s no sound.”</p><p>No sound? Qin Sang thought. Isn't that a good thing?</p><p>Yun Youzi explained.</p><p>“This was a nest of Star-Venom Frogs. This green mist is their breath.</p><p>“Their venom is incredibly potent. Even Core Formation cultivators avoid direct contact.</p><p>“However, there’s a mundane frog whose scent is remarkably similar.</p><p>“I’ve combined its venom with several foul-smelling herbs to create these pills.  They mimic the Star-Venom Frogs’ scent for about half an hour, almost perfectly.</p><p>“This should fool their senses and allow us to pass safely.</p><p>“But we’ve reached this point without hearing their calls. Something must be amiss.”</p><p>Qin Sang peered into the dense mist, but saw nothing.  “Senior, were they calling the last time you were here?”</p><p>“Yes,” Yun Youzi confirmed. “Their calls are similar to ordinary frogs, audible from afar.”</p><p>“Could they be hibernating?” Qin Sang speculated. “Or has anything else changed? The mist, the smell, perhaps?”</p><p>“No, that’s why I’m concerned… Never mind! Brother Qin, swallow the pill. Let’s go down and see…”</p><p>Yun Youzi made up his mind, took a pill, and continued.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw that the green mist below dissipated, revealing not a pool, but a muddy swamp.</p><p>The path leveled out here, running straight ahead.</p><p>Hugging the edge of the swamp, Yun Youzi and Qin Sang proceeded cautiously.</p><p>After a few steps, Qin Sang noticed something in the mist. “Senior, what’s that over there?”</p><p>Yun Youzi turned, following Qin Sang’s gaze. His expression shifted, and he retrieved a transparent thread from his storage pouch, flicking it forward.</p><p>The thread returned, carrying a small, white object.</p><p>It was the corpse of a frog.</p><p>The frog was about the size of a hand.</p><p>Its belly was white, its back dark green, blending with the mist.  Covered in bumps and smeared with mud, it was a repulsive sight.</p><p>“Dead!” Qin Sang pointed to a hole in the frog's skull.  A single, fatal blow.</p><p>“A young Star-Venom Frog!” Yun Youzi’s face darkened. “Killed easily, and its venom sac is missing.”</p>
