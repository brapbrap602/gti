<h1>Chapter 815: Transformation</h1><p>Chapter 815: Transformation</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang flew away from Qu Heng Island.</p><p>He tossed the jade token in his hand, a slight smile on his face.</p><p>Using spirit stones, a young cultivator took him to meet the ‘senior.’</p><p>This ‘senior’ was merely a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator, unable to see through his disguise.</p><p>The man was easily bribed; seeing the spirit stones, he readily agreed to Qin Sang's request.</p><p>The so-called manager wasn't as amazing as the young cultivator had described.  Their influence was limited to small, weak islands or tedious patrols.</p><p>The ‘senior’ presented several locations for Qin Sang to choose from. He immediately picked a small island called Nandou Island.</p><p>The island had only one mortal city, and the only suitable place for a cave dwelling was a single mountain. However, its proximity to Liangqiu Island was a major advantage.</p><p>……</p><p>“We’ve arrived!”</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at Nandou Island and sensed the spiritual energy.  It wasn’t particularly strong, but it was far better than those barren islands. Near Qu Heng Island, any island with a spirit vein had already been claimed.</p><p>Soon, he appeared above the only city, looked towards a green mountain behind it, and swiftly entered the mountain.</p><p>The mountain had a protective formation; when activated, it could shield the entire city from storms.</p><p>Currently, the formation only enveloped the mountain peak, shrouded in mist. Qin Sang swept his divine sense, perceiving the presence of cultivators inside, and infused his true essence into the jade token.</p><p>‘Buzz!’</p><p>The jade token vibrated, the protective formation reacted, and the cultivators inside, noticing the change, flew out of their caves towards the formation's entrance.</p><p>“Only one Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator, the rest are Qi Condensation stage…”</p><p>Qin Sang saw through their cultivation levels at a glance. He offered a jade slip and said proactively, “Greetings, fellow Daoists. My Daoist name is Mingyue. I’ve been assigned to guard Nandou Island. As a newcomer, I hope for your cooperation.  I’m looking for Daoist Ma Yu…”</p><p>The Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivator was a middle-aged man with a square face.  Hearing Qin Sang's words, his expression darkened, and he took the jade slip with a grim face. After reading it, he said stiffly, “I am Ma Yu. Since Daoist is here on orders, what are your instructions?”</p><p>Sensing the hostility, Qin Sang smiled faintly, unconcerned.  “Daoist, you exaggerate. I simply wanted a quiet place to cultivate but was assigned here.  I have little influence and must obey.  I would appreciate your help managing the island affairs. I will cooperate if needed.”</p><p>Ma Yu looked deeply at Qin Sang, his expression softening slightly. “Actually, there isn't much to do on the island. There are some vacant caves. Daoist, please come with me…”</p><p>After Qin Sang expressed his desire to focus solely on cultivation, Ma Yu’s attitude became much more amiable. They dismissed the others and walked while talking.</p><p>“As a newcomer, I wonder if there are any powerful cultivators or notable individuals nearby that I should avoid?” Qin Sang tentatively asked.</p><p>Ma Yu pointed towards the southeast outside the island and whispered, “The nearby islands are inhabited by cultivators like us; there's no need to worry. But there’s one exception. A hundred miles away lies Liangqiu Island. Although small, it possesses a superior spirit vein, occupied by a senior cultivator surnamed Luo.  Senior Luo is powerful and mysterious. It's best not to disturb them to avoid unnecessary trouble.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked in that direction.  Liangqiu Island was not visible from here.  He pretended to be surprised and asked Ma Yu about the rumors.</p><p>The cave dwelling Ma Yu provided was in the back mountain.</p><p>Entering the cave, he first took out some spirit stones to set up a spirit gathering array, then summoned the Heaven-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly was now the size of a palm, and the eye patterns on its wings looked even more realistic, as if two eyes were about to open.</p><p>As its wings fluttered, faint electric arcs flickered, a manifestation of its thunder manipulation ability.</p><p>Due to the electric arcs, its wings seemed much harder, like metal.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had sensed the butterfly’s change. Seeing it now, it had indeed reached the peak of its second transformation and was ready for its next advancement!</p><p>Had it not been for its five-year sleep after its mutation, it would have already transformed before entering the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face lit up. He played with the butterfly for a while, took out a jade bottle, and poured out a few drops of Crimson Fire Gold.</p><p>The Heaven-Eyed Butterfly happily danced around his hand, eagerly consuming it.</p><p>After consuming the Crimson Fire Gold, the butterfly clung to his finger, drowsy, but showed no signs of transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the butterfly wouldn't advance as easily as a fat silkworm. He still had most of the Crimson Fire Gold left, so he wasn't in a hurry and continued feeding it slowly.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang settled down on Nandou Island.</p><p>Every evening, without fail, he channeled the energy of the stars to refine his body.  During the day, he wandered, befriending cultivators on nearby islands, secretly searching for news of Luo Daotong.</p><p>Every ten days, he fed the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, he had been on Nandou Island for half a year.</p><p>After continuous feeding with the Crimson Fire Gilded Liquid, the Sky Eye Butterfly finally showed signs of transformation, but his supply of the liquid was almost exhausted.</p><p>That day, after consuming the liquid, the butterfly's wings suddenly erupted with dazzling lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang, quick-witted, erected a protective barrier.</p><p>The butterfly flew wildly, the electric arcs intensifying. The patterns on its wings began to writhe, and its eyes slowly cracked open a slit!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The butterfly returned to Qin Sang's palm, its body trembling violently, emitting a faint whimper.</p><p>The electric arcs were frantically assaulting the ‘eyes’ on its wings.  The mutation granted it the ability to control lightning, but it also subjected it to unexpected danger during its evolution.</p><p>Qin Sang realized this was the final stage of the butterfly's transformation; the previous changes were merely superficial. Only by merging its innate abilities with its lightning control could it truly become a Thunder Butterfly.</p><p>Failure meant death, and decades of Qin Sang's efforts would be ruined.</p><p>Feeling the butterfly's pain, Qin Sang was distraught. He immediately sat cross-legged, communicating with the butterfly's consciousness, soothing it, and doing everything he could to help it through this ordeal.</p><p>Fortunately, the Sky Eye Butterfly was his life-bound insect. With Qin Sang's generous expenditure of True Energy and blood essence, it finally overcame the most perilous stage, and its condition gradually stabilized.</p><p>Wings folded, the butterfly fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Finally, the ‘eyes’ opened completely, like true celestial eyes, capable of discerning the hearts of men. The electric arcs vanished, fully integrating into the ‘eyes,’ their pupils turning silver, adding a touch of divine majesty.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't guess what the butterfly's ultimate abilities would be, but he was certain it would only grow stronger, never weaker.</p><p>He watched for a while, sensing the butterfly's aura. He clearly felt a deeper connection, a heartfelt intimacy unlike the bond of a contract.</p><p>The transformation was completed during its sleep, a process requiring time.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted it into his dantian and resumed his work.</p>
