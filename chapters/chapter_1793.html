<h1>Chapter 1784: The Wood Jiao</h1><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>A cold wind swept across the desolate wilderness.</p><p>First, a silver-white sword light streaked across the sky, followed shortly by a flash of green.</p><p>As the two streams of light flew past, the grass and trees on either side swayed, and two human figures flickered into view.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other three, led by Zhenren Zhijian, kept a certain distance from each other to avoid being caught off guard by any sudden danger.</p><p>In fact, they had only been in the Corrupted Wasteland for three days. Under normal circumstances, they wouldn't encounter Nascent Soul-level beasts.  This precaution was merely a habitual act of prudence.</p><p>Powerful beasts generally only roamed in the depths of the Corrupted Wasteland, rarely appearing at the edges. Encroaching upon Mount Jushan was even rarer.</p><p>If a Nascent Soul-level beast were to appear nearby, even powerful Immortal Sects would find it a major headache.</p><p>Although Zhongmao Prefecture, Baishi Prefecture, and Jushan Prefecture were connected, vast stretches of their borders still bordered the Sea of Corruption and the Corrupted Wasteland, and were frequently attacked by beasts.</p><p>As far as Qin Sang knew, the Mountain Gods and River Gods under the jurisdiction of the Celestial Court were at most at the Transformation stage.</p><p>Unless the Celestial Court dispatched all Celestial Officials of the Fourth Rank and above to guard the border, the territory would never know peace.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his palm against the center of an ape demon's brow. The demon collapsed silently to the ground.</p><p>His figure didn't pause, drifting past as his gaze, sharp as lightning, scanned the surroundings.</p><p>Along the way, despite the numerous beasts, he had few opportunities to act.</p><p>Beasts were not entirely without reason. Rather, as their cultivation progressed and time passed, they were gradually invaded by the Ancient Qi of the Six Heavens until they lost themselves.</p><p>Low-level corrupted beasts were only slightly more ferocious and bloodthirsty than demon beasts, not much different.</p><p>Even true corrupted beasts possessed the instinct for self-preservation. Sensing the auras emitted by Qin Sang and the others, they scattered in all directions.</p><p>Cultivators entering the Corrupted Wasteland similarly couldn't lose themselves within a short period.</p><p>Even staying in the depths of the Corrupted Wasteland for more than a decade wouldn't cause them to lose their sanity.</p><p>However, once beyond the limits of the Spirit Altar, the Ancient Qi of the Six Heavens would take root in the Nascent Soul, becoming extremely difficult to expel.  This change was subtle; cultivators might not feel any difference at first, and their cultivation wouldn't be hindered, but it would already be a hidden danger.</p><p>As their cultivation deepened, it would eventually erupt, leaving them with endless regret.</p><p>Therefore, cultivators entering the Corrupted Wasteland either made plans in advance or brought ample spirit pills.</p><p>At first, the four of them occasionally communicated through voice transmission, but later, it became a monotonous journey.</p><p>Traveling for over a month, the deeper they ventured into the Corrupted Wasteland, the wilder the surrounding scenery became.</p><p>“There’s a mountain ahead. Further on, we might encounter beasts comparable to us in cultivation. This area is relatively quiet. Let’s rest and adjust our Qi here.”</p><p>Zhenren Zhijian's voice transmission arrived as he suddenly accelerated.  The others quickly followed, arriving at the mountain shortly after.</p><p>Seeing the scene at the mountaintop, a look of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes, but Zhenren Zhijian and the others seemed unfazed, leaping onto the peak and finding rocks to sit on in meditation.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived last, landing on a black stone beside the others.</p><p>The black stone beneath him was square, with sharp edges. Qin Sang spread his divine sense and discovered that there were many similar black stones nearby, although most were severely damaged and scattered across the mountain slopes.</p><p>These black stones couldn't have formed naturally; they were clearly man-made.</p><p>Observing the traces on the mountaintop, Qin Sang made another discovery.  "This… seems to be the ruins of a Daoist temple…"</p><p>This surprised Qin Sang. This place wasn't near Jushan Prefecture. Four Nascent Soul cultivators had traveled for a month, though for various reasons, they hadn't traveled at full speed.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators certainly wouldn't dare to stay here for long. Who would build a Daoist temple in such a place?</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang noticed that the ruins were ancient, an old temple. The traces indicated that it had been occupied by beasts after being abandoned, and for some unknown reason, this lair was now deserted.</p><p>"Could it be that the Corrupted Wasteland used to have cultivators?"</p><p>A thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He even suspected that this place, like Jushan Prefecture, was originally within the Daoist Sects' sphere of influence.</p><p>With this speculation, Qin Sang couldn't help but make further connections.</p><p>Since there was a Daoist temple, it meant this place was once suitable for cultivation. Why did it become the Corrupted Wasteland?</p><p>At this moment, Zhenren Zhijian glanced over and said, "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, be sure to stabilize your mind later."</p><p>"Thank you for the reminder, Fellow Daoist. I understand the dangers."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, suppressing his thoughts, and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha's protection, he had nothing to worry about, but he still had to put on a show, occasionally consuming a spirit pill as they journeyed deeper into the Corrupted Wasteland.</p><p>After adjusting their Qi, they continued their journey.</p><p>Unexpectedly, not long after they left the mountain, they encountered their first Nascent Soul-level beast!</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>A roar came from ahead, sounding somewhat muffled perhaps due to the distance.</p><p>But the powerful might contained within the roar sent a jolt of alarm through the four of them, and they stopped immediately.</p><p>It was nightfall.</p><p>Moonlight flowed like water.</p><p>The northern wilderness was shrouded in darkness, the sky seemingly covered by vast dark clouds, churning and roiling as they slowly pressed towards their location.</p><p>Zhenren Youhuang flicked her jade finger, a green light shooting out from her fingertip and transforming into a talisman in mid-air before flashing into an ancient tree on the ground.</p><p>The ancient tree instantly withered, and a spectral wooden figure leaped out from the deadwood.  Others could barely sense the wooden figure’s aura, or perhaps its aura had merged with the forest.</p><p>The wooden figure bowed to Zhenren Youhuang before burrowing into the ground and disappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Zhenren Youhuang’s actions and couldn’t help but take a second look.</p><p>Previously encountered beasts were mostly dealt with casually by him and Zhenren Guyun. Zhenren Youhuang rarely had a chance to act.</p><p>Now, she had used a divine talisman, yet her Spirit Altar hadn't manifested.</p><p>“This divine talisman is one of Fellow Daoist Youhuang’s Natal Talismans, best suited for reconnaissance. We’ll have the results shortly…”</p><p>Zhenren Zhijian explained through voice transmission.</p><p>Only talismans that carried Dharma Spells were called Natal Talismans. Zhenren Youhuang had received Third-Rank Dharma Spells, so she had three Natal Talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and voiced his question.</p><p>In their eyes, he was a rogue cultivator who had luckily broken through, so it was normal for him to be less knowledgeable.</p><p>Zhenren Zhijian explained, “You’ll understand after you receive Third-Rank Dharma Spells.  At the Profound Clarity Dharma Rank, the Spirit Altar gradually stabilizes.  As long as you've mastered the incantations, even when using Natal Talismans, there’s no need to summon the Spirit Altar.  However, if you haven’t thoroughly comprehended the incantations, you must summon the Spirit Altar to borrow its power.  Of course, this only applies to the Golden Seal Altar…”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang nodded silently. No wonder he hadn’t seen Zhenren Zhijian summon his Spirit Altar before.</p><p>One advantage of the Golden Seal Altar over the Army Altar was that it didn’t require prior arrangement of troops; the incantation could be cast instantly.</p><p>“However,” Zhenren Zhijian suddenly changed his tone, “It is said that those who cultivate the Army Altar to its depths can also omit the step of summoning troops, directly communicating with the troops within the altar, forming formations instantly.”</p><p>Zhenren Guyun scoffed.  “I haven’t seen such a master yet.  Who knows if it’s true or not.”</p><p>As they spoke, a green shadow leaped out of the ground and vanished into Zhenren Youhuang’s palm.</p><p>Zhenren Youhuang’s face lit up with joy. “It’s a Wood Jiao! Its aura is only slightly stronger than ours, and there are no other Demon Lord-level beasts nearby.”</p><p>“A Wood Jiao? Fellow Daoist, are you thinking of using this Jiao’s demon core to forge your altar?”</p><p>Zhenren Zhijian guessed Zhenren Youhuang’s intention.</p><p>The Dharma Spell that Zhenren Youhuang cultivated was of the Wood element.</p><p>Forging a Third-Rank Spirit Altar required either rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures or the blood essence, bones, and demon core of a Demon Lord.</p><p>How easy was it to kill a Demon Lord from the Ghostfang Kingdom?</p><p>A suitable beast was also a rare find, so it was no wonder Zhenren Youhuang was delighted.</p><p>“Mid-Profound Clarity Dharma Rank.  What do you two think?” Zhenren Zhijian looked at Qin Sang and Zhenren Guyun.</p><p>Zhenren Guyun stretched his neck, exuding a strong battle intent, his attitude clear.</p><p>Qin Sang also nodded in agreement.</p><p>All four of them were at the early Nascent Soul stage. Hunting a beast comparable to the Thunder Turtle shouldn't be dangerous.</p><p>“Thank you for your support, fellow Daoists.” Zhenren Youhuang smiled and bowed to them.</p><p>They immediately flew towards the beast and were discussing their plan when they suddenly detected the auras of cultivators below.</p><p>Zhenren Zhijian said in a low voice, "Let's get rid of these people first."</p><p>They came for the Demon Lord and didn’t want to expose their identities prematurely.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a cave.</p><p>Three Daoists were busy, anxiety etched on their faces.</p><p>One summoned a Spirit Altar, continuously shooting talismans towards the cave entrance, gradually forming a dark light barrier.</p><p>The other two had an incense burner placed in front of them. With their combined efforts, thick smoke filled the small cave. This smoke, along with the light barrier, had the ability to conceal their auras.</p><p>All three were Ascendant Profound Real People.</p><p>“Senior Brother, will that beast discover us?”</p><p>The cultivator on the left of the incense burner was a female, her voice trembling.</p><p>“We shouldn’t have gone so deep.  We haven’t even erased the traces outside yet. There are rarely any Demon Lord-level beasts here,” the Daoist busy sealing the cave entrance complained.</p><p>The last Daoist, a middle-aged man, sensed the aura outside before saying, “Junior Brother, Junior Sister, don’t worry. The stronger the beast, the lower its intelligence. It’s impossible for it to find us through the traces.  Once it flies past, we’ll be safe.”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort echoed, accompanied by an astonishing pressure descending, “You have quite the nerve to come here.”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The three of them changed color drastically, abruptly standing up, but they couldn't find the source of the voice. The middle-aged Daoist bowed towards the empty space, “We were unaware of Senior’s presence here. We disturbed Senior while seeking refuge from the beast. We beg Senior’s forgiveness.  Once the beast flies away, we’ll leave immediately.”</p><p>“No need to wait. You can leave now. It won’t discover you,” the cold, yet unquestionable voice responded.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, feeling indignant and worried, but the invisible pressure prevented them from defying the order.</p><p>Hearts filled with apprehension, they deactivated the talismans sealing the cave and walked out, only to be stopped by the mysterious voice.</p><p>“Wait! How long have you been here? Have you noticed anything unusual?”</p><p>The middle-aged Daoist’s expression brightened. He quickly replied, “We arrived ten days ago.  Previously, a large group of beasts rushed out from the depths of the Corrupted Wasteland. We observed for a few days and saw no other abnormalities, so we took a gamble and didn’t retreat.”</p><p>The four in the air exchanged glances.</p><p>“That place is even further north.  It shouldn’t affect this area so quickly, should it?” Zhenren Guyun questioned.</p><p>“Perhaps someone took action midway? There’s no time to lose. Let’s slay the Wood Jiao and depart as soon as possible.” Zhenren Zhijian gave the order, and everyone immediately dispersed, taking their positions.</p><p>The three Ascendant Profound Real People exited the cave and saw the Wood Jiao change its flight path, realizing it hadn't noticed them. Overjoyed, they fled without looking back.</p><p>“It’s here!”</p><p>In a valley, Qin Sang and Zhenren Guyun stood on opposite mountain peaks, watching the approaching dark clouds.</p><p>A slender green shadow flickered in and out of view in front of the clouds.</p><p>Zhenren Guyun gripped his arm across his chest, black light flashing as a long spear materialized in his palm.</p><p>The spear was entirely black, with a cold sheen and a faint blood-red glow on its blade, clearly a peerless凶weapon.</p><p>Holding the spirit spear, Zhenren Guyun’s battle intent surged and intensified.</p><p>Compared to him, Qin Sang was much more reserved.  He didn't activate his Spirit Wood Body, only circulating the Diamond Celestial Armor Seal as golden light flowed around him.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>An enraged dragon’s roar echoed, deafeningly loud.</p><p>The dark clouds churned as a long, slender figure emerged, nearly a hundred zhang long. Its enormous eyes radiated a terrifying凶light, a sharp horn on its head, and its entire body covered in thick green scales.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Wood Jiao abruptly swung its long tail, as if cleaving open a green chasm in the void.</p><p>At this moment, both Qin Sang and Zhenren Guyun’s hearts skipped a beat, let alone Zhenren Youhuang, who faced the Wood Jiao directly.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, every increment of cultivation advancement amplified the might of heaven and earth they could command.</p><p>Although the Wood Jiao was a beast, its every move instinctively drew upon the power of heaven and earth to suppress its enemies, and each attack was without reservation.</p><p>In Zhenren Youhuang’s eyes, this wasn’t just a jiao’s tail.</p><p>In an instant, terrifying pressure descended with the tail. Zhenren Youhuang felt as if she had fallen into a mire, as though this attack could shatter the void and erase her from existence.</p><p>Zhenren Youhuang was prepared.  Without panic, she transformed into a talismanic image with a flicker.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jiao's tail swept past, shattering the talismanic image.</p><p>Simultaneously, countless fist-sized green light spots emerged from the jungle below. The light spots converged, reforming into a human figure – Zhenren Youhuang.</p><p>Zhenren Youhuang was unharmed, but this action enraged the Wood Jiao.</p><p>The Wood Jiao roared as it dived downwards, the凶light in its eyes intensifying until they turned completely white.</p><p>In the next moment, all the vegetation ignited from within with a pale white flame.</p><p>White flames soared into the sky, but strangely, the jungle within the sea of fire remained unharmed.</p><p>Zhenren Youhuang's face paled slightly. She felt a strange force constantly emanating from within her, as if trying to burn away her Yuan Qi. She quickly cast a spell to suppress it.</p><p>At this moment, the Wood Jiao descended from the sky, engulfed in intense flames that seemed capable of incinerating the heavens. The Wood Jiao’s true form was invisible to the naked eye, only a boundless sea of white flames engulfing the area.</p><p>“Beast!  Prepare to die!”</p><p>A sudden explosive shout rang out.</p><p>Zhenren Guyun glared at the white flames, his battle intent erupting as he leaped forward like a tiger released from its cage.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, he hurled the spirit spear, transforming it into a black lightning bolt.</p><p>The spirit spear spun rapidly, powerful force forming a black vortex at its tip. The vortex grew larger and larger, a single graze collapsing half of a mountain peak.</p><p>The sound of wind and thunder boomed as it pierced the white flames, blasting open a black hole within the sea of fire.</p><p>The Wood Jiao was exposed within the black hole.</p><p>At this moment, a figure also appeared beside the Wood Jiao – Qin Sang, with the Demon Subduing Seal formed with his hands.</p><p>Then, a strange glint flashed in Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>So close to the Wood Jiao, with a cultivation level lower than the beast, he couldn't feel the suppression of heaven and earth's might from the Wood Jiao.</p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p>Qin Sang was also extremely surprised.  Even in his prime, he had to avoid the Thunder Turtle's direct attacks.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang quickly traced the source, discovering with astonishment that the Dharma Idol power within him was vibrating.</p>
