<h1>Chapter 106 Breaking the Barrier</h1><p>Chapter 106 Breaking the Barrier</p><p>South of Wuchen Kingdom lies a vast, desolate mountain range.</p><p>Unknown to mortals, within this expanse, several enormous peaks stand barren and lifeless.  No vegetation grows, no animals roam. The rocks and soil are a strange black, and from the crevices, a constant stream of black smoke seeps out, poisoning the surrounding forests.</p><p>A chill pervades the air here, affecting not just the body, but also the soul.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived on his flying shuttle and, observing the endless expanse of black mountains, thought that the name "Earth Sinkhole" was rather underwhelming.  It was far larger than the Yin Sha Abyss!</p><p>The entrance to the Earth Sinkhole resembled a massive crater, hundreds of yards in diameter, a gaping black maw against the sky. Tendrils of dark, sinister energy pulsed against the barrier sealing the entrance, writhing like trapped fish. The bottom of the pit was pitch black, like a gateway to the underworld.</p><p>It was fortunate the Earth Sinkhole was located in the remote mountains. If it were any closer to the neighboring kingdoms, the consequences would be catastrophic.</p><p>Qin Sang leaped into the hole. A shiver ran down his spine, and his expression changed.  Even with the Warm Sun Pearl and the Sha-warding Veil, artifacts specifically designed to protect against sinister energy, which had served him well in the Yin Sha Abyss, he still felt a piercing cold in the Earth Sinkhole.</p><p>As he descended, the Earth Sinkhole widened.  Further down, it opened into a massive chasm, no smaller than the Yin Sha Abyss. Countless fissures branched out from the main chasm like tendrils, spreading the sinister energy for hundreds of miles, affecting all life in the area.</p><p>Qin Sang found his assigned cave in the stone wall, entered, and activated the barrier. Only then did some warmth return to his body.</p><p>The cave was simple and crude, as always. Qin Sang picked up the jade slip within and pressed it to his forehead.  It contained a complete map of the Earth Sinkhole, highlighting the barriers set by Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>Sealing such a vast area completely would be too costly. Shao Hua Mountain had merely concealed the Earth Sinkhole with a simple illusion formation, and sealed the larger openings and fissures to slow the spread of the sinister energy.</p><p>Due to the shifting terrain, new fissures could appear, and existing barriers could be damaged by the relentless assault of the sinister energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's duty was to patrol the entire Earth Sinkhole every two days, record any changes, and report back to the sect.  This was to prevent any sudden, unexpected events that might catch them off guard.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to begin his patrol immediately.</p><p>He had spent a month listening to lectures at Shao Hua Mountain, gaining significant insights. In particular, a story from one of his elders about breaking through cultivation barriers during the Qi Refining stage had resonated deeply.  He had felt a loosening of his ninth-level bottleneck and rushed here immediately.</p><p>The patrol took him most of the day.  Upon returning, Qin Sang felt as though he had walked naked through a glacier.  He sat in meditation, circulating his cultivation technique for a long time to dispel the cold from his body.</p><p>He recorded the changes in the Earth Sinkhole on a communication talisman provided by the sect, activated it, sealed his cave, placed the Bewildering Mirror at the entrance, and began closed-door cultivation.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Dian Yun Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang, Sun De, and a group of rogue cultivators gathered at the mountain summit, drinking and enjoying themselves.  Sun De had planted many spiritual fruits in his medicinal garden, each sweet and delicious, yet he repeatedly lamented that they were inferior to the Red Jade Peaches of Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>The other rogue cultivators nodded in agreement.</p><p>Having broken through to the ninth level, Qin Sang was in high spirits. He joined in the conversation, saying he eagerly anticipated the ripening of the Red Jade Peaches and would return to the sect to savor them.</p><p>Sun De raised his cup in a toast to Qin Sang. "Congratulations, Junior Brother Qin, on reaching the ninth level. I offer you this humble wine, far less refined than the immortal wine brewed from spiritual fruits at our sect. I hope you won't find it too lacking."</p><p>Qin Sang humbly accepted, clinking cups with Sun De and the other rogue cultivators.</p><p>A considerable distance and a large river separated Dian Yun Mountain and the Earth Sinkhole. However, these were no obstacles for cultivators.  Since Qin Sang's arrival at the Earth Sinkhole, Sun De had sent several invitations, which Qin Sang had declined, citing closed-door cultivation.</p><p>This time, Sun De had come personally, and as Qin Sang had just achieved his breakthrough, he accepted the invitation.</p><p>Upon arriving at Dian Yun Mountain, Qin Sang realized why Sun De was known as "Timely Rain."  He was not only highly regarded within Shao Hua Mountain, but also among the nearby rogue cultivators.</p><p>He regularly hosted gatherings at Dian Yun Mountain, displaying none of the aloofness typical of sect disciples. He welcomed even the lowest-level cultivators with a warm smile, putting everyone at ease.</p><p>During a gathering, whenever anyone asked for guidance on cultivation, he would offer advice wholeheartedly, never hoarding his knowledge.</p><p>Qin Sang sipped wine and listened, feeling the trip was worthwhile, and secretly admired Senior Brother Sun. He thought it wouldn't hurt to come more often.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Sun De and returning to the Sunken Grotto, Qin Sang made his routine patrol. Passing by a fissure, he suddenly sensed something amiss.  Instantly alarmed, he retreated using wind magic, retrieved the Azure Wave Sword from his Mustard Seed Bag, and activated the Starry Tear Shield around himself. He shouted coldly, "Who's there?! Come out!"</p><p>A moment later, a dark figure emerged from the fissure, stammering, "Fellow Daoist Qin, don't be impulsive, it's me, it's me..."</p><p>When the figure appeared, Qin Sang said in surprise, "Fellow Daoist Hong?"</p><p>This Fellow Daoist Hong, named Hong Shan, was a rogue cultivator he'd met at the Cloud Peak gathering. They had just parted ways at Cloud Peak.</p><p>Having only a nodding acquaintance with him, Qin Sang remained vigilant, questioning, "Fellow Daoist Hong, why are you trespassing in the Sunken Grotto instead of returning to your cave after the gathering?"</p><p>Hong Shan chuckled awkwardly, "Fellow Daoist Qin, you don't understand.  The protective talisman I refined requires Yin Sha Qi for tempering, so I often visit the depths of the Sunken Grotto.  Fellow Daoist Wang, the previous guardian of the Sunken Grotto, and Fellow Daoist Sun from Cloud Peak are both aware of this. I meant to inform you at Cloud Peak, but the wine flowed too freely, and it slipped my mind. If you don't believe me, you can ask Fellow Daoist Sun; he can vouch for me."</p><p>Although the Lesser Hua Sect had sealed the Sunken Grotto, they hadn't forbidden others from collecting Yin Sha Qi. People could freely enter and exit through the various fissures.</p><p>Many rogue cultivators who couldn't afford talismans devised their own methods of refining them, resulting in a bizarre variety. Yin Sha Qi, being extremely cold, could enhance the power of talismans when infused into them.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed several top-grade talismans and didn't need to refine his own.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang sent a message talisman to Sun De for confirmation. Shortly after, he received Sun De's voice transmission confirming the story.  Qin Sang then ceased his obstruction and nodded, warning, "Fellow Daoist Hong, remember not to disturb the forbidden areas. If the Yin Sha Qi erupts and causes harm, neither of us will escape the consequences."</p><p>"Understood, understood," Hong Shan patted his chest. "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist Qin, I'll just find a fissure, collect some Yin Sha Qi, and leave. I wouldn't dare intrude into the core area."</p><p>Unexpectedly, at the next gathering, Qin Sang didn't see Hong Shan.</p>
