<h1>Chapter 1372: The Old Wind Demon</h1><p>A green light, a red glow, and shadows beneath the sea.</p><p>They were in pursuit.</p><p>The distance between them gradually widened.</p><p>The three demon kings' eyes changed.</p><p>Among the three demons, the frog-fish's abilities were unique.</p><p>The one-legged bird was not only powerful, but its escape techniques were also rarely matched among the demon race.</p><p>If a lone human Yuan Ying cultivator were caught by them, their chances of escape would be slim. Yet, they encountered someone whose speed was even faster than theirs.</p><p>"Thunder Escape Technique!"</p><p>The little fox exclaimed, "No mistake! It's definitely Thunder Escape!"</p><p>"Thunder Escape is uncommon among humans. It's far more difficult to cultivate than the equally swift Wind Escape.  Among the top human factions, none are known to possess such a secret technique. What is this person's background?"</p><p>The frog-fish transmitted its voice.</p><p>Its tone was urgent, struggling to keep up.</p><p>The one-legged bird mused, "Perhaps it's a hidden technique, maybe never mastered before, gathering dust on a shelf. Now, someone with enough talent has appeared, bringing it back to light. You said Thunder Escape is difficult to cultivate. Even in our demon race, even those with an innate affinity for lightning often fail to master it... The lightning technique and the Thunder Escape just now suggest this person might be a pure lightning cultivator.  Human lightning cultivators mostly come from the Jiang Lei Mansion, but the Jiang Lei Mansion is far from here. Why is he here? And his aura is weak, as if he'd just fought a great battle?"</p><p>The little fox said, "This person is a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator.  Besides our demon realm, where in the world can't they go?  Rumor has it that Jiang Lei Mansion cultivators are violent and make many enemies.  I wonder who his opponent was. Could it be another cultivator?"</p><p>The one-legged bird was startled, his expression changing.  "There were no warning signals from elsewhere. Could it be..."</p><p>The frog-fish transmitted its voice again, reassuringly, "Other cultivators usually travel in groups and shouldn't be easily killed by a single person. However, such a powerful cultivator appearing in this sea area, whether passing through or a helper invited by the Old Wind Demon, must not be allowed to escape! Otherwise, if the Old Wind Demon gets such a strong reinforcement, he'll be even harder to deal with!  Encountering him while he's weak is a godsend."</p><p>The little fox and the one-legged bird agreed with the frog-fish's assessment.</p><p>As the green light flew further away.</p><p>The frog-fish's tone became more urgent, "Hu Daoyou, how long until your injuries are healed? I can burn my true blood to increase my escape speed for a short time, but you must help me."</p><p>The little fox looked down at its hind leg; the wound showed signs of healing.</p><p>The three demons had a deep friendship.</p><p>The little fox understood the frog-fish's intentions.</p><p>The little fox had a secret technique that perfectly matched the frog-fish's innate abilities.  Combined, they could enhance the frog-fish's power, but it required preparation and complete focus.</p><p>However, the little fox hesitated, "Going after him alone is dangerous... Humans often use magic treasures. This person only used one top-tier lightning technique; we don't even know his main magic treasure.  What's more, he has a Yuan Ying-level puppet protecting him. I'm always sensitive to danger, and I felt a life threat from him, not just from that lightning technique..."</p><p>The little fox was still frightened.</p><p>If its companions hadn't saved it in time, it might have perished under the Heavenly Thunder!</p><p>The one-legged bird also added, "I'm not sure I could defeat him. A cornered beast will fight fiercely. Even weakened, he should not be underestimated. Let's just keep him at bay. We'll see how long he can last. Once his spiritual energy is depleted, he'll be at our mercy."</p><p>The frog-fish was silent for a moment, its tone not optimistic, "It's too loud.  If we keep chasing, we might attract the Old Wind Demon. We only need to delay him for a moment until Bi Fang Daoyou catches up. As long as I'm careful, I can protect myself. The earlier fight showed his Yuan Ying puppet is also near the end of its strength; it's not a major concern..."</p><p>Bi Fang was the one-legged bird's Dao name.</p><p>Its appearance was far from the legendary Bi Fang divine beast; the only similarity was their single leg, hence the borrowed name.</p><p>Finally, Bi Fang and the little fox were persuaded by the frog-fish.</p><p>In a short while, the dark energy in the little fox's wound was expelled and it began to heal.</p><p>Exhaling a breath of stale air.</p><p>The little fox let out a low growl.</p><p>Bi Fang lowered its altitude, flying almost along the surface of the sea, and the frog-fish strained to catch up.</p><p>The little fox's demon eyes flashed with a faint golden light, strange runes intertwined in its pupils, eventually forming a 'd' character seal, flashing towards the frog-fish's forehead.</p><p>The seal separated from her body, and the little fox showed clear signs of exhaustion; the secret technique had clearly taken a heavy toll.</p><p>The frog-fish offered no resistance, allowing the seal to enter its body.</p><p>Instantly, a golden light flowed over its entire body, transforming it into a shimmering goldfish.</p><p>The golden light then subsided.</p><p>The frog-fish's belly swelled, a muffled thunderous sound emanating from within.  It pushed off with its hind legs, opened its mouth wide, and expelled a swirling mass of green and gold light. This solidified into a transparent, thin garment clinging tightly to its body.</p><p>Oddly, its speed didn't increase. The dark shadows beneath the surface were clearly visible, still trailing behind Bi Fang.</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, desperately searching for a way to escape as she fled.</p><p>Noticing the enemy falling behind,</p><p>Qin Sang's heart eased slightly, but she remained vigilant.</p><p>Just then, Tianmu Butterfly suddenly sensed something unusual beneath the surface of the water.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, her hand in her sleeve clenching tightly around the magic banner.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Without warning, the sea surface exploded as a figure shot into the air.</p><p>It was the frog-fish!</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, the space ahead was filled with a vibrant green light.  Caught completely off guard, Qin Sang plunged into it.</p><p>The green light not only disrupted her escape technique but also caused a moment of disorientation, leaving her momentarily dazed.</p><p>The frog-fish let out a cackling laugh.</p><p>The green light was its most potent ability, capable of both restraining opponents and inflicting a powerful poison.  It had used this technique to eliminate countless foes stronger than itself.</p><p>This fellow was desperately trying to escape; in such a hurried state, how could she possibly withstand such a surprise attack?</p><p>The frog-fish swam into the green light, its eyes blazing with malice, ready to strike Qin Sang while she was vulnerable.</p><p>The next moment, that malice turned to horror.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The magic banner burst from her sleeve.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire followed, transforming into a fiery dragon.</p><p>Upon the appearance of the demon fire, the green light offered no resistance whatsoever.</p><p>With devastating force, the demon fire tore through the green light, charging towards the frog-fish.</p><p>Through the flames, the frog-fish saw Qin Sang's mocking expression and noticed the anti-venom armor she wore, instantly regretting its actions.</p><p>During their earlier encounter, when the Yuan Ying spirit puppet had fallen victim to the green light's power, Qin Sang had understood its poisonous nature and had taken preventative measures by activating the fat silkworm's protection.</p>
