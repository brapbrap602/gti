<h1>Chapter 1621: The Ice Instrument Divine Plate</h1><p>Lang Zheng's location remains unknown, but at least we now have a clear objective.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the inscriptions on the stelae and their distribution.</p><p>I wonder if the teleportation array's layout is related to the locations of the various halls within the Wu Xiang Sect.</p><p>If there's a connection, finding Lang Zheng will be much easier.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger on the mountaintop, quietly descending and entering the stone beach.</p><p>Despite his best efforts to conceal his presence, the sword array inevitably detected him.  His presence was revealed the moment he entered, and he was immediately attacked by puppets.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't summon his external avatar.</p><p>Surrounded by puppets, his body stood firm, the Jin Chen Sword suspended above him, its sword energy slashing repeatedly.  However, its targets weren't the puppets but the incoming flying swords.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's precise control, the Jin Chen Sword's energy focused on defense. Upon collision, both the sword energy and the flying swords dissipated, minimizing conspicuous phenomena.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang manipulated the fire lotus.</p><p>Wherever the Nine Nether Demon Fire passed, it carved a fiery path through the puppet horde. Once touched by the demonic fire, the puppets were difficult to escape, eventually burning to ashes.</p><p>The situation wasn't overly difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang moved with ease, his speed increasing as he smoothly traversed the stone beach.</p><p>Although he hadn't yet found Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Lingtian, Qin Sang knew they couldn't be far.</p><p>Qin Sang climbed a mountain peak, gazing towards the northeast. That area was the most striking; the scripture repository and the Wu Xiang Sect's Five Elements Hall were likely located there.</p><p>Unexpectedly, however, the path leading there showed no unusual signs.</p><p>Instead, in the north, a sheer cliff loomed in the clouds, with frequent flashes of light at its base, strongly suggesting someone was attacking a restriction.</p><p>After observing both locations, Qin Sang didn't hesitate long before heading north.</p><p>There must be a reason why the Wu Xiang Sect remnants are attacking the cliff first.</p><p>The Immortal Hall undoubtedly holds the most valuable secrets of the Wu Xiang Sect.  Qin Sang speculated that the entrance to the Immortal Hall might be located on that cliff!</p><p>By the time he arrived, the situation at the cliff should be nearing its resolution.</p><p>The appearance of the Immortal Hall couldn't be missed.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on the major opportunities he’d encountered – most were intricately connected to the Ziwei Palace and the Seven Kill Hall, and his fundamental cultivation method originated from the Immortal Hall itself!</p><p>He considered entering the Immortal Hall himself, leaving an avatar to search the Wu Xiang Sect for Lang Zheng.</p><p>Even amidst the current gathering of powerful cultivators, his avatar could handle itself!</p><p>…</p><p>It was Zhu Wu Dao and his group assaulting the restriction.</p><p>The mountain was steep, a sheer ascent and descent.</p><p>The cliff face had protruding stone steps leading to different directions, eventually converging at the summit.  Stone pavilions and towers were built at the junctions, once used for leisure.</p><p>Now, of course, they stood empty.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Wu Xiang Sect was shrouded in mist, obscuring the view of its former grandeur.</p><p>Besides Zhu Wu Dao, only the Crying Spirit Cave Master, Mo Xing Dao, and the Sword-carrying Man remained.</p><p>The Qu Yang Mountain lineage hadn't arrived in time, leaving Zhu Wu Dao short-handed.  Yet he seemed unconcerned about the Crying Spirit Cave Master and the others turning against him after entering the Tian Tong Hall.</p><p>He didn't inquire about the Sword-carrying Man's true identity, nor about the whereabouts of the Strange-faced Man, the White-robed Man, or Su Zi Nan. He focused solely on breaking the mountain's restriction.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master and others silently assisted.</p><p>The atmosphere was somewhat strange, but their cooperation was seamless, their ascent speed unimpeded.</p><p>Below the cliff, a subtle distortion appeared in the void.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Lingtian arrived, tracking them.</p><p>Unlike Zi Lei Zhenren, Yue Lingtian looked hesitant, glancing eastward from time to time.</p><p>He had agreed to use his disciples' lives to help Zi Lei Zhenren achieve his plan.</p><p>One reason was the Sword Tomb qualification.</p><p>The second was his covetousness for the Wu Xiang Sect's Earth Element Hall inheritance.</p><p>Tai Yue Sect's foundation was the "Thick Earth Record," a lineage with inherent flaws. Despite generations of refinement by their ancestors, Yue Lingtian still believed it insufficient. Obtaining the Earth Element Hall's inheritance would provide valuable insights, potentially transforming Tai Yue Sect.</p><p>Both were equally crucial to him and his sect.</p><p>He and Hua Chenzi had a clear division of labor: one would follow Zi Lei Zhenren into the Tian Tong Hall, and the other would lead people to plunder the Earth Element Hall.  However, Hua Chenzi was blocked by Yun Long and hadn't appeared.</p><p>…</p><p>The White-robed Man flew out of the stone beach, escaping the puppet army's pursuit.</p><p>Beyond the beach, a mountain range blocked his path.</p><p>The mountain was silent, devoid of birdsong or insect calls, only occasional flashes of light, indicating numerous restrictions.</p><p>From below, the mountain lacked grand halls.  Its proximity to the sect gate suggested it wasn't particularly important, and no sect would store precious artifacts in such a location.</p><p>In the world, treasures worthy of a Grand Cultivator's attention are few and far between.</p><p>Instead of wasting time searching here, it's better to bypass this mountain and head deeper into the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The man in white robes reached the foot of the mountain, paused briefly, but instead of taking the detour, he went through the archway at the entrance of the mountain path and directly entered the mountain.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>As soon as he passed under the archway, a thunderbolt struck from above.</p><p>The stone archway transformed, surrounded by lightning, triggering a heavenly thunder that split the clouds. Silver-white electric light formed a curtain of lightning, surging down, about to engulf the man in white robes.</p><p>As if expecting this, the man in white robes emitted a burst of cold air from his head, creating a horizontal ice wall, its surface shimmering with mysterious light.</p><p>The next moment, the thunderbolt struck the ice wall. The mysterious light suddenly brightened, reflecting all the thunder back.</p><p>The archway trembled, almost collapsing.</p><p>The man in white robes was unharmed and disappeared into the mountain.</p><p>The mountain had more than just the archway's restriction, but shortly after passing through it, the man in white robes suddenly vanished, and the mountain fell silent.</p><p>At this moment, the man in white robes was wandering aimlessly among the mountains.</p><p>His movements inevitably triggered the restrictions, but with his sharp spiritual perception and various supernatural powers, he was able to nullify the anomalies and conceal his presence before the restrictions could fully activate.</p><p>While stealthily moving through the mountain range, the man in white robes carefully observed his surroundings and his rear.</p><p>His goal was clear: he wasn't with Zhu Wu Dao; he was heading straight for the core of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The place Zhu Wu Dao went to was undoubtedly a treasure land, the legendary Immortal Palace, holding incredible opportunities.</p><p>But the man in white robes knew his strength was inferior, and being alone, he preferred to forgo the Immortal Palace to avoid conflict.</p><p>If he could obtain the treasures of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, the journey wouldn't be in vain, and he would have plenty to absorb.</p><p>The detour he deliberately took was a precaution, to prevent being unknowingly followed.</p><p>Finally, confirming no one was tailing him—all having been led away by Zhu Wu Dao—he relaxed and removed the mask concealing his appearance and aura.</p><p>The man's face was aged, deeply lined, but his eyes shone with vigor, showing no sign of senescence.</p><p>If Qin Sang were here, seeing this man, he would be greatly surprised: it was Yan Shan!</p><p>After the Northern Wasteland battle, Yan Shan disappeared.</p><p>Years later, he reappeared at the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, his cultivation having made a leap, breaking through to the late Yuan Ying stage!</p><p>Yan Shan gazed at the core of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.  A light flashed in his hand, revealing a Water Phase Token. He played with it for a moment, then put it away.</p><p>The imitation Water Phase Token was destroyed outside the gates; his anger was a carefully constructed facade.</p><p>“The Ice Instrument Disk and Boiling Snow Pill were taken by the Water Phase Master, falling into that person's hands. The remaining treasures in the Water Phase Hall must be few. I should go to the Five Phases Supreme Master's Di Shou Mountain first. The Five Phases Token is a symbol of the Five Phases Master's status; entering Di Shou Mountain should be much easier… Hmm, I should also visit the Fire Phase Hall. If I can obtain the Fire Rhinoceros… I can make a deal with that person. That person hasn't appeared in Nan Zhou, so they probably don't know the true function of the Ice Instrument Disk… But the Fire Phase successor hasn't appeared yet, I wonder if that treasure is still in the legacy mansion. Also, does Old Demon Zhu know about this thing?”</p><p>Yan Shan pondered for a while, then, choosing his direction, flew down the mountain.</p><p>He accelerated, weaving through the mountains, and upon seeing an anomaly in the direction of the cliffs, paused slightly before turning his gaze away, disregarding the opportunities in the Immortal Palace.</p><p>Crossing mountain after mountain, he drew closer to the core of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>As he flew, he bypassed another dangerous mountain and passed a valley.</p><p>The valley floor was overgrown with weeds.</p><p>The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect was full of spiritual energy, and the plants were taller than elsewhere, the grass reaching a height of ten feet, like small trees; a person entering the grass would instantly disappear from sight.</p><p>Reaching the edge of the valley, Yan Shan was about to enter the grass when he sensed something unusual, his expression turning serious, and he instantly retreated.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you're quite fast. Su almost couldn't catch up.”</p><p>The grass stalks swayed, and a man emerged—Su Zi Nan!</p><p>Su Zi Nan smiled at Yan Shan, his eyes like those of a predator looking at its prey.  “Northern Wasteland, we missed our chance then. Thankfully, we meet again today. It’s not too late.”</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Yan Shan hid his Water Phase Token; he was prepared for this person.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Su Zinan had been watching him all along!</p><p>“People like Zhu Wu Dao treasure the Five Elements Tokens.  I imagine this treasure will be very useful in the Immortal Sect's hidden ruins. Could you enlighten me, friend?  And, how about giving Su this Water Element Token you possess?” Su Zinan acted as if victory was assured, speaking arrogantly, his hands clasped behind his back as he strolled forward, seemingly slow but actually urgent.</p><p>Yan Shan's expression darkened.</p><p>Even if Su Zinan suspected him, he shouldn't be so certain the Water Element Token was in his possession!</p><p>“When did I reveal my identity?”</p><p>Yan Shan didn't deny it; there was no point.</p><p>He recalled the battle on the snowy plains.  He faked his death and escaped, never directly confronting Lao Wu.</p><p>Though Daoist Qingfeng eventually saw through his scheme, Su Zinan claimed he was seeking revenge on Qingfeng's companions, suggesting no alliance had been formed.</p><p>His identity shouldn't have been exposed.  Why was Su Zinan so confident?</p><p>“When I discovered the secret of the snowy plains, I noticed a mysterious expert had visited – you, I presume. I left my deer carriage near the plains, waiting for you, but instead met someone skilled in fire.  Lao Wu wasn’t his match and retreated in defeat.</p><p>“If you possessed the power of the Fire Demon, you would have succeeded long ago, without needing such extensive planning.  You two must not be the same person.</p><p>“The Fire Demon is either your ally or your enemy!</p><p>“In my opinion, the chances of you two falling out are higher.</p><p>“While the Fire Demon is incredibly powerful, he may not surpass your years of scheming on the snowy plains.</p><p>“Furthermore, if the Fire Demon obtained the Water Element Master's relic and learned the secrets of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, why wouldn't he come to Nanjiang himself and miss this grand event?</p><p>“The Fire Demon's continued absence leads me to believe the Water Element Master's relic is in your hands. Your greatly improved cultivation after obtaining such a great opportunity is only natural.”</p><p>In Su Zinan’s account, Qin Sang had become the “Fire Demon.”</p><p>Su Zinan didn't mind explaining this to Yan Shan; it was his masterpiece of deduction.</p><p>Upon seeing the man in white robes, Su Zinan grew suspicious, pondered for a long time, and deduced a plausible explanation.</p><p>It didn't matter if he was wrong; a test would reveal the truth!</p><p>The facts proved Su Zinan had gambled correctly!</p><p>With a playful look, he sized up the increasingly gloomy Yan Shan, a slight smile playing on his lips.  “Are you afraid of me, friend, that you dare not reveal the Water Element Token?”</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>Yan Shan exploded with rage.</p><p>He had only recently broken through to the late Yuan Ying stage. His power might not match that of an established grand cultivator like Su Zinan, but he was no pushover.</p><p>Earlier, under the guise of conversation, he had investigated the surroundings, confirming that Mo Xing Dao wasn't present. Su Zinan coming alone to assassinate him was extremely underestimating!</p><p>Su Zinan's smile vanished, his face hardening, his voice turning icy. “A newly ascended grand cultivator – perfect to become the second main soul of my Divine Banner!”</p><p>Besides the Water Element Token, he also wanted Yan Shan's Yuan Ying!</p><p>Before his words finished, Su Zinan's speed suddenly surged, his killing intent shocking.</p><p>Yan Shan already had a plan.</p><p>Knowing he wasn't Su Zinan's match, he wouldn't be foolish enough to fight to the death.</p><p>On his way here, Yan Shan had been observing the surroundings, memorizing specific locations – precisely for such a contingency.</p><p>In danger, he could use the terrain and restrictions of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect to escape, easily shaking off Su Zinan.</p><p>Su Zinan swiftly closed in.</p><p>Yan Shan stomped heavily on the ground.</p><p>A great ‘whoosh’ of water sounded, and water vapor filled the air around the rocks.</p><p>The previously dry ground was suddenly flooded.</p><p>The flood appeared out of nowhere, its waves surging with a force comparable to a mighty river!</p><p>Yan Shan stood on a wave crest, then a colossal wave erupted, seemingly shattering his form and making him vanish.  The wave then split into dozens of illusory images.</p><p>Each image was translucent, composed of water, with features closely resembling Yan Shan's.</p><p>Yet Yan Shan's true form was nowhere to be seen!</p><p>The illusions appeared and charged backward.</p><p>Su Zinan sneered and with a ‘whoosh’, a dragon tendon net shot out, spreading in mid-air to its maximum extent, forming a gigantic net aiming to ensnare all the illusions.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The dragon tendon net entangled the illusions, causing them to shatter into droplets of water, dissipating.  But this was insufficient to force Yan Shan's true form to reveal itself.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The flood reversed.</p><p>The raging waters surged skyward, the waves forming white crests like clouds in the sky, pounding the net.</p><p>Yan Shan, hidden among the illusions, fled without looking back.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>The ground ahead trembled and cracked.</p><p>A demonic banner slowly rose from the fissure, blocking Yan Shan's escape route.</p><p>Yan Shan's heart tightened, a sense of foreboding washing over him.  He then saw three ghostly figures emerge before the banner; one emaciated and aged figure was Lao Wu!</p><p>Lao Wu's eyes were closed, his body somewhat translucent, lifeless, not looking like a living person.</p><p>Yet he held a talismanic disc, and his Blood-Drinking Devil Halberd spun at his side, possessing his former abilities!</p><p>Suddenly, Lao Wu opened his eyes.</p><p>The Devil Halberd hummed.</p><p>His deathly gaze seemed to pierce Yan Shan's heart, sending chills down his spine!</p>
