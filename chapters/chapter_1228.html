<h1>Chapter 1220: A Gathering of Experts</h1><p>Chapter 1220: A Gathering of Experts</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang, while in quiet cultivation at Sandie Pass, received a summons to attend a meeting in Tianxing City.  Jing and Lin were not invited; he set off alone, first rendezvousing with the Snake King at Hukou Pass.</p><p>They were again greeted by Elder Ji.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King followed Elder Ji to an ice palace surrounded by wind and snow.  It was said to be the place where the Tianxing Plateau cultivators established the Tianxing Alliance, a sacred site.</p><p>"Several fellow cultivators haven't arrived yet. I need to go outside the city to greet them. Please feel free to look around," Elder Ji said, leading Qin Sang to the entrance of the ice palace and gesturing inside.</p><p>"Thank you, Elder Ji," Qin Sang and the Snake King replied, bowing.</p><p>Approaching the palace, it opened automatically, revealing the voice of Daoist Zhenyi from within.</p><p>"Snake King and Daoist Mingyue have arrived. I apologize for not greeting you personally. Please forgive my oversight," the voice said.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Snake King exchanged a glance before entering the ice palace.  They immediately saw Daoist Zhenyi descending from the main seat.</p><p>Several cultivators were already seated within the palace, all renowned experts from both regions.</p><p>Behind Daoist Zhenyi stood two armored generals, supposedly twin brothers.  They had cultivated a unique dual-cultivation technique focused on extreme yang energy, highly effective against demonic entities.  Together, their strength was comparable to that of a peak mid-Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>These two were taken on as disciples by Daoist Zhenyi during their Qi Refining stage, owing him unwavering loyalty. This ensured Daoist Zhenyi's unshakeable position within the Tianxing Alliance.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance was unified, with Daoist Zhenyi effectively representing the entire group. Thus, no other Tianxing Alliance elders were present.</p><p>In contrast, the forces of Xiao Han Region appeared fragmented and disorganized.</p><p>Three individuals sat to Daoist Zhenyi's left.</p><p>Qing Jun, disguised as Leng Yuntian.  Qin Sang recently learned that her identity extended beyond merely being the leader of the Yuanshen Sect. The Lord of Yinshan Pass, representing the unaffiliated cultivators, had proactively sought her favor. Qing Jun no longer made any effort to conceal her true identity, and many Yuan Ying cultivators were aware of her deception. However, even the Red-Haired Ancestor had kept silent about it.  Being shrewd individuals with little connection to Leng Yuntian and no grievances against Qing Jun, no one had made a move to expose her.</p><p>Next was Daoist Chongyi, Si Di's master. Though his cultivation was inferior to Duke Dongyang, his influence was significant, as he represented a lineage with three Yuan Ying cultivators. In the righteous path, he stood on equal footing with Duke Dongyang.</p><p>The last was the person Qin Sang had been eager to meet: Xiang Qing, the current sect leader of Qingyang Demon Sect.  Despite being a newly ascended Yuan Ying cultivator, his mastery of the Qingyang Demon Fire was exceptional. His impressive performance in numerous battles, along with his ability to overcome opponents of higher cultivation, had earned him the title of "late bloomer" and established him as the second most powerful figure in the demon path, second only to Demon Lord Tongyou.</p><p>Xiang Qing appeared as a young man in his twenties, with sharp eyebrows and bright eyes. He sat upright with a composed and cold demeanor.</p><p>Once Demon Lord Tongyou and Duke Dongyang arrived, representatives from all factions were present—a gathering of top-tier experts.</p><p>As Qin Sang and the Snake King entered, everyone rose to greet them.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, they found seats. Before sitting, Qin Sang's gaze fell upon Xiang Qing. She smiled faintly and nodded at him.</p><p>Xiang Qing felt somewhat puzzled. This was his first encounter with the masked Mingyue Yao Wang (Moonlit Demon King). He couldn’t understand why she seemed to be extending goodwill toward him.  However, he had often heard tales of her slaying Yuan Ying cultivators. He also knew she had infiltrated Yuanxu, battled Ye Lao Mo (Old Devil Ye), and escaped, demonstrating an ability to challenge stronger opponents. She was a rising star among the demon race.  It wouldn't hurt to cultivate a positive relationship.</p><p>Xiang Qing offered a slight smile and a nod in return.</p><p>Everyone noticed this exchange, their gazes shifting between Qin Sang and Xiang Qing, but no one commented.</p><p>While waiting for everyone to arrive, discussions began on cultivation insights.  With so many powerful cultivators gathered, they freely shared information, as long as it didn’t involve core secrets. Qin Sang and the Snake King spoke about aspects of demon cultivation, and everyone listened attentively.</p><p>After a stick of incense, Demon Lord Tongyou and Duke Dongyang arrived together.</p><p>"Our apologies for keeping you waiting," Duke Dongyang said smoothly, first apologizing and then greeting everyone.  Finally, he turned to Qin Sang. "This must be Daoist Mingyue? I've long admired your reputation, yet I've never had the pleasure of meeting you until now!"</p><p>"Not at all! It is I who am honored to meet you, Duke," Qin Sang replied with a calm tone, smiling subtly and rising to return the greeting.</p><p>Duke Dongyang could never have imagined that this demon king was once his disciple, someone he had manipulated.</p><p>Seeing their insincere pleasantries, Qing Jun smirked inwardly.</p><p>After the pleasantries, Daoist Zhenyi went straight to the point, requesting that the Snake King and Qin Sang recount their experience in Yuanxu.  Qin Sang and the Snake King had rehearsed their story beforehand, with the Snake King taking the lead.</p><p>After the others finished speaking, Xiang Qing continued, "After receiving news from the two Demon Kings, I personally ventured deep into the inner valley of Wuya Valley and discovered anomalies.  Storms have repeatedly struck Wuya Valley recently. While fluctuations in the ancient restrictions have caused storms in the past, they've never been this frequent. I found the Blood Lake, where the ancient restrictions are constantly trembling, as if someone is forcefully trying to break them. If the two Blood Lakes are connected, it's highly likely that Ye Laomo is influencing this…"</p><p>Xiang Qing succinctly presented his findings and speculations.</p><p>Chongyi Daozhang suddenly chuckled, "Ye Laomo, plotting something again. Is he after the Blood Lake?  His alliance with Zu Yuan and their assault on Tianxing Plateau are likely a diversion, to distract us and prevent us from discovering the anomalies in Wuya Valley and disrupting their plans at the Blood Lake?"</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>Chongyi Daozhang's guess seemed far-fetched, yet strangely plausible.</p><p>It was incredible. This war has lasted so long.  What treasure lies within the Blood Lake that it warrants Zu Yuan's massive mobilization and cooperation with Ye Laomo?</p><p>Seeing the expressions on their faces, Chongyi Daozhang laughed, "I'm just speculating. However, the fact that Ye Laomo is neglecting the battlefield itself suggests the Blood Lake is extremely important to them, and we cannot let them succeed."</p><p>"Wuya Valley lies within Xiaohan Domain. What do you two think?"</p><p>Zhenyi Daozhang interjected, but instead of offering an opinion, he looked towards Dongyang Bo and Tongyou Mojun.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun said gravely, "Xiang Daozhang's thorough inspection confirms that the Blood Lake's restrictions remain strong. It will take Ye Laomo considerable time to break through.  We need to station guards in Wuya Valley to relay information promptly. Chongyi Daozhang is right; this is a serious matter. We cannot let Ye Laomo act with impunity. Someone needs to go in and disrupt their scheme. But we must also guard against Zu Yuan using a feint, a ploy to draw us away."</p><p>Zhenyi Lao Dao remained impassive, glancing at the other Xiaohan Domain Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>These individuals represented various factions, always locked in conflict, yet a clear consensus was evident. After Tongyou Mojun finished speaking, everyone nodded in agreement, with no objections raised.</p>
