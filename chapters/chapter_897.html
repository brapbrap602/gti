<h1>Chapter 889: The Bright Island Dharma Assembly</h1><p>Everyone fell silent, not daring to say anything more, and dispersed.</p><p>The avatar was the last to leave.</p><p>“Forbidden grounds? Has it become an openly known forbidden area, or is it a place sealed away in some unknown location?”</p><p>He muttered to himself, feeling that the secrets involving Duel Peak were growing, and the Azure Edge Sect seemed to be extremely wary of it. This made him even more curious about what kind of legacy was hidden there.</p><p>Returning to his stone chamber, after refining the day's spiritual materials, he left the stone hall and returned to his cave to continue condensing his Yin-Yang Armor. Early the next morning, he flew towards a pagoda-like peak of the Azure Edge Sect on his magical tool.</p><p>The mountain was covered with wooden halls, a place where the sect's scriptures were stored.</p><p>Passing through areas where low-ranking disciples were active, the avatar simply greeted acquaintances and continued flying up the mountain without stopping.</p><p>Entering the mountain, he paid spirit stones and began to browse the scriptures.</p><p>He frequented this mountain for the next few days.</p><p>New disciples could only access the scriptures on the first floor of the pagoda. Although the scriptures contained many secrets of the Boundless Sea that he hadn't known before, he couldn't find what he was really looking for.</p><p>Closing a bamboo slip, the avatar pondered, "It seems that I must condense the Yin-Yang Armor as soon as possible and become a true inheritor of Yin-Yang Peak. Only true inheritors are qualified to enter and exit those forbidden areas of the sect. Fortunately, the standard for Yin-Yang Peak to accept true inheritors is not Foundation Establishment, but only the successful condensation of the Yin-Yang Armor, proving one's aptitude to cultivate the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art.' Otherwise, even if I'm confident that I can reach the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement and establish my foundation within one or two years, such a cultivation speed would be too astonishing. It would definitely arouse suspicion…"</p><p>With this in mind, the avatar didn't stay any longer, returning to his cave to focus on condensing the Yin-Yang Armor.</p><p>His cultivation speed was no slower than those of the new disciples with great talent. As time passed, more and more Yin-Yang energy condensed on his body's surface, gradually forming the rudimentary shape of armor.</p><p>On this day, the avatar suddenly received a message from a senior brother, saying that someone was looking for him outside the sect.</p><p>After delivering the message, the senior brother wore a knowing smile.</p><p>“I’ve hardly interacted with any cultivators outside the sect, who would be looking for me? Could it be…?”</p><p>A thought struck the avatar. He flew out of the sect and saw Fang Ting standing there prettily.</p><p>“Brother Zhang!”</p><p>Seeing the avatar, Fang Ting's eyes lit up, and she waved vigorously. When the avatar landed in front of her, her expression turned solemn, and she stammered nervously, "Brother Zhang, I'm sorry, I didn't know Master would…"</p><p>The avatar waved his hand, "Junior Sister, there's no need to apologize, I know you meant well! Besides, Senior Chen may not have been targeting me, perhaps he was planning to arrange a good opportunity for me, but it was interrupted by Patriarch Huayang's sudden arrival…"</p><p>Given the relationship between the Azure Edge Sect and the Misty Pavilion, it wasn't wrong for them to address each other as senior brother and junior sister.</p><p>"Brother, you don't blame me! That's great!"</p><p>Fang Ting seemed to have a weight lifted from her heart, and she breathed a sigh of relief, overjoyed. “I was afraid Brother would misunderstand me, that's why I hesitated for so long. Otherwise, I would have visited you long ago!”</p><p>“I'm not one to be ungrateful,” the avatar smiled slightly. “However, Junior Sister, did you ask Senior Chen for permission to come here?”</p><p>Fang Ting pouted, “Brother, you still blame Master in your heart, but it’s understandable. You’ll know later, Master isn’t a bad person!”</p><p>Then, Fang Ting lowered her voice and pointed at the Azure Edge Sect, mysteriously saying, “Master has been sulking since he went back, and he’s now in seclusion, vowing to break through to the mid-stage of Core Formation…”</p><p>The avatar suddenly understood. Anyone who experienced such humiliation in the Misty Pavilion's ancestral hall would feel indignant.</p><p>Senior Chen’s sect couldn't possibly be stronger than Patriarch Huayang’s, so he could only strive to improve his cultivation, hoping to surpass him in cultivation and have a chance to avenge the humiliation.</p><p>Seeing that the avatar truly didn't mind the previous incident, Fang Ting returned to her usual cheerful demeanor.</p><p>The avatar brought her into the sect and gave her a detailed tour. He also learned from her that Fang Ting had long been chosen by Senior Chen as a disciple.</p><p>However, she hadn't known Senior Chen's true identity before and only discovered the truth after joining the Misty Pavilion.</p><p>Finally, after seeing off the reluctant Fang Ting, the avatar couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>"This girl has a very high status in the Misty Pavilion, and Old Chen is so protective of her.  I doubt many of her peers dare to approach her. She sees the avatar as a friend.  Maintaining this identity is truly troublesome, having to carefully deal with everyone. I need to find the Duel Peak legacy and leave as quickly as possible. Once I solve the third stage of the 'Celestial Demon Refining Form', my true body can find a safe cave to cultivate in seclusion for decades and wait for the Seven Kills Hall to open…"</p><p>The avatar murmured to himself.</p><p>Although he was still some distance away from truly condensing the Yin-Yang Armor, after some consideration, the avatar decided to visit Senior Uncle Yang.  He headed straight for Yin-Yang Peak and quickly arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The spiritual energy here was several times denser than at Jade Finger Peak, showing that it was one of the best spiritual vein locations within the sect.</p><p>The avatar stopped at the foot of the mountain, took out a token, and channeled spiritual power to activate the restriction on it.</p><p>Before long, a streak of light appeared from the mountain, revealing the figure of a Dao Child.</p><p>He looked somewhat displeased, seemingly annoyed by the avatar's disturbance at this time.  He scolded, "You've only recently joined the sect, why aren't you diligently cultivating and instead running around everywhere?"</p><p>The avatar appeared fearful and said timidly, "Reporting to Senior Uncle Yang, this disciple has just condensed the rudimentary form of the Yin-Yang Armor and feels that I've encountered a bottleneck, with no progress for several days. I have some questions that I wish to ask Senior Uncle…"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Hearing the avatar's words, the Dao Child’s anger subsided, replaced by surprise.  "You've condensed the rudimentary form of the Yin-Yang Armor so quickly? Show me!"</p><p>The avatar complied, making hand seals. Gray energy swirled around his body, barely condensing into a vaguely armor-like shape.</p><p>Under deliberate control, his condensation speed wasn’t the fastest among the Yin-Yang lineage, but it was still among the best.</p><p>Seeing the rudimentary armor on the avatar, the Dao Child's eyes widened in surprise. "It seems I underestimated your talent.  This progress is even better than mine back then! In that case… you might be able to make it to the Bright Island Dharma Assembly."</p><p>The Dao Child pondered, his last words spoken so softly they were almost a murmur.</p><p>However, the avatar still caught a few words.</p><p>This Bright Island Dharma Assembly was something he had never heard of before.</p><p>The Dao Child raised his eyelids and said in a deep voice, "Condensing the Yin-Yang Armor is used to test talent. In fact, once the rudimentary form of the Yin-Yang Armor appears, one can begin cultivating the technique. You were able to condense the rudimentary form so quickly, your talent is clearly exceptional, and there’s no need for further testing. Even if I were to impart the true inheritance to you now, it would be justifiable.  Master previously said that given the urgency, we should be flexible.  We're currently short-handed, so there’s no need to always adhere strictly to the rules…”</p>
