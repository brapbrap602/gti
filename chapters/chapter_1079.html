<h1>Chapter 1711: Ancient Seal</h1><p>Chapter 1711: Ancient Seal</p><p>A surge of demonic energy filled the mountain valley.</p><p>Though the Ancient Demon had been ambushed and his power diminished, his alliance with the East Pole leader still forced the West幽 leader into a desperate retreat.  Cornered by the sword formation and the Ancient Demon, her situation was perilous.</p><p>The Demon Lord charged into the fray to rescue the West幽 leader.</p><p>A strange smile crept across the Ancient Demon's face.  "Copying my rune formation, affecting me once... you really thought I was helpless? I had planned to keep a demonic servant, but it seems I'll have to cultivate one later."</p><p>The East Pole leader, receiving his orders, attacked with everything he had.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The sword formation collapsed, coalescing into a single spirit sword that shot towards the West幽 leader like a rainbow piercing the sun.</p><p>Forced to defend herself with her treasure flute, the West幽 leader's divine light dimmed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Ancient Demon backhanded the East Pole leader, crushing his skull and seizing his nascent soul.</p><p>The nascent soul, bound by magical restraints, showed pain on its face. Knowing it was about to be devoured, it instinctively resisted.</p><p>The Ancient Demon coldly snorted, suppressing the nascent soul before stuffing it into his mouth and voraciously consuming it. His aura swelled.</p><p>The chain-like markings on his body instantly faded further.</p><p>"Die!"</p><p>Using the lingering power of the sword formation, the Ancient Demon flickered, his body practically touching the West幽 leader.  His expression was impassive as he stared into her eyes.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Terror filled the West幽 leader's face.</p><p>*PFFT!*</p><p>The West幽 leader, her soul scattered in fright as she desperately tried to resist, suddenly felt a chill in her chest. Looking down, she saw her body had been ripped open.</p><p>Her nascent soul escaped, but unlike the North Star leader, she didn't even have a chance to teleport before being instantly restrained, then snatched by the Ancient Demon.</p><p>The Demon Lord, startled, immediately retreated from the mountain valley.</p><p>He swept his gaze around – his companions were gone.  牟 Old Demon was crushed by the Demon-Subduing Stele, the West幽 leader devoured by the Ancient Demon. A wave of sadness washed over him.</p><p>The Demon Lord glared at Ling Zhuzi.  If this person hadn't interfered and entangled him for so long, he could have at least saved one of them.</p><p>At that moment...</p><p>An old woman and an old man sat on one side of the valley. The old man took medicine as the old woman helped him heal.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and Li Madam were on the other side of the valley.</p><p>The Demon Lord stood alone at the valley's exit.</p><p>The three groups faced each other, the Ancient Demon trapped in the middle.</p><p>"Three top human experts gathered together – quite a display!"</p><p>The Ancient Demon sneered, chewing on the nascent soul with a look of relish. He showed no fear facing three Nascent Soul late-stage experts.  As long as the human cultivators didn't attack, he wouldn't either. He focused on absorbing the power of the three nascent souls to break the seals on his body.</p><p>"You must be South Return Fairy, right? I never expected that the once-renowned beauty of the Canglang Sea would be so old now, and a descendant of the Four Saints Palace. No wonder you disappeared suddenly."</p><p>Sensing the old woman's furious gaze, the Demon Lord didn't mind. He smiled and greeted her.</p><p>"I never imagined that the once-daring heir to Demon Island would be so despicable and vicious!"</p><p>South Return Fairy angrily retorted. She had learned the truth from her senior brother and hated the Demon Lord intensely.</p><p>"I calculated that the Four Saints Palace would certainly have top experts, so I had 牟 Old Demon stand by. But I didn't expect there to be two.  It seems the Four Saints Palace is recovering its strength.  Truly worthy of being Four Saints descendants, with such deep foundations.  The victor claims all.  South Return Fairy, if you want revenge for your companions, I'm happy to oblige. However, the Ancient Demon and that old geezer are watching, so it might not be the best time.  And your aura seems a bit strange... did you use the Four Saints Palace's famous Yuan Sacrifice Technique?  I imagine it won't last long!"</p><p>The Demon Lord sighed with regret.</p><p>"I also know the Yuan Sacrifice Technique.  Want to try it? Cough… cough…"</p><p>The old man's anger flared.</p><p>Though the Yuan Sacrifice Technique could temporarily increase one's cultivation, the cost was immense. At the time, seeing that the Ancient Demon hadn't yet broken his seals and the situation wasn't critical, he hadn't used it.  He hadn't expected so many unscrupulous people to be eyeing him, vying for the Demon-Subduing Stele.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi waved his whisk.  "I have no intention of causing trouble with you all, but we cannot let the Ancient Demon loose, lest the Canglang Sea suffer."</p><p>"Holier-than-thou!"</p><p>The Demon Lord sneered. "Who was it who tried to seize the Demon-Subduing Stele just now?"</p><p>"If I had known earlier that you intended to unseal the Ancient Demon, I would have certainly stopped you."</p><p>"Unfortunately, I only found out you were gathering people, preparing for the Five Elements Chaos Killing Formation. Only then did I learn the truth," Ling Zhuzi said solemnly.</p><p>The Demon Lord narrowed his eyes, suddenly understanding. "Elder Yin's disappearance... was that your doing?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi readily admitted, "It did take some effort."</p><p>"At that time, I only mentioned it to Elder Yin once. Before preparations even began, you..."</p><p>The Demon Lord snorted coldly.  Knowing there was certainly more to it, he didn't press further.  His tone changed. "So what if we release the ancient demon? The three of us, along with the Demon Suppressing Stele, killing this demon would be no problem! Are you content to remain at the late Yuan Ying stage? This demon must know many secrets. If we capture and soul-search it, we're sure to find a way forward!"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi's expression shifted slightly. He glanced at the ancient demon.</p><p>The ancient demon was absorbing Yuan Ying, breaking the seal.  It didn't react to the Demon Lord's words.</p><p>The ancient demon was indeed powerful, but it proved to be far weaker than rumored.</p><p>At this moment, Nan Gui Xianzi helped her senior brother stabilize his injuries, coldly saying, "The ancient demon can be killed, but do you think it's the only one here?"</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord were doubtful.</p><p>Nan Gui Xianzi snorted coldly, pointing to the stele. "Yi Tian Peak has a large ancient prohibition.  A crack appeared in the prohibition, releasing the ancient demon and slaughtering countless human experts. Four ancestors sacrificed their lives to seal the ancient demon here! Those altars throughout the inner and outer halls were actually for repairing the prohibition; sealing the ancient demon was secondary. The Demon Suppressing Stele isn't some treasure; it's the core of the ancient prohibition.  After suppressing the ancient demon, you can examine it. If you dare release the ancient demon, just take the Demon Suppressing Stele."</p><p>The two exchanged glances.</p><p>From Nan Gui Xianzi's tone, it didn't seem to be a lie.</p><p>"They say there were Nascent Soul stage cultivators among the Four Saints. They actually had to sacrifice their lives to seal this demon?"</p><p>The Demon Lord was startled, shocked by the ancient demon's power back then.</p><p>Nan Gui Xianzi's words revealed a mystery.</p><p>If the Four Saints were willing to act, with the power of the Wu tribe, there shouldn't have been much resistance.</p><p>The two tribes had a bloody feud, yet they only drove the Wu tribe to the Wu God Continent and stopped there, giving them a chance to breathe. It turns out there was a change in the Seven Killing Hall!</p><p>"If the ancient prohibition opens, will more ancient demons be released? How many demons are sealed beneath the mountain?" Ling Zhuzi exclaimed.</p><p>"This demon has absorbed three Yuan Ying. The three of us can't suppress it in a short time.  The Demon Suppressing Stele also needs my senior brother to prepare for a while after each activation. Time is of the essence. If you don't want a horde of demons to rampage, immediately send people to repair the altars."</p><p>Nan Gui Xianzi handed the Demon Suppressing Stele to the elder.</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Ling Zhuzi hesitated.</p><p>In the group, only Li Fu Ren could leave to repair the altars.</p><p>If Li Fu Ren left, he would be alone.</p>
