Chapter 575: The Palm Print


Amidst the fragmented landmasses, the space was turbulent, filled with chaotic currents.
Countless such fragments drifted within the inner sanctum.
These fragments, remnants of a shattered land, held little of value. Qin Sang was fortunate; the fragment he landed on housed an ancient temple.
The true treasures lay within the largest landmass at the core, the true inner sanctum.
Those who entered through the jade disc were typically transported to these outer fragments, with only a few directly reaching the central landmass.
Although an ancient temple stood nearby, Qin Sang didn't want to waste time. Alone and outnumbered, he had little hope of breaking the ancient restrictions, so he didn't even bother ascending the mountain for a closer look.
Recalling the maps given to him by Granny Jing and Yun Youzi, he easily pinpointed his location. Not far from the central landmass, he concealed himself and used his movement technique to reach the edge of the fragment.
The moment he left the fragment, a powerful force pressed against him. He groaned, caught between two turbulent currents.  It was incredibly unpleasant.
These currents were immensely powerful and difficult to resist. Those caught within them could only drift, waiting for an opportunity to navigate the gaps.
Fortunately, the currents weren't inherently aggressive. As long as one avoided the fastest and largest currents, and didn't get swept into the depths of the void, there was no mortal danger.
Qin Sang summoned his Ebony Sword, wielding it with far greater ease than before.
As he entered the turbulent flow, Qin Sang vanished into the swirling clouds.  Remembering the positions of two nearby land fragments, he expertly maneuvered his sword, weaving through the currents towards the larger fragment.
Soon, Qin Sang felt solid ground beneath his feet again.  He breathed a sigh of relief, glancing back with lingering fear.
Easier said than done.
Some currents were incredibly fast and erratic. If caught, one could be swept into the void, with little hope of return.
He now knew how to identify these dangerous currents, making the rest of the journey easier.
After a brief rest, Qin Sang continued towards the next land fragment.
Hopping from one fragment to another, Qin Sang finally stopped on a small, bluish-grey stone platform. Looking down, he saw the outline of the central landmass!
Like a slumbering leviathan, it floated in the sea of clouds, casting a vast shadow. Clearly, the surrounding fragments were torn from this central landmass.
The landmass was a boundless expanse of mountains and valleys, with occasional beams of light erupting skyward like shimmering rainbows.
These beams pulsed with immense power, awe-inspiring even from afar.
Deep within the landmass, a towering mountain peak, majestic and imposing, pierced the clouds.
After observing for a moment, Qin Sang leaped down.
*Whoosh!*
The wind rustled through the trees as Qin Sang landed in the forest.  Like a cheetah, he sprang up, nimbly navigating the trees and quickly leaving the area.
The forest fell silent again.
A while later, another figure emerged from a different part of the forest.
Qin Sang cautiously surveyed his surroundings. Like the land fragments, this place was devoid of people and even living creatures.
Reaching a mountaintop, Qin Sang gazed at the central mountain, recalling the map and confirming his location.
According to Yun Youzi, the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit grew in a mystical realm, part of an ancient medicinal garden. Only a fragment of the garden remained, but it was still vast, containing valuable herbs. However, accessing it wouldn't be easy.
The ancient garden lay between Qin Sang and the central mountain, near the edge of the landmass.
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had agreed to meet near the ruins of a city close to the ancient garden.
According to their plan, Qin Sang would first meet Yun Youzi. If Yun Youzi hadn't arrived, he would leave a message and scout the area alone.
If he could reach the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and break the restrictions before the other cultivators arrived, all the better.
Then, he would help Yun Youzi obtain the healing method and finally search for Master Qingzhu's relics in the ancient temple where he disappeared. Since no one else was vying for these two locations, delaying them wouldn't matter.
He needed to act quickly. Any delay could jeopardize Lord Dongyang and Chenyan's important matter, and no excuse would suffice.
Therefore, Qin Sang flew with all his might.
With his direction clear, he urged the Ebony Sword forward, speeding through the forest.
Mountains stretched endlessly, rivers flowed.
He passed glowing ravines, deep caves, and even underwater palaces, but his focus remained unwavering. He knew his priorities.
*Rustle...*
The mountain wind shook the ancient trees, their leaves whispering.
Qin Sang descended, landing on a mountaintop. Looking down at the ruins below, a look of astonishment crossed his face.
An immense ancient city stretched below, vast beyond measure. No city he'd seen before compared.
It was a celestial city!
Now in ruins, desolate and overgrown, its buildings reduced to rubble and covered in weeds. Only a few sections of the towering city walls remained, entwined with vines.
But it wasn't the ruins that shocked Qin Sang. It was the gigantic palm print in the center of the city!
The print covered the entire city, deeply embedded in the ground. Not only were the fingers and palm clearly visible, but several ridges in the center resembled palm lines!
The surrounding buildings and walls were destroyed by the residual force of the palm strike.
Apart from the palm print, there were no other signs of battle. No sword marks or blade scars marred the ruins.
This ancient city was destroyed by a single palm strike!
"Who's there!"
Captivated by the ruins, Qin Sang suddenly sensed a strange fluctuation nearby. His expression changed, and he quickly summoned his Ebony Sword, its energy pulsing as he pointed it at the shadow of a nearby ancient tree.
The shadow stirred, revealing a figure.
"Brother Qin, you've finally arrived."
It was Yun Youzi.
"Senior?"
Qin Sang quickly sheathed his sword, utterly surprised.
He had been escorted by two Nascent Soul experts directly to the inner sanctum, without stopping. Even when separated by the spirit array, he had Lord Dongyang's talismans and artifacts for protection, minimizing any delay.
Even accounting for the time spent navigating the land fragments, he was undoubtedly among the fastest to arrive.
Yun Youzi, traveling alone, had arrived even earlier and was already waiting.
