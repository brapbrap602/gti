<h1>Chapter 2031: Witchcraft Curse</h1><p>The Young Master Xin's account is one-sided; Qin Sang naturally couldn't entirely believe it.  He does need manpower, and the demons like Lord Luo face many restrictions in human territory.  Whether to subdue the Xin family requires further consideration. Qin Sang's primary concern is the secret deep within the formation.</p><p>As they spoke, the storm at the heart of the destruction intensified, and the anomaly deep within the formation became increasingly conspicuous.</p><p>Multicolored light continuously gushed forth from the darkness. The light didn't spread outward, only surging and shifting within a radius of several dozen meters. Inside, it resembled a kaleidoscope, or perhaps a passage.</p><p>The anomaly was not yet over. Something seemed about to emerge from the depths of the passage. Qin Sang was waiting, and Young Master Xin knew he was waiting.</p><p>Young Master Xin's plea had indeed had some effect; her judicious behavior spared her from interrogation.</p><p>"What is the origin of this place?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked directly, certain Young Master Xin knew.  Her ability to control the self-destruction of this formation would be a huge joke otherwise.</p><p>Young Master Xin also understood this, and replied without hesitation: "Senior must have noticed as well. This place is connected to the Witch Clan; it's an ancient Witch Clan relic. This formation is an ancient witchcraft formation, vastly different from human traditions. Because of this,  Attendant Pei and Cultivator Zhong didn't detect the hidden danger of this formation. They couldn't have imagined that I could manipulate the formation's self-destruction, otherwise, they wouldn't have fallen into the trap so easily."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.  It wasn't just Attendant Pei and Cultivator Zhong; he hadn't sensed anything amiss before the formation's self-destruction either.</p><p>The *Panhu Sutra* records some Witch Clan traditions, but mostly concerning insect control; there's limited information on witchcraft formations.</p><p>Pausing, Young Master Xin continued, "I dare not hide anything from Senior. This place is not the secret realm my father discovered.  While secretly searching for the secret realm in Fengju Yumen according to my father's wishes, I encountered a rogue energy burst and stumbled upon this place. I unexpectedly obtained the stone talisman controlling the formation, leading to my subsequent plan."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Young Master Xin appraisingly, surprised she would voluntarily reveal such a secret.</p><p>Attendant Pei had always believed this was the secret realm the Xin family had been desperately searching for.  If he were alive, one wonders what he would think.</p><p>However, a secret realm that attracts Nascent Soul cultivators might be the Xin family's last chance at a miracle.</p><p>Giving up such a lifeline—did she truly give up resisting and sincerely pledge allegiance?</p><p>"The secret realm my father discovered would indeed help strengthen our Xin family.  It would likely cause our family's secret techniques to evolve, greatly increasing their power, and raising the strength of Xin family cultivators by a level. But it would be a drop in the bucket for changing the Xin family's circumstances.  In fact, aside from our Xin family, Attendant Pei, Cultivator Zhong, and Elder Qin probably didn't see much value in that secret realm. I deliberately exaggerated its importance; they were deceived by my lies, allowing me and the Xin family to survive until now."</p><p>Young Master Xin spoke lightly, but Qin Sang understood the danger involved.  Lies are easy to tell, but the difficulty lies in convincing two Nascent Soul cultivators, maneuvering between them like walking on thin ice.</p><p>Of course, lies alone were insufficient. Without the Soul-Devouring Spirits, the Xin family would have been annihilated. They must have assessed the risks and benefits, mutually restrained, allowing Young Master Xin room to maneuver.</p><p>"My father said that opening the secret realm requires the assistance of a weapon master. Elder Qin will understand then, that my invitation is sincere."</p><p>Young Master Xin revealed her true intentions.  After all this, she's still trying to convince Qin Sang of her harmlessness.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious. After losing the Soul-Devouring Spirits, what gave Young Master Xin the confidence to face him? He didn't know the Soul-Devouring Spirits were dead at the time.  After witnessing her killing Attendant Pei and Cultivator Zhong, he would certainly be wary.</p><p>Young Master Xin must have calculated this, but she didn't account for the Qianjun Ring!</p><p>Qin Sang merely nodded, gazing into the depths of the formation, remaining silent.</p><p>Seeing his lack of reaction, Young Master Xin followed his gaze, whispering, "Elder Qin, are you familiar with Witchcraft Curses?"</p><p>"Witchcraft Curses?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>He had seen several insect-control witchcraft curses in the *Panhu Sutra*, but he wasn't of the Witch Clan and couldn't use them.</p><p>Legend says that at the dawn of time, primordial divine beings were born, the very first creatures after the creation of heaven and earth. They were manifestations of the Heavenly Dao, born with the Mandate of Heaven. The Wu tribe claims descent from these primordial beings…</p><p>Xin Shaozu’s words made Qin Sang prick up her ears, listening intently.</p><p>Although much of what she said stemmed from legends, certain aspects corroborated the records in the *Panhu Sutra*.</p><p>The Wu tribe calls themselves descendants of primordial divine beings, claiming to possess divine bloodline, blessed by heaven and earth from birth.  They are said to possess innate knowledge and understanding, inexplicably knowing and comprehending things.</p><p>Wu magic is a manifestation of this ability.</p><p>While both Wu magic and Daoist incantations are referred to as “spells,” seemingly both manipulating heaven and earth through incantations, they differ fundamentally.</p><p>Daoist incantations require prior cultivation and profound mastery before they can be cast.  Among humans, whether it's the Talisman or Alchemy schools, regardless of Buddhist, Daoist, or demonic affiliations, the concept of cultivation is similar: skill, technique, and Dao progress sequentially.  Skill, in relation to the Dao, embodies the principle of substance and function.  Substance is the foundation of function, and function is the manifestation of substance. Human cultivators cultivate techniques to understand the Dao, first gaining insights into the great Dao of heaven and earth. Understanding the “why” allows understanding of the “how,” thereby mastering techniques and using them to their advantage.</p><p>The Wu tribe is the opposite. Wu magic is a form of skill. They seem innately close to the Dao, able to manipulate heaven and earth through spells without understanding the underlying principles, or even the mechanisms involved, wielding divine power.</p><p>Legend speaks of certain Wu spells capable of slaying enemies across millions of miles, their methods mysterious and unpredictable. This suggests the Wu tribe might indeed be descendants of primordial divine beings, giving rise to their unique cultivation system. This also explains why the Canglang Sea Wu tribe, having lost their heritage, finds it so difficult to adapt to human cultivation methods.</p><p>“Is there Wu magic here?”</p><p>Qin Sang focused her senses. The fluctuations emanating from the multicolored light were unlike anything she had ever encountered.</p><p>“Indeed, this place may contain a blessing spell,” Xin Shaozu nodded.</p><p>Wu spells are categorized into praise, blessing, and killing spells, each with different powers and functions.  “Blessing” implies praise and support.  As the name suggests, the praise and blessing spells in Wu magic originate from Wu tribal rituals. Unlike killing spells, those who receive blessing spells often benefit.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered. “What kind of blessing spell?”</p><p>“My previous gains were limited. After discovering the function of this Wu array, I focused on luring Mr. Pei and Zhong Liang here. This Wu array acts as a seal. Once opened, the secrets within will be revealed.  I feared leaving traces that would compromise my plan, so I didn't dare open it prematurely.  I don't know the details, but I'm certain it holds immense benefits. I would gladly obtain this spell for you, hoping to appease your anger and have you seriously consider my proposal.”</p><p>Xin Shaozu said respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Xin Shaozu, understanding this was her token of submission.</p><p>The presence of a Wu altar, sacrificial insects, a Wu array, and Wu magic confirmed this as a Wu ruin.</p><p>Qin Sang rotated the Qianjun Ring on her thumb. It seemed this ring was also inextricably linked to the Wu tribe.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed the changes in the depths of the array becoming increasingly violent.  Waves of light surged, like an invisible door opening in the void, finally revealing a glimpse of what lay beyond.</p><p>Vaguely, Qin Sang saw a corner of an ancient stone hall.  Huge stones, rough surfaces, ancient carvings—the style was remarkably similar to the Wu altars outside, clearly from the same lineage.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Whether it was the destruction of the array or the emergence of the ancient hall, a shockwave reverberated through the space.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The pent-up multicolored radiance suddenly erupted, the multicolored waves sweeping away the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze quickly scanned the void.  Wherever the multicolored waves passed, hidden objects were revealed.  The Qianjun Ring’s fluctuations indicated these were other scattered fragments.</p><p>Strangely, there was no response between the stone hall and the Qianjun Ring, contrary to Qin Sang's expectations. She had assumed the stone hall was part of the Qianjun Ring's world.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>With each wave of light, the stone hall slowly rose from the ‘passage,’ becoming clearer and clearer.</p><p>Xin Shaozu also saw the stone hall, her eyes filled with eager anticipation.</p><p>It was an ancient and imposing stone hall, with dozens of circular stone pillars standing on all four sides.  Even the dome was constructed from massive stone slabs supported by the pillars.  The stone walls and gate were also unhewn boulders, reflecting a raw, untamed grandeur.</p><p>Three flights of stone steps, each a zhang high, led to the stone hall.  The hall itself was even more imposing; its stone pillars and walls were carved with patterns, though the strokes were so simple their meaning was hard to decipher.</p><p>Approaching the passage, they looked up at the hall.  A sense of mystery and vastness washed over them, stirring their hearts and inspiring a strange, almost reverent feeling.</p><p>There were no idols. They weren't worshipping gods, but the heavens themselves; the hall seemed to be the heavens.</p><p>"Whew..."</p><p>Xin Shaozhu let out a long breath, shaking off the compulsion.  He instinctively started to ascend the steps, then paused, remembering something, and looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes scanned the murals, his brow furrowed in thought as he tried to find correspondences in the *Pan Hu Zhenjing*, but to little avail.  He recalled the Ghost Mother's words about the countless tribes within the Wu, each with vastly different traditions.</p><p>He noticed a circular indentation in the center of the stone door, containing a pattern resembling orchids.  He wondered if it was the tribe's totem.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang didn't climb the steps but instead slowly levitated, gazing at the hall levelly.</p><p>Xin Shaozhu followed suit.</p><p>The stone door was an uneven slab, not seamlessly fitted to the walls.  Gaps large enough to insert fingers existed, but it was impossible to see inside.</p><p>The hall vibrated constantly, still partially within the passage, yet the door showed no sign of opening.</p><p>"Is the praise incantation sealed within this hall?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Xin Shaozhu nodded.  "It should be."</p><p>"Only you can open it?" Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>Xin Shaozhu remained calm, meeting Qin Sang's gaze unflinchingly.  "The talisman stone has acknowledged me as its master.  Besides me, no one should be able to open the door.  If you don't believe me, try it yourself."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>He could clearly see that the hall, like the outer tombs, was surrounded by ancient prohibitions, but far more complex and mysterious. He channeled his true energy into his palm and pushed hard, but the door remained immovable.</p><p>However, letting Xin Shaozhu open the door was out of the question.</p><p>What was sealed inside might not be the incantation. Xin Shaozhu's efforts to gain his trust—was this all a ploy?</p><p>There was a considerable power difference between them.  Qin Sang could easily capture Xin Shaozhu and interrogate her.</p><p>But if Xin Shaozhu was telling the truth, even if Qin Sang placed restrictions on her and controlled her to open the door, it wouldn't guarantee success.  Such a thing wasn't impossible.</p><p>Remembering the lesson of Pei Gongfeng, he couldn't give Xin Shaozhu any opportunity in this unknown Wu relic.</p><p>Rather than opening the hall, Qin Sang would not let Xin Shaozhu open the door.</p><p>Thinking of the Qianjun Ring, Qin Sang glanced at the locations of its fragments. Since the ring and this place were inextricably linked, perhaps recovering all the fragments would provide a solution, eliminating the need for Xin Shaozhu.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang glanced at Xin Shaozhu and said flatly, "Finished?"</p><p>"Elder Qin..."</p><p>Xin Shaozhu instinctively took two steps back.</p><p>Then Qin Sang raised a hand, making a grasping motion towards her.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang moved to restrain Xin Shaozhu, the stone hall shook violently.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The sound of grinding stone reached their ears, crystal clear. Qin Sang spun around, discovering that the stone door had cracked open a fissure in the tremor.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>"Gao!"</p><p>A single, strange syllable echoed from within the hall.  It contained immeasurable meaning, sounding like an ancient incantation from ages past.</p><p>In an instant, both Qin Sang and Xin Shaozhu were stunned.</p><p>Ancient, vast, distant, aged…</p><p>Qin Sang saw a vision: a vast plain at dusk, abundant vegetation, rolling hills, wild beasts roaming and roaring.</p><p>He stood on a high mountain overlooking an ancient altar, surrounded by countless burning torches.  Below, a dense crowd knelt, led by a figure in strange attire, devoutly worshipping, chanting the same syllable.</p><p>"Gao!"</p><p>"Gao!"</p><p>...</p><p>The incantation was immense, its power shaking the heavens and earth, silencing the beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang, protected by his jade Buddha, remained unaffected. He instinctively started to retreat, then stopped abruptly, his face a mixture of shock and joy.</p><p>He finally understood the incantation's meaning.  Xin Shaozhu hadn't lied; it was indeed a praise incantation!</p><p>Wu incantations required a Wu practitioner to cast, but the target didn't need to be Wu.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped retreating, fully immersing himself in the incantation.</p><p>He even awakened the two demonic marquises sealed in the altar, the Fire Jade Centipede, the Vermillion Bird, and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly in his dantian.</p>
