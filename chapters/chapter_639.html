Chapter 631 Winged Serpent Village


“Ya Gu, you've suffered so much, but finally, your hardship has come to an end. You've received the Shaman God's blessing and met his emissary. This is what you deserve. Follow him and never come back.”
The old man looked at the empty window, his gaze hollow, murmuring towards the desolate sunset.
……
Winged Serpent Village.
The largest and most powerful village in the area, and the only one with cultivators.  Undoubtedly the dominant force, holding the power of life and death.
The village even boasted a Foundation Establishment stage elder priest, whose status was considerable throughout the Bear Mountain region.
Winged Serpent Village was located at the foot of a majestic mountain. Lush jungle covered the mountain, and a large lake connected to the main tributary of the Green Robe River lay below.
The lake's surface was like a mirror, exceptionally clear, like the eye of the earth.
The village was built around the south bank of the lake. Various wooden and bamboo houses were connected, far more luxurious than the stilt houses of Thousand Households Village.  The villagers lived prosperous lives, protected by cultivators, truly the elite among commoners.
As night fell.
The village was brightly lit. Many people, adults and children, played by the lake and in the water.
No one noticed a figure silently appearing in the center of the lake.
The strongest cultivator in Winged Serpent Village was only at the Foundation Establishment stage. Qin Sang could swagger in and easily wipe them all out.
But he didn't.
The saying goes, "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."  Saving someone starts with empowering them.
Hovering above the lake, Qin Sang freely extended his divine sense.
In the next moment, Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He had finally found Ya Gu.
She and the other 'holy maidens' were held in a wooden building on the south bank of the small lake, seemingly unharmed.  The building was divided into many rooms, one for each 'holy maiden.'
Two sturdy women, acting as guards, were in each room.
A team of highly skilled guards stood at the entrance, leaving the maidens with no chance of escape.
The maidens' rooms were lavishly decorated and filled with a peculiar incense.
Ya Gu sat by the bed, staring at the Green Cicada Coin in her hand, lost in thought. The two women watched her with hawk-like gazes, as if afraid she would escape.
This surprised Qin Sang. He assumed Ya Gu had lost the coin or that it had been taken by the village priest.  Why hadn't she broken the coin to call for help?
Seeing that Ya Gu was unharmed, Qin Sang felt less urgent. He hadn't sensed any cultivators in the village, nor any anomalies in the depths of the lake.
Looking up at the mountain peak, Qin Sang vanished.
After crossing several mountains, he discovered another world hidden within.
A lush green peak, a waterfall cascading down a cliff, and a small lake below. Several elegant bamboo houses were built around the lake.
The spiritual energy here was quite rich, comparable to Wu Yi Diao's cave, a cultivator's paradise.
No wonder there were no priests below. They were all here.
"Living the good life, aren't they?"
Qin Sang glanced coldly at the bamboo houses, easily discerning the details of the Winged Serpent Village priests inside, while they remained oblivious to the outside world.
Inside one bamboo house, two young men drank listlessly.  Colorful, strange patterns were tattooed on their faces, representing their priestly status.
One, with a sly appearance, gulped his wine and sighed, "Every Shaman God Festival, the old ancestor keeps us here, afraid we'll defile the holy maidens. These girls, chosen from various villages for their spiritual purity, are so delicate and tender, further refined by special incense and spiritual nourishment.  We can't enjoy them, yet they're fed to the serpent. What a waste!"
The other, slightly more composed, replied, "Be careful!  The old ancestor would punish you severely if he heard that. We are emissaries of the Shaman God; what kind of girl can we not obtain?  Insect Gu is our foundation. We extract the purest Yin energy from these girls to refine Flower-Red Pills and feed the Winged Serpent, enhancing our Insect Gu.  Which is more important, your pleasure or our lifeblood Insect Gu?"
"Alright, alright…"
The sly youth waved his hand impatiently. "Do you think I'm a fool? Don't I understand? We cultivate so diligently, but the hope of reaching Foundation Establishment is slim.  We're confined here, unable to enjoy life. It's frustrating! I'd rather be a village chief, free and unrestrained!"
He took a sip of wine and sighed, "It's a pity that the main ingredient of the Flower-Red Pill, Red Leaf Grass, is so scarce. We can only harvest a few plants each year, not enough to refine many pills.  Otherwise, we could capture all the girls from the villages, refine them into pills, and feed them to our little darlings.  Perhaps they could directly reach the second transformation, and we wouldn't have to work so hard."
The sly youth opened his palm, revealing a winged serpent.
The serpent was pure white, slender, about the length of his finger, with crimson tongue and eyes. It was incredibly eerie.
This was a Winged Serpent, a type of spiritual insect, and also the lifeblood Insect Gu of the Winged Serpent Village priests.
The youth dripped a drop of spirit wine into his palm, and the Winged Serpent lapped it up docilely.
The other youth shook his head and chuckled, "What good is it if your lifeblood Insect Gu transforms? If your cultivation doesn't improve, aren't you afraid of backlash?"
……
Upon seeing the name Winged Serpent Village, Qin Sang had a hunch. The priests' lifeblood Insect Gu was most likely this creature.
Winged Serpents thrived on Yin energy, were adept at concealment, and produced a potent Yin poison within their bodies.  Those poisoned suffered from extreme cold, sluggish spiritual energy, and severely diminished strength.
Raising this type of spiritual insect was useful for stealth attacks and poisoning.
The Winged Serpent wasn't ranked among the extraordinary insects because it only had the potential for three transformations. However, it ranked 473rd on the Shamanic Insect List, higher than the Ghost Head Wasp.
In places like Winged Serpent Village, where generations of priests chose the same type of lifeblood Insect Gu, there must be unique cultivation methods. The Flower-Red Pill mentioned by these two was likely such a method.
……
The room was lit by red candles.
Ya Gu stared intently at the Green Cicada Coin, her eyes unblinking for a long time, lost in thought.
Suddenly, the two women at the door collapsed.
Ya Gu was startled, jumping up to see a figure standing by her bed.
"Brother with the broken arm, your injury has healed…"
Ya Gu recognized Qin Sang immediately.
A beautiful smile bloomed on her face.
But then, her expression darkened, replaced by urgency.  "Brother with the broken arm, you must leave! Don't worry about me! There are Shaman God emissaries in Winged Serpent Village…"
"Silly girl, are you afraid that I can't defeat the village priests and that you'll implicate me? Is that why you didn't ask for help?"
Qin Sang sighed softly. "Have you forgotten? I told you, I'm very strong."
Ya Gu remained anxious. "But there are many Shaman God emissaries in Winged Serpent Village…"
"So what? They are all worthless! They harmed you. Do you dare to strike them down with a sword?"
Qin Sang held the Cold Gold Sword upside down, offering it to Ya Gu.
