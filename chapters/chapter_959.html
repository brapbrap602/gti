<h1>Chapter 951: The Ajar Door</h1><p>Chapter 951: The Ajar Door</p><p>The Heavenly Tower.</p><p>The Sword Path.</p><p>Qin Sang, completely absorbed, fought two opponents at once, his sword wheel flashing against the青砖 (qingzhuan - blue bricks) walls.</p><p>The swordsmen on the Sword Path were all top-tier experts in swordsmanship, renowned masters who could easily identify flaws and weaknesses in Qin Sang's technique.</p><p>Qin Sang swung his sword freely, experiencing the Way of the Sword, feeling his skills improve significantly.  He realized he hadn't reached the peak of "Sword Light Divergence," the stage he was currently at.</p><p>Perhaps that was why he still couldn't grasp the Sword Momentum, unable to find the key to mastering it.</p><p>Currently, while battling the swordsmen, he was also observing and learning, constantly generating new ideas and immediately incorporating them into his sword wheel.</p><p>After countless attempts…</p><p>Sometimes, the power of the sword wheel surged, easily repelling the two swordsmen.</p><p>Other times, Qin Sang hit a bottleneck, trying various methods, his sword wheel flickering erratically, even collapsing at times. Fortunately, his external manifestation was always close by, rescuing him immediately.</p><p>Despite the setbacks, Qin Sang pressed on.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The sound of steel clashing.</p><p>A swordsman's sword was severed by the sword wheel.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The sword point pressed against the swordsman's throat.</p><p>The swordsman bowed, admitting defeat, and retreated into the stone wall.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding his ebony sword, seemed to awaken from a dream. He realized they had reached the end, only two more gatekeepers remained before traversing the Sword Path.</p><p>Shaking his head, Qin Sang let out a long breath, feeling greatly rewarded, his swordsmanship having reached a new level.  He planned to continue his practice upon returning, hoping to finally grasp the essence of Sword Momentum.</p><p>"You only need to hold one of them back."</p><p>Qin Sang instructed his manifestation.</p><p>The manifestation, lacking powerful artifacts, couldn't defeat swordsmen of the same peak Golden Core cultivation level and exceptional swordsmanship. It could only hold one back to buy time, allowing Qin Sang to defeat them individually.</p><p>After taking several pills, Qin Sang restored himself to his peak condition.  He exchanged a look with his manifestation and together, they entered the final stretch of the Sword Path.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Two figures emerged from the stone wall, swords in hand, their expressions emotionless as they looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon their appearance, Qin Sang felt an immediate pressure, his expression turning serious; these two swordsmen were exceptionally strong.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The ebony sword, still, then suddenly moved, instantly transforming into a sword wheel, attacking one of the swordsmen.</p><p>Simultaneously, the external manifestation attacked the other swordsman, using his True Essence to form armor and seals.</p><p>The battle began. The two swordsmen tried to surround Qin Sang, but one was held back by his external manifestation, leaving Qin Sang to face only one opponent.</p><p>After several exchanges, the external manifestation began to falter and assumed a defensive position, securing its own safety.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced over a couple of times before confidently engaging his opponent.  His sword wheel shone brightly like the moon. The swordsman was equally matched; his sword trembled, its light dividing and reforming, sword energy gathering and dispersing as freely as a river flowing through the sky.</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  His opponent was strong, his swordsmanship reaching the pinnacle of his realm, almost touching the threshold of Sword Momentum.</p><p>But instead of fear, Qin Sang felt delighted. This was an excellent opportunity to improve his understanding of the sword, promising great rewards.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword wheel crashed into the river of sword energy, creating a huge wave.</p><p>The shockwave struck the stone wall, causing a flash of light from the blue bricks, absorbing the impact.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately maneuvered his opponent, increasing the distance between him and the other battlefield to avoid affecting his external manifestation.</p><p>*Rumble… rumble…*</p><p>Sword energy raged.</p><p>The ebony sword struggled within the river of energy. Qin Sang exerted all his strength, feeling the strain. In terms of swordsmanship, he was undoubtedly at a disadvantage. As before, he did his best, tirelessly observing every move and stance of his opponent.</p><p>The corridor was remarkably strong; the intense battle left no marks on its walls.</p><p>Before they knew it, Qin Sang and his opponent had switched positions.  After hundreds or thousands of exchanges, Qin Sang was clearly losing, forced into a corner.</p><p>His sword wheel was suppressed, weak as candlelight, the ebony sword nearly immobile.</p><p>But Qin Sang showed no signs of panic, fully focused on the battle.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ebony sword was repelled. Qin Sang's eyes flashed, as if he had just awakened.  The phoenix wings on his back suddenly glowed with blue light, then he disappeared in a flash.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The sword passed through Qin Sang's afterimage, striking the wall.</p><p>The swordsman, a perfect sword cultivator, showed no emotion at his miss. He retrieved his sword, instantly locating Qin Sang's true form, merging man and sword, chasing relentlessly.</p><p>Similar situations repeated.</p><p>Every time Qin Sang was on the verge of collapse, he used his escape technique to evade his opponent, his understanding of the Way of the Sword deepening with each encounter.</p><p>Their swordsmanship was almost completely familiar...</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, a smile appearing on her face.  She said solemnly, "Thank you to the predecessors who created the Sword Path, for guiding my cultivation!"</p><p>Before her words finished, Qin Sang's bearing drastically changed. She finally unleashed her full strength, her body transforming into a whirling sword. In an instant, she became a blade herself, fiercely attacking her opponent.</p><p>The swordsman hastily parried, only to feel an immense force strike him, forcing him back several yards.</p><p>Simultaneously, three-colored遁光 (escape light) appeared around Qin Sang.  She abandoned her current opponent, flashing to another swordsman's head, her sword-wheel descending from above.</p><p>At the same time, her external avatar, which had been on the defensive, also launched an attack.  True energy surged forth, like a dragon, striking the swordsman's chest.</p><p>That swordsman was skilled indeed; even under attack, he remained calm, retreating while drawing his sword, attempting to fight against two opponents.</p><p>But against Qin Sang, his movements were slightly too slow.</p><p>Before his attack could fully form, the sword-wheel arrived. After a deafening clash, the sword flew away, and the swordsman was forced back by the tremendous force.</p><p>The avatar arrived!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The swordsman hastily blocked the avatar's strike, looking utterly disheveled.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang used her ebony sword to intercept an attack from her previous opponent. After a brief exchange, she repeated her previous tactic.</p><p>The two swordsmen's attacks changed rapidly, but they were helpless against Qin Sang's superior evasion techniques. She systematically defeated each one.</p><p>A dent appeared on his chest. The swordsman looked down, clasped his hands together, and turned into a green light, merging with the stone wall.</p><p>The breakthrough was instantaneous. The situation reversed. Qin Sang and her avatar overwhelmed the swordsmen, quickly defeating the last one.</p><p>"I finally passed!"</p><p>Qin Sang’s face lit up.  She knew that although the swordsmen's swordsmanship was superb, they were ultimately inanimate objects, incapable of strategic thinking.</p><p>The battle was not as easy as it seemed, however. Examining herself internally, she found her true energy greatly depleted and quickly took several restorative pills before sitting down to meditate and recover.</p><p>Her avatar, covered in sword wounds, also took pills to heal.</p><p>Unsure of what dangers might lie ahead on the Sword Path, Qin Sang decided to wait until her strength recovered before proceeding.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang and her avatar stood up.</p><p>With the avatar leading and Qin Sang following, they stepped onto the stone stairs.</p><p>The stairs led straight upward, disappearing into the darkness.  They were unusually smooth, showing signs of much use.</p><p>A Tianmu butterfly landed on Qin Sang's shoulder, staring at the end of the stairs. There, it spotted a door, slightly ajar.</p>
