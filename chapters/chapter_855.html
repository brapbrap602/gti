<h1>Chapter 847: True Demonic Qi</h1><p>Chapter 847: True Demonic Qi</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Yue, we’re heading straight north.  Shouldn’t we be nearing Elder Wu’s cultivation grounds soon? This large island is at the northernmost edge of human cultivator territory. Only someone as powerful as Elder Wu could maintain control here. Now that Elder Wu has retreated to Great Desolation Island, any further north is uncharted wilderness rarely visited by cultivators.  It’s said a powerful妖族 clan resides there. Could your friend be trapped there, Fellow Daoist Yue?”</p><p>The group sped across the sea.</p><p>Kong Yun gazed north at the vast ocean, his expression grave, questioning Daoist Yue.</p><p>After setting out, they traveled day and night.</p><p>Daoist Yue led them north, but they were about to leave the former human territory, and she showed no sign of stopping, seemingly intent on taking them into妖族 territory.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Daoist Yue nodded, saying frankly, “My friend possesses unique cultivation techniques requiring a special environment, otherwise her progress would be extremely slow. After a long search, she luckily found a suitable location in the妖 Sea, where she established a secluded cave and has been cultivating. We agreed that I would retrieve her once she mastered her techniques. Unfortunately, the妖 Sea has undergone changes, becoming extremely dangerous. I fear I cannot protect her. Otherwise, why would I spend such precious treasures to ask you Daoists to help?”</p><p>Hearing Daoist Yue’s explanation, Qin Sang and the others had nothing further to say.  After all, the reward Daoist Yue offered was quite valuable, worth the trip.</p><p>“Daoist Yue offered such treasures just to find powerful protectors for this person. This person must be very important to her…”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Daoist Yue’s white hair, secretly speculating whether she was a descendant, or a successor she held high hopes for.</p><p>They traveled in silence.</p><p>Three days later, they passed Elder Wu’s cultivation grounds, which, like other islands, had been overrun by demonic beasts and reduced to ruins.</p><p>They proceeded cautiously to avoid alarming the beasts.</p><p>All four were strong cultivators, working together seamlessly without anyone holding back. When encountering demonic beasts, they either swiftly eliminated them or used coordinated tactics to mask their presence, preventing any mishaps.</p><p>Continuing north from Elder Wu's grounds into妖族 territory, where demonic beasts frequently appeared, they were forced to slow their pace, taking over a month to reach their destination.</p><p>“My friend’s cave is on an island a few dozen miles ahead. This island is vast, originally home to several powerful妖 nests. I don’t know if they've been called to Great Desolation Island.  The safety of my friend depends entirely on you Daoists.”</p><p>Daoist Yue spoke seriously, bowing slightly to the others before looking at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang assured her of his full support.</p><p>The four found a nearby rock to rest and recover.</p><p>Fortunately, the night was moonless and starless, pitch black.  Using their skills to conceal their presence, they silently advanced.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Sky-Eye Butterfly, activating its sky-eye vision. Even in the dark, he could clearly see his surroundings. Soon, a massive dark shadow appeared ahead.</p><p>The island's edge remained unseen, its size likely comparable to Great Desolation Island—a rare, gigantic island.</p><p>Before landing, they heard bird calls and animal roars. They paused briefly before soaring onto the island, quickly hiding in a dense forest.</p><p>Daoist Yue produced a map, pointing to a spot.  “The target is here.”</p><p>Qin Sang examined the map.  The location wasn't in the island's center; they could reach it before dawn.  Having confirmed the location, they immediately set off.</p><p>While moving through the forest, they sensed the presence of a demonic beast at regular intervals.  A powerful妖 presence emanated from deep within the forest.</p><p>With so many beasts on the outer edge, a large妖 nest must lie within.</p><p>Since their mission was a rescue, they decided to leave the beasts alone.</p><p>As they climbed over mountains and valleys, the terrain became increasingly treacherous.</p><p>The island's rolling hills and mountains were no match for their skills.</p><p>As dawn approached, they arrived before a deep valley, where Daoist Yue's friend's cave was hidden.</p><p>Thick fog filled the valley bottom, rising slowly.  Towering mountains surrounded the valley, trapping the fog, which had accumulated in dense clouds. Strangely, this wasn't white fog, but a grayish-white tinged with faint black, unusually cold.</p><p>Even with their high cultivation, they had to circulate their spiritual energy to dispel the chill.</p><p>Seeing this, the smile on Yue Xiangu’s face, which had been there because of their successful arrival, suddenly vanished.  She urgently said, “Could we be too late? The valley’s barrier…Fellow cultivators, please stand guard at the valley top. I will go down and see if my old friend is still there.”</p><p>With that, Yue Xiangu tapped her foot, her plain robe flowing around her, and her figure disappeared before their very eyes.</p><p>A ripple appeared in the mist, quickly settling.</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two exchanged glances, spreading out to watch different directions.</p><p>Standing at the valley entrance, the chill of the mist was even more intense, penetrating to the bone.</p><p>Qin Sang scooped up a wisp of mist, using spiritual energy to purify it. What remained was a strand of black smoke, thin as hair.</p><p>Qin Sang made a questioning sound, about to examine the smoke closely, when he suddenly heard Zhushan Weng’s voice, “Daoist, you see it too? This mist seems to contain demonic energy!”</p><p>“Truly demonic energy?” Qin Sang looked up, questioning, “I’ve dealt with demonic cultivators before, but this seems different?”</p><p>Zhushan Weng nodded, “Indeed, it’s different. Because this might be the true demonic energy of the ancient times!”</p><p>“Correct,” Kong Yun interjected, “I have a few friends in the demonic path and have read demonic scriptures. This black smoke strongly resembles the ancient true demonic energy recorded in them. In today’s cultivation world, places with true demonic energy are extremely rare, only forming under special circumstances. The demonic energy cultivated by demonic cultivators is far inferior to the ancient true demonic energy. The valley bottom is clearly a demonic land filled with true demonic energy.  Yue Xiangu’s old friend, who can actually cultivate using true demonic energy… they’re not simple.”</p><p>Zhushan Weng asked doubtfully, “I don’t seem to have heard that Yue Xiangu has any connection to the demonic path?”</p><p>Kong Yun chuckled, “I don’t know either. Why don’t you ask Yue Xiangu?”</p><p>Zhushan Weng smiled without replying.</p><p>After this brief exchange, the valley top fell silent again.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the black smoke, but couldn’t help recalling something.</p><p>After meeting Madam Liu, he had carefully asked her about the scene when Xiang Yi opened the ancient divine platform at the Qisha Hall, hoping to investigate the secrets of the East Pole Alliance and the West Gloom Alliance.</p><p>After killing that West Gloom Alliance youth, he had obtained a strange talisman, which he still couldn’t decipher, unsure of its function.</p><p>According to Madam Liu, after the ancient divine platform opened, Xiang Yi used a secret talisman to suppress the Lei Suo. The black dragon sealed within that talisman seemed to be composed of extremely pure ancient true demonic energy.</p><p>The three major merchant alliances exist outside the righteous and demonic paths. Yet, two late-stage Golden Core cultivators within the East Pole Alliance are both connected to true demonic energy.</p>
