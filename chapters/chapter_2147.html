<h1>Chapter 2137: The Obsidian Skull</h1><p>“It might be at Lu Manor, or Lu Wang might be carrying it.  Once Qin Zhenren locates the Mirage Orb, if he intends to take action, consider the Imperial Family. It will surely satisfy him.”</p><p>The Grand Tutor said earnestly.</p><p>Qin Sang, though powerful, is an outsider and not qualified to enter the Sacred Grounds of the Yi people; this treasure is useless to him.</p><p>The Mirage Orb of the Siyou Clan must be wielded by a Siyou descendant.  Within the Siyou Clan, the only one friendly with Qin Sang is Si Lu. Unless Qin Sang willingly gives it away, Si Lu certainly couldn’t offer a higher price than the Imperial Family.</p><p>The Si family of Yanshan already possesses a Mirage Orb, and Si Lu doesn't command top-tier experts, so one is enough. More Mirage Orbs wouldn't be meaningful to them.</p><p>The Sacred Grounds offer countless opportunities, but they also serve as a proving ground for Yi cultivators, a place to select the strong. It’s fraught with danger; some perils can't be avoided. Without sufficient strength, numbers aren't necessarily an advantage; the Sacred Grounds could become a death trap.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal. The Grand Tutor, not wanting to cause a rift, couldn't force Qin Sang to hand over the Mirage Orb.</p><p>As they spoke, the situation on the battlefield changed dramatically. Lu Manor's outer defenses fell, followed by the collapse of the inner defenses. Banners were torn to shreds and scattered by the wind; the protective formation was broken, and the army faced no further obstacles.</p><p>Si Lu won a decisive victory.</p><p>From that day forward, the Lu family of Hanjiang ceased to exist!</p><p>At this opportune moment, the Grand Tutor appeared and publicly announced the Imperial edict, installing Si Lu as the new Yan King.  This not only signified royal recognition of his legitimacy but also tacitly approved the Lu family's demise.</p><p>Seeing the Imperial Family's stance, other factions abandoned their schemes. The Si family of Yanshan and the title of Yan King were once again familiar to the Siyou people.</p><p>Si Lu had avenged his great loss, but rebuilding the Si family of Yanshan wouldn't happen overnight. Qin Sang wasn't concerned with the subsequent details and soon returned to the Storm Realm. Su Nu and Zhu Que remained for a time to assist Si Lu.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang's departure and return hadn't taken long. Back in his cave, he awakened Min Zhuo, releasing some of the seals on him.</p><p>Min Zhuo slowly opened his eyes, realizing he was still restrained, unable to move, though his injuries had improved significantly.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had fed him various healing elixirs and expended his true energy to personally treat him.  However, Min Zhuo didn't believe Qin Sang was acting out of kindness, yet he didn't know what schemes the other man held.</p><p>“Qin Zhenren, what do you intend to do with this old man? Just get it over with!”</p><p>Min Zhuo said coldly.</p><p>He'd initially held a glimmer of hope of allying with Qin Sang, but Qin Sang's recent behavior showed no such intention. He gradually realized Qin Sang probably wouldn't let him leave alive, and Qin Sang's strange actions sent a chill down his spine.</p><p>Qin Sang produced two cushions, sitting on one. He gestured with a finger, and Min Zhuo, unable to resist, was moved to sit opposite him.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>Min Zhuo sensed danger and shouted.</p><p>With that, the Qianjun Ring emitted a flash of light, shooting out a beam of obsidian light—a skull. The skull glowed warmly with an obsidian sheen. Its eye sockets were empty, yet a strange light seemed to flicker within them.</p><p>This obsidian skull was obtained when Qin Sang killed the ancestor of the Minghu, formed from the ancestor's deceased body.</p><p>Initially cracked, Qin Sang didn't know its capabilities and put it away. Later, during his leisure time, he studied it, discovering it could self-repair; thankfully, it wasn't the Minghu ancestor resurrected.</p><p>Qin Sang, applying his understanding of artifact refinement, treated it as a magical artifact. After numerous experiments, his understanding of the obsidian skull deepened. He then personally refined it, developing some ideas and preparing to test them on Min Zhuo.</p><p>The obsidian skull floated between Qin Sang and Min Zhuo, facing Min Zhuo.  Stared at by its empty eye sockets, Min Zhuo felt a chill run down his spine, sensing something was amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang continuously cast several hand seals, the obsidian light shifting restlessly. The surface of the obsidian skull seemed to ignite with obsidian flames. This ethereal obsidian fire lacked any heat, making the skull even more eerie.</p><p>“Excuse me.”</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, and with a thought, the obsidian skull flew towards Min Zhuo.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>Min Zhuo was startled, about to speak, when a sharp pain struck him.</p><p>The obsidian skull landed directly on his head, its base firmly against his scalp.</p><p>Min Zhuo's head seemed to have two heads, the juncture between them erupting with jets of dark golden phantom fire.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Min Zhuo screamed in agony.  His cultivation was suppressed, but his spirit remained, and even he couldn't bear this torment.</p><p>Through the dark golden phantom fire, one could see beams of light like blades slicing through his skin.  A dark gold skull had embedded itself in his scalp and was continuing to burrow deeper, attempting to penetrate his body.</p><p>Min Zhuo was in excruciating pain, but his entire body was restrained; he couldn't even struggle.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were cold as she stared intently at the dark gold skull.</p><p>There were no normal wounds, therefore no blood.  Only countless flesh buds, like living things, writhed incessantly at the juncture, indistinguishable whether they belonged to Min Zhuo, the dark gold skull, or were some grotesque symbiosis between them.</p><p>The dark gold skull burrowed deeper, Min Zhuo emitting a raspy scream, his breathing growing weaker as corpse energy invaded his body.</p><p>Even more terrifying, Min Zhuo felt his consciousness growing hazy.</p><p>The progress was even smoother than expected.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently, but her expression tightened almost immediately after this thought crossed her mind.</p><p>The dark gold skull, almost half-embedded in Min Zhuo's body, suddenly trembled without warning.  The dark gold light flickered violently; a force within Min Zhuo was fiercely resisting.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed; she immediately intervened, trying to help stabilize the dark gold skull. But the repulsive force was too strong, to no avail.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>With a loud bang, the light dimmed, and the dark gold skull was ejected from Min Zhuo's body.</p><p>Min Zhuo's body was intact, showing no signs of injury, yet the pain remained, his breath weak, as if the dark gold skull had inflicted immense damage. He only regained a bit of his energy after a long time.</p><p>"Demon, you falsely claim to be a Daoist master!"</p><p>Min Zhuo roared, his eyes filled with hate.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him, turning the dark gold skull over in her hand, reviewing the process, and silently calculating.</p><p>Min Zhuo's cultivation was completely suppressed; logically, he shouldn't have been able to resist.  Yet, that resisting force was undeniably there.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang roughly guessed the source of this repulsive force: Min Zhuo's life instinct and willpower, and also from the dark gold skull itself.  The two were inherently incompatible; forcibly combining them was bound to fail.</p><p>She had been constrained by past experiences, attempting to control a living corpse using the dark gold skull.  Cultivators at the Transcendence stage have limitless lifespans and unwavering wills, difficult to extinguish.  It's nearly impossible to turn them into living corpses; at least, with her current cultivation, it was impossible. Besides, she had abandoned the corpse path a long time ago.</p><p>Understanding this, Qin Sang ceased her futile attempts.  She looked up at Min Zhuo and said, "I'll borrow your body for a while!"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Min Zhuo's eyes glazed over, quickly losing their light.</p><p>The leader of the Changyou tribe thus perished.</p><p>Qin Sang once again controlled the dark gold skull to descend upon Min Zhuo's head. This time, she encountered no resistance initially, but once it penetrated more than halfway, the dark gold skull's speed slowed again.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang was also comprehending the various changes and making corresponding adjustments.  Some areas she hadn't fully understood were now confirmed in reality, allowing her to quickly grasp the underlying principles.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, the dark gold skull burrowed deeper, until it was completely embedded within Min Zhuo's body.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Min Zhuo stood up straight. His eyes were closed, his facial features exactly as before; from the outside, there was no sign that a dark gold skull had invaded and replaced his skull.</p><p>It could be considered parasitism, or fusion.  Through the dark gold skull, Qin Sang effortlessly obtained a living corpse. Of course, it only seemed easy now; the previous process of comprehending and refining the dark gold skull was far from effortless.</p><p>With a thought from Qin Sang, Min Zhuo walked toward the cave entrance, completely obeying her commands.</p><p>Unlike living corpses, both the dark gold skull and the body were inanimate, possessing no will of their own. Unless a new consciousness were to emerge later, they couldn't betray Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang also flashed outside the mountain, standing in mid-air, facing Min Zhuo.</p><p>After a moment, Min Zhuo spread his arms to the sides.  Instantly, a deafening roar of water erupted, and a great river materialized out of thin air, winding its way back and forth.</p><p>He could manipulate the world's elemental energy like a true Transcendence cultivator and could use Min Zhuo's divine abilities!</p><p>This was an unexpected bonus.  Qin Sang immediately ordered Min Zhuo to attack her.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The river surged forward, its waters crashing down.</p><p>Qin Sang's Ming Mountain Armor appeared; she secretly activated her Dharma Image and the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, preparing to withstand the blow head-on.</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>Huge waves rose, thundering, washing over Qin Sang.  Qin Sang remained unmoved, like a pillar in the river.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The river water abruptly shifted, returning to Min Zhuo's side, transforming into a giant water being. A colossal fist slammed down.</p><p>Qin Sang raised a hand to block. Fist met palm, the void trembled violently. Fortunately, Qin Sang had set up protective barriers beforehand, preventing anyone else from being disturbed.</p><p>The next moment, Min Zhuo retreated, dissipating the surrounding water.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his hand, pondering silently, forming a judgment of Min Zhuo's strength.</p><p>Able to control the natural energy of heaven and earth, this alone was unattainable for a Nascent Soul cultivator.  Undoubtedly, it was the power of a Void Refinement cultivator, though slightly weaker than Min Zhuo was in life.</p><p>Qin Sang realized the ideal host for the Obsidian Skull was not a magic cultivator.</p><p>"It's best to find a Void Refinement physical cultivator, or a powerful innate Great Yao , to fully unleash the Obsidian Skull's power," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>This was another valuable aspect of the Obsidian Skull. Qin Sang discovered he could extract it from Min Zhuo's body and transfer it to another. Whether there were any limitations to this process remained to be seen.</p><p>The Obsidian Skull was undoubtedly a wondrous artifact with numerous advantages, but not without its concerns.</p><p>Besides the requirements for its host body, the previous owner, the ancestor Ming Hu, was only at the early stages of Void Refinement. The Obsidian Skull inevitably had limitations.  Despite Qin Sang's meticulous refinement—it was no longer just a skull—he had no guarantee that the Obsidian Skull could control a corpse of a higher cultivation level.</p><p>Unfortunately, on the battlefield, to prevent Lu Wang and the others from escaping, Qin Sang didn't hold back. None of the high-level cultivators survived intact.</p><p>After testing Min Zhuo's abilities, Qin Sang returned to his cave abode with him.</p><p>Min Zhuo stood silently behind Qin Sang, like a guard hidden in the shadows.</p><p>His appearance hadn't changed, his skin with an almost imperceptible obsidian sheen. Qin Sang could control his expressions, making them lively and realistic.  Except for a faint corpse aura, he was indistinguishable from a living person.</p><p>There were many ways to conceal corpse aura. Qin Sang brought out a cloak and had Min Zhuo wear it.</p><p>As long as he didn't use his powers, Min Zhuo would be like a lifeless corpse, causing no disturbance, allowing Qin Sang to keep him in his small heavenly realm. From now on, he had another fearless helper.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang had time to carefully examine the belongings of Lu Wang and the others.  Most of the Lu Family treasures only suited the Si You tribe's bloodline, so Qin Sang gave them to Si Lu to trade for useful items amongst the Si You tribe.</p><p>Upon reflection, Qin Sang didn't have any urgent needs. Only the ever-valuable and beneficial spirit pills and elixirs for cultivation would always be useful.  More is always better.</p><p>The path ahead seemed clear.  All that was needed was to follow the established path of cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang categorized the items by value and type, giving the less valuable ones to Li Yu Fu, or using them to strengthen his Daoist sect.</p><p>The world was at peace, and people's hearts were united.</p><p>He could manage his sect as he wished.  The situation in the Storm Realm was sure to change.  He still needed to establish altars, preach, and teach…</p><p>These things needed to be done step by step. Before that, he had to make a trip to Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Soon, Su Nu and Zhu Que returned.</p><p>Qin Sang explained that he would be away for a while and asked Su Nu to stay behind and watch over the sect.</p><p>Zhu Que perked up immediately, hopping onto Qin Sang's shoulder and shouting, "I'm going too! I'm going too! With me, the Zhu Que, everyone will bow down and obey. I'll definitely help you win the beauty! Hehe…"</p><p>It was unclear who he'd learned this from, but his laughter grew increasingly lecherous.</p><p>Qin Sang had already planned to bring Zhu Que. The next day, he bid farewell to Su Nu and went to Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Upon entering the Zhu Yan tribe's territory, Yuan Miao received the news and came out to greet him personally.</p><p>Since the great battle, Yuan Miao hadn't mentioned sparring again.</p><p>After a few pleasantries, they arrived at the teleportation hall, and Yuan Miao gave Qin Sang a token.</p><p>"This is our tribe's guest elder token. Keep it on you, it'll make things easier. The chief instructed me beforehand. The place you're going is in the far south of the Mist Sea, connected to the teleportation arrays of various upper clans. It's our Heavenly Department's gateway in and out of the Mist Sea. Beyond the Mist Sea lies the territory of the East Sea aquatic tribes. Although we have an alliance with them, it's a chaotic place, not safe. Moreover, you're of the human race, so caution is necessary…"</p><p>At this point, Yuan Miao slapped his forehead. "I almost forgot you can disguise yourself as a demon beast, so this journey should be fine."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, hung the token around his waist, took out a cloak, put it on, waited for Yuan Miao to activate the teleportation array, bowed to him, and stepped into the array.</p><p>The world spun, the void twisted.</p><p>After a display of light and shadows, Qin Sang felt himself land on the ground again, tens of thousands of miles away.</p>
