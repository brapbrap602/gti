<h1>Chapter 2060: The Source Sea</h1><p>“Are you two planning to confront the masters of the Changyou clan?  Unfortunately, I don't know their abilities and can't offer any useful advice,” Si Lu said, shaking his head.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at him intently and said, “What if we asked you to lead us to the Changyou clan's territory?”</p><p>Si Lu was startled.  “You want to go to the Mist Sea?!”</p><p>“Do you think it's feasible?”</p><p>Qin Sang picked up a jade cup, took a sip, and calmly watched Si Lu.</p><p>Si Lu's first reaction was that it was absurd. The Sky Department was unlike the Water Department; human cultivators rarely reached that place. Before he was banished, he had never seen a human cultivator in his clan.</p><p>The Sky Department tribes weren't exactly friendly towards unfamiliar outsiders, and the Mist Sea was not only filled with mist beasts and mist waterfalls but also various unknown dangers.  Unfamiliar individuals couldn't even take a single step.</p><p>However…</p><p>Si Lu suddenly realized this might be an opportunity for him.</p><p>He certainly wasn't content with wandering around. He wanted to return and avenge his humiliation once he had accumulated enough strength. But right now, he was still at the mercy of others, unsure when he would regain his freedom, let alone revenge.</p><p>Entering the Mist Sea, the other party would undoubtedly rely on him more; at least, he wouldn't have to worry about them suddenly turning against him.</p><p>Perhaps, they could even become his allies. Qin Sang, in particular, had retreated unscathed after fighting several powerful individuals.  Her strength might be comparable to that of Attendant Xia.  Knowing she was only at an early stage now, her future was limitless.</p><p>Furthermore, Si Lu knew that revenge wasn't something that could be achieved solely through strength. Unless he could break through to the Saint Realm, he needed support from other clansmen. But if he waited for hundreds or thousands of years to return, who would remember him?</p><p>Forced by circumstances, he couldn't return to his homeland; he was powerless. This opportunity to return to the Mist Sea was exactly what he wanted.</p><p>Si Lu looked up and cautiously asked, “May I ask, what is your reason for seeking out the Changyou clan?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled but didn't answer.</p><p>Si Lu understood. It seemed that their intentions towards the Changyou clan were not good, but as long as it wasn't against the Zhuyan clan, he didn't need to worry too much.</p><p>“If you only plan a short stay in the Mist Sea, a quick in-and-out, it won't cause much trouble. I have ways to help you conceal your identities.  The most worrisome part is the journey to the Sky Department; it's a long and dangerous path,” Si Lu considered.</p><p>“What if we plan to stay in the Mist Sea for a long time?” Qin Sang asked again.</p><p>“A long time…”</p><p>Si Lu's eyes flickered, surprised, but seeing Qin Sang's expression seemed genuine, he hesitated for a moment, then said solemnly, “May I have some time to consider?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Take your time.”</p><p>After all, the other party was a Void Refinement expert.  Unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to resort to force; it would be best if she could reach an agreement without coercion.</p><p>Si Lu thanked her and left.</p><p>Back in the side hall, Si Lu sat down on a cushion, his expression grave, lost in thought.</p><p>In fact, he had a secret he hadn't revealed. He and Attendant Xia hadn't traveled across the ocean by themselves; they had used an ancient teleportation array.</p><p>Whether it was his father who told Attendant Xia about the array, or Attendant Xia who discovered it by accident, when the crisis came, Attendant Xia saved him and activated the teleportation array, allowing them to escape their pursuers.</p><p>Unfortunately, they had barely escaped one danger when they encountered members of the Quanfeng clan, resulting in Attendant Xia's death.</p><p>It was certain that the teleportation array had been sealed for a long time and must have been left behind from ancient times. Attendant Xia claimed that no one else in the clan knew about it besides him.  Before they left, they had made arrangements and shouldn't have been discovered by the clan.</p><p>After their conversation, Si Lu understood Qin Sang's true intention—to have him lead the way to the Sky Department. But he had no idea how far Lansha Prefecture was from the Sky Department, nor how many dangers lay ahead.</p><p>Unless, he revealed this ancient teleportation array!</p><p>He had to be cautious. Once news of the array leaked, he would lose an escape route.</p><p>However, how to deal with Qin Sang was an urgent problem.  She wouldn't give him much time to consider.</p><p>Various thoughts raced through Si Lu's mind.  Now, he could be certain that the other party had no connection to his clan and could be won over.</p><p>The fact that they dared to abduct him under the noses of so many powerful individuals showed that they weren't afraid of trouble.</p><p>However, to win them over, he needed to show his worth.</p><p>After much deliberation, Si Lu finally made his decision. He returned to the main hall and woke Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing Si Lu's serious expression, Qin Sang asked, “Have you made your decision?”</p><p>Si Lu nodded and said solemnly, “I have a secret that could save us a lot of trouble on our journey to the Mist Sea. But before I tell you, I have a question.”</p><p>“Ask away,” Qin Sang said seriously.</p><p>“You said ‘a long time’ earlier.  How long exactly?” Si Lu stared into Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Time was of the essence for him; only a long-term commitment warranted his full support.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly guessed Si Lu's intentions. After some thought, she answered truthfully, "If this trip is unsuccessful, we'll return immediately. If we successfully find what we're looking for, we'll likely stay and establish a Daoist center there."</p><p>"Establish a Daoist center!"</p><p>Si Lu was quite surprised, but more so delighted.</p><p>Establishing a Daoist center in foreign territory was unconventional. However, Si Lu didn't ask why, because the more deeply the other party was connected to the foreign tribe, the more he needed to rely on them.</p><p>"In that case, I need not hide anything…"</p><p>Si Lu's tone was low as he recounted the matter of the teleportation array.</p><p>He wasn't in a hurry to express his intentions to recruit them. He understood this wasn't something that could be accomplished overnight.  His priority was gaining their trust, while simultaneously observing them.</p><p>A gleam flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. She hadn't expected this unexpected boon from saving Si Lu. She had initially thought he could guide them on a safe route, but unexpectedly, he possessed knowledge of an ancient teleportation array. With this, they could quickly reach the Celestial Department. While it was near the territory of the Si You tribe, finding the Chang You clan would then become much easier.</p><p>Some time later, Su Nu returned. Qin Sang shared the good news, and Su Nu was overjoyed.  She immediately summoned Si Lu and used her spiritual energy to create a nautical chart.</p><p>One side of the chart showed the Lan Sha Prefecture, the other showed the boundless ocean, what the Lan Sha Prefecture cultivators referred to as the outer sea.  There were various markings, the most noticeable being numerous red lines – the routes of the treasure ships.</p><p>However, the routes only had simple markings indicating the general direction of travel. Without a captain to guide them, attempting it would be a one-way trip.  Qin Sang and her companions were, of course, an exception; there weren't many places in the world that could threaten the lives of Nascent Soul cultivators. But using a treasure ship could save a great deal of trouble.</p><p>Si Lu approached the chart. He and Xia Changshi had been chased and had fled to Lan Sha Prefecture without returning.  After asking Su Nu a few questions, he was able to confirm his location.</p><p>"It should be in this area.  Once I'm within a thousand miles, I'll be able to recognize it."</p><p>Si Lu confidently pointed to a spot on the chart.</p><p>Qin Sang looked to the place he indicated, finding it in the northeast, neither too far nor too close to Lan Sha Prefecture, separated by a sea area called Yuan Sea.</p><p>From the chart, Yuan Sea was located to the east of Lan Sha Prefecture, vast in scope. Strangely, all the routes avoided Yuan Sea, as if it were a man-eating beast; not a single treasure ship dared to cross it, preferring to take the longer route.</p><p>Su Nu looked at Qin Sang and said, "The Mist Sea is in that direction. They happened to land on the route used by the foreign tribe, no wonder they ran into each other."</p><p>"Is it possible that those people discovered the teleportation array?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Si Lu shook his head. "Absolutely impossible!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the routes. Going north of Yuan Sea was closer, but also risked encountering the foreign tribe.</p><p>They needed to avoid any complications. Qin Sang pointed out several routes. "Have we investigated these ships?"</p><p>Su Nu calculated silently.  "One treasure ship sets sail a year from now."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "A year, a bit tight, but we don't need any further preparations.  If you two have no objections, we'll choose this one!"</p><p>Su Nu had no objections.</p><p>Si Lu said, "With the medicinal pills provided by the two of you, I should be able to stabilize my injuries within a year and won't be a burden."</p><p>Following this, they made preparations swiftly and efficiently.</p><p>Qin Sang asked Si Lu to mentor her two brothers during his free time, and sent them and Su Nu ahead.</p><p>She then visited several significant immortal cities in Lan Sha Prefecture, eventually acquiring a batch of treasures, including various cultivation techniques and secret arts.</p><p>Nascent Soul level inheritances were rare, and even the Liu Nian Xiao Xuan had some, but in Qin Sang's eyes, they were somewhat biased and superficial, with various flaws, hardly first-rate.</p><p>Of course, they would be more than sufficient for the cultivators of the Storm Realm.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A majestic treasure ship glided across the sea, leaving a long white trail.</p><p>The treasure ship's glow was dim, appearing rather old, but its interior held a different world, with courtyards separated by arrays and prohibitions, ensuring mutual non-interference.</p><p>Furthermore, there were merchants selling various treasures, buying beast bones and spiritual objects, as well as various places of entertainment; everything you could want was available.  A single ship was like a small immortal city. These merchants resided on the ship year-round.</p><p>Cultivators who spent years training at sea obtained supplies through these treasure ships.</p><p>Inside one courtyard, amidst small lakes and artificial hills, Qin Sang and the others sat around a stone table.  The vast expanse of the ocean outside was visible.</p><p>The treasure ship cut through the waves at great speed. They had been away from Lan Sha Prefecture for some time, and the islands they encountered were mostly deserted.</p><p>At this time, a series of clear bell-like sounds entered the courtyard.</p><p>Everyone looked up, and saw a giant sail slowly unfurl, nearly obscuring the sky.  The ship trembled slightly, slowly rising from the sea.  A sudden gust of wind arose from the heavens, and the ship's speed increased significantly.</p><p>Giant sails billowed, shimmering with a faint, dark light that cast a greyish haze over everything.  At that moment, the treasure ship vanished from outside view; only cultivators and beasts with sufficient cultivation could sense its aura. The ship cleverly used its formations to mask its presence, avoiding unnecessary trouble.  Meanwhile, the bow subtly veered south, gradually deviating from its original course.</p><p>Qin Sang looked out from the courtyard. Seeing a group gathered at the bow, he left and went to join them.  One man stood out: he smoked a pipe, had a large, centipede-shaped scar across his forehead, was powerfully built and bare-chested, and possessed a distinctly roguish air. This was the ship's owner, a man surnamed Wu. He appeared fierce but had a surprisingly good reputation.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, the captain looked over, grinned, and thumped his chest.  "My apologies for disturbing Daoist Friend Qin.  The waters ahead are unsettled; this route avoids trouble.  Rest easy and cultivate; on Wu's ship, you need worry about nothing!"</p><p>The others, seemingly familiar with the captain, echoed his assurances with praise.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, walked to the railing, looked east, and asked, "I have a question. Why are you all avoiding the Yuan Sea? What is its origin?"</p><p>"Oh?  You haven't been to sea before, Daoist Friend?" The captain scrutinized Qin Sang, a mysterious smile playing on his lips.  "If you have time, wait a bit, and you'll see."</p><p>Curious, Qin Sang remained on deck.</p><p>After sailing for some time, the captain's expression changed. "They're here!" he exclaimed, then turned to Qin Sang. "Those beasts arrived early this time!"</p><p>He fixed his gaze on a patch of sea, took out a fist-sized jade bead, and gently rubbed it.  A series of shattering sounds came from below. Several dark beams shot from the ship's hull, each carrying a massive iron anchor.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The captain made no attempt to hide it now. The anchors crashed into the sea, creating huge waves.  These were no ordinary anchors; they were weapons used to repel enemies, infused with the ship's formation power, and possessed considerable force.</p><p>Amid the churning waves, a splash of blood appeared.  An anchor hauled a monstrous fish aboard, bound and helpless.  With a mighty heave, it was thrown onto the deck.</p><p>"Thwack!"</p><p>A fist met the fish's head, knocking it unconscious. The captain, after rubbing his knuckles, jumped onto the fish, slit its belly, and, ignoring the blood, searched inside, retrieving a bloody pouch. He grinned, producing several jade vials.</p><p>"This must be taken while alive; it's useless once dead," he said, squeezing transparent droplets from the pouch into the vials with careful precision. Then, remembering Qin Sang, he asked, "Daoist Friend, do you see what it is?"</p><p>"Poison?" Qin Sang, having practiced poison arts, possessed acutely sensitive perception.  The liquid in the pouch was incredibly toxic.</p><p>"Precisely!" The captain nodded, launching into a legend.</p><p>"The Yuan Sea is also called the Poison Sea. Legend says an incredibly powerful faction once resided there, cultivating bizarre poison arts, possessing terrifying strength that struck fear into all. Another legend claims the Yuan Sea was a daoist training ground created by a powerful cultivator of the Great Ascension stage, known as the Poison God!  Legend holds that, during the Yuan Sea's heyday, Lansha Prefecture was merely a vassal on its outer edge, gradually rising to prominence due to its position between the Yuan Sea and Kanzhou.  Then, the Yuan Sea fell into decline, and now it's completely silent, its legacy seemingly lost.  But even in its dormancy, it remains extremely dangerous, like a monstrous beast lurking beneath the waves, its mouth agape. Countless poisonous creatures roam its outer edges.  Whether the legends are true is unknown, but the danger is real. No one has ever emerged from it alive, nor has anyone returned from within…"</p><p>Hearing this tale, a chill ran down Qin Sang's spine.  "The Poison God?"</p><p>(End)</p>
