<h1>Chapter 1619: The Change of the Cloud Dragons</h1><p>“Demonic Soul Nails… Could it be Grand Elder Fan of the Heavenly Hao Tower?”</p><p>Qin Sang took advantage of Old Devil Fan, successfully crossing the Cloud Qi Plaza. At the last moment, he caught a glimpse of Old Devil Fan's figure, but couldn't get a clear look.</p><p>However, the Demonic Soul Nails were a renowned demonic artifact in the Middle Continent, easily recognizable.</p><p>Old Devil Kurong of the Heavenly Hao Tower should be attending the Dharma Assembly in the Gold Jade Province at this time. Even if he received the news, it would be too late to rush over.</p><p>Old Devil Kurong had mentioned that Sect Master Yu was at a crucial juncture in cultivating a divine ability and was in secluded cultivation. Grand Elder Fan had other important matters to attend to.  It turned out he had come to the Southern Continent.</p><p>It was unclear whether it was a coincidence or something else.</p><p>Qin Sang now suspected that, besides the Eight Sceneries Sect, the Heavenly Hao Tower might also be involved. There might even be a spy from the Heavenly Hao Tower among the remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>He had unintentionally offended Grand Elder Fan, but Qin Sang had no regrets.  If he had to do it again, he would make the same choice.</p><p>Cooperating with a demonic cultivator was akin to sleeping with a tiger.</p><p>If Qin Sang were competing with the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Formless Immortal Sect for something, perhaps he would consider it.</p><p>His goals were clear: cultivation techniques were his priority, followed by the Nascent Soul Patriarch's legacy.  For now, it seemed there wouldn't be a conflict of interest with the two factions.</p><p>When the true treasures of the Formless Immortal Sect emerged and competition became necessary, it wouldn't be too late to choose his course of action based on the situation.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Qin Sang heard someone shout from behind.</p><p>The cultivators from the two sects attacking the stone pillar restriction immediately ceased their assault and surrounded the restriction, on high alert, preventing anyone from snatching the Azure Cloud Grass.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang showed no sign of slowing down. He didn't even glance at the Azure Cloud Grass, passing directly through the open space of the plaza without a second thought, vanishing into the sea of clouds in an instant.</p><p>“Such swift escape technique! Late Nascent Soul! Who is that?”</p><p>An elder of the Grand Peak Sect revealed a look of astonishment.</p><p>He searched his memory, but couldn't recall such a powerful figure existing near the Southern Continent.</p><p>The celestial phenomenon had appeared, shocking the world.</p><p>When the time came, the Southern Continent would undoubtedly be filled with experts.</p><p>But this person arrived too quickly, surpassing them and entering the Formless Immortal Sect first.</p><p>True Person Zi Lei and Yue Lingtian had gone ahead.  The others were led by Hua Chenzi and a junior brother of True Person Zi Lei.</p><p>True Person Zi Lei's junior brother took people to investigate, while Hua Chenzi guarded the Azure Cloud Grass.</p><p>Hua Chenzi's gaze was drawn to the lightning, his face contemplative. Even with his vast knowledge, he couldn't identify this person's origins.  Could there be a hidden expert in the Southern Continent he didn't know about?</p><p>He suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>It was too much of a coincidence that this person happened to be traveling nearby!</p><p>They had assumed they were the orioles behind the Formless Immortal Sect, with ample time to explore slowly.  Thus, they had chosen the safest approach, proceeding cautiously step by step.</p><p>Now a variable had appeared.  He hoped the situation wouldn't spiral out of control.</p><p>A sense of urgency rose in Hua Chenzi's heart.  Seeing that Qin Sang hadn't coveted the Azure Cloud Grass, he was about to signal the others not to pursue when he suddenly received a message from True Person Zi Lei's junior brother, “There's another person here!”</p><p>Old Devil Fan had been exposed.</p><p>Hua Chenzi's brow furrowed slightly. He had assumed the other party was creating a diversion to sneak into the Formless Immortal Sect, but he hadn't expected there to be someone else outside.</p><p>“What's the relationship between these two?”</p><p>This thought had just surfaced in Hua Chenzi's mind when a sudden premonition of danger arose. He shouted a warning, and with a flick of his sleeve, a beam of primal yellow light shot out.</p><p>Within the light was a lamp, seemingly carved from rough stone.  There was no oil or wick within the lamp.</p><p>Without any visible action from Hua Chenzi, a flame suddenly ignited within the lamp. The flame was small, but the yellow light it emitted was incredibly bright, illuminating the area around the stone pillar.</p><p>Within the area illuminated by the lamplight, a mysterious power flowed through the void.</p><p>Still not at ease, Hua Chenzi swiftly released two spirit beasts – two rare Earth-Burrowing Giant Earthworms.</p><p>The Earth-Burrowing Giant Earthworms grew rapidly, their bodies long and slender, comparable to flood dragons.  The two spirit beasts, one on the left and one on the right, swayed their heads and tails, emitting strange whirring sounds as they prepared to fly towards the lamp.</p><p>At this moment, the others finally reacted.</p><p>They hadn't sensed anything unusual, but they trusted Hua Chenzi's judgment.  They each summoned their own magical treasures and divine abilities, but they had no idea where their target was or which direction to attack.</p><p>Just then, everyone felt a flicker of light and darkness before their eyes.  Focusing their gaze, they saw countless demonic shadows appearing within the area illuminated by the lamp.</p><p>Thousands of demonic shadows rushed into the lamp's range, suddenly subjected to immense pressure, their forms fluctuating.  However, their demonic flames burned even fiercer, ignoring everyone present as they frantically lunged towards the Azure Cloud Grass.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Demons Yin Scripture! Old Devil Fan!”</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Hua Chenzi's eyes. Another uninvited guest!</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Countless demonic shadows laughed maniacally, Old Devil Fan's arrogant voice echoing from everywhere, “Old Ghost Hua, thank you for helping me find the Azure Cloud Grass.  Why don't you quickly present the spirit herb to me!”</p><p>Qin Sang's attack had indeed caused trouble for Old Devil Fan, but it had also given him an opportunity.  Qin Sang's intrusion into the Formless Immortal Sect, ignoring the Azure Cloud Grass, was precisely when Hua Chenzi and the others were most relaxed.</p><p>It was also due to Old Devil Fan's audacity and skill that he seized this fleeting opportunity.  Anyone else would never have dared to take such a risk.</p><p>…</p><p>“So Old Devil Fan has his eyes on the Azure Cloud Grass…”</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the commotion behind him, his figure pausing slightly, a look of realization on his face.</p><p>Ahead, the sea of clouds continued to stretch endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, having no intention of interfering in the fight. His gaze shifted, sweeping over the two magnificent cloud dragon carvings.</p><p>The cloud dragons seemed like guardians of the Formless Immortal Sect, standing guard here.</p><p>The restriction hadn't been activated, so he didn't know what abilities the cloud dragons possessed.  However, when Qin Sang had approached them earlier, his spirit had inexplicably tightened. He didn't dare to underestimate them.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this glance revealed unusual details to Qin Sang.</p><p>After passing through the Cloud Qi Plaza, the chaotic energy hadn't subsided, but instead intensified. Turbulent currents continuously surged from ahead, constantly impacting the cloud dragons.</p><p>At the limit of his Heavenly Eye divine ability's range, he saw that several scales on the inner sides of the cloud dragons' claws were broken, and cracks had appeared.</p><p>The cloud dragons appeared solid overall, but they were already flawed and wouldn't remain stable for long.</p><p>“What would happen if the cloud dragons collapsed?”</p><p>This thought suddenly popped into Qin Sang's mind. He glanced back at the Cloud Qi Plaza. Once the thought appeared, it became difficult to suppress.</p><p>He had already entered, so it likely wouldn't affect him much!</p><p>Having made his judgment, Qin Sang shifted his escape light, flying horizontally to the dragon claw. He discovered that although the claw wasn't grasping anything tangible, there was clearly an invisible force supporting the cloud dragons.</p><p>After careful observation, Qin Sang, without hesitation, summoned the Sun God Tree.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul returned to his main body.</p><p>Qin Sang first withdrew his avatar, then retreated a distance. With a flicker of his mind, flames danced on the Sun God Tree, and the three Sun God Birds spread their wings and flew simultaneously, shooting towards the cracks on the dragon claw.</p><p>Before the divine birds could hit the claw, Qin Sang fully activated his escape light, fleeing far away.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Just as Qin Sang escaped into the depths of the cloud sea, a deafening explosion erupted from behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly startled, but didn't look back, only using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe. He saw a burst of crimson light, immediately followed by a blinding white light.</p><p>Struck at its most vulnerable point, the cloud dragon's claw finally broke completely.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the massive dragon body swayed, tilting outwards.</p><p>During this process, the ceaseless turbulent currents added to the force.  Accompanied by rumbling sounds, the cloud dragon finally collapsed, like a celestial dragon plunging into the sea.</p><p>Amidst the towering waves, the cloud dragon's body broke into several sections, the white light erupting from the points of fracture.</p><p>The white light was actually a manifestation of the imbalanced energy within the cloud dragon erupting. Once imbalanced, the cloud dragon completely crumbled like dry rot.</p><p>Countless beams of white light converged, erasing all other colors from this space. Even more terrifying was the wave that accompanied the white light.</p><p>If anyone were looking down from above at this moment, they would see a white ripple exploding from where the cloud dragon fell, expanding outwards at an astonishing speed.  The spreading cloud wave was clearly visible within the sea of clouds.</p><p>Terrifying cloud waves surged into the sky.</p><p>On the Cloud Qi Plaza, Old Devil Fan was fighting with Hua Chenzi and the others for the Azure Cloud Grass. Sensing the sudden change, they were all filled with terror. Before they could react, they were engulfed by the cloud wave.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the other cloud dragon was also affected and collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang had already escaped the chaotic area.  Sensing the escalating phenomenon and the astonishing fluctuations behind him, he was also greatly surprised.</p><p>He had anticipated that the cloud dragon's collapse might cause some trouble for Old Devil Fan and the others, but he never expected it to create such a huge commotion.</p><p>At this moment,</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly clearly saw that the two cloud dragons had been replaced by a boundless cloud wall.</p><p>The Cloud Qi Plaza must have been destroyed.</p><p>The cloud wall had no gaps, stretching across the void, filled with chaotic energy and continuing to expand.</p><p>Just then, a group arrived. They were the other descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Without the protection of the altar, the others, whose cultivation was inferior to Zhu Wudao and the others, had fallen behind.</p><p>Due to their individual agendas, they were less united than the Eight Sceneries Sect and the Grand Peak Sect, and were even slower than Hua Chenzi.  Because they had been led in different directions by the turbulent currents and restrictions within the passage, the two groups hadn't encountered each other. Otherwise, a great battle would have been inevitable.</p><p>Everyone stared blankly at the cloud wall ahead, their faces ashen.</p><p>They couldn't fathom what had happened here, but it was clear that the cloud wall hadn't existed when Zhu Wudao and the others entered. They were a step too late and were now blocked.</p><p>If anyone wanted to enter the Formless Immortal Sect now, they would first have to find a way to cross the cloud wall.  Judging by the commotion outside, it certainly wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue, not expecting to have created such a natural barrier, cutting off the path for those who followed. If Old Devil Fan and the others weren't dead, they would definitely be cursing him.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was undoubtedly a good thing.</p><p>He wasn't sure if the Formless Immortal Sect remnants and True Person Zi Lei had noticed the cloud dragons' weakness. Perhaps they had also discovered it, but hadn't acted because their companions were still behind.</p><p>Qin Sang was alone, with no such concerns.</p><p>The fewer helpers the others had, the fewer people to share the spoils, the more advantageous it was for him.</p><p>Qin Sang took a few more glances, but didn't see Old Devil Fan or the others.  He assumed they were still struggling within the cloud wave, so he didn't hesitate any longer and continued on his way.</p><p>Deep within the sea of clouds.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and the others were still at the forefront.</p><p>With the combined efforts of several peak experts, the obstacles in the passage hadn't caused them much trouble, and none of them were injured.</p><p>Zhu Wudao led the way.</p><p>After flying for a while, they finally saw something tangible within the sea of clouds.</p><p>A flight of stone steps came into view.</p><p>The steps were built from white stone slabs.</p><p>Not a single slab on the entire staircase was intact. Even the most preserved ones were covered in cracks, with moss growing in the crevices, emitting an air of decay.</p><p>Seeing the dilapidated stone steps, Zhu Wudao's face lit up with joy, “We've arrived!”</p><p>Everyone increased their speed.  Suddenly, they heard tremors from behind and stopped to look back.</p><p>Although they couldn't see the celestial phenomenon from here, they could sense the unusual fluctuations. Something extraordinary must have happened there.</p><p>“Is it those two cloud dragon sculptures?”</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man pondered for a moment, glancing sideways at Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Although he was a Wood Phase descendant, he actually didn't know much about the Formless Immortal Sect, far less than Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Zhu Wudao nodded slightly. Seeing everyone looking at him inquiringly, he explained, "I also don't know what those cloud dragons are. Otherwise, wouldn't I have directly controlled them and been able to do as I pleased within the Formless Immortal Sect? They're probably similar to guardian puppets, but they must have been damaged in that great chaos. Now, with the Formless Immortal Sect reactivated and impacted by the turbulent currents, they've been completely destroyed. It's not a bad thing. The collapse of the cloud dragons will prevent others from sharing the spoils, allowing us to explore slowly."</p><p>"It'll only stop some insignificant fellows," Su Zinan scoffed, repeatedly urging Zhu Wudao to lead the way quickly.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's figure flickered, stepping onto the stone steps.</p><p>Escape lights flashed behind him as everyone landed, looking around. They found themselves on the slope of a mountain, with the stone steps winding upwards, seemingly leading directly to the summit.</p><p>"This is the Formless Immortal Sect?"</p><p>The Sword-Bearer looked disappointed.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were only desolate forests, everything in ruins.</p><p>The mountaintop was hidden in clouds and mist, indiscernible.</p><p>"Don't be hasty, fellow Daoist. To enter the Formless Immortal Sect, we need to continue forward," Zhu Wudao gently raised his head, his gaze following the stone steps. "Have you all noticed that the space here has become much more stable?"</p><p>Reminded by Zhu Wudao, everyone realized that this place was indeed different from the outside.</p><p>"It can't be this simple, can it?" the White-Robed Man said hesitantly.</p><p>Zhu Wudao nodded, "Fellow Daoist has a keen mind."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Zhu Wudao sped upwards along the stone steps.</p><p>Everyone quickly followed.</p><p>Zhu Wudao sprinted for a while, then suddenly tapped his foot and soared into the air.</p><p>At first, nothing happened.</p><p>But when Zhu Wudao reached a height of ten feet, ripples suddenly appeared within the clouds and mist. Accompanied by a sharp whistling sound, a flying sword materialized out of nowhere, thrusting directly towards Zhu Wudao's forehead.</p><p>At the same time, Su Zinan and the others noticed something unusual about Zhu Wudao.  His protective true essence fluctuated violently, as if under invisible pressure.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was prepared. With a wave of his hand, a golden mirror appeared before him.</p><p>A 'dong' resonated.</p><p>The center of the golden mirror bulged outwards, but it wasn't pierced by the flying sword.</p><p>The ripples in the sea of clouds intensified, indicating more than one flying sword.</p><p>Zhu Wudao landed back on the ground, saying, "As you all saw, it's best not to fly too high after entering the Formless Immortal Sect."</p><p>Everyone nodded, grateful for Zhu Wudao's warning.</p><p>The grand formation of the Formless Immortal Sect was masterless.</p><p>They had ways to temporarily circumvent the flight restriction and could handle the flying swords, but the combination of the two was not so easy to deal with, and might trigger other variables.  It was best to honestly stay on the ground.</p><p>Following behind Zhu Wudao, they ascended the stone steps and reached the mountaintop.</p>
