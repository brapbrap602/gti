<h1>Chapter 616: Healing</h1><p>With the Flying Night Yaksha around, even Golden Core cultivators are nothing to fear.  Qin Sang took a few more healing pills and was finally able to move freely.  Fearing he might startle the mute woman, he instructed the Flying Night Yaksha to wait outside, got out of bed, lifted the curtain, and went out.</p><p>The mute woman, working late to earn extra money to support herself and Qin Sang, was startled awake.  Her eyes were still blurry with sleep. She gasped, her face flushing crimson, and quickly went outside to wash her face before preparing a meal for Qin Sang.</p><p>After she had washed, Qin Sang called her over, sat down opposite her, and asked, “Mute woman, do you know about cultivators?”</p><p>Seeing her bewildered expression, Qin Sang remembered the man with the animal skin, and said,  "The Witch God's envoy… you should know about them, right?"</p><p>The mute woman nodded.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then solemnly stated, "I am the Witch God's envoy."</p><p>The mute woman's jaw dropped. She stared at Qin Sang blankly for a moment, then started to get up to cook again.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, picked up a black stone from the fire pit, and crushed it into powder right in front of her.  "Now do you believe me? Before I was injured, I was very powerful."</p><p>The mute woman was clearly shocked, staring at Qin Sang in stunned silence.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, took a bowl, filled it with water, then took two spirit pills, crushed off tiny pieces, and dissolved them in the water. He handed the bowl to the mute woman.</p><p>"Mute woman, you saved my life. I can't repay you enough, so let me start by curing your illness. This medicine will cure your muteness and the birthmark on your face. After you drink it, you will become a normal person, with a bright future ahead of you."</p><p>It was thanks to her rescuing him from the river that he had a safe place to recover. Otherwise, drifting endlessly, he might have encountered unimaginable dangers.  Qin Sang's sudden revelation of his identity was a shock to the mute woman.  Overwhelmed, she unconsciously took the bowl from Qin Sang and just stood there, frozen.</p><p>"Don't be afraid, I won't harm you…"</p><p>Thinking the mute woman was worried about something, Qin Sang gently reassured her.</p><p>At that moment, the mute woman suddenly put down the bowl, her expression urgent. She looked around anxiously, picked up a stone, and quickly wrote on the ground: "Brother with the missing arm, are you leaving?"</p><p>The characters were deeply etched, and hastily written.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, and nodded.</p><p>Seeing the sudden sorrow in the mute woman's eyes, Qin Sang realized she had misunderstood. He quickly explained, "Don't worry, I'm only leaving temporarily, to heal my injuries. Your grandfather, the witch doctor, mentioned a cave on that mountain—it's very safe. I can't stay here anymore. Your village elder already knows about my presence and will surely send people to question me today."</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to a mountain peak across the river. That mountain was taller and more dangerous, surrounded by sheer cliffs that were impossible for ordinary people to climb, but the Flying Night Yaksha could traverse it with ease.</p><p>The real reason Qin Sang chose that mountain was because its peak had the most concentrated spiritual energy nearby, beneficial for healing.  Furthermore, he didn't want to have too much interaction with the villagers.</p><p>"In a few days, once I'm healed, I'll be back.  Here,"  Qin Sang took out a  'Qingfu' coin and gave it to the mute woman. "Keep this coin. If you're ever in danger, smash it with a stone, and I'll know immediately and come to save you."</p><p>After the Qingyang Demon Sect incident, Yun Youzi returned the 'Qingfu' mother coin to Qin Sang. The remaining Qingfu insect blood could still be used a few more times.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense was currently depleted, making it impossible to examine the mute woman's spiritual root aptitude.  He couldn't teach her cultivation techniques yet. He would return after his recovery.</p><p>He wouldn't stay long, but before leaving, he needed to settle this matter.  If the mute woman had a talent for cultivation, he would bring her into a sect, leaving her with cultivation techniques, artifacts, and pills to help her change her destiny, repaying her kindness.  Even if she lacked talent, he could help her improve her health and teach her martial arts, making her a skilled warrior among ordinary people, no longer subject to bullying.</p><p>He left the Qingfu coin for her because she currently lacked the ability to protect herself, preventing any unforeseen accidents that he might later regret.</p><p>The mute woman clutched the Qingfu coin tightly. The urgency and sadness on her face lessened, and she obediently picked up the bowl and drank the water.</p><p>*Gurgles…*</p><p>After drinking the medicine, after a short while, the mute woman's stomach suddenly rumbled.</p><p>The mute woman froze, suddenly covering her face, and rushing out the door.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a while before seeing the blushing mute woman hesitantly enter, her gaze sweeping over her face. He handed her a bronze mirror, smiling gently, "Look."</p><p>The mute woman saw herself in the mirror and was speechless.</p><p>To be fair, Ya Gu wasn't stunningly beautiful.  She couldn't compare to the breathtaking beauty of Chen Yan and Jing Po Po.  But she was pretty and delicate, with a gentle, almost timid demeanor that gave her the air of a girl next door.</p><p>Even so, this was a level of beauty Ya Gu had only ever dreamed of.</p><p>She had countless dreams where her birthmark disappeared, where she became a normal person, no longer despised, surrounded by laughter and joy. But upon waking, she'd always return to reality, never daring to hope for such a dream to come true.</p><p>Clutching a bronze mirror, she stared at her reflection, afraid to blink, fearing the dream would vanish.</p><p>Slowly, tears rolled down her cheeks.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang, seeing her composure return slightly, asked, "Is there anything you want to say now?"</p><p>"Ah…"</p><p>Ya Gu instinctively went to use sign language, but suddenly felt her throat different from before.  Hesitating, then, encouraged by Qin Sang's gaze, she timidly said, "Brother with the severed arm…"</p><p>This single call surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>He hadn't expected that the breaking of the seal would unleash such a captivating voice.</p><p>Words like "clear as a nightingale's song" or "like a golden oriole" were insufficient.</p><p>If Chen Yan and Jing Po Po were breathtakingly beautiful, Ya Gu's voice was heavenly, utterly natural and perfect.</p><p>Could it be that some petty, jealous deity sealed her voice?</p><p>…</p><p>Dawn broke.</p><p>A black, shadowy figure, incredibly agile, scaled the cliff face.  A person sat on its shoulder, without hindering its movement.</p><p>Soon reaching the summit, the shadowy figure punched a hole in the cliff face, guarding the entrance.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the cave and spent the entire day there.</p><p>By nightfall, all his injuries, except for his missing arm and lingering spiritual damage, had completely healed.</p><p>Instead of continuing his seclusion, he departed on his flying night-demon, searching for spiritual veins to cultivate, refining the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit to achieve his Golden Core breakthrough.</p><p>He also retrieved the Blood-winged Hornets on his way.</p><p>The Blood-winged Hornets had been released for so long, growing in numbers. In just a few days, they could devour all life on a mountain. Fortunately, the Western Frontier was sparsely populated, with many desolate mountains and valleys.</p><p>Whether killing them or retrieving them, Qin Sang couldn't leave the Blood-winged Hornets at large.</p><p>Until he understood the nature of the Western Frontier, all his actions had to be cautious, avoiding any trace that could expose him.</p>
