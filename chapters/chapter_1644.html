<h1>Chapter 1635: The Trap</h1><p>“A trap!”</p><p>The man with the grotesque face looked grim.</p><p>After entering the Bingyi Palace, they had first passed the Qilin screen and then navigated the Ice Palace.  Along the way, they hadn’t found any unusual traces, assuming they were the first to enter.  Unexpectedly, however, someone had already beaten them to it.  Their understanding of the Bingyi Palace was beyond imagination; they could actually manipulate the palace's grand array!</p><p>A terrifyingly cold wind howled, the world turning a ghastly white.</p><p>The ice lake’s water formed into water dragons, coiling upwards towards the sky.</p><p>In the depths of the wind, shadowy flags appeared, immense in size, comparable to palaces, reaching from earth to sky. As the flags billowed, the wind intensified.</p><p>These shadows were reflections of the precious flags at the array's eye, transmitting the chilling energy, drawing in the幽蓝 (dark blue) skylight, and completely unleashing the power of the damaged array.</p><p>But in Qin Sang’s plan, this power alone wasn't enough!</p><p>Deep within the vast dark blue light, tremors began.  Following these, strange phenomena appeared where the skylight pulsed – numerous vortexes opened in the void.</p><p>Within the vortexes, light solidified, and new flag shadows appeared one after another.</p><p>These flag shadows were nodes of the Ice Palace array.</p><p>Though mere reflections of damaged flags, broken and unstable, they were about to unleash their final power before collapsing!</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The scene above the Ice Palace could be described as catastrophic.</p><p>In an instant, the dark blue skylight lost its stability, becoming violently turbulent. Layers of light waves surged over rows of palaces, relentlessly pushing towards the ice lake with terrifying force.</p><p>Clouds of white mist rose from various parts of the Ice Palace; these were actually tiny ice fragments, signs of the palaces crumbling.</p><p>Many palaces' protective barriers had long since vanished, held up only by the dark blue skylight.</p><p>With the skylight’s disturbance, the Bingyi Palace lost its peace, and many palaces were affected, pushed down and crushed by the light waves. The palace was in utter chaos.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Crash!”</p><p>…</p><p>The sounds of collapse were incessant, spreading from all directions towards the ice lake, converging there.</p><p>At this moment, a careful observer would notice that the light waves surging towards the ice lake were only a part of the dark blue skylight, all originating from where the shadowy flags existed.</p><p>After all, it was a damaged array.</p><p>Where there were no shadowy flags, even those with ice disks in hand would be helpless. The dark blue skylight in those areas only undulated due to the impact, beyond their control.</p><p>Otherwise, this battle would have been much easier!</p><p>All the damaged flags moved together, driving the light waves, launching a full-scale assault on the ice lake.</p><p>In an instant,</p><p>Above the ice lake, blue and white mingled, the cold wind and the dark blue skylight converging and merging.</p><p>In the chaotic scene, flag shadows stood densely packed.</p><p>The power of the damaged array reached its peak.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The flag shadows descended together, plunging into the ice lake!</p><p>The man with the grotesque face and the Lord of the Crying Spirit Cave stood on the jade bridge, witnessing the terrifying celestial phenomenon created by the damaged array. Their breaths hitched, an invisible pressure descended, and a profound sense of crisis suddenly filled their hearts.</p><p>At that moment, a shrill buzzing sound came from in front of the grotesque-faced man. The wooden bead suspended on his chest glowed brightly, then shot into the air, emitting a thick green light.</p><p>With the wooden bead as its center, the green light formed a protective barrier above the man’s head.</p><p>The change happened in an instant.</p><p>The scene at the ice lake suddenly changed, reflected in the grotesque-faced man's eyes.</p><p>Seeing the jade bridge connected to the main hall, the grotesque-faced man breathed a sigh of relief. If they hadn't been lured by the Heartless Pavilion, inadvertently taking a different path, and had instead been on that jade bridge, they would have been surrounded by the flag shadows and trapped within the array.</p><p>However, the mastermind behind this was still desperately manipulating the damaged array, the flag shadows carrying the array's power, aiming to engulf the jade bridge where they stood!</p><p>The grotesque-faced man made an immediate decision and quickly retreated.</p><p>At the same time, a flower field bloomed above the Lord of Crying Spirit Cave's head.</p><p>Initially, he reacted according to his past experience, but quickly realized something was amiss, responding swiftly by immediately activating his red flower artifact for protection. He then made the same choice as the grotesque-faced man, retreating.</p><p>At that moment, another change occurred!</p><p>A sword cry sounded from behind.</p><p>Both the Lord of Crying Spirit Cave and the grotesque-faced man felt a sharp pain in the back of their heads, their faces changing color.</p><p>Not only was someone manipulating the damaged array, but someone had also been ambushing them!</p><p>Doubt filled their minds.  Who had set this trap?</p><p>One end of the jade bridge…</p><p>Qin Sang and Jin Chenjian appeared together.</p><p>He stared intently at their backs, his gaze serious, a strand of fluff secretly clutched in his left palm.  This fluff was a gift from Wan Du Mountain, said to contain the power of their most precious treasure.  Wan Du Mountain claimed it could trigger the strange-faced man's hidden illness, delivering a fatal blow.</p><p>The last time Su Zi Nan opened the Wuwang Hall, Qin Sang noticed the strange-faced man's facial scars had faded.  Now, they were even lighter.  Qin Sang doubted the fluff's effectiveness against the man at his peak, and wouldn't rely on such an external object.</p><p>Ultimately, Qin Sang didn't immediately activate the fluff, proceeding as planned.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Jin Chenjian transformed into a sword-rainbow, bursting forth. It didn't target either individual, but the space between them.  Before they could react, the sword light vanished.  The void darkened, giving birth to countless thin sword threads, crisscrossing in the air.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Array was unleashed!</p><p>The array simultaneously attacked both the strange-faced man and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying killing intent from behind, the strange-faced man was startled. He struck his chest hard, a green light shooting out, enveloping an object—the wooden armor that had once withstood the Four-Headed Serpent Seal.</p><p>The armor appeared, radiating a vibrant green life force, then vanished, replaced by the phantom of a towering ancient tree, shielding the strange-faced man.</p><p>The tree was lush and vibrant, full of life, appearing as a real tree rooted on the Jade Bridge.</p><p>Attacked from both front and rear, unsure of the enemy's strength, the strange-faced man abandoned any thought of retreat, leaping from the Jade Bridge.</p><p>'Swish swish swish...'</p><p>The sword threads attacked, the tree's green light dimming slightly.</p><p>A grinding sound, like teeth scraping, filled the air. The tree swayed but remained unscathed, not even a scratch visible. The array seemed outwardly strong but inwardly weak, far less powerful than the strange-faced man expected.</p><p>At this moment, the strange-faced man suddenly realized something and abruptly turned to the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>It was a feint by Qin Sang.  Attacking the strange-faced man was a distraction, designed to force him to focus on self-preservation, while the majority of the array's power fell upon the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master roared in fury, their face flushed crimson, eyes bloodshot.</p><p>Their red flower treasure spun rapidly, its form obscured, leaving only a red vortex in the void.</p><p>Red light scattered across the flower field, countless flower shadows splitting to reveal pained human faces—evil spirits painstakingly cultivated by the Cave Master.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The spirits opened their eyes simultaneously.  Empty, pupil-less, only white orbs stared out.</p><p>The spirits' pained expressions gradually subsided, their gaze fixed on the Seven Souls Killing Array and Qin Sang on the bridge, appearing even more sinister.</p><p>A horrifying, unearthly wail echoed, like ghosts screaming.</p><p>The flower shadows twisted and merged with the spirits' faces, forming grotesque figures bathed in the red light, appearing bloodstained.</p><p>The next moment, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master released the spirits' restraints.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The red flower, carrying some of the spirits, soared to meet the approaching array flags.</p><p>Most of the spirits charged into the array, forming a river of blood in mid-air—a scene reminiscent of countless tormented souls in the underworld.</p><p>On the Jade Bridge, the blood river surged into the array.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>The sword threads flared, shredding the spirits.</p><p>But the spirits seemed endless, ferociously fearless, actively tearing at the sword threads.</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed above as the red flower treasure collided with the flags.  Crimson evil light and vast, ethereal blue light clashed, creating a clear boundary.</p><p>Soon, the different colors began to merge, devouring each other, the boundary blurring.</p><p>Ultimately, victory or defeat held little consequence.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master, defending against two enemies simultaneously, was only seeking an escape, a way out of this dangerous situation!</p><p>The Cave Master flickered, about to flee, when a sucking force erupted from beneath the Jade Bridge!</p><p>The strange-faced man and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master were both completely distracted by the array and Qin Sang.</p><p>No one noticed the small white light hidden within the pale blue sky.</p><p>Inside the white light was a bone, wrapped in a thin glove.</p><p>The bone was smooth, luminescent, like a precious jewel, with delicate blood vessels circling its surface.  Combined with the glove, it was strikingly eerie—the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand.</p><p>The plan was to set an ambush, concealing the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand in the icy lake to create a trap.</p><p>Originally, the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand was meant to ambush a different jade bridge, so summoning it took a little longer.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The glove, refined from a demon core, landed in his hand, followed by a heart-stopping roar.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang used the refined treasure against an enemy, but he'd faced a thousand-foot crocodile before, so he had faith in its power.</p><p>The roar echoed like thunder, shaking the jade bridge violently.</p><p>Huge waves splashed from the lake, shooting out a point of white light. The aura of the bone exploded, and the phantom of a thousand-foot crocodile leaped from within, roaring to the heavens, its ferocity boundless.</p><p>Next to the crocodile, even the flags appeared tiny.</p><p>The crocodile's form solidified, becoming a terrifying beast. It lay on the ice lake, head raised, its gaze locked onto the Weeping Spirit Cave Master on the bridge, radiating pure killing intent.</p><p>Opening its mouth, a black hole appeared in its throat, and a powerful suction force erupted from its body, a visible wave directed at the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The suction force expanded relentlessly, spreading outward from the Weeping Spirit Cave Master. The lake surface suddenly bulged, and the water surged back, drawn into the crocodile’s belly. Even the pale blue skylight and the icy wind were affected.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade bridge, unable to withstand the strain, finally collapsed, its countless fragments swirling into the crocodile's maw.</p><p>But the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was the true target of the suction!</p><p>At that moment, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master was fighting desperately on two fronts – resisting the remnants of one array and countering the Seven Souls Killing Array – leaving them with no strength to oppose the suction.</p><p>The Weeping Spirit Cave Master's robe billowed, creating concentric ripples.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword light appeared, slicing through the robe. The Seven Souls Killing Array, having eliminated the evil spirits, was attacking again.  The Weeping Spirit Cave Master's face was filled with horror; they could only recall the red flower to protect them.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The flag fell unimpeded.</p><p>Before the Weeping Spirit Cave Master could escape the suction, they were pulled into the remnants of the array along with the surrounding water.</p><p>The pale blue light descended, concealing the chaos.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Before disappearing, the Weeping Spirit Cave Master only managed a desperate cry for help.</p><p>The grotesque face hovered above the lake.  Qin Sang and the remnants of the array weren’t targeting it, so it was unharmed. Seeing the Weeping Spirit Cave Master’s plight, it secretly pointed a finger at the wooden puppet, which then shot towards the Weeping Spirit Cave Master like a streak of light.</p><p>The situation was clear: one opponent was manipulating the remnants of the array from the shadows, the other was launching sneak attacks. There were no more allies.  Their disadvantage stemmed from unpreparedness and lack of knowledge about their opponents.</p><p>If they could rescue the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and escape the Ice Palace, overcoming the enemy's geographical advantage, the outcome might still be uncertain!</p><p>At that moment, a figure moved faster than the wooden puppet, charging toward the remnants of the array—Qin Sang himself.</p><p>Pulling the Weeping Spirit Cave Master into the remnants of the array wasn't just about trapping them; Qin Sang aimed to clip the grotesque face's wings and kill him!</p><p>The grotesque face watched Qin Sang coldly, a sinister look on their face. Their left hand clenched secretly, and the jade insect, quietly resting in their palm, was surreptitiously launched.</p><p>The jade insect took flight.</p><p>Now, the jade insect's eyes were devoid of blood, its appearance that of a harmless little beetle. No one would imagine it was actually a terrifyingly deadly insect!</p><p>The wooden puppet’s rescue attempt was simply a feint by the grotesque face.</p><p>From his position on the bridge, Qin Sang had been too far away, and the attack had been sudden and unexpected. The grotesque face had held onto the jade insect, biding their time.</p><p>Now was the moment to strike!</p><p>Predicting Qin Sang’s escape route, the jade insect's mouthparts opened slightly, spitting out a venomous ray.</p><p>The poison ray was exceptionally swift, even faster than the one used against Lu Zhang, arriving in an instant.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't anticipated the grotesque face's tactics, he likely would have been struck.</p><p>Without the Fat Silkworm nearby, even though Qin Sang had separated poison beads from the Fat Silkworm, he wouldn't dare to take the jade insect's poison ray directly. Prepared beforehand, his escape route abruptly halted and changed direction, easily dodging the poison ray, still aiming for the Weeping Spirit Cave Master.</p><p>Even the grotesque face, with their sinister mind, couldn't help but pause.</p><p>They had complete confidence in the king-level insect's abilities.</p><p>Once the poison ray was unleashed, it was a matter of life or death.</p><p>They never imagined their opponent had anticipated their move, easily resolving the crisis.</p><p>The confident expression on the grotesque face vanished.  They hurriedly recalled the jade insect, then felt themselves locked onto by an aura.  Their heart skipped a beat. They turned sharply, seeing a figure on the opposite shore of the icy lake, their pupils widening in shock.</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>The grotesque face finally understood.</p><p>No wonder they had sensed such pure wood spirit energy here!</p><p>No wonder the opponent had anticipated the king-level insect's poison ray!</p><p>They hadn't expected that the one they had been so eager to find was actually in the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect, lying in wait to ambush them!</p><p>The person was Qin Sang’s avatar.</p><p>With the power of the remnants of the array unleashed, the avatar didn’t need to, nor could they, do anything else.</p><p>The Ice Palace array was at the end of its strength, forced to its limit, releasing its final brilliance. After this battle, the spirit array would be destroyed.</p><p>The avatar left the secret chamber and appeared on the ice lake, coldly watching the grotesque face, their voice chilling.</p><p>"My friend, it seems we meet again."</p>
