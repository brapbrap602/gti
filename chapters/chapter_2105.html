<h1>Chapter 2096: Intervention</h1><p>Qingyang Temple Restricted Area.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from meditation, waving his sleeve to send out a yellow talisman. The talisman ignited spontaneously without flame, and Si Lu's voice emerged from the flames, recounting the events in the Demon Sea.</p><p>The talismanic flames gradually dimmed, leaving Qin Sang both surprised and astonished.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated the Changyou clan chief's breakthrough at this time.  All signs indicated that the Changyou clan chief wasn't exceptionally talented; his breakthrough to the late stage was due to the Qingling energy.</p><p>With such talent, a breakthrough to the second stage of the Void Realm would be extremely difficult without deep accumulation or a miraculous opportunity.</p><p>In the last battle for the Qingling energy, the Changyou clan chief didn't seem poised for a breakthrough. Yet, less than a century later, he has overcome this hurdle.</p><p>However, unforeseen events happen, so perhaps the Changyou clan chief truly obtained some opportunity or experienced a sudden flash of insight.</p><p>The Changyou clan chief's unexpected breakthrough made Qin Sang's situation quite棘手.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang hadn't considered the Changyou clan a threat.  He had refrained from attacking them due to his fear of the Zhuyan clan and his intention to use the Changyou clan as a whetstone to test his strength in the Storm Realm.</p><p>His original plan involved gaining power to deter the Zhuyan clan—namely, the Thunder Altar—before dealing with the Changyou clan.  That's why he'd remained hidden since his return, focusing on the altar's construction.</p><p>However, with the Changyou clan chief's breakthrough and his rampant slaughter of the demon tribes, Qin Sang could no longer remain passive.</p><p>Even if the deaths of the Jiao Dragon King and other demons were regrettable, once the Changyou clan finished eliminating the demon tribes, they would undoubtedly invade Central State. He couldn't allow this to happen.</p><p>But if he intervenes, a battle between two Void Refinement experts could attract the Zhuyan clan's attention. With the Thunder Altar still incomplete, the situation would spiral out of his control.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew grave as various possibilities flashed through his mind. He considered what he would do if the worst-case scenario unfolded.</p><p>The good news was that Su Nu had returned and discovered a refuge. However, it was far from ideal, a piece of land within the Mist Tide.</p><p>The Yi people are experienced with mist, and the Jiaojiao tribe, originating from Ji Hong, are particularly adept at dealing with it. Ji Hong cultivated various spirit plants there, utilizing their properties to create a habitable area for cultivators.  The space, however, is limited and can only accommodate a small number of cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang could only take his trusted subordinates, using it as a last resort.</p><p>What if he simply eliminated the Changyou clan chief?</p><p>The Changyou clan chief had only just broken through, his cultivation likely still unstable. Qin Sang might be enough to defeat him alone.</p><p>Even if the Changyou clan chief, despite his Void Refinement cultivation, slaughtered junior members in the Storm Realm, Qin Sang could claim self-defense if he retaliated and killed him.</p><p>This approach might work within the Yi people, but the Zhuyan clan wouldn't necessarily be reasonable with an outsider like him.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang glanced at the lingering talisman flames, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>"Si Lu, Si You Clan, Zhuyan Clan…"</p><p>His gaze sharpened as the relationships between these factions crossed his mind, leading him to an idea.  He then flicked his finger, sending a mental message towards the flames.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang summoned another talisman to send a message to Su Nu in the North Sea, so that she could also act when they confronted the Changyou clan chief.</p><p>After these actions, Qin Sang immediately rose, flew into the sky, and sped away.</p><p>…</p><p>North Sea.</p><p>Su Nu was assisting Xuan Tian Palace in building an altar when she received the talisman message.  She pondered for a moment, then issued several orders through Xuan Tian Palace before flying toward Beichen Territory.</p><p>She knew that the Changyou clan's main force would be launching a surprise attack on Beichen Territory. The Senior General Minshan and several clan elders were there. Capturing them would be equivalent to seizing the Changyou clan's lifeline.</p><p>…</p><p>Canglang Sea.</p><p>Si Lu sensed Qin Sang's intention and nodded slightly, putting away the talisman.</p><p>"Senior, what did the Master say?" Gui Hou asked.</p><p>"To remain calm and act according to circumstances."</p><p>Si Lu knew that Qin Sang wouldn't want the entire demon army to be wiped out.  He thought for a moment, and a red light shot out from his brow, transforming into a small, exquisite red-feathered demon bird, one of his four companion beasts.</p><p>He moved his lips, silently reciting an incantation.  The red light on the red-feathered demon bird gradually faded, until its entire body became transparent, merging with the void. It became invisible to the naked eye, its aura extremely subtle.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Si Lu opened a small gap in the circular mirror. The red-feathered demon bird spread its wings and flew toward the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>Si Lu remained on the island, his eyes closed, sensing the outside situation through his companion beast.</p><p>The Changyou clan chief was hunting demon cultivators from south to north, passing through the west of the spirit island. The red-feathered demon bird flew at a moderate speed, staying far from the battlefield, sensing the fluctuations from a distance.</p><p>Si Lu sensed that the auras of one demon cultivator after another were rapidly dissipating. The demon tribes' forces, once dispersed, were no match for the Changyou clan chief.</p><p>The scene was undoubtedly horrific; he could almost smell the blood carried on the sea breeze.</p><p>Soon, the entire army of the demonic cultivators was annihilated, leaving no survivors.  The Changyou clan chief continued his advance. He seemed to be hunting down the remaining demonic cultivators, determined to exterminate them completely.  Because of this, his pace was slow, allowing the Crimson-feathered demonic birds to easily keep up.</p><p>As more and more demonic cultivators fell to Minzhuo's hand, the Jiao Long King and the Huang King sensed something was terribly wrong.</p><p>They had lost contact with the Jin Chan King completely. As time passed, an unsettling atmosphere enveloped the Canglang Sea.  The Jiao Long King and Huang King grew cautious, consolidating their forces and drawing closer to each other.</p><p>With still no news of the Jin Chan King, even the dullest could guess that something terrible had happened to him.</p><p>Initially, they suspected that powerful Changyou clan masters might be lurking in the Canglang Sea, biding their time, and that the previous retreat was a ruse. If several Changyou clan elders, or even the clan chief himself, had attacked, they could have easily trapped and killed the Jin Chan King.</p><p>However, they gradually dismissed this theory. There were no reports of surviving members of the Jin Chan King's forces.  Even with reinforcements from the Changyou clan in the North Sea, it was impossible to completely wipe out the Jin Chan King's army without leaving any survivors.</p><p>Unless, the enemy's strength was beyond imagination!</p><p>The unknown was the greatest fear. The Jiao Long King and Huang King became increasingly uneasy. They ordered their demonic cultivators to conceal their auras.  The Canglang Sea at night transformed into a dangerous abyss, but the source of danger remained unknown.</p><p>Had a powerful beast emerged and attacked the Jin Chan King? Or had they encountered the Mist Waterfall, where all the demonic cultivators were swept away?</p><p>At that very moment, Minzhuo had discovered the Huang King's forces.</p><p>He deliberately avoided provoking the Jiao Long clan, and after taking some time to eliminate the remnants of the Jin Chan King's forces, he continued searching for the Huang King's forces.</p><p>As expected, Zai Zhen was trailing behind, seemingly unaware of Minzhuo's intentions and did not order him to attack the Jiao Long clan.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>The waves lapped gently; the distance appeared calm. The Huang King and his forces were employing the same tactic again—concealing themselves exceptionally well. Any lingering auras would quickly dissipate in the sea breeze.</p><p>But to Minzhuo, these auras were as bright as stars in the night sky, impossible to hide.</p><p>His gaze swept across the sea, instantly locking onto a direction, and he sped towards it.</p><p>Soon, the demonic army came into view.</p><p>Anticipating danger, all the demonic cultivators had been recalled by the Huang King, silently marching on the sea.</p><p>Unaware of the approaching enemy, their formation was perfectly aligned.  In the sky, numerous colorful birds, similar to phoenixes, soared—elite members of the Phoenix clan, providing aerial surveillance.  In critical moments, the Huang King trusted her own people most.</p><p>At the forefront of the army, a light green treasure ship floated gracefully, its silken curtains exquisite, its body light as a feather.</p><p>The Huang King stood at the bow, her brows furrowed, her expression grave.</p><p>Just then, a streak of light descended onto the ship. A pretty woman in palace attire rushed to the bow, bowing and saying, "Auntie, we still haven't found any trace of the Jin Chan King's forces. What should we do now?"</p><p>Her tone was urgent; she too felt the approaching danger.</p><p>The Huang King remained silent.  The longer they waited, the more precarious the situation became. The Jin Chan King was likely dead.</p><p>The only good news was that neither she nor the Jiao Long King's forces had been attacked yet. If they could safely join forces, they would still retain roughly 70% of their strength.</p><p>But what next?</p><p>The situation had been overwhelmingly favorable, with them having reclaimed the entire Demon Sea and most of the Canglang Sea.  Without warning, the tides had turned. They hadn’t even seen their enemy's face, yet they were already terrified.</p><p>They would inevitably have to abandon the Canglang Sea, but could they, with their remaining forces, defend the Demon Sea against this unknown enemy?</p><p>Should they flee back to the Central Plains?</p><p>The Huang King had already prepared for the worst. As she pondered, she sensed something unusual beneath the ship.</p><p>In the middle of the demonic army, several demonic cultivators suddenly noticed the sea surface rising beneath them.  Looking around, they realized they were being lifted by the water, instantly rising several meters above their surroundings.</p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p>Someone screamed.</p><p>The Huang King's treasure ship was also lifted by the rising water. Her expression changed instantly, her mouth slightly agape, as her voice boomed across the army.</p><p>"Form the array!"</p><p>Along with the Huang King's order, a thunderous roar erupted from the seabed, shaking the heavens and earth!</p><p>All the demonic cultivators looked towards the center in terror, where the sea was rising dramatically, creating a monstrous wave. The terrifying force flung the demonic cultivators on the surface into the air, even tossing the Huang King's treasure ship high into the sky. The Phoenix clan members in the air were thrown into chaos.</p><p>Vast waves were whipped high into the air, then crashed down, splitting the demonic army in two.</p><p>“Dragon! Dragon!”</p><p>Some demon cultivators pointed tremblingly at the waves, their faces filled with terror.  Amidst the flying spray, they saw a terrifying outline: shimmering scales, sharp claws, a majestic head and horns—a true dragon!</p><p>Not a pseudo-dragon of the Jiao-long clan, but a genuine dragon, exactly as legends described!  The wave was only the dragon's back; its hindquarters remained submerged, its length unknown. The army had passed directly over it, and the dragon's emergence had overturned them.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The dragon roared, and the water behind the army suddenly split open. A transparent shadow burst forth—its tail.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Seawater was drawn into the sky, turning into a torrential downpour. The dragon's tail lashed through the air, striking down at the demons. Each cultivator could only see a portion of it; even the largest felt insignificant in that moment.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, the Phoenix King's urgent shout rang out again.</p><p>“Form the array!”</p><p>In the distance, Min Zhuo smirked. This water dragon was his creation. With the army thrown into disarray, how could they possibly be his match?</p><p>With a thought, the dragon's eyes flashed with ferocity, and it raised its claw to strike at the Phoenix King's ship.  High-ranking warriors from various clans were gathered around the ship; if Min Zhuo succeeded, the demonic army would be leaderless.</p><p>Si Lu witnessed this through his companion beast. Unable to remain a bystander, the Jiao-long King brought out nearly thirty percent of the High-ranking members of the Yao Hai demon clan.  Thirty percent had already been slain by the Chang You clan leader, including all the Golden Toad clan's elites. Among all the clans, the Golden Toad, Phoenix, and Jiao-long clans were the most talented and valued by Qin Sang.</p><p>If the Phoenix King’s forces were annihilated, Qin Sang would have few soldiers left.</p><p>As the dragon surfaced, a Crimson Feather bird had already flown to the battlefield’s edge. A point of crimson light appeared in the void, transforming into a small bird.  The bird raised a wing; its tip aimed at the dragon's forehead. A crimson feather shot out like an arrow.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In the chaotic battle, almost no one noticed the insignificant feather. But Min Zhuo immediately sensed it, his gaze sharpening.  He thought, *Finally*.</p><p>The dragon looked up, and as the feather neared, it opened its mouth and released a blast of "dragon breath"—a massive torrent of water.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The feather and the dragon's breath collided with tremendous force, water and fire clashing, each dominating half the sky.  The dragon recoiled tens of thousands of meters, its attack disrupted; the demons narrowly escaped.</p><p>“Who dares obstruct me!”</p><p>Min Zhuo feigned surprise, stepping into the air, his eyes burning as he stared at the Crimson Feather bird and demanded, “Who are you, and why interfere?”</p><p>The Crimson Feather bird looked back, its eyes deep.  Its voice was flat, “A cultivator of your level (Sky Realm Double) slaughtering juniors is unbecoming.”</p><p>Min Zhuo snorted, “They are my sworn enemies, with whom my clan has a blood feud. Killing them is only right!”</p><p>“You can kill, and others can kill you,” the bird’s tone remained unchanged.  “But whether you kill them or not is none of my concern. I happened upon this, and am only acting on someone’s request.  Let’s wait for the principals to arrive and settle this.”</p><p>Min Zhuo sneered, secretly activating a secret technique to contact Zai Zhen.</p><p>“Zai Zhen, what should we do?”</p><p>Zai Zhen transmitted, “That bird is a companion beast; that person must be the Si You clan expert. I didn’t expect him to show up so quickly. Min Zhuo, you should play along and delay him until the other demon expert arrives.”</p><p>“Why don’t you show yourself? Why not combine forces to take him down before the other demon expert arrives?” Min Zhuo asked, puzzled.</p><p>“Heh, the Si You clan has four companion beasts. Killing this one is just eliminating one;  I don’t know where the main person is hiding,” Zai Zhen explained. “Min Zhuo, be patient. When the main person arrives, I'll tell you what to do.”</p>
