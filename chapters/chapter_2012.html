<h1>Chapter 2003: En Route</h1><p>A wind swept across the sea.</p><p>Amongst the azure waves, a white tiger, its body abnormally slender yet incredibly agile, ran across the water's surface.  It left no trace, appearing to gallop on four legs, but in reality, it was employing a masterful evasion technique.  Even if someone were to be near its path, they would only feel a slight breeze; the tiger's form would remain unseen. Even cultivators with insufficient skill would be unable to perceive its shape.</p><p>The white tiger sped directly north, not veering around obstacles; it leaped across entire islands, practically flying over the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang looked out the window, only seeing the monotonous seascape. After Li'er departed, the ship fell utterly silent.  The passengers remained in their private chambers, each having erected restrictive barriers to seal themselves off.</p><p>Their current location was roughly southwest of Genzhou, yet Li'er was heading directly north. It seemed the sea grew turbulent beyond Ji Tian Peak.  Further frequent detours to avoid dangers were likely; this explained the ten-year journey.</p><p>For a Transcending Void cultivator, a decade often passed in the blink of an eye while comprehending a new ability. As long as safety was ensured, Qin Sang didn't mind a slower pace.</p><p>However, he didn't intend to simply sleep through it. He instructed Zhuque to monitor the surroundings and awaken him should anything interesting occur.  After all, one of the purposes of this journey was to broaden his horizons.</p><p>This was also to record the route; it might prove useful for returning to Yue Du Bay later.</p><p>Zhuque, well aware of the numerous powerful cultivators on board – any one of whom could crush it with a finger – behaved exceptionally docilely.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly activated his Dharma image, controlling a strand of Azure Luan True Thunder. The thunderous energy, like water, flowed into his palm.</p><p>With his current capabilities, he could control the Azure Luan True Thunder without revealing the slightest trace.</p><p>He opened his palm, the Azure Luan True Thunder coalescing into a small pool within. Qin Sang stared at the thunder, silently practicing the Palm-Heart Thunder Observation Technique. His eyes shone with a strange light; it was as if the thread of thunder had evolved into a world, deeply captivating him. He remained in that posture, the sun rising and setting, for a long time without moving.</p><p>His mind was completely immersed, oblivious to time and his surroundings.</p><p>The Azure Luan Dharma image combined with the Palm-Heart Thunder Observation Technique allowed Qin Sang to experience the True Thunder's power at a minute level, feeling every change, growing familiar with it, gaining control, and learning to utilize it.</p><p>The deeper his understanding, the more Qin Sang marveled at the profound mysteries of the Azure Luan True Thunder. The Azure Luan that left this thunder was at least in the Unity Transformation stage, perhaps higher, but beyond Qin Sang's ability to accurately judge. Those ancient powerhouses sealed within the Storm Realm were undoubtedly no weaker than the Azure Luan; the Storm Realm must hold some great secret.</p><p>The tiny thread of True Thunder, when Qin Sang's consciousness delved into it, felt like entering a green ocean.  The seawater was composed of thunder, but not the ordinary heavenly thunder, rather the unique demonic thunder of the Azure Luan divine beast; it defied ordinary understanding.</p><p>It was like an immeasurable ocean, waiting for Qin Sang to explore. Even with the Azure Luan Dharma image and the Palm-Heart Thunder Observation Technique, he couldn't touch the bottom; he was merely swimming in the upper layers, while the depths remained thick and mysterious.</p><p>He could now use the Azure Luan True Thunder to condense the Five Thunder Celestial Heart Seal, greatly enhancing his thunder techniques. But this was only a superficial application; he remained ignorant of the true principles, just as he had been when manipulating the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire with the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The difference was that the Azure Luan Dharma image and the Palm-Heart Thunder Observation Technique could guide him, inching him closer to the seabed.  The path ahead was clear, and he might master this power without reaching the highest levels of cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang's current task was to become as familiar as possible with the Azure Luan True Thunder to make his thunder techniques smoother and faster.</p><p>Slight ripples appeared on the surface of the blue thunder, condensing into runes.  The runes formed and then dissipated instantly, their changes unpredictable.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Zhuque woke Qin Sang; his consciousness returned. He heard the sound of a mechanism clicking.</p><p>He released a thread of spiritual sense, probing outside the chamber, immediately sensing the spiritual sense of others; Li'er had apparently startled them.</p><p>Li'er was changing form. The white tiger's body curled up, its mechanisms locking into place, keeping the chamber still while the rest of its form changed drastically; from a white tiger to a sphere.</p><p>The sphere was angular, made of countless thin plates pieced together, finally covered in a layer of fluff. This form was utterly unrelated to flesh and blood. It then took to the air, flying upward.</p><p>It was deep night, the moon high in the sky.</p><p>Li'er flew towards the moon, following the moonlight, stopping only at a great height, before continuing north.</p><p>Like an inflated wineskin, tethered to a moonbeam, it hung from the crescent moon, drifting with the wind, its speed greatly reduced.</p><p>There must be a reason for this, Qin Sang looked down at the sea, and soon enough, he made a discovery. The color of the sea was darkening, becoming deeper and deeper towards the north, until it was as black as ink.</p><p>What lay beneath the sea that turned this place into an inky ocean?</p><p>Qin Sang grew alert.  Until dawn, nothing unusual happened. However, as soon as the moon disappeared, the vessel stopped.  Ahead lay a deserted island. The vessel landed on the island and remained there until nightfall, when the moon rose again before departing.</p><p>Day and night, resting by day and traveling by night, for two months they did not fly out of the inky sea.</p><p>That evening,</p><p>as the vessel was about to take off, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p>"Let me off."</p><p>Others on board also heard it. Qin Sang frowned slightly. He recognized the voice as that of the hooded man, Wen Sheng.</p><p>This man had always been mysterious. What did he want to do by leaving the ship now?</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>The vessel itself also hadn't expected anyone to disembark, and was surprised. "Respected guest, you cannot disembark here. It will attract danger from the seabed, and the vessel cannot wait for a single guest."</p><p>"I don't want to go to Genzhou anymore. Can't I get off mid-journey?" Wen Sheng demanded in a hoarse voice.</p><p>"Of course you can disembark, but the fare is non-refundable, and it's really very dangerous here. Are you sure you want to get off here, respected guest?"  the vessel kindly warned.</p><p>"Open the door."</p><p>Wen Sheng said firmly.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and looked out the window, seeing Wen Sheng turn without looking back, his figure flickering as he vanished into the depths of the inky sea.</p><p>With one less passenger, the vessel was about to readjust its form when Qin Sang suddenly stopped it. "Wait! See if this person left anything behind."</p><p>"Good thinking, friend," a steady voice echoed.</p><p>The others immediately understood. Wen Sheng's departure was suspicious; they feared he might have left something behind to shift the blame.</p><p>Immediately, waves of spiritual sense swept over Wen Sheng's room, not leaving out even the places he had walked.</p><p>"That guest didn't go anywhere else," the vessel said timidly.</p><p>Despite finding nothing, no one felt it was unnecessary. The vessel resumed its journey in silence.</p><p>Finally, they flew out of the inky sea. The color of the seawater returned to normal.  The vessel descended from the sky, transforming back into a ship.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others stayed in the ship's cabin. The deck was flat, with only a long mast standing upright.</p><p>The mast had no flag, standing alone, with a glittering bell hanging from its top.</p><p>Uncharacteristically, the vessel didn't hide itself but instead revealed its presence.</p><p>'Ding-a-ling…'</p><p>The ship sailed the sea, its light illuminating dozens of miles around, as conspicuous as the moon, the melodious bell sounds spreading further in the wind.</p><p>Accompanied by the bell's sound, they traveled day and night without encountering any danger, not even a single beast approaching them, as if sailing a dead sea.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the bell was a kind of credential.  Canjin City must have reached some kind of agreement with some being in this sea area to ensure safe passage.</p><p>As expected, until the vessel put away the bell and changed its form again, nothing happened.</p><p>In this manner, along the way, the vessel changed into various forms, using various peculiar methods, and successfully passed through various seas.</p><p>"Only a large force like Canjin City could be so thorough. Even if others memorized this route, they couldn't pass safely…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, once again realizing the weight of Canjin City.</p><p>Five years after departing from Jitian Peak, they arrived at an ordinary sea area, but the vessel stopped at a small island.</p><p>Everyone thought it was just a short stop, like the inky sea, but the vessel remained there for months, showing no signs of departure.</p><p>"What is the vessel waiting for?"</p><p>Someone finally asked.</p><p>"The vessel is waiting for a high tide.  The elder instructed that we must wait for the tide to come; otherwise, we cannot leave under any circumstances," the vessel replied.</p><p>"Is there any danger ahead?" someone pressed.</p><p>"The vessel doesn't know what dangers lie ahead. Please wait patiently, respected guests," the vessel reassured them.</p><p>Fortunately, everyone was reasonable.  Understanding the situation, they no longer urged, patiently awaiting the high tide.</p><p>Several months passed. They had been waiting on the island for nearly a year. They did not wait for the high tide, but for an uninvited guest.</p><p>That noon, Qin Sang was comprehending the Azure Luan True Thunder when he suddenly felt a pang of unease and abruptly woke up.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt a powerful aura approaching at an alarming speed.</p><p>A powerful, unrestrained aura filled the air, heading straight for the island.</p><p>“A late Nascent Soul cultivator!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, leaping to his feet and rushing to the window. The sea was in turmoil.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A hurricane surged from the ocean, waves towering to the sky.  A boundless storm enveloped the island, plunging it into darkness.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Violent winds tore across the island, uprooting trees and whipping sand into a frenzy. A terrifying aura descended.</p><p>Gray winds whipped through the air – not ordinary winds, but a terrifying magical wind, manipulating the elemental energy of heaven and earth.  It could annihilate anything; a weaker cultivator caught in it would be instantly reduced to dust.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The island trembled violently, unable to withstand the assault.  The surrounding sea surged, monstrous waves rising like mountains, threatening to shatter the island. The water and the magical wind coalesced into eight colossal water spouts, reaching to the heavens, a prison trapping the island.</p><p>Li’er was trapped within.</p><p>Everyone on the ship felt the immense pressure, a stir of unrest, but they remained still, secretly on guard.</p><p>Despite the overwhelming power, Li’er remained calm.  She raised her tiger-head emblem and produced a jade token.  “Li’er, the twenty-ninth administrator of the Canjin City branch, acting on the orders of the Third Elder of Canjin City, passing through this sacred place.  I apologize for any offense, and beg for your understanding.”</p><p>The jade token flew towards the storm, only to be blown back by a gust of wind.</p><p>A figure appeared faintly above one of the water spouts, a cold snort echoing. “I don’t care who you are. The person I’m looking for was taken by you. Hand them over immediately!”</p><p>Revenge had arrived!</p><p>Qin Sang and the others all thought the same thing, instantly recalling Wen Sheng, who had disembarked earlier.</p><p>Even amongst the major cultivation sects of Yue Du Bay and beyond, late Nascent Soul cultivators were extremely rare.  No one knew what Wen Sheng had done to provoke such a powerful figure, explaining his secretive behavior.</p><p>“May I ask who you are looking for, sir?” Li’er asked.</p><p>“Enough nonsense!”</p><p>A wave of immense divine sense assaulted her, attempting to shatter her protective barriers.</p><p>“Sir, please calm down, I mean no offense. If the person is on the ship, I will not stop you, but the others are esteemed guests of Canjin City, and it is my duty…”</p><p>Li’er responded urgently, her body ablaze with pale flames, emitting strange fluctuations – daring to resist.</p><p>The divine sense paused. The mysterious man snorted coldly, “You think I can’t kill you?”</p><p>“Sir, you could crush me with a finger, but this is my duty. If I die, I will die without regret, and I believe the Third Elder will avenge me,” Li’er replied unflinchingly.</p><p>At that moment, a sigh came from a quiet room.  “Alas!  After all these years, Daoist Meng’s temper remains as fiery as ever.”</p><p>This voice belonged to the one who had initially agreed with Qin Sang.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The mysterious man looked over, recognizing the voice.  “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“My junior brother has secured the position of Sect Master.  A defeated subordinate like myself would only be an impediment.  I've long wished to travel to Da Zhou, and unexpectedly encountered Daoist Meng here,” the person in the quiet room said softly,  “Is this the person Daoist Meng seeks?”</p><p>A cloaked figure appeared in the void, mimicking Wen Sheng’s aura.</p><p>“That’s him! Where is he now?” the mysterious man asked, seething with murderous intent.</p><p>The person in the quiet room sighed, “Daoist Meng, you are too late. This man is cunning and disembarked earlier. Everyone here can attest to this. Please don’t trouble Miss Li’er.”</p><p>“Indeed, I can also confirm this. I've long heard of Daoist Meng’s reputation, and I am honored to finally meet you.”</p><p>“That is true…”</p><p>“Had we known, we would have certainly stopped him for you, Daoist Meng.”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone spoke up, meticulously detailing Wen Sheng’s departure point, eager to appease the powerful cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn’t know who Daoist Meng was.  The top powers he was aware of didn’t include this individual; he must be a reclusive expert.</p><p>As Daoist Meng’s figure faded, the prison-like storm dissipated, and calm returned to the sea.</p><p>“This person’s power far surpasses the Black Roc!”</p><p>This was Qin Sang’s first direct encounter with a late Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Although Daoist Meng hadn’t targeted him, the feeling of having the world controlled by the other party, and being treated like an insect in a jar, left a deep impression on him.</p><p>This was a small incident. A month later, a white line appeared where the sky met the sea, a colossal tide rushing in with a deafening roar.  Powerful undercurrents churned beneath the surface, a massive ocean current passing through.</p><p>The great tide had finally arrived.</p>
