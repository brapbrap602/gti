<h1>Chapter 2005: A World in Mourning</h1><p>Emerging from the small teleportation array, Qin Sang found himself on a large, circular platform forged entirely of black iron.  The platform hung suspended in the air; beyond it stretched boundless clouds and distant, rolling mountains.</p><p>He felt a massive shadow looming above him. Looking up, he saw it: a celestial city in the heavens, a breathtaking fortress of steel!  It was Tianji City.</p><p>Before seeing Tianji City with his own eyes, it was impossible to imagine that the cultivation world held such a strange metropolis.  He could see the city's base, entirely constructed of metal.  Massive iron pieces, intricately connected by mechanisms, formed a seamless whole, their joints clearly visible. Countless individuals must have been involved in forging these colossal pieces, tightly bound together like a colossal airship.</p><p>Eight gigantic iron pillars extended from the 'airship's' underside, anchoring it to the peaks of the surrounding mountains. Supported by these pillars, Tianji City lay across the clouds, high above the world—resembling a gigantic mechanical beast, a steel spider poised to spring into action with its eight legs.  Even in the mountainous Gen Prefecture, such a colossal spider with its incredibly long legs could traverse the land with ease.</p><p>In the sunlight, the entire city shimmered with a metallic luster.  Even straining his eyes, Qin Sang could only barely make out the shadows of the iron pillars through the mist.  The metal was clearly no ordinary iron; intricate runes, meticulously refined by cultivators, adorned its surface.</p><p>It was unimaginable how much precious metal and manpower must have been required to forge such a massive city.</p><p>Qin Sang's current location was a metal platform extending from one of the iron pillars.  Countless similar platforms, densely packed along the pillar, housed not only small teleportation arrays but also various other functions.</p><p>With a flash, he reached the edge of the platform and saw a section of Tianji City proper above the 'airship'.  The lower half resembled a gigantic steel spider, while the upper half resembled an iron lotus blossom.</p><p>People lived within this structure.  However, the city wasn't flat; petal-shaped iron plates were embedded in the main body of Tianji City, extending upwards and outwards. Each of these incredibly thick and massive plates formed a district where people lived, bustling with activity and buildings.  These plates combined to form a gigantic iron lotus blossom, blooming in the heavens, rough, hard, sharp, and shimmering golden in the sun, possessing an unparalleled and strange beauty.</p><p>At the edge of the 'petals', countless black specks drifted in the boundless void. These were various iron birds and beasts—clearly mechanical constructs—carrying cultivators arriving at and departing from Tianji City.  Unlike the lifelike Xuanhu and Chifeng of Canjin City, these mechanical creatures clearly displayed their metallic construction.  Their gleaming, indestructible steel shells, rough and austere, revealed their internal mechanisms through gaps: gears, screws, bearings, connecting rods, chains—intricately crafted, their movements creating a unique metallic symphony.</p><p>Iron birds would fly into the city, landing on the edge of a petal. With a 'click', their mechanisms connected to Tianji City, becoming one with it. There were also cultivators who flew using their own power or rode spirit beasts, but those using mechanical mounts were not subject to inspection, able to enter and exit freely, indicating some form of established rule.</p><p>Besides the mechanical beasts, other means of access existed.  Numerous iron cages, suspended from ropes around the eight great iron pillars, ran between levels, their clanking a constant sound.</p><p>Beneath Tianji City, among the undulating mountains, palaces and pavilions were interspersed, a mix of mortals and immortals living beneath it, yet not deprived of sunlight thanks to some protective array.</p><p>A celestial city above, a steel spider bearing a golden flower!</p><p>Even having heard various rumors on his journey, seeing it with his own eyes left Qin Sang awestruck. Tianji City was the most extraordinary celestial city he’d ever seen in the cultivation world, stirring long-dormant memories and prompting profound reflection.  He wondered if the prefectural cities of the Eight Great Heavenly Prefectures were equally magnificent and unique. What was the atmosphere of the Jade Capital like?</p><p>Composing himself, Qin Sang entered an iron cage.  With the whirring of pulleys, the iron chain pulled the cage rapidly upwards, carrying him into Tianji City.</p><p>He didn't stay long, only briefly observing it before hurrying to witness the human sacred grounds.</p><p>Tianji City and Baiyu City are connected by a powerful teleportation array, allowing for instantaneous travel between them.  I can return anytime if needed.</p><p>After inquiring about the location, Qin Sang found the estate responsible for the teleportation. A Nascent Soul stage manager greeted him.</p><p>The manager sized Qin Sang up, his expression turning serious. He rose, bowed, and asked, "Senior Qin is a Void Refinement cultivator?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, sensing a hidden meaning in the manager's question. He countered, "Is there a cultivation restriction for travel to Baiyu City?"</p><p>"Senior is perceptive. There are indeed requirements. The journey is long, and the teleportation array harbors risks. Generally, only Void Refinement cultivators can ensure their safety. Nascent Soul cultivators must either be accompanied by a Void Refinement cultivator, possess a powerful artifact of authentication, or meet specific, stringent requirements. Otherwise, they are ineligible to travel alone.  The cost is also prohibitive for ordinary individuals. I myself have never had the opportunity to visit the sacred city; it's impossible for those below the Nascent Soul stage…"</p><p>Qin Sang asked thoroughly, and the manager, unwilling to offend him, patiently answered.</p><p>"I understand. I wish to depart as soon as possible.  What is the cost?" Qin Sang pressed further.</p><p>"Senior Li is in charge of the teleportation array. Please follow me," the manager bowed slightly and led Qin Sang deeper into the estate.</p><p>From the outside, it appears as a city of iron and gold, but the interior is a landscape of bridges and streams, no different from the outside world; it all depends on individual preference.</p><p>After passing numerous restrictions, the manager brought Qin Sang before an elderly man.</p><p>"Greetings, Daoist Li," Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Seeing a walking money-bag, the elder Li was very enthusiastic, smiling as he returned the greeting, "Daoist Qin wishes to go to Baiyu City?  What a coincidence! The teleportation array will be activated in an hour. Please take a look at this…"</p><p>He handed over a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang took it, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, a large amount of spirit stones was useless here.  The jade slip listed various rare treasures of heaven and earth; some slightly common spiritual materials were also listed, in much larger quantities.</p><p>The trade fair at the Jitian Grand Assembly, requiring spiritual treasures as entry tickets, was already quite demanding.</p><p>This was even more stringent.  Spiritual treasures were acceptable, but only those of high quality; they didn't accept poorly refined treasures with weak power.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed some heavenly materials and earthly treasures, acquired at the Jitian Grand Assembly or selected from spoils of war, and kept for future use.  Parting with any of them felt painful.</p><p>After weighing his options, he decided using spiritual treasures was the most straightforward approach.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a spiritual treasure called the Yuanli Pure Bowl. This treasure, of unknown origin, was obtained from the legacy of Old Ancestor Minghu.  Among the ancestor's belongings, its quality was second only to the Annihilation Soul Lamp and the Spirit Tablet.  Someone showed interest at the Jitian Grand Assembly, but their offer was too low.</p><p>With the Yuanli Pure Bowl gone, the only spiritual treasure left from Old Ancestor Minghu's possessions was the Spirit Tablet, called Lingji.  Forged from countless flesh, blood, and souls, it was a treasure of immense power.  Qin Sang planned to study it thoroughly before using it.</p><p>"Perhaps I should avoid frequent travel in the future,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Unless he had specific requirements for the power of his divine abilities, refining ordinary spiritual treasures, while only requiring more effort from Qin Sang, was prohibitively expensive.</p><p>After examining the Yuanli Pure Bowl, Elder Li nodded in satisfaction. He gave Qin Sang a jade talisman and led him to another hall via a smaller teleportation array.</p><p>Upon entering the hall, Qin Sang felt a tightening in his heart. The array here was far more formidable than the previous one.</p><p>He calmly scanned his surroundings.  The hall was vast, and the array was in the center, shrouded in a mystical mist, obscuring its true form.</p><p>At the edge of the mist, several figures sat or stood, all Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>Seeing Elder Li and Qin Sang arrive, some nodded to Qin Sang in greeting, while others merely glanced at him before looking away, their expressions cold.</p><p>"There is one hour left; no one else should be coming,"</p><p>Elder Li approached calmly and said,  "Some of you may be traveling to Baiyu City for the first time. Let me offer some advice. During transmission, you must cultivate your power to stabilize yourselves and withstand the void's tremors. Once you reach Baiyu City, in the Grand Zhou Divine Capital, the rules are stricter than in Genzhou.  You will be guided; simply follow the instructions…"</p><p>An hour passed quickly.</p><p>Elder Li stepped into the mist. After a moment, a voice came from within, "You may enter."</p><p>Including Qin Sang, there were eight people. Each activated the jade talisman they received and entered the mist from eight different directions.</p><p>Stepping into the mist, everything was hazy. Even with Void Refinement cultivation, nothing was visible.  Qin Sang didn't use his divine abilities to observe, stopping after three steps, waiting quietly.</p><p>After a period of silence, something unknown happened inside the mist. Qin Sang suddenly felt a tremor beneath his feet, and a powerful wave surged from the depths of the mist, a green light sweeping out and instantly engulfing Qin Sang.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang felt a tremendous force binding her, violently pulling her away. The dark mist vanished, and she was drawn into a bizarre and dazzling world, traveling through streams of light, even transforming into a streak of light herself.</p><p>This place was filled with incredibly chaotic energy.  The jade amulet emitted a series of brittle clicks before shattering with a sharp crack, burning away all its power.</p><p>Qin Sang still felt the violent energy fiercely compressing her, threatening to tear her apart or fling her into the unknown.  With a slight movement of her mind, she summoned the Gray Warbler Sword.  The sword intent enveloped her, its sharp edge pointed forward, cleaving through the waves of energy!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>It felt like an eternity, yet also like a mere instant. The light extinguished, leaving no trace.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long sigh, calming the surging true energy within her body.  She found herself back within the dark mist. Sounds reached her from outside. Stepping out of the mist, she discovered herself surrounded by profound darkness.</p><p>There were no spatial boundaries; above, below, left, and right were all void.</p><p>They were on a suspended circular platform of white jade.  Dozens of jade steps extended from the platform, leading to an unknown destination.</p><p>Along the platform's edge stood numerous golden-armored guards, protecting the place.  They were all cultivators at the Transformation God stage.</p><p>"Senior, please follow me," a golden-armored guard stepped onto one of the jade steps, gesturing for Qin Sang to follow.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly glanced around, then followed closely behind.  As expected, the end of the steps was heavily guarded by restrictions.  Entering the restriction, she dared not resist.  She felt the surroundings twist, then was transported away.  Suddenly, bright sunlight filled her vision.</p><p>Her field of vision expanded dramatically.</p><p>Qin Sang found herself on a mountaintop, surrounded by a boundless expanse of plains.  Her view was almost completely unobstructed, stretching to the horizon where rolling hills finally appeared.</p><p>It was a fertile land, with houses lining the roads, fields crisscrossing the land, and a harmonious atmosphere of peace and prosperity. Millions of humans lived here.</p><p>Beneath her feet was the only mountain in the plain, magnificent and awe-inspiring, reaching for the heavens. Its scale was majestic, truly deserving of the name 'sacred land'!</p><p>This mountain was the human sacred land—Mount Yu Jing!</p><p>Standing atop Mount Yu Jing, the sun, moon, and stars seemed within reach.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's eyes, the clear blue sky concealed a boundless sea of clouds, deliberately hidden from the eyes of ordinary mortals.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around. Behind her was a tall white jade platform. Atop the platform stood a colossal statue, so enormous that even from below the clouds, its base was barely visible.</p><p>She slowly flew towards the clouds, passing through an invisible barrier.  Arriving above the clouds, the scene changed dramatically.</p><p>The first thing she saw was a towering white jade statue of a man, as tall as the jade mountain itself, his feet on the sacred mountain and his head touching the sky.</p><p>The statue depicted a man in pristine white robes, his hands clasped behind his back, gazing into the distance.  He was divinely handsome, exuding supreme authority. His eyes held infinite weariness, as if worrying about the future of humanity. His tightly clenched fists seemed determined to forge a path for mankind.</p><p>No introduction was needed.  Throughout history, only one person could be so honored, so majestic: the Jade Emperor!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn as she gazed upon the statue. Then she looked away, noticing that she was standing in a cloud-formed plaza bustling with cultivators.</p><p>To the north of the sea of clouds was a vast celestial palace.</p><p>Surrounded by clouds and mist, with ethereal air and celestial beings constantly passing, stood countless majestic palaces, adorned with glazed tiles and sparkling with gold and splendor.  Above the clouds, layers upon layers of white clouds concealed tiered palaces; the thirty-three heavens were clearly visible!</p><p>The Jade Capital!</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recalled what she had seen in the Divine Court.  That was a Daoist paradise imagined by Daoist masters—the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions, encompassing all things, reaching the pinnacle of magnificence.  But the Jade Capital before her was real, a true celestial palace.</p><p>While admiring the celestial palace, Qin Sang noticed something unusual.</p><p>Within the Jade Capital, everyone wore white headbands, and every household displayed white streamers. A heavy, solemn atmosphere prevailed.</p><p>“King Zhou has passed away, ascending to the heavens; the whole world is in mourning!”</p><p>Someone suddenly spoke nearby, his tone heavy with sorrow.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. King Zhou had died!</p><p>When did this happen?  The Heavenly Mechanism City had given no indication whatsoever!</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly realized something was wrong.</p><p>After reaching the Void Refinement stage, lifespan is virtually limitless. Death usually comes from heavenly tribulations or accidents.  The term ‘natural death’ is almost never used.  What was King Zhou's cultivation level?</p><p>Qin Sang looked to her side.  The speaker had approached her. Looking at his face, she found him to be one of the golden-armored guards.</p><p>He was a middle-aged man, unfamiliar in appearance, yet for some reason, Qin Sang felt inexplicably familiar with him.</p><p>“Old servant greets the Real Person!”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could speak, the man transmitted his voice, using the familiar voice and respectful tone she recognized, “My master ordered me to stay here and await the Real Person’s arrival!”</p>
