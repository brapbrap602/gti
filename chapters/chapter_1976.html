<h1>Chapter 1967:  Possession</h1><p>“嘤嘤……”</p><p>Xiao Wu looked down at the white fox in her arms.</p><p>She released her aura, and the fox clearly recognized her.  It was the little fox she had kept during her time at the ruins of the Lei Xiao Sect.</p><p>For fifteen years, Qin Sang had mostly been in seclusion, cultivating within the Thunder Altar. Zhu Que and Luo Hou were somewhat afraid of her, so she was mostly kept company only by the small animals let into the mountains by the spirit array.</p><p>Among them, the little fox had been her companion the longest, and was also the most intelligent.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang had asked Xiao Wu if she wanted to take the fox with her, but Xiao Wu had refused.  She hadn't expected to reunite with it under these circumstances.</p><p>The woman and fox looked at each other.</p><p>The fox's eyes were full of surprise, appearing even more intelligent than before.</p><p>Xiao Wu reached out and gently stroked the fox's head.</p><p>“唧唧!”</p><p>The fox chirped, closing its eyes in the same contented way as before.</p><p>The mountain wind rustled through the trees.</p><p>A gentle breeze and warm sunlight bathed them, the wind whispering in their ears.</p><p>It felt like old times.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression softened. She looked around, sensing her surroundings, and realized she had unknowingly flown beyond Yan Kingdom.  Below her lay unfamiliar territory.</p><p>What should she do next?</p><p>Xiao Wu remained silent for a moment, then set her goal:  Yan capital city, by Jade Waist Lake, the Green Sheep Tea House.</p><p>As for her questions, she had no answers yet, but there was no need to worry.  Perhaps she would find the opportunity to solve her mysteries later.</p><p>White clouds drifted lazily.</p><p>Xiao Wu traveled on the clouds, the white fox cradled in her arms.</p><p>From time to time, a fox's cry echoed from the clouds, seemingly recounting its experiences over the years.</p><p>Upon arriving at the Green Sheep Tea House, a servant from the Qin household was waiting, immediately rushing back to the manor.</p><p>Soon, Yu Lang arrived hurriedly.</p><p>Upon learning the truth, the last of Yu Lang's hopes vanished.</p><p>The Master, who had dedicated his life to the people, might, after death, retain his spiritual light and ascend to divinity.</p><p>But on the battlefield, unless immediately guided after death, a fragile soul couldn't withstand the overwhelming bloodlust and killing energy. It would either be scattered instantly or tainted and transformed into an evil spirit.</p><p>Xiao Wu handed Yu Lang the letter left by Chen Zhenqing.  It contained only eight words, which Yu Lang studied for a long time before carefully putting it away.  He then rose and said, “Senior Sister, I’ll go now.”</p><p>“Alright,” Xiao Wu rose to see him off. She sealed her and the fox’s cultivation, returning to their human forms.</p><p>Leaving the tea house, Yu Lang paused, gazing towards the imperial palace, and said gravely, “I will make Yan’s strength far surpass Liang’s, and defeat them decisively in battle, to honor the Master!”</p><p>News of the emergency reached the capital, sending shockwaves through the court.</p><p>Simultaneously, various factions within the capital were stirring.</p><p>Liang's invasion, occurring at such a coincidental time, was deeply suspicious.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Lang and the Crown Prince’s faction had already sensed something amiss.  A storm was brewing, and some matters would likely be resolved soon.</p><p>Yu Lang tightened his robe, took a deep breath, and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>…</p><p>From that day on, the patrons of the Green Sheep Tea House noticed a lazy white fox appearing from somewhere. Sometimes it would lie on the proprietress’s lap, other times on the counter, always by her side, dozing lazily, ignoring customers’ attempts to play with it, only offering disdainful glances.</p><p>Yet, the patrons loved it, charmed by the fox’s spirit and grace.</p><p>However, the tea house patrons soon had more pressing concerns than a white fox.</p><p>News of the Liang invasion and border crisis reached the capital, causing widespread panic.</p><p>In a short time, Yan lost eight prefectures of Luzhou.  The Liang army was unstoppable, and Yan's forces retreated repeatedly, resulting in the near collapse of Luzhou.  Nearby prefectures were terrified, sending frequent urgent requests for reinforcements.  The situation deteriorated daily.</p><p>…</p><p>“And it's precisely at this time that His Majesty’s illness worsened. He refuses to attend to state affairs; memorials are sent to him but never receive a response, simply left unprocessed.”</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Yu Lang returned to the tea house and, as always, unreservedly shared the precarious situation and his plans with Xiao Wu.</p><p>“Yan faces internal and external crises. The Crown Prince lacks authority, the princes are all scheming, the court officials are hesitant, and the officials are endlessly debating in the court, wasting precious time!”</p><p>Yu Lang sighed, his voice weary.</p><p>Even as a cultivator with abundant energy, at the heart of the political turmoil, he felt overwhelmed.</p><p>"...Beyond the borders of Yan, other nations are also starting to stir..."</p><p>"...A decision has finally been made to deploy a large army, unfortunately, I cannot personally lead the troops east!"</p><p>...</p><p>"I've found a clue. As expected, among the princes, someone must be colluding with Liang, working together inside and out! Taking advantage of Yan's internal and external troubles to seize the throne!"</p><p>Yu Lang's tone was colder.</p><p>"There was a change in the palace. The imperial guards under Tao Teng were secretly summoned to the palace at night, almost failing to send out a message."</p><p>...</p><p>An ordinary morning.</p><p>In the capital city, many soldiers suddenly appeared on the streets, hurrying back and forth, the clashing of their armor echoing loudly.</p><p>Ordinary citizens sensed an impending storm and closed their doors and windows.</p><p>All the underwater currents suddenly erupted that day!</p><p>It was later reported.</p><p>That night, the palace was ablaze, the fire raging throughout the night.</p><p>Fires erupted in various parts of the capital, the sounds of fighting shook the heavens, countless mansions were burned and razed, and many families vanished overnight.</p><p>The city gates were closed, crossbows were prepared, pointed outwards.</p><p>At some point, a large army appeared outside the city, and the style of their armor was almost identical to that of the city's defenders.</p><p>A great battle was imminent.</p><p>As fellow citizens of Yan, they were like enemies.</p><p>...</p><p>The next day.</p><p>At dawn.</p><p>The capital, chaotic all night, returned to calm.</p><p>Yu Lang, covered in blood, arrived at the Qingyang Tea House.</p><p>Outside the teahouse, he took off his armor, jumped into the Yuyao Lake, washing away the blood, changed into civilian clothes, and once again became a refined young man.</p><p>Xiao Wu, holding a small fox, came down from the second floor.</p><p>"Successful?"</p><p>"Successful!"</p><p>Yu Lang affirmed, his expression not one of excitement, but rather a sense of relief.</p><p>He had traveled the world for a year, studied for three years, and served as an official for eleven years after becoming the top scholar, never daring to relax, carefully planning each step, finally reaching this day!</p><p>He had almost become accustomed to secular life; only when meeting his senior sister would he recall the past, reminding himself of his true identity and origins.</p><p>"Unfortunately, the Third Prince escaped. We miscalculated. He is the mastermind behind the collusion with Liang. The Second Prince was used but didn't realize it, pitifully tragic!"</p><p>Yu Lang took a sip of tea, shaking his head and sighing softly.</p><p>"The late Emperor was wise and had made preparations. The current Emperor's ascension to the throne was smoother than expected. Because of this, the Third Prince retreated decisively when things went wrong.  Many of his forces are still lurking, certainly not giving up.</p><p>"However, the Emperor's succession is legitimate, and the hearts of the people are with him. Even if the Third Prince spreads false rumors, he won't be able to create too much trouble. I'm afraid that he will continue to collude with Liang, plotting against the state; it is the people who will suffer.</p><p>"Next, Yan faces internal and external troubles. Tao Teng and I have discussed it, and we plan to have one of us stay in the capital and the other go out to quell the rebellion."</p><p>...</p><p>"Inappropriate!"</p><p>In the imperial study, the new Emperor decisively rejected the proposal.</p><p>"I know you are both civil and military, and your martial arts are excellent, but on the battlefield, swords have no eyes. You should remain in the court and strategize! As for leading the troops to quell the rebellion and drive out the foreign enemy, there is Yuan Guogong and others."</p><p>As expected, not long after escaping the city, the Third Prince raised his flag in Yingzhou, in the north of Luzhou, which also borders Liang, declaring himself Emperor, claiming that the current Emperor had evil intentions, imprisoned the late Emperor, forged edicts, and his ascension to power was illegitimate.</p><p>In addition to the Third Prince, several other escaped princes responded in various states, creating quite a stir, causing unrest in Yan.</p><p>Coincidentally, Liang launched an attack on Yingzhou at this time, but suddenly stopped their offensive, remaining stationary, acting not like enemies, but rather as if bolstering the Third Prince’s power.</p><p>After the court meeting, Tao Teng and Yu Lang were summoned to the imperial study again to discuss suppressing the rebellion.</p><p>Tao Teng stepped forward and said:  "A loyal minister can be a civil official and a military leader! The top scholar is a brilliant mind, and his prestige among scholars is unparalleled. When people see the top scholar on the battlefield, they will know what is legitimate and what is a rebel, as they say, those who follow the righteous path receive help, while those against it receive none, thus we can easily eliminate the rebels."</p><p>"I am willing to relieve the Emperor’s worries and do my utmost," Yu Lang also said.</p><p>The Emperor paced a few steps, sighing softly, "Qin, you must be careful! You two are pillars of the state, my two wings; the loss of either of you would be a loss to Yan, a loss to me!"</p><p>Then, picking up a scroll from his desk, the Emperor said, "Chen Fu Jun sacrificed his life for the country, and I will always remember that. I have decided to posthumously confer him the title of Marquis of Loyalty and Bravery, inheritable by his descendants. What do you two think?"</p><p>Both were overjoyed, "Thank you, Your Majesty!"</p><p>...</p><p>In the military tent.</p><p>Yu Lang, clad in armor, sat upright and still, reviewing numerous reports and letters.  Several strong, capable men stood at attention.</p><p>One of them exclaimed angrily, "The surrender offer was thrown into the city and burned by the rebel commander, who also dared to openly insult us! This man is stubbornly resisting, oblivious to his impending doom. When do we attack, General?"</p><p>Yu Lang listened to his subordinate's report, a flicker of doubt crossing his eyes. He hadn't gone directly to Yingzhou; the Emperor had ordered him elsewhere to quell the rebellion.  Other areas differed from Yingzhou, which had the strong support of Liang. These other places only had conscripted local militia and hastily assembled able-bodied men; their equipment was incomplete.  His imperial army's arrival should have been like a whirlwind, with enemy commanders surrendering at the mere sight of them.  The reality was far different.</p><p>He led one army himself to attack Youyang Prefecture; two deputy generals commanded the other two armies, advancing in parallel.  All three armies met with fierce resistance.  Rebellion was a grave crime for the Yi people!  Surrender was offered with amnesty, yet the garrisons of all three cities fought to the death.  The prince they followed stood no chance against the imperial army unless the Third Prince led reinforcements from Yingzhou; otherwise, defeat was inevitable.</p><p>Suddenly, Yu Lang felt a stirring within. A commoner might not have thought of it, but as a cultivator who had descended to the mortal world, he was compelled to delve deeper into this illogical situation.  What force had made these rebels fearless of death?</p><p>He thought of Tao Teng and himself.  The city god of Yan's capital had allowed them into the mortal realm; could it have also admitted other cultivators, disguised as ordinary people?  Yu Lang had sensed the city god's actions were too casual at the time.  With the jade pendant given by the city god, unless he chose to reveal himself, even Shi Da Ge couldn't discern whether they were cultivators or mortals.</p><p>During the struggle for the throne, Yu Lang hadn't discovered any officials or soldiers who were clearly cultivators.  It seemed that within the imperial palace, under the watchful eye of the city god, no one dared to act recklessly.  Away from the capital, however, secular methods failed, and some finally couldn't contain themselves, eager for chaos.</p><p>Yu Lang frowned.  Unfortunately, his senior sister had sealed her cultivation, and Shi Da Ge claimed to have hit a bottleneck and needed a period of seclusion.  Otherwise, if there were cultivators among the rebels, their identities could be easily uncovered.</p><p>"Report, General!  A dispatch from Yingzhou: the pretender's momentum has suddenly weakened; he has chosen to fortify the city and hold out.  The Liang army within Yan territory is also hesitant; instead of sending reinforcements, Liang appears to be secretly withdrawing troops, as if something has happened back home…"</p><p>Another letter arrived. Yu Lang looked at the documents on his desk. This was expected. The Liang emperor was several years older than the deceased Yan emperor and likely nearing his end, leading to a power struggle for the throne. The Yan emperor was planning to use their own tactics against them.  Yu Lang had previously marveled at the Liang emperor's shrewdness in preemptively sending an army to disrupt Yan, allowing Liang to focus on its internal affairs and preventing Yan from taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>This sudden thought led Yu Lang down a rabbit hole, ultimately making him break out in a cold sweat.  Was this struggle for the throne, involving two nations, as simple as it seemed? How many cultivators were secretly involved? What were their goals? To pursue their ambitions, to toy with mortals, or was something else at play?</p><p>What was the purpose of the Yan ghosts and gods? And Tao Teng's master, whom he hadn't had the opportunity to visit—who was he?</p><p>Yu Lang felt inexplicably anxious. He rose from his desk and paced back and forth in his tent. It felt like an invisible hand was controlling him, Tao Teng, the emperor, the officials, the common people—all of Yan!</p><p>Yu Lang unconsciously opened his mouth.  A dark cloud seemed to hang in the sky, like the tent's canvas, pressing down lower and lower, suffocating him. This dark cloud was the world of cultivation…</p><p>Secular chaos.  The cultivation world was also unsettled.</p><p>In southwestern Yan, the mountains were high and the valleys deep.  In the dense forest, mist hung heavy, like white clouds shrouding the peaks, boundless, only dispersing around noon, only to gather again in the afternoon.  Within the mist, several figures were flying slowly.</p><p>They were standing on a bamboo leaf-shaped artifact that emitted a faint green glow, enveloping them, not leaking even a hint of fluctuation as they flew.  Despite the artifact's protection, they flew low, almost skimming the forest floor.</p><p>Leading the way, controlling the artifact, was Yin He Qian, the head of the Yin family.  Those behind him were all Yin family experts; Yin Qiao Er's cultivation was insufficient for this, so she did not come, but her aunt, Nian Hui, was among them.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>I was a little tipsy the last few days, and woke up suddenly this morning, so I hastily wrote this.</p>
