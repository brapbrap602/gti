<h1>Chapter 1596: The Green-Furred Rat Demon</h1><p>The dark clouds in the sky were torn apart by the residual waves of the battle.</p><p>Sparse starlight poured down, illuminating the thousand-zhang giant crocodile.</p><p>In a short time, the body of this peerless ferocious beast condensed from an illusory state to near solidity.  Its pitch-black scales, tightly arranged, reflected a demonic luster.</p><p>As the thousand-zhang crocodile twisted its body, the scales also shifted in a rhythmic pattern, just like a living beast.</p><p>The starlight could only reach half of the giant crocodile's body; the other half was hidden in shadow, its outline flickering, exuding an unknown terror that chilled the heart.</p><p>Its massive maw, opened to the extreme, faced Qin Sang.  Inside, it seemed as if a black hole existed, an overwhelming suction force forming a clearly visible vortex in the air.</p><p>Fierce winds raged in the high altitude.</p><p>The vortex continued to expand, its range growing wider and wider, even affecting the Twin Tiger Mountain below. A booming sound echoed from the left peak.</p><p>At the mountaintop, the giant boulder shaped like a tiger's head fractured with the sound. The broken stone was directly swept away by the suction force, torn into fragments in less than a breath, vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>The suction vortex was immense, as if it wanted to devour this entire piece of the void.</p><p>Ripples, like water waves, formed around the edge of the vortex, spreading outward, relentlessly pursuing Qin Sang, who was right at the edge, his figure flickering constantly.</p><p>A strange look crossed Qin Sang’s face. He had underestimated that crocodile bone. The vortex wasn't just pure suction; it contained a peculiar confining power.</p><p>If trapped by the suction vortex, or if he fell into the belly of the thousand-zhang crocodile, escaping would be a great ordeal.</p><p>Daring to rob others midway through a top-tier Exchange Meeting of Mystical Treasures, they truly had some tricks!</p><p>A fire lotus phantom appeared on Qin Sang’s forehead. Nine Nether Demonic Fire flowed out like a liquid, coming into contact with the suction vortex and forming a black stream of fire.  Without any resistance, it was sucked into the belly of the thousand-zhang crocodile.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The belly of the giant crocodile suddenly swelled, and it went into a frenzy.</p><p>It seemed to be in great pain, its massive body rolling frantically, crashing through mountain peaks one after another. Rubble flew everywhere, turning the area upside down.</p><p>As it rolled, its solidified body became somewhat blurred. The suction vortex stopped expanding, and its edges began to collapse, contracting inward, unable to pursue Qin Sang any longer.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the thousand-zhang crocodile.  His figure flickered, merging into the sword formation.</p><p>Within the Seven Soul Slaughter Formation, a chilling aura pervaded. Dark sword threads were everywhere, like strings of a zither, but playing the melody of death.</p><p>It was unknown what sword art Qin Sang employed, but the formation suddenly vibrated. The sword threads became drastically thinner, yet their power increased. They sliced towards the mass of mist in the center of the formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Trapped within the sword formation, the one-horned man was both shocked and furious.</p><p>He still couldn't figure out where he had gone wrong.</p><p>Unfazed by the danger, the tip of his horn glowed, shooting out a gray beam.  Its speed was no less than a sword beam, piercing into the sword formation like lightning.</p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p>The sword threads trembled. Not only were they not pierced by the gray beam, but dozens of them quickly counterattacked, instantly slicing the gray beam into pieces, its power completely nullified.</p><p>Watching the gray beam dissipate, the one-horned man gasped.</p><p>This was a divine ability he had refined for many years. Many enemies had been severely injured by the gray beam and died at his hands. Yet, facing this sword formation, it seemed so weak.</p><p>Although his sneak attack failed, the one-horned man wasn't too panicked.</p><p>His companion would arrive soon.</p><p>He only needed to hold on for a few breaths.</p><p>His true form was a celestial spirit beast, possessing a powerful body and vast divine abilities. Even if he wasn't a match for a human Grand Cultivator, he was confident in withstanding a few blows.</p><p>However, seeing the sword formation shred the gray beam, a sense of unease arose in his heart.</p><p>His rich experience prompted him to make the safest choice.  His throat rolled, emitting a whimpering sound, and he spewed a cloud of grayish-white mist from his mouth, which surged out through the gaps in his helmet.</p><p>The grayish-white mist formed a dense fog within the sword formation. The one-horned man's figure didn't completely disappear, but flickered continuously in various corners of the mist, making it difficult for his opponent to grasp his position.</p><p>Unfortunately, this tactic couldn't deceive the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Every movement of the one-horned man was within Qin Sang's sight, as if he were watching a monkey perform.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword threads slashed towards the one-horned man’s true body.</p><p>The one-horned man was still shifting around. He was horrified to discover that the enemy was completely unaffected. The power unleashed by the sword formation in an instant terrified him. His eyes filled with fear, his figure flickered, and his entire body glowed brightly with gray light.</p><p>Within the intense gray light, the one-horned man's body distorted grotesquely, no longer resembling a human. He revealed his true form – a one-horned crocodile.</p><p>At the same time, a streak of azure rainbow flew from the horizon, arriving with overwhelming momentum, and crashing into the sword formation.</p><p>The azure rainbow dissipated, revealing the figure of the green-armored man.</p><p>His face was grim. He raised his hands, his fingers slightly curved. Dense azure light shot from his fingertips, transforming into two giant azure claws.</p><p>The claws were slender, not resembling human hands at all, but rather the claws of a rat.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>The giant claws plunged into the sword formation. Wherever the azure light touched, the sword threads became sluggish, bound by an unknown force.  They turned from intangible to tangible, then were grasped by the giant claws and forcibly torn apart from both within and without!</p><p>Gray mist was revealed below.</p><p>“Big Brother!”</p><p>The one-horned man emerged from the mist, his scales shattered, covered in blood and wounds left by the sword threads, looking utterly battered.</p><p>Seeing the green-armored man, the one-horned man was overjoyed, as if a great burden had been lifted.  He hurriedly rushed upwards.</p><p>Just then, the green-armored man's pupils contracted sharply, reflecting a point of crimson firelight.  A look of shock appeared on his stern face, and he blurted out, “Careful!”</p><p>The one-horned man was bewildered.</p><p>Then, his vision was filled with crimson firelight.</p><p>Before he could react, he felt a tightness around his neck. Caught completely off guard, he was seized by a green hand and flung towards the crimson light!</p><p>“I've been waiting for you!”</p><p>Inside the sword formation, Qin Sang held the Sun God Tree in one hand, tilting his head slightly, a sneer on his lips.  He had pretended to fall into the trap.  His true target was never the one-horned man, but the green-armored man, whose aura was the most concealed of the three.</p><p>As long as he could slay this person, the other two were of little concern.</p><p>Three branches were empty on the Sun God Tree.  Qin Sang had hidden the three divine birds within the sword formation, holding them back until this moment to strike!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The dim space formed by the sword formation was instantly illuminated by the blinding firelight.</p><p>From afar, a massive fireball appeared, hanging high in the sky like a red morning sun, even more dazzling than the white light created by the crocodile bone.</p><p>Two inhuman roars echoed from within the fireball.</p><p>One was sharp and filled with rage.</p><p>The other was full of pain and terror.</p><p>One azure and one gray light flashed at the same time as the crimson fire erupted.</p><p>Azure above, gray below.</p><p>From the outside, one could clearly see that within the gray light was the one-horned crocodile. Although smaller than the thousand-zhang crocodile, it was still a rare great demon.</p><p>At the same time, a stream of crimson fire shot into the sky, incredibly violent.</p><p>Facing this crimson stream of light, the ferocious great demon looked as if it had seen the most terrifying thing in the world.  Its eyes were filled with terror and disbelief.</p><p>Accompanied by an earth-shattering explosion.</p><p>A crimson flame flower bloomed in the sky.  The aura of the Southern Brightly Fire fully erupted, streams of flames shooting in all directions, forming a boundless sea of fire in the sky.</p><p>No other colors could be seen in the sky anymore; both the azure and gray lights were devoured by the flames.</p><p>The cries of pain abruptly ceased.</p><p>After attacking, the Sun God Birds were like rootless duckweed. Their power peaked at the moment of eruption, then the flame power gradually dissipated, and the firelight dimmed.</p><p>A black shadow fell from the sky, a charred crocodile corpse, crashing towards the ground.</p><p>At the last moment, the one-horned man was used as a shield by his sworn brother, perishing instantly!</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>A streak of azure light shot out of the sea of fire, revealing a demonic form – a green-furred rat demon.</p><p>The rat demon was less than half a man tall, with smooth fur, appearing much like an ordinary rat.</p><p>Even in its true form, it still wore its armor, though it was now tattered and scorched in several places. Its eyes were sharp as blades, staring fixedly at the sea of fire below, filled with murderous intent!</p><p>“They are all Demon Kings?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s figure appeared beneath the sea of fire, his expression grave.</p><p>Discovering that the one-horned man was a crocodile demon, Qin Sang had assumed it was the green-armored man's spirit beast, not thinking about the demon race.</p><p>After all, this was the heartland of the human domain, where human power was strongest.  For demons to roam here and dare to ambush cultivators was simply too audacious.</p><p>He hadn't expected them all to be demon beasts!</p><p>They must have relied on that armor to conceal their demonic identities.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't noticed anything before they were exposed.</p><p>Having slain the one-horned man in one strike, Qin Sang was still dissatisfied.</p><p>He had turned the tables, using the one-horned man to set a trap, employing the Sun God Tree.  He hadn’t expected the green-furred rat demon to be so ruthless and decisive, throwing its companion out as a shield.</p><p>Judging by the rat demon’s appearance, its injuries probably weren't serious.</p><p>Demon Kings had robust bodies; these injuries wouldn't affect them much.</p><p>“You must die!”</p><p>The green-furred rat demon’s voice was sharp, cold as ice.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart tightened. He flapped his phoenix wings behind him, pushing his escape technique to the limit.  At the same time, the Golden Sinking Sword hanging above his head hummed loudly, thrusting towards his back.</p><p>Faint azure light appeared in the void behind him.</p><p>The green-furred rat demon, as if teleporting, silently appeared behind Qin Sang, its sharp claws reaching for his heart. If it connected, even with Qin Sang’s Demon King-level physique, he would have no chance of survival.</p><p>A clap of thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang escaped hundreds of zhang away.</p><p>The green-furred rat demon missed its attack and paused briefly, then realized Qin Sang had been concealing his true escape technique.</p><p>Qin Sang was also shocked.</p><p>He hadn't sensed how the rat demon appeared behind him until the very last moment, thanks to his powerful divine sense and quick reflexes.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Sword light scattered.</p><p>The green-furred rat demon raised its claws and danced them in the void.  Its claws, as hard as magical treasures, left trails of cold light, blocking the incoming sword strike.</p><p>Just then, the gray-armored man finally arrived, late to the scene.</p><p>The battle had changed too quickly.</p><p>The gray-armored man regretted not having more legs. He could only watch helplessly as his brother fell, letting out a mournful roar and revealing his true form – another crocodile demon, just without a horn.</p><p>This crocodile demon didn't have scales.  Water-like ripples covered its soft skin.</p><p>The ripples came alive.</p><p>Layer upon layer of water waves stirred, creating the sound of rushing water.</p><p>The sound surprisingly resonated around Qin Sang.</p><p>A vast expanse of water appeared beneath him, and raging waves surged upwards.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the water was about to take shape, a purple stream of light shot out from the forest below.  Inside the purple light was a drill-shaped crystal, its tip sharp, piercing straight towards the crocodile demon's lower abdomen.</p><p>The crocodile demon, caught completely off guard, hurriedly rolled to narrowly avoid the purple crystal, interrupting its spell.</p><p>“Who! Get out!”</p><p>The crocodile demon roared furiously, its tail whipping at the ground.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't seem surprised at all.  He shook his hand, flames swirling on the Sun God Tree as he aimed it at the green-furred rat demon.  The three Sun God Birds shimmered faintly, their wings fluttering as if about to take flight.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Several streaks of escaping light appeared in the distant sky, all attracted by the battle.</p><p>One person exclaimed, “There are great demons here!”</p><p>A hint of ecstasy laced their voice.</p><p>The green-furred rat demon’s expression flickered. It took a deep look at Qin Sang, its figure disappearing again, reappearing next to the crocodile demon.  Azure light enveloped the crocodile demon, preparing to escape.</p><p>However, the purple crystal returned, suddenly exploding.  Strange purple lightning within bombarded the azure light, scattering it, leaving the crocodile demon struggling to defend itself.</p><p>The hidden figure never revealed themselves.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Sun God Birds arrived swiftly, closing in fast.</p><p>Qin Sang made a gesture as if he would summon more divine birds.</p><p>Having just witnessed the power of the Sun God Tree, the green-furred rat demon’s eyelids twitched. Seeing the situation was hopeless, it decisively abandoned its companion and transformed into an azure rainbow, fleeing.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Another crimson fire flower bloomed in the void.</p><p>The crocodile demon, still entangled by the purple lightning, was heavily wounded again!</p><p>Because Qin Sang had deliberately adjusted the angle, the crocodile demon was only severely injured, not killed.  It dragged its mangled body and tried to escape, but suddenly heard two strange grunts, "Heng" and "Ha."  Its Nascent Soul suffered intense pain. It screamed and collapsed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword flew from an unknown location, emitting a strange brilliance, circling the crocodile demon’s neck.</p><p>Its tough skin, already torn and bleeding from the Sun God Birds' attack, offered little defense. The massive crocodile head rolled off.</p><p>As its head fell, a crystal-clear pill flew out from its bloody cavity.  Inside the pill was a tiny crocodile demon with a panicked expression – the crocodile demon’s Demon Core and spirit.</p><p>The Demon Core transformed into a blue light, shooting outwards.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword flickered, transforming into a small sword formation, perfectly trapping the Demon Core within.</p><p>Sword light enveloped the crocodile corpse and the Demon Core.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in mid-air, gazing in the direction the green-furred rat demon had fled.  He didn't choose to pursue, instead turning his gaze coldly towards the approaching streaks of escaping light.</p><p>The escaping lights all stopped.</p><p>The newcomers had various expressions, surprised that the battle had concluded so quickly.  One hesitated for a moment, then turned to follow the green-furred rat demon.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Twin Tiger Mountain, collecting the crocodile bone and the other corpse.</p><p>“Why not keep that rat demon?”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly spoke, as if talking to someone.</p><p>“Heh heh, are late-stage Transformation Realm great demons so easy to kill?”</p><p>A sinister chuckle echoed from the shadows.  “Besides, I wouldn't want to be mistaken for your accomplice and be hunted down by Luye!”</p>
