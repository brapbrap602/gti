<h1>Chapter 1189  Gong Liangyu</h1><p>It didn't take long before Qin Sang heard footsteps outside and rose to greet the visitor.</p><p>It was Zhen Yi Daozhang.</p><p>Two others were with him. One was Qing Jun, disguised as Leng Yuntian, and the other was a young man Qin Sang didn't recognize.</p><p>The young man was tall and handsome.  Strangely, his cultivation was only at the peak of the Core Formation stage. Yet, standing beside two Nascent Soul masters, he remained composed, showing no sign of nervousness.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue!"</p><p>Before seeing him, his voice was heard. Zhen Yi Daozhang quickly entered the hall, a look of surprise on his face when he saw Qin Sang. "I've heard of Daoist Mingyue's achievements and wondered what kind of person you were. Indeed, meeting you surpasses all expectations!"</p><p>"Daoist Master is too kind. I only managed to kill the old demon Pei with the help of Daoists Si Di and Jing Lin. My achievements are insignificant compared to yours," Qin Sang humbly replied.</p><p>Qing Jun smiled slightly, "Daoist Master was about to leave the city to handle some urgent matters, but upon hearing of Daoist Mingyue's arrival, he immediately came."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qing Jun. After arriving at Sandie Pass, they had secretly contacted each other several times, but due to the unpredictable situation, they had not been able to meet. This was the first time Qin Sang had seen Qing Jun since his Nascent Soul advancement. Qin Sang saw a hint of approval in Qing Jun's eyes.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daozhang laughed heartily, "Isn't that true for Daoist Leng as well? Daoist Mingyue, having just advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, managed to kill a cultivator of the same level. If the other Daoists weren't away on patrol, they would definitely have come to witness Daoist Mingyue's prowess!"</p><p>Zhen Yi Daozhang gestured, "Let me introduce you, Daoist Mingyue. This is Daoist Leng Yuntian, the Sect Master of the Yuan Shen Sect."</p><p>"Long admired, long admired!"</p><p>Qin Sang pretended it was their first meeting. Qing Jun returned the bow.</p><p>The two exchanged a knowing smile. Qing Jun understood Qin Sang's plan and didn't expose him publicly.</p><p>"And this is Daoist Gong Liangyu, the current Palace Master of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace…"</p><p>Zhen Yi Daozhang pointed to the young man.</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang recalled, "You are the Palace Master of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace! My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>"No need for such formality! I was stationed in Wangdong City, and happened to have business in Shiqu Mountain.  It's my good fortune to meet Daoist Mingyue!" Gong Liangyu responded politely and composedly.</p><p>Truly the demeanor of a Palace Master.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't surprised. Even without Nascent Soul cultivation, as the Palace Master of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, he was qualified to interact with them as equals.</p><p>It had been a long time since Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had a Nascent Soul Palace Master. Qin Sang remembered the previous Palace Master, Tie Guanzi, who was also at the peak of Core Formation, and whom he'd met before Tie Guanzi entered Ziwei Palace. It was highly likely that Tie Guanzi had fallen.</p><p>Yet, Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had not fallen from its position among the major righteous sects. That was the foundation of a major sect—even without Nascent Soul cultivators, they still possessed means to deter those with Nascent Soul cultivation.</p><p>Shangyuan Qingjing Palace possessed four powerful talismans: the Heavenly Gang Blade Talisman, the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, and the Inner Scene Primordial Talisman; these three were at the Golden Core level. The last one, however, was not a simple talisman but a talisman puppet—a Nascent Soul talisman puppet!</p><p>However, Qin Sang had heard that Shangyuan Qingjing Palace's Nascent Soul talisman puppet couldn't travel too far from the mountain gate and could only be used to protect the sect. Otherwise, Shangyuan Qingjing Palace wouldn't need to rely on Shaohua Mountain.  Of course, this reliance was more of a mutual alliance than subordination.</p><p>After exchanging pleasantries, the four sat down in the hall.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue, you killed a Zuoyuan Nascent Soul, a great achievement. We've recorded significant merit for you.  What would you like to redeem?  I will instruct someone to find it for you," Zhen Yi Daozhang said enthusiastically.</p><p>He had already received messages from Jing Lin and Si Di, learning that this demon king was not hostile to humans and was willing to assist the alliance.  Naturally, he wanted to cultivate this relationship.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "No rush. I've only recently advanced and haven't yet sorted out my path. I'll ask for your help if I need anything.  Perhaps I'll have even more merit in the future."</p><p>In reality, his cultivation methods had already been decided; he would cultivate two simultaneously. His main treasure was also at its limit.  He only had two things in mind: refining a treasure to contain and subdue the South Bright Sun Fire, and cultivating the Fire Seed Golden Lotus, starting with the ancestral sacred fire of Qingyang Demon Sect.</p><p>He had some ideas for the first one, but they were still immature and he wasn't sure what materials he'd need. For the second, he needed to meet Mei Gu and investigate Qingyang Demon Sect before making a decision.</p><p>In any case, the two-domain alliance couldn't ignore his contributions. He would wait until he needed something.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's implication that he would continue to assist, Zhen Yi Daozhang was overjoyed and readily agreed.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang inquired about the new situation, learning that Zuoyuan was very stubborn and showed no sign of withdrawing.</p><p>Zhen Yi Daozhang also inquired about the Youjing Tower and the Soul Annihilation Cone.</p><p>The methods used to attack the soul are unpredictable, and the power demonstrated by the Soul-Extinguishing Cone has put everyone on high alert. The Two Realms Alliance has held numerous discussions on this matter.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hide anything, recounting the events as they happened.</p><p>He indirectly sought information from Daoist Zhenyi, but found no evidence linking the Abyss of Sin and the ancient demons.</p><p>After a brief private conversation, Qin Sang explained his purpose.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi immediately ordered someone to bring the demon soldiers.  He had already approved Qin Sang's request to mobilize troops, but due to the tense situation, there hadn't been an opportunity until now.</p><p>Taking his leave from Daoist Zhenyi, Qin Sang, guided by a cultivator, met Old Monkey in a side hall.</p><p>For days, Old Monkey had been listening to everyone talking about the legend of the Moonlit Demon King slaying a Nascent Soul cultivator, his ears were practically calloused.</p><p>Finally seeing Qin Sang, Old Monkey couldn't help but weep with joy, saying that with the Master present, the King could finally rest easy.</p><p>Whether it was learned from Fat Chicken and White Crane or not, the small demons of Qianshan Bamboo Sea now call Qin Sang "Master."</p><p>"Gather your troops and return to Three-Fold Pass. Once your subordinates are settled, go back personally and secretly tell Willow Demon to order White Crane and the others to set sail together.  They should find a hidden refuge in the Ice Sea as quickly as possible, as far from the mainland as they can."</p><p>Qin Sang issued an order.</p><p>Old Monkey was startled. "Master, is the situation really that dire?"</p><p>This time, the Abyss of Sin not only gained nothing but also lost a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Everyone believed the Abyss of Sin's days were numbered, and the Two Realms Alliance began to gain the upper hand.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly shook his head. "It's hard to say.  It's best to be prepared, to have a retreat plan.  Oh, and remember to inform Li Yu Fu as well."</p><p>He could leave at any time, alone.</p><p>The little demons of Qianshan Bamboo Sea were the most difficult to manage.  Having them find a safe haven in advance would prevent chaos in case of an emergency.</p><p>The matter of founding a sect should also be postponed.</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Old Monkey didn't dare question Qin Sang's judgment and immediately left to carry out his orders.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in the side hall.</p><p>After a while, a fluctuation rippled through the void.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and saw a familiar figure in red appear silently.  Senior Sister Qing Jun had dropped her disguise.</p>
