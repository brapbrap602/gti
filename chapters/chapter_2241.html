<h1>Chapter 2231:  The Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondence</h1><p>“Our journey to Yongtu Immortal City, while a long-term consideration, presents no immediate danger. The descendants of the divine and our human cultivators have opened a new land, and they are currently short-handed. If we offer our services, they surely won't make things difficult for us.”</p><p>Master Tongshen sighed lightly. “Master is indeed worried about the path of cultivation, hence my hesitation, but not for the reason my disciple suggested.”</p><p>Qin Sang listened silently.  He wanted to encourage Master Tongshen to elaborate, hoping to offer some guidance, but felt it inappropriate given his status.</p><p>At this point, Master Tongshen abruptly changed the subject.  “Your senior sister told me you created a new poison pill, killing a golden eagle leader close to achieving human form?”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, cautiously replying, “Master, forgive me. I used several of your spirit herbs without permission, experimenting haphazardly.  Unexpectedly, I managed to create several poison pills with incredibly potent toxicity.”</p><p>Master Tongshen’s face turned stern. “You’re only afraid now? It’s fortunate you were cautious and didn't test it yourself. Do you still have any of these poison pills?”</p><p>Qin Sang hung his head. “They were all used to kill the golden eagles.”</p><p>“Oh?  Tell me about your methodology,” Master Tongshen said, his excitement overriding any inclination to truly scold his disciple.</p><p>Qin Sang, having anticipated this, explained the alchemical process, albeit somewhat vaguely.  Master Tongshen listened intently, nodding repeatedly, marveling at his disciple's talent.  He was able to create such a potent poison pill based solely on the formulas in the *Qinglu Huandan Jue* and his own teachings.  Master Tongshen wondered what else this disciple might create in the future.</p><p>Lost in thought, Master Tongshen hesitated before continuing. “It might as well be revealed to you now. Some time ago, your senior sister Lu, I, and several other cultivators discovered an ancient cultivator's cave. It was filled with complex formations and restrictions. We had planned a methodical exploration, but then this major incident occurred. We were forced to leave the Golden Eagle territory. Though unwilling to abandon our investigation, seizing the last chance, we forcibly entered. I obtained a secret text from within, which is the source of my hesitation.”</p><p>With these words, Master Tongshen produced the text.</p><p>The text was inscribed on three jade tablets, connected by gold thread, which clinked softly as they moved.</p><p>“Disciple, you may examine it, but do not delve too deeply. I shall share my understanding with you after I've studied it thoroughly.”</p><p>Qin Sang respectfully accepted it, scanning it with his spiritual sense. Mysterious passages appeared before his eyes.</p><p>“The Water and Fire Harmony Chapter of the *Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondence*…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, reading the first line aloud.</p><p>Master Tongshen explained, “The *Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondence* is undoubtedly a remarkable classic. The author's identity remains unknown. The Water and Fire Harmony Chapter might be a fragment of this classic, or perhaps not even a fragment, but rather a later work inspired by the *Great Treatise*…”</p><p>Master Tongshen's voice reached his ears, while the words on the jade tablets flowed into Qin Sang's heart, each character seeming to contain the profound principles of the Dao.</p><p>He displayed a suitable level of bewilderment on his face, while his mind was profoundly stirred by the text's contents.</p><p>As the name suggests, the *Great Treatise on Yin and Yang Correspondence* should expound on the great Dao of Yin and Yang. The Dao of Yin and Yang encompasses all things in the universe, nothing cannot be interpreted through Yin and Yang, and conversely, there are countless ways to interpret the Dao of Yin and Yang.</p><p>Water and fire, one Yin, one Yang.</p><p>The Water and Fire Harmony Chapter does not merely discuss the Five Elements, but uses water and fire to expound on Yin and Yang, recording a secret technique of cultivating both simultaneously.</p><p>Having recently gained insights into Yin and Yang in the Sun-Moon Hall, Qin Sang immediately recognized the text’s validity, realizing it mainly elucidated the principle of Yin and Yang clashing.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s understanding, the Dao of Yin and Yang involves opposition, clashing, and even mutual transformation.</p><p>The opposition of Yin and Yang is easily understood. The Water and Fire Harmony Chapter focused on the principle of Yin and Yang clashing.</p><p>As the saying goes, "All things have Yin and embrace Yang; Qi clashes to create harmony." The 'clash' here refers to the 'clash' of emptiness, 'The Dao clashes and is used, yet is not full.' Qi clashes to create 'harmony,' thus harmonizing all things, ensuring constant circulation.</p><p>This is the harmony of water and fire.</p><p>The text states that by cultivating this technique, water and fire, far from clashing, will complement each other, resulting in profoundly superior true essence compared to one's peers. Furthermore, when engaging in magical combat, regardless of which water or fire technique is used, its power will be amplified.</p><p>“Finished?”</p><p>Reaching the end, Qin Sang discovered an abrupt break in the text, leaving him frustrated.</p><p>He wasn't considering switching to Yin and Yang cultivation, but a deeper understanding of Yin and Yang would enhance his lightning magic, potentially even amplifying its power using the black and white pieces.</p><p>The text captivated him, yet Qin Sang still felt unsatisfied, as it did not discuss the mutual transformation of Yin and Yang.</p><p>The transformation of Yin and Yang shouldn't be described as water and fire complementing each other, but rather water and fire generating each other.  That's true continuous generation!</p><p>"Too bad! Too bad!"</p><p>Qin Sang lamented, understanding he shouldn't be greedy.  Finding this text within the illusion was an unexpected boon.</p><p>The "Water and Fire Harmony" section of the *Yin Yang Correspondence Treatise* provided him with a brilliant direction for comprehending the Dao of Yin and Yang. Following this path, Qin Sang might achieve significant progress.</p><p>Whether he should continue down this road remains questionable.</p><p>Anyone can see that the Dao of Yin and Yang is a Grand Dao with limitless potential; otherwise, the Daoist sect wouldn't place such importance on it, even considering it fundamental.</p><p>However, Qin Sang already achieved success in the Great Perfection Killing Dao, with a bright future ahead, and wouldn't easily switch paths.</p><p>Currently, Qin Sang cultivates the *Clear Dew Returning Elixir Scripture*, supplemented by the "Water and Fire Harmony" section. With his understanding of the Dao of Yin and Yang, he wouldn't even encounter the initial obstacles mentioned in the text; his cultivation would rapidly advance, and his combat prowess would far surpass his peers.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and he suddenly sat cross-legged.</p><p>"Disciple..."</p><p>Master Tong Shen was startled, seeing Qin Sang already in meditative trance, he swallowed the words on his lips, filled with surprise and doubt.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>A faint sound of flowing water suddenly emanated from Qin Sang's body, like a clear spring flowing within him.</p><p>Master Tong Shen knew Qin Sang was circulating the *Clear Dew Returning Elixir Scripture*.</p><p>But unlike before, after several cycles of the cultivation method, the sound of the spring became increasingly muffled, almost inaudible, as if encountering an obstruction.</p><p>'Thump! Thump! Thump!'</p><p>Moments later, the sound of the spring transformed into a heartbeat-like rhythm, like thunder drums. Qin Sang seemed to be continuously impacting the obstruction, attempting to force a path.</p><p>This was futile; Qin Sang's expression became increasingly pained.</p><p>Master Tong Shen watched with concern, about to forcefully awaken Qin Sang, when he suddenly realized something and lightly tapped his foot.</p><p>The entire mountain peak trembled imperceptibly.</p><p>Unseen changes were occurring deep within the mountain.</p><p>An underground vein of fire was stirred by an unseen force, and a wisp of fiery energy rapidly ascended, piercing the mountain and reaching beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon contact, this wisp of fiery energy was immediately absorbed by Qin Sang.  Then, with a 'boom', the obstruction seemed to be washed away by a current, Qin Sang's expression eased, and his breath began to undergo a strange transformation.</p><p>Master Tong Shen looked at Qin Sang, then at the jade tablet in his hand, his face filled with astonishment and disbelief.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang let out a muffled groan, his body spasmed, and that aura abruptly dissipated, causing his internal spiritual energy to become chaotic.</p><p>Master Tong Shen reacted swiftly, instantly appearing behind Qin Sang, his finger pressing against his Baihui acupoint, he shouted, "Calm your mind!"</p><p>With his master's help, Qin Sang finally stabilized his internal spiritual energy and slowly awoke.</p><p>"You succeeded?" Master Tong Shen eagerly asked.</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked bewildered.</p><p>"You've cultivated this 'Water and Fire Harmony' section?" Master Tong Shen pointed to the jade tablet, still unable to believe it.</p><p>"Disciple doesn't know. I simply saw the content, felt touched, and wanted to try," Qin Sang timidly said, "I worried Master, I know I was wrong."</p><p>"You... you really need to change this habit."</p><p>Master Tong Shen remembered that in Fengcheng, Qin Sang had dared to forcefully cultivate the technique he had given him, nearly causing an accident.  That technique was, of course, incomparable to the "Water and Fire Harmony" section, but given the precedent, Qin Sang's actions weren't entirely unexpected.</p><p>Master Tong Shen carefully observed his disciple, saying, "Tell your master, what did you see in there?"</p><p>Qin Sang carefully chose his words, relaying what he saw according to his own understanding.</p><p>Much of it was childishly naive, yet Master Tong Shen, upon careful consideration, found it increasingly intriguing.</p><p>One thing was certain: the "Water and Fire Harmony" section wasn't entirely baseless.</p><p>"Master, did I say something wrong?" Qin Sang asked softly, seeing Master Tong Shen remained silent.</p><p>Master Tong Shen cleared his throat, scolding, "Don't be so reckless in the future. If your master hadn't been here today, the consequences would have been unthinkable.  As for this section, you mustn't attempt it again without my permission, understand?"</p><p>"Disciple obeys."</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "Master, this is just one section of the *Yin Yang Correspondence Treatise*. How profound must the complete treatise be? I wonder which senior created it."</p><p>"Indeed!" Master Tong Shen nodded, lamenting, "Unfortunately, I only found this section in the cave, with no other clues. That cave has now been exposed, and the Golden Eagle Tribe's experts have likely ransacked it."</p><p>He raised his hand, the jade pendant in his grasp jingling.  "The complete *Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun* might be recorded on jade pendants like this, scattered and lost to time!"</p><p>Learning that the cave abode had been seized by the Golden Eagle Tribe, Qin Sang felt a pang of disappointment. He lacked the strength to confront them, so he made a mental note of this lead, resolving to seek it out later.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, at dawn.</p><p>The cultivators assembled outside the mountains, preparing to depart for Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>A Zhou surname cultivator summoned a flying vessel.</p><p>The journey was long, and many wondered if they would ever return.  A wave of sadness washed over them as they cast longing glances at their homeland.</p><p>Miss Shuang’s face betrayed no sorrow; she had resumed her usual cold demeanor. Only when she looked at Qin Sang did her expression soften.</p><p>"Miss Shuang seems quite smitten with you," Qing Hong whispered, nudging Qin Sang.</p><p>"Unfortunately, my heart belongs to another," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>Qing Hong was thrilled.</p><p>Qin Sang gave her a knowing look, then turned and boarded the flying vessel.</p><p>Qing Hong stood there, dumbfounded. "No, no! I'm your senior sister! How can this be? My junior sister will be heartbroken…"</p><p>The girl, clearly bluffing, avoided him for the next few days, much to Qin Sang's relief.</p><p>All the cultivators boarded the vessel and soared into the sky, heading west.</p><p>The vessel was piloted in shifts by Master Tongshen and others. Qin Sang and the others continued their cultivation aboard, though refining pills proved less convenient.</p><p>That night, the vessel landed in a mountain valley. Late at night, two more vessels converged from other directions, carrying cultivators fleeing the Golden Eagle Tribe's territory.</p><p>After joining forces, the three vessels continued westward. They occasionally encountered other escaping cultivators, steadily increasing their numbers.</p><p>Their most feared pursuers, the demon beasts, never appeared. They did face other dangers, including encounters with bandits, but the many skilled cultivators among them managed to overcome every peril.</p><p>Years passed.  Weathered and worn, the cultivators drew closer to the rumored Yongtu Immortal City.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>A fierce wind whipped up a sandstorm, obscuring the sky in a yellowish haze.</p><p>From the vessel, the cultivators gazed at the landscape below. Though not a desert, it was an utterly barren wasteland, even more desolate than the area around Lingkong Mountain.</p><p>The sight filled them with sorrow and anger. Had even the great human cultivators been driven to such a desolate place, forced to carve out a meager existence here?  Legend spoke of the fertile lands and abundant resources in the territories of the great clans, yet the human race could not even claim a place as good as Lingkong Mountain.</p><p>"Someone's approaching!"</p><p>The Zhou surname elder, piloting the vessel, sensed approaching presences and transmitted his warning.</p><p>Various vessels immediately formed a defensive formation in the air, their weapons at the ready, pointing towards the newcomers.</p><p>"I am an envoy from Yongtu Immortal City.  Fellow Daoists, have you fled to our city to escape the oppression of the other races?"</p><p>A deep voice boomed across the wind and sand.</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>The Zhou surname elder replied loudly, "We are all homeless, seeking refuge within your city's walls. We would be grateful for your compassion."</p><p>"Certainly! Certainly!"</p><p>The envoy was very accommodating, already approaching as he spoke.</p><p>The cultivators on the vessels remained vigilant, staring intently. A golden light appeared in the forefront, revealing a human cultivator in golden armor.</p><p>The envoy smiled, bowing from afar.  "Yongtu Immortal City was built specifically for you.  There is ample space within the city's walls."</p><p>He paused, then declared loudly, "From this day forward, you will no longer need to endure the scorn of those other races!"</p><p>His words resonated deeply. Moved by his words and recalling their past suffering, some among them wept openly.</p><p>The envoy guided the vessels towards the city's outskirts.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Master Tongshen and the Zhou surname elder, gazing at the Immortal City.</p><p>The so-called "city" had no walls, but instead was a vast, extraordinary spirit formation that encompassed mountains and plains.</p><p>People thronged the streets, not just humans but also many strange-looking beings.</p><p>Seeing these bizarre yet familiar figures, Qin Sang thought to himself, "Finally, I've found the Heterogeneous Races!"</p><p>Walking side-by-side with the envoy, the Zhou surname elder praised the magnificent city and asked, "Are there powerful cultivators stationed within the city?"</p>
