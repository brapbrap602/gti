      After gaining the compression technology, both the depth and
                breadth of a Mechanic’s combat abilities would drastically
                increase. They would gain the ability to take control of the
                situation or even turn the tables immediately. The focus was to
                deploy the machinery as fast as possible and the right
                combination of machinery at the right place. The speed of
                deploying that machinery would have a very large impact on the
                outcome of the battle.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After the version of Mechanics rising, the method that other
                Supers used was mostly striking and charging before the Mechanic
                could deploy their machinery fully. If a Mechanic was allowed to
                deploy their weapons freely, the situation would be
                irreversible, and the enemy would slide down the abyss of
                failure. Of course, this was in the case of normal situations,
                not considering some special abilities or items.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the case of battle tempo, Mechanics always had the upper
                hand. The enemies were forced to follow it and stop Mechanics
                from deploying their machinery. This was a very big advantage.
                Furthermore, even if the Mechanic’s tempo was broken temporarily
                and they did not have the time to deploy the machinery fully,
                the enemies could not let their guard down. If the Mechanic
                caught their breath and deployed the machinery afterward, the
                tables would turn in an instant, and the enemies’ effort before
                would all go to waste.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s Mechanic class was now beginning to take shape and
                possessed this tough ability. He was also very experienced, so
                it was impossible for his speed of deploying the machinery to be
                slow. This time, cannons and fire covered the entire place, so
                the Sunil mercenaries inevitably fell one after another. This
                was just a spar, so the Sunil mercenaries who fell onto the
                ground were dragged off the battlefield by Herlous, who stood on
                the side. Ever since the battle started, he had been kept busy
                by doing this continuously. He had never been given a chance to
                even rest.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      A Pugilist mercenary flexed his legs, then jumped up into the
                air, drawing a parabola in the air, wanting to jump over the
                floor filled with traps and reach Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this time, a metal trap that he jumped over was suddenly
                triggered. A grenade shot up into the air and exploded with a
                bang. A blue, net-shaped current extended out from the center of
                the explosion. This was a capturing trap formed by long, thin
                metal cables with a high voltage running through it. It shrouded
                the Pugilist mercenary who was still in midair.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Buzz!
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This guy screamed in agony as his skin was burnt black by the
                current, then he fell down to another repulsion trap. An
                invisible force pushed this guy up into the air again, and a few
                artilleries turned toward him and focus fired. The bullets
                pushed him out of the area.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He fell to the ground, unconscious.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This stopped the other mercenaries from wanting to jump up.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It’s not so easy to jump across all that.” Han Xiao smiled.
                There were landmines in the traps, and there were also traps
                that could sense objects above them and attack accordingly to
                prevent enemies from getting close in midair.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Within the range of his Mechanical Force, any machinery received
                bonuses from him. Some artillery was placed beside him, and its
                power was enhanced multiple times. Whoever was at the front
                would face the most violent and heaviest attacks. Because of
                this, the mercenaries spread out and charged from all
                directions, diverting the firepower from the artillery.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Lerden was covered in a green shield that was flickering under
                the rain of bullets as he charged forward. In other directions,
                there was quite a number of mercenaries who were equipped with
                shield generators. The colorful shields charged through the
                cannons and traps, approaching quickly.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao formed a hook with his fingers. Another batch of
                compressed orbs flew out and dropped beside him, expanding into
                twenty or so beast shaped robots. Their size was about the same
                as medium-sized dog breeds, but they were covered in black armor
                and had a streamlined body like cheetahs, like armored panthers.
                There was an opening on both of their shoulders, exposing the
                triple mounted gun barrels from the machine guns inside. Their
                tails were very swift and looked like a scorpion tail, at the
                end of which was a sharp alloy blade.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had prepared three combos. One was the Multi-Turret
                Firepower Coverage Style, which did not require any
                technicality. Another was the Trap Style, which required a
                little bit of control, mainly regarding where to place which
                traps and whether these traps could protect him and limit the
                enemies’ movement. The last was the Hound Style.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Hound Style was controlling a group of small mechanic
                beasts, entangling, harassing, and culling the enemies like
                hounds. As the basic machinery that formed this style was called
                Mechanical Hounds, hence the name. This blueprint was rather
                easy to obtain. Han Xiao was using an enhanced version of
                mechanical beasts.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [‘Black Panther’ Combat Mechanic Beast] was a new blueprint that
                he had created after combining numerous low-level mechanical
                beast blueprints. One ‘Black Panther” had 2,700 points of armor,
                and the basic mechanical hound only had 1,500. Its attack was
                also increased by around seventy percent. It had more functions
                and better performance. Of course, it possessed the essential
                self-destruction ability.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Go,” Han Xiao said. The twenty or so mechanical Black Panthers
                dashed out extremely quickly as the barrels on their shoulders
                opened fire. They swiftly moved across the battlefield between
                the gaps of the traps, attacking from the rear and the sides of
                the enemies. These were the weak points of their defense, and
                their speed was immediately slowed down.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As soon as any mercenary got close to the mechanical Black
                Panther, it would jump away, always keeping its distance and
                only going closer to the enemy when attacking.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Sometimes, three or four mechanic Black Panthers would cooperate
                with each other, diverting the enemies’ attention from different
                directions while one of them attacked from the back, slashing
                with its tail and dealing quite an amount of damage.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Mechanical Black Panthers were equipped with smart chips, and
                four of them formed a group. They could only carry out some
                simple tactical strategies in fours. Han Xiao’s ability to build
                chips was still at the basic level, so the mechanic Black
                Panthers’ combat ability was not independent enough. The number
                of orders that they could recognize and carry out was limited,
                so they could only be used to harass.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With the combination of artilleries, traps, and mechanical
                beasts, it was as if the Sunil mercenaries were walking in a
                quagmire; every step forward was difficult. Han Xiao observed
                the effect and nodded.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “This combination is not afraid of being outnumbered and can
                easily crush Supers that are weaker than me. Even when used
                against Supers of the same grade, it can also restrain and
                harass… Of course, it will be heavily damaged as well.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Bang!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As he was thinking, a mechanical Black Panther was blown away
                and smashed into an artillery, bending its barrels.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao looked over. Finally, someone passed through the
                lockdown. Lerden was covered in a green light. Having finally
                arrived before Han Xiao, he growled, and the green light turned
                into a spear in his hands, which he strongly thrust forward!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Clank!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the blink of an eye, the compressed orb on Han Xiao’s
                necklace expanded, and a white mechanical suit covered him
                instantly!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The spear stabbed at his chest but was unable to move even an
                inch forward through the bone-white mechanical suit. Without
                saying anything, Han Xiao raised his hand and slapped down.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Boom!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Lerden was smashed onto the floor by the slap, facing downward.
                His face was planted into the ground instantly, no match for Han
                Xiao at all.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The people’s faces changed. Han Xiao’s appearance had changed—he
                was in a white combat suit, the armor texture looked like bones,
                yet it was unbelievably strong and hard. It looked like a
                knight’s armor made of bone.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Its shape was gorgeous. The shoulders were carved to look like
                dragon heads, and the chest and the waist pieces were had
                highly-flexible joints to allow swifter movement, complementing
                the streamlined body shape. Not knowing if it was an illusion,
                the people present felt that this mechanical suit was giving out
                a very mysterious aura.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [Void Dragon] Single Unit Mechanical Suit.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Compared to the snake series mechanical suits such as Python and
                Amphiptere, this dragon series mechanical suit had stronger
                capabilities. It was not because it involved more advanced
                technologies but because its material was rare. It was made from
                the Void Dragon Bone that he had obtained on Floating Dragon
                Island. It was light yet durable, and it had special energy
                within. This mechanical suit did not have that many weapons; it
                was used specifically for hand to hand combat. Its armor was a
                horrifying amount of more than 30,000 points. Furthermore, the
                Void Dragon Bone granted the mechanical suit extra abilities.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had three compressed orbs on his necklace, and all of
                them were mechanical suits. One was Void Dragon, and the other
                two were the backup Amphipteres. Whether a Mechanic was strong
                or not depended on the number and attributes of their equipment.
                He had both the number and the attributes, and that was because
                he had enough money.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Seeing this, the other mercenaries stopped moving forward and
                said with a bitter smile, “We admit our loss.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The difference in strength was too vast. They had battled
                through all the obstacles and finally gotten close only to
                realize that Han Xiao himself was stronger than all his
                machinery. It was a completely impossible battle to win. There
                were around a hundred of them, so originally, they had thought
                that Han Xiao was outnumbered, but now, they felt that they were
                the ones that were outnumbered.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They clearly surrounded Han Xiao, yet it felt like Han Xiao
                surrounded all of them by himself.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had yet to finish testing all his weapons, so there was
                still a huge cannon that he did not deploy. He wanted to
                continue, but seeing that the mercenaries had given up, he could
                only collect all his machinery, disappointed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After cleaning up the battlefield, these Sunil mercenaries
                gathered in front of Han Xiao. They were only lightly injured.
                Their eyes were now filled with respect and fear.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The strong is always respected.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao said a few words, mostly saying that they had passed
                his test and that their ability was not bad. Then he got rid of
                the Sunils and told them to start doing their missions.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao returned to the stronghold alone and went to the
                machinery modification room. He pondered and concluded his
                experience.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “According to the current effect, the strategy that I planned is
                now mostly ready. My level 95 class advancement requirement is
                rather difficult, so I might be stuck at this level for quite
                some time. This combination of styles is very strong at the
                current stage, so it can be used as a filler before class
                advancement. Plus, there are many ways to enhance it…”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He took out the weapons that he had recently built and observed
                the item attributes on the interface once again.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The variety of artilleries and traps was very rich—mostly made
                out of new blueprints that he had obtained from combining
                several blueprints—and their various performances were all 25% –
                40% better in comparison.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He looked at Void Dragon’s data. Amphiptere was a very
                well-rounded mechanical suit, so he did not build another one of
                the same style. Void Dragon was focused on melee battles. As its
                material was rare, it had very strong additional abilities.
