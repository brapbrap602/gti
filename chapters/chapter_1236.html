<h1>Chapter 1228: Legacy</h1><p>Chapter 1228: Legacy</p><p>Arriving at a clearing, Qin Sang focused his spiritual sense, diligently sensing its changes.  During the process of subduing the spirit flames, he felt each flame merging with a strand of his spiritual sense, like a tiny flame-like extension of himself, refining and strengthening each strand.</p><p>He had never directly clashed spiritually with another Nascent Soul cultivator, so he wasn't sure of his spiritual sense's precise strength, but it was definitely superior to his peers.</p><p>"This year and more of hard cultivation wasn't in vain. My spiritual sense has improved significantly. Once the Fire Lotus Seed sprouts and I truly enter the second stage, my spiritual sense will also make a leap. Mou Laomo probably wouldn't refine the Dongming Cold Flame completely; a raw refinement should help him break through to the second stage. His spiritual sense would then be at least as strong as the Demon Lord and the others, perhaps even surpassing them. This would allow him to escape the siege by both righteous and demonic cultivators, and later even fake his death on Yitian Peak, deceiving everyone’s perception."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang withdrew his spiritual sense, gesturing to summon his eighteen demonic banners.  This was the crucial part.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>Twelve demonic banners flew straight into the air, forming a formation and releasing demonic flames. Qin Sang could already control twelve banners.  Without pausing, he sent the Fire Lotus Seed from his forehead into the center of the formation, merging with the demonic flames. Then, he raised three more banners.</p><p>The three banners merged into the array, stabilizing quickly. Nine Nether Demonic Flames flew out, swirling around the Fire Lotus Seed, unusually docile.</p><p>Delighted, Qin Sang controlled fifteen banners simultaneously without feeling overwhelmed.  He immediately and without hesitation launched the remaining three banners upward.</p><p>The last banner, however, contained demonic flames that Qin Sang had partially refined. It was no longer compatible with the formation; forcing it in would cause imbalance, doing more harm than good.  The other banners made way for these three to join.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as the formation was completed, something unexpected happened. All eighteen demonic banners began to tremble. The banner surfaces flapped wildly, making a rustling sound. The poles shook, some even tilting. The Nine Nether Demonic Flames surged wildly, disrupting the surrounding spiritual energy.  Streams of demonic fire collided, threatening to break free from the formation and escape control.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  He exerted all his strength, his fingers flying as countless restrictions descended like a shower of flowers into the array. Gritting his teeth, he desperately stabilized the banners, barely calming the chaos.  They would need further refinement before he could use them freely.</p><p>The banners and demonic flames eventually stabilized. The eighteen demonic banners stood in the void, forming a circle above Qin Sang's head. In the center of the formation, with the Fire Lotus Seed at its core, the Nine Nether Demonic Flames formed a black dragon of fire, majestic and terrifyingly powerful!</p><p>Qin Sang directed the flames with his spiritual sense, and the fiery dragon charged towards the mountain peak to the left.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The pristine white snow instantly melted.  Dust and smoke billowed, the earth shook, and the mountain peak collapsed.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He exclaimed his approval, laughing several times before collecting the banners and returning to Sandie Pass to continue his secluded cultivation.</p><p>…</p><p>Sandie Pass became a training ground for the many demons of Qianshan Bamboo Sea and people like Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Qin Sang had already revealed his identity and had transferred Mei Gu and other Demonic Flame Sect disciples from Shiqu Mountain.</p><p>Mei Gu was stunned for a moment when she learned that her master was actually a Demon King.</p><p>However, Xiao Han Domain had always been a place where humans and demons coexisted, bound by an ancient pact. The hatred and estrangement between the two races were not as great as in the Canglang Sea, making it easier to accept.</p><p>Mei Gu was initially nervous, but after seeing that her master had other human disciples under him and treated both races equally, generously offering guidance and demonstrating deep understanding of human cultivation methods, she felt reassured.</p><p>However, Mei Gu had some doubts.  When her master appeared, he was clearly in human form. Was he a transformed Demon King at that time? Or was his bloodline special, not requiring transformation?</p><p>These questions, she was destined not to understand.</p><p>As for the other Demonic Flame Sect disciples, having been suppressed by other powerful forces for too long, they were overjoyed to have a powerful backer. They didn't care whether he was a Nascent Soul cultivator or a Demon King.</p><p>With this, Qin Sang's forces were basically integrated.  All he needed was to find a blessed land to establish a sect and found the Qingyang Sect!</p><p>First, the Qianshan Bamboo Sea lineage. He would select a few demon cultivators to pass down the "Celestial Demon Transformation Technique," fostering mutual support with the human descendants.</p><p>Second, the Yunyouzi lineage, including his cultivation techniques and alchemy, would be carried forward by Li Yu Fu.</p><p>Third, the Demonic Flame Sect lineage, headed by Mei Gu, would inherit the "Seven Yang Scripture." This scripture was carefully selected by Jiu Pao Daoist and is a remarkable legacy.</p><p>Regarding Qin Sang himself, most of the cultivation techniques and secret arts he practices are unsuitable for others. At most, he can only leave behind some of his cultivation insights and previously obtained techniques, such as "The All-Heaven Demon Sound" and others.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang has always had an idea to develop a lineage of sword cultivators at Qingyang Temple, inheriting the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture," as a continuation of Elder Qingzhu's legacy.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu dedicated his life to the sword path, pouring his life's blood into forging the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture."  It doesn't necessarily require the cultivation of the "Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Yuan Shen," as any sword cultivator with sufficient talent can comprehend it. Qin Sang is merely borrowing it; in his hands, it would be a waste.</p><p>He asked his senior sister for her opinion.</p><p>His senior sister didn't mind, "You are the one he chose as his successor. I won't interfere; you have full authority."</p><p>Bai Hanqiu is not suitable, lacking the talent; someone else needs to be found.</p><p>Xiaohan Domain is not like Canglang Sea.  The top-tier famous mountains and rivers are mostly claimed. Careful planning will be necessary. However, it is now a time of upheaval; destruction precedes creation. With his strength, opportunities will surely arise.</p><p>Once Qingyang Temple is established, half of the Wandering Scholar's wishes will be fulfilled.</p><p>"Is this arrangement satisfactory, Senior?"</p><p>Qin Sang held the charred wood left by the Wandering Scholar, murmuring.</p><p>After forming his Nascent Soul, he can vaguely sense the weak spiritual essence within the wood; it won't decay for a while.</p><p>The situation is unclear; he dares not refine the wood for now, lest he cannot use the Ebony Sword and something unexpected happens. He must carefully consider every step before acting.</p><p>Involving the last trace of the Wandering Scholar's spiritual essence, the refinement process cannot be as crude as before. No mistakes can be tolerated; excessive caution is necessary.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Bing Han's invitation.  He needs to continue refining the demonic fire and familiarize himself with the Eighteen Demonic Banners to prepare for entering Blood Lake. After returning from Blood Lake, he will borrow some books from the Xu Ling Sect and then make plans.</p><p>The charred wood is silent; it cannot answer his questions.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, a hint of melancholy flashing in his eyes, and put away the wood.</p><p>News frequently comes from Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>But the opening of Blood Lake remains undecided.</p><p>The war on Tianxing Plateau never ceases, but the momentum of the Abyss of Sin has weakened considerably, no longer as aggressive as before. It's likely related to Ye Lao Mo's scheme concerning Blood Lake.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang, immersed in cultivation, received a message from his senior sister.</p><p>Upon hearing the news, Qin Sang was delighted. His senior sister had finally comprehended the formation diagram of the Demon-Binding Rope and sent a message asking Qin Sang to go to Shiqu Mountain to offer suggestions.</p>
