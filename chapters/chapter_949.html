<h1>Chapter 941: The Demonic Restriction Array</h1><p>Chapter 941: The Demonic Restriction Array</p><p>“Friend Daoist, can’t you see?  Each additional banner increases the demands on the wielder exponentially.”</p><p>Qin Sang, far from being elated by his creation, calmly stated, “Limited by my cultivation and spiritual sense, even if I were given a true top-tier treasure, I couldn't unleash its full power. These banner arrays are even more demanding. At my current level, simultaneously controlling six or seven is about my limit. That's hardly enough to contend with a Yuan Ying master!  To fully utilize the power of all eighteen demonic banners… I have a long way to go.”</p><p>He had carefully calculated everything.</p><p>The number of demonic banners wasn't simply a case of the more, the merrier.  One must act within one's capabilities, maintaining control during combat to achieve true effectiveness.</p><p>Of course, even controlling only six demonic banners simultaneously would unleash terrifying power, comparable to a top-grade magical treasure – a treasure other cultivators at the Core Formation stage could only dream of.</p><p>Bai said nothing more, resting briefly before returning to the ghost mist to gather more souls.</p><p>The demonic banners continued to take shape.</p><p>Bai, gritting his teeth, toiled tirelessly, finally helping Qin Sang forge fifteen demonic banners.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>With Qin Sang's true energy, the last banner vibrated, emitting a rustling sound.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang gestured.</p><p>The three original Ten Directions Yama Banners flew out from his sleeve, followed by the fifteen new demonic banners, all circling the originals.  The rudimentary form of a demonic banner array became apparent.</p><p>Even Qin Sang, known for his composure, couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. This would likely be his most powerful treasure for a long time to come. After achieving the Yuan Ying stage, he would be able to surpass his peers with this treasure.</p><p>After all, only a very small number of Yuan Ying masters possess top-tier magical treasures.</p><p>“Congratulations, Friend Daoist, on forging this powerful treasure.”</p><p>Bai offered his congratulations, his own joy evident. The cage and obsession that had plagued him for countless years were finally nearing resolution.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. “Friend Daoist, you can now lead me to collect the demonic fire. I hope the weakness in the demonic restriction you mentioned can be exploited, and we avoid any unexpected issues.”</p><p>“Rest assured,” Bai said confidently. “I’ve been constantly thinking about breaking free. There’s no way I’d make a mistake now. Come with me…”</p><p>Before he finished, Bai released the gathered souls, flashing into the ghost mist.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his avatar and phoenix wings, keeping only his two-headed… close at hand, and pursued Bai deep into the ghost land. Shortly, they saw Bai stop ahead.</p><p>Their current location was precisely where Bai had previously hidden the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>The area had recently witnessed a fierce battle.  Most of the surrounding bone mountains had collapsed, leaving behind a chaotic landscape of ravines, scattered bones, and wandering souls.</p><p>This gave Qin Sang his first good look at the place.</p><p>His gaze swept across the scene, finding nothing unusual until it settled on the bone mountain Bai had breached. He suspected something lay hidden beneath.</p><p>Even the Sky-Eye Butterfly couldn’t detect any hidden secrets here, likely due to the demonic restriction and the conversion array.</p><p>“Scatter!”</p><p>Bai bellowed, his corpse qi surging, unleashing an unusual wave of energy.</p><p>The surrounding souls, as if encountering a natural enemy, let out terrified screams and fled, leaving a void around them.</p><p>Bai then darted toward the mangled bone mountain, striking it with beams of light to create a passage leading to its base.</p><p>Qin Sang went to the entrance of the passage, using his spiritual sense to check for danger before entering.</p><p>Walking through the passage of pale bones, Qin Sang's heart stirred. He gazed at Bai's back, lost in thought.</p><p>He wondered about Bai and his companions, and what they had endured to meet such a tragic end.</p><p>The vast ghost land was filled with mountains of bones and countless souls. If they had all once been cultivators, it was impossible to imagine the scale of the battle.</p><p>The Seven Slaughter Hall Seal.</p><p>The cultivation world was now fragmented, ravaged by storms everywhere.</p><p>What was the connection to that great war?</p><p>Unfortunately, Bai had lost his memory; otherwise, Qin Sang could have gained insight into ancient secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, silently following Bai to the base of the bone mountain. The black ground was strangely colored—a dried, blood-soaked hue, starkly contrasting with the white bones.</p><p>The ground seemed empty until Bai gestured, and a flash of light revealed a staircase leading down to what appeared to be a sizeable cavern.</p><p>Following Bai inside, Qin Sang's eyes widened at the sight.</p><p>The cavern was quite spacious but low-ceilinged, barely allowing Qin Sang to stand upright.</p><p>In the center of the underground cavern was an ancient altar.  The stone pillars were weathered and worn, seemingly silent and decaying for countless years, much like the surrounding bones.</p><p>Next to the altar sat a stone coffin, its lid ajar, but empty.  The altar and the coffin were the only things in the cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the altar.  Even with his expertise in spirit formations and restrictions, he couldn't discern its purpose. He could only guess that it might be the eye of the Soul-Calming Array.</p><p>As Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the coffin, Bai let out a wry smile.  "This was where I slept. If not for your unexpected arrival, this would have been my final resting place. My original form left this coffin behind, perhaps sensing that I would never see the light of day again."</p><p>"To endure such endless loneliness, confined here... it's beyond the capacity of ordinary mortals," Qin Sang remarked.</p><p>"I've grown accustomed to it; I've even forgotten the passage of time," Bai said with a carefree laugh. Then, pointing at the altar, he continued, "Your first priority is to collect the demonic fire within the demonic restrictions surrounding the altar. That's the most crucial and accessible area. Once that demonic restriction is broken, the rest will be much easier.  By breaking these key restrictions, we can then activate the ghost mist and the array to forcefully break through…"</p><p>"Wait…"</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted. "The moment we break the restriction, there will surely be a massive disturbance. We have nowhere to hide in this ghost land, and we'll be affected too. Where will we hide, and how will we avoid being detected by the person outside?"</p><p>Bai confidently replied, "Don't worry. Before breaking the restriction, I'll subtly guide a portion of the force to directly impact the entrance.  Besides, there's a place here unaffected by the aftershocks. We just need to wait for the impact to weaken and then leave immediately. I'll use the remaining ghost mist to help us hide.  The person outside will be caught off guard by the sudden impact. Even if they aren't severely injured, they won't be able to attend to anything else, giving us the perfect opportunity to escape…"</p><p>"Your plan is quite thorough! In that case, I also have a treasure that might help. That person is a top-tier expert after all; we need additional concealment methods to be safe…"</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then retrieved a red cloth from his storage ring – the Hong Yuan Sha, an ancient treasure obtained from the young man surnamed Fang.</p>
