<h1>    sympathy either. He quickly put away his melancholy and smiled, "A moment of nostalgia, I've made you laugh, Brother</h1><p>    Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>"Senior's unwavering Dao Heart is admirable."</p><p>Wanderer chuckled,</p><p>    then suddenly declared with heroic spirit, "The Dao is merciless! We cultivators must possess the unyielding spirit</p><p>    of never giving up. Otherwise, with so many talented individuals in the world, how many achieve Gold Core? Why</p><p>    should it be you or me? Only with this spirit can we face the heavens without shame and face the earth without</p><p>    guilt. Even if we die on the path, we can still smile on our way to the Yellow Springs."</p><p>(The original</p><p>    sentence is from Mencius: I face the heavens without shame and face the earth without guilt.)</p><p>He tilted his</p><p>    head slightly, his eyes bright. Though deep underground, his gaze seemed to pierce through the ancient ruins and fix</p><p>    upon the blue sky.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, recalling the past forty years. His journey to this point wasn't</p><p>    exactly as Wanderer said, seizing every opportunity and never giving up?</p><p>Just four words.</p><p>Never forget</p><p>    your original aspiration!</p><p>"Brother Qin, I'm not being alarmist. The two words 'Gold Core': 'Gold' represents</p><p>    an enduring, indestructible substance; 'Core' represents completeness, purity, and flawlessness. Brother Qin, your</p><p>    Qi Sea is injured, and I fear it may hinder your path to completeness. You should seek healing as soon as possible.</p><p>    Otherwise, if you wait until the Pseudo Core Realm to treat your injuries, time will be against you, and you will</p><p>    regret it."</p><p>Wanderer withdrew his gaze and offered this advice.</p><p>Qin Sang asked with a serious tone,</p><p>    "Senior, are there any examples of this?"</p><p>He had researched ancient texts at Shaohua Mountain but found that</p><p>    everyone's cultivation journey is unique. It's hard to determine the impact of his damaged foundation on forming a</p><p>    Gold Core.</p><p>Twenty years of practice has confirmed the feasibility of the "Spirit Refinement Sword Scripture,"</p><p>    which might be his most suitable cultivation method.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happens, he's confident in reaching</p><p>    the Pseudo Core Realm and attempting to form a Gold Core before his lifespan runs out. Even without Wanderer's</p><p>    reminder, Qin Sang knew he must start considering Core Formation now.</p><p>Prepare for the unexpected.</p><p></p><p>    Wanderer slowly shook his head and said, "It's hard to say. The path of cultivation is like thousands of soldiers</p><p>    crossing a single-plank bridge, vying for a sliver of life. Fewer than one in ten Pseudo Core cultivators succeed in</p><p>    forming a Gold Core. Failure is common, making it difficult to determine the exact impact of a Qi Sea injury.</p><p>    However, every cultivator seeking the Gold Core will move heaven and earth, sparing no effort to improve their odds</p><p>    of success, even by a fraction. They would never miss a chance. Especially in our situation, we must find ways to</p><p>    compensate and strive for complete recovery."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then said, "To be honest, Senior, I've also</p><p>    been inquiring about healing methods. I've learned about the Harmony Pill, Five Mushroom Divine Paste, and Snow</p><p>    Ginseng Jade Life Pill. These might be effective for my injuries. They were all auctioned at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion</p><p>    by your sect. Do you know anything about them?"</p><p>"These..."</p><p>Wanderer glanced at Qin Sang. "The pills you</p><p>    mentioned, Brother Qin, are indeed top-tier for nurturing foundations. However, it won't be easy to buy them at the</p><p>    Taiyi Pill Pavilion. The main ingredients for these pills were reportedly discovered in an ancient medicinal garden</p><p>    and were limited. My sect only refined a small quantity to improve their alchemy skills. Since the auction,</p><p>    countless people, including major sects and rogue Gold Core cultivators, have sought these pills. It's unlikely any</p><p>    remain available. You can inquire at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion, but those auctions were decades ago."</p><p>Qin Sang's</p><p>    heart sank. Twenty years ago, when he inquired at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion, he'd noticed the auctions were long past</p><p>    and had a premonition, now confirmed by Wanderer.</p><p>Spiritual herbs are scarce in the current cultivation world,</p><p>    especially those required for pills like the Harmony Pill, which are born from the essence of heaven and earth and</p><p>    almost never appear outside ancient battlefields. Hence their rarity.</p><p>If he were to personally request</p><p>    them...</p><p>Qin Sang also understood the implication in Wanderer's words. The Taiyi Pill Sect doesn't just</p><p>    consider the price; they also aim to build connections. How could a Foundation Establishment cultivator compete with</p><p>    major sects and Gold Core masters?</p><p>Unless he's willing to bleed dry and be exploited, offering something truly</p><p>    enticing to the Taiyi Pill Sect.</p><p>Elder Earth Scarcity had gathered precious spiritual materials to refine the</p><p>    Primordial Unity Ring. Each one was incredibly valuable. Offering some might persuade the Taiyi Pill Sect.</p><p></p><p>    However, unless absolutely necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to give these things up.</p><p>Elder Di Que meticulously</p><p>    collected these rare spiritual materials for so long; once given away, they might be impossible to find again.</p></p><p><p>Qin Sang had studied the refining method of the Hunyuan Tongxin Ring and discovered he only needed two more spiritual</p><p>    materials. This meant that after forming his Gold Core, he would only need to find these two materials to have</p><p>    another powerful magical treasure. The temptation was immense.</p><p>Of course, if he couldn't form his Gold Core,</p><p>    everything would be a pipe dream. In the end, if necessary, he'd have to trade them. But Qin Sang was only at the</p><p>    early stage of Foundation Establishment; he still had plenty of time to prepare.</p><p>"Thank you for your guidance,</p><p>    Senior. I understand."</p><p>Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, silently pondering his future path.</p><p>At this</p><p>    moment, Yun Youzi hesitated for a moment, then said, "Brother Qin, if you are interested in searching for such</p><p>    spiritual herbs, I know of a place, but I'm not sure if you'd be willing."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Yun Youzi in</p><p>    surprise.</p><p>"Senior, please tell me."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded. "Brother Qin, do you remember our first encounter</p><p>    at Changyang Market six months ago? I was preparing to travel west because I'd investigated a rumor about an ancient</p><p>    cultivator's cave. It was said that someone discovered a hidden passage inside, possibly leading to the cultivator's</p><p>    medicinal garden. I've spent six months investigating and believe there's a good chance it's true. The garden has</p><p>    just been discovered, so the spiritual herbs within likely haven't been harvested yet. Perhaps we can find what we</p><p>    need there. However, I'm afraid I'm not capable enough to do this alone, so I returned to find help. I wanted to</p><p>    mention this when we met in the Tianjing Secret Realm, but the mission delayed me. If you're interested, Brother</p><p>    Qin, I'd be happy to have you join me."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his first meeting with Yun Youzi at Changyang</p><p>    Market. Yun Youzi had indeed mentioned receiving information about a potential opportunity and needing to</p><p>    investigate.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't ready to immediately accept or refuse Yun Youzi's sudden invitation.</p></p><p><p>He still wanted to inquire at the Taiyi Alchemy Pavilion whether the three ingredients for the Heyun Pill were truly</p><p>    unavailable for auction.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's hesitation, Yun Youzi didn't press him, adding, "Brother Qin,</p><p>    there's no need to rush. Entering that cave isn't easy, and it won't open for another two or three years. We can</p><p>    discuss this further after we've escaped this dangerous situation."</p></p>
