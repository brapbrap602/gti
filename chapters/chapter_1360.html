<h1></h1><p>Ten years later.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang was quietly cultivating in his cave, the cave's restrictions activated.</p><p>Peach blossoms were in full bloom, filling the valley with fragrance, a scene of tranquility.</p><p>At the entrance of Peach Blossom Valley, there was a simple cave opened in the mountainside, with a flat boulder in front of the entrance, where a white cat lazily lay.</p><p>The years were peaceful and beautiful.</p><p>The white cat was bright-eyed and handsome, its fur as smooth as brocade, displaying a lazy posture, as if dozing off.</p><p>After Qingjun left, Qin Sang cultivated quietly in Peach Blossom Valley and brought the white cat over.</p><p>The white cat was naturally ecstatic.</p><p>Fat Chicken was a second-generation demon, personally taught by its mother, and had a stalk of Corpse Flower Blood Amber waiting for it to consume when it broke through, giving it the greatest hope of transforming into a human.</p><p>White Crane came from humble beginnings, but found a good Dao companion.</p><p>After Qin Sang and the Snake King resolved their past grudges, the couple often traveled between the Thousand Bamboo Sea and Dragon Transformation Mountain to pay respects to the Snake King, greatly pleasing the Snake King.</p><p>Only the white cat focused on bitter cultivation, changing its practice to the *Celestial Demon Body Refining*, and could seek guidance from Qin Sang nearby in Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>The effect of a top-tier cultivation method was immediately apparent.</p><p>Judging by its aura, it far surpassed its past self and was about to break through to the middle stage of the demon core.</p><p>It seemed to be asleep, but in reality, it never slacked off, its back occasionally bulging, as if a small snake was moving within its meridians.</p><p>Inhaling spiritual energy, cultivating the technique.</p><p>The reason it was waiting outside the cave was because today was a very important day, and the white cat was afraid of getting lost in cultivation and missing the important event.</p><p>After one cycle of cultivation.</p><p>The white cat's tail twitched, and it suddenly opened its eyes, flipped over, and stood up, vigilantly looking outside Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Then, it put on a respectful expression and opened the restriction at the entrance.</p><p>"Greetings, Senior."</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>A silver light flashed, and Jingyu landed in front of the white cat, glancing inside. "Tomorrow is the Green Ram Temple's Founding Ceremony, with guests arriving from all directions. Your master is so calm, hasn't he come out of seclusion yet?"</p><p>"Reporting to Senior, Master is refining a treasure to guard the sect. He said he will be out of seclusion by tonight at the latest," the white cat said respectfully.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Jingyu revealed a curious expression. "In previous years, the Beast King Banner he refined with the soul of the cloud beast was quite powerful, and it could protect the Green Ram Temple's lineage. It could barely be considered a treasure to guard the sect. What other ingenious ideas does he have?"</p><p>The white cat only said that it did not know.</p><p>Jingyu did not stand on ceremony, flashed into the pavilion in the peach forest to wait for Qin Sang, and called the white cat down to give it some pointers.</p><p>At this time.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat upright on a prayer mat.</p><p>The Ebony Sword floated in front of him, and he held the charred wood entrusted with Yunyouzi's True Spirit in his hand.</p><p>After collecting Southern Illumination Leaving Fire on Sword Scar Mountain, Qin Sang had new insights into the Dao of refining tools. He did not act until he had thoroughly understood it and ensured that there would be no mistakes.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was smelting Yunyouzi's True Spirit, and he didn't know how long it would take to stabilize, but he did not hesitate at all.</p><p>'Buzz buzz...'</p><p>The Ebony Sword had been vibrating, with the amplitude increasing.</p><p>Gradually, the Ebony Sword almost turned into a ball of light.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang raised his palm and gently threw the charred wood towards the Ebony Sword, and in the blink of an eye, it disappeared into the ball of light.</p><p>From beginning to end, the ball of light was very stable.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the ball of light, hesitated for a moment, and black flames surged from the center of his eyebrows. The Fire Lotus Seed flew out, flowing out a wisp of Demonic Fire, slowly approaching the ball of light.</p><p>The Ebony Sword's smelting of the charred wood's True Spirit did not require external force, and could even lead to failure.</p><p>However, the Demonic Fire of the Fire Lotus Seed had been refined by Qin Sang, and they were intimately connected. Coupled with the secret techniques that Qin Sang mastered, it could increase the chances of success.</p><p>These were what Qin Sang had researched after careful consideration.</p><p>Inside the ball of light.</p><p>The Ebony Sword hung upside down, pointing directly at the charred wood.</p><p>The sword light sprinkled down, like strands of light, dancing with the wind, appearing extremely gentle, gradually wrapping around the charred wood. The Demonic Fire also turned into runes, blending into the sword light, and one could hardly feel the slightest bit of the manic energy that should belong to the Demonic Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was solemn, not daring to be the slightest bit negligent, and extremely complex imprints rushed towards the ball of light like a tide, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>As time passed.</p><p>The Ebony Sword's body gradually 'melted'.</p><p>The charred wood was originally Clear Blessing True Bamboo, but it was almost completely destroyed under the lightning tribulation. Layers of 'impurities' were stripped away by the sword light and Demonic Fire, and finally Yunyouzi's True Spirit was integrated into the Ebony Sword.</p><p>"Hoo..."</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled a long breath, and the nervousness in his heart eased slightly.</p><p>This was Yunyouzi's only hope for resurrection, and no mistakes were allowed. Fortunately, his preparations were extremely thorough, and the smelting process was very smooth. He had not failed his mission!</p><p>'Shu!'</p><p>The sword light converged, and a sword embryo (sword blank), as pure as precious jade, floated in mid-air.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly sense that Yunyouzi's True Spirit was inside the sword embryo, still extremely fragile.</p><p>The sword embryo was like a fetus, nurturing the True Spirit.</p><p>He reached out and gently touched the sword embryo, not daring to use force, his eyes complicated, as if reminiscing about the past, and full of hope, and finally muttered a sentence.</p><p>"This sword shall be named Yunyou (Wandering Cloud)!"</p><p>After staring for a long time, Qin Sang took the sword embryo into his nascent soul (Yuanshen) to nurture it, and fragments of his interaction with Yunyouzi flashed in his mind.</p><p>Afterward, he thought of Bai and Qingjun, who were in an uncertain state of life and death.</p><p>He recalled the scene of the Ziwei Palace's ascension ten years ago.</p><p>The Immortal Palace ascended, and Qingjun, Bai, and Old Devil Ye entered the Heavenly Cave.</p><p>The remaining Nascent Soul cultivators discovered that the outer hall had begun to collapse. They were powerless to stop it and could only watch helplessly as the platform of guiding light (receiving platform) turned into ruins, and then fled outward as if their lives depended on it.</p><p>Qin Sang only moved after watching Qingjun disappear, but he was one of the first to leave.</p><p>After escaping from the outer hall, everyone was still in shock and looked back.</p><p>They saw billowing smoke and dust.</p><p>The platform of guiding light, the Immortal Graveyard, the stone mountain, and even the outermost golden palace, all turned into ashes, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>The Ziwei Palace Secret Realm disappeared from the world!</p><p>The aftershock of the Immortal Palace's ascension did not weaken until a day and a night later.</p><p>The place where the Ziwei Palace was located was a huge cyclone of wind and clouds.</p><p>The space here was originally very stable, but now it was more dangerous than other places in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. The spatial storm gradually dissipated, but its remaining power constantly affected this place.</p><p>The wind and cloud cyclone dissipated, the hurricane howled, the space shattered, and spatial cracks were everywhere.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators waited for a long time, paying particular attention to the sky above.</p><p>The Heavenly Cave closed.</p><p>Finally, after determining that there would be no more changes, they decided to leave.</p><p>After this battle.</p><p>Beichen Realm's great hidden danger, Old Devil Ye, 'ascended'.</p><p>Not many people died in the hands of Old Devil Ye and Jade Bone, but several people fell in the Immortal Palace due to excessive greed, and even more were injured, especially Feather King (Yu Wang), whose injuries were the most serious. Even when he transformed into human form, he could not hide his weakness.</p><p>In addition, the biggest losses were the Heavenly Hành League (Tianxing Meng) and Qin Sang.</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi's life and death were unknown, and the Heavenly Hành League had no leader, and only the Twin War Generals could replace Daoist Zhenyi.</p><p>Qin Sang lost his Senior Sister (Qingjun) and Bai, two good teachers and friends, and also lost a corpse puppet (refined corpse) at the level of a Corpse King (corpse monarch). Fortunately, the Demonic Fire and the nascent soul puppet (Yuanying Fu Kui) were still there, otherwise his status would plummet.</p><p>What Qin Sang could not do anything about was that the Sword Path Grand Hall and the Ancient Teleportation Array also 'ascended' along with the Immortal Palace, and the road to the Canglang Sea was cut off.</p><p>All previous plans regarding the Canglang Sea were useless.</p>
