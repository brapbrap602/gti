<h1>Chapter 1800: The Broken Drum</h1><p>As soon as the talisman appeared, Qin Sang felt a suction force. Releasing his hold, the talisman was drawn into the clouds.</p><p>A short while later, the clouds behind the archway parted, and two golden-armored guards emerged. “Greetings, True Person Qingfeng. The talisman is authentic.  Which department do you wish to visit, and which Immortal Official are you seeking?”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in return and said, “The Merit Department.”</p><p>Within the two courts of the Dao Court, the Heavenly Hub Court and the Northern Pole Exorcism Court had similar structures, resembling mortal government offices.  Regions, Altars, and Platforms governed the four directions. Within the governing platforms were Halls, Pavilions, and Departments, which controlled the Altars and Platforms and managed various affairs.</p><p>The Merit Department was the most frequently interacted with by cultivators outside the Dao Court. As the name suggested, the Dao Court's decrees originated from this department, which was the place for recording and discussing merits.</p><p>The golden-armored guards exchanged glances. Without any visible incantations, the clouds parted, revealing a cloud path seemingly leading to an immortal palace.</p><p>“True Person, this way please!”</p><p>The golden-armored guards led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely.</p><p>This was the heart of the Dao Court. To avoid offending a Grand True Person and causing unnecessary trouble, Qin Sang refrained from awakening the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Clouds and mist swirled.</p><p>Stepping into the clouds, the qi was initially dense, but it was completely different from the auspicious clouds of the Jushan Governing Platform.</p><p>Here, it was stable, without the fluctuating chaotic primal energy. The immortal palace ahead appeared increasingly ethereal, inexplicably inducing a sense of tranquility.</p><p>Perhaps, the Jushan Governing Platform was once like this.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed the presence of formations, not yet activated, but they still caused his heart to tremble. He dared not act rashly.</p><p>Passing through the clouds and mist, the scenery ahead gradually became clearer. Qin Sang realized the two golden-armored guards were leading him towards a cluster of golden halls.</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with this style of golden halls. They were similar to those of the Jushan Governing Platform, except that most of the Jushan Governing Platform's halls were destroyed, and the remaining ones exuded an ancient and weathered aura.</p><p>Reaching the end of the cloud path, his feet touched solid ground.  A courtyard lay ahead, with a plaque reading "Merit Department."</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky and found the immortal palace was still ahead, but now slightly clearer.  Immortal mountains and layers of golden halls amidst the sea of clouds reached the azure heavens, inspiring longing in his heart.</p><p>After escorting Qin Sang, the two golden-armored guards bowed and retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, seeing no other Immortal Officials. While puzzled, a Daoist emerged from the courtyard.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Qin Sang followed him towards the main hall. A figure stood before the hall.</p><p>This person wore a Two Instruments Harmony Crown, adorned with a rhinoceros horn hairpin.</p><p>He was dressed in a three-colored cloud and mountain seven-star crimson robe with twenty-four stripes, a light yellow Daoist robe with a three-colored cloud and mountain pattern, a light yellow undergarment, and a five-panel, four-section light yellow skirt.</p><p>He wore a white jade pendant and red shoes.</p><p>With sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes, he possessed an extraordinary air.</p><p>“Mid-Nascent Soul cultivation. Fourth Rank, Nine Heavens Investigating Envoy!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. This person should be the Registrar of the Merit Department, the head official.</p><p>Ordinary people wouldn't be able to meet the Registrar.  Only someone like Qin Sang, also a Hollow Profundity True Person, could receive a personal audience.</p><p>“This humble Daoist, Qingfeng, greets the Nine Heavens Investigating Envoy.” Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>The Daoist didn’t put on airs or adopt the demeanor of a Dao Court Immortal Official. Returning the bow with a smile, he said, “Greetings, True Person Qingfeng. My Daoist title is Ningluo. True Person Wan recently sent a message to the Merit Department, and I am already aware of the merits you have achieved. I was deeply impressed when I heard about you single-handedly slaying Marquis Li, and I finally have the pleasure of meeting you in person.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained humble, attributing it to luck.</p><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, they got down to business.</p><p>True Person Ningluo returned to his desk and picked up a jade slip.</p><p>“For the merit of slaying a demon marquis, the Merit Department has established procedures. However, True Person Wan took the demon corpse, and its value is difficult to determine. We must discuss it with you face-to-face. Do you intend to exchange it for merit points or other treasures?”</p><p>Many factors influenced a demon corpse’s value.</p><p>Qin Sang had taken the most valuable demon core and other items, but the remaining bones, scales, tendons, and blood were also worth a fortune.</p><p>The easiest option was to exchange it for another similar demon corpse.</p><p>The jade slip in True Person Ningluo's hand recorded various exchangeable treasures, ranging in value, but generally within a certain range.</p><p>Qin Sang's intention lay elsewhere. He asked directly, “Can the merit from slaying Marquis Li be exchanged for the qualification to receive the third-tier Dharma transmission?”</p><p>“What Dharma are you cultivating, True Person?” True Person Ningluo inquired.</p><p>“The High Divine Empyrean Scripture!”</p><p>…</p><p>True Person Ningluo pondered, “The third-tier Dharma transmission of the High Divine Empyrean Scripture is the Five Thunders Secret Art, which can be granted by the Exorcism Court. The remains of Marquis Li are more than sufficient to exchange for the qualification. However, although the Exorcism Court possesses the corresponding Myriad Divine Thunder Immortal Invitation, it is uncertain which Immortal True Being would respond to the summons…”</p><p>True Person Zhangui had already warned Qin Sang about this.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately expressed his desire to still receive the Five Thunders Secret Art.</p><p>True Person Ningluo nodded and immediately sent a message to the Transmission Department, saying, “According to customary practice, the Transmission Department requires three days to prepare for a Dharma transmission ceremony for one person. Three days later, True Person, you may proceed directly to the Transmission Department.”</p><p>Finally, it was settled!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel relieved. He looked at the jade slip in True Person Ningluo’s hand, but didn't reach for it. Instead, he said, "I wish to exchange the remaining merit for the insights on altar construction left by predecessors who cultivated the Five Thunders Secret Art. Is that possible?"</p><p>Unlike the first two tiers of Dharma transmission, which Qin Sang could quickly comprehend with his cultivation, he would now have to cultivate while simultaneously comprehending the talismanic forms and gradually construct the altar.</p><p>Having the experience of predecessors could help him avoid detours and save a significant amount of time.</p><p>This request actually involved the true inheritance of the High Divine Empyrean Scripture, and Qin Sang felt somewhat apprehensive, unsure if the Dao Court would agree.</p><p>If Marquis Li had only been at the early Nascent Soul stage, the chances would have been slim.</p><p>True Person Ningluo didn't seem surprised by Qin Sang's request. Putting down the jade slip, he mused, “The Exorcism Court does possess some relevant texts, and the two courts share such knowledge. I can retrieve texts from both courts for you to peruse…”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed, not expecting things to go so smoothly.  However, he then heard True Person Ningluo's tone shift.</p><p>“However, I have a request. True Person, if you successfully invoke a Thunder Deity from the Myriad Divine Thunder Immortal Invitation to protect your altar while cultivating the Five Thunders Secret Art, you must immediately report to the Dao Court and record your insights without reservation.”</p><p>With a smile, True Person Ningluo continued, “If you perform such a benevolent act, it would truly be a blessing for future generations! I can then attempt to mediate and request some texts from the Left and Right Thunder Mansions. True Person, with your dual cultivation of Dharma Body and remarkable talent, rarely seen in the world, I believe the two Mansion Lords would be pleased to see you succeed.”</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat taken aback.</p><p>He had initially suspected the Dao Court intentionally withheld guidance on invoking deities to limit external forces and maintain the Daoist sect’s supreme position.</p><p>Listening to True Person Ningluo’s tone, it seemed invoking Thunder Deities was genuinely difficult.</p><p>Could it be that even the Left and Right Thunder Mansions couldn't invoke Thunder Deities?</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang.</p><p>The altar-protecting divine generals formed through inner contemplation were less effective at protecting the nascent soul than Thunder Deities; this was an established fact.</p><p>According to True Person Zhangui, under normal circumstances, they could at least hold out until reaching the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>When inner contemplation reached its limit and could no longer protect oneself, one would inevitably have to request reinforcement from the Dao Court.</p><p>In the future, if his cultivation exceeded the limit, and he couldn't invoke a Thunder Deity and refused to request other Dharma transmissions from the Dao Court, it would definitely arouse suspicion.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Unsure when he would find the path to ascension, Qin Sang couldn’t be certain how long he would remain in this realm.</p><p>On second thought, he was still far from the late Nascent Soul stage. He could make excuses then.</p><p>The texts from the Dao Court and the Left and Right Thunder Mansions would greatly benefit him. The advantages clearly outweighed the disadvantages.</p><p>If one day he truly faced pressure from the Dao Court, to prevent the Jade Buddha’s exposure, he could feign nascent soul instability and request reinforcement.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang immediately agreed and made an oath as a covenant.</p><p>True Person Ningluo beamed with delight. “Discussions with the Heavenly Hub Court and the Left and Right Thunder Mansions will take time. Once the texts are gathered, we can determine their value. Please remain in the governing platform for a few days…”</p><p>Qin Sang realized the conditions offered by True Person Ningluo were genuinely generous. If there were any remaining merit, he could continue to exchange it for other treasures. If his merit was insufficient, he could even borrow against future merit.</p><p>He sensed the goodwill extended by the other party, but he didn't know whether it was True Person Ningluo’s own initiative or if the Dao Court valued him.</p><p>“Displaying a certain level of strength at the appropriate time is necessary.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, thanking True Person Ningluo.</p><p>True Person Ningluo handed Qin Sang a token, granting him free lodging in a cave dwelling within the governing platform while awaiting news.</p><p>Having achieved his goal, Qin Sang didn't linger, departing from the Northern Pole Exorcism Court.</p><p>Walking along the road, Qin Sang pondered the various matters ahead, intending to go directly to the cave dwelling to cultivate and await the Dharma transmission in three days.</p><p>The cave dwelling was located beside the Northern Pole Exorcism Court, usually rented out, and was also a Dao Court property.</p><p>Atop the immortal peak, there were stone caves, pavilions, and secluded courtyards hidden amongst the misty forests, all serving as cave dwellings of varying grades.</p><p>Qin Sang presented the token, and a Daoist led him towards the area where the higher-grade cave dwellings were located.</p><p>Looking at the higher-grade cave dwellings nestled among the forests, sealed by formations, Qin Sang seemed to recall something. He suddenly stopped and said to the Daoist beside him, “Tell me the location of the cave dwelling. You may leave now.”</p><p>The Daoist bowed in acknowledgement, not daring to question the reason. He informed Qin Sang of the incantation to open the cave dwelling and returned down the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced towards his designated cave dwelling, pondered for a moment, but then strode off in another direction.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang arrived at a courtyard.</p><p>Unlike other courtyards, this one was quite secluded and simple.  The outer wall was a fence, not even entirely straight, with two wooden doors closed.</p><p>Behind the fence lay a large field cultivated into a medicinal garden. The spiritual herbs thrived, clearly indicating someone resided there and tended to them regularly.</p><p>Within the courtyard stood several square black stone houses, arranged in a circle, quite peculiar.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the rich fire primal energy emanating from the place. With a faint smile, he activated the restriction and said, “This humble Daoist, Qingfeng, has come to pay respects to Grandmaster Gu.”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a jade-like young Daoist child emerged from the stone house.</p><p>The Daoist child hurried to the gate and said formally, "My master has said that he will not be opening the furnace for the next ten years. Senior, if you wish to refine magical treasures, please seek another worthy expert."</p><p>The Grandmaster Gu whom Qin Sang intended to visit was a master refiner who had some acquaintance with Grandmaster Lingxu. Qin Sang had learned of Grandmaster Gu's residence from Grandmaster Lingxu and had originally intended to ask this master to examine those fragmented treasures.</p><p>“Please trouble the young Daoist child to inform him. This humble Daoist has not come for refining. I have a treasure of unknown origin and wish to ask Grandmaster Gu for his appraisal.”</p><p>The Daoist child immediately returned to the stone house and shortly after hurried back, inviting Qin Sang inside.</p><p>The interior of the stone house was surprisingly spacious and elegantly furnished, with a bronze Boshan incense burner placed within.</p><p>The burner had a tall, pointed, and hollow lid, shaped like overlapping mountains, intricately carved with cloud patterns, figures, and birds and beasts, a masterpiece of craftsmanship.</p><p>Incense burned within, and the light smoke drifted out, swirling around the burner, naturally creating the effect of misty mountains and floating beasts, resembling an immortal mountain.</p><p>The room was filled with a pleasant fragrance.</p><p>A refined female cultivator sat on a cushion.  It was Grandmaster Gu, a stark contrast to the unkempt Grandmaster Qi.</p><p>“True Person Qingfeng, please be seated.  We seem to have not met before.”</p><p>Grandmaster Gu's voice was cool.</p><p>"This humble Daoist cultivates in the Jushan Governing Platform and recently broke through to the Hollow Profundity realm. I am currently awaiting my Dharma transmission at the governing platform," Qin Sang explained.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu understood. She had heard of similar instances before.</p><p>A cultivator of low cultivation obtains a supreme treasure but doesn't know its purpose, fearing attracting trouble for possessing such a valuable item, and only dares to seek appraisal after achieving a certain level of cultivation.</p><p>A treasure that even a Hollow Profundity True Person couldn't recognize.</p><p>She couldn't help but feel a surge of anticipation. “What treasure do you wish to have appraised, True Person Qingfeng?”</p><p>“A broken drum…”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Of the three fragmented treasures obtained by the Formless Immortal Sect, two remained a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang considered that this place was too close to the Northern Pole Exorcism Court. The broken drum clearly had a large hole. Even if it was some extraordinary treasure, a mere fragment wouldn't cause too much of a stir.</p><p>The Chengying Sword appeared completely undamaged; it was best to seek another master refiner for its appraisal.</p><p>With that, Qin Sang immediately took out the broken drum and placed it on the table.</p><p>There was a noticeable hole in the drum's surface, and it didn't resemble the True Treasure fragments, which clearly displayed unusual phenomena.</p><p>However, the moment she saw the broken drum, Grandmaster Gu's gaze was captivated, unable to look away.</p><p>Noticing Grandmaster Gu's expression, Qin Sang's heart stirred, secretly thinking that the Formless Immortal Sect had indeed plundered many good treasures from the immortal hall.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu took a deep breath, glanced at Qin Sang, and Qin Sang nodded in understanding.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu picked up the broken drum with exceptionally gentle movements, as if admiring some rare treasure.</p><p>Then, with a delicate flick of her jade-like finger, the smoke from the Boshan burner was drawn towards the broken drum.</p><p>Wisps of smoke seeped into the large hole on the drum's surface, while the smoke outside became erratic, transforming into countless flying birds and running beasts, constantly lunging at the broken drum and shattering their smoke-formed bodies.</p><p>“So it's a rare treasure related to the Dao of Refining.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Boshan burner, thinking to himself.</p><p>He could vaguely discern some clues. Grandmaster Gu was employing a secret technique to comprehend this treasure, and the technique was far more refined than Grandmaster Qi's, befitting a master refiner of the Daoist sect.</p><p>The room quickly filled with swirling smoke.</p><p>Grandmaster Gu paid no attention, continuously changing secret techniques, but the anticipation and excitement in her eyes gradually faded, replaced by disappointment.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been observing her, couldn't help but grow apprehensive, sensing something amiss.</p><p>Slowly withdrawing her technique, Grandmaster Gu put down the broken drum, looked at Qin Sang, and said, “This treasure should be a damaged Posterior Heaven Spiritual Treasure!”</p><p>Posterior Heaven Spiritual Treasure!</p><p>Qin Sang's spirits lifted.  Indeed, it was as he suspected.</p><p>Assisting Grandmaster Qi in refining, Qin Sang's understanding of the Dao of Refining had also advanced by leaps and bounds. He had actually made some discoveries earlier and conservatively estimated it to be a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The challenge lay in how to repair a Posterior Heaven Spiritual Treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang had tried numerous times, but the broken drum remained unresponsive, unable to be repaired and thus worthless.</p><p>However, Qin Sang then saw Grandmaster Gu sigh softly with a regretful expression. "Unfortunately, the artifact spirit has perished."</p>
