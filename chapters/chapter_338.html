<h1>Chapter 331: Ethereal Cloud</h1><p>“Ethereal Cloud.”</p><p>The exchange continued, but nothing that truly caught Qin Sang's eye appeared.  Just as he was considering which of his own artifacts to offer, a female cultivator produced a cloud-shaped artifact, capturing his attention.</p><p>“A top-grade flight artifact, the Ethereal Cloud. It allows the user to become invisible during flight, or disguise themselves as a common cloud.  Its speed is exceptional, allowing for swift and silent movement. The artifact also contains an aura of the netherworld, granting it strong defensive capabilities. Moreover, within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, it offers some protection against罡 winds and celestial phenomena.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he listened to the female cultivator's introduction. He had been looking to replace his Flying Shuttle with a similar artifact, but hadn't been satisfied with the few he had seen so far.</p><p>If the cultivator wasn't exaggerating, this one seemed perfect.</p><p>The female cultivator enveloped the Ethereal Cloud in spiritual energy and moved it to the center of the long table for everyone to examine.</p><p>Suddenly, a male cultivator clad in black armor let out a sinister chuckle. His voice was chilling as he said, “I never thought I’d see the Ethereal Cloud here.  This was Azure Wing’s signature artifact!</p><p>It was originally a fairly common high-grade artifact called the Azure Cloud. Azure Wing stumbled upon a wisp of netherworld energy in a secret realm and refined it into the Azure Cloud, elevating it to a top-grade artifact and renaming it the Ethereal Cloud.</p><p>It is unique and one of a kind.</p><p>Azure Wing made many enemies, yet managed to survive for so long.  Besides his bizarre demonic arts, the Ethereal Cloud played a significant role in his survival.</p><p>As far as I know, Azure Wing was a lecherous old man nearing two hundred years of age, certainly not a woman.</p><p>No wonder there hasn't been any news of Azure Wing's misdeeds for several years now, heh heh…”</p><p>The man's words revealed the origin of the Ethereal Cloud.  A look of realization flashed across the eyes of several cultivators who had clearly heard of Azure Wing.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know who Azure Wing was.</p><p>Listening to the discussions around him, he learned that Azure Wing was a notorious fiend active between Heaven's End Pass and the Shadow Mountains Pass. He was said to be a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, powerful, cunning, and lecherous.  He often raided the Shadow Mountains Pass, harming many female cultivators.</p><p>Azure Wing belonged to a sect called the Flowery Path Sect, which had some notoriety. He was also extremely crafty, targeting only rogue cultivators or disciples of weaker sects. Once he succeeded, he would immediately flee.</p><p>This explained how he had committed so many atrocities and yet remained at large.</p><p>Now it seemed Azure Wing’s luck had run out, as even his signature artifact was lost. Although the female cultivator appeared to be only at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, she was clearly not to be underestimated.</p><p>The Ethereal Cloud was conspicuous and unique, which explained why it wasn't being sold at auction but traded here.</p><p>In fact, not just the Ethereal Cloud, but many of the treasures traded earlier likely had similar origins, shady but unquestioned.</p><p>The armored man's sudden interruption was a breach of etiquette.</p><p>The female cultivator was furious. She turned sharply to glare at him, her eyes narrowed with undisguised killing intent.  Her voice was icy, “Azure Wing harmed countless people, and deserves to be slain by anyone! Are you trying to avenge him?”</p><p>The armored man's breath hitched. He averted his gaze, unable to meet her eyes, and forced a laugh. "You misunderstand.  Azure Wing’s crimes were heinous. He deserved to be killed. I have no connection to him and would only applaud his demise. I was merely… startled to see the Ethereal Cloud and guessed that Azure Wing might have been killed.  I was momentarily overcome with… yes, that's it, overcome with emotion!  I wonder which hero eliminated this fiend. Well done!  Excellent work!"</p><p>Everyone around them was filled with disdain.</p><p>The female cultivator snorted, ignoring his pretense.  After finishing her demonstration of the Ethereal Cloud, she said, “I'll trade the Ethereal Cloud for a flying sword of comparable quality, or alternatively, an artifact with unique properties.”</p><p>Many were interested in the Ethereal Cloud, and someone immediately spoke up, “May I ask, if I were to acquire the Ethereal Cloud, will it bring me trouble?”</p><p>The female cultivator glanced at the speaker, her eyes narrowing slightly. She said indifferently, “At least *he* won't be coming after you.”</p><p>The implication was that she couldn't guarantee anything about Azure Wing’s sect.</p><p>Others hesitated, but Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the Flowery Path Sect. Let them try to cause trouble for Mount Shao Hua at Hanging Skull Pass.</p><p>“Would you consider this flying sword?”</p><p>Qin Sang produced Yu Daiyue’s flying sword and presented it to the female cultivator.</p><p>Yu Daiyue’s flying sword, likely enhanced with additional spiritual materials, was of far superior quality than others, even surpassing the Ethereal Cloud.</p><p>Qin Sang had only minimally refined the sword after obtaining it, not intending to use it himself.  This was a good opportunity to trade it.</p><p>The female cultivator's eyes lit up upon seeing the sword. Without hesitation, she agreed, “I’ll trade with you!”</p><p>The deal was struck before anyone else could intervene, much to Qin Sang's satisfaction.  He took the Ethereal Cloud, briefly examined it, and then put it away, as it was now his turn to present his items.</p><p>“These items are only for trade for Foundation Establishment and Qi-nourishing pills, or rare spiritual wood.”</p><p>Qin Sang took out two flying swords and Yu Daiyue's octagonal bronze mirror, leaned back in his chair, and spoke calmly.</p><p>He kept the young man in tight clothing’s seven-colored umbrella for his own use.  The other items were just taking up space in his storage pouch, better traded for pills or spiritual wood that could enhance his cultivation.</p><p>The appearance of three more artifacts immediately changed the way others looked at Qin Sang. Their gazes held a mixture of apprehension and awe, even from the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Including the spiritual sword he traded earlier, Qin Sang had now presented four top-grade artifacts.  Not many cultivators present could match this display of wealth.</p><p>Even the hulking man, lost in his own world, was startled by Qin Sang's extravagance.  He stole a glance at Qin Sang, then lowered his head, his eyes filled with envy and dejection.</p><p>These people certainly possessed a wealth of valuable items.</p><p>All three artifacts were excellent, especially the scarred man's flying sword and the octagonal bronze mirror. Even the late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, who had remained aloof until now, couldn't resist joining the bidding.</p><p>Seeing the high demand, Qin Sang remained firm on his request for pills and spiritual wood. In the end, the two best items were bought.</p><p>Although he didn't receive much spiritual wood, Qin Sang was overjoyed to obtain a bottle of Qi-Gathering Pills from a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>These were the same Qi-Gathering Pills he had been forced to consume by Elder Yi Tiannie in the Gloomy Yin Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang had a bad experience with these pills. He carefully examined them, ensuring they weren't tainted with any insidious poison, before agreeing to the trade.</p><p>Pills that strengthened one's foundation and nourished Qi had always been highly sought after.</p><p>Burning gazes focused on the jade bottle containing the Qi-Gathering Pills. Holding it in his hand, Qin Sang felt a strange sensation, as if the bottle itself were burning. He snorted, put the pills away, and unflinchingly met the gazes of those around him.</p><p>Everyone quickly averted their eyes, unwilling to meet his stare.  Any questionable intentions they might have harbored were quickly suppressed.</p><p>It wasn’t difficult to guess how he acquired so many top-grade artifacts.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang's apparent cultivation level was not low. He was clearly not someone to be trifled with.</p>
