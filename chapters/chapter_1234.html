<h1>Chapter 1226: The Present and the Future</h1><p>The secret art of *Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed* did not mention refining spiritual flames before absorbing them. Instead, it advocated a straightforward and brutal approach: directly absorbing the essence of the spiritual flames to forge the fire seed. If there were only one or two types of spiritual flames, this might not be a problem. However, for a cultivator to advance further in this art, they would inevitably need to absorb and refine a variety of spiritual flames, fusing them into a single fire seed lotus. Different spiritual flames could inherently conflict with one another, and the accumulation of chaotic energies would destabilize the foundation, making future refinement even more difficult. Could this lead to a sudden loss of control over the fire seed one day? The fire seed was rooted in the primordial spirit, so this was a risk that could not be ignored. It was unclear whether the ancient sage who created *Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed* had overlooked this issue or had already proven that there was no such hidden danger, allowing cultivators to practice it without worry.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang had considered this before. After all, the Great Dao was interconnected. The Nine Nether Demonic Flame was artificially cultivated and required refinement to obtain its purest essence. However, the secret art did not mention this, and Qin Sang was already struggling to refine the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, let alone purify it. The secret art of the Azure Sun Demon Sect aligned perfectly with his thoughts!</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, engrossed in studying the secret art. This art was based on the Azure Sun Demon Sect's cultivation techniques and the Azure Sun Demonic Flame, so it could not be directly applied to the Nine Nether Demonic Flame. However, it provided Qin Sang with a valuable reference and a new perspective.</p><p>"Should I trust *Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed* and its creator, or follow my own intuition?" Qin Sang fell into deep contemplation, weighing the pros and cons. If he trusted the secret art and its creator, directly absorbing the Nine Nether Demonic Flame would grant him a powerful technique, an irresistible temptation. Judging by the past performance of the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, once all the demonic flames sealed within the nineteen demon banners were refined, he could dominate the Nascent Soul stage, unrivaled in his generation. Perhaps he could even contend with a Deity Transformation powerhouse. On the other hand, if he refined the Nine Nether Demonic Flame first before absorbing it, he would lose some of its potency, but it would lay a solid foundation for the future. In this realm, Deity Transformation experts were elusive, and Nascent Soul Patriarchs were the pinnacle of power. The first option seemed safe enough. But Qin Sang was not pursuing such limited goals.</p><p>He sought eternal life, free from decay and calamity! Once he settled his affairs and reached a certain level of cultivation, he would inevitably leave the North Star Realm, traveling far and wide to seek opportunities for Deity Transformation or a way to cross the storm barrier, exploring the true secrets of this world. His gaze was always fixed beyond the Nascent Soul stage, beyond the storm barrier. He would never stop here. Otherwise, the grand vow he had made before the Princess would become a joke. Qin Sang did not need to overthink thisâ€”he chose the future.</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist Xiang, for gifting me this secret art," Qin Sang sincerely expressed his gratitude. He glanced at the Ancestral Sacred Flame before withdrawing his gaze. "Before I continue my attempts, I would like to seclude myself for a while to study the secret art."</p><p>Xiang Qing had no objections and immediately led Qin Sang down the mountain.</p><p>Bing Han smiled and said, "It seems Fellow Daoist Mingyue is already confident. My presence here is no longer necessary, so I won't disturb the two of you. I wish you both success."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, why not stay a few more days?" Xiang Qing tried to persuade her.</p><p>Bing Han insisted on leaving. "There are still some trivial matters in my sect that need my attention. Today, meeting Fellow Daoist Mingyue has made this trip worthwhile. Fellow Daoist Mingyue truly lives up to his reputation. If you have the time, I hope you can visit the Ethereal Spirit Sect. I would also like to consult you on flame control techniques."</p><p>She exchanged a meaningful glance with Xiang Qing.</p><p>"Certainly! Certainly!" Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>The Ethereal Spirit Sect was not only renowned in the Little Cold Domain but also held significant prestige throughout the North Star Realm, primarily due to their unparalleled expertise in artifact forging. Qin Sang's introduction to artifact forging began with the insights of a Golden Core cultivator from the Ethereal Spirit Sect. However, he had not received any advanced teachings afterward and had to rely on his own exploration. Starting from scratch in alchemy would be difficult, and he lacked the resources to practice extensively. However, he could not abandon the craft of artifact forging. Additionally, forging a treasure to subdue the South Brightness Flame would require guidance from Bing Han, a master forger. Meeting Bing Han was truly the highlight of this trip for Qin Sang.</p><p>Together with Xiang Qing, Qin Sang escorted Bing Han to the mountain's edge before returning to the cave abode arranged by Xiang Qing, where he devoted himself to studying the secret art.</p><p>By the time the alliance meeting concluded, Sect Master Dong had not seen Qin Sang and could only return to his sect with a heavy heart, filled with anxiety and uncertainty. The only thing he could do was try to make amends and curry favor with the Demon Flame Sect.</p><p>The previously obscure ancestor of the Demon Flame Sect had suddenly advanced to the Nascent Soul stage! This news spread like a hurricane, sweeping through every corner of the Little Cold Domain. Overnight, the Demon Flame Sect became the center of attention, with countless visitors flocking to its gates. Even Nascent Soul cultivators sent messages to Xiang Qing, seeking confirmation. Upon learning that the newly ascended Nascent Soul was the Demon King Mingyue, they dismissed it with a laugh. In the past, they would have driven the Demon Flame Sect to the Heavenly Demon Hills, but now, with tensions between humans and demons easing, they chose to tolerate it.</p><p>Zhao Shanran, who had remained at the Demon Flame Sect, was initially baffled. After hearing the news, he stood frozen for a long time, unable to believe it. Only after Mei Gu sent word did he finally accept the truth. Overwhelmed with shock and joy, he felt as if he were dreaming when the once-arrogant Golden Core cultivators now addressed him as an equal, calling him "Fellow Daoist." However, after waiting for a long time, the ancestor still did not return. After the initial excitement faded, Zhao Shanran remembered the ancestor's instructions before his departure and busied himself with managing the sect's affairs. Countless factions extended goodwill to the Demon Flame Sect, and numerous cultivators came to visit, hoping to become disciples of a Nascent Soul master. The sect's affairs became incredibly complex, but Zhao Shanran found joy in the chaos. He knew that the Demon Flame Sect was on the brink of prosperity!</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang remained at the Azure Sun Demon Sect. Having fully comprehended the secret art and gained some insights, he decided to apply its principles to the Nine Nether Demonic Flame. The essence of this art was to use divine sense and spiritual power to form unique seals, like flowing water washing away the "impurities" in the spiritual flames, leaving behind the purest essence. He summoned the fire seed and, without hesitation, dispersed the Nine Nether Demonic Flame he had painstakingly refined before. Then, he drew a wisp of the Nine Nether Demonic Flame from the demon banner. After countless failures, he finally succeeded in purging the impurities, refining the purest demonic flame. Once he re-formed the fire seed, Qin Sang contacted Xiang Qing and returned to the Divine Apex Peak.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang guided a wisp of the Ancestral Sacred Flame into the fire seed. Using the secret art, he first refined the Ancestral Sacred Flame before absorbing it, and it worked! Like a skilled butcher dissecting an ox, Qin Sang gradually refined the Ancestral Sacred Flame. To his surprise, refining the Ancestral Sacred Flame and cultivating *Golden Lotus of the Fire Seed* went far more smoothly than he had anticipated.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang attributed this success to the Soul Nurturing Wood. The Ebony Sword, infused with Soul Nurturing Wood, constantly emitted soul light, nourishing his soul and refining his divine sense. For others, finding even a small piece of Soul Nurturing Wood to craft a talisman was a challenge, but Qin Sang had obtained a large section from Bai, most of which he had used to forge his sword. After decades of nurturing, the benefits were finally becoming apparent. This was likely the advantage of refined divine sense! With refined divine sense, cultivating techniques and secret arts related to divine sense became easier and faster.</p>
