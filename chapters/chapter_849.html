<h1>Chapter 841: A Startling Discovery</h1><p>The Leopard Demon, Crane Demon, and other great demons led their subordinates to besiege the merchants' alliance cultivators.</p><p>The merchants' alliance cultivators couldn't understand why so many great demons were targeting them.</p><p>They attempted to break through, but the great demons desperately blocked them, their ferocity chilling everyone to the bone.</p><p>At the same time, they discovered with horror that more great demons seemed to be converging on their location.</p><p>Just as the merchants' alliance cultivators were losing hope, the Leopard Demon finally received news from the Fish Demon: they had found their target's trail.</p><p>"Splitfin found him, but..."</p><p>The Crane Demon's voice was filled with surprise. "Splitfin tried to intercept him, but was severely injured and forced to self-destruct his physical body to escape with his life. The target has broken through the encirclement. We need to reinforce quickly. Could he have helpers?"</p><p>The Leopard Demon was first overjoyed, then his expression turned grave. He roared, "That useless fool! Why did he only send the message now? Let's go!"</p><p>An unexpected situation unfolded for the merchants' alliance cultivators.</p><p>Just as they thought they were doomed and were secretly discussing a desperate last stand, the strongest great demons suddenly withdrew without warning, leaving them alone.</p><p>Although the remaining demons were not weak, they were not as terrifying.</p><p>The merchants' alliance cultivators, though unaware of what had happened, immediately realized this was a golden opportunity.</p><p>After confirming that the great demons had truly left, they followed their previous plan and fought their way out.</p><p>A short while later, the Leopard Demon led his forces to the place where Qin Sang had disappeared. They used all their skills and magical powers, but they couldn't find him.</p><p>Frustrated roars echoed through the tide of beasts.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang was unaware of the enormous commotion he had caused.</p><p>After escaping the beast tide, he observed the stars to determine his direction, activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman, and set off alone on his escape route.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he left the beast tide far behind.</p><p>Despite the fierce battle with the Fish Demon, he encountered little resistance afterward, so few were faster than him.</p><p>He sped along, encountering no one.</p><p>Having controlled the formation disc for so long, Qin Sang already felt exhausted, and now he felt even more weary.</p><p>But he wouldn't rest nearby. After flying a great distance, he summoned the Two-Headed Snake, and man and beast took turns traveling for several days without stopping.</p><p>Only after leaving the sea region did Qin Sang find a small island to rest and recover.</p><p>His cave dwelling was built beneath a giant rock, concealed by a spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation inside the cave. He had washed away his fatigue, but he didn't leave immediately, planning to stay a while longer.</p><p>He would depart only after the Star Conch had accumulated enough true essence and its power had been restored.</p><p>The Star Conch had saved him from danger many times, and he didn't want to be like its previous owner, whose insufficient refinement of the conch resulted in inadequate power.</p><p>Moreover, having confirmed the effectiveness of the Heavenly Demon Transformation, he felt more confident and dared to remain alone in the Demon Sea.</p><p>"Other cultivators who consume the Fiend Demon Pill also have demonic aura, but it's useless. The Heavenly Demon Transformation is truly peculiar..."</p><p>Qin Sang performed the Heavenly Demon Transformation, his divine sense repeatedly sweeping over the phoenix wings.</p><p>He stood up, gathering water and transforming it into ice, forming a mirror.</p><p>Who was the person reflected in the mirror?</p><p>He had a jade-like face, like a youth, but his eyes held a calmness and determination that didn't match his appearance.</p><p>Behind him, phoenix wings spread, shimmering with radiant light. Bathed in the ethereal glow, he resembled a descendant of the phoenix, with an immortal air and a dazzling divine presence.</p><p>Qin Sang had never deliberately altered his appearance. Even when his foundation was damaged and his face aged, he hadn't cared.</p><p>Only after consuming the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and the Three Light Jade Liquid did his youthful appearance return.</p><p>As the saying goes, appearances reflect the heart. He was long past the age of relying on his looks.</p><p>After years of cultivation and numerous trials, his temperament had subtly changed. Even if he were ugly, others wouldn't be able to ignore him.</p><p>"Fortunately, it only added some demonic aura. Otherwise, I really don't know what I would become if I cultivated this technique to its peak. Heavenly Demon Body Refinement allows demons to comprehend their bloodline's divine abilities, follow their ancestors' path, and transform into Heavenly Demons. I used the Jade Buddha's power to forcefully make it work, and even the Heavenly Demon I visualized was a puppet illusion. This is probably a deviant path. How far can I go?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, feeling somewhat lost.</p><p>He guessed that no other cultivator had been able to cultivate this technique before, so it was impossible to learn from the experience of predecessors. He could only explore on his own.</p><p>"I'll take it one step at a time. At least it's going smoothly for now. As long as I can cultivate to the third level and open the sword path, it will be enough. Before Nascent Soul, I should still focus on the 'Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter' and not expect too much from the 'Heavenly Demon Body Refinement'..."</p><p>Qin Sang sat down cross-legged, continuing to comprehend the Heavenly Demon Transformation and waiting for the Star Conch.</p><p>...</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>The Two-Headed Snake soared swiftly over the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang held a sea chart in his hand. "I observed the stars last night. This place isn't far from Miluo Island, another large island. The island lord of Miluo Island is also a Nascent Soul cultivator. He had previously agreed to join forces with the island lord of Yuheng Island, but he didn't appear during the beast tide siege. I wonder what happened..."</p><p>As he neared Miluo Island, Qin Sang paused, summoned the Two-Headed Snake back, concealed his aura, and cautiously approached.</p><p>Finally catching sight of Miluo Island, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed, and he flew back the way he came!</p><p>"The island is swarming with demons!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave. With just a quick glance, he saw that Miluo Island was overflowing with demonic aura, a paradise for demonic beasts, without a single cultivator in sight.</p><p>"When was Miluo Island breached by the beast tide?"</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly astonished, now understanding why there were no reinforcements. Miluo Island had also suffered disaster.</p><p>With the island occupied by demonic beasts and no battlefield in sight, it was unclear whether the island lord had abandoned the island or been driven out after a fierce battle.</p><p>Two Nascent Soul ancestral grounds being breached simultaneously â€“ such a thing hadn't happened in a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly had an ominous premonition. It was likely that these weren't the only two places affected.</p><p>"No! I must return to Great Desolation Island as soon as possible. If the Demon Sea undergoes a massive change and the teleportation array is sealed, I might not be able to go back. With the Heavenly Demon Transformation, I don't need to worry about my safety in the Demon Sea. But the nascent fetus within my externalized body will soon be formed, and I must nurture it personally. Besides, the Hairy Mountain Vine was sent back to Great Desolation Island. As long as it hasn't been sent back to the Inner Sea, I have a chance to obtain it."</p><p>Qin Sang bypassed Miluo Island and continued toward Great Desolation Island along the sea route.</p><p>This time, he and the Two-Headed Snake traveled almost non-stop, not daring to linger in the Demon Sea for too long.</p><p>Soon, he reached a third island and saw from afar flying demonic beasts circling in the sky, playing and frolicking, their cries filled with joy.</p><p>"A third one, also occupied by demonic beasts! This sea route is practically cut off!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank further. What made him even more anxious was that he still didn't know what had happened.</p><p>He had encountered other cultivators along the way, also escapees from Yuheng Island, who were equally clueless.</p><p>From them, he learned some details about the night of the breakout.</p><p>Qin Sang declined their invitations to travel together and decided to plan his own route to reach Great Desolation Island as quickly as possible. After all, nowhere in the Demon Sea was safe now.</p>
