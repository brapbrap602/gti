<h1></h1><p>“A trap!”</p><p>Guai Lian Ren's face darkened.</p><p>After entering the Ice Instrument Palace, they first passed through the Qilin Mural, then braved the Ice Palace.  Along the way, they hadn't found any unusual traces, assuming they were the first to arrive.  Unexpectedly, the Ice Instrument Palace had already been infiltrated.  The enemy's understanding of the palace surpassed imagination, allowing them to manipulate its grand formation!</p><p>A terrifying, howling gale swept through, turning the world a stark white.</p><p>The waters of the Ice Lake rose into water dragons, coiling towards the heavens.</p><p>Deep within the gale, banner shadows faintly materialized.  These colossal shadows, each the size of a palace, reached between heaven and earth.  As the banners unfurled, the gale intensified.</p><p>These shadows were reflections of the treasure banners at the formation's core.  The chilling煞 energy they emitted stirred the ethereal blue light, fully awakening the residual power of the formation within the Ice Lake area.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's plan, this power alone wasn't enough!</p><p>Deep within the all-encompassing blue light, tremors rippled.  Following closely, spatial vortexes manifested one after another where the light shuddered.</p><p>Within the vortexes, light and shadow coalesced, and new banner shadows flickered into existence.</p><p>These banner shadows were the nodes of the Ice Palace's grand formation.</p><p>Though mere reflections of shattered banners, fractured and on the verge of collapse, they would unleash their final might before destruction!</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The scene above the Ice Palace could only be described as apocalyptic.</p><p>In an instant, the ethereal blue light lost its tranquility, erupting into a furious tempest.  Layers of luminous waves surged over the rows of palaces, pressing down on the Ice Lake with breathtaking force.</p><p>White mists, actually fine ice particles—signs of the palaces' destruction—rose from various parts of the Ice Palace.</p><p>The protective restrictions on many palaces had long since vanished, leaving them reliant solely on the ethereal blue light for support.  With the light in turmoil, the Ice Instrument Palace lost its serenity.  Many palaces, caught in the onslaught, were toppled and crushed, leaving the Ice Instrument Palace in ruins.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>…</p><p>The sounds of collapse continued, chaos spreading from all directions towards the Ice Lake, converging there at last!</p><p>At this moment, a careful observer would notice that the luminous waves surging towards the Ice Lake were only a part of the ethereal blue light, emanating from areas with remnants of banner shadows.</p><p>After all, it was a broken formation.</p><p>In areas without banner shadows, even Qin Sang's transformation, holding the ice disc, was powerless.  The ethereal blue light in those areas merely trembled from the aftershocks, remaining beyond his control.</p><p>Otherwise, this battle would have been much easier!</p><p>All the remaining banners moved in unison, propelling the luminous waves in a concerted assault on the Ice Lake.</p><p>In a flash, the air above the Ice Lake became a swirling mixture of blue and white, where the icy gale and the ethereal blue light intertwined and merged.</p><p>Within this chaotic scene, banner shadows stood in multitudes.</p><p>The broken formation's power was pushed to its absolute limit.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The banner shadows plunged down, piercing the Ice Lake!</p><p>Standing on the jade bridge, Guai Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu felt their breath catch as they witnessed the terrifying celestial phenomenon wrought by the broken formation.  An invisible pressure descended, and a deep sense of danger seized their hearts.</p><p>Just then, a piercing buzz emanated from Guai Lian Ren's chest.  The wooden bead hovering there radiated brilliantly, then shot skyward, emitting a dense green light.</p><p>With the bead as its center, the green light formed a protective barrier above Guai Lian Ren's head.</p><p>The change occurred in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The scene over the Ice Lake transformed, reflected in Guai Lian Ren's eyes.</p><p>He saw the jade bridge connected to the main hall and breathed a sigh of relief.  Had they not been drawn to the Heartless Pavilion, inadvertently changing their path, they would now be on that bridge, surrounded by banner shadows and trapped within the formation.</p><p>However, the mastermind behind the scenes continued to manipulate the broken formation, directing the banner shadows and the formation's power to engulf the bridge they stood upon!</p><p>Guai Lian Ren acted decisively, flashing back in retreat.</p><p>Simultaneously, a field of flowers unfurled above Qi Ling Dong Zhu’s head.</p><p>At the onset of the change, he reacted according to his previous experience.  Quickly realizing something was amiss, he swiftly activated his red flower treasure for protection, mirroring Guai Lian Ren’s decision to retreat.</p><p>At that moment, another change occurred!</p><p>The sound of a sword cry echoed from behind.</p><p>Both Guai Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu felt a sharp sting at the back of their heads, their faces changing color.</p><p>Not only was someone manipulating the broken formation, but someone was also lying in wait behind them!</p><p>Doubt gnawed at them. Who was ambushing them?</p><p>At one end of the jade bridge, Qin Sang's true body appeared alongside the Golden Deep Sword.</p><p>His gaze was grave as he fixed his eyes on their retreating figures, his left hand discreetly clutching a piece of down.</p><p>This down was a gift from the Myriad Venom Mountain, said to contain the power of their most prized treasure.  They claimed it could trigger Guai Lian Ren's hidden ailment, delivering a fatal blow.</p><p>When Su Zi Nan opened the Hall of Delusions, Qin Sang had noticed the scar on Guai Lian Ren's face fading.  This time, it was even fainter.</p><p>Given this, Qin Sang doubted the down’s effectiveness against Guai Lian Ren at his near-peak condition and wouldn't gamble solely on this external object.</p><p>Ultimately, he didn't activate the down immediately, adhering to his plan.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Golden Deep Sword transformed into a rainbow of sword light, streaking through the air.  It wasn't aimed at either of them but at the space between them.</p><p>Before they could react, the sword light vanished.  Then, the space darkened as countless fine sword threads materialized, crisscrossing the void.</p><p>The Seven Souls Slaughter Formation was unleashed!</p><p>And it targeted both Guai Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu simultaneously.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying killing intent from behind, Guai Lian Ren's heart lurched.  He struck his chest with his palm, releasing a green light that enveloped an object.</p><p>It was the wooden armor that had once withstood the Four-Carriage Serpent Seal.</p><p>The armor materialized, followed by a surge of life-affirming green light.  It vanished from its original spot, replaced by the phantom of a towering ancient tree that shielded Guai Lian Ren.</p><p>The ancient tree was verdant, its branches lush and overflowing with vitality.</p><p>Like a real tree, it rooted itself on the jade bridge.</p><p>Attacked from both sides, unaware of the enemy's strength, Guai Lian Ren immediately abandoned his retreat, leaping off the jade bridge with a powerful push.</p><p>‘Swish, swish, swish…’</p><p>The sword threads lashed out, causing the ancient tree's green light to dim slightly.</p><p>A grating sound filled the air as the ancient tree swayed.  Not only was it not pierced by the sword threads, but it barely showed any marks.  The sword formation seemed more bark than bite, far less powerful than Guai Lian Ren anticipated.</p><p>At this moment, a realization struck him, and he abruptly turned to Qi Ling Dong Zhu.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's feint.  Attacking Guai Lian Ren was a diversion, forcing him to focus on self-preservation while the brunt of the sword formation's power fell upon Qi Ling Dong Zhu.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>Qi Ling Dong Zhu roared in fury, his face crimson with rage.</p><p>The red flower treasure spun rapidly, its form a blur, leaving only a red vortex in the air.</p><p>Red light poured into the flower field, causing countless flower shadows to split, revealing tormented human faces.  These distorted faces were the malicious spirits meticulously refined by Qi Ling Dong Zhu.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The malicious spirits opened their eyes in unison.</p><p>Their empty eyes lacked pupils, only white orbs staring out.</p><p>The tormented expressions on their faces gradually subsided, replaced by a fixed gaze directed at the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation and Qin Sang standing on the bridge, appearing even more sinister than before.</p><p>A chilling ‘Wooo’ echoed, like the wails of malevolent ghosts.</p><p>The flower shadows in the field twisted, merging with the faces of the malicious spirits, forming grotesque humanoid figures bathed in the red light emanating from the flower, as if stained with blood.</p><p>In the next instant, Qi Ling Dong Zhu unleashed the malicious spirits.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The red flower, carrying a portion of the malicious spirits, soared upward to intercept the approaching banner shadows of the broken formation.</p><p>The majority of the malicious spirits charged towards the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, their massed forms resembling a river of blood in the air.  The scene was akin to countless evil ghosts surging through the Yellow Springs.</p><p>A river of blood traversed the void above the jade bridge, crashing into the sword formation.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The sword threads blazed brightly, shredding the malicious spirits.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the spirits seemed endless, ferociously tearing at the sword threads without fear of death.</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed from above as the red flower treasure collided with the banner shadows.  The crimson, malevolent light clashed with the overwhelming ethereal blue light, creating a stark dividing line.</p><p>Soon, the different colored lights began to merge, devouring each other, blurring the boundary.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, the result wasn't crucial.</p><p>Qi Ling Dong Zhu, dividing his attention, fended off attacks from both sides, seeking only to escape this perilous situation!</p><p>His figure flickered, preparing to flee.</p><p>Suddenly, a suction force erupted from beneath the jade bridge!</p><p>Both Guai Lian Ren and Qi Ling Dong Zhu's attention was fixed on the spirit formation and Qin Sang.</p><p>Neither had noticed a small cluster of white light hidden within the ethereal blue light.</p><p>Within the white light was a bone, wrapped in a thin glove.</p><p>The bone, smooth and luminous like jade, was encircled by fine blood threads.  Coupled with the glove, it appeared eerily captivating.  It was the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand.</p><p>Deciding on an ambush, Qin Sang's transformation had hidden the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand within the Ice Lake, setting a trap.</p><p>Of course, the Blood Crocodile Bone Hand was originally meant for the other jade bridge.  Thus, Qin Sang's true body needed to summon it, delaying its activation slightly.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The glove, refined from a demon core, landed on Qin Sang’s true body’s hand, followed by an earth-shattering roar.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang had used this treasure against an enemy since its refinement.  However, he vividly remembered confronting the thousand-zhang giant crocodile, giving him confidence in this treasure's power.</p><p>The roar boomed like thunder, shaking the jade bridge violently.</p><p>Waves erupted on the lake's surface as a point of white light shot out.  The bone's energy exploded, and the phantom of a thousand-zhang giant crocodile leaped from within, roaring towards the heavens, its ferocity boundless.</p><p>Beside the giant crocodile, even the banner shadows seemed diminutive.</p><p>The crocodile's form solidified, transforming into a monstrous beast.  It crouched on the Ice Lake, its head raised, fixated on Qi Ling Dong Zhu on the jade bridge, radiating pure killing intent.</p><p>Opening its massive jaws, a black hole appeared in its throat, and a suction force emanated from within, its visible ripples targeting Qi Ling Dong Zhu.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The suction force expanded relentlessly, spreading outward from Qi Ling Dong Zhu.  The lake surface bulged, water rushing upwards and being sucked into the crocodile's belly, drawing in the ethereal blue light and the icy gale as well.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The already overburdened jade bridge finally collapsed, its countless fragments swirling into the crocodile's maw.</p><p>But Qi Ling Dong Zhu was the true target of the suction!</p><p>Caught off guard and forced to divide his attention between the broken formation and the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, Qi Ling Dong Zhu had no energy left to counter the suction.</p><p>His robes billowed, ripples spreading across them.</p><p>Suddenly, sword light flashed, slicing through the robes.  The Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, having annihilated the malicious spirits, attacked again.  Terror filled Qi Ling Dong Zhu's face as he hurriedly recalled the red flower for protection.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The banner shadows, now unopposed, descended directly.</p><p>Before Qi Ling Dong Zhu could escape the suction, he was pulled into the broken formation along with the surrounding water.</p><p>The ethereal blue light pressed down, obscuring the chaotic scene.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>Qi Ling Dong Zhu’s desperate cry was the last thing heard before he vanished.</p><p>Guai Lian Ren hovered above the lake.  Neither Qin Sang nor the broken formation targeted him, leaving him unscathed.  He turned to see Qi Ling Dong Zhu’s plight and discreetly gestured with his finger.  The wooden armor transformed into a streak of light, shooting towards Qi Ling Dong Zhu.</p><p>The situation was clear.  One opponent manipulated the broken formation from the shadows, while the other launched a sneak attack.  There were no other helpers.  Their disadvantage stemmed from being caught off guard and their lack of knowledge about their opponents.</p><p>If he could rescue Qi Ling Dong Zhu and escape the Ice Palace, negating the enemy's geographical advantage, the victor was still uncertain!</p><p>Just then, a figure moved faster than the wooden armor, rushing towards the broken formation.  It was Qin Sang's true body.</p><p>Pulling Qi Ling Dong Zhu into the broken formation wasn't merely to trap him.  Qin Sang's aim was to cripple Guai Lian Ren, taking this opportunity to eliminate him!</p><p>Guai Lian Ren watched Qin Sang coldly, a sinister expression on his face.  He clenched his left hand discreetly, the Jade Beetle resting quietly in his palm as he flicked it out.</p><p>The Jade Beetle took flight.</p><p>Now, its eyes held no trace of bloodlust.  It appeared to be a harmless little beetle, belying its true nature as a deadly insect!</p><p>The wooden armor’s rescue attempt was another feint.</p><p>Earlier, with Qin Sang positioned at the bridgehead, too far away, and the suddenness of the attack coupled with the unknown enemy, Guai Lian Ren had kept the Jade Beetle concealed in his hand, biding his time.</p><p>Until now, striking at the perfect moment!</p><p>Anticipating Qin Sang's trajectory, the Jade Beetle's mandibles parted slightly, emitting a venomous light.</p><p>The venomous light was incredibly swift, even faster than the attack on Lu Zhang, arriving in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Had Qin Sang not been aware of Guai Lian Ren’s methods, he might have already been struck.  Without the Venomous Silkworm by his side, despite possessing the venomous pearl extracted from it, he wouldn’t dare to directly face the Jade Beetle's venom.  Prepared in advance, his escaping light halted abruptly, then veered, effortlessly avoiding the venomous light, continuing towards Qi Ling Dong Zhu.</p><p>Even the cunning Guai Lian Ren was taken aback.</p><p>He had great confidence in the Venom King’s abilities.</p><p>Its venom was lethal.</p><p>He never expected his opponent to anticipate it, neutralizing the threat with ease.</p><p>The confidence in Guai Lian Ren’s eyes vanished as he hastily recalled the Jade Beetle.  Then, feeling a chilling presence lock onto him, his heart lurched.  He turned sharply, his eyes widening in shock at the figure standing on the opposite shore of the Ice Lake.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Understanding dawned upon Guai Lian Ren.</p><p>No wonder he sensed pure wood spiritual energy here!</p><p>No wonder the opponent anticipated the Venom King's attack!</p><p>He never imagined the person he had been searching for would appear at the Formless Immortal Sect, ambushing him!</p><p>The newcomer was Qin Sang's transformation.</p><p>Having triggered the broken formation's power, the transformation had no further role to play, nor could it do more.</p><p>The Ice Palace's grand formation was at its end, forcibly activated for one final display of its former glory.  After this battle, the formation would meet its demise.</p><p>Emerging from the hidden chamber, the transformation appeared by the Ice Lake, fixing a cold gaze upon Guai Lian Ren, his voice chilling.</p><p>“Greetings, Fellow Daoist.  I trust you've been well."</p>
