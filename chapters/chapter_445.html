<h1>Chapter 438: The Call to Arms</h1><p>Chapter 438: The Call to Arms</p><p>You Luo Yun sped silently across the water.</p><p>The medicinal garden was in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng concealed themselves, disabling the garden's protective barrier.</p><p>Upon entering, they found Jie Ying and the others were not in seclusion, but gathered outside, anxiously watching beyond the barrier.  Seeing Qin Sang, relief washed over their faces.</p><p>"This is our fellow disciple, Brother Mu…"</p><p>Qin Sang introduced Mu Yifeng.</p><p>Jie Ying bowed to Mu Yifeng, then urgently turned to Qin Sang, asking repeatedly, "Brother Qin, did you sense anything amiss outside?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, asking in return, "What have you noticed?"</p><p>Jie Ying, his face filled with worry, said, "A short while ago, many cultivators flew past overhead, hurrying north. It's never been this frequent before. Then, two patrol teams headed south together.  They were moving very fast. Something must have happened in the south! Could it be…a major battle?"</p><p>"Patrol teams heading south?  It seems someone has returned, and Stargazing Island has received news."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Mu Yifeng.</p><p>On their way back, they had also seen many cultivators fleeing north, but no patrol teams.</p><p>Mu Yifeng gave a wry smile. "I'm registered with Stargazing Island; I have no choice but to return and report what I know, awaiting orders. However, my injuries are severe, and my magical tools are badly damaged, greatly reducing my combat effectiveness. I shouldn't be deployed anytime soon. Brother Qin, you don't need to get involved in this mess. As planned, I'll just ask you to take me near Stargazing Island, and then you can leave…"</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement.</p><p>The *Spirit Cultivating Sword Chapter* requires battle experience and comprehension of killing talismans, but this must be done while ensuring personal safety.</p><p>With the war beginning and the situation unclear, this is the most chaotic time. The best option is to leave and lay low, waiting for things to settle before making any decisions.</p><p>"Brother Jie, immediately harvest the ripe herbs, seal the barrier, and leave with me."</p><p>Jie Ying and the others were overjoyed, immediately following Qin Sang's orders, each performing their duties. Soon, they harvested all the ripe herbs, putting them into storage pouches and handing them to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Qin Sang sealed the garden's barrier, then summoned You Luo Yun. The cloud enveloped everyone.</p><p>Including Mu Yifeng, You Luo Yun carried fourteen people.</p><p>The Qi Refinement disciples were too low-level; Qin Sang had to take them all, significantly slowing You Luo Yun's speed.</p><p>They saw two other cultivators fleeing north in the distance, but they didn't know them and avoided any contact.</p><p>Their journey was uneventful until they neared their destination.</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous roar startled them.</p><p>This was… the sound of cultivators flying at high speed!</p><p>Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng exchanged glances, their faces slightly changing. They abruptly rose, leaving You Luo Yun, and flew to a high vantage point to observe.  The sight that greeted them made them gasp.</p><p>More than twenty streaks of light were hurtling through the sky.</p><p>Flying swords, magical ships, spirit boats, shuttles, and遁 needles…</p><p>All kinds of flying magical tools, dazzling and complete.</p><p>It was like a grand exhibition of flying magical tools.</p><p>They flew recklessly at high altitudes, their various colored lights interweaving, creating a magnificent and formidable spectacle as they sped south, approaching their location.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang didn't hesitate, immediately turning back to You Luo Yun and diving toward the water below.</p><p>Jie Ying and the others didn't know what was happening. Seeing Qin Sang's serious expression, they were apprehensive, remaining motionless within the cloud.</p><p>However, they had barely submerged a few meters when they heard a cold snort, right beside their ears.</p><p>"Get out!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a buzzing in his head, his body trembling violently, his spiritual energy threatening to dissipate. You Luo Yun lost control and scattered.</p><p>Then, a tremendous suction force came from above.</p><p>A water spout lifted everyone, throwing them out of the water.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The water spout burst, and Qin Sang and the others fell from the sky like dumplings, landing clumsily in the water. Looking up, they saw a figure materialize above them, as if emerging from the void.</p><p>This person looked to be only in his early twenties, unremarkable in appearance, yet possessed an aura unlike anyone else. Standing calmly, he became the focal point of the entire area, impossible to ignore.</p><p>Especially his eyes, incredibly sharp, as if they could see through one's heart.</p><p>Sensing a powerful and enigmatic aura emanating from the person, Qin Sang's heart tightened.  Ignoring the water clinging to her body, she quickly rose and bowed, about to introduce herself, but Mu Yifeng was faster, dropping to one knee before him.  "Mu Yifeng, of Shaohua Mountain's patrol guard, greets Deputy Island Master Xiao!"</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao!</p><p>Could it be the Deputy Island Master of Guanxing Island?</p><p>Quick-witted, Qin Sang followed Mu Yifeng's lead, saying, "Qin Sang, of Shaohua Mountain, greets Deputy Island Master Xiao!"</p><p>"Both from Shaohua Mountain?"</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao's gaze swept over them.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his gaze like two sharp swords, her body stiffening, unable to move.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw figures flying in from the north, two of them looking familiar.  She recalled encountering them earlier, and a sense of foreboding washed over her.</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao finally fixed his gaze on Mu Yifeng, his expression darkening.  He coldly demanded, "Where were you going?"</p><p>Mu Yifeng explained, "Reporting to Deputy Island Master Xiao, I was escorting Elder Fang and Elder Shen Tu when we were ambushed by Tianxing League thugs.  On Elder Fang's orders, I broke through the encirclement to return to Guanxing Island for reinforcements.  I was nearly killed by the Tianxing League pursuit, but luckily, Brother Qin saved me.  We were about to return to Guanxing Island to report the situation when we saw you approach, unsure if you were friend or foe, we took this course of action.  Please forgive our transgression!"</p><p>After hearing Mu Yifeng's explanation, Deputy Island Master Xiao grunted, his expression softening slightly.  He said calmly, "No need to return to Guanxing Island. All Foundation Establishment cultivators, listen up.  Follow me south."</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this.</p><p>Xie Ying and Mao Ji's faces turned pale, their eyes filled with terror, as they looked to Qin Sang for help.</p><p>Qin Sang pretended not to see them.</p><p>She could barely protect herself, let alone intervene on their behalf.</p><p>The Deputy Island Master of Guanxing Island—the significance of that title was extraordinary, representing the terrifying authority granted by the major sects of Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>The power of life and death was no exaggeration!</p><p>To disobey his command was tantamount to suicide.</p><p>Seeing those two people among the group, Qin Sang had a premonition.</p><p>She hadn't expected the change to happen so quickly.  She had hurried, losing almost no time, yet she was still too late, unable to escape the vortex of slaughter.</p><p>Before Qin Sang and the others could speak, Deputy Island Master Xiao changed his tone, questioning Mu Yifeng about what he had witnessed.</p>
