      Frenzied Sword and the others responded to the players’
                enthusiasm before pushing their way through the crowd and
                walking up to Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      These players were the ones who had first followed him into the
                universe, and the majority of them had been god-level players in
                his previous life. Han Xiao had always treated them differently.
                At this moment, he did not exchange any pleasantries with them
                but said directly, “You guys are late.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The players were stunned for a moment. From Black Star’s tone,
                it was obvious that he treated them as one of his own, and they
                had a special feeling in their hearts.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      When they were on the spaceship, they had found out that the
                other players were also able to join the Black Star Mercenary
                Group, and they were no longer the only ones who enjoyed such a
                privilege. They had all felt extremely helpless toward that
                matter. But at that moment, they all realized that ‘old birds’
                like them still got special treatment.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Now that they had returned to Black Star’s side, they
                immediately felt at ease.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Actually, expanding isn’t entirely a bad thing,” Hao Tian said.
                “The Black Star Mercenary Group is a faction with the potential
                for growth. Only when the members of the faction increase will
                the growth of the benefits that the faction can provide be
                rapid.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The other professional players agreed. Indeed, with more
                players, the faction would be able to grow quickly, and this was
                not a bad thing for the professional players in China.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      However, while they all understood this logic, they still felt
                miserable that they were not able to have Black Star solely for
                themselves!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      During Version 1.0, Han Xiao had made use of Bun-Hit-Dog’s
                videos to plant a concept in the players’ minds. This concept
                was that his faction would continue growing as they completed
                more and more missions. This made the players feel as though
                they are able to contribute to the growth of the faction and
                gain more benefits from it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Currently, this concept was not deeply ingrained in the hearts
                of the players yet. When the players entered the galaxy and more
                players personally experienced this point for themselves, not
                only would they fervently complete missions, they would also
                call their friends to join Black Star. Conning one would recover
                his costs, and conning two would allow him to earn double.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Furthermore, as the players toiled away for the faction, their
                sense of belonging toward the faction would also grow, and this
                was a part of the Great Mechanic Han’s plans.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Those professional players did not delay and also found Han Xiao
                to learn new skills. They were looking forward to seeing Han
                Xiao again because they realized their advantage; only they had
                Enas!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The few of them had already gone to the galaxy and had the
                initiative in their hands. Han Xiao allowed them to be wealthy,
                and while the players on Planet Aquamarine could only stare at
                the items in the faction store and drool, they already had the
                capability to purchase those items.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “There are quite a few new items in the store and also a lot of
                Advanced Knowledge.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “There is new Sunil armor? The simplified version of the
                Commander Class armor has much higher specs than the NCO Class
                armor. A pity there is a level restriction.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Electromagnetic Shield. This item isn’t too bad either. I don’t
                remember seeing this item before the update.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Everyone had a face full of curiosity. There were many new
                products in the faction store, and they were truly spoilt for
                choice. After discussing for a while, they all bought the items
                that they wanted with the bulk being Advanced Knowledge. In any
                case, they definitely would not lose out if they bought
                knowledge. They had seen the market price of the Advanced
                Knowledge in the galaxy before, and it was no different from
                cheating them from their money. The benefits of the Black Star
                faction store were still the best. A single Advanced Knowledge
                only required around 10,000 Enas, which was almost half the
                market price.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The criteria to purchase Advanced Knowledge was to spend 1,500
                Faction Contribution Points. All of these players only had a few
                hundred Contribution Points. Below 1,000 Contribution Points,
                100 Contribution Points could be exchanged with 50 Enas. From
                1000 Contribution Points to 3000 Contribution Points, 100
                Contribution Points needed 500 Enas to exchange. But even so,
                spending a little more than 10,000 Enas to purchase an Advanced
                Knowledge was far cheaper than the market price in the galaxy.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Before the update, these players had followed Han Xiao for six
                to seven missions. Taking away the repair fees and expenditure
                on new equipment, they still had twenty to thirty thousand Enas.
                Thus, they immediately contributed a large sum to Han Xiao the
                moment Version 2.0 began.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In less than five minutes, he earned more than 600,000 Enas!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao felt a warm and cozy feeling in his heart.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Only if the players were rich would he be able to harvest them.
                This batch of players that he had taken into the galaxy was his
                first batch of crops. Han Xiao had already verified the
                feasibility of his plan, and this harvest was within his
                expectations.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      For him to have Frenzied Sword and the others back, apart from
                letting them spend money and sucking their wallets dry, Han Xiao
                had another target. It was for them to become an example.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The other players did not have any money, so let them watch the
                rich people from afar and feel the difference.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Intentionally creating different social classes to create
                conflict. This move of Han Xiao’s was truly a dirty one. As Han
                Xiao observed the surroundings, he saw many players with faces
                full of envy and longing.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Originally, all of them had been poor peasants who did not have
                any money, but now that they saw Frenzied Sword and the others
                buying the items that they could not afford like a bunch of
                nouveau riche, a more intense desire was immediately ignited in
                their hearts. Even though Han Xiao had already whetted the
                appetites of the players to the point that they were drooling,
                Han Xiao did not mind taking out a few new dishes for them to
                see.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was the most proficient in making them drool!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After settling the requests of Frenzied Sword and the others,
                the sky was getting dark, and the sun was setting.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao did not continue to stay behind and gave Frenzied Sword
                and the others a mission to help the Sanctuary before leaving
                the plaza. He still had other things to do and would not stay
                there from day to night.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       I should increase my level first. After the slight delay, I
                  almost forgot about this matter.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Opening up the interface, Han Xiao threw all of the experience
                which he had just earned and finally heard the sound of him
                leveling up again.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">_____________________</p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [War Mechanic] leveled up to Level20 (max).
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">

     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      You have received 6 Free Attribute Points.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      You have received 1 Potential Point.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">_____________________</p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Your total level has reached 120. You have triggered the next
                phase of the Promotion Mission.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Level 120 Promotion Mission [Energy Secret]: Energy Level reach
                Level 10.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">_____________________</p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Eh? It is actually this Promotion Mission.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s brows were raised, and he was pretty surprised.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [Energy Secret] was not a common mission. It was not a difficult
                one since he did not need to battle, but it needed quite a bit
                of time. It required the character’s Energy Level to reach a
                certain standard, and this standard would definitely be higher
                than one’s current level.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Now that he was level 120, Han Xiao’s energy was at 8,360
                points, and it was still level 9. This meant that his energy
                would give him the level 9 bonus stat. The concept of Energy
                Level could also be understood as something similar to the
                internal energy cultivation realms.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Whenever his energy hit a certain number of points, he would
                receive a new level of bonus stats. When he used his skills and
                exhausted energy, causing his energy to fall below a certain
                level, he would temporarily lose the bonus stat of that level,
                and his overall stats would temporarily be lowered. It was akin
                to him being exhausted in battle and causing his combat ability
                to decline.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      One’s stats would be at their peak only when one’s energy was
                the most abundant.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Level 10 Energy Level required 9,000 points of energy, and Han
                Xiao was still a few hundred points away. This small gap was not
                difficult to fill. As long as he found one to two Energy
                Training Techniques and trained them up to the maximum, he would
                be able to complete the mission.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In his previous life, increasing one’s energy level had been a
                way to increase one’s strength after reaching max level. Many
                players would find NPCs to learn new Energy Training Techniques,
                hoping to reach a new Energy Level so that their stats would
                receive a great boost.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       This Promotion Mission isn’t too difficult. Bennett, Herlous,
                  or Harmon should have different Energy Training Techniques,
                  and with our current relationship, the three of them shouldn’t
                  reject sharing it with me…
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded. Since the Promotion Mission was not difficult,
                he would save his Mission Completion Card to use later.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Apart from the Promotion Mission, there was also the Class
                Advancement Mission for his Mechanic class.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">_____________________</p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Class Advancement Requirements: Learn any one of the following
                three High-End Knowledges and increase it to the maximum level:
                [Huge Duplex Machinery Technology], [Super Nanotechnology], or
                [Advanced Artificial Intelligence Technology].
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Note: Your choice of knowledge will determine the outcome of
                your Class Advancement.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">_____________________</p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      This mission was within Han Xiao’s expectations. The next Class
                Advancement requirement of [War Mechanic] was fixed, and every
                Mechanic class player would have the same mission.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      During the first Class Advancement mission of a Mechanic, they
                would face the choice between three different routes: Cannon
                Master, Mechanical Pugilist and Machinery Master. At this
                current phase, Mechanics faced another new choice. They would
                have to choose between the Armed, Control, or Energy branches to
                specialize in.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      [Huge Duplex Machinery Technology] would be to walk down the
                path of large sized machinery, [Super Nanotechnology] walked
                down the path of nanotechnology, and [Advanced Artificial
                Intelligence Technology] would walk the path of virtual
                technology. All three paths had their own advantages and
                disadvantages, and one would still be able to learn the
                knowledge from the other subclasses after the Class Advancement.
                It was just that they would place an emphasis on different
                skills.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Just like how the knowledge of Cannon Masters, Mechanical
                Pugilists, and Machinery Masters was the same, but the skills
                that they obtained were different.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Furthermore, the biggest difference would be the number of
                Potential Points required to learn knowledge. For example, if
                one leaned toward the Armed Branch, the final two levels of
                High-End Knowledge of the other two branches would be thrice as
                much.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As for which branch he should choose, Han Xiao did not even need
                to hesitate. He wanted to pick the path of Virtual Technology.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      There were a few reasons for that. First, he would definitely
                meet high ranked Mechanics in the future, and Virtual Technology
                would allow him to prevent his own machines from being
                controlled by the opponent. If not, his machines might end up
                being infiltrated and snatched by his enemy. In his previous
                life, he had suffered plenty of losses because of this. While
                the Armed and Energy Branches seemed extremely cool, they were
                not as important as the insignificant looking Virtual
                Technology. Regardless of how powerful his machines were, the
                moment his enemy infiltrated his machines, they were no
                different from scrap metal, and they might even end up attacking
                him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Second was because Han Xiao was not afraid of the high cost of
                Potential Points. An ordinary player would find it impossible to
                learn all the knowledge of a class as the sky-high prices would
                cause them to despair. However, this was not impossible for Han
                Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As long as he had the huge experience farm called the players,
                his speed of collecting experience would be many times quicker
                than the players. As long as he increased all of his skills to
                their maximum levels, he could slowly save up Potential Points.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Thus, the negative impact was not that great for him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       I still have another 200,000,000 experience points. I won’t
                  rush to complete my Class Advancement. I’ll first complete my
                  Promotion Mission and accumulate more experience. At that
                  time, I can level up in a single go.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao looked at his level 120 stats and threw all of his Free
                Attribute Points into Intelligence. He had finally broken the
                barrier of 900 points. Following which, he closed the interface
                and returned to his residence.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      An independent sector was carved out in the core region of the
                Sanctuary for him and the mercenaries to stay in.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Pa!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After making the last corner, Han Xiao suddenly stopped his
                footsteps. Bennett was waiting outside the door for him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Black Star, the Six Nations want to talk to you.” Bennett got
                straight to the point.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “They couldn’t keep still.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s eyes flashed. After waiting for a day, the Six
                Nations had finally made a decision. It was now time for him to
                extort them.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Six Nations in the past had sided with Godora, but now, he
                had the initiative in his hands and arrived before Godora.
     </p>
