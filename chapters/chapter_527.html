<h1>Chapter 520 Adapting to the Situation</h1><p>The caves, as rough-hewn as the stone railings, were concealed only by stone doors, all tightly shut and shimmering with restrictive enchantments.</p><p>Shi Ying, having no companions nor the inclination to socialize, flew directly into her assigned cave.</p><p>The interior was stark and simple, a far cry from a woman's dwelling, resembling Qin Sang's own spartan cave.</p><p>Sealing the entrance, Shi Ying unburdened herself of the black coffin, placing it gently in a corner. She opened it, gazed at the corpse within, and a satisfied smile spread across her face. Settling onto the stone bed in a cross-legged position, she opened her storage pouch.</p><p>In her eyes, no treasure could compare to this refined corpse. Thus, she only refined the few high-quality magical artifacts she had acquired.</p><p>The other items, of lesser quality or unknown purpose, were set aside, unexplored for the time being.</p><p>Shi Ying then sat in meditation before the black coffin, her divine sense connecting with the soul imprint, eager to familiarize herself with the corpse.</p><p>Although she hadn't refined the corpse herself, she found its control surprisingly effortless and intuitive.</p><p>Opening her eyes, her gaze drifted to the corpse's abdomen.</p><p>Even after multiple examinations with her divine sense, she still couldn't quite believe it. There, nestled within the abdomen, was a Golden Core. She couldn't fathom the effort the demonic cultivator must have expended to gather the necessary components, leaving only the Dry Heaven罡qi  remaining.</p><p>"罡sha to charge the Core..."</p><p>Shi Ying murmured, her voice laced with uncertainty.</p><p>Initially, she feared her low cultivation level would hinder the refinement process.  However, she discovered she could manipulate the corpse's power with ease and fluidity.</p><p>The only drawback was the strain on her own spiritual energy, but with sufficient spirit pills and stones for replenishment, she felt confident she could endure.</p><p>This realization bolstered her resolve, and she decided to proceed with a trial run.</p><p>Unbeknownst to her, this seamless control was due to Qin Sang's deliberate cooperation.</p><p>Shi Ying remained blissfully unaware that her refined corpse possessed sentience, masked with impeccable deception.</p><p>A sentient corpse willingly submitting to control and allowing a soul imprint was unheard of, not only to Shi Ying but likely to even seasoned demonic cultivators specializing in corpse refinement. Qin Sang's feat was unprecedented.</p><p>Shi Ying spent the night familiarizing herself with the corpse's power. By dawn, her worries had dissipated. Sealing her cave, she set off towards Mount Divine罡.</p><p>Her cave wasn't far from the mountain, and she soon entered the green mist.</p><p>...</p><p>The cave plunged into darkness.</p><p>The lid of the black coffin slid open soundlessly, and the corpse within slowly sat up, a chilling sight.</p><p>Its dark eyes flickered, gradually regaining intelligence and vitality. Qin Sang, having severed Shi Ying's soul imprint, rotated his neck, surveying the cave.</p><p>He had successfully infiltrated the sect, but deviated from his original plan of immediately subduing Shi Ying. Her actions had sparked a new idea, prompting him to adapt and wait.</p><p>He quickly surmised the reason for her haste.</p><p>Wen Yanjie had reached late-stage Foundation Establishment and was on the cusp of forming a pseudo-core. If Shi Ying delayed, Wen Yanjie might achieve the pseudo-core stage, making him a far more formidable opponent, even with the completed refined corpse.</p><p>Her revenge would remain elusive.</p><p>His alteration of the secret technique had inadvertently spurred Shi Ying into action, an unforeseen consequence.</p><p>This was a favorable turn of events.</p><p>Cultivators of the Azure Yang Demonic Fire could carry a trace of Dry Heaven罡qi  out of Mount Divine罡 for personal cultivation. Since Shi Ying was willing to assist, he might as well accept her help.</p><p>Infiltrating Mount Divine罡 was perilous, and he was still unsure of the viability of Wu Shang's secret technique. The so-called罡qi Infusion was mere conjecture.</p><p>There was no precedent to guide him.</p><p>Having Shi Ying retrieve the Dry Heaven罡qi  while he remained hidden in her cave allowed him to experiment safely. If the technique proved ineffective, he could still escape the Azure Yang Demonic Sect.</p><p>Trespassing on Mount Divine罡 carried significant risks. If the technique failed and his presence was discovered, the consequences would be dire.</p><p>The corpse energy within him remained suppressed, so there was no immediate urgency.</p><p>Qin Sang floated towards the cave entrance, pausing by the stone bed to glance at the storage pouch.</p><p>According to the Azure Yang Sect disciples, the spiritual energy on Mount Divine罡 was chaotic, intensifying towards the summit. Even at the lower levels, low-level disciples struggled to protect themselves and dared not linger, absorbing a sliver of Azure Yang Divine罡 before quickly returning to their caves to refine their demonic fire.</p><p>In case of unforeseen circumstances on the mountain, their priority would be survival, potentially losing their storage pouches in the process.</p><p>A storage pouch was every cultivator's lifeline, too precious to risk. Therefore, before ascending the mountain, low-level disciples would leave their pouches in their caves, protected by unique sect-placed restrictions, safe from theft.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the pouch containing the Azure蚨 Coins and the Void Thunder, alongside similar artifacts he had crafted. Shi Ying, as expected, hadn't noticed anything unusual.</p><p>He didn't retrieve them immediately, instead drifting to the cave entrance, pressing his palm against the restrictive barrier to assess it.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Specks of blue light materialized on the door, converging rapidly towards the center.</p><p>Moments later, a tiny blue flame appeared before him, radiating intense power.</p><p>This was Shi Ying's Azure Yang Demonic Fire, linked to the soul imprint within Qin Sang's primordial spirit, unique to her.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it closely, discerning the unique properties of the Azure Yang Sect's restrictions.</p><p>By imbuing their cultivated Azure Yang Demonic Fire into the barrier, disciples prevented even fellow cultivators of the same fire from imitating it.</p><p>Any attempt to breach the restriction would trigger a conflict between the fires, immediately raising the alarm.</p><p>Although he understood the restriction, Qin Sang dared not tamper with the demonic fire.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he devised a solution, manipulating Shi Ying's soul imprint to interact with the barrier.</p><p>From a sufficient distance, Shi Ying wouldn't detect the imprint's activity. The Azure Yang Demonic Fire, mistaking him for its owner, offered no resistance.</p><p>He didn't venture out, but pushed the stone door ajar, gazing towards the distant Mount Divine罡.</p><p>What a towering peak, reaching for the heavens!</p><p>Qin Sang marveled inwardly. Its grandeur was surpassed only by Sky-pointing Peak among all the mountains he had encountered, even dwarfing Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Truly a peak that touched the sky, worthy of drawing down Dry Heaven罡qi and nurturing罡 Essence!</p><p>From base to summit, he scrutinized the mountain, verifying the information he had gathered.</p><p>Beneath the lingering green mist lay the Azure Yang罡 Essence, increasing in quantity and purity as it ascended towards the peak.</p>
