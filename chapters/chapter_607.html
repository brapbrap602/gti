Chapter 600: Southern Bright Ember Fire


The secret tunnel was extremely deep, almost reaching the heart of the mountain.
The deeper they went, the higher the temperature climbed. It felt like a miniature sun was blazing within, scorching them.
Even with their spiritual energy shielding them, both men were drenched in sweat.
The crimson glow ahead grew increasingly dazzling.
This was a deep red flame, unlike any Qin Sang had ever seen before. It was completely pure, without a trace of any other color.
To Qin Sang's astonishment, he sensed an indescribable sacredness and majesty emanating from the flames, compelling him to bow down in reverence.
In a trance-like state, Qin Sang seemed to see a divine bird bathed in flames, breathtakingly beautiful, its gaze indifferent, looking down upon all creation.
The flickering flames at the edges resembled tragically beautiful feathers.
It truly felt as though an ancient divine bird resided within.
"Could this be a Demonic Fire?"
Qin Sang's face was filled with shock as he turned to ask Yun Youzi.
Yun Youzi, who seemed to be searching for something, his eyes darting back and forth, nodded in response. “It could be the Southern Bright Ember Fire, also known as the Vermillion Bird's True Fire, the legendary sacred beast. It is said that this fire can incinerate anything. In some legends, it’s depicted as white, while others believe it's red, like the Vermillion Bird itself. Whether it truly is the Southern Bright Ember Fire is impossible to verify now, as no one has ever actually seen the Vermillion Bird. However…”
Even though they were still quite far from the Demonic Fire, Yun Youzi stopped, gazing at the flames with a sigh. “The terrifying power of this fire is undeniable. Even if it's not the Vermillion Bird's True Fire, it must be the fire wielded by some other ancient divine bird. The flames we see now are merely a manifestation of the Demonic Fire’s power overflowing. Its true form should be quite small, hidden in the deepest part, undetectable to anyone…”
Qin Sang stared fixedly at this Southern Bright Ember Fire.
The legend of the Vermillion Bird has endured through the ages, a sacred beast alongside immortals.
Now, even cultivators beyond the Deity Transformation stage are nowhere to be seen, let alone such divine beasts.
The Southern Bright Ember Fire, like its master, is also a legendary sacred flame. Many magical artifacts and treasures falsely claim to possess the “Southern Bright Ember Fire,” demonstrating its renown.
However, Qin Sang was now certain that not all of these divine beasts were merely fabricated legends.
The Azure Phoenix was proof!
He had seen the wooden carving of the Azure Phoenix from Granny Jing and knew that she had sensed its aura and seen its true form, indicating that many divine beasts once existed in the world.
However, just like the powerful cultivators, they have all vanished without a trace.
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi stood side by side, experiencing the aura of the Demonic Fire.
Yun Youzi was right, even if it wasn't the Southern Bright Ember Fire, it was still the Demonic Fire of some ancient divine bird.
The aura emanating from this Demonic Fire was even more terrifying than the Nine Nether Demonic Fire described by Patriarch Kui Yin. The seemingly majestic Ancestral Sacred Fire of the Green Sun Devil Sect could only submit in the presence of this Demonic Fire.
And this was merely an insignificant wisp of its true form, while Patriarch Kui Yin encountered a massive amount of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire!
The ancient alchemists of the Violet Firmament Palace actually used the Southern Bright Ember Fire for alchemy, sealing it here. Could it be that they once imprisoned a Vermillion Bird?
Qin Sang couldn't help but imagine the grandeur of the Violet Firmament Palace in its prime, envying the powerful methods of the ancient cultivators.
"Senior, are you planning to subdue this Southern Bright Ember Fire?"
Qin Sang guessed Yun Youzi's purpose. He had mentioned facing a life-or-death tribulation for his healing. Could it be related to the Southern Bright Ember Fire?
Before entering the secret tunnel, Qin Sang had entertained the same idea, wanting to emulate Patriarch Kui Yin and acquire a powerful spiritual fire to enhance his strength.
But after sensing the power of the Southern Bright Ember Fire, Qin Sang immediately abandoned this notion.
The Southern Bright Ember Fire was too terrifying. Such an attempt would be suicidal.
Qin Sang suspected that even a Nascent Soul Patriarch would have to retreat in its presence. No one would dare disturb the Southern Bright Ember Fire. What could Yun Youzi possibly do?
"How could that be possible!"
Yun Youzi chuckled, shaking his head. "Even Nascent Soul Patriarchs and transformed demons wouldn’t dare claim they could subdue the Southern Bright Ember Fire. At least, no one in the Small Cold Territory or the Heavenly Travel Alliance could, not even in their wildest dreams. This old man isn't that arrogant…"
As Qin Sang stared in astonishment, Yun Youzi continued in a calm tone, "I merely intend to throw myself into the Southern Bright Ember Fire, borrowing its power to refine my soul, achieving a rebirth through fire. Whether I emerge as a phoenix or turn to ashes depends on my luck."
Rebirth through fire, soul refinement through Demonic Fire!
Qin Sang was deeply shaken. He thought his path to Core Formation through the Corpse Path was already shocking enough, but Yun Youzi was even more extreme, seeking a sliver of hope from the impossible!
Qin Sang had never heard of such a healing method.
He wondered if Yun Youzi had gone mad.
"Senior, is there truly no other way, is this the only option?"
Qin Sang felt a pang of sympathy. No wonder Yun Youzi kept saying it was a life-or-death situation.
In Qin Sang's view, it was clearly a path to certain death.
Like a moth to a flame.
Throwing oneself into such a terrifying Demonic Fire would instantly reduce one to ashes.
No matter how miraculous the Three Light Jade Liquid was, how much could it truly help?
"Senior, is your injury truly incurable? After we leave the Violet Firmament Palace, I will be able to form my Core. Then, I can accompany you on your travels to search for medicinal pills. The cultivation world is vast; we don't have to limit ourselves to the Small Cold Territory. Perhaps…"
Yun Youzi interrupted Qin Sang, his voice grave. "I have exhausted all methods, and there are no other options. The hidden injuries I suffer are beyond ordinary comprehension. I've searched countless texts and found no precedent. The only way is to break and rebuild. This old man refuses to end his life at the Pseudo Core Formation stage. Even if there's only a sliver of a chance, I must seize it."
Pausing for a moment, Yun Youzi's tone softened. "Don't worry, Brother Qin. If there were no chance at all, I wouldn't throw my life away for nothing. Those three drops of Three Light Jade Liquid will be a great help. Also, I know of something that can resist the burning of the Southern Bright Ember Fire, offering some protection. That's why I asked you to come."
As he spoke, Yun Youzi pointed towards the depths of the secret tunnel. "There's a green copper fragment hidden within, suspected to be a fragment of an ancient alchemy cauldron. The ancient cultivators placed their cauldron on the Southern Bright Ember Fire for alchemy, unafraid of its power. It must have been a divine artifact. Although only a fragment remains, it still retains some of the artifact's power and resistance to the Southern Bright Ember Fire, perhaps enough to protect me. But retrieving it won't be easy."
Qin Sang looked in the direction Yun Youzi indicated.
Ahead in the secret tunnel were several stone chambers of varying sizes. All other chambers were empty, but the one at the very end housed the true form of the Southern Bright Ember Fire.
The flames manifested from the Demonic Fire’s power surged out of the chamber, filling the entire tunnel, leaving no gaps.
Beyond that, nothing could be seen, only a fiery red glow.
Under these circumstances, how could they pass through the Southern Bright Ember Fire to retrieve the cauldron fragment?
Qin Sang suspected that with his current cultivation, even a few stray flames would easily incinerate him.
