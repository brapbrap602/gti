<h1>**Chapter 320: Yinshan Pass**</h1><p>**Chapter 320: Yinshan Pass**</p><p>**Yinshan Pass**</p><p>Yinshan Pass, one of the Seven Valleys, is located between Chunyang City and Tianyou Pass.</p><p>This city offers a vastly different landscape compared to Xuanlan Pass.</p><p>The vast city is situated in the middle of a boundless swamp. Despite being located in the bitterly cold regions of the far north, the swamp isn’t frozen; instead, bubbling mud constantly releases warm air. When the mud bubbles burst, a surge of warmth rushes upward.</p><p>It felt like there was a hot spring at the bottom of the swamp.</p><p>The heat rose continuously and lingered in the air, enveloping the entire swamp in a thick fog and shrouding it in darkness.</p><p>Only by flying high up into the sky could one see sunlight.</p><p>Despite these harsh conditions, many types of vegetation grew in the swamp, but the majority of them had bizarre shapes. The ancient trees, in particular, looked like ferocious ghosts with their gnarled forms in the dense fog.</p><p>Yinshan Pass’s city walls were made up of rows of these strange ancient trees. These towering, ancient trees were a deep, bluish-green in color; even the smallest ones were thick enough to require dozens of people to wrap their arms around.</p><p>These ancient trees stood tightly packed together as if they were all dead, and their texture resembled iron ore.</p><p>The guards at Yinshan Pass were not especially strict. After Qin Sang climbed up to the city head, he handed over a spirit stone to the guards. He then received a waist token that allowed him to enter and exit at will until the rune on the token expired.</p><p>Looking down on the entire view of Yinshan Pass, Qin Sang was somewhat astonished.</p><p>This was a city built on the branches of trees.</p><p>It was said that many cultivators in Yinshan Pass dug out their immortal’s caves in tree hollows. This was proven true.</p><p>At the time, there was a constant flow of people in Yinshan Pass, and the place was bustling with activity. What was truly rare was that the people coming and going were all cultivators. They were likely all attracted by the auction.</p><p>These cultivators wore all sorts of different clothes, creating a chaotic scene.</p><p>Under the control of the Nascent Soul Stage城主 in Yinshan Pass, neither righteous nor evil cultivators dared to cause trouble. Even if there were conflicts, they could only be resolved in battle outside the city. Therefore, the city was still relatively peaceful, which looked rather strange.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered himself onto the net-like surface made up of countless thin branches. Looking down from above, he could clearly see the churning black mud in the swamp. It was nauseating to look at, but there was no foul odor.</p><p>The heat from the ground also couldn’t penetrate Yinshan Pass. It was daytime now, and the sun was high in the sky, illuminating the city.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped on the tree net with force, and it gave off a faint glow of禁制, proving it to be very sturdy.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and then squeezed into the crowd. After turning down several streets, he stopped in front of a three-story wooden building.</p><p>The wooden building was built on the fork of a large tree branch. It was supported by only two relatively thin tree branches. However, Qin Sang could tell that the branches did not bear the weight of the wooden building. Instead, there was a floating禁制 on the wooden building.</p><p>As if to complement the shape of the tree, the wooden building looked somewhat crooked. However, it seamlessly clung to the main trunk of the tree, creating a strange and harmonious beauty.</p><p>This type of wooden building was quite common in Yinshan Pass; however, this building only had three stories. It looked quite unremarkable compared to the others.</p><p>Lingdan Pavilion.</p><p>Its name was also quite modest.</p><p>In fact, this Lingdan Pavilion was a branch of Taiyi Pill Pavilion.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain also had assets in Yinshan Pass, but had not expanded as much as Taiyi Pill Pavilion. To inquire about the auction, one needed to enlist the help of Taiyi Pill Pavilion. Therefore, Qin Sang took Liu Guanshi’s token directly to their door.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin, please come in.”</p><p>After Qin Sang showed his token and proven his identity, he was enthusiastically led into a meditation room by the deacon of Lingdan Pavilion.</p><p>“My apologies for this humble abode, Fellow Daoist Qin.” Pu Guanshi of Lingdan Pavilion had a cultivation roughly on par with Liu Guanshi; however, he hadn’t come to Yinshan Pass because his age had reached a limit, but instead had come here to voluntarily manage the assets.</p><p>After listening to Pu Guanshi’s introduction, Qin Sang learned that the majority of the businesses in Yinshan Pass were controlled by the城主.</p><p>The城主 of Yinshan Pass had many cultivators under his command, and they were in good order. It was like an independent faction, but it simply hadn’t established a sect overtly.</p><p>Taiyi Pill Pavilion did not dare to compete with the城主 in Yinshan Pass, so it only maintained a storefront for the business it did with Foundation Establishment Stage cultivators and above. After all, the reputation of Taiyi Pill Pavilion was great enough that it did not need to use its storefronts as a way to show off its power.</p><p>Due to its unique business model, Taiyi Pill Pavilion had frequent contact with the upper echelons of Yinshan Pass. It was through the use of this meager relationship that it was able to investigate any information it needed.</p><p>Unfortunately, there had only been limited news about the auction. After nearly a year, there was still no new information.</p><p>“The auction will start in ten days. I will have someone arrange a meditation room for Fellow Daoist Qin right away. No one will disturb you while you cultivate,” said Pu Guanshi, showing his good intentions.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and declined. He only had ten days left, and it wasn’t urgent to begin cultivating. “I won’t hide it from Fellow Daoist Pu, I only learned about the Yinshan Pass auction from Elder Liu. I don’t know much about it. Would you be willing to give me a detailed introduction about the auction rules and precautions?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Manager Pu had someone serve fragrant Pu’erh tea. As they savored the spirit tea, he began introducing the auction to Qin Sang.</p><p>“The Yinshan Pass auction isn’t held in the city, instead, it’s held a hundred li to the north of the city on a stone island. There’s a large array outside the stone island, but it’s just to deal with the spirit beasts. It’s not dangerous for cultivators. As long as your cultivation is at the tenth layer of the Qi Refining stage, you should be able to get onto the stone island.</p><p>Fighting is forbidden on the stone island or within the array’s range, and any transaction must be made willingly by both parties.</p><p>It’s said that there was a great cultivator at the Jindan stage who relied on their strength to oppress others and seize their goods, but by the next day their body was hung on a stone pillar at the center of the stone island. That great cultivator’s sect didn’t even dare to say a harsh word.</p><p>Not only is the auction held here, the stone island is also a place for cultivators to do business. You could call it a small market. It’s only open for a month at a time.</p><p>This trading meet isn’t simple. There are often people who are wanted by important clans. But whether they are righteous or evil, they will always give the Yinshan Pass City Lord some face, and at the very least they won’t interfere with the trading meet openly.</p><p>Adding in the appeal of the auction, there will always be a lot of cultivators gathered on the stone island.</p><p>If Fellow Daoist Qin is interested, you might want to go to the island and take a look around. There might be some rare treasures that catch your eye.”</p><p>Manager Pu said this in a deep and meaningful way.</p><p>When Qin Sang heard this, he was lost in thought for a moment. The trading meet was held outside the city and not inside. Clearly, this was the result of some sort of bargaining between the City Lord and the other clans.</p><p>Listening to Manager Pu’s tone, there would probably be a lot of unseen treasures at the trading meet. These things wouldn’t appear at the auction, instead they could only be traded privately.</p><p>It was definitely worth a look.</p><p>When Qin Sang killed Yu Daiyue and the others, he had obtained a lot of spoils of war. Adding on what he got from Ge Que Lao Ren, he now had more than ten thousand low-grade spirit stones. Among Foundation Establishment stage cultivators, this could definitely be considered wealthy.</p><p>An excellent exceptional-grade Dharma weapon normally costs around three thousand spirit stones.</p><p>As long as it wasn’t a priceless treasure like a talisman treasure, a millennium spirit medicine, or soul-attracting grass, he should be able to afford it.</p>
