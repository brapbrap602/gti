<h1>Chapter 2237: A Different Kind of Dual Cultivation</h1><p>“This grand formation wasn't necessarily built by his sect. There's likely a hidden reason they're unwilling to reveal.  Oh well, we’ve gained a huge advantage. Qingfeng, when you see that junior cultivator, give him something suitable,” Tongshen said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked, “Senior Brother can cultivate this technique?”</p><p>“It perfectly suits your senior brother. But the best part is this Fire and Thunder Abyss.  With the aid of these thunder and fire energies, your senior brother will make rapid progress!”</p><p>Tongshen looked around, calculating how to modify the area.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>Qin Sang looked hesitant.</p><p>Tongshen’s face darkened. “What is this hesitation in front of your Master?”</p><p>“Master, please calm down! I was thinking, since Senior Brother will cultivate in the Fire and Thunder Abyss, we’ll be separated.  If that's the case, why don't we move our sect here and rebuild Yuanjing Mountain?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, continuing, “In Yongtu City, we only have a small hillside. With our small numbers now, it's enough. But if Master and Senior Brother take on more disciples later, it will become increasingly crowded.  Why not leave Yongtu City and be more independent outside?”</p><p>This was Qin Sang’s honest thought. While Yongtu City was safer, it came with many restrictions.  He foresaw he might have to do things that couldn’t be seen in the city, and it would be more convenient outside.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qing Yan and the others were quite moved and looked at their Master.</p><p>Tongshen pondered for a moment and asked, “Do you know of any nearby sects and factions?”</p><p>“I haven’t investigated thoroughly, but I know there’s a human sect nearby called Qingjiang Sect. They only have some local reputation, so their strength shouldn’t be too great,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“This Fire and Thunder Abyss hides a spiritual vein, perfectly suited as a foundation for our sect. However, rebuilding the sect outside the city is a huge undertaking.  Master needs to consider this carefully…”</p><p>Tongshen mused, “After a while, I'll find an excuse to visit Qingjiang Sect!”</p><p>…</p><p>Although Tongshen didn’t make an immediate decision, his disciples could see he was leaning towards it.</p><p>During the subsequent arrangements, they all put in a lot of effort, treating the place as their future sect.</p><p>The Fire and Thunder Abyss would be Senior Brother Qingyan’s secluded cultivation site. Since Qin Sang and the others wouldn’t cultivate this technique, they chose a nearby mountain, carefully planned, and personally built pavilions and towers.</p><p>Months later, Tongshen took Qingyan to visit Qingjiang Sect.  It is said that he sparred a few moves with Qingjiang’s sect leader and completely dominated.  Afterward, Qingjiang Sect tacitly allowed Yuanjing Mountain's presence.</p><p>With the protective formation completed, encompassing the Fire and Thunder Abyss and surrounding peaks, a brand new sect emerged before them. This place wasn’t as scenic as the original Yuanjing Mountain, but being able to rebuild their sect after displacement, they were satisfied.</p><p>“A message from the city. Master has to go out to welcome more of our kin.  Stay in the mountain. Our Yuanjing Mountain lineage isn’t yet firmly established here, remember not to open the sect gates easily!”</p><p>Tongshen gave careful instructions before hurrying back to Yongtu City.</p><p>Even though they’d left the city, their status as city guards couldn't be abandoned. If powerful enemies attacked, they would still have to seek refuge and protection within the city.</p><p>After Tongshen left, Qingyan eagerly entered the Fire and Thunder Abyss to cultivate.</p><p>In the quiet room,</p><p>Qin Sang and Shuangluo sat opposite each other.</p><p>Shuangluo, in plain clothes, lowered her head, her cheeks slightly flushed.</p><p>“Sister Shuangluo,” Qin Sang called out.</p><p>“Mm…”</p><p>Shuangluo’s voice was barely audible.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “Master told me to use the Stone-Born Fire to help you and Sister Qinghong cultivate the Water-Fire Harmony chapter. If you don’t have any objections, let’s begin now?”</p><p>In fact, Tongshen’s words were more blunt. He instructed Qin Sang to practice 'dual cultivation' with them, causing Shuangluo to be so shy that she didn’t dare to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>“This dual cultivation isn't that kind of dual cultivation.  Sister, concentrate on your cultivation technique. Don’t overthink it.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s words only made Shuangluo lower her head even further.</p><p>After a while, Shuangluo, suppressing her shyness, started to cultivate, placing her hands flat on her knees.</p><p>Qin Sang sat opposite her, both clearly sensing each other’s breaths.</p><p>A faint orchid fragrance filled the air. Qin Sang, unperturbed, saw that Shuangluo had finally put aside her worries, so he concentrated and gently placed his hands on hers, palm to palm.</p><p>With Shuangluo's permission, Qin Sang slowly transmitted a wisp of Stone-Born Fire into her body, guiding it through her meridians.  This was to guide Shuangluo's cultivation.</p><p>Shi Tai Fire, under Qin Sang's control, wouldn't harm Shuang Luo's meridians.  Following Qin Sang's guidance and harmonizing water and fire would deepen her understanding of the Water-Fire Harmony technique, achieving much with little effort.</p><p>This unique form of "dual cultivation" benefits both parties. Qin Sang also gains advantages, as the pairing of a man and woman represents Yin and Yang, aligning with the principles of Yin and Yang.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang can analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different cultivation methods. If cultivating two techniques simultaneously, like Qing Hong and Shuang Luo, proves superior to directly absorbing spirit fire, Qin Sang will cultivate another fire-type technique.</p><p>Everything is geared towards rapid cultivation advancement.  Currently, the "Celestial Demon Transformation" technique has hidden dangers, so Qin Sang must focus on this for now.</p><p>The quiet room was silent.</p><p>Their palms touched; a flame-like energy seemed to flow between them.</p><p>Soon, sweat beaded on Shuang Luo's forehead.</p><p>"Plop!"</p><p>A drop of sweat fell onto the meditation cushion.</p><p>Neither was disturbed, both engrossed in cultivation.</p><p>Gradually, Shuang Luo sweated profusely, her clothes drenched.</p><p>"Sigh…"</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang exhaled, withdrew his hands, and opened his eyes.  Shuang Luo awoke, feeling utterly exhausted; she had exerted herself to keep up with Qin Sang's guidance.</p><p>Suddenly, Shuang Luo felt sticky and, noticing Qin Sang's gaze, looked down, and froze. Her clothes clung to her body, revealing her figure.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Shuang Luo cried out, her face flushing crimson. She covered herself and rushed out of the room.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>The magically sealed door nearly flew off its hinges.</p><p>Qin Sang watched her go, smiling slightly. Then, he noticed a shadow at the door—Senior Sister Qing Hong, arms crossed, scrutinizing him.  "What did you do to Junior Sister Shuang?"</p><p>"With Senior Sister Shuang as a precedent, if you don't want your junior brother to feast his eyes, you might want to wear more clothes," Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>"You little rascal!"</p><p>Qing Hong glared fiercely. "You spend so much time showering your junior sisters with attention; why resort to this?"</p><p>"Senior Sister, what do you take me for?"</p><p>Qin Sang shrugged, feigning innocence. "Junior Sister Shuang's profuse sweating is due to the Shi Tai Fire entering her body, causing a surge of internal heat, difficult even for cultivators to endure."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's feigned ignorance, Qing Hong wanted to kick him.  She snorted, grabbed a thick robe, draped it over herself, and sat before Qin Sang. "Begin."</p><p>After the "dual cultivation," Qing Hong was also drenched in sweat, though her robe concealed everything.</p><p>After Qing Hong left, Qin Sang reflected on the process, falling into deep thought.</p><p>Since subduing the Shi Tai Fire, Qin Sang had been trying to understand its properties.</p><p>Each spirit fire has unique characteristics. For example, the Nine Nether Demon Fire can assault the soul, and the Tian Feng True Fire's feathers can shatter void.</p><p>What are the characteristics of the Shi Tai Fire?</p><p>After much contemplation, Qin Sang surprisingly found it lacked exceptional qualities, possessing only a gentle and weighty aura.</p><p>The earth is receptive and nurturing; the gentleman carries himself with integrity and profound virtue.</p><p>Was its nature shaped by its incubation within the stone egg?</p><p>Perhaps this very nature allowed Qin Sang to smoothly cultivate the Water-Fire Harmony technique, and even guide his senior sisters without incident.</p><p>However, this property wouldn't be helpful in combat.</p><p>"No wonder that senior cultivator valued the Shi Tai Fire so highly. This spirit fire might be one of the most suitable for cultivating the Water-Fire Harmony technique…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Recalling the spirit fires he had previously subdued, none would have been as smooth a process.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang needn't consider alternative paths and could continue cultivating with the Shi Tai Fire.  However, its longevity was unknown, and future refinement of other spirit fires might cause complications.</p><p>For now, there was no need to worry.  After recovering his breath, Qin Sang entered the fire chamber, retrieved the Golden Eagle's corpse, separated some essence, and prepared to refine Demonic Spirit Pills.</p><p>Qin Sang spent his time refining pills, periodically practicing "dual cultivation" with his senior sisters, and diligently cultivating his own abilities, enjoying himself immensely. His cultivation progressed rapidly.</p><p>One day, a talismanic light flew into the protective mountain array. Qin Sang and his two senior sisters were discussing Daoist principles.</p><p>Qin Sang caught a message talisman.  After reading it, he rose and said, "Senior Brother Deng sent a message. It's our turn for patrol duty. I'll discuss the next article with you two senior sisters when I return."</p><p>"Be careful on patrol, demonic creatures are dangerous. Maybe you should resign from this post," Qing Hong said with concern.</p><p>"Senior Sister, have you forgotten why I begged Master to get me this position?"</p><p>Qin Sang started to leave, but Qing Hong stopped him.</p><p>"Wait, take this amulet, my dear junior brother. This treasure can automatically protect its owner. Consider it a token of my affection," Qing Hong took out a jade amulet, smooth and warm, like sculpted mutton-fat jade.</p><p>Pressing the amulet into Qin Sang's hand, Qing Hong turned to Shuang Luo, "Didn't you refine a suit of armor for our junior brother?  Hurry up and give it to him."</p><p>Shuang Luo softly hummed, taking out a piece of inner armor.  The material was unknown, woven from countless golden threads, yet as soft as silk.</p><p>She offered the armor to Qin Sang, her gaze flickering as she met his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang accepted it with a smile, "Thank you for your care, senior sisters."</p><p>Qing Hong grumbled, "Since when have you become so formal? You're our junior brother. You help us cultivate, and we've never said such things. However, mine was purchased, but my junior sister's is hand-crafted and took a lot of effort."</p><p>"Sister Shuang is proficient in crafting artifacts?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, "Master knows everything, but not crafting. I wonder what materials this inner armor requires? I'll buy some on this trip. Sister Shuang, can you craft one for each of the senior sisters and senior brothers as well?"</p><p>Shuang Luo's eyes darkened slightly, and she nodded silently.</p><p>"You silly goose! Junior sister already bought enough materials.  Mind your own business!"</p><p>Qing Hong poked Qin Sang hard, "Now go!"</p><p>Qin Sang leaped out of the mountain and sped towards the agreed-upon location. Examining the inner armor, he smelled a faint, sweet fragrance. Looking back at the mountain gate, a certain image filled his mind.</p><p>He'd been in this illusory realm for a long time. Since arriving in Yongtu Immortal City, Qin Sang had tried various methods to find Liuli, but to no avail.  He still hadn't found her.</p><p>Those powerful individuals from the other races hadn't appeared either. Qin Sang was clueless. Besides constantly improving his strength, he didn't know where to begin.</p><p>...</p><p>"Senior Brother Qingfeng has arrived."</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the rendezvous point; others had mostly gathered.</p><p>"This time, we'll patrol Huin Valley. Everyone, stay alert and don't slack off," Deng Kui gave the order, and they set off.</p><p>He flew ahead for a while, then deliberately fell behind to Qin Sang's side.</p><p>"Daoist Qin, about what you mentioned last time, I've had someone inquire."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up, "What's the result?"</p><p>"I hear the east is currently a den of vipers. Are you sure you want to go?" Deng Kui asked.</p><p>Qin Sang decisively replied, "Absolutely."</p><p>"Your master is a Celestial Guard, responsible for guiding members of our race to the Immortal City. Why not go with your master instead of going through all this trouble?" Deng Kui was puzzled.</p><p>"Master won't agree," Qin Sang said, "I'm tired of this peaceful life. I heard that going out allows me to fight with other races, a chance to apply my lifelong learning and make contributions!"</p><p>Deng Kui looked at him like he was crazy, "It's said those other races are restless.  Only experts like your master have the ability to guide our people. But there are exceptions.  Some seniors will bring a few juniors as assistants, and some nearby missions with low danger also recruit cultivators of our cultivation level. I'll send you a message if there's an opportunity."</p><p>"Thank you for your trouble, Senior Brother Deng!"</p><p>Qin Sang calculated in his heart, a golden eagle's corpse wouldn't last long. For the Demonic Beast Pill, he had to kill more demonic beasts.</p><p>"Also, about the cultivation methods of the other races you requested, you're in luck. There's a lineage originating from the Phoenix race. But no matter the race, they're all quite similar," Deng Kui handed Qin Sang several jade slips.</p><p>He didn't doubt Qin Sang's intentions, assuming he wanted to learn more about the demonic races to prepare himself.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him again, accepting the jade slips and handing him a pouch in return, "Consider this my payment."</p><p>Deng Kui opened the pouch and smiled broadly.</p><p>The reason he was so attentive and accommodating to Qin Sang was that Qin Sang was incredibly generous.</p><p>"Rest assured, Daoist friend.  Your concerns are my concerns. If you need anything else, just say the word!" Deng Kui thumped his chest.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the cultivation methods in the jade slips. As Deng Kui said, whether Phoenix race or other races, they all followed the path of attracting starlight to refine the body.</p><p>These cultivation methods weren't very valuable to humans, as people had already tried them. Forcibly cultivating them would only lead to hidden dangers.</p><p>So, what's the difference between them and the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique?</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Only two chapters were written this week, but the outline is mostly complete. I finally figured out the biggest plot roadblock.</p><p>Only this last issue remains. I'll try to solve it tomorrow, and then I can resume normal updates.</p>
