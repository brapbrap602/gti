Chapter 223: Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark

Approaching each other with the intention of convergence, the duo soon make their reconciliation.
'BAM!'
Yun Youzi pedals on a Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark, bombing the besieging cloud beasts and scattering their ranks with full force. The Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark beams for a moment, throwing the beasts off, and it shoots over to Qin Sang in the blink of an eye.
Yun Youzi doesn't seem to be in a bad shape, all things considered. After all, the most formidable cloud beast is still slightly ahead, making these beasts merely quantity-formidable.
Yun Youzi examines Qin Sang's Ebony Sword and dictates with a deep voice, "Young brother Qin, come up quickly! My flying ark has an astonishing speed. Evading the cloud beasts’ pursuit will be effortless, but I'll require my complete attention to steer it. With that, I won't be able to fend off the beasts' attacks and will need Young Brother Qin to pave the way with your sword.”
Qin Sang flashes up the Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark's edge, appraising it. The flying ark, he finds, is composed of four stalks of white bamboo, each as crystalline and clear as nephrite. It's as if someone forcefully bent and kneaded these stalks together to mold them into this ark.
This Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark has an extraordinarily simple appearance. Aside from the bamboo, there are no other spiritual materials. Its aura, however, surpasses every ultimate-grade magic weapon Qin Sang has ever seen. He can't help but wonder what type of treasure it is.
Qin Sang speculates that this aura is emitted by the bamboo itself, hinting that these bamboo stalks are truly rare and exceptional. If his Ebony Sword could absorb them, its power would inevitably be amplified by a level.
Unfortunately, these bamboos have already been refined into a magic weapon; even if Yun Youzi were to be so generous as to hand the Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark to him, the Ebony Sword wouldn't be able to absorb it.
"Rest assured, Senior; I'll refrain from letting the cloud beasts disturb you."
Upon agreeing, Qin Sang moves his mind, causing the Ebony Sword to instantly fly up and hover over the Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark. His sword net deploys in that moment, effortlessly butchering the cloud beasts that are hot on their tail.
"Splendid swordsmanship!"
Yun Youzi's eyes light up with praise, setting his mind at ease. He entrusts Qin Sang with the beasts, sitting cross-legged in the ark and submerging his soul into it.
'Whir!'
The flying ark faintly trembles, changing its course to face the exterior of the cloud beast sea.
The bamboo emits a pearly white light, spreading and enveloping the pair in a thin protective membrane.
"Be cautious, Junior Brother Qin!"
Yun Youzi's voice alerts him in a rush. Qin Sang immediately retracts the range of his sword net, only to find his vision blurring in the next moment. He flies backward at frightening speeds.
Sensing the Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark's speed, Qin Sang is astonished. Compared to it, his Sky Shuttle is as slow as a snail. Even when he flies on his sword, it's no match for the ark.
Perhaps once he breaks through the fourth level of the Primordial Spirit Sword Nourishment Chapter, mastering his second divine ability—Sword Qi Thunderclap—he'll be able to touch the ark's level.
That said, Yun Youzi's cultivation is only at the early Foundation Establishment stage. What he’s experiencing now might not even be the Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark’s full force; that makes Qin Sang curious about how Yun Youzi acquired this treasure. With the ark, he could navigate many dangerous places with ease.
Qin Sang paves the way with his sword net while the Bamboo Spirit Flying Ark charges forward at an astonishing velocity. Their momentum naturally draws attention, and the number of cloud beasts drawn to them only increases, the majority falling far behind the ark.
Yet as the ark closes in on the edge of the cloud beast sea, the strength of their besiegers grows. Several auras that frighten even Qin Sang appear overhead. 
Qin Sang stands straight at the head of the flying ark, looking up with an earnest expression.
"Caw, caw..."
A few cloud beasts resembling crows swoop down to block their path, each as strong as a Foundation Establishment cultivator.
The cloud beasts scream out loud, their grotesque wings that span dozens of feet wide flapping and causing the spiritual qi to ripple. Every flap whips up a hurricane. Their power is on par with the strikes of Foundation Establishment cultivators.
Qin Sang scoffs at the sight. Raising his hand, he points a finger at the Ebony Sword. It responds with a lingering wail, unleashing sword qi that soars to an immediate hundred-foot length like a colossal sword cutting across the sky.
'BOOM!'
The sword qi crushes into the wind, causing it to burst apart with a roar. The cloud beasts behind the wind, too, sense the frightening killing intent carried on the sword qi and instinctively shriek in horror, fleeing in different directions.

In fact, Qin Sang's strength was far from enough to kill these cloud beasts. The wumu sword gravely injured a cloud beast and neared exhaustion, but those cloud beasts were frightened away by the killing intent in the sword energy. It happened to leave a channel for the Lingzhu flying boat to break through the blockade.
The Lingzhu flying boat flexibly passed through several cloud beasts, leaving them far behind. Success was in sight, but before Qin Sang could relax, he suddenly felt a terrifying pressure from above his head.
Qin Sang fearfully looked up and saw a mass of gray mist appear in the sky at some point. There were heart-stopping fluctuations coming from the mist, which quickly enveloped them.
His greatest fear had come true. A powerful cloud beast had been alerted and was attacking.
When he saw this, Qin Sang's expression changed. He silently calculated the speed of the flying boat and found that it shouldn't get covered by the mist. However, resisting a strong impact was inevitable.
Qin Sang's mind raced. He suddenly took out a black shield from his mustard-seed pouch and chanted. The black shield quickly enlarged in his hands, reaching the size to shelter the entire flying boat.
Qin Sang then threw the black shield with force. The shield flew into the sky and met the rapidly falling mist. They collided within an instant.
Crack!
The moment the collision happened, thick cracks like a spider's web appeared on the black shield. Then it shattered, lasting less than a breath.
Qin Sang's complexion changed. He was going to continue taking out other magic weapons to stall for time when he heard Yunyouzi's exhausted voice. "Don't bother, little brother Qin. Sit tight."
Before the words were finished, a hint of paleness appeared on Yunyouzi's face. The Lingzhu flying boat immediately burst into dazzling light. Like a comet, it dashed forward hundreds of feet in an instant, leaving the mist far behind. After several blinks, it flew out of the sea of cloud beasts.
The cloud beasts chased for a while, but they couldn't even see a shadow of the Lingzhu flying boat. They could only release some unwilling screams and disperse.
The Lingzhu flying boat sped at a low altitude. Qin Sang both drove away the cloud beasts and distinguished the direction, guiding the way for Yunyouzi. A quarter of an hour later, the flying boat landed beside a lake in the center of the wasteland.
The lake was like a sapphire embedded in the desolate wasteland, seeming very peculiar.
The refuge was deep beneath the lake. The gale from the apocalypse swept across the land, but the lake was calm with no waves thanks to the restriction spell from the refuge.
The apocalypse was becoming stronger. Qin Sang and Yunyouzi were both exhausted. They kept their magic weapons and entered the refuge. They found no one inside and couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.
Each of them found a corner to rest and recover their spiritual power.
After catching their breaths, Yunyouzi cupped his hands and bowed to Qin Sang. He said with emotion, "Thankfully I met little brother Qin. I almost left my old bones there."
