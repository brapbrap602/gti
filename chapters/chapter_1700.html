<h1>Chapter 1691: A Path Through</h1><p>Having previously taken refuge in the underground palace, Qin Sang had gained some respite.  However, this respite was short-lived. Soon, he was forced to relocate again, changing locations countless times.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had noticed a change in the demons’ tactics.  He had been using the Xuanji Sword Formation—a rare and superior illusory sword formation from the Jinxiang Hall—to evade them.  With a more conventional, forceful sword formation, he couldn't have hidden for so long.</p><p>The Jinxiang Hall’s defenses relied on a powerful earth-elemental formation as its foundation, incorporating numerous superior sword formations, including the Xuanji, to create a formidable array around the sword peaks.  Despite the seamless integration, subtle differences in energy and phenomena could still be detected at the junctions between the formations.</p><p>The demon kings had clearly noticed these weaknesses. They established a demonic formation in the air, guarding crucial points, encircling the Xuanji Sword Formation to trap Qin Sang, and methodically searching for him.</p><p>The demons’ attacks were relentless, leaving fewer and fewer places to hide.  Qin Sang, fully aware of the imminent danger, prioritized healing his main body, fighting against the clock.</p><p>The situation had reached a critical point.  Qin Sang was prepared to make sacrifices.  Escape would come at a cost. He had delayed sending away his avatar, clinging to hope of saving his main body.</p><p>Then, a familiar energy signature, transmitted subtly, reached the protective barrier around his hiding place.  Qin Sang’s joy was immeasurable.</p><p>The Glacial Soul Light!</p><p>Liuli was here!</p><p>This was entirely unexpected.</p><p>Since their parting in the Western Desert, there had been no news of Liuli for years.  He’d assumed she had withdrawn from the world, perhaps joining a Buddhist temple in the West to pursue enlightenment.</p><p>Yet, she was in the South, drawn here by the Unseen Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang then realized that Liuli had always been committed to saving her master.  Upon learning about the relationship between the Unseen Immortal Sect and the Immortal Palace, she would undoubtedly have come immediately.  Their long separation had simply prevented him from considering this possibility.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't sense Liuli directly, and he didn't know her current cultivation level.  Clearly, a distance separated them; she was using the concealment properties of the Glacial Soul Light to transmit a message.</p><p>The joy of reunion didn't cloud Qin Sang's judgment.  While Liuli's assistance was welcome, the enemy's forces were too strong. Reckless action could endanger her, something he desperately wanted to avoid.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang acted swiftly, opening the secret chamber's barrier without hesitation. A beam of light entered.</p><p>Instantly, the light materialized a map before him.  At a glance, Qin Sang recognized a portion of the Unseen Immortal Sect's hidden estate—a region extending northeast from the Jinxiang Hall.  It was a simplified map, lacking detailed architectural and geographical markers.</p><p>A white line connected the Jinxiang Hall to another location. At the line's end, the light formed a phantom image of a secluded temple in the mountains, concealing a hidden transmission array!</p><p>It was a clear escape route, meticulously planned, bypassing all dangers; all he needed to do was follow the path.</p><p>To Qin Sang's immense relief, the distance from the Jinxiang Hall to the transmission array was far shorter than escaping through the main gate—his biggest challenge.  He could momentarily repel the demon kings and use his exceptional escape techniques to gain distance, but completely shaking off his pursuers was highly unlikely. His original plan had relied on the Unseen Immortal Sect's ubiquitous ancient restrictions, using his avatar as bait to create an escape opportunity for his main body.</p><p>With Liuli's guidance, reaching the temple meant his escape would be secured!</p><p>"The Unseen Immortal Sect does have other passages," Qin Sang muttered. He'd considered this possibility, but his limited knowledge of the sect had hindered his efforts.  Liuli had provided invaluable assistance.  Truly, there was always a way.</p><p>"Do you still have the strength?"</p><p>The phantom image dissipated, leaving this question behind.</p><p>Liuli had cleverly sent the Glacial Soul Light past the demons’ surveillance, a feat of immense difficulty.  The energy supporting the light had reached its limit. Their communication was brief, then the connection was severed.</p><p>With the Glacial Soul Light gone, Qin Sang’s tense nerves relaxed.  Liuli had acted cautiously, avoiding his biggest fear.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang understood.  Liuli's ability to recognize him at the Wanmo Assembly was certainly not due to his sword intent alone, but connected to that heretical cultivation technique.</p><p>Internal and external communication established the plan, giving the subsequent actions a clear framework.  Qin Sang abandoned attempts at healing, instead focusing all her efforts on forcibly stabilizing her injuries, striving to regain control of her spiritual energy and use her magic artifacts.  Even if this worsened her condition and complicated her recovery later.</p><p>Outside the Xuanji Sword Formation.</p><p>Liuli finished her cultivation and, sensing the nun's gaze, said, "Let's go to Yu Yang Peak first. My junior sisters have already entered the secret passage in that mountain; the Abbess can wait for us at the entrance."</p><p>The nun remained motionless, silently observing Liuli. Seeing Liuli's determination to save Qin Sang, she couldn't help but warn,  "That spirit fire, capable of annihilating a Nascent Soul, must have consumed immense energy. How much spiritual energy does he have left? If he's captured, the demon king will undoubtedly target you. I fear you won't have time to retreat, and you'll both be lost."</p><p>Liuli calmly replied, "Abbess, don't worry, his escape techniques are excellent."</p><p>The nun hesitated upon hearing this.</p><p>She chose to stay, partly out of loyalty to her fellow disciples, and partly due to the deep impression Qin Sang's annihilation of the three illusory Nascent Souls had left on her. If this person survived, his future would be limitless.</p><p>Forging a connection with such an individual would be advantageous.</p><p>But this was a confrontation with a demon king, and the nun was understandably apprehensive, her options limited.</p><p>Since their acquaintance, Liuli had never spoken falsely. In such a life-or-death situation, she wouldn't be making idle boasts. They had witnessed firsthand the demons transforming into their true forms and charging at them at breakneck speed.</p><p>Liuli's confidence suggested that the person's escape abilities surpassed those of the demon kings.</p><p>This offered a glimmer of hope!</p><p>Liuli circled to a section of the Xuanji Sword Formation closer to the Jinxiang Palace's core, selecting a sword peak at the formation's edge, concealing herself, and silently entering the mountain.</p><p>On the sword peak, ripples lapped gently, as a fish demon in its true form hovered in midair, monitoring the surrounding peaks.</p><p>Liuli dared not enter the Xuanji Sword Formation; its energy had been sealed by the demon formation and eyes; entering would inevitably expose her. She stopped at the formation's edge and infiltrated a rather elegant courtyard.</p><p>Because this peak had been previously visited by the nuns of the Yan Yue Monastery, Liuli had chosen it in advance.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon passing Yu Yang Peak, the nun didn't stop and accompanied Liuli to this location.</p><p>She surveyed the peak; the original owner had connected several courtyards in the mountain, creating a formation. It wasn't particularly intricate, but simple and easily mastered, and its power was still considerable.</p><p>"I will control the formation from below, to prevent your sisters from being distracted," the nun surprisingly decided to remain.</p><p>Naturally, she would hide, avoiding direct confrontation.  If anything went wrong, the demons would target Liuli first. Even if Liuli couldn't be saved, she could escape in the ensuing chaos.</p><p>Liuli knew the nun was taking a significant risk, and expressed her gratitude.</p><p>The nun waved her whisk, leaving behind a single phrase: "Be careful."</p><p>After watching the nun depart.</p><p>Liuli paused briefly, then vanished.</p><p>...</p><p>The floating lake above.</p><p>The Jinxiang Palace below.</p><p>Two battlefields became the focal points.</p><p>The floating lake continued to churn violently, striking fear into the hearts of onlookers.</p><p>The numerous demon shadows above the Jinxiang Palace were also eye-catching, sparking curiosity about whether the extraordinary individual still had the strength to deliver more surprises.</p><p>That such a figure had appeared among the humans, only to be hunted by the demons on human territory, evoked pity and a sense of shared doom among some. Yet, with the Hui Guang Saint remaining silent, who dared to act?</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>…</p><p>The Xuanji Sword Formation erupted with intense green light, a hazy glow indicating that the formation's strength had significantly weakened.</p><p>The demon eyes in the sky constantly rotated.</p><p>Within the formation, Qin Sang's room to maneuver was rapidly shrinking.</p><p>All the sword peaks covered by the Xuanji Sword Formation shook violently, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Just as the formation grew increasingly chaotic, an abnormal fluctuation appeared on a sword peak at its edge, something seemingly impacting the demon formation, and not originating from the Xuanji Sword Formation itself.</p><p>Bai Xiao remained motionless.</p><p>The demon formation didn't react.</p><p>The four-winged blood serpent circling him suddenly glared in that direction, its crimson eyes flashing with an eerie light. Transforming into a bloody light, it lunged towards the sword peak.</p><p>Meanwhile, the fish demon guarding the peak lashed its tail downwards, the surrounding blue light instantly solidifying into a powerful waterfall that crashed down onto a courtyard within the mountain.</p><p>This attack wasn't just its own strength; it leveraged a demonic array, allowing other demon kings to contribute even without moving.</p><p>Countless pavilions and halls collapsed, stones flew everywhere, and a deep crater was instantly gouged out of the courtyard.</p><p>Then, the fish demon and the four-winged blood serpent swooped down from left and right.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a white mist erupted from the ruins, a chilling fog seemingly composed of countless tiny ice crystals, mirroring the previous attack by the avatar.</p><p>The attacker was Liuli, deliberately mimicking the avatar. While their cultivated abilities differed, these demons were unfamiliar with the "Ice Soul Radiance," making it difficult to discern the difference in the heat of the moment.</p><p>The ice mist surged outwards with astonishing speed.</p><p>Knowing they were fighting a desperate battle, the fish demon and four-winged blood serpent, already cautious, changed color upon sensing the icy aura, their escape light arcing to avoid the mist.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>White shadows flashed, swiftly shooting towards the peak.</p><p>As soon as the light appeared, Bai Xiao reacted!</p><p>However, the demonic array remained unchanged.</p><p>They knew both Qin Sang's main body and avatar were trapped.  Using the avatar as bait to draw them away was a predictable tactic.  Now, more than ever, they couldn't lose their composure and give their opponent an opening.</p><p>Of course, capturing the avatar and crippling Qin Sang was something Bai Xiao wouldn't mind at all.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A beam of light, like a sharp arrow, shot from a demonic eye in the sky.</p><p>The ice mist immediately churned from the impact.</p><p>Bai Xiao caught a glimpse of a shadowy figure within the mist, remaining vigilant while extending an arm; his long fingers' nails grew wildly, turning into five razor-sharp blades.</p><p>Suddenly, Bai Xiao felt an inexplicable premonition, followed by an icy chill, the surrounding void freezing at a visible rate.</p><p>This was the true Ice Soul Radiance!</p><p>In an instant, a terrifying shriek pierced the air.</p><p>Bai Xiao, being a powerful demon saint and somewhat prepared, counterattacked swiftly and fiercely, redirecting the light beam from the demonic eye onto himself. White smoke swirled around him, desperately hindering the spreading ice as he charged upwards.</p><p>Then, another unexpected event occurred.  The almost completely ruined courtyard was suddenly swept by a gale, activating a spirit array, forming a grey whirlwind. The spiraling wind created rings of immense suction, engulfing the surrounding space.</p><p>Even in this perilous situation, Bai Xiao didn't call for help.</p><p>Just as the demons were shaken, a figure suddenly appeared from the northeast, charging into the demonic array.</p><p>"Here...Caw!"</p><p>Gu Bird, who was stationed on this peak, let out a warning cry and swooped down. Two demon kings on either side immediately surrounded him, preparing to intercept, but then saw a familiar, crimson flame approaching.  Their cries morphed into sounds of terror.</p><p>The South Ming Blazing Fire reappeared!</p><p>However, this time only three birds attacked, and they were avatars.  But to Gu Bird, this was the terrifying flame that annihilated the Three Illusory Bodies of the Saint King, a flame capable of obliterating even the Five Elements Divine Ban. What chance did they have?</p><p>Gu Bird had no time to distinguish between strengths.  Besides, the power of the three divine birds was already terrifying.</p><p>"This guy still has energy left!"</p><p>This was Gu Bird's only thought, struck with terror. Like a drowning man, he frantically flapped his wings, scattering most of his remaining yellow feathers.</p><p>The other two demon kings didn't even bother with Gu Bird, fleeing without looking back.</p><p>The demonic array instantly fell into disarray. The power of the other demon kings formed a grey tide, converging before suddenly dispersing,  all drawn towards Gu Bird to defend against the South Ming Blazing Fire.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The crimson flame exploded again in the sky, once more shocking everyone.  Though smaller than the previous two bursts, it mixed with grey energy.</p><p>A lightning-fast escape light seized the opportunity to burst out of the Golden Aspect Hall, faster than thunder, shooting towards the northeast in the midst of stunned onlookers, disappearing into the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know if Gu Bird lived or died, nor did he care. His main body recklessly mobilized his true energy, using both thunder and sword escapes to leave the demon kings behind.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>Bai Xiao exploded in rage, breaking free from the Ice Soul Radiance and the wind rings, pursuing fiercely.</p><p>Only a few streaks of fleeting light could be seen on the horizon.</p><p>Puzzlingly, the person wasn't escaping outwards but flying deeper into the ancestral mansion.</p><p>With his extraordinary escape techniques, Qin Sang managed to outdistance his pursuers, but it wasn't enough to ensure his survival.</p><p>Before reaching the temple, Qin Sang's injuries flared again, beyond his control. The avatar took over, carrying the main body and continuing the flight.</p><p>The distance seemed endless to Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, the peak and the temple appeared.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The avatar descended with the main body, charging straight into the temple.</p><p>Bai Xiao followed closely, but as he was about to enter, a blinding white chill poured out.</p><p>After forcefully suppressing the Ice Soul Radiance and shattering the temple, he only found a damaged teleportation array on the opposite side – no one was there.</p>
