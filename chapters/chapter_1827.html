Chapter 1818: Recovery from Injury


The tremors from the protective formation around the estate persisted for a long time.
As the vibrations gradually subsided, Qin Sang's aura receded and finally stabilized.
He opened his eyes, a gleam of excitement difficult to conceal.  Before this, he never would have imagined breaking through to the mid-stage of the fifth level of the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula* in a mere thirty years.
Calming his emotions, Qin Sang examined his inner self. This breakthrough hadn't left any hidden dangers.  Clenching his fists, he felt inexhaustible power coursing through his body.
At this moment, Qin Sang remembered something and looked up at the Azure鸾 Phoenix manifestation above his head.
With the breakthrough, the changes in the Azure鸾 Phoenix manifestation were obvious. The illusory image was more solidified, slowly transforming into something real, although it was still far from comparable to the fleeting glimpse he'd had of the Demon King's manifestation.
What Qin Sang wanted to know was what benefits the Azure鸾 Phoenix manifestation brought him each time it transformed.
The cultivation technique didn't specify.
Perhaps the effects of different manifestations varied, or perhaps it was related to bloodline. Demon cultivators with bloodline inheritance might instinctively comprehend it, while he could only explore on his own.
Cultivating the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula* with a human body always presented various challenges, but Qin Sang had long since grown accustomed to this. He immediately gathered his thoughts and focused on sensing the manifestation.
……
One year later.
A faint golden light flickered within the cave dwelling, illuminating the outline of Qin Sang's figure.
His hands formed seals, performing the first posture of the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*, the Auspicious Seal.
As the saying goes, "Hands form the seal, mouth chants the mantra, heart visualizes the revered Buddha." Qin Sang's mastery had long since reached the level of heart seal, yet he still formed the seals with his hands.
However, although it was the same Auspicious Seal, it was worlds apart from before.
“Still not enough…”
A sigh echoed.
Qin Sang opened his eyes, looked at his hands, and fell into deep contemplation.
Clearly, he was comprehending and deducing the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*, striving to achieve the unification of all seven seals.
Five years remained until his agreed-upon meeting with Venerable Zhenru.
Initially, Qin Sang had believed the fifty-year agreement was more than enough time, confident he could grasp the unification of the seven seals. Unexpectedly, he obtained the *Poison God Codex*, and so Qin Sang dedicated himself to its cultivation, setting the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* aside.
He would first elevate his cultivation level, as comprehending the Buddha Seal would surely be easier after a breakthrough.
As expected, in the year following his breakthrough, Qin Sang made rapid progress, achieving the fusion of five seals. Only the last two remained: the Vajra Armor Seal and the Vajra Great Freedom Seal.
He was currently attempting to integrate the Vajra Armor Seal, but he had encountered a bottleneck at the final juncture.
The fusion of the Buddha Seals became increasingly difficult with each additional seal. Qin Sang was mentally prepared for this, murmuring to himself, “Knowledge gained from books is superficial after all.  I still need to combine it with actual combat experience…”
The best opponents for testing the Buddha Seals were ferocious beasts.  He could also comprehend the Dao of Slaughter and obtain valuable spiritual materials, killing multiple birds with one stone.
Qin Sang rose to his feet, and the Celestial Eye Butterfly immediately landed on his shoulder.
Exiting the estate, he gathered the mature flower nectar and arrived at the two patches of top-grade flower fields. Seeing the aperture, Qin Sang paused.
Gazing at it for a moment, Qin Sang's figure flickered. For the first time, he crossed the flower fields and approached the aperture.
Toxic mist swirled around the aperture, a dark and ominous presence hinting at terrible dangers lurking within. Although Qin Sang had the Poison Pearl for protection, and cultivated poison techniques himself, he still felt an inexplicable unease as he drew closer.
Finally, he stopped on a mountain peak several miles away, staring at the aperture.
According to the records in the *Poison God Codex* and his judgment based on the spirit formations, the aperture's location was deep beneath the mountain.
Activating his Celestial Eye divine ability, he could see a circular stone cave at the foot of the mountain.
Toxic mist billowed from the cave entrance, continuously pouring out in an impenetrable, dense cloud.
Logically, the aperture shouldn't be able to accumulate so much poison. It should be purged when it reached a certain level. These flower fields had existed for who knew how long.
Qin Sang had discreetly inquired with Ju Shanzhi.  Within Ju Shanzhi and the Daoist sects, some lineages passed down poison cultivation techniques, but few specialized in poison like Cricket Mountain, and none had any connection to the *Poison God Codex*.
Ju Shanzhi also had no legends concerning a 'Poison God'.
Standing there, Qin Sang hesitated, ultimately deciding not to approach the cave entrance.
“At least wait until after I break through to mid-stage Nascent Soul before investigating.”
Qin Sang pondered.
Firstly, he sensed extreme danger within the cave and felt his current strength was insufficient. Secondly, the power of the Poison Pearl wasn't strong enough.
The Fat Silkworm had only been a fourth-transformation spirit insect when it separated from the Poison Pearl.  The pearl had improved in his hands after devouring and refining the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit's poison, and even that had come from the dead insect's corpse.
During this period, Qin Sang had focused on his own cultivation. The Poison Pearl had primarily served as a supplementary cultivation tool, receiving only a small amount of flower poison, resulting in slow improvement.
As Qin Sang's cultivation increased, the speed at which he devoured poison also increased.  He would definitely need to enhance the Poison Pearl to suppress the residual poison.
However, this would make flower nectar even more scarce, and he would eventually have to explore the aperture.
Taking one last look at the stone cave, Qin Sang retreated and directly left the poison lake.
He habitually checked his secret marks and found them all intact.
Over forty years had passed unnoticed, and it seemed both the Ghost Fang Kingdom and the Dao Court had forgotten about the Ju Shanzhi altar.
The Ghost Fang Kingdom vigorously promoted its divine path, focusing on gathering believers.  Demon temples were everywhere.  The Dao Court, however, remained inactive.
Perhaps the two powers were engaged in a hidden struggle.
Qin Sang shook his head inwardly, left the altar, and flew towards the depths of the孽 Wasteland.
……
“This is the place.”
In the endless black mire, Qin Sang stood on a tree branch, gazing at the swamp ahead.
Focusing his senses, he confirmed the ferocious beast was still there.
Qin Sang had discovered this beast before, but there were two other ferocious beasts' nests nearby, so he hadn't dared to act rashly.
Having recently achieved a breakthrough, he was more confident.
After stealthily patrolling the mire, he discovered the other two beasts had left at some unknown time.  With no reason to hold back, he unleashed his aura without hesitation and headed straight for the swamp.
‘Splash!’
Muddy waves surged skyward as a beast with a serpent's head and turtle's body emerged, its fierce gaze fixed on Qin Sang.
……
Two months after leaving the altar, Qin Sang returned, his body radiating a bloody aura, two Nascent Soul stage ferocious beast demon cores added to his Qianjun Ring.
Although he hadn't encountered a beast requiring his full strength, these two battles were enough to verify his understanding of the Buddha Seals.
The bottleneck had loosened, and he would likely achieve the fusion of six seals soon.
Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to return to his cave dwelling.  Having been in seclusion for so long, it was time to return to Ju Shanzhi.
After speeding southeast for a while, Qin Sang concealed his presence.  The Ghost Fang Kingdom was becoming increasingly rampant.  Demon temples were expanding along the northern border of Ju Shanzhi within the孽 Wasteland, spreading to the north of Star Island Immortal Lake, blocking the path of Ju Shanzhi cultivators entering and exiting the wasteland.
It was said that the Dao Court army held the southern border, preventing them from crossing the line.  However, the sects in the north of Ju Shanzhi lacked the ability to contend with the Ghost Fang Kingdom, and could only endure, awaiting the Dao Court's actions.
Qin Sang expertly navigated through the territories of several demon gods, arriving at the Serpent Demon's temple.
The temple was constructed from rough-hewn stones, sturdy and exuding an ancient aura.
A lifelike statue of the Serpent Demon stood before the temple, possessing a majestic air of swallowing the sun and moon.
The Serpent Demon gathered followers within its territory, not only ghost people but also mountain魈 and wood sprites.
These spirits would gradually be corrupted by the Six Heavens Ancient Qi after their birth, transforming into ferocious beasts.
After becoming followers of the Serpent Demon, like the ghost people, they received the god's decrees, and not only did their intelligence gradually awaken, but their bloodlust also diminished.
To a certain extent, the existence of the demon gods had revitalized the孽 Wasteland.
As for the Serpent Demon itself, after becoming a demon god and gaining the worship and prostration of its followers, it had also benefited immensely.
Out of curiosity, Qin Sang had investigated and discovered that this was achieved through the statue before the temple.
When followers sincerely prostrated and prayed before the statue, a peculiar power would emanate from them, absorbed by the statue and transmitted to the Serpent Demon's body.
The Serpent Demon simply needed to recline within the temple, fulfilling some of its followers' wishes from time to time.
The temple and the statue were built by the Ghost Fang Kingdom, and the Serpent Demon simply reaped the benefits, knowing what happened but not why.
Qin Sang had tried to comprehend the statue but had failed to grasp its essence.
The Serpent Demon, initially somewhat resistant, now began to relish the feeling of being a deity.
Inside the temple.
The Serpent Demon feigned sleep on a soft couch, surrounded by silk quilts and curtains, a table laden with spiritual fruits, looking perfectly content.
"Too bad this isn't the Ghost Fang Kingdom," the Serpent Demon flicked its forked tongue, coiling around a spiritual fruit and chewing it with relish.
Personally proselytizing was still not as enjoyable as simply reaping the benefits. These ghost people and spirits had low intelligence and could only offer natural spiritual fruits as tributes.
Suddenly, a figure materialized before the couch.
The Serpent Demon froze, swallowing the fruit whole, rolling off the couch, and kneeling in worship.  "This humble god was unaware of the Immortal's arrival and failed to welcome you properly.  I beg the Immortal's forgiveness."
The Serpent Demon now fully embraced its self-proclaimed divinity, showing no trace of its former courageous and diligent self.
There was no one nearby to compete with it for followers.
Establishing itself as a god and building a temple, as long as it fulfilled the wishes of its believers, it could obtain a continuous stream of power.
With power so easily acquired, most would become complacent.
Qin Sang shook his head inwardly.  Mere words would hardly awaken the Serpent Demon. Only a major upheaval could rouse it.
As the saying goes, "Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it."
Qin Sang believed the divine path was definitely not so simple.
Once the Dao Court launched its counterattack, destroying temples and mountains, what would become of the gods who lost their followers?
“Any news lately?” Qin Sang asked indifferently.
The Serpent Demon replied respectfully, “This humble god has been gathering information on spiritual herbs and has some leads. Next time I return, I will contact them… Also, three months ago, that狈 Demon delivered a talisman message.”
As it spoke, the Serpent Demon retrieved a yellow talisman.
Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He immediately took the talisman and, with a sweep of his divine sense, confirmed it was a secret message from Mo Xingdao.
The message contained only one piece of information: Hong Yuzi, after decades of seclusion, had recovered from his injuries.  Shortly after emerging from seclusion, he had begun preparing various magical treasures and talismans. Mo Xingdao judged that within three years, Hong Yuzi would explore the Ju Shanzhi altar once more!
“Three years…”
Qin Sang's face was thoughtful.
It was said that Hong Yuzi’s injuries had been extremely severe. He was indeed a Dao Court Immortal Official, recovering in just forty years of seclusion.
If he hadn’t obtained the *Poison God Codex*, Qin Sang’s strength would be far less than it currently was, and he would have had to act cautiously. Now, he had many more options.
His and Mo Xingdao’s previous plan was for Mo Xingdao to find a way to delay Hong Yuzi, buying Qin Sang time to cooperate with him and gradually explore the path to ascension.
Qin Sang’s cultivation speed had far exceeded expectations, so naturally, the plan needed to be altered to strive for greater benefits.
He could even consider helping Mo Xingdao escape control, thus placing the initiative in their hands.
Qin Sang crushed the talisman, pacing back and forth, assessing his strength. Although Hong Yuzi was a prestigious Fourth Rank Immortal Official, if he planned ahead and utilized the altar's terrain to his advantage, it wasn’t impossible to succeed.
In three years, Qin Sang believed he should be able to fuse the seventh seal.  However, the timing was somewhat unfortunate, as he had originally intended to visit Mirror Terrace Temple after fusing all seven seals.
One attempt at the Pagoda of Suffering might not be successful, and even if he gained some fortuitous encounter, he wouldn't be able to digest it in a short time.
More importantly, he needed to explore the altar before Hong Yuzi acted, striving to delve deeper to calmly handle any unforeseen circumstances.
He could only postpone the trip to the temple.
Qin Sang stopped abruptly and immediately retrieved a talisman, writing a coded message on it and ordering, "Quickly deliver this to the狈 Demon."
The Serpent Demon acknowledged the command, not daring to delay. After Qin Sang's departure, it summoned a demonic wind and flew towards Ju Shanzhi.
Qin Sang also traveled south. Upon entering Star Island Immortal Lake, he discovered a large number of cultivators gathered at the lake's border.
These cultivators were disciples dispatched by various sects, guarding the border against any disturbances caused by the demon gods, which might attract the Ghost Fang Kingdom's army.
Qin Sang quietly passed through the defensive line and first visited Sword Heart Island to call upon Realperson Zhijian, deliberately suppressing his aura to avoid causing too much of a stir.
This time, Qin Sang stayed on Sword Heart Island for a longer period, consulting Realperson Zhijian on swordsmanship and engaging in several sparring matches.
He needed to master the sword technique he had obtained from the sword dao inheritance as quickly as possible. Every increase in strength would increase his chances.
After leaving Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang visited Master Qi on Gourd Island and received a second talisman message.
This message was from Master Gu.
In forty years, Master Gu had sent two messages, both containing her insights gained while comprehending the broken drum, written in code.
This was the agreement between her and Qin Sang.
Repairing the broken drum required Qin Sang's personal intervention, so Master Gu could only assist him with all her might, sharing her findings.
Her insights were interspersed with her understanding of the Dao of Refining, and any refiner who obtained them would treasure them immensely.
Unfortunately, Qin Sang had no interest in refining at the moment. He glanced over them perfunctorily and stored them away.
He discussed matters with Master Qi for several days and brought out the demon corpses he had accumulated to re-refine his gauntlets and Returning Wind Armor.
Regrettably, the Returning Wind Armor didn’t achieve a qualitative change, and the two treasures only received some enhancements.
Feeling the pressure of time, Qin Sang almost immediately rushed back to his cave dwelling to enter seclusion.
During this period of seclusion, Qin Sang put everything aside and devoted himself to comprehending the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*.
Following this, Qin Sang visited the Serpent Demon's temple at regular intervals, exchanging talisman messages with Mo Xingdao.
Three years passed in a flash.
On this day, Qin Sang wasn’t in his cave dwelling. He had ventured deep into the altar, braving one illusory scene after another.
Two figures were slowly flying towards the border between White Stone Altar and the孽 Wasteland.  They were Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao.
Mo Xingdao lagged slightly behind, observing Hong Yuzi’s back with flickering eyes.  Having been confined within the Dao Court, he was unsure whether there would be other helpers.
He could only hope Hong Yuzi was alone, so that he and Qin Sang, working together, would have a chance to escape.
After flying for a distance and passing over a narrow valley, Hong Yuzi glanced down, his gaze fixating slightly before sighing and shaking his head. “These demons are becoming increasingly rampant.”
Mo Xingdao followed his gaze and saw a statue erected within the valley, with some ghost people and spirits prostrating themselves in worship.
A demon god had actually dared to build a temple so close to the Dao Court.
……
Not long after their departure.
At the border between the Ghost Fang Kingdom and the孽 Wasteland, within a mountain cave dwelling, a charming woman was cultivating peacefully.
Suddenly, a streak of light flew into the cave dwelling, carrying a voice: “They’ve moved.”
The woman’s almond-shaped eyes snapped open, the corners of her lips curving into a breathtakingly beautiful smile.
