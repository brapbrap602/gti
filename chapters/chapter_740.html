<h1>Chapter 732: Swift Action</h1><p>Cui Ji loudly conceded defeat, startling those outside the hall who rushed in.  As a fellow member of the East Pole Alliance, Cui Ji's surrender left Qin Sang little choice but to comply, she put away her magic weapon and the Flying Night Yaksha.  The Merchant Alliance, though an alliance, was formed out of mutual interest, far looser than a sect. Still, it had its rules.  Publicly killing a manager of the Nine Stars Guild without a blood feud would invite the scrutiny of the entire Alliance.</p><p>"Take your people and get off Wu Yuan Island, now."</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, showing no mercy.</p><p>Cui Ji's expression shifted; the lingering sensation of sword energy left a deep impression.  Surrounded by various expressions, Cui Ji, burning with shame and anger, roared at his Nine Stars Guild subordinates, "What are you all standing around for? Get back, pack up, and leave!"</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>Qin Sang raised a hand. "Fellow Daoists, you came and went in haste. Carrying so much cargo through the Demon Sea is inconvenient, not to mention attracting thieves. As fellow members of the Merchant Alliance, we have a duty to help alleviate your burden. We can take care of your goods, have them tallied, and deliver them to the Nine Stars Guild. You can travel light."</p><p>"You… you're pushing it!"</p><p>Cui Ji's face flushed, his lips trembling. This cunning cultivator was speaking nicely, but once the fat was in his belly, there was no way he'd spit it out.  He'd probably send a pile of junk to the Nine Stars Guild later, that's the sort of infuriating thing he would do.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored Cui Ji, turning to the others. "Everyone here is a manager from various merchant guilds, well-versed in the value of treasures. Let's tally everything together, with everyone as witnesses.  How does that sound, fellow Daoists?"</p><p>Everyone's gaze shifted between Qin Sang and Cui Ji.  The hall was in chaos. The battle had ended quickly, leaving minimal damage, just deep holes blasted by the purple haze. They still couldn't fathom how Qin Sang had defeated Cui Ji, forcing his surrender.</p><p>They had initially hoped that a powerful cultivator capable of rivaling Cui Ji had arrived, leading to a conflict that would weaken both sides.  That would benefit them.</p><p>But instead, the battle was decisive, and Cui Ji was completely outmatched.  They'd gotten rid of a wolf, only to invite a tiger. This was the worst possible outcome.</p><p>Some secretly considered mediating for Cui Ji, but dared not speak in front of Qin Sang.  From the moment Qin Sang entered, she had controlled the situation, leaving no time for alliances to form, forcing immediate choices.  To speak up for the Nine Stars Guild now was to invite their own expulsion; this person might even deny them the chance to leave the island.</p><p>However, judging from what she'd said, she seemed willing to share the spoils, unlike Cui Ji’s tyrannical methods.</p><p>Everyone understood: the strong make the rules. They knew how to choose, readily agreeing with Qin Sang, some even swearing oaths.</p><p>"Qingfeng Daoist is right, the journey is long, with so much cargo, it's difficult to arrange escorts and it would attract unwanted attention..."</p><p>"Daoist Cui, rest assured, we guarantee that the Nine Stars Guild's goods will be safe..."</p><p>...</p><p>Cui Ji was furious, his face livid.  But when he saw Qin Sang place a hand on the head of his capable subordinate, two icy glares shooting from beneath her cloak, devoid of emotion, Cui Ji’s heart turned cold.  He had no doubt that if he uttered a single word of dissent, Qin Sang would kill him instantly.</p><p>The fence-sitters had all switched sides; the tide had turned.  Moreover, Cui Ji had been trying to contact his Purple Shadow Orb, only to find his life-bound treasure severely damaged, with no chance of recovery in the short term. He hadn't even seen clearly what that red light was.  This method of defiling magical treasures was incredibly strange and insidious—something Cui Ji had never seen before.</p><p>"Fine! Fine!"</p><p>Cui Ji gritted his teeth, swallowing his anger. He ordered his men to carry his subordinate and left without looking back.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang and the other guild managers left, appearing amicable and cheerful.  But as soon as they were gone, they cursed Qin Sang as a shameless and wicked cultivator, no better than Cui Ji, then eagerly followed the Wang sisters to loot the Nine Stars Guild.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of changing the structure Cui Ji had established.  Having swallowed the Nine Stars Guild, she was now the ruler of Wu Yuan Island and wouldn't let this opportunity to seize wealth slip away. Of course, she was slightly better than Cui Ji, not pushing the other guilds so hard, willingly sharing some profits to keep them pacified.</p><p>The Wang sisters led a contingent to discreetly handle the Nine Stars Society's affairs, while Qin Sang walked towards the shop alone.</p><p>By this time, he had put the Nine Stars Society behind him, and was using a nautical chart to select a suitable cultivation location near Wu Yuan Island.</p><p>His swift resolution of the Nine Stars Society's troubles and the expulsion of Cui Ji ultimately stemmed from his own strength and confidence.  He wouldn't let the trading company hinder his progress. The Wang sisters were more than enough to handle it.</p><p>Near Wu Yuan Island,妖兽 (yao shou - demonic beasts) were incredibly dense, often appearing in packs. While there weren't as many Nascent Soul-stage demonic beasts as in the Qian Yao Sea, Qin Sang couldn't find a suitable place on the chart, and decided to search after leaving the island.</p><p>He entered the shop.  The old man had returned.  Closing the door, he approached Qin Sang and whispered, “Daoist Master, I had people watching the Nine Stars Society. They split into three groups. Cui Ji and his key lieutenant have mysteriously disappeared; we don't know which group they're with.”</p><p>“He's cautious,” Qin Sang sneered, then added after a moment, “Forget it. Just have our people be careful.  As long as they don't leave Wu Yuan Island rashly, the Nine Stars Society won't dare act up here.  Remember to send a message to Elder Zou, reporting everything that happened today…  From now on, Wang Daoist will manage the trading company's affairs, with your assistance. Unless it's a life-or-death crisis, don't disturb me…”</p><p>“Yes,” the old man replied, his respect for Qin Sang deepening. He was thrilled; the Qiong Yu Trading Company's rise meant his own status would also increase.</p><p>After giving his instructions, Qin Sang returned to his cultivation cave provided by the trading company. He spent several months on Wu Yuan Island, deliberately befriending local experts, helping the Wang sisters stabilize the situation, and securing the Qiong Yu Trading Company's footing before quietly leaving the island.</p><p>With the help of his Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, Qin Sang searched and finally found a suitable island. After contacting the Wang sisters, he established his cultivation cave there.</p><p>On Wu Yuan Island, he was respected and served. But here, he woke to the vast demon sea, facing constant danger. His cave was just a mountain hollow carved out with his sword.  Yet, Qin Sang preferred the freedom of this remote location to the intrigues of Wu Yuan Island.</p><p>He summoned his Sky Eye Butterfly. The thunder cocoon hadn't broken, but instead seemed to be thickening.  He didn't know how much longer the butterfly would remain dormant.</p>
