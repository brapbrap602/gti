<h1>Chapter 1259: Feigning an Open Path</h1><p>The four figures—Tongyou Demon Lord, Xiang Qing, Chongyi Daoist, and Qing Jun—each held a talisman in their hands. Originally, one of the jade talismans was to be entrusted to Dongyang Bo, but after his unexpected disappearance, Chongyi Daoist took his place. Qin Sang and the others stood behind the four, guided by them to jointly activate the jade talismans and unleash the Dual Nine Palaces Formation.</p><p>From within the jade talismans, the illusory image of a celestial palace emerged, releasing swirling streams of yin and yang energy. Some were as large as buckets, others as small as chess pieces, resembling stars that were either bright or dim. In an instant, a river of stars cascaded down, manifesting the Eight Trigrams and solidifying the Nine Palaces, transforming into a terrestrial formation.</p><p>Above was the Li trigram, below the Kan trigram; to the left was the Zhen trigram, and to the right the Dui trigram. The Gen, Xun, Kun, and Qian trigrams occupied the four corners. In a flash, the figures of the group vanished into the grand formation, leaving only the formation diagram slowly rotating. This was the True Nine Palaces Formation, derived from the Later Heaven Eight Trigrams—a profound orthodox formation with infinite variations.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>As soon as the formation was completed, a torrent of blood-red light surged out from the banner gates. Even more astonishing was that after the blood-red light enveloped the Dual Nine Palaces Formation, all the lethal threats they had encountered earlier in the Black Tower Formation reappeared within the banner gates. This gave Qin Sang and the others the illusion that they were trapped within the Black Tower Formation, and that someone was actively controlling it—a living formation.</p><p>Of course, the power of the Banner Gate Formation could not compare to that of the Black Tower Formation, but it still made everyone frown with a sense of foreboding.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Countless blood-red thunderbolts erupted from the banner gates, raining down and exploding violently. The Dual Nine Palaces Formation trembled violently, submerged in the blood-red thunder, suffering a fierce assault.</p><p>The group maintained the Dual Nine Palaces Formation, hiding within the Nine Palaces, making it impossible for external attacks to penetrate. They attempted to break through the Banner Gate Formation and rush into the entrance of the blood pool. From Jingyu, they had learned that below lay a blood pool, its surface covered with black chains, where an ancient cultivator was sealed at the bottom. The Corpse Flower Blood Amber was also there.</p><p>Earlier, only Jiang Chenzi and his group had appeared in the Banner Gate Formation, with no sign of the Old Demon Ye. It was clear that the Old Demon Ye was busy breaking the seal of the blood pool and had no time to spare here, leaving Jiang Chenzi to lead the formation and block their path.</p><p>With all their experts present, working together to activate the Dual Nine Palaces Formation, and given that this formation was no less powerful than the Banner Gate Formation, Qin Sang, for the sake of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and the ancient cultivator, also fully cooperated, secretly using the secret techniques of the Witch Clan to enhance his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability, searching for flaws in the Banner Gate Formation.</p><p>In their initial plan, they had thought it would not be difficult to break through the Banner Gate Formation while the Old Demon Ye was distracted. However, they had not anticipated that the Banner Gate Formation would be far more powerful than they had imagined.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord and Qing Jun exchanged a glance, then simultaneously let out a loud shout, casting a spell together, pushing the formation's power to its limit.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A brilliant light erupted as two pillars of light—one black, one white—shot into the sky, countering the blood-red light and turning the Banner Gate Formation upside down. The two formations collided violently.</p><p>But no matter how hard they tried, they could not find a clear flaw, and they remained firmly blocked here!</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly took advantage of the collision between the two formations to search everywhere, but the blood-red light was too dense. Its vision penetrated layer after layer of obstruction, slowly and painstakingly combing through, making progress agonizingly slow.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally noticed a clue and exclaimed, "Bad news! The Banner Gate Formation can actually connect with the blood mist in the Black Tower Formation, drawing power from it!"</p><p>Everyone was shocked upon hearing this, realizing that the Old Demon Ye's understanding of this place far exceeded their expectations. He had actually refined three treasure banners, using them as a bridge to draw power from the Black Tower Formation! No wonder the Banner Gate Formation was so powerful.</p><p>Even if the Old Demon Ye was not personally controlling the formation, they would not be able to break through the blockade in a short time. By the time they did, the Old Demon Ye would have already succeeded.</p><p>"Unless we consume our vital essence to forcibly activate the formation's core, but doing so would severely deplete our energy, leaving us too weak to contend with the Old Demon Ye even if we break through," Qing Jun said gravely.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow. Although the Corpse Flower Blood Amber was not something he absolutely needed, a treasure that could directly enhance Nascent Soul cultivation was extremely rare in the world, and he could not afford to miss it.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he turned to Jingyu and asked, "The Black Tower is in ruins, but could the ancient restrictions at its core have remained intact despite the chaos of ancient times? Do you remember what you saw back then?"</p><p>Jingyu immediately understood Qin Sang's intention. The Corpse Flower Blood Amber was crucial to her tribulation, so she immediately began to ponder deeply, carefully recalling her experiences from that time. After a moment, she said repeatedly, "The ancient restrictions here are far more intact than elsewhere, but they have also been impacted and are damaged in places. However, when I discovered the ancient cultivator's plot, I was focused on escaping and didn't have time to examine them closely. I only remember a few spots, but I'm not sure if those places are passable."</p><p>Feigning an open path while secretly advancing elsewhere.</p><p>Seeing that the Banner Gate Formation could not be breached after prolonged attacks, Qin Sang came up with this plan. Otherwise, continuing to stalemate here would only result in a futile effort. Not only would they fail to capture the ancient cultivator, but the Corpse Flower Blood Amber would also be taken by the Old Demon Ye.</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone exchanged glances, feeling that it was worth a try.</p><p>"Staying here and exhausting ourselves is not a solution. For now, we can only follow Fellow Daoist Mingyue's plan and give it a try," Qing Jun nodded, then added, "It's best not to let the Sin Abyss detect our movements, or else complications will arise. We must leave some people to continue maintaining the Dual Nine Palaces Formation and not withdraw too many hands."</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord agreed, "Indeed, doing so has two additional benefits. The collision of the formations will create shockwaves that can mask our infiltration. Moreover, appearing unexpectedly before the Old Demon Ye will make it easier for us to succeed. The Reverse Nine Palaces Formation is primarily for trapping and killing, so when the time comes, the person controlling the formation must remember to adjust the formation's stance to firmly restrain the Banner Gate Formation and prevent them from returning to reinforce the Old Demon Ye."</p><p>If what lay below was an ancient cultivator's treasure vault or an ancient secret realm, they might have argued over who would go first. After all, the first to enter would have the best chance of obtaining the most valuable treasures.</p><p>But now, their target was an ancient cultivator. As long as they could capture him and extract the ancient secrets, everyone would benefit. Moreover, facing the Old Demon Ye directly would inevitably be dangerous, while staying outside under the protection of the Dual Nine Palaces Formation was the safest option.</p><p>Thus, no one argued, and the selection was quickly decided.</p><p>The most troublesome part was the person who would hold the jade talisman.</p><p>To deceive Jiang Chenzi and the others, the power of the Dual Nine Palaces Formation could not weaken too noticeably. Chongyi Daoist and his two disciples had unique cultivation techniques. After taking certain pills, their strength increased significantly, but they also faced some limitations, such as not being able to separate too far from each other, reducing their flexibility.</p><p>Facing the Old Demon Ye, who had been renowned for many years, they knew they could not deceive his eyes. It was better to leave the jade talismans in their hands. The three of them could work together, with each holding one talisman.</p><p>The other choice was somewhat unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang had thought it would be his senior sister. Having obtained the treasures of the Yuan Shen Sect, she was quite accomplished in the art of formations. With her in charge of the Dual Nine Palaces Formation, it would be foolproof.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Tongyou Demon Lord directly chose Qing Jun to accompany them, leaving Xiang Qing to control the formation. Xiang Qing had already refined several strands of the Ancestral Sacred Flame, greatly increasing his strength. In Tongyou Demon Lord's eyes, Qing Jun's strength surpassed even Xiang Qing's.</p>
