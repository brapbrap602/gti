<h1>Chapter 1250: The Trap</h1><p>Although Qin Sang was not troubled by the demonic tribulation, his heart was clouded, and external distractions could not dispel the haze. Qing Jun, who had once borne a deep-seated hatred and fallen into a demonic abyss before struggling free, empathized with Qin Sang. Yet, she knew that directly pointing out his inner turmoil would yield little result. Qin Sang had just clashed with Dongyang Bo, and this was precisely the best moment to guide him.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Sister, for your guidance," Qin Sang said, his eyes flickering with uncertainty before finally settling into calmness. He felt a clarity in his mind, as if a layer of dust had been swept away. The resentment that had festered for two hundred years, born from being treated as a mere plaything and manipulated by others, was no trivial matter. Today, he finally found release. Were it not for the crowd, he would have bowed deeply to his senior sister. Of course, this did not mean he had forgotten his enmity with Dongyang Bo—only a saint could achieve such a feat. As the saying goes, "The tree may wish for peace, but the wind will not cease." Dongyang Bo would not let this matter rest, and future entanglements were inevitable. What needed to be done still had to be done. However, Qin Sang could now face it with composure. His gaze no longer lingered on the past but looked toward the next heavenly tribulation and a higher realm.</p><p>Qing Jun nodded with a smile and shifted the conversation. "This Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet likely originates from the path of talisman soldiers. However, as the great Dao is interconnected, after this matter is settled, I can try to help you find a method to control it. In doing so, I may also gain some insights. Even if this puppet is not the strongest to emerge in the North Star Realm, it is not far from it."</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "The puppet is inhabited by a hundred ghosts. Controlling it will not be easy."</p><p>"Dongyang Bo already knows it's you. There's no need to continue disguising yourself as a demon king. Rather than letting Dongyang Bo use this against you, it would be better to reveal your identity proactively," Qing Jun reminded him.</p><p>Qin Sang had also considered this. He glanced around at the crowd and said, "Directly revealing my identity would be too abrupt. We need to find the right moment. The demon race will also need an explanation."</p><p>As they conversed in hushed tones, the rest of the group had gathered. Tongyou Demon Lord spoke, "Earlier, Fellow Daoist Xiang and I went ahead to investigate. We confirmed that the direction from which the blood souls are coming aligns with the location of the earlier anomaly. These blood souls are extremely peculiar—they appeared suddenly. Combined with the earlier anomaly, it's possible that Old Demon Ye triggered an ancient restriction and accidentally released them."</p><p>"Does the Demon Lord mean we should head directly to the location of the anomaly?" someone asked.</p><p>Tongyou Demon Lord shook his head. "We'll split into two groups! Both the basin's center and the anomaly site are possible targets. Old Demon Ye is cunning. He may have deliberately created the anomaly to mislead us, so we must investigate both. The Sin Abyss has some tricks up its sleeve. Sending individuals to scout alone would be like sending lambs to the slaughter. We'll divide into two teams and form formations. If we encounter the Sin Abyss, we can hold our ground for a while. Once we locate them, remember to exercise restraint. Do not provoke them. Send a message to the other team and wait for everyone to gather before taking action. This will delay us somewhat, but with the ancient restrictions densely scattered here, they won't be able to make quick progress either."</p><p>These two locations were the most unusual and the most likely targets of Old Demon Ye. They had initially suspected the basin's center, but the interference made it difficult to determine which one it was. Given the circumstances, the group did not argue for long and chose to trust Tongyou Demon Lord's judgment.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun joined Chongyi Daoist and the others heading to the anomaly site, while Tongyou Demon Lord led the other half of the group toward the basin's center. Along the way, the number of blood souls increased. With their guard up, they avoided repeating past mistakes. They cut through the blood souls with ease, speeding up their progress, but remained vigilant to prevent an ambush by the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun walked side by side, occasionally releasing Fat Chicken to sense its kin. After a while, they finally reached their destination without incident.</p><p>"It's a mountain of corpses!" someone exclaimed, looking up at the scene before them with shock and uncertainty.</p><p>Before them stood a mountain, not particularly tall compared to the majestic ranges on the basin's periphery. The entire mountain was enveloped in a blood-red mist. However, the mountain was eerily strange. Ancient restrictions permeated its slopes, and a bloody glow filled the area, obscuring their vision. Yet, the mountain's peak was exposed. On the sheer cliffs surrounding the summit hung massive black iron cages, each large enough to hold three or four people. Most of the cages were severely damaged, but a few remained intact, containing skeletons bound in chains. The cages hung there, enduring the erosion of the yin wind and various tortures, tormenting their occupants to death.</p><p>The group trembled with fear. Those trapped in the cages must have been far more powerful than them, yet they had been imprisoned and left to die, reduced to mere bones.</p><p>Upon arriving, they did not see Old Demon Ye or his followers. However, they noticed a violent disturbance in the bloody glow behind the mountain, clearly indicating something unusual.</p><p>"That's where the bloody light shot into the sky earlier, illuminating the blood mist!" Qing Jun said gravely.</p><p>The group circled to the back of the mountain and saw a massive blood-red archway standing at the base, with a stone staircase leading straight up. The archway was dilapidated, its inscriptions long worn away. The steps, whatever their original color, had been stained blood-red by the mist.</p><p>"There's no one at the base, but Fellow Daoist Tongyou hasn't sent any news either. Let's form a formation and head up. Everyone, be careful," Chongyi Daoist said, taking the lead with his two disciples guarding his flanks.</p><p>Qing Jun walked at the rear, while Qin Sang was positioned in the middle. Knowing Qin Sang's keen perception, they tasked him with focusing on his mystical arts. Qin Sang was content with the arrangement, silently activating his Heavenly Eye technique to remain vigilant against any ambushes. The group moved cautiously, encountering ancient restrictions as they passed under the archway and slowly ascended.</p><p>Unnoticed by Qin Sang, shortly after they entered the mountain, a figure silently emerged from the void in the distance—it was Old Demon Ye's blood demon avatar. The avatar sneered, "Tongyou, you old devil, is indeed cunning. But luring half their forces here is worth the effort. It's a pity that brat Mingyue is also here, making it difficult to approach. Otherwise, I would have let you taste the ancient restrictions of the Corpse Mountain! A mere demon dares to meddle in human affairs? Foolish!"</p><p>The avatar vanished into the blood mist with a cold snort. His arrangements here were not limited to this, but he had to abandon them due to Qin Sang's presence. Even with Tongyou Demon Lord's vigilance, Old Demon Ye had succeeded. This was an open scheme, designed only to delay their progress. With the Cold Domain forced to split their forces and act cautiously, Old Demon Ye and his followers would have more time.</p><p>...</p><p>"Not good! We've been tricked!" Chongyi Daoist suddenly shouted halfway up the mountain. The communication sword in his hand trembled—it was a message from Tongyou Demon Lord.</p><p>The group exchanged glances. Just as Tongyou Demon Lord had predicted, Old Demon Ye had set a trap here, using the blood souls to lure them in and conceal his true objective. They didn't know what method Old Demon Ye had used to draw the blood souls here to block their path. Fortunately, he couldn't control them, or they would have had no choice but to flee in disarray.</p><p>"Let's go!" Without hesitation, the group swiftly descended the mountain and rushed toward the basin's center. They encountered no obstacles along the way, but when they arrived, they still saw no sign of Old Demon Ye or his followers. Two blood-red gates stood tightly shut, with Tongyou Demon Lord and the others exerting their full strength to break them open.</p>
