<h1>Chapter 1548: The Illusory Realm of Qingxu</h1><p>Chapter 1548: The Illusory Realm of Qingxu</p><p>Master Mo, bewildered by Daoist Luo Rong's expression, felt increasingly uneasy, even experiencing a sudden urge to flee.</p><p>The palanquin arrived before the mountain.</p><p>A look of apprehension flashed across Daoist Luo Rong's eyes as he secretly crushed a ring on his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, bowing slightly, and said, "This must be Daoist Luo Rong of the Six Emptiness Sect? My Daoist name is Qingfeng. I've long admired your reputation!"</p><p>"My Daoist name is indeed Luo Rong. I consider myself well-connected, with many ties to Daoist colleagues, but I don't believe I've met Daoist Qingfeng before.  May I ask where you hail from?"</p><p>Luo Rong's expression had returned to normal, a forced smile playing on his lips.</p><p>"I'm an insignificant wanderer, a nameless person. It's understandable that you wouldn't know me," Qin Sang gestured towards the welcoming hall, "Please."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's evasiveness and unwillingness to reveal his origins,</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong's face darkened, and his tone turned cold, "No need! I've already heard Master Mo's explanation and understand your intentions. Let's proceed with the matter at hand."</p><p>A commotion arose among the crowd.</p><p>The Xie family members stood behind Qin Sang.</p><p>The Six Emptiness Sect disciples brought by Daoist Luo Rong and Master Mo stood on the ground.</p><p>The two sides were clearly separated.</p><p>Master Mo looked numb; the ownership of Mount Pu was no longer his concern.</p><p>The Six Emptiness Sect disciples formed a defensive formation behind Daoist Luo Rong, secretly on guard.</p><p>"You are indeed a decisive person."</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to ignore the Six Emptiness Sect disciples' actions, turning towards Mount Pu's main peak, "This mountain was originally the Xie family's ancestral land, their incense line unbroken.  The Six Emptiness Sect is the largest sect in the vicinity, a fact you should be aware of, Daoist Luo.  The Luo Yan Sect drove the Xie family down the mountain, seizing Mount Pu and refusing to relinquish it – this is unjust. Shouldn't it be returned?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong said calmly, "The Central Plains, the nineteen rain-swept states. I dare not speak for other states, but at least in Zhuo State, peace prevails.  Forcibly occupying another's Daoist grounds is unthinkable. If it were to happen, we of the Six Emptiness Sect would not stand idly by, even without your intervention. As far as I know, the Xie family made a deal with the Luo Yan Sect using Mount Pu as collateral, and our sect was a witness. Is this not the case?"</p><p>Master Mo nodded numbly.</p><p>An elderly Golden Core cultivator stepped forward, "Reporting to my uncle, I was the witness at the time. The Luo Yan Sect temporarily borrowed Mount Pu, leaving their treasured Qingluo Canopy as collateral with the Xie family, with an agreed upon return date. Now that time has passed, the Xie family has destroyed the Qingluo Canopy and cannot return the treasure. As per the agreement, Mount Pu should belong to the Luo Yan Sect."</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong chuckled, shaking his head in what seemed to be pity for Qin Sang, "Did you hear that? You've only heard the Xie family's side, which is likely biased and misleading. The Central Plains has its rules, and rules should not be disregarded. You are a celestial figure, free and unconstrained, why bother with this muddy water, damaging your reputation?"</p><p>Qin Sang clapped his hands.</p><p>Xie Qian stepped forward, presenting a wooden box.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the box, taking out a light green gauze curtain. Gently shaking it out, the curtain unfurled, transforming into a wisp of green smoke – a magical treasure.</p><p>However, this treasure's brilliance was dim, its power a mere tenth of its former strength, impossible to restore.</p><p>"Whether this treasure was destroyed by the Xie family is questionable. I pride myself on my skills in artifact refinement; there are at least ten ways to cause a treasure to self-destruct. This is a minor trick; younger cultivators may be deceived, your sect disciples and the Luo Yan Sect might be misled, but you, Daoist Luo, surely see through it. As for why I must intervene…"</p><p>Qin Sang did not dwell on the reason for the Qingluo Canopy's damage, his gaze shifting to Master Mo, "Master Mo, would you open the protective mountain formation?"</p><p>Master Mo instinctively looked at Daoist Luo Rong.</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong frowned, saying sternly, "Open it!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Master Mo hurriedly flew towards the main peak.</p><p>Upon seeing their master's demeanor, the Luo Yan Sect disciples fell silent, huddled together, the main peak eerily quiet.</p><p>The clouds and mist parted on the main peak.</p><p>Qin Sang, walking on clouds, led the Xie family disciples up the main peak.</p><p>Daoist Luo Rong watched Qin Sang's back intently, his sleeves waving as he followed.</p><p>Moments later, they arrived at the Xie family stone.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward alone, touching the Xie family stone, stroking it gently, letting out a barely audible sigh, "The Xie family stone was erected by the Xie family's ancestors and has always been their symbol, used to test spiritual roots and transmit skills.</p><p>Outsiders are unaware of its other function.  Because of its unique material, it once absorbed the ancestral blood essence.  A member of the Xie family, upon contact with the Xie Family Stone, will feel a connection.</p><p>Before the words were finished, a faint white light illuminated the top of the Xie Family Stone, its texture transforming into smooth jade.</p><p>This sight astonished not only Luo Rong Dao Ren and the others, but also Xie Qian and Xie An.</p><p>Qin Sang's words were entirely true.</p><p>Only those of Xie family bloodline could trigger this change in the Xie Family Stone.</p><p>The Xie family is increasingly declining, lacking resources and unable to support all its branches. Could this Yuan Ying master be a lost member of the Xie family?</p><p>In an instant, the expressions of the Xie family members changed from shock to ecstatic joy.</p><p>“Are you a member of the Xie family?”</p><p>Luo Rong Dao Ren's face also changed.</p><p>An outsider helping the Xie family reclaim Pushan Mountain and the return of the Xie family ancestor are two different concepts.</p><p>This means a new Yuan Ying power will emerge within the Six Emptiness Sect's territory – a mid-stage Yuan Ying expert!</p><p>Perhaps it could be negotiated before, but now they absolutely cannot readily agree!</p><p>Luo Rong Dao Ren, without concealing his intentions, released his spiritual sense, scanning the Xie Family Stone repeatedly. He even personally tested it, but couldn't find any trace of manipulation by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, saying nothing.</p><p>Indeed, only Xie family blood could activate the Xie Family Stone.</p><p>However, he could also subtly manipulate the restriction left by Xiao Xiangzi in the Qingxu Illusionary Realm to mimic the effect.</p><p>The Xie family still doesn't understand this restriction.</p><p>Back then, Xiao Xiangzi was furious. If the Qingxu Illusionary Realm hadn't been so strong, he might have destroyed the place. The remaining restriction is extremely powerful and well-hidden.</p><p>Furthermore, Luo Rong Dao Ren's cultivation was inferior to Qin Sang's, so he naturally couldn't detect Qin Sang's methods.</p><p>Luo Rong Dao Ren's expression shifted, contemplating how to respond, when his eyes suddenly lit up. His expression softened slightly, his lips moving as if communicating with someone.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop Luo Rong Dao Ren, but instead tilted his head, looking towards the sky.</p><p>The sky was cloudless.</p><p>The sky was a clear blue, unobstructed.</p><p>In the empty void, subtle ripples suddenly appeared, then two figures in Taoist robes materialized out of thin air. They were the other two Yuan Ying masters of the Six Emptiness Sect.</p><p>One was a female cultivator, Jing Ning, whose realm was similar to Luo Rong Dao Ren's, both early-stage Yuan Ying.</p><p>The other was an aged Taoist priest, holding a whisk, appearing ethereal and refined. He was Cheng Huanzi, the current head of the Six Emptiness Sect, the most powerful of the three, a mid-stage Yuan Ying.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Luo Rong Dao Ren sensed danger and secretly contacted his sect.</p><p>Now, three Yuan Ying masters of the Six Emptiness Sect appeared in Pushan Mountain.</p><p>“I am Cheng Huanzi.”</p><p>The voice shook the earth.</p><p>By the time he finished the last word, Cheng Huanzi had already appeared beside Luo Rong Dao Ren, followed by Jing Ning.</p><p>“Senior Brother, Junior Sister.”</p><p>Luo Rong Dao Ren bowed.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi nodded, looking at Qin Sang and waving his whisk. “Our Daoist sect truly produces outstanding talents. Only after receiving my junior brother's message did I learn of Qingfeng Dao Long’s arrival. We failed to greet you properly, please forgive us.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect that a small matter between juniors would disturb the meditation of three Daoist friends. I am truly sorry,” Qin Sang chuckled, his tone laced with sarcasm.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi glanced at the Xie Family Stone and said solemnly, “We understand the situation. My methods may not match yours, but I have ways to deceive others and trigger a reaction from this strange stone, mimicking a Xie family member.  Using this as proof seems rather flimsy, Daoist friend.”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned cold, he coldly snorted, “Absurd! I wish to return to my homeland and revive my family. Must I obtain approval from outsiders like you?”</p><p>“No, no! Daoist friend misunderstands!”</p><p>Cheng Huanzi shook his head, “The Central Plains, with its flourishing immortal cultivation, is far superior to the Northern Wilderness and Western Desert, largely due to its long-standing stability. Countless people with ulterior motives infiltrate, attempting to create chaos and usurp territories, often resulting in disastrous consequences. We must remain vigilant. We are merely acting for the greater good, identifying evil, and hope you understand.”</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, no sect wants to offend a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>However, allowing this person to occupy Pushan Mountain will create even bigger problems later!</p><p>Their positioning was strategic, forming a semi-circle around Qin Sang, creating a subtle encirclement.</p><p>The three Yuan Ying masters’ auras combined, silently suppressing Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze across the three, a cold smile playing on his lips.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi’s eyes narrowed slightly, continuing, “I have a bloodline testing method. If you truly are a Xie family descendant, please offer a drop of your essence blood. If you pass the test, it will at least prove your identity.”</p><p>The more Qin Sang acted, the less Cheng Huanzi believed him.  Such a coincidence seemed too unlikely.</p><p>Master Mo's guess was likely correct;  Pu Mountain holds a great secret!</p><p>"Friend, you're mistaken!"</p><p>Suddenly, a strange voice echoed from afar, like rolling thunder, clearly audible to everyone.</p><p>A fierce wind swept across Pu Mountain.</p><p>A white cloud appeared in the sky, and two figures approached side by side.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng, I have succeeded in my mission. I have brought Elder Lu to ensure justice."</p><p>Qin Sang's true form nodded to his incarnation, then turned to Cheng Huanzi, "Essential blood is the foundation of a cultivator. How can it be easily given to another?"</p><p>The composure on Cheng Huanzi's face vanished instantly.</p><p>Firstly, Qin Sang's true form's cultivation was no weaker than his incarnation, and now there was another Yuan Ying expert of unknown origin!</p><p>Secondly, there was Lu Zhang beside Qin Sang.</p><p>"Elder Lu!"</p><p>Why was Lu Zhang here?</p><p>In an instant, Cheng Huanzi considered many possibilities.</p><p>"Long time no see, friend. Your cultivation has become even more refined," Lu Zhang nodded, explaining, "I happened to be passing through Fudou County and heard of an injustice.  On a whim, I came,  unaware that three friends had already arrived."</p><p>Without waiting for Cheng Huanzi's reply, Lu Zhang looked at the Qingluo Tent in Qin Sang's incarnation's hand, "Is this it?"</p><p>He summoned the Qingluo Tent into his own hand.</p><p>Lu Zhang clasped his hands, briefly examined it, and his anger became evident.  He roared, "This item was crafted with mutually conflicting spiritual materials, deliberately concealed. Over time, even without use in battle, it would self-destruct. The refiner's heart is punishable! Who is the sect master of Luo Yan Sect?!"</p><p>Little Pu Mountain.</p><p>Six Yuan Ying masters had gathered.</p><p>Master Mo never imagined things would escalate to this point. He was heartbroken and wished he'd led his people down the mountain from the start.</p><p>'Thump!'</p><p>Master Mo, ashen-faced, knelt on the ground, desperately trying to salvage the situation.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Master Mo kowtowed repeatedly, weeping, "The Qingluo Tent was my master's relic. I truly didn't know its origin. Please forgive me! Forgive me, senior! Master, Master, save me…"</p><p>He shifted all the blame onto his deceased master.</p><p>A sect master, a respected Golden Core cultivator, reduced to a stray dog.</p><p>The Luo Yan Sect members were terrified, their fear reaching its peak.</p><p>"Wretch!"</p><p>Lu Zhang disdained Master Mo and looked at Cheng Huanzi and the others, "This person deliberately used a flawed treasure to scheme against others, plotting against their spiritual mountain. His intentions are sinister! What do the three friends think?"</p><p>Master Mo continued begging Luo Rong Daoist for help.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoist wished he could kick him away.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi watched Lu Zhang's actions coldly, but remained calm.</p><p>Lu Zhang's presence here was certainly not accidental.</p><p>In fact, the mastermind was likely the Bu Nian Mountain Sect. Whether Pu Mountain had secrets was unimportant; Bu Nian Mountain merely used this as a pretext, inserting a pawn into Fudou County.</p><p>Pu Mountain's ownership and whether the person was the Xie family ancestor were irrelevant.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi was concerned about Bu Nian Mountain's motives.</p><p>These two Yuan Ying cultivators of unknown origin, willingly serving Bu Nian Mountain, were clearly targeting the Liu Xu Sect. Was this to restrain them, or to expel them?</p><p>Cheng Huanzi regretted not contacting Longju Cave Heaven before coming.</p><p>The appearance of an unknown mid-Yuan Ying cultivator within the territory should have raised alarms.</p><p>His thoughts raced, and Cheng Huanzi, knowing they were no match, decided to employ a delaying tactic. He lightly coughed and said, "Whether Luo Yan Sect acted with malicious intent cannot be determined. It may be a misunderstanding; Luo Yan Sect might also be a victim.  Of course, this transaction lacks foundation and is no longer necessary. Pu Mountain should be returned to the Xie family."</p><p>Lu Zhang seemed slightly displeased but didn't react, returning the Qingluo Tent to Qin Sang's incarnation, "I cannot stay long. I believe you will all uncover the truth."</p><p>Qin Sang's true form smiled, "I believe the Liu Xu Sect will mete out just rewards and punishments."</p><p>No one cared about the fate of Luo Yan Sect and Master Mo.</p><p>The atmosphere eased.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi looked at Qin Sang's true form, "May I ask who you are, Daoist friend?"</p><p>"My surname is Qin, and my given name is Sang. I am an overseas cultivator," Qin Sang used the same explanation.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Cheng Huanzi's expression changed, "Daoist Qingfeng also cultivates his abilities overseas?  I've heard that overseas sects differ from those in the Central Plains. I've always been curious but haven't had the chance to meet overseas cultivators.  May I boldly request some guidance from you, Daoist?"</p><p>If only Qin Sang and Daoist Qingfeng were present, Cheng Huanzi wouldn't have been so rash.</p><p>With Lu Zhang here, however, he was not afraid. He used this opportunity to propose a sparring match to test them.</p><p>Qin Sang's incarnation was about to step forward, but his true form stopped him.</p><p>"I will be returning to my mountain soon, and I also regret not having the chance to spar with cultivators from the Central Plains.  It seems we share the same thought, Daoist. May I have the honor?"</p>
