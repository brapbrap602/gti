Chapter 584: The Disciple's Treachery


At first, Qin Sang was skeptical, but after repeated confirmations, the information he extracted from Yu Hua proved accurate, allowing him to ambush and kill Daoist Jiupao, seizing his Golden Core. He suspected Yu Hua had a secret, high-ranking identity within the Kuiyin Sect, explaining his knowledge of Daoist Jiupao.  At the time, Yu Hua's Nascent Soul was sealed by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, and the three Golden Core cultivators of Kuiyin Sect were dead, leaving no way to verify his suspicions. Now, it seemed likely Yi Tiannie was behind it all. Yi Tiannie was Daoist Jiupao's uncle and had watched him grow up, so knowing Jiupao's secrets was not surprising. Daoist Jiupao's physical body was shattered, his Golden Core severely damaged, and he barely escaped with his life. Yi Tiannie didn't appear much stronger.  But what was the relationship between Yi Tiannie and Yu Hua? Why hadn't he contacted Daoist Jiupao, but instead investigated him secretly?

Hearing the name 'Yu Hua,' Yi Tiannie flew into a rage.

"That treacherous disciple! I barely escaped with a fragment of my soul and hid within his body. My lifespan was nearing its end, and I was gravely injured.  Fortunately, I had obtained a Ghost Dao secret technique. By burning my soul and forsaking reincarnation, I cultivated the Ghost Dao and prolonged my life.

"I never expected that wolf-hearted child, while outwardly obedient, would seize the opportunity during my weakened state after switching to Ghost Dao cultivation. He betrayed and attacked me, leaving me a wandering ghost.

"He then imprisoned my soul, treating me as a plaything, torturing and humiliating me to force me to reveal my secrets.

"I wish I could tear him to pieces!

"I also thank you for killing that beast, freeing me from his clutches, and avenging me by refining him into a living corpse, condemning him to eternal suffering!"

Qin Sang sneered, "He's condemned to eternal suffering, but are you any better off?"

He now understood how Yi Tiannie had survived. No one knew if reincarnation existed in this world, but everyone held onto a sliver of hope that Heaven would leave a glimmer of life in the face of despair. Ghost Dao secret techniques were notoriously sinister and vicious. Yi Tiannie's reliance on such a technique came at a steep price and couldn't last. Some techniques not only forfeited the ability to possess another body, but upon death, the soul would be completely annihilated, just like Yu Hua!

At the same time, Qin Sang realized why Yi Tiannie had waited so long to strike. While controlled by Yu Hua, Yi Tiannie's soul must have been incredibly weak. Otherwise, with his late Golden Core cultivation, a hundred Yu Huas wouldn't be able to suppress him.  To maintain control, Yu Hua would never allow him to recover. Qin Sang had captured Yu Hua, unaware of Yi Tiannie's presence, allowing him to hide and observe from within Yu Hua's body.  Even weakened, Yi Tiannie, with his former cultivation, could easily conceal himself from Qin Sang's senses. After all, Qin Sang's cultivation was only at the mid Foundation Establishment stage back then. Even now, with an external core, his spiritual sense remained at the Foundation Establishment level. Coupled with his lack of suspicion, he failed to detect Yi Tiannie, who had been hiding for decades. Yi Tiannie was remarkably patient, enduring humiliation and waiting for the right moment.

Thinking of this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing within. He suddenly understood how Yi Tiannie had gradually gained control of the Flying Night Devil.  Yi Tiannie's injuries must have been severe, remaining weak even after so many years. He only dared to attack after seizing the Flying Night Devil's body. Before refining Yu Hua into the Flying Night Devil, Qin Sang had kept Yu Hua by his side constantly.  At his weakest, Yi Tiannie, reduced to a wisp of a soul, dared not make a move. He could neither escape nor fight back, only lie in wait. He must have seized his opportunity during Qin Sang's battle with Daoist Jiupao!  In that battle, Qin Sang was determined to obtain the Golden Core, even willing to cripple the Flying Night Devil to kill Daoist Jiupao. No wonder the Flying Night Devil had fought with unexpected ferocity after being injured, without needing any urging.  It was likely Yi Tiannie, seeing his chance, had secretly influenced the fight, risking exposure. The chaos of the battle masked his actions.

Only when the Flying Night Devil was severely injured and extremely weak could Yi Tiannie take advantage and slowly attempt to seize control of the body.  Otherwise, his weakened soul wouldn't stand a chance. Qin Sang placed the Flying Night Devil in the Earth Sinkhole, giving Yi Tiannie free rein.  By possessing the body, he could instantly regain his Golden Core cultivation, an opportunity he wouldn't miss. This explained why the Flying Night Devil's injuries hadn't healed during the first year in the Earth Sinkhole. It was Yi Tiannie sabotaging the recovery process to seize the body.

Qin Sang gasped.  Yi Tiannie had lurked beside him for decades, like a venomous snake, while he remained oblivious. He felt incredibly fortunate.  Fortunate that his soul mark, reinforced by the Jade Buddha, was too strong for Yi Tiannie to break, preventing him from fully controlling the Flying Night Devil. Fortunate that he possessed the Void Thunder, deterring Yi Tiannie from acting rashly. Fortunate that he had always been cautious, rarely checking the Nine Phantasmal Orchid to prevent leaks, especially during the time Yu Hua was with him. Otherwise, the spiritual herb he had risked his life for would have been lost.  Had Yi Tiannie, after controlling the Flying Night Devil, also been coveting the herb?

Fortunate that he had refined an external core, a fact unknown to Yi Tiannie. Yi Tiannie wouldn't have guessed that by preventing the Flying Night Devil's recovery and seizing control, he had missed Qin Sang's Corpse Core formation. He chose the perfect time to strike.  Wanderer Yun was exhausted, unable to fight. Qin Sang had used the Void Thunder, eliminating his greatest threat. The Ten Yama King Banner was also not at hand. There couldn't have been a better moment. If not for his Corpse Core, Qin Sang would have been at Yi Tiannie's mercy, without a doubt. Yi Tiannie's ignorance of Qin Sang's Golden Core-equivalent strength led to his failure. Perhaps fate played a hand?

Facing Qin Sang's mockery, Yi Tiannie remained unfazed.  "If there truly is an afterlife, and I forget today's events, I'll be a different person. As long as I break through to Nascent Soul and live this life to the fullest, what does reincarnation matter? After I die, let the world be flooded!"

Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, detecting a hidden meaning in Yi Tiannie's words.

"Qin Sang, after that battle, Yu Hua searched everywhere for Zhao Yan but couldn't find him. Of the five, only you survived. The Nine Phantasmal Orchid fell into your hands, didn't it? I sacrificed my entire sect, only to pave the way for you."

Yi Tiannie sneered. "Hand over the Nine Phantasmal Orchid, or I'll crush the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, preventing you from forming your core!"
