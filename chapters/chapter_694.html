<h1>Chapter 686: Four Years</h1><p>After selecting a cave dwelling, Qin Sang gave the bone sword and bone spear to the man in gray robes and the old woman, respectively, then requested the most effective magical artifacts from the other three.  He wasn't stingy, directly refining the previously hunted Jiao corpse to enhance their artifacts’ power. He needed these people to help him search for demons, and providing them with more life-saving means would allow them to explore more areas. The Fuhu Sea area was almost at the edge of the Duoyan Island cultivators' activity zone, a chaotic place. While he wasn't requiring them to hunt demons, searching for powerful demon traces presented considerable danger.</p><p>Fortunately, few cultivators operated in the Fuhu Sea. In the vast ocean, encountering others was almost impossible; they didn't need to specifically guard against other cultivators.</p><p>Luckily, within a month of arriving in the Fuhu Sea, they found a suitable Red Jiao for Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally collecting nine Jiao dragon spirits, the power of the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman was fully activated. The original jade-scepter-shaped talisman transformed into a palm-sized jade Jiao dragon, resembling a living creature, slumbering in Qin Sang's energy sea.</p><p>Those unaware of its nature would never guess it was a talisman!</p><p>Once activated, a protective shield appeared around Qin Sang, with nine Jiao dragon shadows circling its surface.  Due to the five Red Jiao souls, the shield had a distinct fiery red hue, appearing like the legendary Nine Dragon Divine Fire Shield – quite extraordinary.</p><p>After its transformation, the fully activated talisman’s power exceeded even Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>During the Two Regions' Conflict, Qin Sang had witnessed numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators battling, silently comparing their abilities. Combined with his Sword Qi Thunder Sound, his escape speed slightly surpassed that of average late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Once he broke through to mid-stage Foundation Establishment, those late-stage cultivators would be far behind him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang estimated the talisman’s power had a limit. Even at the late stage, combined with Sword Qi Thunder Sound, he wouldn't achieve the escape speed comparable to a Nascent Soul master.</p><p>The four talismans of the Shangyuan Quiet Palace – the Inner Scene Yuan Talisman, the Heavenly Gang Dao Talisman, and the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman – were all treasures for Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>The last talisman was rumored to be related to the Nascent Soul stage but was exceptionally mysterious. Qin Sang had inquired for a long time but hadn't even learned its name, let alone its function.</p><p>Correspondingly, the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman's true energy consumption skyrocketed, even more terrifying than the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>The first time Qin Sang activated the complete Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, he was elated and slightly carried away.  He only realized his true energy was almost depleted too late, nearly falling into the water in a very embarrassing manner.</p><p>With Qin Sang's current cultivation, he couldn't activate the talisman for long before his true energy was exhausted. However, it was definitely sufficient for escaping in a critical moment.</p><p>With the talisman protecting him, Qin Sang's tense nerves relaxed somewhat, but he still dared not become careless.  If he encountered a late-stage Core Formation demon beast, even the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman might not guarantee his escape.</p><p>Of course, facing demon beasts below the late-stage Core Formation, as long as they weren't adept at escape techniques, Qin Sang could deal with them calmly. If he couldn't win, he’d treat it as training, and if the situation became unfavorable, he'd immediately activate the talisman and flee.</p><p>Those demon beasts, unable to catch up, could only watch Qin Sang's escaping figure and rage helplessly.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang had done exactly that when he encountered his first demon beast in the Fuhu Sea.</p><p>It was a mid-stage Core Formation Fuhu.</p><p>A Fuhu is a type of fish demon, similar to an eel, but with a parrot-like beak and eight legs, looking very strange.  It was a natural water-type demon beast, possessing powerful water-based abilities. Its eight legs, working in pairs, could use four different abilities, changing unpredictably and making it difficult to defend against.</p><p>Among the Fuhu's four most powerful abilities, water escape wasn't included.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang wouldn't have dared to provoke such a powerful demon beast. Now, naturally, he wouldn't miss such a good sparring opponent.</p><p>After discovering this Fuhu, Qin Sang became addicted, causing trouble for it every so often. After a fierce battle, he would activate the talisman and leave, returning to his cave dwelling to cultivate.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang had considered killing the demon beast, but later realized it was almost impossible.  The Fuhu's four abilities were not to be underestimated, and their combined power was immense.  Even if he was willing to risk the destruction of his Flying Heaven Night Fork, he still wasn't confident.</p><p>Hunting demons in the Demon Sea was not simply a comparison of strength.</p><p>During previous battles, once the fighting reached a stalemate and lasted too long, Qin Sang felt that the atmosphere in the surrounding waters was wrong. Other powerful demons must have been alerted by the fight and were secretly approaching.</p><p>In such situations, Qin Sang could only flee.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't completely abandon this idea. After several battles, he had become intimately familiar with the methods of the Fu Hu, and planned to return to Duoyan Island after some time, gather helpers, and hunt the beast.</p><p>Unexpectedly, while Qin Sang was dreaming of hunting the beast, he discovered that the Fu Hu, exasperated by his harassment, had abandoned its territory and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Qin Sang was unwilling to give up.  He searched several times, but the Fu Hu was nowhere to be found, having long since left its home.</p><p>This was just a minor setback. Qin Sang's training journey proceeded smoothly with the help of the elderly couple and their three children.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four years had passed in the Fu Hu Sea region.</p><p>Qin Sang, seizing opportunities and moving swiftly, became a menace in the Fu Hu Sea region.  Almost all the large demons that revealed their presence were harassed by him.</p><p>Although he spent most of his time cultivating, Qin Sang's Thousand-Jun Ring still held over a dozen demon cores, but they were all early-stage cores.</p><p>During this time, they also encountered several dangerous situations.</p><p>A man in gray clothes was discovered by a demonic bird, his arm was brutally bitten off, and he escaped by self-destructing his bone sword. The elderly couple once nearly fell prey to a demonic beast, but luckily Qin Sang arrived in time to save them.</p><p>Qin Sang himself was not exempt.</p><p>During a fierce battle with a mid-stage demon beast, he was sensed by a late-stage demon beast that happened to be passing by.</p><p>Terrified, Qin Sang immediately activated a talisman and fled for his life. The large demon, seeing Qin Sang's incredible speed and attracted by the demonic beast's blood, gave up the chase.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed from afar a thrilling battle between two large demons, and his opponent became the late-stage demon beast's meal.</p><p>After recovering from the shock, Qin Sang was even more determined to refine the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan as soon as possible.</p><p>One of the abilities of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan is its extreme sensitivity to demonic energy.  Within a certain range, it can actively warn of the approach of a large demon.</p><p>This is considered a divine artifact in the demon sea. With this treasure, Qin Sang could detect the presence of large demons in advance, prepare accordingly, and avoid repeating today's near-death experience.</p><p>Besides this, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan's greatest function is controlling demonic beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding the Yang ring, could use the Yin ring to control an early-stage demon beast.</p><p>Because of the treasure's limited grade, there would be significant limitations when using the controlled beast in battle, but it would be equivalent to having another ally whose strength is comparable to his own, in addition to the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p>
