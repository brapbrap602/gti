<h1>Chapter 943: Deliverance</h1><p>“Friend Cultivator, you have ample demonic banners.  Why not refine a few more here to weaken the demonic restrictions near the Deliverance Array…?” Bai suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed and proceeded to refine six more demonic banners in the underground cavern.</p><p>After a portion of the demonic fire was sealed within the seven banners, the form of the ground’s demonic restrictions drastically changed. The black net didn't collapse, but it noticeably thinned.</p><p>By this time, Bai had activated all eight spirit pillars on the altar.</p><p>Around the altar, light rain fell softly, acting as a counter to the demonic restrictions, preventing their restoration.</p><p>Bai quickly cast numerous incantations, leaped from the altar, and urgently said, “Friend Cultivator, come with me!”</p><p>Qin Sang put away his banners and quickly followed.</p><p>To deliver all the lost souls in the Ghostland, the power of this altar alone was insufficient.  Four auxiliary altars, one in each cardinal direction at the Ghostland's edge, formed the complete array with the central altar.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang and Bai would activate these altars one by one, weakening the demonic restrictions around them.</p><p>The two cultivators flew at full speed, locating the second altar.</p><p>Unlike the central altar, this one only had four spirit pillars.</p><p>The process remained smooth. After collecting the demonic fire, they immediately moved to the next.</p><p>After continuous work, they arrived at the final altar, the closest to the Ghostland's entrance.</p><p>The spirit pillars on the other altars were similarly cracked, but fortunately, none were destroyed, meaning the Deliverance Array should activate smoothly.</p><p>With practiced ease, they extracted the demonic fire, refining banners.</p><p>Finally, the last artifact was completed!</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the banner, about to examine his eighteen demonic banners, when he felt a tremor beneath his feet. He looked to Bai, who had just activated all the altar’s spirit pillars and appeared beside him in a flash.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed as he observed the altar.</p><p>The pillars erupted in bright light, Bai completely activating the altar's restrictions. The energy rippled through the Ghostland.</p><p>Simultaneously, something seemed to resonate with the altar's restrictions from other directions. The other four altars had already been activated. The Deliverance Array, dormant for countless years, finally opened.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai fled towards their pre-selected hiding place.</p><p>As they flew, the phenomenon caused by the Deliverance Array erupted, shaking the entire Ghostland.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, beams of light shot skyward from the center and four corners of the Ghostland. However, upon reaching a certain height, demonic restrictions appeared in the void, blocking the light columns.</p><p>The phenomenon wasn’t limited to the light columns.</p><p>Demonic restrictions appeared around the array altars and even the entire Ghostland, forming a seamless net that completely enveloped it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the five altars connected, a strange energy spreading through the Ghostland.  Within the grayish-white ghost mist, faint white light drifted.</p><p>Countless souls were awakened, floating from their skeletal remains. Those encountering the white light lost their frenzied expressions, replaced by serenity and unprecedented peace.</p><p>They were calmed, their violence gone.</p><p>After a moment, sensing a call, they drifted towards the five altars, seeking the source of their peace.</p><p>By then, Qin Sang and Bai had reached their hiding place.</p><p>Bai manipulated the ghost mist to form a barrier, while Qin Sang prepared the Crimson Yuan Shawl.</p><p>The shawl's power was dwindling. Usually, against cultivators of the same level, a small portion of its power sufficed for disguise. But to escape a Yuan Ying master's perception, he'd need its full might, causing irreversible damage with each use.  Qin Sang estimated it could withstand only two or three more uses at most.</p><p>He had treasured the shawl since obtaining it, only using it in crucial moments.</p><p>“It’s begun!” Bai softly exclaimed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down and saw the mountain of bones melting from within. Below the bones, the demonic restrictions grew increasingly violent.</p><p>Suddenly, the familiar black net incinerated the bone mountain, revealing its emptiness.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and leaped into the air, Bai following suit without delay.</p><p>Now, demonic restrictions appeared both above and below them. Even if not directly targeting them, Qin Sang felt a growing unease.</p><p>From their location, they could not see the altars, only anxiously awaiting the result.</p><p>The central altar of the Deliverance Array…</p><p>The subterranean chamber vanished, leaving behind a large crater.  The altar was exposed, surrounded by a massive, slowly rotating array of light, etched with countless arcane runes.</p><p>The spirit pillars groaned, their cracks widening, though they seemed to hold.</p><p>Under the array's assault, the already weakened magical barriers on the ground finally gave way, a breach forced open by the light.</p><p>The same scene unfolded at the other altars.</p><p>This triggered a chain reaction; the balance shifted, and the purification array could no longer be suppressed.</p><p>The purification array relentlessly pounded the magical barriers, strange phenomena appearing one after another. The entire ghost land began to shake violently.</p><p>Outside the canyon, Mou Laomo had set up a spirit array, waiting patiently.</p><p>Suddenly, the canyon trembled.  The tremors originated deep within the ghost land, and the ball of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire reacted, wildly fluctuating.</p><p>Mou Laomo was startled, rising abruptly, his gaze fixed on the ghost land, his expression shifting.</p><p>"Did someone trigger some kind of restriction?"</p><p>Mou Laomo was filled with suspicion and uncertainty.</p><p>But the entrance was blocked by demon fire, and the area was shrouded in ghost mist, obscuring everything.</p><p>Inside the ghost land, the magical barriers shattered, the destruction eventually reaching Qin Sang and Bai.</p><p>The two exchanged a look, understanding the impending change.</p><p>Bai formed hand seals, condensing a thick fog of ghost mist around them. Qin Sang pointed at a red ribbon, causing the artifact within to glow red and transform into a red veil, enveloping them and masking their presence.</p><p>Their actions were barely completed when the earth shook violently.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the spirit pillars at all the altars exploded, the altars collapsing with them. A brilliant white light erupted, the light beams many times more intense than before, their terrifying force slamming into the magical barriers.</p><p>The barriers, already on the verge of collapse, were finally breached.</p><p>The light beams met no resistance, shooting straight into the heavens!</p><p>Countless lost souls ascended with the light beams, escaping the prison that had held them for countless years. The souls, having lost their minds, wore expressions of bewilderment.</p><p>The light beams didn't travel far. After breaking free of the barriers, they suddenly dispersed, emitting a faint sound of chanting.</p><p>The souls listened to the scriptures, bathed in the white light and runes, peacefully fading away like snow melting, disappearing from the mortal realm.</p><p>No one knows where they ultimately went, or if they truly returned to the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>Meanwhile, the magical barriers surrounding the ghost land crumbled, powerful aftershocks sweeping across the land. Bai had tampered with the activation of the array, and the canyon entrance was the first to be affected.</p>
