<h1>Chapter 1741: The Young Spirit</h1><p>The girl's voice was already shrill, and her scream could pierce eardrums. If it weren't for the protective barriers within the cabin isolating the inside from the outside, her cries would have been heard by others, leading them to suspect Qin Sang of having some peculiar habits.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly gazed at the Sun God Tree, suddenly sensing something amiss. The cries seemed to gradually take on a weeping tone, with distinct sobbing sounds. He glanced at the Kirin Origin Seed in his hand, then back at the Sun God Tree, his expression turning strange. For a moment, he was at a loss for words, unsure of what to say.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit was heartbroken. It had never imagined that Qin Sang had not refined the Kirin Origin Seed into his body. Yet, the Vermilion Bird Spirit couldn't comprehend how Qin Sang had managed to cultivate the "Seed of Golden Lotus" to such a high level without the Kirin Origin Seed.</p><p>This Kirin had set a trap using secret techniques, harming others without their knowledge, and was certainly no benevolent being. The Kirin had passed down the "Seed of Golden Lotus" with the intention of reviving the Origin Seed. It must have left hidden mechanisms within the technique to guide cultivators into refining the Kirin Origin Seed. Otherwise, all its efforts would have been in vain, benefiting others for nothing.</p><p>From this, it could be inferred that without the Kirin Origin Seed, even if a cultivator could begin the practice, they would inevitably encounter numerous obstacles at certain stages. Worse still, they might be led astray, facing the dangers of self-immolation or bodily explosion.</p><p>Thus, although the Kirin aura within the Fire Lotus Qin Sang had cultivated was extremely faint, the Vermilion Bird Spirit had never doubted it, assuming that the Origin Seed had been dormant for too long, its spirit dimmed.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit was filled with regret. According to its original plan, it should have waited a bit longer until the Kirin Origin Seed had taken deeper root and the crisis was imminent, making it easier to manipulate Qin Sang. By then, if the aura of the Fire Lotus still hadn't changed, it would have surely noticed the anomaly and remained vigilant.</p><p>But then, a Phoenix True Feather had appeared midway, offering great benefits. Unable to resist the temptation, it had revealed itself prematurely. Now that Qin Sang was not at risk of being possessed, how could it force him to submit and serve it obediently?</p><p>To make matters worse, it had been tricked into revealing the method to extract the essence of the Origin Seed. The more the Vermilion Bird Spirit thought about it, the more heartbroken it became, weeping and wailing until it was unclear which divine bird the cries were coming from.</p><p>"Have you cried enough?" Qin Sang listened for a while before speaking softly.</p><p>"No... uh..." The Vermilion Bird Spirit seemed to feel ashamed, its anger turning into a petulant accusation, "You tricked me into revealing the secret technique!"</p><p>"If you hadn't harbored ill intentions and had warned me earlier about the dangers hidden within the technique, helping me navigate the risks, I would have been grateful and respectful towards you. Whatever requests you had, I would have agreed to them. Why would it have come to this?" Qin Sang snorted coldly, his gaze on the Sun God Tree turning hostile.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang played with the Kirin Origin Seed in his hand, glancing at the nine divine birds, and asked indifferently, "Do you still want the Kirin's essence?"</p><p>"Of course... What are you planning?" The Vermilion Bird Spirit responded warily, but a hint of hope was evident in its tone.</p><p>Sensing its thoughts, Qin Sang smiled faintly. His question had been carefully considered. According to the Vermilion Bird Spirit, it had a way to tame the Phoenix True Fire within the Phoenix True Feather. If it tamed the fire first, it would be easier for Qin Sang to refine it, greatly benefiting his cultivation of the "Seed of Golden Lotus."</p><p>Although this technique was related to the Kirin, Qin Sang could cultivate it without the Kirin Origin Seed. He felt that the technique had immense potential and, for now, sensed no hidden dangers. He had no intention of abandoning it.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang was also very interested in the Kirin Origin Seed. If he could fully extract the essence within the seed and use it for himself, his soul power would greatly increase, and his strength would rise accordingly. This would give him more confidence when entering the Abyss in the future.</p><p>At his current level, it was difficult to achieve significant progress in this realm. When the path to ascension was clear, a Spirit Transformation cultivator without the burden of sect juniors could simply meditate for a while before heading east.</p><p>The Kirin Origin Seed was undoubtedly an opportunity. But seizing this opportunity would not be easy; it certainly wasn't as simple as the Vermilion Bird Spirit had made it out to be.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to extract the essence from the Kirin Origin Seed without triggering any unforeseen events that might awaken the seed within his body, even though he wasn't afraid of possession. Relying solely on this secret technique, he wasn't entirely confident. To be safe, he might need the Vermilion Bird Spirit's assistance at critical moments.</p><p>Through several rounds of probing, the Vermilion Bird Spirit, in its arrogance, had revealed much. Qin Sang could see that while the Vermilion Bird Spirit wasn't entirely pure-hearted, it wasn't a malevolent being eitherâ€”just somewhat naive.</p><p>If it were someone else, controlling his life, they would have demanded everything without question. The Vermilion Bird Spirit, however, allowed him to negotiate and offered generous terms.</p><p>Still, this was only his judgment based on their brief interaction. He needed to learn more about its background.</p><p>"Have you forgotten the oath I just made?" Qin Sang held the Kirin Origin Seed between his fingers, smiling, "Whether I've been possessed or not doesn't affect the oath's validity. I alone cannot confidently seek the Kirin's essence, nor do I want others to know my secrets. Cooperating with you is a viable option. Unfortunately, I am human, and I don't know if I can refine the Kirin's essence. If the Kirin's essence is incompatible with me, who else could it belong to?"</p><p>The eyes of the nine divine birds suddenly brightened, their fiery gazes gleaming with hope, "Is that true?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit wasn't entirely foolish. It knew there were no free benefits in the world and hesitated, "What do you want me to do?"</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fingers around the Kirin Origin Seed and said solemnly, "I wish to extract the essence from the Kirin Origin Seed and refine the Phoenix True Fire. I fear I may not be able to do it alone and hope you can lend your full assistance."</p><p>Hearing this, the Vermilion Bird Spirit wished it could burn Qin Sang to ashes with its Southern Bright Flames. Qin Sang was even more demanding, asking it to work for free, yet it had no way to deal with him.</p><p>Qin Sang also understood the principle of not sending hungry soldiers into battle. He couldn't keep dangling the promise of the Kirin's essence forever. He added, "The Kirin Origin Seed and the Phoenix True Feather are mine to begin with. In recognition of your help in uncovering the secrets of these treasures, as long as you assist me honestly, I can share a portion with you."</p><p>This was similar to the two conditions it had proposed earlier but was more acceptable than before. Thinking of its earlier arrogance, the Vermilion Bird Spirit felt both ashamed and annoyed.</p><p>Before it could agree, Qin Sang's tone suddenly turned cold, "I can overlook your attempts to coerce me. These conditions are no harsher than what you proposed earlier. But the premise is that you must earn my trust. Otherwise, I will definitely find a way to eliminate any threats around me! Tell me about your origins..."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit remained silent for a long time before finally speaking, revealing its background.</p><p>Listening to its story, it would be more accurate to call it the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit rather than the Vermilion Bird Spirit.</p><p>It turned out that when Qin Sang had obtained the Vermilion Bird True Feather, the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit had not yet been born. It had gradually regained its consciousness within the Sun God Tree by his side.</p><p>The exact time was unclear. According to the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit, it felt as though it had been aware of its surroundings for a long time, but it had been in a daze, unable to comprehend the meaning of what it perceived, unaware of the passage of time.</p><p>At some point, it suddenly realized that it seemed to have regained its consciousness. Looking back, its memories were hazy and chaotic, like a dream.</p><p>The Young Vermilion Bird Spirit suspected that its spirit had never been lost but had been scattered, only now awakening.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the place where he had obtained the Vermilion Bird True Feather, which resembled a fire chamber for alchemy. He suspected that the chamber's master had imprisoned the Vermilion Bird Spirit there, forcing it to continuously supply Southern Bright Flames.</p><p>The fire chamber had protective barriers that could seal the Southern Bright Flames, and a fragment of green bronze could suppress the Vermilion Bird True Feather. The Young Vermilion Bird Spirit had remained in a daze there for so many years, only regaining consciousness after being taken away from the Purple Palace. This must have been related to the barriers in the fire chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang urged the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit to recall its past, but after being worn down by endless years, it only had a vague memory of being grabbed by the back of its neck by a hand and thrown somewhere, after which it had been in a daze.</p><p>It could no longer remember the appearance of that hand, but it was deeply etched with a certain aura, which it believed belonged to its great enemy.</p><p>"I, the Vermilion Bird, will surely avenge this!" the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit said angrily, its tone tinged with a hint of grievance.</p><p>It knew its enemy must be incredibly powerful. Its fourth condition had been to ask Qin Sang to help it seek revenge, but it feared scaring him off and had kept it as a hidden clause.</p><p>Now that both the Kirin Origin Seed and the Phoenix True Feather were lost, seeking revenge would have to wait for who knew how long.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang almost laughed in frustration. No wonder it seemed so inexperienced, revealing its secrets with just a few words. He had even called it "senior" a few times, nearly being taken advantage of by a young spirit.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the Jade Buddha; otherwise, this situation would have been difficult to resolve, and he would have had to serve the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit obediently, becoming little more than a pet.</p><p>However, although the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit was still immature in mind, some of its instincts remained. When it encountered the Kirin Origin Seed and the Phoenix True Feather, it instinctively knew they were beneficial, as if it naturally understood how to control them. This was why the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit believed it was awakening rather than being newly born.</p><p>To the naked eye, the Vermilion Bird True Feather appeared intact, with each filament clear and smooth.</p><p>In reality, this was not the case.</p><p>Perhaps due to being sealed for too long, continuously drained of Southern Bright Flames, and constantly assaulted by the fire chamber's barriers, the Vermilion Bird True Feather had been invisibly damaged, its appearance altered, and the nature of the Southern Bright Flames changed, no longer resembling true Vermilion Bird Flames.</p><p>The newly awakened Young Vermilion Bird Spirit found that it could no longer control its own wildly raging flames and could only carefully comb through and repair them, waiting for the True Feather to recover. Staying within the Sun God Tree was easier; it couldn't even manifest flames outside, only using the Sun God Birds to speak.</p><p>Because of this, controlling the Sun God Birds wasn't easy for it either, leaving it powerless against Qin Sang.</p><p>For the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit to fully recover, the Vermilion Bird True Feather was crucial, but the rate of natural recovery was too slow.</p><p>It absorbed the essence of the Kirin Origin Seed to strengthen its spirit and refined the Phoenix True Fire to restore the Vermilion Bird True Featherâ€”both were indispensable.</p><p>Unfortunately, these treasures all belonged to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Young Vermilion Bird Spirit stammered, "If you give me more, I can recover faster and help you sooner."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "Don't aim too high just yet. Do you know that ascending from this realm is not easy, and that the Heavenly Dao has changed?"</p><p>"What Heavenly Dao?" The Young Vermilion Bird Spirit was confused.</p><p>Seeing that it didn't seem to be pretending, Qin Sang explained the changes in the realm to it, observing its reaction.</p><p>"This... this... when will I ever get my revenge?" The nine divine birds were stunned, exclaiming several times but unable to articulate anything coherent, though they didn't forget about revenge.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but feel disappointed, "If you want revenge, you must help me improve my strength. Only by ascending to the upper realm can you have a chance to grow stronger."</p><p>Now there was another reason to subdue the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit.</p><p>Although the Young Vermilion Bird Spirit couldn't control the Vermilion Bird True Feather, with its full assistance, Qin Sang would find it much easier to control the Sun God Birds.</p><p>If they cooperated well, they might even attempt to mobilize all nine divine birds!</p><p>The facts proved that the power of the Sun God Birds wasn't simply additive. If all nine divine birds were unleashed, even if they couldn't sweep through the Abyss, they would be nearly invincible.</p><p>This return to familiar grounds had truly been fruitful!</p><p>Not only had he obtained the Taiyi Star Chariot, but he had also gained this powerful ally. Once he fully digested these gains, even if he couldn't find the Ascension Platform, he would have the strength to venture into the Abyss.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird Spirit, now reliant on Qin Sang, was already inclined to cooperate. The current state of the realm hastened its decision.</p><p>The two sides quickly reached an agreement.</p><p>"Do you remember your name from before?" Qin Sang's expression softened, his tone gentle. Seeing the fiery red Sun God Bird shake its head, he teased, "From now on, you'll be called Little Red."</p><p>The nine Sun God Birds all raised their necks in unison.</p><p>"I am the mighty Vermilion Bird!"</p><p>In the end, Qin Sang agreed to "respectfully" call it "Vermilion Bird," and only then did it relent.</p><p>Their back-and-forth didn't take long.</p><p>Outside the ship, the sea was calm. The Dragon King's guards stood on the water's surface, not daring to move, keeping watch over the ship. However, they all looked tense, their auras greatly diminished.</p><p>By now, the Dragon King must have been in contact with the various clans of the demon sea.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, there's no need to stand here idly. You may leave," Qin Sang transmitted his voice. The various clans would surely discuss matters, and the Phoenix Clan couldn't be left out.</p><p>The Phoenix King hadn't expected Qin Sang to let her go so easily. She looked at his avatar with suspicion, then cautiously flew out of the ship. Seeing no obstruction, she quickly dove into the sea, heading for the Dragon Clan's ancestral land.</p><p>It would take some time for them to finish their discussions.</p><p>Inside the cabin, Qin Sang temporarily put away the Phoenix True Feather and placed the Sun God Tree in front of him. Holding the transparent lotus seed in his palm, he asked, "How long will it take to extract the essence from the Kirin Origin Seed?"</p><p>"It's hard to say," the nine Sun God Birds shook their heads. "If you don't let me intervene, I can't judge. However, I must remind you that if you extract the essence from the Kirin Origin Seed yourself, you'll need to constantly suppress the Kirin's spirit with your divine sense to prevent it from awakening. During this time, if you engage in combat, your divine sense will be limited, and you won't be able to fight at full strength."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. He had already prepared himself for this, but it didn't matter. In this realm, only fierce beasts posed a threat to him, and he had plenty of other means at his disposal.</p><p>The so-called limitation didn't mean he couldn't use his divine sense at all; it was just that his perception would be slightly weaker than before, making it harder to use divine sense techniques and causing the Fire Lotus to move more sluggishly.</p><p>His physical body, poison beads, escape techniques, treasures, and sword formations were all still usable, though they might consume more true essence, which was within acceptable limits.</p><p>He had now changed his plan, deciding to return to Central Continent first to arrange for the repair of the Taiyi Star Chariot before heading to the North Sea.</p><p>The journey was long, and repairing the Taiyi Star Chariot wouldn't be completed quickly. These tasks wouldn't interfere with refining the Kirin Origin Seed.</p><p>As long as it didn't take an excessively long time, he could wait. If it took too long, he could always share more with the Vermilion Bird.</p><p>He was very much looking forward to seeing how much his strength would improve after fully absorbing the essence of the Kirin Origin Seed. Tentatively, he extended his divine sense, enveloping the Kirin Origin Seed.</p><p></p>
