<h1>Chapter 667: The Interview</h1><p>So it was!</p><p>The chief steward of the Qiongyu Trading Company was incredibly powerful, possibly a mid- or even late-stage Core Formation cultivator.  I wonder if such a company could even command a Nascent Soul master.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ran Luo chatted for a while before Qin Sang broached the purpose of his visit.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Ran Luo said, “Fellow cultivators of our human race helping each other in a foreign land is only right. Several fellow Daoists have already agreed to travel together. Daoist Qingfeng, please rest assured. However, I have a few questions I hope Daoist Qingfeng is willing to answer.”</p><p>“Please, Daoist,” Qin Sang replied, sitting upright.</p><p>Ran Luo nodded. “I would like to ask, Daoist, is this your first time going to the Stormy Demon Sea? What are your plans once you arrive at the Stormy Demon Sea? Do you intend to hunt demons alone, or have you already contacted other fellow Daoists to form a group?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and said gravely, “These are private matters.  Are they relevant to your company?”</p><p>He wasn't willing to reveal his background to strangers.</p><p>Ran Luo waved her hand. “Daoist, please don’t misunderstand. It’s alright if you don’t answer. I ask because I’m afraid that as a first-time visitor to the Stormy Demon Sea, you might not understand the dangers there. Even with your cultivation, it’s generally not advisable to act alone in the Stormy Demon Sea. Most cultivators choose to join a force or find several fellow Daoists to form a team. If you haven’t yet contacted other forces, perhaps you might consider our Qiongyu Trading Company.”</p><p>Ran Luo looked at Qin Sang calmly, extending her invitation.</p><p>Upon learning that every Core Formation cultivator who came to the Qiongyu Trading Company received such an invitation, Qin Sang didn’t rush to refuse, instead carefully considering the feasibility.</p><p>“Outer Sea Retainer?”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured softly.</p><p>This title was the position Ran Luo had just offered him.</p><p>“That’s right,” Ran Luo explained proactively, seeing Qin Sang's confusion.</p><p>“Those of us who frequently enter and exit the Stormy Demon Sea call it the Outer Sea, and we call the Canglang Sea the Inner Sea. This division exists not only for the sea areas but also for many forces.</p><p>“The most common are trading companies like ours. Unlike sects, we don't have sectarian prejudices. To maintain our influence in the Outer Sea, we recruit high-cultivation cultivators like yourself to be Outer Sea Retainers.</p><p>“Most of these Outer Sea Retainers are disciples of top sects in the mainland, and this doesn’t affect their joining our company.</p><p>“Matters in the Outer Sea are unrelated to the Inner Sea.</p><p>“Once you enter the Inner Sea, if you still wish to remain a retainer, we would be delighted. If not, we won't force you; we would be like strangers in the Inner Sea, and it won't affect your existing relationships.</p><p>“Becoming an Outer Sea Retainer for our company has countless benefits…”</p><p>Ran Luo spoke eloquently, doing her best to alleviate Qin Sang's concerns, tempting him with various benefits.</p><p>Some of these benefits made Qin Sang's heart beat faster.</p><p>He wasn't a cultivator of the Canglang Sea, and he had no ties to any sect; joining the Qiongyu Trading Company wouldn’t be a problem. However, Qin Sang was well aware that these benefits wouldn’t come for free.</p><p>“What responsibilities would I need to shoulder as a retainer of your company?”</p><p>Ran Luo chuckled lightly. “If the company encounters a crisis, naturally, Daoist, you would need to work with us to overcome it. In ordinary times, the company will not overly restrict you; instead, we will help you connect with other fellow Daoists to hunt demons together…”</p><p>As expected.</p><p>There are always trade-offs.</p><p>It sounds nice to call it a retainer, but it's basically being a hired hand.</p><p>The Stormy Demon Sea is not always stable; crises can arise at any time.</p><p>He’s a lone wolf, and if he encounters danger, he'll run if he can. By becoming an Outer Sea Retainer, he'll have an extra shackle, losing his freedom to come and go as he pleases.</p><p>It's impossible to take the benefits without doing the work; desertion would likely lead to being hunted not just by the Qiongyu Trading Company, but the entire Dongji Alliance, making both the Inner and Outer Seas impassable.</p><p>However, having the backing of a large force does have many advantages.</p><p>Ran Luo was right; in the Stormy Demon Sea, going it alone wouldn't work.</p><p>Qin Sang had long been aware of the difficulties faced by independent cultivators.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang suddenly had an idea and asked, “Does your company only recruit such retainers? If there are fellow Daoists skilled in refining weapons or pills, would they be eligible to join?”</p><p>The responsibilities of a weapon refiner would be different from those of a hired hand.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang intended to continue his research in weapon refining, and joining a force under the guise of a weapon refiner would be ideal.</p><p>Ran Luo’s eyes lit up. “If there were fellow Daoists skilled in weapon or pill refinement, any trading company would be overjoyed; how could we refuse them? Daoist…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. “This cultivator has some experience in weapon refinement.”</p><p>Ran Luo was overjoyed.  “What magic treasures has Daoist refined?”</p><p>This feels like a job interview?</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself with some embarrassment, saying awkwardly, “This cultivator has only refined his own magic treasure, and is still in the process of comprehension. However…”</p><p>Because of the cooperation with his cultivation method, the refinement of his magic treasure only required following the method's instructions step by step, making it relatively easy; other magic treasures are different.</p><p>The materials needed for crafting magical artifacts are incredibly rare.</p><p>Qin Sang only possesses the oral teachings of a single instrument maker from the Xu Ling Sect, barely scratching the surface of true mastery.  He hasn't fully integrated this knowledge and thus dares not attempt artifact refinement rashly.</p><p>However, a complete Yin Ring remains for the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan, greatly reducing the difficulty of its creation.</p><p>Once he refines the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Huan, his skill in instrument making will undoubtedly skyrocket.</p><p>Noticing the disappointment in Ran Luo's eyes, Qin Sang changed his tone, confidently stating, "However, I am exceptionally proficient in refining magical instruments, especially high-quality ones. With the same materials, my success rate is higher, and the resulting instruments are more powerful."</p><p>Qin Sang's confidence stems from the Nine Netherworld Inferno.</p><p>During the creation of the Shi Yuan Cone in the Black-Winged Eagle's lair, he verified that the Nine Netherworld Inferno provides significant assistance in instrument refinement.</p><p>With his current cultivation and the aid of the Nine Netherworld Inferno, he can significantly increase the success rate and power of the instruments, making the creation of high-quality instruments a simple matter.</p><p>High-quality instruments are not as valuable as artifacts, but they are in the highest demand in the cultivation world. The Qiong Yu Trading Company doesn't only do business with Foundation Establishment cultivators, so Qin Sang doubts they wouldn't be interested.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's confident words, Ran Luo showed considerable interest.  "Some of the demonic corpses acquired from the Outer Seas are insufficient for refining artifacts and elixirs, so they are often refined into instruments on-site. Our company is eager for talent. If Daoist Qin truly possesses unique instrument-refining techniques and is willing to join our company, feel free to name your conditions; we will certainly satisfy you."</p><p>Qin Sang heard the implication and, after looking around, pondered before saying, "I still have some matters to attend to.  Since we are travelling together to the Storm Demon Sea, let's wait until we are there, where there will be plenty of demonic corpses. I will personally demonstrate my instrument-refining skills then. We can discuss the details afterward."</p><p>The Qiong Yu Trading Company is assessing him.</p><p>He, in turn, is assessing the Qiong Yu Trading Company.</p><p>Qin Sang is unfamiliar with the Storm Demon Sea and doesn't want to commit so quickly. He will decide which faction to join after arriving at the Storm Demon Sea.</p>
