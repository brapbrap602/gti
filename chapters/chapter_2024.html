<h1>Chapter 2015: Shattered World</h1><p>Gu Ya sensed an approaching presence, stepping back behind Qin Sang to watch.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>Five figures streaked through the wind and sand.  Fresh from a battle, blood stained their hands, and an aura of slaughter hung heavy in the air.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The leading figure abruptly halted, a chilling male voice echoing.</p><p>The four figures behind him immediately stopped as well.</p><p>The newcomers consisted of four men and one woman. The men wore similar black robes, but the woman was draped in purple, her figure alluringly revealed. Her beauty was striking, and a scar across her nose, perhaps deliberate, added a touch of wildness rather than detracting from her attractiveness.</p><p>Their positioning revealed the dynamics within the group.  The one who had spoken was a slender young man among the four males. A short, stout cultivator clung close to him. The other two men, an old man and a young boy, stood together, appearing to be grandfather and grandson. The woman stood apart but remained closer to the young man’s faction.</p><p>“Yuan discovered something?” the elder of the grandfather-grandson pair asked.</p><p>The young man spoke with suspicion, “The two Qian brothers haven’t moved. Don’t you find that strange?”</p><p>This group wasn't from the same faction. To prevent treachery, they had agreed to mutual restraints during their alliance, including a shared secret technique allowing each to sense the others' locations.</p><p>“Yuan means…?”</p><p>The elder frowned, gazing ahead.</p><p>The young man glanced at the others, “When we hunted down the descendants of Old Master Chen, the two Qian brothers claimed to have spotted a treasure and chased after it.  But there’s no sign of a fight ahead. If they succeeded, why haven’t they returned? What treasure could make them abandon the Chen family’s heirloom blood seal? If they didn’t succeed…”</p><p>“They’ve been captured!” the elder said gravely.</p><p>“Who could capture the two Qian brothers?”</p><p>The stout man looked astonished. “After they left, we dealt with the remaining descendants of Old Master Chen with almost no trouble. In such a short time, even if the two Qian brothers were overpowered, they shouldn’t have been captured…”</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Everyone looked at the young man’s right hand. He had just crushed a communication talisman, specially crafted for this operation, but there was no response.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The young man didn’t hesitate, turning to leave.</p><p>Before the elder could speak, the boy furrowed his delicate brows, hesitating.  “That’s not right. The two Qian brothers have been diligent and made significant contributions. We swore oaths of mutual assistance and loyalty.  Without knowing what happened, abandoning them is wrong…”</p><p>“Wrong?”</p><p>The young man snorted disdainfully.</p><p>“Think about where we are. Countless powerful cultivators pass through Fengju Jade Gate! Don’t think that proximity to the Great Zhou Dynasty will deter them; here, they are even more reckless than in the Darklands. If the two Qian brothers provoked a powerful figure, are we all going to be buried with them? Besides, our alliance oaths had conditions—they applied only when facing Chen family remnants. The Qian brothers were blinded by greed, leaving on their own. Fortunately, the remaining Chen descendants were weak. Otherwise, their actions would have jeopardized the operation. Ultimately, it was their own fault!”</p><p>The young man was unapologetically harsh, his tone bordering on rebuke. The boy’s face flushed.</p><p>As the young man spoke, he activated his escape technique. The stout man followed suit. The grandfather and grandson looked at the woman in purple.  Seeing that she was also preparing to leave, they said nothing more.</p><p>As the five were about to flee, a light chuckle reached their ears.</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>The laughter was ethereal yet clear, seemingly omnipresent, impossible to pinpoint.</p><p>“You’re cleverer than I expected.  So be it. I won't make things difficult for you. Leave the Chen family’s heirloom blood seal, and you may go.”</p><p>The calm voice caused their faces to change instantly, every hair on their bodies standing on end.</p><p>‘Swish swish!’</p><p>The five quickly formed a battle formation, with the young man at its core, their faces filled with apprehension.</p><p>“Who are you, esteemed cultivator? Please reveal yourself.  We only temporarily cooperated with the two Qian brothers; we weren’t comrades.”</p><p>“If the two Qian brothers offended you, it’s not our concern, and we won't interfere.  You can deal with them as you see fit,” the effeminate young man called out to the void.</p><p>However, the other party completely ignored his words, continuing to speak in a calm, unhurried tone.</p><p>“My patience is limited.  I give you three breaths.”</p><p>In an instant, everyone could almost hear their own breathing. Three breaths passed in a flash.</p><p>The heirloom seal was held by the effeminate young man; he bore the most pressure.  Everyone else was watching him.</p><p>It was a difficult decision.</p><p>If the other party was bluffing, they would be ridiculed by the entire world if they were intimidated into handing over the treasure. But what if the other party was truly a powerful cultivator…</p><p>“This heirloom seal, I no longer want it.  You three can dispose of it as you see fit!”</p><p>The effeminate young man took out a square seal and lightly tossed it upwards.</p><p>The short, stout man looked reluctant, his lips moving as if he wanted to say something. But the effeminate young man glared at him sharply, silencing him instantly.  He quickly fled with the effeminate young man.</p><p>The remaining three looked at the heirloom seal, exchanging glances.</p><p>The effeminate young man was the strongest among them, and he had organized the alliance. During the pursuit of the descendant of Old Devil Chen, his keen judgment and extraordinary strategies had earned him everyone's respect.  No one expected him to abandon the heirloom seal, which they had obtained with so much effort, without even seeing the enemy's face.</p><p>A flicker of hesitation crossed the purple-robed woman’s eyes, but in the end, she resolutely turned away and fled as a purple light.</p><p>The old man sighed softly, pulling the reluctant youth along as they chased after her.</p><p>After they left, the seal abruptly stopped its descent and shot itself towards the depths of the sandstorm.</p><p>The short, stout man, far away, was still dissatisfied. Seeing that there were truly no pursuers behind him, he repeatedly looked back.  “Big Brother, we just gave away the Chen family’s heirloom seal? You felt the fluctuation in the seal too. Legend says that Old Devil Chen’s medicinal field is probably here. Inside, there are countless spirit herbs, and it might even be Old Devil Chen’s treasure vault—right at our fingertips!”</p><p>“Are spirit herbs more important than your life?”</p><p>The effeminate young man glanced behind him. The purple-robed woman and the elderly couple had already caught up.</p><p>“The Chen family has no heirs, and we know all about Old Devil Chen’s secrets. After we return, Old Devil Chen's Daoist grounds will be ours, enough for us to live comfortably for a while. Let's just pretend we never got the heirloom seal,” the effeminate young man said. These words were not only for the stout cultivator but also a reminder to the other three.</p><p>Hearing this, the three of them looked considerably more relieved.</p><p>As the five figures disappeared into the distance, the heirloom seal fell into Qin Sang’s hands.</p><p>“Quite the character.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction where the five had gone, lost in thought.</p><p>If these five had come to him, he wouldn’t have minded keeping them there, dealing with them all at once.</p><p>Since entering the Greater World, Qin Sang had clearly felt that cultivation in the Greater World was much easier than in the Lesser World.  He didn't need to desperately fight for limited cultivation resources like in the Lesser World, where stagnation meant regression, and every inch had to be fought for.</p><p>In the middle of the Eight Great Heavenly States, there were even uncharted wildernesses, not to mention the vast world beyond.</p><p>The stable situation in the Great Zhou Dynasty and the smooth exchanges between the Eight Great Heavenly States meant that many necessary cultivation resources could be obtained through trade. They didn't need to painstakingly search everywhere. Cultivators often spent years in seclusion. With sufficient talent, they could steadily cultivate and achieve a high level of cultivation.</p><p>Those who often walked the edge of life and death, struggling all the way, have a unique aura. The effeminate young man was one such example, as were Qu Zhen and others from the Hengsha Society.  Since arriving in the Great Zhou, Qin Sang had mostly been in orderly immortal cities, and he had rarely encountered cultivators like them.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the seal and examined it.</p><p>These people came to seize the heirloom seal, and the Chen family descendant didn't go anywhere else but to the more dangerous Fengju Jade Gate—it certainly wasn't just a pretense.</p><p>When his divine sense touched the heirloom seal, Qin Sang indeed sensed something unusual.  Inside the seal, there was a thread of blood as thin as a hair, refined using special methods.</p><p>Touching the thread, an extremely faint fluctuation emanated, and Qin Sang seemed to have a vague sensation.</p><p>It might have been too far away to determine the source of the sensation, but Qin Sang could judge that the target was in the direction of Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have high expectations for treasures, but Old Devil Chen specifically refined an heirloom seal, presumably pointing to a hidden place, which could serve as a temporary refuge for Gu Ya to rest and recover.</p><p>Gu Ya was caught off guard during the encounter and suffered significant injuries, otherwise, she wouldn't have been entangled by those two.</p><p>“Senior Qin, what should we do with them?”</p><p>Gu Ya pointed at the two on the ground.</p><p>“Let’s not kill them yet, take them with us,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Exploring the Feng Ju Jade Gate always involves dangerous areas; we are short of scouts.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang easily repel the attackers, Gu Ya’s respect for him deepened. She obeyed him implicitly, flicking out a silken sash to securely bind the two.</p><p>The two, bound by Qin Sang, were completely helpless.  After the departure of the effeminate youth and his companions, they fell into utter despair, their faces ashen.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his seal, looked towards the direction of Luan Che, and transmitted his voice: “Daoist friend Xin, I have urgent business and must go ahead.  We’ll meet at the agreed location later. Qu Zhen, you accompany Daoist friend Xin. As for what you mentioned, I will consider it after we reach the Feng Ju Jade Gate.”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>“Please proceed, Elder Qin.”</p><p>Qu Zhen and Young Master Xin responded via voice transmission.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Qin Sang took Gu Ya and, using his escape technique, flew directly towards the Feng Ju Jade Gate. The closer they got, the clearer the family heirloom’s resonance became.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Rumble! Rumble!’</p><p>Deafening roars echoed continuously.</p><p>Gu Ya gazed into the distance, her eyes filled with awe.  At the edge of the earth, a gray haze filled the horizon. There was no sky, no ground; space seemed torn and pulverized, only an endless gray storm.</p><p>Visible violent currents roared past, like a giant millstone in the heavens, possessing the terrifying power to crush everything.</p><p>Chaos!</p><p>Danger!</p><p>This was Gu Ya’s immediate impression of the Feng Ju Jade Gate.  She silently acknowledged that it was indeed an ancient battlefield.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lead her directly towards the storm, Gu Ya couldn't help but ask, “Senior Qin, are we going in through here?”</p><p>Even at the edge of the Feng Ju Jade Gate, Gu Ya felt deeply uneasy.</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in response. The storm was strong, but not beyond his capabilities.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Gu Ya’s vision went black as she plunged into the storm.  She felt like she passed through a strange barrier, then the surroundings fell silent. It wasn’t truly calm inside, but Qin Sang had created a protective barrier around her.</p><p>Focusing her eyesight, she saw a gray land stretching out beneath her feet.  Naturally, there were no living creatures, just a desolate wasteland.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, his expression shifting slightly as if he sensed something. He suddenly looked up at the sky. The storm above was even more terrifying, a dense gray sky forming a huge vortex.</p><p>To Gu Ya’s astonishment, Qin Sang then flew towards the strongest part of the storm.</p><p>The barrier firmly protected Gu Ya.</p><p>When they passed through the storm vortex, they saw an incredible sight: above the storm was not the sky, but another landmass. This landmass was inverted, its peaks pointing downwards, pressed against another landmass, yet it didn’t actually fall.</p><p>“How…?”</p><p>While passing through the storm, Gu Ya felt an unusual chaos, realizing it was far more than just inverted land.</p><p>“Two small thousand worlds! Shattered small thousand worlds!” Qin Sang softly said.</p><p>These were clearly the remnants of two small thousand worlds, crushed together, their boundaries shattered, creating an unceasing storm.</p><p>Having witnessed such a shocking sight upon entering the Feng Ju Jade Gate, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the Ju Shan Zhi Zhi Altar in the Fu Yao Realm.  He had not reached the deepest part of the altar, wondering if it also contained shattered small thousand worlds. Perhaps fragments of small thousand worlds existed within those divine illusions, but his vision wasn't keen enough.</p><p>The ancient war had even shattered small thousand worlds.  Even though Qin Sang was a Refining Void cultivator, he couldn’t imagine the terrifying power of Mahayana cultivators.</p><p>Aside from that, the area was barren and offered little to see.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Ya traversed between the two landmasses, continuing to fly forward. The scenery remained monotonous until they reached the end of the upper landmass.</p><p>Like a clean cut, a neat break appeared at the land's end, beyond which lay endless darkness.  Qin Sang flickered and flew across the break, but instead of entering the darkness, he appeared in another space.</p><p>This place was still desolate and chaotic, but better than the outside. This was where the small thousand world truly began. The outer continent was merely a fragment revealed after the small thousand world shattered.</p><p>This small thousand world was nearly destroyed, riddled with holes, and no longer had any so-called "marker gates". After a swift flight, Qin Sang passed through a crack and left this small thousand world.</p><p>Being carried through this place by Qin Sang, Gu Ya felt a sense of spacetime distortion.</p>
