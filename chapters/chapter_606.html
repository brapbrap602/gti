<h1>Chapter 599: Celestial Fire</h1><p>Chapter 599: Celestial Fire</p><p>For countless millennia, the sword energy endures.</p><p>Entering the Purple Micro Palace, Qin Sang had witnessed so many unimaginable things, experiencing shock after shock, until he became numb.</p><p>This sword mark cleaved a mountain, shattering countless ancient halls.</p><p>It serves as a warning to all who would dare trespass.</p><p>Qin Sang stared blankly at the mark, when suddenly he heard a faint "click."  He quickly raised his wrist; a fine crack had appeared on a dragon scale of his dragon-shaped wooden bracelet.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed drastically. The bracelet could barely suppress the mark.</p><p>He had promised to help Yun Youzi heal, and in return Yun Youzi had painstakingly obtained the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit for him.  He had received his reward, and couldn't break his word.</p><p>Fortunately, there was only one crack in the bracelet; it should hold for a while longer.</p><p>Because the transformation of the Flying Night Rakshasa was not yet complete, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had agreed to conserve their Corpse Pill energy to deal with emergencies.  Now, he dared not wait any longer.</p><p>He directly unsealed the Corpse Pill and said solemnly, "Senior, please guide the way."</p><p>Without delay, they began their ascent.</p><p>After entering the cloudy mountain, the mountain ranges and ancient halls vanished from view.  A massive illusionary array filled the mountain.</p><p>Yun Youzi took out a compass-like object, giving one to Qin Sang as well, and instructed him on its use.</p><p>This item seemed to be a magical artifact specifically crafted for this illusion array. Once activated with spiritual energy, a golden needle appeared in the center of the compass, guiding their way.</p><p>The golden needle pointed to a winding mountain path, perilous and narrow.</p><p>Luckily, their journey was smooth; they encountered no danger and soon reached the summit.</p><p>They stood before a dried-up lake. Across it lay ruins, while endless mist still shrouded the mountain, completely concealing it within the illusion array.</p><p>Yun Youzi stepped forward, manipulating the compass and pointing towards the opposite shore.  He said solemnly, "Go there!"</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, entering the lake and proceeding straight ahead.</p><p>They passed above several collapsed ancient halls. Qin Sang frequently used his spiritual sense to scan the ruins, but found nothing.</p><p>However, Qin Sang noticed that the arrangement of these halls seemed to have a hidden design and special purpose.</p><p>"To my knowledge, these halls were probably ancient alchemists' workshops!"</p><p>Yun Youzi, while using the compass to determine their location, explained to Qin Sang, pointing to the channels on the ground amongst the ruins, "These are likely fire channels. They worked with spiritual arrays to draw flames from elsewhere to assist in alchemy."</p><p>Qin Sang had long found these channels strange; he never expected them to be fire channels.  He asked dubiously, "The Purple Micro Palace is so mysterious. Even if not all its inhabitants were powerful, their cultivation must have been high.  Foundation Establishment cultivators can use their own alchemic fires to refine pills and artifacts; their power surpasses earth fire. What kind of flames were they drawing, and why were they sharing it amongst so many people, if it was stronger than the spiritual fire produced from their own spiritual energy?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew a little about artifact refinement; alchemy and artifact refinement share some similarities.</p><p>The mountain contained countless ancient halls; if they were all alchemists' workshops, what kind of celestial fire could sustain so many alchemists refining pills simultaneously?</p><p>Yun Youzi said,</p><p>"Alchemic fires are not necessarily stronger than all earth fires.  Do you remember the Mountain within the Mountain of the Xu Ling Sect, little brother?  It contains a type of mutated earth fire far superior to ordinary earth fire, the foundation of the Xu Ling Sect's establishment.</p><p>"Countless unique spiritual fires are spoken of in the cultivation world; some are called celestial fires, far more powerful than the infant fires of Nascent Soul cultivators. Cultivators who refine these flames can use them for alchemy and artifact refinement, achieving far greater results with less effort and greatly increasing the success rate.</p><p>"Furthermore, these ancient halls must have powerful restrictions to control the flames, eliminating the need for the refiner to focus on controlling the flames themselves.</p><p>"As for what kind of flame it is, you will find out soon enough…"</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of all these things Yun Youzi mentioned.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner contained the Nine Nether Demon Fire, a type of unique spiritual fire.</p><p>Qin Sang had long been eyeing the Nine Nether Demon Fire, hoping to use it for artifact refinement.</p><p>With only one Ten Directions Yama Banner, the assistance the Nine Nether Demon Fire could provide was limited. However, Qin Sang already knew how to use three banners to form an array, greatly increasing the fire's power.</p><p>Whether it would be useful remained to be seen, until he reached Foundation Establishment and could freely manipulate the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>Hearing that the celestial fire in the palace was still burning, Qin Sang's anticipation grew immensely.</p><p>This fire must be extraordinary. Could it be the legendary Sun God Fire, or the Sun's Essence Fire?</p><p>If it truly was an unparalleled celestial fire, could he adapt the methods of the Kui Yin Ancestor's refinement of the Ten Directions Yama Banner, and attempt to subdue it once his cultivation improved?</p><p>This thought spurred Qin Sang onward, his pace quickening.</p><p>The further they went, the more thoroughly destroyed the ancient halls became.  Qin Sang silently calculated their location, realizing that Yun Youzi was leading him towards the sword mark; no wonder he felt such immense pressure ahead.</p><p>Pressed by the sword energy, they were forced to slow down, no longer daring to fly, and trudged along the ground, getting closer and closer to the sword scar.</p><p>Qin Sang was drenched in sweat. He not only had to contend with the pressure of the sword energy but also help Yun Youzi. The true essence in the corpse pill was being rapidly consumed.</p><p>But now he couldn't afford to worry about much.  As they climbed, a second crack appeared on the wooden bracelet.</p><p>Qin Sang had no energy to pay attention to anything else, concentrating on using the corpse pill to protect himself. Finally, he heard Yun Youzi say:</p><p>"We're here."</p><p>Qin Sang widened his eyes and looked ahead. He saw a steep cliff face in front of them, on which a huge stone hall was built. Its style was similar to those below, but it was far grander and more imposing.</p><p>Surprisingly, this stone hall had not collapsed.</p><p>However, it was not undamaged.</p><p>The sword scar ran right through the center of the stone hall, splitting it cleanly in two. The break was incredibly smooth, a perfect cleave down the middle, with both sides of the sword scar remaining intact.</p><p>Years had passed, weathered by wind and sand.</p><p>Now, the stone hall, worn and pitted, showed its age.</p><p>The hall's doors stood open, the interior completely visible, yet empty.</p><p>The two of them, bracing against the pressure, moved step by step into the stone hall. Qin Sang curiously looked around, but he saw no sign of the spirit fire, nor sensed any strange fluctuations.</p><p>Yun Youzi looked around, pondered for a moment, then went inside the stone hall. He found a stone brick, knelt down, and pressed his hand on it.  A strange light flickered, and a deep rumble echoed from the depths of the earth.</p><p>Yun Youzi said to Qin Sang: "The passage to the sealed spirit fire is actually underground.  Like the Heavenly Platform in the Gathering Spirit Hall, it's extremely well hidden and undetectable from the outside. I only learned of it by accident…"</p><p>Before he could finish, the floor of the stone hall suddenly cracked open, revealing a dark passage leading directly underground.</p><p>As the passage opened, an intensely hot wave of air rushed out, causing the temperature inside the stone hall to rise sharply. A deep red glow appeared in the depths of the passage.</p><p>Yun Youzi's expression relaxed, and he said thankfully: "Good! The spirit fire is still here, and it hasn't been discovered by others!"</p>
