<h1>Chapter 2138: True Person Ning</h1><p>“Honored Senior, travel south from here for over ten thousand *li*, and you will emerge from the Sea of Mists…”</p><p>Qin Sang exited the teleportation hall and found himself on an island.  Lush vegetation covered the island, while a dense white fog shrouded everything beyond its shores.</p><p>Eight stone pillars, taller than the island's highest peak, surrounded the spirit island.  Atop each pillar floated a crystal the size of a human head. The crystals emitted a fluorescent light, illuminating the island and keeping the fog at bay.</p><p>A guard followed Qin Sang, pointing south as he described the surrounding environment, his demeanor respectful.  This teleportation formation was little known, and those who used it were typically powerful figures from the various tribes.</p><p>“Thank you for the information!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, but didn't immediately retrieve his jade token. Just as he was about to transform into light and depart, he suddenly sensed something and turned his head to the right.</p><p>A young man emerged from the forest.  Clad in a green robe and holding a feather fan, he possessed a refined air.  His appearance wasn't much different from a human, but his hair was a striking purple-red and unusually thick, resembling thin vines.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please wait!”</p><p>The young man waved from afar, calling out to Qin Sang.  With a single step, as if shrinking the earth with each stride, he arrived before Qin Sang.</p><p>Gesturing for the guard to withdraw, the young man cupped his hands in greeting. “I am Zhao Hao.  May I ask for your esteemed name?”</p><p>“What is your business?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was icy, keeping the young man at arm’s length.</p><p>The origins of the Otherfolk could usually be discerned from their appearance. However, Qin Sang couldn't tell which tribe Zhao Hao belonged to. His initial knowledge was primarily of the noble tribes. If this person wasn't deliberately concealing his identity, he likely hailed from a lesser-known Royal Tribe.</p><p>Unfazed, the young man continued with a smile.  “I’ve frequented these parts for many years and consider myself well-connected, yet I’ve never seen your face before. You must be new to this area.  Might I inquire as to the purpose of your visit?  Perhaps I could be of assistance. This area borders the Eastern Sea aquatic territories, and the situation is complex.  Those uncivilized aquatic demons are unreasonable, and having more Daoist companions can prevent one from being bullied.”</p><p>“Thank you for your kind offer, but I prefer to travel alone!”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang, without waiting for a response, summoned clouds beneath his feet and soared into the sky.</p><p>The young man's brow furrowed slightly. He suddenly caught sight of Qin Sang’s cloak shifting, revealing the token at his waist. His expression changed subtly. "So it's one of those troublesome monkeys!"  He then shook his head and turned to leave.</p><p>Flying away from the spirit island, Qin Sang traveled south. Suddenly, the scene opened up before him as the mist receded, revealing the blue sky and ocean.</p><p>Qin Sang paused and looked back.  A wall of white mist reached up to the heavens, stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>This must be the border of the Sea of Mists.  He wondered if the mist would spread beyond this point during the Mist Tide.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the location and, seeing that no one was around, retrieved the jade token, channeling his True Essence into it.</p><p>The jade token emitted a faint glow, and a gentle pulse emanated outwards. Qin Sang sensed its direction and, with a burst of light, flew towards the destination indicated by the token.</p><p>His journey was uneventful.  After flying for half a day, Qin Sang arrived at a deserted stretch of ocean.  The glow on the jade token dissipated, and its guidance vanished completely, becoming an ordinary object.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the area but found nothing unusual, only a barren island. Just as he examined the jade token, puzzled, a golden light streaked across the sky from afar.</p><p>The golden light flew directly towards the barren island, descending from the heavens to reveal a monk. The monk had ring scars on his head and wore a golden kasaya.  He landed on the ground, appraised Qin Sang, and pressed his palms together. "This humble monk is Liao Chen, from Purple Cloud Mountain Monastery.  Am I addressing True Person Qin?"</p><p>“Indeed, you are.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the courtesy, secretly surprised.</p><p>Purple Cloud Mountain was a Buddhist sect. Could Liu Li’s new master be a Buddhist monk? Based on the words of the Yuan Xiang Tribe Chief, Qin Sang had suspected Liu Li’s master was a prominent figure from the Cauldron Sect.</p><p>It was said that Buddhist sects were mostly located in the west of the Great Zhou Dynasty. Unexpectedly, he encountered one in the Eastern Sea, and it was connected to Liu Li.</p><p>Liao Chen said, “This humble monk was instructed to await True Person Qin. If you have no pressing matters, shall we depart immediately and return to the monastery?”</p><p>"I appreciate your guidance, Venerable Monk," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"You are too kind.  Please, just call me Liao Chen," Liao Chen turned around, transforming into a golden light and soaring into the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang also summoned his escaping light and followed Liao Chen, frowning slightly.  For some reason, he felt Liao Chen's attitude towards him was somewhat cold, perhaps due to his personality.</p><p>Liao Chen's cultivation was comparable to Qin Sang's.  The golden light was clearly a superior escaping technique.  If it were another cultivator, they might have to exert their full strength to barely keep up.</p><p>"Is he truly unsociable, or is he deliberately testing me?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom Liao Chen's intentions.  However, what he feared least was a competition of escaping techniques.  Silently, he caught up to Liao Chen, flying alongside him with a relaxed and leisurely demeanor.</p><p>A look of seriousness flashed in Liao Chen's eyes, and he slowed his speed slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang also reduced his speed, feigning ignorance of the previous test of speed, and asked the question that weighed most heavily on his mind. "Who among the venerable monks of Purple Cloud Mountain left the jade token, inviting this humble Daoist to come here?"</p><p>Liao Chen replied, "This humble monk was instructed by True Person Ning to welcome True Person Qin."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was somewhat bewildered.</p><p>Purple Cloud Mountain was a Buddhist sect, yet the person behind it all was a True Person. How were they connected?</p><p>So, Liu Li had indeed joined a Daoist sect.</p><p>"True Person Ning?"</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone carried a hint of questioning.</p><p>Liao Chen guessed Qin Sang's confusion and explained, "When this humble monk was young, True Person Ning had already been in seclusion at Purple Cloud Mountain for many years.  The monastery addresses True Person Ning as 'True Person.'  Many monks in the mountain, including myself, have received guidance from True Person Ning and regard her as a mentor."</p><p>Within the Daoist sects, Soul Formation and Mahayana stage experts were respectively addressed as True Monarch and Celestial Master. Whether this originated from the Cauldron Sect or the Talisman Sect was unclear, but it had become common practice. However, exceptions could exist, such as someone preferring the title "True Person."</p><p>True Person Ning had already been in seclusion for many years when Liao Chen was young, and Liao Chen was now at the mid-stage of Soul Formation.  What realm was True Person Ning at?</p><p>Although Liao Chen hadn’t explicitly stated it, one could glean some clues from his words.</p><p>Qin Sang was happy that Liu Li had such a master but also felt a sense of pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang then asked a few more questions, but Liao Chen was clearly reluctant to say too much, and Qin Sang could only give up, assuming he would get his answers upon meeting True Person Ning.</p><p>The two flew side-by-side, heading southwest.  Along the way, they frequently sensed the auras of aquatic demons, but the demons were unable to detect them.</p><p>They flew until evening, yet still hadn't reached Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Finally, as the sun was about to sink below the horizon, painting the sky with vibrant hues, Liao Chen descended and formed a hand seal, striking it towards the void.</p><p>The sea surface here was vast and empty, without islands or reefs.  As a golden hand seal materialized, the void trembled slightly, and faint ripples appeared, while the sea remained calm.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  He sensed a peculiar fluctuation emerge, yet there had been no sign of it before.</p><p>The fluctuation rapidly spread towards them.</p><p>"True Person, do not resist it," Liao Chen warned.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang felt a suction force pulling him towards the source of the fluctuation.  At the same time, the surrounding scenery underwent a dramatic transformation. The sky and sea seemed to invert, the heavens hanging upside down, as brilliant colors surged from the void, distorting everything.</p><p>Qin Sang felt himself sinking deeper, as if falling into another dimension, but at this moment, he had no time to explore the source of this power.</p><p>He saw a colossal mountain, solitary and suspended above the sea, towering and majestic, shrouded in clouds and mist.</p><p>Green pines and cypresses, verdant willows and exotic flowers.</p><p>Auspicious vapors connected to the Milky Way, and fortunate clouds touched the great void!</p><p>This was a true immortal mountain. Compared to it, aside from its mystical properties, Mount Daiyu was merely a barren hill.</p><p>At the summit of the immortal mountain, clusters of purple clouds drifted, making the mountain appear even more enigmatic.  Purple Cloud Mountain truly lived up to its name.</p><p>In all directions stretched the boundless sea, with only this single immortal mountain.  Qin Sang didn't know where he had been brought, but it was likely no longer the previous sea area.</p><p>“This is Purple Cloud Mountain,” Liao Chen gestured. “True Person, please follow me.”</p><p>With that, Liao Chen led Qin Sang directly towards Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>As they approached, Qin Sang saw countless pavilions and towers within the mountain. Near the summit, a series of halls and pavilions nestled among the trees, forming an ancient temple. This must be the Purple Cloud Mountain Monastery Liao Chen had mentioned.</p><p>Most areas were concealed by restrictive formations and mist, obscuring the view.  To avoid any complications, Qin Sang didn't have his Skygaze Butterfly use its abilities to investigate.</p><p>Liao Chen didn’t take Qin Sang to the temple but instead bypassed the front mountain and flew towards the back.</p><p>As they flew, Qin Sang sensed several gazes from within the mountain fall upon him, carrying a hint of inquiry, indicating that many within Purple Cloud Mountain were paying attention to his arrival.</p><p>However, these gazes held no hostility, only a degree of unconcealed scrutiny and detachment.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unperturbed and followed Liao Chen to the back mountain.</p><p>The terrain of the back mountain was rugged, shaded by lush trees, with streams flowing gently. A few scattered pavilions could be seen, clearly more serene than the front mountain.</p><p>A tranquil lake was hidden within the forest, and the two landed on a stone path beside it.  Liao Chen paused slightly, and Qin Sang also heard the faint sound of a zither, coming from ahead.</p><p>Liao Chen subconsciously slowed his pace, crossed a stone bridge, and rounded a grove of trees. A lakeside pavilion came into view.</p><p>The pavilion was exquisite and graceful, with a long table inside. On the table was a zither, and someone, their back to them, with a slender figure, presumably a woman, was engrossed in playing, the melody flowing from her fingertips.</p><p>Liao Chen stopped and stood quietly outside the pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang also remained silent. It was just an ordinary zither melody, devoid of any True Essence or Dharma power, nor was it a chapter of the Dao of Sound. Yet, it was the most enchanting melody Qin Sang had ever heard.</p><p>He involuntarily closed his eyes, focusing on listening.  The music seemed to meld with nature, or perhaps nature had merged into the melody.</p><p>The chirping of insects, the singing of orioles, the sound of flowing water, the rustling of wind, the collision of leaves - everything became more captivating within the music, intoxicating the senses.</p><p>Yet, somehow, gradually, Qin Sang detected a trace of sorrow within the melody, making him puzzled. The fish, insects, and birds harmonizing with the music were clearly filled with joy.</p><p>Could he have misheard, or did each listener perceive a different tune?</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed before the zither music abruptly ceased.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, feeling a sense of loss.  He was certain he hadn't been entranced by the music.  It wasn't some Daoist technique.  Yet, at this moment, his mind was unusually calm.  He could only explain it as "divine skill."</p><p>As her hands left the strings, Liao Chen softly spoke, "True Person Ning, True Person Qin has arrived."</p><p>Saying this, Liao Chen stepped aside, gesturing for Qin Sang to approach.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the front of the pavilion. True Person Ning also stood up, turning to face him.</p><p>As expected, True Person Ning was a woman, dressed in a green Daoist robe with her hair styled in a Daoist bun.</p><p>In her presence, one subconsciously overlooked her appearance, perhaps even forgetting her features after turning away, leaving only a vague yet unforgettable impression.  At this moment, Qin Sang detected no trace of sorrow in True Person Ning.  The feeling she gave him was like the tranquil lake surface, yet also like the boundless ocean.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't see through True Person Ning. The only thing he could ascertain was that her realm was definitely far superior to his own, at least a Soul Formation expert.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>However, it was True Person Ning who spoke first, her voice gentle, "May I ask what rank and position True Person Qin holds in the Heavenly Court?"</p><p>True Person Ning had seen through his identity, which didn’t surprise Qin Sang.  With the Thunder Altar and the various thunder talismans, anyone familiar with Daoism could tell he had connections to the Talisman Sect.</p><p>However, before the Heavenly Court reappeared, only scattered inheritances existed in the Great Thousand World. Those inheritors hadn't yet received the Heavenly Court's recognition, yet True Person Ning seemed to assume he came from the Heavenly Court.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression became serious. "Rank Three, Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Celestial Immortal, Divine Firmament Jade Pivot Emissary, Five Thunders Court Lord Qin Sang, greets True Person Ning!"</p><p>Along the way, Liao Chen's attitude had made Qin Sang suspect that this trip might not be simple.  Just facing True Person Ning, he felt an invisible pressure. He needed a source of strength to face her directly, and aside from the secrets he couldn't reveal, only his Heavenly Court position would suffice.</p><p>While announcing his title, Qin Sang subtly invoked the aura of the Decree of Appointment Golden Book within the Thunder Altar.</p><p>The Decree of Appointment Golden Book was a Celestial Master's decree, issued from the Ninth Heaven Golden Palace and bearing the Dao Scripture Master’s Treasure Seal. It was impossible for outsiders to forge, and True Person Ning would naturally be able to discern its authenticity.</p><p>“So it is the Thunder Jade Palace Lord Qin.  This humble Daoist greets you.”</p><p>A flicker of surprise crossed True Person Ning's eyes, and she returned a formal bow.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the change in True Person Ning's demeanor.  Merely stating his title earned him the respect of a powerful figure.  He couldn't imagine the grandeur of the Heavenly Court in its prime.</p><p>It was also evident that True Person Ning didn't harbor any animosity towards the Heavenly Court, which made Qin Sang secretly relieved.</p><p>However, the Heavenly Court's official ranks had different levels. If he were an ordinary celestial official, True Person Ning certainly wouldn't react this way, indicating that at the height of the Heavenly Court's power, with his current cultivation, he likely wouldn't have been qualified to preside over the Five Thunders Court.</p><p>“Lord Qin, please.”</p><p>True Person Ning gestured towards the opposite side of the jade table.</p><p>A meditation cushion was placed on each side of the table. Qin Sang thanked her, entered the pavilion, sat down cross-legged, and looked at the ancient zither on the table.</p><p>The zither was dark yellow, its material unknown. Qin Sang didn't sense any spiritual nature from it. It was either an ordinary object or a supreme treasure.</p><p>True Person Ning sat down again, put the zither away, personally arranged a jade teapot and teacups, and meticulously brewed spirit tea.</p><p>Wisps of tea fragrance curled upwards.</p><p>Even watching True Person Ning brew tea was a delightful experience.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered what True Person Ning would say, whether she would inquire about matters related to the Heavenly Court first.</p><p>What to say, what not to say, how to use his authority – he had carefully considered all these before coming and had a plan in mind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, True Person Ning's first question was completely unforeseen.</p><p>True Person Ning pushed a cup of clear tea towards Qin Sang and softly asked, "Has Mount Daiyu already been taken by Lord Qin?"</p>
