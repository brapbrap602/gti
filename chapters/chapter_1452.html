<h1>Chapter 1444: A Complex Transaction</h1><p>Chapter 1444: A Complex Transaction</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside before withdrawing his gaze.</p><p>Earth Escape Technique was the rarest among the Five Elements Escape Techniques.  Most variations focused on concealment and hiding within the earth, but this person was requesting a type of swift escape, akin to Lightning Escape or Wind Escape.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the secret techniques and cultivation methods he had collected, finding nothing of the sort.</p><p>He did know Sword Escape and Lightning Escape, but those were skills he had cultivated through rigorous swordsmanship and a gift from the Azure Bird's blood.  He couldn't teach them to others, even if the other person would be overjoyed to receive them.</p><p>He had two choices: wait to see if anyone else traded an Earth Escape Technique.</p><p>Or find another way.</p><p>Qin Sang probed his storage bag with his spiritual sense, scanning four spirit herbs before settling on a jet-black vine, only as thick as a thumb.</p><p>The vine's surface was rough, with numerous bulbous growths, and a black liquid seemed to be flowing inside, about to burst forth.</p><p>This was a Dark煞 Thorn.</p><p>To Qin Sang's knowledge, a spirit elixir called Profound Hun Dan used Dark煞 Thorn as one of its main ingredients.  Cultivators practicing earth-elemental techniques who consumed this elixir would have their true essence refined, becoming more substantial and greatly benefiting their future cultivation and breakthroughs.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Profound Hun Dan was also something Qin Sang had only read about in ancient texts, and the formula was likely even harder to find than the Dark煞 Thorn.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang had only exchanged for ancient formulas that might be useful to him; he didn't have the Profound Hun Dan formula and didn't know whether the Taiyi Pill Sect had it in their collection.</p><p>Dan Ding Mountain most likely didn't.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang took out the Dark煞 Thorn, several people had already begun negotiating with the owner of the Seven Masters Buddha Seal.</p><p>Bodily cultivation was rare, and the same was true for Nascent Soul level bodily cultivation techniques. Many were eager to obtain it without paying too much.</p><p>However, according to the trading meeting's rules, each technique or secret could only be traded once per session.  Therefore, the owner of the Seven Masters Buddha Seal remained firm.</p><p>Seeing that he showed no intention of lowering the price, many lost interest, leaving only a few who persisted, attempting to persuade him to relax his conditions.</p><p>"A complete Dark煞 Thorn!"</p><p>Qin Sang held a jade token and spoke softly, briefly explaining the effects of the Profound Hun Dan and adding, "You could also directly refine the Dark煞 Thorn; your true essence will then blend with the Dark煞 Yin Qi, giving you an unexpected advantage against enemies."</p><p>This method of refinement was somewhat wasteful, however.</p><p>"Does the Profound Hun Dan truly have such effects?"</p><p>"Do you know how to refine the Profound Hun Dan?"</p><p>"If it's true, I can give you something even better…"</p><p>…</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished speaking, and before the owner of the Seven Masters Buddha Seal could react, other cultivators practicing earth-elemental techniques, unable to contain themselves, began to ask questions excitedly.</p><p>Venerable Chong Tai lightly coughed, suppressing the noise.  "Some of you may have forgotten these rules… It's this cultivator's turn now. Please remain calm; there will be time for free discussion later!"</p><p>Silence returned to the island in the lake.</p><p>Only then did the owner of the Seven Masters Buddha Seal hesitantly speak, "Do you have the Profound Hun Dan formula?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly; this was the crux of the problem.</p><p>After a pause, he added, "If you don't mind, after the trading meeting, I can introduce you to a master alchemist. Or, give me some time, and I will inquire among my friends, though I can't guarantee I will find it."</p><p>Qin Sang was thinking of asking around back in the Northern Star Realm. He already had experience traversing the storm belt and wouldn’t be as clumsy as last time.</p><p>But this meant they needed to contact each other privately.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind; besides the Demon Lord Hun, few could threaten him.</p><p>The key was the other party.</p><p>Sure enough, the owner of the Seven Masters Buddha Seal said, "I think I'll wait and see."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, the enthusiasm of others also plummeted. They thought, no wonder, who would exchange such a precious spirit herb for a bodily cultivation technique.</p><p>Seeing no strong contenders, Qin Sang didn't rush to increase his offer or urge the other party, openly displaying the Dark煞 Thorn.</p><p>This transaction didn't materialize.  Venerable Chong Tai announced the next participant and moved another bamboo building into place.</p><p>The trading continued.</p><p>Next.</p><p>Bamboo buildings were moved in one after another.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, before the trading meeting reached its halfway point, he saw three spirit materials suitable for reforging the Golden Immersion Sword: a piece of Azure Dot Gold, a clump of flocculent cloud crystal, and two drops of Celestial Crown Heavy Liquid; this wasn't including the ones he'd already acquired.</p><p>Exchanging for one or two of these, plus the Falling Phoenix Jade…</p><p>With Qin Sang's skill in the Dao of Refinement, he could barely raise the Golden Immersion Sword to the level of a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>Different materials would imbue the Golden Immersion Sword with different properties.</p><p>However, Qin Sang only wanted to quickly improve the Golden Immersion Sword's grade; other requirements weren't stringent; materials with similar properties would suffice.</p><p>The Golden Immersion Sword was merely a replacement for the Cloud Touring Sword, mainly used to perform Sword Escape and the Seven Souls Killing Array. A sufficient grade would allow the array to unleash its full power.</p><p>This explains why these materials are suitable for various purposes; otherwise, it would take a considerable amount of time to find suitable replacements.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rush into trading.  He watched the various rare treasures with great interest, feeling that today's trip had been incredibly worthwhile and eye-opening.</p><p>Several items particularly caught his attention.</p><p>Unfortunately, compared to other Yuan Ying cultivators, Qin Sang's cultivation time was too short, and his accumulated resources were insufficient.  The valuable treasures he had obtained through rare opportunities couldn't be used for trading; he had to prioritize his most pressing needs.</p><p>As Qin Sang was carefully considering his options, he suddenly heard the owner of the central bamboo building say, "I am seeking a technique or secret method to enhance spiritual perception. I can exchange it for two authentic Daoist cultivation methods, one focusing on Gold and the other on Wood.  Other conditions can also be negotiated."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts stirred at this.</p><p>Wasn't the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" precisely a cultivation method for spiritual perception?</p><p>He didn't need the complete secret method; offering just the first level would attract many eager buyers. In this era, incomplete secret methods are the norm.</p><p>Qin Sang also had no fear of the buyer achieving mastery and posing a threat.</p><p>As for the possibility of the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" leaking out and leading the Hun Mo Elder to connect it to the Netherworld Demon Fire from their struggle over the treasure in the Buddhist temple, Qin Sang wasn't worried.</p><p>The person had just traded for several artifacts, indicating they were a Daoist cultivator.</p><p>After the Grand Demon Assembly ends and he leaves Hun Mo Island, even if the Hun Mo Elder discovers something, there's nothing to worry about.</p><p>The problem lies in the two major limitations of this secret method.</p><p>First, a powerful spiritual fire must be found. Second, cultivation requires the cooperation of a transparent lotus seed.  Unless the other party also possesses something like the jade Buddha—a treasure that can mitigate the dangers—this would be a significant hurdle.</p><p>Qin Sang had used transparent lotus seeds several times during his attempts to condense fire seeds, but eventually he didn't use them and kept one in his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't sell the transparent lotus seed.</p><p>He had just broken through to the second level of the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" and his understanding of this technique was still superficial.  If the transparent lotus seed has other uses beyond helping condense fire seeds, he would regret it terribly.</p><p>Without the transparent lotus seed, the value of the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" would be significantly reduced.</p>
