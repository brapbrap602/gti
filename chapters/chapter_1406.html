<h1></h1><p>"Voidsea..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the well-known sea areas in the Boundless Sea that he knew, but there was no Voidsea.</p><p>Steward Luo saw Qin Sang's confusion and continued to explain, "Fellow cultivator, please don't misunderstand. Whether it was the former Pure Lake or the current Voidsea, they are not famous in the Boundless Sea, nor are there any eye-catching rumors. It's just a name that exists on the sea chart. Fellow cultivators who are active in the southern part of the Boundless Sea may be more familiar with the Voidsea. It is said that there are no islands in the Voidsea, the seawater is exceptionally clear, and there are no storms all year round. Ships sailing here don't have to worry about capsizing due to storms, which is rare in the south. Traveling here, the heart is naturally ethereal. It was called Pure Lake before, probably for this reason..."</p><p>As he spoke, Steward Luo took out the sea chart and pointed out the location of the Voidsea to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Voidsea is even further south than Nine Ring Island, and the two places are not close to each other. But for a Nascent Soul, it's only a matter of three to five days.</p><p>It's definitely not a coincidence!</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the Pure Lake mentioned by Valley Master Mu was this place.</p><p>What surprised him was that there were no rumors about relics or secret realms in the Pure Lake.</p><p>"The Wu Clan inheritance can't have sprung out of a crack in the rock. Perhaps something has been concealed. Did Valley Master Mu have new discoveries when he returned to the Pure Lake?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the sea chart and pondered secretly.</p><p>The Pure Lake, also known as the Voidsea, is a vast sea area. Searching for a possible secret realm here alone is truly like searching for a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Moreover, there haven't been any related legends for so long, so even if there is a secret hidden, it won't be easy to discover.</p><p>For now, it's best to meet with Valley Master Mu first.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang inquired with the Nine Stars Association about the news of the Profound Sky Palace, whether there were any recent rumors or unusual behavior.</p><p>Steward Luo was shocked by Qin Sang's outlandish request and said with difficulty, "Most of our forces are in the mid-western part of the Boundless Sea. Unless the Profound Sky Palace attacks the Boundless Sea, or the experts of the Profound Sky Palace have done something in the Boundless Sea, the news won't be sent back so quickly..."</p><p>Afterward.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Nine Stars Sea Area, no longer hesitated, and flew directly to Nine Ring Island.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Lan Jingsi for several months, Qin Sang finally arrived at Nine Ring Island.</p><p>The current Island Lord of Nine Ring Island is only in the early stage of Nascent Soul, but thanks to the reputation of Nine Ring Island, he is well-known in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>This is because the founding Island Lord of Nine Ring Island, Real Person Jiu Jie , was a well-deserved powerhouse, said to be only one step away from a Great Cultivator, and was once as famous as Old Demon Hunmo .</p><p>In the end, Old Demon Hunmo successfully took this step, while Real Person Jiu Jie stopped here and eventually perished.</p><p>"After so long, I don't know if anything has changed in the middle."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Nine Ring Island, slowly flew into the island, and landed in front of the city gate.</p><p>Nine Ring Island is quite prosperous, with cultivators and mortals living together, without obvious barriers.</p><p>The city is full of people.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired slightly and easily found the place, which was a small shop called Treasure Splendor Pavilion.</p><p>There were no customers in the shop, only an old shopkeeper.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped into the shop. The old shopkeeper glanced at him and quickly got up to greet him, "Fellow cultivator, do you need elixirs or magical artifacts?"</p><p>"Are you Zhang Xuan?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around. Seeing the old shopkeeper nod, he said, "This humble Daoist is Mingyue , and I am here at the invitation of Daoist Mu."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang took out the token that Lan Jingsi had given him before leaving.</p><p>The old shopkeeper's expression changed slightly, and he said in a low voice: "Please, senior, follow this junior to the back hall! Senior Mu has already prepared a high-quality cave dwelling for senior..."</p><p>"No need!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, "How long will it take for Valley Master Mu to come and see me?"</p><p>The old shopkeeper replied, "Senior Mu specifically instructed this junior a few days ago. After sending the message, he will arrive in at most five days."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and handed the old shopkeeper a guiding spirit talisman, "After Daoist Mu returns, give this talisman to him. Light the spirit talisman, and he will be able to find this humble Daoist."</p><p>After leaving the spirit talisman, Qin Sang was decisive and turned to leave the shop.</p><p>The old shopkeeper dared not stop him and could only watch Qin Sang disappear into the crowd.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about Voidsea in the city. The information he obtained was similar to the news he had received from the Nine Stars Association, so he did not stay long and left Nine Ring Island that night.</p><p>Five days later.</p><p>Qin Sang casually opened a cave dwelling on a deserted island and was cultivating quietly when he was suddenly awakened by a wave of fluctuations.</p><p>The spirit talisman in his hand burned spontaneously without fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression moved slightly, and he immediately dropped the spirit talisman and flashed away.</p><p>Before long, a ray of light, undisguised, broke through the air from the direction of Nine Ring Island and landed on the deserted island, revealing a man.</p><p>This person appeared to be about forty years old, with a dignified appearance, bright eyes, and wearing a magic robe embroidered with spirit insects identical to those on the disciples of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>It was Valley Master Mu!</p><p>He discovered the existence of the cave dwelling and was about to speak when he suddenly felt something and turned to see Qin Sang walking out of the dense forest.</p><p>"Is Your Excellency Daoist Priest Mingyue?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu looked delighted and asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "This humble Daoist was delayed on the road for too long and kept Valley Master Mu waiting."</p><p>He secretly sized up Valley Master Mu.</p><p>It was difficult to judge this person's strength from his aura alone.</p><p>"Not late! Not late! It's good that Daoist arrived smoothly," Valley Master Mu laughed heartily, "Daoist is so cautious. If I had known, I wouldn't have gone to so much trouble to make so many arrangements on Nine Ring Island!"</p><p>"Traveling abroad, I have to be careful. I hope fellow Daoist doesn't mind. Seeing Daoist Mu, this humble Daoist is relieved."</p><p>As Qin Sang spoke, he invited Valley Master Mu into the cave dwelling to talk in detail.</p><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, the two began to talk about business.</p><p>"Three months ago, Junior Sister used a secret messaging technique to tell me about Daoist... I'll ask one more question now, does Daoist really want to learn the Soul Ascension Ritual?"</p><p>Valley Master Mu asked in a deep voice.</p><p>"That's right," Qin Sang nodded, "If Daoist Mu has any conditions, please feel free to bring them up. As long as this humble Daoist can do it, I will definitely try my best."</p><p>Valley Master Mu hesitated for a moment and said, "Troubling Daoist to come all the way here, I won't beat around the bush. The Soul Ascension Art is not impossible to pass on to Daoist, but I need to confirm one thing first. Does Daoist have a Three Transformations Fire Jade Centipede in his possession?"</p><p>As he spoke, Valley Master Mu looked at Qin Sang with expectation in his eyes.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Sure enough, there was a reason why Valley Master Mu invited him instead of Feng Shangshi , who had a better relationship with him, to help.</p><p>It turned out he had set his sights on the treasure-hunting ability of the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>"Treasure hunting, I wonder what kind of treasure it is and what is its relationship with the Wu Clan?"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flashed rapidly, and he readily opened the spirit beast pouch.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede fell into Qin Sang's palm, still unaware of its upcoming fate, and was holding a Fire Melting Pill, feasting on it.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Fire Jade Centipede with affection and said with pity, "This humble Daoist is learning the Soul Ascension Ritual for this little guy."</p><p>Valley Master Mu stared at it for a moment and said with delight, "It really is a Fire Jade Centipede, and it's about to enter the late stage of the Third Transformation. As long as the legends are true, it should meet the requirements!"</p>
