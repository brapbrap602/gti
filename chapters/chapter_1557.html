<h1></h1><p>Sect Master Mo, bewildered, saw Luo Rong Daoren's expression and felt increasingly uneasy, even having the urge to turn and flee.</p><p>The palanquin arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>A wary glint flashed in Luo Rong Daoren's eyes, and he discreetly crushed the thumb ring on his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, slightly cupping his hands and bowing, "This must be Fellow Daoist Luo Rong of the Six Voids Sect? This humble Daoist's Dharma Name is Qing Feng. I've long admired your name!"</p><p>"This humble Daoist's Dharma Name is indeed Luo Rong. I consider myself well-connected, having interacted with many fellow Daoists, yet I don't recall meeting Fellow Daoist Qing Feng before.  Might I inquire as to your Immortal Abode?"</p><p>Luo Rong's expression had returned to normal, a forced smile on his lips.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is but a wandering cultivator, an unknown figure. It's natural that Fellow Daoist wouldn't recognize me." Qin Sang gestured to the side, extending a hand toward the Welcoming Hall, "Please!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's evasiveness and unwillingness to reveal his origins,</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren's face darkened, his tone turning cold. "No need! This humble Daoist has just heard Sect Master Mo explain the situation and is aware of Fellow Daoist's intentions. Let's address the matter at hand first."</p><p>A murmur rippled through the crowd.</p><p>The Xie Clan members stood behind Qin Sang.</p><p>The Six Voids Sect disciples brought by Luo Rong Daoren and Sect Master Mo also landed.</p><p>The two sides were clearly delineated.</p><p>Sect Master Mo wore a numb expression; Mount Pu's ownership no longer concerned him.</p><p>The Six Voids Sect disciples formed a defensive formation behind Luo Rong Daoren, their vigilance apparent.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist is indeed a straightforward person."</p><p>Qin Sang seemed oblivious to the Six Voids Sect disciples' subtle movements, turning to look at Mount Pu's main peak. "This mountain was originally the ancestral land of the Xie Clan. The Xie Clan's lineage remains unbroken. The Six Voids Sect is the largest sect in the vicinity. Fellow Daoist Luo Rong should be somewhat aware of this, correct? The Luo Yan Sect drove the Xie Clan down the mountain and occupied Mount Pu, refusing to relinquish it.  This is neither just nor reasonable. Shouldn't it be returned?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren said indifferently, "The Central Plains, the Nineteen Provinces of Misty Rain.  This humble Daoist cannot speak for the other provinces, but at least within Zhuo Province, peace reigns.  There's no possibility of such an egregious act as forcibly seizing another's cultivation grounds.  Otherwise, even without Fellow Daoist's intervention, my Six Voids Sect would not stand idly by. As far as this humble Daoist knows, the Xie Clan made a transaction with the Luo Yan Sect regarding Mount Pu and requested our sect to act as witness. Is this not the case?"</p><p>Sect Master Mo numbly nodded.</p><p>An elderly Golden Core cultivator stepped forward from behind. "Reporting to Martial Uncle, this disciple was indeed the appointed witness. The Luo Yan Sect borrowed Mount Pu temporarily, offering their sect's treasure, the Azure Vine Canopy, as collateral to the Xie Clan, agreeing to return it after a set period. Now that the time has passed, the Xie Clan has destroyed the Azure Vine Canopy and cannot produce it. According to the agreement, Mount Pu should belong to the Luo Yan Sect."</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren chuckled, shaking his head and sighing as if lamenting for Qin Sang.  "Did Fellow Daoist hear that?  You previously listened to the one-sided account of the Xie Clan and were likely misled. The Central Plains has its own rules, rules that cannot be disregarded. Fellow Daoist is an Immortal personage, free and unfettered. Why wade into this muddy water and tarnish your reputation?"</p><p>Qin Sang clapped his hands.</p><p>Xie Qian stepped forward, presenting a wooden box with both hands.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the box and took out the azure gauze canopy inside, gently shaking it. The canopy unfolded, transforming into a wisp of azure smoke, revealing itself to be a magical treasure.</p><p>However, this treasure's radiance was dim, its power barely a tenth of its prime, and its recovery was impossible.</p><p>"Whether this treasure was destroyed by the Xie Clan remains to be seen. This humble Daoist considers himself somewhat knowledgeable in the Dao of Artifact Refinement and knows no less than ten methods to achieve the effect of self-destruction. Such petty tricks might deceive those with less experience, perhaps even the disciples of your sect and the Luo Yan Sect, but Fellow Daoist wouldn't be fooled, would you? As for why this humble Daoist insists on intervening…"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dwell on the cause of the Azure Vine Canopy's damage. His gaze shifted to Sect Master Mo. "Sect Master Mo, would you please open the mountain protection formation?"</p><p>Sect Master Mo instinctively looked at Luo Rong Daoren.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren frowned deeply, his voice heavy. "Open it!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Sect Master Mo hurriedly flew towards the main peak.</p><p>Seeing their Sect Master's demeanor, the Luo Yan Sect disciples fell silent, huddling together. The main peak was eerily quiet.</p><p>The clouds and mist on the main peak parted.</p><p>Clouds formed beneath Qin Sang's feet as he led the Xie Clan disciples, ascending the main peak first.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren, his eyes fixed on Qin Sang's back, flicked his wide sleeves and followed.</p><p>A moment later, they arrived at the Xie Clan Stone.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward alone, reaching out to touch the Xie Clan Stone, gently caressing it. He let out a barely audible sigh. "The Xie Clan Stone was erected by the ancestors of the Xie Clan and has always been its symbol, used to test Spiritual Roots and transmit teachings.  Outsiders, however, are unaware that it has another function. Due to its unique material and being infused with the blood essence of our ancestor,  those of the Xie Clan bloodline will experience a resonance upon direct contact."</p><p>As his words fell, a faint white light emanated from the top of the Xie Clan Stone, its texture transforming into warm, smooth jade.</p><p>This sight not only surprised Luo Rong Daoren and the others, but even Xie Qian and Xie An were stunned.</p><p>Qin Sang's words were entirely true.</p><p>Only those with the Xie Clan bloodline could trigger such a change in the Xie Clan Stone.</p><p>With the Xie Clan's decline and dwindling resources, they couldn't support all branches.  Could this Nascent Soul ancestor be a descendant of the Xie Clan living elsewhere?</p><p>In an instant, the Xie Clan members' expressions shifted from shock to ecstasy.</p><p>"You're a Xie Clan member?"</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren's face changed as well.</p><p>An outsider reclaiming Mount Pu for the Xie Clan was different from a Xie Clan ancestor returning.</p><p>This meant the emergence of a new Nascent Soul power within the Six Voids Sect's sphere of influence, and a Mid-Nascent Soul cultivator at that!</p><p>Negotiation might have been possible before, but now, acknowledging this could not be done lightly!</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren, without concealing his intent, released his divine sense, repeatedly scanning the Xie Clan Stone. He even stepped forward to test it himself, completely unable to detect any manipulation by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled but remained silent.</p><p>Indeed, only the Xie Clan bloodline could activate the Xie Clan Stone.</p><p>However, he could also subtly manipulate the restrictions left by Xiao Xiangzi within the Clear Void Illusionary Realm to mimic this effect.</p><p>The Xie Clan, even to this day, couldn't fully comprehend these restrictions.</p><p>Back then, in his fury, Xiao Xiangzi might have destroyed this cultivation ground entirely if not for the Clear Void Illusionary Realm's exceptional robustness. The restrictions he left behind were potent and extremely well-hidden.</p><p>Moreover, with Luo Rong Daoren's cultivation inferior to Qin Sang's, he naturally couldn't discern Qin Sang's methods.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren's expression flickered as he pondered how to respond.  Suddenly, his gaze shifted, his expression easing slightly. His lips moved subtly, as if communicating with someone.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't interrupt Luo Rong Daoren. Instead, he looked up at the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the sky was cloudless.</p><p>The azure expanse stretched endlessly.</p><p>Within the seemingly empty void, faint ripples like those on water suddenly appeared. Then, two figures in Daoist robes materialized out of thin air—the other two Nascent Soul ancestors of the Six Voids Sect.</p><p>One was a female cultivator, Dharma Name Jing Ning, her cultivation realm similar to Luo Rong Daoren's, both at Early Nascent Soul.</p><p>The other was a vigorous old Daoist, holding a horsetail whisk, emanating an immortal air. He was the current Sect Master of the Six Voids Sect, Cheng Huanzi, the most powerful of the three, a Mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Luo Rong Daoren had sensed trouble and secretly transmitted a message to his sect.</p><p>Now, the three Nascent Soul cultivators of the Six Voids Sect were gathered on Mount Pu.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is Cheng Huanzi."</p><p>His voice boomed across the area.</p><p>As he uttered the last word, Cheng Huanzi appeared beside Luo Rong Daoren, followed by the female cultivator Jing Ning.</p><p>"Senior Brother, Junior Sister."</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren bowed.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi nodded, turning his gaze to Qin Sang. He waved his whisk. "Our Daoist lineage is indeed filled with remarkable individuals. Upon receiving Junior Brother's message, this humble Daoist learned of Grand Daoist Qing Feng's esteemed presence. Please forgive our tardy welcome."</p><p>"I'm quite mortified that a minor matter between juniors has disturbed the three Fellow Daoists' cultivation," Qin Sang chuckled, a hint of mockery in his tone.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi glanced at the Xie Clan Stone, his voice deep. "This humble Daoist is aware of the circumstances.  Though my methods are inferior to Fellow Daoist's, I too possess ways to deceive and elicit a reaction from this peculiar stone, masquerading as a Xie Clan member.  Using this as proof seems rather flimsy."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes turned cold. He snorted, "Absurd!  Must I seek the approval of outsiders to return to my ancestral land and revitalize my clan?"</p><p>"Not at all! Not at all! Fellow Daoist misunderstands!"</p><p>Cheng Huanzi shook his head. "The Central Plains, with its flourishing Immortal Dao, surpasses the Northern Wastelands and Western Deserts.  This is in no small part due to our long-standing stability.  Countless individuals with malicious intent infiltrate, attempting to disrupt the Central Plains. Incidents of usurpation are not uncommon, each resulting in devastating consequences. We must be vigilant. We are acting for the greater good, to distinguish righteous cultivators from evil. We hope Fellow Daoist understands."</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, no sect wished to offend a Mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>However, allowing this person to occupy Mount Pu would create a far greater problem in the future!</p><p>Their positioning was deliberate, forming a fan shape facing Qin Sang, subtly encircling him.</p><p>The combined aura of the three Nascent Soul cultivators silently pressured Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the three, a cold smile on his lips.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi narrowed his eyes, continuing, "This humble Daoist has a bloodline testing method. If Fellow Daoist is truly a descendant of the Xie Clan, perhaps you would offer a drop of blood essence.  If you pass the test, it would at least substantiate your claim."</p><p>The more Qin Sang feigned innocence, the less Cheng Huanzi believed him. Such coincidences were rare in this world.</p><p>Sect Master Mo's suspicion was likely correct. Mount Pu harbored a great secret!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist's words are amiss!"</p><p>Suddenly, an unfamiliar voice echoed from afar, rumbling like thunder, clearly reaching everyone's ears.</p><p>A fierce wind swept across Mount Pu.</p><p>A white cloud, appearing out of nowhere, drifted in the sky, carrying two figures side by side.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qing Feng, this humble Daoist has fulfilled his promise and invited Elder Lu to uphold justice."</p><p>Qin Sang's true body nodded to his avatar, then turned to Cheng Huanzi. "Blood essence is the foundation of a cultivator. How can it be handed over to others so easily?"</p><p>The composure on Cheng Huanzi's face instantly vanished.</p><p>Firstly, because Qin Sang's true body possessed a cultivation no weaker than his avatar – another Nascent Soul expert of unknown origin!</p><p>Secondly, because of Lu Zhang, who stood beside Qin Sang.</p><p>"Elder Lu!"</p><p>Why was Lu Zhang here now?</p><p>In an instant, Cheng Huanzi connected many dots.</p><p>"It's been a long time. Fellow Daoist's cultivation has grown even more profound," Lu Zhang nodded, explaining, "This Lu happened to be passing through Fudù Prefecture and heard of an injustice. On a whim, I came to investigate, but it seems the three Fellow Daoists have arrived first."</p><p>Then, without giving Cheng Huanzi a chance to speak, Lu Zhang looked at the Azure Vine Canopy in Qin Sang's avatar's hand. "Is this the object in question?"</p><p>He beckoned the Azure Vine Canopy into his hand.</p><p>Lu Zhang clasped his hands, briefly examining it. Anger flickered on his face, and he barked, "This object was crafted with conflicting spiritual materials, deliberately concealed. Over time, it would self-destruct even without being used in combat. The one who refined this treasure harbors malicious intent! Who is the Sect Master of the Luo Yan Sect?"</p><p>Six Nascent Soul cultivators gathered on the small Mount Pu.</p><p>Sect Master Mo couldn't have imagined things escalating to this point. He was utterly devastated.  Knowing this, he would have rather led his people down the mountain from the start.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Ashen-faced, Sect Master Mo knelt, desperately making a last-ditch effort.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Sect Master Mo kowtowed repeatedly, tears streaming down his face. "The Azure Vine Canopy was my master's legacy. This junior truly didn't know its origins. Please spare me, Senior! Spare me, Senior! Martial Uncle, Martial Uncle, save me…"</p><p>He shifted all blame onto his deceased master.</p><p>A Sect Master, a dignified Golden Core cultivator, reduced to a pathetic wretch.</p><p>The entire Luo Yan Sect trembled with fear, terrified to their core.</p><p>"Scoundrel!"</p><p>Lu Zhang disdained to acknowledge Sect Master Mo, turning to Cheng Huanzi and the others.  "This person deliberately used a flawed treasure to scheme against others, plotting to seize their spiritual mountain.  His intentions are malicious!  What do the three Fellow Daoists think?"</p><p>Sect Master Mo continued to plead with Luo Rong Daoren for help.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren wished he could kick him away.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi watched Lu Zhang's actions with a cold gaze, regaining his composure.</p><p>Lu Zhang's presence here was definitely not coincidental.</p><p>Perhaps the true mastermind was Mount Bu Nian! Whether Mount Pu held a secret was irrelevant. Mount Bu Nian was merely using this as a pretext to establish a foothold in Fudù Prefecture.</p><p>Mount Pu's ownership and whether this person was truly a Xie Clan ancestor no longer mattered.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi's current concern was Mount Bu Nian's objective.</p><p>These two Nascent Soul cultivators, their origins unknown, were willingly serving Mount Bu Nian, clearly targeting the Six Voids Sect. Were they merely meant to restrain the Six Voids Sect, or were they intending to drive them out?</p><p>Cheng Huanzi regretted not contacting the Dragon Dwelling Heavenly Grotto beforehand.</p><p>The emergence of an unknown Mid-Nascent Soul cultivator within their territory should have raised alarm.</p><p>Thoughts racing, Cheng Huanzi knew they were outmatched and decided to employ delaying tactics. He coughed lightly, "Whether the Luo Yan Sect acted with malicious intent cannot be determined so hastily. Perhaps it's a misunderstanding. The Luo Yan Sect might also be a victim.  Of course, with the basis of the transaction gone, it no longer holds. Mount Pu should be returned to the Xie Clan."</p><p>Lu Zhang seemed somewhat dissatisfied but didn't react, returning the Azure Vine Canopy to Qin Sang's avatar. "This Lu cannot stay long. I trust the Fellow Daoists will ascertain the truth."</p><p>Qin Sang's true body smiled amiably. "This humble Daoist also trusts in the Six Voids Sect's impartial judgment."</p><p>No one cared about the fate of the Luo Yan Sect or Sect Master Mo.</p><p>The atmosphere eased.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi looked at Qin Sang's true body. "And this Fellow Daoist is?"</p><p>"This one's surname is Qin, given name Sang, a wandering cultivator from overseas," Qin Sang repeated his previous explanation.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Cheng Huanzi's expression stirred.  "Did Grand Daoist Qing Feng also cultivate his profound arts overseas? I've heard that the overseas Daoist lineage differs greatly from the Central Plains. This humble Daoist has long been curious but has never had the opportunity to meet a fellow Daoist from overseas.  Might I take this chance to boldly request some guidance?"</p><p>If only Qin Sang and Grand Daoist Qing Feng were present, Cheng Huanzi wouldn't be so rash.</p><p>But with Lu Zhang here, he was unafraid, using this opportunity to propose a spar and test them.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar was about to step forward when his true body stopped him.</p><p>"This Qin is about to return to my mountain soon. I too regret not having the chance to spar with a fellow Daoist from the Central Plains.  It seems our thoughts align. I wonder if I might have the honor?"</p>
