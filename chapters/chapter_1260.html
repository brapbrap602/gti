<h1>Chapter 1252  Astonishing Feather</h1><p>“Is the Thunder Hawk妖王 really here?”</p><p>Qin Sang showed surprise, staring at the thunder bead, but couldn't see anything conclusive, patiently waiting for Fat Chicken to complete the secret technique.</p><p>But Fat Chicken’s eyes were somehow filled with two lines of clear tears, his whole body trembling.</p><p>Mother and child separated for two hundred years.</p><p>Fat Chicken finally found news of his closest relative, overjoyed to tears.</p><p>Unable to suppress his excitement, after completing the secret technique, Fat Chicken eagerly opened his eyes, looked at Qin Sang, and cried out, "Master…"</p><p>“Can you pinpoint your mother’s location!”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a deep voice.</p><p>Fat Chicken immediately nodded repeatedly like a chick pecking at rice, repeatedly saying, “It’s a little blurry, but I can determine the general direction. The closer the distance, the clearer the thunder bead’s guidance!”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, put away the sword talisman, and said, “Let’s go! Let’s go rescue your mother!”</p><p>The Thunder Hawk妖王 was once able to fight two opponents at once, yet was trapped here for two hundred years, unable to escape.  It seems there are dangers within the Black Tower Formation that they don't know about.</p><p>She must be very familiar with the Black Tower Formation. If they can rescue the 妖王, she can also help them deal with Old Master Ye.</p><p>Most of the Yuan Ying cultivators in the Xiaohan region have arrived. Helping her escape should not be difficult.</p><p>However, Qin Sang planned to check the situation first before deciding whether to ask others for help.</p><p>If she could rescue the 妖王 alone, that would be best. The 妖王 has been imprisoned for so many years, she doesn't know what her condition is like now. If someone sees that the 妖王 is weak and has ill intentions, it would backfire.</p><p>Qin Sang let Fat Chicken concentrate on activating the thunder bead, his sword light enveloping the two of them as they rushed into the blood mist.</p><p>At this time.</p><p>In an unknown space.</p><p>It was pitch black, unusually cold, and the space was very small, only able to accommodate one person. Two people would feel cramped.</p><p>The walls around the space were black.</p><p>There were no stone slabs on the top, but a blood-red vortex appeared in the void, constantly rotating.</p><p>Not only did no blood mist flow in from the vortex, but wisps of spiritual energy seeped in.</p><p>At this time, a woman was sitting cross-legged in the space.</p><p>This woman wore no makeup, her silver hair naturally falling over her shoulders, her nose high and straight, her figure graceful.</p><p>She wore a soft silver robe. Upon closer inspection, one could see that threads of electric light flowed across the robe—it was woven from thunder silk.</p><p>However, she had a pair of wings on her back, a clear sign of a being from the妖族.</p><p>This woman was the Thunder Hawk 妖王, her dharma name Astonishing Feather!</p><p>She didn't know how long she had been here, she had already become accustomed to this cramped space, and she was closing her eyes indifferently, cultivating in meditation.</p><p>Trapped in this place, she didn't know what else she could do besides cultivate.</p><p>Over the years, she had to accept her fate.</p><p>The only fortunate thing was that the restrictions here had been damaged. They could only imprison her, not inflict many punishments. Otherwise, she would have long since given up and perished.</p><p>Even so, this period of time was incredibly difficult.</p><p>Even more terrifying was the uncertainty of whether she would ever be able to get out.</p><p>What kept her going was the biggest burden in her heart, her only relative.</p><p>But cultivation was so difficult. Time had passed, and without her protection, could that child, who was just born and incredibly weak, have persevered?</p><p>The dark space was deathly silent; even the passage of time was imperceptible.</p><p>At this time, Astonishing Feather suddenly awoke, abruptly rising, her hair almost brushing the blood-red vortex.</p><p>She seemed to have sensed something, revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p>The feeling was so vague that she even suspected it was an illusion caused by her overthinking.</p><p>Astonishing Feather was stunned for a moment, then suddenly realized it was real, not an illusion!</p><p>Suddenly, thunderous light surged from her body, lightning falling like rain, surging towards her, finally condensing into a thunderball the size of a dragon's eye, which she drew into her brow.</p><p>The feeling became clearer.</p><p>“Little Fat! It’s really Little Fat!”</p><p>Astonishing Feather's face was full of joy.</p><p>Firstly, she finally knew that her child was still alive. Secondly, she sensed the thunder bead getting closer, clearly coming to rescue her.</p><p>The thunder bead connected their mother-child bloodline. It had to be a blood relative; otherwise, even if other members of the same race activated the thunder bead, it wouldn't cause her to feel anything.</p><p>“How did he get in? Has he already transformed? Or has something changed in the blood lake?”</p><p>Trapped here, Astonishing Feather could only vaguely sense the thunder bead, not knowing Little Fat's situation.</p><p>She couldn't help but worry.  Could the child be under threat? Two hundred years to transform, even with her nurturing for many years, being born with a spirit of the妖, that’s an extraordinary talent.</p><p>Moreover, this is a very dangerous place.  Xiaopang doesn't know the details, and if she rushes in recklessly to save her mother, it will be extremely dangerous!</p><p>She was forced to flee into this space years ago to escape death.</p><p>She escaped that fate, but then discovered she couldn't get out.  No matter what she tried, she couldn't break through the vortex.</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Her thoughts were in turmoil; Jingyu couldn't sit still anymore.</p><p>She gritted her teeth, looked up at the crimson vortex above, and instantly transformed back into her demon form.  Her wings spread wide behind her, silently unleashing countless bolts of lightning.</p><p>The next moment, she transformed into a lightning bolt and fiercely charged towards the crimson vortex.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The crimson vortex was thrown into chaos.</p><p>The vortex spun wildly, countless crimson lights surging towards the center.</p><p>Inside the vortex, crimson light pulsed, occasionally flashing with lightning.  The two forces violently clashed, but the space beneath remained motionless.</p><p>Soon, a victor emerged.</p><p>Jingyu was defeated and fell heavily.</p><p>She was in a sorry state, her feathers damaged.</p><p>This scene had repeated countless times...</p><p>Black Tower Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Pangji were moving through the formation.</p><p>The direction indicated by the thunder bead kept changing; the formation was constantly rotating. The Black Tower wasn't static, but it was unclear what the pattern was.</p><p>However, as time passed, the thunder bead's signal became clearer, indicating they were getting closer to where the Swallowing Thunder Falcon demon king was trapped.</p><p>*Whizz!*</p><p>Having just passed through a patch of blood mist, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, then slowly backed away with Pangji.</p><p>Before them, there were over a dozen giants, nearly seven feet tall, pacing back and forth.</p><p>The giants were extraordinarily large, each wielding a huge axe in both hands, looking ferocious.  Their bodies and axes were blood-red, as if forged from congealed blood, resembling blood and flesh puppets.</p><p>Shortly after entering, Qin Sang had spotted these blood and flesh puppets wandering within the formation.</p><p>Thankfully, his Heaven's Eye ability allowed him to see them in advance.</p><p>These puppets had extremely sharp senses.  Qin Sang nearly got discovered when he got a little too close.</p><p>They seemed not very intelligent, but Qin Sang could clearly sense danger from them.  This feeling was familiar, reminding him of the unknown monster he disturbed at the bottom of the Blood River.</p><p>He wondered if there was a connection between them, whether they were created by those who built the Blood Lake, or if they were self-generated.</p><p>It seemed the Blood Lake held more dangers than met the eye.</p><p>Qin Sang had no desire to experience the taste of their bloody axes.  He carefully avoided them with Pangji and continued searching for the Swallowing Thunder Falcon demon king.</p>
