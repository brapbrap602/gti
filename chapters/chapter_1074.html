<h1>Chapter 166: The Two Steles</h1><p>With each hand seal completed, they produced a treasure. Each was a precious spiritual material, incredibly valuable and rare, the kind only the three great merchant alliances could afford to amass in such quantity.</p><p>The hand seals merged with the treasures, scattering like flower petals as they landed around the stele.</p><p>Finally, an extraordinarily complex spirit array gradually took shape, encircling the stele.</p><p>The demonic shadows behind them strode into the array.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The demonic shadows roared, channeling the power of the array as they slammed their fists into the stele.</p><p>The force of the blows was earth-shattering, accompanied by thunderous booms.</p><p>A fierce wind howled through the ravine, and demonic energy surged like a tsunami.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly ordinary stele remained standing, unmoved by the onslaught.</p><p>A faint light flickered across its surface, the glow of a mystical seal, effortlessly deflecting the blows.</p><p>The stele itself was the seal.</p><p>Even the combined efforts of the three Grandmasters, all at the peak of Mid Nascent Soul stage, along with a grand array meticulously prepared over many years, couldn't shake the seal!</p><p>However, this was just the beginning.</p><p>The demonic shadows danced wildly.</p><p>Countless fist shadows bombarded the stele.</p><p>From within the stele, the voice of the Demon Lord echoed, seemingly chanting an obscure incantation.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>After a deafening roar, all the fist shadows abruptly dissipated.</p><p>The seal remained intact, but a strange power now clung to its surface. The energy of the array converged there, gradually forming an unprecedented black talisman.</p><p>The talisman pressed against the stele, seemingly merging with the seal.</p><p>"Demonic True Spirit Talisman! Open!"</p><p>The Demon Lord roared, furiously assaulting the seal, his monstrous face contorted in a grimace.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The black talisman suddenly exploded, shattering into countless demonic needles. Some were annihilated by the seal's counterattack, but others pierced through!</p><p>The power of the Demonic True Spirit Talisman clashed with the seal.</p><p>Faint light flickered on the stele, the outcome uncertain.</p><p>Elsewhere, another transformation was occurring simultaneously!</p><p>Within the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>Strange fluctuations erupted without warning from hidden locations.</p><p>Some were in secret realms, others in the depths of forbidden zones, all places untouched by human presence.</p><p>Cliffs crumbled, and the earth cracked open.</p><p>The fluctuations intensified, accompanied by the rumble of thunder. At the center of each disturbance, a blinding golden light shone as identical altars materialized.</p><p>Each altar was approximately ten feet square at the top.</p><p>From each corner, a chain descended, embedded in the ground, covered in profound runes.</p><p>As the restrictions were activated, the chains tightened, the runes glowed, and a silvery-white light erupted.</p><p>Instantly, rust vanished, and silver snakes danced along the chains. They transformed into thunder chains, radiating an immensely powerful, righteous aura.</p><p>Lightning flashed, and thunder roared.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>Altars materialized one after another, their distribution aligned with the constellations.</p><p>Cultivators exploring the outer palace, sensing the anomaly, paused their activities and climbed to higher ground, their expressions filled with uncertainty.</p><p>Then came the three main altars.</p><p>One was in the Trial Realm, the other two deep within the inner palace's forbidden zones, all tampered with by the three alliance leaders.</p><p>The simultaneous emergence of the three main altars, the core of the seal, connected to the other auxiliary altars, amplified the seal's power.</p><p>At this moment, the entire sealing array was activated.</p><p>Starting from its deepest point, the stele gradually transformed into a silvery-white color. Countless tiny lightning bolts surged from within, striking the Demon Lord trapped beneath the seal.</p><p>The Demon Lord screamed in agony, enduring unimaginable pain, yet continued to assault the seal.</p><p>Just then, a peculiar wave reversed course through the seal, spreading outwards to the peripheral altars.</p><p>Demonic True Spirit Talismans rested on the altars, and now, pulled by the wave, their power activated without any intervention.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Pure demonic energy materialized into a grotesque face, cackling maniacally as it lunged at the thunder chains.</p><p>Engulfed by the demonic energy, the thunder chains weakened, the seal's power diminished, and the golden light of the altars dimmed, nearly extinguished.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Within the ancient hall inside the cliff face.</p><p>The three descendants of the Four Saints stood solemnly.</p><p>The hall resembled an ancestral shrine. Before them stood an altar with only three tablets.  If outsiders were to see the names on the tablets, they would be shocked.  They were the names of three of the Four Saints!</p><p>While the human race honored the four sages by naming the Four Saints Mountain on Tianxing Island, their tablets resided here.</p><p>"...These are the ancestral teachings passed down by our ancestors. You must remember them!"</p><p>The old man lit incense, paying respects to his ancestors while instructing his descendants.</p><p>"We shall keep them in our hearts, Master."</p><p>The young man and woman bowed to their ancestors, their movements meticulous.</p><p>Suddenly, a deep bell sound echoed through the hall. A black bell hanging from the old man's waist trembled violently. He glanced down, his face changing drastically as he dashed out of the hall.</p><p>The young man and woman exchanged puzzled glances, unsure what had happened.</p><p>The old man flew out of the cliff, his expression anxious.  He quickly scanned the surroundings, then rushed along the cliff towards the summit of Yitian Peak, reaching the top to see the distant ravine.</p><p>Black mist churned within the ravine, the anomaly now overwhelming the restrictions set by the three alliance leaders.</p><p>"The ancient demon is breaking the seal!"</p><p>The old man's eyes widened in alarm. He was about to rush towards the ravine when he suddenly remembered something and swiftly returned to the hall.</p><p>"Grandmaster..."</p><p>The young disciples were bewildered.</p><p>"Stay here. Don't wander off!"</p><p>The old man gave a hurried instruction and rushed to the altar.</p><p>"Forgive me, ancestors!"</p><p>He moved the altar, revealing another stele beneath, much smaller than the one in the ravine, only knee-high, and entirely jade-green, glistening like a jewel.</p><p>It was a jade stele!</p><p>The old man sat cross-legged before the jade stele, forming complex hand seals. Runes flickered around it, and ancient restrictions appeared.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The old man used a secret technique to retrieve the stele.</p><p>A loud crash resounded.  The stele, seemingly weighing a ton, lifted a few inches and then fell back down.</p><p>The old man's face flushed red.  He exerted all his true essence, using another secret technique, finally managing to lift the jade stele.  Under the worried gazes of his two disciples, he flew out of the hall without hesitation.</p><p>At the same time, the old woman, also a descendant of the Four Saints, having checked the immortal restrictions at the entrance of the Seven Killing Palace, had just entered the valley.</p><p>The bell at her waist was also vibrating.</p><p>A fierce glint flashed in the old woman's eyes, and her speed surged.</p><p>…</p><p>At the summit of Yitian Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ning Wu Hui were startled from their meditation. They exchanged a glance, abruptly stood, and went to the entrance of the hall, looking down.</p><p>Almost at the edge of their visible range.</p><p>In a ravine amidst a stone forest, black mist roiled, and strange fluctuations emanated.</p><p>"Could it be Senior Qing Zhu?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the ravine, confined within the hall, unaware of the changes unfolding there.</p><p>"Wait here. I'll get closer and see."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui observed for a moment, unable to discern anything, then vanished in a blink.</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>A sudden unease gripped Qin Sang.  The black mist seemed familiar, eerily similar to true demonic energy!</p>
