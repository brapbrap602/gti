<h1>Chapter 1832: Mid Nascent Soul</h1><p>Body as Dharma!</p><p>In his contemplation, Qin Sang gradually understood that this was the true profound meaning of the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>Once a cultivator casts this seal, they mobilize the Primordial Essence of their entire body, using their Qi and blood to enact the Golden Sun Dharma, illuminating the world like a blazing sun, and erupting with terrifying power.</p><p>Burning mountains and boiling seas, its might is unparalleled!</p><p>Having just received the inheritance and only grasping the surface, he could already foresee the terrifying power of the perfected Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>If an opponent's strength is slightly inferior, they would likely be incinerated on the spot, leaving no bones behind.</p><p>This is a seal of slaughter, even the Great Vajra Wheel Seal is inferior in this regard.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his previous speculation.  The Great Vajra Wheel Seal excels in its all-encompassing nature, while the other seals, much like the Inner Lion Seal, likely have specific focuses. This was indeed confirmed by the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>Mastering this seal doesn't directly enhance one's cultivation, but it grants a powerful divine ability for defense and offense.</p><p>However, this seal differs from the Inner Lion Seal. The Inner Lion Seal's power lies in healing and restoration. Though equally profound, it isn't complex.</p><p>Back then, with Master Huaiyin's guidance, Qin Sang mastered the Inner Lion Seal in a short time.</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal is different. Its complexity is no less than the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, especially in the subtleties of circulating Primordial Essence and mobilizing Qi and blood, it is even more intricate.</p><p>There is no mighty being to dissect this seal for him, he can only comprehend it himself.</p><p>The monk's image on the seventh floor only serves to transmit the Dharma.  The eighteen bronze monks on the sixth floor can be considered a guide to the seal's entry point, but nothing more.</p><p>Whether or not one can cultivate it depends entirely on their comprehension.</p><p>The profound meanings of the nine Luminous Seals are interconnected. Qin Sang, having already cultivated the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, believed he should be able to master the Sun Wheel Seal, but he wasn't sure how long it would take.</p><p>"Body as Dharma... enacting Dharma... Dharma..."</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, his mind stirred, and a spark of inspiration flashed.</p><p>Since it's the body enacting Dharma, could he mobilize True Essence to enhance the Golden Sun's might, or even mobilize his physical cultivation simultaneously?</p><p>Once this idea arose, it lingered.  This wasn't baseless speculation. Qin Sang himself cultivated both body and Dharma, and he gained this inspiration from the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>In his early cultivation, Qin Sang had seen more than one technique for simultaneous body and Dharma cultivation. Although those techniques were crude and lacked prospects, they demonstrated that people were constantly exploring this path.</p><p>If low-level cultivators were attempting it, high-level mighty beings were undoubtedly more numerous. When one reaches the end of a path and finds no way forward, they would certainly try other avenues, drawing analogies and even integrating different approaches.</p><p>In this vast world, there must be top-tier techniques for simultaneous body and Dharma cultivation, and even Spirit, Dharma, and Body triple cultivation!</p><p>Compared to creating a cultivation technique, creating a Daoist art or divine ability that merges body and Dharma might be easier.</p><p>The nine Luminous Seals, each unique, should represent the pinnacle of a certain aspect of body cultivation.</p><p>Would the predecessors who created the Buddhist seals have attempted this?</p><p>Qin Sang thought it highly likely, but his current understanding wasn't sufficient to verify it.</p><p>He kept this thought in mind. His next task was to quietly comprehend the seal, only then could he consider other things. However, this idea provided Qin Sang with a direction for comprehending the Sun Wheel Seal.</p><p>"Hu..."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru let out a long breath, revealing an expression of lingering enjoyment, as if immersed in the seal, unable to extricate himself.</p><p>Qin Sang then came to, looked at Venerable Zhenru, who was still savoring the previous sensation, and smiled, "With this seal, Fellow Daoist will be divinely aided. The next Heavenly Tribulation should pose no obstacle."</p><p>Venerable Zhenru stood up and bowed deeply to Qin Sang, "This poor monk is slow-witted.  Fortunately, I received the true transmission of the Dharma Seal, all thanks to Daoist Priest. This poor monk and my entire temple are eternally grateful."</p><p>Smiling, Qin Sang stood up, "What are you saying, Venerable One? This poor Daoist also witnessed the true Buddha, benefiting for life."</p><p>This was their agreed-upon exchange.  Qin Sang helped Mirror Stage Temple open the pagoda, which also benefited himself.</p><p>The space on the seventh floor only contained the Dharma transmitting phantom image, no jade slips, magical treasures, or the like.</p><p>Not even a simple record remained.  They didn't even know the Dharma name or origin of the saintly monk who transmitted the Dharma.</p><p>The two could only bow to the empty space.</p><p>Having received the true transmission, there was no need to stay in the pagoda. They could return and slowly comprehend it.</p><p>Before leaving, Venerable Zhenru hesitated, then tentatively asked, "Dare I ask, Daoist Priest, is the 'Seven Teacher Buddha Seal' you cultivate transmissible?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, having already anticipated this question.</p><p>The 'Seven Teacher Buddha Seal' was deeply connected to the Great Vajra Wheel Seal. Regardless of whether it would help in comprehending the Sun Wheel Seal, Venerable Zhenru would certainly want to obtain it.</p><p>Unfortunately, this seal was extraordinary; it was a true Nine Luminous Seal, and in Qin Sang's view, extremely valuable.</p><p>Perhaps he would agree if Mirror Stage Temple offered a spirit treasure in exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "Every few years, this poor Daoist will visit the esteemed monks to discuss the Dharma, how about that?"</p><p>Disappointment flickered in Venerable Zhenru's eyes. Qin Sang's words indicated his stance; he wouldn't easily transmit it.</p><p>What treasure could Mirror Stage Temple offer to move him?</p><p>Venerable Zhenru mentally reviewed their treasury several times, then sighed and pressed his palms together, "In that case, we'll trouble Daoist Priest."</p><p>He was still indebted to Qin Sang.  Qin Sang using the 'Seven Teacher Buddha Seal' to comprehend the Sun Wheel Seal and sharing his insights with them was beneficial to Mirror Stage Temple.</p><p>"The Buddhist principles of the Sun Wheel Seal are profound. This poor Daoist also wishes to seek guidance on Buddhist Dharma from the esteemed monks of your temple."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the gesture with a smile.</p><p>Mutual benefit.  Discussing the Dao would also be advantageous for him.</p><p>During his time in the Central Continent of the Storm Realm, he had studied Buddhist scriptures.  Now that he thought about it, the doctrines within were quite different from the Vajra lineage.</p><p>Different Buddhist Dharma meant different Daoist lineages.</p><p>Mirror Stage Temple, being from the Vajra lineage, could surely offer him some enlightenment.</p><p>As they spoke, the two exited the Vajra Stupa.  Outside, the sky was bright. Venerable Zhenru said, "This poor monk plans to close the temple and mountain, and move my disciples inland. Once a location is chosen, I will inform Daoist Priest."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang asked in surprise, "I observe that the Dao Court hasn't made any moves yet. Is the situation truly this dangerous?"</p><p>"There are always signs before great wars. The Calamity of the Demonic Gods was a clear omen.  There will be another upheaval in the future.  In the past, only true disciples were moved to preserve the lineage, but this poor monk has a premonition that this time, the severity will far surpass the past.  Our temple has no external support and is situated in a precarious position. We can only escape to avoid disaster," Venerable Zhenru sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  The Buddhist sects in this realm were weak. It was precisely this cautiousness that allowed Mirror Stage Temple to survive until now.</p><p>Returning to the temple, Qin Sang stayed for a few more days, meditating and reading scriptures, gaining considerable insights.</p><p>Soon, he bid farewell to Venerable Zhenru and returned to Pot Island, just as Master Lingxu sent a Dao Court emissary with several Yinghua Pills.</p><p>In return, Qin Sang selected another pill recipe from the 'Panhu True Scripture' and asked the emissary to deliver it back.</p><p>With trivial matters settled, Qin Sang didn't linger. He asked familiar Daoist friends to keep an eye out for spiritual materials and precious medicines, then immediately set off north, returning to the Flower Field Cave Abode without incident.</p><p>Back in his cave abode, Qin Sang first contemplated the Sun Wheel Seal, recognizing it as a long-term endeavor, and set it aside, prioritizing cultivation.</p><p>He had already grasped the path of cultivation techniques, and with the aid of the poison cultivation and the Ascension Tribulation lightning, it was time to focus on cultivation and strive for Mid Nascent Soul!</p><p>Summoning the Skyeye Butterfly and feeding her an Yinghua Pill, Qin Sang mentally instructed her to protect him as he entered deep meditation and circulated his Heavenly Cycle.</p><p>...</p><p>Time flowed.</p><p>Unknowingly, over twenty years passed in a flash.</p><p>Twenty years wasn't much for Nascent Soul cultivators. Comprehending a single Daoist art could take that long, and closed-door cultivation for decades or even centuries was common.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's cultivation had made astonishing progress in just twenty years, at a speed unimaginable to ordinary cultivators.</p><p>During these years, Qin Sang returned to Jushan City several times, each visit brief.</p><p>After all, he had too much to do.</p><p>Discussing swordsmanship with True Person Zhijian, Buddhist Dharma with the high monks of Mirror Stage Temple, and refining techniques with Master Qi, constantly perfecting the refining method for his precious armor.</p><p>He also exchanged letters with Master Lingxu and Master Gu.</p><p>Furthermore, as agreed, Qin Sang sought and purchased various rare medicinal ingredients, sending them to the Demonic Country and entrusting them to Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Some were used for constructing the altar, while others aided Mo Xingdao in repairing his puppet body and restoring his cultivation.</p><p>The rest of his time was spent in arduous cultivation.</p><p>Such smooth cultivation was something Qin Sang had never experienced. Previously, he could never have imagined that he could still have such a rapid cultivation speed at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>In the past, despite the difficulties, Qin Sang never gave up. Now, he wouldn't slack off in the slightest.</p><p>...</p><p>It was now the twenty-third year after that great war.</p><p>The cave abode was as quiet as ever.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly, seemingly sensing something, continuously flew around Qin Sang, the electric arcs on her wings casting flickering shadows within the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the meditation cushion, his aura barely perceptible, as if asleep.</p><p>Gradually, the Skyeye Butterfly's wings slowed, finally transforming into a streak of light and merging into Qin Sang's Qi Sea.</p><p>A long period of silence followed.</p><p>Until several days later.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A jade bottle on the ground shattered. Flower nectar flew to Qin Sang's lips on its own, and he swallowed it.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's aura began to fluctuate violently, causing the spiritual energy within the cave to surge, creating ripples in the void.</p><p>The ripples were so intense they were visible to the naked eye and affected the area outside the cave.</p><p>The mountain where the cave was located seemed to be shrouded in a layer of shadow.</p><p>This state lasted for several hours.  Fortunately, there was a protective formation; otherwise, the mountain would have been leveled.</p><p>Rumbling sounds echoed throughout the Flower Field space.</p><p>The influence continued to expand. Dark clouds formed above, gathering towards the cave.</p><p>The clouds grew thicker and heavier, as if the sky was about to collapse.</p><p>Soon, muffled thunder emanated from the cave, and the spiritual energy fluctuations intensified sharply.  The Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi began to rotate around the peak, forming a visible spiritual energy vortex.</p><p>The dark clouds descended.</p><p>A black cloud vortex enveloped the peak, rotating faster and faster. The mountains and the earth trembled.</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening boom, like the earth splitting apart, exploded at the center of the vortex. Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi surged madly towards the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang's body was like a bottomless pit, devouring countless amounts of spiritual energy.</p><p>His body trembled slightly as he circulated his cultivation technique with all his might, seizing the opportunity to assault the bottleneck!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Finally, the clouds dispersed, and Qin Sang's momentum crossed a certain threshold, suddenly surging, then the upward trend abruptly stopped, solidifying.</p><p>Mid Nascent Soul!</p><p>The Heavenly and Earthly Yuan Qi gradually calmed.</p><p>Just like Qin Sang's thoughts, gradually becoming tranquil.</p><p>He opened his eyes, a trace of joy lingering within. In just seventy years, both his physical body and True Essence had broken through. Anyone would be ecstatic.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to achieve such progress in such a short time.</p><p>Lightly clenching his fist, Qin Sang felt the powerful strength of his physical body and the vast, surging True Essence flowing within him like a river.</p><p>Based on past experience, Qin Sang had prepared himself for several failed attempts, keeping an eye out for pills that could aid in breakthroughs, and even considered waiting for the Skyeye Butterfly's cultivation to catch up before attempting a full-fledged breakthrough.</p><p>It could only be said that the remnants of the Ascension Tribulation and the comprehension of the cultivation technique's path were indeed extremely beneficial.  He succeeded in his first breakthrough attempt.</p><p>After the initial joy, Qin Sang's thoughts stirred.  He summoned the seven sword phantoms, and they had indeed become somewhat more solid. He knew without testing that the power of the sword formation had certainly increased.</p><p>Then, sensing the Cloud Wanderer Sword in his Nascent Soul, he faintly heard a joyful sword cry, as if celebrating for him.</p><p>This sword was his natal spirit sword, connected to his mind and spirit. This indicated that its spirituality was increasing.</p><p>It wasn't far from birthing a spirit embryo!</p><p>Good news kept coming. Qin Sang had never experienced such a situation.  Even with his mental fortitude, he momentarily doubted whether it was real.</p><p>This realm was truly his blessed land!</p><p>As he collected his stray thoughts and stabilized his cultivation, he continued to activate his cultivation technique, and a sigh escaped his lips. As expected, fortune and misfortune were intertwined.</p><p>The remnants of the Ascension Tribulation were now extremely weak, barely perceptible, and wouldn't last.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was very satisfied that it had supported him until he broke through to Mid Nascent Soul.</p><p>Both the 'Celestial Demon Body Refining' and the 'Nascent Soul Sword Nurturing Chapter' had broken through, his strength leaping forward once more, but Qin Sang wasn't satisfied.</p><p>There wouldn't be a second cultivation treasure land like this. He couldn't waste any time.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly flew out from his dantian, dancing around Qin Sang, excited about his master's breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, raised a finger, and smiled as the Skyeye Butterfly landed on his fingertip.</p><p>His breakthrough had been too fast, and the Skyeye Butterfly had fallen behind. However, with his lifeblood and the Yinghua Pills nourishing her, it shouldn't be long before she broke through as well.</p><p>Although this period was short, it was a comprehensive improvement.</p><p>During the process of refining the Qilin Origin Seed, his divine sense had also been subtly strengthening, though it was mostly constrained.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had also long ago broken through to Late Fourth Transformation, steadily progressing towards Peak Fourth Transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the door and looked around the flower field.  He had to thank the Flower Spirit and the 'Poison God Classic' for his achievements today.</p><p>Finally, his gaze narrowed, focusing on the Flower Field Aperture in the distant mountains.</p><p>He had planned to explore the Aperture after his breakthrough, but he needed to make some preparations first.</p><p>He decided to temporarily postpone his cultivation, give the remaining flower nectar to the Poison Bead to enhance the power of the Poison Dispelling Light Screen, and go out to gather some defensive treasures.</p><p>"Once my cultivation is consolidated, it's time to go back..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, quickly gathering the flower nectar and returning to his cave.</p><p>One year later.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Flower Field space and first checked his markers, discovering that four had been destroyed.</p><p>While cultivating in the cave, he could only sense the nearby markers. Previously, focused on his breakthrough, he hadn't noticed anyone entering.</p><p>The markers had been destroyed before, as people constantly entered and exited the Healing Platform, but it hadn't triggered an anomaly like the last time.</p><p>He wasn't sure if it was experts sent by the Dao Court or the Ghostfang Kingdom, or just people normally exploring the Healing Platform.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang shook his head slightly, deciding to ignore it.  He left the Healing Platform and headed north, venturing deep into the Plagued Wasteland for a long time, hunting two ferocious beasts and experiencing the improvement brought about by his increased cultivation, before returning to Jushan City.</p><p>He first went to the Demonic Country and met with Mo Xingdao.</p><p>"It seems Fellow Daoist's cultivation will soon be restored," Qin Sang observed Mo Xingdao, noticing that he had already recovered to Peak Nascent Soul.</p><p>Mo Xingdao shook his head and sighed softly, "I am doing my best to merge with the puppet body. The greatest difficulty lies ahead.  Whether I can recover to Nascent Soul is still uncertain.  It's difficult for me to leave for a while.  Could Fellow Daoist help me gather information on a few spiritual materials? These materials are extremely rare, and I…"</p><p>He was interrupted by Qin Sang, "Fellow Daoist, if you have any difficulties in the future, please speak frankly.  This poor Daoist also wishes to find the path to ascension as soon as possible."</p><p>Mo Xingdao nodded silently.</p>
