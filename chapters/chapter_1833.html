<h1>Chapter 1824: Sun Moon Divine Deer</h1><p>The palace was vast.</p><p>The hall within was spacious and empty, devoid of any other objects.</p><p>Deep within the palace, there was only a hexagonal stone platform, resembling a well platform, its previous contents unknown.  The Five Elements Crown hovered above it.</p><p>Anyone familiar with the Five Elements Crown would recognize the fierce light as the Great Five Elements Sealing Divine Light!</p><p>At this moment, the Great Five Elements Sealing Divine Light, like a sharp arrow, instantly closed in.</p><p>The Great Five Elements Sealing Divine Light, used correctly, seals; used in reverse, annihilates!</p><p>What was attacking Xiahou was the reversed Five Elements Divine Light.</p><p>Xiahou, having just landed, suddenly found his vision filled with multicolored radiance. A sense of extreme danger assaulted his mind.</p><p>He had deliberately lagged behind the Green Fox Holy King, entering only after confirming there were no anomalies within the palace. Unexpectedly, the reversed Five Elements Divine Light ignored the Green Fox Holy King, heading straight for him.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King had claimed this treasure was not a  Nurtured Spiritual Treasure.  It was unclear how it had birthed a Tool Spirit, perhaps due to the unique environment within the ritual altar. This had resulted in an incomplete and flawed Tool Spirit, incapable of transformation.</p><p>Just now, Xiahou had indeed sensed a consciousness within the crown, but it was extremely chaotic, matching the Green Fox Holy King's description. This chaotic state couldn't be faked.</p><p>Even as the reversed Five Elements Divine Light approached, the consciousness remained chaotic. The Five Elements Crown's attack came without any warning.</p><p>Xiahou's expression changed drastically. He instinctively retreated, but it was too late. Black and white energies surged from his crown, soaring like a raging bull. A black and white vortex formed in an instant, but suddenly froze.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King, at some point, had grasped a silver ring in her hand, palm open, facing Xiahou.</p><p>The silver ring was the very halo that had repeatedly proven its worth in recent battles.</p><p>A silver ray shot towards Xiahou, conjuring a giant halo out of thin air. It ensnared the black and white vortex the very moment it fully formed.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King's timing was impeccable!</p><p>The halo constricted, confining the vortex in place. The clearly defined black and white within the vortex immediately lost its momentum.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Xiahou might not have feared it, but facing a life-or-death crisis, he had no time to counter it.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A golden light shot out from Xiahou's chest.</p><p>The golden light was dazzling. Within it was a bone armor resembling a shield.</p><p>The bone armor was entirely gold, shaped like a tortoise shell, but much thinner, even gossamer-thin.  One could see through it.</p><p>During his fight with Hong Yuzi, Xiahou hadn't used this treasure, harboring some caution. He hadn't anticipated such a sudden attack, and now its deployment seemed somewhat hurried.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The bone armor expanded like a large umbrella, but was immediately struck by the reversed Five Elements Divine Light.  Five-colored radiance instantly engulfed the golden light.</p><p>A series of cracking sounds erupted as the bone armor vibrated, spiderweb cracks appearing on its surface.</p><p>Five-colored radiance pierced through the cracks, converging into a single force that, before Xiahou's horrified gaze, crashed down upon him!</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King watched Xiahou calmly, her eyes revealing surprise at the astonishing power of the reversed Five Elements Divine Light.</p><p>When she had first discovered this place and the Five Elements Crown, she had nearly triggered its attack.</p><p>Every time she recalled it, the Green Fox Holy King couldn't help but feel a lingering fear. If she hadn't been familiar with the Five Elements Crown, having controlled it in turns within the Returning Ruins for many years, and hadn't been cautious enough to stop in time, she might have perished here.</p><p>After decades of being uncontrolled, the restrictions they had placed on the Five Elements Crown had long since expired.</p><p>Aware of the danger, the Green Fox Holy King didn't dare approach it rashly and reluctantly retreated, leading to today's scheme.</p><p>She had used a secret technique to conceal her own aura, relying on her familiarity with the Five Elements Crown. Xiahou, however, was unaware of the intricacies, and upon entering the palace, triggered the reversed Five Elements Divine Light, becoming a pawn in the Green Fox Holy King's plan.</p><p>She glanced at the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Using Xiahou to test the Five Elements Crown confirmed some of her suspicions.</p><p>This divine light wasn't controlled by the Tool Spirit, or rather, it wasn't a conscious attack by the Tool Spirit.</p><p>After arriving in this realm, although the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound was absent, the demonic thoughts, once born, were difficult to eradicate.  The Tool Spirit hadn't yet awakened from its madness and chaos, only instinctively continuing to devour demonic souls.</p><p>Over the past century, the Tool Spirit had gradually devoured demonic souls, its power growing with each consumption.</p><p>This reversed Five Elements Divine Light far surpassed its power when they controlled it.</p><p>If the Tool Spirit had completely devoured the demonic souls and regained its consciousness, the Green Fox Holy King knew she wouldn't be able to subdue it, let alone seize it by force. She might even have to change her plans, first uniting with Xiahou to suppress the Tool Spirit.</p><p>Now it seemed the Tool Spirit hadn't awakened, perhaps struggling to maintain a sliver of clarity within its instincts, leaving behind this protective divine light to attack anyone who dared to approach. After years of brewing, its power was astonishing.</p><p>With the reversed Five Elements Divine Light triggered by Xiahou, the Five Elements Crown returned to normal, the Tool Spirit showing no further movement. It seemed that unless someone posed another threat, it wouldn't actively attack.</p><p>However, based on the Green Fox Holy King's understanding of the Tool Spirit, anyone attempting to control this treasure would first face its backlash. Even retrieving the Five Elements Crown from this place would be far from easy.</p><p>Of course, before retrieving the Five Elements Crown, there was one more thing to do.</p><p>She hadn't brought Xiahou here merely as a pawn.</p><p>Xiahou was her meticulously chosen target!</p><p>â€¦</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>Demonic blood gushed forth.</p><p>Xiahou's entire body shuddered violently, as if struck by a heavy blow. He flew backward, a bloody hole appearing in his chest.</p><p>The reversed Five Elements Divine Light had pierced through the bone armor, striking him directly.</p><p>Xiahou was instantly blasted out of the hall, vomiting blood. A destructive force spread through his body from the wound.</p><p>To make matters worse, the two black dragons rushed out from the palace gate, each spewing a ball of black flame that engulfed Xiahou.</p><p>Simultaneously, Xiahou sensed a sinister aura approaching from his side. From the corner of his eye, he saw the Green Fox Holy King's murderous gaze.</p><p>"Vile wretch! You truly harbored ill intentions!"</p><p>Xiahou roared in fury.</p><p>A cold smile played on the Green Fox Holy King's lips. With a flick of her tail, three of her tails detached, transforming into three streaks of light that lunged at Xiahou.</p><p>First, the Sealing Formation trapped Hong Yuzi, forcing him to expend his lifeblood.</p><p>Then, the solo battle against two black dragons outside the hall depleted his strength.</p><p>Finally, the crippling blow from the reversed Five Elements Divine Light.</p><p>Everything was proceeding according to her plan.  Xiahou's strength, weakened layer by layer, presented a golden opportunity!</p><p>Amidst his furious roar, Xiahou's eyes were bloodshot, radiating a monstrous killing intent. His blood and Qi surged like thunder, his body suddenly swelling as he finally revealed his true form.</p><p>Xiahou, a deer demon who had attained enlightenment, had a true form drastically different from the previous black and white deer phantom. His body was entirely snow-white, divinely handsome, without a single blemish in his fur, save for the bloodstain oozing from the wound on his chest.</p><p>Seeing this, the Green Fox Holy King's delicate brows furrowed slightly.  A strange sense of foreboding washed over her, but she had no choice but to press on!</p><p>The three fox tails transformed into avatars, surrounding Xiahou along with her true form.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King's cultivation was far greater than before, and having plotted for so long, she was now going all out.  The divine ability she was currently wielding was far more potent than in the past.</p><p>As she summoned her avatars, the Green Fox Holy King spat out a green jade bead.  The bead shattered into a cloud of green mist.</p><p>The green mist spread, enveloping the three avatars and Xiahou.</p><p>The next moment, the green mist twisted, revealing strange lines and runes that connected her to the three avatars.</p><p>Suddenly, an astonishing pressure erupted from the green mist, slamming into Xiahou.</p><p>The two black dragons remained focused on Xiahou, becoming the Green Fox Holy King's accomplices.</p><p>Dragon flames billowed.</p><p>Xiahou quickly became disheveled, large patches of his fur scorched black, multiple ghastly wounds appearing on his body.  His counterattacks weakened, leaving only helpless roars.</p><p>Suddenly, the Green Fox Holy King's eyes flashed with a strange light.  The moment her gaze met Xiahou's, it erupted.</p><p>Caught off guard, Xiahou's body stiffened, his eyes glazed over as he sank into a boundless illusion, even forgetting to resist.</p><p>A rare flicker of excitement appeared in the Green Fox Holy King's eyes.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's self-destruction was irrelevant!</p><p>As long as she could control Xiahou, turning him into her puppet, not only would her strength greatly increase, but future actions would also become much easier.  Her true form wouldn't need to rely on the Demon King.</p><p>She had once been a king; how could she be content to submit to another?</p><p>In truth, the Green Fox Holy King quite liked this realm.  With the demon and human races locked in a bitter struggle, there was much she could achieve.</p><p>However, even if she eventually joined the Ghost Fang Kingdom, it wouldn't be until after she had reached the Soul Formation stage.</p><p>Just as the situation seemed completely in her favor...</p><p>Xiahou suddenly twisted his stiff neck, his eyes clearing from their daze.</p><p>His rage vanished, replaced by a mocking expression. "Vile wretch! Do you know why my clan is called the Sun Moon Divine Deer?"</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King's breath hitched, a flush rising on her charming face.  The seductive power in her eyes intensified, but to no avail.</p><p>Xiahou's deer form began to change, the white fur turning black from one side of his body.</p><p>The Sun Moon Divine Deer possessed an innate gift, naturally possessing two forms.</p><p>This was different from having twin souls. Both forms were his true body, possessing identical divine abilities and strength.  There was only one Primordial Spirit, preventing internal conflict or division.</p><p>In their youth, Sun Moon Divine Deer were white deer during the day and transformed into black deer at night.  Apart from the change in appearance, there was nothing special about it.</p><p>Cultivating this divine ability was extremely difficult, but once mastered, the two forms could be switched at will.</p><p>Moreover, during the transformation, not only would expended strength be restored, but injuries sustained in the other form would also be suppressed, and most negative status effects would be dispelled.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King's Charm Technique was among them!</p><p>This meant the Sun Moon Divine Deer clan naturally possessed nearly double the strength!</p><p>Although the two forms couldn't exist simultaneously, and their strength couldn't be combined, how many could withstand two late-stage Nascent Soul Demon Lords fighting in turns?</p><p>Imagine being on the verge of slaying a powerful enemy, only to have their strength suddenly fully restored.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King's expression changed drastically. She took a deep look at Xiahou. "Worthy of being the second Demon Lord under the Demon King. I underestimated you! No wonder you dared to come alone."</p><p>"If I hadn't come alone, would you have dared to bring me to your treasure trove?" Xiahou sneered, his killing intent soaring.</p><p>The white deer was gradually turning into a black deer!</p><p>As he transformed, his wounds visibly healed, his aura surging as his weakened state vanished, his strength steadily returning to its peak.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King took a deep breath.  Decisive by nature, she immediately broke off her Charm Technique, seeing that it was no longer effective. Her jade hand flickered.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The three avatars shattered, their fragments merging into the green mist, making it incredibly dense, almost tangible.</p><p>The thick mist sealed Xiahou and the black dragons within. At the edge of the mist, a giant green ring appeared.</p><p>Xiahou's strength was recovering, but suppressing the two black dragons and breaking through the seal couldn't be accomplished instantly.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King lightly tapped her foot, retreating, not fleeing, but returning to the hall.</p><p>Xiahou saw this and let out a disdainful snort. Since the vixen was so greedy, and hadn't fled yet, he wouldn't mind dealing with her as well.</p><p>As for the crown, it was his!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>Xiahou roared, his body now almost devoid of white fur.</p><p>His black fur shimmered, appearing even more majestic than in his white deer form.</p><p>His jet-black antlers thrust upwards, dense black Qi splitting into two streams, charging towards the relentless black dragons.</p><p>Upon contact, the two streams of black Qi exploded, the black dragons shuddering as they collided with each other.</p><p>The black Qi didn't dissipate, instead converging to form a long rope that tightly bound the black dragons together.</p><p>The two dragons thrashed, the black Qi rope loosening with cracking sounds.</p><p>Xiahou paid them no mind, leaping into the air, his antlers' tips like sharp swords, stabbing fiercely towards the spot where one of the avatars had been.</p><p>At that moment, Xiahou saw the scene within the hall, his pupils contracting sharply.</p><p>Within the palace, ripples spread through the void.</p><p>A faint green light flickered. Where the ripples spread, numerous phantoms appeared.</p><p>The phantoms quickly solidified.</p><p>Most were demonic beasts, with a few in human form.</p><p>Although these demonic beasts couldn't compare to Hong Yuzi's elite troops, they were well-organized, clearly a meticulously trained demon army.</p><p>The demon soldiers surrounded a ritual altar, led by a woman in a green dress with a delicate appearance. This woman's cultivation was astonishingly at the early stage of Hollow Profundity!</p><p>A Demon Lord level Great Demon!</p><p>"Troop Altar!"</p><p>The relaxed expression on Xiahou's face vanished.</p><p>This vixen had actually detonated the ritual altar and escaped with the rebellious troops!</p><p>The ritual altar could accommodate Hollow Profundity demon soldiers.  The one whose altar the vixen had detonated must have been a Hollow Profundity True Person.</p><p>The green-dressed woman led the demon soldiers, forming a formation within the palace, facing the Five Elements Crown. She waved a treasure banner repeatedly.</p><p>The demon soldiers' formation shifted accordingly with great skill.  Combining their power, various talismanic images flashed above their heads.</p><p>Following the demon soldiers' movements, streaks of light shot from the formation towards the well platform.</p><p>As they approached the Five Elements Crown, the streaks of light softened, weaving into a fine net that carefully enveloped the crown, preventing backlash from the Tool Spirit.</p><p>The net was almost complete.</p><p>The demon soldiers clearly hadn't just been summoned. While attacking Xiahou, the Green Fox Holy King had summoned the ritual altar and concealed the demon soldiers' presence, stealthily retrieving the treasure.</p><p>Retrieving the treasure required avoiding any contact with the Five Elements Crown, lest their intentions be exposed and provoke the Tool Spirit's hostility.</p><p>This wasn't easy.  Sweat beaded on the green-dressed woman's forehead. With a soft shout, the demon formation's aura surged, the fine net quickly closing the final gap.  With a pull, it was about to bring the Five Elements Crown back.</p><p>The Green Fox Holy King retreated towards the demon formation, regret in her eyes.</p><p>This scheme was meant to kill three birds with one stone.</p><p>Gain a puppet, subdue Xiahou, and obtain the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Unfortunately, she had miscalculated both Mo Xingdao and Xiahou, resulting in two failures.</p><p>However, the Green Fox Holy King never forgot her true goal.  Even when the situation seemed favorable, she hadn't become complacent.</p><p>As long as she could obtain the Five Elements Crown and master this treasure, the previous failures would mean nothing. With her intellect, she would eventually succeed.</p><p>Little did she know, she had miscalculated one more person.</p><p>Someone she thought she would never see again!</p><p>A fierce wind howled, suddenly rushing into the palace.</p><p>Four phantom snakes, claws bared, lunged straight towards the green-dressed woman.</p><p>Within the biting wind, a black line of raging fire appeared!
