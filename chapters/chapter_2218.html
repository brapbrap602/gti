<h1>Chapter 2208: The Boundary Wall</h1><p>Qin Sang returned to the vicinity of the mountain fragment and saw Liuli meditating on a floating rock.</p><p>By this time, this wave of the beast tide was nearing its end.  From a distance, Qin Sang sensed the battlefield's aura; the defense line was incredibly strong, holding the tide firmly at bay, preventing it from advancing a single step.</p><p>"Daoist Qin!"</p><p>Liuli slowly opened her eyes. Seeing Qin Sang, she felt slightly relieved and anxiously asked, "Why did Lord Hongtian seek you?"</p><p>Qin Sang explained the situation, causing Liuli to fall silent.</p><p>At this moment, the beast tide was completely eliminated.  The Yuanxiang clan leader and Ji Xia, having received Qin Sang's message, flew over.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader examined Qin Sang, asking, "Lord Hongtian didn't make things difficult for you, did he?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "Did the two of you sense anything earlier?"</p><p>"You mean...?"</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader and Ji Xia's expressions tightened, their faces serious. They had indeed sensed something unusual, but they weren't certain.</p><p>Firstly, the battlefield's spiritual energy was chaotic and extremely complex.  Secondly, with Hongtian and King Longjiao suppressing the situation, their perceptions weren't as clear as Qin Sang's.</p><p>"Exactly as you both suspected!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, revealing some of the information he had obtained from Hongtian to the two. "More cultivators will break through to the Saint Realm soon.  A fierce competition is likely to follow. To gain anything, we must plan ahead…"</p><p>He was referring to the upcoming dispute between the Water and Sky Departments. He had already reviewed the list given by Hongtian, and some of the treasures listed were very tempting.</p><p>Obtaining even one would make the journey worthwhile!</p><p>This contest might be the one with the least pressure ever.  Some top experts, like Hongtian, having reached the Saint Realm, will no longer participate.  Furthermore, most of the heterogenous cultivators have been forced out of the sacred land during the recent upheaval.</p><p>In the past, the dispute between the Water and Sky Departments was more like a clash of armies.  In the face of such a grand event, going it alone was impossible. Individuals had to form alliances and follow the prevailing trend. For an outsider like Qin Sang without a strong backing, even qualifying meant extremely slim chances.</p><p>This time, personal strength would play a much larger role, but forging alliances would still be essential.</p><p>"I see!"</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader murmured, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Among the entire heterogenous race, the Yuanxiang clan leader was among the top-ranked cultivators, one of the most likely candidates to break through to the Saint Realm.</p><p>The sacred land's upheaval held unimaginable opportunities. The number of people achieving the Saint Realm this time would far surpass any previous occasion.  Yet, he was not among them, hence his regret.</p><p>Ji Xia was lost in thought.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader, with his strong will, wouldn't dwell on regret for long. He quickly regained his composure and asked, "Did Lord Hongtian reveal how the dispute between the Water and Sky Departments will be conducted?"</p><p>The contest between the two departments was also an opportunity. They missed the last one; they must seize this one!</p><p>"We must wait until the Saint Realm powerhouses gather and discuss it together," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"It seems we must wait a while longer," the Yuanxiang clan leader glanced outward, pondering. "The beast tide shows no sign of stopping.  In this current situation, a direct confrontation between the two departments is unrealistic.  Perhaps it will ultimately come down to the beast tide, or to Heart Lake."</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader's words aligned perfectly with Qin Sang's thoughts. The simplest method would likely involve competing on the number of demonic beasts killed.  Therefore, they couldn't relax; they must kill with all their might!</p><p>If the outcome was decided at Heart Lake, it was hard to predict, leaving them to wait and see.</p><p>"Daoist Qin's injuries?" The Yuanxiang clan leader noticed something unusual about Qin Sang's aura.</p><p>After leaving the Panlong Cave, Qin Sang and Liuli had been rushing, without time to properly heal.</p><p>"It's nothing!" Qin Sang said confidently. He hadn't been fundamentally injured; he had been continuously taking pills and refining the medicinal power, and his injuries were gradually recovering.</p><p>Soon, Liuli made a decision, as expected by Qin Sang – she chose to go with them! However, Liuli was self-aware. Her goal wasn't the 'seed', but the opportunity to transcend tribulation. If that secret realm still existed, she would obtain her opportunity and withdraw immediately, without coveting the 'seed'. The danger should be minimal.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, seizing the time to heal his wounds.</p><p>When the next wave of the beast tide arrived, the four of them flew back to the battlefield.  Seeing Yuan Jian and others, Qin Sang's expression was calm as he nodded in greeting.</p><p>"Daoist Qin is finally back. We can relax a bit. Did you encounter any danger inside?  The clan leader and I were very worried," Yuan Jian said with concern, showing no sign of anything unusual.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern, Elder Yuan. I was lucky and everything went smoothly," Qin Sang replied with a smile, then took a position in the formation as instructed by the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>"That's good. Daoist Qin is blessed by fortune!"</p><p>Yuan Jian nodded, his gaze slightly lowered, looking towards the outside of the formation, though his heart was far from calm, filled with surprise and suspicion.</p><p>Ming swore to kill Qin Sang, but why did he fail?</p><p>No one knows exactly what happened.  Attempts to contact Ming using secret techniques failed completely.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>A massive horde of beasts, black and dense like a tidal wave, surged from the depths of the fog.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew serious as he sensed the beast tide. The power of the demonic beasts within was steadily increasing, far stronger than before.  No wonder everyone, even with the protective array, looked exhausted.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The silken banners rippled slightly, and a blue wave of light erupted from the array's edge, instantly colliding with the beast tide.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The earth shook.</p><p>Shielded by the array, everyone felt a wave of pressure, their bodies trembling violently.</p><p>Through the blue light, they saw the ferocious glare and killing intent in the demonic beasts' eyes.</p><p>Then, seeing the scene beyond the array, everyone's faces brightened. The array alone had repelled the fiercest wave of the beast tide.  Those who were quick-witted already suspected the reason.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others knew the truth: a new powerful cultivator had joined the fight, significantly boosting the array's power.</p><p>The next few waves of beasts would be easier.</p><p>"HA! Take this!"</p><p>A figure burst from the array, charging into the beast tide. It was Yuan Ren, no doubt.</p><p>Most of the cultivators who had been sent to the Heart Lake had safely returned. Yuan Ren, upon his return, immediately joined the battle.</p><p>Everyone worked together, supporting Yuan Ren. Qin Sang and Liuli, as usual, unleashed their thunder and frost magic respectively.  Protected by the array, they no longer had to worry about the shadowy figures; they were usually detected and killed instantly by the array.</p><p>Thunder roared, and snow and wind raged across the battlefield, fiercer than before.</p><p>After a fierce battle, Yuan Ren, pushing forward relentlessly, carved a path through the beasts, scattering them. Then, everyone cleaned the battlefield, eliminating the remaining demonic beasts.  They then rested, awaiting the next wave.</p><p>This cycle repeated for three days, with increasingly powerful waves of beasts, putting everyone under mounting pressure.</p><p>On the fourth day, while battling the tide, Qin Sang sensed an unusual fluctuation. His expression changed, and he noticed the Yuan Xiang clan leader looking at him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had been paying close attention to the outside world – another powerful cultivator was likely emerging!</p><p>He thought of the rumor: upheaval in the Sacred Land, the Yi Ren clan's rise, the sudden emergence of so many powerful cultivators… truly a sign of prosperity.</p><p>Sure enough, when the next wave arrived, the array's power increased again. By now, even those unaware of the truth could guess what was happening.</p><p>A sense of impending change hung in the air as they faced wave after wave of beasts, seemingly endless.  Even worse, killing so many beasts yielded nothing, making the task tedious and monotonous.</p><p>Over ten more days passed, marked by two more surges of heavenly power. If all of them successfully ascended, six powerful cultivators would have emerged from this Sacred Land trial!</p><p>How much longer would they have to wait?</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the hidden realm but saw no need to rush.  Since Hong Tian had not issued any orders, it meant it wasn't yet time to enter.</p><p>Shortly after the sixth powerful cultivator appeared, they repelled another wave of beasts.  Then, Ji Xia, perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, suddenly shuddered.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed, turning to look.</p><p>"The clan leader summoned me," Ji Xia said in surprise, then flew away.</p><p>His action drew everyone's attention.</p><p>"Could that be the Jiao Jiao clan leader?" Yuan Xiang clan leader inquired through voice transmission.</p><p>"Probably…"</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't overjoyed. He was only close friends with Ji Hong, and only acquainted with Ji Xia.</p><p>Regardless, this was definitely good news. If the Jiao Jiao clan leader sent Ji Xia, he would gain another ally. Hong Tian hadn't said he wanted to keep all the 'seeds' for himself; not everyone was an enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang had never considered betraying Hong Tian to join the Jiao Jiao clan leader.  Such indecisiveness was a major taboo. His relationship with the Jiao Jiao clan wasn't strong enough for their leader to favor him.</p><p>With Ji Xia's delayed return, everyone could only suppress their curiosity and face the next wave.</p><p>However, with the growing number of powerful cultivators and the increasing power of the array—a power beyond simple addition—they no longer had to fight the beast tide with all their strength.</p><p>Everyone was within the spirit array, sensing its continuous evolution, its intricacies far beyond their comprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Yuanxiang Clan Chief secretly communicated, speculating that as the array strengthened, fewer people might be needed to guard it.  The Saint Realm powerhouses and the array itself might suffice against the beast tide. They might be reassigned, paving the way for the conflict between the Shui and Tian tribes to begin.</p><p>Being mere mortals, not Saint Realm powerhouses, they couldn't see the bigger picture, only guessing based on limited information.</p><p>As expected, the spirit array underwent successive transformations, the void becoming increasingly stable.  After another ten days, there were no more celestial disturbances, though perhaps the array blocked them.</p><p>No one knew how many Saint Realm powerhouses were currently in the heavens.</p><p>That day, Qin Sang received a message from Hong Tian, his heart tightening. He informed Liuli and the Yuanxiang Clan Chief before swiftly taking flight.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's departure, Yuan Jian's eyes flickered with a dark glint. His intelligence allowed him to easily guess Qin Sang's reason for leaving.  It meant Qin Sang had a powerful patron among the Yi people, no longer a pawn to be manipulated!</p><p>Mid-flight, Hong Tian's voice echoed in Qin Sang's ears, "Go there."</p><p>Hong Tian indicated a direction, which led Qin Sang to a vast, empty sea of mist.</p><p>"Honored Hong Tian," Qin Sang bowed to the void, "I have arrived."</p><p>After a moment, a strange female voice descended from the heavens, "You are Qin Zhenren?"</p><p>The voice was full of authority. Though unseen, it exerted immense pressure.</p><p>"It is I, senior. I pay my respects!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed again, already making guesses.  This must be the person invited by Hong Tian to bestow him with the thunder techniques; he wondered what price Hong Tian had paid.</p><p>"Be careful, I'll only intervene once. If you fail, it's not my fault!" the cold voice warned.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  "Please, allow me to prepare."</p><p>"One hour."</p><p>The voice vanished, the surroundings returning to calm. Qin Sang didn't dare delay, summoning his Thunder Beast Guards and sitting cross-legged before them.</p><p>…</p><p>Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>Stone Pavilion.</p><p>Occasional sounds of a qin filled the air, seemingly casual.</p><p>An old Daoist sipped tea, accompanied by the music, appearing content.</p><p>He and Ning Zhenren said nothing, their gazes fixed on a magic mirror. Ever since the previous image was erased, it had remained clouded, unclear what they hoped to glean from it.</p><p>"After all this time, it seems the Divine Lord's enlightenment has a good chance of success," the old Daoist sighed, his envy evident.</p><p>"He wouldn't attempt a breakthrough without certainty. In terms of composure, who can match the Divine Lord? Only he could guide the Yi people through several eras, maintaining their unity until now," Ning Zhenren admired.</p><p>"Their unity isn't absolute. After all, the entire Yi people benefit from the Divine Lord's enlightenment. Of course, his prestige is unparalleled. Without him, the Yi people would have descended into internal strife like the Wu tribe. His decision to eternally guard this boundary was a monumental act for the Yi people…"</p><p>The old Daoist paused, recalling something. "Right, it's my senior sister's turn to guard the boundary, isn't it?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Ning Zhenren nodded.</p><p>"If my senior sister…"</p><p>Suddenly, the old Daoist's expression changed. He rose abruptly, a sharp glint in his eyes.</p><p>Ning Zhenren also stood, gazing outside, her expression serious.</p><p>Both looked towards the direction of the Evil River.</p><p>"Humph!"</p><p>The old Daoist snorted, "This boundary has been peaceful for tens of thousands of years. Those demonic brats are stirring again, trying to cause trouble while the Divine Lord is in enlightenment.  They're well-informed!"</p><p>He set down his teacup, flicking out several beams of green light towards the sky. Then, he bowed to Ning Zhenren.  "I don't know the Divine Lord's plans, but if the demonic forces breach this boundary and disturb the East Sea, the consequences will be dire. I’ll go and take a look, and then I will take my leave, senior sister.”</p><p>"I'll go with you," Ning Zhenren gently waved her sleeve, putting away her qin on the table, speaking calmly.</p><p>The old Daoist rejoiced, "Thank you, senior sister. With you, we'll surely succeed!"</p><p>Immediately, the two flew out of the pavilion, their figures fading in mid-air, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Their actions went unnoticed, even by the disciples guarding the mountain array of Purple Cloud Mountain.</p>
