<h1>#### Chapter 1416: Tombstone</h1><p>'Boom! Boom!'</p><p>Sword after sword, each thrust landing in a different spot.</p><p>The Nascent Soul talisman puppet gave no warning; the Chaotic Devil Old Man hadn't entered yet.</p><p>Qin Sang acted without reservation, unleashing his full power.</p><p>The purple mist in the medicine garden churned, and strange phenomena manifested frequently.</p><p>Finally, the purple mist before Qin Sang slowly parted to both sides, revealing a faint golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his spiritual sword and narrowed his eyes, discovering that the golden light was a pagoda-shaped light barrier, inside which was actually a spiritual tree!</p><p>The light barrier served as protection, but it had become very dim from the impact of the Scarlet Flame aura. Breaking the barrier to retrieve the fruit wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>The spiritual tree was rooted in a jade altar. The protective power originated from the jade altar. The tree itself was tall enough to be three men high, but it resembled a withered tree.</p><p>The bark was dry, revealing a charcoal-like color.</p><p>A few sparse leaves hung on the branches, all listless and gray. Only at the very top of the branches could one see a precious hint of green, indicating that this spiritual tree was still stubbornly alive.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, a look of joy appearing in his eyes.</p><p>Such a withered spiritual tree had actually grown quite a few fruits!</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that Valley Master Mu had said that the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree needed a long time to nurture Myriad Spirit Fruits, and they were scarce in number.</p><p>Spiritual insects directly consuming Myriad Spirit Fruits shouldn't be done with too many at once. Spiritual insects below the fourth transformation could only take one fruit. After breaking through to the fourth transformation, they could eat another one after digesting the medicinal power.</p><p>There were actually as many as nine fruits on the tree!</p><p>Moreover, they were all ripe.</p><p>However, the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree had been scorched by Scarlet Flames and was on the verge of withering, so the Myriad Spirit Fruits also appeared to lack luster.</p><p>"The three spiritual insects only need four at the moment, which is more than enough. There are still more than half left."</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected such a great harvest and was overjoyed.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he waved his sword to break open the dim light barrier, took out nine jade boxes, and carefully plucked all the Myriad Spirit Fruits, gently patting his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>"I didn't expect it to be so smooth. The Pure Sea Sect's medicine garden shouldn't only have Myriad Spirit Fruit Trees, right? Since I'm here, I might as well explore everything and see if there are any survivors..."</p><p>Qin Sang was just about to go elsewhere when he suddenly stopped, sizing up the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree and calculating whether he could dig up the spiritual tree as well.</p><p>Myriad Spirit Fruits could enhance spiritual insects and refine Spirit Calming Incense (Tranquilizing Spirit Incense), and might have other uses as well.</p><p>He could transplant it back to Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Even if he couldn't use it himself, it could serve as a treasure to protect the sect.</p><p>However, the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree was on the verge of withering and was very fragile. Digging up the spiritual tree was different from plucking the spiritual fruits. He would have to destroy the entire jade altar. If he forcibly broke it, Qin Sang worried that it would cause the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree to die directly.</p><p>He didn't have time to comprehend the method to break the restriction here.</p><p>"Forget it! Leaving it here is also leaving it in the hands of others. Moreover, the discoveries I just made always give me an ominous feeling. I'm afraid the Pure Sea Sect won't last long."</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind, stared at the jade altar for a moment, waved his hand to control the demonic flames, and plunged down, surrounding the jade altar and burning fiercely.</p><p>'Crack...'</p><p>Qin Sang's hand seals changed continuously, and the golden light teetered on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Cracks were burned into the jade altar.</p><p>Just then, an astonishing scene appeared. Without any warning, flames suddenly surged from the roots of the spiritual tree, engulfing the entire tree in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He controlled his sword and slashed down, fiercely stabbing into the broken jade altar, forcibly digging out a section of the tree root.</p><p>Fortunately, the tree root that Qin Sang snatched still retained some vitality. If he took care of it carefully after going out, he might be able to cultivate it to life.</p><p>He looked regretfully at the spiritual tree that had been burned to ashes, and his gaze swept over the shattered jade altar, lost in thought.</p><p>Just now, when destroying the jade altar, Qin Sang's feelings were clearer. The affected range didn't seem to be as simple as just the jade altar.</p><p>Without time to think too much, Qin Sang cast a restriction to seal the tree root and placed it in a jade box that could preserve its vitality. He withdrew and began searching everywhere.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang found another intact medicine field.</p><p>Although the spiritual herbs here were old, they weren't as precious as expected.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. It seemed that whether a medicine field survived depended on luck. The purple mist restriction nearby was still relatively intact and had been impacted less, so it was able to be preserved.</p><p>He wouldn't waste his time on these spiritual herbs, moving quickly, breaking through layers of restrictions, and traversing between medicine fields. Finally, he made another new discovery!</p><p>"Spirit Lamp Flower! Thunder Snake Vine..."</p><p>Qin Sang's figure suddenly stopped, looking at the intact medicine field ahead and the spiritual light shining within, a flash of brilliance passing through his eyes.</p><p>These spiritual herbs in front of him were protected and cultivated with various restrictions. Although they were as withered as the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree, some of them had survived.</p><p>Some Nascent Soul cultivators would also be tempted and unwilling to miss them.</p><p>Qin Sang's attention was attracted by a spiritual flower shaped like a jade lamp, the size of a baby's fist. He remembered that the Spirit Lamp Flower, when refined into Concealing Fragrance Pills, could strengthen one's spiritual sense. It also had a certain effect on the Nascent Soul and was a rare spiritual herb.</p><p>He wasn't far from breaking through the second level of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. Taking Concealing Fragrance Pills would definitely speed up the process.</p><p>The other spiritual herbs each had their own uses. For Qin Sang, they weren't as important as the Spirit Lamp Flower, but other Nascent Souls should be tempted.</p><p>If he plundered all these spiritual herbs, even if he left directly, the trip wouldn't be in vain.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over these spiritual herbs one by one, marveling at the wealth of the Pure Sea Sect, when his eyes suddenly froze, staring intently at the depths of the medicine field.</p><p>There were several gaps there.</p><p>Judging from the traces, they weren't from spiritual herbs withering, but rather from being dug away.</p><p>"That's not right!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p>These traces weren't ancient. They seemed to be recent remnants.</p><p>Someone had gotten ahead of him and dug away some of the spiritual herbs!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind suddenly tensed. Demonic flames flew out of his sleeves, surrounding his body. His spiritual sense suddenly spread out, and the Heaven's Eye Divine Ability of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly was also activated to the extreme.</p><p>"Someone has already entered and dug away the most precious spiritual herbs. Is it Valley Master Mu or the Chaotic Devil Old Man? Why didn't I discover any signs before? Where is he now? Has he discovered me?"</p><p>Countless thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Just then, he suddenly sensed a warning from the Nascent Soul talisman puppet outside.</p><p>With the help of the puppet, Qin Sang 'saw' that there were violent fluctuations in the sky above the Pure Sea Sect, followed by a violent explosion. As the flowing fire became chaotic, a gap opened in the spiritual array.</p><p>The Chaotic Devil Old Man and the Ring-Holding True Person flew out first, their figures appearing slightly disheveled.</p><p>Behind them, there seemed to be other figures.</p><p>The purple flowing fire in the sky was impacted and became extremely chaotic, temporarily obscuring the line of sight.</p><p>"It's not the Chaotic Devil Old Man!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart relaxed slightly, but his doubts deepened. Could it be that Valley Master Mu had stolen a march on him? But why didn't he look for the Myriad Spirit Fruit?</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Nascent Soul talisman puppet to hide and continued to spy.</p><p>He himself took a deep look at the medicine field, didn't try to take away the spiritual herbs, maintained his vigilance, concealed his aura, and sneaked into the depths of the purple mist.</p><p>He didn't know how far he had walked.</p><p>The purple mist suddenly dissipated, and the view before him suddenly widened. A mountain wall came into view, and between the stone wall and Qin Sang, there was a range of undulating hills.</p><p>He saw at a glance that on the empty hills, a tombstone stood alone.</p><p>Inscribed upon it:</p><p>'Grave of Younger Brother, Tan Jie.'</p>
