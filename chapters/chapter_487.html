<h1>Chapter 480: The Serpent Matriarch's Praise</h1><p>Qin Sang, having captured Huang Jia Ren, fell to the ground. His skin was pale from blood loss, but he'd prepared pills beforehand, and after taking one, his recovery was much faster.</p><p>The black flames dissipated.</p><p>Beneath the sea of fire, four dark figures lurked—top-tier煞尸 (corpse puppets) created from late Foundation Establishment corpses.</p><p>This was one of Qin Sang's contingency plans.  If he lost control of his magical treasures, he wouldn't hesitate to use the Xuantian Thunder, even at the cost of these few corpse puppets, to prevent Huang Jia Ren from escaping.</p><p>Qin Sang laid Huang Jia Ren on the ground.  He saw that his soul was severely injured by the Nine Nether Demon Flame.  There was no time for anything else; he had to quickly heal him, then use a Heavenly Corpse Talisman to seal Huang Jia Ren's soul before storing him in the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang wouldn't be reckless. He decided to wait until he broke through to the False Core realm before attempting anything further.</p><p>Including Yu Hua, that makes two living corpses.  Even if things go badly, at least one should succeed.</p><p>Qin Sang acted quickly, saving Huang Jia Ren's storage pouch.  There were no treasures like the Xuantian Thunder to delight Qin Sang, but the pouch still contained a significant amount of wealth.</p><p>There was also a pouch containing starstones.  It only held a shallow layer, roughly a hundred, by Qin Sang's estimate.</p><p>Qin Sang held the pouch, lost in thought.</p><p>Among the sixty-six people who entered the Zhī Tiān Peak, Huang Jia Ren was among the strongest.  Even diligently collecting starstones with the Spirit-Locking Bracelet, he only gathered this small amount.</p><p>Qin Sang already had over three hundred in his own pouch. With these added, he now had almost four times the amount.</p><p>The Zhī Tiān Peak is vast, and everyone was scattered.</p><p>Those people didn't have the strength of Old Lady Jing, easily seeing through the weaknesses in the restrictions and moving freely in and out of dangerous areas.  Even with the best luck, they'd be lucky to find two, and might not even win the fight.</p><p>"This should be enough; more would be excessive,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang proceeded cautiously, only casually collecting some starstones along the way, bringing his total to around five hundred. By the time he left the canyon, it would almost be time.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, moving away from the canyon to find a clear space.  He looked up at the sky, where the chaotic suction force was like a series of raging winds overhead.</p><p>In a moment, these winds strangely stopped, as if time had frozen.</p><p>Now!</p><p>This change was extremely brief. Once missed, there would be no way to leave Zhī Tiān Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately summoned his Cold Gold Sword, merging with it and flying towards the sky with maximum speed.</p><p>At that moment, dozens of differently colored escaping lights erupted from Zhī Tiān Peak like fireworks, from the top to the bottom of the mountain, all vying to reach the sky.</p><p>The winds began to reverse, becoming a suction force from above.</p><p>Having experienced this upon entry, Qin Sang expertly navigated the chaotic suction, maintaining his sword light.  Soon, he saw endless white light ahead, as if a huge hole had appeared in the sky.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Bursting into the white light, all the chaos disappeared.</p><p>His vision was filled with blinding white light, then returned to normal.  A boundless expanse of water met his eyes.</p><p>The gentle sound of waves reached his ears, gradually calming his tense nerves.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could regain his footing, a gust of wind came from behind. He quickly dodged, and saw a high-level cultivator from the Yù Líng Sect, who had also just escaped Zhī Tiān Peak.</p><p>The two nodded at each other and flew towards their respective groups.</p><p>The Serpent Matriarch and Deputy Island Master Xiao were still waiting.</p><p>Almost twenty people had already emerged, standing neatly behind the two island masters.  Brother Rong was among them.  He seemed worried, his brow furrowed, his expression serious.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Brother Rong smiled slightly and nodded.</p><p>As Qin Sang walked, he surveyed the area, surprised to see so many survivors.</p><p>But on second thought, it made sense. Everyone who entered Zhī Tiān Peak was a top-level expert. Unless they were incredibly unlucky, survival should be relatively easy.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt his waist lighten—the pouch containing the starstones had been taken by Old Lady Jing.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>The Serpent Matriarch weighed the pouch in her hand, glancing unexpectedly at Qin Sang, nodding slightly: "I remember you're a disciple of Lesser Hua Mountain, aren't you?  Well done!"</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>In an instant, all eyes fell on Qin Sang.  Of all those present, he was the only one praised by the Serpent Matriarch.</p><p>The Serpent Matriarch tossed the pouch into the air, lightly tapping it. The pouch opened, and the starstones flowed out.</p><p>One hundred, two hundred…</p><p>One after another, the starstones gleamed like crystals in the sunlight.  They seemed to flow endlessly from Qin Sang's pocket.</p><p>This attracted the attention not only of the Xiaohan Domain cultivators, but also those from the Tianxing League.</p><p>The cultivators present showed various expressions. Their gazes shifted between Qin Sang and his pocket – shock, envy, apprehension…</p><p>Qin Sang stood silently before Shepo, his expression calm and impassive.  His mind, however, was elsewhere.</p><p>Of the twenty, Ji Wu was missing!</p><p>If Ji Wu had perished on the Finger Heaven Peak, it would be a fortunate outcome. But it was too early to conclude; more cultivators were still emerging.</p><p>Finally, his pocket emptied.</p><p>Over five hundred starstones formed a small pile, their sheer number captivating and mesmerizing.</p><p>The golden-armored general from the Tianxing League's eyes darkened, and he glared at Qin Sang.  Qin Sang felt a blow, his face paling, his heart skipping a beat.</p><p>What a terrifying gaze! What an intimidating aura!</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly shocked. Fortunately, Shepo intervened.  Smiling, she raised her snake staff, shielding Qin Sang from the general's glare.</p><p>“What? Are the Tianxing League’s underlings unwilling to accept defeat and resort to bullying the weak?”</p><p>Shepo scoffed.</p><p>“Who won and who lost is yet to be determined!”</p><p>The golden-armored general retorted coldly, ignoring Shepo's sarcasm and turning his gaze back to the exit of Finger Heaven Peak. He waited.</p><p>Shepo looked at Qin Sang, her tone gentle.  “Among those who emerged, you’ve collected the most starstones.  Few in the history of these contests have surpassed you.  A worthy disciple of Shao Hua Mountain indeed.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed. “Senior, you flatter me. I was simply lucky to encounter a large cluster of loose starstones…”</p><p>Whether Shepo believed him or not remained unclear, but she didn’t press further, her gaze fixed on the entrance of Finger Heaven Peak as she waited.</p><p>As time passed, the beam of light started to shrink, becoming thinner and thinner, and the mirrored surface at its end changed accordingly.</p><p>The beam vanished completely. Finger Heaven Peak sealed itself, disappearing once more.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around.  Including himself, twenty-eight cultivators from the Xiaohan Domain had emerged, with only five missing.  The Tianxing League had twenty-seven.</p>
