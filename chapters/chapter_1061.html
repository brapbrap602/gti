<h1>Chapter 1553: Gathering of Forces</h1><p>Chapter 1553: Gathering of Forces</p><p>Facing Ning Wuhuai, Qin Sang felt a pressure unlike any he had experienced before. This surprised him.  He had faced formidable opponents like Xuefu and Xiaoyun Daochang, yet never felt this kind of pressure. Qin Sang was confident in his own strength; only facing a Yuan Ying ancestor had ever caused him such unease.</p><p>Qin Sang mused that Ning Wuhuai's sudden change might be due to some incredible opportunity he gained during the trials. That would explain it.  No wonder he didn't compete for the Soul Cleansing Liquid!  It seemed the trial grounds held many unknown secrets, a treasure left by human ancestors for their descendants.</p><p>"It's good to see you're unharmed, Daoist Ning.  I waited a long time and worried you might be trapped by the Thousand Mountain Array or encountered some mishap. I didn't know what to do," Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai quickly explained, "I didn't expect my sect to require all disciples to travel together. I didn't have a chance to tell you. I participated in the trials to obtain a certain spirit herb that grows there, and unexpectedly, it took so much longer than I anticipated…"</p><p>"Did you find it?" Qin Sang asked with concern.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai nodded, his tone light, "Though I encountered many setbacks, I finally harvested a mature herb.  Then, I spent time refining it, hence the delay."</p><p>From Ning Wuhuai's tone, that herb seemed even more precious than the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  The changes in him were likely related to the herb.  Qin Sang was curious, but seeing Ning Wuhuai's reluctance to elaborate, he didn't press further.</p><p>"It's getting late. If you have no other pressing matters, Daoist Qin, let's set off," Ning Wuhuai said, not asking if Qin Sang had obtained the Soul Cleansing Liquid, turning his head towards the inner sanctum.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. His only goals were to see Elder Qingzhu and find the ancient teleportation array; nothing else mattered.</p><p>After a brief rest, they flew down the mountain and continued deeper into the inner sanctum, Ning Wuhuai leading the way. Qin Sang followed, his expression growing grave.  Initially, he hadn't noticed, but as they ventured further, the inner sanctum's space became increasingly unstable.  They soon encountered a spatial rift.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai mentioned the presence of moving and invisible spatial rifts within.  Remnants of ancient celestial prohibitions appeared more frequently, many unexplored.  It wasn't a matter of unwillingness, but inability.  Even from a distance, Qin Sang could sense the danger these prohibitions posed.</p><p>Previous generations had charted paths deeper into the sanctum, but these were only relatively safe, requiring quick thinking and constant vigilance.  Carelessness was fatal; venturing in unprepared was suicidal. These paths led to different directions, and Ning Wuhuai chose one that required a large detour.</p><p>They were now traveling on foot, as flight was too risky given the unstable space, though spatial rifts were less common here.</p><p>"Chirp chirp…"</p><p>Strange sounds came from a nearby mountain.</p><p>'Whoosh…'</p><p>A shadow rose from the mountaintop.  Strange, large birds took flight, circling their territory, scouting for enemies.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ning Wuhuai hid in the shadow of a large rock, holding their breath.  They waited until the birds passed overhead before cautiously moving on.</p><p>This wasn't their first such encounter.  It wasn't that they couldn't defeat the birds, but that attracting them in the inner sanctum could trigger a chain reaction, drawing stronger beasts.  Even Yuan Ying ancestors acted the same way.</p><p>"Squawk!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up to see a lone bird, unseen until now, suddenly appearing and discovering them.  It alerted its companions.  The bird flock stirred.</p><p>Instantly, Qin Sang felt countless hostile gazes upon him.  He knew it was bad and immediately summoned his Ebony Sword. Simultaneously, a light flashed from his back as he activated the Sky Demon Transformation.  Ning Wuhuai reacted just as quickly.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>A crimson-gold spirit sword and the Ebony Sword struck at the bird.  The bird flapped its wings to dodge, but to no avail. Qin Sang's sword light struck, killing it.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his true essence, flinging the bird's corpse far away.  Then, with a flash of light, he and Ning Wuhuai fled.</p><p>The bird flock, having lost its target, shrieked in anger, but the scent of blood drew them to devour their fallen comrade.</p><p>Once they had shaken off the birds, they landed on the ground, putting away their protective light.</p><p>"The inner sanctum is truly perilous at every step," Qin Sang sighed, aware that their destination was still far away.</p><p>He kept his celestial demon transformation active, leaving his phoenix wings extended, to be prepared for any unforeseen event.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Ning Wuhuai beside her.  She herself had only activated the celestial demon transformation, yet her speed was unmatched by cultivators of the same level.  Ning Wuhuai, however, effortlessly kept pace.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai was also covertly studying Qin Sang's wings. The phoenix wings were too eye-catching, extraordinarily beautiful, and only close observation revealed their illusory nature.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, Daoist friend not only possesses unparalleled swordsmanship but also such profound evasion techniques!"</p><p>Ning Wuhuai exclaimed in admiration, mistaking the phoenix wings for some kind of advanced evasion technique.</p><p>Qin Sang retorted, "Daoist friend is the truly unfathomable one, handling everything with ease."</p><p>Ning Wuhuai smiled faintly and said frankly, "Before today, I was not your equal."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was surprised.  Ning Wuhuai had clearly received a great opportunity within the trial realm.</p><p>The two continued their conversation as they walked.</p><p>The journey was perilous, needless to say. The terrain wasn't entirely mountainous; they even encountered a golden palace complex, but it was sealed by a powerful formation, preventing entry.</p><p>"We've been walking for so long, why haven't we found any trace of the Yuan Ying Grandmaster?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked curiously. The Yuan Ying Grandmaster had entered before them, yet left no trace whatsoever.</p><p>"The Dark Valley is the deepest area currently explorable, with many paths leading to it. I chose the most winding one; almost all the accessible restrictions along the way have been bypassed. It's essentially an abandoned route. The Yuan Ying Grandmaster wouldn't need to be as cautious as we are and rarely chooses this path…"</p><p>Pausing, Ning Wuhuai continued, "Forcing low-level cultivators to go first as sacrifices to test the power of ancient restrictions is common practice in the cultivation world. Those devilish Grandmasters especially, wouldn't mind having a couple of extra puppets. To avoid the Yuan Ying, I carefully selected this route."</p><p>Their destination was the Dark Valley!</p><p>As they spoke, they both suddenly stopped.  Before them, the flat terrain ended, replaced by a dark forest.</p><p>Ancient trees towered in the forest, reaching thousands of feet high, their crowns intertwining, creating an overwhelmingly dense canopy, yet offering no sense of life.</p><p>The forest was long dead, all vegetation petrified, perfectly preserved through countless years, transformed into a gloomy stone forest.</p>
