<h1>Chapter 1339: The Blood Altar</h1><p>Qin Sang flew out of the inner hall and saw the demonic cave they had passed through when they entered. The earth was torn apart, and the demonic cave was not spared. The entrance had split open into a massive gap, with countless rocks tumbling inside. The cave seemed like a bottomless pit, swallowing so many stones without showing any sign of being filled. However, the interior of the cave was anything but calm; the space within was extremely unstable.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the disturbances caused by the anomalies in the Purple Micro Palace's inner hall had traveled through the demonic cave to the Sin God Palace. If this continued, not only would the demonic cave be destroyed, but the Sin God Palace might also follow the fate of the outer hall. The scope of the anomaly's influence was too vast.</p><p>Fortunately, the Purple Micro Palace had more than one exit. Even if the demonic cave were to collapse, they could still leave through the outer hall and avoid being trapped here. Qin Sang landed on the ground, already feeling the unique, bone-chilling cold of the ghost mist. The surrounding mist was thin, but it grew denser the further one went. However, an endless stream of ghost mist was spreading outward.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how much ghost mist had accumulated in the Immortal's Tomb before this eruption, and the extent of its influence was staggering. The tomb was also home to countless malevolent spirits and ghostly creatures. For some reason, these spirits and creatures usually did not leave the confines of the tomb. Even powerful entities like Corpse Kings and Ghost Kings would only attack when living beings intruded into the tomb.</p><p>Other Corpse Kings and Ghost Kings did not possess the Corpse Talisman within them, and their movements were unpredictable. No one knew how many such beings had been born over countless years. At this moment, the malevolent spirits and ghostly creatures were also surging out of the tomb alongside the ghost mist. The howls of ghosts rose and fell, accompanied by gusts of yin wind and the chaotic presence of countless spirits, sending shivers down one's spine.</p><p>The outer hall had turned into a ghostly realm, a scene of utter chaos. This should have been the location where they had sent their signal, as the talisman sword had pointed here before stopping. Qin Sang had arrived too late, and there was no sign of anyone else around. He had no idea what had happened earlier, and the talisman sword had also lost its connection. For the moment, he couldn't determine the location of his senior sister and the others, so he dared not act rashly. Instead, he focused his gaze into the depths of the ghost mist.</p><p>The mist was thick. Apart from the Immortal's Tomb, there were several other forbidden areas in the outer hall, all of which were now covered by the ghost mist. The only thing that stood out was a faint blood-red glow deep within the mist, visible even from where Qin Sang stood. Due to the distance and the obstruction of the mist, the outline of the glow was not large.</p><p>"That should be the Blood Altar," Qin Sang recalled. After leaving the Immortal's Tomb, one would immediately see a massive Blood Altar. The altar was enormous, shaped like a giant pyramid, surrounded by a crimson aura of blood and slaughter. This aura was intertwined with countless terrifying ancient restrictions, making it clear that this was no ordinary place. Even Nascent Soul cultivators, who would brave the Heavenly Mountain in the inner hall, would avoid provoking the Blood Altar. Thus, the Blood Altar had stood in the outer hall for many years, and few had ever dared to disturb it.</p><p>Around the Blood Altar, the bloodthirsty aura was so dense it seemed to drip with blood. But in Qin Sang's memory, it had never been this bright before, to the point where even the ghost mist couldn't obscure it.</p><p>"Could they all have gone there?" Qin Sang wondered to himself.</p><p>With nothing but the ghost mist visible, Qin Sang could only speculate. Qing Jun, Jing Yu, and Bai were all missing, most likely trapped within the mist. Regardless, he couldn't stand by and do nothing; he had to investigate. The three of them were strong, each with their own means of survival. With so many Nascent Souls working together, it was unlikely they had all been killed by the Old Demon Ye. Besides, the ghost mist was Bai's domain. Within the mist, it was doubtful anyone could capture Bai. Even if Bai couldn't defeat the Old Demon Ye, he could surely escape.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the situation inside had likely reached a stalemate. The Old Demon Ye's motives were intriguing. First, he had released a demon from the Sin God Palace, and now he was at the Blood Altar. Could it be that the Purple Micro Palace also sealed a demon? Qin Sang recalled that the Nine Nether Demonic Flame had been obtained within the Purple Micro Palace. It was entirely possible!</p><p>A single demon had already put Qin Sang on high alert. If there were two demons, it was hard to imagine what the future of the Northern Star Realm's cultivation world would look like. There would be no need to struggle; Qin Sang would retreat to a sanctuary without hesitation.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang finally made a new discovery. Within the ghost mist, there were faint glimmers of light in several places, flickering briefly before disappearing. Without a doubt, these were cultivators wielding magical treasures in battle.</p><p>"No wonder there's been so little movement. They had prepared a spirit formation, with multiple Nascent Souls working together to deal with the Old Demon Ye. It seems my senior sister and the others were forced to separate before they could set up the formation, and now they're fighting individually. The Old Demon Ye's side only has two people. How did he manage this...?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept back and forth, trying to determine the locations of these battlefields. The light from the magical treasures was too faint, appearing and disappearing intermittently, making it impossible to identify who was using them. Qin Sang summoned the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, fully activating his Heavenly Eye ability, but he still couldn't locate the Five Directions Pagoda.</p><p>"Without being able to determine Qing Jun's location, I'll have to choose the one closest to me first, find out what's happening, and then make a decision. Once I enter, Bai should contact me..."</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang no longer hesitated. He urged the Ebony Sword forward and charged into the ghost mist. The Eighteen Demon Banners were hidden in his sleeve. The banners consumed too much energy, and Qin Sang couldn't sustain them for long. He would save them for a critical moment.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang transformed into a streak of sword light, speeding through the ghost mist. Any malevolent spirits or ghostly creatures that dared to block his path were instantly sliced to pieces by his sword.</p><p>Soon, he arrived near the first forbidden area. The ground here was riddled with holes, large and small, all interconnected in an extremely complex network. In the past, if cultivators passing through here failed to conceal their auras, they would provoke a swarm of strange, snake-like creatures that would emerge from the holes to attack intruders. Now, however, these creatures had all vanished, replaced by malevolent spirits and ghostly creatures.</p><p>Qin Sang was fortunate not to encounter any Ghost King-level entities. As he passed through one forbidden area after another, he could see more clearly. The blood-red glow emanating from the Blood Altar grew brighter.</p><p>Just as he was nearing his target, Qin Sang suddenly stopped and sheathed his sword. He frowned, examining the ghost mist ahead. There were no unusual fluctuations, but through his Heavenly Eye ability, he noticed that the flow of the ghost mist here seemed abnormal. After observing for a while, he couldn't discern anything conclusive.</p><p>Time was of the essence, and he couldn't afford to ponder further. With a wave of his hand, he sent out a Nascent Soul puppet to scout the path ahead. Once he confirmed there was no danger, he dashed forward.</p><p>Upon entering this area, Qin Sang found that his vision was even more restricted, and his spiritual sense was suppressed. Without the Heavenly Eye ability, others would likely only be able to see a few meters around them, which explained why they hadn't been able to regroup.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang found his target. Several Nascent Souls were fighting together, besieged by something. Leading them was Daoist Zhenyi!</p><p>As Qin Sang charged in...</p><p>At the Blood Altar.</p><p>Two figures hovered on either side above the altar: the Old Demon Ye and the Jade Bone.</p><p>"Another fool who doesn't know his limits! Hmph, his sword skills seem decent, and he even has a Nascent Soul puppet..." The Jade Bone's eye sockets flickered with ghostly flames, his tone indifferent but laced with disdain. </p>
