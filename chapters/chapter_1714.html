<h1>Chapter 1705: Ominous Shadow</h1><p>Within the dantian.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly enveloped itself with its wings, emitting a faint, luminous glow that resembled a cocoon of light, remaining perfectly still.</p><p>The Earth-Slaying Sword, the poison bead, and other items were removed by Qin Sang.</p><p>Only the nascent soul and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly remained within the dantian.</p><p>The nascent soul spread its arms, extending thin filaments of light from its fingertips, merging them into the luminous glow.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind connected with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, feeling the thoughts of his spirit insect, while simultaneously focusing on performing various hand seals from the *Panhu True Scripture*.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, the witchcraft and incantations within the *Panhu True Scripture* were very strange.  He had studied them repeatedly before, but still felt some stiffness in his execution.</p><p>This was normal; after all, the scripture wasn't part of human lineage. As the Ghost Mother had warned, Qin Sang lacked Witch Clan bloodline, and with increasing cultivation, he needed to guard against the insect’s backlash.</p><p>However, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly showed no sign of turning against him.</p><p>Sensing unprecedented changes in its master, and even a fluctuating connection between them – sometimes clear, sometimes hazy – the Sky-Eyed Butterfly conveyed its unease.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed no malice in this emotion, only closeness and affection.</p><p>Continuously reassuring the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang accelerated his spellcasting.</p><p>Refining his spirit insect using the *Panhu True Scripture* was inherently perilous, but due to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's complete dependence on him, everything remained under Qin Sang's control.</p><p>The cave abode was silent.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation for an unknown length of time, his body, like the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, emanating a brilliant light that automatically converged within his dantian.</p><p>At this moment, he appeared to be holding a sphere of light, his energy and that of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly intermingling within it.  Within the sphere, countless scenes unfolded, sometimes vast mountains, sometimes changing seas and lands, all exhibiting an ancient aura.</p><p>Amidst these various phenomena, only one butterfly shadow persisted; it flew continuously, traversing mountains and rivers, tireless, with no end in sight.</p><p>Initially, the butterfly shadow was very blurry.</p><p>As a rumbling sound resonated within Qin Sang, his blood surging like thunder, blood vessels extended into the illusion, touching the butterfly shadow.  The shadow became increasingly clear, mirroring the Sky-Eyed Butterfly perfectly, as if it were condensing into a true entity.</p><p>As the butterfly shadow solidified, Qin Sang's throat trembled, and he emitted a deep, strange sound.  The illusion suddenly dissipated, leaving only the butterfly shadow, which, with a flutter of its wings, plunged into Qin Sang's dantian.</p><p>Within the dantian.</p><p>The butterfly shadow flew straight towards the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The two spirit butterflies, identical in appearance, perfectly overlapped and merged into one.</p><p>The fused Sky-Eyed Butterfly trembled, then quickly calmed down, its breath stabilizing as it entered a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang, eyes closed, focused on his dantian, feeling the changes between himself and the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.  The Ghost Mother’s true inheritance from the Witch sect was indeed effective and immediate.</p><p>The feeling of bloodline fusion between them became clearer, and he felt an inexplicably stronger, inseparable connection.  The benefits were foreseeable: in the future, if the Sky-Eyed Butterfly encountered problems or bottlenecks in its cultivation, he could achieve unity of mind with it, providing assistance in finding breakthroughs, rather than being helpless as before.</p><p>As his cultivation deepened, and he encountered beneficial elixirs for the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, he could intuitively sense them without wasting time experimenting.</p><p>These were not the greatest advantages. In the future, if the Sky-Eyed Butterfly lagged behind him, he could use the blood refinement techniques and secret medicines described in the scripture to rapidly improve its cultivation.</p><p>"This is a true spirit insect!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, having wasted too much time before obtaining the true method.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly slept within his dantian, adapting to the new changes.</p><p>Without waking the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang emerged from meditation, a thoughtful expression on his face.  Catching sight of the poison bead floating nearby, he suddenly remembered the Gu King.</p><p>The Gu King, sealed by the Ghost Mother, was sleeping in his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>Qin Sang, following the Ghost Mother's instructions, began to refine the poison bead again. Although he had focused on cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, he hadn’t devoted much attention to it. Over the decades, the unconscious guidance of the poison bead’s self-transformation had yielded considerable results.</p><p>"After all these years of nurturing, the most troublesome foundational aspects are almost stable.  From now on, the recovery of my injuries will be faster and faster.  I'll heal while refining the poison bead and then devour the Gu King! Right, I also need to study the methods of refining the Taiji Immortal Platform and the Ice and Fire Talisman."</p><p>Qin Sang considered his next steps.</p><p>His cultivation speed was already quite fast. He could foresee that after the avatar delivered the Four Sacred Gathering Spirit Array, his cultivation would skyrocket, directly facing the Nascent Soul bottleneck.</p><p>However, the spirit fruit needed for breakthrough and the birthless magic seal both required waiting for the right time, and he didn’t know when the ferocious beasts would appear.  He couldn’t afford to be impatient.</p><p>Before proceeding, Qin Sang decided to take care of some pending matters.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang retrieved the inheritance obtained by the Yan Shan Elder from the snowfield tomb and carefully studied it.</p><p>The Ice and Fire Order was difficult due to the large quantity required and their high value. However, by mastering the properties of the Bingyi Divine Plate and the Huoxi beast, the difficulty was actually less than that of the Taiji Immortal Terrace.</p><p>After reviewing the method of refining the Taiji Immortal Terrace, Qin Sang sighed, rubbed his temples, set it aside, and retrieved the refining inheritance of the Wood Phase lineage.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Three more years passed.</p><p>In these three years, Qin Sang read through the Wood Phase inheritance several times. While his progress in refining wasn't significant, he successfully refined the Poison Pearl.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>The sleeping Gu King was summoned.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at his right hand, his fingertip holding a pearl the size of a dragon's eye – the newly refined Poison Pearl.  It felt soft and wasn't yet truly solid.</p><p>With a thought.</p><p>The Poison Pearl suddenly shone, and a seven-colored radiance shot out, striking the void in front of Qin Sang.  It seemed only slightly more solid than before, but it was vastly different from the Antidote Aura.</p><p>This radiance could not only transform into an antidote armor, resisting external poisons, but also transform into poisonous light!</p><p>Antidote and poison, controlled at will.</p><p>The poison in the pearl was the result of Fei Can's years of consuming and transforming various poisons. If Qin Sang cultivated it properly, and Fei Can comprehended the poisonous light, it could become a great aid sooner rather than later. Fortunately, it finally found a master.</p><p>After a brief trial, Qin Sang turned his gaze to the Gu King, throwing the Poison Pearl towards it. The pearl hovered above the Gu King, constantly emitting seven-colored radiance, enveloping it.</p><p>A force seemed to pull the Gu King slowly towards the Poison Pearl.</p><p>Soon, the radiance dissipated, and the Poison Pearl flew back to Qin Sang, rotating slowly.  The Jade Armored Insect inside could be clearly seen, seemingly sealed within, without awakening throughout the process.</p><p>Qin Sang shot a sword light from his brow, the Yunyou Sword hanging upside down above the Poison Pearl.  He repeated the trick, using pure sword intent to suppress it.</p><p>Simultaneously, countless seven-colored threads appeared inside the Poison Pearl, tentatively drifting towards the Gu King.  However, they didn't touch the Gu King's body, instead merging into its divine pattern seals.</p><p>The divine pattern seals left by Gui Mu used the Gu King's weakness, simultaneously guiding Qin Sang.</p><p>Gradually, the Gu King's divine patterns turned seven-colored.  Although Qin Sang's movements were gentle, the Gu King seemed to sense the threat, nearly awakening several times.</p><p>Fortunately, with the Yunyou Sword's suppression, the process was relatively smooth.</p><p>“Done!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered as he retracted the Poison Pearl into his palm.</p><p>Inside the Poison Pearl, the Gu King was bound, wrapped in a large net of seven-colored threads, layer upon layer, all threads connected to the nodes of the divine patterns.</p><p>The Gu King's aura wasn't noticeably weakened, as Qin Sang planned to use a slow approach.</p><p>The seven-colored threads were the Poison Pearl's tentacles, slowly absorbing its power while the Gu King slept.  The process would be extremely long.  Before the Gu King weakened, there was still a possibility of accidents; the Yunyou Sword needed to guard it constantly.</p><p>He withdrew the Poison Pearl and the spiritual sword into his body.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer paid attention.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang took a few more pills, his injuries finally healed. He then threw himself into cultivation.</p><p>No ferocious beasts have appeared yet.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this was naturally good news.</p><p>Previously, he planned to let his avatar secretly escape while the two races' Nascent Soul cultivators hunted ferocious beasts, without intending to use his main body. Now that his main body's injuries were healed, he could also make a move.</p><p>While cultivating, he would occasionally take out the Wood Phase inheritance and other true inheritances to read and contemplate.</p><p>There was still no news from the outside world.</p><p>In between cultivation sessions, Qin Sang turned his attention to the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus."</p><p>After his spiritual sense breakthrough, further improvement was difficult to achieve quickly.  It was better to refine his physical body instead.  So, before his Nascent Soul breakthrough, Qin Sang wasn't planning to continue cultivating this technique.</p><p>However, necessary preparations still needed to be made.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Fire Lotus and the Solar God Tree, attempting to refine the Nanming Li Fire, but failed repeatedly. The Fire Lotus couldn't move the Nanming Li Fire at all!</p><p>This created a deadlock.</p><p>To what level must the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" be cultivated to move the Nanming Li Fire? But without refining the Nanming Li Fire, how could he enhance the Fire Lotus?</p><p>With Qin Sang's current cultivation, the improvement brought by ordinary spirit fire was negligible.</p><p>Even the Huoxi Island of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect didn't have it, and it would be even harder to find a satisfactory spirit fire elsewhere; he could only hope for the future ascension to the Grand Thousand World.</p><p>“Unfortunately, with the Immortal Palace's ascension, the Qixia Hall of the Canglang Sea is probably gone… huh?”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the past, suddenly remembering something.</p><p>Once upon a time, he was trapped in the Seven Kills Hall.  The Nine-Phoenix King mistook him for a demon, witnessing firsthand how the King used a damaged feather to break the celestial barrier and enter the inner hall.  The feather blazed like a fire, seemingly akin to a Vermillion Bird's true feather, imbued with spiritual flames.</p><p>There was also a Celestial Phoenix feather.</p><p>The Celestial Phoenix feather was taken to Yitian Peak by the Jiao Dragon King, who attempted to escape with it but was killed. The feather then fell into the hands of an elder from the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>The damaged feather, however, hasn't reappeared and should still be with the Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>What became of the Nine-Phoenix King and the other demons remains unknown, as does the fate of the feather.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers on his knees, pondering the matter.  Unsure of the relative rank between the damaged feather and the Vermillion Bird's true feather, he wasn't certain if the Fire Lotus could refine it.</p><p>This wasn't an urgent matter.</p><p>Putting aside his thoughts, Qin Sang returned to his cultivation.</p><p>Seasons changed.</p><p>Time slipped away quietly amidst his cultivation.</p><p>In this manner, another twenty years passed peacefully.</p><p>Qin Sang occasionally left seclusion to check on the progress of the Green Sheep Temple, but with the Underworld Moon Guards assisting, he didn't need to worry about much.</p><p>The Northern Wastelands remained unchanged, while various sects in the Central Plains seemed to have underlying currents of conflict.  This didn't concern Qin Sang, so he paid it little attention.</p><p>His alternate body remained at the Ganlu Zen Monastery.  During this time, he befriended several high monks, cultivating good relationships.  Perhaps because the Holy One Hui Guang showed considerable favor towards him, his alternate body asked them questions without hesitation, and they shared their knowledge freely.</p><p>His alternate body either spent time in the scripture library, studied the Dao of Alchemy, or befriended various experts – a comfortable existence.</p><p>Of course, he had plenty to do.</p><p>Several pills required by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly had already been refined.  The primary materials for the Taiji Altar were obtained from the Green Fox Saint King, while the less valuable auxiliary materials were readily available and had been collected.</p><p>Some of the spiritual materials for the Ice and Fire Order had also been gathered, and he had a general idea of where to find the rest, planning to acquire them through trade.</p><p>To his knowledge, the ferocious beast hadn't appeared, and the Green Fox Saint King remained at the Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>Strangely, Mo Xingdao hadn't left either.  Like the alternate body, he occupied a superior cave in the back mountains, diligently cultivating.</p><p>It seems the top independent cultivator of the Northern Wastelands was sincerely dedicating himself to Buddhism.</p><p>The alternate body had only met Mo Xingdao once, exchanging a few words before quickly parting.</p><p>One day,</p><p>while the alternate body was in the scripture library examining Buddhist scriptures, focusing on aspects related to body refinement, he suddenly sensed a disturbance in the mountain gate's energy.  Putting down his scroll, he left the library, seeing monks hurrying to and fro.</p><p>Buddhist masters rarely seen on ordinary days were now appearing one after another.</p><p>The alternate body stopped one to ask what was happening and learned that the abbot, Master Xingji, had summoned everyone.  He then saw a flash of light from the direction of Little Square Inch Mountain and immediately understood.</p><p>Without hesitation, he quickly went to the Great Hero Hall and saw Holy One Hui Guang and the Green Fox Saint King together.  Abbot Xingji was bowing to them, reporting something.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stood to the side, eyes downcast, his attention seemingly on his own thoughts, the whereabouts of his puppet unknown.</p><p>Familiar Buddhist masters greeted the alternate body upon seeing him.  The two Transcendental Cultivators also noticed him.  The Green Fox Saint King merely glanced at him, while Holy One Hui Guang smiled and nodded.</p><p>The alternate body returned their greetings and quickly went to Mo Xingdao, stating directly, "Friend Mo, has the ferocious beast appeared?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao responded, "The Storm Belt sent a warning.  A cultivator patrolling the southeast detected a change, and a ferocious beast is breaking through the waves, heading north.  Judging by its direction, it should pass by the Central Plains.  Cultivators outside have already taken action, preparing to use bait to gradually guide the beast towards the north of the Central Plains..."</p><p>The alternate body nodded.</p><p>He already knew about the plan of the two Transcendental Cultivators – setting traps in the north and south, while they themselves would hold the Central Plains.</p><p>The two races would work together, dividing their forces to defend and set bait in the Storm Belt.  Depending on where the beast appeared, they would decide whether to lure it south or north.</p><p>The north was most convenient, as the Buddhist sect controlled an ancient teleportation array on the edge of the Western Desert leading directly to the North Sea.</p><p>A concrete plan was already in place. Now was the time to gather various experts for the hunt.</p><p>The alternate body hurried back to his cave, sent a message to his main body, collected his belongings, and when he came out, he saw a dark shadow appear above the Ganlu Zen Monastery – a flying vessel.</p><p>Led by the two Transcendental Cultivators, Buddhist masters filed into the vessel.</p><p>Seeing the alternate body board, the Green Fox Saint King's eyes showed surprise.</p><p>The alternate body didn't take the opportunity to leave; he needed to see the beast with his own eyes to be at ease.</p><p>In the Deer Wilds,</p><p>upon receiving the news, the main body left his cave, glanced towards the north, and vanished from the Deer Wilds, going to an uninhabited place, transforming into lightning and speeding through the air.</p><p>(End)</p>
