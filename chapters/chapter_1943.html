<h1>Chapter 1934: Martial Dao</h1><p>“What is a Ghost Cloud Steed?”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, hearing of this demonic beast for the first time, recalled that Luo Hou was still in her spirit form and suddenly realized, “You want to possess it?”</p><p>Luo Hou, crippled by Qin Sang years ago, had never found a suitable physical body, and she herself was unwilling to settle.  She had delayed until now.</p><p>Luo Hou gave a noncommittal answer. “The Ghost Cloud Steed’s bloodline has a certain compatibility with my own.”</p><p>If she wanted to possess a body, she didn't need to insist on the Shadow Horse clan.  She could also choose a similar bloodline as a vessel.</p><p>Luo Hou had several alternatives, the Ghost Cloud Steed being one of them.</p><p>Luo Hou's expression was clearly hesitant.  Firstly, because this Ghost Cloud Steed's bloodline was thin, and secondly, the Ghost Cloud Steed wasn't the best choice, only a mediocre one.</p><p>However, the demon races chosen by Luo Hou, including the Ghost Cloud Steed, were all extremely rare.  It had taken this long to encounter even one.</p><p>Deeper within the Twilight Mountains, there might be better choices. But she considered herself a defeated general, fortunate to have survived and become a guardian spirit beast. How could she ask her master to make a special trip to find a body for her?</p><p>Moreover, the situation in the Twilight Mountains was complex, with no shortage of Nascent Soul stage powerhouses.  Danger lurked everywhere.</p><p>With only her spirit remaining, her strength was diminished.  Dealing with demonic cultivators like the Purple-Gold Divine雕was more than enough, but facing opponents of the same rank, she was somewhat outmatched and wouldn't dare venture into the Twilight Mountains alone.</p><p>Encountering a Ghost Cloud Steed was a small stroke of fortune.</p><p>Possessing the Ghost Cloud Steed, though not as compatible as some other demon races, held the hope of restoring her to her peak, although it would require more effort.</p><p>If she missed this opportunity, she didn't know how long she would have to wait for the next one.  The lack of a physical body had a significant impact on her cultivation, and the sooner she possessed one, the better.</p><p>“Then what are you waiting for? Go, go, go!” Vermilion Bird urged repeatedly, clamoring, “I’ll deal with this guy. It dares to call itself the Demon Emperor in front of this divine bird? I’ll let it know what I'm capable of!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird rubbed its claws together, its tone arrogant.</p><p>Luo Hou didn't move, hesitating.  “But, Master…”</p><p>“Why worry about that? Could that Qin fellow stop your possession? He brought you down the mountain to help you recover, didn’t he?  Otherwise, why didn’t he bring that fox?”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, with its little bit of cleverness, guessed Luo Hou's concerns with a roll of its eyes and suddenly burst into raucous laughter.</p><p>“Ga ga… You actually believed him?  He keeps saying he won’t kill, but isn’t it to help Little Five temper his demonic nature? He didn’t specifically tell us to show mercy when we came here. Do you think that Qin fellow is a rigid pedant, or do you really think your master is a great philanthropist?”</p><p>“Ga ga ga ga…”</p><p>Vermilion Bird laughed as if it had heard the greatest joke, clutching its belly.</p><p>Following Qin Sang, it had learned many new and interesting words, such as 'pedant.'</p><p>The laughter reached the Purple-Gold Divine 雕’s ears, igniting its fury.</p><p>The enemy was pursuing it, yet dared to be distracted by conversation and laughter! It was a grave humiliation.</p><p>Luo Hou was still hesitant. Since descending the mountain, Qin Sang had been slaying demons and eliminating evils, leaving rivers of blood in his wake.  Possessing another being was undoubtedly the act of a demon, even though the Ghost Cloud Steed had certainly slaughtered many mortals.</p><p>She wasn't Vermilion Bird; she didn't have the privilege of being spoiled and daring to ignore Qin Sang’s words.</p><p>“Oh my, I didn’t expect you to be so timid!  Just ask that Qin fellow if you can do it or not! Quickly go and catch that Ghost Horse before it escapes!” Vermilion Bird flapped its wings, condensing a fiery plume that transformed into a crimson streak, piercing through the air.</p><p>Luo Hou left the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 to Vermilion Bird, leaping towards the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Vermilion Bird shook its wings, glancing sideways at the enraged Purple-Gold Divine 雕 with a sinister chuckle.</p><p>“Your demise is at hand!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, having learned more elegant phrases from the mortal world, roared. Its entire body ignited in raging flames as it lunged towards the Purple-Gold Divine 雕.</p><p>“Arrogant!”  The Purple-Gold Divine 雕 retorted defiantly, but it didn't turn back.  However, it was easily caught by Vermilion Bird, and upon their first clash, it realized something was amiss.</p><p>Vermilion Bird appeared to only be at the late Nascent Soul stage, equivalent to the Purple-Gold Divine 雕, but it couldn't be treated as an ordinary demonic beast.</p><p>Moreover, the Demon Emperor had just suffered a blow from Luo Hou and was already injured.  It quickly fell into a disadvantage, engulfed by the overwhelming flames.</p><p>With the imperial palace breached, the Demon Emperor was preoccupied.</p><p>The other demonic beasts acted independently, a disorganized rabble, unable to mount any organized offense. They retreated steadily, escape itself a luxury.</p><p>Luo Hou captured the Ghost Cloud Steed, moving like a phantom, clearing the battlefield.  The throng of demons could only surrender.</p><p>The sky above the capital became the battleground for Vermilion Bird and the Demon Emperor.</p><p>“No one interfere!”  Vermilion Bird's roar echoed from within the flames.  It finally had a chance to fight and intended to enjoy itself.</p><p>“Senior Luo, what should we do now?”  A cultivator stepped forward.</p><p>Luo Hou gazed for a moment, confirming that the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 couldn't escape.  “Let Master Vermilion Bird have its fun.  We’ll go reinforce elsewhere! Move!”</p><p>“Fun?”  The crowd exchanged bewildered glances.  Facing a late-stage Transformation realm Great Demon, it was playing?  It was simply inconceivable!</p><p>With reinforcements arriving, the other two battlefields were swept clean like withered leaves.</p><p>Three demonic nests were destroyed in a single night!</p><p>Finally, the group marched majestically towards the capital of the Myriad Spirits Kingdom. The battle there hadn't ended, but the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 was at the end of its rope.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A streak of crimson fire crashed into the ground like a meteorite, destroying half the imperial palace, shaking the heavens and earth!</p><p>When the firelight dissipated, the crowd saw the tiny Vermilion Bird, one foot planted on the head of the Purple-Gold Divine 雕, which was countless times larger than itself.</p><p>Vermilion Bird preened its feathers, looking down upon the crowd.</p><p>Amidst a chorus of flattery, its small head rose higher and higher, its beak almost poking the sky.</p><p>With Su Xuanzhu and others cleaning up the aftermath, the three demons, their task complete, departed without a trace.</p><p>Vermilion Bird called out to Luo Hou, shaking a fiery plume. "Your master has already given permission. Why aren't you hurrying to possess it? What are you waiting for?"</p><p>"I'll trouble the two fellow Daoists to protect me!"  Luo Hou didn't question the truth, making up her mind.  She landed on a hilltop with the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Vermilion Bird and Tai Yi stood on either side, acting as her protectors.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day at noon, the three demons returned to Tai Yi's cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was comprehending the Tai Yi Thunderclap Talisman, was somewhat surprised to see Luo Hou. “You found a physical body yourself? I was planning to make a trip to the Twilight Mountains, but this saves me the trouble. Take these pills, adapt to this body quickly, and recover your strength.”</p><p>He tossed over a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside the bottle were three spiritual pills, all extremely precious. They were obtained from the Demon King’s remains, specifically refined for demon cultivators, and greatly beneficial to Luo Hou.</p><p>Luo Hou finally understood that Qin Sang had always remembered her situation. She immediately knelt and kowtowed, gratefully saying, “Thank you, Master, for the pills.”</p><p>“Hee hee, I told you he wouldn’t refuse. You insisted on asking for permission…”  Vermilion Bird hopped onto Luo Hou’s shoulder, brimming with pride.</p><p>“Asking for permission?”  Qin Sang looked at Vermilion Bird.</p><p>Vermilion Bird abruptly covered its beak, its eyes darting around before it turned and rushed towards the entrance. However, a powerful force yanked it back, causing it to shriek.</p><p>“Luo Hou needs to focus on refining her physical body and can't be a mount anymore. You will take her place from now on!”</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the shrieks, raising a finger. Vermilion Bird's flames surged.</p><p>“Master…” Luo Hou opened her mouth, but a glance from Qin Sang silenced her.</p><p>Soon, a crimson-feathered bird flew out of the mountain, carrying everyone on its back towards the sky, leaving behind heart-wrenching cries.</p><p>“Ah! I, the dignified Vermilion Bird!”</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain, Daoist Sanctuary.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body awoke from meditation, calculating with his fingers.  He murmured, “It’s almost time for the appointed meeting with the Cloud Cauldron City Lord.”</p><p>Now that restoring his foundation was no longer an issue, Qin Sang had to consider the priorities of his future cultivation.</p><p>Comprehending the Dao of Slaughter was clearly not something to be rushed.</p><p>Seeking the Dao, seeking the Dao – the most important thing was enlightenment and understanding of the Great Dao.  Epiphany referred to this very thing.</p><p>His true body venturing out wouldn't necessarily achieve more than his avatar.</p><p>Entrusting it to his avatar, letting it continue to wander the mortal world and seek opportunities from within, might be the best choice.</p><p>What Qin Sang’s true body needed to do was to gain strength matching a Void Refinement cultivator as quickly as possible.</p><p>Various divine abilities and treasures from before Void Refinement, some of them, were now slightly lacking in power.</p><p>Especially the three immensely powerful Buddhist Seals, arguably his most important means before Void Refinement, were now limited by his physical cultivation.</p><p>Comprehending thunder arts wouldn't yield extraordinary results in a short time, unless the Thunder Altar could bring him a pleasant surprise.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>One was to quickly elevate his physical cultivation, breaking through to the sixth level of the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*.</p><p>The other was to comprehend the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, relying on the *Violet Star Sword Canon* and Heavenly Voyager’s sword light, to deduce a Sword Domain from the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>Even if he could only grasp a hint of the Sword Domain's essence, he would have a significant advantage in battles against Void Refinement cultivators!</p><p>A breakthrough in swordsmanship would undoubtedly bring about a leap in strength, but the difficulty was certainly great.</p><p>For over three hundred years, Qin Sang had often pondered where he should start.</p><p>Gradually, he gained some clues and formulated a plan, though he hadn’t yet tested it.</p><p>Heavenly Voyager’s words back then were also a subtle guidance.</p><p>Using a sword formation to manifest the celestial stars, Qin Sang knew it would be difficult and didn't dare to have such grand ambitions for now.</p><p>Creating a Celestial Star Sword Formation required a gradual approach. He planned to emulate the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, gradually constructing the Southern, Eastern, and Northern Seven Lunar Mansions.</p><p>With the Four Symbols complete, he would achieve the Four Symbols Sword Formation!</p><p>Thus, the sword formation could be considered to have reached minor completion. Then, he would manifest the Sun, Moon, and Nine Luminaries, the Three Enclosures of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Supreme Palace Enclosure, and Heavenly Market Enclosure, ultimately achieving the complete Celestial Star Sword Formation.</p><p>This was a grand plan, and Qin Sang wasn't certain if he could complete it within the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang’s mind, scenes from his experiences within the Divine Court.</p><p>There were images he’d memorized of the Western White Tiger constellation while being pursued by the Demon King.</p><p>And the moment when he was possessed by the Thunder Ancestor, controlling heaven and earth, with the world and the Divine Court beneath his feet.</p><p>This spiritual imprint seemed to also encompass some impressions of the Divine Court, the four constellations, and the Three Enclosures and Four Symbols with Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions.</p><p>His consciousness was hazy at the time, and he suffered repeated shocks afterward, unable to calm his mind. The remaining impressions were very faint.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure how much he could ultimately gain, but if he could truly glean something from it, using the essence of the Divine Court to construct his sword formation would undoubtedly multiply his efforts.</p><p>Compared to directly observing the ethereal celestial stars, it was undoubtedly a shortcut.</p><p>Of course, if he could make a breakthrough in the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*, he could also gain powerful combat strength through the three Buddhist Seals.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers lightly on his knee.</p><p>He had asked the Cloud Cauldron City Lord in advance to collect potent poisons for him, and the appointed time to retrieve them was fast approaching.</p><p>The *Venomous Divinity Canon* was secondary.  Qin Sang mused that he should currently focus on comprehending the Dao of Dharma Manifestation.  The deeper his understanding, the easier it would be to break through future bottlenecks.</p><p>Though the Great Dao differed, there were also commonalities. He was already a Void Refinement cultivator, and with his understanding of the Unity of Heaven and Man, comprehending Dharma Manifestation would be much easier for him than for ordinary people.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A fierce wind arose within the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation, sensing it carefully.</p><p>Previously, guided by True Person Zuo, he learned about the so-called inner and outer landscapes in body refinement cultivation, but his understanding remained vague.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had grasped some of the true meaning.</p><p>Void Refinement stage Dharma cultivators manipulated the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, focusing on control.</p><p>Body refiners' transition from the inner landscape to the outer landscape similarly sought the Unity of Heaven and Man, but pursued the integration of heaven and earth into themselves, with the self as the core.</p><p>It was akin to absorbing the power of heaven and earth, nourishing oneself, achieving one's own inner heaven and earth, and thus, in turn, influencing the true heaven and earth.</p><p>Then, what about the Yang Spirit?</p><p>Was it using heaven and earth as the root, with the soul actively merging with heaven and earth?</p><p>The most extreme choice on this path, was it perhaps to abandon the self, integrating oneself with heaven and earth, becoming one with them?</p><p>It seemed to have some similarities with the Divine Dao, which was either rooted in the earth's ley lines or relied on the worship of incense and fire.</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang’s mind, reminding him of the Yang Spirit that attacked him in the Divine Court, its figure like a phantom, completely indiscernible in its movements.</p><p>Did these three different Daos represent the three ultimate paths for beings seeking the Dao, which then diverged, giving rise to various other Daos?</p><p>These were the results of Qin Sang’s continuous contemplation.</p><p>He knew there were certainly many errors and omissions, but it didn't matter. As his cultivation progressed, he would gradually refine his understanding, grasping the true nature of the Dao.</p><p>This process was a journey of seeking the Dao, and also a transformation and sublimation of himself!</p><p>“Dao! Dao! Dao!”</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the word over and over.</p><p>Facts proved that the higher the realm, the greater the importance of the 'Dao,' and the smaller the influence of talent.</p><p>At the Void Refinement stage, who would still care if you had five spiritual roots?</p><p>Of course, the speed of comprehending the Great Dao was also a form of talent.</p><p>Some achieved enlightenment in a single moment, while others struggled for half their lives.</p><p>“This is comprehension, isn’t it? But the level of comprehension certainly can’t determine future achievements. It can be supplemented through external means, gaining enlightenment.”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>The so-called Dharma Manifestation was an outward manifestation of the power of the inner heaven and earth.  With his Void Refinement understanding, his comprehension of the Dharma Manifestation was undoubtedly unmatched by ordinary people.</p><p>Qin Sang silently circulated the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*.</p><p>Several days later, the stone door of the cave dwelling opened, and Qin Sang emerged, full of energy. He instructed Gui Hou to guard the sanctuary and flew out.</p><p>He flew unhurriedly in the sky, crossing the Fire Domain and arriving at Cloud Metropolis Mountain, observing the changes below.</p><p>It seemed that over the past two hundred years, Cloud Metropolis Mountain hadn't changed at all, at least superficially, it was very peaceful.</p><p>Under Cloud Metropolis Heaven’s governance, Cloud Metropolis Mountain enjoyed lasting peace and stability, which was undoubtedly a blessing for cultivators.</p><p>Cloud Cauldron City.</p><p>Qin Sang only visited the immortal city once every few decades, but every successive guard knew his name.</p><p>Upon entering the city, the Captain of the Guard personally led him directly to the topmost level of Cloud Cauldron City.</p><p>The City Lord himself came out to greet him.</p>
