<h1>Chapter 902: The Thunder Cavern</h1><p>Chapter 902: The Thunder Cavern</p><p>Everyone spread out around the pool.</p><p>One beast king banner after another was activated, emitting dazzling golden light.</p><p>The golden light was contained within the space near the pool.</p><p>The demonic beast spirits leaped out of the beast king banners, roaring silently, then shattering one after another, turning into golden threads that merged into the formation.  The small space was filled with numerous exceptionally sharp golden threads, finally converging above the pool.</p><p>Unnoticed by them, a butterfly perched on a dead Dark Thunderwood tree nearby, observing everything.</p><p>Qin Sang was also hiding not far away.</p><p>Seeing the beast king banners and several familiar faces, he confirmed that these people were his old adversaries, disciples of Black Serpent Mountain.</p><p>Black Serpent Mountain had gone to great lengths, from hunting the Kui Dragon to disguising themselves as Dou Niu Peak disciples, splitting their forces to infiltrate Bright Mirror Island.</p><p>Their scheme was undoubtedly significant.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious, and a thoughtful look appeared on his face.</p><p>This was a stroke of luck.  Although the opponents were strong and outnumbered him, and he didn't know what treasure Black Serpent Mountain was after, Qin Sang had no intention of retreating.  Such a good opportunity, he couldn't pass it up without making his move.</p><p>Not seeing the young man surnamed Fang was good news.</p><p>He feared that man most.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the blood sea that had trapped Grandmaster Lu and four other Golden Core cultivators in Bamboo Pavilion was the work of the young man surnamed Fang; the other Black Serpent Mountain cultivators didn't possess such strength.</p><p>Some mysteries were solved at this moment.</p><p>One of Dou Niu Peak's true inheritances was a thunder technique.  No wonder the thunder contained stellar煞 energy. Qin Sang had already been eyeing that technique, planning to obtain it from Black Serpent Mountain later; now, he could settle this matter at once.</p><p>Of course, it would be even better if he could seize the treasure Black Serpent Mountain coveted.</p><p>This wasn't something easily done.</p><p>The opponents were not weak and possessed the beast king banners.</p><p>To snatch food from the tiger's mouth, he needed the right moment.</p><p>Furthermore, there were Golden Core cultivators from other sects at the entrance to Bright Mirror Island, as well as Grandmaster Lu and the skilled young man surnamed Fang—all unpredictable variables.</p><p>Obtaining the treasure was secondary; escaping safely afterward was paramount.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.</p><p>Meanwhile, the beast king banner array was finally ready.</p><p>The golden threads disappeared, actually condensing into a small golden blade pointed at the vortex.</p><p>They seemed to have exerted great effort to achieve this transformation with the beast king banners, but they had to do it to break the seal.  This seal was likely personally set by Lan Dou Sect's Grandmaster Lu.</p><p>Fortunately, they had obtained a jade talisman that unlocked another layer; otherwise, even if they could break the seal with their strength, it would have taken them some time, and the commotion would have alerted those outside.</p><p>"Beast King Blade! Strike!"</p><p>The black-robed man's voice was hoarse as he issued a low command.</p><p>The golden blade trembled slightly, emitting a metallic clang, then suddenly pierced into the vortex.</p><p>The golden blade's speed was astonishing; it shot into the vortex like a golden light.</p><p>After a brief silence, a loud boom suddenly erupted from the depths of the pool.  The ground shook violently, and then a column of light, interwoven with white and gold, shot upwards.</p><p>Along with the soaring column of light, waves containing chaotic energy swept in all directions, turning the surrounding Dark Thunderwoods into dust the moment they were hit.</p><p>'Not good! Retreat!'</p><p>The black-robed man's expression changed. He grabbed a beast king banner and retreated swiftly.</p><p>Those present were all battle-hardened Foundation Establishment cultivators. Without the black-robed man's warning, they all retreated. Even so, they were still affected.</p><p>For a time, everyone was in disarray. Several beast king banners were damaged; some were injured, their faces pale, coughing up blood.</p><p>However, they didn't lose their composure.</p><p>Qin Sang failed to find an opportunity and sighed inwardly.</p><p>Fortunately, he was quick-witted. Before the golden blade broke the seal, he sensed something was wrong and had the Heaven-Eye Butterfly move away from the pool.</p><p>Otherwise, no matter how strong the Heaven-Eye Butterfly's concealment ability was, being swept by the shockwave would have exposed it.</p><p>Most critically, the light column shot up over ten zhang before dispersing like a rain of light, its shockwaves instantly spreading throughout Bright Mirror Island.</p><p>The black-robed man's expression was exceptionally gloomy.  Without time to recover, he reappeared at the edge of the pool. There, he saw a large crater where the pool once was.</p><p>At the bottom of the crater, there was a white stone staircase leading underground.</p><p>Seeing this, the black-robed man's anger turned to joy.  He gave an order and swiftly rushed inside.</p><p>The others also quickly took out spirit pills, suppressing their injuries, and raised their beast king banners again.</p><p>With the keen perception of Foundation Establishment cultivators, they had definitely sensed the disturbance here and were on their way, possibly appearing before them at any moment.</p><p>And indeed.</p><p>They had just adjusted the spirit array when a whooshing sound arrived.  Looking up into the trees, they saw two streaks of light in the distant sky, speeding towards them.</p><p>More were following behind.</p><p>The island's Golden Core cultivators were all drawn here.</p><p>Hopefully, Second Senior Brother will arrive quickly; otherwise, a fierce battle is unavoidable.</p><p>Everyone exchanged worried glances.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cloaked figure had reached the stone steps.  Time was pressing; there was no room for hesitation. He moved as quickly as possible down towards the bottom. Fortunately, there seemed to be no further restrictions, and the path was clear.  He finally arrived underground.</p><p>A stone door blocked his way.</p><p>The door was incredibly thick, with silvery light flickering on its surface, like tiny electric snakes writhing. The door was sealed by a magical barrier, but with enemies approaching, there was no time to break it.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, the cloaked figure scanned the stone door, pondered for a moment, and then flicked his fingers.  Strange runes flew from his fingertips, landing on the door in a specific pattern.</p><p>When the last rune fell, the stone door suddenly blazed with dazzling silver light, then vanished instantly. The "electric snakes" disappeared, revealing a plain door.</p><p>The tense figure relaxed, a look of狂喜 (intense joy) spreading across his face. He pushed hard, and with a creaking sound, the door swung open easily.</p><p>The next moment, he cried out, "Ah!", hastily using his spiritual energy to protect his eyes.</p><p>Beyond the door was a large hall.</p><p>The hall was extraordinarily bright, dazzlingly so.  A normal person would be instantly blinded, for the light contained the power of thunder.</p><p>At the center of the hall was a circular stone pit.</p><p>Inside the pit was a layer of silvery liquid, seemingly calm but radiating an extremely violent energy – the purest essence of thunder, condensed into a viscous pool!</p><p>Seeing the pool of thunder essence, the cloaked figure's face registered shock.</p><p>If this thunder pool erupted, he would be standing right here, and there would be no chance of survival. He would be reduced to nothing.</p><p>Fortunately, countless runes were densely carved around the pool and on the hall walls, forming a massive spirit array that sealed the pool. Only a faint trace of thunder leaked out due to the passage of time.</p><p>Above the thunder pool, a strange stone platform floated in mid-air.</p>
