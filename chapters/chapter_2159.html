<h1>Chapter Two Thousand One Hundred Forty-Nine: The Thunder Pearl</h1><p>This tribulation crossing, besides Cloudroam Sword itself, the one who benefited the most was Heaven's Eye Butterfly.  It returned to slumber first, digesting the power of the tribulation lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about Cloudroam's feelings just before its breakthrough, thinking there might be some experience he could draw on to help the Five Elements Crown advance quickly. Unfortunately, Cloudroam couldn't explain anything; before its transformation, it was just a muddled spiritual embryo.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown had birthed a spirit long ago. Little Five, having experienced both the mundane world and the world of cultivation, could already control the Demonic Intent within itself, yet the opportunity for a breakthrough had yet to arrive.</p><p>Cloudroam Sword and the Five Elements Crown's situations were completely different, making them impossible to use as references. Qin Sang could only wait patiently.</p><p>Not long after, Qin Sang returned to Green Ram Temple.</p><p>At the appointed time, Shao Shi visited again, bringing the Thunder Pearl. Si Lu also accompanied him.</p><p>Welcoming Guests Peak.</p><p>On the jade table between Qin Sang and Shao Shi, lay a pearl the size of a baby's fist.</p><p>The pearl radiated a dazzling spiritual light, flickering like lightning, and bursts of thunder echoed within the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently, seeing that the interior of the pearl seemed to have swallowed a domain of lightning, contained within a mustard seed.  Countless tiny lightning bolts were repeatedly born and extinguished within. These bolts couldn't escape the pearl, yet they emanated true lightning power, shaking one's soul.</p><p>Shao Shi, relaxed and full of confidence in this treasure, smiled and said, "True Master, please extend your divine sense into this pearl."</p><p>"Is this treasure artificially refined, or a natural wonder of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and asked. He hadn't sensed any traces of artificial refinement from it. Of course, it was also possible that the refining method of this treasure wasn't among any he knew.</p><p>What was certain was that this pearl hadn't birthed a spirit, and didn't belong to the category of spiritual treasures.</p><p>"I don't know either! This treasure was obtained from an unclaimed secret realm within the Sacred Land. Its true origin is unknown. Perhaps it's a natural wonder, or perhaps it's from the hand of some senior," Shao Shi explained. "The Supreme Emperor has already invited several fellow Daoists who manage the Mirage Towers to a banquet. If True Master Qin has no objections, you can refine this treasure first."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had investigated carefully and found nothing unusual.  Next, he only needed to verify that the pearl's power was indeed as Shao Shi said, and then they could finalize the oath.</p><p>The gates of the Otherfolk Sacred Land would be open to him!</p><p>"This humble Daoist will gratefully accept!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand, and the Thunder Pearl landed in his palm on its own.</p><p>He closed his eyes slightly, urging his True Essence and divine sense to probe into the Thunder Pearl, focusing his perception.</p><p>The Thunder Pearl's original owner hadn't left any mark, nor was there any nascent spirit resisting. When Qin Sang attempted to refine it, there wasn't the slightest resistance; the process was extremely smooth.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang refined the Thunder Pearl. The pearl's divine light receded, making it appear much more ordinary.</p><p>"How does True Master feel?" Shao Shi asked.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "This treasure's divine ability is indeed as Fellow Daoist Si said. However, this humble Daoist is still uncertain whether the Lightning Summoning Oath will exceed its limits."</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang turned to Si Lu. "Fellow Daoist Si Lu, please assist me in activating the Thunder Altar once more!"</p><p>Si Lu readily agreed, got up and left, heading towards Western Earth Jing first.</p><p>At the same time, Vermilion Bird and Plain Maiden also went to Vast Waves Jing and North Sea Jing respectively, activating the core branch altars.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Si, come with me."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and left the mountain gate with Shao Shi, arriving at a vast, uninhabited wilderness, preparing to seal the Lightning Rune there.</p><p>"Please wait here for a moment, Fellow Daoist Si."</p><p>There was a hill here with a stone platform.  Qin Sang placed the Thunder Pearl on the stone platform and returned alone.</p><p>Within Green Ram Temple, clouds and mist billowed, forming a continuous haze as the mountain protection grand formation activated.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the forbidden area and urged his True Essence. The Thunder Altar in the valley vibrated, and lightning shot straight towards the heavens.</p><p>The next moment, an illusory Thunder Altar appeared above Green Ram Temple. Simultaneously, the masters of the other branch altars felt a connection and, led by Si Lu, Vermilion Bird, and Plain Maiden, immediately cast spells to activate their altars, resonating with the main altar from afar.</p><p>The Thunder Altar Grand Formation reappeared in Green Ram Territory!</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the altar, his mind entering it. He immediately activated the Lightning Runes inscribed within the altar.</p><p>Shao Shi was able to observe closely this time. Although the Green Ram Temple’s mountain protection grand formation obstructed his view, he could still vaguely see the illusory Thunder Altar in the sky. He looked up at the celestial pole, then glanced around, sensing the immense lightning power enveloping this world. The Thunder Altar was about to activate!</p><p>Despite having personally witnessed the power of the Lightning Summoning Oath before, Shao Shi couldn't help but feel secretly alarmed. Even with precautions, he wasn't confident that he could escape unscathed after being locked onto by the Lightning Rune.</p><p>If this Lightning Rune could be sealed within the Thunder Pearl, it would undoubtedly be a powerful asset within the Sacred Land!</p><p>Shao Shi suppressed the turmoil in his heart and concentrated on sensing the changes in the Thunder Altar's power.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>After several decades, the billions of living beings in Green Ram Territory felt the terrifying celestial might once more and trembled in fear.</p><p>The Five Thunders Institute had sent out talismans in advance, informing all parties, even mortals receiving warnings. Therefore, the celestial phenomena didn't cause any major unrest.  The ones who suffered were the birds, beasts, fish, and insects in the wilderness, who thought a natural disaster was about to descend. They ran helter-skelter, terrified.</p><p>Dark clouds covered the sky, and thunder roared.</p><p>With the actions of Qin Sang and the masters of the branch altars, the celestial phenomena became increasingly terrifying.  Finally, the Lightning Summoning Oath activated!</p><p>Thousands of lightning pillars pierced the sky, the world's spiritual energy violently surged, lightning pythons slithered, electric serpents galloped, and countless thunderbolts and lightning strikes converged towards Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Shao Shi had been staring at the sky above the hill. Suddenly, his vision blurred. Qin Sang appeared on the hill, nodded slightly at him, and also looked towards the sky.</p><p>Where the thunderbolts converged, a ball of azure lightning was born.</p><p>The azure lightning descended, revealing a sheet of azure lightning paper, fluttering down gracefully.</p><p>With a solemn expression, Qin Sang silently circulated his True Essence, activating the Thunder Pearl. The pearl beside him floated up on its own, hovering above Qin Sang's head, its light shining brilliantly.</p><p>The Thunder Pearl and the Lightning Summoning Oath, one above the other, resembled two balls of lightning, about to collide.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged beneath the lightning, forming hand seals and striking them towards the Thunder Pearl in succession.  The spiritual light on the surface of the pearl grew increasingly dense. Gradually, the pearl's body merged into the light, and the light flowed like water, constantly shifting.</p><p>Then, the light began to expand, quickly transforming into a massive silver sphere. The sphere itself was illusory, with lightning flashing and thunder rumbling within. However, it looked more like an image or an illusion, not real, and the body of the pearl seemed to have vanished.</p><p>As the silver sphere appeared, the Lightning Summoning Oath was already close at hand. The silver sphere was much larger than the Lightning Summoning Oath, making it seem as if the oath would be swallowed by the sphere.</p><p>Both were controlled by Qin Sang.</p><p>With a slight thought, he restrained the lightning on the surface of the Lightning Summoning Oath, controlling its power and preventing it from erupting.</p><p>The sheet of azure lightning paper, light as a feather, floated down and landed on the silver sphere. The edge of the silver sphere seemed to be nothing, and the Lightning Summoning Oath passed through effortlessly without any obstruction, sinking into the sphere's interior.</p><p>If the silver sphere could contain the Lightning Summoning Oath, and the oath could remain stable, this sealing would be deemed a success.</p><p>The next moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Black lightning bolts suddenly appeared around the Lightning Summoning Oath, resembling cracks in the void, rapidly spreading within the sphere.</p><p>Seeing this, Shao Shi's expression changed slightly as he nervously watched the silver sphere.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Finally, the silver sphere couldn't hold on.  With more and more black lightning, it collapsed with a resounding boom.</p><p>Qin Sang, prepared for this, immediately executed a prepared spell, isolating the Lightning Summoning Oath and the surrounding chaotic energy.</p><p>He could utilize the Lightning Summoning Oath, but that didn't mean he could control this power.  Every action had to be taken with extreme caution. Once the internal balance was disrupted, it could be detonated, potentially even injuring himself.</p><p>The Lightning Summoning Oath floated in place, motionless.</p><p>The illusion within the silver sphere rapidly collapsed, and a streak of light shot out.  It was the Thunder Pearl.  Qin Sang's timing was impeccable; the pearl's body remained unaffected.</p><p>Recalling the process just now, Qin Sang's thoughts flashed. The reason for the failure was simple: the power of the Lightning Summoning Oath exceeded the Thunder Pearl's capacity.</p><p>However, he had only recently obtained the Thunder Pearl.  This first attempt's failure was normal; he wouldn't give up just like that.</p><p>After some contemplation, he identified a few points he had overlooked and devised countermeasures. He continued to activate the Thunder Pearl.</p><p>The silver sphere reappeared, the Lightning Summoning Oath trembled slightly, and once again sank into it.  Immediately afterward, the black lightning appeared again, repeating the previous scene of collapse. Qin Sang could only retract the Thunder Pearl once more.</p><p>"True Master Qin?"</p><p>Shao Shi had a bad feeling and couldn't help but call out.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, remaining silent. After a moment of contemplation, he tried the same method again.</p><p>Within a dozen breaths, he had already attempted six times. The sixth time also failed without exception, but it gave Shao Shi a glimmer of hope, because the silver sphere lasted longer and longer each time.</p><p>The seventh time!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Lightning Summoning Oath. As time passed, the lightning power continued to accumulate and would eventually erupt. It was already restless, and he could only try three more times at most.</p><p>The silver sphere once again contained the Lightning Summoning Oath. The black lightning was still present, but significantly less and thinner.</p><p>As the Lightning Summoning Oath slowly descended towards the core of the silver sphere, the black lightning rapidly increased.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A huge black crack pierced through the sphere, announcing the seventh collapse of the silver sphere!</p><p>Then the eighth time… it collapsed again!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long breath and stared at the Thunder Pearl in front of him.  After eight consecutive attempts, he had almost reached his limit, racking his brains.  The next attempt would be his last. If it failed again, there would be no need to continue, and he could consider sealing other Lightning Runes.</p><p>He steadied his mind, discarded all distracting thoughts, and adjusted his state to its peak, activating the Thunder Pearl.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The pearl’s spiritual light shone brightly, manifesting the silver sphere, which appeared more stable and solid than before.</p><p>The Lightning Summoning Oath descended lower and lower, its lightning power almost at the point of eruption.  Qin Sang carefully guided the two forces, slowly merging them.</p><p>'Plop!'</p><p>Like a pebble dropped into the surface of a lake, ripples spread within the silver sphere. Faint shadows could be vaguely seen, and the resulting fluctuations were smaller than the eighth time.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't let the Lightning Summoning Oath fall directly. Instead, he waited for the ripples to subside slightly before continuing.</p><p>Next, he paused for a moment after each step. Qin Sang had already exerted all his effort, his actions reaching the pinnacle of finesse. Under his guidance, the Lightning Summoning Oath continued to approach the core of the silver sphere.</p><p>Shao Shi stared intently at the Lightning Summoning Oath.  He saw the black lightning around the oath becoming increasingly dense, but the collapse didn't occur. In the end, it actually returned to its position successfully!</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>Heaven and Earth seemed to tremble because of this, and the interior of the silver sphere was even more turbulent.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He controlled the Thunder Pearl with all his might, but he still couldn't stabilize the silver sphere and mend the cracks. He simply hardened his heart and forced the silver sphere to contract.</p><p>As the silver sphere contracted, countless tiny lightning bolts appeared within it. These bolts resembled mystical runes, revolving around the Lightning Summoning Oath. Then, like true runes, they floated towards the Lightning Summoning Oath, leaving faint marks on its surface before dissipating.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was the master of the Thunder Pearl, he didn't know what these runes were, but he could sense a sealing power within them, attempting to seal the Lightning Summoning Oath.</p><p>More and more runes merged into the Lightning Summoning Oath, and it seemed to be developing in a positive direction. However, Qin Sang keenly noticed that the black lightning around the oath hadn't vanished. It had only temporarily stopped expanding, seemingly resisting some kind of force.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically as this thought flashed through his mind.  Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck out of the blue. Black lightning spread wildly, as if it had just been accumulating power and was now fully erupting.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted.</p><p>A streak of light shot out from the silver sphere. It was the Thunder Pearl itself, which Qin Sang caught in his hand, quickly retreating.</p><p>Shao Shi reacted even faster. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, he had already retreated far away.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang threw the Lightning Summoning Oath high into the air with all his might.</p><p>At this moment, the thunderclouds froze, and all things fell silent. A sheet of lightning paper hung high in the sky, suppressing the world, its lightning power fully revealed!</p><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The power of lightning wantonly vented within this world, leveling mountains and tearing the earth apart. The might of the lightning lingered for a long time.</p><p>Fortunately, this place was far from human settlements and sects, and no casualties were caused.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shao Shi stood side by side, silently watching the Lightning Summoning Oath ravage the world.</p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p>Shao Shi shook his head and sighed lightly. It was clear that Qin Sang had exerted all his effort and hadn't held back intentionally.</p><p>In fact, Shao Shi wasn't too surprised by this result.</p><p>After obtaining the Thunder Pearl, the Supreme Emperor personally refined it and had already attempted many times, testing the pearl's limits. However, Qin Sang possessed the Thunder Altar and unique lightning techniques, so they wanted to try and see if there might be a turning point.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the afterglow of the lightning in the sky, lost in thought.</p><p>It seemed that because the Lightning Summoning Oath exceeded the Thunder Pearl's limits, they had fallen short at the final step.</p><p>However, the most fundamental reason was that he couldn't control the Lightning Summoning Oath, so he couldn't make the oath and the pearl achieve a certain rhythmic harmony.</p><p>This rhythm was extremely profound and difficult to describe; he had just discovered it. At the moment the Lightning Summoning Oath erupted, it was stimulated from within the Thunder Pearl, fleeting and elusive.</p><p>Perhaps only cultivators with profound attainments in the Way of Lightning could perceive the existence of this rhythm.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Shao Shi, wondering if the Supreme Emperor had invited any top experts in the Way of Lightning to refine this pearl. Otherwise, they might never have noticed. However, if they knew that the Thunder Pearl held a hidden secret, they probably wouldn't have been so willing to give this treasure to him.</p><p>Because of the existence of the rhythm, this wasn't the limit of the Thunder Pearl, but whether it could seal the Lightning Summoning Oath was still hard to say.  He could only wait until his cultivation improved and his control over the Lightning Summoning Oath became stronger before trying again.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't reveal this secret. He put on an agreeable expression and said, "We can only choose from other Lightning Runes. I wonder which one Fellow Daoist Si has taken a liking to?"</p>
