<h1>Chapter 564: The Unexpected Change</h1><p>Aside from the Thunder Hawk, it's virtually impossible for outsiders to spy on them.  The two cultivators never imagined anyone would dare set up a teleportation array right under the Thunder Hawk's nose, so they didn't bother concealing their actions, unleashing their most powerful techniques to slay the demon.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang glanced at the Tian Yao Qiu cultivators.  The absence of the Thunder Hawk suggested that, despite being fellow cultivators, Tian Yao Qiu and Wuya Valley were not allied.</p><p>Even if they couldn't kill the Thunder Hawk, they didn't need to worry about their identities being exposed.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced, and he subconsciously looked at Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi was looking back at him, his expression serious.</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved; he hesitated whether to tell Dongyang Bo about this.</p><p>Firstly, it would be difficult to explain how he, a mere mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, had encountered the two Wuji Sect Masters deep within Wuya Valley without being detected.</p><p>Secondly, this was all conjecture; without evidence, making accusations against Yuan Ying cultivators might invite reprimand and severely damage Dongyang Bo's impression of him.</p><p>He hoped he was simply worrying needlessly.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was hesitating, he suddenly heard Yun Youzi's voice transmission.</p><p>"Brother Qin, are you sure it was him?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, realizing Yun Youzi was confirming whether the other robed figure was indeed the Wuji Sect Master.</p><p>Yun Youzi hadn't witnessed the two Yuan Ying cultivators battling the Thunder Hawk, so he couldn't confirm the Sect Master's identity.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t sure why Yun Youzi asked him, but after a moment's thought, he replied, "Yes!"</p><p>He didn't elaborate.</p><p>Yun Youzi didn't press further, saying, "Brother Qin, if you find it hard to explain, I'll handle it."</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and nodded.</p><p>Yun Youzi turned to Chongyi Daochang, bowed, then whispered something.</p><p>Chongyi Daochang then channeled a ray of light from his jade如意 (ruyi), enveloping Yun Youzi. He listened for a moment, gave a slight nod, his expression unchanged, and dismissed Yun Youzi with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang watched for a while, but seeing no further action from Chongyi Daochang, he stopped thinking about it.</p><p>After a while, all the Yuan Ying masters were ready.</p><p>The Red-Haired Ancestor and Zhenyi Laodao simultaneously acted, opening a passage in the star chart and shouting, "Those holding the Ziwei Secret Scroll, enter the array now!"</p><p>On receiving the order, everyone acted without hesitation.  Those holding the scroll were already standing together, and they rushed towards the small Beichen Star Yuan Array.</p><p>Once everyone was inside, the array closed, and the star chart began to rotate, slowly moving forward as it turned.</p><p>Protected by the array, everyone approached the eye of the storm together.</p><p>The star chart steadied the vortex.</p><p>Faced with the storm's impact, the star chart, though less stable, firmly protected them, reassuring everyone.</p><p>They proceeded smoothly, soon approaching the location indicated by the Feather Demon King earlier—a place shrouded in faint clouds, where no trace of the celestial array was visible.</p><p>The leading Red-Haired Ancestor and Zhenyi Laodao simultaneously struck the small Beichen Star Yuan Array.</p><p>The North Star shone brightly, suddenly emitting a beam of starlight.</p><p>The starlight, like an arrow, shot out of the star sea, piercing the void.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Mysterious runes reappeared, and the vast celestial array once again materialized before them.</p><p>The starlight pierced the array, causing only ripples in the runes, failing to breach it.</p><p>Undeterred, the Red-Haired Ancestor and Zhenyi Laodao continued to activate the small Beichen Star Yuan Array, unleashing thicker beams of starlight, relentlessly pounding a specific point on the celestial array.</p><p>Accompanied by thunderous roars,</p><p>the celestial array fluctuated more violently, and the runes finally began to crack.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A gap finally opened in the celestial array, revealing a deep passage. The surrounding runes rushed towards the opening, attempting to repair the array, but were unable to prevent the gap from forming.</p><p>The Red-Haired Ancestor rejoiced, waving his arm, "Enter the array!"</p><p>Ten thousand stars shone on the star chart.</p><p>With a flash, the star chart darted into the opening in the celestial array, just as the gap sealed shut, restoring the array to its original state.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The next moment, darkness suddenly fell upon them.</p><p>They had entered a realm of endless, violent winds.</p><p>Above and below, a yellowish haze prevailed, with howling winds that made it impossible to move.</p><p>This was no ordinary wind, but a soul-eroding, bone-chilling divine wind. In the depths of the gale, a chaotic expanse rendered everything invisible.</p><p>The terrifying wind force slammed against the small Beichen Star Yuan Array.</p><p>A chorus of gasps echoed.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest, his blood surging.  Their five-person Beast Seal Formation almost broke apart. Luckily, a strange force subtly intervened, supporting them and stabilizing the formation.</p><p>“Chen Yan is secretly helping us,”</p><p>Qin Sang realized, shocked by the power of the celestial array.</p><p>Protected above by the Xia Bei Chen Star Array, guarded by Dong Yang Bo, and supported by the Beast Seal, they still couldn't withstand the onslaught of the divine winds. No wonder everyone else thought they were doomed, watching with amusement.</p><p>After the first wave, the Xia Bei Chen Star Array paused momentarily, then continued forward, facing the divine winds.</p><p>Along the way, they encountered countless types of divine winds:</p><p>A bone-chilling cold wind, comparable in power to the Xuan Shuang Gale.</p><p>A mournful wind, like the cries of ten thousand ghosts.</p><p>An intensely hot divine wind capable of boiling the sea and scorching the heavens, seeming to conceal a blazing sun within its fury.</p><p>And a wind of nothingness, seemingly calm and devoid of any visible force, yet nearly obliterating a corner of the Xia Bei Chen Star Array upon contact.</p><p>…</p><p>This tempest of divine winds, many seen only in ancient texts, or even unheard of, were all unleashed within the celestial array, ever-changing and unpredictable.</p><p>Even after spending considerable time within the array, the end was still not in sight.</p><p>Seeing that the Xia Bei Chen Star Array remained stable, always managing to escape danger, Qin Sang relaxed and began to appreciate the celestial array and its divine winds.</p><p>It was unimaginable where the ancient cultivators found so many strange divine winds, and how they managed to subdue and seal them within the celestial array as a defensive mechanism.</p><p>It is said that these divine winds are only a small fraction of the power remaining in the celestial array after the ruin of the Zi Wei Palace.  The complete array had many more challenges, with the divine winds being only one of them.  And even these aren't complete.</p><p>The Xia Bei Chen Star Array was like a lone sail in the boundless void, navigating endlessly, with no end in sight.</p><p>After passing through a Netherworld Demon Wind, they entered a calm, dark space ahead.</p><p>Everyone became wary. This was similar to the scene before encountering the wind of nothingness—they'd been careless then and nearly suffered a severe setback.</p><p>“The Heavenly Gate is ahead!”</p><p>Someone shouted.</p><p>In the depths of the endless void, a faint white light appeared, the outline of the Heavenly Gate faintly visible.</p><p>“The final trial!”</p><p>The group rejoiced, exhaling in relief.</p><p>The Xia Bei Chen Star Array cautiously proceeded through the gaps in the nothingness winds, nearing the edge of the celestial array.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at that moment, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>An unusual fluctuation appeared ahead. Something seemed to spread rapidly from the darkness, blocking their path!</p>
