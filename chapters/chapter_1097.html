<h1>Chapter 189:  Death Holds No Fear</h1><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang had just set up the Twelve Demonic Banner Formation, and his True Essence and divine sense were being consumed at an alarming rate.  The Three Lights Jade Elixir still had some residual potency, continuously replenishing his True Essence, but his divine sense could only be restored with another type of spiritual medicine.</p><p>Qin Sang drained the Soul Cleansing Liquid he'd been holding. This elixir could increase the chances of forming a Nascent Soul, and when refined with the secret technique Ming Wei taught him, it could also greatly enhance divine sense. Now, it could only be used to replenish his depleted divine sense.  Fortunately, it wouldn't affect its efficacy in aiding Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>Pure soul energy replenished his divine sense.</p><p>But it was far from enough to keep up with the consumption.</p><p>Maintaining the Demonic Banner Formation was becoming difficult.</p><p>“We also have Soul Cleansing Liquid.”</p><p>A weak voice came from beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang looked over. The young man had awakened at some point.  His face ashen, he lay on the ground, unable to move, only able to shift his gaze, gesturing towards his and the young woman's storage pouches.</p><p>Even without the young man's reminder, Qin Sang had already thought of this. He had noticed the close relationship between the two youths and the Four Saints Palace.  Since the Trial Realm was left by the Four Saints, and the Soul Cleansing Liquid appeared in such a peculiar way, he had a rough guess.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang grabbed their storage pouches and retrieved two bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid, immediately downing one.</p><p>With the twelve demonic banners formed into a formation, its power was comparable to a top-grade magical treasure.</p><p>It wasn’t that Qin Sang didn't want to deploy the complete Eighteen Demonic Banner Formation.</p><p>It was because he sensed that this was his limit, achievable only with the help of the Demonic Fire Seed. If he drew upon more Nine Nether Demonic Fire, it would spiral out of control.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi suddenly called out to Qin Sang.</p><p>He was about to inform the Demonic Lord and Fairy Nangui of the situation when he sensed a thought from Qing Zhu's original body. The Ancient Demon's split soul, having forcibly used the Soul Splitting Slash, had weakened itself.  Qing Zhu had finally found a weakness, managing to connect with the outside world and seek assistance.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Ling Zhuzi’s eyes lit up with intense joy. His lips moved slightly as he silently cast some sort of blood refinement technique.  Then, he opened his mouth and sprayed out a mouthful of blood essence onto the dust whisk in his hand.</p><p>The dust whisk, saturated with blood essence, transformed into a blood-red whisk.  As it danced in the air, it resembled crimson hair strands, eerily beautiful.  Ling Zhuzi instantly aged, his hair turning white, his vitality draining, and deep wrinkles appearing on his face.  He looked several times older.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>The Demonic Lord, captured by the Ancient Demon’s split soul, was not resigned to his fate.</p><p>In this critical moment, the Great Yin Spectral Godlight reappeared.</p><p>Countless malevolent spirits clung to the Demonic Lord, greedily devouring his vital essence. Half of his body withered at a visible rate, becoming dry and wrinkled like bark, clinging tightly to his bones, resembling a skeleton.</p><p>The same scene played out on his Nascent Soul.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The Great Yin Spectral Godlight suddenly shattered.</p><p>Countless malevolent spirits were simultaneously sacrificed by the Demonic Lord, breaking free from the Ancient Demon's split soul's control.</p><p>Fairy Nangui, having forcefully increased her cultivation using the Sacrificial Essence Method, and after a series of battles and severe damage to her primordial spirit, was completely exhausted.</p><p>Knowing she had no chance of survival, she sighed softly, closed her eyes, ceased resisting, and her Nascent Soul floated out, actively colliding with the Ancient Demon’s split soul.</p><p>All three human experts chose to fight to the death.</p><p>They attacked simultaneously.</p><p>The blood whisk transformed into a river of blood, coinciding with Fairy Nangui’s Nascent Soul’s attack.</p><p>The Great Yin Spectral Spirits self-detonated, countless malevolent spirits frantically rushing towards the Ancient Demon's split soul.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's split soul, already certain of victory, had no desire to fight them to the death.  Seeing this, he channeled all his Demonic Qi to defend himself while retreating to avoid the brunt of the attack.</p><p>At the same time, he waved his hand, conjuring three chains. One of them bound Fairy Nangui, who was about to self-destruct, and flung her into the blood coffin. The other two shot towards Ling Zhuzi and the Demonic Lord.</p><p>“Grandmaster!”</p><p>The young man cried out in grief.</p><p>The young woman also awoke.  The two embraced and wept, watching helplessly as their beloved Grandmaster was slaughtered by the Ancient Demon. They were wracked with pain, unable to move or do anything. They only regretted their lack of diligence in cultivation.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>A furious roar drowned out their cries.</p><p>The Ancient Demon’s split soul, forced back near the blood coffin and the sword Qi, was about to imprison the Demonic Lord and Ling Zhuzi as well when he suddenly sensed another disturbance from Qing Zhu's true soul.</p><p>This time, it was different.</p><p>The Spirit Sword fragment emitted a strange glow, pulsating with an energy that caused the Ancient Demon's split soul to feel a stinging pain.</p><p>What shocked and enraged the Ancient Demon’s split soul even more was that a strand of sword intent from the sword Qi seemed to resonate with the Spirit Sword fragment.</p><p>In an instant, the Ancient Demon's split soul understood Qing Zhu's intention.  This Spirit Sword fragment was deeply connected to the Ethereal Peak’s sword Qi.  Qing Zhu was able to manipulate the Spirit Sword fragment, drawing the sword intent into his body to destroy the Ancient Demon’s split soul.</p><p>Qing Zhu could only draw the sword Qi into his body but couldn’t control such powerful sword Qi. This act was no different from suicide, perishing together with the Ancient Demon’s split soul.</p><p>“You're courting death!”</p><p>The Ancient Demon's split soul roared, “Stop! I promise to spare your life!”</p><p>“Death holds no fear!”</p><p>Qing Zhu finally spoke, his tone calm and unwavering. He was willing to die with the Ancient Demon's split soul, but he would never release the Ancient Demon to wreak havoc upon the world.</p><p>Just as he had said before: "I have no intention of bearing the burden of all living beings, but this calamity cannot begin because of me!"</p><p>If it weren't for him sealing the demonic soul within Ethereal Peak, perhaps things wouldn’t have come to this.</p><p>The sword Qi vibrated slightly, and a strand of sword intent was activated, slashing towards the back of Qing Zhu’s head.</p><p>The Ancient Demon's split soul was terrified.</p><p>A surge of demonic energy surged across Qing Zhu's face, revealing a distorted visage.  The Ancient Demon's split soul attempted to detach itself from Qing Zhu’s body.</p><p>He had another body waiting outside, and he had already made an agreement with his true self.  He didn't want to die here.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi urged loudly.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been preparing for this moment, his eyes gleaming, suddenly unleashed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, aiming directly at the Ancient Demon's split soul.</p><p>His True Essence and divine sense were instantly depleted, and he collapsed backward.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Demonic Fire shot out like an arrow, as fast as a meteor.</p><p>“Nine Nether Demonic Fire!”</p><p>The Ancient Demon's split soul never expected that someone outside would be capable of such an attack.  Moreover, Demonic Fire inherently countered souls. Caught off guard, his Demonic Qi clashed with the Demonic Fire, hindering the split soul's momentum.</p><p>A moment's delay could decide many things.</p><p>The formless sword intent penetrated Qing Zhu’s body.</p><p>A horrific scream, chilling to the bone, erupted from within Qing Zhu, originating from the Ancient Demon’s split soul.</p><p>Qing Zhu's body suddenly froze. A sword mark appeared on his forehead, blood flowed from his seven orifices, and his aura rapidly weakened.</p><p>‘Thud! Thud!’</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and the Demonic Lord crashed to the ground, narrowly avoiding being thrown into the blood coffin.</p><p>They looked at each other's miserable state, hearts filled with bitterness.</p><p>The Ancient Demon’s true self flew into a rage.  Seizing the opportunity while the sword Qi was affected by Qing Zhu, he frantically manipulated the blood coffin to surge upwards.  However, with all three ancient seals fully restored, they were all activated by the sword Qi.</p><p>As the Demon Subduing Tablet, the Dragon Corpse, and the Divine Furnace, the three demon-subduing treasures' powers were fully unleashed, the sealing power intensified.</p><p>The blood light dimmed, and the Ancient Demon’s true self’s counterattack weakened.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The blood coffin trembled, unable to withstand the pressure of the sword Qi, and plummeted into the bottomless abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang, having recovered slightly, saw Qing Zhu standing motionless, his heart filled with alarm.  He hastily retracted the demonic banners and rushed towards him.</p>
