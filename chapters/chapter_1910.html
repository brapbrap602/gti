Chapter 1901: Fingerprints


Qin Sang's divine sense entered his Qi Sea, where he saw the fragments of the Earth Slaughter Sword. Compared to a century ago, they hadn't changed at all.

A hundred years, for a sword spirit, was but a snap of the fingers. The time it needed to recover was beyond mortal comprehension.

Sitting within the Thunder Ancestor Altar masked the Earth Slaughter Sword's aura.

According to the First Sword Attendant, even face to face, very few in the world could recognize it.

"Hu..."

Qin Sang let out a long breath. The greatest hidden danger was finally resolved.

Inspecting his inner self, he found that during this period, while the Thunder Ancestor's phantom image had stabilized, his injuries had also mostly healed.

"It's time to leave the Misty Water Temple. I need to find a place rich in spiritual energy, establish a cave dwelling, and continue my secluded cultivation to solidify my foundation..."

Qin Sang pondered his next steps.

He knew that although he had entered the Void Refinement stage, he couldn't compare to true Void Refinement cultivators.

He was like someone who had just entered the late Nascent Soul stage and was directly elevated to Void Refinement.

He had to stabilize his unstable Dao Foundation before continuing his cultivation.  Haste would undoubtedly lead to many hidden dangers in the future.

Although solidifying the Dao Foundation didn't require exceptionally high spiritual energy, the Misty Water Temple's spiritual grounds were no longer sufficient.

Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, his gaze turning to the stone bed beside him, where he saw the Five Elements Crown's artifact spirit and the Vermilion Bird.

The Vermilion Bird could awaken at any time.

The Five Elements Crown’s artifact spirit, after being shaped by the sword spirit, had remained dormant. Qin Sang kept the artifact spirit by his side, occasionally checking its condition. He sensed that the demonic energy within the artifact spirit was only suppressed, not significantly diminished over the century.

As for the Cloud Wanderer Sword within his Nascent Soul, Qin Sang vaguely felt a spiritual embryo within the sword's body, rising and falling like a baby's breath, yet he didn't know when it would hatch.

Suddenly, seven-colored radiant light filled the cave dwelling.

Qin Sang smiled, lifting his palm as the Heaven's Eye Butterfly landed gently upon it.

Man and butterfly, connected by blood, Qin Sang sensed a somewhat urgent intent from the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, as if it were requesting something.

Qin Sang gently stroked its wings, saying softly, "You've eaten all the Radiant Flower Pills. When I go out, I'll find a Grand Alchemist to refine more for you..."

In the Talisman World, Qin Sang never had to worry about Radiant Flower Pills. Every time he returned from Mount Ju's Healing Altar, Master Lingxu would send them in advance, and Qin Sang only needed to provide some alchemy formulas in return.

He had thought it was good fortune to encounter such a devoted individual like Master Lingxu, but now he knew there was another reason.

Now, the Radiant Flower Pills were long gone.  He had focused on healing his injuries and stabilizing the altar's guardian deity. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly's cultivation had slowed considerably, still in the mid-fifth transformation.

If they were in the Talisman World, it would certainly have already broken through to the late-fifth transformation.

This was the drawback of forcefully elevating one's realm.  Magical treasures, divine abilities, spiritual insects, and even physical cultivation all lagged behind, needing time to catch up.

"Asking other alchemists to refine pills probably won't be as easy as it was with Master Lingxu..."

Qin Sang wasn't worried. He had seized a Demon King's treasures and was quite wealthy.

Thinking of this, Qin Sang took out the Demon Roc's coral pearl, pouring out the treasures within. Only now did he have the leisure to carefully examine them.

He couldn't recognize all of these treasures, but he could roughly distinguish the spiritual materials and medicinal herbs.

Among them, Qin Sang also discovered spiritual treasures. One was the Thunder Mirror the Demon Roc had used to attack him.

Picking up the Thunder Mirror for inspection, Qin Sang couldn't help but shake his head. As expected, this treasure didn't have the Treasure Recognition Art inscribed, and it didn't acknowledge him.

Qin Sang wasn't surprised by this.

Due to the restrictions of the Treasure Recognition Art, wielding spiritual treasures had very strict requirements.

After several battles following his Nascent Soul breakthrough, Qin Sang increasingly felt that most of the spiritual treasures obtained from slain opponents were unusable, and these were precisely the most valuable spoils of war.

Opponents who cultivated to such realms all possessed cunning divine abilities and numerous treasures.

If one only gained spiritual materials, medicinal herbs, and exotic treasures, the rewards and risks were clearly disproportionate, making it a losing proposition.

Unless there was deep hatred or significant interests involved, it was best to avoid such conflicts.

Qin Sang found three spiritual treasures among the Demon Roc's possessions. The Thunder Mirror and another section of red silk didn't have the Treasure Recognition Art.

Picking up the final spiritual treasure, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. This treasure actually had the Treasure Recognition Art inscribed within!

A pleasant surprise!

This treasure was pointed at both ends, with a grayish surface, shaped like a wooden boat. After examining it, Qin Sang understood why he had never seen the Demon Roc use it.

It turned out this treasure was called the Earth Traveling Boat, a spiritual treasure for earth遁, earth escape.

For Qin Sang, its speed was far inferior to thunder escape, but it could be incredibly effective in certain environments, so he put it away.

Besides these, there were many treasures for body refinement, which Qin Sang also needed.

As for the cultivation techniques and demonic arts treasured by the Demon Roc, they were unsuitable for human cultivation.

After sorting all the treasures into categories, Qin Sang kept the spiritual materials.

Then, with a flick of his finger, accompanied by a sword hum, the Gray Warbler Sword leaped out of the Thousand Jun Ring.

Since the Cloud Wanderer Sword's recovery, this sword had become redundant. Unexpectedly, it was now back in his hands.

Qin Sang had obtained the Slaughter Sword inheritance from the Chengying Sword, and had also received careful guidance from Celestial Master Tianyue. He had also diligently studied swordsmanship for many years and didn't intend to abandon the path of the sword.

He simply couldn't easily use the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation or the Cloud Wanderer Sword, but he could use other sword techniques.

To a certain extent, the potential of the sword path was the greatest.

The Seven Souls Slaughter Formation and Celestial Master Tianyue's "sword light" had opened the door to the Sword Domain for him, pointing out a path – to manifest a Sword Domain through sword formations!

If he could comprehend a true Sword Domain during the Void Refinement stage, it would undoubtedly be a tremendous boost to his strength.

Of course, when comprehending the Sword Domain, he had to erase the influence of the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation as much as possible, ideally drawing inspiration from it and then using other sword formations for deduction.

Qin Sang couldn't help but think of the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation. This was currently the most powerful and intricate sword formation he had mastered.

However, relying solely on this formation to manifest a Sword Domain was somewhat insufficient.

Qin Sang's thoughts raced for a while before he returned to his senses, looking at the Gray Warbler Sword.  Reforging the spirit sword, using it as a base to help it advance to a spiritual treasure shouldn't be difficult.

At this moment, Qin Sang retrieved another item from the Thousand Jun Ring.

Instantly, crimson light filled the cave dwelling.

The item he took out was the Sun God Tree. Its shape remained the same, but the branches no longer held the Sun God Birds.

The tree trunk still emanated the aura of Vermilion Bird True Fire.

Qin Sang remembered that when refining the divine tree, he had incorporated the green copper piece, the mysterious white copper, and the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's shell, among other treasures.

Looking at it now, Qin Sang was surprised to discover that the Nine-Lives Black Tortoise's shell had completely fused with the mysterious white copper. Even the green copper piece had almost fully merged. They had lost their original forms, becoming indistinguishable, and had fused with the Vermilion Bird True Fire.

"Was it because of being tempered by the Vermilion Bird True Fire for so long? Did I unintentionally refine something new?"

Qin Sang was quite surprised. He might have refined a spiritual material never before seen in the world.

"Was the green copper piece originally a fragment of a true treasure? Perhaps it can be used to refine something."

Qin Sang pondered, having no immediate ideas, and put it away.

After organizing everything, Qin Sang found there were too many things waiting for him to do.

"And also..."

Qin Sang's mind stirred, Yin and Yang energies appearing on his brow.

Two streams of energy, one black and one white, flew out from his brow. Within the swirling energy, two chess pieces revolved around each other.

The black chess piece had previously been sealed within the Crude Jade. After the River Styx Ferryman shattered the Crude Jade, it was attracted to the white chess piece.

Qin Sang had tried to investigate the origins of the Yin and Yang chess pieces and the River Styx Ferryman's intentions, but to no avail.

"If there's a connection between the River Styx Ferryman and the chess pieces, why didn't he keep them or give me any instructions?  Or was it that the chess pieces merely piqued his interest, but their grade wasn't high enough to catch his eye?"

Qin Sang couldn't understand. He hadn't made any progress in investigating the black and white chess pieces.

Previously, Qin Sang had attempted to circulate the "Yin Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art" to comprehend the black and white chess pieces.

Perhaps due to the incompleteness of the "Yin Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art," the black and white chess pieces showed no obvious reaction.

Qin Sang stored the black and white chess pieces in his Purple Mansion, close to the Yin Yang Armor, but the armor didn't receive any benefit, clearly indicating he hadn't found the right approach yet.

He held the black and white chess pieces in his palm, feeling a sensation of warmth and coolness.

Comprehending this treasure was no overnight task.

Fortunately, after stepping into Void Refinement, his lifespan was practically endless. The Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation descended every three thousand years, giving him ample time.

The transformation from Nascent Soul to Void Refinement was earth-shattering, even deserving of the phrase "defying fate."

Despite being manipulated, Qin Sang had received incredible benefits.

At least for now, Qin Sang held no ill will towards Celestial Master Tianyue or the First Sword Attendant.

An hour later, Qin Sang rose, tucking the Vermilion Bird into his sleeve. Then he activated the Five Elements Crown, sending a beam of five-colored light towards the Five Elements Crown’s artifact spirit, recalling it to its main body.

He pushed open the door.

Outside, Guihou and Luohou each occupied half of the cave, appearing cramped.

But without Qin Sang's command, they didn't dare venture out.

"Greetings, Master!"

Seeing Qin Sang, the two demons immediately knelt and kowtowed.

They originally called Qin Sang "Master," but later changed to calling him "Lord." Qin Sang didn't mind these small matters and let them be.

Luohou still existed as a spirit, while Guihou had fully recovered and made further progress.

Qin Sang looked them over, saying, "You've guessed where this is, haven't you?"

The two demons exchanged glances. Guihou's eyes widened, his voice filled with excitement, "Did Master truly bring us to ascend?"

During the chaos in the Divine Court, they were taken into the altar, unaware of the changes outside.

The familiar Six Heavens Ancient Qi was gone, something previously impossible, even for the Great Saint's Mansion.

There was only one explanation – they had left that world!

There were legends of one person attaining the Dao and their followers ascending with them.  They never expected it would happen to them!

How could the two demons not be excited?  No longer bound by the Six Heavens Ancient Qi, their future held infinite possibilities, an undoubtedly great fortune.

Moreover, the master they followed wasn't some wicked villain.

If their comrades in the Ghostfang Kingdom knew, they would be green with envy, the two demons thought smugly.

"Close, but not quite.  Having just arrived in the Greater Thousand World, the path ahead is uncertain. Even this poor Daoist treads cautiously. You should also understand the importance of discretion. Following this poor Daoist will not leave you wanting.  But some secrets are best forgotten."

Qin Sang said indifferently.

Both demons were intelligent.  They understood the meaning and knew they had no power to resist.  They opened their minds and prostrated themselves, saying, "We are at Master's disposal."

...

Early morning.

The Misty Water Temple was filled with worshippers.

No one noticed a particular worshipper who lit incense in the Hall of the Three Purities, gazed at the statues for a while, and then walked towards the back mountain.

He seemed quite familiar with the place, passing through the back gate and walking slowly along the mountain path.

The further he went, the more serene it became. Dewdrops dampened the stone steps, with no sign of anyone else passing by.

Just as he was about to enter the back mountain, the person suddenly stopped.

A young Daoist boy quickly emerged from ahead. Seeing the person, he was startled and hurriedly bowed, "Greetings, honored guest. The back mountain is the cultivation ground of our temple's senior experts, and it's not..."

Halfway through, the young Daoist noticed the person was also wearing Daoist robes.

The newcomer was Qin Sang. He glanced at the Daoist temple on the back mountain and smiled, "Please inform your Temple Master. This poor Daoist has traveled from afar, wandering here, and wishes to pay him a visit."

Noticing Qin Sang's gaze, the young Daoist's expression turned serious. The Daoist temple on the back mountain was concealed by a formation.  Being able to see it meant the other party was also a cultivator, and their realm far surpassed his own.

Not long after Qin Sang was ushered into the Daoist temple, the tranquility of Temple Master Qingxiu's courtyard was broken by hurried footsteps.

...

"This poor Daoist is Qingfeng. Greetings, Temple Master Yu. I apologize for this unannounced visit, disturbing your quiet cultivation."

Qin Sang sat calmly in the guest hall. Seeing a handsome young Daoist, whose demeanor was quite composed, enter, he knew this was the Temple Master and rose to give a formal greeting.

"Since we are fellow cultivators, there's no need for formalities."

Temple Master Yu was also a straightforward person. He ordered someone to serve his treasured spiritual tea and exchanged pleasantries with Qin Sang before asking about his purpose, "I wonder where Fellow Daoist Qingfeng's immortal abode is.  Are you perhaps seeking temporary lodging at our temple?  That can be easily arranged..."

Qin Sang shook his head, fabricating a background, saying, "I'm not afraid to admit, Temple Master Yu, that I was ill-prepared and have become somewhat lost.  I don't know what region this is. Visiting a fellow Daoist is one reason for my visit, asking for directions is another, and seeking immortals and sages is the third.  May I ask if there are any immortal cities or marketplaces nearby where I can find such eminent individuals?"

"Fellow Daoist is truly courageous, to travel so far!"

Temple Master Yu's face showed surprise, filled with admiration for Qin Sang. Qin Sang displayed an aura comparable to his own, yet he wouldn't dare wander so far alone, rashly venturing into unfamiliar territories.

Pointing south, he said, "This is Lihu Lake. Our Misty Water Temple is located within the Chen Kingdom. Fellow Daoist should have noticed that the surrounding areas are all mortal kingdoms. There are marketplaces, and cultivators are not uncommon, but it's difficult to find the eminent individuals you seek..."

At this moment, Temple Master Yu noticed Qin Sang using his finger to dip into the tea water and draw on the table, so he spoke in more detail.

"North from here, some famous mountains and great rivers may have Nascent Soul seniors in secluded cultivation. If you wish to seek immortals and sages, you must travel eastward. It is said there are blessed immortal lands and great immortal sects.  This poor Daoist has long admired them but has never been able to make the journey, so I cannot offer more specific guidance.  Also..."

Temple Master Yu suddenly thought of something and his tone turned serious, "If Fellow Daoist intends to travel west, be extremely careful. Remember to turn back if you encounter desolate mountains!"

The Daoist sects of the Greater Thousand World also referred to the Nascent Soul stage. The Dao Court's system wasn't even recognized by their fellow Daoists.

Qin Sang pondered, rising and cupping his hands, "Thank you for your hospitality, Fellow Daoist.  I won't impose any further."

Temple Master Yu personally escorted Qin Sang out of the Daoist temple, watching him descend the mountain. He felt a slight relief. The other party's origins were unknown, and it was best to see them off politely.

The cultivation world seemed rather restless lately. Was this person truly just a wandering cultivator?

Temple Master Yu pondered, passing through the guest hall.  Just as he was about to return to his quiet chamber, he inadvertently glanced at the fingerprints on the table and suddenly froze, as if struck by lightning.

These weren't water stains. They were a scene of misty rain, encompassing mountains and rivers, containing boundless profundity.

An incense stick later, the temple disciples witnessed their Temple Master losing his composure for the first time.

Temple Master Yu, ignoring the turbulent true essence within his body, rushed out of the mountain, his face filled with urgency. But the other party's figure was nowhere to be seen. He could only deeply bow towards the empty air, calling out loudly, "Senior, this junior will never forget your enlightening grace!"
