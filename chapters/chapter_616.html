<h1>Chapter 609 Forbidden Magic of the Demonic Sect</h1><p>Inside the bronze hall.</p><p>The Diamond Ring restrained Qin Sang and flew back to the hall, hovering beside the two.</p><p>Lord Dongyang, seemingly still uneasy, took out a strange talisman and struck it into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>At this moment, not only was Qin Sang's entire body restrained, but his Nascent Soul, meridians, and Qi Sea were also sealed by the talisman, rendering him powerless.</p><p>Qin Sang now saw the two confronting each other in the hall.</p><p>Treasure hunting partners turning on each other was not uncommon in the cultivation world.</p><p>But why was he involved, and why was Lord Dongyang attacking him?</p><p>Qin Sang was both shocked and furious.</p><p>Lord Dongyang sighed, “Miss Chenyan, I've been planning for years to bring this boy here without arousing suspicion, and it has finally paid off. Do you know how much effort I've put into this?”</p><p>A bombshell!</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang was deeply shaken, looking at Lord Dongyang in disbelief.</p><p>Lord Dongyang, proud of his scheme, couldn't help but explain further.</p><p>“This boy's talent is pathetic; it's a wonder he's lived this long!</p><p>“For fear of arousing your suspicion, I couldn't contact him directly, nor could I let Che Yutao and the others break the rules and take him as a disciple.</p><p>“At the time, I didn't expect him to leave such a strong impression on you. It was just a contingency plan, leaving things to fate.</p><p>“I arranged for my disciple to befriend him as an equal, establish a relationship, and then provide some support to help him live longer, lest he die prematurely.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, this boy has decent luck and actually made a name for himself.</p><p>“Later, I discovered your secret, and this contingency plan could actually be used. All it needed was a little arrangement and guidance…”</p><p>Who?</p><p>Zhuang Yan? Uncle Wen? Mu Yifeng?</p><p>Qi Yuan Shou!</p><p>It's Qi Yuan Shou!</p><p>Familiar names flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p>If there was such a person as Lord Dongyang described, it could only be Qi Yuan Shou!</p><p>Thinking back, from the time he first entered the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, his first contact was with Qi Yuan Shou.</p><p>Although Qi Yuan Shou didn't give him preferential treatment at first, after two encounters, they quickly became close.</p><p>For many years after, Qi Yuan Shou remained stationed at Xuankulu Pass, and the tasks he assigned to him were very simple, without any significant danger.</p><p>Later, Qi Yuan Shou was recalled to his sect…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered that the supplementary spiritual object for Qi Yuan Shou's Core Formation was bestowed by Lord Dongyang!</p><p>Was this a reward for Qi Yuan Shou’s service?</p><p>After Qi Yuan Shou formed his core, Qin Sang decided to go to Wuya Valley for training. Seeing his determination, Qi Yuan Shou even informed him of the sect's hidden contacts in the Demonic Sect’s territory, telling him to seek help from them in case of danger.</p><p>What Foundation Establishment cultivator could receive such an honor?</p><p>Qin Sang had thought that Qi Yuan Shou had gained more authority after forming his core, which enabled him to do this, and was moved by Qi Yuan Shou's care.</p><p>At the time, although Qin Sang questioned his own value and why Qi Yuan Shou would recruit him, he never considered this possibility.</p><p>Who would have thought that a Nascent Soul cultivator was behind it all?</p><p>Along the way, those Golden Core cultivators ignored him. But even when he cultivated the Nascent Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture and obtained the Sword Qi Thunder Sound divine ability, no one questioned how he achieved it.</p><p>Only the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower were valuable enough to cause a stir, but after learning that he had already consumed them, no one made things difficult for him.</p><p>Thinking about it now, apart from the few times he ventured out on his own, escaping Qi Yuan Shou's control, his entire cultivation journey had been under Qi Yuan Shou's watch, always very stable.</p><p>Except during the Luandao Waters battle.</p><p>However, at that time, Che Yutao was stationed on Guanxing Island!</p><p>There was constant danger during the great battle.</p><p>But if Che Yutao was watching, arranging for him to avoid the most dangerous battles, even if he encountered an accident, he could escape at any time with the Sword Qi Thunder Sound.</p><p>As they say, fortune favors the bold. That period was also the time he gained the most, and his rapid cultivation to the False Core Realm was inseparable from that battle.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled bitterly; he finally understood.</p><p>He clearly hadn't done anything earth-shattering, yet he had gained such a great reputation.</p><p>It wasn’t because a skilled warrior has no prominent achievements, but because someone was promoting him behind the scenes.</p><p>Their goal was to cooperate with Lord Dongyang, to let him obtain a Five Elements Beast Seal, and send him into the Ziwei Palace without alerting Chenyan.</p><p>Qi Yuan Shou, under the pretense of allowing him to enter the Ancient Immortal Battlefield early, gave him the Xuankulu Guard token, urging him to go to Xuankulu Pass early to wait.</p><p>At that time, Qi Yuan Shou advised him not to cultivate so diligently and to experience the mortal world more.</p><p>Didn't it sound a lot like, “Have a good meal”?</p><p>In the final days, he didn't even want to see him. Was it because he was ashamed to face him?</p><p>At Xuankulu Pass, Lord Dongyang suddenly gathered everyone and took control of the Beast Seals.</p><p>Because of his reputation from that battle, Che Yutao could directly assign him a Beast Seal without needing to participate in the test.</p><p>The reason was sufficient; Chenyan didn't suspect anything.</p><p>From beginning to end, the events flashed through Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Taken individually, nothing seemed amiss, but when he pieced it all together, Qin Sang suddenly became alert.</p><p>It was as if an invisible hand had been guiding him.</p><p>Especially during the last period, leading him step by step into the trap.</p><p>Even he hadn't noticed, let alone Chenyan.</p><p>Besides Qi Yuan Shou, who else could it be?</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Could Wanderer also be Lord Dongyang’s man?</p><p>He could accept anyone else, but not Wanderer!</p><p>Their friendship was too deep; Wanderer was both a teacher and a friend to Qin Sang.</p><p>There was still a clear distance between Qin Sang and Qi Yuan Shou.</p><p>But Wanderer was different; he was the person Qin Sang respected and admired the most. If he was also involved, Qin Sang couldn't accept it.</p><p>Moreover, Wanderer knew so many of his secrets.</p><p>After some recollection, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Wanderer couldn't be Lord Dongyang's man; otherwise, he wouldn't have to work so hard, always having to seize life-or-death opportunities for breakthroughs.</p><p>Wanderer brought a sliver of comfort to Qin Sang’s chilled heart.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang had another question, “What secret of Chenyan did Lord Dongyang discover? Apart from that dual cultivation, I’ve had no other interaction with Chenyan, and she doesn’t seem to treat me differently. What’s the point of capturing me to threaten her?”</p><p>Chenyan glanced at Qin Sang, unmoved, and said coldly, “You're threatening me with your own disciple? Isn't that ridiculous?”</p><p>Lord Dongyang looked at Chenyan and then at Qin Sang with a playful expression.</p><p>“Miss Chenyan, do you know that the ‘Mystical Jade Cauldron Scripture’ is considered a forbidden technique even within the Joyous Union Sect? Even those lunatics in the Demonic Sect don't dare to use this method to seek breakthrough opportunities, and those who obtain it invariably lock it away.</p><p>“Although you possess exceptional talent, and succeeded in finding a glimmer of opportunity for a breakthrough with just one use of the secret art, thus successfully forming your Nascent Soul, you’ve also embarked on a path of no return.</p><p>“You don't think you can rest easy now, do you?”</p>
