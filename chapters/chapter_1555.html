<h1></h1><p>Sect Master Mo, bewildered and increasingly uneasy by Luo Rong Daoren's expression, felt a desperate urge to turn and flee.</p><p>The palanquin arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>A wary glint flashed in Luo Rong Daoren’s eyes, and he discreetly crushed the thumb ring on his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward, cupped his hands in a slight bow, and said, “This must be Fellow Daoist Luo Rong of the Six Emptiness Sect? This humble Daoist is known as Qingfeng. I have long admired your name!”</p><p>“Indeed, this humble Daoist is Luo Rong. I consider myself well-connected, having interacted with many fellow Daoists within our community. I don't recall meeting Fellow Daoist Qingfeng before. May I inquire as to the location of your Immortal Abode?”</p><p>Luo Rong's expression returned to normal, a forced smile appearing on his lips.</p><p>“This humble Daoist is but a wandering cultivator, an insignificant nobody. It's perfectly understandable that Fellow Daoist wouldn't recognize me.”  Qin Sang gestured towards the Welcoming Hall with a sweep of his hand. “Please!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's evasiveness and unwillingness to reveal his origins, Luo Rong Daoren’s face darkened slightly, his tone turning cold. “There’s no need! I’ve just heard Sect Master Mo explain the situation and am already aware of your intentions. Let’s address the matter at hand first.”</p><p>A murmur rippled through the crowd.</p><p>The Xie Clan members stood behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren's disciples from the Six Emptiness Sect and Sect Master Mo also landed on the ground.</p><p>The two sides stood distinctly apart.</p><p>Sect Master Mo’s face was numb. The ownership of Mount Pu no longer concerned him.</p><p>The Six Emptiness Sect disciples arrayed themselves behind Luo Rong Daoren, their vigilance barely concealed.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist is indeed a straightforward person.”</p><p>Qin Sang seemed oblivious to the subtle movements of the Six Emptiness Sect disciples. He turned his gaze towards Mount Pu’s main peak. “This mountain was originally the ancestral land of the Xie Clan. Their lineage continues to this day. The Six Emptiness Sect is the most prominent sect in these parts, and Fellow Daoist Luo should be somewhat familiar with the Xie Clan’s history, correct? The Luo Smoke Sect drove the Xie Clan from the mountain years ago, seizing Mount Pu and refusing to relinquish it. This action is unjustifiable, both in principle and in practice. Shouldn’t it be returned?”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren said indifferently, “The Central Plains encompass the Nineteen Provinces of Yan Yu. I cannot speak for the other provinces, but at least within Zhuo Province, peace reigns. Such a blatant act of forcibly occupying another's sacred grounds is impossible. If such a thing had occurred, the Six Emptiness Sect would have intervened without needing Fellow Daoist to champion justice. As far as I know, the Xie Clan entered into a transaction with the Luo Smoke Sect regarding Mount Pu, with our sect serving as witness. Is this not the case?”</p><p>Sect Master Mo numbly nodded.</p><p>An elderly Golden Core cultivator stepped forward from behind.  “Reporting to Senior Uncle, this disciple served as the witness at the time. The Luo Smoke Sect temporarily borrowed Mount Pu, offering their sect's treasure, the Azure Silk Canopy, as collateral to the Xie Clan, with a set date for its return. Now that the agreed-upon time has passed, the Xie Clan has destroyed the Azure Silk Canopy and cannot produce it. According to the agreement, Mount Pu should belong to the Luo Smoke Sect.”</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren gave a derisive snort, shaking his head and sighing as if lamenting Qin Sang's misfortune. “Did you hear that, Fellow Daoist? You previously heard only the Xie Clan’s side of the story, which, I presume, was filled with inaccuracies. You’ve been misled. The Central Plains have their own rules, and these rules cannot be disregarded. You are an Immortal, free and unfettered. Why wade into these murky waters and tarnish your reputation?”</p><p>Qin Sang clapped his hands.</p><p>Xie Qian stepped forward, presenting a wooden box with both hands.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the box and retrieved the azure silk canopy inside. With a gentle shake, the canopy unfolded, transforming into a wisp of azure smoke—a magical treasure.</p><p>However, this treasure’s brilliance was dimmed, its power a mere fraction of its former glory, beyond restoration.</p><p>“Whether this treasure was destroyed by the Xie Clan remains to be seen.  This humble Daoist fancies himself somewhat knowledgeable in the art of refining. There are no less than ten ways to achieve the effect of self-destruction for a treasure. Such petty tricks might deceive those with limited experience, such as your disciples and the Luo Smoke Sect, but Fellow Daoist surely wouldn't be fooled, would you?  As for why this humble Daoist insists on intervening…”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dwell on the cause of the Azure Silk Canopy's damage. His gaze shifted to Sect Master Mo. “Sect Master Mo, would you kindly open the mountain protection formation?”</p><p>Sect Master Mo instinctively looked towards Luo Rong Daoren.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren frowned deeply and said in a heavy voice, "Open it!"</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Sect Master Mo hastily flew towards the main peak.</p><p>The Luo Smoke Sect disciples, witnessing their Sect Master’s demeanor, were deathly silent, huddled together.  A heavy quiet descended upon the main peak.</p><p>The clouds and mist around the main peak parted.</p><p>Clouds formed beneath Qin Sang’s feet as he led the Xie Clan disciples up the main peak.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang’s back, flicked his wide sleeves and followed.</p><p>Moments later, they arrived at the Xie Clan Stone.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped forward alone, reaching out to touch the Xie Clan Stone, gently caressing it. A faint sigh escaped his lips. “The Xie Clan Stone was erected by the ancestors of the Xie Clan and has always been their symbol, used for testing spiritual roots and transmitting teachings. What outsiders don’t know is that it has another function. Due to its unique composition, and having been infused with the ancestral blood, any direct contact by a member of the Xie Clan bloodline will evoke a response.”</p><p>As his words faded, a faint white light emanated from the top of the Xie Clan Stone, its texture transforming into that of warm jade.</p><p>This sight not only surprised Luo Rong Daoren and the others, but even Xie Qian and Xie An were stunned.</p><p>Qin Sang's words were undeniably true.</p><p>Only the Xie Clan bloodline could trigger such a change in the Xie Clan Stone.</p><p>With the Xie Clan’s dwindling fortunes and limited resources, they couldn’t support all branches of the family. Could this Nascent Soul ancestor be a descendant of the Xie Clan, lost to the outside world?</p><p>In an instant, the Xie Clan members’ expressions shifted from shock to ecstasy.</p><p>“Are you a member of the Xie Clan?”</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren's face changed.</p><p>An outsider reclaiming Mount Pu for the Xie Clan and the return of a Xie Clan ancestor were two entirely different matters.</p><p>This meant a new Nascent Soul power within the Six Emptiness Sect's sphere of influence, and a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator at that!</p><p>While negotiation might have been possible before, it was now absolutely out of the question!</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren, making no attempt to conceal his actions, unleashed his divine sense, scanning the Xie Clan Stone repeatedly. He even stepped forward to test it himself, completely unable to discern what Qin Sang had done.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled but remained silent.</p><p>Indeed, only the Xie Clan bloodline could activate the Xie Clan Stone.</p><p>However, he could also subtly manipulate the restrictions Xiao Xiangzi left in the Clear Void Illusion Realm to mimic this effect.</p><p>The Xie Clan, to this day, couldn’t fully comprehend these restrictions.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi, in his fury back then, would have destroyed this cultivation ground entirely if not for the Clear Void Illusion Realm’s exceptional resilience. The restrictions he left were extremely potent and well-hidden.</p><p>Moreover, Luo Rong Daoren’s cultivation was inferior to Qin Sang’s; naturally, he couldn’t detect Qin Sang’s methods.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren’s expression flickered, his mind racing for a solution.  Suddenly, his eyes glinted, his expression softening slightly.  His lips moved almost imperceptibly, as if communicating with someone.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t interrupt Luo Rong Daoren. Instead, he raised his head, gazing towards the sky.</p><p>The sky was clear and boundless, a vast expanse of blue.</p><p>Ripples, like those on water, suddenly appeared in the seemingly empty void.  Then, two figures clad in Daoist robes materialized—the other two Nascent Soul ancestors of the Six Emptiness Sect.</p><p>One was a female cultivator, known as Jing Ning, whose cultivation was similar to Luo Rong Daoren’s, both at the early Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The other was a vigorous old Daoist, holding a horsetail whisk, with an air of immortal grace. He was the current Sect Master of the Six Emptiness Sect, Cheng Huanzi, and the most powerful of the three, a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Luo Rong Daoren had sensed trouble and secretly contacted his sect.</p><p>Now, all three Nascent Soul cultivators of the Six Emptiness Sect were present on Mount Pu.</p><p>“This humble Daoist is Cheng Huanzi.”</p><p>His voice boomed, echoing through the area.</p><p>As he spoke the last word, Cheng Huanzi appeared beside Luo Rong Daoren, followed by the female cultivator, Jing Ning.</p><p>“Senior Brother, Junior Sister.”</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren bowed.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi nodded, turning his gaze towards Qin Sang. With a wave of his whisk, he said, “Our Daoist community is indeed filled with remarkable individuals.  I only learned of Grandmaster Qingfeng’s arrival upon receiving my Junior Brother’s message. Please forgive my tardiness in welcoming you.”</p><p>“To think that a minor squabble between juniors would disturb three Fellow Daoists’ cultivation. This humble Daoist is truly apprehensive,” Qin Sang chuckled, a hint of mockery in his tone.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi glanced at the Xie Clan Stone and said gravely, “I’m aware of the situation. While my methods may be inferior to yours, I too possess ways to deceive and evoke a response from this peculiar stone, masquerading as a Xie Clan member.  Using this as proof is rather unsubstantial, wouldn't you agree?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes turned cold. He snorted, “Preposterous! This humble Daoist wishes to return to his ancestral land and revitalize his clan.  Must I seek approval from outsiders like yourselves?”</p><p>“Not at all! Not at all! Fellow Daoist misunderstands!”</p><p>Cheng Huanzi shook his head. "The Central Plains are flourishing with the Immortal Dao, far surpassing the Northern Wastelands and Western Deserts. This prosperity is inextricably linked to our long-standing stability. Countless individuals with malicious intent infiltrate our lands, seeking to sow chaos and usurp our territories. Such incidents are far from rare, and each one invariably leads to devastating consequences. We must remain vigilant.  We act for the greater good, identifying and preventing evil. We hope Fellow Daoist understands.”</p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, no sect wanted to offend a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>However, allowing this person to occupy Mount Pu would create even greater problems in the future!</p><p>Their positioning was deliberate, forming a fan shape facing Qin Sang, subtly encircling him.</p><p>The three Nascent Soul cultivators combined their auras, exerting an unspoken pressure on Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze over the three, a cold smile playing on his lips.  He remained silent.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi narrowed his eyes slightly and continued, "I have a bloodline testing method. If Fellow Daoist is truly a descendant of the Xie Clan, perhaps you would be willing to offer a drop of your essence blood. If you pass the test, it will at least substantiate your claim.”</p><p>The more Qin Sang played the innocent, the less Cheng Huanzi believed him. Such coincidences were unheard of.</p><p>Sect Master Mo’s suspicion might be correct. Mount Pu likely held a great secret!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist speaks erroneously!"</p><p>Suddenly, an unfamiliar voice echoed from afar, rolling like thunder, reaching every ear present.</p><p>A fierce wind swept across Mount Pu.</p><p>A white cloud, seemingly appearing from nowhere, drifted in the sky. Two figures approached side-by-side.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, this humble Daoist has fortunately fulfilled his mission and invited Elder Lu to uphold justice."</p><p>Qin Sang's main body nodded to his avatar, then turned to Cheng Huanzi. “Essence blood is the foundation of a cultivator.  How can one casually hand it over to another?”</p><p>The composure on Cheng Huanzi’s face vanished instantly.</p><p>Firstly, Qin Sang's main body possessed cultivation no weaker than his avatar. Another unknown Nascent Soul expert!</p><p>Secondly, there was Lu Zhang, standing beside Qin Sang.</p><p>"Elder Lu!"</p><p>Why was Lu Zhang here now?</p><p>In that instant, many thoughts flashed through Cheng Huanzi’s mind.</p><p>“It has been many years. Your cultivation has grown even more profound,” Lu Zhang nodded, explaining, “I happened to be passing through Fudù Prefecture when I heard of an injustice. On a whim, I decided to investigate. I didn't expect the three of you to have arrived first.”</p><p>Then, without giving Cheng Huanzi a chance to speak, Lu Zhang looked at the Azure Silk Canopy in Qin Sang’s avatar’s hand. “Is this the object in question?”</p><p>He beckoned the Azure Silk Canopy into his hand.</p><p>Lu Zhang clasped his hands around it, examining it briefly.  Anger flashed across his face.  He barked, "This item was crafted with conflicting spiritual materials, deliberately concealed. Over time, it would inevitably crumble even without being used in combat. The crafter of this treasure had malicious intent! Who is the Sect Master of the Luo Smoke Sect?!"</p><p>Little Mount Pu.</p><p>Six Nascent Soul cultivators had gathered here.</p><p>Sect Master Mo never imagined things would escalate to this point. He was beyond tears.  Had he known, he would have fled the mountain with his disciples from the very beginning.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Ashen-faced, Sect Master Mo fell to his knees, making a desperate last-ditch effort.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Sect Master Mo kowtowed repeatedly, tears streaming down his face. “The Azure Silk Canopy was my master's legacy. This junior truly didn't know its origins. Please spare me, Senior! Spare me! Senior Uncle, Senior Uncle, save me…”</p><p>He shifted all the blame onto his deceased master.</p><p>A Sect Master, a dignified Golden Core cultivator, reduced to a whimpering dog.</p><p>Every member of the Luo Smoke Sect was terrified, consumed by fear.</p><p>“Scoundrel!”</p><p>Lu Zhang disdained to acknowledge Sect Master Mo.  He turned to Cheng Huanzi and the others. “This person deliberately schemed with a flawed treasure to seize another’s spiritual mountain.  His intentions were malicious! What are your thoughts, Fellow Daoists?”</p><p>Sect Master Mo continued to plead with Luo Rong Daoren.</p><p>Luo Rong Daoren wanted nothing more than to kick him away.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi watched Lu Zhang's actions with a cold gaze, regaining his composure.</p><p>Lu Zhang's presence here was no accident.</p><p>It was highly likely that the mastermind behind this was Mount Bu Nian!  Whether Mount Pu held a secret was irrelevant. Mount Bu Nian was merely using this as a pretext to establish a foothold in Fudù Prefecture.</p><p>The ownership of Mount Pu, and whether this person was truly a Xie Clan ancestor, were no longer important.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi’s primary concern now was Mount Bu Nian's objective.</p><p>These two Nascent Soul cultivators, whose origins were unknown, willingly served Mount Bu Nian.  They were clearly targeting the Six Emptiness Sect. Was their goal merely to contain them, or to drive them out entirely?</p><p>Cheng Huanzi regretted not contacting the Dragon Dwelling Heavenly Grotto beforehand.</p><p>The emergence of an unknown mid-Nascent Soul cultivator within their territory should have raised alarms.</p><p>Thoughts raced through his mind.  Cheng Huanzi knew they were outmatched.  He decided to employ delaying tactics.  He coughed lightly and said, “Whether the Luo Smoke Sect acted with malicious intent or not cannot be determined so hastily.  Perhaps this is a misunderstanding.  The Luo Smoke Sect might also be a victim. Of course, with the basis of the transaction now void, there is no reason for it to continue. Mount Pu should rightfully be returned to the Xie Clan.”</p><p>Lu Zhang seemed somewhat dissatisfied but didn't press the matter.  He returned the Azure Silk Canopy to Qin Sang’s avatar. “I cannot stay long.  I trust that you, Fellow Daoists, will ascertain the truth.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s main body smiled amiably. "I too have faith in the Six Emptiness Sect's impartial judgment.”</p><p>No one cared about the fate of the Luo Smoke Sect or Sect Master Mo.</p><p>The tension eased.</p><p>Cheng Huanzi studied Qin Sang’s main body. “And this Fellow Daoist is?”</p><p>"My surname is Qin, and my given name is Sang. I am a rogue cultivator from overseas," Qin Sang repeated his earlier explanation.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Cheng Huanzi’s expression flickered with interest. "Did Grandmaster Qingfeng also cultivate his profound abilities overseas?  I've long been curious about the overseas Daoist traditions, which I hear differ greatly from our own.  I’ve never had the opportunity to meet a Fellow Daoist from overseas. Perhaps, taking advantage of this occasion, I could be so bold as to request some guidance from you?”</p><p>If it were only Qin Sang and Grandmaster Qingfeng, Cheng Huanzi wouldn't be so rash.</p><p>With Lu Zhang present, however, he felt emboldened, proposing a sparring match to test their strength.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar was about to step forward when his main body stopped him.</p><p>“This Qin is due to return to my mountain soon.  I, too, regret not having the chance to spar with Fellow Daoists from the Central Plains.  It seems our desires align. Would I have the honour?”</p>
