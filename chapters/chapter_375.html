Chapter 368: The Crimson Pill


Everyone was startled by the crimson pill.


This crimson pill looked too much like a demon core!


Only powerful demons at the Demon Core Stage could produce demon cores, equivalent to the Golden Core of human cultivators at the Core Formation Stage.  Kong Xin using a demon core to resist the blood miasma was incredibly wasteful and daring.


However, everyone soon noticed something was amiss. The crimson pill lacked the oppressive aura of a legendary demon core; it was all show.


“Heh, it’s actually the inner core of a Skyfire Jiao…”


Among those present, only Yun Youzi recognized the crimson pill’s true origin.  Under everyone's curious gaze, he explained, "The Skyfire Jiao is not a true Jiao, but a peculiar beast that resembles one."


"This beast has wings on its ribs, somewhat like the legendary divine beast, Yinglong.  However, it doesn't possess Jiao dragon bloodline; it only has the form of a Jiao."


"The most notable feature of the Skyfire Jiao is that it can produce an inner core even before reaching the Demon Core Stage."


"Of course, the Skyfire Jiao's inner core is not the same as a demon core."


"The inner core contains the Skyfire Jiao's lifelong absorption of external fire power, condensed into a pill. This fire power transforms within the inner core, aiding the Skyfire Jiao's cultivation."


"Once the Skyfire Jiao enters the Demon Core Stage and breaks through, the inner core is replaced by the demon core and discarded along with its slough."


"Only then does the fire power stabilize and exist independently of the Skyfire Jiao."


"Skyfire Jiao inner cores are rare. Although the fire power within this inner core was mostly absorbed by the demon core, it mutated due to the Skyfire Jiao's breakthrough, giving birth to a peculiar妖火 (yaohuo – demonic fire), similar in effect to the demonic fire of a Demon Core Stage Skyfire Jiao."


"This inner core happens to counter the blood miasma.  Fellow Daoist Sun using it here is most appropriate."


Everyone suddenly understood.


Kong Xin looked admiringly at Yun Youzi and bowed.


"After obtaining the crimson pill, I spent considerable effort researching its origin. I didn't expect you to identify it so readily."


"Fellow Daoist's knowledge is vast; I admire you!"


"However, you didn't mention one thing: due to the special nature of the Skyfire Jiao’s fire, the demonic fire within this crimson pill is barely solidified and cannot be easily disturbed.  Any disturbance will cause the demonic fire to become chaotic and self-destruct, rendering it unusable as a material for refining artifacts."


"Besides keeping it for warmth, the crimson pill is useless. Yet, it perfectly serves its purpose in the cold Wuya Valley, my reliance when entering the valley.”


With that, Kong Xin channeled a wisp of spiritual energy, gently touching the crimson pill.


The crimson pill blazed with fire, a wildly chaotic aura erupting. The pill's body glowed intensely red, its surface like flowing glaze, seeming about to melt.


Everyone was astonished.


Kong Xin hurriedly retracted his spiritual energy and checked the crimson pill, relieved to see it unharmed.


Yun Youzi was also somewhat surprised.  “I have indeed heard of it, but only through hearsay. I have never personally seen a Skyfire Jiao’s inner core, so I didn’t dare comment on the crimson pill’s properties.  Hearing Fellow Daoist Kong's explanation, I now know it's true.”


Qin Sang nodded silently.  It was essentially a giant warming pearl.


In the blood miasma, the warming pearl’s effect was minimal, barely better than nothing.


Worthy of containing the demonic fire of a Demon Core Stage Skyfire Jiao, Qin Sang sensed the crimson pill’s flames were far stronger than the warming pearl.


"Fellow Daoists, follow me closely."


Kong Xin held up the crimson pill and walked into the blood miasma, everyone following closely behind.


Upon entering the blood miasma, the dense miasma enveloped them, the pressure instantly increasing tens of times. The Green Sun Demonic Fire on Qin Sang's body dimmed sharply, on the verge of extinction. Qin Sang hastily increased his spiritual energy to activate the jade pendant, stabilizing the demonic fire.


The cold was partially blocked by the Green Sun Demonic Fire, still bearable.


In the brief moment when his demonic fire barrier nearly broke, Qin Sang felt that the blood miasma was not only poisonous but also possessed a ferocious intent that could confuse cultivators’ minds.


Protected by the jade Buddha, he was unafraid of the blood miasma's influence, but seeing others cautiously guarding their minds, he realized they were facing a formidable enemy.


Following Kong Xin, the group flew forward silently.


The terrain within the blood miasma was ever-changing, with undulating mountains, making it difficult to discern direction at times.  However, Kong Xin was very familiar with the area, changing directions skillfully and confidently.


After entering the Blood瘴 for some time, under Kong Xin's guidance, the journey was safe and uneventful.  Everyone grew increasingly confident in Kong Xin's abilities.

Soon, a terrifying roar echoed from the distance ahead. The roar was filled with a chilling madness, far beyond that of ordinary beasts!

The horrifying roar caused everyone's faces to change slightly.

Qin Sang looked as far as he could, but the Blood瘴 obscured his vision, limiting his sight.  He secretly thought to himself that these must be the blood fiends born from the ferocious blood煞 energy in Wuyagu.

Kong Xin, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped his flight, his voice heavy as he said, "From here on, the ghostly creatures will become more numerous. Those on the outer edges aren't that strong, but it's best not to provoke them. Some areas are swarming with thousands of them. To be safe, everyone must follow my instructions and refrain from acting independently!"

Everyone readily agreed.

Kong Xin nodded in satisfaction, flashed his light, and flew towards the front left, choosing a detour.

As they ventured deeper, they would occasionally hear those eerie roars.

Kong Xin truly earned his pay; his skillful maneuvering kept them from encountering a single ghostly creature, consistently avoiding potential dangers.

Unbeknownst to them, they had been traveling in Wuyagu for several hours when Kong Xin suddenly made a disconcerting move.

Despite the continuous roars ahead, Kong Xin led them straight towards the source of the noise, showing no intention of taking a detour.

The others exchanged worried glances, full of uncertainty.

Yun Youzi asked, "Friend Kong, ghostly creatures are right ahead. Why aren't we going around?"

Kong Xin turned back, saying, "My friend, you don't understand. I've found a small path in the valley ahead.  Going through there, we won't be detected by the creatures, and it will save us at least three hours compared to a detour."

A woman in red expressed doubt, "Being so close to the creatures, can you guarantee our safety?"

Kong Xin thumped his chest, declaring,  "I wouldn't lead you all down this path unless I was certain. You just need to follow my instructions, and we won't be discovered. Besides, I'm going with you. If anything happens, I'll be in danger too. We have no quarrel, so what benefit would I gain from jeopardizing your lives?"

Then, Kong Xin turned to the old master and his disciple, "My friends, the medicinal herb you're looking for grows just behind the creatures' lair in front. I discovered it quite by accident. As agreed, I'll lead you to the place, fulfilling my task.  Collecting the herb will be up to you."

The disciple's face lit up with joy.

The old man's voice was tinged with excitement, "Thank you, Friend Kong!"
