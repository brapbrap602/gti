<h1>Chapter 2055: Desperate Gambit</h1><p>“The two Dao companions have already displayed their divine abilities to me. Originally, with only myself, simultaneously transforming into two Dao companions flawlessly was impossible. After a few exchanges, the opponent would have noticed the deception, especially considering that old Chamberlain’s cultivation far surpasses mine. However, as long as Brother Ji completes the grand formation passed down by Elder Quan, with the aid of the formation and Brother Ji’s assistance, deceiving them should not be difficult.”</p><p>The white-robed figure finished speaking, and a cloud of white smoke billowed around him. His form distorted, rapidly fading and merging into the white smoke. The smoke abruptly contracted, as if a void in space had appeared, sucking the smoke inwards, leaving only a white dot.</p><p>Immediately following, the white smoke surged back out from the void, but this time it split into two streams. Amidst the swirling smoke and dust, two figures materialized. The two had different faces, and their attire bore no resemblance to the white-robed figure.</p><p>One of them had wolf ears, belonging to the same clan as Ji Liang, clearly a member of the Quanfeng Clan.</p><p>The other was a woman in close-fitting attire, her heroic spirit radiating outwards. Her facial features were indistinguishable from a human's, but a long, furry tail extended from her back.</p><p>When they first appeared, both figures had blank expressions, as if lifeless. In the blink of an eye, their eyes became animated. Observing their expressions, movements, flesh, and hair, they were clearly two living people, with no flaws to be found.</p><p>Not only were they lifelike, but the auras of the two were also distinct, and both were at the early stage of the second level of the Empty Realm, equivalent to the early stage of Soul Formation. It was hard to imagine that they were transformed from a single person.</p><p>Ji Liang examined the two, circling the Quanfeng clansman, clicking his tongue in wonder. “Brother’s divine ability is truly remarkable. I’ve been with Ji Qiong day and night for many years, and if I hadn’t known beforehand, I might have mistaken this for the real Ji Qiong.”</p><p>The woman remained silent, leaping into the sea of clouds and vanishing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Quanfeng clansman chuckled, his voice raspy. “I am Ji Qiong!”</p><p>Ji Liang nodded, glancing downwards, his voice deep. “Ji Qiong, everything is prepared. The control of the grand formation will be entrusted to you. Do you have any further suggestions?”</p><p>Ji Qiong’s ears twitched. “To prevent any leakage of Qi, we should provide support from the side, with you taking the lead in the attack. This way, the pressure will be primarily on you.”</p><p>“It’s fine!”</p><p>Ji Liang waved his hand, a confident look on his face. “That younger one should have only recently broken through to the second level of the Empty Realm, not worth worrying about. The older one, though possessing late-stage second level Empty Realm cultivation, has fled all the way here, enduring countless fierce battles.  Last time, when the three of us attacked, we almost drove them to a dead end, forcing them to expend their vital essence to perform the Mutual Transformation Technique. This shows that they are already at the end of their rope.  Not much time has passed since the last battle, and they couldn’t have recovered much.”</p><p>Hearing this, Ji Qiong’s expression didn’t relax. He reminded, “They are, after all, from the Si You Royal Family, and may have hidden methods.”</p><p>“If they truly possess such methods and haven’t used them until now, it must come at a great cost. Unless they are driven to desperation, they definitely wouldn’t use them lightly. We just need to adhere to the strategy of continuous combat and attrition, forcing them to expend their vital essence once more, and perform Mutual Transformation with their last companion beast, cutting off their escape route. By then, their strength will be further diminished, and then it's Elder Quan's turn.” Ji Liang was confident and unconcerned.</p><p>Seeing that he had considered everything, Ji Qiong nodded. “Two weakened individuals, Elder Quan naturally won’t fear them. However, Elder Quan wants them alive, so we must wear them down as much as possible.”</p><p>As the two communicated through sound transmission, they sensed two auras surging towards the sky.</p><p>Ji Liang sneered, “I didn't think they would dare to take the initiative!”</p><p>Ji Qiong’s expression shifted slightly. He bowed slightly and, like the woman before, vanished into the clouds.</p><p>Ji Liang stood alone, calmly watching the two streaks of rainbow light as if looking at two dead men.</p><p>The two revealed their original forms, their auras unmasked.  A powerful pressure instantly descended upon the sea, and even though it was directed upwards, the nearby creatures trembled in fear.</p><p>Such a formidable aura was something they had never witnessed in their lives. In the past, the Pavilion Master occasionally patrolled this area, but he never released his pressure so openly. They felt like insignificant ants, and the islands below seemed equally fragile, easily destroyed by the other party with a flick of the wrist.</p><p>The rainbow lights soared straight into the sky, unstoppable. Yet, Ji Liang could see that this was a mere facade. He couldn't help but sneer again, spreading his five fingers and pressing his large hand downwards.</p><p>Instantly, dark clouds churned wildly, and endless clouds of Qi converged beneath him, forming a giant black palm.</p><p>The giant palm blotted out the sky, and the creatures on the surrounding islands could all see it. Each finger was like a celestial pillar, carrying a terrifying power capable of destroying heaven and earth as it descended towards the ground.</p><p>They had no doubt that once the giant palm landed, all the islands and creatures would be obliterated, but they were helpless, unable to escape its grasp.</p><p>Faced with the overwhelming giant palm, the two streaks of rainbow light appeared insignificant.  Just as they were about to be extinguished, a deep blue profound light suddenly burst forth. The profound light was extremely rich, like deep ripples蕩漾ing across the heavens.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Space seemed to tremble. All creatures heard a deafening roar of water, and then saw two enormous silhouettes appear in the sky – two monstrous whales!</p><p>The companion beasts of the Si You Clan were not mere fantasies. They had to be based on real creatures in the world. If they chose powerful creatures, they would need to obtain their essence blood. Within the Sea of Mist, ninety percent of the area was ocean, so the Si You Clan, when choosing companion beasts, would always have at least one that was a sea creature.</p><p>Those overlords of the sea, such as Flood Dragons and Whale Sharks, were most favored, but the Si You Royal Family often chose a type of monstrous whale known as the Butean!</p><p>Companion beasts that dissipated after using the Mutual Transformation Technique were different from those forcibly destroyed by enemies. After being destroyed, they would be completely lost until re-condensed. Currently, they were only temporarily unable to utilize them for Mutual Transformation, but they could still borrow their power in combat.</p><p>At this moment, both the young master and Chamberlain Xia transformed into Butean Whales. Two giant whales, one large and one small, hung in the air, too massive to see from head to tail at once. Their giant mouths emitted deep, resonant calls that pierced the gloom.</p><p>“Moo!”</p><p>The people below only heard two bellows, staring blankly at the sky as they watched the two Butean Whales move in unison, charging towards the giant palm.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Cracks spread across the giant palm, and it crumbled. The clouds in the sky were stirred, winds howled, dark waves surged, and the battlefield descended into chaos, completely obscuring the view of the creatures below.</p><p>This earth-shattering collision, however, didn't release much residual energy. The spiritual energy was shielded, and the Begonia Academy remained oblivious.</p><p>Seeing that their plan had worked, Ji Liang relaxed, ready to focus on dealing with the powerful enemy.  His ears twitched slightly, detecting an anomaly. He realized that the two Butean Whales were now merely empty shells, illusions to deceive the eye, and the two Si You clansmen were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Unhurried, Ji Liang retrieved an object from his sleeve and tossed it towards a specific spot in the sea of clouds.</p><p>A black streak of light shot downwards. The treasure within the light revealed itself to be a black jade pendant.</p><p>As it plummeted, the jade pendant grew to the size of a mountain, incredibly heavy.</p><p>At this moment, sounds of something piercing the air came from both sides.  A gray and a white chain pierced through the heavy clouds, their other ends connected to the depths of the sea of clouds, manipulated to strike the spot where the jade pendant was falling.</p><p>Three attacks arrived simultaneously, and an unparalleled pressure locked onto this area of the sea of clouds. Then, space distorted slightly, and the two Si You clansmen were forced to reveal themselves, only to transform into two monstrous birds.</p><p>This time, their companion beasts were different.</p><p>The young master's companion beast was a Crimson-Feathered Monstrous Bird. This bird wasn't large, but its body was quite elongated, with a long neck, sharp beak, and streamlined body.  With its wings folded, its body resembled a long arrow.</p><p>Chamberlain Xia's companion beast was a Bone Bird. This bird was not without flesh and blood, but its flesh and blood grew within its bones, leaving the white bird bones exposed, forming a hard bony armor, like a skeletal bird. Its size was also immense, its wingspan no smaller than the Butean Whale.</p><p>The Bone Bird spread its wings wide, easily shielding the Crimson-Feathered Monstrous Bird beneath it, seemingly intending to withstand the attacks from all three sides alone.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The jade pendant and chains struck.  Rattling sounds came from the Bone Bird, like the clanging of iron rings.</p><p>Silver light flashed across its body, revealing that there were indeed iron rings between its bone joints. These rings were interconnected, adding a layer of ring armor over its bony plates.</p><p>With a deafening crash, the three attacks hit the Bone Bird simultaneously. The Bone Bird plummeted downwards with a sharp cry, its entire body erupting with layers of strange light.</p><p>The light dissipated. Some of the iron rings on the Bone Bird were shattered, but it still stubbornly protected the Crimson-Feathered Monstrous Bird, flying swiftly forward.</p><p>“Trying to escape?”</p><p>Ji Liang snorted coldly, surprised that the opponent, after initially appearing aggressive, would try to flee after just one exchange.</p><p>He immediately made a hand seal, the jade pendant firmly suppressing the iron rings on the Bone Bird. At the same time, the two chains lashed out again, changing their strategy, each hooking onto an iron ring and abruptly tightening.</p><p>Its forward momentum was halted, but the Bone Bird made an unexpected move.  Its body shuddered, and it actively shed all its iron rings.</p><p>This action was also anticipated by Ji Liang and the others.  While controlling the jade pendant, incantations resonated from Ji Liang, the sounds emanating from his ears.</p><p>The moment the Bone Bird broke free, a sense of danger surged within it. Then, its body was enveloped in blood-red light.</p><p>Above its head, the void turned crimson. A bizarre blood diagram had appeared, descending towards its back.</p><p>The danger didn't end there. To its left, black tides surged, an aura of decay constantly assaulting it. To its right, a single silver gleam, more intimidating than the other two attacks, was a silver arrow, piercing through the void.</p><p>Having clashed before, Chamberlain Xia knew the power of these three attacks. His body stiffened slightly.</p><p>Ji Liang smiled confidently, believing he could force them back. However, the subsequent actions of the two Si You clansmen were completely beyond their expectations.</p><p>The Bone Bird raised its head and roared furiously, its bone armor instantly turning from white to crimson as blood flames billowed. Chamberlain Xia was actually burning his own essence blood! When the blood diagram descended, not only did it fail to achieve its intended effect, it acted as nourishment, causing the blood flames to surge.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The black tide and the silver arrow were absorbed into the blood flames, failing to make a ripple. The two figures transformed into a ball of fire, escaping at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Ji Liang's expression changed, a mixture of shock and fury. The opponent had resorted to such desperate measures after only one exchange. This didn't make sense. They clearly still had a way out, and doing so would only weaken themselves, a loss outweighing any gain.</p><p>Could Elder Quan’s judgment be wrong?  Were their companion beasts truly dissipated, and they were already driven to desperation?</p><p>Or were they trying to scare them off with this tactic?</p><p>Regardless, they had to stop them, absolutely preventing their escape. Even with Elder Quan watching, they would undoubtedly lose face, and it might attract the people from the Begonia Academy.</p><p>Thinking of this, Ji Liang sent out a sound transmission. His ears flapped, and gray ripples spread outwards. The ripples moved at incredible speed, expanding above the blood flames.</p><p>Ji Liang himself remained motionless, fully focused on controlling his divine ability. The ripples in the void became increasingly prominent and rapid.</p><p>This wasn't just his power alone. The white-robed figure, transformed into two people, was also manipulating the grand formation with all his might. Two more figures flickered in and out of existence in the void, forming a triangular formation with Ji Liang, surrounding the blood flames.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>The blood flames were at the center of the vortex, waves of ripples pressing down relentlessly.</p><p>No matter how fast the blood flames moved, the vortex persisted, and Chamberlain Xia and the young master couldn't escape its center.  Ji Liang and the white-robed figure's Qi were linked to the ripples, moving along with the vortex.</p><p>In the next instant, the three figures shimmered simultaneously, teleporting closer to the center of the vortex.</p><p>At the same time, the pressure on Chamberlain Xia increased dramatically, his escape speed plummeting.</p><p>As the three continued to flicker, the ripples became almost solid, the pressure at the center of the vortex reaching a terrifying level. The speed of the blood flames slowed further.</p><p>“It’s time to use the Mutual Transformation Technique, isn’t it?”</p><p>Ji Liang stared coldly at the blood flames, not believing Chamberlain Xia would continue to struggle pointlessly.</p><p>As he expected, seeing no way to escape, the momentum of the blood flames faltered. Chamberlain Xia seemed to have ceased burning his essence blood.</p><p>But in the next moment, the blood flames exploded!</p><p>Ji Liang was engulfed in the blood-red light, staring in disbelief at the scene before him. He could sense that, at this moment, Chamberlain Xia had ignited all of his remaining essence blood.</p><p>Within the blood flames.</p><p>The Bone Bird lowered its head, glancing at the Crimson-Feathered Monstrous Bird.  At the center of its brow was a crystal shaped like an eye. The crystal glowed brilliantly red, having devoured almost all of Chamberlain Xia's essence blood.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The Crimson-Feathered Monstrous Bird heard a roar, tears welling in its eyes. It executed the Mutual Transformation Technique and vanished from the spot.</p><p>Simultaneously, the crystal shattered, emitting countless rays of blood-red light, instantly breaking the vortex.  The three figures, unable to dodge, were swallowed by the light.</p><p>The Bone Bird wore an expression of satisfaction.  Unfortunately, it was too weak, and even sacrificing the treasure brought from the clan couldn't completely annihilate the enemy here. However, the most important thing was that the enemy would believe they were unyielding, choosing death over surrender, and that the young master had died alongside him.</p><p>The young master would be able to escape because of this.</p><p>Just as its consciousness was about to fade, the Bone Bird suddenly saw two of the figures, struck by the blood-red light, dissipate like bubbles.</p><p>Something's not right!</p><p>Even if those two were only at the early stage of the second level of the Empty Realm, they shouldn't be so fragile, so utterly defenseless, instantly annihilated.</p><p>Unless…</p><p>The Bone Bird’s pupils dilated abruptly. It suddenly understood, letting out a miserable laugh, an expression of deep despair appearing on its face as it lost consciousness completely.</p><p>()</p>
