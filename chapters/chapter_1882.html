Chapter 1873: Trivial Matters


Learning that Qin Sang intended to stay, Jian Nu said delightedly, "This old slave regularly cleans the True Person's cave abode…"
So saying, he quickly led the way.
Qin Sang shook his head inwardly. Both inside and outside the cave abode were spirit arrays, keeping it spotless. What cleaning was needed?
When he first met Jian Nu, the latter possessed late Nascent Soul cultivation. Now, observing his aura, Jian Nu was merely a step away from Deity Transformation.
In the Storm Realm, such a cultivator would be a hegemon, yet Jian Nu truly saw himself as a servant.  Qin Sang couldn't fathom the depth of gratitude Jian Nu held for True Person Zhi Jian.
Qin Sang refrained from commenting, understanding that Jian Nu's reverence stemmed from his heart towards True Person Zhi Jian, and his kindness towards Qin Sang was merely an extension of that respect.
Arriving outside the cave abode, wondrous flowers and exotic grasses vied for attention, fresh and elegant, just as when he had left.
"Thank you, fellow Daoist," Qin Sang said, cupping his hands in respect.
Jian Nu replied, "You are too kind," and bowed before retreating.
Qin Sang glanced towards True Person Zhi Jian's cave abode, waved his hand to open the restrictive formation, and pushed the door open.
Sitting cross-legged on a meditation cushion, Qin Sang contemplated his next steps. Only after handling these trivial matters could he focus on secluded cultivation.
War was imminent, and the Star Island Immortal Lake might not escape the flames of conflict. He didn't know how many peaceful days remained.
His fingers tapped lightly on his knee. Qin Sang's mind stirred, summoning the Soul Altar.
The Altar's gate swung open, releasing two spirits—the two Demon Marquises he had captured.
*Thump!*
The two demons crashed heavily onto the ground, both bound by restrictions, their senses sealed, as if in deep slumber.
Now only spirits remained, and their manifested forms were those of beasts.
Marquis Gui, of the Gui Hound lineage, might be mistaken for a fox demon at first glance.
The female demon was a beast covered in green scales, shaped like a horse, but with subtle differences upon closer inspection.
*Whoosh! Whoosh!*
Qin Sang flicked his fingers, sending two streams of light into the demons' foreheads.
Their bodies shuddered, and they abruptly awoke. Instinctively, they leaped up, their faces full of vigilance. But seeing Qin Sang before them, and realizing they were only spirits, the memory of the Soul Altar returned, and their expressions crumbled into despair.
Marquis Gui made a swift decision, leaping back to the ground, paws covering his head, prostrating himself before Qin Sang, not daring to move.
The female demon stared blankly for a moment, then sighed deeply, her four hooves planted firmly as she lowered her head.
She remembered Qin Sang's promise not to kill her, but she also knew he wouldn't release her easily.
Both demons adopted a posture of awaiting their fate.
Qin Sang remembered the female demon's title was Marquis Luo. His gaze swept over them as he asked, "Your physical bodies are destroyed. Do you have any means of recovery?"
Demon cultivators valued their physical bodies and bloodline divine abilities above all else. Qin Sang wasn't sure if the demons of this realm had any methods for cultivating their spirits. Otherwise, these two would be of little use.
Hearing his words, the two demons stirred. This tone didn't sound like he intended to kill them.
Could it be…?
Marquis Gui carefully lifted his paws, poking his head out hesitantly before gritting his teeth, "This humble demon has comprehended a lifeblood divine ability. As long as a trace of essence blood remains, there's hope of reconstructing the physical body. When… when the Exalted Immortal shattered this humble demon's body, I secretly used my divine ability to extract some essence blood…"
This clearly wasn't the Ju Mountain Soul Altar, and the Great King hadn't rescued him. Marquis Gui's only hope was shattered.
He didn't want to die. He sensed something else in Qin Sang's words, a glimmer of understanding, and decided to reveal everything, grasping at this single lifeline.
In fact, within the Ghostfang Kingdom, not all demons resisted submission or chose death over servitude.
After all, their ancestors were once the soldiers and steeds of Daoist True Persons.
"Oh?"
Qin Sang scrutinized Marquis Gui with a peculiar gaze, making the demon uneasy.
He hadn't detected anything when he imprisoned Marquis Gui's spirit.
Recalling his previous encounters with Marquis Xia and Marquis Dingxiang, the divine abilities of the demons in this realm were truly profound and unique.
Qin Sang nodded slightly, noncommittal, and then turned to Marquis Luo.
Marquis Luo, despite her rough exterior, possessed a sharp mind. She too guessed Qin Sang's intention to subdue them.
Her expression shifted from joy to worry. She didn't possess a divine ability like Marquis Gui's. "Reporting to Exalted Immortal, this humble demon was originally of the Shadow Horse lineage from the Luo River. A mutation in my bloodline awakened a trace of the Cloud-Soaring Lightning Beast bloodline, leading to my current state.  If I wish to seize a body, it must be a Shadow Horse body that has awakened or is about to awaken the same bloodline. Only then can I hope to regain my peak strength…"
Among the Shadow Horses, awakening the Cloud-Soaring Lightning Beast bloodline was a one-in-ten-thousand occurrence.  At least, she couldn't think of a suitable candidate right now.
After inquiring about the location of the Luo River within the Ghostfang Kingdom, Qin Sang temporarily dismissed the idea of helping her.  He said indifferently, "Are you willing to open your minds and allow this impoverished Daoist to place restrictions upon you? Follow me, and past transgressions will be forgiven. In the future, merits will be rewarded, and crimes will be punished!"
Qin Sang didn't promise any great opportunities, nor did he immediately offer the "Celestial Demon Refining Form."  His tone even carried a chilling coldness.
Hearing this, however, the two demons felt a sense of calm. They exchanged a glance, then kowtowed together. "This humble demon is willing to follow Master."
Having subdued the two demons, Qin Sang gestured towards a corner of the cave and instructed them to cultivate there.
Marquis Luo could only refine her spirit for now, while Marquis Gui manifested his essence blood, beginning the process of restoring his physical body.  They would not hesitate to ask Qin Sang for whatever they needed.
Looking at the two demons, Qin Sang thought, "Including Mo Xingdao, that makes four…"
Four Deity Transformation cultivators weren't enough to brave the Illusionary Storm, and both Mo Xingdao and the two demons were only at the early stage of Deity Transformation.
"War isn't entirely a bad thing. It's a good time to fish in troubled waters and subdue a few more Demon Marquises…"
Qin Sang mused.
Even without cultivating a Soldier Battalion Formation, he could still use the Soul Altar to command troops.
Demon cultivators subdued midway wouldn't be entirely loyal, but as long as they helped him find the path to ascension, their disloyalty was inconsequential.
…
After staying on Sword Heart Island for several days, Qin Sang summoned his flying light and headed towards Pot Island.
Pot Island's defenses were even tighter. Qin Sang passed through several checkpoints before reaching Master Qi's residence.
Master Qi had passed away, but the plaque bearing 'Qi Residence' still hung above the gate.
"Senior is back!"
Seeing Qin Sang, Master Qi's disciples were overjoyed. They immediately went to wake their fellow disciples in seclusion, and the residence bustled with activity.
Master Qi's eldest disciple arrived last, hurrying to Qin Sang's side and presenting a talisman letter.  "Senior, this letter arrived for you not long ago."
Qin Sang accepted it, his divine sense sweeping over the contents.  The signature belonged to Master Gu.
After reading it, Qin Sang frowned, pondering for a moment before storing the letter. He walked towards Master Qi's former fire chamber and instructed the eldest disciple to summon the other disciples.
Although Qin Sang only allowed them to address him as Senior, the disciples still revered him as a master, showing him utmost respect.
Qin Sang didn't disappoint their expectations, examining each one individually.
Master Qi had three true inheritance disciples, all present at the residence. Their talents were inferior to Master Qi's, but they were diligent. In Qin Sang's eyes, they were adequate, capable of maintaining the status quo, but unlikely to restore the Qi Residence to its former glory.
After the examination, Qin Sang kept the three disciples and handed them a jade slip and a storage artifact.  "Take these treasures and exchange them for the spiritual materials listed in the jade slip.  I will remain at the residence for a while. You may observe when I refine artifacts."
The three were ecstatic and immediately accepted the task.
The materials Qin Sang tasked them with collecting were for refining formation artifacts to repair the Flower Field Grand Formation. The principles were interconnected.
With war looming and unrest brewing, many cultivators were exchanging their long-hoarded treasures for life-saving items.
Qin Sang remained at the Qi Residence for a year, successfully refining all the formation artifacts, even faster than anticipated. He also managed to exchange for several precious spiritual materials that could be used to re-refine the Bright Mountain Armor.
The disciples reluctantly saw Qin Sang off.
Leaving Pot Island, Qin Sang flew leisurely over the water, toying with a jade token in his hand.
Taking a teleportation formation to the northern region of Star Island Immortal Lake, he flew north for a while longer until a mist-shrouded spirit island appeared in his view.
This island was much larger than Sword Heart Island, but less spiritually rich, only capable of supporting one Deity Transformation cultivator's cultivation.
In the past, such an island would have an owner, and finding one like this in the Star Island Immortal Lake wouldn't be easy.
With the turbulent situation, cultivators were fleeing into the inner lake for refuge. Qin Sang had rented this island from a sect, paying fifty years' rent upfront.
"Fellow Daoist Mo, you've finally arrived."
Qin Sang landed on the shore and activated the jade token, opening the island's restrictive formation.
The mist parted, revealing a stone path and a stone house. Before his voice had faded, a figure flashed out from the stone house—Mo Xingdao.
"Thanks to the hospitality of that Dire Wolf demon, I couldn't stay there for free. I had to share the burden with my Master.  I helped it clear a few obstacles before departing, which delayed me for some time," Mo Xingdao explained.
Qin Sang had contacted Mo Xingdao a few months prior, instructing him to leave the demon kingdom.
Remaining in the demon kingdom would be inconvenient once the war began, as the Ghostfang Kingdom would undoubtedly tighten its scrutiny.
"Oh?" Qin Sang smiled. "Isn't it already the esteemed National Teacher? What obstacles could there be? Did it aspire to control the entire demon kingdom?"
As he spoke, Qin Sang gestured to Mo Xingdao and walked forward, pointing towards a mountain peak on the island.  "See how Fellow Daoist likes the cave abode I've prepared…"
Mo Xingdao followed, chuckling. "You taught it well. Given more time, and collaborating with the Serpent Demon, it might have actually pulled off a coup and become the monarch."
Seeing Mo Xingdao in good spirits, Qin Sang glanced at him and cupped his hands in congratulations. "Congratulations to Fellow Daoist Mo for overcoming the tribulation and restoring your Deity Transformation cultivation!"
Mo Xingdao's appearance was identical to his previous physical body, with no trace of being a puppet body.
Unexpectedly, Mo Xingdao looked at Qin Sang with a wry smile.
The last time they met, Qin Sang's "Celestial Demon Refining Form" hadn't yet broken through.
Although Qin Sang didn't reveal his Qi and blood, Mo Xingdao could feel the pressure emanating from him, even stronger than before. This could only mean that Qin Sang had further improved, while he himself couldn't comprehend it at all.
The gap between the two, once equals, was widening.
Arriving at a stone pavilion on the island, they sat down casually, and Mo Xingdao couldn't wait to ask, "How did your exploration of the Ju Mountain Soul Altar go?"
Their original plan was for Mo Xingdao to accompany Qin Sang after regaining his cultivation.
Qin Sang sighed and briefly recounted the events at the Soul Altar to Mo Xingdao.
"The rumors were actually true!"
Mo Xingdao murmured. Hidden within the demon kingdom, he had been cut off from information, but had heard many rumors in the past year. He held a sliver of hope, seeking confirmation from Qin Sang, but the truth was worse than he imagined.
He lifted his head, gazing towards the northern sky, looking somewhat lost.
Qin Sang understood Mo Xingdao's feelings and consoled him. "The Great Saint's single strike shouldn't have destroyed the path to ascension. I believe Heaven won't abandon us.  I will exhaust all means possible.  Rest assured, Fellow Daoist Mo."
Mo Xingdao suddenly stood up, bowing deeply to Qin Sang. His voice was hoarse.  "All my hopes rest on you alone. If you have any commands, I will gladly die for you!"
"There's no need for such formality."
Qin Sang shook his head and sighed, helping Mo Xingdao up.
After further discussion, Qin Sang left the jade token controlling the island's restrictive formation with Mo Xingdao and summoned his flying light, leaving the island.
He first returned to Sword Heart Island. Learning that True Person Zhi Jian hadn't yet emerged from seclusion, he left Star Island Immortal Lake and traveled southwest. He visited Venerable Zhenru at New Mirror Terrace Temple to discuss the Sun Wheel Seal.
After staying for a month, he bid farewell to Venerable Zhenru and continued westward.
Arriving at White Stone City, Qin Sang first visited Master Lingxu, presenting a new alchemy formula and retrieving the newly refined Yinghua Pills. Finally, he arrived at the White Stone City Soul Altar, cupping his hands towards the golden-armored guard.  "This impoverished Daoist is Qing Feng, an old acquaintance of True Person Zuo Fengdao. I've come to visit.  Please inform him of my arrival."
The golden-armored guard, initially wary, his eyes lit up upon hearing this.  He sized up Qin Sang.  "True Person Zuo has long instructed us to be on the lookout.  Since you are Daoist Qing Feng, there's no need for an announcement. Please follow me."
Saying this, the golden-armored guard summoned a cloud beneath his feet and gestured for Qin Sang to step on.  He then flew into the air.
Standing on the cloud, Qin Sang looked down, seeing the Merit Courtyard and the Bestowal Courtyard he had visited before.
The cloud didn't stop, flying directly towards the golden halls deep within the Soul Altar.
Qin Sang sensed they passed through several layers of restrictive formations. The view ahead became clearer, revealing a magnificent expanse of golden halls.
This complex was comparable in scale to the Ju Mountain Soul Altar, but without any sense of decay.
As they approached, Qin Sang felt the powerful auras emanating from several of the golden halls, likely the residences of Grand True Persons.
The golden-armored guard appeared accustomed to this, but Qin Sang remained tense.
The cloud descended onto a platform, and the golden-armored guard led Qin Sang on foot to a golden hall before retreating.
True Person Zuo, having received prior notice, stood at the entrance. Seeing Qin Sang, he greeted him with a smile. "Fellow Daoist Qing Feng, it's been a while."
Seeing True Person Zuo personally welcoming him, Qin Sang was flattered. He quickly stepped forward and bowed deeply. "Qing Feng greets Senior Zuo. I've been entangled in trivial matters for the past year and haven't been able to fulfill our agreement in a timely manner. I hope Senior won't blame me."
Qin Sang had intended to wait for True Person Zhi Jian's emergence from seclusion and invite him to visit True Person Zuo together, but he had delayed too long and couldn't wait any longer.
The two entered the hall and sat down.
Qin Sang took out a jade box and presented it. "The Demon Core of King Lingyou is here."
True Person Zuo treated it like an ordinary object, not even opening the box to inspect it, and placed it casually on the table. "The Great Saint's actions caused chaos at the Soul Altar. I was preoccupied with rescuing others and couldn't attend to you.  You weren't injured, were you?"
Qin Sang observed True Person Zuo discreetly, sensing that his aura hadn't changed much since the Soul Altar incident.
This indicated that recovering after severing one's cultivation wasn't easy.
"Thanks to Senior's concern, this junior sensed the danger and found a place to hide.  I suffered no major injuries.  But I wonder about that Divine Court at the end…"
Qin Sang probed cautiously.
"The emergence of the Divine Court was a fabrication, a conspiracy of the Ghostfang Kingdom," True Person Zuo said indifferently, his tone betraying no emotion.
Qin Sang was startled. He hadn't expected this outcome and couldn't guess the Ghostfang Kingdom's true motives.  Seeing that True Person Zuo was unwilling to elaborate, he didn't press further.
True Person Zuo handed Qin Sang a jade slip. "The Dao Court has reached a verdict regarding Fellow Daoist Qing Feng's contributions.  Presenting the Demon Core will fulfill the agreement."
Qin Sang had made contributions and received benefits.  The remaining steps were mere formalities.
While Qin Sang examined the jade slip, True Person Zuo paused and then continued, "Fellow Daoist Qing Feng still remembers what I said before, right?  Your divine ability is most suited for battlefield厮杀, making you a rare and valuable tiger general! If you are willing to serve the Dao Court, I am willing to personally recommend you."
