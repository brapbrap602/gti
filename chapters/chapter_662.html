Chapter 654: Implicated


The Five Venom Sect's main hall had been ravaged by the great battle, its former glory reduced to ruins. The plaza in front of the hall was littered with craters and fissures, scorched by fire and flooded with water, clear evidence of a fierce magical duel.

A deathly silence hung over the hall.

Patriarch Cui Xuanzi, his face etched with grief, gazed silently out at the devastated sect and the corpses of his fellow disciples.

Opposite him stood two middle-aged men, both Nascent Soul realm cultivators.  Each wore a token bearing the character "Li" at their waist.

One, with an air of authority, stood with his hands clasped behind his back.  In his presence, Cui Xuanzi's demeanor seemed noticeably subdued. This was Du Xian.

The other, a burly man named Jiu Shan, sat weakly on a chair, clutching his chest and abdomen.  His face was pale and bloodless, a testament to his severe injuries.

Both were disciples of the Li Wu Palace.

Besides them, another figure lay unconscious on the floor, more grievously injured, yet breathing steadily, his life preserved.

Du Xian, observing Cui Xuanzi's display of sorrow, scoffed.  "Why the theatrics, Patriarch Cui?  They were merely incompetent disciples.  Their deaths are insignificant. Once my junior brother returns with our master and we capture that old ghost Qin and retrieve the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, we'll recommend you for commendation.  With you at the helm and the Li Wu Palace's backing, reviving the Five Venom Sect will be a trivial matter."

Jiu Shan coughed violently, then, regaining his breath, glared at Cui Xuanzi. "You dared defy the Li Wu Palace's command and use a talisman treasure to injure me and my brother! Killing a few of your disciples was letting you off lightly!  If not for my senior brother's intervention, I would have annihilated you!"

Cui Xuanzi clenched his fists, suppressing his rage.  "You used the Li Wu Palace's name to deceive me into opening the sect's gates, only to attack us without provocation! What was I supposed to do, surrender and await death?  The Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was taken by that old ghost Qin long ago. Had you simply asked for it, this battle, and the senseless deaths of my disciples, could have been avoided!"

Du Xian and Jiu Shan exchanged glances, a flicker of embarrassment in their eyes.  They had come for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit, confident in their strength.  Two Nascent Soul cultivators and a retinue whose weakest were at the mid-Foundation Establishment realm, proficient in combined attack formations, had seemed more than enough to subdue the Five Venom Sect.

They hadn't anticipated Cui Xuanzi possessing a talisman treasure. The surprise attack had severely injured Jiu Shan and another disciple.  Fortunately, by the time Cui Xuanzi had prepared the talisman, they had either captured or killed the Five Venom Sect's Foundation Establishment cultivators, leaving Cui Xuanzi alone.

Had they not tricked their way into the sect using the Li Wu Palace's name, the outcome of the battle might have been very different.

But Cui Xuanzi’s claim that the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit was no longer in the Five Venom Sect's possession, having been seized by a Golden Core cultivator, caught them completely off guard.  They had targeted the wrong person.

Du Xian cleared his throat and turned towards the sect gates.  "Where is that Golden Core cultivator's lover hiding? My brother has been gone with your men for a considerable time.  Why haven't they returned?"

Cui Xuanzi snorted. "What's the rush?  That old ghost Qin has several caves in the Bear Mountain region.  She could be hiding in any of them. My disciple Tong can only search them one by one."

Jiu Shan narrowed his eyes, fixing a cold stare on Cui Xuanzi.  "Old man, if you try any more tricks, I will erase the Five Venom Sect from Western Jiang!"

Cui Xuanzi's anger flared.  He gritted his teeth.  "My disciple Tong is restrained by your men, I am trapped here, my sect is occupied, our treasury plundered. What tricks can I possibly play? I am the only Nascent Soul cultivator in the Five Venom Sect.  You've seen my natal insect gu; it's stuck in its second transformation and has no use for the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit. I just took you to Blackwind Valley.  The aroma of a ripe Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit cannot be concealed. As soon as it matured, that old ghost Qin discovered and snatched it. If he were here now, none of you would escape alive!"

"If that Golden Core cultivator were still here, we wouldn't have barged in so recklessly," Du Xian sneered.  "He's a newly formed Golden Core. My master has been at the Golden Core realm for decades and is on the verge of breaking through to mid-Golden Core. Once he arrives, killing him will be child's play.  Give up on the hope of being rescued. Cooperate with us, and you will be rewarded."

Cui Xuanzi fell silent, abandoning the argument.  He lowered his head, his eyes flashing with murderous intent.  He didn't believe a word Du Xian had said. He knew that once Ya Gu was found, he would have no further use and they would kill him to vent their anger. So, when his disciple Tong left to search for Ya Gu, he had subtly instructed him to take detours and delay as much as possible.

Unknowingly, Cui Xuanzi's actions bought Ya Gu valuable time.

Du Xian, seemingly oblivious to Cui Xuanzi's thoughts, turned to Jiu Shan.  "Junior Brother, where did that man go? We need to capture his lover to find out.  Searching for the insect ourselves could take years. Remember how Uncle Qiu spent eight years watching an Ice Toad's nest before almost failing to capture it? We should still be cautious.  It will take at least half a month for you to fetch Master and return. We should find a place to hide during that time, just in case."

The mention of that man wiped the戾qi from Jiu Shan’s face, replacing it with a grave expression.  Despite their confident words, they knew the vast difference between a Nascent Soul cultivator and a true Golden Core.  Even a newly formed Golden Core could easily kill them all.

As Du Xian and Jiu Shan were discussing their plans, they suddenly felt the ground tremble.

Their faces paled. They spun around to face the sect gates just as a dazzling sword beam descended from the sky, slashing down upon the Lotus Grand Formation.

The sword energy crackled like thunder.

The Five Venom Sect's protective formation shuddered violently, cracks spiderwebbing across its surface as the lotus petals began to crumble.

Broken by a single strike!

The roar of the sword's aura echoed through the mountains, the sheer power of the attack chilling the three men to the bone.

"This is..."  Du Xian stammered, aghast.

Cui Xuanzi's mind reeled. He recognized the sword energy.  A strange expression contorted his face. "Why now... why return now... Give me a few more hours! Just a few more hours!"  Regret and despair warred within him.

"The Five Venom Sect is doomed!" he wailed. He collapsed backward, his body hitting the ground with a thud. He had severed his own heart meridian, choosing death over what he believed was inevitable.

Du Xian and Jiu Shan were stunned by Cui Xuanzi's sudden act. Before they could react, a second sword beam descended, shattering the remnants of the Five Venom Sect's protective formation.
