Chapter 1904: Dharma Body


Upon obtaining the token, Qin Sang perceived a faint, unusual fluctuation—a very subtle restriction. Even a Nascent Soul cultivator might overlook it if they weren't careful.  This token was likely part of a formation, but its purpose was difficult to discern from the token alone. The reason it was used as a token was probably so it would resonate with the formation when nearby.  Qin Sang guessed that the father and son hadn't noticed or understood the token's peculiarity before, only knowing its existence without comprehending its function.


This piqued Qin Sang's interest. He decided to stay and addressed the guard captain standing beside him, "Would you be so kind as to make another trip and fetch a Cleansing Ripple Stone and a high-grade Water-attribute magical treasure?"


The young man, his forehead beaded with sweat from anxiety, heard these words and his long-cherished wish was fulfilled. The tension in his heart suddenly eased, and his whole body nearly collapsed to the ground.


The guard captain hesitated to speak, but in the end, he pocketed the spirit stones and left to carry out the order.


Qin Sang carefully inquired about various details. This time, the young man held nothing back, answering every question.


After a considerable exchange, the guard captain returned to the Blessed Abode Market.  He took even longer than when fetching the Purple Origin Pill, making the young man restless.


The guard captain placed a jade casket and a wide-mouthed square cauldron before Qin Sang. Inside the casket was a fist-sized, peculiar round stone, as clear as crystal, with what seemed to be a pool of clear water trapped within.


Qin Sang noticed something unusual and inquired via voice transmission.


Only after the guard captain's explanation did he understand. The Cleansing Ripple Stone wasn't particularly valuable, but it was extremely rare in Cloudrise Mountain.  It would be difficult for others to find a Cleansing Ripple Stone of this quality.


"They are all yours. Take them." Qin Sang gestured for the young man to take the items on the table.


The young man's hands trembled slightly as he picked up the Cleansing Ripple Stone, even more agitated than when he received the Purple Origin Pill.


Too naive after all!


All three present were shrewd and experienced. The young man's performance couldn't escape their discerning eyes.  They could clearly see his intentions. Perhaps the Purple Origin Pill was just a smokescreen, and the Cleansing Ripple Stone was his true goal.


The young man definitely had more secrets!


"I haven't heard of the Cleansing Ripple Stone having any special uses…"  Manager Lu thought to himself, but seeing Qin Sang's indifference as he casually flipped through the golden ledger, and the guard captain standing respectfully at attention, he dismissed the thought and ordered a servant girl to escort the young man away.


Qin Sang selected a few more cave dwellings from the golden ledger and left the Blessed Abode Market.


Without having the guard captain follow him further, Qin Sang wandered alone through the city, interacting with the diverse cultivators of Cloudrise Mountain.


Ignoring the special case of the Talisman Realm, the customs and practices of the Grand Myriad World were very different from the Storm Realm.


One word to describe it: abundant!


Perhaps due to this abundance, or perhaps due to Cloudrise Heaven's wise governance, the cultivators of Cloudrise Heaven didn't possess a heavy aura of hostility.


At the Golden Core realm and below, the Grand Myriad World held a significant advantage. Here, the difficulty of cultivating with dual spiritual roots wasn't much greater than that of a Heaven-blessed single spiritual root genius in the Storm Realm.


Of course, Heaven-blessed single spiritual root cultivators faced no bottleneck when breaking through to the Golden Core realm, a gap that dual spiritual root cultivators couldn't bridge.


If he had been sent to the Grand Myriad World by the Jade Buddha back then, he might not have had to sell himself into servitude for Foundation Establishment, but he also wouldn't have had those thrilling experiences and fortuitous encounters.


Lost in his thoughts, Qin Sang strolled around the city and returned to the grand hall on the sixth floor.


Qin Sang stayed in Cloudburst City for nearly a year, during which he met the City Lord.


When the first batch of Radiant Flower Pills was refined, Qin Sang took the spirit pills and left Cloudburst City.


…


After leaving the city, Qin Sang retraced his steps, flew out of the Cloudrise Mountain range, and continued westward, gradually beginning to see mortal villages.


Flying over several countries, Qin Sang circled briefly above a perilous peak and then transformed into a streak of light, plummeting downwards.


The mountain was surrounded by sheer cliffs, impassable even by apes.


There were several levels on the cliff face, each with houses and refined dwellings. The closer to the summit, the grander the structures became.  At the top were palace buildings and pavilions fit for a mortal emperor, impressive in their splendor, but lacking a touch of tranquility.


However, these magnificent palaces felt devoid of life, like empty houses.


Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura.


As soon as he landed, a streak of light shot up from a palace on the summit, revealing a grey-robed elder.


The elder hovered above the palace, at the edge of the protective formation. Seeing an unfamiliar face, he cupped his hands in greeting and inquired, "May I ask which fellow Daoist has graced us with their presence?  Are you an old acquaintance of one of our Northern Mountain Sect elders?"


Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, producing the Blessed Abode Market's token, and surveyed the mountain below. "It seems your sect has already relocated?"


Seeing the token, the elder understood Qin Sang's intentions, and his tone became more cordial. "Indeed!  Fellow Daoist must have learned about it at the Blessed Abode Market, so I won't bore you with the details… As long as you're willing to purchase it, you can take possession of this Daoist sanctuary immediately!"


Qin Sang questioned, "Relocating an entire sect is quite uncommon.  This Daoist sanctuary wouldn't happen to have any troublesome karmic entanglements, would it?"


The elder shook his head repeatedly. "Our Sect Master was fortunate enough to obtain a Daoist sanctuary in Cloudrise Mountain, which led to the decision to relocate there. Fellow Daoist can inquire about it in Ripplecloud City in Cloudrise Mountain."


During their conversation, Qin Sang silently sensed the flow of the spiritual veins within this mountain and the surrounding mountains.


Now, he could clearly perceive even the subtle spiritual veins underground.


This Daoist sanctuary was quite good, sufficient to support the cultivation of an entire sect, including Nascent Soul cultivators. If the Northern Mountain Sect's asking price wasn't so high, it would have been sold long ago.


Furthermore, this mountain was hidden within the mortal realm, which also satisfied Qin Sang's need for secluded cultivation.


An image of the surrounding spiritual veins and terrain appeared in Qin Sang's mind.  The quality of a cave dwelling or Daoist sanctuary was also closely related to the owner's abilities.  The Northern Mountain Sect's formations were too crude and didn't fully utilize the potential of the location.


Geomancy and Feng Shui were also profound studies in the cultivation world.


If arranged properly, with superior methods of regulating the earth's veins, it could even allow the Daoist sanctuary to improve year by year, achieving the effect of 'nourishing the dragon.'


Qin Sang, having been a sect master himself, was well-versed in these arts.


If he personally took action, setting up grand formations, relocating spiritual veins, and gathering the spiritual essence of the surrounding mountains, he could further enhance this place, making it suitable for Spirit Transformation cultivators.


But such actions would create too much commotion, and this place lacked a solid foundation.  Even at its peak, it would only be suitable for consolidating one's foundation.  For true cultivation, he would still need to find another location.


It could only serve as a second-best option.


After conversing with the elder for a while, Qin Sang bid farewell and departed.


In the mortal realm, this was the only location Qin Sang had selected.


Leaving the Northern Mountain Sect, he flew north, the cities, mountains, and rivers below receding at an astonishing pace.


Gradually, signs of human habitation thinned out again, and Qin Sang faintly sensed a scorching aura emanating from ahead.


In the north, besides the young man's location, Qin Sang had also chosen two cave dwellings. The rest were all in the Twilightfall Mountain Range.


The scenery here was vastly different from Cloudrise Mountain.


Not long after leaving the areas inhabited by mortals, Qin Sang saw a towering pillar of fire.  Scalding magma continuously erupted, billowing black smoke blotting out the sky.


The underground here wasn't entirely occupied by raging flame veins, but the scorching aura resulted in an exceptionally desolate landscape, full of barren mountains, deserts, and gravel plains.


Mortals couldn't possibly survive here.


This place had the most abundant fire spiritual energy. As long as one could withstand the exceptionally violent spiritual energy, it was a sacred ground for cultivating fire-attribute techniques.


The further north he flew, the more desolate it became.  Rivers of magma crisscrossed the land, and erupting volcanoes were a common sight. It wasn't quite as extreme as the storm belt between the Central Continent and the Western Lands, but it wasn't far off either.


Soon, Qin Sang found his first target. The cave dwelling was located within a dormant volcano.


The owner of the cave dwelling was a Nascent Soul cultivator who, upon seeing Qin Sang, was exceptionally enthusiastic, praising the cave dwelling profusely and expressing deep regret at having to sell it for the sake of medicinal pills.


His acting was superb, almost flawless, and his asking price wasn't high.


Unfortunately, Qin Sang saw through him at a glance. The cave dwelling itself was far from the quality he boasted, its appearance maintained by a special type of illusionary formation.


For a Nascent Soul cultivator to resort to such deception was truly shameful.


If this person hadn't harbored any malicious intent to rob or kill, Qin Sang wouldn't have merely given him a slight punishment.


Arriving at the next location, Qin Sang couldn't find the cave dwelling.


After flying around for a while, he finally noticed something amiss.


This place had once been the confluence of several large flame veins. Judging by the signs, an eruption had occurred recently.


Presumably, the owner sensed the disturbance in the flame veins and knew the cave dwelling wouldn't last much longer, so they abandoned it, hoping to make a profit before leaving. This was practically no different from robbing and killing.


"The decline of morality!" Qin Sang shook his head repeatedly, lamenting the situation.


Judging by the remaining traces, this place had been an excellent choice. If he had arrived earlier, he would have had a way to suppress the flame veins.


"Hopefully, the next one won't disappoint me…"


Qin Sang discerned the direction and flew westward for over three thousand li. He took out the token, and a resonance quickly emerged.


Following the guidance, Qin Sang descended upon the banks of a magma river.  The magma in the river had dried up, and the riverbed was filled with black volcanic rock, cracks faintly glowing red.


The target was underground.


Standing there, Qin Sang could already sense the subterranean sea of magma, with fire spirits frolicking within, some even at the Nascent Soul level.


Unless the young man's father could invite a Nascent Soul cultivator, it would be impossible to clear out so many fire spirits.  At most, they could try to evade the fire spirits' detection and sneak in.


Qin Sang held the token, carefully sensing.


"Still at the bottom of the magma…"


He was about to descend through a fissure when he suddenly stopped. His figure flickered, and a radiant light appeared above his head. A surge of pure Qi erupted upwards, pausing mid-air before transforming into a human figure.


This figure had the same features and demeanor as Qin Sang—it was his Dharma Body.


When breaking through to Soul Formation, Qin Sang hadn't taken the conventional path, and he still hadn't fully grasped the wonders of his Dharma Body.


Consolidating his cultivation involved revisiting the process of his breakthrough and comprehending the insights he had overlooked.


Qin Sang's physical body looked up, and his Dharma Body looked down.  Their four eyes met, each seeing themselves, a rather peculiar sensation.


The Dharma Body was the manifestation of a Soul Formation cultivator's True Essence. In a sense, it could be considered as nurtured by the Nascent Soul.


Recalling the moment of his breakthrough…


At the instant he broke through the bottleneck, his Nascent Soul suddenly expanded to the size of a human body, thereby attracting the world's spiritual energy, and his understanding of the Dao of Heaven and Man entered a new realm.


The Dharma Body leaving the physical body was akin to Nascent Soul projection, but it wasn't as fragile as the Nascent Soul.


The Dharma Body carried the cultivator's True Essence, allowing them to manipulate the world's spiritual energy.  Without even the need for the Divine Soul to leave the body, the power of divine sense could extend outwards, unobstructed, to cast Daoist techniques, wield spiritual treasures, and battle enemies just like the true body.


This way, the cultivator didn't have to reveal themselves. They could summon their Dharma Body to fight while their true body remained hidden, undetectable to the enemy!


If the Dharma Body was injured, it only needed to return to the main body to recuperate for a period to fully recover.


However, there were still risks. If the Dharma Body was destroyed, even if the cultivator didn't die, their Dao Foundation would be severely damaged, causing excruciating pain.


However, upon sensing the impending destruction of the Dharma Body, within a certain range, they could also directly execute the Return to Origin technique, dispersing the Dharma Body and returning to the true body, thereby escaping disaster.


This technique was actually demonstrated as early as the Nascent Soul stage, in the form of the Nascent Soul's instantaneous teleportation.


Qin Sang had experimented, and with his current abilities, the range of Return to Origin could reach a thousand li, and it would extend further as his foundation solidified.


This showed how difficult it was to kill a Soul Formation cultivator.


In addition, the Dharma Body had countless uses, making it perfectly suited for scouting.


This current location wasn't dangerous enough to warrant such caution from Qin Sang, but he did this to better familiarize himself with his Dharma Body.


The true body slipped into a fissure and sat in meditation.


The Dharma Body raised its hands, examining itself for a moment. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly landed on its shoulder.


*Whoosh! Whoosh!*


Snowflakes fluttered.


The surrounding temperature plummeted.


The Dharma Body held the Four Serpent Seal.  Four azure serpents emerged from the seal's knob, swimming playfully in the Dharma Body's palm.


The Dharma Body gathered the cold air, as if holding a miniature snow realm in its hand, then passed through the fissure and entered the underground.


The next moment, its vision was filled with blinding red light, and a wave of scorching heat washed over it.


The fire spirits were still frolicking, completely unaware of the arrival of the uninvited guest.


Qin Sang didn't bother eliminating these fire spirits.  After a brief observation, the Dharma Body sank directly into the magma.


The sensation of magma flowing past was incredibly vivid, no different from if his true body were present.


It continued descending for hundreds of li, yet it still hadn't reached the bottom of the magma.


Meanwhile, the token in the Dharma Body's hand grew increasingly hot, shining even brighter than the magma.


The Dharma Body raised a finger and gently tapped the token.


The token hummed and trembled, and a rune, red as fire, suddenly appeared at its center.


Firelight flowed within the rune, slowly turning in one direction.


"There!"


The Dharma Body flew in that direction, traveling for another fifty li or so. The token's vibrations intensified, as if struggling to break free and return to its source.


Here, both Qin Sang and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly detected an anomaly below.


Just as Qin Sang had predicted, there was a spiritual formation here.


"Hmm? This formation seems rather complex, but…"


The Dharma Body glanced around, then swept forward diagonally for a hundred zhang before abruptly stopping and pressing its palm downwards.


With the Dharma Body as the dividing line, a fault appeared in the magma. The magma below continued to sink, while the magma above seemed to be supported by a barrier, holding up a hundred li of molten rock.


After a while, a strange red glow and some peculiar outlines emerged on the surface of the magma below.


Taking all of this in, the Dharma Body shook its head slightly. "Indeed, an ancient formation, but what a pity…"


Finding an ancient formation was usually cause for celebration, as one might be fortunate enough to obtain the inheritance and treasures of ancient cultivators.


Unfortunately, this formation was damaged, greatly diminishing its value.


However, Qin Sang's goal was to find a cave dwelling, so he wasn't particularly disappointed.  He selected a weak point in the formation and slipped inside.

Took a trip, got back late.
