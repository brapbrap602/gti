<h1>Chapter 1587:  A Change of Heart</h1><p>Chapter 1587:  A Change of Heart</p><p>After some intimidation and manipulation, the disciple of the Scarred-Faced Man willingly let his Nascent Soul leave his body.  He was easily captured.</p><p>A sword formation trapped the Nascent Soul.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed into position above, calmly setting up several restrictions to seal the Nascent Soul.  Just as he was about to capture it and flee, the disciple's eyes suddenly locked, his gaze clouded with a grey light.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Nascent Soul emanated a decaying, withered aura from within. Life force drained from its core. The disciple instantly wilted.</p><p>This scene reminded Qin Sang of the Senluo Withering Prison technique the Scarred-Faced Man used against his avatar.</p><p>Qin Sang knew something was wrong. He quickly cast spells, shooting a beam of light into the Nascent Soul’s forehead to try and stop the decay, only to find the deathly aura stemmed from its very soul and was unstoppable from the outside.</p><p>In an instant, the Nascent Soul dried up, becoming like bark, its expression one of death. Before its final breath, a strange glint appeared in its grey eyes—clearly not under the disciple’s own control.  The eyes moved slightly, as if trying to discern its enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang gave up on saving the man, and with a pointed finger, unleashed a heavenly thunderbolt, reducing the Nascent Soul to ashes.</p><p>“Such a devoted master!” Qin Sang sneered.</p><p>Earlier, during the tidal surge, the Scarred-Faced Man had used a wooden construct to protect his disciple. Qin Sang had assumed this was a favored, close disciple, and had decided to capture him to search his soul and uncover the Scarred-Faced Man’s background and strength.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Scarred-Faced Man had already planted a restriction within his disciple. It activated the moment the Nascent Soul was restrained, leaving no opportunity for soul-searching, before it could even be attempted.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to collect the disciple’s storage pouch and leave the body to be swept away by the tide.</p><p>At that moment, the Sky-Eye Butterfly issued a warning: the Scarred-Faced Man, sensing something, was rushing towards them.</p><p>Simultaneously, another figure approached from a different direction.  This person didn't seem to be a mere passerby; they moved with ease amidst the turbulent tide, indicating considerable cultivation.</p><p>Did the Scarred-Faced Man have other accomplices?</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  He’d been considering confronting the Scarred-Faced Man personally but abandoned the idea and vanished into the depths of the tide.</p><p>Shortly after, two figures appeared where the disciple had perished, one after the other.</p><p>Compared to his appearance in Nan Zhou, the Scarred-Faced Man’s scars were lighter, revealing more normal features, making him less terrifying.</p><p>He surveyed the area, his right arm gradually turning woody. His fingers spread, emanating a green aura representing life. Tiny buds sprouted from his skin, rapidly growing into countless fine blades of grass, each as thin as a hair. They formed a green, fuzzy coat that swayed gently, spreading in all directions.</p><p>The Scarred-Faced Man closed his eyes, trying to use this technique to sense residual energy from the fight. Unfortunately, the surging tide had obliterated all traces.</p><p>Finding nothing, the Scarred-Faced Man withdrew his technique, his expression grim.</p><p>The other person had remained at the periphery until the Scarred-Faced Man finished, then approached and stood beside him.  Clad in black robes that concealed their face and shrouded in black mist, they were quite mysterious.</p><p>The robed figure asked indifferently, “Your disciple is dead?”</p><p>The Scarred-Faced Man coldly grunted without replying.</p><p>“I warned you… how much did he know? If someone captured him and revealed your identity, you know the consequences,” the robed figure said with dissatisfaction.</p><p>“If I dared let him know, I wouldn’t fear exposure!” The Scarred-Faced Man retorted coldly. “This matter is settled.  I need fifty years of seclusion.”</p><p>“Didn’t you say ten years would suffice? Why so long? The Ullambana festival will be over in fifty years!”</p><p>The robed figure showed displeasure.  After a pause, they chuckled, suddenly realizing something. “I’ve always wondered how you could train such a disciple… with your cunning, you wouldn’t only have one plan, would you? This is crucial. You must leave seclusion before the Ullambana festival to find the other five phase tokens. I’ll secretly help you.”</p><p>The Scarred-Faced Man was impatient. “Those who inherit the five lineages will seek me out upon seeing the pattern on the Gu God Token. There’s no need for so much trouble. If no one comes, the lineage must be broken.  Where would we find the phase tokens then?”</p><p>“The Buddhist and Taoist sects see the inheritors of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect as thorns in their side. If that lineage has fallen, and its inheritor is not strong enough, they would not dare to appear. Or perhaps someone is deliberately hiding in the shadows, harboring ulterior motives.  As long as they become active, they will inevitably leave traces that you cannot miss.”</p><p>A robed figure flattered the other, pausing before saying gravely, "Neither of us wishes to forever remain in the shadows, unable to show our true faces. What belongs to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect is ours to reclaim.  This Ullambana Festival is a rare opportunity; we must cooperate fully."</p><p>The grotesque-faced man smirked. "If we're cooperating fully, why your reluctance to my previous message?  Unending Mountain is closed, when will you help me attack Zhuozhou and seize the treasure? I'll give you your share."</p><p>The tide of grey energy was nearing its end.</p><p>The robed figure observed the surroundings, saying, "You mean the Xie family ancestor of Pu Mountain in Zhuozhou?  Unless we capture him alive and extract the *Tongbao Jue*, what use is the treasure to me? Since we're both in Zhuozhou, and Unending Mountain is closed, can't we support Pu Mountain? The Xie family ancestor has a deep friendship with Lu Zhang, and Si Tu Yu places great trust in Lu Zhang. If we act, Si Tu Yu will surely intervene. Si Tu Yu rose to fame in a single battle, and since taking over as the leader of Unending Mountain, the Dragon Residence Heaven's influence in Zhuozhou has been repeatedly cut, suffering quite a few setbacks. His abilities are clear. Unless Si Tu Yu falls, or you're absolutely certain you can easily breach the protective mountain formation, kill the Xie family ancestor, and erase all traces, we risk exposure. The Ullambana Festival is approaching; let's avoid unnecessary complications. If we're noticed by the Eight Views Pavilion or the Ganlu Monastery, we'll suffer a great loss for a small gain. Once we succeed, we can take whatever we want!"</p><p>The grotesque-faced man only sneered at the robed figure's earnest advice.</p><p>The robed figure sighed helplessly, making a promise, "There's an ancient Chi Xuan tree in the Tianhao Tower; I'll do my best to get it for you."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>...</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang used the same tactic, employing the Sky Eye Butterfly for distant observation, but unable to hear their conversation.</p><p>The grey tide gradually subsided.</p><p>Thinking the unrest within the Wuwang Palace would calm for a while, unexpectedly, another unforeseen change occurred after the grey tide.</p><p>A storm raged on the sea.</p><p>The grey tide had pushed the storm's power to its peak; huge waves crashed, affecting nearby islands, injuring several cultivators.</p><p>The island's vegetation was uprooted, the ground stripped bare, the land collapsing in a devastating spectacle.</p><p>But after this strongest wave, cultivators discovered that the turbulent storm was contracting; the Wuwang Palace was closing!</p><p>No one expected the Wuwang Palace ruins to open for such a short time.</p><p>Trapped in the Wuwang Palace, facing certain death.</p><p>Immediately, the cultivators inside the Wuwang Palace ruins, having just experienced the grey tide, frantically fled.</p><p>Su Zinan was no exception.</p><p>Qin Sang was still considering whether to follow the grotesque-faced man or continue following Su Zinan, but now there was no need to think anymore; escape was the priority!</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Various escape lights burst from the turbulent currents. Those who persevered were mostly Yuan Ying masters, but they displayed no Yuan Ying composure, all looking haggard and injured.</p><p>They scanned their surroundings, unanimously searching for Su Zinan, urgently needing an explanation.</p><p>The opening of the Wuwang Palace ruins was abruptly cut short; they not only gained nothing, but suffered a great loss during the grey tide.</p><p>The entrance to the ruins rapidly narrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang used his thunder escape technique, bursting from the ruins, then putting away his phoenix wings, flying out of the turbulent currents.  He didn't immediately leave, instead quietly landing on a nearby island.</p><p>The island's cultivators remained completely unaware of his presence.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up into the sky.</p><p>Moments later, the grotesque-faced man and the robed figure flew out of the turbulent currents.  These two were indeed secretive, deliberately using secret techniques to conceal themselves.</p><p>Of course, their actions couldn't escape the Sky Eye Butterfly's sight.</p><p>However, it wasn't prudent to openly follow such powerful cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced in the direction of their escape, remaining where he was, still watching the entrance to the Wuwang Palace, waiting for Su Zinan to emerge.</p><p>He felt that Su Zinan's motives were not so simple.</p><p>Before entering, did Su Zinan know nothing of the changes within the ruins?  To expend such great effort, to open the Wuwang Palace with such fanfare, only to wander around the periphery?</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>The black hole high in the sky reappeared, still spewing out turbulent currents, but as the black hole narrowed, the affected area decreased.</p><p>Most cultivators had successfully escaped.</p><p>Escape lights became increasingly rare.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>Three escape lights appeared from the black hole; one was Su Zinan.</p><p>After they escaped, a few more cultivators flew out, until the black hole completely closed.</p><p>Even Yuan Ying cultivators couldn't guarantee their safety inside the Wuwang Palace ruins.</p><p>It is unknown if anyone failed to escape in time and perished.</p><p>The last surge of chaotic energy rushed into the sea, its momentum spent, and was swallowed by the waves.</p><p>The strange phenomena caused by the ruins subsided.  Instantly, the sky cleared, the sun shone brightly, and the sea and sky were calm, without a trace of the previous chaos.</p><p>The Wu Wang Palace ruins had vanished, leaving behind only a few disfigured islands as a testament to its existence.</p><p>Su Zi Nan hovered in mid-air.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao, the Crying Spirit Cave Master, and others Su Zi Nan had invited for assistance, gradually approached him.</p><p>Glancing at those around him, Su Zi Nan's face suddenly darkened.</p><p>A murmur arose from the onlookers.</p><p>Su Zi Nan, clad in white, had journeyed south into Central Plains, with two Yuan Ying-stage Ming Yue Guards as protection. Now, one was missing!</p><p>One Ming Yue Guard had perished in the Wu Wang Palace; Su Zi Nan's expedition had clearly been a net loss.</p><p>Su Zi Nan forced out a drop of his essence blood, drawing a blood talisman in mid-air, then pressed his hand lightly upon it.</p><p>The talisman glowed brightly, transforming into a beam of blood light, but it swayed back and forth in the air, unable to sense the location of the other Ming Yue Seal.</p><p>The waters here were vast; only the Wu Wang Palace could block the sensing.</p><p>Whether the guard was injured by the Gray Tide or murdered, it remained a mystery, leaving the Ming Yue Guard's disappearance an unsolved case.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>Enraged, Su Zi Nan shattered the blood talisman with a palm strike.</p><p>The others fell silent.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao stood quietly beside Su Zi Nan, his expression unchanged, calm as a still pond.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master sighed, “Su Dao You, please accept my condolences.”</p><p>“It was their fate; death is nothing to lament.”</p><p>Suppressing his anger, Su Zi Nan said calmly, looking up at the empty void, lost in thought.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master consoled him, “This failure was due to an inadequate prediction of the variables within the Wu Wang Palace; it was not a defeat in battle.  What are your plans, Dao You Su? When will you explore the Wu Wang Palace again?”</p><p>Before the words were finished, a rapid sound of air breaking echoed from the horizon.</p><p>Drawn by the sound, everyone looked in that direction and were surprised to see a snow-white crane approaching.</p><p>Yuan Ying cultivators quickly discerned the unusual nature of this.</p><p>“It’s ‘Crane Soaring Through the Nine Heavens,’ one of the Eight Scenic Arts!”</p><p>“Such speed, such mastery! Few possess this level of skill among the Eight Scenery… Could it be Crane Gao Zhen Ren?”</p><p>“It is him!”</p><p>…</p><p>In a blink, the crane arrived, stopping abruptly before Su Zi Nan. Its wings folded, a puff of white smoke rose, transforming into a long-bearded Daoist.</p><p>“Hmm? It's him!”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled an encounter before entering the Central Plains.</p><p>Years ago, he was chased by ferocious beasts.  As he was fleeing, an Eight Scenery cultivator appeared, drawing away the beasts and leaving a warning, using this very technique.</p><p>Qin Sang later confirmed this person to be Crane Gao Zhen Ren, of the Eight Scenery.</p><p>In the Eight Scenery, below the level of Transcendental Transformation, his status was second only to the Sect Master, Purple Thunder Zhen Ren.</p><p>“Zhen Ren, you are late.”</p><p>A flicker of unusual emotion crossed Su Zi Nan's eyes as he spoke calmly.</p><p>Crane Gao Zhen Ren, with a thin, long face, an ancient countenance, and eyes as sharp as swords, first looked upward, then bowed to Su Zi Nan.  “I apologize for the intrusion, Dao You Su. Could you tell me how to find the Wu Wang Palace?”</p><p>Su Zi Nan patted his storage pouch, and several broken pieces of wood flew out. “I told you, Zhen Ren, you are too late. My foster father left a marker in the Wu Wang Palace, which could be used with an array to remotely locate it. Unfortunately, this marker is only usable once.  I do not possess my foster father's divine abilities to recreate it.”</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Crane Gao Zhen Ren frowned deeply, “Only once? Dao You, why were you so reckless? Why didn't you consult us first?”</p><p>Su Zi Nan flew into a rage. “My foster father's legacy; I can use it however I please!  What business is it of yours? I've heard that you all rely on your power to bully others, and those in Central Plains dare not speak out. Others may fear you, but I do not!”</p><p>With an angry snort, Su Zi Nan loudly questioned, “I personally visited Dan Yu Zhen Jun to inquire about his entry into the Wu Wang Palace, seeking his guidance, but you were evasive and refused me entry. Now you act deferential; what is the reason for this?”</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder.</p><p>Every cultivator in the area could clearly hear him.</p><p>Even knowing that Su Zi Nan was speaking outlandishly in public, Crane Gao Zhen Ren couldn't refute him, his face alternating between red and pale.</p><p>Ignoring Crane Gao Zhen Ren's expression, Su Zi Nan turned and left with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p>Su Zi Nan and his party disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>The cultivators below did not leave, their expressions varied. They pondered Su Zi Nan's words and secretly observed Crane Gao Zhen Ren.</p><p>Crane Gao Zhen Ren remained silent for a long time before departing, his face still ashen.</p><p>He didn’t relent his angry countenance until he was out of sight.</p><p>Only then did the anger on Crane Gao Zhen Ren's face completely disappear. He glanced at the direction Su Zi Nan had fled, his expression calm, as he gracefully flew away.</p>
