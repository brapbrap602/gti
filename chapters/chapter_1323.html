Chapter 1315: A Waste of a Divine Treasure!


A white figure flashed and appeared behind the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet.  
He stared intently at the puppet, not uttering a word. His eyes shone with a strange light, as if they could pierce through the puppet's body, revealing an unfathomable depth.  
Seeing this, Qin Sang held back his curiosity and quietly observed Bai's actions.  
After a moment, Bai suddenly raised a hand and pressed it against the puppet's back. A peculiar ripple emanated from his palm and seeped into the puppet's body.  

"Roar!"  
The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet let out a fierce roar.  
Whatever Bai had done, the seals on the puppet were undone.  
The runes on its body flickered, and its expression instantly turned ferocious. It twisted its head, filled with madness and bloodlust, as if it were about to pounce on Bai.  
Qin Sang furrowed his brow but refrained from acting.  
Given Bai's strength, he should be able to handle the puppet.  
Qing Jun opened her mouth, about to warn Bai to be cautious of the puppet's backlash, when she suddenly heard Bai let out a cold snort. With two fingers, he forcefully tapped the puppet's forehead.  

"Whoosh!"  
A streak of blood light entered the puppet's body.  
The puppet's figure suddenly stiffened. Its ferocious expression remained, but the madness in its eyes receded like a tide, calming down in an instant.  
A flicker of surprise passed through Qing Jun's eyes.  
She could sense that the restless soul within the puppet had suddenly quieted down, though she couldn't tell whether it had been soothed or suppressed. She couldn't discern what secret technique Bai had used.  
Both she and Qin Sang needed the help of puppet seals to achieve such control, far from Bai's effortless mastery.  
Qing Jun glanced at Qin Sang.  
Qin Sang shook his head slightly, equally unable to guess Bai's intentions.  
The two of them decided to wait and see.  

After suppressing the puppet, Bai pressed his palm downward, and the puppet obediently followed his command, sitting cross-legged on the ground. Bai then sat in front of the puppet, his fingers pressed against its forehead, his eyes closed.  
An hour passed in the blink of an eye.  
Bai and the puppet remained motionless.  
Qin Sang had already downed several pots of peach blossom wine, savoring its sweet and refreshing taste, completely unaware that his senior sister was glaring at him with wide eyes.  
Later, Qing Jun directly sealed the wooden house where the wine was stored, cutting off his supply.  
They didn't dare disturb Bai, only sensing the fluctuations in the puppet's aura. For such a long time, Bai had been searching for something within the puppet.  
Another hour passed.  

Bai withdrew his fingers and opened his eyes, glaring fiercely at the puppet. He cursed angrily, "Ignorant fools! What a waste of a divine treasure! What a waste!"  
For the sake of this Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, Bai had lost his composure twice.  
He let out an angry snort, stood up, and tossed the puppet back to Qin Sang. Then he plopped down on a wooden chair, muttering, "I've lost my composure. My apologies for letting you two witness that."  

The sealed puppet was now only the size of a palm.  
Qin Sang held it in his hand, playing with it. He could tell that Bai's earlier curses were directed at the person who had crafted the puppet.  
The ancestors of the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace had created a puppet with strength comparable to a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, yet in Bai's eyes, they were nothing but ignorant fools.  

"Brother Bai, you hold this puppet in such high regard. Its materials must be extraordinary," Qin Sang remarked. He had suspected as much earlier.  
Bai nodded. "It was only after seeing the puppet that some of my memories were triggered. I never expected to encounter something like this here. If it truly is the legendary treasure I think it is, I could easily shed my corpse body and return to being a normal human!"  

Qin桑 was stunned.  
He knew Bai had always wanted to escape the path of the undead. In Bai's eyes, the undead path was a heretical practice. But first, he had been trapped by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, and later, to advance to the Corpse King stage, he had cultivated bone curses. It was a path from which there was no return.  
No wonder Bai was so excited.  
The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet actually had such miraculous effects!  

"This puppet was crafted from an extremely rare spiritual root of heaven and earth—a complete divine tree," Bai explained, his eyes filled with complexity. "This divine tree is called the Dao Manifestation Tree. Though it is not listed among the Ten Great Divine Trees, in Daoist legends, it is said to surpass even them!"  

"The Dao Manifestation Tree?"  
Qin桑 turned the small puppet over in his hands. It didn't look like wood, yet it wasn't entirely unlike it. Its surface had a glossy sheen, warm and smooth to the touch.  
How could this possibly be a tree?  
The name "Dao Manifestation Tree" alone sounded extraordinary.  
As Qin桑 examined the puppet, a thought crossed his mind: Could he merge it with his Ebony Wood Sword?  

Bai seemed to read his thoughts and snorted. "Even among the Ten Great Divine Trees, not all are suitable for crafting artifacts. The legends about the Dao Manifestation Tree are vague because few have ever seen it. It is said that a mature Dao Manifestation Tree serves as the best medium and vessel for certain peerless Daoist divine abilities, offering twice the results with half the effort. You can imagine how astonishing its value is! And it has another function, one that I have long dreamed of. The Dao Manifestation Tree is a rare spiritual embryo of heaven and earth. Wandering souls and wild ghosts can use it to reincarnate without losing their cultivation, gaining a spiritual body of the Dao Tree, along with countless other unpredictable benefits! The reason this puppet can seal souls within it is precisely because of this."  

Qin桑 and Qing Jun were both dumbfounded, staring at the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet in disbelief. They never expected this unremarkable little puppet to have such an incredible origin.  
The peerless Daoist divine abilities Bai spoke of were far beyond the level of mere Nascent Soul cultivators—they were on a plane they couldn't even imagine.  
As for the spiritual embryo of heaven and earth, they had never even heard of such a thing.  
Qin桑 hadn't expected that his initial goal of thwarting Dongyang Bo's plans would lead him to stumble upon such a rare treasure.  

Where had the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace obtained the Dao Manifestation Tree?  
Qin桑 guessed it must have come from either the Purple Micro Palace or some ancient battlefield ruins. It couldn't possibly have grown in the present world.  
To use such a treasure to craft a Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was truly a waste.  

The treasure hadn't clouded Qin桑's judgment. He caught the underlying meaning in Bai's words and asked, "Is this an immature Dao Manifestation Tree?"  
Bai nodded. "A mature Dao Manifestation Tree nurtured by heaven and earth stands three feet tall. Yours is far from that."  

"Can it be further nurtured?"  
Qin桑 began to fantasize, though he regretted that the Three Lights Jade Liquid had already been used up. Otherwise, he could have tried.  

"Don't get your hopes up," Bai said, his tone still tinged with frustration. "Do you know that the Dao Manifestation Tree has another characteristic called the 'Unblemished Body'? Its true form is the purest thing in the world. Once its body is tainted by any other secret technique or power, even the slightest bit, it will solidify irreversibly. Such treasures are envied by heaven itself! Throughout history, heaven and earth may have birthed many Dao Manifestation Trees, but whether even one has ever matured is unknown."  

"This..."  
Qin桑 was stunned, finally understanding why Bai was so furious.  
The Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet had first been branded with talisman seals, then infused with countless souls, and now transformed into a puppet seal by him and Qing Jun. It was already beyond recognition.  
A divine spiritual root of heaven and earth, reduced to nothing more than a puppet—truly a waste of a divine treasure.  

Qin桑 looked at the puppet, his eyes filled with complexity. It was hard to say how much disappointment he felt.  
After all, given his current level of understanding and cultivation, he couldn't even begin to estimate the value of a mature Dao Manifestation Tree or the immense benefits it could bring him.
