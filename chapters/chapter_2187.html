<h1>Chapter 2177: The Undefiled Heart Lamp</h1><p>A rift tore open in the sky.</p><p>Simultaneously, similar sights appeared throughout the Sacred Land, giving the impression that the Sacred Land was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the horizon, seeing a similar fissure in the distant sky.</p><p>“It seems this isn’t just happening here; it's likely a great upheaval affecting the entire Sacred Land…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>The three of them stared intently at the rift above. After a moment, their expressions turned peculiar. They exchanged glances, a possibility forming in their minds.</p><p>Liao Chen muttered, “This aura… it’s like…”</p><p>“It’s the aura of the Mist Sea.  It seems this rift leads outside the Sacred Land!” Qin Sang watched the depths of the fissure, stating.</p><p>He vaguely saw faint white vapor spreading, mist seeping in from the outside. That aura was distinctly different from the Sacred Land.</p><p>“Could this be the gateway out of the Sacred Land?”</p><p>Liuli exclaimed, surprised.  Both she and Qin Sang had only recently entered the Sacred Land and were uncertain.</p><p>“It might be a gateway, or it could be the beginning of the Sacred Land’s collapse,” Qin Sang turned to Liao Chen, “What is your opinion, Abbot?”</p><p>After a certain period, the Sacred Land trials would open a gateway. Some severely injured cultivators, or those who had already obtained their desired benefits and wished to avoid further conflict, would choose to leave the Sacred Land.</p><p>However, this situation was unprecedented.</p><p>Most of the time, the gateways out of the Sacred Land were hidden, gradually discovered over time. Sometimes, due to special rules, the gateways were scarce, becoming a key point of contention among various factions.</p><p>The gateway opening so quickly and being directly exposed in the sky was unheard of.</p><p>This further proved that a cataclysmic change was affecting the entire Sacred Land.</p><p>Liao Chen pondered, shaking his head. “Regardless, for the cultivators within the Sacred Land, this is undoubtedly the best opportunity to escape.”</p><p>“I will not leave!” Qin Sang firmly declared.</p><p>Mount Taiyu had not yet recovered, and he remained uninjured, retaining his peak combat strength. He had not revealed his great abilities before the grey figures, his situation far better than most. There was no reason for him to give up now.</p><p>Liuli could not give up either; the Heart Lake Secret Realm was crucial to her tribulation.</p><p>Liao Chen gazed at the fissure, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that as the fissure appeared, the radiant light was surging. Everywhere, above and below, the radiant light was omnipresent.  If this continued for much longer, the entire Sacred Land would likely become a bizarre and chaotic world.</p><p>As time passed, the fissure stopped expanding and began to slowly close, seeming to seal the gateway.</p><p>At that moment, Liao Chen’s eyelids drooped, as if he had made a decision. He clasped his hands together and sighed softly, “Junior Sister, Qin Zhenren, forgive this monk for being unable to continue our journey together.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression shifted slightly, “Abbot, you intend to leave the Sacred Land?”</p><p>Liao Chen nodded.  “If this situation continues, I fear there will be no time left for me to recover my injuries. Forcibly staying would only hinder you both. In my view, Qin Zhenren is no less skilled than those top experts, and you are more than capable of protecting Junior Sister…”</p><p>Then, Liao Chen took out an object—an antique bronze lamp. There was no flame on the lamp stand, no oil, only a dull yellow wick, seemingly made of straw.</p><p>“This is our temple’s treasure, the Undefiled Heart Lamp. It was requested by Abbot Yingning and entrusted to me to bring here, intended to aid Junior Sister in her tribulation. I now entrust this treasure to Qin Zhenren. Later, Qin Zhenren will use my blood as fuel to ignite the wick. Before the blood is consumed, the lamp will still unleash its full power.”</p><p>He extended a finger, approached the lamp stand, and squeezed out drops of bright red blood.</p><p>‘Pop! Pop!’</p><p>The blood became lamp oil, filling the lamp stand, staining the Undefiled Heart Lamp with a layer of blood, yet it didn't appear sinister; instead, it possessed a certain purity, quite mysterious.</p><p>Qin Sang received the lamp from the Abbot, asking, “Abbot, by leaving the Undefiled Heart Lamp with us, how will you explain this to your sect?”</p><p>“This is my own decision, not involving either of you. I will bear the consequences myself. Upon my return to the mountain, I will accept the Abbot’s punishment. After leaving the Sacred Land, Qin Zhenren, please return this treasure to Purple Cloud Mountain.”</p><p>Having lost a significant amount of blood, Liao Chen’s aura weakened further, clearly indicating a fundamental injury.</p><p>He turned to Liuli, “I hope Junior Sister will successfully reach the Void Refinement stage, not disappointing Abbot Ning!”</p><p>Liuli bowed solemnly, thanking Liao Chen for his protection.</p><p>“This monk takes his leave!”</p><p>Liao Chen nodded, lightly tapping his foot, launching himself into the air and flying towards the rift.</p><p>Before entering the rift, Liao Chen glanced back, his gaze sweeping across the vast land and vibrant radiant light. A hint of regret flashed in his eyes.</p><p>On the path of cultivation, the most precious thing is opportunity.</p><p>Opportunities in the world are rare, and at their level, opportunities that suit them are even rarer, truly once-in-a-millennium encounters.</p><p>If all had gone according to plan, he should have broken through to the late Transcendence stage in the Sacred Land and eventually become a top cultivator among his peers.  However, unforeseen circumstances intervened. Not only was his breakthrough opportunity ruined by a mysterious gray figure, but the fortuitous encounter within his heart lake also eluded him.</p><p>At this moment, countless others, like him, entered with high hopes, only to leave with regret and frustration.</p><p>A faint sigh escaped his lips before Liuzhen flew into the fissure and vanished completely.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, turning to the Undyed Heart Lamp in his hand.  He focused his senses, perceiving an invisible barrier between himself and the artifact. Liuzhen's essence blood served as a bridge between him and the lamp, enabling him to 'ignite' it, regardless of whether it was a spiritual treasure or if he possessed the Tongbao Scripture.</p><p>Of course, once Liuzhen's essence blood was consumed, he would no longer be able to activate the artifact.</p><p>The fissure in the sky closed, quickly narrowing to a mere crack.</p><p>After Liuzhen's departure, more figures arrived at the fissure.</p><p>This time, a considerable number of cultivators were likely leaving the Sacred Land, leaving behind only those with exceptional strength and significant resources.</p><p>"Let's go," Qin Sang put away the Undyed Heart Lamp.</p><p>Liuli hummed in agreement, and the two immediately set off, continuing towards the Bi Xie Ancient Temple.</p><p>Without Liuzhen to hinder them, their journey became significantly easier, even as the radiance of the celestial light grew more intense.</p><p>...</p><p>Two days later, they finally reached the area Liuzhen had marked.</p><p>"Is this the Bi Xie Ancient Temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli landed on a mountain, seeing a boundless expanse of peach-colored mist ahead, even the sky tinged pink.</p><p>They could not see the temple itself, only the dense fog. Qin Sang used his Celestial Eye ability, but his vision was blocked by the mountain peaks.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was certain this was not naturally occurring. He noticed carvings on these mountains, forming some kind of formation.</p><p>After observing for a moment, Qin Sang quietly approached the edge of the red mist, capturing a small wisp.  He exclaimed joyfully, "It's this poisonous mist!"</p><p>Looking around, he saw a stark contrast between the inside and outside of the mist. Inside, the vegetation was lush and vibrant, while outside, everything was withered and dead.</p><p>Normally, the poisonous mist would not disperse, but it seemed to be affected by the celestial light.  Surprisingly, the light's impact here was less than they anticipated.  Perhaps coincidentally, they noticed no celestial light near the mist.</p><p>But the next moment, a disturbance emanated from deep within the mist – the ripple of the celestial light.</p><p>Seeing what happened next, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>Under the celestial light's impact, the red mist retreated, yet remained cohesive, demonstrating a remarkable flexibility.  Once the light subsided, the red mist would reaggregate, obscuring all traces.</p><p>Dealing with the outer mist required no special measures. Qin Sang activated his protective True Qi and said to Liuli, "Be careful!"</p><p>Liuli nodded, performing an incantation.  A spiritual light appeared behind her, followed by a crackling sound, as a white ice dress formed around her, and an ice veil covered her face.</p><p>The chilling aura of the ice created a distance between them.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang saw a glimpse of the Liuli he once knew, causing him to stare a moment longer.</p><p>Liuli looked down at herself, puzzled. "Qin Daoist, is something amiss?"</p><p>Her expression immediately brightened. Qin Sang knew she was not the same Liuli as before. He shook his head slightly. "Nothing, it's just that the ice makes you seem like a different person."</p><p>He thought to himself, *That's the Liuli I remember.*</p><p>Liuli, without suspicion, smiled slightly, and took a step forward.  The poisonous mist touched her, freezing into countless tiny red ice particles that swirled around her.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, looking towards the mountain ahead, walking side-by-side with Liuli.</p><p>They soon arrived at the base. The mountain was extremely steep, almost a sheer cliff face.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush to climb it, instead placing a hand on the rock, sensing something. Liuli stood quietly beside him, alert to their surroundings.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang withdrew his hand, saying softly, "It's a spirit formation."</p><p>"Is the formation related to the poisonous mist?" Liuli asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "This formation was created for the mist; it's a poisonous array. Before now, outsiders were unable to enter easily.  But now, the array is damaged by the constant assault of the celestial light, revealing many weaknesses.  Come, let's go."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang went around the mountain, to the foot of a nearby peak. After scanning it, he leaped up, stepping across the cliff face, Liuli following closely behind.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully picked a winding path up the smooth cliff face, eventually reaching the summit unimpeded.</p><p>Seeing the sight on the other side of the mountain, Qin Sang murmured, "What a magnificent Azure Scorpion Palace!"</p><p>Before them stood countless pavilions, all constructed from a vibrant green gemstone.  Their emerald glow shimmered amidst a red, poisonous mist. These structures extended far and wide, forming the shape of a giant scorpion.</p><p>The scorpion's head faced them directly. Although merely buildings, Qin Sang and Liu Li both felt a powerful, aggressive aura emanating from it, as if the scorpion glared at them as unwelcome intruders.</p><p>At the scorpion's tail, the ground had collapsed deeply at the stinger, leaving a truncated tail. Otherwise, the structure would have been even more imposing.</p><p>"Let's go there!" Qin Sang pointed towards the scorpion's tail, where the collapse was clearly caused by the radiant light. Perhaps this was the way into the Silent Space.</p><p>"There don't seem to be any Gou Hook cultivators around," Liu Li looked around.</p><p>"Since it's a poisonous scorpion, the most important part is the stinger at the tail – the central hall of the Azure Scorpion Palace. Now that the hall has sunk, the Gou Hook experts may have followed it in…"</p><p>This meant they needed to be extra cautious, lest they be mistaken for rivals vying for treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang had the Sky-Eyed Butterfly search carefully. Finding no one, he signaled Liu Li and they swiftly flew towards the pavilions.</p><p>They soon arrived before the giant scorpion. The poisonous mist constantly shifted, but the radiant light had greatly disrupted the formations, significantly weakening the mist's potency. Qin Sang moved freely, and Liu Li found it manageable as well.</p><p>Directly ahead were the scorpion's pincers.  Liu Li and Qin Sang flew to either side, discovering that the seals on the halls had been opened.  Pushing the doors open, they found the interiors empty, thoroughly looted.</p><p>Several more halls were the same. They found some old traces, indicating that whoever had plundered the Azure Scorpion Palace had started from the head and systematically worked their way back. Only after clearing those halls could they access the one at the tail.  The treasure within those halls would have been enough to sustain a clan for generations, showcasing the creator's foresight.  Unfortunately, the radiant light had disrupted their plan.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li continued, flying through the scorpion's body until they reached the area connecting its abdomen and tail.</p><p>"Look there!"</p><p>Liu Li noticed something unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang saw it too: some jade fragments scattered before a pavilion.</p><p>He picked up a piece and examined it. "These are fragments of a magical artifact.  It seems its owner tried to open this hall but failed and suffered backlash."</p><p>"These fragments are new, but there's no one around," Liu Li said.  "As you said, they must have gone inside."</p><p>Qin Sang looked ahead.</p><p>This was likely the limit of their predecessors' progress, meaning the halls beyond remained unopened. These halls held treasures the Azure Scorpion Palace's creator had deliberately left behind.  If they managed to open a few, they could gain significant rewards.</p><p>However, both he and Liu Li understood priorities and weren't swayed by immediate gain.  Besides, treasures specifically prepared by a Gou Hook ancestor might not be suitable for them.</p><p>They continued through the halls, finally reaching the edge of the deep pit.  The poisonous mist within was denser and darker than outside.</p><p>Upon contact, Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  He immediately transmitted a message to Liu Li, warning her to stay back.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang captured a wisp of the mist, silently employing techniques from the *Poison God Codex* to analyze its toxicity.</p><p>He only possessed a fragment of the *Poison God Codex*, covering knowledge up to the Transcendence stage. After losing the Poison Pearl, he had abandoned the path of poison and had not attempted to interpret the later chapters. Therefore, most techniques learned from the *Codex* had limitations, making them ineffective against extremely powerful poisons. Still, some techniques remained useful.</p><p>As Qin Sang focused on his analysis, he suddenly sensed unusual energy fluctuations from below—not like the mist or the halls' seals, but more akin to the clash of powerful magical arts.</p><p>Exchanging a glance, they both realized that powerful cultivators were battling beneath them!</p>
