<h1>Chapter 1806: On the Way of the Sword</h1><p>As for the specific timeframe, even Qin Sang couldn't say for sure.</p><p>The Fusion of the Wheel Seal and the Demon-crushing Seal was completed quickly; it seemed not difficult.</p><p>The further along, the more difficult the fusion would become.  Qin Sang couldn't neglect his own cultivation to solely focus on comprehending the Buddhist seals.</p><p>"How about fifty years?" Qin Sang pondered, suggesting a generous timeframe.</p><p>For a Nascent Soul cultivator, fifty years was but a blink of an eye.</p><p>"Fifty years…"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru was silent for a moment, then nodded.</p><p>As long as the seal could be opened and the Buddhist treasures within the pagoda could be obtained within a hundred years, it was acceptable.</p><p>He still had 150 years until his next tribulation, ample time to digest his gains.</p><p>"This monk will wait fifty years for you! If you are unable to break the seal after fifty years, I hope you will pass on this seal to our temple.”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru added a condition. He would offer treasures in exchange, but the Buddhist treasures within the Floating Pagoda would no longer concern Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang thoughtfully agreed.</p><p>He stayed at Jingtai Temple for several more months, studying Buddhism and repeatedly reviewing the recording.</p><p>It was the insights gained from this recording that gave Qin Sang the confidence to fuse the Buddhist seals.</p><p>On the day of his departure, Venerable Zhenru personally escorted Qin Sang down the mountain.</p><p>"Venerable, please stay."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, then flew north.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru watched Qin Sang leave, then returned to the temple to busy himself. The two agreed to collect as many items as possible to help defend against the golden light.  If other methods to break the prohibition were found, Qin Sang would immediately come to assist.</p><p>On his way back, Qin Sang mostly immersed himself in the "Seven Master Buddhist Seals." The monk's recording was shocking, broadening Qin Sang's horizons and most importantly, pointing him in the right direction.</p><p>Returning to Star Island's Immortal Lake, Qin Sang first went to Huzhong Island. After wandering through the city streets, he arrived at a secluded courtyard in a residential area for ordinary people and knocked on the door knocker.</p><p>With a creak, an old man opened the door. Seeing Qin Sang, his face lit up with joy. "Master, you're back."</p><p>"Old Chen, you're looking even healthier," Qin Sang said with a smile as he entered the courtyard.</p><p>The old man was filled with gratitude.  "Thanks to Master for curing my illness and giving me a place to live. Even if I served Master for countless lifetimes, I wouldn't be able to repay your kindness."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Consider this courtyard as payment for your treatment. No need for service."</p><p>After dismissing the old man, Qin Sang entered the inner chamber.</p><p>A formation was set up in the chamber. If Mo Xingdao had news, it would be transmitted through this formation. This was their only means of communication; it wasn't immediate, but it was discreet.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the formation, but there was no response.</p><p>After reassuring the old man and leaving some money, he left the courtyard and went to Master Qi's residence.</p><p>Since helping Qin Sang refine the Returning Wind Armor, Master Qi's skill in refining had greatly increased, and his reputation was even louder than before.</p><p>Master Qi hadn't given up on continuing to refine the fragments of the true treasure, but each attempt required a huge amount of resources and risked destroying the Returning Wind Armor.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't reluctant to part with the Returning Wind Armor, but he had more important things to do. He entrusted Master Qi with most of his resources to gather as many spirit flowers as possible for the Yinhua Pill, which would be refined by Master Lingxu.</p><p>This visit to Master Qi had another purpose: the progress on the piercing of the meridians in the gauntlets was more than halfway done, and he wanted Master Qi to take a look.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang saw Master Qi, the Returning Wind Armor was immediately requested.  He smiled helplessly and followed Master Qi into the fire room.</p><p>Ten days later, Qin Sang left Master Qi's mansion and, through the Dao Court, sent the spirit flowers to Master Lingxu's residence.</p><p>If it were a top-tier treasure, he certainly wouldn't entrust it to others, but the Dao Court was unlikely to covet these spirit flowers.</p><p>With those matters settled, Qin Sang returned to Sword Heart Island to continue his seclusion.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Half a year passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang held the Chengying Sword in both hands, deep in thought.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, he put away the sword, left his cave, and decided to ask the Sword Master for an examination of the sword.</p><p>For nearly three years, Qin Sang had tried various methods to test the sword, but it had remained unresponsive.</p><p>Even with his continuous breakthroughs in the art of refinement, he wouldn't surpass the Golden Mountain sect master by much and couldn't fathom the sword's secrets, leaving him no choice but to seek guidance from a master of the sword way.</p><p>Moreover, he didn't intend to waste any more time on the Chengying Sword.</p><p>He had many things to do, and cultivation was his priority.</p><p>Due to his limited spiritual sense, he didn't know when he could refine the Kirin Primal Seed. If Qin Sang wanted to maintain his combat strength, he had to continuously improve his physical cultivation; cultivating body and spirit simultaneously.</p><p>The "Chapter on Cultivating the Sword with the Divine Soul" as the main focus and "The Heavenly Demon's Body Refining Technique" as a supplementary cultivation, required double the cultivation time.</p><p>Secondly, comprehending the "Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals," refining the gauntlets, and blood-feeding the Heavenly Eye Butterflies all consume significant energy.</p><p>Jian Nu diligently guarded before the Sword Master's cave, clearly having received instructions.  Understanding Qin Sang's intentions, he immediately activated the protective formations.</p><p>"Brother, come in."</p><p>The Sword Master's voice echoed from within the cave, and the door opened automatically.</p><p>Jian Nu respectfully stepped aside.</p><p>Entering the Sword Master's cave for the first time, Qin Sang curiously glanced around.  The cave prepared for Qin Sang was meticulously arranged, while the Sword Master's own dwelling was remarkably simple.</p><p>The hall contained only a person, a meditation cushion, and an incense altar.  On the altar sat an incense burner and a single sword!</p><p>Qin Sang took a closer look; the sword was unusual, hanging upside down above the altar.  He had only seen ancestral figures and deities enshrined at the Academy; this was the first time he saw someone worshipping a sword.</p><p>The sword was unsheathed, wrapped entirely in white cloth, including the hilt, obscuring its true form.  Qin Sang realized this was no ordinary cloth;  incantations were inscribed on it, their purpose unknown.</p><p>He had never seen the Sword Master use this sword before.</p><p>Qin Sang, feeling a growing unease, looked at the Sword Master, whose back was turned. His expression changed abruptly.  "Senior Brother..."</p><p>He looked ashamed. "I shouldn't have come."</p><p>The Sword Master's aura was exceptionally powerful, yet subtly fluctuated—a sign of imminent breakthrough to the next level.</p><p>In just a few years, the Sword Master was on the verge of breaking through to the mid-stage of the Divine Transformation realm.  His visit was indeed ill-timed.</p><p>"It's alright," the Sword Master slowly finished his cultivation, saying calmly, "This breakthrough was quite strenuous; I almost lost control.  Your arrival helped me regain my composure."</p><p>Whether the Sword Master's words were true or not, Qin Sang felt guilty and hesitant, reluctant to disturb him further.</p><p>The Sword Master stood up and turned around.  "I speak the truth, Brother. Don't worry. If you have something to discuss, please speak freely."</p><p>Sighing softly, Qin Sang nodded and produced the Chengying Sword.  "I unexpectedly obtained this sword; its origins are unknown.  I wanted to ask for your guidance, but..."</p><p>He handed the Chengying Sword to the Sword Master.</p><p>The Sword Master took it, gazed at it for a moment, and let out a soft "hmm." Then, he ran a finger along the blade.</p><p>*Clang!* A resonant ring echoed through the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang stared, dumbfounded.  The Chengying Sword had never produced such a clear sound in his hands.</p><p>The Sword Master turned the sword over, gracefully swung it twice, and exclaimed with delight, "There truly are such weapons in the world!"</p><p>Gently stroking the blade, the Sword Master pondered, saying to Qin Sang, "I recall you using a sword in the Evil Plains, displaying remarkable skill. You should understand the Way of the Sword."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent, glancing at the Chengying Sword in the Sword Master's hand. He dared not claim to understand the Way of the Sword.</p><p>Unaware of Qin Sang's thoughts, the Sword Master waited for a response, but without receiving one, continued, his eyes gleaming, murmuring,</p><p>"What is the Way of the Sword?</p><p>"We cultivate the purest sword intent, nurturing the sword with intent.  Whether choosing the Killing Sword, Illusion Sword, Transformation Sword, Extreme Sword, or others, the heart is solely focused on the sword; the sword-heart is clear, refined, and pure.</p><p>"Some believe that only those whose hearts are completely devoted to the sword are true sword cultivators, viewing them as orthodox, all others inferior."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; he agreed with this view.</p><p>He acknowledged his limitations; he couldn't become a true sword cultivator.</p><p>The *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter* is undoubtedly a top-tier technique of the Killing Sword lineage, yet he always treated it as a tool, prioritizing the killing talismans for faster cultivation.</p><p>Reflecting on his path, he realized his scattered focus: ghosts, corpses, demons, insects, fire, poison, transformations, Buddhism, Daoism, and devilish arts.</p><p>He never achieved a breakthrough solely through the Way of the Sword.  As long as something could help him improve and break through, he would use it without hesitation.</p><p>Among his acquaintances, Elder Qingzhu could be considered a sword cultivator; Shangguan Lifeng abandoned his blades for swords. If he mastered the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, he might qualify as half a sword cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang considered the Sword Master before him to be another one.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Sword Master shook his head gently.</p><p>"This Way of the Sword emphasizes purity, but are other sword practitioners not sword cultivators?</p><p>"They may lack talent, have insufficient temperament, or face various external factors hindering their pursuit of pure sword intent.</p><p>"There are the ways of talisman swords and myriad swords; some focus on sword formations, some prioritize technique over the Way, some are obsessed with seeking extraordinary treasures, forging the strongest swords without demanding pure sword intent.</p><p>"Or they may cultivate sword intent but rely on external forces."</p><p>"Is their unconventional approach to swordsmanship truly inferior to the path of pure sword intent?"</p><p>"In my view," the Swordmaster said, "all paths lead to the same summit; there are only differences in approach, not in superiority or inferiority.  It's just that the world remembers only those with unparalleled sword intent, those who overcome any obstacle with a single, decisive strike. We simply haven't yet seen those who've mastered other paths to their ultimate potential."</p><p>The Swordmaster seemed merely to be expressing his understanding of swordsmanship, not seeking Qin Sang's answer. He gestured towards the Chengying Sword. "This sword is an 'external object' that can help one attain sword intent."</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering the Swordmaster's statement when he heard this, and carefully examined the Chengying Sword.</p><p>"Legend speaks of a swordsmanship technique," the Swordmaster continued, "that requires a top-tier swordsman to imbue their own sword intent into a weapon during its refinement, ultimately creating a special sword."</p><p>"How is this sword used?" Qin Sang asked, puzzled, as he felt no sword intent emanating from the Chengying Sword.</p><p>"This type of sword cannot be used independently, but it can be refined. During the refinement process, one uses their own spiritual sword. After refinement, not only will the spiritual sword's power be enhanced, but a sword shadow will also be created.  It's said this shadow possesses a significant portion of the spiritual sword's power.  Furthermore, being formless, it strikes unexpectedly, making it completely unforeseen by the enemy."</p><p>The Swordmaster paused. "Most importantly, one can obtain the sword intent left by the predecessors from this sword.  Gaining it first, then understanding it, is naturally much easier than self-cultivation. However, this kind of inheritance is completely different from transmitting sword manuals; it will inevitably leave an indelible mark of that sword intent on one's mind. It is best suited for transmitting skills to fellow disciples, thus it is also called an inheritance sword. If I weren't so focused on pure sword intent and unwilling to be disturbed, I would certainly have asked my friend for this sword."</p><p>He sighed regretfully.</p><p>Such a sword was indeed exceptionally rare, a once-in-a-millennium occurrence. Only top-tier swordsmen could forge an inheritance sword.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang also frowned in thought.</p><p>From the Swordmaster's words, the Chengying Sword seemed to be more than simply integrated with a spiritual sword. He wondered if it could be used with his Yunyou Sword; if not, he would have to choose his Huiying Sword instead.</p><p>The inheritance of sword intent was certainly appealing to Qin Sang, but the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* was his fundamental cultivation method. Would receiving another's sword intent inheritance shake his path?</p><p>With such a master present, Qin Sang immediately voiced his concerns.</p><p>Upon learning that Qin Sang's fundamental cultivation method was a swordsmanship technique, the Swordmaster's expression became somewhat strange, as Qin Sang's previously displayed prowess in physical strength and poison techniques were extraordinary.</p><p>Other swordsmen, even if they didn't cultivate sword intent, at least used swords.</p><p>The Swordmaster carefully considered his words.  "My friend is unlike us. If you don't pursue the most refined and pure sword intent, you can accept the inheritance and certainly benefit greatly, but it's best not to accept it entirely.  The 'degree' to which you accept it requires your own judgment. However, to do otherwise would be a waste."</p><p>The Swordmaster looked regretful. An inheritance sword could only be passed on to one person; if Qin Sang only accepted part of it, the remaining sword intent would dissipate.</p><p>If a descendant of the creator of the Chengying Sword were to obtain it, they might become a top-tier swordsman.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't harbor such thoughts. The Chengying Sword was obtained from the Immortal Palace; its creator was probably long gone, and their descendants untraceable.</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Both the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* and the Chengying Sword originated from the Immortal Palace—could there be a connection between the two inheritances?</p><p>This thought settled in his mind, and Qin Sang was even more determined to try.</p><p>"Are you sure you want to accept this inheritance of sword intent?" asked the Swordmaster.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded without hesitation.  "Please instruct me, Senior Brother."</p><p>"Inheritance swords usually have a special seal to protect the sword intent inheritance and prevent others from recognizing it. You must first find the seal, then assess its strength…"</p><p>The Swordmaster thoroughly instructed Qin Sang on refining the inheritance sword.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully took notes, thinking to himself that the Chengying Sword had existed for countless years; its seal, weakened by time, might be considerably diminished.</p><p>After receiving the Swordmaster's guidance, Qin Sang bowed his thanks. He did not leave immediately but pointed to outside the cave. "I'll protect you while you cultivate, Senior Brother."  The Swordmaster's breakthrough was imminent and could not be disturbed.</p><p>The Swordmaster did not refuse; he smiled and nodded. "In the future, if you have any questions about swordsmanship, feel free to seek me out. I may not be extraordinarily talented, but I can still offer some enlightenment. My help isn't free, though. After you've grasped the inheritance, we'll have a sparring match."</p><p>"More than enlightenment, I hope you won't find it too bothersome in the future," Qin Sang thought to himself, realizing that befriending the Swordmaster was a brilliant move.</p><p>After Senior Qingzhu, he had finally found another master of swordsmanship.</p><p>The Swordmaster laughed heartily.</p>
