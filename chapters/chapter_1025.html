<h1>Chapter 1117: Heirs</h1><p>Chapter 1117: Heirs</p><p>Four individuals entered the golden passage and proceeded through it.</p><p>The old woman, leaning on her cane, walked slowly, speaking softly and deliberately: "When you come here in the future, follow the steps precisely, without the slightest error."</p><p>The young man and woman both responded affirmatively.</p><p>At this moment, the elderly man beside them sighed, saying, "The Inner Sanctuary appears earlier each time.  At this rate, by their time, who knows what the situation will have become? Our ancestors likely didn't foresee this transformation of the Seven Killing Hall. If the Seven Killing Hall truly emerges, they will have ample time to break the celestial seal. Relying solely on us, their inadequate descendants, we cannot completely prevent the Witch Clan from entering and exploring."</p><p>"Brother, why so much worry?  Let future generations deal with their own matters. The Grandmaster didn't burden us with the responsibility of protecting humanity; we only need to fulfill the Grandmaster's instructions.  Humanity has numerous experts; nominally, we still hold the advantage. Even if the Seven Killing Hall emerges, the Witch Clan won't gain much."</p><p>The old woman tapped her cane, her voice echoing in the passage.</p><p>"Besides, didn't we examine it carefully last time? The celestial seal is intact, and the Grandmaster's restrictions haven't been affected by the earlier appearance."</p><p>The young man and woman exchanged glances, somewhat confused but hesitant to ask further questions, obediently following behind.</p><p>They walked for some time.</p><p>The four reached the end of the passage.</p><p>Upon seeing what lay ahead, the young man and woman were instantly astonished.</p><p>At the center of the cloud cluster was a floating mountain.</p><p>The suspended mountain drifted in mid-air. Though not large, it was lush and green, surrounded by celestial clouds.</p><p>Clear springs flowed, and winding streams circled pavilions.</p><p>Who would have imagined that within the perilous Inner Sanctuary, such a peaceful, vibrant place existed, resembling a celestial abode?</p><p>The two elders, however, showed no surprise, their expressions calm as they exited the passage and flew towards the floating mountain.</p><p>The young man and woman, recovering from their shock, quickly followed.</p><p>Shortly, the four arrived before a wooden hall in the forest.</p><p>The wooden hall stood alone, surrounded by overgrown weeds and accumulated fallen leaves, appearing desolate in the deep, quiet woods.</p><p>The old woman paused, lightly tapping her cane downwards. An invisible wave emanated, instantly clearing away the surrounding weeds and leaves.</p><p>The other elder approached the wooden hall and gently pushed open the door.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>Light streamed into the hall, dispelling the darkness.</p><p>Unexpectedly, inside was a teleportation array.</p><p>The four stepped onto the array, and with a flash of light, they appeared in a dark cave. A wave of coldness swept over them, causing the young man and woman to shiver.  They secretly activated their cultivation techniques, completing a cycle before dispelling the chill.</p><p>'Drip!'</p><p>The sound of dripping water came from ahead.</p><p>After walking a short distance, they both stopped, stunned by the sight before them.</p><p>Ahead was a circular cavern, very damp, with water droplets clinging to the stone walls, constantly dripping. The chill they had felt emanated from this cavern.</p><p>In the center of the cavern was a raised platform.</p><p>On the platform was an object, square with two handles. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be a stone cauldron.</p><p>The two elders moved swiftly to the platform and glanced inside the cauldron.  The stone walls of the cauldron were also covered in water droplets, and a thin layer of clear water had accumulated at the bottom.</p><p>This water exuded an intense coldness, yet it remained unfrozen.</p><p>The old woman looked up, saying sternly, "The spirit liquid is only half of its usual amount."</p><p>The elder nodded, "It's normal for it to accumulate this much; it's only been a little over a hundred years since the last appearance of the Inner Sanctuary."</p><p>At this point, the young man and woman also approached, curiously observing the rough stone cauldron and the spirit liquid within.</p><p>"Grandmaster, is this the Soul-Washing Liquid? How did it grow inside the stone cauldron?"</p><p>The young man couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"This liquid isn't the Soul-Washing Liquid yet. It's a crucial ingredient required to refine it. It needs to be combined with several other herbs, but fortunately, those are not particularly rare."</p><p>The elder smiled kindly.  "However, this liquid can only be found here. This place seems to have originally been an underground cold spring with unique properties. Now the spring has dried up, only the restriction on the stone cauldron can slowly refine this special liquid in the cave.  The liquid contains the purest energy, usable in the refinement of Soul-Washing Liquid. You two step back; pay close attention to our refining hand seals and remember every step."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The young man and woman retreated to below the platform, their expressions tense as they stared unblinkingly at the elders' hands.</p><p>"Junior Sister, let's begin."</p><p>The elder swept his hand across the pouch at his waist.  One by one, jade boxes flew out, each containing different herbs and elixirs;  flowers, fruits, and more.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>With a gentle tap, the elder sent all the herbs into a cauldron.</p><p>Immediately, both elders placed their hands on either side of the stone cauldron, channeling their energy into it.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The cauldron trembled with a dull sound.  Mysterious runes shimmered on its surface, glowing strangely, the previous roughness gone, replaced by an aura of mystery.</p><p>The elders' fingers moved with blurring speed, weaving intricate hand seals into the cauldron.  Strange lights filled the cauldron, shifting and changing,  forming shifting restrictions, a chaotic scene obscuring the herbs within.</p><p>At the same time, a peculiar fragrance wafted from the cauldron.</p><p>After a while, the scent grew fainter, finally leaving only a faint, lingering, sharp aroma.</p><p>"Retrieve!"</p><p>The elder called out, and both withdrew their hands, glancing inside the cauldron and smiling.</p><p>Then, the elder took out a jade vial, using his energy to fill it with a small portion of the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  To the astonishment of the young man and woman, he put the vial away.</p><p>"Grandmaster, why leave so much behind?"</p><p>The young man asked, his face full of confusion.</p><p>The elder replied, "This is ancestral tradition.  The cauldron's restrictions limit us;  each time we refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid, we can only take a portion. The remainder must be sent to the Trial Grounds as a reward."</p><p>"The Trial Grounds?  Those people waiting at the inner hall entrance when we arrived?"</p><p>The young woman pouted, reluctantly saying, "The Cold Spring was discovered by our ancestors, and the other herbs are painstakingly cultivated by you Grandmasters. We're not related to them. Why give so much Soul Cleansing Liquid to strangers? Giving them a third...no! even a tenth is too much!"</p><p>The two elders exchanged smiles.</p><p>"You're quite greedy, little one!"</p><p>The elder woman chuckled, gently tapping the girl. "The Soul Cleansing Liquid and the Trial Grounds were established by our four ancestors to ensure the continuation and prosperity of our people.  These arrangements allow our race to consistently produce talented individuals, enabling us to suppress the Witch Clan for generations, forcing them to remain confined to the Witch Continent. The broadmindedness of our ancestors is beyond your comprehension, little miss."</p>
