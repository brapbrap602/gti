<h1>Chapter 729: A Minor Inconvenience</h1><p>Qin Sang sensed the lightning cocoon was stable and could be safely stored in his Qi Sea without risk of explosion.</p><p>However, the mutation's outcome remained uncertain. It could grant new supernatural powers, or it could corrupt his bloodline abilities, rendering them useless.  Fortunately, such mutations generally wouldn't affect his final transformation.</p><p>Since the Sky-Eyed Butterfly devoured it willingly, and it was a rare form of lightning energy, the final result shouldn't be too bad.</p><p>"Will it gain lightning powers and become a Thunder Butterfly?"</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with anticipation.</p><p>The thunderclouds above the cave still lingered, but the most potent white mist had been consumed by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.  Qin Sang looked around, ensuring he hadn't missed anything, then retrieved the Night Spectre and returned the way he came.</p><p>Leaving Red Leaf Island, he felt much more at ease.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to Green Warbler Island and boarded a merchant ship bound for his chosen destination: Five Elements Isles.</p><p>Five Elements Isles was actually a cluster of five small islands, located relatively close together. Cultivators simply named them after the five elements, such as Gold Element, Wood Element, and so on, collectively calling them Five Elements Isles.</p><p>The cultivators on the five islands supported each other, managing to maintain a foothold in that area of the sea.</p><p>The reason cultivators were scattered across the five islands was due to frequent beast tides.  Like rabbits having three burrows, if one island was attacked, cultivators from the others could provide support and reclaim it after the tide subsided.</p><p>It sounded dangerous, but according to the merchant guild, the cultivators on Five Elements Isles were very experienced in handling beast tides. The casualties weren't as high as imagined, and many cultivators were willing to stay.</p><p>During the long voyage, Qin Sang cultivated and observed the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's changes daily. It was his natal insect, and despite the lightning cocoon's obstruction, he could vaguely sense its state.</p><p>Lightning energy was growing increasingly dense on its wings, suggesting it might indeed mutate into a Thunder Butterfly.</p><p>However, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly showed no signs of awakening.  The mutation process seemed likely to be lengthy.</p><p>...</p><p>Gold Element Isle.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked and observed the island's peculiar scenery with a strange expression.</p><p>Gold Element Isle was quite large, but mostly wilderness. The shore was encircled by stones, forming an area that resembled a village more than a city.</p><p>The city was filled with crude houses built from stones and wooden planks. Two intersecting wide avenues appeared unusually rough.</p><p>Most striking were the dozen or so stone pillars outside the city. Each was six or seven zhang high and two arm-spans thick, covered in densely inscribed runes.</p><p>"These stone pillars are the island's protective formation?"</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat taken aback by the crude formation, so openly displayed.</p><p>The pillars weren't made of any special spiritual material, just ordinary stones, slightly harder than usual. Once the formation was activated, they likely wouldn't last long.</p><p>The pillars would probably crumble before the beasts could breach the formation. It was clear the island's cultivators were prepared to flee.</p><p>Cultivators walked the city streets, suggesting the conflict between the two races hadn't significantly impacted this place.</p><p>Qin Sang tightened his cloak and hurried into the city, quickly locating the Qiongyu Merchant Guild's shop.  He took out his token and entered.</p><p>Inside, only an elderly Foundation Establishment cultivator greeted him enthusiastically. "Senior, what kind of beast hides are you selling? Our shop guarantees the highest prices..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, flashing his token.</p><p>The old man paused, then his face lit up with joy. He hastily bowed. "So it's Senior Qing Feng! Forgive this old man's poor eyesight. Greetings, Senior!"</p><p>"Rise."</p><p>Qin Sang waved dismissively, glancing around the shop.  The shelves were filled with nothing but various beast hides.  There were no other artifacts, pills, or other such items.</p><p>He was about to inquire when he heard the Wang sisters' angry voices from outside.</p><p>The Wang sisters were Wang Shi, the elder sister, and Wang Xiang, the younger.</p><p>The younger sister's voice was sharper, and it was she who was speaking.</p><p>"Sister, that scoundrel was so rude, daring to insult you to your face! When the Daoist Master returns, we must make him pay..."</p><p>Wang Xiang stomped her feet as she scolded.</p><p>Wang Shi sternly reprimanded her, "Be careful! He's a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator. Don't speak carelessly. If someone overhears, it could bring trouble to the Daoist Master."</p><p>Wang Xiang looked aggrieved. "He not only insulted us publicly but also tried to touch us. Are we just supposed to let it go?"</p><p>"Someone with such high cultivation can't be driven solely by lust.  He insulted us for the benefit of Five Elements Isles. Let's be patient and discuss it with the Daoist Master when he returns. Don't jeopardize the bigger picture with impulsive actions..."</p><p>Wang Shi tried to reason with her.</p><p>As they spoke, the two women entered the shop.  Seeing Qin Sang, they both looked surprised and delighted.</p><p>They were about to bow when Qin Sang stopped them.  He asked calmly, "Fellow Daoist Wang, who was it that insulted you just now?"</p><p>Wang Shi glanced at her sister, silencing her with a look, and said, "Daoist Master, don't listen to Wang Xiang's nonsense. I was just negotiating business with several major merchant guilds of the East Zenith Alliance and had a minor disagreement with Fellow Daoist Cui Ji."</p><p>"Is that all there is to it? Since it concerns our guild's business, you don't need to hold back."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Wang Xiang. "You tell me. Who is Cui Ji, and what happened?"</p><p>Wang Shi sighed.</p><p>Having been called upon by Qin Sang, Wang Xiang, bursting with pent-up frustration, finally spoke her mind. She chattered incessantly, and Qin Sang gradually understood the situation.</p><p>Cui Ji was the steward sent by the Nine Star Association to manage affairs on Five Elements Isles.</p><p>Qin Sang was familiar with the Nine Star Association. He had traveled on their ship when he first arrived in the Demon Sea.  The Nine Star Association was a powerful force, holding significant influence within the East Zenith Alliance.</p><p>Cui Ji had been restless since arriving on Five Elements Isles. He gathered the East Zenith Alliance's merchant guilds on the island and dictated what other factions could trade.</p><p>Smaller guilds like Qiongyu, with only a few Foundation Establishment cultivators, were severely pressured.  This explained why the shop was filled with only beast hides.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't get angry, but instead chuckled. "A mere mid-Nascent Soul cultivator acting like a tyrant here?"</p><p>The old man explained helplessly, "Senior, you don't know the full story. There are several seniors on Five Elements Isles with higher cultivation than Cui Ji. But he uses the East Zenith Alliance's name to intimidate others, and they are reluctant to antagonize the alliance. Moreover, Cui Ji is cunning and won't offend them directly, so they coexist peacefully. The West Gloom Alliance has no interest here, and the North Star Alliance's power is similar to our East Zenith Alliance.  They divide the island into spheres of influence and don't interfere with each other. Five Elements Isles is less important than the larger islands, and the stewards sent by our alliance's major merchant guilds are weaker than Cui Ji, so we can only fume in silence..."</p><p>"Cui Ji must have caught wind of my arrival and wanted to make an example of us.  I knew Elder Zou and Steward Ran weren't being entirely altruistic by letting me cultivate peacefully.  Good thing they didn't send me after a late-stage expert..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and sat down. "Tell me everything you know about this Cui Ji."</p>
