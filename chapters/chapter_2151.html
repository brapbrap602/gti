<h1>Chapter 2141: Recognition Without Acquaintance</h1><p>“This humble Daoist still doesn't understand Immortal Ning's meaning. Perhaps Immortal Ning could be more straightforward. With Immortal Ning as Liuli's protector, shielding her from all storms, what can this humble Daoist, with such meager cultivation, possibly do?”</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed deeply. Immortal Ning's words failed to convince him.</p><p>“All beings are within the tribulation, and this humble Daoist is no exception. Who can say for certain whether they can safely weather the next calamity? This humble Daoist cannot remain by Liuli's side forever…”</p><p>Immortal Ning's tone was remarkably calm, as if she wasn't talking about herself.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Liao Chen and the others couldn't help but be moved, softly exclaiming, “Immortal Ning!”</p><p>Immortal Ning waved her hand at them, continuing her explanation to Qin Sang.</p><p>“As this humble Daoist mentioned earlier, Liuli harbors emotions within her heart. Cultivating the Supreme Forgetfulness is not her desire. As her master, I naturally hope that one day, when her cultivation reaches fruition, her original heart will remain unshaken.</p><p>“Supreme Forgetfulness, Supreme Heartlessness—a single character's difference, but for cultivators, it represents a chasm in their mindset.  Cultivating this method, a single misstep can be extremely perilous, even leading to Qi Deviation. Liuli's initial motivation for cultivating this method was to escape, a demonic obstacle already planted in her heart. This humble Daoist worries that in the future, she will instinctively avoid certain matters, which will only be detrimental to her cultivation.</p><p>“Precisely because of this, if others dare to influence Liuli, this humble Daoist can readily eliminate them.  However, dealing with Emissary Qin must be done with utmost caution. Otherwise, should Liuli see Emissary Qin in the future, or learn something, it will only backfire.</p><p>“This humble Daoist has been pondering how to prevent Liuli from straying onto the wrong path. Until Emissary Qin appeared, I realized there is no one more suitable!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged, yet a faint guess formed in his heart, "Immortal Ning intends to…"</p><p>Immortal Ning nodded, “Every breakthrough juncture is when the cultivation method and Liuli's emotional state fluctuate most violently.  Emissary Qin is the demonic obstacle within Liuli's heart. This humble Daoist believes that if Emissary Qin is present every time Liuli attempts a breakthrough, at least when she breaks through major realms, it should be beneficial to her.  It may not require Emissary Qin to do anything! However, if Emissary Qin participates in her breakthroughs, it should forge a stronger bond.”</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang fell into deep thought, but he couldn't be certain whether Immortal Ning's words were true or false. The Jade Buddha granted him absolute rationality during cultivation, making it difficult to fathom cultivation methods related to emotions and desires like the Supreme Forgetfulness.</p><p>Noncommittal, Qin Sang countered, “Has Liuli already entered the Void Refinement stage?”</p><p>He originally thought Liuli was at a critical juncture in her breakthrough, hence her delayed return.</p><p>Immortal Ning shook her head, “Liuli is in secluded cultivation, attempting to break through a bottleneck, but hasn't succeeded yet.  Moreover, before Emissary Qin's arrival, this humble Daoist awakened her and had her leave seclusion.”</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback, “Why is that?”</p><p>Liuli's entering seclusion meant she had sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough. Such opportunities are fleeting; once missed, a delay of hundreds or even thousands of years is possible.</p><p>Unless Immortal Ning possessed extraordinary powers to enable Liuli to break through at any time.</p><p>“Because Emissary Qin is here,” Immortal Ning said, “Now is no longer the optimal time for a breakthrough!”</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang patiently listened as Immortal Ning continued.</p><p>“This humble Daoist knows of a special secret realm, which presents a great opportunity for Liuli.  If she can break through within that secret realm, the benefits are immense.</p><p>“Unfortunately, this humble Daoist is bound by an oath and cannot personally enter.  To enter smoothly, Liuli had to attempt a breakthrough prematurely, thus obtaining only a portion of the opportunity within.  Emissary Qin's appearance provides another possibility.</p><p>“Liao Chen and the others cannot help Liuli, only Emissary Qin can. Because in critical moments, her instincts still tell her that Emissary Qin is the most trustworthy.”</p><p>Immortal Ning paused, then continued, “This humble Daoist does not know the depth of Emissary Qin's feelings for Liuli, nor will I force Emissary Qin to assist Liuli every time. You are both still far from the Body Integration and Grand Completion stages, and no one can say what the future holds. Consider this a request from a master. This journey will also be beneficial to Emissary Qin. Furthermore, it allows Emissary Qin to personally witness Liuli's breakthrough. Seeing is believing.  If anything contradicts what this humble Daoist has said, Emissary Qin can stop her!”</p><p>Immortal Ning's tone was earnest.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart eased slightly. After their meeting, although Immortal Ning hadn't spoken forcefully, an intangible pressure had lingered around the lake pavilion.</p><p>If Immortal Ning had adopted a condescending attitude, even if Qin Sang was inclined to help Liuli, he would have suspected ulterior motives and been unwilling to be led by the nose. Even if his current strength was insufficient, he would certainly find a way to take Liuli away in the future.</p><p>At least these words sounded like something a true 'master' would say.</p><p>Noncommittal, Qin Sang asked, “Where is this secret realm?”</p><p>“Within the Sacred Grounds of the Otherfolk!”</p><p>Immortal Ning replied.</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished, only to hear Immortal Ning continue, “What this humble Daoist said before was not untrue.  There is indeed a way to restore Daiyu Immortal Mountain, but it requires finding a similar immortal mountain.”</p><p>“Yuanyiao Immortal Mountain?”</p><p>“Indeed,” Immortal Ning nodded, “In ancient times, the five immortal mountains were equally renowned.  Entering the Sacred Grounds and absorbing the essence of Yuanyiao Immortal Mountain can help Emissary Qin quickly restore Daiyu Immortal Mountain.”</p><p>Knowing the method to restore the immortal mountain, Qin Sang felt no joy.</p><p>He didn't know what the essence of the immortal mountain was, but he understood that Yuanyiao Immortal Mountain had become the cornerstone of the Otherfolk's Sacred Grounds, the dwelling place of Saint Realm and Ancestral Realm powerhouses.</p><p>Stealing the essence of Yuanyiao Immortal Mountain, once perceived by those mighty figures, wouldn't that be courting death!</p><p>“Rest assured, Emissary Qin, this humble Daoist has a way to allow you to absorb the immortal mountain's essence unnoticed. Compared to the entire Yuanyiao Immortal Mountain, even if the current Daiyu Immortal Mountain were to devour freely, it would be no different than a drop in the ocean.  The Otherfolk powerhouses won't pay particular attention to such a minuscule change.”</p><p>Immortal Ning said confidently, “The Sacred Grounds are vast and the terrain complex. Inevitably, there are loopholes where the immortal mountain's essence leaks out. The secret realm this humble Daoist mentioned contains one such place.  Therefore, I said helping Liuli is also helping Emissary Qin yourself.”</p><p>“This humble Daoist and Liuli are both outsiders. How can we enter the Otherfolk's Sacred Grounds? Moreover, if I recall correctly, Otherfolk cultivators must reach the Emptiness Realm, second level, to be eligible to enter the Sacred Grounds.”</p><p>Back then, Si Lu also wanted to persuade Qin Sang with this condition, but Qin Sang never took it to heart. The Sacred Grounds belonged to all Otherfolk tribes, and the rules had long been established.  Let alone Si Lu, even Si Huang didn't have the power to make the major tribes violate ancestral teachings.</p><p>“Don't worry about Liuli's cultivation. This humble Daoist will apply a Decree of the Celestial Emperor Talisman to Liuli in advance. Before the talisman's power dissipates, she can disguise herself as a Void Refinement cultivator and possess corresponding strength,” Immortal Ning said.</p><p>A flicker of surprise flashed across Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Decree of the Celestial Emperor, could she be referring to Gouchen, one of the Four Emperors of the Heavenly Court?</p><p>Immortal Ning smiled faintly, “Does Emissary Qin perhaps think that only the Talisman Sect understands the Dao of Talismans and the art of summoning deities?  In ancient times, when the Talisman Sect created the Divine Court, they based it on the scriptures of the entire Daoist community.  The honorific titles of deities have existed since antiquity! This humble Daoist's Decree of the Celestial Emperor Talisman is quite different from the Talisman Sect's, and its quality can only be considered low-grade. Otherwise, Liuli wouldn't be able to withstand the talisman's power.  As for the qualifications to enter the Sacred Grounds, Purple Cloud Mountain and Patriarch Yuan Xiang have a prior agreement.  Originally, Liao Chen and Liuli were to go together, but the spot will be given to Emissary Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, “Outsiders can also enter the Sacred Grounds?”</p><p>“Back then, when the Otherfolk found Yuanyiao Immortal Mountain, they devoted the entire tribe's strength to establishing the Sacred Grounds, but nearly failed.  They had to rely on external forces. After the Sacred Grounds were established, a rule was left behind: outsiders, as long as they obtain the approval of all the Mirage Shell Masters of a certain upper tribe, can have the same qualifications as members of that tribe, but can only enter as attendants…”</p><p>Immortal Ning explained, "However, for many years, very few outsiders have been able to obtain this qualification, and many upper tribes have long forgotten this rule."</p><p>"In that case, this humble Daoist has a solution. If it works, we won't need to take Venerable Liao Chen's spot…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, briefly recounting the circumstances of his great battle with the Si You Tribe.</p><p>Si Huang presumably had a way to persuade the other Mirage Shell Masters. One Mirage Shell in exchange for a spot; Qin Sang wondered if Si Huang would be tempted.</p><p>Within the Otherfolk Sacred Grounds, one more expert on their side meant greater strength.</p><p>Moreover, the journey to the Sacred Grounds was a rare opportunity. If both he and Liuli occupied Purple Cloud Mountain's two spots, even if Liao Chen, the rightful owner, didn't mind, it would cause discontent among the Purple Cloud Mountain monks.</p><p>Immortal Ning was overjoyed upon hearing this, “Excellent! Liao Chen hails from Purple Cloud Mountain, and Liuli has the Decree of the Celestial Emperor Talisman, neither can conceal their identities.  Emissary Qin can remain hidden, making it easier to act.”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank, “Are there enemies of Immortal Ning within the Sacred Grounds?”</p><p>Immortal Ning sighed softly, “Originally from the same source, yet due to differing Daoist beliefs, we have become estranged. The atmosphere within the Otherfolk Sacred Grounds encourages mutual strife.  It's destined that you cannot coexist peacefully. However, they are allied with the Water Tribes and should be unaware of Emissary Qin's existence.  You may not encounter each other in the Sacred Grounds.”</p><p>It was good that the adversary wasn't one of the Otherfolk powerhouses within the Sacred Grounds. Qin Sang nodded, “When will the Sacred Grounds open?”</p><p>“The River of Misfortune has small and large tides.  Every large ebb tide marks the opening of the Sacred Grounds; the timing is uncertain.  According to this humble Daoist's calculations, the next large tide should be within a thousand years.”</p><p>Immortal Ning looked at Qin Sang, “Has Emissary Qin agreed?”</p><p>“I want to see Liuli!”</p><p>Qin Sang met Immortal Ning's gaze, his own unwavering, “Surely Immortal Ning won't prevent this humble Daoist?”</p><p>Immortal Ning smiled faintly, gesturing beyond the pavilion, “Liuli's cave dwelling is on Jade Peak.”</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang received guidance, learning the location of Jade Peak.  He bowed slightly to Immortal Ning and flew out of the lake pavilion.</p><p>“Immortal Ning…”</p><p>The old nun watched Qin Sang's retreating figure with worry etched on her face.</p><p>Immortal Ning gently shook her head, “Emissary Qin is not one to act impulsively. Return now, and do not disturb them.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The three exchanged glances and bowed before withdrawing.</p><p>…</p><p>Flying from the main peak of Purple Cloud Mountain, Qin Sang passed over numerous peaks of varying sizes, finally spotting a unique peak.</p><p>The peak stood tall and isolated from the surrounding mountains, almost perfectly vertical with sheer cliffs on all sides. There were no stone steps within the mountain, only vines and pine trees that could serve as a climbing path.</p><p>Snow covered the summit, desolate and lofty!</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang saw a stone dwelling beneath the snow, with a figure standing before it.</p><p>The figure was Liuli, already blending seamlessly with the cold surroundings.</p><p>White robes fluttered, her face breathtakingly beautiful, with long black hair cascading naturally, strands dancing in the cold wind.</p><p>Nearly a thousand years had passed since their last meeting.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Qin Sang's heart trembled as he landed lightly before Liuli.</p><p>“Master said an old friend was visiting. It turns out to be Fellow Daoist Qin,” Liuli spoke first, offering a courteous bow.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but be taken aback. He had grown accustomed to Liuli's silence.</p><p>Looking at Liuli again, her demeanor remained aloof and distant, but the hint of stubbornness in her eyes was gone. Or perhaps, she had forgotten her 'troubles,' no longer burdened by struggles, and no longer needed to display her 'stubbornness' outwardly.</p><p>The Liuli before him felt somewhat unfamiliar.</p><p>Could this be Liuli's true nature, previously suppressed?  Then, would forgetting those things be a form of liberation?</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed his distracting thoughts, returning the bow solemnly. After a moment's hesitation, he said, “Thank you, Fairy, for looking after Green Goat Temple during my absence, and for erecting a statue for this humble Daoist, which has greatly benefited my cultivation.”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin diverted a great calamity, bestowing grace upon the realm.  These are things we should do.”</p><p>Liuli spoke calmly, gesturing towards the stone pavilion beside them, “Fellow Daoist, please have a seat.”</p><p>Inside the pavilion was a pot of clear tea. Liuli poured a cup for Qin Sang with delicate hands, an act unimaginable in the past.</p><p>They conversed like old friends who had shared experiences yet had never truly known each other. When discussing the past, Liuli spoke like an observer, her tone devoid of any emotional ripples.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately avoided mentioning those deeply etched memories, unsure whether Liuli had forgotten them, or merely forgotten all her feelings for him, allowing her to remain composed and unmoved.</p><p>Immortal Ning's reminder still echoed in his ears. Qin Sang, at least for now, didn't dare gamble, unsure what reaction mentioning those matters would elicit from Liuli.</p><p>It was hard to imagine Liuli remembering those things yet remaining indifferent.</p><p>The tea in his cup was gone, and Qin Sang couldn't discern its taste.  With a silent sigh, he rose and said, “The Storm Realm is in ruins and needs rebuilding.  This humble Daoist cannot stay long and must return.”</p><p>Liuli stood up and said, “With Fellow Daoist Qin's return, the Storm Realm should be safe from now on.”</p><p>Qin Sang waited for a moment, seeing no other indication from Liuli, then flew out of Jade Peak, glancing back.</p><p>The pavilion was empty. Liuli had already entered her cave dwelling, her figure disappearing into the shadows.</p><p>Only after the cave door closed did Qin Sang avert his gaze, flying back to the main peak.</p><p>Immortal Ning was still waiting for him in the same spot.</p><p>“Did Emissary Qin see Liuli?”</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved an object and handed it to Immortal Ning.</p><p>Immortal Ning accepted it, finding a square wooden plaque hanging from a red string. Its surface was smooth, without any patterns.  Slightly surprised, she said, “This is… Soul Nurturing Wood!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He had obtained a piece of Soul Nurturing Wood from Bai, refining most of it himself and crafting the remainder into a wooden plaque for emergencies.</p><p>He had long wanted to give Liuli a piece, but Liuli had been so wary of him before that she certainly wouldn't have accepted it.</p><p>When he gave her the Heavenly Exquisite Jade and the Spirit Calming Incense, he had thought of giving her a piece then, but realized that the Heavenly Exquisite Jade and Spirit Calming Incense were consumable items, while the Soul Nurturing Wood plaque could be kept as a memento.</p><p>But he didn't know what to inscribe on it. He had thought that the moment Liuli agreed would perhaps be the best time, the best image.</p><p>He didn't know if there would be another opportunity to give it to her in the future.</p><p>Immortal Ning held the Soul Nurturing Wood plaque, her expression serious, “I will give it to her!”</p><p>“Farewell!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly and flew away, transforming into a streak of rainbow light.</p>
