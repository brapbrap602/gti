<h1>Chapter 510: Selling Corpses</h1><p>Chapter 510: Selling Corpses</p><p>Several months slipped by in Qingyang City.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang wasn't idle. He frequented various auctions, focusing on three things:</p><p>First, he sorted through the treasures in his dimensional pouch, selling unsuitable magical artifacts to buy more effective ones, striving to strengthen himself.</p><p>Second, he gathered various pills to treat corpse transformation.</p><p>Years ago, Wu Shang had desperately transformed himself into a living corpse, unconcerned with the changes to his body, solely focused on achieving the Golden Core stage.  He hadn't found a way to decipher the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang, protected by the jade Buddha, had mitigated the greatest risk of this technique, so he needed to avoid other risks to prevent becoming a living corpse himself.</p><p>The most pressing danger was bodily corpse transformation.</p><p>Before ingesting the Golden Core-forming pill, he first had to transform himself into a living corpse.</p><p>According to Wu Shang's plan, with the Heavenly Yang Qi's suppression, this process shouldn't cause corpse transformation.</p><p>However, before that, when transforming into a living corpse, he'd need to draw in Earthly Yin Qi. From that moment, his body would be assaulted by the Earthly Yin Qi, leading to severe corpse transformation.</p><p>This type of transformation is curable in the short term, but if left too long, recovery becomes impossible unless he abandoned this body.</p><p>Wu Shang had listed pills with this effect, none particularly rare.  Qin Sang, now wealthy, had acquired many, sparing no expense.</p><p>Third, he sought two spiritual objects:  Wan Shi Zhang and Tian Du Yan.</p><p>These were the two missing ingredients for refining the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>Wan Shi Zhang, sounding like a spiritual wood, is actually a jade treasure. Legend says a peculiar type of jade can grow like a living thing, maturing into a small jade tree resembling a camphor tree after ten thousand years. This mature jade camphor tree is called Wan Shi Zhang.</p><p>The "ten thousand years" might be exaggerated, but it speaks to its rarity.</p><p>Tian Du Yan is a rare spiritual rock, less valuable than Wan Shi Zhang, but equally difficult to find.</p><p>Elder Di Que, despite possessing the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring for a long time, hadn't refined it due to the lack of these two ingredients.  All others were gathered.</p><p>Qin Sang was one step away from achieving the Golden Core stage. While this step was a huge chasm, it didn't stop him from searching for these two ingredients.</p><p>If he could restore the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, after achieving the Golden Core, he'd have three different magical artifacts, surpassing many established Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wan Shi Zhang and Tian Du Yan were extremely rare, never having appeared before.</p><p>Besides this, Qin Sang hadn't forgotten to search for spiritual objects that aided Golden Core formation.</p><p>Though precious, these objects occasionally appeared at auctions, often as the highlight, but the best were only slightly better than Kan Li Golden Core pills, most being inferior.</p><p>They were useless to Qin Sang.</p><p>Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris flowers, even lesser-quality Xuan Zhen Pills, had never appeared.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang's chance to obtain a pair was quite lucky, though his own talent was lacking.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside Qingyang City.</p><p>Qin Sang, wearing a wooden mask and a Daoist robe, unexpectedly left his cave dwelling, heading towards a nameless barren mountain.</p><p>Upon reaching the mountain, he saw a figure standing at the peak—Yun Youzi.</p><p>"Senior, I appreciate your efforts, being stuck in Tianyou Pass for so long,"</p><p>Qin Sang landed, bowing slightly, his tone apologetic.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Qingyang Demon Sect's sect master to be so patient, that so many treasures at the auctions couldn't lure him from the sect, especially with only a little over two years until the opening of Ziwei Palace.</p><p>If the sect master waited for the opening to act, Qin Sang would be in despair, leaving him with no choice but to take a risk, though the chances of success were less than ten percent.</p><p>"Mutual assistance is only right,"</p><p>Yun Youzi shook his head. "Besides, I haven't come away empty-handed. I've almost gathered everything needed for the trip to Ziwei Palace in Tianyou Pass; now we just wait for its opening."</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed slightly. "That's good! Senior, you called me here—did you receive some news?"</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, setting up a simple restriction. "My sect's Tianyou Pass branch also runs a Taiyi Pill Pavilion, having connections with various Demon Sects.</p><p>For some time now, Old Dao has been staying put, when he heard some news.  Three months from now, the Demon Sect Sovereign, Tongyou Mojun, will personally host an auction at Tianyou Pass.  Not only will Yuan Ying stage Demon Cultivators and various Demon Sect masters attend, but the Qingyang Demon Sect master, a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, will also be invited, given the Sect's background. I've already had people keep an eye out… Didn't you say your plan needs some time to prepare, Qin?  You can begin now!”</p><p>“Tongyou Mojun, is that the Demon Sect Sovereign whose reputation rivals that of the Pure Yang Sect’s master, Red-Haired Ancestor?”</p><p>Seeing Yunyouzi nod slightly, Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun’s demonic power is immense; he’s said to be the strongest in the Demon Sect, second only to the Red-Haired Ancestor.  An auction personally hosted by him is sure to feature countless treasures, and those invited certainly won't refuse.</p><p>Upon inquiry, it turns out that not only the Demon Sect, but also the Righteous Path is holding a similar auction in Pure Steel City, only hosted by the Red-Haired Ancestor.</p><p>These auctions are customary; various factions are preparing for the upcoming opening of the Purple Micro Palace, exchanging information and strengthening themselves to ensure survival and gain more treasures within the Palace.</p><p>It is said that after these two auctions, there will even be a trade fair exclusively for Yuan Ying powerhouses, with participants coming from beyond just Xiaohan Region.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this is excellent news.  Furthermore, with Xiaohan Region’s elites gathering at the two major passes, the Qingyang Demon Sect won't have to worry about anyone attacking their sect, eliminating any unnecessary alarm.</p><p>Qin Sang made a swift decision and, together with Yunyouzi, headed straight for Qingyang Market.</p><p>…</p><p>After arriving at Qingyang Market with utmost speed.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated the time, changed his appearance, entered Qingyang Market, and began his plan.</p><p>Qin Sang was already well-versed in the various factions within Qingyang Market and their entanglements.  After contacting them one by one, he chose a trading house called Treasure Pavilion, presented two corpses, and commissioned them for auction.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The two corpses were successfully sold.</p><p>They were merely two weak corpses; quite common in Demon Sect territory.  Aside from attracting the attention of a few interested parties, they didn't cause much of a stir.</p><p>But soon, two more corpses appeared in Qingyang Market.</p><p>This time, more people noticed, especially the Qi Condensation cultivators, including some Qingyang Demon Sect disciples.</p><p>In addition, some Foundation Establishment cultivators also became interested.</p><p>It was clear that a cultivator proficient in Corpse Refinement was selling corpses in the market. These corpses might be a lure; this person might possess a Corpse of Slaughter!</p>
