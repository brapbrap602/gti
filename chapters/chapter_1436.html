<h1>Chapter 1428: Destruction</h1><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In the secret passage, glowing with blazing flames and shimmering seals, the lightning-fast figure was dazzlingly bright.  </p><p>As he fled, Qin Sang clearly felt the powerful aura behind him rapidly closing in. The fastest pursuer was undoubtedly the Hun Mo Elder.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang’s mind.</p><p>He had heard it said before.</p><p>Because the Nascent Soul bottleneck is extremely difficult to break through, there are significant differences in strength among grand cultivators.</p><p>Hun Mo Elder was clearly not weak.</p><p>These peak cultivators, who stood at the apex of the cultivation world, had ample time and resources in their long lifespans to overcome their weaknesses, lacking obvious shortcomings in any area.</p><p>What puzzled Qin Sang was the whereabouts of the ghost spirit that Hun Mo Elder had used to ambush Mu Valley Master.</p><p>He hadn’t encountered the spirit directly, but with a single glance, he’d sensed profound malice, confirming it was a terrifying demonic entity.</p><p>The Nascent Soul talisman puppet was intended to deal with this ghost spirit.</p><p>If Hun Mo Elder had unleashed it, Qin Sang didn't believe success would be guaranteed; securing the orb and the empowered staff would already be a fortunate outcome, leaving no chance to contend for the Seven-Story Pagoda.</p><p>Unless he was willing to take even greater risks.</p><p>Perhaps that ghost spirit was under some kind of restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>As this thought flashed, Qin Sang returned to the edge of the mountain pass.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Dull thuds echoed from within the mountain.</p><p>The walls of the passage bulged, and the ancient seals and Buddhist prohibitions emitted a blinding light—a final flicker, however, as the cracks in the seals spread rapidly, visible to the naked eye.</p><p>A ferocious and terrifying power was sealed within, about to break free!</p><p>It was imaginable that once this force erupted, not only this mountain and passage but the entire Jing Hai Sect would be razed to the ground and completely vanish from the world.</p><p>Feeling the power within the seals, Qin Sang’s scalp tingled; he didn't dare hesitate for a moment.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>He dashed past, hugging the opposite wall.</p><p>Simultaneously, he forcefully swung his sleeves, unleashing the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire around him once more.</p><p>However, the target of the demonic fire was not the pursuers behind him, but the seals!</p><p>The seals hadn't immediately collapsed after the Golden Summit Buddhist prohibitions were broken, giving Qin Sang a chance to escape the passage, which he used to surprise and deter his pursuers!</p><p>Passing this spot earlier, Qin Sang had identified the weakest point in the seal and mentally rehearsed this maneuver.</p><p>The demonic fire, condensed to its limit, crashed into the crack.</p><p>The seals, already at their breaking point, finally could not withstand this external attack!</p><p>At the point of impact,</p><p>a crack expanded, like a gaping abyss.</p><p>Near-silver blazing flames flowed out, thick as liquid, overflowing the crack and triggering a chain reaction.  Wherever it flowed, walls vanished swiftly, and the double seals dissolved.</p><p>The ‘d’ rune characters instantly dimmed.</p><p>The ancient seals were stronger, but already damaged, they essentially collapsed along with the Buddhist prohibitions.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Hun Mo Elder pursued into the passage, his pupils contracting to pinpricks.</p><p>Until now, he hadn't even seen his opponent.</p><p>The last image in his vision was the demonic fire striking the seals. In an instant, Hun Mo Elder understood his opponent's intention: this passage ran through the seals.</p><p>The next moment, the entire passage was filled with blinding light.</p><p>As if another sun had appeared.</p><p>Hun Mo Elder's heart pounded, cursing under his breath, utterly helpless, he immediately flew backward, simultaneously placing the Hun Mo Order in front of him without hesitation.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang felt his ears ring, instantly deafened.</p><p>He couldn’t see the outline of the passage, only blinding light filling his vision.</p><p>“I’ve gone too far…”</p><p>This thought instantly crossed Qin Sang's mind; the power of the exploding blazing flames was even more terrifying than he had anticipated.</p><p>Fortunately, this was his own doing, and he had a contingency plan; while rapidly escaping, he immediately summoned his Nascent Soul talisman puppet to shield his rear.</p><p>Immediately, a tremendous force struck.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain, groaning softly, thrown back by the impact of the talisman puppet before being propelled forward by the force.</p><p>He felt himself being scorched by the flames, about to be reduced to ashes; ignoring the puppet's condition, he retrieved it, gritting his teeth and fully activating his protective divine energy to maintain his form, successfully bursting into the Zen hall, seeing the exit.</p><p>Tan Hao had already evacuated the Jing Hai Sect; without hesitation, Qin Sang plunged out, feeling a sudden chill as he reached the seabed near the sect.</p><p>“Brother Qin, are you alright?”</p><p>Tan Hao, having just retreated, turned and saw Qin Sang’s disheveled figure.  He was initially relieved, then greatly alarmed.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted sharply, seizing Tan Hao and forcefully lunging forward.</p><p>Immediately, a torrent of scorching heat erupted from the secret passage, surging into the sea with tremendous force, throwing them both out.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>The newly arrived Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Some were drawn to the medicinal gardens, others were still deciding where to go.</p><p>Before the Buddhist pagoda.</p><p>Master Zhijie and the others were on the verge of breaking the pagoda’s seal when they were startled by the roar of the Hun Mo Elder. They looked towards the Golden Summit Hall with suspicion, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>The moment the seal crumbled, all the Yuan Ying cultivators felt a sudden, inexplicable palpitation.  Everyone’s gaze converged on the mountain pass.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mountain suddenly split open from its midsection, a jet of flame erupting like an arrow, stinging everyone's eyes.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, two figures burst from the hall, the Hun Mo Elder and Yu Yi Yuan Jun, both looking furious.</p><p>Then.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The Golden Summit Hall was overturned by a torrent of flames, shattering into pieces.  The Buddha and stone statues, only recently revealed, were instantly consumed by the flames.</p><p>“The seal has broken!”</p><p>The crowd instantly understood.</p><p>Before they could react, a dull rumble echoed from deep within the earth. The entire Jing Hai Sect violently shook, the ground seeming to rise.</p><p>The slowly rotating ‘d’ shaped golden seal at the mountain pass solidified, then shattered.</p><p>The fiery energy was finally unleashed.</p><p>A colossal jet of flame shot towards the heavens.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Jing Hai Sect.</p><p>The phenomenon persisted, though its power was significantly weaker than initially.</p><p>Yuan Ying ancestors, rarely seen, appeared one after another, entering the formation.</p><p>The lower-level cultivators dared not enter, but couldn’t suppress their curiosity and desire for opportunity, lingering nearby.</p><p>Some Golden Core cultivators, confident in their cultivation, entered the sea crater, probing the edge of the spirit formation, waiting for a chance to enter.</p><p>“What was that sound?”</p><p>Someone suddenly questioned.</p><p>Everyone stopped, turning towards the spirit formation.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The seawater inexplicably boiled.</p><p>They sensed a terrifying fluctuation emanating from within – a power beyond their imagination, on the verge of eruption.</p><p>What were those Yuan Ying ancestors doing inside?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The crowd’s faces turned pale, fear gripping their hearts.  They fled in panic, sprinting away from the sea crater without looking back.</p>
