<h1>Chapter 1897: Nirvana</h1><p>In the Daoist tradition, those with cultivation above the Dongzhen rank are all respectfully called Celestial Masters.  </p><p>The title "Celestial Master" also signifies status.</p><p>With the decline of Daoism, Zhang Zhenjun, leading the Daoist court, possesses the highest cultivation among all Daoists, making him the undisputed leader and worthy of the title Celestial Master!</p><p>Moreover, his incarnation as the Gouchen Emperor already possesses power comparable to a Celestial Master.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A reins of condensed starlight was flung from the imperial chariot, ensnaring the five-clawed golden dragon.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon did not resist, allowing the reins to be placed around its neck.  It then soared into the air, riding golden clouds, pulling the imperial chariot through the South Heavenly Gate.</p><p>The imperial chariot entered the Thunder City, piercing the nine heavens, directly ascending to the nine-layered heavenly palace.</p><p>The primordial energy here is chaotic, purple clouds emit brilliance, emptiness gives birth to nature, with both clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness.</p><p>The light here shines brightly and endlessly.</p><p>There is no spring, autumn, winter, or summer, no heat or cold, only gentle light and energy, where even withered things flourish.</p><p>Amidst flowing spiritual winds and boundless auspicious clouds, there stood an ancient hall.</p><p>This hall lacked the dazzling golden radiance of the gods' palaces, nor possessed any divine aura, appearing as an ordinary stone hall, its doors closed, suspended in the void, silent and formless.</p><p>This hall is the origin of the Daoist court—the Divine Thunder Upper Palace, also known as the Nine Heavens Golden Que!</p><p>It is hard for people to imagine that the legendary Daoist holy land is such an ordinary stone hall.</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon, pulling the imperial chariot, flew to the outside of the hall and prostrated itself before the chariot.</p><p>Zhang Tian Shi rose from his imperial seat, gazing at this holy land he had only seen in Daoist scriptures. Even with his temperament, he couldn't suppress his excitement.</p><p>The Divine Thunder Upper Palace has been silent for too long, and Daoism has declined for too long!</p><p>Countless sages, struggling through hardships, relentlessly pursued the Dao, ultimately passing away with regrets.</p><p>Finally, it is through his hands that the long-closed doors will be opened!</p><p>From this point on, Daoism will rise!</p><p>"Once I sought the Three Pure Ones,</p><p>Rise and fall are written in simple words.</p><p>Distantly recalling the old scene of Divine Thunder,</p><p>…"</p><p>Zhang Tian Shi, full of emotion, softly recited, pausing at the last line, then looked up to the heavens, his tone suddenly becoming high-pitched.</p><p>"The Golden Que, three watches of the moon!"</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The five-clawed golden dragon let out a dragon's roar in response, deeply feeling Zhang Tian Shi's emotions.</p><p>Daoism is trapped in this world; the Gui Fang Kingdom is no different.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Gui Fang Kingdom lost.</p><p>A look of sadness flashed in the five-clawed golden dragon's eyes, its head bowed.</p><p>Zhang Tian Shi raised his hand toward the Divine Thunder Upper Palace. The hall doors slowly opened, and a stream of light immediately shot out, actively flying toward Zhang Tian Shi, who grasped it in his hand.</p><p>Within the stream of light was a square seal, inscribed with 'Daoist Canon Master Seal'!</p><p>Daoism has the three treasures: Dao, Canon, and Master.</p><p>The Dao Treasure refers to the legendary Dao Zun, born before chaos, before the ultimate nothingness, at the beginning of primordial energy.</p><p>The Canon Treasure refers to the Daoist Canon, and various Daoist methods.</p><p>The Master Treasure refers to the Daoist sages and those who have attained the Dao.</p><p>One of the most important precepts in Daoism, the 'Three Refuges' in the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, requires one to take refuge in the three treasures—Dao, Canon, and Master—upon entering the Dao, to show sincerity.</p><p>The Daoist Canon Master Seal is the supreme divine seal of Daoism, the key to the divine court!</p><p>Zhang Tian Shi tightly gripped the Daoist Canon Master Seal.  A woman's voice came at that moment.</p><p>He laughed heartily in response, "Why not!"</p><p>With that said.</p><p>Zhang Tian Shi, holding the Daoist Canon Master Seal, rode the imperial chariot, alongside the Earth Slaughter Sword, breaking through the boundary and departing!</p><p>…</p><p>The divine blade unsheathed.</p><p>The sword cleaved the void!</p><p>Qin Sang watched the Earth Slaughter Sword depart through space, his eyes filled with complexity.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the young boy in green was the sword spirit of the Earth Slaughter Sword.</p><p>The Earth Slaughter Sword had followed him for many years, its spirit constantly dormant.</p><p>Qin Sang had only received brief warnings from the sword spirit, never directly communicating with it, until today, when he finally saw the true form of the sword spirit.</p><p>He had guessed that the "Chapter on Cultivating the Sword Spirit" and the Earth Slaughter Sword were of significant origin, but now, it seemed to far exceed his imagination.</p><p>The woman would use the Earth Slaughter Sword against a Great Ascension stage cultivator!</p><p>The exchange between the sword spirit and the woman was overheard by Qin Sang, bringing him much shock and confusion.</p><p>According to the woman, she was struggling in the River of Misery, sinking within, continuously searching for and calling out to the Earth Slaughter Sword and its master.</p><p>If she is Blood Moon, was the Heavenly Dao demonic sound that plagued the cultivators of this realm simply her calling out to the sword spirit?</p><p>Thinking back, according to the descriptions of the Qinghu Saint King and Hui Guang Saint, the Heavenly Dao demonic sound appeared after the Immortal Palace ascended.</p><p>Could it be that the vibrations of the Immortal Palace's ascension attracted her, and because she was trapped in the River of Misery, she could not extricate herself, her voice like demonic sound, misinterpreted by cultivators of the Storm World as the Heavenly Dao demonic sound?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more likely it seemed.</p><p>He had guessed countless times about the origin of the Heavenly Dao demonic sound, considering various possibilities, and hadn't forgotten to search for the cause when studying Daoist classics.</p><p>This is utterly preposterous and unbelievable!</p><p>If  Zi Lei Zhenren, Zhi Tan Da Shi, and the others—those incredibly talented individuals whose paths were cut short by the Heavenly Demon Sound—were to learn the truth, they would surely die with resentment.</p><p>The world is unpredictable.  Even the actions of powerful cultivators can bring about utter ruin for those of lower cultivation.  It's truly disheartening.</p><p>But if the "Blood Moon" isn't the enemy, then who are they fighting?</p><p>What is the origin of that palm print and the enemy who crossed the Blood Pool? And why did they know the Earth-Killing Sword was on Qin Sang?</p><p>"Could it be...?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  Aside from the Dao Court, there was only one other force he'd encountered beyond the Storm World!</p><p>The memory of his escape from the Wushen Mountain shrine, using the star platform, flooded back.  The star platform was activated, starlight poured down, only to be cut short by a bloody rainbow. He had considered the other party a savior.  Could the reality be completely opposite?</p><p>If this is the truth, then "Starlight" had its sights on the Earth-Killing Sword from the very beginning, and the woman saved him, guiding  Tian Yue Shangren to this realm to help him, while she herself grappled with the great enemy all this time.</p><p>Had he not walked right into a trap, even proactively provoking a powerful cultivator of the Mahayana stage?</p><p>Cold sweat broke out on Qin Sang. He instinctively glanced at the woman beside him. He realized she hadn't left with the Earth-Killing Sword, so it wasn't her true form.</p><p>The woman looked over.</p><p>"You must have many questions. Ask whatever you want. Time is short; I can't maintain this for long."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the woman's form becoming increasingly translucent.  Unsure where to begin, he hesitated, then said, "What merit do I possess?"</p><p>What merit did he possess to deserve her protection?  She not only shielded him from the enemy but also brought Tian Yue Shangren into this realm, carefully arranging opportunities for him. If it were only about retrieving the Earth-Killing Sword, she could have simply had Tian Yue Shangren take it.  Why go to such lengths?</p><p>The woman gazed at the Yunyou Sword beside Qin Sang, her expression tinged with sorrow.  "Because you are his successor, that's enough."</p><p>"Successor?  The Yuan Shen sword-nurturing chapter?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, pressing further. "Who is he?  And who are you?"</p><p>"Some revere him as the Ziwei Emperor, others as the Ziwei Sword Sovereign. But he dislikes those titles.  However, his sword seems to like the name 'Ziwei Emperor Sword'..."</p><p>Before she finished, the Earth-Killing Sword, about to break through the barrier, seemed to sense something and emitted a ringing sound.</p><p>"As for me," the woman said, a wistful and nostalgic look in her eyes, speaking in a soft murmur, "I was his first sword servant."</p><p>"Emperor, Sovereign, Emperor Sword, Sword Servant..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the implications of these titles, about to speak again, when he felt a disturbance in his sleeve. A red light burst forth.</p><p>Without his summoning, the Solar God Tree appeared.</p><p>This thing wasn't dead after all!</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself. He had just called out to the young Zhuque spirit, but there was no response, yet now it appeared on its own.</p><p>Along with the red light came a series of urgent shrieks.</p><p>"You! You! You!"</p><p>The Solar God Tree hovered before the First Sword Servant. The nine firebirds on its branches came alive, glaring angrily at the woman.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>...</p><p>The nine firebirds raised their wings simultaneously, trembling as they pointed at the First Sword Servant.  The young Zhuque spirit seemed extremely agitated, as though it recognized her.</p><p>Its cries were exceptionally sharp.  The nine firebirds' eyes were wide, more like they'd encountered an enemy, not a friend.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, remembering the young Zhuque spirit's vague recollection of being grabbed by the neck.  Could it have been the First Sword Servant who seized the young Zhuque spirit and used it to stoke the fire beneath the alchemy furnace?</p><p>"Ah! It was you! It was you!"</p><p>The young Zhuque spirit became more and more agitated.  It seemed to be overexcited and couldn't articulate anything coherent.</p><p>The First Sword Servant ignored the Solar God Bird and gazed at the base of the Solar God Tree, suddenly breaking into a smile.  "So it's that little fire crow."</p><p>With her smile, the hostile energy emanating from her lessened.</p><p>The Solar God Birds froze, then immediately bristled.</p><p>Old grudges and new grievances surged within the Zhuque spirit.  Anger welled up, and it screamed, "I am Zhuque!"</p><p>Unmoved, the First Sword Servant continued, "I never thought the Sword Pavilion would be destroyed, yet this little fire crow survives to this day. That's quite your destiny..."</p><p>"Ah! Ah! Ah!"</p><p>The young Zhuque spirit's rage flared.</p><p>The Solar God Tree swayed, and the nine Solar God Birds seemed about to take flight.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the First Sword Servant raised a finger, lightly touching the Solar God Tree. All the birds were immediately immobilized.</p><p>The flames within the Sun Tree solidified completely.</p><p>The young Suzaku, hidden within its true feather, sensed the First Sword Servant's immense power and its cry abruptly ceased. Terror gripped it.  It remembered that this person could once crush it like a chick, and now, if they chose to harm it, it would be utterly helpless.</p><p>*噗!*</p><p>Nine divine birds exploded simultaneously.</p><p>*呼!*</p><p>The flame power within the Sun Tree was completely extracted, forming a ball of fire with two fire feathers floating at its center: one true Suzaku feather, and one true Tianfeng feather.</p><p>Even after the flames were removed, the Sun Tree still glowed crimson, seemingly altered by years of refinement by the Suzaku's true fire.</p><p>The First Sword Servant singled out the Suzaku feather, holding it suspended at her fingertip.  Trembling and terrified energy emanated from it.</p><p>Before the young Suzaku could plead for mercy, the feather emitted a subtle cracking sound.  Downy fluff fell away, fissures spread across the shaft, and finally, it shattered into a raging inferno.</p><p>"Ah! Help!"</p><p>The Suzaku spirit's screams echoed from the flames.</p><p>Qin Sang, vaguely understanding, didn't interfere, his heart filled with awe.</p><p>The Suzaku spirit's cries weakened, and a silhouette gradually emerged from the fire, resembling a divine bird reborn from flames.</p><p>The First Sword Servant suddenly frowned and summoned the Tianfeng feather.</p><p>*啪!*</p><p>The Tianfeng feather shattered, transforming into strands of phoenix true fire that merged into the inferno.</p><p>The two distinctly different flames showed no conflict, blending seamlessly. The divine bird's form became increasingly clear.</p><p>Then, the First Sword Servant instructed Qin Sang to separate a strand of his divine sense and infuse it into the flames.</p><p>*轰!*</p><p>*唳!*</p><p>The flames soared skyward, accompanied by a resounding cry, as a divine bird spread its wings and took flight—a phoenix reborn from the ashes!</p><p>"I have a body! My body is restored!"</p><p>The young Suzaku was overjoyed and incredulous, flying around excitedly, its tiny claws scratching its body, repeatedly confirming the reality of its situation.  Joy overshadowed its hatred; it completely forgot its 'enemy' was still present.</p><p>Its body was only fist-sized, clearly a fledgling, lacking the grandeur of a Suzaku saint beast; it looked more like a fire crow.  Perhaps the creation of its form had exhausted the power of the two true feathers, for the flame energy it emitted was weaker than the combined power of the nine sun birds.</p><p>Nevertheless, everyone understood that the Suzaku's rebirth was profoundly significant.</p><p>"I disciplined you once before.  From now on, you will follow him. If you serve him well, I will pardon your past disrespect!"</p><p>The First Sword Servant, looking weary, her figure becoming more translucent, spoke faintly.</p><p>Lost in its joy, the Suzaku spirit wagged its tail, oblivious to the woman's words.</p><p>Astonishing skill!</p><p>Qin Sang was awestruck.  The young Suzaku's interruption had allowed him to clarify his thoughts.  Seeing this, he quickly spoke, prioritizing the questions concerning himself.</p><p>"Senior, what do you intend for me to do?"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the principle of "no work, no reward."  Past experiences had taught him that opportunities were not easily obtained.</p><p>"With your current cultivation, what could you possibly do?"</p><p>The woman's retort left Qin Sang speechless.</p><p>*轰隆隆!*</p><p>Suddenly, the earth shook violently. The tremor seemed to originate from beyond the boundary, with void storms spreading through the deep cosmos.</p><p>She glanced at the deep cosmos and continued, "You've inherited his mantle and gained the recognition of his sword; do you realize how many seek you?"</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this, but could only offer a wry smile. Who could have known that the Earth Slaughter Sword and the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* were connected to such a vast web?</p><p>"I need to heal, and I have much to do. I cannot constantly protect you. Since you can withstand the Lei Zu, with him as your protector, no one can divine your location. Though the Lei Zu is a remnant god, his Great Accomplishment rank remains, masking your aura and concealing your presence.  As long as you are careful, even in a direct confrontation, few in the world could discern your true origins!"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang finally understood.</p><p>No wonder Tian Yue Shang Ren had helped him achieve Nascent Soul in this realm.  It turned out they had a prior agreement with the Dao Court, scheming to provide him with a guardian god.  After achieving Nascent Soul, consolidating the Daoist sect's power to summon the Lei Zu or another deity of comparable rank would be far safer.</p><p>"Who are our enemies?"</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qin Sang pressed, using the word 'our'.</p><p>The inheritance also entailed its karmic consequences.  This didn't mean Qin Sang truly trusted the First Sword Servant and Tian Yue Shang Ren, ready to irrevocably tie himself to their cause.  He understood something else:</p><p>Sometimes, one's allegiance is determined at birth.  One can switch allegiances, but first, one must be powerful enough to be sought after by various factions, and strong enough to bear any consequences!</p><p>"If I said, 'all the world'?"</p><p>The First Sword Servant replied with deep meaning.</p>
