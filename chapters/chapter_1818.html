Chapter 1809: Reflections in Water


Qin Sang's divine sense probed into the jade slip, and half of a secret manual imprinted itself upon his mind.
It truly utilized the Dao of Poisons for body refinement, but the manual was nameless. Qingdan Yuanjun claimed to have obtained it by chance, stating it wasn't a true inheritance of the Lougu Mountain, otherwise, she wouldn't have given it to an outsider.
Judging from the first half, it was quite peculiar, but whether it was as profound as Qingdan Yuanjun claimed, he would have to see the complete manual to be sure.
Qin Sang put away the jade slip and observed the palace ahead.
The palace floated within the poisonous mist, seeming to drift ceaselessly like the clusters of fog.
Qin Sang guessed there must be some connection and pattern between the fog clusters and the palace. The fog clusters likely revolved around the palace.
Previously, Qingdan Yuanjun had followed the fog clusters for a long time, presumably using them to locate the palace.
“Are there also flower fields and strange flower spirits within the palace?”
This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, adding to his vigilance.
From outside the palace, one couldn't see much. All the palaces were shrouded in a dense, poisonous mist, even thicker than the fog clusters.
Furthermore, there were undoubtedly powerful formations and restrictions within the palace, merging with the poisonous mist to isolate external perception and prying eyes.
What they could see were the roofs of the palaces and the exquisitely carved ridge beasts.
The ridge beasts included jackals, wolves, tigers, leopards, dragons, phoenixes, and auspicious beasts, not unlike those on mortal palaces. It was impossible to discern the palace's origins from these.
Within the Jushan Healing Altar, besides the outermost golden hall, man-made halls and pavilions were quite rare.
Deep within the Healing Altar, even if halls and pavilions existed, they were illusions conjured by the divine powers of ancient mighty figures.
This place seemed different. At least Qin Sang and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly hadn't detected any flaws.
The palace complex was vast, but the number of buildings wasn't large, less than a hundred in total, both large and small.
Extending from the central courtyard to the rear were several palaces that, judging by their size, appeared to be the main halls.
“We’ll enter from the central courtyard,” Qingdan Yuanjun said in a deep voice, looking towards the main halls.
Qin Sang finally couldn't help but ask, “Shouldn't you two fellow Daoists tell this poor Daoist what you are truly seeking?”
Qingdan Yuanjun hesitated for a moment. Since they had arrived here, there was indeed no need for concealment. She nodded and said, "This poor Daoist is searching for a spirit tree. This tree is of great significance to our Lougu Mountain.  This poor Daoist once saw a fleeting phantom image of that spirit tree within the palace, confirming its existence within…"
Gesturing towards the main halls, she continued, “This tree should be near those palaces. As long as Fellow Daoist helps me find it, this poor Daoist will not only present the secret manual with both hands, but the treasures within the palace will also be yours to choose from first.”
Qin Sang smiled faintly.  They hadn't yet entered the palace, and whether treasures existed within was unknown. It was too early to discuss such matters.
Unexpectedly, Qingdan Yuanjun paused, then added meaningfully, “This secret manual was obtained by this poor Daoist within the palace.”
Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly at these words.
So the manual originated from here. Qingdan Yuanjun knew how to use another's flower to offer Buddha. Since there was a manual, there was a possibility of other treasures.
Judging by Qingdan Yuanjun's tone, she had only explored the outer areas of the palace before.  Logically, the treasures within the main halls would certainly be of higher grade.
Qin Sang had to admit, his interest was piqued.
At this moment, a cluster of fog drifted over from the distance.
The three waited for the fog to pass, then their figures flashed, arriving at the entrance of the palace's central courtyard.
There should have been a gate at the entrance, but whether it had been removed by Qingdan Yuanjun or was originally like this, the empty doorway revealed the scene within.
A garden!
Flowers bloomed in profusion, with peach blossoms pink and willow branches green.
The moment he saw the garden, Qin Sang's mind tightened involuntarily, and he subconsciously stopped.
Seeing Qin Sang's reaction, Boxian Shanren chuckled. "This poor Daoist was the same as Fellow Daoist when I first arrived, nearly frightened. Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, this garden is different from the flower fields in the fog clusters. These are just mortal flowers, without flower spirits. However, after entering the palace, there's one thing to be aware of. The palace is different from the outside. The poisonous mist here will silently invade us, gradually accumulating toxins. It shouldn't be underestimated."
Qin Sang pondered, "The poisonous mist inside and outside seems to be the same. So, the mist outside isn't non-toxic, but rather the accumulation isn't sufficient?"
If that was the case, Qin Sang also needed to be cautious, as his poison-repelling armor hadn't reacted either.
“Perhaps…”
Boxian Shanren couldn't offer a definite explanation. He followed Qingdan Yuanjun into the central courtyard, and Qin Sang followed at a slower pace.
The garden was large and square.
Despite no one tending them, the flowers thrived, yet none were spirit flowers. The garden's owner seemed to have chosen them for their appearance.
Revisiting a familiar place, Qingdan Yuanjun moved with practiced ease and speed.
Qin Sang casually observed the palace environment, finding no danger.
At the end of the garden was an arched gateway. According to Qingdan Yuanjun, the central courtyard should lead directly to the main hall, connected by a series of arched gateways.
The archway was open, the path clear, yet it wasn't so easy to traverse.
She divided the palace into nine sections. Previously, they had reached the seventh section at their furthest point, stopping there.
"Was the strange poison that afflicted your disciple from the main hall?" Qin Sang hadn't sensed any aura similar to that strange power along the way.
Both Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren frowned.
Boxian Shanren hesitated. “They were indeed afflicted by the strange poison while escaping the palace, but whether the poison originated from within, we still can’t be certain.”
"What do you mean?" Qin Sang asked, puzzled.
"When the tremors came, this poor Daoist and Fellow Daoist Qingdan were helping our disciples stabilize the formation. The strange poison suddenly appeared beside us, as if seeping out from the void…”
Boxian Shanren briefly recounted what had happened.
Qin Sang furrowed his brow in thought.
As they spoke, they had already entered the second section of the palace.  Along the way, banging sounds continued.
Their enemies were stone statues of beasts, crouched beside the garden as if guarding the flowers.  After they entered the palace, the stone beasts were roused, attacking them furiously.
Qin Sang didn't intervene, allowing Boxian Shanren and Qingdan Yuanjun to handle them, conserving his strength.
Unstoppable, the three passed through six arched gateways in succession, entering the seventh section, the place where they had stopped last time.
The seventh section was drastically different from the previous six.
There was no garden here, only two stone walls flanking a wide passage, yet it gave off a strangely oppressive feeling.
A straight passage led to the next arched gateway.  Two ferocious stone beasts with bizarre appearances stood before the gateway, and the gateway itself was sealed by a gate of light.
The gate of light shimmered with a green glow within the poisonous mist, appearing as a thin, fragile curtain.
The moment they stepped into the passage, a ‘咔咔’ sound came from ahead. The stone beasts twisted their necks, staring fixedly at them.
An oppressive aura emanated from the stone beasts. Qin Sang's expression turned serious, realizing that the strength of these two stone beasts far surpassed those they had encountered previously.
“Breaking this gate will require Fellow Daoist’s assistance,” Boxian Shanren transmitted his voice, explaining their pre-determined strategy.
Qin Sang considered for a moment, then nodded in agreement.
Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren’s faces lit up with joy.  Exchanging a glance, they walked towards the two stone beasts respectively.
Qin Sang remained behind, gazing at the light gate with a contemplative look.
Halfway down the passage, Qin Sang's gaze flickered, his figure pausing imperceptibly for a moment before continuing forward as if nothing had happened.
Meanwhile, within his dantian, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's gaze fell upon the right wall.
The walls on both sides of the passage were built with red bricks, but they were certainly not ordinary walls.
When Qingdan Yuanjun first came here, she had tried to bypass the stone beasts ahead, but couldn’t find another path.  She attempted to climb over or destroy the walls, but this only enraged the two stone beasts and attracted all the other stone beasts within the palace, nearly leading to their demise.
She specifically warned Qin Sang to restrain his energy fluctuations and stay away from the walls when fighting the stone beasts.
Now, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had discovered something unusual. There seemed to be a hidden door on the wall!
Qin Sang secretly circulated a secret technique, helping the Heaven's Eye Butterfly exert its full power, confirming his suspicion.
Where did the hidden door lead?
Even Qingdan Yuanjun didn't know what lay beyond the wall.
Qin Sang remained impassive, glancing at the backs of the two True People, but didn't reveal his discovery, returning his attention to the light gate.
As they drew closer, the stone beasts gradually came to life, preparing to pounce, roaring warnings from their mouths.
Qingdan Yuanjun seemed not to hear, her pace unwavering.  With a wave of her jade hand, the sound of water echoed through the passage.
Ripples spread through the void, and Qingdan Yuanjun’s true body vanished into the water, rapidly approaching the stone beast along with the ripples.
‘Roar!’
The intruder had crossed the stone beast’s bottom line.
The stone beast roared furiously, lunging without hesitation, sending a gust of wind towards the intruder.  A large splash of water erupted, and the stone beast vanished along with Qingdan Yuanjun.
The other stone beast was already locked in battle with Boxian Shanren.
The stone beast seemed to have been soaked in venom for countless years. Even its simple attacks carried intense poison. Boxian Shanren, shrouded in a thick, warm jade light, didn't dare let the stone beast get close.
If one didn't know methods of warding off poison, they would be greatly hindered, unable to exert their full strength.
Seeing the two stone beasts entangled, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. His figure flashed repeatedly, swiftly arriving before the light gate.
Recalling the instructions of the two True People, Qin Sang pressed both hands against the gate of light.
In the next moment, Qin Sang's fingers were stained a blackish-green, as if potent poison was seeping into his body.
In reality, Qin Sang was actively absorbing the poison.
The light gate was a kind of poison restriction. After numerous attempts, the only method Qingdan Yuanjun had conceived to break it was to actively absorb the poison, weakening its power.
One person wasn't enough.  They would succumb to the poison before breaking the gate. It required others to share the burden.
This was precisely why they valued Qin Sang, who possessed a secret manual for detoxification.
The poison entered his body, immediately suppressed by the power of the poison pearl within him. The poisonous energy from the light gate was continuously absorbed by Qin Sang, its glow quickly dimming.
Qingdan Yuanjun and Boxian Shanren, fully engaged in battling the stone beasts, anxiously watched Qin Sang.
He didn’t disappoint. In a short time, Qin Sang had absorbed a large amount of poison, yet his expression remained unchanged, not reaching his limit.
Seeing this, the two were overjoyed.
But as Qin Sang continued to absorb the poison, the stone beasts suddenly let out earth-shattering roars.
The ground trembled violently.
The tremors came from behind.  All the stone beasts in the palace had been awakened by the roars.
“Hurry!” Boxian Shanren shouted.
Countless beasts were charging from behind. Time was of the essence.
Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He instantly absorbed a large amount of poison, his hands turning dark green, his fingernails almost black.
Then, he stepped back, withdrawing his hands.
Qin Sang retreated, forcefully suppressing the intense poison within him.  Without time to recover, he darted towards the right. Simultaneously, Boxian Shanren also rushed forward, taking Qin Sang's place.
‘Whoosh!’
The Grey Warbler Sword shot out, transforming mid-air into the Seven Stellar Regions Sword Formation, perfectly enveloping the incoming stone beast.
Qin Sang glanced outside the passage, suppressing the intense poison while contending with the stone beast.
The stone beast charged and rampaged within the starry sky conjured by the sword formation, but couldn’t break free.
Having received the sword dao inheritance and meticulous guidance from the Sword Holding True Person, Qin Sang's understanding of the sword formation had vastly improved. He had mastered it a year ago!
The stone beasts couldn't be truly killed, only trapped.  Therefore, this wasn't the full might of the sword formation.
Boxian Shanren lasted less than half as long as Qin Sang before retreating, replaced by Qingdan Yuanjun.
The three rotated like this for three rounds.
By this time, countless stone beasts had charged into the passage.
As if on cue, the three suddenly rushed towards the light gate.  Qin Sang threw a punch, Qingdan Yuanjun wielded an emerald green wooden staff, and Boxian Shanren utilized a divine talisman, conjuring a sharp cone.
‘Boom!’
The three attacks struck the light gate simultaneously.
With a loud bang, the light gate shattered, collapsing completely.
‘Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!’
The three passed directly through the light gate.  What met their eyes was an enormous training ground.
The training ground was exceptionally spacious, the arched gateway on the opposite side clearly visible.
Unexpectedly, the final arched gateway was wide open, with no stone beasts guarding it.
Qingdan Yuanjun was both surprised and delighted. She had already prepared for the possibility of returning empty-handed, planning to investigate the formation restrictions on the final arched gateway first and return better prepared.
Unexpectedly, it seemed they could enter the main hall directly!
‘Rumble…'
The stone beasts charged into the training ground after them, their eyes bloodshot, madly rushing forward, determined to tear the intruders apart.
The three didn't hesitate, heading straight for the final archway, passing through with surprising ease.
At the same time, the surrounding clamor vanished.
They were astonished to see that the frenzied stone beasts all stopped at the archway.  The training ground was packed with stone beasts, roaring incessantly, yet they didn't dare cross the archway, as if an invisible barrier blocked their path.
The three exchanged glances, ignoring the stone beasts, their gazes drawn to a spirit tree within the courtyard.
The spirit tree was small, only the height of a person, seemingly not yet fully grown.  The tree bore no fruit, but its leaves curled into spherical shapes, resembling hanging green lanterns, quite peculiar.
“That's it!”
A look of delight flashed in Qingdan Yuanjun's eyes. Taking a deep breath, she stepped forward, about to walk towards the spirit tree.  Remembering something, she took out another jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang.
As agreed, the spirit tree belonged to Qingdan Yuanjun.
The behavior of the stone beasts made them wary. Only after confirming there were no anomalies around the spirit tree did Qingdan Yuanjun slowly approach.
Boxian Shanren looked at Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist Qingfeng, there are two main halls behind us. How about we each enter one?"
Directly behind the spirit tree, two ancient palaces stood in the center, holding the most esteemed positions.
“Alright!”
Qin Sang nodded.
They each set up a spirit formation at the entrance as a precaution.
The two main halls appeared identical from the outside. They each chose one at random and walked to the doors.
The restrictions on the doors weren't poison restrictions.
Qin Sang observed for a moment, nodding inwardly. Given some time, breaking the restriction wouldn't be difficult.
True Essence surged, and hand seals flew from his fingertips, sinking into the door. Multicolored lights flickered continuously.
The restrictions were being broken layer by layer.
Qin Sang's eyes suddenly narrowed as he noticed faint ripples spreading across the door, as if it were distorting.
“This is…”
Qin Sang frowned. A moment later, his expression changed drastically, and he turned around, shouting sharply, “Stop!”
At that moment, Qingdan Yuanjun sat cross-legged before the spirit tree, her hands raised, an invisible force entwining the tree, pulling it up inch by inch, roots and all.
In an instant, the entire palace, along with the surrounding void, rippled like a shattered reflection in water!
