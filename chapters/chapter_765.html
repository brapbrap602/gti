<h1>Chapter 757: The Shattering Earth Sect</h1><p>“Still daring to quibble!”</p><p>Xiang Yi roared, his eyes icy cold. “Cui Ji, do you think Xiang’s blade isn’t sharp enough, that I dare not kill?  You’ve jeopardized the Merchant Alliance’s mission; I’ll take your life first!”</p><p>The richly dressed fat man, seeing the tense atmosphere, stepped between them, mediating. “Daoist Xiang, please calm down.  I’m sure Daoist Cui wouldn’t have acted if he thought it would affect the mission. The beast appeared suddenly, the situation was urgent, and you were in the stone chamber; there was no time to consult with you…”</p><p>As he spoke, the fat man subtly winked at Cui Ji.</p><p>“Daoist Cui, you were so eager to kill Daoist Qingfeng. I hear you’ve been stuck at a cultivation bottleneck for over ten years, with no breakthrough. Could this man be your demon, the obstacle preventing your advancement?”</p><p>Cui Ji bowed his head in apology to Xiang Yi, shaking his head. “This bottleneck has been unusually stubborn. I’ve been struggling for years, nearly despairing. Then I heard that the Seven Kills Hall had a spirit medicine that might help me break through. I don't know for sure if this demon cultivator is my mental block.  It wasn’t strictly necessary to kill him; I haven't completely let go of our twenty-year-old grudge. But on Desolate Island, the moment I saw him, an uncontrollable rage flared within me.  It must have had an impact. To be safe, it was best to kill him, lest the mental block waste the medicine…”</p><p>The richly dressed fat man nodded. “Daoist Xiang, the two of us followed your orders and watched everyone carefully. I also secretly approached and investigated; besides this Pan fellow, everyone else seems fine.  Wasn’t it said that six people are enough to break the formation?  Daoist Cui acted rashly, but at least he didn’t ruin the main mission.”</p><p>Seeing Xiang Yi’s expression soften slightly, both the richly dressed fat man and Cui Ji secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>The richly dressed fat man pointed to the severed corpse on the ground. “Daoist Xiang, are you sure about his identity?”</p><p>“Shattering Earth Sect!”</p><p>Xiang Yi kicked the giant beast’s corpse. “See this Earth-Splitting Lizard? They are vicious creatures. Only the Shattering Earth Sect has the secret techniques to tame them. This man’s Earth-Splitting Lizard possesses the shocking strength of a late-stage Yaodan cultivator, rare even in the Shattering Earth Sect. This shows his status was definitely extraordinary. And he was concealing his strength; his cultivation was only slightly weaker than mine. If the Alliance Leader hadn’t given me a Water-Gang Divine Thunder, he might have succeeded.”</p><p>“A Water-Gang Divine Thunder? No wonder it was such a commotion! I heard it’s a water-attribute treasure only Yuan Ying masters who cultivate the Water-Gang Divine Scripture and similar techniques can refine, and it takes considerable time. Its power is astonishing.”</p><p>The fat man looked down at the cultivator surnamed Pan, clicking his tongue.  “Shattering Earth Sect?  Could he be from the Demon Path?  Unbelievable!  It seems our Merchant Alliance has been targeted by the Demon Path.”</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded.</p><p>“What’s so strange about that? The three major merchant alliances are thorns in the eyes of both the Righteous and Demon Paths. If we weren’t united and kept to ourselves, never showing ambition, we would have been destroyed by a joint attack long ago. Many cultivators from both the Righteous and Demon Paths are employed by the various merchant guilds in the Demon Sea, but only as guest lecturers.  Someone like this, infiltrating the core of the alliance, definitely has ulterior motives.  This mission arranged by the Alliance Leader prompted him to reveal himself and try to seize it. Whether he acted on the Demon Path's orders or on his own initiative remains unknown. The Earth-Splitting Lizard excels at earth遁术. He must have released the lizard in the canyon. With his abilities, it wasn’t difficult to evade our senses. Then he commanded the lizard to lure the Purple Star Eagle, creating chaos to fish in troubled waters.”</p><p>The richly dressed fat man chuckled. “This guy is cunning, but he's still no match for Daoist Xiang.  He never expected us to be prepared.  The real mission is yet to come. This stone chamber is merely the first step. Daoist Xiang used a little trick to lure him out.  However…”</p><p>The richly dressed fat man’s tone changed, his face showing confusion. “From what Daoist Xiang says, this mission wasn’t difficult. The Alliance dispatched a Yuan Ying master, who could have easily completed it.  Why go to such lengths, and even let a demon spy infiltrate?”</p><p>Xiang Yi glanced at him. “How do you know a Yuan Ying master wasn’t here?”</p><p>Cui Ji and the fat man looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p>“The three major merchant alliances are watched closely by both paths. We wouldn’t easily dispatch a Yuan Ying master; those seniors surely have their own missions. And spies infiltrating is inevitable; the Alliance isn’t like a sect; the various guilds are independent and can’t be strictly controlled. To appease everyone, the Alliance Leader can’t monopolize the quota. We can only be vigilant ourselves and weed out the spies.”</p><p>Xiang Yi turned towards the battlefield. “Alright, we’ve wasted enough time. Let's go rescue Daoist Liu and the others, before they're killed by the beasts.”</p><p>Regarding past events, Xiang will let bygones be bygones.  But anyone who dares to neglect their duty again, will face Xiang's wrath!</p><p>The richly dressed fat man chuckled, "Thank you for your trust, Daoist Xiang. We will diligently complete the task. Besides, An is relying on Daoist Xiang's help to obtain the treasure, how dare we be the slightest bit negligent?"</p><p>Cui Ji hastily nodded in agreement.</p><p>Xiang Yi led the charge into the battlefield, then suddenly remembered something and turned to Cui Ji, "Are you certain that Daoist Qingfeng is dead?"</p><p>Cui Ji thumped his chest, "Rest assured, Daoist friend. I was well-prepared. I severely wounded him, saw with my own eyes the poison mist enter his body, and he was overwhelmed by the beast horde. He's undoubtedly dead, and will absolutely not cause any trouble for Daoist Xiang."</p><p>…</p><p>As they entered the battlefield to rescue people, Qin Sang silently appeared at the edge of the large pit.</p><p>The situation was vastly different from what he expected.</p><p>It turned out Xiang Yi was fishing, and the richly dressed fat man and Cui Ji had long been recruited by Xiang Yi.</p><p>From this perspective, Cui Ji's surprise attack wasn't a bad thing. Otherwise, he might have faced a siege by the three of them, which would have been far more dangerous.</p><p>If Cui Ji was a venomous snake, the richly dressed fat man was a smiling tiger, and Xiang Yi was even worse.</p><p>He had no grievances with the two men, and they were just chatting amicably a moment ago, yet they could readily agree to help Cui Ji kill him without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the cultivator surnamed Pan and the earth-splitting lizard.</p><p>The moment the anomaly occurred, they were thrown away by the earth-splitting lizard and couldn't see clearly. It turned out that it wasn't a wild beast from the desolate land, but the spirit beast of the cultivator surnamed Pan.</p><p>"Lie Tu Sect… demonic path…"</p><p>Qin Sang overheard their conversation.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Lie Tu Sect before; it seemed to be one of the major demonic sects.</p><p>Qin Sang had been active in the Demon Sea and only had a superficial understanding of the Inner Sea.</p><p>To his knowledge, in the Inner Sea, humanity is thriving, righteous and demonic cultivators clash, three major merchant alliances have risen, and there are many other large and small forces and independent cultivators, either secluded or choosing neutrality.</p><p>Adding to this are the ever-watchful Witch Clan, making the situation extremely complex.</p><p>Opening up the Demon Sea has clearly eased the situation in the Inner Sea; otherwise, a war would have erupted long ago.</p>
