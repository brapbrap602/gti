<h1>Chapter 307: To Kill</h1><p>Chapter 307: To Kill</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang hid Yunyouzi inside a cave. When he emerged, he looked back only to see that Luo Xingnan wasn't even hiding his pursuit, and was openly chasing after him.</p><p>His spiritual energy depletion was a ruse. He had only used the spiritual bamboo raft to increase the distance between him and Luo Xingnan to buy some time. He naturally wouldn't wait until his spiritual energy was completely exhausted before he stopped.</p><p>However, he couldn't ignore the bouts of sharp pain originating from his dantian as a result of overusing spiritual pills and spiritual stones.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was starting to pale. He ignored the pain that came from his dantian and sneered as his figure flickered and disappeared from where he stood.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>As Luo Xingnan drew closer, a sudden flash of blueish-green light emerged from the mountains.</p><p>Armed with his spirit treasure, Jade Ruyi, Qin Sang shot into the sky like a dragon rising from the water.</p><p>From the moment the Jade Ruyi revealed itself to when it arrived before Luo Xingnan, mere moments had passed.</p><p>If this were any other person being ambushed by a spirit treasure, they would not have had the time to react and would have likely met a tragic end.</p><p>However, despite facing the fierce momentum of the Jade Ruyi, Luo Xingnan did not show any signs of panic. He merely sneered and raised his palm, causing a small silver-white dagger to emerge.</p><p>The dagger's design was somewhat peculiar. It bore some resemblance to a dagger, with a slightly curved tip and an exquisite handle wrapped in silk. It emitted a radiant silver glow.</p><p>Luo Xingnan waved his hand and the silver knife's handle swung like a fish. The instant it moved, it became a blur and shot straight towards the Jade Ruyi.</p><p>"Do you really think you're the only one who has a spirit treasure? If you had run alone, I might have spared you the trouble," Luo Xingnan sneered, "But to think you would ambush me with a mere spirit treasure is simply foolish!"</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two spirit treasures collided. A blinding light erupted from them and radiated in all directions.</p><p>The impact of the resulting shockwave directly sheared off the peak of a nearby mountain.</p><p>Rumble...</p><p>Rocks tumbled down with an earth-shattering sound.</p><p>In the air, the blueish-green light of the Jade Ruyi and the white light of the silver knife clashed fiercely, neither giving way to the other. They seemed to be evenly matched in a stalemate. However, not long after, the blueish-green light from the Jade Ruyi began to dim.</p><p>The difference in strength between the two individuals controlling the spirit treasures became apparent. Qin Sang's cultivation was an entire level lower than Luo Xingnan's. As he controlled the spirit treasure, his spiritual energy drained away like flowing water. Inwardly, he cursed.</p><p>For Luo Xingnan, the rate of spiritual energy depletion was admittedly quite high, but it was still far better than Qin Sang's.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's face lit up with joy, as this was entirely within his expectations.</p><p>With his superior cultivation level, he could exhaust Qin Sang even if he relied on attrition alone.</p><p>Moreover, he had personally witnessed Qin Sang using the spirit treasure to resist the Shadow Serpents in the cave. He knew that the spirit treasure's power was almost depleted, and Qin Sang's ability to persevere would be even shorter.</p><p>This was a desperate struggle.</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan remained cautious.</p><p>He still hadn't seen Shangguan Lifeng or Yunyouzi, especially the latter.</p><p>The scene of Yunyouzi's attack on the Shadow Serpents had deeply unnerved Luo Xingnan, and he couldn't help but feel grateful that he had not directly confronted the old man. If he had, he might have met the same fate.</p><p>Although Yunyouzi seemed extremely weak, that did not necessarily mean that he didn't have the ability to launch another attack. Who knew if he was intentionally feigning weakness to set a trap?</p><p>While Luo Xingnan concentrated on maintaining his spirit treasure, he remained vigilant, keeping his Yin-Yang Compass ready.</p><p>However, the situation he had anticipated never occurred. Luo Xingnan shifted his focus back to Qin Sang.</p><p>The silver knife let out a long whirr as its white light intensified. The blueish-green light was forced to recede, becoming outmatched. The Jade Ruyi's trembling sounded as if it were wailing.</p><p>Luo Xingnan grew impatient and shouted, "Surrender now and I may spare your life. If you continue your futile resistance, I will surely tear you to pieces!"</p><p>Qin Sang turned a deaf ear to him and suddenly let out a muffled groan as he frantically poured his spiritual energy into the spirit treasure.</p><p>The Jade Ruyi's light grew brighter, momentarily pushing the silver knife back.</p><p>"A desperate flare-up?"</p><p>Luo Xingnan was not alarmed, but secretly sneered. He immediately intensified his spiritual energy and fought against it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Jade Ruyi's light grew increasingly brighter, showing no signs of stopping. At the final moment, it suddenly exploded with a loud bang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that he didn't have much spiritual energy left, so he couldn't continue to exhaust it. He decided to detonate the spirit treasure's remaining energy and then flee.</p><p>Turbulence erupted, and the silver knife bore the brunt of the spirit treasure's explosion. It was not severely damaged, but it was still jolted by the shockwave.</p><p>Luo Xingnan gave a great shout, forcibly stabilized the silver blade, and immediately urged it to pursue Qin Sang.</p><p>At the same time, Luo Xingnan took back some of his spiritual power, turned his palm over to aim the yin and yang compass at Qin Sang's back, and shot out a white light.</p><p>With this two-pronged attack, Qin Sang was surely doomed.</p><p>At this critical juncture, a sword light suddenly flew back from within Qin Sang's body and exploded with sword energy, forcibly dispelling the pulling force of the yin and yang compass.</p><p>But immediately afterwards, with a crisp sound, the Ebony Sword was hit in the center of the blade by the silver blade and sent flying into the sky, somersaulting around like a headless fly, and then falling to the ground weakly.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to be escaping for his life, not having the mind to control his own magic weapon.</p><p>The silver blade paused, and continued to pursue.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang had used up all his methods and had no way to escape, Luo Xingnan was overjoyed and flashed past instantly, intending to pursue him closely, but a change occurred just as he began to move.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A blast of extremely cold, dark wind blew up from below.</p><p>Six enormous flagpoles grew taller as they faced the wind, forming a massive ghost banner magic array that instantly enveloped the area, and Luo Xingnan happened to be right at the center of the array.</p><p>Qin Sang had secretly set up the Ten Directions阎罗 Array long ago, but had been hiding it the whole time, concealing it under the light of the Jade Ruyi, and used his own body as bait to lure away the talisman treasure, unleashing it only now.</p><p>The sound of howling ghosts filled the air.</p><p>Luo Xingnan was shocked and immediately used the yin and yang compass to protect himself.</p><p>Although he was somewhat prepared, he did not expect Qin Sang to have such a powerful secret weapon.</p><p>He now had two choices: to quickly summon his talisman treasure to protect him, or to continue killing Qin Sang, as long as he killed Qin Sang, the crisis would be lifted.</p><p>Luo Xingnan was unusually calm and immediately made a decision.</p><p>However, the power of the Ten Directions 阎罗 Array far exceeded his imagination.</p><p>There were powerful evil ghosts hidden among the ghost energy that easily shattered the yin and yang compass's protective light, and then the ghost threads slipped in everywhere, madly rushing towards Luo Xingnan, instantly drowning him.</p><p>The ghost threads burned his soul, causing him a sudden and maddening pain.</p><p>Luo Xingnan screamed.</p><p>His spiritual power and divine sense fluctuated wildly, beginning to destabilize.</p><p>Not giving Luo Xingnan any chance to recover, Shangguan Lifeng, who had been hiding in the dark, finally made a move.</p><p>In the mountains, a dazzling blade energy tore through the void. Shangguan Lifeng, brandishing his saber, charged into the array, unstoppable!</p><p>In response to the blade energy, the "out of control" Ebony Sword sprang into action!</p>
