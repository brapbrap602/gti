<h1>Chapter 801: The Four Sacred Mountains</h1><p>Compared to the Demon Sea, the Inner Sea has far more restrictions.  Many forces choose not to join the Righteous or Demonic paths, refusing to participate in their conflicts.  However, unable to directly confront them, they can only outwardly comply.  No wonder those Yuan Ying elders willingly abandon their Inner Sea holdings to become island kings in the Demon Sea—it's all for a life of freedom.</p><p>After continuous flight, Qin Sang finally saw the outline of Tianxing Island.  This island is of immense significance to humanity, a true cradle of civilization.  The later teleportation array to the Demon Sea was also established on Tianxing Island. Therefore, even though it's not located in the center of the Canglang Sea, but rather to the east, it remains a sacred place for humanity.</p><p>The Righteous and Demonic paths jointly govern the island, and Tianxing City, built on it, gradually developed into the largest human city. Tianxing City is vast, with countless cultivators gathering here.  Add to that the common people who live here, and the city teems with people, a constant flow—a sight unseen in Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>Visiting Tianxing Island for the second time, Qin Sang was still awestruck by its grandeur.  He had briefly visited before, and knew where to find a cave dwelling for rent.</p><p>Within Tianxing City, there are four sacred mountains, where the island's spiritual veins converge. These Four Sacred Mountains are named after four predecessors who once saved humanity during its darkest hour, serving as places of veneration.</p><p>One sacred mountain houses a teleportation array and is the most heavily guarded area of Tianxing Island.  The cave dwellings on two other sacred mountains are allocated to cultivators of the Righteous and Demonic paths respectively. The last one is available for rent to independent cultivators or outsiders.</p><p>Cave dwellings in Tianxing City are expensive, but their quality is undeniable.  Having recently acquired the legacies of two powerful cultivators, Qin Sang could easily afford one, a luxury not afforded to most others.</p><p>After admiring Tianxing City, Qin Sang moved swiftly, appearing before a city gate.  At the same time, streaks of light frequently appeared from all directions, entering and leaving Tianxing Island through its various gates, a clear indication of the density of cultivators within the city.</p><p>The number of commoners is even greater.  Roads extend outward from the city, and countless ships sail offshore; a scene of prosperity and vitality. Commoners and cultivators enter and exit through different gates.</p><p>Tianxing City is protected by a powerful defensive array, and Qin Sang had no wish to test the strength of the city guards, so he approached the gate honestly.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared.  Although the guards were of low cultivation, they somehow accurately detected Qin Sang's cultivation level. Their faces instantly changed to respectful ones. "Junior greets senior. Have you been to Tianxing City before? If you have a token, you may enter directly. Senior is a Foundation Establishment cultivator; you do not need to pay spirit stones."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a token he had prepared earlier.  "After reaching Foundation Establishment, I've been active in the Demon Sea.  I only have a token from Da Huang Island. Will that suffice?"</p><p>Obtaining such tokens wasn't difficult; Qin Sang used two identities to acquire two from Da Huang Island.  The Righteous and Demonic paths likely felt confident in their strength, unconcerned about petty thieves. Both Tianxing City and Da Huang Island possess a broad-minded attitude.  However, Da Huang Island's spiritual veins are far inferior to those of Tianxing Island.</p><p>Using the teleportation array is a significant expense; one wouldn't use it for casual trips.</p><p>"So senior has been hunting demons in the Demon Sea," the guard said, his tone even more respectful.  He gestured invitingly. "Tokens from both cities are interchangeable. Please enter, senior."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't move, asking, "I wish to cultivate here for a while and rent a cave dwelling. What else do I need?"</p><p>The guard inquired, "May I ask senior's sect or affiliation?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I am an independent cultivator."</p><p>The guard nodded understandingly, pointing towards one of the sacred mountains.  "Senior, if you wish to rent a dwelling, go to Baogu Mountain with your token.  The mountain certainly has suitable dwellings for you. The quality and price of the dwellings increase as you go from the foot to the summit.  If you need it, I can call a guide for you…"</p><p>Baogu was one of the Four Saints, and a female cultivator.</p><p>As he spoke, the guard called out, and several people immediately emerged from behind the gate—low-level cultivators and commoners.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang chose a young commoner.</p><p>The man was in his early twenties, with a sly look, like a petty scoundrel, but he dared not show any disrespect before Qin Sang. He had learned of Qin Sang's cultivation from the guard—the cultivator could crush him with a single finger.  He was also quite surprised that such a powerful cultivator would choose him.</p><p>"Take me to the real estate agency where commoners buy houses. This is your reward," Qin Sang tossed the young man a spirit stone.</p><p>Apart from the areas around the Four Sacred Mountains, the rest of Tianxing City was occupied by commoners and low-level cultivators, comprising the vast majority of the city's area.</p><p>The young man clutched the spirit stone, his face beaming with joy. He repeatedly agreed, not daring to say a word more. "Senior cultivator, please follow me."</p><p>Low-altitude flight was permitted within the city.  Impatient to walk, Qin Sang lifted the young man by the scruff of his neck, urging him to lead the way.</p><p>A short while later…</p><p>They walked down several streets.  A young man, trembling, pointed to a small building in the distance and whispered, “Master, that’s the most reputable real estate agency. They only handle the best properties in the city, though the prices are rather high. Of course, for a cultivator like yourself, it's nothing.”</p><p>“I understand. You may go.”</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the young man.</p><p>He had the young man point out several agencies. He planned to disguise himself as an ordinary person and purchase a courtyard near Mount Bagu at a later date, to use as a contact point for Madam Liu.</p><p>Matters concerning Xiang Yi and the leader of the Dongji Alliance demanded caution.</p><p>Leaving the young man behind, Qin Sang flew on his sword towards Mount Bagu, finding the place where cave dwellings were rented at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Even with his considerable wealth, the rental prices for the caves made him wince. But Mount Si Sheng was located above the largest spiritual vein on Tianxing Island, making the high cost understandable.  The abundance of spiritual energy was undeniable.</p><p>Cultivation in a mountain cave would significantly speed up his progress.</p><p>In the end, he chose a location as close to the summit as possible, renting it for thirty years. After paying the spirit stones, he received the jade talisman activating the cave's protective array.</p><p>The cave was built into the mountainside, not far from the summit. From the entrance, he could see the statue of Bagu at the peak.</p><p>The statue was breathtakingly beautiful, a fitting tribute to the greatest cultivator of that era.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the jade talisman, opening the protective array. Inside, he found the cave dwelling spacious and serene.  He wouldn't feel confined even after decades of seclusion.</p><p>He was used to austere cultivation and didn’t mind the surroundings. After a thorough inspection, he set up another isolation array before truly feeling at ease.</p><p>“This will be my cultivation place from now on. It feels a bit like home.”</p><p>An unfamiliar emotion welled up in Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>He sat quietly in the cave for a while, easing the fatigue from his long journey, before carefully planning his future cultivation path.</p><p>“These things can't be rushed. I need to focus on refining the sword soul first. It needs time to develop into a demonic seed. Once that's done, I can search for a suitable corpse. There are many islands around Tianxing Island; I'm sure I can find one…”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately began to ponder the *Seed of the Yuan Demon*.</p>
