Chapter 1856: Astonishment


Blood Defilement Divine Light!

Ever since his natal spirit sword fused with the Jiao wood true spirit, the divine light had been dormant for many years. Today, it finally reappeared in the world.

The Jade Kettle was a spirit treasure, and naturally it couldn't be directly crippled after being tainted by the Blood Defilement Divine Light like before.

However, a spirit treasure tainted by the Blood Defilement Divine Light would have its spirit obscured, its spirit embryo seemingly covered by a film, and its power would be damaged.

As long as the owner refined it, the defilement could be cleansed, and its spirit fully restored. Alternatively, with some effort, its power could be temporarily suppressed.

But how could there be time for refinement on the battlefield!

The blood light suddenly appeared, and the Jade Kettle's own precious light was unable to offer any resistance. The blood light easily penetrated the precious light and sprinkled onto the kettle's body.

Half of the Jade Kettle's body was dyed blood-red, as if it contained half a kettle of blood plasma, or as if a pool of blood had stained its exterior, adding a touch of eerie charm.

The Jade Kettle trembled violently, emitting a bright light, but it was powerless to stop the Blood Defilement Divine Light's invasion. The blood light flashed and invaded the kettle's body, merging with it. Immediately, the Jade Kettle's precious light dimmed dramatically.

Around the Jade Kettle, white smoke gathered into a white ribbon, one end connected to the kettle's mouth, swirling around the Jade Kettle like a streamer.  It was through this white ribbon that it had entangled with the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

No matter how sharp the spirit sword, no matter how many times the white ribbon was cut, it would instantly recover and wrap around the sword again and again.

If Qin Sang's swordsmanship were slightly inferior, or the Cloud Wanderer Sword's rank were lower, it might have been bound by the white ribbon instead.

The moment the Jade Kettle was defiled, the dancing white ribbon lost its previous agility. Although it didn't completely dissipate, the smoke clearly became scattered.

This was the moment!

The Cloud Wanderer Sword let out a clear ringing, its light intensified, and its sword energy suddenly surged a hundred zhang.

‘Puff! Puff! Puff!’

With a single strike, the white ribbon was severed into several pieces, and the smoke drifted away.

With the shift in momentum, the Jade Kettle was too late to stop the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

The sword light wasn't aimed at the Jade Kettle itself, but at Dingxianghou's true body within the dream realm. It grazed the Jade Kettle, its sword energy like a rainbow.

In an instant, like a sword flying from beyond the heavens, the sword's啸 roared like thunder, and the dream realm was torn asunder!

The sword split the heavens, revealing a golden sun suspended in the sky.

The sword light and the golden light were equally matched in their imposing aura.

The Cloud Wanderer Sword and the Sun Wheel Seal erupted almost simultaneously, Dingxianghou's dream realm suffering two terrifying impacts at the same time.

The power of the Dream Dao was already struggling to resist the golden sun, and under the assault of the golden light, it was in disarray. With the arrival of this heaven-splitting sword, a greater collapse began.

Wherever the sword light passed, the scenes within the dream realm vanished, encountering almost no resistance.  A striking scar was left in the sky as the sword, with its awe-inspiring momentum, slashed towards Dingxianghou!

The Sun Wheel Seal shattered the dream realm.

The sword slashed at the enemy's true body.

The coordination between the spirit sword and the divine ability was seamless!

Qin Sang firmly held down the frantically struggling Tapir demon, the golden sun above his head, divine light radiating from his eyes.

At this moment, Dingxianghou's hiding place had transformed into a mountain again, but to counter the golden sun, it was a volcano filled with magma.

Red light shone from within the crater, magma churning and emitting scorching heat. Dingxianghou slept within the mountain's belly, surrounded by magma, yet unharmed.

‘Boom!’

The sword light descended from the sky, swift as a meteor.

Before the sword arrived, the magma within the mountain was already affected by an invisible force, surging to both sides, forming a sword scar in the middle.

The sleeping Dingxianghou's body twisted uneasily. He never expected that his renowned spirit treasure would be broken by his opponent's spirit sword, and at such a critical moment.

Startled, Dingxianghou cast some unknown spell, and wisps of black smoke rose from his body.

The black smoke quickly drifted into the magma, and a 'crackling' sound was heard. The red light faded, and the magma solidified into black rock.

In an instant, the entire mountain transformed into a black mountain, as if forged from black iron, appearing solid and impenetrable.

Almost the moment the magma solidified, the sword light arrived!

‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’

The sword light plunged straight into the mountaintop.

The peak was instantly split down the middle.

As the sword light continued to slash downwards, a sword scar extended from the peak towards the mountain's belly, the mountain shaking violently.

The black mountain was indeed harder than iron, but before it reached the belly of the mountain, the sword's momentum weakened significantly. Judging by its remaining power, even if it could split the mountain open, its speed would slow down.

With just a moment's delay, Dingxianghou could find a way to escape the sword's edge.

But before Dingxianghou could breathe a sigh of relief, the Cloud Wanderer Sword trembled slightly, and a heart-shaking sword cry suddenly echoed from within the mountain.

At the same time, an unprecedentedly terrifying sword intent erupted from the bottom of the sword scar, along with an even sharper and more dazzling sword light than before!

‘Tearing!’

A strange ripping sound emanated from the sword scar, the sound of the mountain being split apart.

The Seven Souls Killing Formation, and Qin Sang no longer concealed his strength, directly controlling the Cloud Wanderer Sword instead of a sword image.

The Cloud Wanderer Sword had been dormant for many years.  Using other spirit swords to execute the sword formation inevitably resulted in reduced power.

This was the first time, in the truest sense, that the Cloud Wanderer Sword displayed its full power against an enemy since its transformation!

The black mountain, which could withstand sword images, was as fragile as silk before the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

The sword scar expanded rapidly, instantly penetrating into the mountain's belly!

Within the mountain's belly, Dingxianghou abruptly stood up, his eyes still closed, but a look of terror on his face.

‘Boom!’

The roof of the cave was torn apart, sword light filling the chamber. The spirit sword hovered overhead, its terrifying sword intent and killing intent assaulting Dingxianghou's mind. He already felt the breath of death within his dream.

“Wah!”

Terrified, Dingxianghou didn't hesitate to bite his tongue, spraying out a mouthful of lifeblood.

The lifeblood twisted and deformed, taking the shape of a Tapir demon.

At the same time, outside, the dream realm rumbled with loud noises as the dream itself began to rapidly collapse, no longer able to withstand the Sun Wheel Seal.

The dream realm was shattered by the golden tide of light, collapsing into countless fragments. These fragments continued to split, light as countless specks of dust, swept away by the golden light, the entire dream realm unrecognizable.

Qin Sang felt the struggles beneath him disappear. The Tapir demon's expression first became blank, then turned into a wisp of white smoke and dissipated.

Also vanishing was the dream Jade Kettle entangled with the four pythons.

Only the black mountain remained, but the sword scar in its center was extremely prominent, almost splitting it in two.

‘Boom!’

The sword light pierced through the bottom of the mountain, the sword scar completely贯穿ing the black mountain.

The split mountain halves tumbled to the sides, revealing the scene within.  There was a cave large enough to accommodate Dingxianghou's demonic body.

The cave was filled with sword light, and a dense mass of blood light exploded outwards.

Beside the blood light, there seemed to be a crystalline bubble.

Judging by the scene, it appeared as though Dingxianghou, unable to withstand the spirit sword, had been slain by a single strike, reduced to a mist of blood, without a trace of bone remaining.

Qin Sang knew the terrifying power of the Seven Souls Killing Formation executed by the Cloud Wanderer Sword.

However, seeing this scene, Qin Sang's face showed no joy. He abruptly turned his head, scanning the edge of the dream realm.

There, a faint white shadow silently materialized, solidifying into a Tapir demon, Dingxianghou's true form.

Dingxianghou's eyes opened, awakening from the dream, his eyes still filled with lingering terror.

If not for his unique divine ability, he would have perished under the sword!

This was the unique aspect of his Dream Dao divine ability. He could forcibly awaken when sensing danger, instantly shifting to any location within the reach of his dream, but at the cost of his lifeblood and vital essence.

This dream escape technique was difficult to counter. No matter what method was used to trap him, whether it be formations or Dao arts, even if his true body was firmly bound, it couldn't prevent his shifting within the dream.

Of course, if one knew about his divine ability beforehand, countermeasures could be found.  However, Qin Sang didn't understand Dingxianghou and was still evaded, the might of the spirit sword mostly striking empty space.

Dingxianghou, recalling the power of that sword strike, was still shaken. Blood seeped from his back, staining his white fur and causing stinging pain.

He was still injured. The Cloud Wanderer Sword left a long gash on his back, the sword intent penetrating deep into his flesh.

The pain wasn't only from the wound, but also from his internal organs, a feeling as if his entire body had been cleaved.

Though the external injury didn't seem serious, Dingxianghou knew his internal organs had been damaged.  Coupled with the loss of vital essence from using his divine ability, he was doubly injured.

Moreover, he had lost the spirit tree!

The bubble, enveloped in sword light, floated motionless where the cave had been.

Dingxianghou's escape technique could carry familiar objects, things that had been with him for many years and were connected to his aura, or items of low rank and unremarkable power.

The bubble was clearly not among them.  He hadn't even deciphered the blue restrictions on its surface.

In his haste to escape, Dingxianghou had no time to care for external objects.

At this point, Dingxianghou knew that in his current state, he couldn't retrieve the spirit tree from Qin Sang, and he didn't know how to explain this to the Demon King.

He hesitated whether to continue the fight, but he didn't realize that he had lost his fighting spirit. He secretly thought that if the fight continued, he would likely be in grave danger.

Just as this thought flashed through his mind, Dingxianghou suddenly felt something was wrong. A premonition of danger surged within him, and his expression changed drastically.

The sword intent hadn't dissipated just because he had escaped. It followed him like a shadow, the threat of death inescapable!

"What kind of swordsmanship is this?!"

Dingxianghou was horrified, his body turning cold, his blood nearly freezing. Without time to think, he hurriedly activated a token within his spiritual platform.

Black water gurgled from his brow, and a blood-red token emerged from the water. The blood token exploded, transforming into a wave of blood light that swept across the area.

The blood light washed over his body, colliding fiercely with the killing sword intent.

The sword cry rang beside Dingxianghou's ears, his heart skipping a beat. Then, he was overjoyed, finally gaining a moment to breathe. He merged into the blood light, burning his lifeblood, and used a blood escape technique.

This blood token was a unique treasure. Later, he received it as a reward from Demon King Lingyou, who personally refined it, infusing it with the Demon King's lifeblood. It was a treasure for escaping death.

Forced to use the blood token, Dingxianghou no longer dared to stay, even if he had other means. He had lost all will to fight and only wanted to escape quickly.

He not only lost the spirit tree but also didn't have time to retrieve his damaged Jade Kettle, fearing he would be entangled by Qin Sang.

A streak of blood-red light tore through layers of light waves, piercing through the sky with astonishing speed.

Lightning flashed, and Qin Sang appeared where Dingxianghou had been, frowning as he watched the retreating blood rainbow.

The blood escape was fast, but his escape speed wasn't slow either, and the enemy was already injured. The blood escape couldn't last long.

If not for the threat of the Demon King, chasing after him would give him a good chance to slay the demon.

After some thought, Qin Sang gave up the pursuit, sighing inwardly.  As expected of the Demon King's confidant, he truly possessed life-saving methods.

He believed his plan for this battle had been flawless, utilizing almost all his trump cards except the Five Elements Crown.

However, Qin Sang was very satisfied with the outcome.  The Sun Wheel Seal broke the divine ability, the spirit sword severely injured a powerful enemy, and most importantly, he had captured the spirit tree.

As for the Jade Kettle spirit treasure, it was neither essential nor useless.

Unless the kettle was inscribed with the Treasure Unlocking Incantation, he likely couldn't use it.

Looking in the direction Dingxianghou had fled, Qin Sang could only see a chaotic sea of light, but he felt a faint unease, thinking of the demon lord who had escaped earlier, fearing the Demon King's arrival.

Not daring to linger, he casually stored the dimmed Jade Kettle into his Thousand Jun Ring and flew towards the bubble.

Grasping the bubble, Qin Sang flapped his phoenix wings and flew in the opposite direction, examining the bubble as he went.

Pure wood spiritual energy emanated from the bubble, the entire bubble covered by a massive tree crown.

Although the trunk couldn't be seen, the leaves were identical to those of the Vajra Bodhi Tree, and there was a Vajra Fruit on the crown, deeply attracting Qin Sang's gaze.

The blue restrictive light on the bubble's surface was stronger than any he had encountered before. Breaking this restriction wouldn't be easy.

Fortunately, Qin Sang had the Celestial Eye Butterfly to assist him, and he had gained experience from breaking restrictions before.

Qin Sang immediately activated the secret technique from the Panhu True Scripture, lending his full power to the Celestial Eye Butterfly, analyzing the restrictive patterns to break the restriction and retrieve the Vajra Fruit as quickly as possible.

While breaking the restriction, Qin Sang flew directly towards the outer edge of the secluded valley, hoping to weaken the restriction's power.

Unexpectedly, at this moment, the unease in Qin Sang's heart intensified. He abruptly turned around.

Behind him was still the monotonous sea of light, but Qin Sang felt the distant light waves seemed somewhat gloomy.

At his level of cultivation, illusions were rare. There was only one explanation: he was being targeted by Demon King Lingyou!

Before even seeing the enemy, the oppressive aura emanating from the Demon King was suffocating. Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, and without a moment's hesitation, he flew with all his might.
...
Behind.

Dingxianghou, having escaped death, didn't dare to stop his blood escape until he saw Demon King Lingyou. Only then did he relax, feeling as though he had finally escaped from a disaster.

‘Swish!’

Demon King Lingyou blocked the blood light.

The blood light stopped, revealing Dingxianghou.

Sensing Dingxianghou's weakened aura, Demon King Lingyou's eyes flashed, and he asked in a deep voice, "How many opponents were there?"

Seeing Dingxianghou's miserable state, Demon King Lingyou couldn't help but be astonished. He knew his subordinate's strength well; his Dream Dao divine ability was quite profound.

Even Lingyou himself, after severing his past self, would need some effort to deal with it.

"Only one! I am incompetent, not his match. I lost the spirit tree and the spirit treasure," Dingxianghou said with shame, his voice urgent, knowing the situation was dire. He quickly recounted his previous encounter.

Yuanhou, who had been escaping with Youbo earlier, caught up at this time. Seeing Dingxianghou, he was shocked and filled with lingering fear.

"This person is extremely powerful, Your Majesty, be careful!"

Finally, Dingxianghou couldn't help but offer a warning.

Demon King Lingyou gazed into the distance, his eyes filled with killing intent. He let out a cold snort and suddenly transformed into his fish demon form, riding the waves.

"Have Yuanhou take you to meet with the others."

Demon King Lingyou left these words. The two demon lords exchanged glances, knowing they likely couldn't even catch up, and could only obey the order. (End of Chapter)
