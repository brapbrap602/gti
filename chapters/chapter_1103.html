<h1>Chapter 1995: The Vermilion Bird's True Feather</h1><p>Chapter 1995: The Vermilion Bird's True Feather</p><p>"I'm fine, Ya Gu is stable."</p><p>Bai Chuan Yin replied.</p><p>Qin Sang walked outward, saying, "Ziwei Palace and Seven Killing Hall have vastly different atmospheres. I'll go to Tianshan Mountain to take a look later.  Friend, try to see if it sparks any memories..."</p><p>Passing through the Sword Path Hall again, Qin Sang had a new realization!</p><p>Qin Sang was pleasantly surprised, then silently mocked himself.  His cultivation was low back then, his perspective too narrow; he had underestimated this Sword Path.</p><p>The hall was filled with abundant sword intent, vast and boundless, seemingly endless.</p><p>Combined with the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*, he had another profound understanding.</p><p>Third time entering Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang first battled the puppet sword formation in the trial realm alone, then obtained the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.  With his previous accumulation, he felt he was close to comprehending sword momentum and sword formations.</p><p>However, he didn't need to force himself to independently comprehend sword formations at this moment.</p><p>The cultivation technique he obtained in the Netherworld Valley was the subsequent five layers of the *Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Nascent Soul*, allowing cultivation from mid-Golden Core to late Nascent Soul!</p><p>And after Nascent Soul formation, the technique contained a sword formation called the Seven Souls Killing Array!</p><p>Seeing this sword formation, Qin Sang instantly understood why the sword light that branched off from his cultivation technique after Golden Core formation contained a soul essence.</p><p>It was related to the sword formation!</p><p>As the name suggests, the Seven Souls Killing Array wasn't simply a killing formation; it had other powerful abilities.</p><p>Exiting the ancient Sword Path Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the cliff.</p><p>The surrounding forest surged, a vibrant scene.</p><p>"It's really different from Seven Killing Hall."</p><p>Bai appeared beside Qin Sang, looking around curiously.</p><p>He noticed the shadow of Tianshan Mountain. "That's Tianshan Mountain you mentioned? It seems even grander than Yi Tian Peak.  Isn't some Demon Lord suppressed beneath it as well?"</p><p>Mentioning Demon Lords and their power, Qin Sang still felt lingering fear.</p><p>"If there really is a Demon Lord, there's nothing here to stop it from breaking free. Before I left, the most powerful cultivator, the Red-haired Ancestor, hadn't broken through to late Nascent Soul; at most, he was comparable to the three major merchant alliance leaders…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards Tianshan Mountain, finding no unusual activity.</p><p>He didn't know if the one summoned by the Abyss of Sin was really a Demon Lord.</p><p>Qin Sang decided the possibility was low. Even if it was an ancient demon, its strength would be limited; otherwise, the Abyss of Sin wouldn't need such scheming against Xiaohan Domain and Tianxing Alliance; it could simply conquer them.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang looked at the fluctuating clouds in the sky, and said, "We still have some time, let's go directly to Tianshan Mountain."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The two immediately set off, swiftly heading towards Tianshan Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was to see if the small lake stone formation where Dongyang Bo had led them into Tianshan Mountain was still there.</p><p>The sword spirit is also part of the killing sword.</p><p>Since the sword spirit is in the Tianshan Black Tower, could there be another cultivation technique hidden there?</p><p>Even Lian Chenyan's master was trapped in the tower. He currently lacked the ability to enter, but he could prepare in advance and investigate later when his cultivation improved.</p><p>This place was sparsely populated.</p><p>Qin Sang flew for a long time without seeing another person.</p><p>Until they reached near Tianshan Mountain, the two exchanged glances, immediately entering the forest to conceal themselves.</p><p>Strange lights flickered and fluctuated on top of Tianshan Mountain; needless to say, Nascent Soul masters were fighting there.</p><p>They agreed on a meeting point.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly flew towards the small mountain lake, while Bai went elsewhere.</p><p>The small lake was located halfway up Tianshan Mountain.</p><p>Remembering the path Dongyang Bo had taken when he brought him up, Qin Sang found the lake smoothly.</p><p>He hid in the distance, using his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability to observe for a while. Seeing nothing unusual in the lake, he quietly approached, only to find that there was no stone formation at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>"Sure enough, the entrance isn't here!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, looking at the top of Tianshan Mountain.</p><p>If he successfully formed his Nascent Soul, he should have the strength to forcefully enter the ancient prohibition.  But to uncover the secrets of the Black Tower and the bronze hall, he would probably have to interact with Shaohua Mountain and Dongyang Bo.</p><p>"Dongyang Bo, Chenyan, I wonder if they turned against each other after I left…"</p><p>Qin Sang left Tianshan Mountain, and Bai was already waiting for him at the meeting point.</p><p>Bai stood on the ground, gazing at the top of Tianshan Mountain, somewhat lost in thought.</p><p>Only when Qin Sang approached did he seem to snap out of it, briefly chatting with Qin Sang before returning to the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>"Sword Scar Mountain!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked in another direction, his expression solemn.</p><p>"If this old Daoist fails, little brother, when you next enter Ziwei Palace, burn a stick of incense for this old Daoist; that will suffice!"</p><p>This was the last farewell Yun Youzi said before he left.</p><p>To this day, Qin Sang hadn't forgotten a single word!</p><p>To seek Nascent Soul formation, Yun Youzi willingly threw himself into the Southern Ming Li Fire, using the demonic fire to refine his soul, reborn from the flames.</p><p>Although Qin Sang helped him obtain the green copper block to counteract the Southern Ming Li Fire, Yun Youzi's act was tantamount to a moth to a flame, a gamble with death.</p><p>Qin Sang's journey was one of fulfilling a promise.</p><p>If Yun Youzi succeeded, they would meet again, supporting each other on their immortal path.</p><p>If Yun Youzi perished in the Nan Ming Li Fire...</p><p>Qin Sang would still offer incense, to bid farewell to his old friend!</p><p>Qin Sang sped through the mountains. Even with his hardened heart, he felt uneasy.</p><p>Qing Zhu and Yun Youzi were both mentors and friends to Qin Sang.</p><p>He was closer to Yun Youzi, their bond deeper.</p><p>Having just witnessed the legendary end of Elder Qing Zhu, he did not wish to lose another dear friend!</p><p>Arriving at the foot of Jian Hen Mountain,</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and, following Yun Youzi's instructions, passed through the ancient formation.</p><p>This time, it was far easier.  Soon, Qin Sang reached the stone hall.</p><p>Looking around,</p><p>the stone hall was normal, with no signs of other cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang found the stone brick, pressed it, a wave of energy rippled, the passage opened, and a wave of intense heat washed over him.</p><p>The Nan Ming Li Fire remained!</p><p>He hurried deeper into the passage, finally seeing a deep red flame.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly approached, quickly scanning the Nan Ming Li Fire.  His anxiety vanished, replaced by surprise.</p><p>The green copper piece wasn't there!</p><p>This meant Yun Youzi hadn't perished here, likely succeeding in his quest.</p><p>At that moment, the Corpse Puppet Bag emitted a soft exclamation from Bai, "It's the Nan Ming Li Fire!"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked, "Friend, do you recognize this fire?"</p><p>Bai appeared, nodded, and pointed to the mythical bird's shadow at the fire's heart, exclaiming, "This is the Zhu Que's true fire! If I'm not mistaken, this Nan Ming Li Fire, still burning, is likely a Zhu Que true feather! Its power is certainly not inferior to the long feather in the Nine-Phoenix King's possession; a complete feather would be even stronger!"</p><p>"A Zhu Que true feather!"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King's feather left an indelible impression; a Zhu Que feather was even stronger!</p><p>Bai glanced at Qin Sang, chuckled, and said, "Subduing a Zhu Que true feather won't be easy. Without Zhu Que bloodline, you can't gain its recognition. Even Zhu Que descendants, with their diluted bloodlines in this era, couldn't do it."</p><p>(Thanks to the generous donation from Shi Tian Xia!</p><p>Too many holiday gatherings, hard to settle down.
