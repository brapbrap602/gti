<h1>Chapter 883: The Yin-Yang Disc</h1><p>Chapter 883: The Yin-Yang Disc</p><p>Mr. Chen and Fang Ting vanished outside the hall.</p><p>The remaining individuals inside displayed varied expressions.</p><p>The man in green robes and the other three shared Mr. Chen's displeasure with Master Huayang's overbearing actions. However, witnessing the Pavilion Master's compromise and Mr. Chen's subsequent punishment, none dared to speak out.</p><p>The new disciples, lacking deep ties to the Smoke and Mist Pavilion, were filled with anticipation upon hearing Master Huayang would recruit disciples for the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>People naturally strive for advancement.  The necessities for cultivation—wealth, companions, methods, and land—were all far superior at the Lan Dou Sect compared to the Smoke and Mist Pavilion.</p><p>Master Huayang watched Fang Ting leave the hall, then turned to the remaining crowd, his enthusiasm waning.  His primary goal was to recruit a core disciple like Fang Ting.  Failing to secure her, the chances of finding a suitable replacement were slim.</p><p>At this moment, Pavilion Master Qi's voice resounded again, "Master Huayang, time is of the essence. Let us begin the test. I am eager to witness the power of the renowned Yin-Yang Disc of the Yin-Yang lineage."</p><p>"Prepare the array," Master Huayang instructed a young attendant, before retrieving a circular bronze disc from his pouch.</p><p>The disc was slightly larger than an adult's palm, its base and edges radiating an ancient bronze luster.  Intricate and strange runes were etched across its surface.  Within the disc, a yin-yang symbol, seemingly not fixed, slowly rotated, inducing dizziness and a sensation as if one's soul were being drawn in.</p><p>Master Huayang produced the Yin-Yang Disc and chuckled, responding to Pavilion Master Qi, "I am ashamed to admit, the Yin-Yang Disc is merely an auxiliary artifact, and even a flawed one at that.  Its power pales in comparison to your Pavilion's treasured Water Smoke Screen."</p><p>"Master Huayang, why the false modesty?  While our Water Smoke Screen is exceptional, how can it compare to the treasures of the Yin-Yang lineage? Even this Yin-Yang Disc is surely more than you say.  These new disciples are only at the Qi Condensation stage.  Will there be any unforeseen consequences from exposing them to the Yin-Yang Disc?" Pavilion Master Qi's voice held a note of concern.</p><p>"Rest assured, Pavilion Master!" Master Huayang responded confidently, gesturing to the busy attendant. "I will only activate a small portion of its power, and the Tranquility Formation will provide protection.  They will not be lost within the Yin-Yang Disc.  Not only will it not harm them, but those with sufficient aptitude may even enhance their mental fortitude."</p><p>Pavilion Master Qi chuckled, "Then I thank you in advance, Master Huayang."</p><p>While the two conversed, the attendant worked diligently in the center of the hall. Beams of light emanated from his hands, touching the ground.  Quickly, an exceptionally complex spirit array took shape, emitting a faint, milky white aura that spread outward.</p><p>A murmur of admiration filled the hall.  Enveloped by the aura, the new disciples unknowingly surrendered to its influence, their faces relaxed, their minds experiencing an unprecedented serenity.</p><p>"Begin!" Master Huayang smiled subtly, launching the Yin-Yang Disc into the air above the array, directly over its center.  He then shouted, awakening the entranced individuals, "Enter the spirit array and meditate…"</p><p>The crowd rushed into the array.  The incarnation also swiftly moved into the formation and found a place to sit.</p><p>"Calm your minds, eliminate all distractions!  No matter what you see later, do not fear. The Tranquility Formation will protect you from harm. Remember, you only have one stick of incense. You must strive to grasp what you see…"</p><p>Master Huayang's words resonated, the final part particularly cryptic.</p><p>Master Huayang's expression darkened, and he pointed towards the Yin-Yang Disc. With a hum, the yin-yang symbol at the disc's center spun rapidly.  The yin and yang energies accelerated, transforming into black and white beams of light that shot into the array.  However, upon nearing the disciples, they softened and became gentle.</p><p>Instantly, the black and white energies merged into a gray mist, enveloping the new disciples, rendering them partially visible.</p><p>Silence once more descended upon the hall. Master Huayang simultaneously controlled the spirit array and the Yin-Yang Disc, observing the disciples and awaiting the results.</p><p>The incarnation felt as if he had fallen into a sea of white mist. He remained vigilant, his greatest concern being the Sky-Eyed Butterfly. It too was enveloped by the Yin-Yang Disc's power, and its forced emergence would be perilous.</p><p>Fortunately, Master Huayang was worried about harming these new disciples, so he only used a small fraction of the artifact's power. It wasn't enough to affect the Sky Eye Butterfly...</p><p>Hua's incarnation relaxed, and began observing the surroundings.</p><p>He felt like a lost soul, drifting in the void. Below was emptiness; no solid ground was visible, and all around him was shrouded in a faint white mist.</p><p>"Grab what you see..."</p><p>Remembering Master Huayang's words, Hua's incarnation moved, reaching out to grasp a wisp of the white mist.</p><p>When he opened his hand, the mist vanished.  This showed that the surroundings weren't real, but illusions.</p><p>Everywhere he looked, everything was illusory.</p><p>It was truly a situation with no escape, neither up nor down.</p><p>However, Hua's incarnation showed no anxiety.  He slowly scanned his surroundings, taking everything in. Gradually, he seemed to understand.</p><p>A Qi Refinement cultivator would be helpless in this situation, simply waiting for Master Huayang to remove the Yin-Yang Disk.</p><p>But although Hua's incarnation was only at the ninth level of Qi Refinement, he possessed the insight of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Master Huayang's cultivation was comparable only to his original body.</p><p>With only a small fraction of the artifact's power used, and it being an illusion, it was impossible for Hua's incarnation to be trapped.</p><p>"Something? The only real thing here is the Yin-Yang Qi of the Yin-Yang Disk!"</p><p>Hua's incarnation understood the nature of the test. "Low-level cultivators lack the ability to see through the illusion.  Aimlessly searching in such a vast space, they couldn't possibly find the Yin-Yang Qi. Only those innately sensitive to Yin-Yang Qi, with their senses obscured, could locate it through an inexplicable intuition.  The Yin-Yang lineage is indeed demanding in its requirements for talent..."</p><p>Having guessed the reason, Hua's incarnation became confident. He stood motionless in the void, eyes closed, carefully sensing the flow of the white mist.</p><p>After a short time, his expression brightened.  He suddenly opened his eyes, then shot off in a specific direction.</p><p>Outside the spirit array.</p><p>The hall was silent. Time slowly passed; soon, more than half of an incense stick's worth of time had elapsed.</p><p>The disciples within the spirit array showed various expressions: some anxious, some resigned. Still, none had awakened.</p><p>Master Huayang watched the three-spirit-root boy, placing some hope on him. But seeing the boy's panicked state, he shook his head, a hint of disappointment in his eyes.</p>
