<h1>Chapter 1781:  The Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning</h1><p>Right Thunder Prefecture.</p><p>Unlike the Left Thunder Prefecture, scattered across a thousand islands, the Right Thunder Prefecture's entire sect is located on a single large island.  </p><p>It is said this island ranks among the top three largest in the Star Island Fairy Lake.</p><p>Today is the day of the initiation ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding the thunder talisman bestowed by Elder Li, arrived to receive the second-level Golden Fire Bell Dharma.</p><p>Presenting the talisman, he was immediately led inside by a Right Thunder Prefecture disciple and joined other cultivators undergoing the same initiation to the initiation hall.</p><p>The Right Thunder Prefecture's custom is to initiate disciples first.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others waited until the last disciple's initiation was complete before being allowed to enter.</p><p>Seeing the Right Thunder Prefecture's main hall, Qin Sang thought he had returned to the Left Thunder Prefecture.</p><p>The Lei Zu Temple, the sacred image of Lei Zu, even the incense burners in front of the temple were identical to those in the Left Thunder Prefecture.</p><p>The initiation rites were also very similar.</p><p>When it was Qin Sang's turn, he entered the Lei Zu Temple, knelt on a meditation cushion.  Without needing to summon the altar, after the officiating master burned incense and made offerings, the Golden Fire Bell Dharma entered Qin Sang's brow, automatically taking its place.</p><p>At the center of the altar, the Divine Thunder Seal shone faintly, and the Golden Fire Bell Dharma then submerged within it, disappearing from sight.</p><p>The three masters did not notice that Qin Sang's altar guardian god was an inner truth, not a thunder god.</p><p>In fact, even if Qin Sang had summoned the altar, there was no risk of exposure.</p><p>The altar guardian god is not a true deity, but a wisp of divine intent, perceptible only to cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, bowed, and withdrew, receiving a jade slip. He left the Right Thunder Prefecture that same day.</p><p>Only upon returning to his cave dwelling on Hu Zhong Island did Qin Sang carefully examine the changes before and after his initiation.</p><p>He first scanned the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>It was divided into three parts: altar construction points, the Myriad Gods Thunder Department Divine Guidance, and the "Morning Truth Jade Talisman Incantation."</p><p>The Myriad Gods Thunder Department Divine Guidance was different from the one he received previously; it featured fewer, higher-ranked divine images.</p><p>Golden Fire Bell Grand General, Left Leader General of the Thunder Chariot,  霹雳典籍功曹 , Fire Bell Heaven's Authority Clerk, Jade Light Golden Essence Upper Clerk, Wind Thunder Divine Clerk, Record-Keeping Judge…</p><p>One divine name after another flowed before Qin Sang's eyes, finally settling on the Golden Fire Bell Grand General.</p><p>The sacred image of this deity was the only one among them that was glowing!</p><p>"Can Thunder Department deities only visualize this one?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised but didn't dwell on it, as he wouldn't be visualizing deities.</p><p>He shifted his attention to the Dharma itself. Within the altar, the two Dharmas had merged into one.</p><p>The talisman containing the Golden Fire Bell Dharma was the Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of an ancient divine seal in the Daoist tradition called the Golden Fire Bell Divine Seal, possessing powerful abilities to summon dragons and thunder, refine souls to attain true immortality, subdue water monsters, and dispel evil spirits.</p><p>He wondered if there was a connection between the two.</p><p>It was said that the Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning could subdue all demons—an obvious exaggeration.</p><p>However, the talisman did possess the ability to intimidate demonic creatures. The effectiveness depended on the difference in cultivation and the strength of the demonic beast's bloodline.</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Golden-winged Thunder Eagle royal blood essence—more than half a bottle remained—and began constructing the altar.</p><p>The Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning's talisman form was far more complex than the Jade Pure Thunder Summoning Talisman.</p><p>Both talismans belonged to the Upper Divine Thunder Department Dharmas, their spiritual apertures could perfectly overlap. All Qin Sang had to do was continue to 'stack bricks and tiles'.</p><p>As Qin Sang gradually perfected the altar, the Jade Pure Thunder Summoning Talisman would also receive empowerment; its power would increase with Qin Sang's cultivation.</p><p>Furthermore, when the Jade Pure Thunder Summoning Talisman and the Golden Fire Bell Thunder Summoning were used simultaneously, there would be a wondrous change—the benefit of a common lineage.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The jade bottle opened, drop by drop of blood essence continuously flew out, forming the scattered form of the talisman, merging into the altar.</p><p>Although he had only recently obtained the Golden Fire Bell Dharma, Qin Sang's movements were without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>Over the past two years, in addition to cultivating his spirit, Qin Sang had been studying talisman techniques, purchasing plenty of paper, brushes, and cinnabar, personally drawing and crafting talismans.</p><p>Incidentally, talisman techniques, like weapon refinement and array restriction techniques, shared common ground.  Qin Sang, proficient in these two areas, found talisman studies not particularly difficult.</p><p>Now, with the necessary materials, Qin Sang's success rate in creating Nascent Soul-level talismans was quite high.</p><p>Qin Sang worked tirelessly, repeatedly combining apertures and forms, using up the bottle of Thunder Eagle blood essence.  His Qianjun Ring flashed, and several demonic bones flew out.</p><p>These were thunder tortoise bones—the refined essence Qin Sang had kept from dissecting the demonic corpse.</p><p>These bones contained a rich concentration of the thunder tortoise's primal essence.</p><p>As long as these bones were usable, he could use thunder tortoise demon cores to construct the altar after future initiations.</p><p>From Qin Sang's experience battling thunder tortoises, their innate divine abilities were extremely pure.</p><p>Among the treasures used to forge the altar, the blood and bones, and demon core of妖兽 made up the largest proportion.  The purer the bloodline, the higher the success rate.</p><p>Cultivators in this realm also ventured into the  孽原, hunting凶兽 to forge the altar.</p><p>The凶兽, afflicted by the six-day ancient Qi, not only became frenzied but also suffered from a madness that spread throughout their bodies, deep into their bone marrow.  It's said this doesn't affect the altar's effectiveness, but凶兽 with pure bloodlines are rare.</p><p>The妖 bone gradually melted in Qin Sang's palm, eventually transforming into a ball of lightning plasma, with faint traces of blood seemingly within.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred slightly; he drew out a thread and sketched a talismanic shape.</p><p>As this ethereal form gradually took shape, showing no signs of disintegration, it was finally completed and merged into the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up; without hesitation, he continued forging the altar.</p><p>The thunder turtle is a Nascent Soul level凶兽, its bloodline power is abundant, more than enough to support the altar's completion!</p><p>Qin Sang maintained his True Yuan at the peak of Yuan Ying stage, without using his divine sense to isolate it, nor worrying about his True Yuan reversing.</p><p>He experimented with several Taoist techniques; the flow of True Yuan, the breathing of Qi, all proceeded smoothly, causing him to nod subtly.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's divine sense touched the spirit beast pouch, summoning the Fire Jade Centipede, and also summoning the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was asleep, emitting an invisible ripple.</p><p>This slumber wasn't for a breakthrough; Qin Sang had 'sealed' it to protect its intellect!</p><p>The spirit insect's primordial spirit is the most fragile.</p><p>Following Qin Sang to this realm, the Fire Jade Centipede lacked protection, and its intellect gradually suffered.  Qin Sang noticed this and immediately ordered the Fire Jade Centipede into a deep sleep.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly, however, showed no signs of confusion.</p><p>Since its mutation after absorbing the Qingluan lightning power, the Sky Eye Butterfly has displayed increasingly high intelligence.  Along with the Fat Silkworm, they are among the most intelligent insects of their level; the Fire Jade Centipede is far behind.</p><p>Whether this is the reason, or...</p><p>Qin Sang introspected the jade Buddha, suspecting that the Sky Eye Butterfly, as his lifebound spirit insect, might also benefit in some way.</p><p>The Divine Thunder Seal glowed faintly, shooting a seal-shaped mark that merged into the Fire Jade Centipede's forehead.</p><p>The sleeping Fire Jade Centipede trembled slightly, and from that moment became Qin Sang's first insect general!</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede transformed into a red light and plunged into the altar, residing in a spiritual aperture.</p><p>The altar's guardian generals still need some time to strengthen; let it continue its slumber.</p><p>"With the altar, I won't need the spirit beast pouch anymore, which is convenient."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the empty spirit beast pouch and casually tossed it aside.</p><p>The pouch originally contained some spirit insects he had collected in the storm belt, all auxiliary insects with special abilities.  However, due to their low cultivation, they hadn't survived until now.</p><p>As for the Sky Eye Butterfly, there's no need for such trouble.  As a lifebound spirit insect, it doesn't need to enter the altar to share the altar's field with Qin Sang.</p><p>After several more months of seclusion, Qin Sang was awakened by a talismanic message.  He quickly left his cave abode, arrived at Master Qi's mansion, and met Master Qi in the fire room.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Master Qi immediately asked, "Friend Daoist, how is your control over divine abilities progressing? I intend to start the furnace in six months!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Master Qi had summoned him several times before to assist in various experiments with refining techniques, all of which had failed.</p><p>Judging by Master Qi's tone, this time it wasn't an experiment, but a genuine attempt to refine a treasure!</p><p>"How confident are you?"</p><p>Master Qi gently shook his head and sighed, "I've done all I can, my skills reach their limit. Even if I spent another few decades studying, I couldn't improve."</p><p>Qin Sang understood and said solemnly, "This cultivator will control the fire for Master."</p><p>The altar was complete; he could assist Master Qi in refining the treasure.</p><p>For the next two months, Qin Sang remained at Master Qi's mansion, preparing for the upcoming refinement.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang controlling the fire was merely an excuse.</p><p>But when Qin Sang displayed his uncanny fire control skills before Master Qi, the latter was astonished, immediately deciding to collaborate on refining the treasure.</p><p>Master Qi first refined the Returning Wind Armor, then continuously worked with Qin Sang until their coordination became seamless.</p><p>Since Master Qi was leading the process, they used his familiar fire room and spirit fire.</p><p>Master Qi patiently explained things to Qin Sang repeatedly, showing even more dedication than the owner himself.</p><p>For six months, the two remained in the fire room without leaving.</p><p>Finally, the day arrived. Master Qi ordered the servant boy to close the door and refuse visitors, and used formations to seal the mansion and fire room.</p><p>Only Qin Sang and Master Qi remained in the fire chamber. A square tripod sat on the spirit fire between them.  Beside it were neatly arranged fragments of the True Treasure, a Hui Feng armor, and various spirit materials.</p><p>Master Qi nodded to Qin Sang, drew the new Hui Feng armor close, and rubbed his finger.  A white flower bloomed from his fingertip.  The delicate flower floated to the armor, took root, and its slender tendrils rapidly grew, some even piercing the armor, weaving a network of roots inside and out in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Master Qi intently. This was to implant the flower into the armor’s energy pathways, using the roots to make the pathways visible.  During the later refinement process, every subtle change could be accurately reflected.  A similar method existed in the legacy of the Mu Xiang Hall of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’ The Hui Feng armor was placed into the tripod.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and pressed down lightly, causing the flames to surge, almost engulfing the tripod.  It seemed violent, but every flicker, every change was under Qin Sang’s precise control.</p><p>The fire blazed. The flames leaped, transforming into numerous fire talismans that floated into the tripod, shrouding the Hui Feng armor in layers of talismans.  The green color of the armor gradually faded, as if it were red-hot iron; even the patterns on the armor became lighter, but the flower and its roots remained.</p><p>Master Qi didn’t idle. He drew one spirit material after another, constantly changing hand seals, and infusing talismans into them.  Each completed item was then added to the tripod for Qin Sang to refine.  Finally came the fragments of the True Treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang focused, completing his task.  Only the Hui Feng armor and several differently colored orbs of light remained within the tripod. He looked across at Master Qi.</p><p>Master Qi was still busy; the True Treasure fragments hovered before him, rolling over and over.  Qin Sang watched with increasing surprise.  Master Qi seemed to treat the fragments like a talisman paper, occasionally drawing on the light orbs within the tripod as ink to imprint talismans onto the fragments.  Initially, they only remained on the surface, but gradually, they showed signs of merging, like ripples in water.</p><p>The exquisite technique of integrating talismanry into the art of refining weapons gave Qin Sang a novel experience, captivating him completely.</p><p>A loud shout startled Qin Sang. Master Qi’s eyes widened, and he thrust his hands forward. The True Treasure fragments stirred, like a waterfall cascading into the tripod.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly refocused, controlling the fire with all his might.  Master Qi made hand seals with one hand and pressed down on the tripod with the other.  The tripod itself was also a treasure; streaks of talismanic prohibitions continuously appeared from within, drawing the True Treasure fragments and the Hui Feng armor towards each other.</p><p>It was unclear whether the fragments were merging into the armor, or vice versa. In the dazzling light, the two merged into one. The True Treasure fragments disappeared, and a shimmering, water-like quality seemed to pervade the Hui Feng armor.</p><p>This was only the first step; the most rigorous test had just begun.</p><p>In the fire chamber, the two sat on either side of the tripod, motionless. The flickering flames and the inner light of the tripod intertwined.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed. The tripod trembled, and a ringing sound echoed in the chamber.  Both men seemed awakened by the sound; they opened their eyes, exchanged a glance, and poured their true energy into their palms.</p><p>Strange light erupted from the tripod, but was contained by the fire chamber's restrictions.  The Hui Feng armor could be seen slowly rotating within, appearing now illusory, now solid.</p><p>Qin Sang knew they had reached the most crucial and difficult step: connecting the energy pathways, channeling energy into the armor.</p><p>Both men concentrated, but as time passed, the armor began to tremble, with increasing intensity. Master Qi's face changed; he changed his hand seals repeatedly, producing several spirit talismans, which he unhesitatingly sent into the tripod. Qin Sang cooperated fully.</p><p>But their efforts were in vain.  Despite their best efforts, they could not stabilize the situation. The armor's light dimmed, and the sound of rushing water echoed within the tripod, filled with unease.</p><p>Master Qi's eyes were bloodshot, and he let out a low growl, but nothing worked.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "It's impossible, Master. Don't force it."</p><p>Master Qi seemed to awaken from a dream. He stared at the tripod, his eyes clouded with disappointment.  But then, as if suddenly understanding something, his eyes lit up.  He abruptly retrieved the Hui Feng armor from the tripod, and with a series of flicks of his fingers, sent streams of light into the armor.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang seemed to understand as well, his face brightening; he tried to cooperate with Master Qi.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang was the first to withdraw his hand. Master Qi appeared above the armor, making a hand seal and pressing it onto the breastplate.</p><p>‘Boom!’ Dazzling light filled the cave, silencing all sounds.</p><p>When the light subsided, Qin Sang saw Master Qi fondly playing with a palm-sized set of armor.</p><p>Feeling Qin Sang's gaze, Master Qi reluctantly tossed it over. "Unfortunately, my cultivation is insufficient; it's somewhat inferior to my expectations."  Despite this, his tone was filled with self-satisfaction and excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang caught the armor and immediately sensed the changes. With a thought, the breastplate transformed into a pool of clear water – the True Treasure fragment manifested.</p><p>They had originally intended to fuse the two treasures, but had only managed to embed the True Treasure fragment into the Hui Feng armor.  The good news was that they could now draw upon the power of the True Treasure fragment through the armor, though only in a small area.</p><p>The fragment could move freely on the armor. Wherever it was, the armor's defense would be far superior. It tested the user's ability to seize opportunities.</p><p>"A magnificent treasure!" Qin Sang nodded repeatedly.</p>
