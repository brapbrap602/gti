<h1>Chapter 1530: Jade Smoke Flow (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1530: Jade Smoke Flow (4k)</p><p>*啪!*</p><p>A sound echoed, and the sword talisman shattered, its physical form breaking apart.</p><p>The talismanic light, however, remained condensed.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, a green talisman could be seen within the green light, seemingly imprinted on the void, shaped like a green eye, watching Qin Sang.</p><p>"Eight Scenic Views?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind rapidly recalled the contents of Xiao Xiangzi's jade slip.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi's writings were unrestrained, not a deliberate record of Central State's forces, only mentioning them incidentally when connected to anecdotes.</p><p>The jade slip made no mention of the Eight Scenic Views.</p><p>The green talisman locked onto Qin Sang, its threat undisguised.</p><p>By this posture, if Qin Sang dared to cross the line, he would surely suffer misfortune.</p><p>"Clearing the area…"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled inwardly, yet profound doubt lingered.</p><p>Since the other party had found him, they must have sensed the beast's strength.  Seeing the beast and still daring to appear nearby, issuing a warning with a sword talisman, their cultivation must be formidable.</p><p>The Eight Scenic Views were probably quite famous in Central State.</p><p>Could it be that the other party was intentionally luring the beast away to save someone?</p><p>If saving someone, why issue a sword talisman warning?</p><p>Was it because he had inadvertently led the beast to crash into the other party's cave, forcing them to act with a hostile attitude, or…</p><p>"It couldn't be…"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly thought of a possibility, instantly finding it rather unbelievable.</p><p>At this moment, the beast's roar suddenly turned more shrill.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang saw a bloody light shoot up into the sky from the heart of the storm.</p><p>Having failed to kill its first prey, the beast was clearly impatient, pursuing the long-bearded Daoist. Seeing the man fleeing rapidly, its fierce eyes glared, the intense bloody light almost connecting between its four eyes, like a gaping maw.</p><p>*噗!*</p><p>A bloody pillar of light pierced the void.</p><p>This was the scene Qin Sang had just witnessed.</p><p>Only this time, the target was the long-bearded Daoist, and Qin Sang became a mere spectator.</p><p>To avoid the beast, Qin Sang had continuously fled, and resisting the beast's attacks had heavily depleted his true essence, yet he didn't want to leave just like that.</p><p>He glanced at the green talisman, hesitated slightly, refrained from rash action, stopped in place, and ordered the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to fully activate its Heaven's Eye ability, gazing at the battlefield from afar.</p><p>At this time, the long-bearded Daoist's figure had disappeared, replaced by a white-feathered crane.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the crane was the long-bearded Daoist's transformed form.</p><p>The crane spread its wings, flapping them gently. In an instant, it appeared at the edge of the void, and with several flickers, it vanished into the depths of the storm, a highly sophisticated evasion technique.</p><p>Though not as fast as Qin Sang's Thunder Escape, it was not far off.</p><p>However, even Qin Sang had not been able to avoid the beast's attack, and the crane was naturally no exception.</p><p>The bloody light approached.</p><p>The crane's figure abruptly stopped, its wings suddenly retracted, its white feathers turning almost transparent.  Then, a white smoke rose from the ground, transforming back into the long-bearded Daoist's true form.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist, seeing the beast's attack from afar, understood that the power of the bloody light wasn't as simple and crude as it appeared; there were strange changes within. The previous person had almost been hit.</p><p>He couldn't be careless; a preemptive strike was the right course of action!</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist coldly snorted, flicked his sleeve, and sent out a puff of light smoke.</p><p>The light smoke seemed light and airy, about to dissipate with a single flick.  A closer look revealed that it wasn't actually smoke, but a fine net.</p><p>How much power could a net as light as smoke possibly have?</p><p>In fact, this was the long-bearded Daoist's famous treasure, with a rather elegant name: Jade Smoke Flow!</p><p>Still as jade smoke, moving like a torrent.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist grasped and released his palm, the Jade Smoke Flow contracting inward, still to moving, shooting out.</p><p>In this moment, the previous lightness vanished completely. Wherever it passed, it left a white trail in the void, truly like a rushing river, with immense momentum.</p><p>Before the long-bearded Daoist could be swallowed by the bloody light, Jade Smoke Flow intercepted it, a large net suddenly expanding, its threads transparent as jade, thin as hair.</p><p>Myriad illusions shimmered, vast as the ocean.</p><p>A violent roar erupted.</p><p>The bloody light didn't pause, completely entering the Jade Smoke Flow's illusions.</p><p>Space twisted, the bloody light like a penetrating sword, exploding in the center of the illusions, fierce and imposing, its astonishing impact force causing the illusions to constantly undulate.</p><p>The Jade Smoke Flow strained, emitting a ringing sound like the clash of swords.</p><p>The giant net connected heaven and earth, firmly trapping the bloody light, effectively curbing its momentum.</p><p>However, the long-bearded Daoist's expression held no sign of relief, for the beast's true killing move hadn't yet arrived.</p><p>Just as he had expected.</p><p>A crimson vortex appeared before the giant net. The hidden killing move finally emerged, but this time, the vortex barely formed before transforming into a scarlet spike.  It pierced the Yao Guang, aiming straight for Yu Liu Feiyan.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist's face changed drastically. He formed a hand seal and sent a spell flying towards Yu Liu Feiyan.</p><p>"This treasure is both supple and rigid!"</p><p>The Yao Guang shattered into fragments.</p><p>The giant net flickered and vanished.</p><p>Instantly, clouds filled the sky, sealing the void, thick and heavy, a stark contrast to its previous form.</p><p>*Puff!*</p><p>The spike pierced the clouds.</p><p>A thunderous muffled sound echoed. Half of the clouds were instantly stained crimson, showing signs of dispersal.</p><p>With a booming roar, a streak of light burst from the clouds—Yu Liu Feiyan, curled into a ball.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist, pale and reeling as if struck hard, flew backward, his feathered hat askew, almost swept away by the hurricane. He forcibly stabilized himself, took a breath, grabbed Yu Liu Feiyan, and fled without looking back.</p><p>Though appearing disheveled, he and his treasure were unharmed, having deflected the beast's ranged attack.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang watched intently, observing the strange phenomena.</p><p>"The aura of those clouds…a pseudo-spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the person fighting the beast was a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>No wonder they dared to issue a warning with a sword talisman; they truly had the power to back up their words.</p><p>Encountering a Grand Cultivator before even entering the Central Plains, one who had refined their natal treasure to the level of a pseudo-spiritual treasure…</p><p>Qin Sang realized that the *Sacrifice Yuan Technique* or similar secret arts might not be a secret in the Central Plains.</p><p>After obtaining the *Sacrifice Yuan Technique*, Qin Sang had repeatedly tried to use it to refine the Yunyou Sword, accelerating the process of nurturing its spirit, but he always failed.</p><p>His spiritual sense met the technique's requirements; the gap lay in his cultivation.</p><p>After all, he had only recently entered the mid-stage of Yuan Ying. He received some pills from Xuan Tian Palace, which improved his cultivation after refining, but he hadn't had time for secluded cultivation.</p><p>Having found the Buddha Bone Relic, Qin Sang decided to find a place to settle in the Central Plains, entering seclusion until he broke through to the late stage.</p><p>As for a cave abode, Qin Sang had no clear target yet. He planned to explore the Central Plains and then try to find one using the secret knowledge mentioned by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>As his thoughts drifted…</p><p>The beast roared wildly, pursuing the long-bearded Daoist into the distance.</p><p>That Eight Views cultivator was certainly no match for the beast.</p><p>However, the direction he fled was not towards the cultivation world; he didn't seem to be in a hurry to escape.</p><p>Something's amiss!</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, glanced at the green talisman, and chose not to act rashly.  He wasn't willing to leave either, so he followed the beast's roars from a distance.</p><p>He dared not get too close, only observing from afar.</p><p>Considering the Eight Views cultivator's actions…</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the cultivator was luring the beast away—to hunt it!</p><p>Hunting a Nascent Soul stage beast—an astonishing feat.</p><p>Upon arriving in the Central Plains, the cultivators here had already given Qin Sang a lesson. Xiao Xiangzi's praise of the Central Plains was indeed true.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't get close to the beast, only judging its Nascent Soul stage strength from its attacks.</p><p>But what if it was a mid- or late-stage Nascent Soul?</p><p>Since they dared to hunt the beast, they must be fully prepared. It wouldn't be a lone hunter.</p><p>Qin Sang even suspected that Nascent Soul cultivators might be waiting ahead!</p><p>The thought of witnessing a Nascent Soul battle, even for the cautious Qin Sang, was hard to resist. After weighing his options, he decided to stay and observe.</p><p>He understood the taboos of the cultivation world. He wouldn't provoke either side, wouldn't approach the battlefield; simply sensing the might of a Nascent Soul battle from afar would suffice.  He would leave before the outcome was decided.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang slowed his pace.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>Before Qin Sang waited too long, a beast's scream erupted from the heart of the storm, its voice distorted by rage, not quite like thunder, but followed by true thunder, earth-shattering!</p><p>Even from such a distance, Qin Sang felt his spirit tremble, adding caution to his heart.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw the storm's heart, the sky stained crimson, and sensed the fluctuations of the battle from afar. He stopped.</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>At the Eight Views cultivator's ambush site, a fierce battle raged.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist lured the beast, and the purple-robed elder immediately activated the Jade Thunder Sound Array.</p><p>The cultivators powered the array.</p><p>Golden swords stood like pillars, supporting the eight directions.</p><p>Purple thunder rained down, devastating everything.</p><p>Unexpectedly, despite its frenzy, the beast's instinctive perception of danger was extremely sharp.  At the last moment, it reacted swiftly and was not trapped by the array.</p><p>The beast showed no sign of retreat and launched a ferocious attack.</p><p>The air throbbed with an intense crimson light.  Purple and blood red were the only colors visible.  Despite the relentless bombardment of purple lightning, the bloody aura not only refused to dissipate, but surged back, threatening to engulf the very lightning itself.  The surrounding golden swords violently trembled, the array faltering, filling the cultivators with terror.</p><p>“No good!  Form the Vajra Subduing Demon Array!”</p><p>The purple-robed elder’s face turned ashen. He hurled a golden orb with his left hand.  A flash of gold, and the orb hung above the beast, spinning rapidly.  Simultaneously, in eight directions around the orb, space distorted, and eight identical golden orbs materialized, solid and tangible.  The orbs connected energetically, and the cultivators raised their hands, focusing their energy on the orbs, assisting the elder.</p><p>The array resembled a mighty Vajra incarnate.  Buddhist chants, sacred sounds of subduing demons, filled the air. The golden orbs vibrated incessantly, emitting bursts of light, shooting out golden rings that crackled with thunderous power, striking the beast repeatedly.  Each ring left a golden aura on the beast’s body.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang observed from a distance, relying on his perception of the strange phenomena.</p><p>“No Nascent Soul stage cultivator?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed, disappointment evident.  The Eight Views Sect most likely used a spirit array, powerful, but without a Nascent Soul cultivator present, it was unlikely to kill the beast.  Moreover, this was the storm zone, where the celestial mechanisms were chaotic, inherently disadvantageous to cultivators.  Qin Sang grew increasingly concerned for the Eight Views Sect.</p><p>After waiting a while longer, seeing no Nascent Soul cultivator intervene, Qin Sang hesitated, then slowly retreated, unwilling to risk another encounter with the beast.</p><p>By this time, a layer of golden light enveloped the beast, forming vast golden auras rippling like water.  Judging the moment right, the purple-robed elder shouted, “Gather!”</p><p>The previously ethereal auras solidified abruptly, forming a massive golden ring that tightly constricted the beast, rapidly tightening its grip.  Simultaneously, the Jade Lightning Sound Array was pushed to its limit, purple lightning descending from the heavens, aimed at the beast's four eyes—they had discovered the eyes to be a potential weak point during the battle.</p><p>The beast screamed, trying to evade, but the golden ring held it fast.  Enraged, its slick, bloody skin undulated strangely, then suddenly shriveled, revealing a skeletal frame beneath. A long, sword-like bone spur emerged from its spine, detaching from its body, its tip piercing the golden ring.</p><p>A bloody hole appeared on the beast, its roar intensified by agony and murderous intent.</p><p>The purple-robed elder sensed danger and attempted to reinforce the Vajra Subduing Demon Array, but it was too late. A clang of metal echoed as the bone spur burst forth, releasing a bizarre energy unlike anything they’d seen before.  The Subduing Demon Ring shattered.</p><p>The bone spur continued its trajectory, piercing the void, heading straight for the Jade Lightning Sound Array.</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>The purple-robed elder roared.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A golden sword was struck by the bone spur, a deep gash appearing, almost severing it.  A groan followed, and a figure fell from above the sword—the female cultivator, pale and seemingly gravely injured.</p><p>The purple-robed elder gasped, “Retreat!”  He threw a purple cloth he held, and the cultivators moved in unison, gathering around him.</p><p>Within moments, three golden swords had been damaged, and the Jade Lightning Sound Array was nearing collapse.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Lightning erupted, engulfing them.  At the last moment, they recovered their array instruments.  When the light subsided, everyone had vanished, leaving only the beast’s screams.</p><p>Bereft of its target, the beast raged, wreaking havoc, its fury unchecked.  If this had occurred anywhere but the deserted storm zone, it would have caused immense devastation.</p><p>Ultimately, unable to locate its enemies, the beast departed, its anger still simmering.</p><p>On the small island, the protective barrier remained closed, shrouded in darkness. The Eight Views Sect cultivators held their breath, hardly daring to move, until the beast's roars faded into the distance.  Only then did they exhale, exchanging shocked glances.</p><p>“That beast… was far more terrifying than the last,” the female cultivator whispered, still shaken.</p><p>“Indeed. Its physical strength was far superior. Although our Vajra Subduing Demon Array is not as powerful as a true Buddhist formation, its swift breakdown was unexpected,” the purple-robed elder sighed, turning to the long-bearded Taoist. “Have you recorded the battle?”</p><p>The long-bearded Taoist nodded, presenting a crystal; within, the battle replayed.  Only then did they realize that they had lost half their Jade Lightning Sound Array, several were injured, and despite the significant losses, they hadn't even gotten a clear view of the beast.</p>
