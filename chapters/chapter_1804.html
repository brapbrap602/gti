<h1>Chapter 1795: A Chance Encounter in a Strange Land</h1><p>The three left Fengdai and eventually met up with Master Zhijian and the others.</p><p>Everyone except Venerable Zhenru had arrived.</p><p>Master Zhijian and Master Zhang appeared unharmed, their auras calm.  A Daoist priest was with them.</p><p>This man, in a high crown and flowing robes, possessed an air of ethereal grace.</p><p>Seeing the jade pendant at the Daoist's waist, Qin Sang and the others' expressions tightened, and they respectfully greeted him, "Greetings to the Nine Heavens Inspector and the two Masters."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flashed with the Daoist court's ranks.</p><p>A Nine Heavens Inspector held a rank of Fourth Grade Official in the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy, typically filled by late Nascent Soul cultivators or those who had made significant contributions at the mid Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This person’s aura surpassed even Li Hou's.</p><p>His cultivation, along with the backing of the Northern Pole Exorcism Academy, commanded their utmost respect.</p><p>Master Zhijian stepped forward, introducing, "This is Master Wan, the Nine Heavens Inspector. We just met. Master Zhang and I have been searching for you three. It’s fortunate you are safe.  We'll now proceed to another location to rendezvous with others."</p><p>"What about Venerable Zhenru?"</p><p>Master Guyun asked.</p><p>Master Zhang shook his head, "We found a message left by Venerable Zhenru. He was unfortunately injured and has withdrawn from Xinghe, waiting for us at the Golden Hall."</p><p>Master Wan’s gaze swept over the three, "I was traveling in the Abyssal Wasteland when I received a message from that old Daoist, Hong Yuzi. I only just arrived. Have you discovered any clues regarding the cause of the golden light?"</p><p>Masters Youhuang and Guyun both looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang shake her head, both admitted ignorance.</p><p>Li Hou was tight-lipped. Qin Sang had tried to extract information during their pursuit, but he hadn't revealed any secrets.</p><p>However, Li Hou and the other two demon lords were unharmed, indicating the source of the golden light's outburst was likely not dangerous, and Gui Fang's forces remained unscathed.</p><p>Master Zhijian transmitted a voice message, "Master Hong Yuzi is a Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor of the Tianshu Academy.  Show him utmost respect, Masters."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances, secretly amazed.</p><p>The presence of both a Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor and a Nine Heavens Inspector signified the Daoist court's serious attention to this matter; they dispatched two Fourth Grade officials before even understanding the situation.</p><p>Great Masters rarely appeared, and Fourth Grade officials were top-tier powerhouses rarely seen by ordinary people.</p><p>Master Wan made a gesture, casting an unknown incantation. After confirming Hong Yuzi's location, he spread his sleeves wide, and talismanic shadows materialized above, shining like stars, showering them with streamers.</p><p>They felt as if they were inside a treasure carriage, shielded from all disturbances, only needing to follow Master Wan forward.</p><p>Master Wan seemed pressed for time, rarely altering course, flying almost straight ahead, passing through illusions without hesitation.  Few things could impede his progress.</p><p>Yet, he displayed no other techniques; only the shifting talismanic shadows firmly protected them.</p><p>It was clear that Master Wan was using a talismanic diagram.</p><p>Such diagrams were combinations of multiple divine talismans, similar to formations, more potent than individual talismans, demanding greater skill from the caster, usually requiring advance preparation or multiple casters.</p><p>Cultivators of the Military Banner Sect could combine forces to use simple talismanic diagrams at low cultivation levels.</p><p>Yet, Master Wan summoned no troops.</p><p>The group exchanged glances, filled with awe, silently trailing behind Master Wan, cutting through the governance altar’s interior.</p><p>After a stick of incense, a thick grey curtain blocked their path, like an iron wall.</p><p>The talismanic diagram trembled, sending out a wave that shattered the curtain, creating cracks. Master Wan was the first to step through.</p><p>More grey curtains existed within, but thinner. Master Wan continued breaking them.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others followed closely, just passing the last curtain when they heard Master Wan's surprised voice, "Old geezer, you’re injured?"</p><p>All eyes turned to the interior of the curtain, revealing an octagonal stone pavilion.</p><p>The pavilion was ancient and elegant, bearing the marks of time – an antique.</p><p>Strangely, there was no mountain or earth; the grey curtain enclosed a small space, with the pavilion suspended within.</p><p>Inside, two figures could be seen, one seated and one standing.</p><p>The seated person, with white hair and youthful features, possessed a refined air that rivaled Master Wan’s, but his face was pale, his breath heavy, his chest rising and falling rapidly, clearly injured.</p><p>“This must be the Nine Heavens Golden Que Imperial Censor…”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, scanning the other person.</p><p>The other figure, in armor, was tall and strong, with a stiff expression, unlike ordinary people.</p><p>Seeing this person, Qin Sang felt a sense of familiarity, suddenly remembering something, her heart jolting.</p><p>That aura…</p><p>So familiar!</p><p>Yin-Yang Puppet!</p><p>Qin Sang had a strong impression of Yin-Yang Puppets. Mo Xingdao had used one to steal a Spiritual Wisdom Immortal Fruit from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, something even Master Zilei couldn't prevent.</p><p>She had even sold off a Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal, a bad deal, giving Mo Xingdao a bargain.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to sense the same energy fluctuations in another world, and even more surprisingly, the dark-skinned man in the pavilion and Moxingdao's puppet looked almost identical.</p><p>The existence of similar puppetry techniques in this world wasn't unusual.  However, the puppets crafted by practitioners from two different worlds being exactly alike was beyond belief.</p><p>Just then, the dark-skinned man raised his head, his indifferent gaze sweeping across the assembled people, without lingering on Qin Sang.</p><p>In that instant of eye contact, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.  The feeling of familiarity intensified; the man's gaze seemed deeply meaningful.</p><p>The dark-skinned man was acting as a protector for Hongyuzi.  Having confirmed that the newcomers weren't demons, he lowered his head again, remaining silent.</p><p>Seeing that the dark-skinned man hadn't treated him differently, Qin Sang seemed to understand something and, appearing unconcerned, looked away.</p><p>Fortunately, years of cultivation had honed his composure; his expression remained unchanged.  However, a deep turmoil stirred within him.</p><p>"Forgive my intrusion, Master Wan," Hongyuzi in the pavilion opened his eyes and sighed, "When the golden light erupted, Daoist Mo and I were deep within an illusionary realm within the altar.  The golden light activated the ancient power remnants within the illusion. Fortunately, we reacted quickly and retreated. Otherwise…"</p><p>The name Mo!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>He was eighty percent certain: this person was Moxingdao!</p><p>"A puppet body… Did Moxingdao choose to inhabit a puppet? But why is he in this world?  Where are the Hui Guang Saint and the Qinghu Saint King?"</p><p>An unexpected reunion with an acquaintance sparked countless questions in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>After establishing himself in this world, Qin Sang began investigating whether anyone had ascended here, hoping to determine if he'd ascended to the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>Cultivation in the Storm World was arduous, and achieving the Transformation God stage was incredibly difficult.  Yet, the Central Plains region never lacked those who ascended.</p><p>From the distant Wu Xiang Immortal Sect to the closer Eight Views, Ganlu Zen Temple, and the East Sea Demon Clan – the number of ascendants wasn't insignificant.</p><p>These individuals were either exceptional talents or favored by the world's luck. Even if they eventually faded into obscurity in the higher realms, their ascension wouldn't go unnoticed.</p><p>Yet, neither the Jushan sects nor the Daoist Courts had any records of ascendants.  Qin Sang couldn't even find any texts about ascension tribulation.</p><p>Either all ascendants were hiding for some reason, or he'd come to the wrong place.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially believed the latter, but then he unexpectedly encountered an old friend.</p><p>Master Wan entered the stone pavilion, checking Hongyuzi's injuries while asking, "Is it confirmed that the altar's anomaly was caused by demons?"</p><p>"It's certain. The golden light and the demons are inextricably linked. However, what they did inside remains unknown. My fellow Daoists who entered the altar are currently trying to track the demons, but we lacked manpower.  Master Wan's timely arrival is a great relief," Hongyuzi said, visibly relieved.</p><p>"I have a vial of Yu Xue Pill left, which should help alleviate your injuries."</p><p>Master Wan produced a vial of pills, and Hongyuzi gratefully accepted and took them.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Master Wan addressed those outside the pavilion, "Tell me about your experiences before and after the golden light erupted…"</p><p>Hongyuzi, while refining the medicine, said with closed eyes, "All of you should also quickly recover your Qi.  Once I've stabilized my injuries, we will investigate the depths of the altar together. Rest assured, the Daoist Court will not mistreat you."</p><p>The assembled people exchanged glances.</p><p>Among the five masters present, only Master Zhijian had the strength to refuse the Daoist Court, besides Qin Sang.</p><p>Masters Zhang, Youhuang, and Guyun, either relied on their ancestral legacies or sought advancement, having already agreed to the Daoist Court's terms.</p><p>And Master Zhijian, being the initiator of this operation, couldn't easily back down.</p><p>Master Zhang spoke first, "We were initially searching the Golden Hall for the demons…"</p><p>Master Zhijian then recounted his experience.</p><p>It turned out that after being thrown off the stone platform, they were separated and, like Qin Sang's group, converged towards the location Master Youhuang had mentioned.</p><p>Next, Masters Youhuang and Guyun described their experiences, only mentioning Qin Sang's help in repelling pursuers, omitting the matter of him killing Marquis Li.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang spoke, bowing slightly to the two masters in the pavilion, "I'm afraid I cannot accompany you two."</p><p>He had already obtained the demon marquis's corpse, accomplishing his objective.  Returning for advancement and to recover his strength was paramount.</p><p>Two high-ranking officials had appeared; the situation was becoming increasingly complex.</p><p>He didn't want to become entangled in it.</p><p>The golden light pursued by the demons might be a treasure, but Qin Sang hadn't yet fully mastered his own abilities and artifacts, and he wasn't willing to risk it.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Hongyuzi slowly raised his head and looked over, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Wan Zhenren's expression remained unchanged as he sized Qin Sang up, smiling faintly.  "Clear Wind Zhenren appears to primarily cultivate physical strength, but in my humble opinion, that's merely a superficial observation.  Cultivating both spiritual power and physical strength, and achieving such remarkable proficiency in both, demonstrates exceptional talent! It's a shame I haven't heard of Zhenren's name before; truly a hidden gem!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.  Neither the Sword-Wielding Zhenren nor the others had revealed his background, yet Wan Zhenren had seen through him at a glance!</p><p>"During the chaos, I encountered a demon lord and killed it, but was severely wounded in the process, my vital energy is unstable. I ask both Zhenrens to understand."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, presenting the demon lord's corpse and discreetly glanced at the dark-skinned man.</p><p>This man followed Hong Yuzi. If he was indeed Mo Xingdao, his activities in this realm would eventually be discovered.  The fact that his identity wasn't revealed directly suggested another plan.</p><p>"You killed a demon lord?"</p><p>Wan Zhenren showed surprise.  Everyone's gaze was drawn to the badger-like corpse in Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>"When I encountered it, it was already injured for reasons unknown.  I managed to trap it, but the demon still possessed terrifying strength. I consumed a Stabilizing Elixir and fought desperately, finally managing to kill it with great difficulty," Qin Sang said, still shaken.</p><p>The lingering effects of the wood spirit energy meant his vital energy was unsteady, making him appear seriously wounded.</p><p>The Sword-Wielding Zhenren and the others corroborated Qin Sang's recent advancement and his acceptance of the invitation to secure promotion.</p><p>"It's Li Hou!"</p><p>After careful examination, Wan Zhenren’s face registered astonishment. He looked at Qin Sang again with renewed interest.</p><p>The Daoist Court held limited information on Li Hou, but it was certain that this demon possessed considerable strength and several formidable techniques.  For someone newly ascended to the Dongxuan Realm, even with cultivation of both spiritual and physical powers, hunting such a demon without paying a price was virtually impossible.</p><p>Wan Zhenren and Hong Yuzi exchanged a silent conversation, then Wan Zhenren nodded. "Daoist friend, having accomplished the feat of slaying a demon, your priority should be to recover. However, with your injuries, returning alone would be dangerous. This location is relatively secluded; demons won't easily find us.  If anyone else is injured later, they will also return here to recover. We hope you'll stay and help provide support."</p><p>"Don't leave the assembly grounds until this matter is resolved. I'm not exaggerating; if the demons' plan is substantial, there will certainly be ambushes outside.  There might even be a demon king watching this place, ready to appear at any moment!" Hong Yuzi said gravely, addressing both Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the pressure as well; he'd sensed it upon seeing the two fourth-rank immortal officials.</p><p>Fortunately, the Grand Zhenren and the demon king dared not enter the assembly grounds.</p><p>Wan Zhenren's jade pendant glowed, shooting out a beam of light that transformed into a talisman which flew towards Qin Sang.  "We must take this corpse.  Once this is done, Daoist friend, you can use this talisman to go to either department of the Daoist Court and receive appropriate merit and compensation."</p><p>Slaying a demon lord was a great achievement.  The demon corpse could be kept; if handed over to the Daoist Court, it could be exchanged for treasures of equivalent value.</p><p>Qin Sang kept Li Hou's most valuable possessions—the claw gauntlets and the throat bone spike.</p><p>Unfortunately, to preserve the corpse's integrity, he hadn't removed Li Hou’s armor, which meant he couldn’t melt the scales into his Wind-Returning Armor.  However, the Daoist Court certainly wouldn't lack such treasures, so Qin Sang had no objections to handing over the corpse.</p><p>The stone pavilion was small.</p><p>Luckily, the gray curtain's range was vast, divided into spaces of varying sizes, most containing floating fragments of stone.</p><p>Leaving the pavilion's space, Qin Sang and the others sought nearby places to settle and meditate.</p><p>Qin Sang found a small space with several irregular rocks.  As soon as he settled, his expression turned grave as he gazed at a small stone beside him. A dark light flowed across its surface, and features resembling those carved with an axe and chisel appeared.</p><p>"Daoist Mo, it's really you!"</p><p>Qin Sang extended his spiritual sense to touch the stone.</p><p>He couldn't believe Mo Xingdao dared to make contact in front of two Daoist Court immortal officials.</p><p>"Hong Yuzi discovered you outside the assembly grounds.  I've been waiting for you, Daoist friend."</p><p>The stone seemed to have become Mo Xingdao's puppet.</p><p>Its hollow eyes fixed on Qin Sang, its tone devoid of inflection.</p><p>"Before seeing you, Daoist friend, I never imagined that the first acquaintance I'd meet in this realm would be you! Should I address you as Qin Zhenren or Clear Wind Zhenren?"</p>
