<h1>Chapter 2015: Shattered World</h1><p>Gu Ya also sensed someone approaching, stepping back behind Qin Sang and gazing in the direction of the newcomers.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>Five streaks of escaping light weaved through the wind and sand. They had just emerged from a fierce battle, their hands stained with blood, their murderous aura still lingering, their killing intent soaring.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The leading streak of light abruptly halted, a man’s cold voice echoing out.</p><p>The four streaks of light following close behind immediately stopped as well.</p><p>The newcomers consisted of four men and one woman. The four men all wore similar black robes, while the woman was clad in a purple robe that revealed her alluring figure.  Her appearance was strikingly enchanting, and whether intentional or not, a scar ran across the bridge of her nose, not detracting from her beauty but adding a touch of wildness.</p><p>The group’s positioning after appearing revealed their varying levels of closeness.</p><p>The one who had spoken was a young man with delicate features, one of the four men. A short, stout cultivator stuck close to him. The other two men, one old and one young, stood together, appearing like grandfather and grandson. The woman stood slightly apart but closer to the delicate-featured young man’s group.</p><p>“Brother Yuan, have you discovered something?” the elder of the grandfather-grandson pair inquired.</p><p>The delicate-featured young man said suspiciously, “The two Qian brothers haven’t moved. Don’t you find it strange?”</p><p>This group didn't belong to the same Immortal Sect. To prevent treachery, they had agreed upon certain restrictive measures when forming their alliance. For example, they all cast a secret technique that allowed them to sense each other's locations at any time.</p><p>“Brother Yuan, you mean…”</p><p>The elder frowned, looking ahead.</p><p>The delicate-featured young man glanced at the others. “Earlier, when we ambushed Old Devil Chen's descendants, the two Qian brothers seemed to have taken a liking to a certain treasure and chased after it. But there doesn't seem to be any sign of a fight ahead. If they succeeded, why haven't they returned immediately? What treasure could make them abandon Old Devil Chen's inherited Blood Seal?  If they didn’t succeed…”</p><p>“Then they’ve been captured!” the elder said gravely.</p><p>“Who could capture the two Qian brothers?”</p><p>The stout man’s face was full of astonishment. “After they left, we dealt with Old Devil Chen's remaining descendants without much trouble. In such a short time, with the two Qian brothers’ abilities, even if they were outmatched, they wouldn't be captured alive, would they…?”</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Everyone looked at the delicate-featured young man’s right hand. He had just crushed a communication jade talisman. This type of talisman was specifically refined for this operation. However, there was no response from ahead.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The delicate-featured young man didn’t hesitate, turning to leave.</p><p>Before the elder could speak, the young man furrowed his delicate brows, hesitating. “This isn't right, is it? The two Qian brothers have been quite dedicated and have made great contributions. Besides, we all swore an oath to support each other and not betray one another.  We don’t even know what happened, and we’re abandoning them. It’s neither right nor reasonable…”</p><p>“Right and reasonable?”</p><p>The delicate-featured young man scoffed disdainfully.</p><p>“Think about where we are, how many powerful cultivators come and go through the Abundant Jade Gate! Don't assume that being close to the Great Zhou will make those mighty figures restrain themselves.  Here, they're even more unrestrained than in the Dark Lands. If the two Qian brothers provoked some formidable character, should we all be buried with them? Furthermore, the oath we made during the alliance had a premise: it applies only when facing the remnants of the Chen Clan. The two Qian brothers were blinded by greed and left on their own.  Fortunately, the remaining Chen Clan descendants weren't strong. Otherwise, their actions would only have jeopardized the greater plan. Ultimately, it's their own fault!”</p><p>The delicate-featured young man was blunt, his tone bordering on reprimanding. The young man's face flushed and paled.</p><p>While speaking, the delicate-featured young man had already activated his escape technique. The stout man followed him closely. The grandfather and grandson looked at the purple-robed woman. Seeing that she was also preparing to leave, they didn't say anything more.</p><p>Just as the five were about to retreat, a light chuckle suddenly echoed in their ears.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>The laughter was ethereal yet clearly audible, seemingly coming from all directions, making it impossible to pinpoint its source.</p><p>“You are wiser than I expected. In that case, I won't make things difficult for you. Leave the Chen Clan’s inherited Blood Seal, and you can go.”</p><p>The calm voice sent shivers down their spines, causing their hair to stand on end.</p><p>‘Swish, swish!’</p><p>The five immediately formed a battle formation, centered around the delicate-featured young man, their faces filled with vigilance.</p><p>“May I ask who is this fellow Daoist? Why not show yourself? We merely temporarily cooperated with the two Qian brothers; we are not their companions. If the two Qian brothers offended you, it has nothing to do with us. We will not interfere, and you are free to deal with them as you please,” the delicate-featured young man called out to the void.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the other party ignored his words completely, still speaking in a calm and indifferent tone.</p><p>“My patience is limited. I’ll give you three breaths.”</p><p>In an instant, they could almost hear each other’s breathing. Three breaths were about to pass.</p><p>The inherited Blood Seal was held by the delicate-featured young man, and he undoubtedly bore the greatest pressure. The others were also looking at him.</p><p>This was a difficult decision.</p><p>If the other party was bluffing and they were scared into handing over the treasure, they would be the laughingstock of the world. But what if the other party truly was a powerful cultivator…</p><p>“I don't want this inherited Blood Seal anymore. Please deal with it as you see fit,” the delicate-featured young man said, taking out a square seal and gently tossing it upwards.</p><p>The stout man’s face was filled with reluctance. His lips moved, as if he wanted to say something, but the delicate-featured young man glared at him fiercely. He instantly fell silent and hurriedly fled outwards with the delicate-featured young man.</p><p>The remaining three stared at the inherited Blood Seal, looking at each other.</p><p>The delicate-featured young man was the strongest among them, and he had organized the alliance.  During their pursuit of Old Devil Chen's descendants, his sharp judgment and extraordinary strategies had convinced everyone.  Unexpectedly, he would actually abandon the inherited Blood Seal, which they had painstakingly obtained, without even seeing the enemy's face.</p><p>Hesitation flickered in the purple-robed woman’s eyes, but she finally hardened her heart, turned into a streak of purple light, and fled as well.</p><p>The elder sighed softly and pulled the reluctant young man after her.</p><p>After they left, the square seal suddenly stopped falling and shot towards the depths of the wind and sand.</p><p>The stout man, still unwilling, saw that there were indeed no pursuers behind him and looked back repeatedly. “Brother, are we really just giving away the Chen Clan's inherited Blood Seal? You sensed the fluctuations within the seal. Legend has it that Old Devil Chen's medicinal field is likely here.  It's not only filled with countless spiritual herbs, but it might also be Old Devil Chen’s treasure vault. It’s so close!”</p><p>“Are spiritual herbs more important than your life?”</p><p>The delicate-featured young man glanced back. The purple-robed woman and the grandfather-grandson pair had caught up.</p><p>“The Chen Clan is extinct, and we know all of Old Devil Chen’s secrets. After we return, Old Devil Chen's Daoist abode will be ours, enough for us to enjoy for a while. Let’s just pretend we never got the inherited Blood Seal,” the delicate-featured young man’s words weren't just for the stout cultivator, but also a reminder to the other three.</p><p>Hearing this, the three’s expressions improved considerably.</p><p>As the five departed, the inherited Blood Seal fell into Qin Sang’s hands.</p><p>“Quite a character.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked in the direction the five had left, lost in thought.</p><p>If these five had come to him, he wouldn't have minded taking them down as well.</p><p>After entering the Great Thousand World, Qin Sang clearly felt that cultivation in the Great Thousand World was much easier than in the Small Thousand World.  There was no need to desperately fight for limited cultivation resources like in the Small Thousand World, constantly striving to avoid falling behind.</p><p>Between the Eight Great Heavenly Provinces, there were even uncharted wilderness areas, not to mention the vast world beyond.</p><p>The stable situation in the Great Zhou and the smooth exchanges between the Eight Great Heavenly Provinces meant that many cultivation necessities could be obtained through trade, without the need to search everywhere. Cultivators often remained in secluded cultivation for years. As long as they had sufficient talent, they could achieve a decent level of cultivation by following a steady path.</p><p>Those who constantly walked on the edge of life and death, struggling all the way, possessed a unique aura. The delicate-featured young man was one, and Qu Zhen and the others from the Everlasting Sand Society could be considered as such. The places Qin Sang had visited since arriving in the Great Zhou were mostly orderly Immortal Cities, and few cultivators he had met were like this.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the square seal and examined it.</p><p>These people came to seize the inherited Blood Seal.  And the Chen Clan descendants, instead of going elsewhere, chose to come to the more dangerous Abundant Jade Gate. There must be more to it than just using it as a decoy.</p><p>As his divine sense touched the inherited Blood Seal, Qin Sang indeed sensed something unusual.  Inside the square seal, there was a hair-thin blood thread, refined using special methods.</p><p>Upon touching the blood thread, an extremely faint fluctuation emanated.  In some inexplicable way, Qin Sang seemed to have a vague feeling.</p><p>Perhaps the distance was too great to determine the source of the feeling, but Qin Sang could tell that it was in the direction of the Abundant Jade Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't have high expectations for treasures, but since Old Devil Chen had specifically refined an inherited Blood Seal, it must point to a hidden location, which could serve as a temporary shelter for Gu Ya to settle down and heal.</p><p>Gu Ya had been caught off guard when the two sides encountered each other and was quite seriously injured. Otherwise, she wouldn't have been entangled by those two.</p><p>“Senior Qin, what should we do with them?”</p><p>Gu Ya pointed at the two on the ground and asked.</p><p>“Don’t kill them yet. Bring them along,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Exploring the Abundant Jade Gate would inevitably involve some dangerous places. He needed pathfinders.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang repel the attackers with just a few words, Gu Ya's reverence deepened.  Obediently, she flicked out a sleeve ribbon and tied the two up tightly.</p><p>The two were restrained by Qin Sang and had no power to resist. Ever since the delicate-featured young man and the others left, they had fallen into complete despair, their faces ashen.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the square seal and looked in the direction of the carriage, transmitting his voice: “Fellow Daoist Xin, I have urgent matters and will go ahead. I’ll meet up with you at the agreed-upon location later. Qu Zhen, you stay with Fellow Daoist Xin.  As for the matters you mentioned, I’ll consider them after we reach the Abundant Jade Gate.”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>“Elder Qin, please proceed.”</p><p>Qu Zhen and Young Master Xin responded via voice transmission.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Qin Sang took Gu Ya and, using his escape technique, flew directly towards the Abundant Jade Gate.  The closer they got to the Abundant Jade Gate, the clearer the feeling from the inherited Blood Seal became.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Rumble, rumble!’</p><p>Deafening roars came continuously.</p><p>Gu Ya gazed into the distance, astonishment filling her eyes. At the edge of the earth, everything was grayish.  There was no sky, no ground, as if space itself had been torn and shattered, leaving only a boundless gray storm.</p><p>Visible turbulent currents roared towards them and then past, like a giant millstone between heaven and earth, possessing the terrifying power to crush everything.</p><p>Chaotic!</p><p>Dangerous!</p><p>This was Gu Ya’s most immediate impression of the Abundant Jade Gate. Inwardly, she thought, “It truly deserves its reputation as an ancient battlefield.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang taking her straight towards the storm, Gu Ya couldn’t help but ask, “Senior Qin, are we entering from here?”</p><p>Even though it was only the edge of the Abundant Jade Gate, Gu Ya still felt deeply uneasy.</p><p>Qin Sang hummed in agreement. Although the storm was strong, it was within his tolerance.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Gu Ya only felt darkness before her eyes as she plunged into the storm.  It felt as though she had passed through a strange barrier, after which the surroundings fell silent. Inside, it wasn’t actually calm; Qin Sang had simply erected a protective Qi barrier for her.</p><p>Straining her eyes, she saw gray earth below, stretching as far as the eye could see. Naturally, there couldn't be any living beings on this desolate land.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, his expression shifting slightly, as if he had noticed something. He suddenly looked up at the sky. The storm above was even more terrifying, forming massive swirling vortexes within the dense gray canopy.</p><p>Next, to Gu Ya’s surprise, Qin Sang actually took her upwards, flying directly towards the strongest part of the storm.</p><p>The Qi barrier firmly protected Gu Ya.</p><p>When they passed through the storm vortex, they saw a scene that defied common sense. Above the storm wasn't the sky, but another landmass.  The landmass was inverted, with mountain peaks pointing downwards, as if about to crash onto the other landmass below, yet they didn't actually collide.</p><p>“How is this…”</p><p>While passing through the storm, Gu Ya felt an extraordinary chaos and knew it definitely wasn't as simple as an overturned landmass.</p><p>“Two Small Thousand Worlds! Shattered Small Thousand Worlds!” Qin Sang said softly.</p><p>This was clearly the remnants of two Small Thousand Worlds, pressed together, their world barriers shattered, forming the never-ending storm.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he witnessed such a shocking scene upon entering the Abundant Jade Gate. Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the Ju Mountain Altar of Governance in the Talisman Seal World. He hadn't been able to enter the deepest part of the altar. He wondered if there were shattered Small Thousand Worlds within as well. Perhaps those illusory scenes created by divine abilities contained fragments of Small Thousand Worlds, but his insight wasn't enough to perceive them.</p><p>The ancient war could even shatter Small Thousand Worlds. Qin Sang, already a Soul Formation cultivator, couldn't imagine how terrifying the divine abilities of a Great Ascension cultivator must be.</p><p>Other than that, this place was desolate, with nothing much to see.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Ya travelled between the two landmasses, continuing to fly forward. The scenery along the way was monotonous. Finally, they reached the edge of the upper landmass.</p><p>As if cut by a knife, a neat斷茬 appeared at the edge of the landmass, with endless darkness beyond. Qin Sang's figure flickered, flying past the edge, but instead of entering the darkness directly, he appeared in another space.</p><p>This place was still desolate and chaotic, but better than the outside. This was considered entering the Small Thousand World. The landmass outside was just a corner revealed after the shattering of the Small Thousand World.</p><p>This Small Thousand World was nearly destroyed, riddled with holes. There was no longer a World Beacon Gate to speak of. Qin Sang flew for a while, passing through a “fissure,” and left this Small Thousand World.</p><p>Being led by Qin Sang through this place, Gu Ya felt a sense of时空错乱.</p>
