     <p class="calibre5">
      On the spaceship, everyone was doing their own thing. They had
                already gotten used to this lifestyle over those two months.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao went back to his room alone, opened the interface, and
                rubbed his hands together.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Four chances, four consecutive draws, don’t disappoint me
                again.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After failing so many times, he was already very calm about it.
                As a Mechanic, he believed in making up for quality with
                quantity.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Beep beep beep!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Just as he was about to start using the Random Reward, his
                communicator suddenly rang. He received a communication.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Who is it‽”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The ceremonial feeling was interrupted, so a hint of displeasure
                leaked into Han Xiao’s tone.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It’s me, Nereja. Do you still remember me?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Looking at the Godoran on the screen, Han Xiao recognized him
                straight away. “Oh, you’re that green… ahem, I’m happy to see
                you. This seems to be the first time you’ve contacted me since
                what happened last time. What is this about? Are you hiring me
                again?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “No, I’m here to relay a message.” Nereja smiled and said, “Do
                you know someone called Kerlodd? He was my classmate in the
                Observer Training Class. He contacted me a few days ago and said
                that his Observer ID was used by someone else, somewhere else,
                which happened to be near us. I mentioned you when I chatted
                with him. When he heard your name, his reaction was a little…
                er, extreme. He seems to want you to pay him back some money.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao understood what had happened. He had entered Kerlodd’s
                ID on the system of the missing spaceship. The radiation storm
                had blocked the signal at that time, but when he brought the
                system core back to the space station, the people there had
                naturally checked the logs and noticed that access attempt.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Kerlodd was the Godora Observer who had been sent to investigate
                Planet Aquamarine and subsequently captured by Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded. “Oh, we are very good friends. How’s that guy?
                Send him my regards.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Nereja’s expression was a little strange.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “… Are you sure you are friends? He told me to say, ‘Black Star,
                don’t use my ID again! When are you going to pay back the money
                you blackmailed from me? You’re already a renowned mercenary.
                Are you really this petty about a few hundred Enas?'”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Hehe, he still loves to joke as always,” Han Xiao said. “Our
                friendship was created through life and death. How can that be
                measured by money?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had shown mercy to Kerlodd back then and did not take
                his life. Was that not a friendship created through life and
                death?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Speaking of which, he had kept his word and let Kerlodd go back
                then to have a channel of contacting Godora. He did not expect
                himself to join Floating Dragon Island afterward. Nonetheless,
                Kerlodd was still useful.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       I told Kerlodd to pay attention to the abnormalities on
                  Planet Aquamarine. I wonder if they sent someone else to
                  investigate. Maybe this will lead to changes in the Version
                  2.0 storyline… Should be good changes,
      </em>
      Han Xiao thought.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Alright, you tell him that I got the message, and I’m not going
                to pay him back.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Okay then…” Nereja gave a bitter smile. He suddenly recalled
                something and said, “By the way, we had a personnel transfer not
                long ago. The original station chief was transferred away, and
                the deputy station chief took over the space station. It’s
                really hard to figure out what the higher-ups are thinking.
                Anyway, it’s a good thing. The deputy station chief is much
                better than the original station chief. The station chief
                discovered that I was the one who hired you and gave me a
                penalty, such an awful guy.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao raised his brow and said, “The station chief? I don’t
                have a problem with him—he’s a good man. On the contrary, the
                deputy station chief is a very slippery guy. If he did not have
                a motive, why did he mention an unsolved internal matter to a
                mercenary that he had just met?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Furthermore, the rescued Observers all rooted for you. Who
                would expose you? Your opinion of the station chief now means
                that the deputy station chief’s act of transferring him was
                effective. Nonetheless, a good man might not be a useful man.
                Even though the deputy station chief did not mean well, without
                him, your wife and those missing Observers would not have been
                saved. Hence, seeing the results, maybe you won’t regret being
                used.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Actually, the person that gave out the daily missions that
                rewarded Interstellar Beast Dungeon Crystals was exactly the
                deputy station chief who later became the station chief. He
                ordered the players to deal with some internal affairs and
                quickly improved his performance. If it was the original station
                chief, he definitely would not have let outsiders interfere with
                their internal affairs.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “What you said seems to make some sense. After the station chief
                was transferred away, the deputy station chief looked very
                happy.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Nereja was dazed for a moment and looked like he had something
                on his mind. He then sighed and said, “Sigh, speaking of which,
                the old station chief only followed the regulations. Although he
                was a little pedantic, he was once a military officer after all,
                so it’s understandable.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Anyway, I still like the deputy station chief a little more. If
                everything was done following the rules, the world would not
                only have that three Universal Civilizations now, and the war
                would still be going on. The other civilizations would have no
                choice but to become vassals, or they would be destroyed by the
                flames of war…
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Sigh, between hypocrisy and war, I would choose the former, and
                most people would probably do the same. Although I don’t know
                much, I can guess that the Black Forest Age of the exploration
                history was definitely hell. The peaceful Galaxy Calendar age
                now was not achieved with ease…”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Got it, got it. I have something to do, bye.” Han Xiao
                decisively closed the communication. He opened the interface
                again and exhaled.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Let’s begin…
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Beep beep beep!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      At this time, the communicator rang again.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Interrupted again, Han Xiao was boiling.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Can’t I do my consecutive draws peacefully‽ The luck that I
                  gathered is vanishing!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Who the hell… oh, Ames, hi, are you well? What is it?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      To Han Xiao’s surprise, the alluring and sexy Dragon Emperor
                appeared on the screen. Ames had never contacted him before, so
                why did she suddenly call him?
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Black Star, I need you.” Ames’ expression was a little strange.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s mouth twitched. “Pardon me, but what kind of need are
                you talking about?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I found my teacher’s whereabouts. He came to the Shattered Star
                Ring. Black Star, you saw what he looked like personally.
                Accompany me to look for him.” Ames’ tone was assertive.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Okay…” Han Xiao held his forehead. “When?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “As soon as possible. I will immediately notify you when I
                return to the Shattered Star Ring.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Are you not on Floating Dragon Island now?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I went to the Federation of Light’s mother planet for
                sightseeing,” Ames said.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Great Mechanic Han was speechless.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Alright,” Han Xiao said, “where’s your teacher now?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Someone said that he appeared on Noriosse some time ago. Go
                there to take a look first before I return.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded without panicking. Although him seeing the
                Dragon Emperor’s teacher before was a lie, he did indeed know
                who the Dragon Emperor’s teacher was. He was not afraid of not
                being to recognize that person.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After hanging up the communication, Han Xiao massaged his temple
                and opened the interface for the third time.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Let’s do this quickly, I have a feeling I’m not in luck again…
                no one will find me again I hope.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After being interrupted twice, Han Xiao’s excitement was gone.
                He stared at the interface with an expressionless face.

     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s face was calm. He did not stop and immediately
                started to draw the second Random Reward.

     <p class="calibre5">
      Please select one from the three reward below:

     <p class="calibre5">
      Gene Awakening Elixir (Luxurious Version): If the user has no
                Main Class, using this has a chance to turn the user into an
                Esper.

     <p class="calibre5">
      Double Experience Card: Doubles the experience gained through

      Ability Enhancement Card: 70% chance to enhance an ability when

     <p class="calibre5">_____________________</p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Two cards but no Mission Completion Card.” Han Xiao felt his
                chest was hurting.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Comparatively, the Ability Enhancement Card was somewhat useful
                to him, but Han Xiao was still frustrated over not getting what
                he wanted.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Without a doubt, the Gene Awakening Elixir was trash, and he did
                not need the Double Experience Card, so he chose the Ability
                Enhancement Card straight away.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I feel lucky! Third time’s the charm!”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao felt hopeful as he activated another Random Reward.

     <p class="calibre5">
      He had always thought that, of all the reward types, experience

      He picked the highest option of 2,000,000 experience and
