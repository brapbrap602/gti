<h1>Chapter 1516: The Soul-Seizing Incantation (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1516: The Soul-Seizing Incantation (4k)</p><p>Qin Sang lightly patted his pouch, releasing Yin Dianzhu's Nascent Soul.</p><p>Before entering the stone tablet space, Yin Dianzhu was released for a brief look, then resealed.</p><p>Regaining consciousness, Yin Dianzhu glared at Qin Sang, filled with intense resentment and disappointment.</p><p>He guessed that the Sacred Land's upheaval was inextricably linked to the Hunmo and Tianpeng demons. He had hoped to see Qin Sang and Tong Lingyu perish at the hands of the demons, joining him in death.</p><p>Alas, it was not to be.</p><p>Qin Sang stared into Yin Dianzhu's eyes.  "I have no pleasure in torturing people. I simply wish to ask a few questions, Daoist friend. Answer truthfully, and I'll grant you a swift death. Don't try to use this to bargain with me; I will not let a tiger return to the mountain."</p><p>Yin Dianzhu's eyes widened, unleashing a terrifying killing intent, provoked by Qin Sang's words.</p><p>"The victor prevails; with your intellect, Daoist Yin, you should understand this. There's no need for this posture," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The killing intent on Yin Dianzhu's face remained intense, but his eyes regained some composure, coldly observing Qin Sang.</p><p>...</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Yinri Region.</p><p>Tian Mountain.</p><p>Deep night, heavy snowfall.</p><p>A cloud of gloom hung over the Tian Mountain lineage.</p><p>Tian Mountain's main peak, once bustling with activity, was now guarded only by soldiers, eerily quiet.</p><p>The pale light of the lanterns hanging on the mountain cast a lonely atmosphere.</p><p>The snow fell harder, adding a thick layer in just a short while, hinting at the unrest to come.</p><p>Suddenly, a shadowy figure emerged from the darkness, briefly observing before silently moving towards the mountain's rear.</p><p>He moved with incredible lightness and speed, emitting a faint, ethereal glow.</p><p>The snowflakes encountered along his path seemed to warp momentarily upon contact with the glow, yet still fell in their original direction, leaving no trace of anomaly, even to nearby observers.</p><p>He clearly possessed mastery of an exceptionally advanced evasion technique.</p><p>Passing through a flat area, he breathed a sigh of relief, unnoticed. His figure flickered, navigating the cliffs and precipices, fleeing at breakneck speed.</p><p>He was intimately familiar with the terrain, easily avoiding other cultivators.</p><p>Just as he was about to escape this dangerous place, a voice rang out, "Daoist You, where are you going?"</p><p>His body froze, revealing an aged face beneath his cloak.</p><p>The old man turned his head with difficulty, spotting a figure standing on a nearby rock, his hands behind his back, looking down at him.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Recognizing the man, the old man's face paled.</p><p>In the past few days, he'd heard this person's name countless times; his ears were ringing.</p><p>Qingfeng Daozhang, whose real name was Qin Sang, had subdued countless top-tier demons in the Sacred Land, even defeating the Hunmo and Tianpeng!</p><p>Tong Lingyu brought back this news, and others initially dismissed it as absurd!</p><p>However, bad news travels fast. After the Sacred Land's closure, surviving demons spread the word, the news spreading like wildfire.</p><p>Gradually, Xuantian Palace gathered information from various sources, eventually confirming the truth.</p><p>Elder You, seeing Qin Sang himself in pursuit, felt fear before even engaging in battle.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the boulder, untouched by the snow, overlooking Elder You, sighing, "The Grand Elder's mercy allowed Shang Lu and his accomplices, who committed such cruel acts, to escape punishment beyond the execution of their leader.  Why flee, Daoist You? I can only send you to the Regretful Spring."</p><p>Now, he no longer needed to conceal his identity.</p><p>After teleporting back from the unnamed island, he and Tong Lingyu confronted the Xuantian lineage, revealing the previously thought-lost Luo Yun.</p><p>With the loss of two top experts and the absence of leadership, the Yin family was unable to offer any defense.</p><p>The plan proceeded smoothly.</p><p>The Yin Changsheng faction was demoted, and control of the Xuantian lineage was reclaimed.</p><p>Understanding they had incurred widespread wrath because of Yin Changsheng's actions, and that retaining their position would be unlikely if the matter were put to a vote, the Xuantian lineage opted to comply with Tong Lingyu's demands.</p><p>Though some die-hards and remnants of Yin Changsheng's faction lingered, Qin Sang and Liuli swiftly dealt with them.</p><p>Having witnessed Qin Sang's power, the Xuantian lineage dared not harbor any further dissent.</p><p>Qin Sang's gains were substantial, the most valuable being a cultivation technique and a secret art.</p><p>The technique, titled "Qingwei Records," was one of the Xuantian Palace's core inheritances – a profound and powerful method. Qin Sang intended to have his external avatar cultivate it, but needed further consideration.</p><p>The secret technique Qin Sang had been searching for was a soul-attacking spell called "Soul-摄魂真言".  Yin Dianzhu had used this very technique. Qin Sang had already learned about the "Soul-摄魂真言" from him, but to be sure, she found the original text and techniques within the Xuan Tian lineage before feeling at ease.  If Qin Sang was correct, the secret technique Yin Changsheng possessed was a modified version of the "Soul-摄魂真言," unfortunately, he hadn’t passed it on to anyone, and it was lost with his death.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang obtained various restorative pills like the Fei Xue Dan and other treasures to prepare for her trip to Zhongzhou.  Having obtained what she needed, Qin Sang swiftly dealt with Yin Dianzhu.</p><p>After handling the Xuan Tian lineage, Tong Lingyu immediately turned her attention to the Tian Shan lineage.  Their pre-arranged plan was to demote the Tian Shan branch, but their resistance was far more fierce than that of the Xuan Tian lineage.  However, the evil deeds of Shang Lu and others were undeniable facts.  Added to this, tales of Qin Sang's bravery in the stone tablet space, where she nearly slew the Hun Mo leader amidst countless demons, spread far and wide, filling people with awe and fear. These factors prevented the Tian Shan lineage from immediately resorting to desperate measures.</p><p>Tong Lingyu didn't give them a chance to unite; she swiftly employed a series of suppressive and divisive tactics, a combination of rewards and punishments, leaving the Tian Shan lineage with no choice but to submit.  Tonight was the night to purge the remaining dissenters from Tian Shan.</p><p>While Tong Lingyu and others were busy elsewhere, Qin Sang, having dealt with her opponents, arrived at the Tian Shan main peak. Tian Mudie, a butterfly spirit, detected an old man secretly entering the peak, apparently stealing something. Though a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator, he wasn't an elder or a hall master, similar to the Lu family elder who guarded the Xuan Tian Palace treasury—a recluse. His actions were unexpected.</p><p>The old man sneered, "Who is guilty and who is innocent? Isn't it up to you to decide? You speak so grandly, but Tong Lingyu is simply purging her opponents!  She's usurping power, colluding with you, a mysterious outsider, inviting wolves into the house.  You two will usurp Xuan Tian Palace and wreak havoc, its downfall is inevitable! I won't be buried with it!"</p><p>"So, Daoist You intends to steal treasures, flee, betray your sect, and start anew?"</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved. The old man's words were just as grandiloquent; ultimately, it was greed that drove him.</p><p>"In that case, I can only bring you to the Grand Elder for judgment!"</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Qin Sang summoned the demonic fire dragon, which circled above, locking onto the old man.</p><p>"Arrogant brat!"</p><p>The old man roared, his fingers extended like blades, slashing at Qin Sang.  His hand instantly froze over with ice, transforming into an icy blade.</p><p>With a flash, icy energy shot out, freezing the air with snowflakes.  Qin Sang saw a blue energy stream hurtling towards him. Just as he was about to use the demonic fire to defend, he sensed something, and the demonic fire dragon dispersed, enveloping him.</p><p>The instant the fire spread, the incoming energy rapidly dissipated, vanishing into nothingness, leaving only a gentle breeze that couldn’t touch the fire.  Simultaneously, changes occurred in nine directions around Qin Sang.  The energy had split into nine identical streams, suspended in the air, all aimed at him, their energies intertwined, sealing off his escape.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>The old man bellowed.  Nine energy streams slashed towards Qin Sang with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, a cold smile on his face, dividing his demonic fire into nine smaller dragons and activating the Ruyi Treasure Orb's protective barrier.</p><p>With a roar, the energy streams pierced the fire, leaving holes, seemingly about to pierce through.  However, Qin Sang’s skill proved superior.  The demonic fire, formless and ever-shifting, was unharmed, while the energy streams weakened and were consumed by the flames.  Any remaining force was blocked by the barrier.</p><p>The old man clearly didn't intend to kill Qin Sang with this attack.  Ignoring the front, he took out a black brush, without ink, and painted in mid-air, quickly drawing a figure that strongly resembled himself.</p><p>An old man put away his ink brush.  His form flickered, passing through the image in an instant.  Astonishingly, he entered the picture but didn't reappear on the other side; he simply vanished. Before leaving, he glanced at Qin Sang with a mocking expression.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, his phoenix wings unfurled, and he shot upwards at incredible speed. The old man's secret technique was peculiar, seemingly prepared in advance.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't instantly determine the old man's location, but he knew the elder couldn't have moved too far; otherwise, he would have left immediately after succeeding.  Furthermore, the old man's disappearance was accompanied by an undeniable energy fluctuation, revealing a flaw in his technique.</p><p>Reacting swiftly, Qin Sang ascended to a high altitude, gaining a clear view of the surrounding terrain.  His Sky-Eyed Butterfly flew from his dantian, landing on his shoulder.  Its wings spread, revealing the entire area below.  He immediately spotted an anomaly in a distant ravine – a fleeting glimmer of light.</p><p>Had Qin Sang not acted quickly, and had the Sky-Eyed Butterfly not possessed exceptional eyesight, the old man would have escaped.</p><p>On the ravine's stone wall were almost natural-looking lines, sketching a vague human figure.  Suddenly, the wall faintly glowed. The old man reappeared from the wall, walking down as his robe vibrated, quickly suppressing the energy fluctuations caused by his technique. Then, with a 'pop', his body shattered into a flurry of snowflakes.</p><p>Just as he seemed about to melt into the blizzard and escape, a sharp, rushing sound came from above. A bolt of lightning arrived in an instant, blocking the ravine's exit. The old man stiffened, turning to another direction.  Before he could react, another figure appeared—Qin Sang's clone.</p><p>"You Daoist friend, if you remain stubborn, Qin will have no choice but to resort to force…"</p><p>Qin Sang's low voice echoed behind him, accompanied by an aura that sent shivers down the old man's spine. The old man spun around, his eyes fixated on the Solar God Tree floating before Qin Sang.  The Solar God Bird was poised to strike.</p><p>The legendary treasure, spoken of in hushed whispers, was finally before the old man.  Experiencing it firsthand, he understood that the rumors had not been exaggerated. His expression shifted, before he finally snorted, grabbed his pouch, and tossed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang opened it to find a wealth of treasures, enough to sustain a sect's growth.  The old man harbored the same ambition: to establish his own sect in the vast, empty Unbounded Sea, defecting from the Xuan Tian Palace to become its founder.</p><p>"My apologies!"</p><p>Qin Sang and his clone escorted the old man back to the main peak of the Heavenly Mountain, heading straight for the Dragon-Raising Pool.  This pool, in actuality, housed snow pythons. These spirit beasts, combined with python banners, were formidable and required no direct control from their master, making them invaluable allies.</p><p>Qin Sang seized most of the snow pythons, leaving only the lowest-ranked ones.  Soon, Tong Lingyu finished the cleanup and arrived with her people.  The Heavenly Mountain lineage was completely erased.  A scramble for its treasures followed.</p><p>With different legacies, there wasn't much amongst the Heavenly Mountain's collection that appealed to Qin Sang. He chose a pill to aid cultivation, and several unique artifacts and techniques.  A happy surprise was finding the necessary herb for the Spirit-Calming Incense.  Most of the spoils were cultivation resources, ensuring a period of prosperity for the Green Sheep Temple.</p><p>As agreed, the high-grade spirit stones and restorative pills belonged to Qin Sang.  The Snow Listening Tower didn’t understand this strange request but readily delivered their share. Qin Sang further planned to acquire more to ensure there was no shortage.</p><p>The fall of Heavenly Mountain. The Xuan Tian's relinquishing of power. Tong Lingyu and Jiang, the Palace Master and Grand Elder respectively.  The Xuan Tian Palace underwent a power shift, with lingering repercussions, but these no longer concerned Qin Sang.  He requested information about the Unbounded Sea from the Xuan Tian Palace, seeking a suitable location for his sect.</p><p>At the Snow Listening Tower, Qin Sang had a plethora of jade slips and books spread before him. After a cursory review, he selected three ideal locations, preparing to bid farewell to Liuli. A streak of light sped from Lingxiao Peak and entered the Snow Listening Tower.</p><p>"Daoist friend Qin!"</p><p>The visitor, a loyal subordinate of Tong Lingyu, showed Qin Sang great respect, presenting a stone box.  "A mysterious person left this at the Seventy-Two Springs, claiming to be an old friend, offering a grand gift."</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang was surprised; he didn't have many acquaintances in the North Sea.</p><p>Taking the box, Qin Sang examined it and released the seal, revealing a tear-drop shaped object containing a blurry figure, seemingly ravaged by immense suffering and barely recognizable.  After staring for a long time, Qin Sang finally identified the figure: the Hunmo Elder.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Thank you to Su Zhemù for the generous donation!</p>
