<h1>Chapter 734: Reunion</h1><p>The closer Qin Sang got to Muyuan Island, the more alarmed he became.</p><p>The scale of the beast tide was even larger than he had imagined, and the situation ahead had already descended into chaos.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, but decided to go to Muyuan Island to assess the situation. After Jinyuan Island fell to the beast tide last time, the Qiongyu Trading Company had shifted its focus to Muyuan Island. The Wang sisters were most likely on the island.</p><p>If they were alert enough, they should have been able to detect the signs of the beast tide in advance and make preparations.</p><p>However, the people on the island didn't know how terrifying the scale of this beast tide was. If they couldn't evacuate in time, they were likely to be surrounded and killed by the ever-increasing number of demonic beasts.</p><p>On the way, some demonic beasts discovered his movements and chased after him. Fortunately, none of them were particularly powerful, and Qin Sang easily left them behind.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed on almost without pause, accompanied by the Twin-Headed Serpent. Finally, Muyuan Island came into view.</p><p>Seeing the scene on Muyuan Island from afar, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Demonic beasts covered the sky and the earth, a dark, oppressive mass, completely surrounding Muyuan Island. In the heart of the battlefield, besides the rising and falling roars of beasts, there were also bursts of shouts and battle cries. Many cultivators were trapped.</p><p>Qin Sang, riding the Twin-Headed Serpent, cautiously approached the island. Arriving at the edge of the battlefield, he saw strange-shaped sea beasts in front, like a swarm of ants.</p><p>These sea beasts were fearless, though their cultivation levels weren't high.  Facing so many of them, even Qin Sang felt his scalp tingle.</p><p>"Boom! Boom!"</p><p>Rumbling sounds came from the beast tide. Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw several Foundation Establishment cultivators working together to control a shuttle-shaped artifact, struggling to break through.</p><p>Two men and two women, all at the late Foundation Establishment stage.  The shuttle artifact was quite unique, allowing four people to control it simultaneously, unleashing formidable power.</p><p>Each charge could reap a large swathe of demonic beasts.</p><p>They were close to breaking through the encirclement, but the demonic beasts kept replenishing their ranks, preventing them from covering that final distance.</p><p>To make matters worse, controlling the shuttle consumed a great deal of their energy. Two of them were pale, their bodies swaying, seemingly unable to hold on much longer.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang gave instructions to the Twin-Headed Serpent.  Man and beast surged forward with increased speed.</p><p>After reaching the outer edge of the battlefield, the Twin-Headed Serpent flicked its tail.  A storm erupted from its vertical pupils, sweeping outwards. The sea beasts were easily torn apart by the storm, perishing one after another.</p><p>"A Nascent Soul demonic beast!"</p><p>The four cultivators, seeing the storm rushing towards them and sensing its power, revealed expressions of despair.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the storm was about to reach them, it dissipated.  Immediately afterwards, a sword beam shot out from the storm like a swimming dragon.</p><p>As the four watched in shock, the sword beam flashed, decapitating the surrounding demonic beasts.</p><p>They immediately realized they had encountered a savior.  Overjoyed, they ran outwards with all their might.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for saving our lives!"</p><p>Having finally escaped, the four, still shaken, hurriedly bowed to Qin Sang, their faces filled with gratitude.</p><p>"Is this Senior's spirit beast?"</p><p>A woman asked, staring at the Twin-Headed Serpent with a look of awe.</p><p>Then, seeing the Twin-Headed Serpent lower its head obediently, she realized that such a powerful demonic beast had been tamed by Qin Sang.  Her impression of Qin Sang rose another notch.</p><p>So much time had passed since the theft of the Heavenly Fire, and with no news from Huntian Island, there was no need to conceal the Twin-Headed Serpent any longer.</p><p>"What's going on? Why are so many people trapped on the island? Wasn't there a warning before the beast tide arrived?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked in a deep voice, inquiring about the situation on the island.</p><p>At this point, the beast tide's attention was drawn to them, and they began to attack. Qin Sang summoned the Flying Night Devil, ordering it and the Twin-Headed Serpent to hold off the enemy.</p><p>Facing the overwhelming beast tide, the four cultivators were pale, but they didn't dare to leave without permission, honestly answering Qin Sang's questions.</p><p>"Reporting to Senior, initially, someone did discover signs of the beast tide. However, just as the news arrived, a group of Nascent Soul demonic beasts suddenly appeared on the island, fiercely attacking the defensive formation. Caught off guard, the formation didn't last long before it was breached. The island immediately fell into chaos. Everyone could only fight for themselves. Many, like us, couldn't evacuate in time before the beast tide arrived..."</p><p>After learning about the situation, Qin Sang thought to himself, "No wonder."</p><p>The cultivators of the Five Element Islands had no intention of resisting the beast tide.  The formations they set up were only meant as temporary measures.  The leaders of this beast tide were highly intelligent, having figured out the cultivators' weakness.</p><p>"Did you see anyone from the East Pole Alliance when you left the city?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked further.</p><p>Faced with this natural disaster, the various trading companies of the East Pole Alliance would certainly gather together first.  He wondered if they had managed to break through.</p><p>The four looked at each other. One woman hesitantly said, "Reporting to Senior, when this junior left the city, I seemed to see the two Manager Wangs heading in that direction. I haven't seen them since."</p><p>The others also shook their heads.</p><p>The Wang sisters, managing the Qiongyu Trading Company on his behalf, were quite famous. Most of the cultivators on the Five Element Islands recognized them, regarding them as goddesses of fortune.</p><p>Three years ago, Wang Xiang successfully formed her Nascent Soul.</p><p>Speaking of which, Wang Xiang's Nascent Soul formation was also due to luck. Qin Sang used his connections to help them purchase high-grade Demonic Slaying Pills. Wang Xiang had failed even after taking several.</p><p>With the demonic energy in her body nearing its limit, she could only take one more.  Fortunately, she succeeded.  For a time, the two sisters, both having formed their Nascent Soul, were the talk of the town.</p><p>Looking in the direction the woman pointed, Qin Sang's heart sank. That was precisely the direction from which the beast tide came, countless demonic beasts surging forward relentlessly.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, speeding off.</p><p>The four didn't dare to linger, hurrying to leave.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to rush in alone, ordering the Twin-Headed Serpent to search through the horde. The Twin-Headed Serpent moved like a phantom, and after a thorough search, finally found the Wang sisters, along with some cultivators from other trading companies of the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>They were trapped by the demonic beasts, looking quite disheveled, having already lost a number of their people.</p><p>Fortunately, both Wang sisters had broken through to the Nascent Soul stage, otherwise their fate would likely have been far worse.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Twin-Headed Serpent, having pushed aside a giant sea beast, appeared before them. It let out a low roar, gesturing for them to follow, then its figure flickered, splitting into six, turning to face the beast tide, baring its fangs.</p><p>"It's the Daoist Priest's spirit beast!"</p><p>The Wang sisters, seeing the Twin-Headed Serpent, had their weary expressions instantly replaced with joy. They shouted loudly.</p><p>"The Daoist Priest has come to save us! Follow it!"</p><p>In an instant, everyone's morale soared, following the Twin-Headed Serpent as it charged forward.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also appeared at the edge of the beast tide, summoning the Ten Yama Banners and unleashing demonic fire to meet them.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a long dragon, sweeping everything before it.  The path between the two groups was cleared, and they saw each other.</p><p>"Daoist Priest..."</p><p>Wang Xiang waved and jumped, her voice clear. Wang Shi's face was also filled with joy.</p><p>Reuniting amidst the beast tide, everyone felt somewhat dazed.  They had thought most of them would die here, but unexpectedly, they had escaped death, giving them a sense of unreality.</p>
