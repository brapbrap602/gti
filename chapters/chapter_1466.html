第一千四百五十八章 Nine Underworlds Return to Yin (4k, Two-in-One)

Xuantian Palace actually possesses a Spiritual Treasure!
Qin Sang recalled the sword embryo of the Xuling Sect, as well as his own Wandering Sword.
The difference in foundation between the Xuling Sect and Xuantian Palace cannot be measured by reason. Starting from the founder, generations schemed, until Binghan, they finally had the opportunity to refine the fire jade nurtured in the mountain within a mountain into a sword embryo.
Whether it can eventually give birth to spirituality and advance to a Spiritual Treasure, the duration of the entire process is still uncertain.
The Wandering Sword has successively fused the Blood Mulberry of No Interstice, Soul-Nurturing Wood, and the true spirit of Clear Blessing Bamboo. As Qin Sang's Natal Sword, it has been nourished by his Nascent Soul for decades, yet there are no signs of transformation.
The time stretches endlessly.
To be pessimistic, Qin Sang even wonders if he will face the Spirit Transformation bottleneck first, or the Wandering Sword will advance to a Spiritual Treasure first.
From this, it can be seen how difficult it is for a Nascent Soul cultivator to refine a Spiritual Treasure.
That Grand Elder is only in the middle stage of Nascent Soul, so it can be basically confirmed that the Spiritual Treasure was not refined by him personally, but is a inherited Spiritual Treasure of Xuantian Palace.
Qin Sang doesn't understand the rules of Xuantian Palace, and doesn't know why the inherited Spiritual Treasure was handed over to the Grand Elder instead of the Palace Lord.
"What are the magical powers of that Spiritual Treasure?"
Qin Sang asked thoughtfully.
He was sorting out the treasures he possessed.
The Wandering Sword cannot be relied on for the time being.
The changes in the Sun God Tree are gratifying. Especially after his Divine Sense took form, Qin Sang discovered that he could also exert some influence. The speed at which the flames of the flower buds gathered seemed to be faster, and the color became more profound, so there is cause for anticipation.
The power and rank of the Southern Bright Li Fire are beyond doubt.
But like the Demonic Fire sealed in the Demon Banner, Qin Sang can only control the Sun Divine Bird, which contains only a portion of the Southern Bright Li Fire's power.
How strong the Sun Divine Bird will be after it takes shape, and whether it can reach the level of a Spiritual Treasure, is still a big question mark.
The only things that can be roughly assessed are the Demon Banner and the Nine Underworlds Demonic Fire.
The Eighteen Demon Banners are superior to top-grade magic treasures, which is why Qin Sang was not at a disadvantage when he used the Demon Banners to fight against Old Demon Hunmo.
However, the main body of the Nine Underworlds Demonic Fire is sealed in the Demon Banner, which is not its true power. When he uses the 'Golden Lotus of Fire Seed' to refine all the Demonic Fire, even after refinement and some loss, it should be a magical power no weaker than a Spiritual Treasure.
But this takes time and cannot be accomplished overnight.
Come to think of it, before condensing the Sun Divine Bird, he really doesn't have any good means to deal with Spiritual Treasures.
Qin Sang quickly went through everything in his mind, only to see Liuli looking at him, without saying a word.
Seeing this, Qin Sang suddenly understood.
Liuli, after all, came from Xuantian Palace, and it is impossible for her to reveal all the secrets of her sect. This reminder is enough, and he should be more vigilant when encountering the Grand Elder of Xuantian Palace in the future.
Qin Sang thought for a while and said with a smile: "Thank you, Fairy, for your painstaking efforts in explaining the pros and cons. I already understand that possessing the Sacred Object does more harm than good. I wonder how much Xuantian Palace intends to pay to get the Sacred Object back?"
"What do you want?"
Liuli asked back.
She was not surprised by Qin Sang's request, and was also very clear that her and Qin Sang's grievances on the surface have been cleared. It is impossible to ask Qin Sang to return the Sacred Object for free.
Even now, Liuli's mood is still extremely complicated, but she hasn't shown it. Ever since her master disappeared and she was alone in Shaohua Mountain, she has become accustomed to suppressing her emotions.
On the one hand, the aftereffects of the evil art have not been eliminated.
Shi Xue's words are close to some of the facts.
Back then, when Liuli left the Northern Chen Domain and returned to Xuantian Palace, cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light was to use the Ice Soul to seal off emotions and get rid of the influence of the evil art.
Silver Needle Locks Emotions, Ice Soul Seals Emotions.
From beginning to end, she has been relying on her own strength, trying to find a solution.
She believes that this is the price she must pay for choosing the evil art, and it has nothing to do with Qin Sang. She doesn't want to involve others, so she has never been bewitched by Dongyang Bo to cultivate the so-called Stone Bridge Meditation.
But when Qin Sang truly appeared in front of her, she was shocked to realize that the influence of the evil art was so deep!
On the other hand, after seeing Qin Sang, she couldn't help but think of her experiences in Shaohua Mountain.
Back then, he was like an ant, and she could crush him with a finger. Now his cultivation has surpassed her, and he has grown into a top powerhouse that Xuantian Palace is afraid of. They have to suppress other thoughts and seek a transaction.
Five Elements Spiritual Root.
Selling oneself to establish a foundation.
Cultivating the method of nourishing the sword with the Nascent Soul, and cutting the Divine Soul.
Successively taking Kanli Golden Elixir, Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower, two failures in forming the core, Dongyang Bo was helpless, and painstakingly found a reasonable excuse to bring Qin Sang into the Bronze Palace.
…
Leaving the ZIwei Palace, she searched everywhere for Qin Sang, wanting to tell him not to worry about his grievances with Dongyang Bo, and to cultivate with peace of mind, and she would bear it all alone.
In this process, she learned about some of Qin Sang's deeds, shocked by his efforts to seek the Great Dao, and the hardships he had experienced.
She believes this is not all.
It is hard to imagine what this person has experienced after being schemed against by the founder and abandoned by his sect?
How did he form his core? How did he gather his Nascent Soul? How did he step by step get to where he is today?
Compared with Qin Sang, she is undoubtedly a proud daughter of heaven. The efforts she made to save her master and the difficulties she experienced are not worth mentioning.
At least, she has the ability to find and try various ways to solve hidden dangers, while Qin Sang could only seize every straw, relying on a tenacity, unyielding, and striving to climb.
…
Qin Sang couldn't guess that the ice-cold fairy in front of him had so many thoughts.
He thought to himself, his original main goal was the map of Central Continent, and other conditions would be discussed as appropriate. Hearing that the Sacred Object was the key to opening the Holy Land, he had new ideas.
His original intention of leaving the Northern Chen Domain and traveling abroad was to find other fragments of the Killing Sword.
After arriving in the North Sea, he didn't hear of any ancient secret realms or relics here. The Pure Sea Sect is actually just a powerful Buddhist sect of recent times.
It sounds like the Holy Land of Xuantian Palace is quite mysterious, and perhaps he can find something in it.
Qin Sang proposed to enter the Holy Land for observation, and asked: "Can Xuantian Palace agree to this condition?"
He knows the importance of the Holy Land to a sect, and it is generally impossible to allow outsiders to enter. But now the key is in his hands, so they might as well not go in.
Liuli was stunned for a moment, obviously she didn't expect him to make such a request, and remained silent for a long time, "There is no precedent."
After a pause, she added, "I will ask the Grand Elder."
Qin Sang nodded slightly, thought for a while, and said cautiously: "My Dao is completely different from your Xuantian Palace. Those secrets in the Holy Land are not tempting to me. I will not do things that harm others and benefit myself. I mainly want to broaden my horizons, and it is enough to have the opportunity to observe the ceremony on the periphery of the Holy Land. If you are not at ease, I can first make an oath with a Demonic Heart."
As long as he enters the Holy Land, he can sense the Killing Sword fragments through the sword spirit.
If there are Killing Sword fragments in the Holy Land, then Xuantian Palace will have no choice but to agree. He must find a way to get it no matter what. Of course, it would be best to resolve it properly.
Liuli nodded noncommittally.
She continued to look at Qin Sang, knowing that this couldn't be his only condition.
Qin Sang had a plan in mind, "I also want a map to Central Continent."
"Central Continent?"
Liuli's eyes showed confusion.
Seeing this, Qin Sang was surprised and hurriedly asked: "Haven't you heard of Central Continent?"
Liuli nodded and said sincerely: "I don't know."
"This…"
Qin Sang frowned.
With Liuli's identity and strength, her status in Xuantian Palace must not be too low, and she is qualified to access most of the secrets, but she doesn't know about Central Continent!
Even if she is not yet qualified to view the map, she still has a mysterious master, so it is impossible for her to have never heard of it.
Qin Sang suddenly realized a problem.
He heard that after Ghost Mother sneaked into Xuantian Palace, he defaulted that Xuantian Palace must have a map to Central Continent.
Could it be that Ghost Mother was just guessing at the beginning, and after sneaking in and seeing that Xuantian Palace really didn't have one, she risked entering the Pure Sea Sect?
This is what Qin Sang didn't expect.
As the number one sect in the North Sea, Xuantian Palace doesn't have a map, so where else can he find it? The map of the Pure Sea Sect has been taken away by the Ghost Mother, unless he visits a force more ancient than Xuantian Palace.
Qin Sang didn't explain anything, "Tell the Grand Elder my words verbatim, she should know what I'm talking about."
Liuli didn't ask any more questions and silently remembered it.
Next, Qin Sang fell into a long period of thought. The spirit materials for the Gold Sinking Sword were basically gathered, and there were still two spirit objects missing for the Spirit Ascension Sacrifice, but they could be collected through Hundred Flower Valley.
It seems that there is really nothing too urgent.
If possible, Qin Sang would rather enter the treasure house of Xuantian Palace and choose himself.
Liuli remained quiet, without the slightest expression of impatience.
At this time, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something, "Does Xuantian Palace have a secret method to cultivate an External Avatar, passed down from the orthodox Profound Sect?"
Almost every Nascent Soul cultivator has thought about cultivating an External Avatar or a Second Nascent Soul, but this kind of secret method is very rare.
Moreover, most of them come from the path of demons, which are harmful to heaven and have endless hidden dangers. Although the orthodox Profound Sect's hidden dangers are smaller, the requirements are extremely harsh, and very few have truly succeeded in refining it.
Liuli was not surprised by this request.
Her eyes narrowed slightly, as if recalling.
After a while, Liuli really thought of a secret method that met Qin Sang's requirements. In Qin Sang's surprised gaze, she nodded and said: "Yes! Nine Underworlds Return to Yin Jade Scroll!"
"Nine Underworlds Return to Yin…"
Qin Sang tasted it, but couldn't see anything from the name.
Liuli carefully recalled it again and said: "The 'Nine Underworlds Return to Yin Jade Scroll' is extremely difficult to cultivate, and there are three requirements. First, the main body must have a strong Divine Sense, otherwise the last two steps will be difficult to succeed."
She paused and glanced at Qin Sang, obviously Qin Sang didn't have to worry about this.
"Secondly, a unique spirit body must be refined using special methods and placed in the underground Yin vein for eighty-one days of sacrifice. It is possible to take shortcuts using the corpses of demon beasts, but as far as I know, only a few special humanoid monsters can meet the requirements, and they are difficult to encounter in this world. Thirdly, rare treasures of the ice-cold path must be used to build the foundation for the spirit body before it can be refined into an External Avatar."
Truly harsh!
After listening to Liuli's introduction of all the requirements, Qin Sang sighed secretly.
The current cultivation world is barren, and it is basically impossible to refine a spirit body by itself. Those few demon beasts that can be used as substitutes have already become extinct in the North Sea. Perhaps there is still a chance to encounter them in the Demon Sea, but he can't go back.
"Bai once said that the Dao Evolution Tree is a heaven and earth spirit fetus, which is much stronger than a spirit body refined by humans. But the Dao Evolution Tree is a flawless body and has been polluted. Can it still be used to cultivate the 'Nine Underworlds Return to Yin Dharma Body'? This secret technique clearly belongs to the ice-cold path, which is very extreme…"
Qin Sang was a little unsure.
Even if he sees the secret technique, he may not be able to confirm whether it is feasible, and he can only know after trying it.
The potential of the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet as a puppet is basically exhausted.
Its strength, which is close to the middle stage of the Nascent Soul, is gradually falling behind his pace, and it is time to put the External Avatar on the agenda. It's just that he doesn't know if the Dao Evolution Tree can withstand the torment.
As for the rare treasure of the ice-cold path, Qin Sang is not worried, Xuantian Palace must have it.
"What are the magical powers of the External Avatar, and what are the hidden dangers?"
Out of caution, Qin Sang asked in detail.
Liuli has obviously also thought about refining an External Avatar, and knows this secret technique very well, "After the External Avatar is refined, it can display several magical powers of the ice-cold path, and control magic weapons. Its combat power is not weak. However, it will not condense a Second Nascent Soul by itself, but will condense a phantom Nascent Soul. Compared with the Demonic Dao Blood Infant, Demonic Infant and other secret techniques, the probability of backlash against the main body is very small."
Qin Sang did not interrupt, and listened attentively, wondering what kind of phantom method it was.
"After the main body falls, as long as it is not too far away from the External Avatar, it can be resurrected through the External Avatar, and the phantom Nascent Soul will turn into a solid one and transform into the main body."
When talking about these things, a trace of anticipation flashed in Liuli's eyes.
This is equivalent to a second life, who wouldn't be tempted?
"Worthy of being an orthodox secret technique of the Profound Sect!"
Qin Sang's heart shook, and he can't say that he will always be smooth sailing now. The opportunity to be resurrected once is very attractive to him.
But he was not overwhelmed, "There must be some hidden dangers, right?"
"Definitely!"
Liuli nodded, "After all, the spirit body is not the real body, and it is inevitable that there will be estrangement and many disharmonies. In addition, after resurrection, one can only cultivate the ice-cold path of cultivation."
Qin Sang listened and nodded.
These hidden dangers are much smaller than he expected. Compared with the heaven-defying supernatural power of resurrection, they are not worth mentioning.
Seeing that Qin Sang was silent for a long time, looking quite tempted, Liuli hesitated and said: "I am restricted by sect rules and cannot teach you the secret technique. But if you can refine the spirit body, I can give you a kind of rare treasure that is most suitable, and whether the foundation is stable or not is related to the future potential of the External Avatar."
Qin Sang was stunned when he heard this, and didn't expect her to take the initiative to give him a rare treasure. It seems that her plans are not small.
Staring at Liuli for a moment, Qin Sang asked: "What kind of rare treasure is the best?"
"Xuantian Palace treasures Kan Sea Spirit Pearls that are suitable for cultivating the Nine Underworlds Return to Yin Jade Scroll. Because this item is rare and can assist in cultivating another technique, a great contribution is required to exchange for it. However, the effect of the Kan Sea Spirit Pearl is not as good as another."
Liuli slowly spat out four words, "Ice Soul Divine Astral!"
Following the Azure Sun Divine Astral of the Azure Yang Demonic Sect and the Pure Yang Divine Astral of the Pure Yang Sect, this is the third type of Qian Heaven Divine Astral Qin Sang has heard of.
Of course, he knows how rare the Qian Heaven Divine Astral is. First, there must be a Qian Heaven Divine Astral descending into the world, and through various coincidences, it condenses into a Astral Essence like Gang Jade, and exists for a long time.
Liuli actually has Ice Soul Divine Astral in her hand!
"Ice Soul Divine Astral is the coldest thing in the world, but its power is too violent, lacking gentleness, and difficult to control. However, with your strong Divine Sense, you should be able to barely do it."
After a pause, Liuli added, "This does not affect you asking Xuantian Palace for Kan Sea Spirit Pearls. Even if this item is precious, the Grand Elder will not be stingy. Let the External Avatar refine it to strengthen its strength."
"I didn't expect Fairy to have such a treasure!"
Qin Sang sighed, and simply went straight to the point, "I don't accept rewards for no merit. What can I do for Fairy?"
