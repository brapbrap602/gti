<h1>Chapter 1665: Strange Fragrance</h1><p>Death Seal, Heavenly Thunder, Magnetic Light.</p><p>Any one of these three attacks, if used against an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator, would most likely kill them instantly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin had reached the pinnacle of body refinement. Within the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light, Dharma cultivators were far more restricted than he was. Many magical treasures and divine abilities were either unusable or would be affected by the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic force, easily deviating from their intended direction and losing much of their power.</p><p>He dared to seize the treasures while facing the Death Seal and Heavenly Thunder because he possessed immense confidence, believing he could handle any situation.</p><p>But he didn't anticipate a third person lurking in the shadows, hidden so perfectly.</p><p>With all three attacks striking him at once, Master Huaiyin's Arhat Golden Body, though powerful, couldn't withstand them.  The Golden Body shattered instantly. Kundao had been waiting for this opportunity, how could she miss it? She seized the opening, her attack finding its mark!</p><p>Feeling the sticky blood on her palm, Kundao's eyes and brows curved in a smile.</p><p>In Kundao's eyes, Master Huaiyin's vigorous lifeblood was even more alluring than his Nascent Soul.</p><p>However, Kundao's triumph didn't last long. Her prey didn't lose the ability to resist as she expected, dying on the spot and becoming hers to slaughter.</p><p>At this moment, Kundao had already channeled the Magnetic Light through Master Huaiyin's wounds, penetrating his internal organs. She was about to detonate the Magnetic Light and completely shatter his viscera.</p><p>"What vile fiend!"</p><p>A furious roar suddenly echoed.</p><p>The roar contained a soul-shaking power.</p><p>This was the Heavenly Dragon Chant, a secret and profound Buddhist art. The chanting resonated like thunder, capable of daunting all enemies. Used by Master Huaiyin, empowered by his lifeblood, its power was especially terrifying.</p><p>Those with weaker minds would have their Primordial Spirits shaken and their hearts shattered on the spot.</p><p>Kundao stiffened slightly.</p><p>Master Huaiyin had turned his head at some point, facing Kundao. His tongue chanted Buddhist scriptures, and the Buddhist light in his eyes, fueled by rage, radiated a terrifying killing intent.</p><p>At this moment, dazzling Buddhist light surrounded Master Huaiyin.  The fragments of his shattered Arhat Golden Body didn't disperse, but instead reassembled, transforming back into a golden dragon of lifeblood, aiding him in unleashing this Heavenly Dragon Chant.</p><p>The golden dragon of lifeblood merged with the chant, forming tangible sound waves.</p><p>In contrast, Master Huaiyin himself appeared withered and near death.</p><p>His Golden Body was shattered, his internal organs damaged, and his body gravely wounded.  Forcibly using the Heavenly Dragon Chant in this state further depleted his lifeblood, leaving him at the end of his rope.</p><p>The chant clearly couldn't subdue Kundao, only buying him a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Master Huaiyin's outstretched right hand still hadn't retracted, resolutely grabbing at the cluster of fragments, while his left hand returned to his chest.</p><p>His fingers curled inward, forming a single-handed seal.</p><p>Kundao shook her head to clear the impact of the chant and, seeing that Master Huaiyin was still fixated on the treasures, inwardly scoffed at his recklessness.  Just as she was about to kill him, she felt the arm she had plunged into Master Huaiyin's body suddenly constricted.</p><p>An astonishing force erupted from within Master Huaiyin, forcing all the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light within him back towards her.</p><p>Kundao felt the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light compress around her palm, unable to harm Master Huaiyin in the slightest. Moreover, the force grew increasingly fierce, as if it would blast her away.</p><p>Even more shockingly, a golden light flowed from the hand seal across Master Huaiyin's skin, and his aura surged at a visible rate, despite his near-death state.</p><p>This golden light emanated from his hand seal.</p><p>Wherever the golden light touched, it was as if misfortune had turned to fortune.  A rumbling thunderous sound echoed from Master Huaiyin's meridians, the color returned to his face, the golden dragon of lifeblood re-formed, and the Arhat Golden Body reappeared!</p><p>In an instant, Master Huaiyin almost returned to his peak state. If not for the alarming wound on his back, no one would have guessed that he had just been gravely injured and nearly perished.</p><p>"Vile fiend, die!"</p><p>Master Huaiyin roared again.</p><p>This wasn't the Heavenly Dragon Chant, but his voice was full of vigor.</p><p>The Arhat Golden Body, with lowered brows, swung a palm towards Kundao's crown.  Golden dragons coiled around the Arhat's arm, leaving circular golden ripples in its wake. The palm stirred a terrifying storm, scattering the Magnetic Light and threatening to shatter the void itself.</p><p>Kundao was at the center of the storm, her delicate wrist still embedded in Master Huaiyin's wound. If she didn't retreat, she would have to endure this palm strike from the Arhat Golden Body.</p><p>In less than a breath, the situation had undergone dramatic changes, dazzling and confusing.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan were both astonished.</p><p>Astonished by the sudden appearance of the attacker, and also astonished by Master Huaiyin's powerful divine ability.</p><p>The attacker's concealment was flawless, and her timing impeccable, clearly a long-planned ambush. If it were them, they might not have escaped this calamity.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a chill. If not for the Fire Jade Centipede's warning, he would have been the one ambushed.</p><p>Master Huaiyin had inadvertently shielded him from disaster.</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, his Heavenly Eye divine ability pierced through the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Kundao's attire and was immediately drawn to something at her waist.</p><p>It was a fiery red jade pendant, with what appeared to be molten lava flowing within. It was identical to the jade pendant in the Bingyi Palace tribulation vision, and the Fire Jade Centipede's reaction confirmed that it was indeed attracted to this pendant.</p><p>"Crimson Immortal Pendant!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted, his eyes brightening, and his thoughts surged. Without hesitation, he once more cast the Thunder Chant and Soul-Capturing Mantra.</p><p>In fact, he had already planned this.</p><p>It was the same attack as before, only the target had changed to Kundao.</p><p>Master Huaiyin came from the Western Lands and had few enemies in the Middle Continent.  Kundao's unhesitating attack indicated a ruthless and indiscriminate killer.</p><p>Kundao had spied on him several times, clearly harboring ill intentions. Even without the Crimson Immortal Pendant, Qin Sang wouldn't have shown mercy.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was also speculating about Kundao's origins.</p><p>Since entering the Formless Immortal Sect, he had never seen this woman, and Qi Ling Dongzhu's remnant soul held no related memories.</p><p>However, Kundao's various actions provided clues for speculation.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that the Star Pavilion explosion and the appearance of the ancient cultivator's legacy were this woman's doing.</p><p>This woman could conceal herself using the divine restrictions and manipulate the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light, but her control was definitely limited. Otherwise, there would be no need for such elaborate schemes; directly controlling the divine restrictions would be enough to put them all in danger.</p><p>"Is she Zhu Wudao's accomplice?"</p><p>Qin Sang considered a possibility.</p><p>It was reasonable for Zhu Wudao to bring in a group of demons and monsters and have a backup plan against Qi Ling Dongzhu and the others, guarding against their betrayal.</p><p>Additionally, in Qi Ling Dongzhu's memories, Zhu Wudao had mentioned many Formless Immortal Sect descendants hiding in the shadows, some secretly watching them. However, they were constantly hunted by other forces and were too afraid to reveal their identities.</p><p>Now that the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy had appeared, those forces were likely restless as well.</p><p>It wouldn't be strange for these people, possessing treasures from the Formless Immortal Sect's inheritance, to move freely within Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>In an instant, various thoughts flashed through his mind, not affecting Qin Sang's judgment and actions.</p><p>As he attacked, Qin Sang reversed his retreating momentum.  With a powerful flap of his phoenix wings, he left a black fire trail in the void, charging back.</p><p>As Qin Sang advanced, Master Huaiyin, multitasking, had already reached into the cluster of fragments.</p><p>Before the ambush, Master Huaiyin had intended to sweep away all the treasures.  With Poison King arriving shortly after, he could have retreated unscathed even after enduring a combined attack from Qin Sang and Su Zinan.</p><p>If the female cultivator's relics contained information about Emperor Bestowal Mountain, it could prove useful in cornering the strange-faced man.</p><p>Although he had obtained the more precious Xin Metal Essence, which could replace the spiritual object he was searching for, his agreement with Poison King still stood.  Moreover, obtaining this opportunity was partly due to Poison King, so he couldn't simply break his promise.</p><p>Now, gravely injured, Master Huaiyin didn't dare to be arrogant and had to make a choice.</p><p>Master Huaiyin gathered the golden light in his palm, capturing only the Xin Metal Essence, and vibrated his arm powerfully, sending the other treasures flying away to avoid further attacks.</p><p>Some of the treasures were destroyed in the explosion.</p><p>Only a few remained.</p><p>Among them were four swords: two long swords, one of which had been resting on the female cultivator's lap and was presumably her personal sword, and two smaller swords, one gold and one jade, each the size of a finger.</p><p>The small spirit swords had no scabbards, and their shape resembled sword talismans.</p><p>There was also a black jade box with a seal, its light flickering continuously, clearly due to the intense impact it had endured.</p><p>Qin Sang was focused on the jade pendant at Kundao's waist, glancing at the treasures but not changing his target.</p><p>However, Su Zinan, whose eyesight was inferior to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, had his vision and perception blocked by the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light surrounding Master Huaiyin.  He could only see Kundao's blurry figure and hadn't yet noticed the Fire Rhinoceros Horn.</p><p>Just as he was filled with uncertainty, he saw the treasures being flung away by Master Huaiyin and his expression shifted slightly.</p><p>Su Zinan's figure flickered as he advanced, gathering the remaining power of the Death Seal and heading straight for Kundao.  His thoughts were similar to Qin Sang's: Kundao's origins were unknown, and capturing her alive would be valuable.</p><p>However, Su Zinan was more adept at reaping the benefits and appeared to be aiming for the treasures.</p><p>A faint mist constantly surrounded him, a manifestation of the two main souls of the Demonic Banner, resisting the Nine Heavens Geomagnetism.</p><p>As long as the main souls didn't detach from him, his disguise wouldn't be exposed. Even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly hadn't noticed, mistaking it for Su Zinan's protective magical treasure.</p><p>For a moment, the four converged, and a chaotic battle was about to erupt.</p><p>Heavenly Thunder descended once more.</p><p>Master Huaiyin instinctively defended, but was surprised to find it aimed at Kundao. Unable to fathom why Qin Sang was assisting him, he simply dismissed the thought.  The golden palm of the Arhat descended, generating thick golden罡 wind.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Locked onto by the Heavenly Thunder and Buddha's palm, Kundao appeared surprisingly frail. The Heavenly Dragon Chant and Soul-Capturing Mantra followed close behind, further shaking her mind.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang summoned the Sun God Tree.</p><p>Within the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light, the Sun God Birds were prone to losing control and deviating from their course. He had to wait until he was closer before unleashing them.</p><p>Though it sounded complicated, Qin Sang and Master Huaiyin reacted incredibly swiftly, giving Kundao almost no respite.</p><p>Just as Kundao was about to have her skull crushed…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly saw Kundao retract her arm, spread her hands wide, close her eyes, and open her mouth in a piercing scream.  The scream was so shrill that even through the Nine Heavens Geomagnetism, Qin Sang felt as if needles were piercing his eardrums.</p><p>Outside the battlefield.</p><p>Poison King was almost there.  Faintly hearing the woman's shriek, his expression turned grave.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's two roars, coupled with this shriek, indicated an unforeseen change.  Poison King had confidence in Master Huaiyin's strength, but these sounds made him uneasy.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn't adept at dealing with the Nine Heavens Geomagnetism and had fallen behind.</p><p>Thinking of this, Poison King didn't hesitate. He flicked his sleeve, muttered an incantation, completed a hand seal, and extended his index finger.</p><p>A black thread shot out from his sleeve.  Poison King's finger traced along one end of the thread, conjuring a black demonic wind that pierced through layers of Nine Heavens Geomagnetism and rushed towards the battlefield.</p><p>Poison King's gaze was solemn, his speed significantly slowing as he remotely controlled the Gu insect through his mind.</p><p>Hearing the scream, Qin Sang's heart sank.  He then saw the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light around Kundao frantically converge, forming a yellow-black pillar of light that shot upwards, directly confronting the giant palm of the Arhat Golden Body.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kundao's hasty action wasn't perfect. The protective Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light around her thinned, unable to block the Heavenly Thunder and Death Seal.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Amidst the thunderclap, the giant palm was obstructed, but the Heavenly Thunder and Death Seal pierced through the Nine Heavens Geomagnetism, striking Kundao almost simultaneously.</p><p>Surprisingly, Kundao didn't die instantly from these attacks.  Her injuries were far less severe than Qin Sang had anticipated.</p><p>A grayish mist had appeared around Kundao's body at some point.  This mist resembled chaos and clashed with the Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light.</p><p>With Kundao's scream, the mist swelled rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, the space around her began to tremble, becoming extremely unstable. The surrounding Nine Heavens Geomagnetic Divine Light shattered, and Master Huaiyin's gaze turned serious, sensing danger.</p><p>His recovery using the secret technique was already difficult and couldn't be maintained for long.  Having obtained the Xin Metal Essence, he intended to retreat.  Seeing Kundao pushed back, he decisively withdrew.</p><p>Kundao's shoulder, struck by lightning, was torn open, her blood vaporized by the thunderous force.</p><p>Her chest was struck by the Death Seal, the character 'death' clearly imprinted on her body. The vital essence within her was drawn towards the Death Seal by an unknown force.</p><p>However, these injuries weren't fatal, seemingly mitigated by the mist.</p><p>As space and the divine restrictions trembled, Kundao's figure became increasingly ethereal.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately understood: Kundao was escaping!</p><p>To his disappointment, Master Huaiyin chose to retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his palm, the Sun God Tree reappearing, slowly rotating in his palm.  The three divine birds on it flapped their wings, about to take flight.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Kundao was faster.  The mist surged like an ocean from an unknown space, cracking the void and creating fissures.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others knew that these weren't spatial rifts, but gaps in the divine restrictions.</p><p>The other side of the fissures should be the exit they had been desperately seeking, but none of them wanted to enter now.</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>The fissures rapidly spread, quickly surrounding Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Su Zinan finally saw Kundao's face clearly, his eyes widening: "Fire Rhinoceros Horn!"</p><p>He finally understood why Qin Sang had so decisively attacked Kundao.  It was the treasure that attracted him.  Without hesitation, he lunged towards Kundao.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan advanced, while Master Huaiyin retreated further, showing no reluctance.</p><p>Just then, a strange hissing wind sound came from afar.  A demonic wind rushed over, with faintly visible black threads within it.</p><p>Poison King had finally arrived!</p><p>Master Huaiyin's mind eased, and he hurriedly rushed towards the demonic wind, indeed seeing Poison King following behind.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>Seeing the wounds on Master Huaiyin, Poison King was shocked.</p><p>Master Huaiyin exhaled softly, his breath ragged, and sighed, "Forgive this poor monk for being unable to continue journeying with you, fellow Daoist."</p>
