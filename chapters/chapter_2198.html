<h1>Chapter 2188: A Promise</h1><p>The beast horde was almost upon them.</p><p>Leading the charge was a Golden Spiral Turtle, its shell gleaming like gold, its body the size of a small hill. The sheer momentum of its advance was terrifying.</p><p>“Elder Brother, let me handle this!”</p><p>Yuan Ren stepped forward, shrugged his shoulders, raised his right arm, and a purple-gold light emanated from his palm.</p><p>A long purple-gold staff materialized in his hand.  His eyes flashed with purple light, his joints crackled, and with a low growl, he swung the staff with one arm, smashing it into the horde.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The staff tip erupted with intense purple-gold energy, transforming into a colossal pillar, unstoppable in its force.</p><p>The Golden Spiral Turtle, leading the charge, was the first to be struck. Its massive body was sent tumbling, pinned by the staff and slammed into the rest of the horde.</p><p>In ancient times, the Golden Spiral Turtle was renowned for its immense physical strength. Legend held that its shell was even harder than spiritual treasures, hence its ability to withstand the blow.  However, the other beasts weren't so fortunate. Two creatures resembling demonic wolves, but with three crimson tails each, were caught in the staff's wind and instantly perished, their brains splattering.</p><p>Their bodies, however, didn't remain; they dissolved into wisps of nothingness.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The blow, with the Golden Spiral Turtle embedded within, smashed deep into the heart of the beast horde.  The momentum continued, unleashing a towering pillar of light.  A terrifying force, like a spinning whirlwind, spread outwards, decimating and injuring the surrounding creatures, shattering their formation.</p><p>The Golden Spiral Turtle in the center, surprisingly, was still alive, struggling to right itself.</p><p>After a single strike that caused countless casualties, Yuan Ren was only just warming up.  He bent his knees slightly, leaped into the air, and plunged into the heart of the horde, his staff sweeping across in a horizontal arc.</p><p>The staff left a trail of visible afterimages, as severed limbs and body parts flew everywhere, accompanied by a cacophony of howls.</p><p>Yuan Ren was like a tiger among sheep, his power overwhelming!</p><p>Others had already engaged the horde, but none were as ferocious as Yuan Ren, daring to charge into the thick of it alone, a single staff in hand, relentlessly advancing.</p><p>“A Zhu Yan warrior!”</p><p>Ji Xia’s eyes lit up watching Yuan Ren, then he glanced down at his own slight frame, a touch of dejection crossing his face.</p><p>With the horde stalled, the Yuan Xiang Clan leader didn’t immediately rush to Yuan Ren's aid. Instead, he turned and asked, “Clan Elder Ji Xia, do you know Qin Zhenren?”</p><p>“We both unexpectedly fell into this space. Unfortunately, we didn't anticipate things escalating to this point…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained their meeting, then asked Ji Xia, “Daoist friend, do you know where these beasts came from?”</p><p>“They emerged from the Glow Sea,” Ji Xia said.  “The outside world has completely turned into a sea of glow, but the mist seems to have a special power that blocks the glow. We thought we were safe, but then this horde charged out.  By the way, did you see any other Jiaojiao clansmen?”</p><p>The Yuan Xiang Clan leader shook his head. “Only you, Daoist friend.  Weren't you together earlier?”</p><p>“Hmph! I couldn’t stand those fellows' tempers.  The old man disliked everyone, so I simply dispersed everyone, letting them each do their own thing,” Ji Xia snorted.</p><p>It was rumored that Jiaojiao clansmen were fiercely independent. Two Jiaojiao individuals rarely got along. Even married couples lived separately, meeting only infrequently.</p><p>“I've heard that the Sacred Land contains a sacred tree planted by an ancestor of the Jiaojiao Clan?” the Yuan Xiang Clan leader said.</p><p>The Jiaojiao Clan’s sacred tree, like the Bie Gou Clan's Bi Xie Ancient Temple, was a place where Jiaojiao experts would certainly visit after entering the Sacred Land.</p><p>“Man Liang Mountain, huh? The sacred tree has been destroyed! This ancestral relic is from there, though it flew out on its own after the tree collapsed and landed in the hands of one of my grandsons. He even got injured trying to catch it.  I don’t know what the clan leader and the others are doing, they are likely injured and have left the Sacred Land,” Ji Xia produced an item, gently shaking it.</p><p>The Jiaojiao ancestor had left behind a sprig of jade-green wood, while the Bie Gou Clan had a secret talisman.  Perhaps each clan ancestor's relic was different.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yuan Ren's fierce battle with the horde raged on.  The earlier casualties were insignificant to the overall tide of beasts; they had closed ranks again, nearly submerging him.</p><p>Ji Xia urged, "Quickly warn Yuan Ren to be cautious. Don't underestimate these demonic beasts.  The gray figures are the most dangerous; they are insidious and cunning…"</p><p>"It's alright!"</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader grabbed the wineskin at his waist, took a long draught, and said to Qin Sang, "Qin Zhenren, will you assist us with your thunder techniques?"</p><p>During the battle with the Siyou clan's Lu family, Qin Sang's thunder talismans had shown incredible power, particularly effective in large-scale combat, leaving a deep impression on the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, performed a hand gesture, and wind and thunder erupted from the heavens.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader also produced a long staff – a rather unassuming, grayish-black ebony staff.  He casually twirled it, then turned to the others, saying, "Everyone, let's begin!"</p><p>These individuals were Yuan Jian and other powerful Zhuyan clan retainers.  The overall battle formation mirrored this arrangement: retainer experts surrounded their respective upper clan members, forming independent battle circles. Each group was responsible for a specific area, creating a strong barrier to withstand the beast tide.</p><p>The Jiaoxiao clan was possibly the only upper clan without retainers.  Ji Xia, having nowhere else to go, stayed here, a welcome addition to Qin Sang's group.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader's style differed greatly from Yuan Ren's.  His figure moved like a wisp of smoke, weaving through the gaps in the beast horde. There were no earth-shattering displays of power, yet wherever he passed, the demonic beasts stiffened and collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang observed closely and finally understood the clan leader's technique.  His staff barely touched the beasts, each strike precise and exquisite – a supremely refined staff fighting style.</p><p>Simultaneously, other physically powerful experts charged into the horde from different directions, breaking through like arrows, tearing the beast tide apart.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader and his group's initial assault disrupted and weakened the beast horde's attack, allowing others to safely unleash their divine techniques from the rear.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly observed Yuan Jian and another Siyou clan expert.</p><p>Knowing your enemy and yourself ensures victory in a hundred battles. After the Yuanxiang clan leader warned him about Yuan Jian, Qin Sang focused on learning about the Siyou clan's abilities, though he knew little about Yuan Jian himself.  It was said that he remained secluded, rarely engaging in open duels after reaching the second level of the Void Realm.  Only a few techniques he employed at the first level were known.</p><p>The Zhuyan clan were all known for their belligerence; if trouble arose, it wouldn't fall to the Siyou clan experts to handle it.</p><p>Yuan Jian put on a green mask adorned with strange patterns.</p><p>He ran a hand over the mask; faint laughter echoed, the patterns twisting into a grotesque smiling face.</p><p>The laughter carried a strange power.  Qin Sang and the others were unaffected, but the demonic beasts suddenly stopped attacking, becoming dazed and sluggish, their eyes glazed over.  They even began to sleep soundly on the battlefield, allowing themselves to be slaughtered.</p><p>"That's the Siyou clan's 'Intoxicating Laughter' technique," Qin Sang recognized. Yuan Jian had previously mastered this technique, but the addition of the unknown mask had amplified its power.</p><p>While it appeared to be a spiritual cultivation technique, it was not. It was said to directly affect the body, leaving no room for defense, making the Siyou clan the Zhuyan clan's most detested opponent.</p><p>At this time, another Siyou clan expert also unleashed the Intoxicating Laughter; the combined power of the two was greater, covering a wider area. They didn't need to make the beasts actually sleep; a brief delay was enough to turn the tide of the battle.</p><p>This is why, even with the constant use of the technique, no one could criticize them, and their actions seemed to suggest this was their intention.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang could only concentrate on the battlefield.</p><p>Dark clouds gathered above the beast horde, lightning flashed, and the thunderclouds grew denser.  Rain began to fall, quickly intensifying into a downpour. The raindrops carried the power of thunder, transforming into countless bolts upon hitting the battlefield, leaping between the demonic beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated his altar, repeatedly unleashing several thunder techniques.  He found the Nine Heavens Azure Pool Thunderstorm technique particularly suitable for the situation and maintained it with all his might, his gaze constantly sweeping across the battlefield, using thunder talismans to reinforce any weaknesses.</p><p>Liuli stood behind Qin Sang, her white clothes billowing, snowflakes swirling around her, an icy aura emanating from her.  With a wave of her jade hand, a chilling wind swept through the beast horde, ice spreading across their bodies. Even if it didn't freeze them, it slowed their movements.</p><p>This was the '凛霜' (referencing the original character but avoiding direct translation for cultural sensitivity) technique; Liuli could concentrate on this single technique and still provide significant support to the battle.</p><p>The busiest person of all was Ji Xia.</p><p>After a brief moment of rest, he pulled out a pouch, grabbed a handful of seeds, and scattered them across the battlefield.</p><p>Then, Ji Xia took out a jade bottle filled with spiritual water. Using a feather of unknown origin, he dipped it into the bottle and sprinkled the water.  Immediately, seeds took root, sprouted, and instantly grew into saplings on the battlefield.</p><p>Next, Ji Xia took out various jade bottles, containing spiritual water and powders, continuously watering the saplings.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the saplings grew into towering trees, their trunks incredibly thick, devoid of leaves, their branches supple and flexible, like giant pythons, thrashing into the battlefield.  The demonic beasts entangled by the branches couldn't escape, until they burst and died.</p><p>These strange trees quickly killed countless demonic beasts, attracting attention, but everyone soon discovered their flaw: they remained rooted in place, unable to move.</p><p>However, Ji Xia didn't stop. He pulled out another handful of seeds from his pocket.</p><p>These seeds were extremely small; Ji Xia grabbed hundreds with one hand, and with a flick of his wrist, scattered them onto the battlefield.</p><p>These seeds grew fluffy hairs, flying everywhere, constantly scattering pollen. Demonic beasts touched by the pollen became sluggish, while Yuan Ren and others, having received an incantation from Ji Xia beforehand, remained unaffected.</p><p>It was unclear how many types of seeds Ji Xia kept in his pockets, but one after another, strangely powerful spirit plants sprang forth under his cultivation.  Qin Sang, initially observing Yuan Jian, was now captivated by Ji Xia.</p><p>A group of top-tier experts worked together. Though the number of beasts far outnumbered them, they couldn't break through the defense line.</p><p>Gradually, the weaknesses of the beast tide were exposed.</p><p>The abilities displayed by the legendary ancient demonic beasts matched the records, but they weren't perfect. Some could only use one or two abilities, some didn't know any abilities at all, only charging blindly, let alone coordinating.</p><p>Everyone sensed that someone was controlling the beast horde—likely the elusive gray figures—but due to the inherent flaws in the beasts themselves, even a skilled person could only do so much.</p><p>The situation improved drastically. Not only did they hold back the beast tide, but they began to prepare a counterattack.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's eyes suddenly turned cold. With a thought, countless thunderbolts gathered above his head, forming a thunder seal, which then shot a silver lightning bolt towards his side.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A gray shadow appeared beneath the lightning, struck directly, screamed, and perished instantly.</p><p>After the gray figure was killed, it completely disappeared without regenerating.</p><p>"Careful! These gray figures are even harder to deal with than before…"</p><p>Qin Sang telepathically warned everyone. The gray figures were targeting Liu Li, recognizing her as the weakest link, aiming to break through her defenses—a tactic never seen before.</p><p>Furthermore, this gray figure's concealment technique was superb. Without the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, they might not have noticed it until it was close.</p><p>At this time, chaos erupted on other battlefields as well.</p><p>Someone shouted, "Everyone, be careful! The gray figures are the same as before; they're using the abilities they learned from us!"</p><p>Qin Sang realized. This gray figure had apparently learned the concealment ability of a certain race. However, it was questionable whether they could still imitate everyone; facing the beast tide, they couldn't hide much of their strength.</p><p>Everyone became tense and cautious, but the speed of clearing the beast horde was not slow.  The battle lasted for two hours before the beast tide's offensive finally subsided, seemingly nearing its end.</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light descended from the sky, revealing a figure who surveyed the battlefield and announced, "Lord Hong Tian has summoned the clan chiefs and elders of all the upper clans to discuss important matters!"</p><p>This person carried a broadsword and was a Zhu Huai cultivator, reportedly the brother of a powerful Integration Stage cultivator.</p><p>"It's them!"</p><p>Upon seeing this person, Qin Sang immediately sensed a familiar aura.</p><p>When he first encountered the cultivator who was striving for the Integration Stage, this person's aura was there, protecting him.</p><p>In a flash, the Yuan Xiang clan chief withdrew from the battlefield, glancing upward, and said, "The beast tide is at its end, but don't let your guard down.  His highness places such importance on this; it certainly won't be that simple."</p><p>Everyone agreed, saying, "Clan Chief Yuan Xiang, please go ahead."</p><p>Yuan Xiang nodded, and he and Ji Xia flew into the air.  Other figures also rose, following the Zhu Huai cultivator into the sky.</p><p>Not long after Yuan Xiang left, the beast tide ended. After killing the last demonic beast, everyone sat cross-legged. Although Nascent Soul cultivators were considered to have inexhaustible spiritual energy, after prolonged and relentless fighting, they were inevitably exhausted and needed to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang found Shao Shi and the others, secretly transmitting a message, "Daoist Shi, why do you ignore me?"</p><p>After a moment of silence, Shao Shi replied with a wry smile, "It seems Qin Zhenren already knows. The Royal Family wishes to forge an everlasting bond with Qin Zhenren, but we are constrained by circumstances. Qin Zhenren should understand our predicament. I can only offer a promise on behalf of His Imperial Majesty: neutrality!"</p><p>(End)</p>
