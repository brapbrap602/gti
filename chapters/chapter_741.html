<h1>Chapter 733: Core Formation, Mid-Stage</h1><p>The good news was that Feican's absorption of the venomous beast's core was proceeding smoothly, showing signs of a breakthrough.</p><p>After checking on his two spirit insects, Qin Sang settled into meditation, and silence returned to the cave.</p><p>…</p><p>An unnamed, desolate island.</p><p>The island was exceptionally vast, teeming with large groups of monstrous beasts.</p><p>Deep beneath the island lay a massive cavern, where strange crystals shimmered with a dreamlike, otherworldly light.</p><p>In the depths of this cavern, a stalactite had been cleanly severed in two.  Atop the remaining portion sat a meditating figure.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>The stalactite was large, and Qin Sang sat at its center, surrounded by a temporary spirit-gathering formation.</p><p>Strangely, the cavern was already rich with spiritual energy, more than sufficient for his cultivation needs.</p><p>His face was flushed, his body motionless, yet his breath came in uneven waves. Any other cultivator witnessing this would be filled with envy, for these were the signs of an imminent breakthrough!</p><p>The Flying Night Devil and the Twin-Headed Wolf guarded him attentively.</p><p>The Twin-Headed Wolf would occasionally glance at Qin Sang, its eyes flickering, seemingly more eager than Qin Sang himself.</p><p>It clearly remembered Qin Sang's Heart Demon Oath to release it after reaching the late stage of Core Formation.</p><p>The day of its freedom was drawing ever closer!</p><p>The Twin-Headed Wolf was intelligent enough to understand its own best interests.</p><p>Over the years it had served Qin Sang, he had indeed used it in battles, but never abandoned it in the face of danger, which could be considered honorable.</p><p>There were countless examples of spirit beasts benefiting from their masters' ascension.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to possess decent talent.</p><p>However, this did not change the Twin-Headed Wolf's desire; it never forgot the joy of its former freedom.</p><p>Qin Sang focused intently. Within his dantian, true essence churned restlessly, and his five-colored core rotated at an astonishing speed.</p><p>Days and nights blurred within the cavern.</p><p>This state had persisted for an unknown length of time.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang suddenly groaned, his face contorted. His core radiated a brilliant light, causing the surrounding spiritual energy to surge and then rush madly into his dantian.</p><p>In an instant, the surrounding spiritual energy was completely drained.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a long roar, and with a 'boom', his aura exploded.  An invisible wave swept outwards, instantly shattering the spirit-gathering formation.</p><p>The spirit stones, already depleted and pale, were effortlessly crushed.</p><p>The stalactite beneath him cracked and groaned, then collapsed.</p><p>Dust billowed.</p><p>In the next moment, a figure soared skyward, followed by a burst of joyous laughter that echoed through the cavern.</p><p>The laughter ceased.</p><p>Qin Sang landed back on the ground.</p><p>Twenty-two years had passed since he arrived at the Five Elements Islands, and almost fifty years since he was transported to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Knowing that the Seven Killing Palace was opening earlier than expected, Qin Sang dared not slacken in his cultivation. For these twenty-two years, he had spent almost all his time in the depths of the Demonic Sea.</p><p>He journeyed alone, accompanied only by monstrous beasts.</p><p>Decades of arduous cultivation had finally led to this breakthrough!</p><p>“Twenty-two years. Old Zou said the Seven Killing Palace would open in a little over twenty years, but there's still no exact date.  It should be soon, though…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, eagerly inspecting his inner self, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p>Not only had his true essence grown stronger, but his divine sense had also significantly improved.</p><p>As expected, with the breakthrough to mid-stage Core Formation, the restrictive inscription fragments left by Lord Dongyang were finally eradicated. Although the Corpse Core had minimized their influence, their presence had always been an irritant.</p><p>However, to Qin Sang's dismay, the gray mass remained stubbornly present.</p><p>He channeled his now more potent true essence to attack it, but the result was the same as before; it was absorbed without a ripple, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Fortunately, the gray mass had remained dormant since he achieved Core Formation, so he decided to leave it be.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, severed another stalactite, and flew up to sit on it. He wanted to thoroughly examine his changes and try cultivating the technique passed down by Senior Qingzhu to see how it differed from the original.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after meditating for a while, Qin Sang was suddenly startled awake.</p><p>He looked up at the cavern ceiling, listening intently. Moments later, he beckoned, summoning the Flying Night Devil and the Twin-Headed Wolf. Then, he swiftly darted towards the cavern exit.</p><p>The cavern’s entrance was well-hidden, concealed amidst waist-high wild grass and covered by loose rocks.</p><p>The terrain around the grassy patch was elevated, allowing Qin Sang to catch a glimpse of the coastline as he crouched at the entrance.</p><p>Surprisingly, the island’s monstrous beasts had become agitated for some unknown reason.  Eerie roars and shrieks echoed all around.</p><p>To the west of the island, in the Demonic Sea, the waves surged despite the lack of wind.</p><p>Among the giant waves, dark shapes of varying sizes swam, occasionally breaching the surface, exuding terrifying auras.</p><p>“A beast tide?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>During his years on the Five Elements Islands, this wasn't his first encounter with a beast tide. The last one had occurred while he was on Golden Origin Island.</p><p>Fortunately, Golden Origin Island had received early warning, and the cultivators had escaped to Wood Origin Island in time, minimizing casualties.</p><p>That experience had shown Qin Sang the terrifying power of a beast tide.</p><p>Faced with such overwhelming numbers of monstrous beasts, individuals seemed insignificant. It had fueled his desire to become stronger!</p><p>Later, Qin Sang heard that that particular beast tide wasn’t even the most severe.</p><p>“This is the depths of the Demonic Sea, so far from the Five Elements Islands. How could a beast tide start here? And why so soon? It hasn't even been ten years since the last one…”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave. He had a premonition that this beast tide might be extraordinary.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang left the cavern and silently flew towards the eastern side of the island, determined to return and warn others.</p><p>Over the years, the Wang sisters had managed their trading business with great success, benefiting Qin Sang considerably.  Through their network, he had acquired various cultivation-enhancing pills.</p><p>He didn't want the trading company to be destroyed by the beast tide.</p><p>"It's a pity I was too busy stabilizing my cultivation to practice Senior Qingzhu's modified technique. I'll have to wait until I get back. I should return anyway. I haven't heard from Old Zou for a while.  I mustn't miss the Seven Killing Palace."</p><p>With the beast tide nearby, Qin Sang was extremely cautious, concealing his aura.</p><p>Reaching the eastern side of the island, he was relieved to see that the beast tide hadn't reached there yet. He continued eastward, and once safely away, he activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>Enveloped by the Jiao dragon’s soul, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of red light, vanishing into the horizon with a few flickers.</p><p>With his increased cultivation, the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman was even faster!</p><p>On his way, Qin Sang experimented with combining it with the Sword Qi Thunder Sound technique, marveling at his astonishing speed.  Even an average late-stage Core Formation cultivator would likely be left behind!</p><p>Exhilarated, Qin Sang alternated between the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman and the Twin-Headed Wolf, while monitoring the beast tide's movements.</p><p>"It seems they're heading for Wood Origin Island…"</p><p>Having determined the beast tide's target, Qin Sang immediately increased his speed.</p>
