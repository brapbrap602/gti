<h1>Chapter 315: Ambush</h1><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang left Changyang Market and flew towards the Sky Crystal Sanctuary.</p><p>The market was surrounded by a boundless expanse of rolling stone hills, a completely barren land. Qin Sang was very familiar with the environment, having even conducted a few 'transactions' there.</p><p>Upon leaving Changyang Market, Qin Sang first concealed his figure, vigilantly observing his surroundings to ensure no one was following or watching him.</p><p>However, being in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, caution was never excessive.</p><p>He activated the grey robe he wore, enveloping himself in a hazy grey aura. This was a high-grade defensive artifact he had found in Luo Xingnan's storage pouch.</p><p>Coupled with the Corpsefiend and the Ebony Sword, which he could deploy at any moment, he was confident in handling most emergencies.</p><p>Then, he transformed into a streak of light, flying towards the Sky Crystal Sanctuary.</p><p>As Qin Sang was about to fly out of the stone hills, passing between two tall mountains, an unsettling feeling suddenly arose in his heart.</p><p>This feeling was abrupt and intense!</p><p>Before Qin Sang could figure out the reason, a thunderous explosion suddenly erupted above him.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly halted.</p><p>At that moment, the ground trembled violently, as if an ancient thunder beast, slumbering beneath, had been awakened by Qin Sang's intrusion and roared in fury.</p><p>Along with the thunderous boom, Qin Sang felt an incredibly terrifying aura lock onto him from above. A chill ran down his spine, and his hair stood on end.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression drastically changed as he looked up in alarm.</p><p>His vision was filled with blinding lightning. At the center of the lightning, a yellow talisman hung suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The talisman cracked with a 'snap', and a bottomless vortex formed above, spinning wildly.  Wind howled, thunder roared, and lightning danced.</p><p>In an instant, the sky changed color.</p><p>The terrifying aura that had locked onto Qin Sang emanated from the vortex. Suddenly, countless bolts of lightning shot out from the vortex, converging into a single beam aimed directly at him.</p><p>A gigantic beam of light descended from the heavens!</p><p>This beam carried an aura of utter destruction. Even though Qin Sang had already broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, he absolutely dared not withstand this power with his physical body.</p><p>Who?</p><p>Why?</p><p>He had few enemies, or rather, few living enemies.</p><p>Even when fishing for targets in Changyang Market, he had been extremely cautious, choosing only roaming bandits. He always cleaned up thoroughly after each action, leaving no trace.</p><p>Could it be that someone had set an ambush here, randomly selecting targets and waiting for a lucrative prey to fall into the trap? Was he simply unlucky enough to stumble into it?</p><p>Preposterous!</p><p>The stone hills covered such a vast area, and the Sky Crystal Sanctuary was in a remote location. Setting a trap here might yield nothing for a long time. The efficiency would be too low.</p><p>The spell sealed within the talisman was incredibly powerful and valuable.</p><p>Who would rashly use such a talisman without even knowing the identity of their target? Weren't they afraid of a loss outweighing the gain?</p><p>Moreover, he had cautiously circled the area, confirming that no one was following him, before heading straight for the Sky Crystal Sanctuary. How could it be such a coincidence?</p><p>The blinding light reflected in Qin Sang's shocked eyes.</p><p>Amidst his astonishment, these thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p>The beam of light was incredibly fast. Qin Sang had no time to dodge. He hurriedly channeled spiritual energy into his grey robe artifact, causing the grey mist to surge and converge rapidly.</p><p>In the next instant, Qin Sang was about to be engulfed by the beam of light.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The grey robe artifact couldn't even withstand a single breath. It shattered into pieces upon contact with the beam.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The lightning crashed down.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was filled with terror. Even if he activated the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman now, he wouldn't be able to escape the range of the beam.</p><p>In this desperate situation, Qin Sang made a decisive move. He swiftly swept his hand across his Corpse Puppet Pouch. The few remaining zombies and the Corpsefiend refined from Luo Xingnan's body flew out, fearlessly facing the beam of light.</p><p>The refined corpses resisted the thunder with their physical bodies!</p><p>The zombies, whose strength was only equivalent to Qi Refining stage cultivators, instantly followed in the footsteps of the grey robe artifact, turning into dust upon contact.</p><p>The Corpsefiend lasted a bit longer. It emitted a chilling roar, its body surging with baleful energy as it charged towards the lightning without reservation.</p><p>But it was no match for the lightning either. Its baleful energy was quickly depleted, cracks appearing on its body before it exploded with a 'bang', shattered by the lightning.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Qin Sang's throat felt sweet, as if struck by a heavy hammer. He coughed up a mouthful of blood, which was instantly annihilated by the lightning. His body was swept by the light, sent flying like a kite with a broken string.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Dust and debris flew everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang crashed hard against the solid rock, groaning in pain. The Corpsefiend had absorbed some of the talisman's power for him, but the remaining lightning was still terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang's clothes were torn, and his body was covered in wounds.  Before he could assess his injuries, loud sword cries echoed from the mountains on both sides. Sword lights flashed like swimming dragons, arriving in the blink of an eye.</p><p>One deadly attack after another, giving Qin Sang no chance to breathe.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Several streaks of light flew out from the mountains, following closely behind the sword lights.</p><p>One from the left mountain, and two from the right!</p><p>Three people!</p><p>They had been hiding in the distance, ambushing him with the talisman. Once he was struck, they immediately closed in.</p><p>From the two streaks of light on the right, a shout rang out, a voice Qin Sang knew very well.</p><p>“Quick! Don’t give him a chance to use his talisman treasure!”</p><p>Yu Daiyue!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart trembled.</p><p>Hearing this voice, he suddenly understood.  They were targeting him!</p><p>Yu Daiyue knew he would be going to the Sky Crystal Sanctuary, taking this route.</p><p>But Qin Sang couldn't understand why Yu Daiyue would ambush him, seemingly intent on killing him.</p><p>This was definitely not the decision of Shaohua Mountain, because besides Yu Daiyue, the other two weren't Shaohua Mountain disciples. Qin Sang didn't recognize either of them.</p><p>He and Yu Daiyue had no grudges. They were fellow disciples and had cooperated twice, in the Heavenly Corpse Sect's lair and the Ancient Cultivator's ruins. Even if they weren't close friends, there was some camaraderie.</p><p>Or had he inadvertently offended Yu Daiyue, provoking him to such an extent?</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had never held any expectations for anyone other than himself, a surge of anger still rose within him. However, he quickly suppressed it.</p><p>Facing a life-or-death crisis, he couldn't let anger cloud his judgment.</p><p>Whatever grudges they had could be settled after he escaped!</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze pierced through the crisscrossing sword lights, his bloodshot eyes fixed coldly on Yu Daiyue. Then, his brow suddenly shimmered, and the Ebony Sword flew out, narrowly blocking two of the incoming sword lights.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>The Ebony Sword was knocked back, but the two flying swords also faltered.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, passing between the two swords in a hair's breadth.</p><p>Then, with a 'boom' behind him, the other person's flying sword struck where he had just been, leaving a deep gash in the rock.</p>
