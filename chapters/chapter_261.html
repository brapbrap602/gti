<h1>**Chapter 254: Invasive Prohibition**</h1><p>Tianfeng was blocked by a protective formation. Standing at the edge of the formation, you could distinctly feel heart-pounding fluctuations emanating ahead, even a Core Formation cultivator like Elder Diqué didn’t dare to break in rashly.</p><p>Fortunately, there was a mountain path inside the protective formation for entry.</p><p>The path was windy and narrow, leading to the depths of the mist. The scenery along the way kept changing: passing through wild grass, dense forests, and ravines, there were also temples, thatched cottages, stone halls...</p><p>Each one shone with the light of restrictions, with no less than dozens here and there.</p><p>Apparently, getting through the restrictions on the path while safely reaching the top of the mountain wasn’t easy either.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and the other two concealed their figures, standing on the path. Ahead was the entrance to the protective formation, where the path entered a jungle, vanishing in the depths of the jungle, and then extending out again behind the jungle.</p><p>The trees in the jungle had already died, abnormally dry, not a leaf left, with twisted shapes, looking like dead monsters from afar. The shadows on the ground looked more like countless howling ghosts.</p><p>This was a dead forest!</p><p>The dead forest was filled with dense restrictions, layered one upon another, making one’s scalp go numb. The dim light was like a man-eating mouth, waiting for trespassers to cast themselves into the net.</p><p>At first glance, the dead trees in the forest seemed messy and disorganized, but if you looked carefully, you would discover that every tree and every branch contained some special rules and harmonized with the restrictions.</p><p>“You go first!”</p><p>Elder Diqué pointed at Qin Sang, offering that conch-shaped magic weapon and handing it to him.</p><p>“Take my Celestial Sound Conch and go in. The conch contains the spiritual energy and markings I left behind. I will cooperate with you to break the restrictions. But I have other things to attend to, so it won’t be easy to look after you. Therefore, when breaking the restrictions, you must exert all your strength and don’t always think about relying on me to help you. Otherwise, if you encounter danger, I may not necessarily be able to save you…”</p><p>Qin Sang received the Celestial Sound Conch and sensed it with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Even though he had the Ten Yama Banner as a magic weapon in his mustard-seed pouch, this was the first time Qin Sang had really used a magic weapon. The power contained in the magic weapon shocked Qin Sang while also making him extremely envious.</p><p>He wondered when he would be able to control such great power!</p><p>Just like in the Earth Cave, he could control the Celestial Sound Conch at will, as well as the Illusory Divine Sound power that Elder Diqué left in it. But he was only a commander. On top of the obstructions of the restrictions, if he encountered an extremely complicated situation, it would be difficult for Elder Diqué to help him in time.</p><p>The only person he could truly rely on was himself.</p><p>Elder Diqué sat before the restrictions, indicating that Qin Sang could enter.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, tightened his grip on the Celestial Sound Conch, and stepped into the restrictions. Thereupon, everything in his sight disappeared, including the road, Tianfeng, Elder Diqué, and Ren Hong…</p><p>He was in the ghost-like dead forest, unable to see outside, while people outside were unable to see him.</p><p>Outside the restrictions, Elder Diqué stared solemnly at the dead forest, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>Ren Hong couldn’t see into the restrictions and could only wait idly off to the side, but he couldn’t hide the worry in his eyes, since the next restriction would probably have to be broken by him.</p><p>Qin Sang stood still, his eyes scanning every inch of the withered trees around him.</p><p>The dead forest and the restrictions here were perfectly integrated, airtight, and deathly silent. There was no path in the dead forest, or perhaps the path was concealed and he needed to forcefully break the restrictions, figuring out how to break it.</p><p>After some hesitation, Qin Sang patted his Corpse Puppet Pouch, and a ghoul flew out.</p><p>His identity had been exposed anyway, and Elder Diqué knew everything about his background. He had already decided that if he could find an opportunity, he would escape somewhere else, so there was no need to keep his corpse-refining technique a secret.</p><p>The most important thing now was to save his own life in the restriction.</p><p>“A corpse puppet…”</p><p>Elder Diqué looked somewhat surprised outside, letting out a sinister laugh, but he didn’t interfere.</p><p>After observing every detail in the dead forest, as well as the changes in the layers of restrictions, back and forth for several times, Qin Sang finally fixed his sight on two withered trees.</p><p>The restrictions in the dead forest were very profound, so its power was naturally formidable. Fortunately, he had received his senior sister Qingting’s insights on restrictions, and had already done research, so he wasn’t completely in the dark and helpless.</p><p>However, the restrictions in the dead forest far exceeded the level his abilities could reach, so if he wanted to truly figure out every change in the restrictions, he needed to test it out on himself.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at those two withered trees, deciding to make this their breakthrough point.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the ghoul to go ahead, but he quickly followed it himself.</p><p>The force of the restrictions is extremely strong. Here, corpses are as vulnerable as mortals. If the restriction is triggered, Qin Sang will not be able to rescue them if the distance is too great.</p><p>It is impossible to rely solely on corpses to break the restriction. No matter how many corpses there are, they cannot withstand such consumption. Qin Sang only lets them scout in front of him to gain a little time for himself.</p><p>Walking to the gap between the trees step by step, Qin Sang takes a deep look at the fluctuating light of the restriction, then suddenly flashes into it.</p><p>‘Swish, swish...’</p><p>In an instant, the two withered trees sway without warning, like living things, swaying their bodies. The crooked and ugly branches suddenly straighten, and the tips point directly at Qin Sang, then like a dense rain of arrows, they shoot at him with a sharp sound.</p><p>It is not only these two trees, all the withered trees around come to life, an instant chaos of demons.</p><p>Qin Sang had already expected this. Just as he was about to fight back, the Tianyinluo in his hand suddenly vibrates, the sound of the snail is crisp, and then the cold snort of the old man Dique is heard. A surge of the power of the Thousand Illusion Divine Sound flies out of the snail shell and instantly sinks into the trunk of the withered tree on Qin Sang’s right.</p><p>The branches of the withered tree pause, seeming to have not changed much, and continue to shoot at Qin Sang with bared fangs and brandished claws.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly sees a flash of cyan light on the trunk of the withered tree, which is blocked by the Thousand Illusion Divine Sound.</p><p>“Another spiritual talisman...”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understands. No wonder the old man Dique is so cautious, as if facing a formidable enemy, letting him scout.</p><p>The spiritual talisman left by the Taoist priest Xuanyu is definitely not the only one, and there may even be other tricks. The old man Dique must search with all his strength, and cannot have the slightest omission.</p><p>Even if he misses a spiritual talisman and is discovered by the Taoist priest Xuanyu, it will mean all previous efforts have been in vain.</p><p>Can he use this opportunity to warn the Taoist priest Xuanyu, and then escape while the two are fighting?</p><p>Qin Sang immediately gives up this idea.</p><p>Let alone whether Taoist priest Xuanyu will fight with the old man Dique, he is far away on the mountaintop, maybe even inside the ancient cultivator's cave. The one closest to him is the old man Dique, who will kill him first.</p><p>The distracting thoughts in his head are instantly suppressed, and the old man Dique’s actions do not affect Qin Sang.</p><p>He still focuses on watching the branches, his eyes as sharp as electricity, instantly aware of all the changes, and then with a single thought, the Tianyinluo shines brightly, enveloping him and the corpse, and almost at the same time, they start moving, leaving behind streaks of afterimages.</p><p>The withered branches are like the hair of evil spirits, extremely flexible. As soon as Qin Sang moves, they immediately entwine and tear the afterimages to pieces.</p>
