Chapter 705: Turning Hostile


Qin Sang abruptly turned, his eyes narrowed, scrutinizing the wiry old man from head to toe. He suddenly asked, "Were you the one just now contacting someone outside?"

The wiry old man's expression shifted, but he quickly masked it with a forced smile. "Fellow Daoist Qin, what are you talking about? What person?"

Qin Sang stared at the wiry old man, the corners of his mouth curling into a sneer.

None of the six people present noticed that before entering the cavern, he had left the Sky Eye Butterfly outside.

After its second metamorphosis, the Sky Eye Butterfly had gained the ability to turn invisible. To Qin Sang's surprise, the recently transformed butterfly's ability was already remarkably potent, capable of eluding the perception of even early Core Formation cultivators.

If it weren't his natal insect蛊, linked to him by this connection, even if the butterfly were invisible right in front of him, he wouldn't detect it unless he deliberately searched for it.

Invisibility was the only new ability the Sky Eye Butterfly had gained after its transformation. Compared to Foundation Establishment cultivators, Spirit Transformation Realm demonic beasts, or even other second-transformation spirit insects, it was undoubtedly fragile.

Perhaps precisely because of this, it could deceive even enemies a whole realm above it, allowing it to survive in the perilous world of cultivation.

Earlier, outside the cave, Qin Sang used the frost-covered grass to distract the others while he discreetly released the Sky Eye Butterfly. As expected, no one noticed.

Qin Sang had the butterfly perch on a tree.

He wasn't sure if it was due to being refined into his natal insect, nourished by his blood essence, or if the Spirit Controlling Sect's records were erroneous, but the Sky Eye Butterfly wasn't as fragile as the records claimed, dying at the slightest touch.

After its second transformation, its strength had also increased significantly.

Although it couldn't compare to Foundation Establishment cultivators, it could still surpass ordinary Qi Refining cultivators. Coupled with its exceptional cloaking ability, it wasn't difficult for it to survive encounters with danger. That's why Qin Sang felt at ease leaving it outside.

Inside the frost-filled cavern, the Sky Eye Butterfly was useless. Qin Sang didn't dare release it; it would die instantly. It was better to leave it outside to monitor the situation.

If anything unexpected happened, it could alert him immediately, allowing him to escape.

He and his natal insect were connected by blood. Although the Sky Eye Butterfly wasn't intelligent, Qin Sang could vaguely sense its thoughts.

For now, it was just a vague feeling. As the butterfly's cultivation improved, this perception would become clearer, until the butterfly became like an extension of Qin Sang, able to see what it saw.

Of course, this perception was only effective within a certain range, and if there were powerful restrictions in between, the connection might be severed.

However, the cave wasn't as deep as he thought, and the link between him and the butterfly remained.

Qin Sang didn't trust the stout cultivator or the other five. He dared to participate because his escape speed far surpassed that of other cultivators at his level. He was confident he could escape even if danger arose.

He initially thought that if the group turned on each other, it would be because of an exceptionally valuable treasure within the cave, or perhaps the stout cultivator had ulterior motives, and his actions were discovered.

He hadn't expected a problem to arise before they even saw what the Nascent Soul cave dwelling looked like.

Just as they were about to step into the fissure in the restriction, the Sky Eye Butterfly suddenly transmitted a thought. The frost had fluctuated strangely, as if a shadowy figure had rushed out and vanished. Qin Sang's heart sank.

There were only seven of them in the cave.

Before entering, they had watched each other closely. No one could leave the others' sight. The warning restriction was also set up jointly. Unless someone else had a similar means like the Sky Eye Butterfly, it would be difficult to act without being noticed.

The only opportunity was when they were scattered by the restrictive backlash, preoccupied with dealing with the black light's impact.

If there was a traitor signaling someone outside, that was the only chance.

In that instant, Qin Sang immediately decided to retreat.

Although they had carefully explored the waters around the island, the range was limited.

If someone were lurking further out, receiving the signal and coordinating with the traitor inside, the Nine Dragons Heaven Chariot Talisman wouldn't be as effective in the narrow cavern.

Qin Sang's first suspect was naturally the stout cultivator. Using the Nascent Soul cave dwelling as bait, luring others here and then ambushing them with accomplices was a plausible scenario.

However, as the initiator, everyone was watching the stout cultivator's movements. Even amidst the black light, it would be difficult for him to escape everyone's notice. The risk of exposure was high.

Seeing that the wiry old man had fallen behind him, Qin Sang's suspicions immediately shifted. When the black light surged, he had secretly activated the Nine Dragons Heaven Chariot Talisman to retreat. It was impossible for anyone to have retreated further than him.

Qin Sang's sudden verbal probe caught the wiry old man off guard, revealing his guilt.

Was this man the stout cultivator's accomplice, or had he brought his own?

It didn't matter!

The signal had been sent. Whoever was lying in wait outside would arrive soon. Before ascertaining their strength, he absolutely couldn't allow himself to be trapped in the cave.

These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind in an instant.

With a cold smile, Qin Sang saw the wiry old man's grip tighten on his bone fan. Without hesitation, Qin Sang attacked!

'Whoosh!'

Nine Nether Devil Fire transformed into a fire dragon, surging towards the wiry old man's face.

The wiry old man hadn't expected Qin Sang to strike so decisively. Startled, he hurriedly waved his bone fan, sending out a pale white beam of light to block the devil fire.

Then, his hand seals changed rapidly. The bone fan clicked and clacked, its ribs extending into gleaming, slender bone swords.

Before the fan's transformation was complete, the wiry old man's face changed drastically. Two shadowy figures suddenly emerged from the black light on either side of him.

Qin Sang had learned his lesson from the battle with the black-robed young man outside Toll Rock Island. Even against opponents of the same realm, he no longer considered capturing them for interrogation. Instead, he used swift and decisive force to eliminate them.

He had no desire to experience the power of the Thunder Decree Talisman again.

The Skyfiends were incredibly fast, closing in instantly. Their ghost claws shimmered, and a dense corpse Qi erupted.

"Gold Core level Corpse Refinements…"

The wiry old man was terrified. Caught off guard, he hadn't even reacted before the pale light from his bone fan was effortlessly shattered by the Nine Nether Devil Fire.

The Ten Yama Envoys Banner formation possessed power comparable to a mid-grade magical treasure. How could his mere bone fan withstand it?

At this moment, the wiry old man finally realized how terrifying Qin Sang's strength was.

'Crack...'

With a crisp sound, the bone fan was knocked away by the devil fire, leaving the wiry old man wide open. The Skyfiend seized the opportunity, its ghost claws erupting with corpse Qi, easily piercing through the old man's protective True Essence and plunging into his abdomen, twisting violently.

The wiry old man shrieked, horrified as the Nine Nether Devil Fire closed in.

In an instant, the wiry old man was engulfed in flames. Qin Sang discreetly pocketed his storage pouch.
