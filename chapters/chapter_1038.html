<h1>Chapter 1130 Escape</h1><p>Having shaken off the stone ape and the beasts, Qin Sang was more cautious than before.  However, these stone spirits hid underground, indistinguishable from rocks when still. Not only could her spiritual sense not detect them, but even the Sky-Eye Butterfly couldn't discern anything unusual, making it very difficult to discover them in advance.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back at the chaotic forest, without stopping, she flew directly towards the water she had seen earlier.</p><p>In a short while, Qin Sang flew over several mountain ranges.</p><p>The view suddenly opened up.</p><p>Before her lay a boundless expanse of water, not the mountain lake she had imagined.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang vaguely guessed, "This is likely the border between the Wu Tu Region and the Ling Shui Region. Following the border, I can find the Treasure Pavilion, but which way should I go?"</p><p>The four regions are located in the east, west, south, and north. Wu Tu is in the west, and Ling Shui is in the north; she only needed to go southwest to reach the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, appearing on the shore.</p><p>The entire Ling Shui Region was wetlands, and it was said that there were also creatures similar to the stone ape, a kind of water spirit, shaped like a three-legged golden toad, called the Ling Shui Toad.  Of course, there were also beasts in the water.</p><p>Flying into the wetland, the surroundings were very quiet. Seeing no Ling Shui Toads, Qin Sang didn't stop, continuing to fly deeper into the Ling Shui Region.</p><p>Not long after, the water suddenly churned without wind.</p><p>Then, a series of "croaks" echoed, and numerous Ling Shui Toads, the size of calves, completely transparent, burst from the surface without warning.</p><p>The Ling Shui Toads opened their mouths, instantly sucking the surrounding water into their bellies.  Their cheeks bulging, they spouted water columns, transforming them into ice arrows that shot out.</p><p>Whoosh… whoosh… whoosh…</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, her sword energy protecting her body, shattering the oncoming ice arrows. Before the beasts could encircle her, she used the same trick again, relying on her superb evasion skills to leave her enemies far behind.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang's face showed a look of joy.</p><p>When attacked by the Ling Shui Toads, the Sky-Eye Butterfly had detected something unusual in advance.  When the Ling Shui Toads were disturbed and condensed into their physical form, faint ripples would appear on the water's surface, barely visible to the naked eye.  As long as the Sky-Eye Butterfly could detect the ripples, Qin Sang could respond promptly.</p><p>Going through the Ling Shui Region was undoubtedly much easier than the land route.</p><p>Qin Sang no longer hesitated, ordering the Sky-Eye Butterfly to keep a close watch on the water's surface, and flew towards the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>…</p><p>Trial Realm.</p><p>Yellow sand swept across the land.</p><p>The air above the yellow sand steamed, and even the wind here was exceptionally hot.  Sand dunes rose and fell from time to time, indicating beasts moving beneath.</p><p>In the boundless desert, a desolate place, the air suddenly rippled, and then a woman's figure appeared out of thin air.</p><p>This woman was Su Nu.</p><p>Like Qin Sang, upon appearing, she didn't dare to move rashly, observing the desert below, ensuring there was no danger before landing on a large sand dune to observe her surroundings.</p><p>"This is the Tian Huo Region."</p><p>Su Nu's understanding of the Trial Realm far surpassed Qin Sang's; she recognized the area at a glance, quickly determining her direction and the location of the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>"Those guys aren't here. We've been separated. This might be my only chance to escape. As long as I can reach the Treasure Pavilion before they arrive, obtain a treasure, I can be teleported out of the Trial Realm, enter the Inner Hall, and temporarily escape the control of the Dongji Alliance. Then, I can crack the bloodline imprint on this token, and when the Inner Hall is about to close, I can slip away.  I'll finally be free…"</p><p>Su Nu's face tightened, murmuring softly.</p><p>She had never given up hope.</p><p>However, her enemies were overwhelmingly strong. During her Foundation Establishment stage, she was controlled by Yue Xiangu; now, having broken through to the late Nascent Soul stage, she had to face the Dongji Alliance Leader and other Yuan Ying cultivators from the Shang Alliance.</p><p>Su Nu could only endure, pretending to be innocent and ignorant, until she found such an opportunity.</p><p>She didn't know what the Dongji Alliance wanted to do, nor did she have any interest in the Soul Cleansing Liquid; she only wanted to escape their clutches, as quickly as possible.</p><p>Learning that the Dongji Alliance intended to take her to the Seven Kills Hall, Su Nu had felt a deep unease, and now that unease intensified.</p><p>She opened her palm, revealing two objects.</p><p>One was the token, like a bone spur, guiding others towards her.</p><p>The other was a small black square seal with a ghost's head, only the size of a thumb. The seal was pitch black, the ghost's head lifelike, as if sneering, strangely eerie.</p><p>"I hope it doesn't come to that," Su Nu sighed, murmuring in despair. "But what if… who can I trust?"</p><p>With a flip of her hand, she put away the two objects.</p><p>Su Nu no longer hesitated, activating her demonic wings and speeding towards the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as she crossed a sand dune…</p><p>A fissure unexpectedly opened in the sand dune, immediately releasing a surge of intensely hot air, tinged with a faint reddish hue, like a pillar of fire.</p><p>The red air shot skyward, directly toward Su Nu.</p><p>Su Nu's expression changed slightly.  She rapidly beat her magical wings, her body subtly tilting to evade the attack.</p><p>The red air missed its target, but the assault didn't end.  The air solidified, transforming into numerous fire spirits, vaguely humanoid in shape.</p><p>These fire spirits appeared ethereal, not quite solid, yet their strength was undeniable. Like the stone apes and spirit water toads Qin Sang encountered, they were guardians of the Fiery Domain.</p><p>"Even trying to conceal my aura, I couldn't hide from them.  That old geezer was right; these fire spirits have incredibly keen senses…"</p><p>Su Nu's heart sank.  Her plan had failed.</p><p>The fire spirits were hidden deep within the dunes, blending with the subterranean flames.  Detection beforehand was impossible; she could only fight her way through, significantly slowing her progress.</p><p>Reaching the Hundred Treasures Pavilion before anyone else was now highly unlikely.</p><p>'Bang, bang, bang…'</p><p>Small and large mounds erupted from the surrounding sand.  As the fire spirits attacked Su Nu, they opened their mouths, emitting silent signals that awakened the beasts hidden underground. The situation was far worse than she'd anticipated.</p><p>Even so, Su Nu didn't give up.  She activated her magical wings, transforming into a black streak of light, charging towards one fire spirit and unleashing a magical blast.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The fire spirit dissolved into light smoke, dissipating back into the ground, only to quickly reform.</p><p>By this time, Su Nu had broken through the fire spirits' encirclement, using her magical blade to slay several beasts before they could surround her, escaping just in the nick of time.</p><p>The crisis was averted, but Su Nu's expression remained strained. Her premonition had been correct; she was facing wave after wave of attacks.  Her escape techniques weren't as refined as Qin Sang's; she couldn't avoid danger, only fight through it.</p><p>To save time, she rarely stopped to recover her energy, resulting in steadily dwindling power.</p><p>She didn't know how far she'd traveled, nor how much longer it would take to reach the Hundred Treasures Pavilion.</p><p>Just as she pressed forward relentlessly, a whooshing sound came from the distance, followed by two streaks of light speeding towards her, pursued by several fire spirits.</p><p>"Junior Sister, come here!  Hong Junior Sister is here too.  Amazing, we're all in the Fiery Domain."</p><p>An old voice boomed.</p><p>Su Nu's eyes darkened.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thank you to Wên Qǐ Bù Kāi Qiāng (吻起不开枪) for the generous contribution!</p><p>Thank you to all readers for your support!</p><p>I've been quite busy with year-end work, but it's almost over.
