<h1>Chapter 922: Sea Toad Island</h1><p>“It seems you don’t reject cultivators. Why haven’t you accepted my offer?  Among cultivators, I, Qin, am not bad, am I? You know better than anyone how strong I am now.  While I can’t guarantee Nascent Soul stage cultivation, my chances are far greater than others.  Following me, how could it possibly disgrace you?”</p><p>Qin Sang sped through the air, looking down at the two-headed…creature.</p><p>He understood perfectly. The bond between him and the two-headed creature was deep. Leaving the green shadow was a repayment for the creature’s years of…grooming.</p><p>The two-headed creature flickered, darting into the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring to rest.</p><p>Qin Sang stroked his chin, summoned his avatar, and vanished into the vast ocean.</p><p>Months later.</p><p>Qin Sang visited Qu Heng Island for a few days before departing again, heading straight for Tian Xing Island without stopping.</p><p>After a long journey, he returned to Tian Xing Island.</p><p>A look of contemplation crossed Qin Sang’s face.  For safety, he sent his avatar into the Tian Shi Coffin and blended into the city as inconspicuously as possible.</p><p>After some investigation, Qin Sang learned that the teleportation array between Tian Xing Island and the Yao Hai Wild Island was operating normally, allowing free passage, though the spirit stones required were nearly 50% more expensive, causing widespread complaints.</p><p>Yao Hai was gradually returning to normal.</p><p>Of course, it was undoubtedly more dangerous than before the demonic chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang adopted the identity of Daoist Qingfeng and contacted people from the Qiong Yu Trading Company. He learned that Old Man Zou was still in Yao Hai and decided to visit him there after some time.</p><p>Previously, he had sent Old Man Zou a letter explaining that he needed to go into seclusion for a while.</p><p>They both needed to go to the Seven Killing Hall. Although their purposes differed, they might encounter each other inside and offer mutual support. He had also promised Old Man Zou to help him plan his trip to the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Before leaving, however, he needed to refine the Tian Shi Coffin again.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the market, went to the place where refining rooms were rented, and rented a high-quality one at a significant cost.</p><p>The stone room was only a little over ten feet square. In the center sat a bronze cauldron, beneath which was a magically sealed opening. Looking down, only a dark red glow was visible.</p><p>Even with the magical barrier, waves of heat could be felt rising from the ground.</p><p>A highly complex spirit formation was located at the opening.</p><p>Qin Sang first checked the refining room’s barriers, added a few more layers, instructed his avatar to provide protection, then sat cross-legged before the cauldron, taking out the Tian Shi Coffin and other materials, including the Black Yuan Gold.</p><p>He had mentally rehearsed the refining process countless times.</p><p>Qin Sang adjusted his condition to its peak and reached for the cauldron.</p><p>As his fingers touched the enchantment, the cauldron glowed brightly, emitting a low, humming sound.</p><p>Immediately, a blindingly bright crimson light flashed from the hole below, a wave of heat washing over him as if a fire dragon was surging upwards from the earth.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The room's barrier shuddered violently.  Qin Sang’s face was illuminated by the flames, his eyes narrowed slightly as he saw a raging fire erupt beneath the cauldron.</p><p>On closer inspection, the flames were not solid.</p><p>The spirit formation at the opening was also activated, emitting extremely pure fiery energy.</p><p>This energy was exceptionally stable, perfectly suited for refining weapons and pills.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard that the best subterranean magma veins were found in the Xu Ling Sect’s Mountain Within a Mountain in the Little Cold Region.  Due to the geographical features, this mountain had been continuously refined, resulting in extremely pure flames that required no such complex setup and possessed power comparable to spiritual flames.</p><p>Qin Sang dropped the Black Yuan Gold into the cauldron, activated the spirit formation, and patiently began the refining process.</p><p>Because the Tian Shi Coffin was already a magic treasure, the re-refinement was not difficult.  The process went very smoothly. In just one night, Qin Sang completed the re-refinement of the Tian Shi Coffin.</p><p>Numerous black patterns now adorned the surface of the Tian Shi Coffin, significantly increasing its defensive capabilities.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang did not stay in Tian Xing City long, immediately teleporting to Yao Hai. He was very cautious, wary of the Lan Dou Gate, but thankfully encountered no problems.</p><p>Two months later, Qin Sang met Old Man Zou on an island in Yao Hai.</p><p>Their reunion was filled with joy.</p><p>“Daoist, your seclusion lasted for decades, with no news, I was so worried,” Old Man Zou sighed, noticing that Qin Sang's cultivation seemed to have improved little. He wisely refrained from asking more.</p><p>“The Seven Killing Hall is about to open, and I haven't forgotten our agreement. Has Old Man Zou found any information?”</p><p>Qin Sang returned a bow and asked.</p><p>“In recent years, I've rarely managed the affairs of the Trading Company, focusing on gathering information. I've found some potentially useful details, but it’s hard to distinguish truth from falsehood…”</p><p>Old Man Zou shook his head and invited Qin Sang to sit down.</p><p>The two men sifted through the information, discerning truth from falsehood.</p><p>Qin Sang had only been to the Seven Killing Hall once, so he could only offer advice;  Old Man Zou would have to make his own decision.  Learning that Old Man Zou, like him last time, planned to enter the Seven Killing Hall using the East Pole Alliance's qualification, Qin Sang didn't say anything directly, only hinting at a few things.  With Old Man Zou's shrewdness, he would certainly understand.  Whether Old Man Zou would change his mind was beyond Qin Sang's control.</p><p>"I had planned to help you secure a place, but it seems you've already obtained a jade talisman elsewhere.  It seems we won't be traveling together in the Seven Killing Hall."</p><p>Old Man Zou was somewhat surprised. He had intended to invite Qin Sang along; after all, they had known each other for many years and he trusted Qin Sang more than others.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and sighed, "Old Man Zou must have noticed my cultivation issues.  I haven't made any progress for years, and there are several places I must go. The Seven Killing Hall is my only chance, and I can hardly focus on anything else until I resolve my own problems."</p><p>Old Man Zou nodded. "Then I can only wish you success and a safe return.  After entering the Seven Killing Hall, I will certainly explore those places.  If you successfully resolve your problems or encounter any difficulties, you can come find me.  Working together is always easier than facing challenges alone. I still have some savings; if you can help me find those few spirit herbs, the reward will not disappoint you."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded gently, "I will remember that."</p><p>Qin Sang stayed with Old Man Zou for a few more days, learning about the latest situation in the Demon Sea. They agreed to meet again at Tianxing Island before the Seven Killing Hall opened, then Qin Sang left, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The demons ceased their activities. After a brief lull, the human and witch clans resumed their expansion.  The previously severed sea routes were quickly reopened, and interaction between the two sides became increasingly frequent. It looked like it wouldn't be long before things returned to normal.</p><p>Three years passed peacefully.</p><p>Sea Toad Island. Once famous in the Demon Sea, because its island master, Sea Toad Ancestor, was a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator with a fearsome reputation.  During the demon unrest, Sea Toad Ancestor was forced to abandon the island.  After the unrest ended, he immediately returned with his disciples, and Sea Toad Island quickly prospered again.</p><p>At noon, a merchant ship docked at Sea Toad Island, and several witch cultivators disembarked.</p>
