<h1>Chapter 1910: Aftermath</h1><p>“Senior…”</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously approached.</p><p>Qing Zhu’s breath was very weak.</p><p>He wanted to help Qing Zhu up, but Qing Zhu waved him off.</p><p>Qing Zhu opened his eyes, his gaze bright and sharp. He glanced at Qin Sang, then at the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord sized Qing Zhu up and down, their gazes flickering, both remaining silent.</p><p>The blood coffin was suppressed, the three great demon-suppressing treasures appeared together, the seal fused with sword energy, all plunging into the black hole.</p><p>The blood-colored wall melted, and space was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang heard Qing Zhu’s voice in his ear, “Bring them over.”</p><p>Before Nan Gui Xianzi’s death, she had asked Qing Zhu to protect her descendants, lest they fall into the hands of Ling Zhuzi or the Demon Lord.</p><p>Seeing that Qing Zhu’s condition wasn't as bad as he'd imagined, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He dashed over, helped the young man and woman up, retrieved spirit pills from their pouches, gave them to them, and brought them to Qing Zhu.</p><p>The two barely suppressed their injuries, regaining the strength to move, and softly thanked Qin Sang.</p><p>Passing Su Nu.</p><p>Qin Sang bent down to check and found that Su Nu was still alive.</p><p>Perhaps because the ghost marks were controlled by the Demon Lord, Su Nu was actually protected by them and wasn't killed by the demonic roar.</p><p>Seeing that Su Nu was covered in ghost marks, Qin Sang hesitated, then looked up at the Demon Lord in the distance. The ghost seal was still in his hand.</p><p>Half of the Demon Lord's body was relatively normal, the other half withered and lifeless.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on the ground, desperately suppressing his injuries. He seemed no better off than Qing Zhu, and whether he could recover was uncertain.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's gaze, the Demon Lord's eyes swept over.</p><p>“Hehe… Cough! Cough!”</p><p>The Demon Lord had just let out a laugh when his breath violently surged.</p><p>He steadied his breath, glanced at Qing Zhu, his expression ambiguous, and said to Qin Sang, “Youngster, you have guts, daring to refine the vessel chosen by the ancient demon into a soul slave!”</p><p>Then, the Demon Lord grabbed the ghost seal, unexpectedly restoring it to its original form and throwing it to Qin Sang, disdaining to use it for blackmail.</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly stunned, caught the ghost seal, helped Su Nu up, and bowed, “Thank you, senior!”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled strangely, “Those others ran away like cowards, yet you dared to participate in the fight against the ancient demon.  You have courage. My forces are lacking an heir; would you be willing to join the Demon Isle?”</p><p>The Demon Lord surprisingly extended an offer to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Thank you for your kindness, senior.”</p><p>Qin Sang responded neither humbly nor arrogantly, “I will give it serious consideration.”</p><p>Having seen Qing Zhu in person, Qin Sang would certainly return to Xiao Han Domain with him. Whether or not he would return to Cang Lang Sea remained undecided.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn’t want to offend this Demon Lord, so he used ambiguous wording.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi interjected, “Why force him, Daoist friend? I observe that the young friend doesn’t seem to be of the demonic path. This sealing of the ancient demon was entirely thanks to this young friend and that Daoist friend. I don’t know your Daoist name?”</p><p>“I am Qing Zhu. I had no choice but to send an incarnation to hide in your sect. I hope you will not blame me.”</p><p>Qing Zhu's expression was calm and unperturbed as he spoke.</p><p>“It’s a trivial matter.”</p><p>Ling Zhuzi was unconcerned, his tone quite enthusiastic, “Daoist friend sent your incarnation to the Heavenly Dao Sect, so there is some connection between us.  Daoist friend Qing Zhu, do you have a place to stay? Feel free to choose a fine cave abode in the Heavenly Dao Sect. If it weren’t for your efforts, we would have all followed in the footsteps of the Great Witch Doctor. Please allow me to show my gratitude.”</p><p>“I’ll visit when we next have the chance.”</p><p>Qing Zhu remained noncommittal.</p><p>The Demon Lord suddenly stood up, said nothing, slowly retreated to the edge of the space, and disappeared.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi’s gaze shifted, his face filled with sorrow, “Nan Gui Xianzi sacrificed herself to feed the demon. You two should remember to take her remains. And that turtle shell, the Yaozu are all gone, it's ownerless and should rightfully belong to Daoist friend Qing Zhu…”</p><p>The young man went to pick up Nan Gui Xianzi’s only remaining possession, a refined spiritual sword, and grief struck again.</p><p>The young woman wept softly.</p><p>The young man put his arm around her and whispered words of comfort.</p><p>“Go pick it up.”</p><p>Qing Zhu glanced at the turtle shell, unmoved, casually giving it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang readily complied, going to pick up the turtle shell.</p><p>The turtle shell bore finger holes left by Qing Zhu, but this didn't affect its powerful defensive capabilities.</p><p>This treasure contained pure Xuan water power, carefully refined by the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle for countless years, its power was extraordinary. With a little refinement, it would become a top-tier defensive treasure.</p><p>Qingzhu wasn't interested; he coveted the tortoise shell, noticing it earlier but hesitant to act with so many powerful individuals present.</p><p>"Thank you, seniors," Qin Sang said happily, putting it away.</p><p>Lingzhuzi, seeing Qingzhu's unresponsiveness, narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, a wave of energy rippled through the air.  An elder, having just repaired an ancient barrier, rushed back, his face etched with worry.</p><p>"Grandmaster!"</p><p>A young man and woman ran to him, finally breaking down in tears, recounting the events.</p><p>Seeing the spirit swords they presented, the elder trembled, appearing suddenly much older. He carefully took the swords, gazing at them for a long time before letting out a barely audible sigh.</p><p>Lingzhuzi approached, saying gravely, "The leaders of the three major trading alliances have all fallen to the ancient demons, leaving them leaderless.  With Mou Lao Mo's death and the Demon Lord shattering the Taiyin Heavenly Ghost God's light, I've exhausted my essence using a blood refining technique. I must retreat to heal, and my next tribulation is uncertain.  Humanity needs a strong leader to stabilize the situation and deter the wicked.  What are your thoughts, friends?"</p><p>"I am a hermit, unwilling to involve myself in worldly affairs. I will not trouble you further. Qin Sang, let's go."</p><p>Qingzhu turned to leave.</p><p>At that moment, the young man and elder whispered together, then ran to Qin Sang, handing her a token.  "Thank you for your protection, senior and Daoist Qin. I am Bao Zhengnan, and this is my younger sister, Bao Xi.  Despite not reaching peak Golden Core cultivation, your power is immense. My sister and I admire you greatly.  We hope you will visit the Four Saints Palace in the future. Activate this token in the far north of the Rain Desert; I will sense it and come to greet you."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Qingzhu, who remained silent. She accepted the token and thanked them.</p><p>The Four Saints Palace was incredibly secretive, founded by the Four Saints' direct disciples. They controlled the inner palace's ancient barriers and possessed many secrets, including countless ancient texts and secret techniques left behind by the Four Saints.</p><p>Both righteous and demonic cultivators feared the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>Possessing this token couldn't hurt.</p><p>"Could you do me a favor...?"</p><p>Qin Sang remembered something and gave Su Nu to Bao Zhengnan. "She also contributed to defeating the ancient demons. Her soul isn't extinguished, and she should awaken soon. Would you be able to send her away?"</p><p>"Certainly,"</p><p>Bao Zhengnan immediately had Bao Xi hold Su Nu and produced a protective talisman to prevent her from being harmed by the Zhenling Domain's restrictions. "Where should she be sent?"</p>
