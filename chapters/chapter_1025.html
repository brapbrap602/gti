<h1>Chapter 1117 Descendants</h1><p>The four stepped into the golden passage and walked through it.</p><p>The old woman, leaning on her cane, walked slowly and spoke softly, "When you come here in the future, follow the same steps, without the slightest error."</p><p>The young man and woman both responded in agreement.</p><p>At this moment, the old man beside them sighed and said, "The Inner Sanctum appears earlier each time. If this continues, by their time, who knows what the situation will become.  Our ancestors probably didn't foresee this change in the Seven Kill Sanctum. If the Seven Kill Sanctum truly emerges and they have enough time to break the Immortal Prohibition, relying solely on us, their incompetent descendants, we won't be able to completely prevent the Wu Clan from exploring."</p><p>"Brother, why worry so much? Our descendants will have their own fortunes. The Ancestor didn't task us with protecting humanity. We only need to carry out the Ancestor's instructions.  There are many powerful figures in the human race, and we still have the upper hand on the surface. Even if the Seven Kill Sanctum emerges, the Wu Clan won't gain much advantage."</p><p>The old woman paused, tapping her cane, her voice echoing in the passage.</p><p>"Besides, didn't we carefully check last time? The Immortal Prohibition is completely normal, and the restrictions left by the Ancestor haven't been affected by the early emergence."</p><p>The young man and woman exchanged glances, confused by what they heard, but they didn't dare ask more, obediently following behind.</p><p>After walking for a while,</p><p>the four reached the end of the passage.</p><p>Seeing the scene ahead, the young man and woman were instantly astonished.</p><p>In the center of the cloud mass, there was a floating mountain.</p><p>The floating mountain hovered in midair. It wasn't large, but it was lush and green, surrounded by immortal clouds.</p><p>Clear springs flowed, and winding streams surrounded pavilions.</p><p>Who would have thought that within the dangerous Inner Sanctum, there would be such a peaceful and vibrant place, like an immortal's cave abode.</p><p>The two elders, however, were not surprised at all. They walked out of the passage with calm expressions and flew towards the floating mountain.</p><p>The young man and woman recovered from their shock and hurriedly followed.</p><p>Soon, the four landed in front of a wooden hall in the forest.</p><p>The wooden hall stood alone, surrounded by overgrown weeds and accumulated fallen leaves, appearing desolate in the deep and quiet forest.</p><p>The old woman paused, lightly tapping her cane downwards. An invisible wave emanated, instantly clearing the surrounding weeds and fallen leaves.</p><p>The other elder walked to the wooden hall and gently pushed open the wooden door.</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>Light shone into the hall, dispelling the darkness.</p><p>Unexpectedly, inside was a teleportation formation.</p><p>The four stepped onto the formation, and with a flash of light, they appeared in a dark cave. A chill swept over them, causing the young man and woman to shiver.  They secretly circulated their cultivation techniques, dispelling the cold after a full cycle.</p><p>‘Drip!’</p><p>The sound of dripping water came from ahead.</p><p>After hurrying forward for a while, they were stunned by the sight before them.</p><p>Ahead was a circular cavern. It was very damp, with water droplets clinging to the stone walls, occasionally dripping down.  The chill they had felt earlier emanated from this cavern.</p><p>In the center of the cavern was a raised platform.</p><p>On the platform was a square object with handles on both sides.  A closer look revealed it to be a stone cauldron.</p><p>The two elders flashed forward, flying onto the platform and glancing inside the stone cauldron. The stone walls of the cauldron were also covered in water droplets, and a thin layer of clear water had accumulated at the bottom.</p><p>This clear water emanated a bone-chilling coldness, but it hadn't frozen.</p><p>The old woman looked up and said solemnly, "There's only half the usual amount of spirit liquid."</p><p>The old man nodded, "It's normal for it to accumulate this much. It's only been a little over a hundred years since the last emergence of the Inner Sanctum."</p><p>At this time, the young man and woman also walked up, curiously looking at the rough stone cauldron and the spirit liquid inside.</p><p>"Ancestor, is this the Soul Cleansing Liquid? Why is it growing in a stone cauldron?"</p><p>The young man couldn't help but ask.</p><p>"This spirit liquid isn't the Soul Cleansing Liquid yet. It's a crucial ingredient needed to refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  It needs to be combined with several other spirit herbs. Fortunately, the other spirit herbs aren't particularly rare."</p><p>The old man explained kindly, "However, this particular spirit liquid can only be found here. This place seems to have originally been an underground cold spring with unique properties. Now that the spring has dried up, only the restriction within the stone cauldron can slowly refine this special spirit liquid within the cavern.  This liquid contains the purest energy, which can be used to refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  Step back now and carefully observe our hand seals for refining the Soul Cleansing Liquid. Memorize all the steps."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The young man and woman retreated to the bottom of the platform, their expressions tense as they stared at the hands of the two elders, not blinking.</p><p>"Junior Sister, let's begin."</p><p>The old man brushed his hand over the pouch at his waist, and several jade boxes flew out one after another, each containing different spirit herbs – spirit flowers, spirit fruits, and more.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>With a gentle tap, the old man sent the spirit herbs into the cauldron.</p><p>Immediately, both elders extended their palms, pressing them against the sides of the stone cauldron, channeling their True Essence into it.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The stone cauldron trembled, emitting a muffled sound.</p><p>Then, mystical runes shimmered on the surface of the cauldron with a strange luster. The previous roughness vanished, replaced by a mysterious aura.</p><p>The two elders' fingers moved like wheels, dazzlingly fast, as they imprinted hand seals into the cauldron.  Strange light filled the inside of the cauldron, constantly changing. Restrictions fluctuated, and a chaotic scene unfolded, obscuring the spirit herbs within.</p><p>At the same time, a fragrant aroma wafted from the cauldron.</p><p>After a while, the fragrance gradually faded, leaving only a faint, lingering, and chilly aroma.</p><p>"Collect!"</p><p>The old man shouted softly, and both of them withdrew their palms simultaneously, glancing inside the stone cauldron with smiles.</p><p>Then, the old man took out a jade bottle and, using his True Essence, transferred a small portion of the Soul Cleansing Liquid into it.  To the surprise of the young man and woman, he put the jade bottle away.</p><p>"Grand Ancestor, why leave so much behind?"</p><p>The young man asked, his face full of confusion.</p><p>The old man replied, "This is an ancestral instruction. Furthermore, due to the restrictions within the cauldron, each time we refine the Soul Cleansing Liquid, we can only take a portion. The remaining Soul Cleansing Liquid must be sent to the Trial Realm as a reward."</p><p>"The Trial Realm? Is that for those people waiting at the entrance of the Inner Sanctum when we entered?"</p><p>The young woman pouted, reluctant, "The cold spring was discovered by our ancestors, and the other spirit herbs were painstakingly cultivated by you, Grand Ancestors. We are not related to them, so why give so much Soul Cleansing Liquid to strangers? Giving them one-third... no, even one-tenth is too much!"</p><p>Hearing this, the two elders exchanged smiles.</p><p>"You greedy girl!"</p><p>The old woman tapped the young woman, "The Soul Cleansing Liquid and the Trial Realm were both established by our four ancestors to ensure the continuation and prosperity of our human race.  With these arrangements, our human race can continuously produce talented individuals and suppress the Wu Clan, keeping them confined to the Wu Divine Continent for so many years. How can your small mind comprehend the grand vision of our ancestors?"</p>
