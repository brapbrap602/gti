<h1>Chapter 1651: The Sunfire Divine Prohibition</h1><p>Thunder rumbled like drums.</p><p>Through his Heavenly Eye divine ability, Qin Sang 'saw' the purple light soaring behind him, along with countless lightning serpents coursing through the sea of clouds, almost forming a realm of thunder.  Occasionally, the resounding cry of a crane echoed across the vast expanse.</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren and He Gao Zhenren's attacks were truly earth-shattering.</p><p>Immediately after, the purple light suddenly dimmed, and within the lightning, black lotuses continuously materialized and vanished. It seemed that Old Devil Fan had intervened, likely persuaded by Zhu Wudao's unknown offer.</p><p>Regardless of the outcome of their battle, Qin Sang couldn't afford to worry about others for now.  His first priority was shaking off his pursuers.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao seemed fixated on him, relentlessly giving chase.</p><p>Their escape techniques were inferior to Qin Sang's, and the distance between them gradually widened. However, Mount Di Shou wasn't boundless. The airspace-restricting flying swords patrolled ceaselessly, and the mountain itself was riddled with layers of restrictions.</p><p>In this place, Qin Sang couldn't fully utilize his escape techniques.  Shaking them off would require some effort.</p><p>If it were only Su Zinan alone, Qin Sang wouldn't hesitate to find a suitable location to confront him. Having just slain two great cultivators, his momentum was at its peak.</p><p>Although his opponents still numbered two, the situation was different now.</p><p>Previously, he and his avatar had joined forces, utilizing the remnants of the Ice Palace formation to their advantage, combined with an ambush. Furthermore, they were undisturbed during the battle, which had allowed them to succeed.</p><p>He knew nothing about Mount Di Shou. Where could he find advantageous terrain to leverage?</p><p>Moreover, his avatar hadn't arrived yet.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed that his avatar, having taken advantage of the mountain's shifting formations, had entered the grand formation and was making its way towards his main body with all its might. However, even with Zhu Wudao's tampering, the grand formation of Mount Di Shou was not easily traversed. He couldn't rely on his avatar for the time being.</p><p>"First, find a way to shake them off..."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed with sharp focus. As his thoughts raced, he noticed the clouds ahead gradually thinning, finally revealing the scenery atop the divine mountain.</p><p>The most striking feature was undoubtedly the towering jade staircase that ascended straight into the heavens, a veritable celestial ladder.</p><p>According to Zhu Wudao, the Wordless Jade Wall was located at the summit of this staircase, also the peak of Mount Di Shou.</p><p>Pavilions, waterside terraces, clear springs, and cascading waterfalls adorned both sides of the jade staircase, presenting a picturesque immortal landscape. Were it not for the current disturbance of the grand formation and the disruption of Mount Di Shou's tranquility, it would be an ideal place for secluded cultivation.</p><p>The celestial ladder didn't originate at the foot of the mountain but rather from its mid-slopes.</p><p>From Qin Sang's current position, even with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's exceptional vision, he couldn't clearly discern the ladder's starting point. This was due to a bizarre region in between, shimmering with vibrant colors and swirling clouds, forming a colorful ring that enshrouded the peak, isolating all perception.</p><p>Below this region lay a white jade plaza, from which numerous staircases radiated downwards, winding their way down the mountain. Each seemed to lead directly to the base.</p><p>Refined dwellings and ancient halls were also built along these staircases, but their grandeur was noticeably inferior to those above.</p><p>These staircases commemorated the ascended sages of the Formless Immortal Sect. Each staircase corresponded to a jade gate, a new one carved for every virtuous individual who emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of the underlying reasons, found this strange. Why would the Formless Immortal Sect construct so many seemingly useless staircases?  However, he didn't dwell on this question, instead shifting his gaze to the bizarre region between the plaza and the halls.</p><p>He deemed it 'bizarre' because, even with his cultivation and experience, Qin Sang couldn't accurately determine the extent of that region.  Its boundaries appeared distinct, yet its interior seemed vast and boundless.</p><p>This contradictory sensation wasn't an illusion, Qin Sang knew.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A streak of escaping light pierced the sea of clouds and flew into the plaza, revealing Qin Sang's figure.</p><p>He swiftly scanned the bizarre region. Within the multicolored clouds, various strange lights interweaved, exuding an extremely sharp and formidable aura.</p><p>While the spiritual light within constantly shifted, careful observation revealed uniform colors deep within certain sections of the clouds, profound and unfathomable, clearly not a place to be trifled with.</p><p>A piercing sound of breaking air came from behind.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, his eyes meeting Su Zinan's grim gaze.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's path blocked, Su Zinan sneered, "Let's see how much further you can run!"</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow.  "Fellow Daoist Su, there's no deep-seated hatred between us. Why are you so insistent?"</p><p>As he spoke, he utilized his divine sense and Heavenly Eye divine ability to perceive the shifting aura within the light and shadows.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>Su Zinan snorted coldly, his killing intent undiminished, his pressure unrelenting. "Hand over the treasures you stole from the snowy plains, and I might consider sparing your life!"</p><p>He inwardly cursed his luck. Earlier, when Qin Sang was surrounded by four, he hadn't seized the opportunity and had instead exposed his murderous intent towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang feigned sudden understanding, laughing mockingly. "So True Monarch Luye considers that tomb his personal domain? I entered the snowy plains openly.  You're not a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, so what right do you have to demand those treasures from me! Furthermore, even if it were a matter of killing for treasure, you've targeted the wrong person. You should seek out Old Man Yanshan. He is the true Water Phase inheritor, having lurked and plotted near the snowy plains for years. I was also a victim of his schemes back then.  He's the one who absconded with the treasures from the tomb."</p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Zinan laughed coldly. "Even Old Wu wasn't your match back then. Old Ghost Yanshan is only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage. Wouldn't he have been at your mercy?  Enough with the nonsense. Hand over the treasures!"</p><p>"As expected of a Transformation cultivator's descendant, such impressive authority!"</p><p>Qin Sang laughed, his voice laced with anger.</p><p>Before his laughter subsided, Qin Sang transformed into a bolt of lightning once more, traversing the plaza and plunging headlong into the bizarre, colorful clouds.</p><p>Seeing his decisive action, Su Zinan was momentarily stunned, his expression turning grim.  He called out to Mo Xingdao, intending to pursue, but Mo Xingdao stopped at the edge of the clouds.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mo?"</p><p>Su Zinan's eyes flashed like lightning as he frowned at him.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stared at the clouds, his voice grave. "This divine prohibition is linked to the grand formation of Mount Di Shou. Judging by the outward appearance of these clouds, their danger surpasses even the outer mists. This man is proficient in Lightning Escape techniques and was able to overpower Old Wu. Without Old Devil Fan's assistance, it's impossible to capture him. Are you certain you want to continue the pursuit, Fellow Daoist Su?"</p><p>"Unexpectedly, Fellow Daoist Mo also possesses remarkable knowledge in formations and prohibitions," Su Zinan's expression softened as he explained, "He, like us, is new to this place, completely unfamiliar with the surroundings. While his escape technique is powerful, there's not much room for him to maneuver within the clouds. This is, in fact, the best opportunity to eliminate him. Once he leaves this place, it will truly be like releasing a tiger back into the mountains, beyond anyone's control.  I won't act recklessly and put you in danger. I'll handle his divine abilities myself. Fellow Daoist, be prepared to deliver the fatal blow!"</p><p>Seeing Su Zinan's confident tone, Mo Xingdao remained skeptical but ultimately followed him, chasing after Qin Sang in the direction he had fled, disappearing into the depths of the colorful light.</p><p>The three departed one after another.</p><p>At the edge of the plaza, the two from the Jade Platform Sect emerged from an abandoned dwelling.</p><p>"Such speed!"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist wiped away his cold sweat.  They had just arrived and were preparing to enter the Five Elements Divine Prohibition.  Fortunately, they reacted quickly enough and concealed themselves, otherwise their presence would have been discovered by the three.</p><p>In that case, whether the others would continue their fight or reach a tacit agreement to capture and interrogate them first was uncertain.</p><p>The female Daoist looked toward the clouds, discerning the direction based on her senior brother's guidance, and her expression suddenly turned anxious. "Senior Brother, the direction they're headed seems to be the Sunfire Divine Prohibition area. What should we do?"</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Finally managed to sort things out. I started writing too late today after figuring out the plot, so only one chapter.</p>
