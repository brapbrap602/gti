<h1>Chapter 1671: The Thunder Lord</h1><p>The Eight Scenery Palace Lantern is to the Eight Scenery View what the Celestial昊 Mirror is to the Celestial昊 Tower.</p><p>However, Zilei Zhenren's lantern wasn't the true Eight Scenery Palace Lantern, but his Natal Magic Treasure.</p><p>The true Eight Scenery Palace Lantern was the foundation of the Eight Scenery View's protective grand formation. If anything untoward happened, it could directly sever the earth veins, relocate the entire palace, and preserve the core strength of the sect.</p><p>Transcending the mundane world, awaiting a future resurgence.</p><p>Similar to Lu Laomo's Deer Domain, but superior in every aspect.</p><p>With the ancestral precepts in mind, Zilei Zhenren absolutely wouldn't dare take this lantern out of the mountain gate. If any accident occurred outside, he would become a sinner of the Eight Scenery View.</p><p>With this lantern, the Eight Scenery View possessed an unshakeable foundation for eternity.</p><p>But if they truly did so, the Eight Scenery View would need to abandon its external holdings, destroying years of meticulous work in a single day. Becoming a secluded sect, how difficult would it be to regain their current grandeur? The price would be incredibly steep.</p><p>As the View Master of the Eight Scenery View, how could Zilei Zhenren allow the sect to decline under his leadership?</p><p>The replica treasure possessed all the powers of the original, able to resonate with the true Eight Scenery Palace Lantern. Every generation's View Master chose a replica as their Natal Magic Treasure; this was the responsibility they had to bear.</p><p>Unfortunately, Zilei Zhenren's lightning techniques were peerless, but his path didn't align with the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern. This Natal Magic Treasure had become a hindrance.</p><p>He had been stuck at the Nascent Soul bottleneck for many years, and it wasn't unrelated to his Natal Magic Treasure.</p><p>This problem wasn't difficult to solve. There had been precedents in the Eight Scenery View. A trip to the Sword Tomb would suffice.</p><p>A confluence of these factors led to the scheme involving the Immortal Hall.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren was currently demonstrating two of the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern's powers.</p><p>The first was called the Shadow-Reflecting Heart Lantern.</p><p>The profound lantern illuminates, leaving imprints of the heart.</p><p>This way, one could capture the target's movements and establish a connection through their Qi.</p><p>However, the power of Zilei Zhenren's lantern was ultimately inferior to the sect's lantern.  Facing an opponent of similar cultivation like Zhu Wudao, leaving an imprint without being detected was extremely difficult.</p><p>On the precipice, their hasty clash had failed to create an imprint.</p><p>After experiencing the battle at the teleportation formation and the subsequent chase through the mountains, two intense battles, he finally managed to lock onto Zhu Wudao while the latter's mind was in turmoil.</p><p>After entering the mountain, Zilei Zhenren remained hidden, secretly observing Zhu Wudao's movements through the Shadow-Reflecting Heart Lantern, letting him lead the way.</p><p>Naturally, this connection had limitations and couldn't reveal every detail.</p><p>Sensing Zhu Wudao had stopped in one location within the mountain's belly for too long, Zilei Zhenren deduced that Zhu Wudao had found his target and immediately launched his attack.</p><p>The second power was the Profound Crossing Rainbow Bridge.</p><p>Using the connection established by the Heart Lantern, the Rainbow Bridge could be summoned, allowing Zilei Zhenren to traverse the void and directly reach his destination.</p><p>Unless there was an exceptionally powerful formation barrier to sever the connection.  Mount Disou was rife with wind and evil煞, and chaotic formations, none of which posed an obstacle.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Rainbow Bridge landed directly in front of Zhu Wudao.</p><p>The Celestial昊 Mirror had already vanished without a trace.</p><p>In an instant, the rainbow light faded, and Zilei Zhenren stepped out, his gaze cold and piercing as he stared directly at Zhu Wudao.</p><p>With such unexpected turns of events, even with Zhu Wudao's firm resolve, he couldn't help but feel a shiver of fear.</p><p>Fan Laomo was one thing, only using the Celestial昊 Mirror to locate him and unsettling his mind with words. His true body should still be outside. But Zilei Zhenren had directly driven to the heart of the matter, catching him completely off guard.</p><p>The Eight Scenery Palace Lantern floated above Zilei Zhenren's head. The lantern had eight sides, each depicting a wondrous scene, an immortal realm, with a myriad of breathtaking sights.</p><p>Profound light draped down like tassels, surrounding Zilei Zhenren, repelling the surrounding gray mist.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren's gaze fell upon Zhu Wudao, causing him to freeze, a strong sense of foreboding rising within him. He immediately alerted the Demon Son through the idol in his sleeve.</p><p>Then, Zilei Zhenren swept his gaze across the surroundings, taking in the scene within the mountain's belly. He was immediately drawn to the seal below.</p><p>What Fan Laomo could discern about the relationship between the Five Elements Divine Restriction and the Five Elements Crown naturally couldn't escape Zilei Zhenren's discerning eye.  Since the method to control the spiritual treasure was hidden within the Five Elements Divine Restriction, why bother wasting words with Zhu Wudao?</p><p>Zilei Zhenren remained silent, his mind made up.  Just as he was about to act, he suddenly sensed something, his gaze sharpening like a blade as he stared at Zhu Wudao's sleeve. “What are you doing?”</p><p>His voice boomed like thunder, a profound Daoist shout.</p><p>Those with weaker cultivation would have their mental defenses shattered and be instantly subdued.</p><p>He's been discovered!</p><p>Zhu Wudao's heart trembled violently. He hadn't expected Zilei Zhenren's perception to be so acute.  Not daring to hold onto any illusions, he didn't argue, only urgently calling out in his mind: “Help me!”</p><p>Blinding golden light erupted.</p><p>Golden armor enveloped Zhu Wudao's body. A roar like a celestial dragon's fury erupted from his throat, the roar carrying tangible sound waves that surged towards Zilei Zhenren.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren's expression darkened.  The Eight Scenery Palace Lantern blazed brightly, not only dispelling all the gray darkness but also overshadowing the golden armor's brilliance.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Palace Lantern swayed gently, rising higher and shining even brighter, spinning faster.</p><p>As the lantern rotated, the light didn't become chaotic.  Instead, wondrous scenes materialized from within, the very scenes depicted on the lantern, projected into reality.</p><p>Moreover, the eight illusory scenes were no longer distinct.</p><p>Mountains and seas, heaven and earth.</p><p>The vast starry sky, the complex mortal realm.</p><p>Clearly distinct illusions, yet they seamlessly merged without any sense of incongruity, unfolding around Zilei Zhenren.</p><p>These scenes were naturally illusory. Wherever the illusions covered, Zilei Zhenren's power extended, manipulating the heavens and earth to a certain degree, drawing them into this space. Anyone who fell into this realm would be beneath him, subject to his control.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators were an exception.  No matter how perfect, illusions were still illusions. Zilei Zhenren's realm was limited, unlike a Nascent Soul cultivator's true communion with heaven and earth.</p><p>However, it was more than enough to deal with Zhu Wudao.</p><p>The lantern's illusions spread, like a small world projected onto this space.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's roar passed through, entering the lantern's illusory realm unimpeded.  However, it was met with layers upon layers of illusory obstacles, preventing it from reaching Zilei Zhenren.</p><p>On the other hand, Zilei Zhenren, indifferent to the roar, his eyes gleaming with profound light, formed a hand seal and pressed towards Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Instantly, the various illusions surged down like a vast torrent, about to engulf Zhu Wudao. The Qi of the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern had already locked him down.</p><p>Even through the golden armor, Zhu Wudao still felt an immense sense of restriction, his heart sinking.</p><p>His reaction was somewhat unexpected to Zilei Zhenren.  He didn't attempt to break through the Qi lock, nor did he flee from the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern's range. Instead, he shattered the rock beneath his feet and plunged downwards.</p><p>But considering the nearly completed formation on the seal's surface, as well as the strange aura surrounding Zhu Wudao, Zilei Zhenren quickly reacted.</p><p>His fingers transformed into a sword, a lightning sword flashing into existence.</p><p>Seizing and Slaying the Six Rhythms!</p><p>A net of lightning, or rather, a net of swords, suddenly condensed around Zhu Wudao, as if space itself was shattering.  Lightning and sword Qi intertwined, easily slicing through the golden light on the outer layer of the golden armor.</p><p>The golden armor dimmed, sword intent piercing to the bone.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>A clear sword cry emanated from within Zhu Wudao's body.</p><p>In an instant, golden light blazed.</p><p>This golden light was unrelated to the golden armor.  It was a golden rainbow shooting out from the crown of Zhu Wudao's head. Within the rainbow was a sword.</p><p>The sword was less than three inches long, yet its sharpness was unparalleled.</p><p>This sword strike not only contained soaring sword Qi but also Zhu Wudao's accumulated sword intent.  Any discerning eye could tell that this was one of the rarest, most powerful sword techniques in existence.</p><p>“The Taiyuan Golden Gang Sword Scripture!”</p><p>Zilei Zhenren's pupils constricted.</p><p>The Taiyuan Golden Gang Sword Scripture, a heritage of the Gold Aspect lineage of the Formless Immortal Sect, unmatched in its ferocity.</p><p>The sword transformed into a golden rainbow, its power surpassing even the Seizing and Slaying the Six Rhythms. This wasn't because Zhu Wudao's cultivation exceeded Zilei Zhenren's. It was because the Taiyuan Golden Gang Sword focused its power on a single point, piercing through the net of lightning and swords to carve a path.</p><p>The Seizing and Slaying the Six Rhythms momentarily faltered, giving Zhu Wudao enough time to react. The golden armor swelled, manifesting the phantom of a golden armored warrior that possessed Zhu Wudao, forcibly resisting the onslaught of lightning swords as he plummeted downwards.</p><p>The golden rainbow continued unabated, piercing towards the sky, aiming to shatter the lantern's illusions.</p><p>Unfortunately, his goal was difficult to achieve.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren snorted coldly.  The lantern's illusions reversed and layered, suddenly becoming several times denser. The golden rainbow pierced in, but its power had already been diminished by the net of lightning and swords.  Ultimately, it was trapped by the illusions, vanishing completely as the illusory realm undulated.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The torrent of illusions surged downwards with unstoppable force.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren's control was incredibly precise.  The lantern's illusions didn't impact the five-colored seal in the slightest, instead spreading across its surface.</p><p>Zhu Wudao was pulled into the lantern's illusions without any resistance.  But his objective had been achieved.  His feet landed on the formation, coming into direct contact with the seal.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren sensed something amiss and naturally wouldn't give him the opportunity to complete the formation. The Eight Scenery Palace Lantern materialized above the illusions, its light like a bright moon, pinning Zhu Wudao in the center of the illusory realm.  Terrifying pressure converged from all directions.</p><p>However, Zhu Wudao had anticipated this. He hadn't directly attempted to complete the seal.  Anyone who dared to be distracted in front of Zilei Zhenren would be left with nothing but bones.</p><p>He had personally delivered the idol down. Although the passage wasn't fully formed, it could still serve a purpose.</p><p>The Demon Son had been waiting.  A powerful force surged through the passage, entering the idol within Zhu Wudao's sleeve.  The blood-red color in the idol's eyes deepened, gradually taking on a strange glint as it pressed tightly against Zhu Wudao.</p><p>In the next moment, a crimson flush rose on Zhu Wudao's face, his hair scattering wildly, his black robe billowing as his aura surged.</p><p>The spiritual sword, resonating with its master's intent, also let out a clear cry.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The spiritual sword sang, a golden rainbow even more brilliant than before piercing the sky, its target clear: Zilei Zhenren himself!</p><p>Zhu Wudao abruptly raised his head, his eyes transformed into purple pupils, as if containing a boundless demonic realm, utterly bizarre.</p><p>His gaze was like lightning, piercing through the layers of illusions, striking Zilei Zhenren's mind like a heavy hammer.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren's expression shifted drastically.  An unprecedented sense of crisis enveloped him.  Those purple pupils were like sharp swords, penetrating his mental defenses, making him feel as if his mind was being pulled in.</p><p>He had no doubt that if his mind was captured by those purple pupils, he would be utterly lost.</p><p>They were clearly demonic eyes!</p><p>Was this still a descendant of the Gold Aspect?</p><p>Of the five lineages of the Formless Immortal Sect, the Gold Aspect lineage were the purest sword cultivators, untainted by external paths, especially wary of demonic arts.</p><p>Perhaps this was why the remnants of the Gold Aspect lineage had chosen to hide within the Celestial昊 Tower.</p><p>Even if the descendants of the Gold Aspect had to cultivate the Celestial昊 Tower's demonic techniques to conceal themselves, a true inheritor like Zhu Wudao couldn't truly change his allegiance. Why was his mastery of the demonic path so profound, seemingly surpassing his swordsmanship?</p><p>Moreover, as far as Zilei Zhenren knew, the Celestial昊 Tower didn't possess such purple-eyed demonic techniques!</p><p>Just how many secrets was Zhu Wudao hiding!</p><p>Fortunately, Zilei Zhenren hadn't expected to suppress Zhu Wudao with the Eight Scenery Palace Lantern alone.</p><p>“Purple Lightning of the Heavens, empower me!”</p><p>A grand voice, like the divine pronouncements that summoned deities, shook the minds of all who heard it, compelling them to kneel.</p><p>Zhu Wudao faltered, ripples appearing in his purple pupils for the first time. Within the illusions, amongst the stars, Zilei Zhenren stood suspended in the air, streaks of purple lightning crisscrossing the heavens as the illusory realm transformed into a domain of lightning.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren stood at the center of the sky, boundless purple lightning surging around him without harming him in the slightest. Instead, it converged towards him, forming a crown of purple lightning above his head.</p><p>The crown slowly descended.</p><p>And a robe of lightning clad his body.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren became awe-inspiring and terrifying, transforming into the Thunder Lord!</p><p>…</p><p>As they clashed, the Celestial昊 Mirror reappeared on another side of the mountain's belly.</p><p>Fan Laomo was pleased to see Zilei Zhenren and Zhu Wudao locked in a stalemate, a perfect opportunity for him to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>At this time, Fan Laomo's true body was also rapidly approaching the summit. With the Celestial昊 Mirror's guidance, he didn't need to worry about getting lost in the wind and evil煞. The closer he got, the clearer the image reflected in the mirror talisman became.</p><p>Within the mountain's belly, the mirror's surface seemed embedded in the stone wall, its light dim, its fluctuations minimized.</p><p>Remotely controlling the mirror, Fan Laomo could clearly see the details of the seal, making a new discovery.</p><p>This surprised him greatly.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Restriction converged here, forming a seal rather than the imagined spiritual pool for nurturing spiritual treasures. What was sealed beneath?</p><p>Or perhaps…</p><p>His thoughts raced.  Fan Laomo didn't dare act rashly. After observing for a while, he formed a single-handed seal and struck his chest with a powerful palm.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Fan Laomo's figure trembled, a mouthful of blood spraying out, completely absorbed by the mirror talisman.</p><p>Stained with blood, the Celestial昊 Mirror within the mountain's belly transformed into a blood mirror, like a crimson disc, gently falling and meticulously choosing a location before pressing tightly against the seal's surface.</p><p>Then, the ancient mirror began to melt, blood light slowly spreading.  A closer look revealed countless blood threads extending from the mirror's surface, piercing the five-colored seal, specifically targeting the points where the five colors connected.</p><p>This wasn't an attempt to break the seal but a silent infiltration, one of the Celestial昊 Mirror's most potent abilities.</p><p>Fan Laomo didn't know what lay beneath the seal. Sealed here by the Formless Immortal Sect with such care, even after all these years, he remained cautious, choosing to investigate using this method first.</p><p>Because the seal primarily targeted the demonic being within, coupled with Zhu Wudao's prior actions of shattering the jade pavilion, disrupting the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, and using the idol to construct a passage, thereby weakening the seal, the Celestial昊 Mirror's infiltration proved quite effective.</p><p>At the summit of Mount Disou.</p><p>Fan Laomo had stopped at some point, sitting cross-legged atop a black lotus, the Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus.</p><p>After meditating for a moment, Fan Laomo suddenly closed his eyes.  The nether lotus trembled gently, its petals closing inwards layer by layer.</p><p>As the petals closed, Fan Laomo's figure shifted from solid to ethereal, eventually transforming into a wisp of mist, enveloped within the now bud-like Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A black light shot out from the lotus's heart, directly into the mirror talisman.</p><p>Simultaneously, a black speck of light appeared at the center of the Celestial昊 Mirror within the mountain's belly, clearly a Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus.</p><p>As the Celestial昊 Mirror gradually infiltrated the seal, the Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus followed suit.</p><p>The Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus was Fan Laomo's Natal Magic Treasure, signifying his Dao foundation as the Illusion Demonic Path. He was a master of this path. Combined with the Celestial昊 Mirror, it displayed不可思议 abilities.</p>
