<h1>Chapter 1846: The Ancient Tree</h1><p>The Tianmin Cleansing Incantation!</p><p>Facing imminent danger, the young female Daoist priestess focused on her master while countering the attack.  This woman was her master, Ruquan Zhenren, the senior abbess of the Jingquan Temple. The young priestess watched intently, afraid to miss a single movement of her master's ritual.  This incantation was a secret, powerful spell passed down through the Jingquan Temple, one only Grand Masters of the Five Talisman Positions could skillfully perform. Although she was already at the late Dongxuan cultivation level, she could barely manage it, requiring the summoning of her altar, her spirit soldiers, and the precise steps of the ritual to perform it. Before her master reduced her cultivation, she didn't need to summon her spirit soldiers or even chant; a simple gesture was enough. Now, even she finds it less effortless, needing to chant mantras to evoke spiritual energy.  However, this allows the young priestess to better understand Ruquan Zhenren's mastery of the incantation and learn more from it.</p><p>As for the surrounding dangers, the young priestess wasn't worried, seeing her master's calm demeanor.  Unless all the demons inhabiting the ritual altar converged here to ambush them.</p><p>The incantation conjured pure spring water, like water without roots, appearing out of thin air and surrounding them.  Even with the foul miasma swirling around, it couldn’t approach them.</p><p>Ruquan Zhenren's incantation resolved the immediate crisis for the other priestesses.  All highly skilled and experienced warriors, they reacted instantly, their bodies glowing with light emanating from their altars.  </p><p>The four were all descendants of Daoist temples, their practices passed down from their masters, differing from the three officials of the Daoist court. The young priestess's altar held a clear spring, the true form of the Jingquan Temple's unique purifying spring technique. The other three priestesses had different techniques: one manifested crimson cinnabar talismans, another had a jade staff growing within her altar, and the last a golden elixir the size of a dragon's eye.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed differences between their techniques. The jade staff was real, while the other three manifestations were somewhat illusory, showing the jade staff’s owner cultivated the Golden Seal Altar, while the other three cultivated the Spirit Soldier Altar.  As temple heads, they were eligible to inherit their schools’ spirit soldiers, thus, most cultivated the Spirit Soldier Altar.</p><p>The altars appeared.</p><p>Three Spirit Soldier Altars rumbled, eight gates opened, and squads of soldiers poured out, filling the air with demonic energy.  The priestess with the Golden Seal Altar wasn't to be outdone. She pointed at her altar, her lips moving slightly. No incantation was heard, only the jade staff within the altar trembling violently before emitting a brilliant light. Within the light, the jade staff expanded at an alarming rate, quickly becoming thick enough to require dozens of people to embrace.  It wasn’t the staff itself expanding; one could clearly see countless intricate yet orderly runes covering its surface. This priestess was clearly using her altar to deploy a unique type of powerful talisman.</p><p>The gigantic jade staff expanded to its limit and exploded, sending countless bamboo fragments flying in every direction. The fragments were harmless, precisely striking the other priestesses' summoned demonic soldiers. Each soldier received a jade-green bamboo sliver that, in a flash, fused with its forehead, entering its body.  The other three priestesses didn't interfere.  Without orders, the soldiers dared not resist, allowing the power within the fragments to enter them.  </p><p>The soldiers, freshly summoned and their formation still unformed, emitted identical auras upon absorbing the fragments. The auras merged into one, forming a unity. While belonging to three different priestesses, their energy was now perfectly harmonious, seemingly disordered but each 'fragment' acting as a dispersed formation, instantly uniting if needed, forming the soldiers into a single talisman.  Once the soldiers formed a grand array and received the fragments’ enhancement, they gained countless advantages.</p><p>These priestesses rarely worked together, yet their coordination was seamless, complementing each other perfectly, leaving no opportunity for the enemy.  Only Ruquan Zhenren didn’t summon her altar, remaining above, chanting to repel the miasma. As the army formation neared completion, she slowly descended into its midst.</p><p>Whether the enemy feared Ruquan Zhenren's power or hadn’t found the right moment to strike, the miasma stopped intensifying and began to weaken.  No unusual changes occurred within the miasma itself.  Unsure of the demons' next move, the priestesses remained vigilant, awaiting Ruquan Zhenren's orders.</p><p>Suddenly, Ruquan Zhenren’s expression shifted, her eyes flashing with brilliance as she abruptly turned her head to the right.</p><p>There, the turbulent waves crashed, no different from anywhere else, when suddenly a few shrill, strange laughs echoed, “Heh heh… I wonder who it is. It’s Ruquan Zhenren from Jingquan Temple.  With Jingquan Temple’s strength and status, obtaining a Grand Master position on the Dugong Seal wouldn't be easy, would it? No wonder you’re willing to act as a lapdog for the Daoist Court. My respects! My respects!”</p><p>The voice was strangely modulated, and the words held a deeper meaning.</p><p>Hearing this, a strange look flickered across the eyes of the other four Zhenren.</p><p>Based on their status, they knew some secrets, but not the full story.</p><p>It’s said that the five Daoist talismans have a fixed number of positions, and it’s not simply a matter of cultivation level to break through.  Forcibly breaking through is difficult to sustain.  Merits in the battle against the Gui Fang Kingdom are one of the criteria for assessment.</p><p>The young female Taoist priestess had just learned the secret of the Divine Court and the Dugong Seal, guessing it must be related to the collapse of the Divine Court and the unfinished Dugong Seal.</p><p>Ruquan Zhenren remained unperturbed, his expression calm, his tone cold, “This formation can mask itself from my perception. It seems the Demon King has arrived.  I wonder which fellow Daoist is present; why not reveal yourself for a chat?”</p><p>The other side only sneered and didn't respond.</p><p>The strange laughter gradually faded, and the foul energy dissipated rapidly, soon disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Ruquan Zhenren gazed in the direction where the laughter had faded, guessing the opponent's purpose. This attack seemed to end abruptly, but its real purpose was to force her to reveal herself and confirm her identity.</p><p>The mutual probing had begun, and the Gui Fang Kingdom had won the first round.</p><p>“…Greetings, Senior Ruquan.”</p><p>The Zhenren put away their altars and went forward to pay their respects to Ruquan Zhenren.</p><p>The expressions of the three Zhenren varied. They only now learned that the Grand Master had actually lowered their cultivation to enter the altar.</p><p>What could be so important?</p><p>They dared not ask Ruquan Zhenren, instead using inquiring glances to look at the Jingquan Temple master.</p><p>Ruquan Zhenren didn't need to explain anything to them.  He withdrew his gaze, looking towards where the primordial embryo had been, “Go! See what methods these demons used…”</p><p>The three Zhenren, filled with questions, hurriedly followed.</p><p>The primordial embryo had dispersed, and the auspicious clouds appeared calm, but traces must remain.  The Zhenren spread out to search carefully.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Wan Zhenren and his group were exploring along their predetermined route.</p><p>As they explored, they frequently looked towards the direction where the golden light had faded.</p><p>Wan Zhenren observed his uncle's actions.</p><p>The old Taoist would occasionally rub the jade talisman in his hand, sensing something.</p><p>After walking a certain distance, Wan Zhenren heard his uncle’s voice transmission, “Don’t worry about that.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Wan Zhenren obeyed and continued searching for the Divine Court.</p><p>…</p><p>From Ruquan Zhenren's encounter, the inside of the altar gradually became lively. Similar golden lights appeared periodically.</p><p>There were golden lights, and lights of other colors. Some were magnificent, sweeping across the entire altar, not inferior to the one many years ago.</p><p>Others only affected a large area of illusion, appearing and disappearing very quickly.</p><p>These were all probing maneuvers and distractions orchestrated by both sides.</p><p>Even knowing that more than 90% were enemy decoys, they still had to check, and encounters were unavoidable.</p><p>Sometimes it was a brief contact; recognizing the enemy's identity, they would retreat.</p><p>Sometimes, a full-scale battle would ensue, with varying results.</p><p>However, the true entrance to the Divine Court had not yet appeared.  Before that, no one wanted to fight to the death.</p><p>…</p><p>“Here it comes again!”</p><p>In the flower field, Qin Sang looked up to the sky, seeing the sky filled with crimson clouds, dyeing the entire Poison Domain red.</p><p>It was as if a rising sun was appearing in the altar.</p><p>“The ninth time…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>He stayed in the flower field, counting the altar's lights, with the golden light being the most frequent, six times in total, and three times the crimson clouds.</p><p>He didn't understand the meaning of these lights, only able to guess the extent of the conflict based on their impact.</p><p>The only relief was that none of the lights were as intense as the golden light from years ago, and the flower field remained unaffected for now.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the source of the lights wasn't fixed, and they weren't getting progressively deeper.</p><p>This indicated that both sides weren't blindly pushing deeper into the altar, and the treasure could be anywhere.</p><p>Time slowly slipped away as Qin Sang counted the light bursts, a torturous experience.</p><p>…</p><p>For several days.</p><p>The standoff outside the altar continued.</p><p>The battlefield was silent.</p><p>No news came from the altar.  The momentum of both sides had weakened considerably since the beginning; their sharpness was being worn down by time.</p><p>The internal struggle within the altar intensified, with casualties on both sides.</p><p>Wan Zhenren's group was lucky; only two days ago did they brush shoulders with a group of demon cultivators. After a few probes, they peacefully separated.</p><p>They hadn't encountered any other demons since.</p><p>In these days, Wan Zhenren and the others passed countless illusions, but the jade talisman remained unresponsive.</p><p>Strange lights frequently appeared.  The disciples of Wan Zhenren obeyed his commands without question, their silence unnerving.  Those with sharp eyes had long suspected the old Taoist's true identity, but no one dared investigate further.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Another wave of golden light flooded the sky, engulfing everyone.</p><p>The disciples instinctively prepared themselves. As expected, the light intensified before quickly fading.</p><p>Once the golden light dispersed, everyone glanced around, their expressions unchanged. They were about to leave when they noticed the old Taoist remained motionless.</p><p>“Master Uncle?”</p><p>Wan Zhenren hastily stopped.</p><p>The old Taoist remained silent, his brow furrowed.  Suddenly, he asked, “How many times has this happened?”</p><p>Wan Zhenren understood that his master uncle was referring to the demonic golden light. He pondered, “It should be the eighth time.”</p><p>“The eighth time…”</p><p>The old Taoist flicked his whisk, scattering light that formed a circular area before him.</p><p>In several locations, points of light turned gold, clearly visible—eight in total.</p><p>The eight golden points were scattered seemingly randomly, but to the old Taoist, a pattern might exist.</p><p>After a long contemplation, a subtle change in his expression appeared. He swept his whisk, erasing the circle. “Follow me…”</p><p>Before he finished, the old Taoist vanished, his escape swift as lightning. He didn't head deeper into the ritual grounds or continue in the original direction but instead flew directly west, his eyes deep in thought as he continued his calculations.</p><p>The disciples exchanged glances, utterly perplexed, but followed closely behind.</p><p>As Wan Zhenren and the others raced through the ritual grounds, unbeknownst to them, the demon cultivators were moving according to a precise plan.</p><p>The repeated detonations of golden light were not merely to confuse the Daoist sect.</p><p>They were using the light as cover to secretly lay down a massive formation within the ritual grounds. While it couldn't directly locate its target, it would help eliminate certain areas and narrow down the target's approximate location.</p><p>This formation originated from a great sage and was undetectable even by a peak-level Grandmaster, let alone now.</p><p>“It's time…”</p><p>In a shimmering, illusory scene, five demon cultivators stood on the water's surface, surrounding a man in white robes.</p><p>The man in white was refined and elegant, with no outward signs of demonic nature.  He looked up at the sky and murmured.</p><p>Then, he lightly shook his sleeve, and a golden pearl tumbled out, falling into the water.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The water remained undisturbed.</p><p>The golden pearl floated serenely on the surface.</p><p>The other demon cultivators forced out their blood essence, infusing it into the pearl. The crimson flash was quickly absorbed, and the pearl seemed to shed a layer, its golden light intensifying.</p><p>The pearl then began to swell, its shape changing into a golden embryonic form.</p><p>The embryo pulsed, its golden light growing stronger, dyeing the entire illusory scene gold and spreading rapidly.</p><p>In an instant, the golden light filled most of the ritual grounds, drawing the eyes of both cultivators and demons.</p><p>They expected the light to dissipate as before.</p><p>Surprisingly, when the golden light filled the entire grounds, reaching its peak, instead of fading, it intensified.</p><p>Simultaneously, eight illusory embryos appeared throughout the ritual grounds, mirroring the locations of the eight previous golden lights.</p><p>Where the light had previously faded, points of light now reappeared, resonating with the intensified golden light.</p><p>The last embryo felt the resonance and pulsed faster, emitting an even more concentrated golden light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Waves of golden light bombarded the ritual grounds. The nine embryos formed a strange formation.</p><p>At this moment, all cultivators and demons within the grounds sensed the embryo formation. Upon completion of the formation, a strange fluctuation appeared in one area.</p><p>The demon cultivators' expressions were filled with excitement. They charged towards that direction without hesitation.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators’ faces changed, realizing the danger, and rushed towards the same location.</p><p>In the flower field, Qin Sang rose from the ground.</p><p>“Is it coming?”</p><p>Qin Sang extended his spiritual sense, covering the entire flower field, sensing the increasingly violent shockwaves.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The flower field's formation trembled. The flower spirits danced, and the bones on the ground vibrated.</p><p>This impact was stronger than before.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed from tense to relaxed.</p><p>In the flower field's illusory realm, the bones were the foundation, and the flowers were a later addition.</p><p>As it turned out, the land of bones was stable. As long as the core of the illusion remained intact, the flower field's formation would hold. Last time, the formation was flawed, affecting the aperture.</p><p>For now, he didn’t need to relocate the flower spirits.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The external illusions were hit by the golden light, awakening illusions one after another. Various wonders bloomed continuously.</p><p>While the experts of both sides were flying, suddenly they felt a huge tremor shake the ritual grounds.</p><p>This tremor was like the entire ritual grounds jumping, extraordinary.</p><p>At that moment, including Qin Sang, everyone was secretly shocked, looking towards the source of the tremor.</p><p>From there erupted golden light even more dazzling than the embryos, revealing the shadow of an ancient tree!</p>
