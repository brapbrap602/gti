<h1></h1><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang decided to give it a try. "I possess an incomplete secret art, and its cultivation is exceedingly difficult."</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang swiftly retrieved a blank jade slip and inscribed the first layer of the *Kindling Golden Lotus* into it.</p><p>"Alas, I've been reduced to selling secret arts for a living."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. He would never share such a top-tier secret art with others unless absolutely necessary, lest he cultivate a rival for himself.</p><p>However, if he could obtain the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*, it would be worth it.</p><p>He didn't deliberately conceal the flaws, as the other party would easily see through them.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his palm in a gesture, and the jade slip floated forward, passing through a layer of restriction he had personally laid, and floated in mid-air together with the Nether Asura Thorn.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't release his divine sense. He added, "I don't want cultivation methods. If this fellow daoist is interested, I hope to exchange it for an Earth-attribute escape technique."</p><p>The other party understood, chuckled softly, and replied noncommittally, "An incomplete secret art, and its cultivation is exceedingly difficult. This humble one only worries that my aptitude is dull, and I won't be able to grasp the basics!"</p><p>As he spoke, that person sent a wisp of his divine sense over.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed the core content and only allowed him to view it alone.</p><p>A moment later.</p><p>That person suddenly uttered a soft exclamation, arousing curiosity among the others.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, that person said solemnly, "This fellow daoist's secret art is indeed not simple, but its flaws are also unimaginably large! When this fellow daoist obtained this secret art, I wonder if there were any other things nearby?"</p><p>The other party actually guessed that this secret art was too dangerous and might have auxiliary cultivation methods or items.</p><p>He didn't directly refuse. Could it be that he had also subdued some kind of spiritual flame, or had the confidence to avoid the danger?</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, and he brought out a prepared excuse. "This technique is a treasure of my sect. If there were such things, why would I devote my energy to another path? After all, compared to this flaw, the second condition is always more likely to be satisfied."</p><p>The second condition referred to spiritual flames. As long as one was willing to spend time, one could slowly collect various spiritual flames and condense Fire Lotus Seeds.</p><p>'Another path' referred to body refinement.</p><p>According to the understanding of most Nascent Soul cultivators, when encountering bottlenecks in cultivation, some might try to start from the physical body and divine sense to seek opportunities.</p><p>But even a heaven's chosen with a Heavenly Spiritual Root could not balance the three levels of Essence, Qi, and Spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang made it clear that he was determined to obtain the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*, indicating that he had already achieved considerable attainments in body cultivation. He must have failed to make progress with his divine sense, otherwise why would he possess a top-tier divine sense secret art and not cultivate it?</p><p>This was very reasonable.</p><p>Who would have thought that Qin Sang relied on the Jade Buddha to cultivate several cultivation methods and secret arts that others would consider impossible to master, embarking on a different path!</p><p>After a long silence.</p><p>The other party weighed it for a long time and finally spoke, while also taking out a jade slip. "I have a *Shifting Sands Escape*, but it can't be called top-tier. I'm afraid it won't meet that fellow daoist's requirements."</p><p>This person is not simple, he really wants to buy the *Kindling Golden Lotus*!</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. After consulting the other party and Venerable Chongtai, he invited the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* to join the transaction.</p><p>After the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* examined the *Shifting Sands Escape*, he hesitated for a moment and asked Qin Sang, "Is fellow daoist a body cultivator?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled and answered evasively, "Fellow daoist, don't be too greedy."</p><p>The owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* was silent for a moment, and then made up his mind. "The *Shifting Sands Escape* plus the Nether Asura Thorn, in exchange for the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal*!"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>His actions had advantages and disadvantages. He dispelled the other person's doubts, but allowed the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* to confidently demand a high price (lit. a lion's big mouth).</p><p>"These old guys are all cunning as devils, it's impossible to find a bargain here."</p><p>Understanding this point, Qin Sang put aside his hesitation and glanced at the clusters of white light around him. "Add two drops of Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid!"</p><p>"One drop!"</p><p>"Deal!"</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. No matter how the owner of the *Seven Teachers' Buddha Seal* bought the Heavenly Crown Heavy Liquid, he turned around to haggle with the other person.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could speak, the other party said, "Hehe, even if this fellow daoist's secret art is incomplete, its value still steadily exceeds the *Shifting Sands Escape*. What else does fellow daoist want?"</p><p>This person was quite straightforward.</p><p>Qin Sang softened his tone and said, "Fellow daoist, help me exchange for that Azure Dot Gold, or the Fluffy Cloud Crystal."</p><p>The crowd watched silently. They guessed that Qin Sang was preparing to refine a magic treasure, but although the three spiritual materials had similar properties, they couldn't be mixed and used like that, which made them somewhat confused.</p><p>After a dazzling exchange of hands.</p><p>The jade slip and Nether Asura Thorn in front of Qin Sang's bamboo building disappeared.</p><p>He had three more things in his hand.</p><p>A jade slip.</p><p>A piece of Azure Dot Gold the size of a fist, black all over with blue spots.</p><p>And a jade bottle containing a drop of silver liquid, which was even heavier than the Azure Dot Gold when held in the hand.</p><p>He probed his divine sense into the jade slip, quickly scanned the contents, confirmed that the divine ability was correct, and without detailed inspection, temporarily put it away.</p><p>With the trade fair proceeding to this point, Qin Sang's transaction was considered the most complicated, involving six Nascent Souls before and after, because the owner of the *Shifting Sands Escape* had gone through another hand when exchanging for the Azure Dot Gold.</p><p>All parties were very satisfied with this transaction.</p><p>Even more satisfied was Venerable Chongtai, who said with a smile, "Please welcome the next fellow daoist!"</p><p>Next, the three bamboo buildings retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the jade token and thought to himself that he hadn't arrived too late, so why hadn't it been his turn yet.</p><p>The sound from outside came in, "Locking Void Sword, exchanging for a supreme-grade magic treasure!"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang hurriedly looked up to the outside.</p><p>Even at the Myriad Demons Assembly, supreme-grade magic treasures didn't appear very often.</p><p>Inside the white light, a jade sword the size of a finger floated.</p><p>The jade sword was pure white all over, without any patterns on it.</p><p>The moment he saw the jade sword, Qin Sang felt very familiar, it was actually the small jade sword in the hands of the corpse in the Buddha Hall!</p><p>"Old Devil Hunmo or Yu Yi Yuanjun?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, as if he wanted to see through the darkness and see the person inside the bamboo building clearly.</p><p>He had already found out that the one who entered the Buddha Hall with Old Devil Hunmo was a female demon with the Dharma name Yu Yi Yuanjun. The remaining magic treasures in the Buddha Hall must have fallen into the hands of these two.</p><p>It's actually a supreme-grade magic treasure!</p><p>If I had known to snatch the jade sword, I wouldn't have had to bother with refining the Gold Sinking Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, when he suddenly heard someone questioning, "This is clearly a high-grade magic treasure, how can you want to exchange it for a supreme-grade magic treasure?"</p><p>Hearing the questioning, a faint, unchanging laughter came from the bamboo building, "I dare to ask such a price, naturally there is a reason. This sword is not only a high-grade magic treasure, but also contains unknown secrets, but I cannot crack it for the time being. As long as it meets a destined person, I believe its value is definitely no less than a supreme-grade magic treasure, and may even exceed it!"</p><p>These words caused an uproar, daring to ask such a high price for a secret that he himself couldn't solve, what a joke!</p><p>Although Qin Sang was curious, he had no intention of using his divine sense to check it out, and watched coldly.</p>
