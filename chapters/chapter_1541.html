<h1>Chapter 1532: Central Province (4k)</h1><p>At the very last moment before exiting the image, the skeletal demonic bird seemed to sense something. Its head twisted, and its scarlet eyes swept in their direction, finally fixing on the scene.</p><p>Its gaze seemed to pierce through the Phantom Spirit Stone, carrying a shocking madness and ferocity, striking heavily at the viewers' minds and souls, sending chills down their spines.</p><p>This sensation… was indeed that of a true Ferocious Beast!</p><p>The image was not fake.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Phantom Spirit Stone for a long time.</p><p>This skeletal demonic bird was different from the two Ferocious Beasts he had encountered before. He wondered how many Ferocious Beasts there actually were in the depths of the storm.</p><p>The old man, having achieved his goal, respectfully escorted Qin Sang to the cave dwelling. After obtaining permission, he summoned a guard to stand watch outside the cave dwelling and await orders.</p><p>Then, the old man descended the mountain, circled around, and quietly entered the City Lord's Mansion. He stopped before an ancient, simple wooden building by a lake, bowed deeply, and spoke a few words in a low voice.</p><p>The wooden building remained silent.</p><p>A sound transmission entered his ear, and the old man replied with a "Yes," then exited the City Lord's Mansion and continued to guard the city gate.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed completely unaware of the old man's actions. He set up several restrictions and sat cross-legged in meditation, circulating his energy.</p><p>Washing away the dust of his journey, the True Essence within his body gradually recovered.</p><p>The journey to the Western Desert was long and arduous. It was best to replenish his spirit before setting off.</p><p>Three months later.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke from his meditation, feeling refreshed and invigorated. He played with the Heavenly Eye Butterfly for a while, then remembered to organize the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Although he and Liuli had tried to be frugal, the spirit stones and spirit pills they had prepared for the journey were almost depleted. If any future transactions between Nascent Soul cultivators were involved, he could only barter.</p><p>The whereabouts of the Buddhist Bone Relic were still unknown, and he had to consider the possibility of needing to trade.</p><p>Qin Sang had no shortage of valuable treasures.</p><p>Just the two sticks of Spirit-Suppressing Incense alone could make Nascent Soul cultivators flock to him.</p><p>But these treasures couldn't be easily traded. Qin Sang sorted through them and determined that the most suitable items for trade were the Yang Puppet Crystals and the puppets fused with Yin Puppet Crystals.</p><p>For cultivators who specialized in the Dao of Puppetry, these were supreme treasures.</p><p>He believed they had ways to separate out the Yin Puppet Crystals.</p><p>His Out-of-Body Incarnation had shed its puppet body and could no longer fuse with the puppet crystals. And with his Senior Sister not around, he had too much to do to spend energy learning a new Dao of Puppetry from scratch.</p><p>Using them to exchange for advantageous conditions and resources was the most rational choice.</p><p>After thinking for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang got up and walked out of the cave dwelling.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p>A black-robed figure suddenly appeared on the quiet surface of the lake. He flashed to the front of the wooden building and gently knocked on the door twice.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>A clear and elegant voice came from inside.</p><p>The black-robed man straightened his clothes, pushed the door open and entered. He cupped his fists and said "Elder Brother," then impatiently said, "The people below sent up a message. That person has come out of seclusion and seems to be leaving the city. He came here alone, spent lavishly, and must be wealthy. Why don't you send the signal, Dao Brother?"</p><p>The furnishings inside the room were simple.</p><p>A green-robed cultivator sat cross-legged on a futon. An incense burner was placed in front of him, burning a stick of incense with a faint, elegant fragrance.</p><p>This person was the Master of White Crow Mountain.</p><p>The green-robed cultivator slowly opened his eyes and said in a calm tone, "This person dared to travel alone and brazenly seclude himself for months in an unfamiliar place. Do you think, my dear brother, that he has no backing?"</p><p>The black-robed man chuckled, "His backing is that he's in the late Core Formation stage, so what? By uniting with several nearby fellow Daoists, and with your methods, Dao Brother, we can certainly take him down."</p><p>The green-robed cultivator shook his head, "We've been able to gain a foothold near the Northern Barrens because of our caution. We don't do this kind of business more than once every ten or twenty years. Otherwise, White Crow Mountain's reputation would have been ruined long ago. In recent years, due to the changes in the storm, the number of people coming and going has increased, and I couldn't resist the temptation and have been acting a bit too frequently. You think you're being discreet, my dear brother, but you can't hide from those with ulterior motives."</p><p>The black-robed man was not stupid. He hesitated and said, "Are you suspecting that he is…?"</p><p>"The Ferocious Beasts have caused panic in the cultivation world. It's normal for some great powers to want to find a base to observe the changes in the storm. The reputation that White Crow Mountain has built up over the years has become a burden. I'm ready to abandon the island and yield to a worthier person at any time. You should also consider it early, my dear brother. As for this person, whether he has ulterior motives or not…"</p><p>The green-robed cultivator paused, "Let him go."</p><p>'Pa! Pa! Pa!'</p><p>Just as he finished speaking, applause suddenly sounded from the doorway.</p><p>The two people in the room suddenly changed color.</p><p>"Who!"</p><p>The black-robed man turned around quickly, a long saber already in his hand.</p><p>He saw at a glance that a Daoist was standing at the door, looking like a piece of jade, with a refined temperament. He was smiling at them, applauding the green-robed cultivator's judgment.</p><p>The black-robed man was terrified. This person had likely followed him in, and they hadn't noticed at all.</p><p>'Shua!'</p><p>The black-robed man raised his saber and slashed, but before the saber could even leave his hand, he felt a finger rapidly enlarging in front of him. Then, his vision went black, and he collapsed to the ground, unconscious.</p><p>At this moment, the green-robed cultivator had just stood up, a steel-boned fan in his palm. Seeing this scene, he froze in place, not daring to move.</p><p>"Worthy of being a City Lord. I didn't wait for you to come find me, so I had to come myself."</p><p>The person at the door was Qin Sang.</p><p>He walked into the room on his own, pulled up a stool and sat down, pointing at the futon, "Please sit."</p><p>The green-robed cultivator's face was ashen, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p>But he was quite capable. His mind quickly regained some clarity. He didn't dare to check whether the black-robed man was alive or dead. He bowed deeply, "Junior Han Ya greets Senior. Junior was blind and did not know that Senior was gracing us with your presence. I apologize for the disrespect and negligence. I hope Senior will forgive me."</p><p>"Don't be nervous," Qin Sang said kindly, "I just want to ask you a few questions."</p><p>"Junior will definitely tell you everything I know."</p><p>The green-robed man took a deep breath, but did not dare to sit down.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't force him, "I am about to travel to the Northern Barrens. You should have a map of the Northern Barrens, right?"</p><p>The green-robed man immediately took out a jade slip and presented it to Qin Sang with both hands.</p><p>"This map was purchased by Junior at the North Sky Pavilion seventy years ago. The situation in the Northern Barrens has always been chaotic, with frequent changes in power. Most of the information on this map is no longer reliable, but the mountains and rivers should be accurate…"</p><p>Qin Sang probed the jade slip with his divine sense.</p><p>The area depicted in detail on the map was actually limited to the eastern part of the Northern Barrens, with large blank areas elsewhere.</p><p>However, through the map, Qin Sang formed a preliminary impression of the Central Province.</p><p>The Central Province was somewhat similar to the North Chen Region.</p><p>The cultivation world had a complete continent, unlike the fragmented Northern Sea's Three Regions.</p><p>However, the Central Province was vast and far exceeded the North Chen Region.</p><p>According to the description on the map, the Northern Barrens were slightly larger than the Northern Sea's Three Regions combined, but because most of it was a desolate wasteland unsuitable for even mortals, let alone cultivators, it was the most barren and chaotic region in the Central Province.</p><p>The most prosperous area in the Central Province was the Misty Rain Nineteen Prefectures south of the Northern Barrens, known for gathering the spiritual essence of heaven and earth. Sects stood in great numbers, with the Buddhist and Daoist schools being the most prosperous.</p><p>Due to the great distance, the information about the Central Province in the jade slip was very limited and general.</p><p>However, a few brief sentences specifically mentioned a name that Qin Sang had recently heard: Eight Views Temple.</p><p>Only eight words.</p><p>The Sect of the Daoist Path, the Dao Arena of the True Lord!</p><p>True Lord.</p><p>The Central Province Daoist Path's respectful title for cultivators in the Deity Transformation stage.</p><p>"Sure enough, there is a Deity Transformation True Lord. No wonder Eight Views Temple acts so domineeringly!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, and he was somewhat puzzled, "Why didn't that True Lord take action during the hunt for the Ferocious Beast?"</p><p>His gaze continued to move. West of the Misty Rain Nineteen Prefectures was the area known as the Western Desert, commonly filled with deserts and Gobi. The information was even scarcer, almost non-existent.</p><p>Then there was the eastern part of the continent, the sea area called the Eastern Sea by the cultivators of the Central Province. There were many overseas Immortal Mountains, and no lack of overseas rogue cultivators and powers.</p><p>The green-robed cultivator now mistakenly believed that Qin Sang came from an overseas Immortal Mountain.</p><p>This Eastern Sea was not that Eastern Sea, and had nothing to do with the Eastern Sea Guixu mentioned by the long-bearded Daoist.</p><p>The Northern Sea had a limit, but the Eastern Sea was boundless.</p><p>Of course, this was just the perception of low-level cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the end of the Eastern Sea was definitely also the storm belt.</p><p>The territory of the Central Province was truly vast, no wonder it had earned Xiao Xiangzi's praise. Including the sea area and land, the Northern Sea and the Azure Wave Sea were far inferior.</p><p>"Senior's divine abilities are vast, and you can go anywhere in the world. Please forgive Junior's shallow knowledge. I don't know much about the great powers and forces in the Northern Barrens, so I dare not speak rashly and mislead Senior. After Senior arrives in the Northern Barrens, you might as well go to the North Sky Pavilion, or Junior can do it for you. In addition, the Northern Barrens have Nine Disasters…"</p><p>Saying this, the green-robed cultivator hurriedly took out another jade slip, "Junior did not travel in the Northern Barrens for too long and only experienced one Thunder Disaster, a calamity that could endanger Junior's life. Of course, it's nothing to Senior. However, there is also the possibility of all the disasters occurring at the same time, which greatly increases the danger. Senior should be a little more vigilant."</p><p>The green-robed cultivator held nothing back and told Qin Sang everything he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang got what he wanted and was very satisfied. He nodded and said, "Thank you for your trouble."</p><p>Then, his figure turned from solid to illusory and disappeared in front of the green-robed cultivator.</p><p>The green-robed cultivator felt a chill on his back, not knowing when he had broken out in a cold sweat. He stood frozen for a full incense stick's time before daring to move.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had already appeared on the sea surface, flying south.</p><p>"There seems to be a place in the Northern Barrens that Senior Xiao Xiangzi mentioned. If it's on the way, I'll go and see if it has an owner. It could be a backup cave dwelling…"</p><p>Qin Sang remembered an encounter recorded by Xiao Xiangzi in the jade slip. He made up his mind and his speed was like lightning.</p><p>He hardly stopped along the way. Until he reached the Northern Barrens and found a market marked on the map. He spent a fortune at the North Sky Pavilion to purchase a map that included the entire mountains and rivers of the Northern Barrens, gaining a deeper understanding of the region.</p><p>With no effort, Qin Sang found his target: Heaven-Splitting Valley.</p><p>To get to Heaven-Splitting Valley, he needed to make a detour, but it was acceptable.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang embarked on his journey.</p><p>He traveled alone and did not deliberately hide his tracks, but he also rarely interacted with the forces of the Northern Barrens.</p><p>Demons ruled the Northern Barrens, and the situation was chaotic. Even the major powers were not easy to deal with. Qin Sang's priority was still the Buddhist Bone Relic, and he didn't want to cause any trouble, so he simply avoided contact with them.</p><p>Danger was relative.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Out-of-Body Incarnation, two mid-Nascent Soul cultivators, were a force to be reckoned with anywhere. They could easily cope with the Nine Disasters of the Northern Barrens.</p><p>…</p><p>Heaven-Splitting Valley.</p><p>This place was a plateau ridge, which for some reason had split open, winding endlessly. The valley ran along the ground, hence the name Heaven-Splitting.</p><p>Legends in the Northern Barrens said that Heaven-Splitting Valley was one of the famous forbidden areas, where the Nine Disasters occurred in turn, and countless cultivators had died there.</p><p>Despite the danger, it still attracted cultivators from the Northern Barrens because Heaven-Splitting Valley grew countless rare spirit herbs and had opportunities not found elsewhere.</p><p>At a gap in Heaven-Splitting Valley, there were many figures on the surrounding peaks. Low-level cultivators gathered here, staring intently at the thick clouds in the valley, seemingly waiting for something.</p><p>"The valley is opening!"</p><p>Someone suddenly shouted.</p><p>Then, cheers erupted from the various mountains.</p><p>The clouds in the valley rolled and rapidly thinned. Originally, the view was a vast expanse of white, but now one could vaguely see the vegetation in the valley.</p><p>The so-called 'valley opening' was a customary term used by the cultivators near Heaven-Splitting Valley.</p><p>During this period of thin clouds, the frequency of the Nine Disasters would greatly decrease, making it the best time to enter the valley. Cultivators judged the time to enter and exit based on the changes in the clouds in the valley.</p><p>Local cultivators knew when to advance and retreat and were familiar with the patterns of the clouds, so they would not go deep into the valley.</p><p>The clouds changed rapidly.</p><p>Before the cheers could die down, they retreated like a tide into the depths of Heaven-Splitting Valley, and the view became increasingly clear.</p><p>Some people couldn't hold back any longer.</p><p>A golden light rushed down the mountain and disappeared into the clouds in a flash.</p><p>The next moment,遁光 flashed on the various peaks, and people rushed into the valley.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was standing on a nearby mountain, watching the cultivators enter the valley, and couldn't help but think of when his cultivation was still low.</p><p>He held a jade slip in his hand, which contained a general description of Heaven-Splitting Valley. Based on this, he analyzed that the place recorded by Senior Xiao Xiangzi should be in this area.</p><p>The jade slip did not explain why Senior Xiao Xiangzi came to Heaven-Splitting Valley back then.</p><p>While traveling in Heaven-Splitting Valley, he accidentally discovered an ancient cultivator's cave dwelling, which was an excellent place for cultivation.</p><p>At that time, he thought it was just an abandoned cave dwelling and didn't pay much attention to it. Later, he accidentally obtained an ancient scripture in the Northern Sea and remembered that the formation of the cave dwelling had many similarities with the one recorded in the ancient scripture.</p><p>There seemed to be something else hidden deep within the cave dwelling!</p><p>For Qin Sang, it didn't matter whether there were treasures in the cave dwelling. This cave dwelling was not bad, with abundant spiritual energy, an excellent location, and sufficient tranquility.</p><p>The cultivators filed in, and no one could be seen outside the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly flew into the valley and cast a spell. Even if he passed by those low-level cultivators, they would not notice him.</p><p>Also blinded to his presence were the demonic beasts in the valley.</p><p>Heaven-Splitting Valley was sealed by clouds all year round, but inside it was lush and beautiful.</p><p>Danger lurked beneath the beautiful scenery.</p><p>However, the罡罩 of the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl was enough to deal with it.</p><p>He strolled leisurely through the valley, and gradually, no other figures could be seen around him.</p><p>After walking for an unknown distance, he arrived at the deepest part of Heaven-Splitting Valley, which was feared by nearby cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression moved slightly. He finally found the topographical landmark described by Xiao Xiangzi: eight stone peaks arranged in the shape of the Eight Trigrams, and the ancient cultivator's cave dwelling was located southwest of this place.</p><p>He immediately turned southwest and swept hundreds of miles, his figure suddenly stopping. He looked at the scene in front of him and was a little stunned.</p><p>The jade slip described.</p><p>There was a jasper lake here, and the cave dwelling was hidden at the bottom of the valley.</p><p>Where was the lake now?</p><p>A deep, bottomless hole appeared on the ground. Gullies crisscrossed around the hole. Even after many years, Qin Sang could see the clues: these were sword marks!</p><p>Clearly, someone had gotten there first, and even the cave dwelling had been destroyed.</p>
