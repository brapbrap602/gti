<h1>Chapter 1005: White Crane</h1><p>Qin Sang traveled south, keeping a low profile.</p><p>Along the way, he refrained from any further actions, worried about leaving traces that the demon race could follow.</p><p>Thus, the journey took several months.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived in an unfamiliar sea, feeling he was finally safe.</p><p>He found a deserted island to rest and recuperate. Once recovered, he began to wander around, searching for opponents.</p><p>Qin Sang flew aimlessly for several days, but found no suitable targets.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's ears twitched slightly. He turned his head to look into the distance, and in a flash, he vanished.</p><p>A sheer cliff faced the sea.</p><p>On the cliff was a cave.</p><p>At this moment, two figures were entangled at the cave entrance.</p><p>The identities of the two were surprising. One was a brightly-colored kite, resembling a phoenix from afar, and the other was a snow-white crane.</p><p>The crane was quite majestic and spotless.</p><p>Standing on one leg, taller than the kite, it lowered its head and gently preened the kite's feathers with its beak. Its other claw gently stroked the kite's wing, slowly nudging it into the cave.</p><p>The kite snuggled close to the crane, appearing languid and intoxicated.</p><p>Although not of the same species, the intimate affection between these two demon beasts was quite endearing.</p><p>Then, a discordant note emerged.</p><p>A shrill scream startled the pair.</p><p>A teal shadow descended from the sky, flying towards the cave like lightning. It was another kite, larger than the first, with teal feathers. Although also majestic, it was not as striking as the white crane.</p><p>Seeing the amorous scene in the cave, the teal kite's cries became increasingly shrill, filled with fury.</p><p>The two demon birds inside the cave were startled awake.</p><p>Chaos ensued.</p><p>Seeing the teal kite's imposing manner, the white crane panicked. With a flick of its wings, it unceremoniously kicked the still-dazed kite away and, without looking back, flapped its wings and fled.</p><p>Due to the narrow cave entrance, the white crane stumbled and nearly fell.</p><p>Just then, the teal kite arrived, screeching angrily, its sharp talons reaching for the white crane's eyes.</p><p>Although panicked, the white crane reacted swiftly.</p><p>It tucked its long neck and folded its wings, narrowly avoiding the attack.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>A flurry of white feathers scattered.</p><p>A chunk of feathers was ripped from the white crane's wing by the teal kite's talons.  With a cry, it crashed into the cliff face like a white ball, then bounced off.</p><p>Fortunately, the crane's feathers were quite tough.</p><p>Its wings were tattered, but its body remained unharmed.</p><p>The white crane flapped its wings, trying to regain its balance.  However, the teal kite, consumed by rage and the perceived betrayal, would not let it go easily.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The teal blur attacked again.</p><p>The white crane could only dodge repeatedly.</p><p>Its defense was impressive, using its wings to block the teal kite's attacks and protect its core, with remarkable skill.</p><p>Despite being chased and attacked for so long, it hadn't been able to counterattack, yet had only suffered superficial injuries.</p><p>However, its once pristine white feathers were now disheveled, torn to shreds by the teal kite, leaving patches of bare skin.</p><p>Its wings, in particular, were almost completely plucked, turning it into a bald crane.</p><p>Finally, the white crane found an opportunity to counter, its fleshy wings acting like blades, blocking the teal kite's talons.</p><p>Then, with a flick of its wings, it turned and fled.</p><p>The teal kite pursued relentlessly.  However, the white crane proved surprisingly adept at escaping. Its bare wings flapped furiously, and the distance between them gradually increased. The chase seemed hopeless.</p><p>After escaping a certain distance, seeing that it was safe, the white crane suddenly stopped, turned, and began to dance, letting out a series of crane calls, seemingly quite proud of itself.</p><p>Seeing the enraged teal kite approaching again, the white crane tucked its neck and fled once more.</p><p>"So obnoxious!" Qin Sang, who had witnessed the entire scene from the shadows, muttered as he followed the two demons.</p><p>He hadn't expected to see such a drama in the demon sea.  It was quite a spectacle.</p><p>The teal kite, having failed to catch its rival, returned.</p><p>It was a Core Formation stage demon.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, feeling a bit sorry for the creature. He decided not to intervene and instead followed the crane.</p><p>The white crane, having shaken off the kite, flapped its short, fleshy wings and flew for a while before landing on a rocky beach.</p><p>Following close behind, Qin Sang observed the crane looking down at the water's surface.</p><p>The crane meticulously preened its remaining feathers, not missing a single downy fluff. Even the few long feathers left on its wings were carefully arranged.</p><p>Then, standing on one leg, it turned in circles, admiring its reflection, its expression smug.</p><p>However, its current appearance was far from handsome.</p><p>After a while, the white crane took flight again.</p><p>Qin Sang, watching the crane's departure, became curious about its intentions.</p><p>It seemed the crane hadn't consumed Emperor Flow Nectar, but judging by its previous behavior, it appeared quite intelligent and was at the mid-Core Formation stage.</p><p>On a whim, and with nothing else to do, Qin Sang decided not to reveal himself and continued to follow the crane.</p><p>The crane, completely unaware of the cultivator trailing it, flew purposefully in a straight line for several days, arriving at a large island.</p><p>Stealthily approaching a mountain, the crane peered around cautiously, then let out a series of cooing calls towards the forest.</p><p>Moments later, a beautiful demon bird, less than half the crane's size, flew out.</p><p>The beautiful demon bird landed gracefully on a tree branch.</p><p>The white crane spread its mangled wings and rushed to the beautiful bird, performing a courtship dance and emitting endearing calls.</p><p>Despite its unsightly appearance, its dance was quite graceful and captivating.</p><p>The beautiful demon bird, instead of being repulsed, seemed captivated and joined the dance.  The white crane seized the opportunity to approach, and it seemed the previous scene was about to repeat itself.</p><p>"Another one!  Wait, it seems to be like the previous kite, this beautiful bird also has phoenix blood. How many partners does this guy have?" Qin Sang, hidden in the shadows, was speechless.  Suddenly, a thought struck him, "Could this one also beâ€¦"</p><p>Just as this thought crossed his mind, a sound of something rushing through the air came from the distance.</p><p>The pair of birds separated as if electrocuted, the beautiful bird hurriedly returning to its nest.</p><p>Undeterred by the interruption, the white crane expertly fled along the ground.</p><p>"Late Core Formation stage!" Qin Sang looked up at the approaching demon beast, his expression serious.</p><p>This island was not ordinary.  Such a powerful demon beast on the outskirts indicated a dangerous place.</p><p>After escaping, the white crane began to roam around the outer areas of the demon island, even targeting those at the Spirit Gathering stage.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that despite its flamboyant behavior, the crane was quite picky.</p><p>It didn't seem to mind the cultivation level, but the target had to have phoenix blood. One ordinary demon bird, charmed by the dance and offering itself willingly, was unceremoniously kicked away.</p><p>However, its carefree days were numbered.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for the crane to leave the island, then appeared and blocked its path.</p>
