Chapter 326: Sheepskin


The auction, which began at 10 PM, had now stretched past 2 AM. With the Soul-Soothing Herb secured, Qin Sang felt no further pressure and participated freely in the remaining bids. He spent most of his spirit stones, acquiring several types of spiritual wood and a top-grade magical artifact called the Yellow Sand Banner before the auction ended.  Spirit stones are meant to be used to improve one's strength, not hoarded away.

This artifact required no preparation. Upon activation with spiritual power, it formed a swirling domain of yellow sand. Within this domain, sand and dust filled the air, creating a blinding and ever-shifting landscape. Opponents caught within the sand would find their senses dulled, their perception limited to a small area around them, as if trapped in an illusionary formation. The banner's weakness lay in its immobility once deployed. Any movement would break the sand domain, and the artifact itself lacked offensive power.

Qin Sang spent three thousand spirit stones on this artifact for a specific purpose. His combat strategy revolved around his existing artifacts. Both the Silver Blade Talisman and the Ten Yama Banners required preparation time. Ideally, he'd strike first.  If a surprise attack wasn't possible, or if he was ambushed, and his Corpse Refinement and Ebony Sword proved insufficient, he would rely on the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman to escape, create distance, prepare his artifacts, and then counterattack.  However, if escape proved impossible, he would be in a difficult situation. The Yellow Sand Banner filled this gap. He didn't need it to kill; it merely needed to deter aggressive attacks while he, hidden within the sandstorm, prepared his talisman or banners.

In addition to the banner, Qin Sang traded for most of the spiritual wood from other cultivators who, running low on spirit stones after participating in the auction, were selling their own stock. Along with the Phoenix Perch Vine and the Water-Point Wood, these additions strengthened his Ebony Sword. While not enough to support a third Killing Rune, it ensured his cultivation wouldn't be hampered by the sword's limitations in the short term.

Qin Sang was content with his gains. As the auction progressed, the items became increasingly expensive, exceeding his budget. He settled in as a spectator, waiting for the auction and subsequent secret market to conclude before leaving Shadow Pass.

The auction reached its climax with a succession of treasures. The cultivators' excitement was palpable.  Near the end, the competition became fierce, with the atmosphere reaching a fever pitch. Among the treasures was a live egg of a Cloudsoar Eagle!

The Cloudsoar Eagle was a powerful flying demon beast, reaching the Demon Spirit realm in adulthood, with the potential for further advancement. Demon beast eggs were incredibly rare and valuable. Raising a Cloudsoar Eagle from birth ensured loyalty, unlike subduing an adult, which often resulted in betrayal.  The Cloudsoar Eagle was renowned for its speed and powerful physique, especially its razor-sharp talons, comparable to magical artifacts.  It was a prized beast, both as a combat companion and a mount.

The cultivation techniques left by the Spirit Beast Sect Golden Core cultivator in Old Man Di Que's belongings included methods for raising a Cloudsoar Eagle. With proper training, it had a good chance of reaching the late Demon Spirit realm, equivalent to a late Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Qin Sang was naturally tempted by the egg. However, he quickly withdrew after two bids, intimidated by the fierce competition. He couldn't afford it unless he sold the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom, which he was unwilling to do.

Firstly, raising a Cloudsoar Eagle was a long and demanding process that would inevitably affect his own cultivation. He lacked the time and energy to dedicate himself to it. Even if the eagle reached maturity, Qin Sang might have already formed his Golden Core by then, rendering a Foundation Establishment level combatant redundant. Secondly, with his Corpse Refinements, his need for a spirit beast was less urgent.

Despite this, Qin Sang felt a twinge of regret. He had achieved his dream of sword flight, but when would he realize the leisurely image of riding a crane down south?

Following the Cloudsoar Eagle egg, precious pills, three talismans, and two sets of restriction tools further fueled the excitement, pushing the auction to its peak.  Finally, a set of seventy-seven formation flags, capable of acting as a sect's guardian formation, was sold to the Daoist priest for a staggering price, marking the end of the auction. The girl did not emerge from the darkness with any further items.

Just as everyone thought the auction was over, still buzzing with excitement, Gao Yi spoke with a smile, "Thank you all for your enthusiastic participation. I'm relieved this auction has been such a success, fulfilling the City Lord's trust in me.  However, there's one more matter. Please remain seated for a moment.  The Goldwater Formation was originally intended to be the final item. However, a Golden Core senior, upon hearing of our auction, has graciously offered a treasure to add to the festivities. Whether you seize this opportunity depends entirely on your capabilities!"

As countless surprised gazes turned to him, Gao Yi bowed towards the darkness, saying respectfully, "Senior, please entrust the treasure to this junior."

A buzz of conversation filled the hall as Gao Yi finished speaking.  Everyone was astonished.  It was known that after the Stone Island Trade Fair, Shadow Pass held a separate auction specifically for Golden Core cultivators.  It was renowned in the Small Cold region, with countless tales of rare treasures circulating. Why would a Golden Core cultivator participate in this auction instead?

Even the most powerful Foundation Establishment cultivators, those at the pseudo-Core Formation realm, couldn't bridge the gap to the Golden Core stage.  Someone as strong as Gao Yi could only address this individual as a junior.  Unless under special circumstances, the disparity in strength directly correlated to wealth.  Even the finest treasures here would likely fail to satisfy a Golden Core cultivator.

However, after the initial surprise, excitement took over. A treasure from a Golden Core cultivator, handled with such reverence by Gao Yi, had to be extraordinary.

Gao Yi waited respectfully. After a moment, a wooden box slowly emerged from the darkness.  He received it carefully, then, under the expectant gaze of the crowd, slowly opened it.  To everyone's surprise, the box contained not a powerful artifact or rare pill, but a single, unassuming item: a piece of sheepskin.

The sheepskin emitted no light, bore no markings, and appeared utterly ordinary.

Qin Sang, who had been watching with casual interest, suddenly felt his heart skip a beat.  His pupils contracted beneath his mask, and he straightened up.  This sheepskin bore a striking resemblance to the one he had taken from the black-clad fiend by the Sinking Water River!
