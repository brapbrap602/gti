<h1>Chapter 311: Halfway There</h1><p>Chapter 311: Halfway There</p><p>Unfortunately, he was on the brink of running out of spiritual energy at the time. He dared not spare Luo Xingnan's life as he could have had a mid-Foundation Establishment Phase living corpse.</p><p>To refine a living corpse, he still needed the Soul-drawing Grass, which was required to make the Corpse Talisman. Qin Sang met a cultivator in charge of Taiyi Elixir Pavilion through the Wanderer and asked them to keep an eye out for him.</p><p>Qin Sang was now very proficient in refining baleful corpses, and as long as he followed the steps, he wouldn't have any problems refining it.</p><p>He ordered the baleful corpse to attack him to test its strength and couldn't help but nod slightly. It was stronger than the previous baleful corpses and was not much different from the description in the Fiendish Corpse Sutra—it was a powerful assistant.</p><p>He put it in the Corpse Puppet Bag and let it slowly raise the corpse, then went into seclusion to cultivate and waited for news from the Wanderer.</p><p>…</p><p>A year later.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the cave abode's restriction had been triggered and woke up from his meditation.</p><p>After checking his Qi Sea, he walked out of the cave abode and saw that the Wanderer outside looked ruddy-complexioned and energetic. He couldn't help but be overjoyed, "Senior has recovered?"</p><p>The Wanderer nodded with a smile. "Fortunately, I had that thousand-year-old Smoke Grass. Otherwise, I would have had to wait a few more years. Little Brother Qin, I've already asked Taiyi Elixir Pavilion to prepare the pill room, and the supplementary medicine is also ready. We can start refining the medicinal pill."</p><p>Qin Sang felt a little nervous after hearing these words and secretly made fun of himself for being too impatient. He suppressed the anxiety in his heart and followed the Wanderer to the pill room.</p><p>Taiyi Elixir Pavilion discovered an underground fire vein in the snowy mountains, so the pill room was built there to use the Earth Fire to refine pills. Some pill rooms were rented out, but the two with the most stable Earth Fire were reserved for their own experts.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the air around him getting hotter as he walked down the steps from the cliffside entrance. He continued deep into the underground until he was stopped by a guard. Qin Sang handed over the Profound Emblem Yellow Root to the Wanderer and watched him enter the passageway that led to the core pill room, then waited outside.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The Wanderer still hadn't appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang's nervousness had long since subsided. He seemed as calm as ever as he sat down to cultivate and waited for news. He wasn't in a hurry.</p><p>He knew that refining medicinal pills wasn't so easy. Some alchemists would even stay in the pill room for an entire month to allow their state of mind to reach a state of complete tranquility, increasing their chances of success by even a hair.</p><p>A fourth day passed.</p><p>Then a fifth day.</p><p>…</p><p>Finally, on the tenth day.</p><p>There were faint footsteps coming from the passageway, and Qin Sang opened his eyes with a start and stood up.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's expectant gaze, the Wanderer didn't keep him in suspense and said with a smile, "I succeeded!"</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's state of mind, he couldn't help but let out a long breath of relief. He felt a weight lift off his shoulders, and then he saw the Wanderer wave his hand to put up a layer of barriers and take out a jade bottle from his other hand.</p><p>A medicinal pill in the jade bottle immediately caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>This spirit pill emitted an intense black and yellow light. There were faint Profound Emblems on the pill that flickered in and out of the light, very similar to the Profound Emblem Yellow Root.</p><p>This was the Profound Emblem Harmony Pill!</p><p>Qin Sang had heard the description of the Harmony Pill before. It was moon-white and didn't have these Profound Emblems, so it was very different from the Profound Emblem Harmony Pill, precisely because of the change in the main ingredient.</p><p>Qin Sang took the jade bottle and opened it. There was no smell, but the black and yellow light on the spirit pill suddenly surged out, like a gushing spring.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly closed the jade bottle and bowed to the Wanderer in thanks.</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work, Senior!"</p><p>The Wanderer shook his head and said, "Little Brother Qin, I have to refine the Nine Flowers Frost Grass, so I won't see you off. There are a few points you must remember when taking this pill. Firstly, your Qi Sea must be full and undamaged when you take the pill. Secondly, don't be in a hurry. You must have a quiet place, and refine the pill's strength slowly…"</p><p>After listening attentively to the instructions, Qin Sang bid farewell to the Wanderer and left the pill room. He couldn't wait to ride his sword and transform into a sword light that quickly returned to his cave abode.</p><p>He added a few more layers of restriction outside the cave abode.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down on the sickbed, placed the jade bottle in front of him, closed his eyes to calm down, and circulated his cultivation method for a dozen or so cycles until his state was at its peak.</p><p>Next, he paused slightly and suddenly used his Divine Consciousness to open the jade bottle and roll the Profound Emblem Harmony Pill to his mouth before swallowing it without hesitation.</p><p>As soon as the spirit pill entered his mouth, it turned into a cool medicinal energy that flowed down his throat and into his abdomen.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was firmly locked onto this medicinal energy, ensuring that he didn't waste a single bit.</p><p>Unlike the Nine Sun Pill, which carried a strong Yang Qi, the medicinal energy of the Profound Emblem Harmony Pill was very gentle. After entering the meridians, it flowed throughout his body like spring rain, moistening everything quietly.</p><p>But Qin Sang felt a great change happening in his body, the damaged foundation had begun to show signs of recovery, making him overjoyed. </p><p>The Profound Rune Fusing Elixir works! </p><p>The most obvious change from the recovering foundation came from the Qi Sea, originally filled with spiritual power before taking the medicine, now it was a little deficient. </p><p>The spiritual power in the cave shook and gathered towards Qin Sang, but he only absorbed a very small strand of it, and the absorption was very slow. </p><p>However, this absorption was ongoing. </p><p>During this process, another change occurred to Qin Sang. </p><p>If there was someone else in the cave at the moment, they would be able to see that Qin Sang’s features had become slightly younger, originally appearing in his thirties, now back to the appearance of a youth in his twenties. </p><p>Qin Sang had no time to care about the change in his appearance, he was focusing on his Qi Sea intently, the excitement from earlier gone, even turning a little heavy. </p><p>When he first took the Profound Rune Fusing Elixir, the change to the Qi Sea was most obvious, but as time went on, this change was becoming slower and slower. Until the Qi Sea had recovered to ninety-five percent, it suddenly came to a stop. </p><p>The Profound Rune Fusing Elixir had only recovered half of his damaged foundation! </p><p>Qin Sang was full of unwillingness, trying to forcefully refine the remaining medicinal power, time passed slowly, but no matter how hard he tried, the speed of his foundation’s recovery was still negligible, and could almost be considered useless, a complete waste. </p><p>After many attempts, Qin Sang had no choice but to accept reality. </p><p>One Profound Rune Fusing Elixir was not enough to heal him. </p><p>The closer he got to healing, the harder it might become, Qin Sang could not guess how many elixirs like the Profound Rune Fusing Elixir he needed to fully recover his foundation. </p><p>Now, the Profound Rune Fusing Elixir’s medicinal power was beginning to disperse, if he didn’t make a decision soon, the medicinal power would all be wasted. </p><p>Qin Sang sighed in his heart, calming his emotions. </p><p>Regardless, it had still recovered half, right? </p><p>The remaining medicinal power could be used to improve his cultivation, it wasn’t a complete waste of effort. </p><p>After deciding, Qin Sang stimulated his Qi Sea, absorbing all the remaining medicinal power of the Profound Rune Fusing Elixir, and his cultivation level rose steadily. </p><p>The cave returned to silence. </p><p>Qin Sang sat still on the ice bed, his aura rising rapidly. </p><p>The frustration on his face gradually faded, eventually turning to complete peace.</p>
