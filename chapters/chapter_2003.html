<h1>Chapter 1994: A World in a Flower</h1><p>White sand carpeted the shore.</p><p>A gentle sea breeze carried the foam of the waves and the salty tang of the sea inland, as flocks of birds circled overhead, chirping and chattering.</p><p>From time to time, they would swoop down to the shore or into the water to peck at food, landing and taking off with a whoosh.</p><p>Suddenly, a streak of azure light abruptly intruded upon this scene, startling the birds into scattering.</p><p>Moments later, a vast shadow enveloped the land, and a great ship appeared in the sky, sailing from the horizon, cleaving through the wind.</p><p>This ship was the Cloudsoar Treasure Ship of the Cloudsoar Heaven Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the quiet room, his gaze piercing through the restrictive formation, looking out at the boundless sea.</p><p>The Azure Sky Dharma Assembly had already concluded, and Qin Sang was unconcerned with the scramble for benefits within.</p><p>What was truly gratifying was that they had finally achieved their goal, securing the Small Cave Heaven with the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>The progress had been smoother than they had anticipated.</p><p>After presenting the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar, there wasn't much resistance from within the Azure Sky Sect.  Patriarch Yu proactively used his connections to mediate, and combined with the efforts of Elder Lone Cloud and Sect Master Ying, Qin Sang ultimately acquired the Small Cave Heaven without much effort.</p><p>Many coveted the Small Cave Heaven, but no one else could offer a Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar. Even the most complete ruins couldn't sway the Azure Sky Sect.</p><p>Later, news spread that sects from Lushong Island had participated in this Azure Sky Dharma Assembly.</p><p>They hadn't come to pledge allegiance to the Azure Sky Sect, but rather for the Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>This indicated that remnants of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation likely existed beyond Moonriver Bay.</p><p>The vastness of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation was unimaginable; Moonriver Bay was merely a part of it!</p><p>The value of the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was undoubtedly higher than imagined, no wonder the Azure Sky Sect was willing to exchange a Small Cave Heaven for it.</p><p>A glimpse into the whole revealed the leopard's spots. Many harbored unusual thoughts about the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation. Elder Lone Cloud even lamented that handing over the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was somewhat hasty, as it might contain even greater secrets.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't feel any regret.</p><p>For him, the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar was an unexpected boon. He hadn't had any expectations for it, and was already quite satisfied with exchanging it for a Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>His foundation in the Great Thousand World was shallow, and even if the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation truly held some great secret, he lacked the strength to contend with the Azure Sky Sect.</p><p>Furthermore, the Azure Sky Sect had been searching for the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation for over a thousand years and had likely found many Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillars.</p><p>It was almost impossible for him to beat them to the punch and unravel the secrets of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation with just one pillar.</p><p>Moreover, he had already decided to leave and didn't want any further complications.  Less trouble was better.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang rubbed his fingers, feeling a smooth, warm touch.</p><p>He held a token in his hand, neither gold nor jade, the key to opening the beacon gate to the Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>The Azure Sky Sect had named this Small Cave Heaven the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven.</p><p>"Senior, we have now left the land of Moonriver Bay.  The islands west of Moonriver Bay are rather sparse. At our current speed, it will take another three days and two nights to reach Myriad Nettle Island."</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud sat cross-legged on the other side of the quiet room, but another person's voice emerged from his mouth, and he addressed Qin Sang as "senior."</p><p>This 'Elder Lone Cloud' was Yun Xi in disguise.</p><p>The real Elder Lone Cloud had disembarked at an earlier opportunity, concealing himself in the shadows. This was one of the measures taken to prevent being followed.</p><p>Treasure moved people's hearts, let alone a Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>When the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven was in the hands of the Azure Sky Sect, no one dared to entertain any wicked thoughts, but now, it was uncertain.</p><p>"Maintain the current speed," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Yun Xi replied. His master had instructed him to obey Qin Sang's commands before disembarking.</p><p>The blue sea and sky stretched endlessly.</p><p>The weather was excellent, the sun shone brightly, and the sea surface shimmered.</p><p>The Cloudsoar Treasure Ship flew unhurriedly through the sky, encountering no obstacles along the way.  On the evening of the third day, a vast shadow appeared on the sea ahead.</p><p>As they drew closer, they discovered it was a large island, the shadow cast by the island's mountains.</p><p>From afar, the island seemed to have almost no plains, only overlapping peaks and towering crags. Moreover, the soil and rocks on the mountain peaks displayed a faint crimson hue.</p><p>Even the island's vegetation mostly shared this color.</p><p>It was as if the rain that fell here wasn't water, but blood plasma, drenching the entire island to create this spectacle.</p><p>The cultivators enjoying the view from the ship's deck felt an inexplicable sense of unease and tightness in their chests.</p><p>Those with weaker willpower fidgeted, wanting to return to their quiet rooms to cultivate and regulate their qi. Others subconsciously wiped the smiles from their faces, their expressions turning solemn.</p><p>Among these people were several cultivators clad in dark red robes, who smiled upon seeing the island.</p><p>They were disciples of Myriad Nettle Island.</p><p>Noticing the unease of those around them, they exchanged glances, a smug look flashing in their eyes.  Joining forces, they cast a spell, red light appearing on their backs, revealing serpentine shadows.</p><p>This peculiar action attracted the attention of others.</p><p>The shadows behind these Myriad Nettle Island disciples weren't snakes, but the vines of a strange plant, winding like serpents. The tips resembled snake heads, opening their maws to spew out puffs of crimson mist.</p><p>The mist dispersed on the deck, scattering countless seeds, which floated towards everyone.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, do not worry. The sensation you experienced earlier is due to the influence of the island's grand formation. Carrying these spirit seeds will protect you from harm," one of the Myriad Nettle Island disciples announced.</p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone caught the spirit seeds, and the uncomfortable feeling indeed subsided.</p><p>"Senior, Myriad Nettle Mountain has arrived," Yun Xi reported, entering the quiet room.</p><p>"Proceed directly to the island!"</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the bow of the ship.</p><p>That day, after completing the transaction with Old Devil Zhen, the latter had returned directly to Myriad Nettle Island to heal his injuries, without bringing his disciples back.</p><p>After the Dharma Assembly concluded, Qin Sang spared no effort to escort the Myriad Nettle Island disciples back to their island.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Cloudsoar Treasure Ship sailed towards Myriad Nettle Island.</p><p>Just as they entered the airspace above Myriad Nettle Island, ripples appeared in the void, visible to the naked eye.  Thousand-zhang-long streaks of gray qi filled the sky, as if brewing a terrifying storm.</p><p>"What is that below!"</p><p>Someone on the ship cried out in alarm.</p><p>From the depths of the mountain range, strange lights suddenly erupted, and several colossal vines, thicker than mountain peaks, shot out, resembling coiling dragons as they writhed and danced in the sky.</p><p>The ends of these vines surprisingly bore human faces, their empty eyes staring fixedly.</p><p>Even the Cloudsoar Heaven Sect disciples, who had witnessed the Heavenly Oath of Thunder, were awestruck by these vines.</p><p>One of the vines flew to the bow of the ship, coming within arm's reach. The cultivators on board felt immense pressure, falling silent in fear.</p><p>The Myriad Nettle Island disciples on board knelt in unison, "Greetings, Master!"</p><p>"Thank you for your trouble, Daoist, in personally escorting them."</p><p>The human face on the vine spoke, Old Devil Zhen's voice emanating from it. "Zhen is currently healing his injuries and it's inconvenient for my true body to come out and greet you. I hope Daoist will forgive me."</p><p>"It's fine. This humble Daoist didn't come to disturb your healing," Qin Sang waved his hand, and the ship slowly descended, flying towards the heart of Myriad Nettle Island.</p><p>The Cloudsoar Treasure Ship docked at the mountain gate of Myriad Nettle Island. Tai Yi, Yu Lang, and the Cloudsoar Heaven Sect cultivators also disembarked, seemingly intending to stay for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang was invited to follow the vine towards Old Devil Zhen's cave dwelling.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang communicated with Old Devil Zhen through voice transmission. The latter didn't ask too many questions and readily agreed.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang, alone, quietly left Myriad Nettle Island.  The Cloudsoar Treasure Ship and the Cloudsoar Heaven Sect cultivators remained on the island as a diversion.</p><p>After confirming the direction, Qin Sang stealthily flew southwest. The Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven was in that direction.</p><p>...</p><p>After flying for an unknown distance, he finally found a deserted island.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the island.  Not long after, a figure quietly materialized beside him, Elder Lone Cloud.</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud gently shook his head. "I haven't detected any signs of being followed."</p><p>He glanced around. "Patriarch Yu and Sect Master Ying haven't arrived yet."</p><p>"They should be here soon."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>The two sat down on the ground. Qin Sang retrieved a shimmering stone from his Thousand Jun Ring and examined it in his hand.</p><p>This stone was a fragment of the Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation, which could aid Qin Sang in comprehending the grand formation.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had gradually grasped some of the profound mysteries of the Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation.</p><p>The starry sea had the Silver River, where countless stars converged, the most brilliant point of starlight. Legend had it that this was the Heavenly River, and the Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation only drew upon the power of the stars in this region.</p><p>The waters of the Heavenly River poured down, piercing through the heavens and earth.  Its weight was immeasurable, more than capable of shattering mountains and overturning seas.</p><p>Compared to Qin Sang's Four Symbols Sword Formation, the Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation had a brute-force quality, transforming stellar power into killing moves and unleashing them all at once. It wasn't as refined as the sword embodying the Four Symbols and Twenty-Eight Constellations.</p><p>However, this didn't mean the Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation was crude; it was simply a different approach.</p><p>Both belonged to the Star Dao, so Qin Sang could still gain some inspiration. His prior accumulation also helped him comprehend the Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation, which was why he quickly made progress.</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud knew that Qin Sang was comprehending a grand formation and didn't disturb him.</p><p>Seawater crashed against the reefs on the shore.</p><p>Night fell, then day broke. At dawn, Patriarch Yu and Sect Master Ying finally arrived.</p><p>The two came together.</p><p>Patriarch Yu cupped his hands. "We've kept you waiting. Sect Master Ying and I took a few extra precautions to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, which delayed us."</p><p>"Any findings?" Elder Lone Cloud asked.</p><p>"No trackers were found," Sect Master Ying smiled upon hearing that there were no issues here either. "It seems we were too cautious.  Anyone who dares to plot against us not only offends four Soul Formation cultivators but also risks incurring the wrath of the Azure Sky Sect. Moreover, the two of you just slew the old zombie, your reputations are at their peak."</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud noncommittally nodded. "Perhaps! I haven't heard of any rare treasures coming from the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven, so they might think it's not worth the risk. However, it's always best to be cautious."</p><p>With that said, the four of them activated their escape techniques and continued to fly southwest.</p><p>They flew over the vast sea.</p><p>The weather seemed to be changing.</p><p>The wind gradually picked up, and noticeable waves appeared on the sea surface. After flying for a while longer, the sky ahead turned gloomy, as if a storm was approaching.</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud calculated silently and exclaimed in surprise, "So the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven is here!"</p><p>Sect Master Ying looked over.  "Have you been here before? I recall passing through this area over thirteen hundred years ago. I noticed the frequent hurricanes in this sea region and found it strange. I searched for several months but found nothing. I didn't expect a Small Cave Heaven to be hidden here."</p><p>"Indeed, I've also heard that this sea region has volatile weather, but I didn't think much of it at the time.  I wonder if it's related to the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven."</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud and Sect Master Ying exchanged words, recounting their experiences from their travels.</p><p>They pieced together a picture of this sea region based on their impressions.</p><p>West of Moonriver Bay, islands were sparse, and this sea region was even more desolate, with almost no place to land, vast and barren.</p><p>Storms were frequent here, the weather harsh, and it wasn't suitable for mortals to live.  Since there were no apparent benefits, cultivators wouldn't come here intentionally.</p><p>As they spoke, the wind grew fiercer.</p><p>The token in Qin Sang's hand shimmered, activated by his true essence, sensing the exact location of the beacon.</p><p>After flying for several thousand li, Qin Sang's expression shifted. "Found it!"</p><p>With that, his speed increased dramatically, and the other three quickly followed.</p><p>Following the guidance of the token, Qin Sang plunged into the sea, the water parting before him.</p><p>After descending to an unknown depth, faint shimmering lights appeared ahead.</p><p>It was an underwater mountain, covered in peculiar plants. Some were as majestic as large trees, some resembled moss, and the most abundant were white flowers shaped like orchids.</p><p>The divine senses of the four Soul Formation cultivators swept across the area, finding no sign of sentient plant-based yao.</p><p>Qin Sang landed halfway up the mountain and found a crevice where a white flower grew.</p><p>The flower was in full bloom, its pale yellow stamen as fine as needles, exquisitely delicate.</p><p>The beacon of the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven lay within the stamen.</p><p>This flower happened to grow here, yet it was as if a single flower had blossomed into a small world.</p><p>"A world in a flower, truly not an exaggeration!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, and the other three deeply agreed.</p><p>The token flew up, and azure light flickered in the void. The four figures vanished without a trace.</p><p>As if passing through an invisible barrier, Qin Sang clearly sensed the change in the world around him.  He had left the Great Thousand World and entered a Small Thousand World.</p><p>'Splash...'</p><p>Torrential rain poured down.</p><p>Rain was everywhere, the downpour astonishingly heavy. If this were a mortal world, it would have been a catastrophic disaster.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A deafening roar echoed from the sky, yet it didn't sound like thunder.</p><p>"Conceal your auras!"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something amiss, his expression changing slightly as he warned the others.</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud and the other two reacted quickly, suppressing their Soul Formation auras. The void had begun to tremble as soon as they entered.</p><p>It was indeed a fragmented Small Thousand World, one that could accelerate its own destruction with the slightest carelessness.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky. Despite the heavy rain, there were no dark clouds, only a clear blue expanse.</p><p>It was all water!</p><p>The source of the downpour was a series of colossal waves, towering to the heavens, crashing down after reaching their peak.</p><p>They currently stood on the sea, where the storm was even more violent than outside.</p><p>In all directions, giant waves surged endlessly.</p><p>The four chose a random direction and flew for a while, unable to see the end of the storm. The entire Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven was a world of storms.</p><p>Finally, they saw the landmass of the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven.</p><p>Waves like towering walls continuously crashed against the land, relentlessly battering it.</p><p>The torrential rain also reached the land, turning it into a vast lake. Mountain peaks protruded from the water, enduring the onslaught of the rain.</p><p>"No wonder there are no mortals in the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven."</p><p>Elder Lone Cloud sighed. Mortals simply couldn't survive in such a place.</p><p>However, the Azure Empyrean Cave Heaven wasn't devoid of life. Various plants grew on the land.</p><p>Due to the environment, there were no delicate grasses here; all the plants were exceptionally tall and robust.</p><p>The plants had enormous canopies and thick roots like pythons, clinging tightly to the earth and rocks.</p><p>The roots of these plants had developed fine hairs, spreading across the land and water, dense like a carpet of grass. The land relied on them to withstand the erosion of the torrential rain.</p><p>"There are plant spirits," Elder Lone Cloud said.</p>
