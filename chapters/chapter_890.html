<h1>Chapter 882: Unfettered Freedom</h1><p>Suddenly, a faint sigh echoed through the hall, followed by a deep, unfamiliar male voice. "Junior Brother Chen, Fellow Daoist Huayang is a guest from afar. You must show him respect."</p><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p>Cultivator Chen suppressed his anger. "Senior Brother, Sect Master, you've returned."</p><p>Elder Huayang raised his head slightly. Facing the Sect Master of the Smoke and Mist Pavilion, even he dared not be disrespectful, unlike his treatment of Cultivator Chen.</p><p>He bowed towards the empty air. "This old Daoist visited the Smoke and Mist Pavilion, hoping to discuss some matters with Fellow Daoist Qi. I didn't expect him to be absent..."</p><p>"I was attending to some business outside the sect and just returned. Due to pressing matters, I'm unable to meet Fellow Daoist Huayang in person. I hope you'll forgive me."</p><p>The speaker was indeed Sect Master Qi of the Smoke and Mist Pavilion.</p><p>He spoke as if unaware of the previous events, his tone casual, like a friend chatting.</p><p>The Avatar stood with his hands down, appearing honest and obedient.</p><p>Within his Qi sea, the Sky-Eye Butterfly remained hidden, not daring to move.</p><p>This was a renowned expert of Orchid Island, nearing Nascent Soul cultivation, even more powerful than Xiang Yi.</p><p>Fortunately, the second transformation of the Sky-Eye Butterfly could conceal itself from the perception of Core Formation cultivators. As long as he remained cautious, there was no need to worry about being discovered.</p><p>As long as the Avatar didn't stand with Qin Sang, he wouldn't be easily exposed.</p><p>Elder Huayang said repeatedly, "It was presumptuous of this old Daoist to visit uninvited. How could I blame Fellow Daoist Qi? You should be aware of the matter I discussed with Junior Brother Chen earlier. This old Daoist isn't one to seize by force, but I'm compelled by circumstances. Of course, we won't let your pavilion suffer any losses. If there are suitable disciples, we will compensate your pavilion generously..."</p><p>Sect Master Qi chuckled. "The Smoke and Mist Pavilion and the Orchid Island Sect are one. There's no need to talk about compensation. It's just a few disciples; they can cultivate anywhere."</p><p>His implication was that he seemed to agree to Elder Huayang's request, without any conditions.</p><p>This surprised Elder Huayang; he didn't expect Sect Master Qi to be so straightforward.</p><p>Although Sect Master Qi was almost repeating his previous words, with a hint of mockery, Elder Huayang could only pretend not to notice.</p><p>"Senior Brother!"</p><p>Cultivator Chen was extremely displeased that the Sect Master would say such a thing.</p><p>Elder Huayang turned and bowed to Cultivator Chen. "I apologize for my earlier offense, Junior Brother.  Please don't take it to heart. As you know, our Yin-Yang lineage has stringent requirements for disciples. Talent alone isn't enough. Among these disciples, there might not be a single one who meets our criteria."</p><p>"Or you might take them all!" Cultivator Chen retorted sarcastically.</p><p>"Junior Brother Chen..."</p><p>Sect Master Qi called out to him and transmitted a message.</p><p>Cultivator Chen's face flushed with anger. He snorted coldly but said no more, turning to leave.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>At that moment, Elder Huayang suddenly flashed in front of Cultivator Chen, blocking his path. He pointed at Fang Ting behind him. "This young lady is also a newly admitted disciple, isn't she? Perhaps she could also try the Yin-Yang Disc..."</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>Cultivator Chen, already suppressing his anger, now saw Elder Huayang's attention turn to Fang Ting. Enraged, he disregarded the hall's rules and drew his blade.</p><p>The blade flashed like autumn water, a swift, cold light heading straight for the old Daoist's face.</p><p>Elder Huayang seemed prepared. He flicked his duster, countless white threads shooting out. His cultivation was a level higher than Cultivator Chen's, and he showed no fear.</p><p>The others in the hall hadn't reacted yet.</p><p>Just then, dense runes suddenly appeared on the walls of the hall. The air tightened inexplicably, and the blade's light vanished into thin air. The threads from the duster also disappeared, returning to their original form.</p><p>"Enough! Junior Brother Chen, have you forgotten the ancestral decree forbidding the use of weapons in the ancestral hall! If you dare to disobey again, I will have to enforce the sect rules!"</p><p>Then, Sect Master Qi turned to Elder Huayang coldly. "Fellow Daoist Huayang, although my Smoke and Mist Pavilion is a small sect, we do not allow anyone to disrespect our rules."</p><p>"It was reckless of me."</p><p>Elder Huayang didn't argue, only looking at Fang Ting. "I merely saw the young lady's spiritual aura and was delighted, losing my composure."</p><p>Sect Master Qi sighed. "This girl does have talent, but Junior Brother Chen has already taken her as his personal disciple. I cannot give her to you, Fellow Daoist Huayang."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Elder Huayang was reluctant to give up. "I see no Smoke and Mist Pavilion token on the young lady. She must be a new disciple who hasn't formally taken a master yet, right?"</p><p>Cultivator Chen, suppressed by the ancestral hall's power, couldn't speak, his face red with frustration.</p><p>"Young lady, you must know of the Orchid Island Sect. If you join our sect, not only will our Yin-Yang lineage cultivate you with all our resources, but you can also ask the Sect Master personally to guide your cultivation if you encounter any obstacles in the future. The profound power of a Nascent Soul ancestor is an opportunity countless cultivators dream of..."</p><p>Elder Huayang ignored Cultivator Chen, trying to persuade Fang Ting.</p><p>Fang Ting, having never experienced such a situation, was at a loss.</p><p>Sect Master Qi spoke calmly. "I'm afraid I must disappoint Fellow Daoist Huayang. Fang Ting has been guided by Junior Brother Chen since childhood and has already acknowledged him as her master.  Junior Brother Chen only wanted to temper her character, so he let her come to the Smoke and Mist Pavilion alone to participate in this ceremony."</p><p>Fang Ting finally reacted and quickly said, "I will listen to my master."</p><p>"So that's how it is."</p><p>Elder Huayang looked disappointed.</p><p>His sharp eyes had discerned that the others were mediocre, but Fang Ting was exceptional, no worse than the top disciples the Orchid Island Sect had previously recruited.</p><p>He had disregarded his dignity and personally come to the Smoke and Mist Pavilion to snatch disciples, aiming for someone with Fang Ting's top-tier talent.</p><p>Others felt sorry for Fang Ting.</p><p>A Nascent Soul ancestor!  What a great fortune to be guided by one. Yet, the young lady had missed this opportunity.</p><p>The Avatar, however, felt that her choice might not be a bad thing.</p><p>The Orchid Island Sect was powerful and resource-rich, but the competition was also fiercer. How much effort the Yin-Yang lineage would invest in her was uncertain.</p><p>The so-called guidance from a Nascent Soul ancestor sounded wonderful, but it was just a promise.</p><p>Back in Mount Shaohua, before reaching Core Formation, Qin Sang hadn't even met a Nascent Soul ancestor. Only exceptional figures like Qiu Mubai could catch the eye of a Nascent Soul ancestor and receive their personal attention.</p><p>Qin Sang had realized this through his cultivation journey.</p><p>Low-level cultivators had their difficulties, and Nascent Soul ancestors weren't free from worries either.</p><p>Not to mention that the overall strength of cultivators in the Canglang Sea far surpassed that of the Small Cold Realm, the situation was far more complex, with Nascent Soul ancestors still having Late-stage Grand Cultivators above them.</p><p>The tribulation that came every three hundred years was a death warrant hanging over their heads!</p><p>Advance, or die.</p><p>"Junior Brother Chen, take Fang Ting and leave. I sentence you to a year of confinement to cultivate your character. I don't want to see similar behavior again."</p><p>Sect Master Qi removed the ancestral hall's restrictions.</p><p>The pressure on Cultivator Chen dissipated, and he walked out of the hall without looking back.</p><p>Fang Ting quickly followed.</p>
