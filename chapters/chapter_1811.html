<h1>Chapter 1802: Gauntlets and Sword Weapons</h1><p>Shi Bai.</p><p>Xu Yi.</p><p>Master Lingxu's Manor.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Northern Polar Exorcism Academy and went straight to this place. Upon meeting Master Lingxu, he received good news.</p><p>“It’s been a few years. Unexpectedly, fellow Daoist has joined our ranks. Congratulations! Congratulations!”</p><p>Master Lingxu saw Qin Sang and praised him.</p><p>“Thanks to Master Lingxu’s help all those years ago, and for persuading Master Xing Qiong to come out of seclusion, I was able to achieve this,”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke the truth.</p><p>Without Bei Gong Nan Dou's help in refining talismans to infuse his star energy, it would have taken countless more efforts to break through and his tribulation would not have been so smooth.</p><p>“That was simply my duty, little brother. No need to be so polite,”</p><p>Master Lingxu pulled Qin Sang to sit down, his expression friendly and eager.  “After you left last time, I shamelessly wrote to several old fellows requesting some Hundred-Knot Bamboo. And I have news.”</p><p>“Oh?  Which fellow Daoist has the Hundred-Knot Bamboo?”</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly had broken through on its own and didn't need the Frost-Glaze Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang had been collecting materials for so long, and the recipe was only missing one ingredient. Naturally, he didn't want to give up halfway. Once he made the Frost-Glaze Pill, he could give it to the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>“That old fellow’s dharma name is Gu Zheng. He's from the Celestial Physician Department of the Tianshu Academy. His alchemy skills far surpass mine, but he rarely refines pills outside the Dao Court, hence his lack of fame. You might not have heard of him.”</p><p>Master Lingxu gave a brief introduction.</p><p>“Someone from the Dao Court?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious.</p><p>In this world, Daoism flourishes, with the Dao Court holding the highest position.  Whether in terms of power or various esoteric practices, the Dao Court surely has no shortage of experts.</p><p>Visiting these people would likely solve all of Qin Sang's problems.</p><p>However, Qin Sang deliberately avoided the Dao Court; Master Lingxu and Master Gu both came from the Palace Observatory lineage.</p><p>Although the Palace Observatories and the Dao Court were closely related, after prolonged contact, the differences were still noticeable.</p><p>The Dao Court's strict structure and vast power created immense pressure, and Qin Sang always avoided it whenever possible.</p><p>“Is Master Gu Zheng willing to part with it?” Qin Sang asked, frowning.</p><p>Master Lingxu nodded. “Hundred-Knot Bamboo is rare. The Dao Court treasures countless medicinal herbs far more valuable than Hundred-Knot Bamboo.  Old Daoist Gu Zheng has seen a lot, and even if we offer better treasures, it's hard to sway him. However, Old Daoist Gu Zheng is interested in the Frost-Glaze Pill recipe.  I dare not decide without your permission.”</p><p>He and Qin Sang had agreed that the recipe could not be passed on.</p><p>So that’s it.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly thought this was a multi-party exchange, one recipe in exchange for a piece of Hundred-Knot Bamboo and Master Lingxu's refining services.</p><p>Whether it’s worthwhile is entirely up to him.</p><p>As long as he didn't reveal the *Pan Hu Zhen Jing*, selling a few recipes wouldn't bother the Ghost Mother.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang said, “Master, don’t reveal my origins. Just say the recipe was obtained unexpectedly by you.”</p><p>Master Lingxu was slightly stunned, sensing Qin Sang's wariness of the Dao Court.</p><p>This was normal. Anyone facing such a behemoth would be cautious, especially since Qin Sang was from Jushan.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Master Lingxu nodded, then suddenly looked at him with anticipation. “Little brother, in these years searching for similar recipes, have you had any new discoveries?”</p><p>The old Daoist's expression was like a child anticipating a new toy, causing Qin Sang to marvel at the appeal of recipes to alchemists.</p><p>“After returning, I carefully searched and managed to compile a recipe, but I don't know if it can be refined,” Qin Sang took out a jade slip he had prepared.</p><p>The jade slip contained a recipe for a pill called Ying Hua Dan.</p><p>Ying Hua Dan was one of the pills recorded in the *Pan Hu Zhen Jing*.  Its efficacy was weaker, but it was the easiest to refine. When a spirit insect was at the fifth transformation stage, it could enhance its cultivation.</p><p>However, this effect was secondary. The pill's greatest use was that, through continuous consumption, it could subtly weaken the barriers between minor cultivation stages, laying a solid foundation for future breakthroughs.</p><p>This pill needed to be used with the *Pan Hu Zhen Jing* to maximize its effect; otherwise, the effect would be greatly reduced.</p><p>Previously, using his avatar, Qin Sang had dabbled in alchemy and achieved some accomplishments. If he continued to study alchemy, one day he could refine Ying Hua Dan himself.</p><p>After careful consideration, his alchemy skills were far less profound than his weapon refinement skills. Qin Sang decided to temporarily abandon alchemy.</p><p>His avatar was still there and could potentially handle it, but he himself could hardly spare the time.</p><p>Re-refining an avatar to reach the Divine Transformation stage would take an unknown amount of time, and insufficient cultivation would hinder his progress.</p><p>To find the path to ascension, he needed to improve his strength as soon as possible.  Studying alchemy, collecting medicinal herbs, and refining pills would all consume a great deal of time and energy. It's better to leave it to others.</p><p>Master Lingxu was overjoyed. He took the recipe and eagerly examined it.</p><p>"All spirit flowers. This should be Ninefold Serpent Stamen.  Hmm, the spirit flowers needed in this recipe are even more precious, but thankfully not too rare…"</p><p>Master Lingxu became engrossed, muttering to himself, seemingly forgetting Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>When he came to his senses, he found an extra jade box on the table. Inside was a demon core.</p><p>"This is…?"</p><p>Master Lingxu's expression showed surprise.</p><p>The aura of the demon core indicated it belonged to a mid-stage Dongxuan demon, but it lacked the aggressive intent usually found in demonic beasts' cores.</p><p>Because of this lingering ferocity, demonic beast cores are less valuable than those of normal demons.</p><p>The owner of this core was a Demon Lord!</p><p>Master Lingxu looked at Qin Sang with shock. "Little brother, you killed a mid-stage Dongxuan Demon Lord?"</p><p>It was indeed Li Hou's core.</p><p>"Pure luck, I encountered a severely wounded Demon Lord," Qin Sang said calmly. "How many of the herbs in this recipe can this core buy?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Master Lingxu couldn't immediately answer.</p><p>Qin Sang decisively said, "Master, could you help me acquire the herbs? I want to use them all to refine Yinghua Pills—as many as possible! If this core isn't enough, I'll hunt more demonic beasts in the Evil Origin."</p><p>Cultivating the *Panhu True Scripture* helps my cultivation and my spirit insect's growth, but bottlenecks still exist. I can only provide limited assistance to my insect. With sufficient Yinghua Pills, I won't have to worry about the Tianmu Butterfly before its sixth transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was brimming with confidence, as if demonic beast cores were readily available.</p><p>Master Lingxu was puzzled.  Was he really only a newly entered Dongxuan cultivator?</p><p>Studying Qin Sang, Master Lingxu thought he needed to reassess his younger brother.  Since he intended to refine the pills himself, he naturally had no reason to refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang had intended to discuss the compensation for refining the pills with Master Lingxu, as he wouldn't only refine one batch, and might need Master Lingxu's help repeatedly.</p><p>Normally, when commissioning a pill refiner, the recipe is usually given as compensation.</p><p>However, Master Lingxu flatly refused.</p><p>After their discussion, Master Lingxu decided to visit Master Guzhen soon to exchange for Hundred-Section Earth Bamboo to refine Qingshuang Pills.</p><p>Qin Sang waited for the pills to be ready before leaving, so he borrowed a refining room from Master Lingxu, which was readily granted.</p><p>…</p><p>In the refining room.</p><p>Qin Sang sat quietly for a long time.</p><p>Master Lingxu was not at home, and an acolyte guarded the door, leaving Qin Sang undisturbed.</p><p>Several items were placed before him.</p><p>The Huifeng Armor.</p><p>Scales of the Wood Jiao.</p><p>Li Hou's rib bone spike and a pair of claw gauntlets.</p><p>In addition, there were some spirit materials and demonic beast bones found in Li Hou's storage pouch.</p><p>He considered how to refine them for his own use.</p><p>The claw gauntlets and bone spike, having been refined by Li Hou for many years, had similar auras.  Using refining techniques, there was a chance to fuse them together.</p><p>The bone spike alone was comparable to a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang already possessed the Huiying Sword and the Four-Riding Serpent Seal; the Yunyou Sword was nearing completion. He decided to refine a pair of blood-powered gauntlets. He couldn't rely solely on his bare fists in battle.</p><p>He had consulted Master Gu on this and had a general idea.</p><p>Refining the gauntlets himself, and consulting Master Gu, and later personally repairing the Broken Drum, were all aimed at improving his refining skills.</p><p>His ultimate goal was to quickly complete the Yunyou Sword and repair the Taiyi Star Chariot as soon as possible.</p><p>He might need this treasure when searching for the path to ascension and the Dao Marker Gate.</p><p>Lost in thought, he sketched out the gauntlets in his mind, his gaze sweeping over the various treasures before him, finally putting away the Huifeng Armor.</p><p>He had originally planned to incorporate the Wood Jiao scales into the Huifeng Armor, but after consideration, Qin Sang decided to use them all to refine the gauntlets.</p><p>The first step was shaping.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the spirit fire in the refining room and began to refine all the materials, removing impurities.</p><p>For difficult-to-refine materials, he used the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Gradually, numerous small and large spheres floated in the refining room, some liquid, some pure beads.</p><p>Only the Wood Jiao scales, the bone spike, and the claw gauntlets remained.</p><p>One by one, the green scales flew into Qin Sang's palm, shrinking under the tempering of the spirit fire, their luster becoming even more dazzling.</p><p>Then came the bone spike and the claw gauntlets.</p><p>These three items were fused together, forming the structure of the gauntlets, and finally a pair of roughly formed gauntlets appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>The gauntlets were only the size of a fist, with a flowing green light and beautiful fish scale patterns, as if made of stacked fish scales.</p><p>Three sharp, slightly curved spikes protruded from each knuckle of the gauntlet, glinting menacingly.  Exceedingly sharp, they could easily pierce enemy defenses, making it a formidable weapon.</p><p>Qin Sang adjusted his creation, nodded in satisfaction, and infused the small spheres into the gauntlet, reinforcing its structure and adding detail.</p><p>Shaping complete, the next crucial step was to inscribe the restrictions and runes, which would determine the gauntlet's power. This step was equivalent to opening meridians in the gauntlet; the restrictions and runes were like the meridians themselves, a process alchemists called "connecting the Qi pathways."</p><p>The choice of restrictions and runes, their combination, and their compatibility with the user all required careful consideration.  </p><p>Since Qin Sang was crafting this for himself, the process was simpler, but still incredibly slow. Months passed before he even had a rough draft.</p><p>During the process, Qin Sang gained valuable insights and much to ponder, realizing that this couldn't be rushed. So he stopped working on it.</p><p>Master Lingxu returned unexpectedly. Seeing Qin Sang emerge from seclusion, he immediately pulled him into the hall, produced a jade vial, stroked his beard, and smiled, "Mission accomplished!"</p><p>The vial contained three pills.</p><p>The green pills were coated in a fine layer of white frost, like wisps of white clouds drifting in a clear blue sky.</p><p>Three Frost-Covered Pills!</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted and deeply impressed by Master Lingxu's skill.  According to the formula, a batch of Frost-Covered Pills, if all the herbs were top-quality and other conditions near perfect, could yield four pills. Knowing that the herbs Qin Sang had collected were of varying quality, the fact that Master Lingxu had produced three was a testament to his exceptional alchemy.</p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Qin Sang expressed his gratitude, inwardly thinking that if the Fire Jade Centipede didn't break through after consuming three Frost-Covered Pills, he'd just have to let nature take its course.</p><p>Gathering the herbs for the Yinhua Dan would take time, so Qin Sang didn't linger, taking his leave from Master Lingxu.</p><p>…</p><p>Northern Zhongmao Prefecture.  The Miaotong Altar.</p><p>Leaving Master Lingxu's residence, Qin Sang came to this altar. He was going to visit a faction called Dianjinshan.</p><p>Dianjinshan was quite well-known in the Daoist community for its expertise in crafting artifacts. Its Dianjing Pavilion had branches in many prefectures.  However, Dianjinshan's main mountain gate wasn't in a prefecture; it was located in a more remote area under a prefecture's jurisdiction.  After some inquiries, Qin Sang chose Dianjinshan.</p><p>He changed his appearance, flew from the prefecture, landed at the city gate of the administrative area, entered the city, and found the Dianjing Pavilion.</p><p>Entering the pavilion, Qin Sang simply said he wanted to have an artifact appraised. A servant girl led him to the back hall where he met an artifact refiner from Dianjinshan.</p><p>He instantly saw through the refiner's cultivation level.</p><p>Qin Sang sat down unceremoniously, "I hear the Dianjinshan Sect Leader is a master refiner. I've come a long way, hoping to have a treasure appraised by him, but I'm not sure how to arrange a meeting."</p><p>The refiner remained impassive, "If the artifact is rare enough, the Sect Leader will certainly meet you personally."</p><p>Qin Sang produced a wooden box and placed it on the table, "If you want to look, go ahead."</p><p>The refiner took it.  Soon, sweat beaded on his brow; he couldn't even break the box's restrictions. He instantly understood.</p><p>He looked at Qin Sang with awe, quickly stood up, and respectfully said, "Please wait, sir. I'll go fetch the Sect Leader!"</p><p>A servant girl brought fragrant tea.</p><p>Qin Sang waited in the quiet room for an incense stick's worth of time when a knock came. A square-faced Daoist entered.</p><p>The Daoist was serious and expressionless, bowing deeply upon entering, "My apologies for the poor service, sir."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and smiled back, "It was my fault for visiting unannounced."</p><p>The Daoist was the Dianjinshan Sect Leader. He sat opposite Qin Sang, and without asking about Qin Sang's identity or the treasure, he obtained permission and opened the box.</p><p>The box seemed empty; the bottom of the box was completely visible.</p><p>The Dianjinshan Sect Leader's gaze sharpened. He carefully reached out and lifted the Chengying Sword.</p><p>In his hands, the transparent blade was invisible, leaving only a faint shadow on the table.</p><p>"With some more refining texts from Dianjinshan, combined with my previous knowledge, I should be able to craft the gauntlet flawlessly…"  Qin Sang sipped his tea, pondering inwardly.</p><p>Golden light surged from the Dianjinshan Sect Leader's palms; his hands looked like cast iron. The golden light enveloped the Chengying Sword, illuminating the golden blade. Clearly, he was using a unique secret technique to examine it. He then tried several other techniques.</p><p>Doubt flickered in the Dianjinshan Sect Leader's eyes. He hesitated, "This might not be a sword."</p><p>"Not a sword?" Qin Sang was surprised and confused.</p><p>The Dianjinshan Sect Leader nodded, "At least, it's not any type of sword I've ever seen.  Perhaps my knowledge is lacking.  But I suspect it's not an artifact, magical treasure, or anything like a legendary true treasure. It's a peculiar item.  Perhaps… a sword cultivator expert could shed some light on it."</p>
