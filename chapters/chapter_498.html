<h1>## Chapter 491: Possession</h1><p>The Flying Yaksha pressed a hand against the stone door, spectral energy surging as it touched the barrier.</p><p>A cold snort echoed from within.</p><p>"Didn't I tell you not to disturb me unless it's a matter of utmost urgency?"</p><p>*That voice…*</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, a flicker of unease in his heart. The voice sounded strangely familiar, somewhat like Ji Wu's, yet completely different in tone.</p><p>There was no time to dwell on such details.</p><p>The thought barely registered before Qin Sang commanded the Flying Yaksha to break the barrier with full force. Simultaneously, he channeled the power of the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation, sending ghostfire surging towards the stone door to assist the yaksha.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>With a thunderous roar, the barrier on the stone door flickered briefly before shattering.</p><p>Unable to withstand the force, the heavy stone door crumbled under the Flying Yaksha's claw.</p><p>Rubble flew, dust billowed.</p><p>Fearless, the Flying Yaksha charged into the room. Qin Sang's gaze pierced through the dust, quickly scanning the interior for Ji Wu.</p><p>His plan was to eliminate Ji Wu first, then focus on the Dove Robe Daoist, which would increase his chances of survival.</p><p>Tension gripped Qin Sang. The opportunity was fleeting; only by catching his opponents off guard, before they could join forces, did he have a chance of succeeding.</p><p>He had to seize it!</p><p>The stone chamber was bare.</p><p>Its furnishings were spartan, with only a single cushion on the floor. A spirit gathering formation was set up within, its layout visible at a glance.</p><p>The scene within astonished Qin Sang.</p><p>He easily located Ji Wu, seated on the cushion, but the Dove Robe Daoist was nowhere to be seen. Even if the Daoist's physical body had been destroyed, his golden core or nascent soul should have remained.</p><p>Apart from Ji Wu, there was nothing!</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>Despite the sudden attack, Ji Wu remained impassive, seated cross-legged on the cushion, his gaze fixed on the Flying Yaksha and Qin Sang.</p><p>His expression, his tone... Qin Sang had never seen them before.</p><p>Ji Wu's aura was overwhelmingly powerful. Qin Sang felt a tightness in his chest under his gaze, a pressure he had only experienced in the presence of Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Though this Ji Wu looked identical to the one he knew, Qin Sang was certain they were not the same person!</p><p>A flicker of realization struck him.</p><p>"Possession?"</p><p>Astonishment filled Qin Sang.</p><p>The Dove Robe Daoist had chosen to possess Ji Wu, and it seemed he had succeeded. Ji Wu had been completely transformed; it was more accurate to call him the Dove Robe Daoist now.</p><p>No wonder!</p><p>No wonder the Dove Robe Daoist had treated Ji Wu like a son, sparing no effort to support his cultivation even while severely injured and in desperate need of medicinal pills, pushing him all the way to the Pseudo Core Realm.</p><p>Ji Wu had been a vessel prepared by the Dove Robe Daoist for himself!</p><p>The Dove Robe Daoist's plan was cunning. Ji Wu must have been carefully chosen. Once his golden core recovered and Ji Wu reached the Pseudo Core Realm, he would perform the possession, changing his identity.</p><p>Then, under the guise of Ji Wu, he could move freely within the Small Cold Region, no longer fearing pursuit from the Yuan Zhao Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the Dove Robe Daoist's summoning of Huang Shizhong back might not be entirely innocent either.</p><p>It was a perfect plan. Perhaps, over the years, during Ji Wu's cultivation, the Dove Robe Daoist had subtly planted seeds of control.</p><p>A wave of sadness washed over Qin Sang. Ji Wu had diligently traveled far and wide, searching for medicinal pills for the Dove Robe Daoist—the master he revered. He had almost failed to escape from Finger Peak, yet chose the Returning Restoration Pill over the Profound Truth Pill.</p><p>What had gone through Ji Wu's mind in his final moments, when he learned the truth?</p><p>Could he rest in peace in the afterlife?</p><p>Seeing no response, the Dove Robe Daoist glanced outside the stone chamber before asking again, "It seems Mo Yan has already perished by your hand! My Demonic Flame Sect lives in seclusion, and Ji has no acquaintance with either of you. What grievance do you have with us that you would attack our sect and slay our expert?"</p><p>"Ji?"</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed, not bothering with pleasantries. He barked a single word: "Kill!"</p><p>The Dove Robe Daoist, already under attack, instead of retaliating, remained seated calmly, inquiring about their grievances and the possibility of resolution. Qin Sang didn't believe he possessed such a gentle temperament.</p><p>There must be a reason he couldn't or wouldn't rise, attempting to stall for time. Perhaps the possession was incomplete, or the Returning Restoration Pill hadn't been fully refined!</p><p>Qin Sang felt no obligation to answer his questions, nor would he reveal his identity. Without hesitation, he ordered the Flying Yaksha to attack.</p><p>Spectral energy erupted from the Flying Yaksha as it lunged into the stone chamber, its form a blur.</p><p>The Dove Robe Daoist's expression shifted as his intentions were exposed. He glared at Qin Sang with venomous eyes. "To dare act so brazenly before Ji with a mere insignificant corpse puppet—you court death!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, his figure flickered, finally leaving the cushion.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Flying Yaksha arrived, but its sharp claws only tore through an afterimage.</p><p>Then, it abruptly twisted its arm and swung.</p><p>*Thump!*</p><p>A muffled sound echoed.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha unleashed a wave of spectral energy, forcing the Dove Robe Daoist, who had attempted to ambush Qin Sang, out of the shadows.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang dodged behind the Flying Yaksha, deploying the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation beside him.</p><p>The first clash between the Flying Yaksha and the Dove Robe Daoist seemed evenly matched.</p><p>"A Flying Yaksha!"</p><p>Forced to abandon his attempt on Qin Sang's life, the Dove Robe Daoist steadied himself, taking a long look at the Flying Yaksha. His gaze then shifted to where Qin Sang was hidden, his eyes flickering. He no longer concealed his recognition. "The Ten Yama Banners! Who are you?! To enter without triggering the spirit formation, I must know you!"</p><p>Hidden within the formation, Qin Sang felt a mixture of relief and alarm.</p><p>Relief that the Flying Yaksha hadn't disappointed him, capable of escaping even if it couldn't win. Alarm that the Dove Robe Daoist, having just performed a possession, still displayed such formidable strength, showing no signs of injury. Had the Returning Restoration Pill completely healed him?</p><p>He ignored the Dove Robe Daoist's question, continuing to command the Flying Yaksha's relentless assault.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Within the dim stone chamber, only two dark figures could be seen moving at incredible speeds, indistinguishable from each other. The sounds of their clashes echoed, chaotic spiritual energy flying everywhere.</p><p>The stone chamber's barrier, already weakened by Qin Sang, was now riddled with holes.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>Finally, unable to bear the strain, the stone chamber collapsed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained within the formation, channeling ghostfire to aid the Flying Yaksha, though its effect was minimal.</p><p>He still hadn't used his two magical treasures.</p><p>As the battle continued, Qin Sang noticed that the Dove Robe Daoist's condition wasn't as perfect as it appeared. The strength he displayed was not as terrifying as the true Golden Core cultivators Qin Sang had encountered before.</p><p>There was a chance!</p>
