<h1>Chapter 1622: Blood Sacrifice</h1><p>Chapter 1622: Blood Sacrifice</p><p>On the sheer cliff.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and the others had already passed the halfway point, ascending along a stone path leading directly to the summit.  This was the quickest of all the paths, but it was heavily guarded. Even with their considerable abilities, the four of them felt mentally exhausted and had to stop to rest.</p><p>They were getting closer to the summit, but couldn't see what was there. A ring of crimson mist obscured their vision, swirling just below the peak. The mist was dense and persistent, blocking their view. Other restrictions lay between them and the mist, making its source unclear.</p><p>The four joined forces, breaking through layers of barriers, finally reaching the bottom of the crimson mist.  They looked up.</p><p>The mist was thick, like a viscous, unyielding liquid. It not only blocked their vision, but also thwarted any attempts to use abilities like spiritual sight.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao concealed the golden light in his eyes, falling into thought.  Due to their prior encounter with the strange-faced man, the  Qi Ling Dongzhu was more familiar with Zhu Wu Dao, standing closest beside him.  The Swordsman stood to their right, at the same level, but maintaining some distance. Mo Xing Dao remained at the rear, largely silent and seemingly detached.</p><p>The Swordsman sent a strand of spiritual energy into the mist.  The mist reacted like a malignant growth, spreading along the spiritual energy towards him. Feeling a chilling sensation, the Swordsman quickly severed the connection, turning to Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>“Zhu Dao you, what kind of barrier is this red mist?”</p><p>At the beginning of their ascent, the Swordsman and the others had openly followed Zhu Wu Dao, clearly intending to share in any rewards. They weren't sure of Zhu Wu Dao's intentions and remained wary of his potential betrayal. The atmosphere had been tense.</p><p>During the climb, however, Zhu Wu Dao had remained calm, seemingly unconcerned about others sharing the spoils.  Their close cooperation in overcoming the restrictions had eased the tension, and they began to communicate. Therefore, the Swordsman felt comfortable directly asking Zhu Wu Dao for his assessment.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao gazed at the mist and mused, “If I'm not mistaken, we are currently standing on the Wu Xiang Xianmen disciples' Path of Refinement.”</p><p>“Path of Refinement?”</p><p>The Swordsman repeated the words thoughtfully.  The name suggested the path's purpose, but they hadn't experienced anything unusual along the way. And if it was a Path of Refinement prepared by the Wu Xiang Xianmen for their disciples, this cliff couldn't be a forbidden area, accessible to all.</p><p>Could the Wu Xiang Xianmen have deliberately placed the teleportation array here as a deception?</p><p>The Swordsman believed Zhu Wu Dao wouldn’t have ascended the cliff without a purpose; the Tian Tong Palace teleportation array must be at the summit.</p><p>“The Path of Refinement has become like this… this final barrier must be at its last gasp…”</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao sighed, shaking his head. Without any defensive measures, he stepped into the crimson mist.  The three others followed suit.</p><p>As soon as they entered, the crimson mist reacted, swirling violently, converging towards them, emanating a strange energy fluctuation.</p><p>The next moment, a long howl erupted from within the mist.</p><p>The sound was like thunder, continuous and resonant. A large hole suddenly appeared in the center of the mist, with flashes of light from treasures and abilities.</p><p>The howl, amplified by other treasures, pierced the mist and rapidly spread outwards, dispersing the remaining crimson mist until it completely vanished!</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao fell silent; the howling stopped.  Qi Ling Dongzhu and the others also withdrew their abilities, eagerly rushing to the summit.</p><p>The final barrier broken, the clifftop was revealed.</p><p>And then, they were all stunned.</p><p>The summit was completely empty!</p><p>The area was flat and clearly artificially levelled, but there was no teleportation array as they had expected, not even a single building!</p><p>The Swordsman's expression darkened.  “Zhu Dao you, what is going on?”</p><p>“Dao you, don't worry,” Zhu Wu Dao said confidently, “The Xian Palace is the greatest secret of the Wu Xiang Xianmen; they wouldn't leave the teleportation array out in the open. After the demonic upheaval, the Wu Xiang Xianmen completely sealed the teleportation array.  We'll need to make some effort to activate it.”</p><p>So he was indeed after the teleportation array!</p><p>The Swordsman’s expression softened slightly.</p><p>“The teleportation array can directly transmit you into the Xian Palace?” Mo Xing Yu couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao stepped forward.  “The Wu Xiang Xianmen dominates the Central Plains precisely because of this teleportation array to Tian Tong Palace, firmly controlling the Xian Palace.”</p><p>"Without the chaos of the demonic disturbance, no one could likely challenge the status of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect,"  </p><p>Hearing this, the Crying Spirit Cave Master was uneasy. "Are you certain the teleportation array is undamaged?"</p><p>"Although the Immortal Palace was later occupied by the Daoist and Buddhist sects, the teleportation array's location within the palace was extremely secretive, almost impossible to find from the outside, unless the Wuxiang Immortal Sect themselves destroyed it…"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao spoke as he walked to the center of the mountaintop, surveying his surroundings.</p><p>Then, he flicked his finger, sending out a beam of light.</p><p>Within the light seemed to be a crystal stele, but before anyone could see it clearly, it vanished underground.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao and the other two couldn't help but glance at Zhu Wu Dao again.</p><p>This man knew far too many secrets!</p><p>As fellow descendants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, others paled in comparison to Zhu Wu Dao, leading to suspicion that he possessed more than just the legacy of the Jinxiang lineage.</p><p>This was understandable. The Jinxiang lineage, occupying Quyang Mountain and integrated into the Tianhao Tower, didn't need to hide.  Their legacy was preserved completely, and they could use Tianhao Tower's influence to gather the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's lost treasures.</p><p>The instant it entered the ground, the stele split into four; the original plummeted straight down, while three illusory images shot towards three different directions, reaching the edge of the platform.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao turned to face the three, saying, "If you wish to enter the Immortal Palace, first assist this old man!"</p><p>The three exchanged glances, expressing no objections.  Following Zhu Wu Dao's instructions, they positioned themselves above the three illusory steles, extending their spiritual senses underground to sense the steles' locations.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao lightly tapped his foot, rising to a height of several meters.  He surveyed the scene for a moment before his fingers moved like spinning wheels, swiftly completing an extremely complex hand seal and directing it towards the underground stele.</p><p>A muffled sound echoed from within the cliff, followed by countless beams of brilliant light erupting from the ground.</p><p>These lights did not shoot into the sky, but instead, guided by something, converged at the four stele locations, transforming into four enormous luminous steles that stood tall on the cliff face!</p><p>The four moved to the top of the luminous steles and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Led by Zhu Wu Dao, they performed the same secret technique.</p><p>Soon, another change occurred. The three outer luminous steles emitted thick beams of light, pouring into the central luminous stele beneath Zhu Wu Dao, causing the outer ones to grow dimmer and dimmer.</p><p>Combining the power of the magical artifact and the four people, the central luminous stele grew increasingly solid, seeming almost real.</p><p>A bright halo spread outward in all directions; the light waves, like water, filled the entire clifftop.</p><p>An astonishing sight appeared.</p><p>Under the illumination of the light, a majestic ancient palace's ethereal image suddenly appeared on the previously empty platform.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was positioned directly in front of the palace's ethereal entrance!</p><p>As the light waves rippled, the palace image also swayed, clearly not a physical structure.</p><p>The three showed surprised expressions, sweeping their spiritual senses across the area, but the feedback remained empty!</p><p>Soon, they discovered that as Zhu Wu Dao worked, the palace image grew clearer, shifting from illusion to reality.</p><p>The strange restriction and the dreamlike scene captivated their attention.</p><p>The bright light and the light waves intertwined.</p><p>The palace image became increasingly clear, its details now visible.</p><p>The palace exterior lacked excessive ornamentation, its doors firmly shut, seemingly without separate halls. The vast space could easily accommodate a teleportation array!</p><p>When the palace image reached a state of half-solid, half-illusory form, Zhu Wu Dao's breathing grew rapid.</p><p>At that moment, the palace suddenly trembled violently.  Everyone's faces changed as they watched a corner of the palace's eaves crumble.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, however, paid no attention, instead accelerating his pace.</p><p>The bright light fluctuated wildly, and the palace image trembled with increasing frequency and amplitude, causing significant damage to the structure.</p><p>The eaves continued to break.</p><p>Cracks were clearly visible on the walls and pillars.</p><p>Finally, a damaged palace appeared before them, thankfully still standing.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao put away the stele and dashed to the palace door, about to push it open, when he felt a searing heat on his right arm.</p><p>Hidden within his sleeve was a strange wooden carving, similar in form to the sculptures worshipped by the Gu God Cult's followers, except for the absence of the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>The carving was completely white.</p><p>But at that moment, a blood-red aura suddenly emanated from the carving.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao paused imperceptibly before pushing open the palace doors!</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>In the heartland of the Southern Barbarian Two Provinces.</p><p>Over the years, the Gu God Cult's influence had spread far and wide.</p><p>At this very moment, all the Gu God Cult's followers received a divine decree, gathering before the divine image to consume the immortal medicine, resulting in widespread scenes of frenzied demonic chaos.</p><p>The immortal medicine sent them into states of ecstatic trance.</p><p>A divine oracle offered hope to the faithful, proclaiming the Celestial Palace would open that day, welcoming devout believers into the Void Immortal Realm for eternal bliss!</p><p>The aftermath of the demonic chaos was even more terrifying.</p><p>Having praised the deity, in their final moments of lucidity, they slaughtered each other before the very idols.</p><p>Corpses littered the ground, rivers of blood flowed!</p><p>Countless villages were utterly annihilated, reduced to hellscapes.</p><p>The idol sat enthroned amidst mountains of corpses and a sea of blood, its rough features stained crimson, appearing eerily grotesque.</p><p>Blood flowed silently towards the idol, along with the souls, all absorbed by the idol.</p><p>Even in the Xianxia world, where mortals are considered as ants, this was an unprecedented blood sacrifice in scale and brutality. News of it would surely shake the entire world!</p><p>Even the night moon seemed shrouded in a bloody veil.</p><p>Under the moonlight, figures in black moved through the silent villages, busily engaged in some task. These individuals appeared to belong to a mysterious organization.</p><p>As time passed,</p><p>Idol after idol drank their fill of blood, their eyes glowing with an unnatural light, watching the world.</p><p>If one were to view the southern frontier from a great height,</p><p>One would see that the locations of the stone idols within the area controlled by the Gu God Cult formed nodes, their energies interlinked, outlining a vast and complex mystical formation!</p><p>At the heart of the formation,</p><p>In a dark cave,</p><p>Two figures in black robes sat facing each other, guarding an idol.</p><p>The blood-red idol illuminated the cave, casting a ghastly light on their grim faces.</p><p>“The formation is complete!”</p><p>The figure on the idol's left whispered, his voice brimming with barely contained excitement.  “The emissary must have entered the Unseen Immortal Gate by now. The Saint King will surely rule the world!”</p><p>His companion was less optimistic, his expression hesitant. “Legend says the Saint King is sealed within the Immortal Palace, far south of the South China Sea.  Can our blood sacrifice here truly break the seal?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>The figure on the left raised his head, glaring fiercely at his companion. “Heaven, Earth, Humanity! The Unseen Immortal Gate once drew the earth's energy into the Immortal Palace to seal the Saint King. We use human blood to break the earth's energy formation, why wouldn't it work? We should thank the Daoists and Buddhists for cleansing the Unseen Immortal Gate, leaving the nodes unguarded, giving us an opportunity! The emissary disguised himself as a descendant of the Unseen Immortal Gate, rallying the masses, deceiving everyone. Even if exposed, we can escape easily and plot again. It's a brilliant move, achieving multiple goals at once!”</p><p>“We both studied the Unseen Immortal Gate's legacy, so it’s not a lie to call ourselves descendants.”</p><p>The companion gave a self-deprecating chuckle.</p><p>“A temporary measure, nothing more!”</p><p>The figure on the left coldly snorted, his expression disdainful. “The Saint King's methods are unfathomable, we both have the merit of saving him. Although not as much as the emissary, even a small reward will transform us, far surpassing any mere magical techniques.”</p><p>As they spoke,</p><p>The idol transformed completely into a bloody human figure, then suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p>The figure on the left felt a shiver run down his spine at the sight of those evil eyes, instinctively taking a few steps back.</p><p>The idol gazed north, establishing contact with some entity.</p><p>…</p><p>Unseen Immortal Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang proceeded cautiously, silently arriving at the foot of the cliff.</p><p>Looking up,</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and the others were on the clifftop, busy with something.</p><p>They had disabled the restrictions on a stone path, likely assuming no uninvited guests would enter the Unseen Immortal Gate anytime soon, so they left no obstacles.</p><p>The stone path was clear.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly ascended, ordering the Sky Eye Butterfly to use its full vision, meticulously searching the path inch by inch. Finally, he detected something unusual at a stone pavilion halfway up the mountain.</p><p>He didn't need to guess; it was certainly Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Lingtian hiding there, waiting for the remnants of the Unseen Immortal Gate to activate the teleportation array.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang found a hidden spot and stopped.</p><p>He raised his left hand, palm up.</p><p>With a thought, complex runes suddenly appeared on his forearm.</p><p>The power of the runes gathered on his hand, gradually forming a blood moon pattern.</p><p>This rune was left by Gui Mu, a bone-finding technique of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to activate it now.</p><p>Finding the remains of the Witch Clan's Nascent Soul cultivator was also one of his goals.</p><p>If the blood moon pattern showed any anomaly, it would mean the Nascent Soul remains were nearby.</p><p>To be honest, Qin Sang didn't believe the bone-finding technique would be very effective after so many years, especially when searching for the corpse of someone he'd never met.</p><p>Was the Witch Clan's bloodline really that special?</p><p>However, after the blood moon appeared, Qin Sang changed his mind.</p><p>Inside the blood moon was a very unique aura.</p><p>“Could it be the aura of that Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>Only by obtaining a precious item closely associated with the Witch Clan Nascent Soul cultivator could one extract this aura.</p><p>The Witch Clan was also skilled in blood refinement techniques, their life-born insect gu also incorporated blood refinement techniques. Did Gui Mu really find a relic refined by a Nascent Soul cultivator's blood?</p><p>She crossed three realms, searching tirelessly for over two hundred years, it seems it wasn't in vain.</p>
