<h1>Chapter 623: A Deal</h1><p>Chapter 623: A Deal</p><p>"符宝 (fú bǎo) are also widely accepted."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, realizing that although his teleportation location was remote, it still had close ties to the Xiaohan region's cultivation world, existing within the same realm.  While talismans were rare, Qin Sang possessed more than one. He had obtained two complete talismans from the remains of Daoist Jiupao alone.  During the years-long battle between the scattered islands and the Tianxing Alliance, the cultivators involved were all elite. Qin Sang had acquired talismans among his spoils of war, but they had been used many times, their power greatly diminished, and he'd used them immediately upon acquisition. The talisman he now held was a flying sword talisman, still possessing about 70-80% of its power—another war trophy. He hadn't used it after the battle on Mount Zhantian, following his departure from the scattered islands.  Now that Qin Sang had formed his Golden Core, he was adept at using magical artifacts and no longer needed talismans, making this a good opportunity for an exchange.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed Cui Xuanzi's lack of confidence and decided to offer the damaged talisman to gauge his reaction.</p><p>"Qin has already formed his Golden Core, so I have little interest in your inner sect's cultivation techniques.  My goal is to find a suitable soul-linking insect, which is why I wish to study your insect-controlling techniques."</p><p>Seeing Cui Xuanzi's gaze fixated on the talisman and his fluctuating expression, Qin Sang proactively softened his terms.</p><p>Cui Xuanzi was indeed tempted.</p><p>While the Five Insects Sect was the dominant force in the Xiong Mountain region, the lack of a Golden Core cultivator made their position precarious. Some of the larger tribes possessed Foundation Establishment cultivators. Although few, a united force could still pose a significant challenge to the Five Insects Sect.  The sect's foundation was not deep; Cui Xuanzi's uncle had once been their only trump card.  During his uncle's time in the sect, the Five Insects Sect had experienced a period of glory. However, his uncle was still in his prime and would certainly not have damaged a talisman, leaving it behind in the sect. His prolonged absence had fueled suspicion and unrest.  Possessing a talisman would significantly solidify the sect's position within the Xiong Mountain region and deter external forces coveting it.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's terms, Cui Xuanzi's eyes lit up. "Is this true, senior?  Simply by sharing your insect-controlling techniques, I can acquire this talisman?"</p><p>The Five Insects Sect's insect-controlling techniques, compared to those of the larger tribes' shamans, were truly unique—the very reason for the sect's enduring dominance.</p><p>If someone else had made such a request, Cui Xuanzi would have refused. However, Qin Sang was not a local cultivator and was a Golden Core cultivator, destined to leave eventually.  Sharing their insect-controlling techniques would have little impact on the overall balance of power in the Xiong Mountain region.</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hands together. "Of course, that's not enough!"</p><p>Under Cui Xuanzi's disappointed gaze, Qin Sang calmly continued, "Qin also requires your assistance in several matters."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi frowned but couldn't resist the allure of the talisman. "Please, senior, state your requests."</p><p>"Fear not, I merely require your help in some minor tasks—gathering information. I have only recently formed my Golden Core and need to consolidate my cultivation, leaving me without the time to spare. If you perform well, I will not only give you this talisman but also other pills and artifacts; I have plenty. Afterwards, you will remain the ruler of this land, and I will return to my homeland, never to bother you again."</p><p>Seeing Cui Xuanzi's growing interest, Qin Sang tossed the talisman to him, turning to gaze into the depths of the Western Frontier.  "Being a newcomer here, I lack familiarity with the Western Frontier. I require a detailed map, including the more barbaric regions."</p><p>Cui Xuanzi breathed a sigh of relief.  "This is not difficult. My sect possesses an ancestral map, very detailed.  My uncle further supplemented it during his explorations."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him and pointed westward.</p><p>"Don't rush to answer. The map I require is not limited to the Xiong Mountain region. I believe you have the means to contact other regional forces.  The larger the scope of the map, the better—ideally encompassing the barbaric lands.</p><p>"The maps should not only mark the various forces but also the habitats of spirit insects, no matter how dangerous.</p><p>"Furthermore, collect information about all nearby regions, including the remote barbaric areas of the Western Frontier, detailing any rumored ancient cultivator's estates or secluded realms."</p><p>Qin Sang paused, adding, "Even terrifying places feared by cultivators, such as the Demon Realm or the cursed lands, should be marked. If you require resources during this process, simply ask."</p><p>“Hidden realm? Ancient tomb?”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi paused, surprised.</p><p>Qin Sang’s presence in Western Xinjiang to search for a suitable life-bound insect was perfectly normal; the region was known for rare and powerful insects.  These creatures possessed unique abilities, were elusive and powerful, or inhabited dangerous areas.</p><p>Many cultivators from outside regions came to Western Xinjiang to hunt these insects, including some at the Golden Core stage; most returned empty-handed.  Even with Qin Sang’s skill, success wasn't guaranteed.</p><p>But the search for a hidden realm or an ancient cultivator's tomb?  Was she, relying on her superior strength, planning to sweep through Western Xinjiang, collecting whatever she could find?</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked, “Near your Xiongshan region, are there any hidden realms sealed by powerful formations and inaccessible? If you help me locate one, I'll gladly share any treasures I find.”</p><p>Cui Xuanzi shook his head.  “With all due respect, senior, I've trained at the Five Insects Sect since childhood, and I've never heard of such places nearby.”</p><p>Seeing Cui Xuanzi’s honest expression, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>For Qin Sang, after reaching the Golden Core stage, the most crucial task was finding an ancient teleportation array to return home and continue her cultivation.  She now possessed the Three Lights Jade Liquid and had found an alchemist; the Du E Pill was within reach, but separated from her by a vast distance was the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid.  Such rare items were incredibly difficult to obtain.</p><p>Remembering the hardships of reaching the Golden Core stage, Qin Sang knew that the Nascent Soul stage would be even more challenging.  She felt uncertain about her chances. Before attempting the Nascent Soul stage, she had to return to Xiaohan Region and refine the Du E Pill.</p><p>Qin Sang had carefully observed that the waters of Western Xinjiang were complex and interconnected. The small river where she'd floated was just a part of a larger network, its source untraceable.</p><p>To make matters worse, Qin Sang didn't know how long she was unconscious after arriving, so she couldn't estimate her location.  Searching for an ancient teleportation array in such a vast area was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack; she didn't even know if the array was above or below ground.</p><p>She was also completely baffled as to why she woke up floating on the river.</p><p>Qin Sang reasoned that if one end of the teleportation array was in Ziwei Palace, the other end was likely located within a hidden realm.  Instead of aimlessly searching, exploring hidden realms to find the ancient teleportation array would be more efficient.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thanks to Qianyu for the generous contribution!
