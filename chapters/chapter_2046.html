<h1>Chapter 2037: Qiongze Mountain</h1><p>“Senior, you’re back!”</p><p>Gu Ya’s heart finally settled when she saw Qin Sang.</p><p>She had been escorted from the Beast Taming Pavilion to Yin City, and had been anxious ever since.  Every day, more cultivators from near the Jade Gate Pass had been relocating.  The situation hadn’t improved; instead, yesterday saw a massive surge in arrivals, including many established families who had been rooted in the Jade Gate Pass for years.  They had all relocated.</p><p>News quickly spread: two peerless experts had engaged in a devastating battle outside the Jade Gate Pass, a battle so earth-shattering it nearly destroyed the pass. Luckily, a mysterious figure intervened and brokered a ceasefire.</p><p>Those who had witnessed the battle described the scene in terrified whispers – torrential blood rain, earth-shattering power – even sheltered within the protective city array, they felt as though they were adrift, constantly threatened by the rain of blood.</p><p>After the battle, the Jade Gate Pass was nearly deserted, its return to its former state a distant prospect. And the chaos was only beginning. Powerful figures continued to appear outside the Jade Gate Pass, raising the fear that the city could be destroyed in another battle at any time.</p><p>Gu Ya had rented a secluded courtyard as a temporary residence. However, Yin City was overcrowded, property prices were soaring, and even the rent was high.</p><p>“Did you accomplish the task?” Qin Sang asked upon entering the courtyard.</p><p>He had previously instructed Gu Ya to keep an eye out for various treasures appearing in Yin City.</p><p>The turmoil at the Jade Gate Pass had created both chaos and opportunity.  Jade Gate Pass properties were worthless; cultivators abandoned their homes and livelihoods, and finding a foothold elsewhere wouldn't be easy, so many were forced to sell their treasured possessions.</p><p>As Qin Sang predicted, auctions were held daily in Yin City, and he wasn't the only one looking to profit from the chaos.</p><p>Gu Ya nodded, and a dozen or so balls of spiritual light flew out from her waist.</p><p>“As per your instructions, Senior, I have acquired some spirit materials. In addition, I have also learned something about the Jin Yue Jade.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang was interested.  Jin Yue Jade, like the Bi Hen Essence and Qianyu Silk, was essential for building the thunder altar.</p><p>“Who possesses the Jin Yue Jade, and how much is there?”</p><p>Gu Ya replied, “It’s the Huang family who relocated from the Jade Gate Pass; it’s unclear how much they have. My cultivation limits my ability to receive information immediately, but I heard that several seniors have approached them, all without success. I was planning to visit them tonight…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and decided to visit the Huang family directly.</p><p>He wouldn't stay in Yin City long. He took Gu Ya with him and prepared to go to the Xin family to receive the training grounds of the Pei and Zhong Liang, and then find a buyer.  Refining training grounds were highly valuable; many people would be interested.</p><p>The Xin family was located in the north of Duizhou, in an area human cultivators referred to as the Dark Zone. While not as chaotic and bloody as the legends depicted, it was far from peaceful.  They needed to leave as soon as possible to avoid unforeseen problems.</p><p>He was determined to acquire the Jin Yue Jade.  After careful investigation, he learned that the Huang family wanted to exchange the Jin Yue Jade for a specific type of spirit pill.</p><p>Qin Sang did not possess any spirit pills, but he had some rare spirit herbs obtained from the Chen family's secret vault.  Taking a chance, he offered two of these herbs and successfully made the exchange.</p><p>Human cultivators mostly focused on their cultivation, and generally believed that spirit herbs of the same rank were more valuable than other spiritual objects. This showed the Huang family also knew that it was difficult to directly exchange the Jin Yue Jade for spirit pills, and had to find a roundabout way.</p><p>Leaving Yin City, Qin Sang flew on his sword, his sword light enveloping Gu Ya as they soared north.</p><p>“Senior, where are we going now?”</p><p>Gu Ya's heart was already back in Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>To get to the Storm Realm, they would have to travel through Kanzhou, then east towards the East Sea, passing through the territories of various barbarian tribes. The journey would be fraught with uncertainty, something she couldn't accomplish alone.</p><p>“First, to Qiongze Mountain, and then to Xuwei City,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Xuwei City was the capital of Kanzhou Prefecture, a legendary city said to be built on the shell of an ancient giant tortoise.</p><p>Gu Ya was overjoyed, but she also realized something and her expression fell. “From now on, will we never be able to enter Ziwei Palace again?”</p><p>Since entering her sect, she had grown up hearing legends of Ziwei Palace. As a youth, she had yearned to go there. By the time she had the ability to explore it on her own, it had already ascended, a great regret of her life.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “With so many powerful cultivators gathering at the Jade Gate Pass, it was undoubtedly to divide up Ziwei Palace. Once it has a new master, there might be no more Ziwei Palace in the world.”</p><p>Gu Ya felt a pang of sadness.  She had never had the chance to witness the true splendor of a celestial palace. Even though she knew Ziwei Palace was not part of the Storm Realm, she found it hard to let go of her feelings. She sighed, “I wonder if there were any seniors who ascended from the Storm Realm among them?”</p><p>Qin Sang had considered this question himself.</p><p>For countless years, the Storm World has produced countless geniuses, and a significant number must have successfully ascended to the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>Not mentioning the Yao and Wu tribes, just considering the human race of Central State, both Buddhist and Daoist sects have had Nascent Soul cultivators generation after generation.  The former hegemon of Central State, the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, with its five elemental veins, undoubtedly had more than one Nascent Soul cultivator in each generation.  Going further back, there's the mysterious Wuwang Hall.</p><p>These forces had a clear line of succession, and it's highly probable they established sects and continued their legacies in the Greater Thousand World.  However, during his time in Fengju Yumen, Qin Sang didn't meet a single one.</p><p>For him, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.</p><p>After learning of Liuli's whereabouts and the news of the Storm World's ascension, Qin Sang's interest in contacting lower realm ascendants gradually waned.  He planned to establish a Thunder Altar in the Storm World as his cultivation ground to comprehend the Great Slaughter Dao.</p><p>Since it was his own cultivation ground, he wouldn't allow others to spy on it.</p><p>If the ascended cultivators only relocated their sect descendants, it would be acceptable.  But he feared they might try to control the Storm World.</p><p>This was quite possible.  The great upheaval caused by the Ziwei Palace in the Greater Thousand World made it clear to everyone that the Storm World was extraordinary and would definitely be seized and studied.</p><p>Then, if the other party used force, Qin Sang would either have to leave or become their vassal, neither of which he wanted.</p><p>Regarding Su Nu, Qin Sang considered it for a long time and decided to tell her the truth.</p><p>The Storm World had fallen into the territory of the Yi people, surrounded on all sides by foreign tribes and without any support. If he went back alone, he would likely be overwhelmed.  The Storm World might already be in a precarious situation, on the verge of war, and he needed to find help.</p><p>After much deliberation, he couldn't think of anyone better than Su Nu. Of course, Su Nu might not be willing to fight for the Storm World, so he had to ask her.</p><p>Su Nu had been waiting at their agreed-upon location. When Qin Sang and Gu Ya arrived, her injuries had healed by eighty percent.</p><p>Qin Sang recounted his experiences in Fengju Yumen. Su Nu showed no surprise, having likely heard some rumors.</p><p>"It's a pity about the treasures in the Ziwei Palace; they're completely beyond our reach," Su Nu sighed, "What are your plans, Qin Xiong?"</p><p>"Do you remember the Xin family?"</p><p>Qin Sang briefly described what happened. "The Xin family sought refuge, and I placed them under your command. There are also two empty caves of Nascent Soul cultivators there; you can choose one as your cultivation ground."</p><p>Su Nu sensed something more. "Qin Xiong, are you going somewhere else?"</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I'm going to Kan Prefecture, entering the East Sea, to do something. I'm afraid the journey will be too arduous for you."</p><p>Su Nu said seriously, "There are great teleportation arrays between the Eight Great Heavenly Prefectures. What hardship is there? Since I left my master, I'm alone, like a feather in the wind, going wherever fate takes me. If what you're doing is dangerous, I can help.  Give me a chance to repay you."</p><p>After a pause, Su Nu suddenly realized something and quickly explained, "If this concerns your secrets, and I shouldn't know, I'll stay with the Xin family and wait for your return!"</p><p>"If you have nothing else to do, come with me to Kan Prefecture," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Reunited with Su Nu, the three continued north.  Once they left De Prefecture, Fengju Yumen was behind them.</p><p>...</p><p>The Dark Zone, De Prefecture cultivators spoke of it with fear.</p><p>In fact, the Dark Zone was a gathering place for cultivators and forces unwilling to submit to Great Zhou. It wasn't truly lawless. At least in the southern part, close to Great Zhou, most were human cultivators, with their own order.</p><p>The Xin family's Qiongzhe Mountain was located in this area.</p><p>Arriving at Qiongzhe Mountain, Qin Sang stopped high in the air, overlooking the area below.  Qiongzhe Mountain was surrounded by more than ten rivers, shimmering with reflections, a rich water system.</p><p>He remembered the Xin Clan Young Master mentioning most of the rivers flowed into a lake called Qiong Lake.</p><p>Outsiders called the cultivators here the Qiong Lake cultivators.</p><p>There was no single dominant force near Qiong Lake.  Including the Pei Attendant, Zhong Liang the Reclusive Cultivator, and the former Xin family, various factions circled Qiong Lake, balancing each other, rising and falling.</p><p>Qin Sang crushed a jade talisman, observing carefully. Qiongzhe Mountain was shrouded in thick fog, its protective formation activated. Cultivators within, clad in armor, moved hurriedly, the atmosphere extremely tense.</p><p>In the mountain…</p><p>The Xin family cultivators hadn't returned yet; only the Young Master and a few others had secretly slipped back.</p><p>"Young Master, the Bi Shui Village scouts have been frequently patrolling outside the mountain these days. Something's not right. When will Elder Qin arrive?" The Xin family's Grand Elder worried.</p><p>Bi Shui Village was a powerful sect under Zhong Liang the Reclusive Cultivator's command.  Relying on Zhong Liang's powerful cultivation, they occupied one of the most spiritually rich locations on the banks of the Qiong Lake.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng, having no interest in building a power base, only took on a few disciples, but each possessed extraordinary talent and profound cultivation.</p><p>To avoid alerting the enemy, they remained silent about the deaths of Pei Gongfeng and Zhong Liang Sanren after returning from Fengju Jade Gate, planning to wait for Qin Sang's arrival to completely eliminate them.</p><p>Master Xin looked at the steward beside him, "Butler Luo, have you found out if Zhong Liang Sanren left the Blood Spirit Lamp in Bi Shui Village?"</p><p>The Blood Spirit Lamp is a treasure in Bi Shui Village, similar to a soul lamp, indicating the safety of the sect members outside. However, Zhong Liang Sanren might not have left his soul lamp behind.</p><p>Their current goal is to determine if Bi Shui Village knew about Zhong Liang Sanren's death. If Bi Shui Village, knowing of Zhong Liang Sanren's death, still dares to attack, it suggests they might have found a new patron, adding another variable.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng's disciples, however, showed no unusual activity, seemingly unaware of their master's demise.</p><p>Butler Luo shook his head. "Those who know of the Blood Spirit Lamp will certainly keep it secret; it's impossible to find out. I'll try to keep an eye on several key figures in Bi Shui Village."</p><p>Master Xin nodded, saying solemnly, "Our Xin family has no choice but to rely on Elder Qin, but we have no prior relationship with Elder Qin. Don't even think about asking Elder Qin to solve all our problems. Don't bother Elder Qin with such trivial matters of intelligence gathering…"</p><p>Just then, Master Xin seemed to sense something, tilting his head to gaze for a moment before smiling, "Elder Qin is here!"</p><p>Everyone rejoiced at the news and hurried out to greet him.</p><p>Back in the main hall, the Xin family members surrounded Qin Sang as he took the main seat.  Learning that Su Nu was also a Transcending Void cultivator, their last bit of anxiety vanished. With two Transcending Void cultivators against Bi Shui Village, failure was impossible.</p><p>Xin Sheng secretly observed Su Nu after meeting her.</p><p>During the years spent sleeping beside Qin Sang, she wasn't completely unaware of the outside world; on the contrary, her spiritual perception was quite sharp.  Seeing Su Nu now, she still felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>Only after Qin Sang inquired did Xin Sheng collect her thoughts, quickly explaining the situation in Qiong Lake. Bi Shui Village's allies were bound by mutual interests; Zhong Liang Sanren was their greatest support.  Without him, all that remained was to break through Bi Shui Village's protective formation; the rest would be insignificant.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu could jointly launch a powerful attack, making it difficult for Bi Shui Village to resist. But such an action would be too noisy, and they wanted an intact Daoist temple, not a ruined one.</p><p>"You should try to lure out a core disciple of Bi Shui Village; I'll use a secret technique to control them, and we'll attack from within and without to break the formation!" Su Nu said.</p><p>Since Su Nu was willing to act, Qin Sang needn't worry. He turned to Xin Sheng, "I won't stay here long. If the Xin family is in trouble, I may not be able to help in time. Consider relocating the Xin family to Duizhou. You can reclaim your ancestral home after you break through to Transcending Void."</p><p>Although Xin Sheng had gained opportunities in the tomb, achieving Transcending Void cultivation wasn't something that could be accomplished overnight.  With Mingling, Pei Gongfeng, and Zhong Liang Sanren all dead, the Xin family lost their Transcending Void strength, making it difficult for them to remain in the Dark Zone.</p><p>Xin Sheng was startled, not expecting that even the Bi Shui Village Daoist temple wouldn't hold Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had better options, and she was happy for him, yet worried about the difficulty of seeing him again. But since she had chosen not to reveal her identity, she had to silently bear the pain of longing.</p><p>At least, maintaining this relationship with the Xin family would allow her to reveal herself at any time.</p><p>Xin Sheng immediately bowed, "We will follow Elder Qin's instructions."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. As a guest elder of the Five Elements Alliance, requesting the alliance to arrange a place for the Xin family was not difficult.</p><p>At this moment, Su Nu and Butler Luo, after discussing, decided to visit Bi Shui Village personally.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed behind in Qiongze Mountain with Xin Sheng, asking, "Do you know if there are any trade routes between the Dark Zone and the Witch Clan?"</p><p>Xin Sheng looked up slightly, her apricot eyes fixed on Qin Sang, hiding a trace of tenderness before lowering her head and saying, "Rumor has it that after the destruction of the Fengju Jade Gate, there were several more wars between the two clans, and the formation of the Dark Zone is related to this.  The Witch Clan has always been wary of humans and has stationed troops north of the Fengju Jade Gate. Even if you could safely cross the Dark Zone, you would be stopped by the Witch Clan army. If Elder Qin wishes to go to the Witch Clan, Li Prefecture is safer. It is said that in the border region between Li Prefecture, the Western Buddhist Lands, and the Witch Clan, there is some trade and the conflict has eased.  But the two clans have always been at odds, even hostile to each other, so one shouldn't go too deep."</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied this, dismissing Xin Sheng with a wave of his hand, and fell into deep thought.</p><p>As Xin Sheng said, the two clans were hostile, and passage was inconvenient. He could fool ordinary people with his cultivation of the Life-Bound Insect Gu technique, but in front of powerful Witch Clan members, his true identity might be exposed.</p><p>To find Gui Mu and Liu Ying, he should probably wait until the Storm Realm had stabilized, then take a few Witch Clan cultivators from the Storm Realm with him to conceal his purpose.</p>
