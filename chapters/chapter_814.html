<h1>Chapter 806:  The Heavenly Demon Transformation</h1><p>Chapter 806:  The Heavenly Demon Transformation</p><p>Returning to Tianxing Island, Qin Sang visited the Xiang'an Auction House but didn't find Master Yi.</p><p>A servant explained that Master Yi, along with other alchemists and weapon refiners from the auction house, had been urgently summoned to the Demon Sea via a teleportation array some time ago.</p><p>A large number of experts from the three major trading alliances also went.</p><p>The details were confidential, and the servant couldn't elaborate.</p><p>Qin Sang, having been in seclusion cultivating, hadn't noticed the significant movement by the trading alliances.  His contact with the Qiongyu Trading House had been severed, leaving him without channels to gather information.</p><p>Having been with the Qiongyu Trading House for many years, he sensed the considerable importance the three major alliances placed on the Demon Sea.</p><p>It made sense: with the righteous and demonic cultivators acting like two imposing mountains in the Canglang Sea, and the Witch Clan lurking, the situation was incredibly complex. For the three major alliances to make headway under the watchful eyes of both sides, the Demon Sea presented a unique opportunity.</p><p>Such a large deployment suggested something significant had happened in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't in a rush. He took his leave, returned to his cave abode, and resumed his cultivation.</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Before he knew it, a year had passed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained on Tianxing Island, rarely leaving the city.</p><p>He spent his days cultivating the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*, his nights drawing the energy of the celestial constellations to temper his body. Every few days, he'd venture out to interact with other cultivators and gather information on Spirit Turtle Island.</p><p>Six months later, late one night, Qin Sang awoke from his meditation in the courtyard.</p><p>“Only a little over a year, and I’ve reached the peak of the first level! This rapid progress is largely due to my previous foundation. As my cultivation deepens, and the foundation becomes less of a limiting factor, my progress will naturally slow. But with the Star Spirit Net and the Jade Buddha, it won't be too slow.”</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>Even at just the first level, the changes were astonishing. He felt an abundance of power, capable of fighting effectively even without using his true energy. This feeling of physical strength was radically different from his time as a spell cultivator.  Even if his magical treasures were destroyed and his true energy limited, a top-tier body cultivator would still possess formidable strength.</p><p>“But body cultivation is truly difficult. The pain I endure during cultivation is significantly worse than a year ago, while the feeling of ease is diminishing.  By the second and third levels, when the star energy tempers my body, it will probably cause bone-deep agony. This technique is incredibly powerful. Even the naturally robust bodies of the demon race can only endure so much. For humans, it's far more challenging.  Without exceptional willpower, it's hard to persevere. Perhaps I could use some medicinal herbs that enhance the body later…”</p><p>Qin Sang, confident in his willpower, showed no fear.</p><p>Furthermore, the changes in the Ebony Sword over the past year had taught him that regardless of the difficulties, he had to continue on this path.</p><p>He hadn't interrupted his cultivation of the *Yuanshen Sword Nurturing Chapter*, and his progress was rapid, thanks to the life-or-death battles in the Seven Kills Hall. But as his cultivation advanced, the Ebony Sword began showing signs of being unable to withstand the killing talismans.</p><p>He had initially expected the Ebony Sword to hold out until the sixth killing talisman was inscribed.  Unfortunately, the technique wasn't the original version, putting too much strain on the sword.</p><p>Once the Ebony Sword collapsed, even if Qin Sang understood the essence of the sixth killing talisman, he wouldn't be able to inscribe it, and his cultivation would stagnate.</p><p>And that day wasn't far off.</p><p>Having stayed on Tianxing Island for so long, Qin Sang had given up hope of finding the Ten Divine Trees.  There weren't even similar legends in the Canglang Sea; it seemed the Ten Divine Trees had never appeared there, unlike the small Xiaohan Domain.</p><p>Cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique, practicing both spell cultivation and body cultivation, to forcibly raise his strength to the late peak stage, was the only path he could see.</p><p>At the very least, before the next opening of the Seven Kills Hall, Qin Sang had to make *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* his primary cultivation method.</p><p>Qin Sang collected his thoughts, looked up at the sky, “It’s still early. I’ll accumulate star energy now and attempt the star energy body infusion to break through to the second level tonight!”</p><p>Bao Gu Mountain had abundant spiritual energy, making it the ideal place to break through.</p><p>The Star Spirit Net rippled slightly, enveloping the space around Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his technique, drawing the energy of the celestial constellations into his body, but instead of tempering his body, he forced it outward, containing it within the Star Spirit Net for gradual accumulation.</p><p>He spent the entire night preparing for the star energy body infusion.</p><p>Dawn approached.</p><p>The small courtyard of the cave abode glowed brightly. Qin Sang's body was surrounded by brilliant starlight, like a beacon illuminating the entire courtyard.  If it weren't for the protective barriers, other cultivators would undoubtedly have been startled by the phenomenon.</p><p>“It’s time!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened slightly, silently chanting incantations, his fingers lightly touching the Star Spirit Net.</p><p>A vortex appeared in the swirling celestial energy, abruptly rushing into Qin Sang's body with immense force.  Simultaneously, the spiritual energy in the courtyard was almost completely drained.</p><p>Qin Sang groaned, feeling as if struck by a heavy hammer, his face turning pale.  The stellar energy and spiritual energy rampaged within him, causing far greater pain than during previous cultivation.  He remained rigidly seated, enduring the agony, suppressing all distractions, and focusing on his cultivation technique to guide these forces and find a breakthrough.</p><p>Dawn broke, painting the east a fiery red.  Qin Sang remained seated until the sun rose.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang let out a long roar, rising abruptly.  His bones cracked, and he shed a layer of skin, revealing impurities expelled from his body.  His skin was now translucent and vibrant, and a light clench of his fist demonstrated newfound strength.</p><p>“Success!  The second level of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* is achieved! My physical body alone can now contend with Foundation Establishment cultivators without falling behind!”</p><p>After assessing his newfound strength, Qin Sang returned to his original position, taking out a bone flute and studying the cultivation method for the Tian Yao Transformation. Mastering this transformation would further enhance his combat abilities, but the text only offered a brief description, implying a close connection between the transformation and visualizing the celestial beast.</p><p>Uncertain, Qin Sang ignored this and proceeded with cultivation.  The process was surprisingly smooth.  Soon, Qin Sang opened his eyes and began behaving oddly, examining his body and raising his arms for inspection.  During cultivation, he felt a unique and potent power emerge within him, leading him to understand that the Tian Yao Transformation could greatly enhance his body or specific parts.</p><p>“Should I focus on my arms, or refine my entire body… could I even grow wings?”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts turned to the man with the hooked nose. This man, with wings on his back, possessed a speed that surpassed even Qin Sang's—the fastest Golden Core cultivator he had ever seen. The Azure-phoenix was a divine bird.  If he could achieve the same, combining it with talismans, sword energy, and thunderous sound, he might even surpass Golden Core cultivators, gaining escape techniques rivaling those of Nascent Soul masters. This was the ultimate life-saving skill. Even if he provoked a Nascent Soul enemy, he would not be completely helpless. Improving his physical defense or strengthening his hands were far less important.</p>
