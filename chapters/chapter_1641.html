<h1>Chapter 1632: Sword, Drum, and Painting</h1><p>Chapter 1632: Sword, Drum, and Painting</p><p>Numerous scriptures were stored in the Hall of  Láng, but only the latter part of the *Yuánshén Yǎngjiàn Zhāng* (Soul-Nurturing Sword Scripture) proved truly useful to Qin Sang.  The other texts didn't seem to have any immediate application.  This was to be expected; the easily understandable parts had already been distributed among the Five Sects.</p><p>The *Yīnyáng Tiāndòu Mìshù* (Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique) wasn't among them, but Qin Sang still dedicated considerable mental energy to memorizing every text in the hall, regardless of their apparent value.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself increasingly puzzled by the relationship between Xiāoxiāngzi and the Wúxiàng Sect.  Based on various clues, Qin Sang suspected Xiāoxiāngzi might have originally belonged to the Wúxiàng Sect, and was forced to flee to the north, becoming disillusioned and reluctant to mention his former sect.</p><p>However, the latter part of the *Yuánshén Yǎngjiàn Zhāng* was left in the Hall of Láng for others to study. If the fragments of the Slaughter Sword had been discovered alongside the cultivation technique, they should have also been placed in the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Xiāoxiāngzi placed such great importance on the Slaughter Sword fragments, yet his writings made no mention of the cultivation technique, as if he were unaware of their connection.  Unless he hadn't yet qualified to ascend to the Jade Pavilion, and obtained the fragments outside the Wúxiàng Sect after its destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  The truth of that time had long been lost to the ages; only Xiāoxiāngzi knew his own story.</p><p>Dismissing these inconsequential matters, Qin Sang withdrew his attention from the orb of light and remained seated for a while longer, organizing his recent gains. The cultivation technique was now in his possession; there was no need to rush.</p><p>Qin Sang rose from his cushion and descended to the lower level, intending to search the Cloud Pool for any other treasures that might pique his interest. He would then decide whether to rejoin his physical body in the Ice Palace or proceed independently to the Fire Palace.</p><p>Returning to the corridor, Qin Sang looked around. The remnants of the mansion were filled with illusions. His primary concern was the cliff face, where he wanted to see if any further changes would occur.  The strange phenomena at the cliff had subsided; there was no sign of any ongoing battle.</p><p>"The Wúxiàng Sect and the Eight Scenic Views clashed; I wonder who prevailed? Will they continue their fight to the death now that the Immortal Palace has ascended? My understanding of the Wúxiàng Sect is still too limited. I should consider making contact with one side or the other..."  Qin Sang mused, uncertain about the direction the situation would take.</p><p>Fortunately, he had obtained the cultivation technique, which would give him more leeway in his actions. The reappearance of the Wúxiàng Sect – a momentous event unseen for millennia – and the countless undiscovered treasures within the mansion meant he couldn't bring himself to leave just yet.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang focused on the Cloud Pool, searching for targets.  The treasures within the jade cages were invisible. The broken swords and blades outside, however, were clearly visible.  Though now inert and powerless, in their prime they were at least pseudo-spiritual treasures; artifacts wouldn't have been worthy of inclusion in the Wúxiàng Sect's Cloud Pool.</p><p>Since he also cultivated the Dao of Refinement, gaining insight from these ruined treasures would be incredibly beneficial, aiding in the development of Yúnyóuzi's spiritual awareness.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang set his sights on a broken sword.  Unlike the Slaughter Sword, it had a hilt but no point.  The blade was transparent, shimmering faintly in the reflection of the Cloud Pool, like a ghostly sword shadow. Without hesitation, Qin Sang named it the Chéngyǐng Sword!</p><p>The Chéngyǐng Sword was broken in half, with a clean fracture, as if severed by a far sharper weapon.</p><p>"It's this one!"</p><p>Qin Sang had decided on the Chéngyǐng Sword and, using the same method as before, summoned four fire spirits.  As the Chéngyǐng Sword couldn't respond, this treasure retrieval proved significantly more challenging than before. Qin Sang failed three times before managing to retrieve the sword before it vanished.</p><p>"One person is still too much of a stretch…" Qin Sang thought, grasping the Chéngyǐng Sword.  To his surprise, both his true energy and spiritual sense passed straight through it as if it didn't exist.  Attempting to control it as a spirit sword was a fool's errand.</p><p>"The treasures in the Cloud Pool are truly peculiar. If they were so easy to understand, they wouldn't have been left for me…"</p><p>His spirits remained high.  After playing with it for a bit, he put the Chéngyǐng Sword into his Qianjūn Ring and continued his treasure hunting.</p><p>He rested for a while and then tried again, intermittently.  He successfully fished out a small, hole-ridden drum, and a tattered scroll.  The drum was intact, save for a hole in the center of the drumhead.  Qin Sang initially thought it might be repairable, but he quickly found that wasn't the case.  The scroll depicted a boundless expanse of water, constantly flowing, its source and destination unknown, the sound of rushing water audible up close.</p><p>These three were the most prominent of the Cloud Pool's ruined treasures.  Without exception, regardless of his methods, the relics remained unresponsive.</p><p>Having obtained these three ruined treasures, Qin Sang turned his attention to the jade cages, hoping to retrieve a few more and test his luck.  At that moment, a sudden phenomenon in the distance caught his attention! Even while retrieving treasures, Qin Sang remained vigilant.</p><p>The remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and the Daoist cultivators are missing, both forces far surpassing him in strength.  Caution is paramount.  Firstly, to prevent anyone from approaching the location unnoticed. Secondly, to monitor the Ice Palace for any sign of his avatar encountering strong enemies.</p><p>The anomaly originated from the Ice Palace!</p><p>Qin Sang looked into the distance, seeing ethereal blue light shimmering between the mountains, faintly reflecting the shadows of several ice palaces beneath it, interwoven with the glow of restrictions. The full view of Bingyi Palace, however, remained obscured.</p><p>After his avatar entered, the palace's restrictions and the blue light remained stable thanks to the ice disc.</p><p>Suddenly, several white lights erupted from within the Ice Palace, causing the restrictive glow to flicker wildly.</p><p>The white lights shot out, but not skyward.</p><p>Moreover, the disturbance originated from the central region of the Ice Palace, a relatively small area compared to the whole.  Most observers would likely miss it, but Qin Sang, positioned high above on the mountain with his heightened vision, saw everything clearly.</p><p>“My avatar has been in there for some time now. If all went well, it should have reached the core hall, perhaps even left by now… Why is this anomaly in the central area?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>He and his avatar had agreed upon a signal in case of trouble. There was no signal, yet the timing of this anomaly was highly unusual.</p><p>Nor was there anything of vital importance to him within the Cloud Pool.</p><p>Glancing at the anomaly, Qin Sang decisively put away the demonic fire, left the mountain, and swiftly moved towards the Ice Palace.</p><p>…</p><p>Bingyi Palace.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man and the Crying Spirit Palace Master arrived together at the palace entrance.</p><p>“Back then, even a minor branch of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect could rival the top sects of today.  And now, this…”</p><p>Looking at the ruined Bingyi Palace, the Crying Spirit Palace Master sighed, his feelings intensified by the Strange-Faced Man's mention of Huoxi Island's even worse condition.</p><p>“Can you still sense the wood spirit aura?” he asked, turning to the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man remained silent, closing his eyes to sense for a while before saying, "The sacred wood remains, but its exact location is obscured. Possibly due to the remnants of the protective array. I can only pinpoint a general direction – it should be deep within Bingyi Palace.”</p><p>“Such a treasure will undoubtedly be heavily guarded,” the Crying Spirit Palace Master summoned his protective treasure, urging, “Even though only fragments of the array remain, breaking through won't be easy. Let's proceed.”</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man readily agreed and followed.</p><p>Entering Bingyi Palace, they first saw the dried-up lake. Then they discovered three paths in the woods.</p><p>Their goal was clear; they headed straight for the middle path.</p><p>Just as the Crying Spirit Palace Master was about to enter the forest, he was stopped by the Strange-Faced Man.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man stood before the forest, arms outstretched.  The surrounding plants suddenly grew wildly.  With a flick of his fingers, points of green light separated and drifted into the forest.</p><p>A gentle breeze rustled through the trees.</p><p>The treetops swayed, a green wave flowing forward.</p><p>But to the Crying Spirit Palace Master, these plants felt utterly different than before; they seemed entirely under the Strange-Faced Man's control, an extension of himself.</p><p>Then, the Strange-Faced Man gestured for the Crying Spirit Palace Master to follow, entering the forest.  With each step he took, the green wave advanced.</p><p>The branches of ancient trees bent down, weaving a path of branches for them through the forest, returning to their original positions once they had passed.</p><p>Following behind, halfway through the forest, the Crying Spirit Palace Master asked, “Anything?”</p><p>The plants around them served as the Strange-Faced Man’s eyes. If anyone had left a mark in the forest, he would have sensed it.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man shook his head.</p><p>“Let’s wait and see. We might be the first,” the Crying Spirit Palace Master said lightly, his eyes constantly scanning the surroundings with keen interest.</p><p>The Water Phase Hall branch was not aligned with his path.</p><p>However, with the five branches of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect once renowned, if the Wood Phase Hall possessed such a high-level secret technique, the Water Phase Hall surely held its own hidden secrets! This was a perfect opportunity to investigate.</p><p>They successfully traversed the forest.</p><p>They reached a garden and a Kirin screen.</p><p>The Kirin screen showed no signs of activation until they were very close, leaving them vulnerable, as Qin Sang's avatar had been.</p><p>As they approached, about to bypass it…</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The screen glowed intensely, the ice Kirin instantly detaching from the screen and lunging at them.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man’s face changed slightly, shouting, “Careful!”</p><p>The Crying Spirit Palace Master reacted instantly, at the same time as the warning, flicking his sleeve, revealing a silver rope which shot out.</p><p>A silver thread, thin as air, suddenly stretched taut in mid-air, shooting towards the first ice qilin.  The angle was incredibly precise; in a flash, it wrapped around the creature's neck.</p><p>Simultaneously, the grotesque-faced man spread his fingers wide.  A green light appeared in the void, and dozens of vines sprang into existence.  These vines writhed like snakes, wildly thrashing.</p><p>An ice qilin lunged from above.  The vines, sensing their enemy, swarmed the qilin, binding it tightly.</p><p>There were eight ice qilin in total, but seeing two so easily subdued, both the grotesque-faced man and the Crying Spirit Cave Master relaxed.</p><p>Without needing to communicate, they tacitly chose three more each.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master uttered a single word, "Still," and without needing his red flower, flicked his fingers. Three beams of light shot towards three ice qilin.</p><p>In mid-air, the light transformed into rings, perfectly encircling the heads of the qilin, like magical collars.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man seemed more at ease.  The vines, after binding the first qilin, continued to grow, quickly forming a large net that enveloped the remaining three.</p><p>In an instant, all the ice qilin were imprisoned!</p><p>"The barrier ahead still remains. We must be cautious..."</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master, not concerning himself with the ice qilin, spoke while looking deeper into the garden.</p><p>Unexpectedly, mid-sentence, he stopped abruptly, gazing in surprise at the silver thread. The ice qilin bound by it had vanished!</p><p>Immediately, they discovered that all the ice qilin they'd controlled were becoming translucent, disappearing from their restraints.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The grotesque-faced man, sensing danger, dashed forward.</p><p>The next moment, the scene around them shifted dramatically.</p><p>A howling wind swept through.  The garden was before them, yet rapidly receding, only the qilin shadow wall remaining steadfast in front. The damaged wall stood like a high barrier, blocking their path.</p><p>This was no illusion.  They felt an uncanny force isolating them from reality.</p><p>Experienced as they were, they huddled together, only to see the vanished ice qilin reappear around them.</p><p>Eight ice qilin, in identical crouching positions, surrounded them, opening their mouths and unleashing a torrent of frigid breath.</p><p>White frost swirled around them, its energy linked to the qilin shadow wall, emanating a strange power that trapped them.</p><p>The frost intensified, threatening to encase them in ice.</p><p>"Strange!"</p><p>The grotesque-faced man frowned, stomping his foot. A green ring erupted from him.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master, meanwhile, gestured with his fingers, sending his red flower soaring before it inverted, descending.  The flower petals fluttered, seemingly delicate, yet possessing incredible suction, drawing in the frost. He defended against the cold.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man targeted the ice qilin themselves. Where his green ring passed, vines erupted, engulfing the eight ice qilin in a vibrant thicket.</p><p>The next moment, the vines withered.</p><p>Deathly energy exploded.  Anyone familiar with his techniques would recognize the "Senro Kugoku" (Hell of Withering Life) he used against them before.  This time, he used it with more control, limiting its range to the ice qilin.</p><p>Instantly, the ice qilin, assaulted by death energy, were coated in grey, their bodies shedding ice, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>But before they could find a way out, the qilin shadow wall shimmered, and new ice qilin emerged.</p><p>Furthermore, the frost from the previous ice qilin hadn't dissipated. These new ones controlled the immense cold with ease, far stronger than before.</p><p>At this moment, both the grotesque-faced man and the Crying Spirit Cave Master realized they were in serious trouble.</p><p>As long as the qilin shadow wall stood, the ice qilin were immortal, endlessly respawning and growing stronger.</p><p>They were confident they could survive the onslaught, waiting for the shadow wall's power to deplete, but this was clearly infeasible.  It would take too long; they needed a solution!</p><p>Deep within the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>The Taiji Altar.</p><p>The avatar, having memorized the Taiji Altar's restrictions, returned to the outer formation. It placed the ice disc back on the altar to replenish its energy while analyzing the altar and the remnant formation.</p><p>The qilin shadow wall shook the Ice Instrument Palace.</p><p>The avatar's expression shifted, and it darted towards the outer chamber.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thank you to Hongchen Laojiu for the generous donation!</p>
