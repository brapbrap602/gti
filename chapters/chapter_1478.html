<h1>Chapter 1470: The Power of the Sun God Tree (4k)</h1><p>Outside Tianpeng Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently for a day before seeing a black light shoot out from the mountain.</p><p>Hunmo the Elder, using his escape technique, left alone.</p><p>Shortly after, Tianpeng the Great Saint led a group of demons out of the mountain, but in a different direction from Hunmo the Elder, heading straight east to continue the war, with Bifa prominently among them.</p><p>After both parties left, Qin Sang emerged from hiding.</p><p>He gazed at the demonic clouds drifting eastward, then glanced in the direction Hunmo the Elder had gone.</p><p>For a whole day, he wondered what the old demon and the demon saint were plotting.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally planned to secretly follow Hunmo the Elder and Tianpeng the Great Saint if they went treasure hunting or plotting something, watching the situation and acting accordingly, seizing the opportunity to strike back with their own methods.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang guessed that the most likely scenario was that the time hadn't arrived yet, and they had scheduled another meeting. He couldn't possibly track these two top experts indefinitely, so he gave up.</p><p>At this point, Bifa had also left, and there was no longer any need to stay here.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment and secretly contacted a secret agent from Xuantian Palace, reporting the secret meeting between Hunmo the Elder and the demon saint to Xuantian Palace, then disregarded the matter.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang traveled through the remaining parts of the Demon Realm, setting sail towards the north.</p><p>…</p><p>The Celestial Horn.</p><p>This is a solitary island off the coast, near the storm belt.</p><p>The island has towering peaks and jagged rocks, riddled with holes, scarred and desolate, lifeless, everywhere showing the marks of devastating hurricanes.</p><p>Fortunately, the demon race had occupied this place without destroying the island.</p><p>On the highest peak, an iron sword was stuck into the mountaintop.</p><p>The sword was rusty and its divine power was not evident, like a sword weathered by wind and rain, just like the person who erected it, even the legends about this person were gradually fading away with time.</p><p>But the story and meaning behind this sword still attract people's admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang climbed the Celestial Horn, arrived at the place where Tianyue the Superior had erected the sword, feeling fortunate to be able to admire this sword, bowed three times to it.</p><p>After becoming a guest elder, Qin Sang learned more about Tianyue the Superior's deeds from Xuantian Palace.</p><p>At that time, after Tianyue the Superior challenged various major sects with his sword and erected the sword at the Celestial Horn, the turmoil had not ended yet. Two Xuantian Palace elders, together with other experts from various regions, including righteous and demonic cultivators and demon kings from the Demon Realm, went to the Beichen Region, and since then, there has been no news of them.</p><p>Not long after, those people's sects received grand gifts, their heads neatly placed in jade boxes, appearing quietly in the sect's forbidden areas!</p><p>This included Xuantian Palace.</p><p>The heads of the elders were sent back to Lingxiao Peak.  The then-Palace Master of Xuantian Palace was a late-Yuan Ying expert, who was in seclusion at Lingxiao Peak and was completely unaware of it.</p><p>Since then, the North Sea was terrified, no one dared to cross the line, and the Beichen Region was peaceful.</p><p>In a sense, Qin Sang is also considered to be carrying on Tianyue the Superior's legacy.</p><p>…</p><p>After visiting the sacred site, Qin Sang entered the Star Sand Archipelago.</p><p>Facing demons who shifted into demon form and reverted to human form when interacting with humans, he navigated between the two races with ease.</p><p>The situation in the Star Sand Archipelago was not optimistic. Humans could now only defend a small area. Most of the Star Sand Archipelago had become a demon nest.  Fortunately, Tianpeng the Great Saint had turned his attention to Xuantian Palace, allowing them to catch their breath.</p><p>Qin Sang claimed to be a special envoy from Xuantian Palace, visiting the Yuan Ying experts of the Star Sand Archipelago to discuss mutual assistance and resistance against the demons. He wasn't deceiving them; he had discussed this with Shi Xue beforehand.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Qin Sang learned about numerous secret places in the Star Sand Archipelago, touring the area at the fastest speed. He still didn't find any fragments of the Killing Sword, only two spiritual herbs of acceptable quality.</p><p>The experiences of this period confirmed Qin Sang's previous guess.</p><p>The Killing Sword fragments and the cultivation techniques that went with them were likely not randomly scattered, but deliberately dispersed by someone for some reason.</p><p>The places where they fell must be ancient fairy palaces similar to the Ziwei Palace and Qisha Hall. There was no need to waste time on those smaller secret realms and forbidden areas.</p><p>There's also a possibility that, similar to the first fragment, it was obtained unexpectedly by the Shaohua Mountain Patriarch and brought back to the sect.</p><p>However, this possibility is small and requires luck.</p><p>Recalling where the first two fragments were stored, they were both in the depths of secret realms, extremely hidden places.</p><p>The Shaohua Mountain Patriarch discovered the Tian Shan secret passage and only then obtained this fragment.</p><p>The second fragment was even placed in the Nether Valley on the Yitian Peak of Qisha Hall, its entrance hidden within the ancient hall wall, impossible to obtain through normal means.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang pinned his greatest hope on the Xuan Tian Sacred Land. If the Sacred Land did not have any Killing Sword fragments, he would have to leave the North Sea and go to the Central Plains to search.</p><p>Having explored the Star Sand Islands, Qin Sang planned to finish one last task in the Demon Realm before returning to the Crescent Realm.</p><p>...</p><p>Southwest Demon Realm.</p><p>This place is near the coast, with beautiful scenery and charming views.  Mountains and valleys are connected by paths, and underground, hidden rivers intertwine, forming a well-developed water system that eventually flows into the sea.  Living water cascades down the deep mountain streams.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared silently. He surveyed the surrounding area, silently flying to a high point to examine the rivers. Based on information he had gathered, Qin Sang deduced that the Frog Fish's lair should be hidden here.  However, this demon was very low-key, had no demon soldiers, acted cautiously, and its lair was extremely well-hidden, unknown to anyone. Tong Lingyu traveled north, exposing the Bi Fang and the cunning fox, but failed to find the Frog Fish.  This demon didn't participate in the Heavenly Peng Great Sage's attack on the Xuan Tian Palace, perhaps frightened by the fate of the Bi Fang and the fox, and has been silent for years.</p><p>A gentle breeze brushed against Qin Sang's cheeks.  A Sky Eye Butterfly emerged, gently fluttering its wings, affectionately circling Qin Sang. Qin Sang stroked the butterfly's soft wings, then used his concealment technique to dive into the river, swimming deep to the bottom, moving among the aquatic plants, searching aimlessly.</p><p>To avoid alarming the demon, Qin Sang couldn't use his spiritual sense, so he had to search personally, checking every corner, relying on his Sky Eye ability to find the Frog Fish's underwater dwelling.</p><p>The underground water network was dense within a thousand li radius, but Qin Sang was incredibly patient, tirelessly searching every hidden river and water channel, inch by inch.</p><p>Diligence pays off.</p><p>After more than a month, Qin Sang finally discovered something unusual in an underground pool. The pool was hidden at the bottom of a hidden river, completely dark inside, with the entrance stones worn smooth by the flowing water. The river flowed steadily here, yet felt unusually cold.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped upstream, observing the pool. After a moment, a slight smile appeared on his lips. "It looks like a human method, quite ingenious. Did the Frog Fish obtain it from the Boundless Sea?"</p><p>A spirit formation was hidden within the pool. The formation was cleverly designed, its fluctuations extremely faint, specifically targeting spiritual sense. If Qin Sang had used his spiritual sense from the surface, he would not only have difficulty discovering the pool but would also trigger the formation, alarming the demon inside. He had anticipated this and used his Sky Eye ability to avoid detection.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang carefully retreated, searching elsewhere and discovering another possible entrance. The demon clearly understood the principle of "a cunning rabbit has three burrows," able to escape at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang looked thoughtful.  His external avatar wasn't fully developed yet, preventing him from blocking both exits simultaneously. Furthermore, Qin Sang suspected the Frog Fish's lair had more than two exits, making blockage useless.</p><p>He decided to stop searching and return to the pool, secretly breaking the formation, and then forcibly entering the lair!</p><p>This was a confident decision.  Given Qin Sang's mastery of formations and with the Sky Eye Butterfly's assistance, uncovering the formation's details wouldn't be difficult. The key was to break the formation quickly, preventing the Frog Fish from escaping.  Qin Sang knew the Frog Fish was powerful in the water and couldn't allow it to flee into the river.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang hastened his pace, returning to the pool and hiding. The Sky Eye Butterfly, obedient and quiet, perched on Qin Sang's shoulder, its wings slightly spread, the Sky Eye pattern like a pair of true eyes, staring at the pool.</p><p>This formation wasn't top-tier, focusing on counteracting spiritual sense detection, inevitably sacrificing other aspects. He dedicated his attention to understanding the formation's principles, but didn't act rashly; he had mentally rehearsed countless times, considering the most efficient method of breaking the formation.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, the formation's defensive capabilities were poor. The Frog Fish clearly hadn't intended to create an impregnable underwater lair, but rather one it could abandon at any time.  Breaking the formation wasn't difficult, but preventing the Frog Fish from escaping before it detected him was extremely challenging.</p><p>Only swift, decisive action would suffice!</p><p>The Qianjun Ring flashed, and the Sun God Tree soared. Its main body radiated red light, hidden by Qin Sang's technique; otherwise, the hidden river would have turned crimson.  Any leakage of energy would cause the river water to evaporate and the river to dry up.</p><p>Nine magnificent birds, each with a fiery red plumage, stood proudly atop the nine buds of the Sun God Tree.  Their bodies, composed entirely of flames, resembled legendary Zhuque, yet their presence on the tree evoked the mythical Golden Crows and Fusang Tree. Qin Sang, their creator, called them Sun God Birds.  Their recent formation marked the completion of his long-awaited treasure.  Having spent considerable time with the Sun God Tree, he felt no need for further refinement.</p><p>These seemingly delicate birds held terrifying power.  Even Qin Sang, the creator, felt a shiver down his spine when near them, handling them with utmost care.</p><p>"It's your turn," he murmured, cradling the tree. His gaze swept across the birds, finally settling on the top three.  The Sun God Tree, crafted from rare white bronze, green bronze, a nine-lives turtle shell, and genuine Zhuque feathers – a combination of extraordinary artifacts – would see its first battle.</p><p>Stowing the tree, Qin Sang awakened Fei Can, a silk worm, coaxing, "Work hard.  This creature might hold a poisonous pill, a potential boon for you."  Fei Can, instantly alert, responded with a colorful aura, manifesting a protective shell against poisons.</p><p>With preparations complete, Qin Sang summoned his magical fire and drifted towards the deep pool.  Tianmu Butterfly, its wings trembling slightly, relayed every change in the spirit array to Qin Sang.  He soon reached the pool, his fingers twitching.  He subtly infiltrated the array with tendrils of his magical fire, evading detection thanks to the butterfly's assistance.  The fire wove a net, a counter-array of incredible precision, impossible before his spirit-form cultivation.</p><p>At the right moment, he shouted, "Open!"</p><p>Within the Water Palace, a dazzling spectacle of jewels, coral, and pearls unfolded. A frog-like creature, in its true form, lay on a bed crafted from a giant clam shell, its eyes closed, a green light pulsing from its mouth, each breath intensifying and shrinking the glow.  Unaware of the impending doom, it continued its practice.</p><p>A sudden, deafening boom shook the palace. Jewels scattered, coral snapped, the entire structure plunged into chaos. The creature, startled, hastily swallowed the green light, regaining human form and glaring at the source of the disturbance.</p><p>Its expression changed upon seeing the black flames engulfing its spirit array, instantly shattering its defenses.  The memory of this black fire – that terrifying magical fire – was seared into its mind; it recalled a previous battle where overwhelming numbers had barely saved them from its destructive power.</p><p>"Him!"  It gasped, recognizing Qin Sang's revenge.  The human dared enter the妖境(yao jing - demon realm)!  It had regretted its prior encounter with Bi Fang and the elders from Xuan Tian Palace, escaping only after abandoning a cunning fox. That adventure had yielded nothing but trouble, attracting powerful enemies.</p><p>Knowing it was no match, it made no attempt to resist, gathering the palace's treasures to escape through another exit.</p><p>Another, even more powerful explosion reverberated through the Water Palace. The creature felt a blinding, disorienting wave of energy, far beyond the effect of the mere sound.</p><p>Its vision was obliterated, replaced by intense white light.</p><p>From amidst the light, Qin Sang stepped into the Water Palace, the Sun God Tree hanging behind him, now with three fewer birds.  While appearing calm, he was internally shocked.  Although he had tested the tree's power, the full force far exceeded his expectations.  His spirit-form control barely managed to harness three birds, yet it effortlessly decimated the spirit array and breached the palace.  He realized that if Tong Ling Yu hadn't withheld information, the initial explosive power of three birds would've significantly surpassed the four-fold power of the Serpent Seal she possessed, possibly reaching three or even four times its strength.</p><p>The cost? Almost half of his energy was depleted, leaving him feeling drained.</p>
