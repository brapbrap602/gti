<h1>Chapter 1002: Unrequited Affection</h1><p>Afterward, the two exchanged insights on the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula*, enjoying each other's company.  One, a cultivator, the other, a descendant of the Flood Dragon, their understanding of the cultivation method differed greatly, each having their own strengths. After a discussion, they both gained something from the exchange.</p><p>"Since there's no need to go to the Seal, I won't impose any further," Qin Sang said, giving a slight bow.</p><p>Then, he remembered something and retrieved a Profound Armor Talisman from his Spatial Ring.  "In a little over ten years, the Seven Kills Palace will reappear. The Nine Phoenix King planted a spy within the Inner Palace. I suspect she might also lead people into the Seven Kills Palace.  Do you have any way to integrate my blood essence into the Profound Armor Talisman?  If a similar situation arises again, it might give me some leeway..."</p><p>Qin Sang was taking precautions.</p><p>No one knew how many Demon Kings had infiltrated the Inner Sea or what their motives were.</p><p>He suspected there might be more than just the Nine Phoenix King.</p><p>If he encountered other Demon Kings in the Seven Kills Palace, there would be no Yuan Zhu to conceal his identity this time.</p><p>Yuan Zhu paced back and forth, lost in thought for a long time.  He shook his head. "These Profound Armor Talismans were personally refined by the Flood Dragon King. Although I’ve inadvertently learned a few things, I don't actually know much about them.  Rashly tampering with the restrictions would easily damage the talisman itself.  Trying to deceive a Demon King with this method would likely be very difficult."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed, but he also understood that this kind of thing couldn't be forced.</p><p>He put away the Profound Armor Talisman, about to take his leave.</p><p>Yuan Zhu hesitated for a moment, then suddenly said, "If you're worried about being discovered by the Demon Kings, I do have a method that might make them hesitate to attack you."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. "Please tell me."</p><p>"I have an unnamed secret technique that I obtained by chance. You’ve cultivated the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula*, so the demonic energy you carry is exceptionally pure.  Using this secret technique, you might be able to fool the Demon Kings into thinking that you are also a transformed Great Demon. After all, the Nine Phoenix King and the others come from the Demon Sea and aren't familiar with the demonic factions of the Boundless Sea. Surrounded by enemies here, they would be eager to recruit fellow demons and certainly wouldn't offend one lightly. By stabilizing the situation, you can find an opportunity to escape."</p><p>As Yuan Zhu spoke, he took out a jade slip and handed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>"This secret technique can only be used to bluff, disguising your cultivation as being at the Transformation stage.  It has no other uses. When using the technique, you mustn't use your true essence. If you do, you'll be exposed immediately. Only we demons can perceive this subtle difference; it won't work on Nascent Soul cultivators. Also, whether or not it can fool the Demon Kings is still uncertain, so don't be careless."</p><p>Qin Sang used his divine sense to examine the contents of the jade slip.</p><p>As Yuan Zhu had said, it was a rather useless secret technique.</p><p>After activation, it could only cause the demonic energy within one's body to undergo a peculiar change, resembling that of a transformed Great Demon, profound and restrained, making it difficult to discern. However, it wouldn't increase one's strength in the slightest.</p><p>It would be easy to see through.</p><p>Even so, it was still an option.</p><p>"Thank you, Fellow Daoist Yuan."</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, deciding to find time to master the technique.</p><p>Yuan Zhu chuckled.  "If you can cause some trouble for the Nine Phoenix King and her ilk, consider it revenge for me."</p><p>...</p><p>Bidding farewell to Yuan Zhu, Qin Sang returned to the Inner Sea.</p><p>Ten years was neither long nor short.</p><p>He needed to prepare as much as possible for his next trip to the Seven Kills Palace and gather some resources that he could also use after returning to the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>"I should still go to the Demon Sea..."</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang made his decision.</p><p>Further comprehending the Killing Talismans would also require him to go to the Demon Sea and fight demonic beasts.</p><p>He would treat these ten years as laying the foundation for the future.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't go directly to Tianxing City. He took a long detour, first visiting Lingchun Island.</p><p>Lingchun Island was where the Wang sisters' sect was located.  They had been implicated by him before and had gone into hiding.  He wondered how they were doing now.</p><p>Although Skywind Island had been destroyed, the danger wasn't entirely gone.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly inquired about the outcome of the battle at Skywind Island from Ning Wu Hui. He learned that even within the Heavenly Way Sect, rumors abounded with no definitive conclusion.  No one knew what had become of Old Devil Mu.</p><p>If Old Devil Mu had been killed on the spot, why hadn't the righteous and demonic paths announced it to the world to intimidate their rivals?</p><p>There must be something more to the story.</p><p>Lingchun Island wasn't large, but its scenery was picturesque.</p><p>The Wang sisters' sect was actually just an insignificant minor sect; otherwise, the sisters wouldn't have needed to go to the Demon Sea in the Foundation Establishment stage to trade for Fiend Demon Pills.</p><p>The inhabitants of Lingchun Island were all mortals.</p><p>After landing on the island, Qin Sang followed the information provided by the Wang sisters, passing through several mortal cities. In a perilous mountain range inaccessible to ordinary mortals, he found their sect.</p><p>Two mountains stood side by side, a river flowing gently between them.</p><p>A beautiful scene unfolded before his eyes.</p><p>Standing on a mountain peak, Qin Sang swept the area with his Heavenly Eye, easily discovering the unusual aspects of the place.</p><p>His figure flashed, and he landed in front of a stone wall, pressing his hand against it as true essence flowed into the stone.</p><p>The next moment, the restriction hidden within the stone wall was triggered.</p><p>A bamboo pavilion.</p><p>A woman dressed in brocade, with quite a delicate appearance, was meditating with her eyes closed.</p><p>Suddenly, the mirror beside her shone brightly, startling her awake. A hint of surprise flashed in her eyes.  She waved her sleeve over the mirror's surface and, upon seeing the image reflected within, abruptly covered her mouth, letting out a soft gasp.</p><p>"Sister! Sister! Look who's here!"</p><p>This woman was Wang Xiang.</p><p>A moment later, two charming women, like twin flowers, flew out of the bamboo pavilion with hurried expressions.</p><p>Outside the bamboo pavilion, several young girls were playing.  They were utterly astonished to see their two aunts behaving so out of character.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The stone wall split open to the sides, and two delighted cries came from within.</p><p>"Daoist Priest!"</p><p>The two women stood side by side, their faces beaming.</p><p>The elder sister, Wang Shi, was reserved, while the younger sister, Wang Xiang, grinned unrestrainedly.</p><p>As the two women looked on in surprise, Qin Sang removed the hood from his head and said with a smile, "My surname is Qin, and my given name is Sang. The identity of Daoist Priest Qing Feng has attracted powerful enemies and can no longer be used. It has even implicated you two. I came here to apologize to you both. Seeing that you're safe, I'm relieved."</p><p>"Indeed! Indeed!"</p><p>Wang Xiang patted her chest, her face full of lingering fear, and said with a sigh of relief, "We only found out later that the one pursuing you was actually that vicious Old Devil Mu!  Even the Jade Firmament Trading Company was destroyed by him. Fortunately, we rarely interacted with outsiders after returning, otherwise, the consequences would have been unthinkable. How did you provoke such a great devil?"</p><p>Wang Shi was somewhat silent, her eyes carrying a trace of resentment as she spoke words that were unexpected. "So, if this hadn't happened, Daoist Priest wouldn't have come to see us?"</p><p>Wang Xiang's almond-shaped eyes darted back and forth, sizing up her sister and Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang touched his nose, momentarily speechless.</p><p>Wang Shi, however, regained her composure and invited Qin Sang inside.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's retreating figure, a hint of disappointment flickered in the depths of her eyes. Finally, she sighed softly within her heart, as if resolving a knot, and ultimately finding peace.</p>
