<h1>Chapter 866: Grudges</h1><p>The residual power alone was enough to make everyone's faces change color.</p><p>They didn't hesitate to abandon the crystal stele and flee.</p><p>But the situation was worse than they imagined.</p><p>Cold air surged back, clashing against the lightning.</p><p>The two forces collided, producing a loud boom and a sizzling sound, like water vapor evaporating.</p><p>For a moment, the cold air seemed to block the lightning, but if anyone were at the point of collision, they would see the cold air being consumed at an alarming rate.</p><p>High in the sky, those who saw the lightning cascade down laughed heartily, feeling a sense of vengeance.</p><p>But when they saw the Cold Gale Formation actually resisting the Lightning Summoning Technique, their anger surged again. Following the middle-aged man's command, they once again cast their secret technique, gathering more lightning.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The lightning condensed into a thick bolt, descending from the sky as if carrying world-destroying power.</p><p>They were clearly not having an easy time either.</p><p>Those with lower cultivation levels swayed unsteadily.</p><p>Even the strongest, the middle-aged man, turned pale.</p><p>Compared to them, Qin Sang and the others were in a more dire situation.</p><p>They thought the Cold Gale Formation would buy them enough time to escape, but the reality was crueler. The cold air only weakened the lightning's power, not stopping it.  The lightning pierced through.</p><p>The Cold Gale Formation was forcibly torn open, the crystal stele shook violently, cracks appeared at its base and rapidly spread upwards.</p><p>“The Cold Gale Formation is going to be destroyed!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart was filled with shock and terror.</p><p>The lightning's power was terrifying.  Even after destroying the formation, it was still ferocious, making his scalp tingle. The terrifying power that only Nascent Soul ancestors possessed was now being wielded by these Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>His vision was overwhelmed by the lightning; he couldn't see anything.</p><p>But Qin Sang could clearly sense the extremely yang and firm power descending from above, carrying immense destructive force, destroying all resistance.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The crystal stele shattered.</p><p>The cold mist dispersed in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang trembled. The Cold Gale Formation was destroyed!</p><p>Although Qin Sang had been wary since those people appeared, he didn't expect the sudden change to happen so fast.  They were still so far away, yet their attack was so swift and fierce.</p><p>Not only Qin Sang, but the others were also shocked. It was simply unheard of; no one could have imagined these people possessed such powerful techniques.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had been focused on the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman. Sword light and a Flood Dragon's shadow flashed from his body as he rushed towards the edge of the island at top speed, escaping the lightning's range.</p><p>The others were not far behind, reacting in their own ways.</p><p>Due to the crystal stele's position, the five were scattered, and at this moment, they could only flee in different directions.</p><p>Only Chu Heng didn't move, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>Although his cultivation was high, his strongest skills were formations and restrictions. His escape techniques and offensive spells were unremarkable. In this situation, there was simply no room for him to use his abilities.</p><p>Unable to escape, he could only resist with all his might, hoping for a sliver of survival.</p><p>The most impressive performance belonged to Ma Deboa. This man was always cunning. Like Qin Sang, he had been wary since the others appeared. Sensing danger, he immediately summoned his magic treasure, the Five Severing Whip.</p><p>A rapid series of 'crack crack crack' whip sounds echoed as the whip's shadow vibrated, creating a strange wave. Using this force, Ma Deboa propelled himself outwards.</p><p>Qiu Ji and Luo Kun somehow managed to contact each other, and the two planned to resist together.</p><p>Among the five, Qin Sang's escape technique was the fastest, but he still couldn't escape the lightning's impact.</p><p>He flickered, then abruptly stopped. The lightning was just inches away. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes, and a burst of golden light erupted from his body.</p><p>At the center of the golden light was a suit of golden armor, the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>This magic treasure had protected him many times since he obtained it. Due to the extremely durable materials used in its creation, although it was a low-grade magic treasure, it still held its own.</p><p>The Golden Radiance Armor was damaged at the Seven Kills Sect but was later repaired by Qin Sang. With his understanding of refining tools, he incorporated new materials during the repair process, making its defensive capabilities even stronger.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The lightning struck.</p><p>The Golden Radiance Armor completely enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a tremendous force slam into him. He groaned, sent flying, and simultaneously heard a crisp cracking sound. To his horror, he discovered cracks had appeared on the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>This magic treasure, just repaired a few years ago, was facing damage again.</p><p>No!</p><p>It wasn't just damage.</p><p>In an instant, countless cracks filled the entire armor. This treasure, which had followed him for decades and made great contributions, was about to be destroyed!</p><p>The Golden Radiance Armor's sacrifice wasn't meaningless. Qin Sang clearly felt that it had blocked most of the lightning's power. The most dangerous moment had passed!</p><p>However, before Qin Sang could rejoice, the residual power seeped in through the cracks in the Golden Radiance Armor.</p><p>Lightning struck his body, invading his meridians, and a tingling sensation spread throughout his body.</p><p>Qin Sang stiffened, his heart racing. This lightning energy was easy to expel and wouldn't cause much damage, but it affected his movement and reactions.</p><p>But then he felt a sense of relief as the tingling sensation disappeared. He realized the Celestial Eye Butterfly was dancing in his Qi Sea, using its lightning control ability to devour the invading lightning.</p><p>Compared to the lightning in the sky, the lightning on the Celestial Eye Butterfly's wings seemed so weak.</p><p>However, the lightning had been weakened by the Cold Gale Formation and blocked by the Golden Radiance Armor. By the time it passed through Qin Sang's protective true essence and invaded his body, it was already very weak and easily swallowed by the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed, silently praising his natal insect gu. He then used his escape technique again, not looking back. He had sensed a familiar, incredibly violent aura behind him – it was the Kui Dragon!</p><p>The Kui Dragon hadn't died. It had been released from the spirit formation at the last moment, and it wasn't afraid of the Lightning Summoning Technique. It wanted revenge!</p><p>Chu Heng desperately struggled to survive under the Lightning Summoning Technique. He endured the most intense wave but, unaware of the approaching danger, was bitten in half by the Kui Dragon without any resistance.</p><p>Qiu Ji and Luo Kun, fighting together, were in a much better situation than Chu Heng. They sensed the Kui Dragon's sneak attack but were horrified to discover they were paralyzed by the lightning, their true essence stagnant, and their reactions slower than before.</p><p>They fought back desperately, but the Kui Dragon was frenzied, ignoring its injuries, swallowing them both one after the other.</p><p>Ma Deboa had escaped the furthest after Qin Sang. He also noticed the Kui Dragon's rampage. Although in a much worse state than Qin Sang, he still vigorously shook the Five Severing Whip, struggling to survive.</p><p>The Kui Dragon was seriously injured but still formidable. His companions were either dead or injured, and the strongest, the young man surnamed Fang, was unaccounted for.</p><p>Those mysterious people were still watching from afar.</p><p>Qin Sang had no desire to turn back and rushed out of the island.</p><p>Just then, a furious shout came from ahead, "Golden Radiance Armor! You killed my junior brother!"</p>
