  <p class="calibre5">
   "EsGod was really captured?"
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Urranrell received a report from the fleet commander within the
          Ruler's office and was a little surprised.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The Ruler was busy with official business, so after a simple meeting
          to form a cooperation between the three civilizations, Urranrell did
          not continue to pay attention to this operation.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Urranrell had attached importance to Han Xiao's determination to get
          rid of EsGod, but she did not care about the operation that took
          place. This mentality was just like a billionaire taking out a hundred
          thousand to make an investment. It was purely to test the waters, and
          whether it succeeded or failed was relatively unimportant. Having
          received the report of success, however, she was pleasantly surprised.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   EsGod, who had constantly given them a headache, was finally removed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The existence of EsGod had always been the bane of the three Universal
          Civilizations, it represented chaos and lawlessness, and it was a firm
          enemy of order. Both sides had clearly demarcated their boundaries,
          but in some cases, the three civilizations would rely on its strength.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The notoriety of EsGod came from its atrocities, and although it was
          tyrannical, it would definitely not come to rile the three
          civilizations up without a valid reason. The targets of its crimes
          were mainly some star cluster or super star cluster level
          civilizations, and rampaging about in these territories was actually a
          benefit to the three civilizations.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   On the other hand, the Fallen Ark fleet attracted thugs and wanted
          criminals from all over the universe. The disadvantage was that the
          power of EsGod was repeatedly increasing, which made him harder and
          harder to deal with. The benefit in this was that because all the
          wanted criminals were gathered in one place, it became easier to
          control them and keep tabs on them, increasing their security.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Of course, this was under the premise that EsGod was sufficiently
          strong. If he was not so difficult to deal, the three civilizations
          would not have left him alone.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Now that Black Star had really captured EsGod, getting rid of this
          tricky enemy, they were obviously pleased.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was equivalent to capturing the head of the terrorists, and it
          showed that the anti-terrorism measures of the three civilizations had
          an effect. The greater the shadow EsGod had left on the galactic
          residents, the more reputation they would gain.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Urranrell nodded in satisfaction. "Excellent, Black Star did not waste
          my efforts. He did well."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "EsGod was likely careless, or else, with his strength, there's no one
          in the Universe that would be able to capture him," Clotti said
          calmly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He had also faced EsGod a few times, and his judgment was accurate. If
          EsGod ran the moment he faced a blockade, no one would be able to
          capture him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A pity that all of this was only hypothetical. EsGod's behavior would
          never allow him to perform in this manner; he would definitely engage
          in battle first. If he only knew how to run, there was no way that he
          would have been able to reach his current strength and infamy. He
          would have long been removed by the three civilizations.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "No matter what, Black Star did not let down my expectations."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Urranrell was getting more and more satisfied with Han Xiao. From
          viciously beating up the Arcane Church in the battle of Planet
          Lighthouse to getting rid of the Archenemy of the three Universal
          Civilizations, he had brought much fame and benefits to the dynasty.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   …
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   While the dynasty fleet was on the journey back, they received a reply
          from the upper echelons of the dynasty.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In the center of the command room, a remote projection appeared. It
          was Urranrell. Seeing this, everyone got up to salute, and Han Xiao as
          well as the other Beyond Grade As also symbolically bowed their heads.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "All of you did well this time. You have made a tremendous
          contribution to the dynasty. The dynasty will not be stringy with the
          corresponding reward."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Urranrell stood with her hands behind her, her tone full of praises.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Facing the leader of the dynasty, everyone maintained the aloofness of
          a Beyond Grade A and only nodded, accepting her praise.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "If not for Black Star managing to convince the Federation of Light to
          participate, I would not have been able to contribute much to this
          joint operation. I've seen the report, and Black Star had the biggest
          part to play in the capture of EsGod. The dynasty plans to announce
          Black Star as the core of our publicity stunts. I believe no one will
          object to it," Urranrell said.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Capturing EsGod was a frightening battle record, and Urranrell was
          ready to put the credit on Han Xiao's head, helping him to spread his
          reputation.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "Of course not, this is the truth." Milizaus laughed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He had been heavily injured in the battle of Planet Lighthouse, and he
          had always remembered this grudge. Seeing that EsGod had fallen into
          their hands, he felt so pleased, as though he was offered a cold
          refreshing drink on a hot summer day. His goodwill toward Han Xiao
          increased even further.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The rest did not have any objections. They were still waiting for the
          use of the evolution cube, so no one was willing to fight with Han
          Xiao for credit.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "Then, I'll thank the dynasty in advance." Han Xiao laughed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "Good, you guys quickly bring EsGod back. The dynasty will lock him in
          the most secretive location." Urranrell paused for a moment. "That's
          right. Black Star, you mentioned that those that are sealed by the
          Spacetime Amber will have their souls slowly die off due to the long
          captivity, right?"
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "That's right." Han Xiao nodded and understood her intentions. "Does
          the dynasty wish to study EsGod?"
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "Yes, it has high research value. After so many combinations of gene
          chains, it has mastered all kinds of abilities. If this can be
          cracked, the genetic technology of the dynasty will have progress, and
          the number of Supers will also increase." Urranrell did not conceal
          it. "Of course, only when his soul dies can we begin the research. How
          long do you think we need?"
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao stroked his chin. "I recommend at least five hundred years to
          start with."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Urranrell stood in deep thought for a moment before nodding. "That
          works. Although the period is a little long, let's play safe."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Five hundred years was nothing to the Crimson Dynasty. Their period of
          existence far surpassed that number, and some war preparations even
          took units of a hundred years as a gauge.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After a few more side conversations, Urranrell hung up, and the
          dynasty soldiers present returned to work.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Ravenlaude now turned to Han Xiao. "Since EsGod has already been
          caught, it's time for you to uphold your end of the deal."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao's mouth widened in a smile. Raising his hand, nanoparticles
          surged, and the Evolution Cube was brought to his palm.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "Relax, I value credibility, and since everyone here has helped me in
          solving my issue, I won't cheat you guys."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   …
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The three Universal Civilizations reached a consensus, and only after
          their fleets returned did they announce the arrest of EsGod. Because
          the fighting took place in the desolate universe belt where there were
          limited human traces, most major organizations did not know anything
          about their encounter.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A little over half a month later, the dynasty's fleet smoothly
          returned, and there were no unexpected incidents.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao passed EsGod to another dynasty fleet, who locked EsGod up in
          a secretive location.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The other Beyond Grade As had also obtained their evolution and left
          satisfied, leaving Han Xiao as the only one who returned to Planet
          Crimson Ring.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He immediately contacted Feidin and the rest. After a month apart,
          they were finally reunited.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His goals for going to the Central Galaxy this time had been achieved.
          Han Xiao announced the end of the vacation before taking them back on
          his own spaceship, departing back for the Shattered Star Ring.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   In the spaceship, Han Xiao took the excuse of not meeting them for a
          long time to have a meal and thoroughly 'molested' Feidin and Nero.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Feidin was used to it and just had a face of helplessness, but Nero
          squirmed left and right, not used to Han Xiao's 'passionate' self. He
          was dizzy from all the 'love' given by Han Xiao's big hands.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Reynold thought that he would undergo such a treatment as well and
          took a deep breath, psychologically preparing himself, but Han Xiao
          only turned and left, as though not interested in him. This made
          Reynold feel a little depressed.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After recharging his luck, Han Xiao locked himself in the room and
          opened the interface to complete the mission [Archenemy of the Three
          Universal Civilizations].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">

   Han Xiao's eyes sparkled.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This skill… is a little overpowered.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   If a civilization's Beyond Grade A has this ability, it would be
          equivalent to an unlimited number of Esper Ability Potential Enhancing
          Fluid shots. Even if this could only be used on Espers, it was enough
          to raise the prowess of the Espers in the entire civilization by one
          whole level.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was a strategic level ability!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A pity, the one who obtained this was EsGod. With his stingy
          character, chances were low that he would help his subordinates raise
          their strength.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   EsGod had collected all these abilities, which was equivalent to
          killing off a lot of potential geniuses. If the original owners of
          this ability did not fall to EsGod, it was likely that they would have
          become distinguished guests of the Universal Civilizations.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao rubbed his hands, choosing the Talent option.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Since the Esper class was incompatible with his due to the different
          sources of strength, he knew that many Esper Abilities could not be
          extracted.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Since he could obtain abilities this time, he should by right utilize
          it. However, it would likely be more beneficial for him to obtain a
          good talent first.

  <p class="calibre5">
   1. Talent: Particle Structure Reinforcement - Immunity to True Damage.

  <p class="calibre5">
   2. Talent: Crazed Devotee - +20% Resistance to abnormal mental status.

  <p class="calibre5">
   3. Talent: Cell Division Control - Consumes energy to stimulate cell

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao's eyes sparkled. He drew two Molding Talents this time, which
          were the first and third options.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His gaze was firmly locked on the [Cell Division Control]. This talent
          should have been converted from the 'strengthened self-recovery' of
          EsGod, which was similar to his [Middle Grade Cell Proliferation
          Control]. It was just that the efficiency was not as high as his.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His own HP had now broken through 500,000, and even if he converted
          all of his energy, it would not even reach ten percent of his total
          HP. It was far from achieving the cap of twenty-eight percent per
          second. Thus, he would benefit by increasing the efficiency of the
          conversion.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As for the ability to be immune to true damage, he already had it, and
          there was no need to reselect it.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   You have chosen [Cell Division Control].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Your [Middle Grade Cell Proliferation Control] is similar to [Cell
          Division Control], and the two talents will be combined.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Talents can be upgraded! Han Xiao was excited.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Certain similar talents could be merged together to form a stronger
          talent, which was equivalent to an upgrade.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   _____________________
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   You have lost [Cell Division Control].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Your talent [Middle Grade Cell Proliferation Control] has been
          upgraded to [High Grade Cell Proliferation Control].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   High Grade Cell Proliferation Control: Make use of energy to
          proliferate cells, heal wounds, and convert energy into HP at a ratio
          of 1:9. Recovery rate capped at 35% of total HP per second.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   _____________________
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His conversation rate had now increased from 1:5 to 1:9, almost
          doubling the recovery speed. The cap had also increased from
          twenty-eight percent to thirty-five percent.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao exhaled before continuing with the second draw. He still
          stuck to the Talent option.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Another five random talents were drawn, and after a glance, Han Xiao
          chose the Talent [Spiritual Onsen], which gave him an added twenty
          percent psychological resistance, as well as accelerated the removal
          of any abnormal mental statuses and soul damage.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Mental attacks were his shortcoming, so there was a need to stack his
          psychological resistance.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   For his third draw, he still chose Talent. Sweeping the randomized
          reward, his eyes lit up.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Among the five, one of them seemed to be the adjusted version of
          EsGod's Esper ability [Black Hole], which could convert a portion of
          the incoming damage into energy values.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After choosing this talent, the [Intermediate Energy Absorption]
          combined with this to form a new talent.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   _____________________
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Your [Intermediate Energy Absorption] has been promoted to [Expert
          Energy Absorption].
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Expert Energy Absorption: When subject to any physical, energy,
          magical, or other attacks, incoming damage is reduced by 25% and
          converted to energy. The absorbed damage value is not counted as
          offset by resistance, and the remaining 75% of damage received will be
          used to calculate the resistance instead. 60% of the damage offset by
          resistance will be converted into energy.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   _____________________
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Han Xiao roughly did a calculation.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   "If I count it like this, my efficiency in converting damage to energy
          will have increased by more than 1.5 times, and the upgraded talent
          now offers twenty-five percent more absolute resistance."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   With the addition of the [Black Hole] specialty, it directly converted
          part of the damage into energy, which was equivalent to saving the
          energy required to restore this amount of HP.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   If his resistance was fifty percent and he received ten thousand
          damage in theory, then the initial talent effect would mean he
          received five thousand damage and absorbed three thousand energy.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After the upgrade, the effect now was receiving 3,750 damage and
          absorbing 4,750 energy.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The energy obtained was more than the HP lost!
