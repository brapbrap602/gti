<h1>Chapter 399: Frostwind</h1><p>Qin Sang stood before the ice wall, gazing out. As far as he could see, fierce winds whipped up snow, creating a white storm that ravaged the land. The endless blizzard showed no sign of stopping.  The ice wall, battered by the snow, crackled and popped, yet remained unyielding.  An eerie calm pervaded the blizzard – a calm perceptible only to a cultivator's eye. There were no signs of chaotic spiritual energy, no trace of ancient mystical barriers, no monstrous beasts lurking...</p><p>On the surface, it didn't seem as dangerous as Yun Youzi had predicted. After all, Yun Youzi's judgment was based on the Night Roaming Yakshas guarding the barrier, but those Yakshas weren't originally there; they were Wushang's transformations.  Even the Horned Flood Dragons might have migrated there later, settling in the secluded pool.  Originally, finding the right path would have granted easy access.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a twinge of curiosity about the world beyond the ice wall. Wushang's letter mentioned the Midnight Lily.  Legend had it that the Midnight Lily originally grew here, discovered by a predecessor who also left behind the barriers and teleportation formations within the ice palace. Wushang's intention was to guide those who followed to harvest the Midnight Lily, increasing their chances of completing his Core Formation secret method.</p><p>Qin Sang possessed the mystical Jade Buddha and didn't need the Midnight Lily. Moreover, he wouldn't seize the spiritual herb Yun Youzi desperately needed. He wondered if there were other spiritual herbs besides the Midnight Lily.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang made up his mind. He summoned the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation, grasped his magical treasure, and, after preparing himself, summoned the Five Elements Sword to break the barrier on the ice wall.</p><p>Had Yu Hua not forced him in, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't have risked it. But now that he was inside, and with his magical treasure bolstering his strength, he felt that with enough caution, a quick look wouldn't hurt. He wasn't necessarily seeking treasure; finding something would be a bonus, but its absence wouldn't matter. If the path ahead proved truly dangerous, he could always retreat.</p><p>He moved cautiously, slowly opening the barrier and silently leaving the ice palace.  The fierce wind and snow immediately buffeted him. Though prepared and protected by spiritual energy, Qin Sang couldn't help but shiver, his expression changing slightly. This was no ordinary snowstorm.  It carried a chilling aura, more dreadful than the Blood Miasma at the entrance of the Boundless Valley!  Qin Sang took out a jade pendant and activated the Azure Yang Demonic Fire within to ward off the cold.</p><p>Ambushed by the blizzard the moment he stepped out, Qin Sang grew extremely vigilant, carefully observing his surroundings. Once inside, he realized this wasn't the vast icy plain he'd imagined. It seemed to be another ice cave, albeit an enormous one.  Qin Sang walked a considerable distance before barely making out the opposite ice wall.</p><p>The ice palace he'd just left was situated in an inconspicuous corner beneath the ice wall, completely hidden from the outside. The barrier not only withstood the blizzard's onslaught but also served as camouflage. The icy wind blew in ceaselessly from the right, where the cave entrance seemed to be.  Ahead, however, lay a chaotic expanse of white snow, the spiritual energy in the distance growing turbulent.</p><p>Qin Sang retreated to the ice wall behind him and carefully proceeded along it, like swimming against a powerful current.  He moved slowly, suppressing his aura, cautiously probing ahead, ready to retreat at the first sign of trouble.  The wind howled, growing fiercer the further he went, causing the Azure Yang Demonic Fire surrounding him to flicker and sway.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered another terrifying aspect of the wind: not only did it carry a chill capable of freezing a cultivator's body, but this chill could also assail the Nascent Soul! And the Azure Yang Demonic Fire offered no defense against this. This wind was definitely not a natural phenomenon!</p><p>Racking his brain, Qin Sang recalled a similar account in an ancient text.  There existed a divine wind known as the Frostwind. Wherever the Frostwind blew, it created an environment of extreme cold and Yin energy, a death trap for cultivators. Its most terrifying aspect was its ability to directly attack the Nascent Soul—a strange and difficult attack to defend against. If a cultivator's cultivation was insufficient and they lacked protective magical treasures, their body and Nascent Soul would be frozen solid from the inside out, then shattered into dust by the wind!</p><p>Qin Sang's Nascent Soul remained unharmed thanks to the Jade Buddha's protection.  However, he wasn't facing the true Frostwind, only winds influenced by it. Otherwise, even with the Jade Buddha protecting his Nascent Soul, the Azure Yang Demonic Fire would have been extinguished long ago, and his physical body wouldn't have withstood the Frostwind's assault.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp sound echoed as the jade pendant shattered. The Azure Yang Demonic Fire finally dissipated, the pendant destroyed. Feeling as if he'd plunged into an icy abyss, Qin Sang quickly retrieved another pendant, but this one lasted even shorter.</p><p>Just then, inspiration struck.  He rummaged through his storage pouch and pulled out the Crimson Pill he'd obtained after killing Kong Xin. Back then, Yun Youzi had chosen the most valuable Azure Light Sword, leaving the Crimson Pill and other items to Qin Sang.  The Crimson Pill was highly unstable, unsuitable for refining into magical treasures. It functioned like a large Warming Pearl, useful only for warmth, so Qin Sang had casually stored it away.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it would come in handy now. The Crimson Pill, the core of a Skyfire Jiao, contained the Demonic Fire of a Core Formation demon beast after its transformation.  Its power far surpassed the Azure Yang Demonic Fire sealed within the jade pendant. After all, the best pendants they could buy were only refined by Foundation Establishment cultivators of the Azure Yang Demonic Sect, containing merely a wisp of Demonic Fire, no match for the Crimson Pill.</p><p>Holding the Crimson Pill, Qin Sang immediately felt a warm current surge through his body, effectively blocking the wind's chill. However, even the Crimson Pill couldn't ward off the cold that assaulted his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Did Yun Youzi have a way to protect his Nascent Soul? Qin Sang's expression grew serious. He still hadn't seen Yun Youzi, who was likely further ahead.  The closer he got to the true Frostwind, the more terrifying the chill became. Yun Youzi's Nascent Soul was already damaged; without a means of protection, he could only endure it.  Even without other dangers, how far could he go?  Yun Youzi had entered earlier, while Qin Sang had experienced a fierce battle and spent time meditating in the ice palace to recover.  With no sign of Yun Youzi's return after so long, could it be…?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang decided to quicken his pace, the ground beneath his feet suddenly trembled.  The entire ice cave shook violently, as if struck by an earthquake.  The blizzard raged, producing a deafening roar that echoed through the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang steadied himself, his face paling. The tremors originated from ahead.  Though there had only been one so far, it was not a good omen. If an ancient beast blocked the path, Yun Youzi would face both the Frostwind and the beast—two terrifying enemies!</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Ebony Sword, secretly activating the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation.  Pushing off the ground, he increased his speed, fighting against the wind and forging ahead.</p>
