<h1>Chapter 959: Setting the Course</h1><p>Chapter 959: Setting the Course</p><p>The roar was unusual; it was impossible to tell what kind of ferocious beast it was.</p><p>Qin Sang reached back, summoning his twin-headed magic weapon, then lowered his body to conceal his aura.</p><p>He glanced at the fleeing cultivator, a strange expression flashing in his eyes.</p><p>The cultivator's escaping light was actually black and white.</p><p>This kind of escaping light was rare. Qin Sang had only seen it before on cultivators from the Yin-Yang branch of the Lan Dou Sect. They cultivated Yin and Yang energy from the Qi Condensation stage, and only by using a unique escape technique would their escaping light exhibit this special color.</p><p>“Could it be someone from the Yin-Yang branch of the Lan Dou Sect?  Could it be Elder Huayang?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>The beast finally appeared.</p><p>From afar, it looked like a black demonic wind. Even with Qin Sang's keen eyesight, he could only vaguely make out the beast's outline, something resembling a hawk; its wings flapped gently, yet it covered a significant distance with each flap—its speed was clearly much faster than the cultivator's.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The beast roared wildly, the demonic wind rippling, shattering the surrounding rocks.</p><p>Within a few breaths, the beast was closing in on the cultivator.  After a roar, the beast opened its mouth wide, spewing a ball of demonic fire from the demonic wind.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Wherever the demonic fire passed, plants and trees were ignited, instantly turning to ash.</p><p>Feeling the power of the demonic fire, the cultivator's face was filled with terror. He hastily made a hand gesture, altering his escape light, diving sharply downward, yet still got grazed by the edge of the fire.</p><p>The cultivator screamed, falling into the mountains.  Fortunately, he wasn't seriously injured. Without a moment's hesitation, he again used his escape technique, fleeing blindly.</p><p>Hidden in the shadows, Qin Sang observed the chase, roughly judging the strengths of both parties.</p><p>The beast was aggressive, its strength slightly inferior to a late-stage Core Formation demonic beast. The cultivator, though at the mid-stage Core Formation level, was injured and completely defenseless against the beast.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then flickered, quickly surveying the area to ensure there was no danger before secretly approaching the cultivator’s escape route.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A streak of escaping light broke through the air, flying erratically over a mountain peak.</p><p>The beast followed closely behind.</p><p>The cultivator, burned by the demonic fire, his robe tattered and his body badly injured, wore a look of despair on his face.</p><p>Then, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>Just as the cultivator passed over the mountain peak, a masked figure suddenly leaped from the ground, intercepting them and confronting the beast directly.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang.</p><p>The beast reacted extremely quickly, its eyes blazing with ferocity. Sensing a threat from this person, it opened its sharp beak, spewing a demonic fire the size of a washbasin.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, his escaping light flashing as he easily evaded the fire, appearing beside the beast in the next instant.</p><p>He didn't use his ebony sword, opting for another spirit sword, yet his swordsmanship was no less powerful.</p><p>The beast let out a strange roar, its wings flapping wildly as it gathered demonic wind, barely blocking Qin Sang's attack.  However, faced with Qin Sang's relentless assault, it quickly faltered.</p><p>The beast, terrified, turned and fled.</p><p>Its escape speed was even faster than before, but it was still too slow for Qin Sang. It was enveloped by a whirlwind of sword strikes and perished without much struggle.</p><p>Blood splattered across the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't collect the body, only taking the beast's demonic core. The beasts from the Seven Killing Hall contained a strange, fierce aura unsuitable for refining weapons or pills.</p><p>The demonic core was the same, but high-level demonic cores were uncommon, so Qin Sang still kept it.</p><p>By this time, the fleeing cultivator had stopped far away.  Having narrowly escaped death, he was overjoyed but also apprehensive. After hesitating, he suppressed his injuries and flew back.</p><p>Having witnessed Qin Sang slaughter the beast, the cultivator was utterly shocked.  He looked at Qin Sang nervously, bowing and saying, "Thank you for your help, fellow cultivator."</p><p>Qin Sang turned to look at the cultivator.  "Are you a Lan Dou Sect cultivator?"</p><p>The cultivator dared not hide it, quickly replying, "Fellow cultivator is sharp-eyed. I am indeed a disciple of the Yin-Yang Peak of the Lan Dou Sect. My Dao name is Mingyi. I don't know your Dao name, fellow cultivator. I will never forget your life-saving grace. In the future..."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, stopping Mingyi.  "I hear that the Yin-Yang branch of your Lan Dou Sect specializes in Yin and Yang cultivation. You must have profound attainments in the Dao of Yin and Yang. I'm somewhat interested in it. Would you be willing to explain it to me, along with your insights on your cultivation path?"</p><p>Mingyi was startled. He hadn't expected Qin Sang to make such a request. He immediately nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang only asked Ming Yi about his cultivation insights, not for any techniques, thus not violating any sect rules.  It also allowed him to repay a favor, so he readily answered all his questions.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards Flower Fairy Lake, and they walked and talked, Ming Yi clearly showing his willingness to follow.</p><p>Halfway through their journey, their discussion ended.</p><p>As expected, while Ming Yi's cultivation was far superior to that of Huayang Old Dao's disciple, and his understanding of Yin-Yang Dao was deeper, he was still limited by the first level of the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed; his earlier hunch was correct—the subsequent techniques created by the Yin-Yang Daoist were deeply flawed.</p><p>Ming Yi was surprised to find that Qin Sang also had unique insights into Yin-Yang Dao.  Delighted, he invited Qin Sang to his sect to discuss with his fellow disciples.  However, Qin Sang shook his head, suddenly accelerating and disappearing into the mountains in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"My actions today were simply impulsive; we're even now, fellow cultivator, you needn't worry about it…"</p><p>Leaving Ming Yi staring blankly at the direction Qin Sang vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>"It's a pity. If the 'Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique' could be cultivated further, after Nascent Soul stage, it could be a backup technique. Of course, these treasured techniques always have many restrictions; it's not easy to obtain them.</p><p>"Actually, once I successfully reach Nascent Soul stage, my lifespan will greatly increase, and cultivation won't be as urgent as before.  With Senior Qingzhu's example, perhaps I could try repairing the 'Origin Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter' myself.</p><p>"But this will undoubtedly leave hidden dangers for later, eventually leading to a dead end—it's not a long-term solution.</p><p>"The current cultivation world is desolate, spiritual herbs are scarce. Cultivation is inherently difficult; only exceptional geniuses can have it all!</p><p>"Besides, the Nascent Soul stage is still far from ascension; it's far from the time to create one's own Dao.  When there are no tigers in the mountains, monkeys become kings; Nascent Soul masters can only lord it over the current world.</p><p>"The best approach is to first find a cultivation technique to improve my cultivation; along the way, I can experience the world and discover a path suitable for me…"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this as he neared Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>He opened his palm, revealing the token Elder Zou gave him. He hesitated, then put it away, not activating the restrictions within.</p><p>Soon, the beautiful scenery of Flower Fairy Lake came into view.</p><p>Fei Can seemed to sense something and stirred excitedly in his spirit beast pouch.</p><p>Flower Fairy Lake has two entrances; this time, Qin Sang chose the other one. He took out Fei Can, concealing it within his chest armor, and quickly headed towards the lake.</p><p>Just then, a sudden, urgent sound of breaking air echoed. A streak of light flew directly towards Qin Sang.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>If the next chapter is delayed, I will post it tomorrow morning. I'll try waking up early; it should be better than staying up late.</p>
