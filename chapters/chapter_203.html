<h1>Chapter 196 Invitation (Third update! Ask for recommendations! Ask for votes!)</h1><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang's inquiry, Yu Daiyue hesitated a moment before replying, "I will not deceive you, Junior Brother Qin. This will also be my first visit to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, so I find it hard to offer advice. However, I came here in search of an opportunity, so I definitely can't just remain in the city and become a city guard! Junior Brother Qin, if you are also planning to do something, why don't we team up?"</p><p>Yu Daiyue's invitation did not immediately win Qin Sang's commitment. Instead, he pondered secretly.</p><p>After their experience in the underground cave, Yu Daiyue and Qin Sang had established a level of trust and would be suitable companions.</p><p>However, Yu Daiyue was here in search of an opportunity to break through. He was nearing the age limit and if he couldn't break through the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, he would have no hope of reaching the Core Formation stage. Consequently, he had come with a resolute determination to make a last-ditch effort.</p><p>The outskirts of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would likely not meet his needs and he would inevitably enter dangerous secret realms to gather pills and treasures.</p><p>If Qin Sang were to join Yu Daiyue, he would also be forced to face these dangers.</p><p>On the other hand, Qin Sang had only just broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage, and was still young. Considering that Foundation Establishment cultivators had a lifespan of two hundred years, he had at least another one hundred sixty years to attempt Core Formation, so there was no need for him to be so hasty.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that Qin Sang would slack off.</p><p>Cultivating more quickly was naturally preferable. The sooner he could break through to the late Foundation Establishment stage, the more time he would have to attempt Core Formation and the greater his chances of success.</p><p>Qin Sang had come to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to cultivate the "Yuan Shen Nourishing the Sword Chapter."</p><p>He only needed to find a quiet cave in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield where he could hunt Cloud Beasts and then cultivate step-by-step. There was no need to risk life or limb.</p><p>As for the important tasks of searching for spirit medicine to restore his foundation, investigating Elder Qingzhu's whereabouts, and gathering spirit wood to upgrade the Ebony Wood Sword, they were not urgent.</p><p>The damage to his foundation only seemed to have affected his combat power. After breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang had not noticed any major interference with his cultivating. It remained to be seen whether he would face any obstacles when breaking through again. He would wait until he reached the mid-Foundation Establishment stage before confirming.</p><p>Elder Qingzhu's whereabouts were also not urgent as Core Formation was still too distant for Qin Sang.</p><p>The Ebony Wood Sword was a treasure material. Even if it could not withstand a second killing talisman, the difference would not be too great.</p><p>Qin Sang could cultivate while also familiarizing himself with the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and then investigate and search slowly.</p><p>If he could easily obtain something, he would naturally not let it pass. But if he encountered danger, he would cultivate steadily and wait until his own strength increased before considering it.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang secretly decided not to accompany Yu Daiyue. He said diplomatically, "Senior Brother Yu, the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is fraught with danger. My strength is weak and I fear I will only hold you back…"</p><p>Qin Sang's words were true. Others may not know him, but Yu Daiyue did.</p><p>Yu Daiyue understood Qin Sang's intentions and did not try to persuade him any further. The two chatted for a while longer, then sat down cross-legged and waited silently.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze without revealing his thoughts. He had noticed that there was always a lingering sadness between Yu Daiyue's brows.</p><p>Qin Sang had deliberately tried to steer the conversation toward the aftermath of the underground cave incident, but Yu Daiyue had intentionally avoided the topic. However, Qin Sang had still sensed a hint of resentment in Yu Daiyue's tone.</p><p>Could Yu Daiyue have been reprimanded because of Li Zai's death?</p><p>Qin Sang considered this and found it quite possible. He himself had been let off too easily because, like Li Zai, he had been invited by the organizers to assist.</p><p>If Li Zai's master, Uncle Feng Ming, had insisted on pursuing the matter, the organizers would definitely have come under heavy pressure. With Senior Sister Qingting dead, all the pressure had fallen on Yu Daiyue.</p><p>Yu Daiyue was not respected by his master and had no one to help him mediate. It was unknown what sacrifices he had to make to get through that period.</p><p>He must have been in an extremely difficult situation.</p><p>Venturing into the Ancient Immortal Battlefield was probably a last resort.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. In the cultivation world, strength was the only law!</p><p>He himself was uncertain about his own future, so he could not help Yu Daiyue. He could only put those thoughts behind him and pretend he had not noticed anything. He closed his eyes and sat in meditation.</p><p>...</p><p>"Greetings, Uncle Che…"</p><p>"Greetings, Master…"</p><p>A chorus of voices startled Qin Sang. He opened his eyes after meditating and saw that the small plaza in front of the Palace of the Sect Master was already packed with people.</p><p>Earlier, Sect Master Yu had come to gather them and announce some matters about entering Xuanlan Pass.</p><p>But now, a strange cultivator had appeared in front of the Palace of the Sect Master at some point. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, while Sect Master Yu stood respectfully beside him.</p><p>The person seems to be around thirty, with a strange look, a high nose and deep eyes. He’s wearing a white Taoist robe, with a small red gourd, about the size of a palm, hanging at his waist. Standing there, he shows a sense of being out of the world. Meanwhile, there is a faint yet compelling aura around him, making people couldn’t help but feel the need to pay respect and worship him. Qin Sang doesn’t sense any fluctuations of power coming from him, so he looks like a mortal to the naked eyes. However, the people before Qin Sang have all knelt down to the ground, including those at the Foundation Establishment period.</p><p>Uncle Che!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart skips a beat and his gaze lands on the red gourd. It’s no wonder it looks so familiar, isn’t this the Red Dust Gourd that Qin Sang once entered?</p><p>This person is Che Yutao, a Gold Core Cultivator of Mount Shaohua.</p><p>He actually hangs a magic treasure at his waist…</p><p>Qin Sang mumbles to himself for a few seconds, and immediately greets Che Yutao without hesitation, calling him uncle.</p><p>It’s not enough for them to defend Xuanguan Pass only with these Foundation Establishment Cultivators. It’s said that the Gold Core Cultivators from Mount Shaohua will take turns to help defend the pass, and it seems that Che Yutao is the one this time. It’s certainly a safe trip with the leadership of a Gold Core Cultivator.</p><p>面对 the greetings from everyone, Che Yutao doesn’t show any fluctuation on his face, he just casually glances over them and says, “It’s time. People who want to go to the battle field, enter the magic ship now. I’ll take you to the Shangyuan Palace of Pure Serenity.”</p><p>Without waiting for him to finish talking, a huge shadow suddenly hovers over them, and they all look up in shock. A giant magic ship is seen floating in the sky, which appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>The magic ship looks like a mortal building, with its two ends slightly upwards and a dragon head carved on the front, majestic and magnificent. Streamers on the ship are flying in the wind, and the clouds are filled with colorful lights. It’s exquisite and turns out to be a magic treasure!</p><p>Even daily transportation is a magic treasure. Is this the Gold Core Cultivator?</p><p>Qin Sang looks up with envy in his heart. His faith in pursuing a higher cultivation realm becomes stronger and firmer.</p><p>After Che Yutao finishes speaking, a few cloud steps fall from the building ship. People get excited and enter the magic ship along the cloud steps. Qin Sang follows them and enters the ship.</p><p>After all of them enter, Che Yutao’s body suddenly fades away and disappears into thin air.</p><p>The magic ship trembles slightly and suddenly shrinks, becoming as small as a shuttle. It silently flies away, leaving only a light breeze which shakes the treetops.</p><p>Principal Yu stands there and bows respectfully for a long while before straightening his body.</p><p>(It’s time to change the scene, sort out and modify the outline.</p><p>With the development of the plot, many sub-plots and foreshadowing need to be concluded. It’s a huge challenge to my capability.</p><p>I’ll do my best.</p><p>I’ll resume the two-update schedule. You all know I’m very honest. I’ll post as much as I can finish. Don’t wait for the update at midnight from now on.)</p>
