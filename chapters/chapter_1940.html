<h1>Chapter 1931: The Hunt</h1><p>Vermilion Bird, having spotted something intriguing, danced with excitement.</p><p>Little Five lowered her head, following Vermilion Bird's gaze.</p><p>Below the precipice lay a lush jungle.</p><p>Ancient trees reached for the heavens, their crowns interlocking to form an impenetrable canopy, from which thick, python-like vines occasionally dangled.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>‘Tweet… tweet…’</p><p>‘Flutter!’</p><p>This was a paradise for birds. Nests dotted the canopy, while rustling sounds from below hinted at beasts roaming the undergrowth.</p><p>However, the roars of ferocious predators were almost nonexistent. Creatures like jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards were likely scarce.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, a narrow path, carved through thorns and vegetation, bore the marks of human passage.</p><p>This wasn't truly the deep mountains.</p><p>The path, leading from the outside world, vanished at the mountain's base.</p><p>Overgrown with weeds, it was easily missed unless examined closely. Few seemed to tread this path, likely forged by hunters venturing into the mountains.</p><p>Following the path outwards, the mountain slopes gradually flattened. Qin Sang and his companions had noticed a mortal village in that direction.</p><p>Beyond this mountain lay the true primeval forest, untouched by humans, where beasts roamed freely in increasing numbers.</p><p>Vermilion Bird's attention was fixed on the path.</p><p>As the sun climbed higher, casting its rays upon the forest, a figure emerged at the path's other end.</p><p>It was a youth, seemingly fourteen or fifteen years old, clad in coarse hemp clothing and straw sandals, clearly from a poor family. Yet, his clothes were clean, and his brow held a resolute air, tinged with a scholarly refinement uncommon among ordinary folk.</p><p>He walked with a spring in his step along the rugged path, one hand clutching a bundle of hemp rope, the other a sharpened steel spike.</p><p>The hands gripping the rope and spike had prominent knuckles, a sign of martial training.</p><p>Hunters often practiced martial arts; otherwise, even entering the mountains would be difficult, let alone hunting beasts.</p><p>Whether the youth was gathering firewood or hunting remained unclear. He was remarkably young to venture into the mountains alone.</p><p>‘Rustle… rustle… rustle…’</p><p>He was no immortal cultivator, nor a martial artist capable of walking on walls or treading snow without a trace. As he walked, his body brushed against the tall grass, inevitably creating a rustling sound.</p><p>The youth's brow remained furrowed in caution, constantly wary of dangers lurking in the undergrowth. He paused frequently to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Soon, a mountain rose to the east of the path, casting both the path and the youth into shadow.</p><p>It became apparent that he wasn't hunting.  He slowed his pace, carefully scrutinizing the mountainside to his right.</p><p>This mountain lacked the majestic grandeur of the one where Qin Sang resided.</p><p>Its slopes alternated between steep and gentle, covered in dense vegetation. Sheer cliffs rose hundreds of feet high in some places, while gentle slopes allowed easy climbing in others.</p><p>The youth seemed to be searching for something, shaking his head occasionally and pausing in thought.</p><p>Finally, his eyes lit up as he spotted a terrain that matched his expectations. He hurried towards it.</p><p>His destination was a cliff face, standing about a hundred feet above the path, beyond a gentle slope.</p><p>Just as he started to climb, he paused, glancing at the sun's position. He marked a line on the ground with his steel spike, then surveyed the slope. Gathering his strength, he leaped powerfully, landing steadily on a rock. Repeating this several times, he reached the cliff face and looked upwards.</p><p>The cliff itself wasn't exceptionally tall, its face smooth and covered with patches of grass.</p><p>A tree grew stubbornly upwards from a crevice, its trunk entwined with vines that nearly reached the ground.</p><p>The cliff wasn't wide, flanked by earthen slopes. Another tree, covered in vines, grew close to the cliff on the right side.</p><p>The youth recognized the vines as incredibly strong, capable of replacing ropes.</p><p>He quickly scanned the cliff face, his eyes flickering in thought, his gaze finally settling on the top.</p><p>A dark shape was visible from below – a large boulder, partially protruding, its uneven, rounded shape raising concerns about its stability.</p><p>The boulder was the youth's target. Employing the same leaping technique, he climbed the earthen slope to the cliff top. He pressed against the boulder, testing its firmness. It remained unmoved.</p><p>He applied more force, sensing a slight wobble. A flicker of joy crossed his face as he, disregarding the danger, leaned over the cliff edge to examine where the boulder met the cliff, attempting to insert his steel spike.</p><p>He continued to climb up and down, measuring and comparing with his spike and rope.</p><p>Lost in his work, he suddenly remembered something, glancing back at the line he’d drawn.  Seeing the mountain’s shadow about to cross the line, his expression tightened. He quickly hid the spike and rope in the grass and ran back down.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Vermilion Bird and Little Five, captivated by the scene, were surprised to see the youth fleeing as if pursued by a predator.</p><p>“He'll definitely be back tomorrow,” Vermilion Bird declared confidently.</p><p>The following day, at the same hour, the youth returned as predicted.</p><p>This time, he brought a shovel. Retrieving the rope and spike from the grass, he resumed his work.</p><p>As before, when the time came, he left without hesitation.</p><p>With Qin Sang preoccupied with restoring the Thunder Altar, the youth became a source of amusement for Vermilion Bird and Little Five during their idle hours.</p><p>Vermilion Bird even tried to wager with Little Five on the youth’s purpose, but Little Five declined to participate.</p><p>This didn't diminish Vermilion Bird’s interest.  She eagerly awaited sunrise each day.</p><p>However, to preserve their curiosity, neither of them used their divine abilities to investigate or pry into the youth’s intentions.</p><p>Each time he returned, the youth brought new items.</p><p>A wire mesh wrapped with iron nails, their unusual color suggesting they were poisoned.</p><p>A wooden shaft, tipped with sharpened iron, forming a spear.</p><p>Various mechanical contraptions.</p><p>These intricate mechanisms, showcasing the ingenuity of hunters, were designed for setting traps.</p><p>The youth experimented for over ten days before selecting the most suitable mechanism.</p><p>"See! I guessed it on the first day! He's setting a trap!"</p><p>Vermilion Bird gloated, triumphant.</p><p>But it was puzzling. Such meticulous preparations suggested he intended to hunt a ferocious beast, yet no such creatures existed nearby. The deep mountain beasts were blocked by the mountain beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>The youth, remarkably patient, toiled for over a month before finally completing the trap.</p><p>On the final day, he meticulously checked each mechanism, carefully clearing any traces, and even covering the unavoidable scratches on the rock with moss.</p><p>He didn’t leave any bait, nor did he lead any beasts to the trap. When the time came, he simply returned home.</p><p>"This kid hasn't hidden it perfectly. I'll give him a hand."</p><p>Vermilion Bird, never one to miss a spectacle, chuckled mischievously and flapped her wings.</p><p>For three days, the youth was absent, leaving Vermilion Bird restless and tempted to fly to the village and drag him out to ask what he was doing.</p><p>On the fourth day, the sun rose.</p><p>The youth finally reappeared.</p><p>His steps seemed heavier than before, though his pace remained brisk.</p><p>This time, he passed the trap without stopping, heading straight for their mountain.</p><p>For the first time in days, the youth ventured into the deep mountain.</p><p>The dense foliage couldn't obstruct Vermilion Bird and Little Five’s view as they watched him move nimbly through the trees like a monkey.</p><p>With a light crossbow strapped to his right arm, aided by the trap and his bolts, he enjoyed a successful hunt.</p><p>Descending the mountain, his bag filled with several birds, he also carried a small deer.</p><p>Back on the path, he glanced at the sun. It was almost time for his usual departure.</p><p>This time, however, he didn't return home. Instead, he carried his game to the trap, setting up a campfire at a pre-selected spot on the earthen slope north of the cliff. He took out a bird, gutted it, and placed it over the fire to roast.</p><p>The plump bird quickly sizzled, releasing a tempting aroma.</p><p>The youth’s next action was surprising.  Ignoring the enticing smell, he drew a short blade from his waist, positioned it against his left arm, and, wincing, pierced his skin, carving a deep wound.</p><p>Flesh parted, and crimson blood immediately stained his clothes, its metallic scent mingling with the roasting meat.</p><p>‘Hiss!’</p><p>The youth sucked in a breath, tore a strip of cloth, and, biting one end, bandaged his wound.</p><p>The bleeding persisted, quickly soaking the cloth.</p><p>His face paled from blood loss. He untied his waterskin, took a large gulp of wine, and then focused on roasting the meat.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>A white flash appeared on the mountaintop where the youth sat, vanishing just as quickly.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>Vermilion Bird, observing the scene, lowered her voice in excitement, her eyes gleaming.</p><p>"No wonder! He's hunting a demon! This kid has some guts!"</p><p>Little Five's eyes also flickered.</p><p>The white flash hadn't escaped their notice. It was a Foundation Establishment stage White Weasel demon.</p><p>While human martial artists who reached the Xiantian realm possessed considerable power, potentially capable of battling low-level Qi Refining cultivators, this youth clearly wasn’t one of those elite warriors.  Daring to lure and kill a White Weasel demon was incredibly audacious.</p><p>The White Weasel, moving stealthily through the undergrowth without a sound, approached the youth from behind and suddenly pounced.</p><p>The youth, seemingly engrossed in roasting meat, was actually on high alert.  But the White Weasel was too fast. By the time he sensed the rush of air, it was too late to dodge.</p><p>The White Weasel closed in instantly, its sharp claws aimed at the youth’s back.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of metal on metal rang out.</p><p>Beneath the torn fabric lay a piece of iron.</p><p>Based on the bodies of previous victims and the accounts of survivors, the youth had deduced the demon's preference for attacking from behind, tearing out its victims' hearts. He had prepared the iron plate as protection.</p><p>However, the White Weasel's claws were incredibly sharp, piercing the iron!</p><p>A sharp pain shot through the youth's back, accompanied by a tremendous force that struck him through the iron. He instinctively lunged forward.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>Facing the cliff, he tumbled headfirst, along with the roasting rack, into the sand below.</p><p>Pain wracked his body, his organs jarring.</p><p>Incredibly, even as he fell, the youth managed to twist his body, aiming the crossbow on his right arm behind him.</p><p>Having failed to kill its prey with a single blow, the White Weasel shrieked.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>The sound was piercing.</p><p>Simultaneously, the White Weasel, transformed into a white blur, leaped down after the youth, continuing its pursuit.  With a twitch of its fur, it released a cloud of white smoke that enveloped the youth.</p><p>Anticipating this tactic, the youth had already closed his eyes and held his breath.</p><p>Despite his thorough preparations, the shriek resonated in his head, leaving him slightly dazed. He had even stuffed his ears with cotton.</p><p>The white smoke and the screech were terrifying demonic techniques.  The most skilled hunter in the village had died helplessly against them, leaving the villagers terrified.</p><p>Fortunately, this White Weasel never appeared in the morning. The villagers only dared to venture out then, sealing their doors and windows after midday.  No one dared to hunt the demon.</p><p>These precautions had some effect. The youth didn’t lose consciousness immediately. With sheer willpower, he raised his left arm and fired the crossbow.</p><p>As the White Weasel lunged, about to tear apart his left arm, the iron plate strapped to his forearm provided some protection, but it was still ripped open, leaving a deep gash.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Three crossbow bolts shot out, their tips gleaming with a bluish light, tipped with poison.</p><p>Forced to evade, the White Weasel twisted its body at impossible angles, dodging the bolts unscathed.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>The youth crashed heavily to the ground, coughing up blood.</p><p>The White Weasel gazed greedily at its vibrant prey, leaping down.</p><p>At that moment, some unseen mechanism was triggered, and the sand erupted.</p><p>Two bent branches, one from each of the flanking trees, snapped straight with a loud ‘thwack.’</p><p>The vines hanging from the branches were yanked from the sand.</p><p>Tied tightly to a wire mesh, the vines sprung upwards, throwing up a cloud of sand. In a blink, a net formed, nearly ensnaring the White Weasel.</p><p>Being a demon, its reflexes were lightning fast. It clung to the edge of the net and leaped high.</p><p>However, the net trap had a second stage. A vine, pressed against the cliff face, was pulled, dislodging the stones wedged against the boulder. The massive rock tumbled down from the cliff top.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The wind ruffled the White Weasel’s fur.</p><p>Enveloped by the boulder’s shadow, the White Weasel knew that even with its cultivation, being crushed beneath the rock would shatter its bones.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>The White Weasel shrieked in fury.</p><p>‘Puff!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>In the nick of time, the White Weasel hurriedly expelled a cloud of white smoke, momentarily hindering the boulder's descent.  Its front claws gripped the boulder's edge, and with a powerful kick, it performed a somersault, narrowly escaping.</p><p>But the trap wasn’t finished.  As the boulder fell, a third mechanism activated. A click echoed from the ground, and cold gleams emerged from the undergrowth.</p><p>Five poisoned spears from each side, taking advantage of the White Weasel’s airborne vulnerability, shot out.</p><p>‘Swish! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The poisoned spears, propelled with the force of crossbows, flew with lightning speed.</p><p>The ten spears crisscrossed, leaving the White Weasel no escape. Its furious shriek turned into a terrified squeal.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A trail of demonic blood stained the ground.</p><p>A spear pierced the White Weasel, pinning it to a tree trunk, the shaft still quivering.</p><p>“Magnificent!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird clapped her wings excitedly. “Pity, this little weasel has the aura of a cultivator. Someone must own it. This boy's in trouble now." (End of Chapter)</p>
