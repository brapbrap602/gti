<h1>Chapter 1239: Moon in the Water</h1><p>Dongyang Bo, clad in brocade robes and wearing a vajra, walked forward with his hands behind his back.</p><p>The vajra vibrated frequently, each tremor emitting a faint, shadowy image of the treasure.</p><p>These shadows, unlike the main treasure, were dim and inert.  Blood shadows, unable to dodge, were instantly trapped, their struggles futile.</p><p>With a gentle tremor of the shadowy image, the blood shadow within would completely vanish.</p><p>This was his life-bound treasure, nurtured and refined for years, now a top-tier magical artifact with limitless applications.</p><p>Dongyang Bo, relaxed and composed, ignored the surrounding blood shadows, focusing on Gongliang Yu's movements, a faint smile playing on his lips.</p><p>They continued deeper.</p><p>The blood shadows grew stronger, even the Spirit Embryo puppet couldn't instantly kill them with a single blow.</p><p>Gongliang Yu sensed the continuous depletion of the Azure Spirit Light within his spirit, realizing that once it was gone, he'd have to withdraw the puppet.</p><p>At the bottom of the blood river, relying solely on his own abilities, progress was impossible!</p><p>Gongliang Yu, his expression anxious, urged the Spirit Embryo puppet towards the riverbed, feeling the pressure intensify.</p><p>The blood shadows, nurtured by the blood river for countless years, possessed not only bizarre abilities but also grew more difficult to kill the stronger they became.  Even when severed in two, they would simply become two separate blood shadows, fearless in death.</p><p>The Spirit Embryo puppet, its surface flickering with numerous talismans, revealed its true power.</p><p>Various spiritual talismans flashed across its body.</p><p>Each represented a different power: water talismans, fire talismans, lightning talismans, demonic spirit talismans, and countless others, all refined and integrated into the puppet.</p><p>The Spirit Embryo puppet's techniques were diverse, wielding wind, fire, lightning, and thunder in a relentless assault against the blood shadows.</p><p>After descending an unknown distance, Gongliang Yu finally spotted something other than blood shadows.</p><p>Within the blood mist below, a blood-red stalagmite emerged. Its sharp tip, stained crimson by the mist, shimmered like a blood diamond.</p><p>Upon seeing the stalagmite, Gongliang Yu rejoiced, realizing he'd reached the riverbed.</p><p>He immediately plunged downward, soon landing on solid ground.</p><p>The ground, constantly battered and refined by the blood mist, was incredibly hard.</p><p>Without pausing to survey his surroundings, Gongliang Yu rushed forward, as more and more blood shadows were drawn to them, encircling them, increasing the pressure on the Spirit Embryo puppet.</p><p>The ground was uneven, crisscrossed by ravines and sharp stalagmites.</p><p>The good news was, aside from the ubiquitous blood shadow spirits, they hadn't encountered any other monsters.</p><p>The man and his puppet pressed onward, heedless of attracting more blood shadows – they already had enough, one more wouldn't matter.</p><p>The Spirit Embryo puppet diligently protected Gongliang Yu, who remained unharmed.</p><p>However, seeing the sheer number of blood shadows, Gongliang Yu's face paled, praying to find the Blood Ginseng quickly and escape this perilous place.</p><p>After a frantic dash, a ravine suddenly appeared ahead.</p><p>This ravine, almost perfectly straight, stretched from one bank to the other, cutting across the entire riverbed. It was a thousand zhang wide and bottomless, its edges remarkably smooth.</p><p>Ravines were common at the river's bottom, but one of this size and orientation was extremely rare, its depths unknown.</p><p>"That's it!"</p><p>Gongliang Yu exclaimed inwardly, unable to hide his elation.</p><p>The Blood Ginseng didn't grow within the ravine, but the ravine was a clear landmark.  According to the information he had, once he saw the ravine, the herb would be nearby.</p><p>The senior cultivator who had entered before had found the Blood Ginseng immature, and thus had chosen to leave it, rather than harvesting it prematurely.</p><p>Gongliang Yu and his Spirit Embryo puppet leaped across the ravine and continued their advance. Soon, they detected unusual movement in the blood mist ahead.</p><p>Even before approaching, a strange pressure bore down on them.</p><p>Gongliang Yu staggered, his protective spiritual armor violently vibrating, his face changing drastically. The pressure, of unknown origin, nearly shattered his armor.</p><p>Slowing his pace, he approached the anomalous area, discovering that the blood mist was far denser here, the ground sunken, resembling an underwater lake.</p><p>A strong crimson light emanated from the heart of the blood mist.</p><p>At the center of the light, a Blood Ginseng, its cap the size of a plate, swayed gently with the mist, seeming to float on the bloody water.</p><p>The plant was entirely blood-red, as if formed from congealed blood.</p><p>The mature plant had only one leaf, round as the full moon.  Its surface was smooth, save for a coin-sized protrusion in the center, skull-like and unsettling.</p><p>It was the legendary Blood Ginseng, a herb said to help cultivators achieve Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>"Finally…"</p><p>Catching sight of the Blood Ginseng from afar, Gong Liangyu's heart leaped, his breathing quickening.</p><p>The Blood Ginseng lacked the usual fragrant aroma of a spiritual herb. Gong Liangyu figured that any herb growing in this place would be lucky to avoid smelling of blood, let alone have a pleasant scent.  Any smell would be overwhelmed by the thick blood mist anyway.</p><p>The herb was right before him!</p><p>But they had attracted even more blood shadows.</p><p>Gong Liangyu glanced around quickly. He didn't see any spirit beast guarding the herb, and the senior cultivator hadn't mentioned one.</p><p>These blood shadows were hostile to all outsiders; no spirit beast could survive here, unless an exceptionally intelligent aberration existed among the blood shadow fiends.</p><p>He'd made such a commotion, yet the area around the Blood Ginseng remained undisturbed.  He estimated there were no beasts guarding it.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Gong Liangyu barked, two talismans shooting from his dantian.</p><p>One was the Heavenly Gang Blade Talisman, refined by him to its peak.</p><p>The other was a Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, familiar to Qin Sang, and with all nine dragon souls intact!</p><p>As for Qin Sang's talisman, Gong Liangyu, having reached the Nascent Soul stage, no longer needed it.  He'd given it to Li Yu Fu, since its origin was questionable. He instructed him not to use it normally, only for emergencies.</p><p>Dragon souls circled him, the Heavenly Gang Blade Talisman taking on its true form, tearing through the sucking force in front.</p><p>Gong Liangyu, fused with the two powerful talismans, followed closely behind his Nascent Soul puppet, repelling the blood shadows, and charging towards the Blood Ginseng.</p><p>Unexpectedly, halfway there, Gong Liangyu felt the pressure intensify, to the point he might not be able to withstand it.</p><p>The opportunity couldn't be missed.  No time for hesitation.</p><p>He made an instant decision, ordering his Nascent Soul puppet to proceed alone and collect the herb. He would then concentrate his talisman power, launching more talismans to buy himself some time against the blood shadows.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The dragon souls roared, the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman pushed to its limit.</p><p>The blade talisman instantly released countless blade lights.</p><p>Thunder, spirit fire, wooden vines, mountains…</p><p>One powerful talisman after another was unleashed without restraint.</p><p>Gong Liangyu maneuvered precariously, watching as his Nascent Soul puppet finally reached the Blood Ginseng, reaching out to grab it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it grasped at empty air!</p><p>The Blood Ginseng, like a moon in the water, shattered instantly.</p><p>Gong Liangyu's smile froze, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p>Then, he watched, dumbfounded, as the Blood Ginseng reformed.</p><p>As vibrant as before!</p><p>As hauntingly beautiful as ever!</p><p>Before Gong Liangyu could understand, a powerful aura erupted from behind, closing in on him in an instant.</p>
