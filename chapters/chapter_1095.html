<h1>Chapter 187 Soul Severing Blade</h1><p>The next moment, the Ancient Devil clone opened its massive maw, unleashing a demonic shriek. The piercing shriek could shatter stone and metal!  It seemed to resonate from within everyone’s souls, shaking their very core. No ordinary means could block it.</p><p>Having devoured Mo Qingzhu, the Ancient Devil clone howled at the heavens. It hovered in midair, arms outstretched, hair wildly flailing, the very image of a demon.</p><p>Hearing the shriek, the young man and woman’s faces paled. They cried out in agony, collapsing to the ground.  The protective barrier the old man had cast failed. Fortunately, the shriek wasn't directly aimed at them; they only heard its residual sound. Otherwise, they would have perished instantly. Even so, they were grievously injured, blood flowing from their seven orifices.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Primordial Spirit shone with golden light, revealing a golden Buddha.  The demonic shriek assaulted his Primordial Spirit, triggering the Jade Buddha to protect him from harm.</p><p>Witnessing the young duo's horrific state, Qin Sang shrewdly fell to the ground, feigning injury by severing several meridians and mimicking the bleeding from his seven orifices.  He wore a look of terror, his heart racing, eyes tightly shut.</p><p>Unnoticed, Qin Sang clutched a demonic banner.  Wisps of Nine Nether Demonic Fire, enveloped by his divine sense, were drawn into his body, converging within his Purple Mansion.  In this precarious moment, he was completely focused on cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique!</p><p>The lotus seed contained traces of Mou Laomo's residual essence, which couldn't be erased immediately. Qin Sang had to abandon the seed and cultivate the technique through sheer willpower.</p><p>The lotus seed's primary function was to contain the spiritual fire, shielding the cultivator from its destructive power, preventing the Primordial Spirit from being incinerated.  However, Qin Sang had the Jade Buddha's protection, rendering the seed unnecessary.</p><p>Had Mou Laomo witnessed this scene, he would have been dumbfounded, cursing Qin Sang as a madman.  When Mou Laomo refined the Winter Nether Cold Flame, he proceeded with utmost caution, enduring countless failures and nearly freezing his Primordial Spirit multiple times before finally succeeding.  Even he wouldn't dare trifle with the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang attempted to refine it into a Fire Seed on his first try! Without the Jade Buddha’s protection, Qin Sang would have been consumed by the flames.  Even with its protection, he endured immense pain. His Purple Mansion churned as if boiling, completely disrupted by the demonic fire.</p><p>The demonic fire was unruly and untamed.  Mastering the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique in such a short time was impossible. Qin Sang’s goal was merely to subdue a sliver of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, condensing it into the initial demonic seed.</p><p>Following the technique’s secrets, his Primordial Spirit embraced the demonic fire.  Relying on the Jade Buddha, he disregarded the burning pain and focused on guiding the fire, gradually forming the rudimentary shape of a fire seed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Ancient Devil clone suddenly attacked, turning the tide.  The clone’s aura fluctuated violently.  Accompanying its shriek, an invisible wave rippled through the void.</p><p>Instantly, Ling Zhuzi and the others felt a surge of alarm, their faces draining of color. A translucent spirit blade materialized before their foreheads, followed by a splitting pain in their heads. Caught off guard, they screamed, their bodies trembling uncontrollably as they collapsed.</p><p>Cries of pain echoed. Clutching their heads, their faces contorted in agony, they endured unimaginable torment. Their spells and magical treasures were useless.</p><p>The Ancient Devil clone had unleashed the Soul Severing Blade, a devastating attack.  The group of experts, unable to withstand even this single blow, were instantly crippled.</p><p>Surveying the fallen figures like lambs to the slaughter, the Ancient Devil clone laughed maniacally. Using the Soul Severing Blade came at a cost. Its aura weakened significantly, its power diminished.  However, it was still far stronger than Ling Zhuzi and the others.</p><p>With a flash, the Ancient Devil clone targeted the Nine-Lives Profound Turtle. The turtle convulsed in pain, utterly defenseless. It could only watch as the clone approached. Then, it felt a tightening grip, immobilizing it completely.</p><p>"Aagh!"  The Nine-Lives Profound Turtle reverted to its true form, struggling desperately. The Ancient Devil clone punched through its abdomen, sending blood spraying as it let out a final, agonizing shriek.</p><p>The massive turtle was like a toy in the clone's hands, effortlessly manipulated. Its flesh became a mangled mess, bones shattered. Following in the Dragon King’s footsteps, the Nine-Lives Profound Turtle's essence and flesh were extracted by the clone and offered to the blood coffin.</p><p>Empowered by the turtle's essence, the Blood River Formation surged in power.  The coffin regained some of its crimson glow, and the blood-colored sword aura intensified.</p><p>In an instant, the Nine-Lives Profound Turtle met a gruesome end. The others watched in despair, a chilling sense of dread filling their hearts. These apex cultivators, wielding immense power in the outside world, were all destined to die here, becoming sacrifices for the Ancient Devil’s resurrection.</p><p>"Hmm?"  After crushing the turtle, the Ancient Devil clone was about to target its next victim, Southern Return Fairy, when it sensed an unusual fluctuation.  It abruptly turned towards a corner of the crimson crystalline wall.</p><p>There, clinging motionless to the wall, was a withered-leaf cicada the size of a fist – Fang Laomo. Compared to a human form, the cicada was inconspicuous, easily overlooked.</p><p>However, Fang Laomo had previously displayed considerable power, causing the Ancient Devil clone significant trouble. He, too, hadn’t escaped the clone’s attack. As a Gu cultivator, his Primordial Spirit seemed more vulnerable than the others'.  His aura flickered faintly; he was near death.</p><p>Then, something unexpected happened.  Clinging to the crimson wall, the withered-leaf cicada’s abdomen suddenly split open.  A spirit cicada, no larger than a human thumb, emerged.  The spirit cicada was a translucent emerald green, its thin wings dotted with starlight.</p><p>Even the Ancient Devil clone paused, stunned by this astonishing sight.</p><p>"Star-Winged Cicada!  A Twin Gu?"  Great Witch Zhu exclaimed in disbelief.  She and Fang Laomo were both from the Witch Clan, yet she was unaware that he possessed not only the withered-leaf cicada but also another lifebound Gu insect. Moreover, the Twin Gu had different bloodlines.</p><p>One was of the withered-leaf cicada lineage, possessing sonic abilities that could catch opponents off guard.  The other was a Star-Winged Cicada, known for its exceptional遁术, a form of instantaneous movement or teleportation.</p><p>Both were rare and highly sought-after insects, but the methods to cultivate them were lost.  In the Witch God Continent, Qin Sang had encountered a Witch Clan cultivator with a Twin Gu, Cui Xuanzi, the leader of the Five Insect Sect.  However, one of Cui Xuanzi’s Gu insects had stopped developing after reaching a certain stage.</p><p>Fang Laomo’s Twin Gu seemed different.</p><p>As the Star-Winged Cicada emerged, the withered-leaf cicada rapidly withered, like a shed skin, as if all its essence had been absorbed by the Star-Winged Cicada.  The Star-Winged Cicada still appeared frail, yet a small portion of its body had already merged with the crimson wall!</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>This was yesterday's chapter.</p><p>Writing on my phone on the train, today's two chapters will be a bit later.</p><p>Written in haste, no time for proofreading, will refine tomorrow.</p>
