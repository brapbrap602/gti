<h1>Chapter 770: Ghost Land</h1><p>After the initial excitement, Qin Sang calmed down and fell into deep thought.</p><p>Refining the Ten Yama Banners wasn't something that could be done on a whim, at least not now.</p><p>The refining process was divided into three steps.</p><p>First, the Profound Iron Pillars needed to be smelted into banner poles.</p><p>This process required an extremely complex spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned how to set up the array from Yi Tiannie. Aside from various spirit materials, there was another demanding requirement: high-grade or top-grade spirit stones were needed to power the array.</p><p>He didn't dare to dream of top-grade spirit stones, but high-grade ones were also extremely rare. He only had two, which he needed to reserve for using the ancient teleportation array.</p><p>He had to ensure he always had two high-grade spirit stones on hand.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's decades of experience, high-grade spirit stones were even rarer in the Boundless Sea Region than in the Small Cold Region.</p><p>The higher the quality of the spirit stone, the greater its use, and major powers could never have too many.</p><p>In the Small Cold Region, when ancient cultivator ruins within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield appeared, the first cultivators to enter, if lucky, could find a few. A small portion of these would circulate outside, offering a chance to acquire them if one searched diligently.</p><p>High-grade spirit stones in the Boundless Sea Region were basically mined from spirit stone mines. The few existing mines were already occupied by major powers. Any stones unearthed were immediately collected and hoarded, making them virtually impossible to obtain on the market.</p><p>Second, the banner cloths needed to be refined.</p><p>Back then, Patriarch Kui Yin searched far and wide for secret methods and finally devised a vicious scheme: imprisoning countless living souls, condensing the purest soul essence, refining it into threads, and weaving it into banner cloths!</p><p>For this, Patriarch Kui Yin harmed an untold number of people.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to refine even more Ten Yama Banners than Patriarch Kui Yin. If he followed the same method, he would truly become a notorious murderer.</p><p>He couldn't bring himself to kill countless innocent people, most of whom would be mortals, for no reason.</p><p>Finally, once the complete Ten Yama Banners were refined, he could begin to subdue the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and seal it within the banners.</p><p>The process of refining the banner poles was very complex and had extremely high requirements for the refiner. Even if he had all the materials now, he couldn't carry out the refining here.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire was right in front of him,</p><p>but the Ten Yama Banners were still a distant dream, like flowers in a mirror or the moon in water.</p><p>Even if he found high-grade spirit stones and soul threads and refined the banners, he would still need to wait until the next opening of the Seven Killing Palace to enter and subdue the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang gripped the Profound Iron Pillar in his hand, then stored it in his Thousand Jun Ring. His gaze returned to its usual calmness.</p><p>Although he couldn't obtain this powerful banner array now, he at least saw a glimmer of hope.</p><p>His cultivation wasn't weak in the cultivation world. He believed that if he spent decades searching for high-grade spirit stones, he would eventually find them. The soul threads were the most troublesome, but there might be other ways besides killing.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered what he needed to do next. He still planned to search for the ancient teleportation array and return to the Small Cold Region. This didn't conflict with refining the Ten Yama Banners.</p><p>With the ancient teleportation array, he could freely travel between the two regions.</p><p>If he could return to the Small Cold Region, gathering materials would be easier.</p><p>"This is a top-grade magical treasure!" Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>In the decades since he formed his Gold Core, the strongest magical treasure he had seen was only mid-grade. He hadn't even seen a high-grade one. It was said that even Nascent Soul Patriarchs considered top-grade magical treasures to be supreme treasures.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how terrifying the power of a top-grade magical treasure would be, and how much it would enhance his strength.</p><p>No matter what, he had to refine this banner array!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang placed the Ten Yama Banners and the Nine Illusion Orchid on equal footing as must-have items.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>He was curious about how this demonic fire was born and why it remained in such a narrow crevice.</p><p>He noticed that the Nine Nether Demonic Fire floated in the canyon, and there were layers of ancient restrictions on both sides of the cliff and above, which clearly indicated danger. He wondered if these restrictions were confining the demonic fire.</p><p>Back then, when Patriarch Kui Yin saw the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, he also found the broken Profound Iron Pillars.</p><p>Qin Sang searched carefully but didn't find any similar treasures.</p><p>However, something unusual caught his attention.</p><p>He pressed himself against the cliff face and discovered that there seemed to be a large space behind the Nine Nether Demonic Fire. Strangely, what floated in that space wasn't purple mist, but a grayish-white mist, which appeared extremely eerie.</p><p>"This mistâ€¦"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, a surprised expression appearing on his face.</p><p>Then, he tentatively took a step forward, attempting to pass through the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and enter the space behind it.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire floated in the air. Its main body didn't fill the entire canyon, seemingly leaving space to pass through. But these spaces were filled with the aura of the demonic fire, making them extremely dangerous.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire could assault the soul. If anyone approached it, their primordial spirit would face a direct attack, something even Nascent Soul Patriarchs wouldn't dare to risk. If the demonic fire went berserk, it would mean certain death.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, observing it carefully.</p><p>He had the Jade Buddha's protection, which stabilized his soul.</p><p>Most importantly, he also had control over the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, albeit rudimentary. Still, it was of the same origin, allowing him to summon the demonic fire to shield him while concealing his aura.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Qin Sang felt that his chances of passing through were high and that he could take the risk.</p><p>The reason he was determined to explore the space behind the fire was that the grayish-white mist looked familiar, resembling the ghost mist he had encountered when passing through the Immortal Graves in the Violet Micro Palace.</p><p>However, the mist here was thinner than in the Immortal Graves.</p><p>Places filled with ghost mist bred resentful souls, evil spirits, and other ghostly beings. Refining these ghostly beings could also produce soul threads, solving his biggest problem.</p><p>These ghostly beings had been trapped here for who knew how long, muddleheaded and having long since lost their sentience.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banners required a massive amount of soul threads, and it would be nearly impossible to find such a large gathering of ghostly beings in the outside world.</p><p>The formation of such a ghost land was always due to special circumstances.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed close to the stone wall and observed for a long time. He noticed that the space behind the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was calm, with the grayish-white mist flowing slowly. He needed to enter and see if there were any ghostly beings inside.</p><p>He didn't act rashly and enter directly. Instead, he summoned the Flying Night Fiend first, preparing to use it as a scout.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Fire didn't look like a seal, but Qin Sang still felt it was best to be cautious, worried about whether there might be a Ghost King or similar beings in such a place.</p><p>The Flying Night Fiend was a refined corpse, of the same kind as ghostly beings, making it perfectly suited for exploration.</p><p>Having shielded Qin Sang from harm, the Flying Night Fiend had been pierced by the Violet Nether Bead, leaving several large holes and suffering significant injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang had instructed the Flying Night Fiend to devour Earthly Yin Qi and recover on its own, as he hadn't had the time to help it due to the frequent unexpected events.</p><p>After summoning the Flying Night Fiend, Qin Sang sat down cross-legged and took out the Lesser Yin Magnetic Bottle. He then channeled his true essence into the Flying Night Fiend's body to help it heal quickly.</p><p>Full recovery in such a short time was impossible.</p><p>When the Flying Night Fiend's injuries had healed by about sixty to seventy percent, Qin Sang stopped.</p><p>The wounds on its body were almost invisible, and its corpse qi could circulate freely, enough to handle most situations.</p>
