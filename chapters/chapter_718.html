<h1>Chapter 710: The Hunt</h1><p>While flying, Qin Sang detected two more powerful demons, both inexplicably drawn to the strange cold flame phenomenon, converging from distant seas.</p><p>Knowing that more demons would be attracted, Qin Sang dared not linger and immediately fled towards the charted route, finally reaching a marked island late at night, rejoining the planned path.</p><p>This location was far from the cold flame; from this direction, there were no visible abnormalities. However, en route, Qin Sang vaguely heard demonic roars behind him—seemingly a conflict amongst the beasts, whether due to the cold flame or some surviving treasure on the island, he couldn't tell.</p><p>“The cold flame…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, believing its power to be beyond the control of these Core Formation demons, just as it was beyond his own. He harbored no ambitions to control it.</p><p>Reclaiming his gaze, Qin Sang checked his sea chart to confirm his direction.</p><p>He had two choices: retrace his steps (the sea chart's route was proven accurate in the first half of their journey), or press on across the Thousand Demons Sea.</p><p>Having reached the heart of the Thousand Demons Sea, turning back felt unsatisfactory. After brief consideration, Qin Sang chose to continue following the chart.</p><p>This was a rare opportunity.  The cold flame had lured the powerful demons from the sea's depths, leaving their lairs unguarded.  Even if the chart was inaccurate, the danger was significantly reduced.</p><p>Without delay, Qin Sang meditated on the island, restoring himself to peak condition before departing.</p><p>Three days later, he was reassured. The chart was accurate.  However, exercising caution, Qin Sang proceeded slowly, taking nearly a month to cross the Thousand Demons Sea.</p><p>…</p><p>Vast blue waves met the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a massive island, hundreds of miles across—feeling almost like dry land.  Half the island was jungle; the other half, towering mountains.</p><p>Remarkably, the island was unclaimed by demons, teeming with life.  Aside from humans, birds, beasts, and insects all lived peacefully.  The coastal mountains were barren rock, with only sparse vegetation clinging to the crevices.</p><p>On the eastern side, the mountains extended to the coast, jutting out into the sea to form a sharp, cape-like point.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop this cape.</p><p>The wind howled today!</p><p>“Continuing from this island will take me out of the Thousand Demons Sea,” Qin Sang observed the unusually calm sea, recalling his gathered information. “They say the waters ahead are safer than the Thousand Demons Sea, with fewer powerful demons.  Of course, it’s still far more dangerous than the areas around Huntian Island. Cultivators strong enough to traverse the Thousand Demons Sea and reach this place are few.  But the Que Firebird is said to inhabit these waters…”</p><p>Having overcome many hardships to arrive here, a smile graced Qin Sang’s face.</p><p>Barring unforeseen circumstances, Qin Sang planned to remain here for over a decade after crafting the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, avoiding the storm of the impending two-race war.  He would only return once compelled by circumstances, assessing the situation then.</p><p>He had ample supplies, supplemented by his spoils from the lean elder.  He wasn't worried about provisions, but his two spirit insects posed a challenge.</p><p>The fat silkworm was fine, its power increasing rapidly by consuming poisonous pills without needing other food.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly was different; for rapid metamorphosis, it required spirit herbs.</p><p>He’d started using Six-Petal Butterfly Violets to create a formula for the butterfly, with good results. Sadly, he only had two, enough for perhaps a decade of feeding.</p><p>His immediate priority was locating the Que Firebird’s nest and finding the Wan Shi Chang.</p><p>Having heard reports of Que Firebirds in this sea’s depths, Qin Sang vanished in a flash, resuming his journey.</p><p>Lacking precise coordinates, Qin Sang embarked on a lengthy search.</p><p>Que Firebirds were demonic birds with a strict hierarchy.  Under the control of their king, they only roamed near their territory.</p><p>Spotting a single Que Firebird would simplify locating their nest.</p><p>A Que Firebird flock could number in the thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands.  Most adult Que Firebirds barely qualified as extraordinary, being little better than wild beasts, with short lifespans.</p><p>Only a fraction of the powerful Que Huo Que possess the potential for further advancement. Those fortunate enough to evolve to the Yaodan stage gain the ability to establish their own territories.</p><p>Even those at the Fan Yao stage are incredibly fierce, innately wielding a chilling wind ability.  Their coordinated attacks, when working together, are terrifying.</p><p>The sheer number of Que Huo Que is enough to deter anyone just by their presence.</p><p>The symbiotic relationship between the Que Huo Que and the Wan Shi Zhang is only documented in the jade slip given to Qin Sang by the Eight Swords Elder.  Even with Xiaohan region's vast collection of ancient texts, few know of this; the Canglang Sea region is even more uninformed.</p><p>Without prior knowledge and without any incentive, no one would risk venturing into a nest of these demonic birds.</p><p>Finding a single, small demonic bird in the vast ocean is no easy feat, especially while remaining vigilant against other sea beasts. After nearly a month wandering the sea, Qin Sang finally discovered a bird remarkably similar to the Que Huo Que on a deserted island!</p><p>Its feathers were like ice, its body graceful as a swallow; its sharp beak was transparent.  About the size of a hawk, it stood on a rock at the island's edge, majestic in appearance.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Que Huo Que, eyes fixed on the seabed, suddenly plunged into the water.</p><p>An aquatic beast resembling a carp cried out shrilly. A surge of waves erupted as the two creatures engaged in a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>The sea beast had the upper hand. The Que Huo Que cried out in alarm, but unnoticed by the beast, a dozen more Que Huo Que lay hidden amongst the rocks, watching intently.</p><p>The moment the pursued Que Huo Que surfaced, these birds sprang into action, like arrows from a bow.</p><p>Terror flashed in the sea beast's eyes.  Too late to retreat, the Que Huo Que’s wings beat, gathering icy winds into a torrent that encased the beast in ice on the surface, quickly dismembering it.</p><p>Instead of immediately feeding, each Que Huo Que carried a large chunk of flesh, spreading their wings to fly east.</p><p>Qin Sang, concealed on the island, witnessed the entire hunt.</p><p>Their coordination was flawless, honed by countless repetitions, ingrained into their instincts.</p><p>A Que Huo Que at the Yaoling late stage led them. Under its watchful gaze, not a single bird dared to take a bite during the butchering.</p>
