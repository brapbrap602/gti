<h1>Chapter 1730: The Abyss</h1><p>Qin Sang, unaware of the changes behind him, dragged the thunder tortoise far from the battlefield before stopping. He created a duplicate to guard the tortoise while his main body meditated on its back.</p><p>After recovering his energy, Qin Sang rose, looked down at the thunder tortoise, and fell into thought.</p><p>The thunder tortoise remained unconscious, frozen into a giant ice chunk floating on the sea.</p><p>After their fight, Qin Sang had determined that normal communication was impossible.  He could only forcefully search its soul, gleaning information from fragmented memories.</p><p>However, soul-searching the thunder tortoise wasn't easy.  He had to carefully guard against the rampant madness that often followed such a process. Years ago, two Nascent Soul cultivators captured a manta ray; even then, they spent a long time preparing various secret techniques and support formations before daring to proceed.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of mental corruption, but his cultivation was inferior to the tortoise's.  Attempting a soul search alone risked failure.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang tapped his fingers, transforming his black magical fire whip into numerous sharp black spikes that pierced deep into the tortoise.</p><p>The unconscious tortoise trembled violently, indicating immense suffering.  But under Qin Sang's precise control, it remained unconscious, gradually weakening and growing lethargic.</p><p>Finally, the thunder tortoise awoke with piercing roars that raised goosebumps.  It was now helpless, at Qin Sang's mercy.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, and sword threads danced around him, recreating the Seven Souls Killing Array.  However, he wasn't using it to kill the tortoise, but to leverage the array's mental impact, combining it with the magical fire to assault the tortoise's consciousness.</p><p>Judging the timing right, Qin Sang's expression darkened. He pressed a hand to the tortoise's head, closed his eyes, and began the soul search! His duplicate body, armed with a magic treasure, stood guard nearby.</p><p>"Whoosh…"</p><p>Waves crashed.</p><p>The enormous thunder tortoise thrashed wildly, unable to escape Qin Sang's grasp.  Its cries went from sharp to weak, before its body convulsed violently, its breath ceasing entirely.</p><p>"Whew…"</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly, withdrawing his hand and looking down at the deceased thunder tortoise, his eyes flickering.</p><p>The information obtained from the soul search flowed through his mind.</p><p>Most was meaningless, the madness corrupting the tortoise's consciousness, making its memories chaotic.</p><p>The only clear fragment, likely due to its intensity and recent occurrence, revealed a terrifying sight: a monstrous maw filled with sharp teeth, a head resembling a fusion of a wolf and a crocodile, and a long, serpentine body.</p><p>This was another beast.  The wounds on the thunder tortoise were its doing; a single bite had shattered the tortoise's thunder armor, consuming a large chunk of flesh and leaving an unforgettable scar.</p><p>How the thunder tortoise ultimately escaped remained unclear.  But through the fragmented memories, Qin Sang felt the terrifying power of the beast, a chill running down his spine.</p><p>If the depths of the Abyss harbored creatures like this, it was no wonder the ascension path was fraught with danger.</p><p>The scene had taken place underwater.  Because he didn't know the Abyss's environment, Qin Sang couldn't determine if the beasts had clashed within the Abyss or encountered each other while wandering outside their lairs.</p><p>Aside from learning about a more ferocious beast, Qin Sang hadn't gained any useful information.</p><p>He sighed inwardly, his finger lightly tapping.  The magical fire detached from the tortoise's corpse, transforming into a fiery blade in the air, melting the ice.</p><p>"Sizzle!"</p><p>The blade cut through flesh and bone, stripping the carcass.</p><p>Seeing the thunder tortoise for the first time, Qin Sang could only rely on his experience in refining artifacts to judge the value of each part before dividing the body.</p><p>With the magical fire's assistance, the process was swift.  Once the skeleton remained, Qin Sang gestured, and a stream of light shot into his hand.</p><p>The beast possessed a demon core!</p><p>Qin Sang examined it.  He tentatively called it a demon core; it looked similar to those of ordinary beasts, a condensation of the tortoise's essence, shimmering and beautiful.</p><p>Its surface glittered with silver light, as if electric arcs danced upon it – perhaps a fusion of the thunder tortoise's innate ability, granting it unique power.</p><p>A Nascent Soul-level demon core!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, extending a strand of spiritual sense to probe the core, attempting to analyze its power.  His face changed abruptly.</p><p>He'd handled countless demon cores, but never one like this. This wasn't simply a difference in cultivation; the power within was incredibly volatile, mirroring the beast's ferocity in life.</p><p>But the thunder tortoise was dead; the core held no trace of its consciousness.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Lei Gui's corpse, summoned a piece of demon bone, and found it was the same.  He tried various methods but couldn't even pinpoint the source of the unrest.</p><p>If he couldn't calm the unrest, it would be impossible to use it for refining weapons or pills!</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>Could it be an effect of the Heavenly Change?  The Heavenly Demon's Sound not only impacted the primordial spirit but also fundamentally altered the affected creatures?</p><p>Another possibility was that the environment deep within the Abyss was unique, and the ferocious beasts were inherently like this!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that the Dragon Whale clan's sacred object was called the Mad Whale. Legend said the clan used their entire bloodline's essence to nurture it for a long time before barely refining it.  The Heavenly Demon's Sound didn't exist back then.</p><p>Qin Sang's learned refining techniques couldn't handle these materials.  He tried all his skills, refining the demon bones, and ruined several pieces before giving up completely.</p><p>The huge corpse was as useless to him as a chicken bone.</p><p>However, given the Lei Gui's high cultivation level, these materials, regardless of their usability, were extremely rare. Unable to refine them, and with limited space in his Qianjun Ring, Qin Sang could only seal the important parts, leaving them for later attempts.</p><p>After a great battle, he only obtained these temporarily unusable materials.</p><p>As a result, Qin Sang's enthusiasm for hunting ferocious beasts waned, and he focused on traveling.</p><p>After leaving the Central State, Qin Sang headed generally southeast.</p><p>He sensed the Dao Mark Gate to the east of the Central State.</p><p>The Dao Mark Gate was located inside the Abyss, but the Abyss wasn't just at the Gate.  It was a vast chasm in the deep sea, boundless and endless.</p><p>Based on the sea chart left by the Wu tribe's Transcending Tribulation cultivator, the Canglang Sea shouldn't be far from the Abyss.  Qin Sang planned to visit the Canglang Sea and take a look at the Abyss along the way.</p><p>...</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang's heart beat violently.</p><p>He hung in mid-air, his face grim as he stared ahead.</p><p>The scene within the storm was no different from elsewhere, but a strange humming sound echoed faintly within the wind, like the pulsating heartbeat of Heaven and Earth. Hearing this sound, Qin Sang's blood surged uncontrollably, and he felt an inexplicable oppression.</p><p>He transformed into a lightning bolt, speeding towards the source of the sound.</p><p>In a short while, his flight stopped abruptly. Qin Sang reappeared, gazing ahead, almost speechless!</p><p>The East Sea has a chasm, truly a bottomless valley.</p><p>The waters of the Eight Desolates and Nine Wilds, the Celestial River's flow, all pour into it, yet it neither increases nor decreases...</p><p>The words of ancient texts surfaced in Qin Sang's mind, precisely depicting the scene before him, yet unable to fully convey the awe it inspired.</p><p>This was the easternmost point of the sea.  The sea flowed here, cascading into the chasm.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Qin Sang saw a waterfall stretching before him.</p><p>The waterfall extended endlessly in both directions, its end unseen.  The sea flowed here, pouring down, its roar deafening, almost silencing the storm.</p><p>For countless years, the endless sea flowed ceaselessly.</p><p>An immeasurable amount of water flowed into the chasm, yet the world's waters didn't diminish, and the chasm could never be filled.</p><p>Looking down at the chasm, one could only see the waterfall plunging into an unknown region, deep and bottomless!</p><p>This was the Abyss!</p><p>The waterfall seemed to mark the end of the storm belt, a deep blue ribbon dividing the world into black and white halves.</p><p>On Qin Sang's side, the hurricane howled, the sky dark.  But the overwhelming hurricane couldn't enter the Abyss.  It wasn't a barrier or boundary, but a force within the chasm stronger than the hurricane, repelling its advance.</p><p>Inside the Abyss, a bright whiteness prevailed.  Water vapor rose, forming a thick fog, spreading like a boundless sea of clouds.</p><p>The hurricane swept into the cloud sea, causing the fog to undulate, creating waves.  As the hurricane went deeper, its force visibly weakened until it was swallowed by the fog.</p><p>Unlike the dim storm belt, above the Abyss, light shone brightly. The source was unknown, as if a great sun hung on the opposite shore of the cloud sea, yet the depths of the chasm remained in utter darkness.</p><p>Within the cloud sea, fairy clouds drifted, ever-changing.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, pavilions, towers, birds, and beasts, various wonders appeared constantly, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>There seemed to be an incredibly vast space there, layers of fairylands!</p><p>Qin Sang stood stiffly in mid-air, gazing at the Abyss, his blood boiling, his thoughts churning, unable to calm himself for a long time.</p><p>He had already achieved Transcending Tribulation cultivation, standing at the peak of this world, yet before this magnificent power of Heaven and Earth, he felt his own insignificance, and a stronger fighting spirit was born!</p><p>Void Refinement?</p><p>Unity?</p><p>Or perhaps, Great Ascension?</p><p>He wished that one day, he would see all the world's wonders, and view this place as insignificant!</p><p>He stopped before the waterfall, not proceeding further.</p><p>He hadn't forgotten the ancient texts' warnings: beauty masked a danger capable of devouring even powerful cultivators.  He strained his eyes, peering into the depths of the Gui Xu, a shadowy aura seeming to emanate from the clouds; possibly the legendary Black Tide.</p><p>Before even entering Gui Xu, Qin Sang felt the chaotic energy ahead.  Even with his cultivation, he couldn't be careless, especially with the beasts known to roam there.</p><p>Observing the clouds for a long time, Qin Sang noticed occasional huge waves emanating from the depths of Gui Xu. Even from afar, he felt a pang of fear.  Unfortunately, the distance and intervening barriers prevented even his divine sight from discerning what caused the disturbance, whether beast or something else.</p><p>The saying that Gui Xu is easy to enter but hard to leave is no exaggeration!</p><p>He wasn't ready to attempt the Ascension Path yet. He only wanted to see the legendary Gui Xu; he had no intention of entering for now.  If he were to enter Gui Xu, he wouldn't do so here. He should head north, first find the Daiyu Immortal Mountain, and then look for the Dao Mark Gate.</p><p>Without seeing the beasts of Gui Xu with his own eyes, Qin Sang felt a lingering dissatisfaction, lingering on the edge of Gui Xu for a long time, unwilling to leave.</p><p>After several months, Qin Sang finally got his wish.</p><p>That day, a brilliant light burst forth from the clouds, seven-colored clouds shooting into the sky, accompanied by a sharp, piercing cry.</p><p>Qin Sang's instinctive reaction was to move away, conceal his aura, and then awaken his Sky-Eye Butterfly, using his divine sight to spy on the interior of the brilliant light.  Unfortunately, the light vanished in a flash. In that fleeting glimpse, he only saw half a wing.</p><p>The feathers on the wing were brightly colored, shimmering brilliantly—even a legendary phoenix wouldn't have been more splendid.  Sadly, he couldn't see its true form, unable to identify the beast.</p><p>He knew it was a beast because he recognized the familiar madness in its cry.</p><p>This colorful feathered beast's cultivation was probably even higher than the Thunder Tortoise, also tormented by the demonic sound.</p><p>This shows that although many beasts fled their nests, some powerful ones still remain, appearing above Gui Xu.</p><p>The current Gui Xu is more dangerous than before!</p><p>Having confirmed that beasts still roamed Gui Xu, Qin Sang didn't linger.  Encountering a beast bursting from Gui Xu would be disastrous.</p><p>After one last look at Gui Xu, Qin Sang turned westward.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the storm.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings, recalling the markings on his sea chart, constantly adjusting his course.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang paused, sensing something, and dashed towards the left front.</p><p>After flying over a hundred miles, Qin Sang looked up at the sky, swiped his sleeve, and sent a stream of true energy into the void.</p><p>The seemingly empty void suddenly fluctuated, creating ripples, then splitting open a crack.  The crack was dark and lightless, but Qin Sang could see a section of a coiled dragon pillar within.</p><p>Above the pillar was a stone carved cushion.</p><p>He dashed inside, leaving the storm behind.</p><p>According to the sea chart, this was the first refuge after leaving the Canglang Sea.  From here, traveling south, he could soon enter the Canglang Sea.</p><p>This refuge wasn't discovered by the Wu cultivator. It had been controlled by the Wu tribe for a long time, and even after many years, the shelter remained untouched, showing no signs of damage.</p><p>Since the rise of humanity, the Wu tribe has been preoccupied with its own affairs, so Wu experts probably rarely travel far.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and adjusted his state to its peak before setting off again.</p><p>In his thirty-fifth year within the storm belt, he finally reached the Canglang Sea!</p><p>A sight completely different from the storm appeared ahead.  Qin Sang's face lit up, he sped forward, passing through an invisible barrier and finally escaping the storm!</p><p>Being near the storm belt, it was still affected, but much calmer than the belt itself.</p><p>It was nightfall.</p><p>Torrential rain poured down, the raindrops hitting the sea with a constant crackling sound.</p><p>Surveying the surroundings, noting the unrelenting rain, Qin Sang mused, "This must be the Rain Desert?"</p><p>The Rain Desert was at the northernmost tip of the Canglang Sea, affected by the storm belt, with constant rain and no sunlight. Qin Sang hadn't been here before.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, Qin Sang produced a token.</p><p>This was a token given to him by a Four Saints Palace descendant after the Seven Kills Hall battle.  He had said that activating the token at the far north of the Rain Desert would allow them to sense its fluctuations and come to greet him personally.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered the young man and woman were siblings; the brother was called Bao Zhengnan, and the sister Bao Xi, likely descendants of one of the Four Saints, Bao Gu.</p><p>"Hundreds of years have passed. I wonder what the situation in the Canglang Sea is like now, and whether they are still alive?"</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to unite the cultivators of the region, and the Four Saints Palace would be the best ally.</p><p>He used his spiritual sense to activate the token, triggering the prohibitions on it.</p><p>Qin Sang's sleeves fluttered as he flew slowly through the rain.</p><p>Soon, his expression shifted, and he stopped.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
