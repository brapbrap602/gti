<h1>Chapter 1585: The Vastness of the World</h1><p>Whether the change in the turbulent flow was a natural phenomenon or caused by Su Zinan forcibly opening the Boundless Hall, Qin Sang remained cautious.</p><p>Beyond the previous node, a different scene unfolded within the turbulent flow.</p><p>Su Zinan continued moving forward, circling the outer edges of the turbulent flow, his purpose unclear.  The depths of the ruins should lie above.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sensed something, looked up, and saw a dark shadow plummeting from above. He quickly dodged, narrowly avoiding several streams of turbulent flow.</p><p>Focusing his gaze, he saw it was a giant stone.</p><p>The square stone tumbled within the turbulent flow, its runes flickering with light.  A protective barrier prevented it from being crushed into dust.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed colorful patterns of unknown meaning etched onto the stone's surface, clearly man-made, most likely part of some structure.  The structure itself had already crumbled.</p><p>After this boulder flew past, more points of light appeared above, clearly various fragments, gushing forth with the turbulent flow like a landslide or tsunami.</p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath and dodged swiftly.</p><p>The fragments were incredibly dense, but fortunately, Qin Sang wasn't at the epicenter.  It was still troublesome, though.  At first, he could dodge, but in the end, he had to surround himself with Demonic Fire, forcibly smashing a path forward.</p><p>To avoid being detected by Su Zinan, Qin Sang suppressed the Demonic Fire's fluctuations as much as possible, almost losing track of them.</p><p>Relying on his cultivation and divine abilities, Qin Sang remained unscathed.  Others weren't so fortunate.</p><p>Many Nascent Soul cultivators, already struggling to reach this point, were struck by the fragments, scattering in all directions.  Many were injured and retreated in defeat.</p><p>After spewing forth a wave of debris, the secret realm calmed down for a while.</p><p>It was too chaotic here. The Heaven's Eye Butterfly had to keep an eye on Su Zinan's movements and couldn't be distracted. Qin Sang could only rely on himself to be wary of the changes within the turbulent depths.</p><p>"Could the entire Boundless Hall have been shattered? There should still be things preserved inside. What is Su Zinan wandering around for? Why hasn't he gone in yet?"</p><p>This thought had just crossed Qin Sang's mind when, moments later, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly transmitted a message: Su Zinan and his group had changed direction and were heading upwards.</p><p>...</p><p>At the front of the队伍.</p><p>Su Zinan led the way, Mo Xingdao and the Nether Moon Guards flanked him, and behind them were the helpers Su Zinan had recruited, including the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits.</p><p>Even for late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, reaching this point was far from easy.</p><p>Maintaining formation within the turbulent flow was already difficult; one careless step could lead to being swept away.</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits remained silent, observing Su Zinan in secret.</p><p>As the fragments flew past, he sensed the commotion behind him, glanced back, and clicked his tongue in amazement. "Fortunately, Fellow Daoist Su is leading the way. We didn't rashly rush in and avoided that wave of impact. I heard that the Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery were scattered by a wave like that back then. They should have invited Fellow Daoist Su as a guide earlier; they wouldn't have suffered such heavy losses."</p><p>Su Zinan said indifferently, "Cave Master, you flatter me. I only learned about the previous situation and made plans based on past experiences."</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits nodded slightly, but he didn't believe a word of it.</p><p>He had personally witnessed the previous event.</p><p>It wasn't until some time after the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and the Eight Scenery Sect entered that the fragments erupted.</p><p>The ruins were filled with chaos; it was impossible to deduce any pattern based solely on the last time.</p><p>Unless Su Zinan had known something beforehand.</p><p>Su Zinan fell silent after his reply.</p><p>With his back to everyone, his expression was somewhat gloomy.</p><p>It was all Old Devil Lu's fault for not explaining clearly back then, and Su Zinan hadn't dared to ask in detail.</p><p>The power of the turbulent flow within the Boundless Hall ruins far exceeded Su Zinan's expectations, even stronger than when it was opened last time.</p><p>Even with the full assistance of these helpers, he wouldn't be able to reach his destination. He had to abandon one of his goals.</p><p>Unknowing to him, the secret realm's existence followed a cyclical pattern.</p><p>When the turbulent flow's power fluctuated to its weakest, the realm's marker stabilized, and the connection with the outside world was clearest.  During this period, it was relatively easy to find, which was when the Eight Scenery Sect and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery had opened the secret realm last time.</p><p>One cycle lasted for hundreds of years. Missing the opportunity significantly increased the difficulty of finding the secret realm.</p><p>This was precisely why, after the ruins disappeared last time, countless cultivators came to the Red South Island Chain, all to no avail.</p><p>Su Zinan opening the secret realm now was bound to encounter a stronger turbulent flow.</p><p>They were far from the core of the ruins, still on the outermost periphery, and were already struggling to cope.</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, they likely wouldn't even be able to pass through this turbulent flow and would be forced to turn back.</p><p>One could only imagine how dangerous the interior of the ruins was.</p><p>No wonder his foster father, after discovering the Boundless Hall ruins, had weighed the risks and chosen not to force his way into the core.</p><p>Su Zinan sighed inwardly, a gloomy look flashing in his eyes. He glanced at Mo Xingdao with his peripheral vision, but maintained a normal demeanor on the surface, feigning ease as he began conversing with the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits. "I had intended to visit the Southern Continent after this matter was settled and pay respects to a few fellow Daoists.  I didn't expect to encounter Cave Master here.  I just so happen to have a question to ask."</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits was quite surprised. "What is it, Fellow Daoist Su?  Feel free to ask. I'll tell you everything I know."</p><p>Su Zinan observed the changes in the turbulent flow as he spoke.  "I'd like to inquire about a certain individual.  This person's cultivation is comparable to mine, proficient in swordsmanship, and also quite skilled in fire manipulation, wielding two peculiar spiritual flames."</p><p>"A Grand Cultivator! Fire manipulation!"</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits' eyes narrowed slightly. He asked repeatedly, "What kind of fire does he wield?"</p><p>Su Zinan sighed lightly, "I haven't directly fought this person, so I don't know the details.  One is a black spiritual flame, bordering on demonic, while the other is exceptionally violent.  Both are remarkably powerful, unlike anything I've seen before..."</p><p>After listening to Su Zinan's description, the eager look in the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits' eyes dissipated, and he pondered, "There are quite a few fellow Daoists in the cultivation world who are proficient in fire manipulation, but there are always traces to follow. I truly can't think of who could cultivate such spiritual flames on their own. Since this person is a Grand Cultivator, even if they are far away in the Western Desert or overseas, they shouldn't be unknown! What's their background, and why did they offend Fellow Daoist Su?"</p><p>"An elder of mine was murdered by this person. I have an irreconcilable blood feud with him!"</p><p>Su Zinan's tone was grim, filled with killing intent.</p><p>"To be honest with Cave Master, I've been investigating openly and covertly in the Northern Wastelands and the Central Continent for many years, yet I haven't found anything. This person seems to have sprung out of nowhere. You and I both know that this kind of divine ability cannot be achieved overnight; there will definitely be traces left behind. I firmly believe that I will find this person sooner or later."</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits was slightly startled, a look of shock flashing in his eyes. "Could the elder Fellow Daoist Su speaks of be Old Wu?"</p><p>In Deerfield, there were very few individuals qualified to be addressed as "elder" by Su Zinan.</p><p>Unless under special circumstances, Old Devil Lu wouldn't be murdered by a mere Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Su Zinan exclaimed, "Cave Master is also acquainted with Old Wu?"</p><p>"I've long heard of his name, but unfortunately, I've never had the pleasure of meeting him."</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits' eyes flickered.  He lowered his head slightly, pondered for a moment, and then asked, "I heard that Old Wu had followed Senior Lu since the Golden Core stage and was highly valued by him. Why didn't Senior Lu personally avenge Old Wu after he was murdered by this villain? No matter how great that person's divine abilities are, they wouldn't be able to escape."</p><p>"My foster father is temporarily unable to act."</p><p>Su Zinan remained silent for a moment, deliberately being vague.</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits understood and didn't press further. Returning to the previous topic, he said, "In my opinion, the sudden appearance of a Grand Cultivator is truly illogical, unless this person is deliberately concealing their true origins. But this person's fire manipulation is so formidable that even Old Wu wasn't a match. If this isn't even their primary divine ability, it would be too terrifying! Has Fellow Daoist Su considered that they might be from an outer realm?"</p><p>"Outer realm?"</p><p>Su Zinan was taken aback, a contemplative look appearing on his face.</p><p>The "outer realm" the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits spoke of wasn't a place like the Western Desert, Northern Wastelands, or Eastern Sea, but beyond the Central Continent, other realms within the Storm Belt protected by barriers.</p><p>In this world, the Central Continent wasn't the only one!</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits hummed in agreement.  "Beyond the Central Continent, there are other cultivation worlds. Due to the Storm Belt's obstruction, contact has been lost, but throughout countless years, some legends have circulated. It is said that Soul Transformation cultivators can influence Heavenly Secrets and directly refine the chaotic spiritual energy within the storm, facing fewer restrictions. They can travel anywhere under heaven.  Presumably, the Storm Belt wouldn't pose a threat to Senior Lu. I've only heard of one, the Western Lands. My knowledge is limited, and I wouldn't dare to show off in front of Fellow Daoist Su."</p><p>Having said that, the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits looked at Su Zinan expectantly, hoping to confirm this from him.</p><p>Su Zinan pondered for quite a while before saying, "Thank you for reminding me, Cave Master! My foster father once mentioned that the Western Lands truly exist.  There are other realms surrounding the Central Continent, and not just the Western Lands."</p><p>Their conversation wasn't hidden from others.</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits wasn't surprised.</p><p>Others, especially cultivators like Mo Xingdao who didn't come from prestigious sects, were both surprised and delighted, excited to learn such secrets.</p><p>Although they had heard rumors before, they treated them as mere gossip.  Hearing confirmation from Su Zinan, a Soul Transformation descendant, was a first!</p><p>"Can we go to the Western Lands?"</p><p>"Has Senior Lu personally been to the Western Lands?"</p><p>"Where are the Western Lands?"</p><p>...</p><p>Everyone asked questions one after another.</p><p>Su Zinan didn't conceal anything. "Have any of you fellow Daoists been west of the Western Desert? Beyond the barrier there isn't the sea, but shattered land, a boundless expanse of rolling magma.  In ancient times, the complete landmass was incredibly vast, beyond our imagination.  The Western Lands are at the other end of this landmass. Whether it's rumors or what my foster father has personally witnessed, the Central Continent is the sacred land of cultivation, incomparable to other places. You shouldn't abandon the essentials for the trivial.  My foster father didn't say much, only mentioning that the Western Lands are far smaller and more barren than the Central Continent, and that it's the domain of Buddhism."</p><p>Pausing, Su Zinan continued, "The journey to the Western Lands is filled with magma, and it's very easy to get lost. Unless there's another way, only Soul Transformation cultivators can cross.  It's certain that the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery and Zen Master Huiguang know about the Western Lands. As for whether the Buddhism of the Western Lands has any connection with the Buddhism of the Central Continent, that's unknown."</p><p>It took everyone a while to digest this information.  Someone continued to ask, "Could the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery's enduring prosperity be due to monopolizing the resources of two realms? I wonder if any eminent monks from the Western Lands have been brought over by them."</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits interjected, "Think carefully, everyone.  Those eminent Buddhist monks who were previously unknown and suddenly rose to fame might have come from the Western Lands."</p><p>"Besides the Western Lands, how many other places has Senior Lu been to?  Just how vast is this world?"</p><p>The one who asked was Mo Xingdao, who had remained silent until now.</p><p>This was the first time Mo Xingdao had spoken since entering the turbulent flow.</p><p>Su Zinan glanced at him. "My foster father has only been to the Western Lands and returned disappointed.  There are rumors, however, that there are similar places north of the Central Continent, even more distant than the Western Lands. Don't think that Soul Transformation cultivators are omnipotent. After entering the Storm Belt, even my foster father has to proceed with caution and wouldn't travel far easily..."</p><p>"There's another reason. Soul Transformation isn't the end of the path. The Heavenly Tribulation hangs over them like a sword. If they don't advance, they die. Soul Transformation cultivators can't afford to slack off for a moment and must focus on secluded cultivation," the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits sighed, his words carrying a deeper meaning.</p><p>Everyone turned their attention, sensing that this person seemed to know a great deal.</p><p>At that moment,</p><p>A loud rumble, like a clap of thunder, came from above, interrupting their conversation.</p><p>The gray turbulent flow condensed into layers of gray clouds, covering the sky and descending, leaving only narrow gaps between them.</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>Su Zinan shouted, raising his hands, palms facing each other. The veins in his arms bulged, and his meridians were visibly dyed black, intertwining beneath his skin, appearing strangely sinister.</p><p>Finally, all five of Su Zinan's fingers turned black, and black orbs of light appeared in his palms.  Astonishing power circulated within, the roaring sound even overwhelming the noise of the turbulent flow.</p><p>The orbs of light were aimed directly at the gap between two layers of gray clouds.</p><p>Before the power was unleashed, the edges of the gray clouds began to tremble from the impact, demonstrating the force's might.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Su Zinan shook his arms, and the black light transformed into a black demonic dragon, its horns sharp and prominent, roaring as it charged into the gap between the gray clouds.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The power exploded, forming a vortex between the gray clouds.  As it touched the edges of the clouds, they were torn and devoured, widening the gap.</p><p>"Quickly!"</p><p>Su Zinan surged upwards.</p><p>The others also assisted with their magical treasures and divine abilities, successfully passing through this layer of gray clouds.</p><p>Once safe, the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits praised, "What a Dragon Slaying Demonic Force! Truly worthy of its reputation!"</p><p>Su Zinan withdrew his power and looked at the Cave Master of Weeping Spirits. "This isn't the place for a detailed discussion. After we leave the Boundless Hall, I'll visit you personally."</p><p>"It's a deal!"</p><p>The Cave Master of Weeping Spirits nodded readily.  "I also have some matters to discuss.  I was just about to invite Fellow Daoist Su to be my guest."</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Su Zinan's eyes, and he nodded slightly.</p><p>...</p><p>Behind them.</p><p>Qin Sang found tracking them increasingly difficult.</p><p>He couldn't follow openly and also had to withstand the impact of the turbulent flow alone, struggling to cope.</p><p>Having followed them to this point, Qin Sang was already starting to have second thoughts.</p><p>Su Zinan had numerous experts by his side and knew this place better than him, holding all the advantages.</p><p>Moreover, as they continued upwards, the power of the turbulent flow was increasing too rapidly.  Qin Sang judged that unless Su Zinan had some other method, they wouldn't be able to go much further.</p><p>After pondering for a short while, Qin Sang decided to wait and see.</p><p>They hadn't traveled for even the time it takes an incense stick to burn when Qin Sang suddenly heard a loud boom like a muffled thunderclap coming from high above.</p><p>Sensing something amiss, Qin Sang was secretly alarmed. He quickly instructed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to look towards the sound. It saw a vast gray tide that had appeared at some unknown point in the depths of the void.</p><p>It was a gray expanse.</p><p>All the turbulent flows along its path were routed, swallowed up by the tide.</p><p>The tide descended from the heavens, sweeping away everything!</p><p>"Rumble..."</p><p>Heaven and earth trembled.</p><p>The cultivators who had entered the secret realm felt as if it was about to collapse.</p><p>Beneath the great tide, Su Zinan and his group appeared so insignificant. They stared upwards for a moment and then made an instant decision.</p><p>Flee!</p>
