Chapter 282: Embarking on a Journey

Ge Yuan said with a laugh, "Senior is too kind. Even if we do not find the medicine field, I know of several places in the Qiuhong Marketplace where there are treasures hidden. We can work together to explore those spots, which will surely yield some results. Senior will not return empty-handed."

Yunyouzi merely nodded with a smile, and his response was a perfunctory echo of Ge Yuan's words.

Qin Sang understood in his heart that Yunyouzi, just like him, cared only about the healing spirit medicines. If they could not find those medicines, this trip would truly be a waste of their time.

The three of them each dripped their blood essence onto the Unity Plaque, and the blood melded together.

After the Unity Plaque absorbed their blood essence, a connection was established between them.

Each of them took a Unity Plaque and discussed their plans slightly before parting ways and going their separate ways.

Unless it was absolutely necessary, they would not contact each other again before entering the Qiuhong Marketplace.

...

In the small courtyard.

Everyone stood in one spot, listening to Yu Kong explain the Return to Origin Formation in detail.

The principles behind the Return to Origin Formation were not complex. The formation could gather part of the power of each of the nine individuals inside the formation on one person, combining the strength of all nine and using it to deal with all kinds of dangerous situations that might arise when breaking the formation.

This formation did not strictly require nine people, but if there were fewer people, the power of the formation would also be greatly reduced. If there were only two or three people, the result would be the same as having no formation at all. They would instead be limited by the formation, and it would be better to act independently and respond as they saw fit.

Only with nine people could the Return to Origin Formation achieve its maximum effectiveness.

Of the nine people in the formation, the one who received the power was also the one in charge of the formation, known as the focal point. The focal point could be rotated, but it took time, and when danger approached, there might not be enough time. Only when the person in charge was unexpectedly injured and unable to assume the responsibility of the focal point would they consider changing to someone else.

Of everyone present, Yu Kong had the highest cultivation and had also been to the Qiuhong Marketplace before. He was the undisputed head of the formation.

After Qin Sang carefully learned about the Return to Origin Formation, he felt that it was quite different from the Nine Luminaries Star River Formation. The biggest difference was the autonomy of the individuals in the formation.

Once the Nine Luminaries Star River Formation was formed, the power of everyone in it would form a river of stars, which was extremely powerful. However, the people in the formation would lose all their freedom and would be continuously drained of their spiritual power by the great formation. They would not even be able to leave the formation.

Unless there was immense trust between them.

Or, like when they had explored the ancient cultivator's legacy, when there was a great being suppressing them.

Only then would they possibly agree to set up this kind of formation.

After Sima Muyue had improved the formation, this flaw had been reduced somewhat, but it still existed.

However, just as there were pros, there were also cons. Precisely because there was less variability, it did not take much time to master the Nine Luminaries Star River Formation.

The Return to Origin Formation was different. Although the person in charge of the formation still enjoyed a great deal of power, his or her constraints on the others were not as strong. When it came to a critical moment, everyone could fly away on their own and would not have to worry about being dragged down to death by the person in charge of the formation.

...

Qin Sang guessed that Yu Kong had chosen the Return to Origin Formation out of helplessness. After all, everyone there was a stranger to each other. It was impossible to establish much trust between them, but it also increased the instability of the formation.

Yu Kong had issued a special warning about this.

"Unless we are truly in mortal danger, no one is permitted to leave the Return to Origin Formation without permission. If you bring danger to others, do not blame me for being ruthless! I have given you fair warning, so do not say that I did not tell you in advance!"

Yu Kong put away the smile on his face, and his gaze swept coldly over everyone present, reminding them that he was a mid-stage Foundation Establishment expert, not a harmless scholar.

Under Yu Kong's harsh gaze, Qin Sang nodded with a solemn expression. Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the expressions on the faces of the others. In the end, his gaze fell on the three people who had joined later.

These three people were also loose cultivators that Yu Kong had recruited.

One of them was an old man wearing a black robe. This man was quite thin and his hands were especially skinny. They were like a pair of eagle claws, and he was known as Elder Woodvine.

His wood element incantations had reached a level of perfection.

The second was a short and fat middle-aged man named Wu Chen. Like Qin Sang, he was skilled in swordsmanship. However, his swords were hidden in the fan in his hand. The seven bones of the fan were seven sharp swords.

The last was a woman. She wore flowing red gauze, and her clothes were quite revealing. She had a flirtatious and charming demeanor. Her eyes were like flowing waves, and it was as if she was gazing at everyone with affection. Her name was also quite nice. It was Crescent Fairy.

Su Zhire had a bit of a seductive quality about her as well, but she seemed quite immature compared to Crescent Fairy. As if women repelled each other, the two women did not seem to like each other much. When they looked at each other, there was gunpowder in the air.

Crescent Fairy's magic weapon was a ball of red thread that could change its form in many ways.

Like Wu Chen's fan, it was more like a hidden weapon.

Including Qin Sang, the abilities that everyone had displayed were already quite impressive. Among loose cultivators, they were all佼佼者.

"Inside the jade slip are the various changes of the Return to Origin Formation. After you memorize them, Fellow Daoists, we will begin practicing the formation. We will depart in three months' time," Yu Kong said as he handed out jade slips one by one.

Crescent Fairy was surprised by Yu Kong's decision. She covered her mouth in exaggeration.

"Senior Yu, why are we leaving in such a hurry? Won't the Autumn Crane Bazaar open in another year?"

Moon Crescent Fairy's sweet voice was just as charming as her appearance, able to ignite a spark in the belly of those who heard it. People with weak willpower could be entranced by her voice alone.

Yu Kong, on the other hand, remained composed, ignoring Moon Crescent Fairy's coquettish behavior. He patiently explained, "The Autumn Crane Bazaar's protective formation is unpredictable. I just received news that the formation has undergone new changes.

Since the formation's vulnerable period is extremely short, we don't have much time. It's best if we arrive early and wait outside the bazaar. Once the low tide appears, we'll enter the formation immediately. Even if we can only stay for an extra hour, we might be able to obtain an additional treasure. Besides, the distance between West Wasteland Town and the Autumn Crane Bazaar is not short. By setting off early, we can travel at a leisurely pace, cultivate along the way, get to know each other better, and increase our chances of breaking the formation."

After that, they followed Yu Kong's instructions.

Three months passed in a flash. While traveling, they practiced formations and became extremely proficient in the Return to Origin Formation. As soon as time was up, they left West Wasteland Town together and headed north.

They brought ample cloud vessels and spirit pills and gradually approached the Autumn Crane Bazaar. After getting to know each other, they started working together to hunt cloud beasts. They distributed the spoils evenly, maintaining a superficially harmonious atmosphere within the team.

As time passed, they got closer and closer to the Autumn Crane Bazaar.

Everyone except Yan Wu had asked about Qin Sang's plans after entering the Autumn Crane Bazaar. Qin Sang hesitated for a while before agreeing to Yu Kong's invitation.

He also discovered that he wasn't the only one Yu Kong had invited. Everyone had probably received an invitation. However, unlike Qin Sang, who had his own reasons, most of the others were hesitant.

After observing Yu Kong for several days, Qin Sang couldn't find any clues.

Yu Kong didn't care about the rumors at all. Whenever someone mentioned it, he would dismissively remind them that this opportunity came only once every thirty years. It would be a pity to waste it on rumors. Instead, they should focus on planning how to obtain more treasures.

Through Yu Kong's stories, they gained a general understanding of the Autumn Crane Bazaar.
