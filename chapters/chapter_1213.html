<h1>Chapter 1205: Bone Curse</h1><p>The Twelve Demon Banners and the Ebony Sword protected their master, but Qin Sang was not under attack. However, the tremors grew more violent. He steadied himself and cautiously observed his surroundings. The sealing power here was identical to that outside. This place was the core of the seal, while the secret realm opposite was merely a part of the entire sealing force. For some reason, it protruded beyond the Abyssal Ruins. The Corpse Refinement Sect had used the connection between the altar and the seal to communicate with the mysterious figure trapped within.</p><p>The source of the tremors came from above. However, based on his previous experience, Qin Sang analyzed the restrictions in the water and discovered that the sealing power converged in the opposite direction—underwater. After some thought, he decided to use his spirit sword to clear the way and head downward.</p><p>In the water stood towering, sword-like peaks, barren and devoid of any life. At the summit of each peak was a dark, bottomless cave. It seemed the seal was suppressing these mountains—or rather, the unknown entities within them. These caves resembled open prison cells. Qin Sang remained cautious, using his Heavenly Eye technique to silently observe his surroundings. If there were any anomalies, they would not escape his Heavenly Eye.</p><p>After confirming that nothing was amiss, Qin Sang approached the edge of the peaks and set up the Twelve Demon Banners outside as a retreat path. If anything strange lurked within the caves, the banners would provide an unexpected advantage. The peaks and caves appeared similar, so Qin Sang randomly chose one at the edge and cautiously entered.</p><p>As soon as he stepped inside, Qin Sang felt the oppressive force. Although the seal had been broken, remnants of its power still sought to suppress the prisoner. His protective divine aura fluctuated as he realized the seal was not merely oppressive. The sealing power had transformed into needle-like threads of lightning, forming a punitive force. Even now, some of its power remained. If the seal had been intact, it was unimaginable how the person trapped here could have endured such torment for countless years.</p><p>Qin Sang shielded himself with sword energy, resisting the punitive force as he slowly descended into the mountain's core. This was the end—a square, orderly space within the mountain. Inside, electric serpents writhed. The punitive force targeted only living beings, and upon sensing Qin Sang, they lunged at him wildly, only to be easily deflected. This was the strongest point of the seal and punitive force, yet it was empty, with no unusual traces to be found.</p><p>After exploring several caves with the same result, Qin Sang arrived at the tallest peak in the center, where the sealing power was strongest. As soon as he entered, he noticed something unusual. Unlike the other caves, this one was not empty. Qin Sang spotted a pale white light emanating from within. When he saw the source of the light, his expression changed slightly, and he abruptly halted.</p><p>On the ground, unlike the other caves, there was a stone platform, though it was empty. In front of the platform, however, was a bone array! With a single glance, Qin Sang confirmed that the array was constructed from human bones. The bone array had existed here for countless years, its once-bloodied surface now pale and lifeless. The eerie white light came from the bones themselves, casting a sinister glow in the cave.</p><p>Arm bones, shin bones, collarbones, kneecaps, finger bones, ribs—every bone in the human body could be found here. Even a complete spine was bent and placed at the center of the array, forming a yin-yang diagram. All the bones had been refined, and they belonged to a single person! The creator of the array had stripped and disassembled an entire human body to form this grand array. However, as Qin Sang counted, he noticed one bone was missing—the skull.</p><p>The bone array was somewhat disordered, but with Qin Sang's knowledge, he could still discern its purpose. This array was likely designed to resist the punitive force of the seal.</p><p>"Was the skull destroyed, or…" Qin Sang paused. He might have been mistaken. Perhaps the creator of the array had not used someone else's bones but their own! In a place like this, where would a second person appear to be refined into a bone array? Unless two people had been trapped here from the beginning, or this was the creator's refined corpse.</p><p>The world of cultivation was filled with bizarre occurrences. It was entirely possible that the trapped person, on the brink of death, had refined their own body into a bone array to resist the punitive force, hiding their soul within the skull to cling to life. Seeing this, Qin Sang understood why the mysterious figure had desperately sought help from the outside. The bone array was likely failing, and she was on the verge of death, making a final gamble.</p><p>With the seal broken and the skull missing, it was clear she had escaped. Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine. Even he might not have the resolve to use such a bone array technique on himself.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined his surroundings, hoping to find more clues. Otherwise, the trail might go cold again. As expected, Tan Hao had likely rescued the mysterious figure, but her subsequent disappearance remained a mystery, which was Qin Sang's greatest puzzle.</p><p>Like the other mountains, the ground and walls here were smooth, without any patterns or inscriptions. Finally, Qin Sang's gaze fell on the bone array.</p><p>"Hmm…" Qin Sang made an unexpected discovery. He flashed to the side of the bone array. Each bone was engraved with intricate patterns, resembling some kind of previously unseen runes. These runes were carved directly into the bones, forming a peculiar bone curse.</p><p>"Bone curse, corpse refinement… could there be a connection?" Qin Sang pondered. The path of white bones and the path of corpses were distinct, yet both dealt with the manipulation of the dead. He suspected that the Corpse Refinement Sect's inheritance had been obtained from the mysterious figure through the altar. Back then, the Corpse Refinement Sect had possessed a Corpse King-level refined corpse, yet they had failed to rescue the mysterious figure. Perhaps they had been wary of her, wanting only the benefits without releasing her, or perhaps the sealing force had been too strong for even the Corpse King to break…</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced as he collected the bones one by one. Since he couldn't find Tan Hao or the mysterious figure, these bone curses were a valuable find. Upon returning, he might be able to glean some insights from them.</p><p>As he picked up the spine, Qin Sang's expression suddenly changed. He stared intently at a section of the spine where a bone curse was engraved.</p><p>"This rune…" Qin Sang's heart stirred as the image of the Corpse Refinement Talisman surfaced in his mind. The rune on this bone curse bore a striking resemblance to one of the runes on the Corpse Refinement Talisman.</p><p>"There is indeed a connection!" Qin Sang felt a surge of joy. The latter half of the Corpse Refinement Sect's inheritance might not be purely corpse refinement techniques but a fusion of the path of white bones. No wonder he had been struggling to make progress.</p><p>Unfortunately, he still hadn't found a way to unravel the Corpse Refinement Talisman. As Qin Sang collected the bones, he committed the bone curses to memory, hoping they would aid in deciphering the talisman. Additionally, he could bring them back for Bai to study. Bai had possessed the Soul Pearl for decades, yet he had been unable to refine it, and his advancement to Corpse King remained elusive. It seemed the issue was not a lack of strength but an incorrect approach.</p>
