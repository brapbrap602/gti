<h1>Chapter 363: Refining Tools</h1><p>Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared at the Daoist Peak. The disciples coming and going were all unfamiliar faces. Using the *Dun Ling Jue* to conceal his cultivation level, Qin Sang avoided some trouble and walked up the steps to the wooden hall.</p><p>The hall's doors were open, and some disciples were coming in and out. Qin Sang walked in. He didn't see Senior Brother Wen, but he did see a long-lost acquaintance, Zhuang Yan!</p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that Zhuang Yan had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage. It seemed that Zhuang Yan's years of hard work had not been in vain.</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin!"</p><p>Zhuang Yan was assigning tasks to a disciple.  Looking up and seeing Qin Sang, a look of surprise immediately appeared on his face.  He dismissed the disciple with a few words and strode over, laughing heartily, "I heard news from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield that you've broken through to mid-Foundation Establishment.  Calling you 'Junior Brother' makes me feel a bit uneasy.  It's a good thing I didn't run into you these past few years, otherwise I would have had to call you 'Senior Uncle' for a few more years, and I wouldn't have known where to put my old face! Haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang also chuckled, cupping his hands in a teasing manner, "Congratulations, congratulations, Senior Brother Zhuang has turned over a new leaf... Where is Senior Brother Wen?"</p><p>Zhuang Yan shook his head and said helplessly, "Master is preparing to enjoy his retirement and is no longer involved in worldly affairs. He's probably playing chess with some old friend right now.  I, his disciple, have to take on the hard work."</p><p>"Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood. It seemed that Zhuang Yan had formally become Wen's disciple, honoring the care Wen had shown him.</p><p>The way the three of them addressed each other sounded very confusing, but it was normal in the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang addressed them as Senior Brother Wen and Senior Brother Zhuang based on established customs in the cultivation world and their personal relationships. There was a great deal of flexibility, as long as he didn't offend anyone.</p><p>Zhuang Yan formally becoming Wen's disciple was their private affair.</p><p>The bond between master and disciple was paramount. Even if the disciple's cultivation level was higher than the master's, they still had to observe the proper etiquette.</p><p>Public and private matters were kept separate.</p><p>Everyone addressed each other according to their respective relationships.</p><p>Zhuang Yan led Qin Sang to a quiet room and sat down. "Master was also very pleased and delighted when he learned that you had broken through to mid-Foundation Establishment. I'll send him a message now; he'll definitely be very happy. Tell me first, what is the real situation in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield like..."</p><p>"Is Senior Brother Zhuang also interested in training in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield?" Qin Sang heard the underlying meaning.</p><p>Zhuang Yan nodded. "Although staying within the sect is safe, it's difficult to achieve great things.  Going out to train is the only way to find opportunities. Master also thinks so."</p><p>Qin Sang saw the envy hidden in Zhuang Yan's eyes and guessed that Zhuang Yan might think he had encountered a great opportunity in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to break through.  Without revealing the truth, he pondered and said, "It's not the best time for Senior Brother Zhuang to go to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield now. You should know about the impending Spirit Tide, right?"</p><p>Zhuang Yan hummed in agreement and leaned closer, speaking mysteriously, "There have been rumors lately, and the Qi Refining disciples have been talking about it. How could I not know? To deal with the changing situation, Senior Brother Qi is now in charge of sect affairs. Sect Leader Yu can only act as a figurehead. To prevent panic among the disciples, they haven't changed the Sect Leader. In addition, the sect is now preparing to gather people to patrol the Cloudmist Great Marsh. I'm also hesitant, whether to go to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield or stay in the Cloudmist Great Marsh."</p><p>"With the Spirit Tide approaching, chaos is brewing in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Compared to patrolling the Cloudmist Great Marsh, it's hard to say which is more dangerous. However, we have the sect as our backing. If Senior Brother Zhuang can make up his mind, the Spirit Tide still needs some time to brew, and you can still try the Ancient Immortal Battlefield."</p><p>Then, Qin Sang recounted his experiences in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield in detail, leaving the decision to Zhuang Yan.</p><p>Zhuang Yan fell into deep thought, remaining silent for a long time.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Zhuang Yan that not only Shaohua Mountain but several other major sects were also organizing people to patrol the Cloudmist Great Marsh and the Severed Sky Mountains.  He truly felt the situation becoming increasingly tense.</p><p>He needed to plan carefully for his own future decisions.</p><p>Not long after, Senior Brother Wen returned. The three reunited and chatted happily until evening, when Qin Sang bid farewell to the two and went to Pagoda Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang first selected a few spells, preparing to cultivate them slowly in the future, and then began searching through the vast collection of ancient books.</p><p>The next morning.</p><p>A streak of light flew out of Pagoda Peak, heading towards a green peak at the edge of Shaohua Mountain's gate.</p><p>Although this green peak seemed inconspicuous among the mountain range, it held a hidden world within. It happened to be located on a spiritual vein at the Shaohua Mountain gate. The peak was not majestic, but there were several caves suitable for Foundation Establishment cultivators to practice in.</p><p>The streak of light circled the green peak and stopped in front of a cliff on the west side. The newcomer was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the cliff face and waved his hand, sending out a restrictive spell. The cliff face shimmered and transformed, revealing an opening.  This was the cave Zhuang Yan had chosen after breaking through to Foundation Establishment. Qin Sang borrowed it for the time being.</p><p>Entering the cave and sealing the restrictions, Qin Sang recalled his busy night and couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p>He had been busy all night, and most of the information he found about the Purple Subtlety Palace was based on hearsay.</p><p>It seemed that truly valuable information was not at Pagoda Peak and might even only circulate among Core Formation cultivators. With his current cultivation level, he wasn't qualified to access it.</p><p>There was also the possibility that Shaohua Mountain didn't know much about the Purple Subtlety Palace.</p><p>The Purple Subtlety Palace was extremely mysterious.  So many Nascent Soul ancestors had entered, yet they had only explored a small part of it.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang flipped his palm and took out the jade slip given to him by Shopkeeper Wu.</p><p>In front of Shopkeeper Wu, Qin Sang had only glanced at it briefly without carefully studying it.  He had a vague feeling that the contents of the jade slip were helpful to the Ebony Sword, but he wasn't sure how much.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the reason for this was probably related to the Ebony Sword's unique refining method.</p><p>According to the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, if Qin Sang could find top-grade spiritual wood, he could possess a spirit sword of magic treasure level by late Foundation Establishment.</p><p>This indicated that the method of refining a life-bound spirit sword recorded in the cultivation technique had been geared towards creating a magic treasure from the very beginning.</p><p>As the saying went, analogy could lead to understanding. It wasn't surprising that he had gleaned insights from the jade slip that were helpful to refining the Ebony Sword.</p><p>As Qin Sang delved deeper into these insights, he found it increasingly challenging.  It wasn't easy to fully grasp them.</p><p>Qin Sang could also guess the reason: he knew nothing about refining tools.  He didn't even know how to refine magical artifacts, yet he wanted to directly comprehend the jade slip.  It was unrealistic.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the notes left by Shopkeeper Wu's ancestor.</p><p>Relatively speaking, these notes were much simpler, but to truly master them, he couldn't just sit in the cave; he needed to practice.</p><p>Did he really need to divert his attention to learning refining?</p><p>It wouldn't be a waste. After breaking through to Core Formation, this experience would definitely be helpful in refining his life-bound magic treasure. However, he couldn't spare the energy right now.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head inwardly and put the jade slip into his storage pouch.</p><p>After that, Qin Sang continued to cultivate while visiting friends and dealing with miscellaneous matters.</p><p>Before he knew it, it was time to depart.</p>
