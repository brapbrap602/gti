<h1></h1><p>“This calamity is of your own making!”</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu raged uncontrollably.</p><p>The strange-faced man sneered, “Back then, you accepted my reward and joined forces with my worthless disciple to hunt them down, yet two heavily injured individuals still managed to escape.  Now they've come seeking revenge, how can you claim innocence? Instead of fuming here, you should think about how to help me eliminate them and avenge this grudge!”</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu gnashed his teeth, “I only have a wisp of remnant soul left, all my divine abilities and treasures are gone, what can I do?”</p><p>The strange-faced man's tone softened slightly, making a promise, “You've witnessed the difficulty of cultivating that secret technique.  I also need a helper to increase the chances of success. I'm a lone wolf and have made many enemies, but I do have some rapport with you. Besides you, who else can I cooperate with? After the Legacy Palace matter is settled, as long as you assist me with my cultivation wholeheartedly, I promise to help you restore your cultivation base and reshape your physical body. If we find Nascent Soul opportunities at Emperor Bestowment Mountain, we can share them with you.”</p><p>“Nascent Soul…”</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu was filled with bitterness, his hatred for Qin Sang reaching its peak.</p><p>Not long ago, he still had Nascent Soul ambitions, but in the blink of an eye, he had fallen into this predicament.</p><p>Everything had become a fleeting dream.</p><p>Although the strange-faced man's words held no hint of threat, Qi Ling Dongzhu was well aware of how ruthless this person was.</p><p>His remnant soul was in the other's grasp.</p><p>He was like fish on a chopping board.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu had no choice but to trust the strange-faced man.  Noticing a change in the man's tone, he asked in surprise, “You want to eliminate them here?”</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu seethed inwardly.</p><p>This old scoundrel was confident in facing them both, clearly hiding his true strength, yet he wouldn't save him!</p><p>“Slaying both of them simultaneously would be beyond my capabilities. Since that person has delivered the spiritwood himself, I shall gladly accept it! However, my divine abilities require a specific environment to reach their full potential. Inside Ice Instrument Palace, they will be greatly restricted,” the strange-faced man explained, a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qi Ling Dongzhu said, “The one who attacked me wields a strange demonic fire, incredibly potent. His divine sense is the strongest I've ever encountered. He employs a secret technique targeting the primordial spirit, which caused my consciousness to falter, leading to my defeat…”</p><p>The strange-faced man hadn't witnessed the battle within the flag formation, but through Qi Ling Dongzhu's description, he gained some understanding of Qin Sang's methods.</p><p>“Wielding demonic fire…”</p><p>The strange-faced man murmured, his expression shifting slightly.</p><p>“You've also realized it, demonic fire combined with a sword formation…  It’s highly likely that the adversary Su Zinan was searching for is this very person! It's no surprise that this person, having obtained the Water Aspect Master's legacy, appeared here coincidentally and is able to control the Ice Instrument Palace grand formation. Su Zinan claimed that Old Wu suffered a great loss at his hands.  Old Wu has been missing ever since, at least heavily injured…”</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu's tone was full of warning. He had barely escaped with his remnant soul and didn't want any further mishaps.</p><p>The best course of action now was to find Su Zinan and cooperate for revenge.</p><p>“I just don't know where that Su Zinan is now!”</p><p>The strange-faced man's eyes darkened, glancing back behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar was in hot pursuit, but he maintained a safe distance, wielding the Four Jiaos Serpent Seal and constantly commanding the Jiaos Serpent to attack.</p><p>Just now, the avatar had used a spirit treasure to block the strange-faced man, and the two sides had clashed directly.</p><p>The strange-faced man sensed the sudden surge of power from the Nine Nether Demonic Fire within the flag formation and was instantly alarmed. Realizing that Qi Ling Dongzhu's situation was dire, he began to have second thoughts.</p><p>Rushing into the flag formation to rescue him… if he could save Qi Ling Dongzhu, it would be fine, but if the rescue failed, he himself might get entangled in the flag formation and be besieged, putting him at a disadvantage.</p><p>With his temperament, how could he do something so detrimental to himself?</p><p>Even though Qi Ling Dongzhu was taking the brunt of the attack for him.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's avatar was extremely cunning, hiding behind the spirit treasure, making it impossible to achieve his goal of quickly defeating them individually.  Seeing this, the strange-faced man immediately retreated, not in defeat, but to leave the Ice Palace first and then plot his counterattack.</p><p>After learning this information from Qi Ling Dongzhu, the confidence in the strange-faced man's eyes gradually faded, his thoughts racing.</p><p>Just then, a deafening thunderclap echoed within Ice Instrument Palace. A bolt of lightning tore through the azure light, streaking across the sky, passing over countless palaces. It was the Thunder Escape technique.</p><p>Its speed was rarely matched.</p><p>At the same time, the avatar abandoned its previous harassing tactics and unleashed a fierce attack with the spirit treasure.</p><p>The Jiaos Serpent twisted its body, its long tail whipping through the air with a terrifying roar, lunging forward, leaving a trail of icy flames in its wake.</p><p>The strange-faced man's eyelids twitched. A green glow lit up behind him as the wood armor trembled slightly, once again projecting the shadow of a giant tree, its lush crown acting as a protective canopy.</p><p>He quickly withdrew his gaze and chanted a strange syllable.</p><p>By this time, he had already escaped the main body of the Ice Palace and returned to the Qilin Shadow Wall. His gaze swept past the ruins of the wall, towards the vast jungle ahead.</p><p>The next moment, the ancient trees in the lush jungle swayed, and clusters of green light floated up from the vegetation, the wood spirit aura instantly becoming incredibly dense.</p><p>The light points varied in size, some as large as pearls, others as small as mung beans, each exceptionally pure.</p><p>Above the jungle, these green light points converged into a sea of green, gently undulating with the swaying trees, forming a strangely beautiful scene.</p><p>The green light points began to flow, moving directly towards the strange-faced man. In an instant, they formed an illusory path of light, leading straight to his feet.</p><p>The strange-faced man's speed surged as if he were being pulled by the path of light, crossing the void and rushing into the jungle.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>“Where are you going, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Accompanied by a cold, sharp shout, Qin Sang's true body, pushing both Sword Escape and Thunder Escape to their limits, broke through the air and caught up to the strange-faced man in the jungle.</p><p>At this moment, the Ice Palace rumbled like thunder.</p><p>The azure light seemed to be pulled downwards by an invisible force, descending lower and lower.</p><p>From the outside, the Ice Palace still appeared enveloped in azure light.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the changes beneath the blue light were becoming increasingly violent. After the Ice Lake Flag Formation annihilated Qi Ling Dongzhu, the flag shadows continued to shatter, and the few remaining intact treasure flags wouldn't last much longer.</p><p>When all the treasure flags were destroyed, the azure light would begin to disintegrate from this point. The spirit array self-destructing would undoubtedly destroy the entire Ice Palace.</p><p>Before the Ice Palace was destroyed, the jungle would remain temporarily unaffected.</p><p>Above the jungle, the green light rippled.</p><p>Qin Sang and the strange-faced man confronted each other.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the strange-faced man's wrist, sensing the evil spirit aura, thinking to himself, "As I suspected, there's something fishy going on."</p><p>When the evil spirits had scattered earlier, he had noticed and deliberately used the sword formation to try and annihilate them. Unexpectedly, the strange-faced man was so cunning as to preserve one.</p><p>However, Qi Ling Dongzhu only had a wisp of remnant soul remaining, unable to cause much trouble. Whether he lived or died wouldn't have much impact.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist and I have no grievances, why are you so aggressive?”</p><p>The strange-faced man spoke, attempting to de-escalate the situation.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu, on the other hand, continued to curse.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored them. His avatar, wielding the treasure, was catching up, sternly rebuking, "When we first met in the Southern Border, Fellow Daoist and I also had no grievances, why did you try to kill me?"</p><p>“Do you not understand the principle of 'possessing a valuable jade invites disaster'?”</p><p>The strange-faced man chuckled sinisterly.</p><p>Judging by his demeanor, he had no intention of resolving their conflict.  His earlier words were merely a delaying tactic.</p><p>Qin Sang saw no point in further discussion. With Qi Ling Dongzhu crippled, half of his objective was achieved. Today, with his true body and avatar combined, cornering the lone strange-faced man presented the best opportunity to settle the score.</p><p>Silently forming a sword seal, the sword light surrounding him abruptly halted. The Goldfall Sword flashed, leaving a brilliant arc in the void, aimed directly at the strange-faced man!</p><p>The strange-faced man flicked his wrist, retracting the evil spirit fused with Qi Ling Dongzhu's remnant soul into his sleeve. Simultaneously, he pressed his palm downwards, releasing the wooden bead.</p><p>As the sword light approached, the incredibly sharp sword intent caused the strange-faced man's pupils to constrict sharply, then flash with light. He casually grabbed at the void, causing the countless light points to shine brightly. A dense green tide converged before him, surging outwards.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Goldfall Sword pierced the green tide, causing a sudden surge.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the invisible resistance against the Goldfall Sword and was about to transform it into a sword formation.</p><p>Just then, he noticed the strange-faced man's wooden bead falling, descending straight towards the tree canopy, merging with the countless light points, appearing rather inconspicuous.</p><p>Following this, countless fine spirit threads shot out from the wooden bead, each thread connected to a light point, spreading rapidly.</p><p>If the wooden bead connected to all the light points, the entire jungle would be under the strange-faced man's control, at his disposal.</p><p>Qin Sang would never allow this to happen. He raised a finger, and the Command Thunder technique was unleashed instantly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A bolt of heavenly thunder struck down without warning.</p><p>The strange-faced man's expression changed slightly. Fortunately, he was prepared.  He quickly formed a hand seal, and a phantom image appeared before him, the wood armor reassembling to block the heavenly thunder.</p><p>This treasure had just been enduring the Jiaos Serpent's attacks, yet it was recalled by the strange-faced man in an instant.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The heavenly thunder struck the surface of the wood armor, causing its spiritual light to flicker erratically.</p><p>Threads of lightning scattered, but they could only dance on the surface of the wood armor. Even those that bypassed the armor posed no threat to the wooden bead.</p><p>The wooden bead paused momentarily, then the spirit threads continued to shoot out, quickly connecting to more than half of the light points, like a giant net, each light point a node, spreading throughout the jungle.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. He pointed his sleeve downwards, unleashing the demonic fire.  Instead of its usual dragon form, it transformed into countless spirit serpents upon appearing.</p><p>The fire serpents writhed into a terrifying mass, then dispersed, specifically targeting the wooden bead's spirit threads, devouring them ravenously.</p><p>The nearly completed spirit net was rapidly becoming a tattered mess.</p><p>Qi Ling Dongzhu also warned him that the demonic fire was extraordinarily powerful and shouldn't be underestimated.</p><p>The strange-faced man didn't dare wait any longer. His right hand flickered with hand seals. A fist-sized spirit seal, shaped like an altar, flew from his hand and vanished into the net.</p><p>The wooden bead exploded in response, but there were no wooden splinters, only pure spiritual light flowing along the spirit threads into the various light points.</p><p>In an instant, the jungle trembled violently. Centered around the strange-faced man, a green disc formed, its texture like amber, with shimmering starlight within, forming a grand formation that continuously drew in the wood spirit energy from the jungle.</p><p>If an enemy were trapped within, it would be like being imprisoned in an inescapable celestial prison.</p><p>Unfortunately, the disc was incomplete. Between the light points, black lines constantly swam, staining the green disc black, and the black areas were visibly spreading.</p><p>Trapping Qin Sang within was wishful thinking.</p><p>At this rate, the disc would collapse before long.</p><p>Moreover, the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation had already taken shape, sword threads were slicing at the disc, and the power of the sword formation was rapidly closing in.</p><p>The strange-faced man continuously changed his hand seals but couldn't suppress the demonic fire.  Without hesitation, he abruptly clasped his hands together, shouting, “Prison Decree!”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The disc exploded, green light soaring skyward.</p><p>The countless light points shone with maximum brilliance, the spirit threads between them becoming increasingly prominent, transforming into thick vines that filled the sky.</p><p>Before the word ‘Decree’ had fully faded, the wildly growing vines suddenly froze, coated in a greyish-white hue, resembling a faded ink painting.</p><p>Death Qi arose.</p><p>The vibrant jungle instantly transformed into a death prison.</p><p>Clearly, this was a divine ability even more terrifying than the Forest of Withered Prison.</p><p>A vortex of Death Qi suddenly appeared beneath Qin Sang's feet. Simultaneously, he felt a powerful restraining force. He immediately activated the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. The scattered demonic fire converged, forming a fire dragon that plunged into the Death Qi vortex!</p><p>From above, one could see a section of the fire dragon's body within the Death Qi vortex.  The demonic fire didn't resist, but instead actively accelerated its descent.</p><p>Flames poured into the Death Qi vortex.</p><p>Strange whooshing sounds emanated from within the vortex, and its base quickly turned black, its rotation slowing dramatically.</p><p>Taking advantage of the stagnation of the Death Qi, Qin Sang flapped his phoenix wings, flashing out of the vortex.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he could regain his footing, Qin Sang was forced to flap his wings again, his figure flickering twice more. When he reappeared, he was hundreds of zhang away. In the places where he had materialized and vanished, three streaks of white poisonous light remained, having missed their target.</p><p>Three streaks of poisonous light brushed past.</p><p>The source of the poisonous light was none other than the floating light points.</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang arrived, the light points instantly transformed into illusory Jade Armored Beetles, appearing without warning and capable of spitting poisonous light. The poisonous light was swift, but it only struck Qin Sang's afterimages.</p><p>The Jade Armored Beetle's main body clung to the strange-faced man's palm, half its body embedded in his flesh, greedily devouring his essence blood.  Its jade-white body gradually turned pinkish.</p><p>The strange-faced man stared at the unharmed Qin Sang, his face ashen.</p><p>A stinging pain shot through his palm as the Jade Armored Beetle, no longer appearing harmless, turned ferocious, tearing his palm into a bloody mess.</p><p>Since the Jade Armored Beetle had reached maturity, the strange-faced man hadn't felt the backlash of the Gu King for a long time.</p><p>“Is this your reliance?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was playful.</p><p>This move was indeed insidious.  The Jade Armored Beetle had fused with the strange-faced man's divine ability, transforming the light points into extensions of itself, relying on the element of surprise.  Anyone else would have been hit, but the transformation of the light points couldn't escape the Celestial Eye Butterfly's sight.</p><p>This could be considered a clash between two spirit insects, with the Celestial Eye Butterfly currently having the upper hand. In fact, with Qin Sang's powerful divine sense, as long as he remained vigilant, he would likely have detected the fluctuations during the light points' transformation.</p><p>However, most people in this situation would have their attention completely captivated by the Death Qi vortex.</p><p>The strange-faced man didn't answer, only letting out a cold snort, his hand clenching tightly.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body hadn't moved yet.</p><p>A white, cold light, carrying a bone-chilling icy aura, suddenly descended from the sky, like a waterfall of cold light cascading from the heavens.</p><p>After this exchange, the avatar had finally caught up.</p><p>The avatar, with the Four Jiaos Serpent Seal above its head, appeared above the jungle.</p><p>The Jiaos Serpent was nowhere to be seen. The spirit seal slowly rotated, gathering power.</p><p>Having wielded the spirit treasure for some time, the avatar's true essence was severely depleted, so it switched to wielding the Ice Soul Divine Light, which was equally potent.</p><p>Behind the divine light, the Snowtreading Divine Saber cleaved a path of snow, slashing towards the strange-faced man!</p>
