<h1>Chapter 1677  A Tragedy</h1><p>A burning witch mark seared Qin Sang's hand.  He, his true self, followed the sensation, racing through the mountains, occasionally glancing skyward.</p><p>Even though Purple Thunder True Person had deliberately flown far from Mount Disu to distance himself from the others, he could still clearly feel the pressure of the heavenly tribulation.</p><p>"Yin fire…"</p><p>With the Sky Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang saw the scene more clearly.  As the formless Yin fire rose, the void near the tribulation cloud distorted. Qin Sang even had the illusion of being set aflame, instinctively suppressing his aura.</p><p>He wanted to stay and carefully observe Purple Thunder True Person's tribulation, but knew it wasn't the time.  Once Purple Thunder True Person successfully passed the tribulation, further complications would arise.</p><p>Once the Daoist sect completely controlled the Legacy Mansion, escape would be impossible.</p><p>Using his Sky Eye ability, Qin Sang vaguely saw a figure at the center of the tribulation cloud. Though he couldn't clearly see Purple Thunder True Person's expression, he could inexplicably feel a powerful confidence.  Even with three calamities upon him, he stood firm.</p><p>Rather than hoping for Purple Thunder True Person's failure, it was better to find a way out.</p><p>The barrier shattered. The wind array was suppressed, but the wind煞, which had almost affected the entire mountain, hadn't completely subsided. Whirlwinds were everywhere, and combined with the previously activated array restrictions from the wind煞's impact, Mount Disu remained extremely dangerous. To avoid the hazards, Qin Sang took a winding route.</p><p>As he moved, the mark’s guidance became clearer.  Gradually, Qin Sang unexpectedly discovered that the Nascent Soul remains weren't on the mountain, but inside it.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>With deafening roars, Mount Disu was hit by even stronger tremors, making one worry that the mountain might collapse.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his expression grave. He looked down at the rocks beneath his feet, then his gaze was drawn to the violently changing clouds.</p><p>At this moment, the Mount Disu barrier was severely damaged.  The shaking seal was merely a superficial manifestation. As time passed, the Five Elements Divine Restriction, the core of the seal, finally triggered new phenomena.</p><p>The earth shook, the mountain trembled.</p><p>The five-colored clouds surrounding Mount Disu emitted dazzling rays, momentarily seeming to echo the tribulation cloud above, creating a strange beauty.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find the clouds beautiful at all.  This spectacle meant the Five Elements Divine Restriction was unstable, even mutually squeezing and impacting.  If this continued, the aftershocks would be more dangerous than the restriction itself.</p><p>The changes to the seal wouldn't stop because of Qin Sang's will; instead, they intensified.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The clouds surged upwards, or rather, expanded outwards, destroying vast swathes of buildings, leaving Mount Disu in ruins.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Accompanied by a series of loud bangs, multicolored rays shot up from multiple places on Mount Disu, directly towards the outside, originating from the mountain's interior, erupting from several caves.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed, finally stopping by one of the caves.  The cave was filled with radiant light.</p><p>The dazzling light painted the cave in vibrant colors, pouring out from within.  A rumbling sound could be heard from inside, its depth unknown.  The fluctuations emanating from the light were clearly from the same source as the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Using his Sky Eye ability, Qin Sang couldn't see the true scene inside the cave, but he made a new discovery: various runes were etched on the cave walls, incredibly mysterious.</p><p>The mark indicated the Nascent Soul remains were deep within the light.</p><p>In such a situation, rashness was unacceptable. Qin Sang quickly scanned all the runes, pondered for a moment, and grasped some clues. These runes formed a kind of restriction, guiding the power of the Five Elements Divine Restriction into the mountain's interior, ultimately forming…</p><p>A seal!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  Had that witch Nascent Soul cultivator been sealed within Mount Disu by the Wuxiang Immortal Sect as an enemy?</p><p>It could now be sensed because the seal was shaking, revealing a weakness.  That witch Nascent Soul cultivator couldn't possibly still be alive, but Qin Sang, recalling past experiences, the cause of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's destruction, the sudden changes on the mountain, and Purple Thunder True Person’s tribulation during this crisis, couldn't help but speculate.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, exercised more caution, and darted into the cave.</p><p>Upon entering, he felt immediate resistance.  Qin Sang immediately activated his protective energy shield and the Golden Sinking Sword slashed out numerous sword qi to clear a path.</p><p>The cave was far deeper than anticipated. The further in he went, the more complex and clear the patterns of the restrictions on the walls became, confirming Qin Sang's earlier judgment.</p><p>Under immense pressure, Qin Sang finally reached the bottom of the cave.  As expected, he saw the convergence of the five elemental divine prohibitions.</p><p>The mountain's interior was hollow. Qin Sang bathed in the multicolored light, his vision limited to endless clouds and his senses restricted.  The Sun Flame Heavenly Fire, the Nine Earthly Magnetic Divine Light, the Seven Mansions Starfield Sword Array, and two other divine prohibitions unknown to Qin Sang, all converged within the mountain, forming a seal.</p><p>The size of the mountain's interior was unknown; it seemed to contain a massive disc of clouds. The five elemental divine prohibitions flowed into this cloud disc, constantly rotating.  Qin Sang had not yet entered the core of the seal; the five elemental prohibitions hadn't completely merged. The outer edges of the cloud disc were still distinct, but showed signs of fusion.</p><p>Qin Sang marveled at the sight, wondering how the Wu Xiang Sect managed to perfectly integrate these disparate forces. He had no interest in delving deeper, instead focusing his mind on the mark he carried. He finally sensed a clear location: the Nascent Soul remains were indeed inside the cloud disc, but not in the center.  This indicated the Wu tribe's Nascent Soul wasn't the primary target of the seal.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight relief. The seal's core had clearly undergone changes. Thankfully, the remains weren't there; otherwise, he would have had to carefully consider his next move. However, the cloud disc was no easy feat; the power of the five elemental prohibitions reached its peak here, even stronger than outside.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on the metal elemental prohibition area, producing a small golden sword he had acquired earlier. After obtaining it, he realized the sword functioned like a jade slip and managed to unlock its restrictions, but unforeseen events prevented further examination.  The sword contained several sword formations, mostly incomplete, but clearly of significant origin.</p><p>The female cultivator who had possessed it was clearly skilled in this area, using these formations to refine her understanding. The most crucial one was the "Seven Mansions Starfield Sword Array"!</p><p>While delighted to obtain the array, Qin Sang didn't believe it would help him within the Wu Xiang Sect. There was no way he could comprehend it in such a short time, and the range of the five elemental prohibitions was limited, preventing its use.  At best, it might help his descent from the mountain.  Unexpectedly, it proved useful now.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his mind on the golden sword. The sword array manifested in his mind. While he couldn't fully grasp it immediately, understanding its operational principles would greatly ease his next steps.</p><p>When the metal elemental prohibition area rotated into view, Qin Sang leaped. Familiar scenery returned—he was surrounded by sword stars, but with a difference.  It was as if the Western Seven Mansions Celestial Realm outside had been projected into this confined space. The sword stars were denser, creating new variables, with a palpable sharpness of sword intent everywhere.</p><p>His experience breaking the array outside proved applicable here, though it would take effort. Qin Sang bypassed the complexity and quickly discerned the array's structure.</p><p>After traveling through the cloud disc for an unknown time, Qin Sang finally reached the inner layer of the seal, sensing the Nascent Soul remains floating and moving with the disc. He activated his protective罡 fire shield and forced his way through, finally reaching his destination: a black stone house floating within the seal.</p><p>“Strange, the innermost layer is actually a Wu tribe restriction.”</p><p>Qin Sang touched the stone house door, somewhat surprised.</p><p>…</p><p>Rumbling thunderclaps.</p><p>Thunder echoed through the Wu Xiang Sect.</p><p>Countless people looked up, gazing in awe at the center of the thunderclouds.  As the heavenly thunder reached its peak and then subsided, they realized the three disasters were ending!</p><p>“The figure is still there!”</p><p>“They passed the three disasters so quickly!”</p><p>“There's still the tribulation of the mind…”</p><p>A commotion arose within the ancestral hall.</p><p>The remaining members of the Wu Xiang Sect were particularly distraught.  A message came from the foremost cultivator; the person undergoing tribulation was suspected to be Zi Lei Zhenren, the Grandmaster of the Eight Scenic Views.</p><p>Another Nascent Soul cultivator in the Daoist sect. What should they do?</p><p>They had just been overjoyed at opening the Wu Xiang Sect's ancestral hall, only to be plunged into despair by this sight. To this day, their experts, including Zhu Wu Dao, were still missing.</p><p>Fear spread among them.</p><p>The Daoist side, however, was emboldened.</p><p>In a valley between Di Shou Mountain and Jin Xiang Palace.</p><p>Only the old nun from Yan Yue Temple and a female lay disciple remained; the other nuns had entered Jin Xiang Palace. They looked up at the sky, a posture they had maintained for an unknown duration.</p><p>Until they saw the heavenly thunder begin to weaken.</p><p>The old nun's expression changed slightly. “Liuli hasn’t returned yet?”</p><p>The lay disciple replied gravely, “Sister Liuli is searching for the celestial palace passage and exploring those areas.  We don’t know if she has found anything yet.”</p><p>However, the Abbess needn't worry.  Lu Li is a latecomer to the Dao, her foundation is different from ours, and she has no connection to the Wuxiang Xianmen. The Daoist sect shouldn't target her.”</p><p>The female lay disciple glanced towards the Jinxiang Hall, “I’ve already sent Sister Shan to summon the other sisters. I never expected that Master Purple Thunder would dare to attempt his ascension here. If other factions don't dare to contend with the Daoist sect, we can only reluctantly withdraw. I wonder how my sisters fared in the Jinxiang Hall, and if they obtained the true inheritance of the Jinxiang lineage.”</p><p>This unexpected turn of events was unpredictable.</p><p>The old nun nodded, “Let’s also retreat a bit and wait for Lu Li.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>……</p><p>As they spoke, the tribulation thunder rapidly weakened, and the tribulation cloud shrank, revealing a figure suspended high in the air. He had successfully passed the three calamities!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Purple Thunder retinue transformed back into three purple thunders, recombining into the Emperor’s Crown and returning.</p><p>Master Purple Thunder closed his eyes, sitting cross-legged in mid-air.</p><p>Although his aura was chaotic, he was clearly stronger than before. During the three calamities, he gradually approached the Dao, his spiritual light flashing frequently, and his understanding of the Dao becoming increasingly profound.</p><p>Without time to process these insights, Master Purple Thunder braced himself, ready for the final heart demon tribulation.</p><p>Little did he know that as his realm ascended, the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound awaited him!</p><p>Suddenly, an extremely sharp shriek pierced into Master Purple Thunder's primordial spirit like a sharp knife, as if someone was constantly uttering frenzied screams and howls in his ear, along with strange murmurs.  These weren't real sounds, but mind-numbing demonic sounds that resonated directly in his heart, causing a terrifying impact on his mind.</p><p>Master Purple Thunder's mind was struck like by a heavy hammer.  Caught off guard, he spat out a mouthful of blood, staining the sky.</p><p>The entire audience was shocked!</p><p>At that moment, Master Purple Thunder suddenly realized something.</p><p>The path to the Immortal Palace was severed.</p><p>Ascension was impossible.</p><p>It was…</p><p>The Heavenly Dao’s… demonic sound!</p><p>Master Purple Thunder's face turned pale, but he then fell into an endless illusion; the heart demon tribulation had arrived!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A shrill roar suddenly echoed from the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body, who was breaking the seal on the stone house, looked up.</p><p>The old nun stopped retreating.</p><p>All the onlookers were startled by the roar, staring blankly at the sky. They saw the bloodstains, the torn thunder robe, the fallen Emperor's Crown.</p><p>And the person who had vomited blood!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Bajing Palace lantern erupted with a hundred-zhang-high pillar of fire, its wick instantly burning out, exhausting all its power.  This was almost equivalent to self-destructing a life-saving treasure.</p><p>Master Purple Thunder's hair and beard stood on end, his body covered in blood, looking like a madman.  Confusion and madness mingled in his eyes, his seven emotions and six desires fluctuating wildly, tainted by the heart demon tribulation and the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound.</p><p>Before he completely succumbed, he forcibly struggled to regain a sliver of clarity in his eyes.</p><p>The moment he was struck by the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound, Master Purple Thunder understood that he couldn't survive this tribulation.</p><p>But he couldn't just sink into oblivion.</p><p>There was no time for self-pity, no time to curse the heavens, no time for regret or remorse.</p><p>He had to warn his junior brother.</p><p>He had to warn the younger generation of the Daoist sect.</p><p>Don't blindly break through and follow in his footsteps!</p><p>He didn't hesitate to destroy his life-saving treasure, using the shock of pain to buy a single moment, desperately trying to send this message out.</p><p>“Beware the Heavenly Dao…”</p><p>Master Purple Thunder uttered a sound, but it was stopped by another invisible force, a familiar force… the Buddhist sect!</p><p>Master Purple Thunder's eyes widened in fury!</p><p>A sigh came.</p><p>“Daoist Danyu has ascended to the upper realm with the Immortal Palace, causing a change in the Heavenly Dao… This monk will give the Bajing Palace an explanation.”</p><p>The speaker was the Holy One Huiguang, having just arrived, hidden within the magic sword formation without appearing.  His hands were clasped together, his expression compassionate, his eyes filled with regret.</p><p>“Heh…”</p><p>Master Purple Thunder tried to say something more, but the Heavenly Dao wouldn't allow it.</p><p>The last thing Master Purple Thunder saw was his junior brother, Hegao, flying out from Mount Disu, rushing over with an anxious expression, seemingly calling out — Senior Brother.</p><p>Then his consciousness completely fell into oblivion.</p><p>Everyone stared blankly at the sky, watching the Daoist master who commanded thunder and lightning, and had passed three calamities, now in a bizarre posture, his features contorted, falling into madness, sometimes screaming, sometimes laughing wildly, sometimes roaring, his breath rapidly fading.</p><p>The same thought arose in everyone's minds.</p><p>How could this be!</p><p>The Xuanmen sect is no less skilled in refining the mind than the Buddhist sect, and the Bajing Palace certainly wouldn't lack secret techniques for refining the mind.</p><p>The head of the Bajing Palace, the head of the Xuanmen sect, with a flawed Dao heart – it's simply ludicrous!</p><p>But the facts were before them, undeniable.</p><p>On this day, a great change occurred in the Southern Barbarians; Master Purple Thunder perished in the heart demon tribulation!</p><p>The entire relic mansion fell silent.</p><p>There was sadness, regret, fear, joy, schadenfreude, empathy…</p><p>Recalling the major events that had occurred in Central Plains over the years, they could only find the reason here.</p><p>It was rumored that all the ascension-stage cultivators in Central Plains had encountered misfortune, and now it was confirmed.</p><p>Otherwise, why would Master Purple Thunder have been so hasty, breaking through and undergoing the tribulation with an unstable mind?</p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p>“Too hasty!  Pitiful!  Lamentable!”</p>
