<h1>Chapter 401: A Shocking Battle</h1><p>Chapter 401: A Shocking Battle</p><p>Qin Sang didn't act rashly.</p><p>Undoubtedly, he sincerely hoped Yun Youzi could fulfill his wish, heal his hidden injuries, and make a breakthrough in his cultivation.</p><p>This wasn't just because of their friendship.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang had the opportunity and time to focus on alchemy after forming his Golden Core, he would need to hire an alchemist to help refine the Transcendence Pill for his Yuan Ying stage breakthrough.</p><p>The compensation was secondary; the key was whether this person was capable and trustworthy.</p><p>Finding a trustworthy alchemist wasn't easy.  Valuable treasures tempt the heart, especially a divine pill like the Transcendence Pill.</p><p>Remarkably, Yun Youzi possessed exceptional talent in alchemy. Even in the early stages of Foundation Establishment, he had a 70-80% chance of successfully refining the Xuanwen Heyun Pill, which speaks volumes.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped back a few paces, stood still, and quietly watched Yun Youzi.</p><p>Of course, his spiritual sense remained subtly on Yun Youzi. If Yun Youzi's situation worsened, he would still help.</p><p>It hadn't reached that point yet.</p><p>On the path of cultivation, every difficulty is a test, something Qin Sang deeply understood.</p><p>Yun Youzi was now facing his own trial, perhaps a chance for transformation. If Qin Sang intervened directly, he might rob Yun Youzi of this opportunity.</p><p>Moreover, if he did intervene, he would have to explain how he remained unharmed in the freezing wind.  No matter how close their relationship, the jade Buddha's existence couldn't be revealed.</p><p>One step, two steps…</p><p>Yun Youzi's steps grew smaller, the intervals longer, but he continued to advance, nearing the Nightfall Lily.</p><p>The ice cave trembled more violently and frequently, but it didn't distract Yun Youzi.</p><p>He was single-minded, his aged body emitting a faint aura, his steps arduous, yet a burning spark within him remained inextinguishable.</p><p>The Nightfall Lily bloomed before him, radiating immense allure.</p><p>Yet Yun Youzi's face showed no urgency or greed. His expression remained calm and unreadable, whether his steps were successful or not; no joy, no sorrow.</p><p>It seemed that even if he ultimately failed, froze to death here, and perished, it wouldn't move him.</p><p>Qin Sang watched quietly, thoughtful, slightly lowering his head, reviewing his journey into cultivation. His own state of mind seemed to shift slightly.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar startled Qin Sang from his contemplation.</p><p>The ice cave shook violently!</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly raised his head, turning towards the front.</p><p>This sound was extraordinary.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The next moment, countless shards of ice surged into the ice cave like a tidal wave.</p><p>In an instant, the ice cave's energy was thrown into utter chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly sensed Yun Youzi's movement behind him. Turning his head, he saw the small lamp on Yun Youzi's chest suddenly burst into a bright flame, melting the surrounding ice.</p><p>Yun Youzi roared, his eyes wide, staring fixedly at the Nightfall Lily.  He suddenly stamped his foot, his figure launching like a hawk, instantly reaching the Nightfall Lily, only a step away!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but admire him. The sudden change had momentarily disrupted the constant gale, creating a fleeting opportunity, lasting only a second.</p><p>Yun Youzi had not disappointed him, seizing this chance with a desperate gamble.</p><p>After rushing a considerable distance, Yun Youzi stopped again.  This had consumed much of his strength, requiring time to recover. But it was worth it. The Nightfall Lily was within reach.</p><p>Without Qin Sang's help, Yun Youzi would likely succeed in obtaining the Nightfall Lily.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, staring into the depths of the ice cave.  The previous roar seemed an omen. The tremors were becoming more frequent. He didn't know if their ice cave was located on an ice mountain or at the bottom of an ice field.</p><p>In any case, the entire world seemed to be shaking.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the source wasn't nearby, but far ahead. They were only affected by the aftershocks, yet the ice cave seemed so fragile.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous crash, like a collapsing ice mountain, shook the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly. He glanced at Yun Youzi, then quietly leaped forward.</p><p>After traveling a short distance, Qin Sang abruptly stopped, looking down at the fractured ice beneath his feet, and the deep pit below, gasping in surprise, taking a step back in apprehension.</p><p>This seemed to be the entrance to the ice cave.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to observe his surroundings, he caught sight of a scene in the distant sky, his eyes narrowing, his expression changing drastically. He hurriedly hid behind a piece of ice at the ice cave entrance, holding his breath, not daring to move.</p><p>He cautiously raised his head, looking upwards.</p><p>High above, a bluish-white wind enveloped the sky.  This was the true form of the Xuan Frost Gale.  It should be green, but the wind is always found in extremely cold, desolate places, where ice and snow coexist, dyeing the wind bluish-white, making it easily visible.</p><p>Nothing else was visible besides the Xuan Frost Gale.</p><p>But, a moment ago, for some reason, a fissure appeared in the otherwise unified wind. Through this gap, Qin Sang saw three figures standing in mid-air.</p><p>A fleeting glimpse left Qin Sang deeply shaken.</p><p>Two were human, both in black robes, somehow familiar.  Before one floated a huge, round tortoise shell. Through this Xuan Tortoise Shell, Qin Sang recognized the two figures as the mysterious experts they'd encountered after entering the Inner Valley of the Wuya Valley.</p><p>It was now certain: they were Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>Only Nascent Soul cultivators could withstand, and even fight within, the Xuan Frost Gale.</p><p>The other person wielded a spirit sword. Qin Sang had just seen him unleash a strike, the sword energy cleaving through the gale and splitting the sky.</p><p>The fissure was a sword scar! A move from the *Shadowless Sword* technique!</p><p>Having heard Yun Youzi describe the *Shadowless Sword*, Qin Sang recognized it.  This person was from the Wuji Sect; he must be the one who killed the Star Poison Frog.</p><p>However, unlike their initial guess, he wasn't a late-stage Core Formation cultivator. This person was a genuine Nascent Soul cultivator – the Wuji Sect Master!</p><p>The third figure wasn't human. It resembled a large hawk-like beast.  Its size was immense; its wings could have blotted out the sun.  Qin Sang couldn't see its full form, only half its body through the fissure.</p><p>Its feathers shone with unending thunder, like a creature born from lightning. With a single flap of its wings, it could summon a devastating thunderstorm.</p><p>It had been a wingbeat that had launched a blinding bolt of lightning, deflecting the Wuji Sect Master’s sword energy and forcing the other black-robed figure to raise the Xuan Tortoise Shell as a defense.</p><p>"Could it be a Thunder Swallowing Falcon?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled a matching beast description from ancient texts.</p><p>Undeniably, the aerial Thunder Swallowing Falcon was a Transformed Stage great demon, and likely even more powerful than that – it was capable of contending with two Nascent Soul cultivators!</p>
