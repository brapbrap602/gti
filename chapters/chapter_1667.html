<h1>Chapter 1658: Star Pavilion</h1><p>The hall was windowless.  The radiance of a magical pearl was the sole light source, dispelling the darkness, casting shifting shadows within.</p><p>Qin Sang was on high alert, surveying his surroundings. He was alone, a fact that struck him as odd.</p><p>He recalled the sudden change.</p><p>He was certain the upheaval wasn't his doing; some event elsewhere had caused this. But he couldn't understand why he'd been transported here, and alone.</p><p>"What has Zhu Wu Dao done?"</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively thought of Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>This man knew the Unseen Immortal Sect best.  Considering the timing, he wouldn't have waited for the Weeping Spirit Master; he should already be on the mountain.</p><p>His gaze shifted.</p><p>The hall was spacious and bare, except for a two-tiered jade altar in the center, resembling some kind of ritual platform.</p><p>However, the altar showed no signs of spiritual energy; it seemed abandoned.</p><p>He was about to approach the altar to examine it, but hesitated. The situation was unclear; rash action was unwise. First, he needed to figure out where he was and find a way out.</p><p>"No doors…"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. The entire hall lacked even a single door.  Restrictions shimmered on the walls; any attempt to break through would be futile.</p><p>He looked up at the ceiling; no skylight.</p><p>A subtle tremor ran through the floor; things outside the hall seemed unsettled.</p><p>This increased his confusion.  His escape might depend on the altar after all.</p><p>Qin Sang moved quickly towards the altar, about to examine it closely, when a sudden bright light erupted, not from the altar itself, but from the other side.</p><p>The light filled the hall, then vanished instantly.</p><p>But the hall didn't fall into darkness, for new light clusters immediately appeared.</p><p>'Swish! Swish!'</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four light orbs illuminated the space successively. When the light faded, four figures materialized, each exuding a powerful aura, no less formidable than Qin Sang's.</p><p>Upon seeing their faces, Qin Sang's expression froze; he inwardly groaned.</p><p>Su Zi Nan, Mo Xing Dao, and Zhu Wu Dao together were expected. But when did Fan Laomo arrive and join them?</p><p>The newcomers were indeed Zhu Wu Dao and three others.</p><p>Qin Sang had clashed with two of them, incurring minor grudges.</p><p>In ordinary circumstances, these wouldn't warrant a life-or-death struggle, but now they were outnumbered and trapped, with no escape, surely they would resort to foul play.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang wasn't prone to underestimating himself, he couldn't face four powerful cultivators alone.</p><p>"Where is the Purple Thunder Daoist?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, his gaze sweeping the hall.</p><p>But after the four figures appeared, no more light emerged.</p><p>Were the three Daoist Grand Masters not on Emperor's Grant Mountain?</p><p>Simultaneously, eight pairs of eyes fell upon Qin Sang; the four men's expressions varied.</p><p>"The Fire Demon!"</p><p>Su Zi Nan blurted out, then rejoiced, exclaiming that he’d found what he'd been searching for, a great gift delivered right to his doorstep upon arrival.</p><p>Killing the Fire Demon here would not only yield the tribulation-level treasure but also secure the third main soul of the Demon Banner!</p><p>Seeing the hall was sealed, Su Zi Nan laughed up to the heavens, "Did you ever imagine this day would come?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.  Years ago, he'd fought Wu Lao to a standstill. Why did Su Zi Nan appear to harbor such deep hatred?</p><p>Either he blamed Qin Sang for the Moon Princess's death, or Su Zi Nan knew something about the Water Phase Master's tomb!</p><p>Fan Laomo had been watching Qin Sang with an enigmatic smile. Hearing Su Zi Nan's laughter, he remarked, "So Su Daoist also has a grievance with this villain?  It seems heaven's eyes see all; the wicked will surely meet their doom!  He's walked right into hell!"</p><p>Murderous intent gleamed in his eyes.</p><p>Dark light emanated from his palm; nine Yin Demon Nails were poised.</p><p>At the battle outside the Immortal Gate, Fan Laomo had suffered a setback, three Yin Demon Nails destroyed instantly – a memory still fresh in his mind.  This time, he unleashed nine.</p><p>Su Zi Nan had been secretly urging the others to attack.</p><p>He and Mo Xing Dao had a pact, but Zhu Wu Dao and Fan Laomo were unpredictable.</p><p>Qin Sang's Ice Instrument Divine Disc was probably unknown to most, but not to Zhu Wu Dao.  Su Zi Nan didn't want those two demons to reap the benefits after the battle.</p><p>Seeing that he'd easily swayed Fan Laomo, Su Zi Nan rejoiced. Then, he noticed a smirk playing on Qin Sang’s lips, no fear, only a cold smile.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's hand, resting on the altar's edge, turned black.  Nine Netherworld Demon Fire erupted, unrestrained, smashing into the altar!</p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p>Su Zi Nan's expression changed; dark light surged from his palm, transforming into a black ruler.  The ruler’s shadow, devoid of any flourish, tore through the air, aiming for Qin Sang’s forehead.</p><p>Fan Laomo's face darkened; the nine Yin Demon Nails flew towards their target.</p><p>Qin Sang was too close to the altar.  Their movements were swift, but the demonic fire was faster.</p><p>By the time the four appeared, Qin Sang had already scanned the altar with her spiritual sense.  The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect wouldn't have built this hall without escape routes; they must be connected to the altar.</p><p>A quick scan revealed the secret: the altar was the key to the hall's restrictions.  Furthermore, a powerful force was relentlessly assaulting the hall from outside, causing tremors and destabilizing the altar.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The demonic fire surged into the altar.</p><p>The runes on the altar flashed brightly.  Overwhelmed by the demonic fire, the restrictions immediately went haywire.</p><p>This was undoubtedly adding insult to injury.  Under attack from both inside and out, the entire hall trembled violently. The five within felt a violent shudder beneath their feet, then saw the altar shatter, leaving behind a blinding white light.</p><p>Qin Sang, anticipating this, quickly retreated.  Immediately afterward, she heard a deafening crash behind her; a section of the stone wall had smashed into the protective energy shield of her Ruyi Treasure Orb.</p><p>The hall had collapsed, unbeknownst to them. The ceiling was the first to go, allowing clouds and mist to pour in, followed by the walls.</p><p>Finally, the hall's foundation was torn apart by the immense force, reduced to a torrent of rubble that was swept away into the depths of the mist.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh…*</p><p>The five inside reacted swiftly, flying into the air before the hall's complete destruction, escaping unharmed.</p><p>The only thing affected was the attacks launched by Su Zi Nan and Fan Lao Mo.  The altar's disruption interfered with their attacks, allowing Qin Sang to evade them effortlessly.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>A gale howled, clouds and mist churned.</p><p>The five stood on clouds, their bodies shimmering with various colored lights, evidently having activated their protective treasures to withstand the turbulent currents within the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang still faced four opponents.</p><p>During the standoff, they silently observed their surroundings.</p><p>Above and below, mist was everywhere, limiting visibility.</p><p>They could vaguely see the silhouette of a divine mountain above, its towering form even more imposing than the mountain they had seen earlier.  Seeing this, they realized this was the true Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>They had entered, but were still within the array's range.  The surging mist was caused by the array's disruption.</p><p>To explain it all, with their cultivation levels, understanding the situation took only an instant.</p><p>Su Zi Nan and the others didn't rush to climb the mountain, instead keeping a watchful eye on Qin Sang.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and Qin Sang had no grievances.</p><p>After entering the hall, he had been wary of Daoist experts, gathering allies partly to prevent being trapped here by the Daoists.</p><p>The Daoists had entered Di Shou Mountain earlier.</p><p>Surprisingly, Zi Lei Zhen Ren had yet to appear.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao felt a slight relief.  He looked around, then stared at Qin Sang in surprise, curious about this individual.  “May I ask your esteemed name, friend? Are you a descendant of the Fire Lineage?  It's a pity you weren't willing to make an alliance in the transmission hall.  Otherwise, I could have mediated, resolving the grievances among you. As long as it’s not a deep-seated feud, I believe Su Daoyou and Brother Fan would give me some face…”</p><p>"What's the point of wasting words with him! Even without a grudge, there's no reason not to eliminate this person, one less competitor for the treasure!"</p><p>Fan Lao Mo, still smarting from the loss of nine Yin Devil Nails, blamed Qin Sang entirely.</p><p>Su Zi Nan, without saying a word, held his black staff before him.  A fine net slipped from his sleeve into his hand.  He silently chanted an incantation, and the dragon tendon net spread out, ripping through the air.</p><p>This dragon tendon net could be large or small.  Small, it was as thin as nothing; large, it could seal off the heavens and the earth!</p><p>The capture of the Old Man Yan Shan’s Nascent Soul was due to the net's ability.</p><p>The net might not be able to stop Qin Sang, but holding her for a moment would suffice. Even if Zhu Wu Dao remained neutral, they still had three people, and Su Zi Nan believed they could subdue Qin Sang!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The dragon tendon net vanished, replaced by a grid of light in mid-air.</p><p>The lines of light crisscrossed, about to close.</p><p>A pair of exquisitely beautiful phoenix wings materialized behind Qin Sang.  Aiming for the depths of the mist, she merged with her sword, transforming into a lightning bolt and fleeing!</p><p>A thunderclap from a clear sky.</p><p>"Such incredible speed!"</p><p>Su Zi Nan and the others were shocked, watching as the lightning bolt passed through a gap in the net.</p><p>Only after the lightning bolt passed through the net did a black lotus bloom in the gap, its heart emitting a monstrous demonic aura, forming a cage, but it caught only a wisp of cloud.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo’s expression froze, then he flew into a rage.  His left palm turned, and the black lotus shot into the air, inverting, and spewing endless black light.</p><p>Wherever the black light touched, black lotuses bloomed one after another.</p><p>In an instant, countless lotuses filled the sea of mist, rising and falling in the clouds, forming a lotus pond.</p><p>Qin Sang’s escaping light fell into the lotus pond. An extremely cold aura filled the surroundings; she was surrounded by black lotuses on all sides.  No matter how she moved, she couldn't escape.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Black lotuses surged madly, sharp as blades.  If caught, Qin Sang would be instantly pulverized.  But at this moment, Qin Sang, protected by a protective aura and wielding demonic flames, stood strong, annihilating countless lotuses.</p><p>However, Fan Laomo's goal was merely to delay Qin Sang, forcing him to divide his attention. Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao moved simultaneously, flanking him from both sides.</p><p>Just then, a roar echoed from the depths of the cloud sea: "Myriad Illusory Dark Lotuses!"</p><p>The voice itself held a chilling intent.</p><p>Hearing it, Zhu Wu Dao and the others’ faces changed drastically.</p><p>Immediately after, a thunderclap more terrifying than any lightning bolt resounded from the cloud sea. Five thunder pythons burst into view, charging into the lotus pond.  They cooperated with Qin Sang's demonic fire, clearing the path ahead.</p><p>Behind the pythons, two figures descended on clouds – the two True Immortals of the Eight Views Sect.</p><p>"The two True Immortals have finally arrived!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded from afar.</p><p>Since breaking free from the ruined hall, he had ceased to worry about his situation. Using his Celestial Eye ability, he had spotted the True Immortals Zi Lei and He Gao. They must have entered earlier, having already broken through the Jade Pavilion's spatial barrier before the upheaval, entering the mountains and thus avoiding being transported to the main hall.</p><p>As for why only the two Eight Views True Immortals were present, and not Yue Lingtian, Qin Sang wasn't sure. However, with these two here, Zhu Wu Dao's faction would no longer dare to target him.</p><p>In the teleportation hall, Qin Sang had attacked them. Now, he relied on them for escape.  Times change, indeed.</p><p>"It's you."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, He Gao showed displeasure. Qin Sang had attacked them earlier; he held no favorable impression of him.</p><p>"The incident in the teleportation hall was a misunderstanding. I apologize to both Daoist friends. These Wuxiang Sect scoundrels deliberately sabotaged the formation; their motives are clearly malicious and must be investigated!"</p><p>Qin Sang shifted the blame to Zhu Wu Dao, his figure flickering as he landed near the two True Immortals.</p><p>Behind him, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao pursued relentlessly, but they hesitated, unsure what to do upon seeing this.</p><p>Zi Lei’s gaze shifted to Fan Laomo, "Daoist Fan, are you also colluding with the Wuxiang Sect remnants?"</p><p>Fan Laomo chuckled, putting away the Myriad Illusory Dark Lotuses and counter-accusing, "Old geezer, I heard they could open the Wuxiang Sect because you deliberately allowed it?"</p><p>The anger on his face had vanished, his eyes no longer focused on Qin Sang.</p><p>"After we leave, I will give you an explanation," Zi Lei said calmly.</p><p>"No, no, no…"</p><p>Fan Laomo shook his head repeatedly. "I don't want any explanation. You just need to tell me what happened in the Immortal Palace!"</p><p>Zi Lei frowned, realizing he couldn't conceal it any longer. Sighing inwardly, he said, "If I knew the details, I wouldn't have gone to all this trouble. After this matter is settled, I will join forces with the Ganlu Chan Monastery to open the Immortal Palace. We will invite your sect and various Central Plains schools to witness it."</p><p>Seeing that they were about to reach an agreement so easily, Zhu Wu Dao felt a sense of foreboding, his gaze growing increasingly gloomy.</p><p>He glanced at Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao.  Since the Daoists appeared, these two had remained aloof, acting as if they were uninvolved.</p><p>Earlier, Mo Xingdao had forced him to reveal the wordless jade tablet. Now, they had used his Golden Phase Token to enter, meaning he had outlived his usefulness. Their intentions were obvious.</p><p>The only good news was that Yue Lingtian was absent.</p><p>Seeing Zi Lei's open demeanor, Fan Laomo hesitated to press further, subconsciously glancing at Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>Then, Zhu Wu Dao's voice echoed in his ears like a whisper.</p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Fan Laomo's eyes.  He declared righteously, "Disciple Zhu has openly violated sect rules, colluding with Wuxiang Sect remnants—a heinous crime! I will personally bring him back to the sect to receive punishment…"</p><p>Before he finished, Zi Lei's figure blurred.</p><p>Fan Laomo cried out inwardly, as thunder erupted beside him.  Where Zhu Wu Dao stood, lightning soared into the sky, his form indistinct. Then, a clear crane's cry rang out—a crane ascended to the heavens!</p><p>The two True Immortals of Eight Views Sect, understanding each other perfectly, immediately acted upon seeing that they couldn't persuade Fan Laomo.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang bowed to them from afar, his phoenix wings beating rapidly as he fled towards the mountain without looking back.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao exchanged a glance, ignoring Zhu Wu Dao behind them, and pursued relentlessly. "Get back here!"</p><p>Leaving Fan Laomo alone to curse his misfortune.</p><p>…</p><p>Below the cloud sea.</p><p>Two figures lurked in a corner, sensing the battle of powerful cultivators above, not daring to make a move.</p><p>"So many powerful cultivators."</p><p>Kun Dao sensed the auras in the clouds, sticking out her tongue in relief at her senior brother's decision.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist stared fixedly upwards, perceiving three auras fleeing, the others becoming a chaotic mess. "Let's go!"</p><p>The two suppressed their auras, carefully passing through the area.</p>
