<h1>Chapter 1264: The Skeletal Corpse Flower</h1><p>After a series of exchanges, the old demon Ye, Qing Jun, and Jing Yu successively entered the blood pool.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The ebony sword shot back, circling around Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly stared at the figure before him.</p><p>"Should I address you as Fellow Daoist Ye, or Fellow Daoist Blood?"</p><p>The blood demon avatar of the old demon Ye and the "Seed of the Demon Womb" seemed somewhat similar at first glance, but in reality, they were fundamentally different.</p><p>The "Seed of the Demon Womb" involved splitting one's soul to refine a demon seed, which was later nurtured with one's own essence blood to gradually transform into an avatar, skilled in blood path techniques.</p><p>In contrast, the blood demon avatar of the old demon Ye was rooted in blood path secret arts, born from blood.</p><p>The blood demon avatar let out a sinister laugh, "I am him, and he is me! I regret not keeping you in the Abyss Ruins back then. You have indeed become a formidable threat!"</p><p>Instead of pursuing Qing Jun and Jing Yu, the blood demon avatar swiftly moved to block Qin Sang.</p><p>Having fought Qin Sang before, the old demon Ye knew how troublesome he could be. His wariness of Qin Sang was no less than that of the Nether Demon Lord.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the blood pool, realizing that he would likely have to engage in a fierce battle with the blood demon avatar first and find an opportunity to break free.</p><p>He was somewhat worried about Qing Jun.</p><p>Jing Yu was heading to search for the Corpse Flower Blood Amber and wouldn't be able to assist Qing Jun for the time being.</p><p>Although Qin Sang found Qing Jun to be quite mysterious, he didn't believe she could defeat the old demon Ye alone. He wondered how long she could hold out against him.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The Star Warrior roared.</p><p>But the roar was abruptly cut off as the Star Warrior completely vanished, leaving behind a cluster of demonic fire that swirled back.</p><p>Having just forced the Star Warrior back to its original form, Qin Sang no longer held back, summoning the eighteen demon banners.</p><p>The Star Warrior had been ordered to stop Qin Sang at all costs and wouldn't retreat. Unable to withstand the burning of the demonic fire, its talismanic power was completely depleted, and it perished.</p><p>Seeing this, the blood demon avatar's gaze sharpened.</p><p>Although he could also kill the Star Warrior, he couldn't do it as effortlessly and swiftly as Qin Sang.</p><p>The old demon Ye had a deep memory of the demonic fire Qin Sang had wielded before.</p><p>Back then, only twelve demon banners had formed the array. Now, there were eighteen demon banners swirling around Qin Sang, and the aura of the demonic fire was incomparable to before.</p><p>The blood demon avatar knew that Qin Sang's strength was no longer what it used to be, making him even more troublesome than anticipated.</p><p>Just the sight of this demonic fire made his heart race.</p><p>But at this moment, retreat was not an option.</p><p>The blood demon avatar licked his lips and once again summoned the Blood Moon Wheel, unleashing a curtain of blood.</p><p>At the same time, the fingers of his left hand twitched slightly, creating a barely perceptible ripple in the void that vanished in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to unleash the demonic fire when his expression suddenly changed. He let out an angry shout and instantly retreated several feet.</p><p>As Qin Sang retreated, a dozen crystalline blood-red needles appeared out of thin air where he had just stood, striking nothing. The needles were as fine as ox hair, gently swaying in the air.</p><p>One of the needles had touched his protective divine aura, but it seemed to ignore it, like a fish eager to pierce through and enter his body. Fortunately, he had reacted quickly enough.</p><p>These needles emitted subtle fluctuations, hidden under the cover of the blood curtain, but they couldn't escape the eyes of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The blood demon avatar inwardly cursed his luck and quickly retrieved the needles.</p><p>This set of Cold Blood Divine Needles had been crafted many years ago after discovering the blood lake. While refining a treasure banner, he had collected the blood energy and yin evil force from the blood lake to forge this set of poisonous needles, which had only recently reached completion.</p><p>The Cold Blood Divine Needles contained a strange poison, silent and deadly. If an opponent was careless, they could be struck, their essence blood corrupted, and their cultivation severely damaged. They were truly vicious.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Cold Blood Divine Needles were extremely fragile and had to be sealed in a needle case when not in use. They required preparation before being deployed, and there hadn't been enough time to use them against Qing Jun and Jing Yu.</p><p>Seeing that the Cold Blood Divine Needles had failed, the blood demon avatar temporarily withdrew them and focused on attacking Qin Sang with the Blood Moon Wheel. At the same time, he formed hand seals, causing the surrounding blood mist to surge violently, creating a sudden change in the atmosphere!</p><p>Qin Sang, instead of retreating, advanced. He only wanted to quickly force the blood demon avatar back. With a thought, he unleashed the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>In an instant, demonic flames blotted out the sky, and blood surged like a tide.</p><p>The two forces collided fiercely, creating astonishing shockwaves.</p><p>The commotion not only alarmed the Heavenly Elder and the Nether Demon Lord but also reached the entrance of the blood pool, where the cultivators within the two great formations felt the tremors, their hearts filled with anxiety.</p><p>Above the blood pool, everyone was divided into three battlefields.</p><p>Within the blood pool.</p><p>Jing Yu successfully entered the blood pool and, seeing that the blood demon avatar hadn't pursued her, felt a surge of joy.</p><p>She looked around.</p><p>The scene here hadn't changed much from what she remembered.</p><p>Countless black chains, like giant pythons, crisscrossed the blood water. Some were broken, but most remained intact, extending deep into the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p>However, after the passage of time, the sealing power of the black chains had been continuously weakening. Compared to two hundred years ago, it had noticeably diminished.</p><p>By tracing the connections of the black chains, it was clear that some of them converged in the same direction.</p><p>Jing Yu moved through the black chains, following one side of the blood pool, observing and sensing the runic power on the chains. Counting to the ninth chain, she found her target and swiftly descended along it.</p><p>The surrounding yin evil force grew increasingly dense, chilling to the bone.</p><p>The old demon Ye and Qing Jun had descended only a breath before her but were already out of sight.</p><p>Jing Yu knew exactly where their target lay, but the Corpse Flower Blood Amber was of utmost importance and had to be obtained first.</p><p>The black chains intertwined, extending to the deepest parts.</p><p>Following this chain, Jing Yu descended to an unknown depth, finally reaching the end of the chain.</p><p>This was also the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p>Similar to the bottom of the blood river, the ground here was desolate, jagged, and tempered by the blood mist into crystals, making it exceptionally hard.</p><p>The black chain was connected to a massive cage.</p><p>The iron cage she had seen earlier in the Corpse Mountain was not even a tenth the size of this one. The material of the cage was identical to the black chains, clearly part of the same structure.</p><p>Each pillar was as thick as the black chains.</p><p>The surface of the pillars was covered in runes, forming a seamless seal that, combined with the power of the black chains, suppressed the prisoner within. However, the runes were now dim, only able to release thin threads of blood lightning, with little remaining power.</p><p>This was because the cage was damaged.</p><p>In one corner of the cage, two pillars were broken, affecting the entire seal.</p><p>Inside the cage, there was a skeleton bound by chains!</p><p>The flesh and blood on the corpse had long since rotted away, leaving only the skeleton, which had been preserved to this day!</p><p>The skeleton was humanoid, unmistakably dead, lying flat on its back. However, everything below the waist was missing, whether due to torture before death or post-mortem decay.</p><p>Seeing the skeleton, Jing Yu's eyes gleamed with excitement.</p><p>On the skeleton, there were several translucent, blood-amber-like spirit flowers, emitting an eerie glow.</p><p>The Corpse Flower Blood Amber had indeed grown from the corpse of an ancient cultivator!</p><p>"Exactly five of them!"</p><p>Jing Yu nodded to herself and, without hesitation, flashed to the damaged part of the cage, striking with her wings!</p>
