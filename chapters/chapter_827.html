<h1>Chapter 819: Pursuit and Escape</h1><p>Luo Daotong was unaware of a larger conspiracy.</p><p>The enemy had laid a trap, waiting for his master to fall into it.</p><p>He was still waiting for his master's rescue.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the presence of mysterious individuals lurking on Liangqiu Island.  He didn't dare stay a moment longer and immediately decided to leave this dangerous place.</p><p>Compared to his own safety, Luo Daotong's fate was secondary.</p><p>He was full of questions, wondering which other forces, besides himself, were targeting Luo Daotong and the Yuan Ying Grandmaster behind him, and for what reason.</p><p>The enemy's power was terrifying.</p><p>Their only option was to capture and kill Luo Daotong to ascertain the identity of the force behind him.  Their ambush was clearly aimed at the Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>"If I just had another half-month, I could find a way to break the formation and kill Luo Daotong. But someone had to interfere at this time.  Luo Daotong has too many enemies,"</p><p>Qin Sang said wryly.</p><p>Two groups of people coincidentally clashed.</p><p>Under these circumstances, he even felt Nan Du Island was unsafe.</p><p>Continuing to stay on Nan Du Island was pointless; he didn't plan to return.</p><p>Luo Daotong was doomed to die. Regardless of whether the Yuan Ying cultivator behind him lived or died, the impact on the situation would be far-reaching, causing a huge uproar on Qu Heng Island. Their identities would inevitably be revealed.</p><p>His original intention was simply to find out who was behind Luo Daotong. Now, he could achieve his goal effortlessly and saw no need to get involved in further conflicts.</p><p>He fled at high speed.</p><p>But shortly after, he sensed something amiss. He turned abruptly, only to see the empty ocean, sparkling under the starlight, devoid of anyone.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were like lightning; he felt a sudden foreboding. He immediately released his Sky-Eye Butterfly.</p><p>With the Sky-Eye activated, everything was clear.</p><p>On the sea, there was a hidden figure, pursuing him at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The person appeared to be a frail woman, with an unnervingly crazed expression. Her gaze towards Qin Sang was like that of a predator eyeing its prey, sending chills down his spine.</p><p>"A soul body!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he saw through the woman's true nature.</p><p>Ghost cultivators possessed soul refinement techniques, capable of creating such soul bodies. Unlike corpses, they didn't possess a strong physical body, but their abilities were more bizarre and could kill silently.</p><p>In a way, the Yama King in the Yama Banner artifact was a type of soul body.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened—he had been discovered.</p><p>From such a distance, before he even saw her, she had sensed his presence through the Sky-Eye Butterfly's 'gaze'. This level of spiritual perception was extraordinary, even among Yuan Ying Grandmasters.</p><p>The woman was clearly a refined soul servant.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to be exposed so easily. The hair on his body stood on end.</p><p>The good news was that they had only sent a single soul body.  Clearly, their priority was killing the Yuan Ying cultivator; they hadn't made a personal appearance, otherwise, his situation would have been far more dangerous. He was still near Liangqiu Island and didn't dare engage the woman. He immediately used his escape technique at full power, fleeing without looking back.</p><p>Not only did he use talismans, sword energy, thunder sounds, but Qin Sang also activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation, growing wings on his back, seeking only to escape quickly.</p><p>His mastery of the 《Heavenly Demon Transformation》 was not high, the wings provided limited improvement, but it was better than nothing.</p><p>Even so, the speed Qin Sang instantly unleashed was enough to leave other Core Formation cultivators in the dust; the woman was momentarily stunned.</p><p>The woman stared intently at Qin Sang, screaming with her mouth wide open, her long hair wildly dancing, looking like a madwoman, her expression terrifying. Along with her scream, her body began to 'melt', eventually turning into a mass of pale white light, its speed not slower than Qin Sang's.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression darkened. He didn't expect the woman to be so relentless, but he had no good solution, so he could only continue to flee.</p><p>One chasing, one escaping, Qin Sang couldn't shake off the woman, but she couldn't catch him either.</p><p>Liangqiu Island, amidst the fog.</p><p>Another small triangular flag took shape, sinking into the sand beneath their feet.</p><p>Instantly, the entire sand seemed to be coated with a layer of gold, then disappeared as quickly as it appeared, returning to its original state.</p><p>The two withdrew their hands, the array disc gradually disappearing.</p><p>The man in black robes looked around, his face full of satisfaction.  "With this array, capturing the old demon Yin should be easy. Unfortunately, it can only be used once before the array disc self-destructs. It is said that the sect leader paid a hefty price to refine this array disc. I wonder what value the old demon Yin possesses to warrant such a great effort from the sect leader."</p><p>"Since the sect leader did this, there must be a deeper meaning; we only need to obey orders. When the old demon Yin arrives, I will hold him off, and you will operate the killing array…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, the man in gray robes seemed to sense something and showed a look of surprise, "The soul servant hasn't caught up with that young cultivator yet."</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>The man in black robes was utterly astonished.  "Soul servants are exceptionally skilled in escape techniques; among Foundation Establishment cultivators, they're top-tier.  Even if they couldn't catch the person, none of the inner disciples from the nearby sects possess such capabilities."</p><p>The man in grey robes pondered for a moment. "You stay here and watch. I'll go check it out."</p><p>Before he could move, a meteor streaked across the northern night sky.</p><p>"They're here!"</p><p>The two men sensed it simultaneously, exchanged a look, and their expressions turned grave.  They disregarded Qin Sang for the moment and split up; the man in black silently vanished into the deep sand, while the man in grey disappeared in a flash, leaving the island stealthily.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang had run far away, already out of sight of Liangqiu Island, yet the female spirit body relentlessly pursued him.</p><p>He seethed with hatred, a murderous intent rising within him.  He had to find a way to eliminate this spirit body; otherwise, once it captured and killed the Yuan Ying cultivator behind Luo Daotong, it would turn its attention to him.</p><p>Just then, a thunderous sword cry shook Qin Sang.</p><p>He looked back in alarm and saw a dazzling sword light erupt in the night sky, like an exploding comet, its brilliance surpassing even the strange light on Liangqiu Island.  Simultaneously, the sea raged, and he could feel violent tremors even from his distance.</p><p>"A Yuan Ying cultivator has arrived!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened. They had engaged.</p><p>He didn't know the situation on Liangqiu Island, but judging by the scale of the spectacle, the clash must have been an earth-shattering battle from the start. One party had rushed to the rescue, the other was prepared, and the fight likely wouldn't last long, leaving him little time.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang immediately slowed his escape, his ebony sword hovering before him as he coldly watched the woman.</p><p>The woman let out a chilling laugh, her speed unabated, ignoring the ebony sword and lunging directly for Qin Sang's face.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang swung his hand, sending the Ten Directions Yama Banner flying.</p><p>But at that moment, the woman suddenly opened her mouth wide, her lips almost splitting, yet no sound emerged—a truly bizarre sight.  Then, a strange white light rapidly formed before her, transforming into a sharp cone that spun wildly, striking towards Qin Sang's brow with lightning speed.</p><p>"This is…"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils contracted. He realized this cone was extraordinary—an attack that directly harmed the soul.  The soul refinement abilities were indeed uncanny, but they were ineffective against him.</p>
