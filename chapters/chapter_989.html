<h1>Chapter 981: Fei You</h1><p>The ebony sword was almost drawn.</p><p>Bai, hidden behind the door, was about to strike.</p><p>The young man's reaction caught them both off guard.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Bai slammed the door shut, blocking the young man.</p><p>Qin Sang feigned a thrust with the ebony sword, the spirit sword abruptly halting, its blade shimmering, pointed menacingly at the young man's face.</p><p>The young man was startled by the scene in the room, feeling the sharp edge of the sword, instantly breaking into a cold sweat.  Seeing the unconscious manager lying on the floor, he was startled again.</p><p>He was terrified, surrounded by Qin Sang and Bai, with no escape.</p><p>"Do you know me?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened as he studied the young man.</p><p>He was sure he'd never seen the young man before, yet he felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>The young man's behavior was also surprising; it seemed he had come specifically to find him.</p><p>Seeing that the young man posed no immediate threat, Qin Sang gave Bai a look.  Bai understood and carried the manager out of the room, hurrying to deal with the aftermath.</p><p>"Senior is indeed Daoist Qingfeng!"</p><p>The young man dared not ask more questions.  His heart, which had been hanging in his throat, finally settled. He had risked his life to deliver this message, expecting to have to deal with the manager, worrying about revealing his identity.</p><p>He hadn't expected the manager to already be a prisoner, and it seemed the conspiracy had been uncovered.</p><p>"Senior surely doesn't recognize me, but I've always remembered your kindness. My name is Fei You. My parents followed Senior for a time, receiving many gifts. Senior even saved their lives. After returning home, my parents never forgot Senior's kindness, always reminding me of it.  My success in achieving the Golden Core stage is all thanks to Senior's grace…"</p><p>Fearing misunderstanding, Fei You, neglecting to wipe the sweat from his brow, spoke quickly, explaining his identity.</p><p>Qin Sang uttered a soft "Hmm," his memory returning.</p><p>When he first arrived in the Demon Sea, while searching for the Jiao soul for the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman, he had hired several cultivators familiar with the Demon Sea, including the Wang sisters and an elderly couple, as well as a cultivator surnamed Peng.</p><p>Later, the Wang sisters had followed him for a time on Wuyuan Island, but the elderly couple had returned to the Inner Sea after failing to achieve the Golden Core stage, supposedly to cultivate their son.</p><p>Fei You was their son!  No wonder his features seemed familiar.</p><p>"You came to find me specifically?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down at the manager, understanding dawning in his heart.</p><p>Fei You didn't dare ask more, nodding repeatedly, his expression urgent. "The Chamber of Commerce intends to harm Senior. I couldn't contact the two Wang seniors, and I was frantic. I happened to be stationed on Yinghuan Island, and received a message from the manager, so I immediately came to inform you. I didn't expect Senior to have already uncovered his conspiracy…"</p><p>"The Wang seniors, you mean Wang Shi and Wang Xiang?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he quickly asked, "Has the Chamber of Commerce not harmed them?"</p><p>In the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce, he was closest to the Wang sisters. They had followed him for many years; if the Chamber of Commerce was targeting him, they might be implicated as well.</p><p>"The Chamber of Commerce has been searching for them!"</p><p>Fei You recounted his experience, still shaken. "After separating from Senior, the two Wang seniors left the Chamber of Commerce and returned to the Inner Sea, cultivating on Lingchun Island. Fortunately, they were cautious, and the Chamber of Commerce doesn't know much about them. Senior, rest assured, I've secretly contacted the two Wang seniors; they'll be fine. I joined the Chamber of Commerce after achieving the Golden Core stage, and I never mentioned Senior to outsiders. The Chamber of Commerce is unaware of our connection; otherwise, I might…"</p><p>Fei You spoke with a look of lingering fear.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened, his anger rising.</p><p>The Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce wasn't content with pursuing him; they intended to eliminate his friends and family. Fortunately, the Wang sisters were alert. He wondered if Ran Luo had been implicated.</p><p>"You frequently interact with that Deputy Commander on Yinghuan Island. Did he mention why the Chamber of Commerce is targeting me?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked the question weighing on his mind.</p><p>Fei You shook his head. He knew Qin Sang must have learned some things from the manager, so he went straight to the point. "The Deputy Commander is very tight-lipped. I tried several times to probe him, but I couldn't get any information. I was afraid of arousing his suspicion, so I didn't dare to ask more. The order to pursue Senior was issued suddenly some time ago.  Besides the Deputy Commander, nobody knows what happened within the Chamber of Commerce.  When the news arrived, the Deputy Commander wasn't on the island, which gave me the chance to send word to Senior. However, he hasn't gone far and should be arriving soon. Senior must leave as quickly as possible…"</p><p>Before he finished, Bai's voice suddenly came from outside, "It's too late; they're here!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Fei You's faces changed. They rushed out of the shop, one after the other.</p><p>Early morning.</p><p>Empty streets. Bai and the controlled Liu family steward stood together, facing off against another group of cultivators.</p><p>Autumn wind rose, yellow leaves fell.</p><p>The river surface rippled gently.</p><p>Shops lined the bank, all closed and shuttered. Some even activated protective arrays; figures peered from behind windows. The few pedestrians already fled the disturbance, fearing involvement.</p><p>Five opponents stood in a wedge formation, blocking Bai's path. All were Foundation Establishment masters.</p><p>In the center stood an elderly man in fine robes, his hair and beard white, his expression cold, his bearing imposing.</p><p>He stood with hands clasped behind his back, like a towering mountain, his gaze fixed on Bai, filled with apprehension.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and Fei You appeared.</p><p>The attention of the robed elder and his companions fell upon them.</p><p>"Fei You, you traitor! You dared to collude with the merchant guild rebel and leak information!"</p><p>A young man in tight-fitting clothing pointed at Fei You, shouting insults.</p><p>"Senior, that old man is the Deputy Commander."</p><p>Fei You looked embarrassed, surprised by the Deputy Commander's swift arrival. He was even more worried about the sheer number of opponents – five of them.  Not only the Deputy Commander, but also other elite members of the guild. Their chances of victory seemed slim.</p><p>But regret was useless now.</p><p>"You court death!"</p><p>The robed elder glanced disdainfully at Fei You, snorted coldly, and turned to Qin Sang,  "Are you Daoist Qingfeng?"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, his gaze sweeping across the five.</p><p>The Deputy Commander's strength was likely comparable to Elder Zou's. Besides him was a late Foundation Establishment cultivator. The young man's cultivation was similar to Fei You's, and the other two were mid-Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>He himself was outwardly only mid-Foundation Establishment. The Deputy Commander brought so many subordinates; it was a full-scale attack.</p><p>Qin Sang thought inwardly.</p><p>He secretly sent a message to Bai and Fei You, deciding to fight.</p><p>This small number wasn't enough to scare him off.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't answer. The Deputy Commander showed no anger, saying calmly, "Daoist, to possess such a powerful corpse… I'm glad I didn't underestimate you."</p><p>Bai was furious and wanted to ask the Deputy Commander, "Have you ever seen a corpse with such high intelligence?"</p><p>"The Qiongyu Merchant Guild is purging itself. We ask for your cooperation, friends. The Guild will cover all losses!  I, as Deputy Commander of the Qiongyu Merchant Guild, request the assistance of the Merchant Alliance.  Great rewards await!"</p><p>The Deputy Commander suddenly raised a token, his voice booming through the street.</p>
