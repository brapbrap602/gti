<h1>Chapter 1260: A Covert Maneuver</h1><p>Qin Sang had yet to witness his senior sister, Qing Jun, in action. Even before she had formed her Nascent Soul, she had always exuded an air of mystery. Her strength was undeniable; otherwise, figures like the Crimson-Haired Ancestor and other self-proclaimed righteous patriarchs would not have so easily acquiesced after discovering that Qing Jun had usurped another's foundation and claimed their legacy.</p><p>However, what surprised Qin Sang was that even after he had advanced to the Nascent Soul stage and could stand on equal footing with her, Qing Jun remained an enigma, her depths unfathomable. In recent years, this sense of mystery had only grown stronger, like a deep, dark pool whose bottom could not be seen.</p><p>Among all the Nascent Soul cultivators Qin Sang had encountered in the North Star Realm, only the Old Demon Ye had given him a similar feeling.</p><p>Reflecting on it, Qin Sang traced this impression back to the time before he had ventured into the Abyssal Ruins, when he had gone to ask Qing Jun for the damaged Demon Banner. At that time, Qing Jun had imparted to him the forbidden technique, *The Seal of the Unborn Demon*, and confessed that she had been plagued by its side effects for many years, only recently resolving the hidden dangers it posed. This likely had something to do with her current state.</p><p>After overcoming these obstacles, Qing Jun had undoubtedly broken free from her shackles, and her strength must have surged dramatically.</p><p>"Could it be that Senior Sister's cultivation has reached the level of figures like the Netherworld Demon Lord?" Qin Sang was startled by this thought.</p><p>After all, cultivators like the True One Daoist and the Netherworld Demon Lord had spent centuries in bitter cultivation to achieve their current accomplishments. Reaching the Nascent Soul stage was no small feat, and aside from outliers like himself, everyone who achieved it possessed exceptional talent. Even Qin Sang, through his unique cultivation methods, had indirectly enhanced his own aptitude.</p><p>Even if Qing Jun possessed a Heavenly Spirit Root, achieving such heights in such a short time would mark her as a truly extraordinary figure. However, these were merely Qin Sang's speculations. Perhaps Qing Jun's cultivation techniques were unique, granting her special methods of concealment. Since it involved her secrets, Qin Sang did not feel it appropriate to pry further.</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord, Qing Jun, Qin Sang, and Jing Yu made up the group of four. Both Qin Sang and Jing Yu were demonic cultivators, and since Jing Yu was familiar with the terrain, she would lead the way. Qin Sang's strength was well-known, and with their agreement to proceed, no one had any reason to object.</p><p>Once the decision was made, the group immediately sprang into action. The Netherworld Demon Lord and Qing Jun transferred their jade talismans to Si Di and another, while Xiang Qing's body was engulfed in demonic flames. The spiritual fire he controlled had undergone a slight transformation, now fused with the Ancestral Sacred Flame, exuding a more domineering aura.</p><p>With Xiang Qing at the helm of the formation, the others each contributed their own methods, pouring their strength into the effort. The formation trembled slightly before stabilizing, its appearance largely unchanged. This subtle alteration would not remain hidden for long, but it only needed to last until they infiltrated the area.</p><p>The jade talismans changed hands.</p><p>Suddenly, the group's offensive shifted. They activated the *Dual Nine Palaces Formation* and began to retreat, as if preparing to abandon their assault.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi and the others, who were controlling the *Banner Gate Formation*, noticed this change and were puzzled.</p><p>"Huh? Have they realized they can't break through and decided to retreat?" one of the Banner-Holding Nascent Soul cultivators exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Another sneered, "It's not that simple. The Netherworld Demon Lord is full of tricks. Perhaps he sees no hope of breaking through and doesn't want to waste his strength. He's probably planning to set up a trap outside, waiting for us to emerge so he can ambush us."</p><p>"If that ancient cultivator still has the strength to resist and we end up in a stalemate, they might just succeed. What a pity..." the Banner-Holder chuckled darkly.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi furrowed his brow. The *Dual Nine Palaces Formation* was ever-changing, and it was impossible to see the movements of those within it. For now, he could only watch and wait, unable to discern their true intentions.</p><p>They did not attempt to stop the retreat. Their primary concern was the ancient cultivator, and they too wished to conserve their strength in case of unforeseen circumstances. Holding the entrance to the Blood Pool was enough.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, do not let your guard down! The Netherworld Demon Lord may be feinting!" Jiang Chenzi loudly warned.</p><p>As expected, Jiang Chenzi's suspicions were confirmed!</p><p>After retreating a short distance, the *Dual Nine Palaces Formation* suddenly erupted with two beams of yin-yang energy, transforming into sharp swords that thrust forward. At the same time, the formation surged forward, moving even faster than before.</p><p>"Block them!" Jiang Chenzi commanded calmly. The group worked together to activate the three Banner Gates, firmly blocking the path of the *Dual Nine Palaces Formation*.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the other three had secretly detached from the formation, concealing themselves and returning to the blood mist.</p><p>At the center of the formation, a mass of black light flickered, the illusion of the central Black Tower. With the support of the Black Tower's formation power, it began to reform. However, the two formations were clashing at the entrance to the Blood Pool, and the resulting shockwaves repeatedly disrupted the illusion, preventing it from fully taking shape. This was their best opportunity.</p><p>Knowing time was of the essence, the four immediately moved to another direction, plunging into the illusion to search for a weakness in the ancient restrictions.</p><p>The Blood Pool was vast, and even though the illusions were damaged, finding a gap in the ancient restrictions to infiltrate would still require considerable effort. Fortunately, with Jing Yu leading the way and the assistance of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, the four eventually discovered a crack after some exploration.</p><p>They stopped.</p><p>All around them was thick blood mist.</p><p>Ahead, a corridor made of black stone stretched out, originally connected to the Black Tower. Now, with the tower collapsed, it had become a dead end. The ongoing clash of formations continued to send shockwaves through the area, disturbing the illusions. The corridor was riddled with cracks, on the verge of collapse, revealing its illusory nature.</p><p>Without much difficulty, they found the true ancient restrictionâ€”an invisible barrier. There were indeed damaged areas on the barrier, but unfortunately, the cracks were too narrow, and powerful ancient restriction energy still flowed within them.</p><p>"Forcing our way through is not an option! Even if we could break in, it would create too much commotion and alert the Old Demon Ye inside," Qin Sang said after inspecting the barrier.</p><p>Undeterred, the group immediately changed direction, searching for another weak point.</p><p>After trying three different locations, they finally found a suitable spot behind the Black Tower. Here, the ancient restriction was fragile, and with a concerted effort, they could create a gap just wide enough for one person to pass through.</p><p>It was unlikely they would find a better option, so the four decided to act here.</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Lord once again summoned the Yin Thunder Gourd he had used earlier.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the other hand, silently summoned his Demon Banner, ready for battle.</p><p>Jing Yu stood beside him, spitting out the Thunder Bead, the only treasure she possessed. In her hands, the Thunder Bead displayed its true power, far surpassing the less than fifty percent effectiveness the Fat Chicken had been able to muster.</p><p>Qin Sang's task was to create the best possible conditions for Jing Yu to seize the Corpse Flower Blood Amber!</p>
