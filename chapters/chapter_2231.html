<h1>Chapter 2221 Wanted</h1><p>Luan, possessing considerable strength, pushed the cart forward at a brisk pace. The uneven road jolted Qin Sang, causing her considerable pain.  She couldn't help but reflect on how unusually weak she felt.</p><p>He wore a fur hat and a wind-resistant cloak woven from mountain herbs by his mother. The material was surprisingly soft, a testament to her excellent craftsmanship.</p><p>Their family was relatively well-off for the area, living near the city.  Both her parents were hardworking; many poorer families lived further into the mountains.</p><p>They encountered villagers from their home. Upon seeing Qin Sang, they shied away.  Each time, Luan would purposely engage them in conversation, loudly proclaiming that his younger sibling's illness had improved.</p><p>Qin Sang understood her brother's kind intentions and, summoning her strength, smiled and greeted the villagers. Seeing her improved complexion, the villagers, inherently kind people, lost their apprehension.  They chatted and laughed as they approached the city gate.</p><p>People streamed towards the city gate from both inside and outside.  Taking advantage of their proximity, they secured a vantage point with good visibility near the gate. Luan steadied the cart, leaning against it to share hunting experiences with his companions.</p><p>Qin Sang, with nothing to do, responded to the villagers’ greetings while her gaze wandered, observing the scenery and the crowd.  It was a novel experience.</p><p>When Liuli ascended to the Greater Thousand World with the Storm Realm, her only journey was with Chen and others to Fengju Jade Gate.  Could she have encountered a place preserving ancient customs along the way?</p><p>If it were a scene imagined from ancient texts, it was hard to believe how realistic it seemed.  Perhaps, because Qin Sang had not experienced a karmic tribulation, she couldn't fully empathize, and her assumptions might be inaccurate.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across faces, then paused on one person.  Near the city gate, a dozen people were lounging against the wall, basking in the sun. Their attire suggested they were beggars.</p><p>Lost in a drowsy slumber, they seemed oblivious to their surroundings, unfazed by the crowd gathering near the gate.</p><p>It was an old beggar among them that caught Qin Sang's attention. Lying on a mat, his face was deeply lined; were it not for the rise and fall of his chest, one might have thought him dead.  His clothes, though ragged, were remarkably clean, unlike the others.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed immediately that this old beggar was no ordinary person. She had no specific reason, but trusted her judgment even in her weakened state.</p><p>'Dong dong dong!'</p><p>A squad of guards emerged from the city gate.</p><p>"Get lost! Get out of here!"</p><p>They used their staves to shoo away the beggars.  Some, unable to dodge, were struck, wincing but only daring to offer apologetic smiles.</p><p>"He! He! Wake up! Wake up! You'll be beaten to death if you don't run!"</p><p>A kind beggar shook the old man awake and pulled him to safety.  Despite his frail appearance, the old beggar's movements were surprisingly agile.  He quickly scrambled to his feet, not forgetting to grab his mat.</p><p>The guards were approaching, and seeing how old he was, likely to avoid killing him, they made a show of threatening him but refrained from actually striking.</p><p>That's what everyone else saw.  However, Qin Sang observed something others missed. The guard wasn't truly benevolent; for someone in his position, killing an old beggar was no different from killing a stray dog.</p><p>At the last moment, the guard's expression intensified, yet his staff did not land on the old beggar.  The old beggar seemed to anticipate it, moving with surprising ease.</p><p>"Martial arts? Or...?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Finding a cultivator so quickly was fortunate.  Many cultivators had eccentricities, disguising themselves as beggars to experience the mortal realm; it wasn't impossible.  However, she also knew some martial arts allowed for remote force manipulation.</p><p>Many hunters in this era possessed refined martial skills.  Her brother had trained under an old hunter since childhood.  This alone wasn't enough to confirm the beggar's true nature.</p><p>"Brother," Qin Sang called, pointing to the old beggar and feigning compassion, "That old man is so old and begging. Have you ever seen him before?"</p><p>Luan scratched his head. "I think I saw him before you got sick.  I've been so busy with your illness that I haven't paid much attention.  He's probably from another village, abandoned by his ungrateful children."</p><p>The village was close to the city gate, and most of the beggars there were familiar faces.</p><p>Luan didn't pay them any mind, turning to continue chatting with his friends. After all, who would care about an old beggar?  Everyone was just worried about feeding their own families.</p><p>As they spoke, the beggars shuffled together into a rocky hollow to continue sunbathing.</p><p>Qin Sang's view was blocked. He decided not to approach the old beggars immediately; it would be too obvious. He was currently a powerless mortal and needed to be cautious and proceed step by step.</p><p>"Such a small city, yet it's full of hidden dangers," Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>This city was called Fengcheng, and it governed many villages scattered across the plain. The plain was surrounded on all sides by mountains, and it was said that only one road led out. Xi's parents had never left Fengcheng in their lives and only knew about the outside world through hearsay.</p><p>There didn't seem to be a unified nation like those in later times. Xi's memories didn't indicate to which country Fengcheng belonged.</p><p>The lord of Fengcheng was their leader, ruling this basin.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Another rainbow shot out from the city, causing a collective gasp from the onlookers.</p><p>The long, bright arc soared into the sky, crossed the mountains, and disappeared from sight.</p><p>"That cultivator has left…" Qin Sang thought, noticing he was now surrounded, with more people constantly arriving from the distance.</p><p>At that moment, a guard rushed out of the city and handed a long wooden box to a man who looked like a commander.</p><p>This man was tall and strong, even taller than Luan, with thick eyebrows, large eyes, and an imposing presence.</p><p>'Clap!'</p><p>The commander took a step forward, his eyes sweeping across the crowd. The noisy chatter immediately subsided.</p><p>"You few, put up these portraits!"</p><p>The commander opened the box and summoned several guards to fetch some paste.</p><p>Inside the box were several portraits. The guards carefully unfolded the first one and gently affixed it to the wall.</p><p>"Who is this?"</p><p>"Are they arresting people again?  This portrait is so well-done!"</p><p>"He's handsome too, even more handsome than Xia, the city's most beautiful man! I've never seen him before. I wonder what he did."</p><p>…</p><p>People pointed and whispered at the portrait.</p><p>The portrait was clearly a wanted poster, showing a man's face, painted with remarkable skill, capturing his likeness perfectly.</p><p>While others were admiring the portrait, Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. The wanted poster depicted him!</p><p>"Listen up!"</p><p>The commander drew his sword and shouted, "These are all heinous criminals, mass murderers!  Anyone who sees these people must immediately apprehend them and report to the city lord. Anyone who dares to hide them will have their entire family beheaded by my own hand!"</p><p>Many people showed terrified expressions and trembled at the commander's fierce threat.</p><p>The guards then put up the second and third portraits…</p><p>When the third portrait was posted, the guards' movements suddenly became much gentler.  Seeing this portrait, a wave of excited cries erupted from the crowd.</p><p>"So beautiful!"</p><p>"There's such beauty in the world!"</p><p>"Our village's prettiest girl is like a firefly compared to her, she's the moon in the sky! Why was I ever obsessed with that ugly girl?!"</p><p>…</p><p>The third portrait was of an extremely beautiful woman. The portrait alone captivated many, with some beating their chests in regret, others falling into a daze.</p><p>Even Luan beside Qin Sang was mesmerized, drool dripping from his mouth without him realizing it.</p><p>Even the fourth portrait, another beautiful woman of elegant bearing, received little attention, as most people were still fixated on the previous one.</p><p>There were five portraits in total – three men and two women.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the portraits, his eyes deep. The people in the portraits were all familiar to him.</p><p>The first and third were him and Liuli. The other three were, astonishingly, Zhan Yan, Xu Mu, and Jing Zhen!</p><p>Why were they in Liuli's mind demon?</p><p>If Liuli had thought of them, why only these three, and not Zhang Yan?</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>Qin Sang felt an overwhelming sense of foreboding.</p><p>Since entering this illusory realm, Qin Sang had witnessed increasingly unusual signs, and a feeling of unease had lingered in his heart.</p><p>He suspected this wasn't Liuli's mind demon at all!</p><p>The reason Zhan Yan and the others appeared, but not Zhang Yan, was because Zhang Yan had been trapped elsewhere and hadn't entered the illusory realm.</p><p>This meant that when the full moon reached its zenith, everyone in the illusory realm at that time might have been drawn in.  Only their portraits were displayed because they were human cultivators, and this was human territory.</p><p>At this very moment, in the territory of the Yi people, the Yuanxiang clan leader and others might also be wanted!</p><p>"Why has it become like this?"</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was in turmoil, but his expression remained calm.</p><p>He wore a grass cloak, his hands concealed within it.  Still uneasy, he subtly covered his iron ring on his right hand with his left.</p><p>The portrait only showed his face, not his whole body, but Qin Sang still worried about the Thousand-Jun Ring being recognized. He didn't know the consequences of his identity being discovered, but his intuition told him it wouldn't be good.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his previous experiences. Everything had gone smoothly since entering the illusionary realm.</p><p>Liuli's tribulation timing was precisely calculated by Master Ning.  Logically, he should have already entered Liuli's demonic tribulation; it seemed something unexpected had happened at the last moment.</p><p>"Where am I now?"</p><p>Thinking of the sacred mountain and the Cultivators from the Otherworld Race attracted by the ancestral relic, Qin Sang felt a growing sense of foreboding.</p><p>Hong Tian asked him to find the "seed"—could it be born within this illusion?</p><p>If it was caused by changes within the illusionary realm itself, Master Ning would have warned him.  Since Master Ning said nothing, it was likely due to the changes in the Sacred Land, the disturbances caused by those Otherworld Race Cultivators!</p><p>Liuli's demonic tribulation coincided with this event; therefore, he hadn't entered Liuli's tribulation but was instead swept into the illusion? Or perhaps, the illusion and Liuli's demonic tribulation had merged?</p><p>No one could answer Qin Sang, and he lacked the means to find out.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang wasn't worried about his own situation, but whether Liuli's demonic tribulation would also mutate, leading to unforeseen consequences!</p><p>The thought of the sacred mountain was even more unsettling.</p><p>The ancestor of the Otherworld Race ordered them to compete for positions on the sacred mountain, indicating that the mountain was related to this illusion, perhaps offering some protection or a way to escape.</p><p>But Liuli was undergoing her tribulation and had no time to refine the stone platform; she also had the lowest cultivation level.</p><p>If Liuli's demonic tribulation had truly merged with the illusion, it would be an unprecedented situation, and Qin Sang didn't know how to proceed.</p><p>The only good news was that Liuli, like him, had become someone else, avoiding recognition from the portrait. But who knew if the mastermind had other methods?</p><p>The mastermind posted portraits everywhere, perhaps unaware that they had possessed others, but the truth would eventually be discovered.</p><p>The illusion was unpredictable and unexpected. Qin Sang wasn't focused on finding the seed for Hong Tian, but on finding Liuli as soon as possible.</p><p>Contacting Hong Tian was impossible now. Hong Tian had clearly stated he would only act during the final struggle for the "seed."</p><p>'啪!'</p><p>A sharp pain in his shoulder broke Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Luan, having finally recovered his soul, tore his eyes away from the third portrait with difficulty and patted Qin Sang's shoulder. "Little brother, get better quickly. Once you're well, big brother will find you a wife just like that."</p><p>His boastful words drew laughter from his companions.</p><p>"Thank you, big brother."</p><p>Qin Sang managed a weak smile, pondering how to break the deadlock.</p><p>The wanted individuals were clearly cultivators. With his current identity, his room for maneuver was small; in the eyes of cultivators, he would easily reveal flaws.</p><p>A rainbow light streaked across the sky, but that cultivator might not have left; it could be a feint, with the person secretly watching everyone.</p><p>Based on his cultivation experience, finding a secluded place for seclusion would allow Qin Sang to easily sense spiritual energy, enter the path of cultivation, and drive away illness.</p><p>But he dared not cultivate rashly, nor leave the village without reason.  Suddenly becoming a cultivator, or disappearing inexplicably, would arouse the mastermind's suspicion. Even attracting a single Qi Condensation cultivator would mean certain capture.</p><p>There was no such thing as going to the capital for the imperial examinations; Xi wasn't a scholar. To leave Feng City, he would have to learn hunting from his father or become a merchant's apprentice.</p><p>It was said that trading caravans came to Feng City periodically, bringing novelties from outside the mountains, and recruiting apprentices. But following a caravan was no safer than hunting in the mountains; no one knew if there were any villains among them.</p><p>Regardless, he needed a healthy body. For now, he could only recover slowly and consider other options later.</p><p>Qin Sang thought so, feeling quite troubled.</p><p>The commander finished his announcement, leaving guards behind before returning to the city. The people, however, were captivated by the portraits, lingering long after.</p>
