Fortunately, the herb garden wasn't located too deep within the Vast Azure Swamp. Along the way, Qin Sang only encountered a few Xiaohan Region patrol squads and didn't run into any Heavenly March Alliance cultivators.</p><p>However, through contact with these patrols, Qin Sang could sense the tension in the situation.</p><p>In a vast expanse of water, a figure slowly emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang vigilantly looked around, but found no trace of enemies. He lowered his head to look at the calm water surface.</p><p>The lake water was clear, and the swimming fish were clearly visible.</p><p>Everything seemed perfectly normal. The surrounding spiritual energy showed no abnormalities, and there was no sign of any restrictions or formations.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, then formed a strange hand seal with his fingers and struck it towards the lake water.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>The splashing water was immediately smoothed over by Qin Sang.</p><p>As the hand seal fell into the water, the fish leisurely swimming in the lake suddenly disappeared, as if they were illusions. In their place, a huge black shadow appeared in Qin Sang's field of vision.</p><p>The shadow was long and narrow, like a giant whale, swimming in the depths of the water.</p><p>"Seems like I found the right place."</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, and before Qin Sang could continue, a sudden change occurred within the black shadow.</p><p>At the center of the shadow, a point of white light suddenly brightened. Then, violent fluctuations appeared across the entire shadow. Countless tiny white lights were born on the shadow, then quickly converged towards the center, merging into one.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the point of white light at the center of the shadow transformed, resembling the rudimentary form of a spirit sword.</p><p>The sword-shaped white light fluctuated unsteadily. With a slight shake, it pointed directly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Pointed at by the sword-shaped white light, and feeling the sharp aura it emanated, Qin Sang was secretly startled. The fellow disciples inside didn't say a word and directly activated the restriction.</p><p>Thinking of the current tense situation, Qin Sang understood and quickly took out his own identity token and Qi Yuanhu's secret order, sending them into the black shadow.</p><p>The secret order and identity token worked.</p><p>A moment later, the white light within the black shadow silently dispersed. Then, Qin Sang heard a few inquiries transmitted through sound. After answering them one by one, several figures flew out from the black shadow.</p><p>The leader was a cultivator at the middle stage of Foundation Establishment. Judging from his appearance, he was about fifty years old. Qin Sang recalled the contents of the jade slip and remembered that this person was the only middle stage Foundation Establishment cultivator guarding the herb garden, named Xie Ying.</p><p>Before the chaos, one middle stage Foundation Establishment disciple, along with a few Qi Refining disciples, combined with the original formations of the herb garden, was enough to defend this place.</p><p>Xie Ying flew out of the water with his people and arrived in front of Qin Sang. He cupped his hands with a slightly embarrassed tone and said, "I didn't know it was Senior Brother Qin. I have offended Senior Brother. It was my rudeness. I hope Senior Brother will forgive me!"</p><p>Xie Ying had broken through to Foundation Establishment a few years later than Qin Sang, so he should address Qin Sang as Senior Brother.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang was already at the late stage of Foundation Establishment, a level above him. Xie Ying was worried that Qin Sang might have an eccentric temperament and take his offense to heart.</p><p>"Junior Brother Xie."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the greeting, unconcernedly saying, "The situation is critical. Junior Brother's vigilance is justified. What offense is there to speak of? This is not a place for idle chatter. Let's go inside and talk."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang speak this way, Xie Ying was relieved and hurriedly invited Qin Sang into the herb garden.</p><p>Along the way, Xie Ying introduced the other disciples to Qin Sang, and Qin Sang greeted them one by one.</p><p>Besides Xie Ying, there was another early stage Foundation Establishment cultivator in the herb garden named Mao Ji, as well as ten Qi Refining disciples. This was determined by the characteristics of the herb garden's formation.</p><p>One middle stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, along with ten Qi Refining disciples, could unleash the full power of the formation to defend against enemies. The remaining Foundation Establishment cultivators could secretly leave and ask for reinforcements if the situation turned unfavorable.</p><p>The herb garden was built on an underwater island, which explained why it couldn't be seen from the outside.</p><p>The island was located ten fathoms underwater. It was long and narrow. The best location was used for growing spirit herbs. Aside from the herb garden, there were a few caves opened up by cultivators. The spiritual energy inside the caves was barely satisfactory.</p><p>The rest was wasteland, covered with aquatic plants and teeming with fish and shrimp.</p><p>"...Senior Brother Qin, these are all the arrangements of this herb garden. I wonder if Martial Uncle Qi has any instructions. Please instruct Senior Brother Qin. From now on, we will all follow Senior Brother Qin's lead."</p><p>Xie Ying took Qin Sang for a tour around the island before inquiring about his purpose. He readily relinquished authority and looked at Qin Sang with great anticipation.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang guessed Xie Ying's intentions.</p><p>Guarding the herb garden was originally a lucrative position. Not only could one cultivate peacefully, but when the spirit herbs matured and were submitted to the sect, one could also receive rewards from the sect.</p><p>This was just the apparent income.</p><p>However, in this situation, being stuck in the herb garden within the Vast Azure Swamp, unable to leave without the sect's orders, otherwise facing punishment, this assignment could very well cost one's life!</p><p>Xie Ying was eager for Qin Sang to replace him so that he could leave this place and return to the safety of the sect.</p><p>"How many years are left until the spirit herbs in the herb garden mature?" Qin Sang didn't directly address Xie Ying's words, instead asking a question.</p><p>Xie Ying was anxious, but patiently replied, "Reporting to Senior Brother Qin, the spirit herbs in the garden mature at different times. Due to this upheaval, the sect hasn't sent anyone to collect the herbs for a long time. Most of the spirit herbs can be harvested at any time. Only a few supplementary herbs for the Kanli Golden Elixir, the one with the longest maturity time, needs at least another ten years..."</p><p>This was also the reason for Xie Ying's anxiety.</p><p>The situation in the Vast Azure Swamp was growing tenser by the day.</p><p>During this period, he was restless and couldn't focus on cultivation. Hiding within the restrictions, he constantly paid attention to the outside and often saw cultivators flying past overhead, coming and going in a hurry.</p><p>No one knew when this taut string would snap.</p><p>"Ten years..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently. This time was indeed a bit long. However, Qi Yuanhu's order wasn't strict. As long as he could take away most of the spirit herbs, it would be enough to fulfill his duty.</p><p>He didn't keep them in suspense any longer and recounted Qi Yuanhu's secret order.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing Qin Sang's relay, Xie Ying was overjoyed and asked in disbelief, "Senior Brother Qin, is this true? Did Martial Uncle Qi really say that we don't need to worry about these spirit herbs and can withdraw at any time if we encounter danger?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned at Xie Ying. He didn't expect someone with such high cultivation to be so unable to contain his excitement. Displeased, he said, "What Martial Uncle Qi told me face-to-face, could it be false? What orders did you receive before?"</p><p>The excitement on Xie Ying's face couldn't be contained. He didn't notice Qin Sang's displeased tone. Upon hearing this, he cried out loudly, "Senior Brother Qin, you don't know. When we reported to the sect before, the order we received was for everyone to hold the island and wait for the sect's arrangements. As for the spirit herbs on the island, especially a spirit herb called the Seven-Leaf Daybloom, if even one plant is missing, we'll have to answer with our heads! I didn't even dare to tell Junior Brother Mao the truth..."</p>
