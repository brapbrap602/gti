<h1>Chapter 1550:  The Step-Heaven Technique</h1><p>While in the North Sea, the Ghost Mother forcibly entered the Xuan Tian Palace, the largest power in the region.</p><p>A Xuan Tian Palace traitor took advantage of the chaos to steal a sacred artifact, causing Tong Lingyu and others to search far and wide.</p><p>Could the Ghost Mother have come to Central Plains and done the same thing here?</p><p>Ganlu Temple has a Buddhist saint residing there. Even if Yin Changsheng is powerful, he couldn't be stronger than a true Nascent Soul cultivator. Based on previous information, the Ghost Mother's power shouldn't be enough to cause a disturbance in Ganlu Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed these thoughts and asked, "Did the monk see the person's face?"</p><p>Shao Xing, the monk, didn't speak. He raised his right hand, and the wooden bracelet on his wrist emitted a faint yellow light. A round bronze mirror appeared in his palm.</p><p>The bracelet is probably a mustard seed treasure similar to the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the bracelet and looked at the mirror.</p><p>He saw Shao Xing press his hand on the mirror. Thin streams of light emanated from the mirror's surface.  When Shao Xing removed his hand, a figure briefly appeared on the mirror's surface, then vanished.</p><p>It was less a figure and more a white blur.</p><p>Qin Sang looked twice, feeling somewhat speechless.</p><p>The most important part—the face—was completely invisible, as blurry as a ghost, making it impossible to see the person's features.</p><p>Ganlu Temple relies on this little bit of information to find the person?</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's doubt, Shao Xing adjusted the mirror, replaying the image and reminding him, "Friend, pay attention to the person's movement technique."</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely upon hearing this.</p><p>He finally noticed something unusual.</p><p>At the moment of disappearance, the figure stamped three times in mid-air, seemingly following a pattern.</p><p>Because it was a blurry image, the void's fluctuations couldn't be perceived. But with careful observation, one could discover a unique rhythm in these steps; it was quite extraordinary.</p><p>"The Abbot suspects the person used the long-lost top-tier escape technique from the Central Plains, the Step-Heaven Technique.  This technique is extremely difficult to master.  During the Foundation Establishment stage, one must prepare a unique medicinal liquid to soak their legs to facilitate cultivation. Those who cultivate this technique should also have high attainments in body refinement, possibly cultivating methods like the Golden Body Scripture. Before the Step-Heaven Technique is mastered, the cultivator will exhibit extraordinary abilities in escape techniques, leaving traces, and emitting a special medicinal fragrance..."</p><p>Then, Shao Xing demonstrated several characteristics of the Step-Heaven Technique.</p><p>Qin Sang greatly admired the Abbot of Ganlu Temple. Based on a blurry image, he had managed to analyze so many clues.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang thought it was unlikely to be the Ghost Mother.</p><p>He feigned a thoughtful expression, pondered for a moment, and shook his head. "This Daoist hasn't seen such a person before. Does the monk have any other information? Perhaps we can start from the person's motives."</p><p>Shao Xing hesitated for a moment, then said, "This person secretly infiltrated the temple and was discovered by a junior monk. But the person's stealth and escape techniques were excellent, allowing them to escape the monk.  This image is based on the junior monk's recollection. Also, the junior monk had another observation, but only with less than 10% certainty, and he worried it might be misleading. At the moment of exposure, a high-level spirit insect seemed to flash by, suggesting mastery of insect control."</p><p>Spirit insects!</p><p>Hearing those words, Qin Sang's heart immediately tensed.</p><p>Involving insect control, perhaps no one is more proficient than the Ghost Mother.</p><p>"Could it be her?  It's unbelievable that someone dared to infiltrate Ganlu Temple. This style of action is indeed very similar to the Ghost Mother.  The Step-Heaven Technique might just be a distraction; it's difficult for others to imitate, but the Ghost Mother might be able to…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>However…</p><p>Mastering escape techniques, practicing body refinement, and keeping spirit insects.</p><p>It sounds more and more like her.</p><p>While secretly calculating, Qin Sang remained calm.  He wanted to ask about any losses suffered by Ganlu Temple, but seeing Shao Xing unwilling to disclose, he suppressed his curiosity and promised, "This Daoist will immediately contact Daoist Qin and ask him to pay attention."</p><p>Shao Xing stood up and chanted a Buddhist invocation. "Thank you for your efforts, fellow Daoists. If the culprit is caught, the temple will offer a generous reward! This monk must consult with other fellow Daoists and cannot stay long. I will visit the Daoist again later."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't persuade him to stay and personally escorted Shao Xing out of the mountain gate, confirming contact information.</p><p>Shao Xing invited Qin Sang to visit the temple, and Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>If there is the slightest possibility that this person is the Ghost Mother, he must intervene and seize the opportunity. Even if it’s not the Ghost Mother, he can use this opportunity to forge a good relationship with Ganlu Temple.</p><p>After Shao Xing left, Lu Zhang remained.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he had something to say.</p><p>The two watched the monk leave and returned to the main hall.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't beat around the bush with Lu Zhang, asking directly, "Ganlu Temple suffered significant losses?"</p><p>It's worth pondering: if this person is the Ghost Mother, what was their purpose in infiltrating Ganlu Temple?</p><p>Lu Zhang seemed deep in thought, pausing before shaking his head. "Ganlu Temple has kept the matter extremely secret; no verifiable information can be found. I've tried asking several times, but Abbot Xiaoxing remained tight-lipped."</p><p>Give it time; some clues will eventually surface.</p><p>Qin Sang dropped the subject, changing the topic.  "Do you have a close relationship with Abbot Xiaoxing?"</p><p>"Are you asking about Bunian Mountain and Ganlu Temple?"</p><p>Lu Zhang smiled. "The Central Plains once saw significant conflict between Buddhism and Daoism. However, today, the lines are far less distinct. This is most evident in the Western Seven States, where many sects show a blend of Buddhist and Daoist influences.  The further one goes towards the edges of the Nineteen Rain States, the more eclectic the traditions become—Buddhism, Devilry, Daoism, unorthodox practices; it's hard to distinguish them. Bunian Mountain has many disciples who also cultivate Buddhist abilities with considerable success. You might try it yourself sometime; cross-referencing can be beneficial.  The Eight Scenic Spots have the standing to rival Ganlu Temple, competing for the title of foremost Immortal Dao sect. We must, of course, remain flexible and adaptable. As for disputes over orthodox lineages, it's been a long time since anyone mentioned them."</p><p>What Lu Zhang said aligned with Qin Sang's observations.  After learning of the rise of Buddhism and Daoism in the Central Plains, Qin Sang had expected a sharp division.</p><p>But the reality was vastly different.</p><p>Except for some cruel and ruthless demonic sects huddled in the Northern Wastelands, the various traditions in the Central States lacked clear boundaries, blending seamlessly and existing almost indistinguishably, their conflicts only arising from competition for advantage.</p><p>If even scriptures aren't studied, how can there be talk of orthodox lineages?</p><p>Eventually, perhaps they will truly merge.</p><p>Of course, this is partly due to the stability of the Central Plains.  If great chaos were to erupt, no one could guarantee what would happen; those of the same path would naturally become allies.</p><p>As long as the will of the Nascent Soul cultivators remains, the Central Plains will not fall into disorder.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Zhang changed the subject. "When did you, Daoist Master, leave the East Sea to travel the Central Plains?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, sensing something amiss. "It's been nearly a hundred years.  However, even in the East Sea, I spent most of my time in seclusion, rarely venturing out. My Qingyang Island is east of the Northern Wastelands, quite remote, and my access to news is limited.  Did you hear something, Daoist Lu?"</p><p>For fifty years, Qin Sang rarely left Mount Pu.</p><p>Lu Zhang nodded. "I recalled something—it must have been less than two hundred years ago—a rumour surfaced that someone sighted someone resembling the Holy One Huiguang in the outer seas. Shortly afterward, a violent storm raged across the deep sea, a tempest of thunder and lightning, far worse than the storm belt, exactly where the Holy One Huiguang was heading.  The rumours were vague and untraceable, with several versions claiming that someone, or even several people, accompanied the Holy One Huiguang. "</p><p>Pausing, Lu Zhang continued, "The rumours didn't cause much of a stir; no one believed a Holy One would be defeated by a mere storm.  It was dismissed as idle gossip, attracting little attention. The rumours only spread within the East Sea before vanishing.  I only heard of it by chance. After Abbot Xiaoxing's visit, I suddenly remembered the rumour and investigated further. Based on Ganlu Temple's behavior, I suspect the individual infiltrated their forbidden area—Xiaofangcun Mountain!"</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Lu Zhang said gravely, "The meditation hall where Holy One Huiguang practiced is located on that mountain!"</p><p>"Hmph…"</p><p>Qin Sang understood what Lu Zhang truly meant.</p><p>"The one who accompanied Holy One Huiguang… could it be…"</p><p>Lu Zhang neither confirmed nor denied this, merely stating, "Interestingly, after that, both Holy One Huiguang and True Monarch Danyu have not appeared publicly, remaining in seclusion."</p><p>"Over a hundred years ago… over a hundred years ago…"</p><p>Qin Sang got up and paced.</p><p>Lu Zhang assumed Qin Sang was pondering the impact of two missing Nascent Soul cultivators on the cultivation world.</p><p>In reality, Qin Sang was thinking about something else.</p><p>What drew Holy One Huiguang and True Monarch Danyu to the outer seas?</p><p>The Heavenly Concord, Heavenly Aspect, Seven Kill, and Purple Micro Palaces are linked by the fragments of the Earth-Killing Sword.</p><p>To those unaware, after Ye Laomo and Qingjun ascended with the Purple Micro Palace, didn't they essentially vanish?</p><p>Qin Sang pressed further, but since it had been so long, Lu Zhang hadn't taken it seriously back then, dismissing it with a laugh and not conducting a thorough investigation, unable to recall the exact time and location.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, Lu Zhang stood up, his tone enigmatic.  "Let's wait and see when Ganlu Temple apprehends the culprit. Otherwise, the credibility of that rumor will significantly increase, and I'm certainly not the only one who remembers it."</p><p>Unless the Saint Hui Guang or Master Dan Yu personally address the rumors, chaos will engulf Central Plains!”</p><p>Sighing softly, Lu Zhang turned and left.</p><p>Qin Sang, regaining his composure, quickly escorted him out of the mountains.</p><p>Returning, Qin Sang sat in the grand hall, lost in thought for a long time, before returning to the Qingxu Illusionary Realm.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang’s manifestation no longer stayed in the cave dwelling, frequently venturing out.  Sometimes he would disguise himself, other times openly visit Abbot Xiaoxing, seeking information about the Ganlu Temple.</p><p>The purpose of helping Ganlu Temple find the missing person is not something to be revealed to outsiders.</p><p>His strength alone was limited.</p><p>Whether it was due to Ganlu Temple’s lack of progress or their tight security, Qin Sang failed to obtain useful information. He couldn’t even find out the mysterious person’s intentions for infiltrating the temple.</p><p>During this period, Qin Sang traveled extensively in the Central Plains, especially the six states of Jiangzuo.  He witnessed the true grandeur of the immortal cultivators, understanding why the immortal dao flourished so much in the Central Plains.</p><p>Spiritual veins are also known as dragon veins in the Central Plains.  With dragons traversing the Central Plains, the six states of Jiangzuo are where countless dragons converge.</p><p>However, beneath this prosperity lay hidden dangers.</p><p>Lu Zhang’s earlier concerns proved true.</p><p>Ganlu Temple’s activities attracted the attention of those with ulterior motives, and old rumors were quickly resurrected. After all, for high-level cultivators, a hundred years isn't an exceptionally long time.</p><p>The rumors spread with alarming speed, becoming increasingly rampant.</p><p>For a time, the entire land was watching the movements of the two major sects.</p><p>Interestingly, the Eight Sceneries remained silent throughout.</p><p>Ganlu Temple, seemingly aware that they had inadvertently caused a major upheaval, became cautious in their search for the mysterious person.</p><p>The rumors intensified, yet Master Dan Yu and Saint Hui Guang remained elusive, with both major sects offering no response.</p><p>To outsiders, this was tantamount to an admission.</p><p>For many years, the Central Plains had enjoyed stability, and no immediate signs of unrest were visible.</p><p>But veteran experts like Qin Sang understood clearly: without the presence of Nascent Soul cultivators, the greatest deterrent was lost, tempting those with malicious intent to act.</p><p>Qin Sang strictly forbade the Xie family and Loutai Sect disciples from leaving Fudou County, and he himself became more cautious in his actions.</p><p>This incident made gathering information about Ganlu Temple even more difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang searched relentlessly.</p><p>Years later, he learned that several of Ganlu Temple’s holy monks had traveled to the Western Desert.</p><p>By the time he received this news, the monks had already returned. It was uncertain whether Saint Hui Guang was among them, and Ganlu Temple ceased their search, closing its doors.</p><p>Qin Sang could only hope that the Ghost Mother had not been killed by Ganlu Temple.</p><p>…</p><p>In the blink of an eye, over twenty years passed since Abbot Xiaoxing’s visit to Pushan.</p><p>The main body remained focused on cultivation.</p><p>After failing to find the missing person, the manifestation also returned to the mountain for seclusion.</p><p>On the Fu River, a treasure ship sailed out of the harbor.</p><p>Entering the East Sea from the calm river, it immediately encountered turbulent waves.</p><p>At this moment, countless runes lit up on the ship's bottom, bathing the entire hull in a green glow. The wooden hull instantly became vibrant green, like it had been reborn.</p><p>This light was not only beautiful but also provided protection. The impact of the waves was absorbed by the green light, the ship trembled slightly before regaining its stability, unaffected by the turmoil.</p><p>“Hmm, the talisman array engraved on the hull. The ship isn't made of spirit wood, but coated with a special paint that absorbs true essence, sustained by spirit stones. Similar to Beihai's methods...”</p><p>In the upper cabin, a person leaned against the window, gazing out at the distant sea, yet completely aware of the changes beneath the ship.</p><p>This person, with a feather fan and Confucian scholar's attire, had the demeanor of a refined young gentleman.</p><p>It was Qin Sang's external manifestation.</p><p>Unable to find the Ghost Mother, Qin Sang turned his attention elsewhere.</p><p>This sea voyage was to find the source of the rumors, hoping to uncover something.</p><p>The ship belonged to a merchant guild. With its talisman array at full power, it could withstand the onslaught of sea storms.  Cultivators were also onboard for protection.</p><p>While not top-tier like those in the Six States Hall, its advantage was its long-range capabilities, reaching the edge of the inner sea.</p><p>Upon entering the East Sea, numerous treasure ships came into view.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense, without any effort, that nearly every ship held cultivators on board.</p><p>"It was always like this? Or have even those outside the Central Plains seen an opportunity and flocked here?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p>
