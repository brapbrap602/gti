Chapter 323: The Mind-Calming Fruit


After issuing the warning, Gao Yi didn't waste words and directly announced the start of the auction.
At this time, a slender young woman emerged from the darkness at the rear, carrying a square tray simply covered with a red cloth.
But everyone was awed by Gao Yi, and no one dared to secretly activate their spiritual sense to peek, patiently waiting for his announcement.
After a sufficient display of formality, Gao Yi lifted the red cloth.
“The first item of this auction is a high-grade magic weapon, the Bloodflame Trident!”
As the red cloth was lifted, a trident-shaped magic weapon appeared in everyone's sight. The entire weapon was blood-red, with two very sharp prongs, only about the size of an adult's palm. However, everyone understood that this wasn't its true form.
Once activated, it certainly wouldn't remain this small.
Qin Sang also knew this was the auction's rule: the quality of the treasures would gradually increase, leading up to the final, most significant item, which would mark the auction's climax.
By then, everyone's emotions would be thoroughly aroused.
The first item was only a high-grade magic weapon, but no one showed any disappointment. For Foundation Establishment cultivators, spirit treasures were something they dared not even dream of, especially for independent cultivators. Most were lucky to possess one or two top-grade magic weapons, and high-grade weapons were their most common tools.
The three who had ambushed Qin Sang were no exception.
The young man in tight-fitting clothes owned two top-grade magic weapons—a Seven-Colored Parasol and a flying sword—but their quality was among the lowest of top-grade weapons.  They could fetch at most 1500 low-grade spirit stones combined, less than the scar-faced man's flying sword.
The scar-faced man had only recently broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.  His expenses on the medicinal herbs for the breakthrough had been enormous, leaving him only with this flying sword and a Thunderclap Talisman as a trump card.
He had thought that killing Qin Sang, a disciple of Mount Shao Hua, would bring a huge profit, but instead, he lost his life.
Yu Dayue, though also striving for a breakthrough, was a sect disciple after all, and his resources were thicker than the scar-faced man's. His flying sword and octagonal bronze mirror were both mid-to-high quality top-grade magic weapons, each worth over 2000 low-grade spirit stones.
Of course, these were just estimates; the actual trading price would fluctuate greatly depending on the magic weapon's effectiveness and the buyer's and seller's needs.
For example, the scar-faced man's flying sword was an exceptionally rare spiritual sword, the most valuable type of weapon. If the right buyer were found, selling it for 5000 low-grade spirit stones wouldn't be impossible.
Qin Sang silently estimated his own resources while listening to Gao Yi's introduction.
“The Bloodflame Trident, once activated, projects thousands of phantom tridents, serving as a distraction while the real weapon remains hidden among the illusions. Of course, if that were all, the Bloodflame Trident wouldn't be here. Its true killing power lies in the poisonous fire sealed within. Once an opponent's spiritual energy touches it, the poisonous fire clings like a leech, instantly spreading throughout the body…”
Qin Sang silently thought, "As expected," High-grade magic weapons worthy of being auctioned weren't simple.  Thanks to the sealed poisonous fire, the Bloodflame Trident was worth no less than the young man's flying sword.
Gao Yi explained and demonstrated the Bloodflame Trident's abilities.  Finally, the phantom tridents vanished, and Gao Yi returned the weapon to the tray. “The owner of the Bloodflame Trident has set the starting price at 500 low-grade spirit stones, or a magic weapon with concealment properties!”
Exchanging the Bloodflame Trident for a concealment weapon. It seems the Trident's owner also understands the importance of self-preservation. However, concealment weapons are even more valuable; Qin Sang didn't think he'd be able to make the trade.
As soon as Gao Yi finished speaking, someone immediately bid.
“550 low-grade spirit stones…”
“580…”
Unexpectedly, the price quickly rose to 1300 low-grade spirit stones before the bidding slowed.
Qin Sang's prediction was correct; everyone unanimously used spirit stones to bid; no one offered a magic weapon in exchange.
“1700 low-grade spirit stones!”
After several bids, only a few people remained in contention. A cultivator in a brocade robe suddenly increased the bid by 200 spirit stones, then bowed slightly, smiling and saying, “I happen to need such a weapon, and this is my limit. If any fellow cultivators wish to continue bidding, I will withdraw.”
This price far exceeded Gao Yi's expectations.
The high price of the first item was a great start, filling Gao Yi's tone with surprise. “This cultivator bids 1700 low-grade spirit stones. Are there any other cultivators willing to bid higher, or offer a concealment-type magic weapon of equivalent value?”
No one responded.
Gao Yi waited for a moment before announcing that the Bloodflame Trident belonged to the cultivator in the brocade robe.
After that, treasure after treasure was auctioned off, and the atmosphere of the auction finally became intense, with some items sparking fiercely competitive bidding and skyrocketing prices.
Qin Sang, with a clear goal in mind, remained calm. He had participated in two bidding rounds for promising magic weapons, but after considering his resources, he chose to give up.
“Mind-Calming Fruit!”
Gao Yi's voice was filled with excitement and allure as he dramatically lifted the red cloth, revealing a purple fruit on the tray.


This fruit resembles a plum, its skin exceptionally thin, revealing a seemingly flowing liquid inside.  A magical seal prevents the medicinal properties from dissipating.

Seeing the Xinming Fruit, Qin Sang's eyes flickered.

He had heard of the Xinming Fruit from Yun Youzi; it nurtures a cultivator's spiritual soul.  Furthermore, it aids in recovery if a cultivator's soul is injured. Yun Youzi himself had once taken one, though it proved ineffective for him.

Qin Sang, protected by his jade Buddha, didn't need it. He leaned back, ready to watch the show.

At that moment, Qin Sang unexpectedly noticed the burly man in the corner suddenly sit up straight, clutching his thighs, his eyes fixed on the Xinming Fruit.

Even with a mask, Qin Sang could sense his excitement.

The auction had progressed thus far without a word from the burly man.  His first action showed impatience.

Could he have a soul injury?

Qin Sang discreetly observed him, feeling it unlikely.

"The Xinming Fruit, starting bid one thousand low-grade spirit stones, or a flying sword-type magical artifact."

As Gao Yi finished speaking, the burly man suddenly shouted anxiously, "Can it only be exchanged for a flying sword and spirit stones?  Can other medicinal herbs be used?"

Gao Yi's brow furrowed slightly. He said sternly, "The owner of the Xinming Fruit only accepts spirit stones and flying swords. If you don't have a flying sword but desire the fruit, you can show your medicinal herbs and exchange them with other attendees..."

This was a long-standing rule of the auction; transactions between attendees would be witnessed by Gao Yi, at the cost of a commission for him.

Immediately, a person in a black robe asked, "I wonder what medicinal herbs you possess? If they're valuable enough, I can help you acquire the Xinming Fruit and exchange it with you."

Qin Sang's heart stirred and he also sent a voice transmission to the burly man.

He had three spirit swords; if the man's medicinal herbs were valuable enough, he might bid on the Xinming Fruit.

Seeing the burly man's eagerness, many, hoping to snag a bargain, were privately communicating with him.
