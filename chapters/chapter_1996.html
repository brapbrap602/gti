<h1>Chapter 1987 Annihilation Yang Corpse Canon</h1><p>Qin Sang thought of Qing Yuan.</p><p>The other party's elucidation of the Lesser Vehicle and Greater Vehicle paths had brought Qin Sang sudden enlightenment, allowing him to finally find the gateway.</p><p>This descent from the mountain for enlightenment had yielded satisfactory results.</p><p>Xiao Wu, having experienced worldly affairs, now had his human nature suppressing his demonic nature.  From now on, he only needed to gradually erode the demonic intent, and his transformation was just around the corner.</p><p>Although it was an unorthodox approach, Qin Sang had finally grasped the Dao of the *Purple Subtlety Sword Canon*.</p><p>He wondered if Qing Yuan had spoken so much to introduce the Dao Court or if he had discerned Qin Sang's confusion and bottleneck, specifically offering guidance.</p><p>Although after a period of contemplation and interaction with other experts in the vast world, Qin Sang would have eventually understood, he couldn't help but acknowledge Qing Yuan's kindness.</p><p>The vast world was boundless, and the road ahead was unpredictable.  He didn't know if they would ever meet again.</p><p>"Greater Vehicle."</p><p>These two words churned in Qin Sang's mind, lingering persistently.</p><p>Ordinary people found it difficult to imagine that there could be a Greater Vehicle Path of Slaughter in this world.</p><p>Qin Sang initially also found it somewhat absurd, but upon closer inspection, it wasn't entirely without precedent.</p><p>Through the *Purple Subtlety Sword Canon*, one could glimpse the changes in the Purple Subtlety Sword Sovereign's state of mind and the trajectory of his cultivation.</p><p>It could be roughly divided into two stages, with the Nascent Soul realm as the boundary.</p><p>Before Nascent Soul, killing intent condensed into Slaughter Talismans, his killing nature overflowing.</p><p>After experiencing the confusion of the Nascent Soul period and breaking through to the Deity Transformation realm, he sheathed his sword and was able to control his killing heart, no longer the Slaughter Star who only knew killing.</p><p>However, it was intriguing to ponder why the Purple Subtlety Sword Sovereign comprehended the Greater Vehicle Path of Slaughter and what he had experienced.</p><p>At the Deity Transformation stage, he was still striving to suppress his killing nature, yet at the Void Refinement stage, he was able to transcend slaughter. This was a truly earth-shattering change.</p><p>Even more puzzling, if the Purple Subtlety Sword Sovereign was motivated by protecting all living beings, why did he end up with his pavilion shattered, his sword broken, and the whole world as his enemy?</p><p>Now, the Purple Subtlety Sword Sovereign was missing, his forces scattered like stars and clouds, and his enemies still wouldn't let them go. Even he, the 'successor,' had to live in hiding.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure it out, but he wasn't anxious.</p><p>From this day forward, he would step onto the stage openly and interact with the major powers of the vast world, believing that he would eventually uncover some secrets.</p><p>The strength of the Dao Court and the Purple Subtlety Sword Pavilion was unfathomable. They must have been significant powers in the vast world, and even in decline, they would have left traces.</p><p>Unlessâ€¦</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Formless Immortal Sect of the Middle Continent, erased from history by the combined forces of Daoism and Buddhism, and he was no longer so certain.</p><p>A myriad of thoughts flashed through his mind, quickly suppressed by Qin Sang.  Excessive contemplation was futile; the most important thing was his own cultivation.</p><p>The return of the Dao Court and the Purple Subtlety Sword Pavilion was a game between mighty figures.</p><p>Without sufficient strength, he would be just a pawn, like those swept along by the currents in this upheaval.</p><p>When that day came, even the Purple Subtlety Child would probably abandon him.</p><p>Sighing inwardly, Qin Sang saw Yu Lang standing outside the square, hesitating to approach, and beckoned him over.</p><p>Yu Lang's mind echoed with Qin Sang's words, understanding yet not fully grasping their meaning.  He composed himself and stepped forward, bowing, "Greetings, Master."</p><p>He understood that Daoist Qing Feng might be an avatar or something similar, but he felt that his master's words held a deeper meaning that he couldn't comprehend.</p><p>Looking at the unfamiliar master before him, Yu Lang's thoughts were in turmoil, still deeply shaken.</p><p>From his senior sister's reaction, he had guessed that his master was strong, but he hadn't expected him to be *this* powerful.</p><p>A single decree, and the mortal world was overturned!</p><p>Immortal Master Yun, from Cloud Capital Heaven, had left a sound transmission talisman for Tao Teng and fled back to Cloud Capital Mountain, not daring to show his face since.</p><p>The various sects of the Yan Kingdom's cultivation world had all retreated to their mountains, sealing their gates and closing their doors, distancing themselves from the mortal realm.</p><p>Brother Sha and Tao Teng didn't dare enter the city, waiting anxiously outside.</p><p>His master's words were like heavenly decrees.</p><p>The chessboard had been overturned, yet the Void Refinement ancestors of the Fallen Soul Abyss and Cloud Capital Heaven had remained unseen, seemingly acquiescing.</p><p>He didn't yet know that Patriarch Ming Hu had fallen and that the Fallen Soul Abyss was in turmoil, otherwise, he would have been even more shocked.</p><p>"You should return to the mountain," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yu Lang was startled for a moment, then replied, "This disciple obeys."</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Yu Lang sensed something and looked towards the north, where he saw a procession of ceremonial guards escorting a palanquin from the imperial city.</p><p>Soldiers cleared the way, separating the common people. Civil and military officials followed closely behind, with only him, the Prime Minister, missing.</p><p>The procession arrived before the stone statue, seemingly oblivious to them standing there.</p><p>Master must have used some sort of illusion, Yu Lang thought, then his expression turned to astonishment.</p><p>He saw them set up an altar before the statue with offerings of three sacrificial animals.  The emperor personally led the civil and military officials in worship, reciting sacrificial texts. The ceremony was even grander than the grand ceremony to Heaven.</p><p>The great affairs of the state lay in sacrifices and military campaigns.</p><p>Sacrificial rites had always been of paramount importance, and Yu Lang was no stranger to them.</p><p>Now, the Yan Kingdom was using the rites of Heaven to worship his master's statue!</p><p>The sacrificial text contained phrases like 'acting on behalf of Heaven,' 'cleansing demonic miasma,' 'guarding the mortal realm,' and 'sage of the world.'</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't help but glance at his master.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone with divine light as he looked beyond the city, his gaze seemingly sweeping across the entire mortal realm.</p><p>At the same moment, identical ceremonies were taking place in all the mortal kingdoms. This would replace the grand ceremony to Heaven, becoming customary, an annual event, with the sacrificial text circulated throughout the world!</p><p>Daoist Qing Feng's meritorious deeds were known to everyone in the mortal realm.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit wandered beyond the physical world.</p><p>As the sacrificial ceremony progressed, Qin Sang faintly felt a certain indefinable connection forming between himself and those statues.</p><p>There wasn't a significant improvement in his cultivation, but using it to verify his cultivation method, his understanding became slightly clearer.</p><p>Qin Sang's face remained impassive, and he felt no particular joy.</p><p>In this battle, only Patriarch Ming Hu had fallen. Qin Sang had merely verbally warned Gu Yun Sou, and presumably, Cloud Capital Heaven wouldn't dare interfere in the mortal realm again.</p><p>The mortal realm would be *his* mortal realm.</p><p>When he descended the mountain, Qin Sang hadn't anticipated that he would step forward so quickly, wresting a territory from the jaws of two major powers.</p><p>Moreover, this territory was the least valuable in the vicinity.</p><p>He also hadn't anticipated that this would be his place of enlightenment.</p><p>If this was his Dao, and it stemmed from his heart, continuing on this path would surely lead to some accomplishment, and his future cultivation of the *Purple Subtlety Sword Canon* would be much smoother.</p><p>But was he willing?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his path of cultivation.</p><p>When he first cultivated the *Purple Subtlety Sword Canon*, back then it was called the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter*, and the compatibility between him and this cultivation method was far from ideal.</p><p>Relying on the Jade Buddha, he had reached this point step by step, but the rift had grown wider and wider.</p><p>Before today, Qin Sang believed he would follow the path of the Purple Subtlety Sword Sovereign, continuing to use the *Purple Subtlety Sword Canon* as his fundamental cultivation method, eager to obtain the latter half of the sword canon.</p><p>Suddenly, he wasn't so eager anymore.</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean that Qin Sang would give up searching for the latter half of the sword canon. Even if he changed his cultivation method, the *Purple Subtlety Sword Canon*, a top-tier cultivation method in this world, would still be the best reference.</p><p>"I plan to build sixty-four branch temples in the mortal realm, along with the main temple, and I'll leave their management to you.</p><p>"Each branch temple will have a guardian spirit beast for the time being.  There's no need to rush to recruit disciples. I'll have Tai Yi and the others disperse throughout the mortal realm, searching for children with exceptional talent and virtuous character to bring into the sect.</p><p>"My words were not empty.</p><p>"Green Goat Temple will be responsible for overseeing the world.  From now on, all sects and powers in the mortal realm, big or small, will be under our control, to prevent anyone from paying lip service while defying in secret, disrupting the mortal realm."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>The mortal realm was now settled.</p><p>Green Goat Temple overseeing the world couldn't be accomplished with just an empty shell.  Human hearts were fickle, and deterrence could only last for a while.</p><p>From this point on, Green Goat Temple would truly take root in the vast world.</p><p>Yu Lang listened respectfully to Qin Sang's instructions, his expression gradually becoming serious.</p><p>His master had driven away Cloud Capital Heaven and the Fallen Soul Abyss, awing the cultivation world, and from now on, cultivators were forbidden from interfering in the mortal realm. This was precisely what he had aspired to; how could he be unwilling?</p><p>But this responsibility was a heavy one.</p><p>Overseeing the world was not comparable to a small Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang added, "With Tai Yi and the others assisting, and the divine path acting as oversight, you don't need to attend to every matter personally.  Focus on your cultivation."</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had used his disciple's heart to understand the Dao, allowing Yu Lang to descend the mountain and experience the world before his cultivation was complete, without urging him to cultivate.</p><p>Yu Lang had talent and a rare steadfast Dao heart. Qin Sang didn't want to see this disciple live a mediocre life.</p><p>"Master's painstaking efforts, this disciple will keep in mind."</p><p>Yu Lang took a deep breath and nodded heavily.</p><p>His master had taught him a valuable lesson through words and actions.  Without his master, he would be merely a pawn, struggling in the murky currents, any ambition nothing but empty talk, all his passion ultimately in vain.</p><p>Only someone like his master could deter the wicked and restore a bright and righteous world to the mortal realm!</p><p>His heart filled with gratitude for his master, he believed his master's shocking actions were solely to enlighten him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disillusion him.  He watched the entire sacrificial ceremony with Yu Lang and then left alone, his whereabouts unknown.</p><p>Yu Lang remained in the Yan Kingdom, appearing in the imperial court to resign from his official position.  He summoned Sha Jia Yu to the city and, taking his family with him, returned to the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled among the clouds, heading west.  He wasn't in a hurry, seemingly inspecting the mortal realm.</p><p>As he traveled, a purple light shot towards him from the front.</p><p>Qin Sang caught it in his hand and saw it was a purple bamboo slip.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>The purple bamboo slip spontaneously ignited without fire, transmitting Gu Yun Sou's voice.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>West of Twilight Fall Mountain.</p><p>On the plains, long ravines stretched, their depths unfathomable.</p><p>This was originally the Fallen Soul Abyss's mountain gate, Patriarch Ming Hu's domain.</p><p>Now, white clouds floated above the ravines, densely packed with numerous figures.</p><p>This group had sword-like eyebrows and star-like eyes, clad in snow-white robes, their auras clear and free of demonic qi.</p><p>At the center of the cloud cluster, nine figures sat or stood upon a cloud.  They were the Nine Immortals of Cloud Capital.</p><p>The Nine Immortals of Cloud Capital had expressions of excitement mixed with deep perplexity, occasionally glancing upwards.</p><p>Where the other disciples couldn't see, Gu Yun Sou, the Supreme Patriarch of Cloud Capital Heaven, sat in meditation on a cloud, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>"Why has Master entered meditation at this time?"</p><p>A female cultivator among the Nine Immortals of Cloud Capital asked in a low voice.</p><p>Everyone looked towards Yun Xi. Yun Xi shook his head slightly, indicating that he didn't know either.</p><p>The Nine Immortals of Cloud Capital exchanged puzzled glances.</p><p>Patriarch Ming Hu had left the mountain to seize a treasure, and they had fled in panic. Then they had encountered the heavenly changes and a series of other events.</p><p>Just as the Nine Immortals were at a loss, their master had arrived belatedly, finally calming their minds.</p><p>Unexpectedly, their master had ordered them to mobilize the entire sect's strength to eradicate the corpse demons of the Fallen Soul Abyss.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were utterly shocked, but they didn't dare disobey.  To their surprise, the subsequent eradication went exceptionally smoothly.</p><p>Their master personally took action, capturing the Fallen Soul Abyss's top experts with ease.</p><p>The remaining disciples were scattered and posed no threat.  Most of their efforts were spent pursuing deserters.</p><p>Until their mountain gate was attacked, Patriarch Ming Hu hadn't appeared to intervene, which spoke volumes.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were both surprised and delighted.</p><p>Delighted that Cloud Capital Heaven had finally eliminated this mortal enemy, and surprised at why Patriarch Ming Hu had fallen.</p><p>Their master's cultivation level was no secret. It was said that Patriarch Ming Hu was cultivating a powerful divine ability. Even if their master had broken through to the mid-Void Refinement stage, defeating Patriarch Ming Hu would be possible, but killing him would be difficult.</p><p>If the weeds weren't eradicated, Cloud Capital Heaven absolutely couldn't withstand Patriarch Ming Hu's furious revenge.</p><p>Thus, both sides were sworn enemies, but neither wanted to push things to the point of no return.</p><p>Their master had relentlessly eradicated the Fallen Soul Abyss, which meant Patriarch Ming Hu must have fallen.  Could that mysterious person who issued the decree be a helper invited by their master?</p><p>These past few days, everyone in Cloud Capital Heaven, from top to bottom, had been exceptionally excited.  Just as they were about to completely wipe out the Fallen Soul Abyss, their master had ordered them to stop, without explanation.</p><p>Morale had begun to wane.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou wasn't in meditation at this moment; he was still thinking about that day's events.</p><p>The Daoist had declared his intention to protect the mortal realm, and Gu Yun Sou's heart had skipped a beat, thinking he would be attacked next.</p><p>After all, the cause of the chaos in the mortal realm was the two great sects using it as a chessboard for their game, and Cloud Capital Heaven couldn't escape responsibility.</p><p>He, Gu Yun Sou, was also one of the masterminds behind it.</p><p>Fortunately, the Daoist had spared him in the end, only demanding that Cloud Capital Heaven eradicate the demonic cultivators, leaving no survivors.</p><p>The Daoist hadn't sent anyone to monitor them.  Gu Yun Sou, being tactful, ordered his disciples to hand over all the relics of Corpse Demons above the Deity Transformation realm after killing them.</p><p>As for the treasures within the Fallen Soul Abyss's mountain gate, Gu Yun Sou didn't dare keep them for himself and invited the Daoist to come and collect them personally.</p><p>Otherwise, a bolt of lightning would probably strike Cloud Capital Heaven on the spot.</p><p>From that brief glimpse, Gu Yun Sou couldn't see through the altar formation's details. He wasn't sure how far the formation could attack, or how many thunderbolts it could unleash. How could he dare offend Qin Sang?</p><p>During this period, Gu Yun Sou had considered all the sects, including the Clear Sky Sect, but couldn't figure out the Daoist's origin.</p><p>He had appeared as if out of thin air, yet he acted with such confidence.</p><p>Indeed, he had the capital to be confident.</p><p>Body and Dharma cultivation, a Postnatal Spirit Treasure, a Sword Domain, and the altar formation. All signs indicated that the sect behind the Daoist must be incredibly powerful, or at the very least, he had a highly skilled master.</p><p>Perhaps even a Body Integration stage grandmaster!</p><p>Without the personal guidance of a Body Integration stage grandmaster, how could he have comprehended the Sword Domain at the early Void Refinement stage?  How could he have a spirit servant brewing tea for him?</p><p>Every time he thought of this, Gu Yun Sou felt uneasy.</p><p>If he were alone, he could flee to a distant land, but relocating a sect wasn't so simple, and he couldn't abandon the sect's foundation.</p><p>The mortal realm had been occupied by the Daoist, with so many altar formations set up.  Expecting him to leave on his own was impossible.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou's headache was how to manage the relationship between them.  He now only hoped that the power behind the Daoist wouldn't clash with the Clear Sky Sect.</p><p>If two great powers fought, the tiny Cloud Capital Heaven caught in the middle would only be crushed to dust.</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>Gu Yun Sou sighed inwardly, sensing the Daoist approaching, and rose to greet him.</p><p>"The remnants of the Fallen Soul Abyss are hiding down below.  The Fallen Soul Abyss's sect-protecting formation is an ancient formation obtained by the old ghoul many years ago.  It's somewhat tricky.  I'll trouble Daoist friend to assist me, let us break the formation together!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, noncommittal.</p><p>The darkness of the Fallen Soul Abyss couldn't obstruct his vision.</p><p>Through the formation, he saw panicked faces.</p><p>Strictly speaking, he had no grievance with Patriarch Ming Hu. Patriarch Ming Hu was merely a tool for his Dao enlightenment.</p>
