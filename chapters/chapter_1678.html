<h1>Chapter 1669: The Demonic Son</h1><p>Venom King!</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the newcomer's identity.</p><p>The voice was shrill and wavering, forcibly transmitted through a secret sound transmission technique, distorted by the wind煞 and the power of the formations.</p><p>Venom King was determined to follow, but Qin Sang's Thunder Escape was too fast, and Kun Dao, concealed within her barrier, wasn't slow either. He almost lost them.</p><p>Venom King also mastered an escape technique that transformed miasma into wind, but it was difficult to utilize within the wind煞, making pursuit strenuous. He hurriedly sent a sound transmission.</p><p>The voice arrived before the person.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He responded in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist, what do you mean by this?"</p><p>His offensive remained fierce and unrelenting. However, under deliberate control, the pressure on Kun Dao eased slightly. He intentionally left an opening, fighting as he moved.</p><p>Regardless of Venom King's intentions, Qin Sang had no desire to wait for him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist eliminated this sect's traitor, removing a great hidden danger for this one. When we met before the mountain, this one failed to thank you, which was indeed impolite."</p><p>Battered by the wind煞, the sound transmission was distorted, making it difficult to discern Venom King's true tone. Was his gratitude sincere?</p><p>Something happened!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Before the Five Elements Divine Restriction, Venom King had inquired about the strange-faced man's whereabouts without any unusual behavior. Now, he was explicitly seeking him out. What went wrong?</p><p>Their last interaction was during Master Huaiyin's ambush. Venom King arrived too late to notice anything amiss.</p><p>Qin Sang believed he hadn't revealed any flaws.</p><p>However, Venom King's ability to continuously track the strange-faced man implied a secret method.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe Venom King's gratitude was genuine. He was undoubtedly after the strange-faced man's belongings.</p><p>This sudden change was unexpected.</p><p>He was quite interested in the Gu King and planned to consult Ghost Mother about taming it after returning to the mountain. Once he confirmed it was untamable, he could calmly decide whether to let the Venom Pearl devour it or trade it.</p><p>He hadn't expected to be exposed so quickly.</p><p>Judging by Venom King's attitude toward the strange-faced man, going so far as to collaborate with a foreign Holy Monk in relentless pursuit, it was clear that the Venomous Myriad Mountains desperately wanted the Gu King, leaving no room for compromise.</p><p>However, handing over the Gu King now was not what Qin Sang desired.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist is too kind. This one already had a life-and-death feud with that scoundrel. It has nothing to do with your esteemed sect. There's no need for gratitude or any grand reward."</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, not denying it, as there was no need.</p><p>Venom King seemed momentarily speechless. After a pause, he said, "To be frank with Fellow Daoist, this sect has made preparations. Any fellow Daoist capable of eliminating the traitor will receive a handsome reward… This King will not let down any fellow Daoist…"</p><p>His tone grew heavier towards the end.</p><p>Venom King's heart was heavy, sensing Qin Sang's attitude.</p><p>During their first encounter, this man deliberately concealed information when questioned. Now, he was evading the topic again, making his intentions clear.</p><p>What worried Venom King most was Qin Sang's apparent ease.</p><p>Normally, aside from the Venomous Myriad Mountains, which cultivated the Gu King seed, and the traitor who hatched and raised it, no one else could tame it.</p><p>In others' hands, the Gu King was useless. Even if temporarily suppressed, its ferocious nature couldn't be contained.</p><p>It wouldn't become an asset but a constant threat of backlash.</p><p>In such a short time, they had encountered each other three times, yet Qin Sang's aura remained undisturbed.  It was only detectable through special techniques. If not for the traitor's continued absence, Venom King wouldn't have suspected Qin Sang.</p><p>How long had he possessed the Gu King to achieve such control?</p><p>What did this imply?</p><p>If this man withheld the Gu King, or even tamed it, it could trigger another upheaval.</p><p>But this man was even more formidable than the traitor!</p><p>Qin Sang understood Venom King's implication: he wouldn't let down a fellow Daoist, but what if they weren't fellow Daoists?</p><p>He feigned ignorance, chuckling, "Let's discuss this later. After leaving the Formless Immortal Sect, if this one has the leisure, I shall certainly pay a visit."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang continuously evade the issue, Venom King finally lost patience and got to the point, "Fellow Daoist, after eliminating the traitor, you should have seen a jade beetle-shaped Gu worm. This Gu worm is a treasure of our sect, stolen by the traitor upon his defection. It is useless to outsiders. Could Fellow Daoist…"</p><p>"Hey! Where are you running!"</p><p>Before Venom King could explain the stakes and offer benefits, Qin Sang suddenly roared.</p><p>Venom King then heard a thunderous boom rapidly receding.</p><p>Cursing inwardly, Venom King urged his Miasma Wind to pursue. During the chase, he faintly sensed the commotion ahead, gaining a deeper understanding of Qin Sang's abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang, multitasking, had never ceased his assault on Kun Dao while conversing with Venom King. The Celestial Eye Butterfly constantly monitored the barrier above.</p><p>As expected, Kun Dao, suffering repeated injuries from the Sun God Tree and the Four-Chariot Serpent Seal, was weakening. Although she hadn't been forced out of the barrier yet, Qin Sang was confident of capturing and killing her. It was only a matter of time.</p><p>He interrupted Venom King to avoid an immediate response, buying himself time.</p><p>It seemed he could subdue Kun Dao alone, without needing assistance.</p><p>However, in the subsequent struggle for the Wordless Jade Tablet, his opponents would be powerful cultivators from top-tier lineages. Alone, he might need Venom King's help. He would decide later.</p><p>Venom King pursued relentlessly, calling out several times, but received no response.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt the wind煞 tremble ahead, followed by a deafening roar. The intense fluctuations overshadowed the sounds of Qin Sang and Kun Dao's battle.</p><p>Venom King, just passing by a refined chamber, saw it shake as its restrictions rippled. He pushed against the waves of impact, arriving at the source of the disturbance.</p><p>Seeing the scene, Venom King scoffed. A spirit array had been deliberately detonated, creating a great commotion to mask energy signatures.  Clearly, Qin Sang's doing.</p><p>Venom King paused briefly, then dashed forward.  Just as he was about to expand his senses, he detected unusual energy fluctuations from the depths of the wind煞 to his left. His expression shifted as he shot towards it.</p><p>Ahead, Qin Sang deliberately slowed his attack, confirming through his connection with his avatar that Venom King had taken the bait, lured by the illusion his avatar created.</p><p>It took Venom King three encounters to confirm the Gu King was in his possession, indicating limitations to Venom King's secret technique.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>Kun Dao's condition worsened; his avatar's help was no longer necessary here.</p><p>Focusing on capturing Kun Dao was the priority.  Venom King's interference would create further complications. Qin Sang had no intention of sharing the spoils.</p><p>His avatar, protected by a spiritual treasure, could at least entangle Venom King for a while. The mountain's complex terrain and numerous restrictions were advantageous to his avatar.</p><p>In case of emergencies, his true body could arrive at any moment.</p><p>Knowing this deception wouldn't fool Venom King for long, Qin Sang intensified his assault, unleashing a barrage of magical techniques and treasures.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the battle in the medicinal garden.</p><p>Old Devil Fan and Zhu Wudao, without the protection of their talismans, fared little better than Qin Sang and the others. Their senses were hampered by the pervasive wind煞, and their path blocked by formations.</p><p>Catching the scent of spiritual herbs, both looked down.</p><p>They were at the highest point, having already passed the medicinal garden. To find the source of the fragrance, they would have to retrace their steps.</p><p>With powerful enemies in pursuit, returning now would be reckless, sacrificing the greater good for small gains.</p><p>Simultaneously, they looked away, continuing their ascent. The numerous formations posed constant challenges, forcing even these peak cultivators to avoid direct confrontation.</p><p>As they flew, another spirit array, eroded by the wind煞, erupted ahead.</p><p>Suddenly, azure light pierced the sky, sensing their presence and transforming into azure blades that slashed across the distance.</p><p>Without hesitation, they leaped to either side.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The azure blades passed between them as if splitting the void. Just as they were about to carve a chasm into the ground, they abruptly halted, reverting to their azure light essence.</p><p>Azure ripples spread through the void.</p><p>Old Devil Fan, confirming the threat had passed, stepped across the azure light. "Junior Brother Zhu…"</p><p>His voice abruptly cut off. Old Devil Fan's face darkened.</p><p>In that instant, Zhu Wudao had vanished!</p><p>Separated by a mere layer of azure light, he had completely disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhu Wudao, having shaken off Old Devil Fan, moved through a dense forest.</p><p>His pace wasn't fast, yet each step propelled him hundreds of zhang. His passage created no disturbance. The wind煞 blew through him unimpeded, as if he didn't exist. This was clearly an exceptionally advanced escape technique.</p><p>Unlike his struggles with Old Devil Fan, Zhu Wudao moved freely and swiftly.</p><p>A faint blood-red light enveloped him, like a blood-colored robe. While it didn't completely shield him from the wind煞, it minimized his presence to near invisibility.</p><p>Judging by his direction, his destination was clear: the summit of Emperor Bestowal Mountain!</p><p>Silently, Zhu Wudao traversed the forest and entered a verdant meadow. His movements betrayed a sense of urgency, bypassing all obstacles in a single stride.</p><p>As he moved, Zhu Wudao raised his arm, reaching into his sleeve and retrieving a statuette.</p><p>The statuette had resided in his sleeve for a long time, originally intended for rescuing the Holy Monarch. Unexpectedly, the path to the Immortal Palace was severed.</p><p>Now, the statuette exhibited a mystical quality. Two lines of bloody tears flowed from its tightly closed eyes. The blood-red robe Zhu Wudao wore originated from these tears.</p><p>The outside blood sacrifice was likely still ongoing, but Zhu Wudao knew these tears weren't from the sacrifice.</p><p>"I didn't expect you to still be alive."</p><p>Zhu Wudao stared at the statuette, chuckling softly.</p><p>"Shut up! Put it away!"</p><p>The blood tears on the statuette's face deepened in color. A domineering mental command surged through the statuette into Zhu Wudao, instinctively silencing him and forcing him to return the statuette to his sleeve.</p><p>Zhu Wudao inhaled deeply, surveying his surroundings, recalling recent events.</p><p>The plan to rescue the Holy Monarch had gone awry, forcing him to change his plans and prioritize his own survival.</p><p>Predictably, upon leaving the Formless Immortal Sect, he would be hunted by the entire cultivation world, leaving him nowhere to hide.</p><p>Therefore, Zhu Wudao began scheming for the opportunities on Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The Wordless Jade Tablet was a mere distraction. He knew that the Formless Immortal Sect had placed the Five Elements Crown, hailed as the number one spiritual treasure of the Central Continent, on Emperor Bestowal Mountain to help demon-tainted cultivators suppress their demonic nature. This was his true target.</p><p>Unexpectedly, shortly after entering Emperor Bestowal Mountain, an uninvited guest contacted him through the statuette.</p><p>Zhu Wudao knew the other party's identity: a great demonic figure who orchestrated the demonic tribulation long ago, now sealed within Emperor Bestowal Mountain by the Formless Immortal Sect. This demon was vastly different from the Holy Monarch, yet he had somehow persisted within the seal, retaining his true nature and surviving until now.</p><p>Firstly, the statuette Zhu Wudao prepared for the Holy Monarch's rescue was a demonic artifact. Secondly, the seal had been unattended for so long, allowing this demon to connect with the statuette through the barrier.</p><p>"What kind of opponent is this, making even the esteemed Demonic Son so cautious?"</p><p>Zhu Wudao didn't dare to be presumptuous, but his mental communication persisted.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>A furious snort resonated directly within Zhu Wudao's mind, shaking his primordial spirit and causing him pain.</p><p>Simultaneously, fragmented information forcefully poured into his mind. This violent influx would shatter the true nature of a weaker cultivator, turning them into an imbecile.</p><p>Zhu Wudao frowned, sensing the other party's frantic mental state and the forcibly suppressed rage, like molten lava. He abandoned his playful attitude, no longer daring to provoke.</p><p>Focusing on these fragments, Zhu Wudao 'heard' disjointed voices, gleaning crucial information.</p><p>"A Tool Spirit?"</p><p>Zhu Wudao's expression drastically changed, nearly crying out in shock.</p><p>"Not a Tool Spirit!  It's a Demonic Spirit born from this King's taint of its spiritual nature! It hasn't even passed the Spirit Molding stage, so how can it be a Tool Spirit!" The Demonic Son's mental fragments shifted, responding.</p><p>"Demonic Spirit…"</p><p>Zhu Wudao was bewildered, this exceeding his comprehension.  After careful consideration, he understood.</p><p>It turned out there were two reasons for Emperor Bestowal Mountain's closure. One was the self-seclusion of demon-tainted cultivators within. The other was the imprisonment of the Demonic Son.</p><p>The Demonic Son's mental response was quite smug, "A mere fragmented realm, with the strongest being a few Nascent Soul brats, they dared to dream of slaying this King! They could only rely on a seal, slowly eroding this King's true nature."</p><p>The source of the seal's power was the Five Elements Crown, the number one spiritual treasure of the Central Continent!</p><p>To this end, Emperor Bestowal Mountain established the Five Elements Divine Restriction within, connecting it to the mountain's original protective formation to maximize the spiritual treasure's power. With the five elements mutually generating and endlessly cycling, they formed an unbreakable seal.</p><p>The Formless Immortal Sect's cultivators sealed themselves within, both to purge their own demonic nature and to perfect the seal, suppressing the Demonic Son.</p><p>Unexpectedly, soon after the seal's completion, internal strife erupted within the Formless Immortal Sect. The seal became a hindrance, partly due to the Demonic Son's efforts.  Sensing the external turmoil, he frantically assaulted the seal, distracting the cultivators maintaining it, leaving them unaware and unable to prevent the catastrophe that engulfed the Formless Immortal Sect, sinking them into the Dragon Soaring Cliff.</p><p>After this upheaval, the cultivators on the mountain remained undisturbed, gradually perishing in their self-imposed seclusion.  The seal, left unattended, functioned automatically, allowing the Demonic Son to survive until now.</p><p>Fortunately, the Five Elements Divine Restriction endlessly cycled, preventing the Demonic Son from finding a loophole and escaping.</p><p>However, he was resourceful.  After much contemplation, he devised a way to taint the spiritual treasure with demonic energy.</p><p>The number one spiritual treasure of the Central Continent lived up to its name. Although it hadn't reached the stage of forming a Tool Spirit, its spiritual nature was strong enough to be tainted by demonic energy.</p><p>After an unknown number of centuries, the Demonic Son succeeded. The Five Elements Crown gradually transformed into a demonic artifact.</p><p>Upon reading this, Zhu Wudao became even more puzzled. "If that's so, then why…"</p><p>"Over three hundred years ago…"</p><p>The Demonic Son abruptly paused, scoffing in frustration.  "Because of my prolonged imprisonment and the seal's erosion, I grew weaker, causing a disruption midway. When I wanted to continue, I discovered the Five Elements Crown had developed its own spiritual nature, giving birth to a monstrous existence, neither Tool Spirit nor otherwise.  Instead of rescuing its master, it intended to devour this King, seeking to mold its own spirit!"</p>
