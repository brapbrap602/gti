<h1>Chapter 788: Enlightenment in Battle</h1><p>These two swordsmen possessed exquisite swordsmanship, but their strength was not great. Qin Sang defeated them without much effort. Unlike puppets, they had no vital points, and Qin Sang treated them as living beings.</p><p>But after these two were defeated, two more swordsmen immediately leaped from the walls, giving Qin Sang no time to recover.</p><p>His retreat cut off, Qin Sang understood this was a test of unwavering advance.</p><p>In the long corridor, sword lights crisscrossed.</p><p>Qin Sang's breathing grew heavy, but his eyes grew brighter.</p><p>He had fought more than a dozen battles.  Step by step, Qin Sang advanced down the corridor, unable to retreat. The darkness at the end of his vision slowly receded, but the end remained unseen.</p><p>The swordsmen grew stronger with each encounter, their improvement following a pattern – sometimes in swordsmanship, sometimes in cultivation. Qin Sang, however, could only rely on his swordsmanship and his own abilities; his magical artifacts remained sealed.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed he would be defeated before reaching the end of the corridor.</p><p>He didn't know what awaited him then.</p><p>He had tried everything, but the corridor's restrictions remained impenetrable.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Two more swordsmen jumped down, wielding different sword techniques than before.</p><p>Each swordsman used only one technique, but each was incredibly refined. Any sword cultivator traversing this path would undoubtedly make significant progress in their skill.</p><p>These swordsmen were his opponents, but also his teachers.</p><p>Qin Sang clearly felt himself gaining profound insights during these battles.  Unfortunately, the uncertainty of his fate weighed heavily on his heart, preventing him from feeling any joy.</p><p>“These two swordsmen together are almost as strong as I am!”</p><p>Sensing the power of their sword attacks, Qin Sang’s heart sank slightly, knowing he couldn't go much further.</p><p>His movements, however, remained unaffected.</p><p>His ebony sword trembled slightly, emitting a clear, ringing sound, then transformed into a streak of lightning, reaching its peak speed to engage one swordsman before they could launch a combined attack.</p><p>These swordsmen were perfect sword cultivators: fearless, emotionally unmoved, capable of the best response to any attack.</p><p>But against the lightning-fast sword energy, this swordsman was slightly too slow.</p><p>His attack was just beginning when the ebony sword struck first, breaking through his defense.  The lotus-shaped sword energy in front of the swordsman was pierced by a lightning bolt. The ebony sword, unstoppable, passed straight through the swordsman's chest, then veered slightly, aiming for the other.</p><p>The fatally wounded swordsman froze, his sword energy dissipating.  He stood still, bowed to Qin Sang, and silently faded into a green light.</p><p>The other didn't last much longer.</p><p>Immediately, two more swordsmen sprang from the walls behind.</p><p>The moment the battle began, Qin Sang's expression changed. They seemed to anticipate the lightning-fast sword energy; before the ebony sword could strike, they joined forces, forming a defensive stance.</p><p>Their sword formations were unusual. Their swords pointed, and the surrounding sword energy formed a turtle-shell-like defense, incredibly tight.</p><p>“This path…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed helplessly. No matter what sword technique he used, his next opponent would always counter with a technique designed to overcome it.</p><p>Even the lightning-fast sword energy was no exception.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang learned his lesson. He didn't rush to use his sword light dispersion technique, but instead used the lightning-fast sword energy to gradually wear down his opponents, slowly killing them.</p><p>No single sword technique, however powerful, is without flaws.</p><p>Afterward, he settled down, engaging in prolonged combat with his opponents, patiently searching for a way to defeat them.</p><p>‘Tap! Tap! Tap!’</p><p>Qin Sang's footsteps echoed slowly through the corridor, but each step was firm.</p><p>During this process, Qin Sang threw caution to the wind, completely forgetting everything else, his mind focused only on his sword, immersed in the way of the sword.  He didn't even realize that his swordsmanship was improving imperceptibly.</p><p>His previously learned techniques were now merging seamlessly, reaching a state of perfect harmony.</p><p>The lightning-fast sword energy was slowly becoming more varied.</p><p>This kind of pure swordsmanship duel was an experience Qin Sang had never had before, yet the rewards were incredibly significant.</p><p>“No! They’ve gotten stronger again!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s pupils constricted suddenly.</p><p>The two new swordsmen also wielded the lightning-fast sword energy, and they knew his weaknesses.</p><p>Having just defeated two opponents, before Qin Sang could catch his breath, two flying swords, like thunder and lightning, attacked from left and right, making it difficult for him to respond.</p><p>Qin Sang had no choice but to finally use the sword light dispersion technique.</p><p>He was quite satisfied to have lasted this long. Before entering the corridor, he would have fallen to the first few swordsmen.</p><p>The ebony sword split in two, but instead of blocking the incoming flying swords, it launched a surprise attack on one opponent.</p><p>This tactic succeeded. Qin Sang thrust his palms forward, his true energy surging as he unleashed a spell to deflect one sword.  The ebony sword entangled the other, while the surprise attack killed a swordsman.</p><p>"Besides swordsmanship, any of your own powers can be used—physical strength, spiritual sense, spells…However, the power of spells is closely tied to true energy and is difficult to exceed one's cultivation limit. Spiritual sense and physical strength might be possible, but such secret techniques are extremely rare."</p><p>Qin Sang gained new insights, but unfortunately he hadn't deliberately cultivated his physical strength or spiritual sense.</p><p>As he progressed, the pressure on Qin Sang intensified, and the battle became increasingly difficult.</p><p>When the swordsmen unleashed their sword-light dispersal technique, he was finally exhausted, reaching the end of his journey.</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with unwillingness, his eyes wide as he stared into the depths of the passage. The darkness there was thinning, and the scene beyond was almost visible, but he was about to face defeat.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A crescent-shaped sword energy struck him.</p><p>Qin Sang hurriedly blocked with his sword, but felt a searing pain in his wrist as he was violently flung back, crashing against the wall.</p><p>Immediately, the swordsman appeared ghostlike before Qin Sang, his attacks like a furious storm. Finally, gripping his sword with both hands, he unleashed a devastating blow!</p><p>Death descended!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were bloodshot, and he let out a roar that wasn't quite human.  Throughout his cultivation, he had never given up in the face of any hardship, and even in this seemingly inescapable death, he would not yield.</p><p>He poured all his remaining strength into resisting with his sword.</p><p>The next moment, a blinding sword light flashed past his eyes.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang thought he was dead.</p><p>After a moment of disorientation, Qin Sang felt no pain.  He looked around and found himself inexplicably transported back to the entrance of the passage.</p><p>The swordsman had vanished, and the passage was peaceful, as if everything had been a dream.</p><p>Qin Sang was drenched in sweat. He quickly summoned his ebony sword to examine it. Seeing that it was undamaged, he breathed a sigh of relief, collapsing onto the ground with a weak smile.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang stood up, his expression calm. He gazed into the depths of the passage, recalling what he had just learned, then without hesitation, he walked back inside.</p><p>He had to see what was at the end of the passage.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had a premonition that his swordsmanship was on the verge of a significant breakthrough.</p>
