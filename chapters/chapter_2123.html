<h1>Chapter 2113: Yuanxiang</h1><p>Many people, from the moment they stepped onto the path of cultivation, were instilled with the notion of the Storm Realm's precarious situation, regarding the Changyou Clan as their mortal enemy, and personally battling them on the battlefield. For the disciples of the Green Ram Sect, and indeed for all cultivators of the Storm Realm, these recent times represented an unprecedented era of peace.</p><p>Only a handful, such as Qin Sang, knew how dangerous and urgent the situation truly was. Fortunately, the Lu Clan army had not yet appeared, nor had the Changyou Clan made any unusual movements.</p><p>As time passed, the situation gradually tilted towards the direction Qin Sang desired.</p><p>After Zhuque's breakthrough, its cultivation stabilized as naturally as flowing water finds its course. It quickly journeyed to the Western Lands to preside over the branch altar.</p><p>Qin Sang was now free to act, but he did not return to the Green Ram Sect. His whereabouts were erratic, appearing from time to time in various corners of the Storm Realm, making arrangements in secret.</p><p>…</p><p>A storm was brewing.</p><p>The present calm felt more like the tranquility before a tempest.</p><p>On the western border of the Storm Realm, a gentle sea breeze pushed the seawater onto the shore, splashing white foam that danced with the waves.</p><p>A flock of seabirds glided across the horizon, tracing elegant arcs before diving into the clouds.</p><p>After the birds flew past, two streaks of light, their origins unknown, appeared in the sky. Silent yet incredibly swift, they arrived above the Western Lands in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Within the streaks of light, two figures were faintly visible. One was Yuan Miao, and the other was a white-haired elder, a head shorter than Yuan Miao, with a round belly, a long beard that almost touched the ground, and cloudy eyes that gave him a perpetually tipsy appearance.</p><p>He leaned on a cane, which was actually a smooth, yellowish wooden staff of unknown material. Tied to the top of the staff was a red gourd, swaying gently in the wind.</p><p>Entering the territory of the Western Lands, Yuan Miao's lips moved slightly, about to offer some introductions, but seeing the elder heading straight for the Great Compassion Zen Temple, as if intimately familiar with the place, he closed his mouth, a look of puzzlement in his eyes.</p><p>Suppressing his curiosity, Yuan Miao silently followed the white-haired elder across the desert.</p><p>Along the way, Yuan Miao noticed that more and more Buddhist temples and altars were being built in the desert, indicating that the scale of the altar formation was even larger than he had anticipated.</p><p>Previously, he had thought Qin Sang was being overly cautious, believing the Changyou Clan unlikely to find allies capable of rivaling Qin Sang and thus unable to cause significant trouble.</p><p>Now he realized that caution was indeed justified, and that Fellow Daoist Qu Lin of the Siyou Clan had far more connections than he had imagined.</p><p>The elder also noticed the altars, pausing above a Buddhist temple. However, he did not intrude, instead observing with keen interest for a while before departing.</p><p>The monks within the temple were completely unaware of being scrutinized from above. However, Zhuque, currently presiding over the Western Lands branch altar, felt every feather on its body stand on end!</p><p>Neither Yuan Miao nor the white-haired elder concealed their auras after entering the Western Lands.</p><p>As the altar formation neared completion, the one presiding over it could, through the connections between the altars, sense each individual altar and the fluctuations of spiritual energy in their vicinity.</p><p>When Yuan Miao and the white-haired elder passed by the altar, Zhuque detected two powerful auras approaching the interior of the Storm Realm.</p><p>Their blatant disregard for secrecy, coupled with one aura so profound that even Qin Sang's Dharma Body couldn't compare, spoke volumes about their cultivation levels.</p><p>The arrival of a peak expert at this juncture did not bode well.</p><p>Zhuque wasn't sure whether the altar formation could be activated yet, or how much power it possessed, but it was absolutely out of the question for it to confront them personally!</p><p>It immediately activated the restrictions, triggering the altar to inform Qin Sang's Dharma Body, who presided over the main altar.</p><p>Yuan Miao and the white-haired elder were blissfully unaware that they had thoroughly frightened a certain avian demon.</p><p>Leaving the Buddhist temple, they continued eastward.</p><p>As they neared the Great Compassion Zen Temple, the elder's expression shifted slightly. He abruptly stopped, gazed into the distance, then activated his escape technique, his speed surging as he shot through the air, leaving behind a single sentence:</p><p>"Little Monkey, I'll go meet him first. You follow slowly."</p><p>Yuan Miao's face twitched, roaring inwardly, "Ancestor, I've grown up!"</p><p>Little Monkey was his childhood nickname, given to him by a certain ancestor because he resembled a monkey at birth. The moniker had stuck.</p><p>However, since he had reached the Void Realm, almost no one dared to use that name.</p><p>But this one, this one…</p><p>Yuan Miao couldn't help but feel deflated.</p><p>…</p><p>At the edge of the desert.</p><p>Qin Sang was flying through the air.</p><p>In his hand, he held a three-storied miniature pagoda, carved from crystal, exquisite and translucent.</p><p>This was the treasure refined by Si Lu, known as the Void Severing Spirit Pagoda. It could restrict the inter-dimensional travel technique of the Siyou Clan. However, to unleash its true power and trap an opponent, precise timing was crucial, making it difficult to utilize effectively.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently comprehending this treasure, hoping to gain insights that could be applied to the Thunder Altar.</p><p>Toying with the Void Severing Spirit Pagoda in his hand, Qin Sang furrowed his brow. He had been inspecting the inland area when he received the news and immediately rushed over.</p><p>According to Zhuque's description, there were two arrivals, one of whom was likely Yuan Miao. Yuan Miao hadn't replied to his letters, and his unannounced arrival with a mysterious expert raised questions about his intentions.</p><p>Qin Sang believed Yuan Miao wouldn't harm him without reason, and with the protection of the Illusory Profound Divine Light from the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he decided to come personally to avoid any perceived slight.</p><p>Mid-flight, Qin Sang sensed an unfamiliar aura approaching. His heart tightened, he immediately stored the Void Severing Spirit Pagoda in his Thousand Jun Ring, slowed his descent, and heightened his vigilance.</p><p>A moment later, Qin Sang abruptly turned his head towards a nearby forest, simultaneously hearing a voice:</p><p>"You cultivate Buddhist divine abilities, yet construct Daoist altars. Are you a disciple of Buddhism or a follower of the Dao?"</p><p>Perched atop a ancient tree within the forest, seemingly materialized out of thin air, sat the white-haired elder, legs crossed on a branch, his long beard dangling between them.</p><p>He picked up his red gourd and uncorked it, releasing a rich, intoxicating aroma.</p><p>The fragrance instantly filled the forest, stirring the surrounding vegetation. Birds, beasts, fish, and insects all appeared as if drunk, faces flushed, bodies swaying, before finally succumbing to slumber.</p><p>The elder took a satisfying swig, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang with amusement.</p><p>Qin Sang's nostrils twitched slightly, recognizing this as an extraordinary wine.  Inhaling its fragrance, countless creatures within the forest might gain enlightenment and defy their fate.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is Qin Sang. Dare I ask for your esteemed title?"</p><p>Qin Sang landed on another ancient tree, cupping his hands in a respectful yet assertive gesture.</p><p>His heart churned.</p><p>Neither Si Lu nor Yuan Miao had recognized the origins of the Thunder Altar, yet this individual had discerned it with a single glance.  He was clearly very familiar with the human race, raising questions about his connection to them.</p><p>"Indeed a follower of the Dao…"</p><p>The elder nodded.  "This old man is Yuanxiang."</p><p>Yuanxiang!</p><p>The Patriarch of the Zhuyan Clan!</p><p>Surprise flickered in Qin Sang's eyes.  The arrival of this figure was unexpected.</p><p>The Siyou Clan had already dispatched spies and would inevitably make their move. It was reasonable for the Zhuyan Clan, upon realizing Yuan Miao's inability to control the situation, to send someone of higher status.</p><p>He hadn't expected the Patriarch himself!</p><p>Excluding the Sage Realm and Ancestral Realm experts residing in the Sacred Grounds, the Patriarchs of the major noble clans were among the most powerful figures in the Otherfolk race, their numbers few.</p><p>These individuals should be striving for the Sage Realm, yet Patriarch Yuanxiang had long since withdrawn from worldly affairs, his whereabouts shrouded in mystery.</p><p>Arriving with Yuan Miao, Yuanxiang's identity was beyond doubt. An expert of his caliber wouldn't stoop to impersonating another.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned solemn. He said in a deep voice, "I was unaware of the Patriarch's arrival. Please forgive this humble Daoist's lack of propriety and any unintentional disrespect."</p><p>"Daoist seniors brave the elements and roam freely, unbound by mundane customs, embodying natural ease. This old man has always admired such a life."</p><p>Yuanxiang wiped his mouth, waving his hand dismissively.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly noted that this likely referred to the Alchemy branch of the Dao, as, to his knowledge, the Talisman branch was known for its complex rules and etiquette.</p><p>However, this indicated Yuanxiang's familiarity with the human race, suggesting he might have once left the Mist Sea and journeyed through the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>The fact that the small Storm Realm could attract the attention of Patriarch Yuanxiang was beyond Qin Sang's expectations.  This unusual circumstance raised numerous questions in his mind, countless thoughts flashing through his head.</p><p>He suddenly had a premonition that the situation surrounding the Storm Realm might be more complicated than it appeared.</p><p>Logically, the Storm Realm's ascension and arrival within the Zhuyan Clan's territory shouldn't have gone unnoticed.</p><p>Qin Sang had been pondering how to interact with the Zhuyan Clan.</p><p>After returning to the Storm Realm, the various discoveries, such as the existence of treasures like Azure Spirit Qi, the Changyou Clan's motive for concealment, the Zhuyan Clan's leniency towards vassal clans, and Yuan Miao's ignorance of these matters, had led him to believe this was the truth.</p><p>Patriarch Yuanxiang's sudden appearance made Qin Sang realize that these might only be surface appearances.</p><p>This unforeseen variable, whether positive or negative, sparked a whirlwind of thoughts in Qin Sang's mind as he listened to Yuanxiang continue:</p><p>"Since you are also a follower of the Dao, was it Master Liu Li who sent you here?"</p><p>After speaking, Yuanxiang muttered to himself, "They should be master and disciple now, right?"</p><p>These words caused a glint to flash in Qin Sang's eyes, his heart stirred by a sudden wave.</p><p>Everything was indeed a facade. The Storm Realm's survival within the Otherfolk territory for nearly a millennium had a hidden reason!</p><p>The master Yuanxiang referred to was clearly not Bing Yao.  They were already master and disciple, so why the mention of "becoming" master and disciple?</p><p>The ruins of the Purple Star Palace indicated that Bing Yao's fate was likely grim.</p><p>Who was Liu Li's new master?  Why were Tong Lingyu, Li Yufu, and even Shi Xue unaware?  Why was the entire Storm Realm kept in the dark?</p><p>Liu Li's recent departure was likely to visit this master.</p><p>The reverence in Yuanxiang's tone when mentioning this individual suggested Liu Li's master possessed extraordinary cultivation and status.</p><p>Could it be a senior who ascended?</p><p>Or perhaps a powerful human cultivator who had journeyed here?</p><p>However, Qin Sang's thoughts now connected to the Storm Realm's various secrets, not only the Purple Star Palace, but also the being the First Sword Attendant feared, and whether the Realm's ascension held a deeper meaning.</p><p>Could he finally be glimpsing the tip of the iceberg?</p><p>"This humble Daoist is unaware of whom the Patriarch speaks, but it is unlikely to be any Daoist companion I previously knew," Qin Sang replied after a moment of thought.</p><p>"Indeed! It seems you ascended from the lower realms and later learned of this matter, arriving here on your own, without guidance. In the vast and boundless Great Thousand World, it is truly remarkable that you managed to find this place."</p><p>Yuanxiang took another swig of wine and sighed.  "Unexpectedly, this has led to so many misunderstandings."</p><p>Qin Sang, now able to faintly grasp the situation, inquired, "What misunderstandings does the Patriarch refer to?"</p><p>"Since you don't know this person, it is not appropriate for this old man to reveal their identity…"</p><p>Yuanxiang's expression turned contemplative, as if weighing what could and could not be said.</p><p>"Back then, that person sought me out, asking me to offer some protection and prevent the extinction of your clan. However, your feud with the Changyou Clan runs deep, and as a member of a noble clan, I couldn't favor outsiders and forcibly prevent their revenge.  Thus, I made an agreement with that person: I would not interfere in your conflicts with the Changyou Clan.  As long as you did not actively provoke others, no one would target you, and no one would bully the weak. That person agreed. For many years, that person has not reappeared, and I have never intervened. Your recent allegiance to the Siyou Clan has invited great trouble, and it is difficult for this old man to get involved."</p><p>Upon hearing Yuanxiang's words, Qin Sang suddenly understood, all his previous doubts resolved.</p><p>The Storm Realm's survival within Otherfolk territory was indeed due to someone's protection, although only Liu Li knew of this arrangement.</p><p>Qin Sang's curiosity about Liu Li's master intensified.</p><p>For some unknown reason, this person had remained hidden, only entrusting Patriarch Yuanxiang with their protection.</p><p>Was it inconvenient for them to act directly, or was it a form of tempering for Liu Li?</p><p>The great trouble Yuanxiang mentioned undoubtedly referred to the Siyou Clan's impending attack.  It seemed he had inadvertently brought this trouble upon them.</p><p>However, if he hadn't returned, and Min Zhuo had achieved his breakthrough, the Storm Realm would still be in grave danger. He wondered whether Patriarch Yuanxiang would have intervened.</p><p>"Does the great trouble the Patriarch speaks of refer to the Lu Clan of the Siyou Clan?" Qin Sang asked, feigning ignorance.</p><p>"Not only the Hanjiang Lu Clan, but also the Imperial Clan. They claim that the person you've pledged allegiance to is a traitor of the Yanshan Si Clan. Experts from the Imperial Clan will also participate in the attack. You have become a vassal clan of the Yanshan Si Clan, making this an internal matter of the Siyou Clan. It would be improper for this old man to intervene directly. At most, I can impose some restrictions on them and delay them for a while. Whether you can overcome this tribulation depends on yourselves!"</p><p>After speaking, Yuanxiang saw that Qin Sang remained calm and gave him a deep look. "I see you are not panicked. It seems you have a plan."</p><p>"This humble Daoist has already found a safe location and sent some juniors there.  Even in the worst-case scenario, our lineage will survive." Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>Everything was proceeding as they had anticipated, even better than expected.</p><p>This was the Zhuyan Clan's territory.  The Siyou Clan couldn't afford to mobilize all their forces. As long as Patriarch Yuanxiang was willing, he could impose reasonable demands, limiting the number of Siyou Clan experts that could come. With Patriarch Yuanxiang cooperating to delay them, once the Thunder Altar was complete, the outcome of the conflict remained uncertain!</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't reveal all his thoughts, despite Patriarch Yuanxiang appearing more friend than foe.</p><p>He urgently asked, "Can Patriarch Yuanxiang contact Immortal Liu Li's master, or perhaps inform this humble Daoist of their location? I wish to pay them a visit personally."</p><p>"Do you know of Purple Cloud Mountain?"  Yuanxiang countered.</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then slowly shook his head.</p><p>It was rumored that beyond Kanzhou, within the Eastern Sea, resided numerous reclusive human sects and experts.  Qin Sang had heard some legends, but none mentioned Purple Cloud Mountain.</p><p>"That is it."</p><p>Yuanxiang said, "That person has always cultivated on Purple Cloud Mountain.  However, this old man only knows that it is near the Mist Sea, not its exact location. I also have no way to contact them. It has always been Purple Cloud Mountain that contacts our clan."</p>
