Chapter 1897 Nirvana


In the Daoist tradition, those whose cultivation reaches the True Clarity Dharma Position and above are respectfully addressed as Celestial Masters.
Celestial Master is also a title signifying status.
With the Daoist tradition in decline, True Lord Zhang leads the Dao Court, his cultivation surpassing all others in the Daoist sects. He is the undisputed leader of the Daoist tradition, worthy of the title Celestial Master!
Moreover, his transformation into the Gouchen Emperor grants him power comparable to a Celestial Master.
‘Whoosh!’
A rein condensed from starlight shot out from the front of the Emperor’s chariot, aiming for the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon.
The Five-Clawed Golden Dragon dared not resist, allowing the rein to loop around its neck. It then soared into the sky, pulling the Emperor’s chariot through the Southern Heavenly Gate upon a golden cloud.
The Emperor’s chariot entered Thunder City, pierced the Nine Heavens, and proceeded directly to the Nine-Layered Heavenly Palace.
In this heaven, primordial energy is chaotic, purple clouds radiate brilliance, emptiness gives birth to nature, there is clarity and turbidity, movement and stillness.
Here, light shines above and below, illuminating endlessly.
There is no spring or autumn, no winter or summer, neither heat nor cold, only gentle light, where even the withered are revived.
Amidst the murmuring spiritual wind and the boundless auspicious clouds, an ancient palace stands.
This palace isn't as resplendent as the other divine palaces, nor does it possess any divine aura.  It resembles an ordinary stone palace, its gates tightly shut, suspended in the void, silent and formless.
This is the very origin of the Dao Court—the Divine Firmament Upper Palace, also known as the Nine Heavens Golden Palace!
Ordinary mortals could hardly imagine that the legendary holy land of the Daoist tradition is such an ordinary stone palace.
The Five-Clawed Golden Dragon pulled the Emperor’s chariot, flew to the palace entrance, and prostrated itself before the chariot.
Celestial Master Zhang rose from the Emperor’s throne, gazing at this holy land he had only seen in Daoist scriptures. Even with his composed nature, he could hardly contain his excitement.
The Divine Firmament Upper Palace has been silent for too long, and the Daoist tradition has declined for too long!
Countless sages blazed the trail, diligently pursuing the Dao, only to ascend with regret.
Finally, through his hand, the dust-covered palace gates will be opened!
From this day forth, the Daoist tradition shall rise!
"I once questioned the Three Purities,
Rise and fall, all written in the scriptures.
Recalling the old scenes of the Divine Firmament,
…"
Celestial Master Zhang, filled with emotion, chanted softly. Reaching the last line, he paused, looked up at the highest heavens, and his voice suddenly rose powerfully.
"The Golden Palace moon ascends at the third watch!"
"Roar!"
The Five-Clawed Golden Dragon echoed with a dragon's roar, empathizing with Celestial Master Zhang's feelings.
The Daoist tradition was trapped in this realm, and so was the Ghost Fang Kingdom.
Unfortunately, the Ghost Fang Kingdom lost.
A melancholic glint flashed through the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon's eyes as it lowered its head.
Celestial Master Zhang raised his hand towards the Divine Firmament Upper Palace.  The palace gates slowly opened, and a stream of light shot out, flying towards Celestial Master Zhang, who grasped it in his hand.
Within the light was a square seal, inscribed with 'Dao Scripture Master Treasure Seal'!
The Daoist tradition has three treasures: the Dao, the Scripture, and the Master.
The Dao Treasure refers to the legendary Dao Lord, born before chaos, prior to the Great Nothingness, at the beginning of primordial energy.
The Scripture Treasure refers to the true scriptures of the Daoist Canon and all Daoist arts.
The Master Treasure refers to the past sages of the Daoist tradition and all those who have attained the Dao.
One of the most important precepts of the Daoist tradition, the 'Three Refuges' within the Three Refuges and Five Precepts, requires initiates to take refuge in the Dao, Scripture, and Master Treasures as a demonstration of sincerity.
The Dao Scripture Master Treasure Seal is the supreme divine seal of the Daoist tradition, the keystone of the divine court!
Celestial Master Zhang tightly gripped the Dao Scripture Master Treasure Seal. Just then, a woman's voice reached him.
He responded with a hearty laugh, "Why not!"
With that,
Celestial Master Zhang, holding the Dao Scripture Master Treasure Seal, boarded the Emperor’s chariot, and alongside the Earth Slaughter Sword, shattered the boundary and departed!
…
The divine blade unsheathed.
The sword cleaved the void!
Qin Sang watched the Earth Slaughter Sword pierce the sky, his eyes filled with complex emotions.
Undoubtedly, the young man in green was the sword spirit of the Earth Slaughter Sword.
The Earth Slaughter Sword had followed him for many years, its sword spirit always dormant.
Qin Sang had only received brief warnings from the sword spirit, never directly communicating with it until he saw its true form today.
He had guessed that the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter* and the Earth Slaughter Sword had extraordinary origins. Now, it seemed they far surpassed his imagination.
The woman intended to use the Earth Slaughter Sword against a Grand Completion stage cultivator!
Qin Sang overheard the exchange between the sword spirit and the woman, which brought him much shock and confusion.
According to the woman, she was adrift in the River of Sin, sinking within it, constantly searching for and calling out to the Earth Slaughter Sword and its master.
If she was the Blood Moon, could the Heavenly Demonic Sound that plagued the cultivators of this realm simply be her calls to the sword spirit?
Thinking back, according to the descriptions of the Holy King Qing Hu and the Holy One Hui Guang, the Heavenly Demonic Sound appeared after the Immortal Palace ascended.
Could it be that the fluctuations of the Immortal Palace's ascension drew her here? And because she was lost in the River of Sin, unable to extricate herself, her voice sounded like a demonic sound, mistaken by the cultivators of the Storm Realm for the Heavenly Demonic Sound?
The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more likely it seemed.
He had countless times speculated on the origin of the Heavenly Demonic Sound, considering various possibilities, even searching for answers in Daoist classics.
He had never considered such an absurd, unbelievable answer!
If True Person Zi Lei, Master Zhi Tan, and other brilliant cultivators whose paths were severed by the Heavenly Demonic Sound were to learn the truth, they would surely die with regrets.
The world is unpredictable.  The actions of powerful beings can easily bring catastrophic disaster to lower-level cultivators!
It was truly lamentable.
But if the 'Blood Moon' wasn't the enemy, then who was the powerful foe they were facing?
What was the origin of that palm print, and the enemy who crossed the blood pool?  And how did they know the Earth Slaughter Sword was with him?
"Could it be…"
Qin Sang's heart stirred.
Besides the Dao Court, there was another power outside the Storm Realm that he had encountered!
The scene of him escaping through the star platform in the Witch God Mountain Shrine flashed through his mind.
The star platform's beacon, the starlight descending, was blocked by a blood-colored rainbow.
He had initially considered them saviors. Could he have been completely wrong?
If this was the truth, the 'starlight' had targeted the Earth Slaughter Sword back then, and the woman was saving him. She sent Venerable Tian Yue to this realm to guide him, while she herself battled the powerful enemy until now.
Had he walked right into a trap, even provoking a Grand Completion stage cultivator?
Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat, instinctively glancing to his side, noticing that the woman hadn't left with the Earth Slaughter Sword.  It likely wasn't her true body.
The woman looked back at him.
"You must have many questions. What do you want to ask? Time is short; I cannot maintain this form for much longer."
Qin Sang realized that the woman's figure was becoming increasingly translucent.
For a moment, he didn't know where to begin. After a hesitation, he asked, "What virtue or ability do I possess?"
What virtue or ability did he have to deserve such protection from the woman?
Not only did she shield him from a powerful enemy, but she also sent Venerable Tian Yue into this realm, meticulously arranging various opportunities for him.
If it was simply to retrieve the Earth Slaughter Sword, the woman could have directly had Venerable Tian Yue take it. Why go to such lengths?
The woman gazed wistfully at the Cloud Wanderer Sword beside Qin Sang, her voice tinged with sadness. "Being his successor is enough!"
"Successor? Of the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter*?"
Qin Sang frowned, pressing further, "Who is he? And what is your identity, Senior?"
"Some revere him as the Purple Star Emperor, others call him the Purple Star Sword Sovereign, but he disliked these titles. However, his sword was quite fond of the name 'Purple Star Emperor Sword'…"
Before she could finish, the Earth Slaughter Sword, about to break through the boundary, seemed to sense something and let out a sword cry.
"As for me," the woman's expression turned nostalgic and wistful, her voice a soft murmur, "I am the First Sword Attendant under his command."
"Emperor, Sword Sovereign, Emperor Sword, Sword Attendant…"
Qin Sang pondered the meaning behind these titles. Just as he was about to speak again, he felt a stir within his sleeve. A red light burst forth.
Without his summoning, the Sun God Tree appeared on its own.
This thing was still alive!
Qin Sang inwardly complained. He had just called out to the Vermillion Bird fledgling, but there was no response.  Now it had come out on its own.
Along with the red light came a series of sharp shrieks.
"You, you, you…"
The Sun God Tree hovered before the First Sword Attendant, the nine firebirds on its branches coming to life, glaring at the woman.
"It's you!"
"It's you!"
"It's you!"
…
All nine firebirds simultaneously raised their wings, trembling as they pointed at the First Sword Attendant.  It was clear that the Vermillion Bird fledgling was extremely agitated, seemingly recognizing the First Sword Attendant.
Its cries were piercingly sharp, its nine eyes wide and round, appearing more like it had encountered an enemy than an old acquaintance.
Qin Sang's heart stirred, recalling that the Vermillion Bird fledgling had once mentioned a vague memory of being held by the neck.
Could it be that it was the First Sword Attendant who had captured the Vermillion Bird fledgling and stuffed it under the alchemy furnace to stoke the fire?
"Ah! It was you! It was you!"
The Vermillion Bird fledgling grew increasingly agitated.
However, it seemed to have become overly excited, unable to articulate anything beyond that.
The First Sword Attendant ignored the Sun God Birds, her gaze fixed on the base of the Sun God Tree.  Suddenly, a smile spread across her face.  "So it was that little fire crow."
With a smile, the戾 qi around her lessened considerably.
The Sun God Birds froze, then their feathers ruffled in unison.
Old grudges added to new, rage surged within the Vermillion Bird spirit, and it shrieked, "I am a Vermillion Bird!"
Unmoved, the First Sword Attendant continued, "I didn't expect that the Sword Pavilion has fallen, yet you, little fire crow, have survived until now.  It seems fate has favored you…"
"Ah! Ah! Ah!"
The Vermillion Bird fledgling was consumed by fury.
The Sun God Tree swayed precariously, and the nine Sun God Birds seemed about to take flight.
Unexpectedly, the First Sword Attendant extended a finger and lightly tapped the Sun God Tree, instantly immobilizing all the birds.
The fire energy within the tree also completely solidified.
Hidden within the Vermillion Bird True Feather, the Vermillion Bird fledgling sensed the First Sword Attendant's immense power and its cries abruptly ceased, replaced by fear.
It finally remembered that this person before it could easily hold it like a chick back then.  Now, if she wished it harm, it had no power to resist.
‘Poof!’
All nine birds exploded simultaneously.
‘Whoosh!’
The fire energy within the Sun God Tree was completely stripped away, transforming into a ball of flame. Within the heart of the flames floated two fire feathers.
A Vermillion Bird True Feather and a Heavenly Phoenix True Feather!
With its fire energy extracted, the trunk of the Sun God Tree continued to glow crimson.  After years of tempering by the Vermillion Bird True Fire, it seemed to have undergone an unknown transformation.
The First Sword Attendant singled out the Vermillion Bird True Feather, suspending it at her fingertip. Trembling and terrified auras emanated from within.
Before the Vermillion Bird fledgling could beg for mercy, faint cracking sounds came from the Vermillion Bird True Feather.
The downy fluff fell away, cracks spread across the shaft, and finally, it shattered completely, transforming into a blazing inferno.
"Ah! Help!"
The Vermillion Bird fledgling's cries echoed from within the flames.
Qin Sang vaguely guessed what was happening.  He didn't stop the First Sword Attendant, his heart filled with shock.
The Vermillion Bird fledgling's cries grew weaker, and a silhouette gradually emerged from the flames, resembling a divine bird being reborn in fire.
The First Sword Attendant suddenly frowned slightly, then summoned the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather.
‘Crack!’
The Heavenly Phoenix True Feather shattered, transforming into wisps of Phoenix True Fire that merged into the inferno.
Two distinct flames now seamlessly fused together without any conflict.
The silhouette of the divine bird grew increasingly clear.
Then, the First Sword Attendant instructed Qin Sang to separate a strand of divine sense and infuse it into the flames.
‘Boom!’
‘Screech!’
Flames soared skyward, accompanied by a resounding cry as a divine bird spread its wings and soared.
Like a phoenix, reborn from the ashes!
"I have a body! My body is restored!"
The Vermillion Bird fledgling was ecstatic, incredulous, flying back and forth, its tiny claws scratching all over its body, confirming again and again whether it was real or a dream.
Joy even overshadowed its hatred, completely forgetting the 'enemy' before it.
Its body was only the size of a fist, clearly a fledgling, not yet displaying the majesty of a Vermillion Bird Sacred Beast.  It truly resembled a fire crow.
Perhaps the power of the two true feathers was exhausted in shaping its spirit, for the fiery aura emanating from the Vermillion Bird fledgling was even weaker than when the nine Sun God Birds appeared together.
But everyone understood that the Vermillion Bird had been reborn, an event of profound significance!
"I have punished you once before. From now on, you shall follow him.  If you serve your master well, I shall pardon your insolence!"
The First Sword Attendant looked weary, her figure fading further, her voice faint.
The Vermillion Bird fledgling, still immersed in joy, preened and wagged its tail, oblivious to the woman's words.
Divine skill!
Qin Sang marveled.
The interruption by the Vermillion Bird fledgling allowed him to collect his thoughts.  He quickly spoke, prioritizing the matters concerning himself.
"What do you intend for me to do, Senior?"
Qin Sang understood that unearned rewards came with a price.  Past experiences had taught him that opportunities were not easily obtained.
"With your meager cultivation, what can you do?"
The woman's retort left Qin Sang speechless.
‘Rumble!’
Suddenly, the heavens and earth trembled.
The tremors seemed to originate from beyond the realm, with void storms spreading through deep space.
She glanced at deep space and continued, "You have inherited his mantle and gained the recognition of his sword. Do you know how many people want to find you?"
Qin Sang had already anticipated this.  He could only offer a wry smile. Who could have known that the Earth Slaughter Sword and the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter* had such far-reaching implications?
"I need to heal and have many things to attend to. I cannot protect you forever.
Since you can withstand the Thunder Ancestor, with him protecting your altar in the future, no one will be able to divine your location.
Although the Thunder Ancestor is a remnant spirit, his Grand Completion status remains, which can conceal your aura and deceive the heavens.
As long as you are careful, even in a direct confrontation, few in this world can discern your true origins!"
Hearing these words, Qin Sang finally understood.
No wonder Venerable Tian Yue had helped him reach the Void Refinement stage in this realm.
It turned out they had a prior agreement with the Dao Court, planning to secure a guardian deity for him.
After reaching Void Refinement, gathering the power of the Daoist tradition to request the Thunder Ancestor or another deity of comparable status would undoubtedly be much safer.
"Who are our enemies?"
After a moment of silence, Qin Sang asked.
He used the word 'our'.
Having inherited the legacy, he also inherited the cause and effect.
It wasn't that Qin Sang truly trusted the First Sword Attendant and Venerable Tian Yue, ready to completely align himself with their cause.
He understood another principle.
Sometimes, a person's stance is determined at birth.
One could change allegiances, but first, they had to be strong enough, strong enough to be valued by all sides and able to bear any consequences!
"What if I said the whole world is our enemy?"
The First Sword Attendant said meaningfully.
