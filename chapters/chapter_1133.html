<h1>Chapter 1125: Venting</h1><p>Uninhabited waters.</p><p>Two figures stood facing each other on the water's surface. Bai's appearance was that of a corpse-cultivator, his face rigid.  As a corpse-cultivator, Bai was already a top-tier Flying Night Rakshasa, only a step away from becoming a Corpse King. He looked at Qin Sang, his eyes growing serious. Then, his shoulders moved slightly, his arms trembling as if warming up for battle, the corpse energy on his body surging.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of chilling wind howled, the water surface unable to remain calm.  Although it was midday, the sun was shining brightly.  But as Bai displayed the might of a Flying Night Rakshasa, the temperature in the surrounding void plummeted, bringing with it waves of icy coldness, as if even the sunlight dimmed.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Suddenly, the corpse energy retracted, sinking into Bai's body.  Bai's body, like other corpse-cultivators, was thin and emaciated, his skin a bluish-black, with corpse energy flickering faintly on the surface, radiating a metallic sheen, incredibly hard. This body, seemingly stiff and rigid, was actually capable of powerful evasion techniques, exceptionally agile.  Ordinary cultivators encountering a Flying Night Rakshasa would find it extremely difficult, and Bai was no ordinary Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang had phoenix wings sprouting from his back, also empty-handed, his fists clenched tightly. Having cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* to the peak of the third layer, Qin Sang's physique was no weaker than a Flying Night Rakshasa. However, from the outside, his skin was no different from a normal person's, rosy and fair. It was this seemingly ordinary body that concealed astonishing explosive power.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A violent wind arose.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai disappeared simultaneously.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>A huge wave surged into the sky.</p><p>Two figures reappeared amidst the waves, their fists colliding.  Both shuddered, flying back several meters before quickly turning and lunging at each other again.</p><p>‘Rumble… …’</p><p>It was unimaginable that pure hand-to-hand combat could stir the wind and clouds, creating such an astonishing spectacle.  By now, they were entangled, their figures almost indistinguishable, only the dull sounds of fists colliding could be heard, each one like a thunderclap.</p><p>At their current level, they possessed many more supernatural abilities. But both, by mutual agreement, chose to engage in purely physical combat.</p><p>Waves splashed.</p><p>The entire water area was thrown into chaos.</p><p>Corpse energy and the green light of the phoenix wings intertwined. They let loose completely, focusing entirely on their opponent.</p><p>Initially, Qin Sang, due to his limited experience in close-quarters combat, was slightly at a disadvantage. But Bai wouldn't defeat him so easily. As time went on, Bai also deliberately guided Qin Sang to unleash his true strength, and Qin Sang became increasingly composed.</p><p>His fists and phoenix wings worked together seamlessly.</p><p>His movements were like lightning, his fists like thunder.</p><p>The two gradually fought on equal footing.</p><p>This was a rare experience for Qin Sang – a reckless, purely physical confrontation with an equally matched opponent like Bai, and he couldn’t help but feel exhilarated.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>After a fierce clash, the two figures separated.</p><p>Corpse energy vibrated.</p><p>Bai’s figure plummeted, springing back up the moment it touched the water. Qin Sang violently flapped his phoenix wings, transforming into a streak of green light soaring high, circling once before descending from the sky, his chest rising and falling slightly.</p><p>“Not bad! That body refinement technique of yours truly has merit.”</p><p>After the fierce battle, the crimson in Bai's eyes deepened.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang ignored Bai's words, his eyes fixed on Bai, as if regarding him as a sworn enemy, he charged again.</p><p>The shadow of his fist rapidly enlarged in Bai's field of vision.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai silently observed Qin Sang, his heart stirred, then without a word, he met the blow.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Bai forcefully pushed Qin Sang back, his figure flickering as he retreated tens of meters, taking out a Corpse Soul Pearl and swallowing it. Immediately, corpse energy surged around him, and he let out a beast-like roar.</p><p>The next moment, Bai's appearance underwent a bizarre transformation.  His flesh twisted, his shrunken flesh clinging tightly to his bones. Corpse energy gathered in his hands, his claws grew, black as ink, carrying terrifying corpse poison, his bones cracking, his body instantly growing several inches taller.  Simultaneously, fangs grew from his mouth, his appearance becoming monstrous.</p><p>Bai's current appearance was almost as terrifying as the Corpse King from the Immortal Tomb.</p><p>Noticing Bai's transformation, a hint of surprise flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, but there was no hesitation or fear, and he attacked again.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A black light flashed.</p><p>Bai crossed his arms. Before Qin Sang could see what he was doing, he found ghostly claw shadows appearing in the void before him, leaving him with nowhere to hide.</p><p>With a thunderous boom, Bai's ghostly claws engulfed Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was thrown back, unharmed but clearly shaken.  Bai pressed his attack relentlessly, a swirling vortex of corpse energy engulfing him in an instant, moving faster than Qin Sang.  His ghostly claws were exceptionally sharp, hard as any magical weapon, and dripping with potent poison, posing a grave threat.</p><p>Qin Sang had no doubt that a single strike would pierce his defenses and grievously wound him.  In a flash, the ghostly claws descended like a storm. Bai held the upper hand, his power growing stronger with each passing moment, showing no mercy.</p><p>The intensity of the battle lessened compared to its earlier stages.  Qin Sang was forced onto the defensive, surrounded by the corpse energy, his room to maneuver shrinking, the situation dire.</p><p>Then, suddenly, a roar erupted from within the corpse energy!</p><p>The roar seemed to hold years of pent-up fury.</p><p>It was followed by a clear, resonant sword’s hum, echoing to the heavens.</p><p>The next moment, a brilliant sword beam cleaved through the swirling corpse energy, splitting it in two.</p><p>The sword light was blinding, radiating immense sharpness.</p><p>Qin Sang stood tall, bathed in the sword light, resembling a divine sword himself!</p><p>His ebony sword hung suspended, not falling, yet the force of his sword intent instantly annihilated the ghostly claws.</p><p>This was the might of sword intent—unstoppable with a single strike.  It cleansed the heavens and illuminated the world!</p><p>Bai was quite surprised by this display.  Seeing no need to continue, he withdrew the corpse energy, returning to his previous form, and bowed, "Congratulations, friend, on grasping sword intent!"</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, letting out a long breath, and replied gravely, "Thank you."</p><p>The path of cultivation is ultimately a lonely one. Friends and family cannot keep pace, perhaps becoming skeletons after a single retreat.  Senior Sister Qing Jun's approach is quite detached: everyone except oneself is merely a passing traveler.</p><p>Qin Sang had long understood this, and experienced much of it. However, the passing of his two mentors, who were also his friends, had naturally affected him deeply.</p><p>Bai sensed this, but as a fellow seeker of the Dao, he understood that Qin Sang didn't need consoling.  The sparring match itself had provided a necessary outlet.</p><p>After the fight, the weight on Qin Sang's heart had lifted.  Even Bai was astonished by Qin Sang's ability to use this opportunity to grasp sword intent and advance his swordsmanship!</p><p>Qin Sang’s aura calmed, and turning to Bai, he asked, recalling Bai's earlier transformation, "Did you comprehend the Corpse Soul Pearl?"</p><p>Bai shook his head.  "I can only borrow some of the Corpse King's power from it.  True comprehension is still far off."</p>
