<h1>Chapter 1854: The Tapir</h1><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The instant the sword light touched the white net, the net tightened, emitting a resonant clang.  Simultaneously, the edges of the white net began to close, attempting to trap the Yunyou Sword within.</p><p>Billowing white smoke rose, engulfing the sword light, almost obscuring the Yunyou Sword from sight.</p><p>The next moment, a ripping sound.</p><p>The smoke instantly dissipated.</p><p>The white net, split in two, spun and flew away, the Yunyou Sword cleaving through the obstacle with a fierce, sharp light.</p><p>Accompanied by the sword's whistling cry, the Yunyou Sword transformed into a rainbow-like arc of light, its momentum earth-shattering, swiftly striking at Dingxiang Hou!</p><p>This strike didn't utilize the Seven Souls Killing Formation; relying solely on Qin Sang's understanding of the killing arts and swordsmanship, its power was beyond the imagination of ordinary individuals.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou's expression darkened. He hadn't expected the white net to stop this sword strike.  Having tested the Yunyou Sword's power, his caution intensified, and he immediately opened his mouth, spitting out a ball of white light.</p><p>Within the white light was a jade pot.</p><p>The jade pot was quite small, no bigger than a person's hand, shaped like a regular teapot, made of pure white jade, immaculate and flawless, without a single blemish or pattern.</p><p>The jade pot tilted slightly forward; a flash of white light erupted from the spout, and wisps of smoke poured out.</p><p>“Shhh… shhh…”</p><p>The smoke seemed incredibly heavy, emitting a rustling sound as it poured out.</p><p>The white smoke, like a tea mist, instantly conjured dozens of fantastical scenes, overwhelming the eyes.</p><p>The swirling smoke coalesced, forming circular smoke rings, drifting towards the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>This was an illusion. The smoke rings moved with incredible speed, no slower than the sword light, and they were far from as easily dispersed as they appeared.</p><p>“A spiritual treasure!”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze was drawn to the jade pot; he recognized it as a spiritual treasure without a doubt.</p><p>He wasn't surprised. Dingxiang Hou was a close confidant of Lingyou Wang. It was said that upon becoming a demon marquis, he had been favored by Lingyou Wang, serving him for many years, making the lack of a spiritual treasure highly improbable.</p><p>However, with the opponent's formidable strength and possession of a spiritual treasure, the difficulty of obtaining the spirit tree increased significantly.</p><p>Spiritual treasures have no grading system; before actual combat, nobody knows which is stronger.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The smoke ring, perfectly timed, enveloped the sword light, instantly tightening, becoming a tight band around the sword.</p><p>The sword light dimmed slightly, but in a flash, it flared with blinding brilliance, suppressing the smoke ring's momentum, turning it into a fragile white circle.</p><p>A ripping sound followed, the white ring cracking near the sword's edge, the sword light resembling a dragon about to break free from its reins.</p><p>This clash of spiritual treasures, devoid of any flashy maneuvers, seemed to slightly favor the Yunyou Sword.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou's face changed, hastily urging the jade pot; its spout poured out thick white smoke, speeding toward the sword.</p><p>‘Whizz!’</p><p>The Yunyou Sword pierced the white ring, only to be met by thick fog.</p><p>Tilting the jade pot, it continuously expelled white smoke; the smoke within seemed endless.</p><p>The rolling smoke, no longer mere smoke, formed a misty river in the air, vast and imposing, flowing forward, its waves rising high, surging past the sword light.</p><p>The Yunyou Sword was like a boat sailing against a strong current.</p><p>Qin Sang, connected with the Yunyou Sword, felt its immense weight; the white mist felt like tons of water cascading down, like mountains collapsing, all its force pressing heavily on the spirit sword.</p><p>Even with the Yunyou Sword's sharpness, cutting through the waves was no easy task!</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The sword's hum was somewhat muffled.</p><p>The earth-shattering sword intent that erupted at that moment caused Dingxiang Hou's pupils to contract sharply.</p><p>In an instant, the sword light soared, the terrifying sword intent imbued with boundless killing intent.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation, the only sword formation from the *Cultivating the Soul Sword Chapter*!</p><p>The Yunyou Sword, a life-bound spirit sword!</p><p>Although this strike was unleashed by a sword image, the power unleashed in that instant still caused Dingxiang Hou to involuntarily turn his head.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The sword's momentum was like a dragon.</p><p>Visible to the naked eye, a brilliant streak of sword light surged upstream through the misty river, splitting the white fog, which failed to merge back together for a long time.</p><p>It was at the moment when the two spiritual treasures clashed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dingxiang Hou continuously retreated.</p><p>He didn't wish to directly confront Qin Sang.</p><p>Such opponents were rare, and a fierce battle with them, testing one's abilities, was enjoyable; but this was a fight to the death, not a game.</p><p>Only when Ling Youwang arrives will they be certain of victory, so from the outset, Dingxiang Hou decided to adopt a defensive strategy.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou retreated, Qin Sang advanced.  The battlefield between the man and the demon sped across the luminous sea.</p><p>His figure moved like lightning, but failing to put distance between himself and Qin Sang, he was quickly closed in on.  A glint of ferocity flashed in his eyes, and his aura subtly shifted.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed the change in Dingxiang Hou's aura; it was familiar.</p><p>"A Dharma-body?"</p><p>He hadn't expected Dingxiang Hou to have comprehended a Dharma-body. It seemed a fierce battle was unavoidable.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, his phoenix wings beating rapidly, his speed suddenly surging.  Green lightning ripped through the waves of light.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou stared intently at Qin Sang.  The aura around him intensified, a faint white light appearing behind him.</p><p>Within the white light, the ghostly form of a strange beast slowly coalesced—a creature dozens of times taller than Dingxiang Hou’s human form.  It had an elephant trunk, rhinoceros eyes, a bear's body, and an ox's tail: a bizarre beast indeed.</p><p>The Dharma-body was Dingxiang Hou's true form manifested. Qin Sang had never seen such a beast before and was secretly amazed.  Images from ancient texts he'd read flashed through his mind.</p><p>"A tapir? Could it be a tapir demon?"</p><p>He remembered reading about this beast in an ancient text. Tapir demons were rare, with internal divisions within their race, each possessing different powers.  The Dharma-body alone gave no indication of this particular tapir demon's type.</p><p>As the tapir Dharma-body took shape, Qin Sang felt a powerful pressure emanating from it.  While imposing, it wasn't overwhelmingly strong to him; the Dharma-body was merely an illusion, incomparable to his own Azure Bird Dharma-body.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou's comprehension of the Dharma-body was still in its early stages.  However, for a demon who didn’t practice the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, achieving Dharma-body realization at the Metamorphosis stage was extraordinary.  Xia Hou couldn't match him.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Dharma-body formed, then dissolved into white light, merging into Dingxiang Hou’s body. Clearly, he too only had a rudimentary understanding, like Qin Sang, knowing only how to integrate it into himself.</p><p>Instantly, Dingxiang Hou’s demeanor changed dramatically.  His eyes were clouded with a white mist, obscuring his pupils; his gaze was emotionless, coldly fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>A wave of immense pressure washed over the battlefield, momentarily hindering Qin Sang, weakening his aura.  This was the suppression of heavenly might!</p><p>Having mastered the Dharma-body, he was only surpassed by exceptional geniuses.  Other opponents would be hampered in his presence.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou smirked cruelly, but the smile quickly froze on his face, replaced by disbelief.</p><p>Qin Sang merely flashed with green light, returning to normal. Then, an aura erupted from within him—an aura familiar to Dingxiang Hou: the aura of a Dharma-body.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang had also mastered a Dharma-body, but Ling Youwang's prediction had proven true: the opponent’s Dharma-body power not only surpassed his tapir demon Dharma-body, but the difference was far greater than he imagined!</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>A low rumble echoed continuously. The void trembled, and the surrounding waves of light seemed to stagnate.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>His phoenix wings spread wide, each feather fully extended, radiating brilliant green light.  Arcs of electricity danced between the feathers, imbued with profound mystical energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's hair and beard whipped in the wind, his whole body enveloped in green light, transforming into a true Azure Bird deity. His eyes were similarly devoid of emotion, locked on Dingxiang Hou.</p><p>Dingxiang Hou's face paled.  The feeling of control granted by his tapir demon Dharma-body vanished; this space was now dominated by his opponent, and he was the one suppressed.</p><p>Their gazes were level, yet Dingxiang Hou felt as if he were being looked down upon.  No words were spoken, but a sense of insignificance took root in his heart.  Those with weaker willpower would have their resolve shaken, their fighting spirit extinguished.</p><p>A collapse of spirit was the prelude to defeat!</p><p>Dingxiang Hou’s shocked gaze lingered. Even Ling Youwang, after self-reducing his cultivation, hadn't possessed this level of Dharma-body power.  In his entire life of cultivation, he had never seen a demon marquis achieve such mastery!</p><p>Faced with this powerful enemy, Qin Sang unleashed the full power of his Azure Bird Dharma-body.  Beneath the intense green light, the pure light of the Net Glaze Treasure shone from within him.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Dingxiang Hou saw a flash before his eyes, a giant azure bird rapidly enlarging.  The overwhelming pressure of divine might was even more intense.  He felt profoundly uncomfortable, a sensation he'd almost forgotten.  This pressure meant limitations in every aspect, putting him at a severe disadvantage.</p><p>Facing immediate danger, Dingxiang Hou unleashed a powerful punch.  A white trail of smoke marked its passage.  A sharp roar emerged from the smoke, followed by the manifestation of a white tapir demon from his fist.</p><p>This tapir was similar in appearance to the tapir's divine form, but smaller, condensed from the tapir's essence.  Its eyes glowed crimson, its expression ferocious, eager to devour, as it roared towards the enemy.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, but she calmly delivered a palm strike, seemingly slow but incredibly swift, striking the tapir demon between the eyes.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Buddha's light erupted from the tapir's forehead.  Its body stiffened, its advance halted by the single blow.  Qin Sang snorted, pushing forward with her palm, her hand glowing with the brilliant light of a pure crystal treasure, Buddhist power flowing, enveloping the tapir.  Instantly, the tapir demon disintegrated, vanishing into thin air.</p><p>This sight further shocked Dingxiang Hou.  If he'd previously believed a prolonged fight was manageable, now he was focused solely on preserving his treasures and his life.  Without hesitation, he swung his trunk, releasing two streams of white energy.</p><p>Unlike before, these two streams intertwined to form two white energy blades, which sliced towards Qin Sang's face.  While she defended against the blades, Dingxiang Hou’s body shifted, accompanied by the sound of cracking bones.  His trunk elongated, his face protruded, his body swelled, his hands and feet transforming into hooves—revealing his true demon form!</p><p>A tapir demon, identical to its divine form, appeared before Qin Sang.  Its fur was snow-white, its small eyes strikingly bright.   Its aura was stronger in this form, yet still unable to overcome Qin Sang's divine pressure.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Qin Sang deflected the two energy blades.  With a thunderous roar, she lunged at Dingxiang Hou, only to witness an unexpected scene.</p><p>“Moo!”</p><p>Dingxiang Hou let out a bellow, ignoring Qin Sang, and lay down in mid-air.  He retracted his hooves, curled into a ball, head and tail touching, eyes closed—a peaceful sleeping posture.  In moments, his breathing steadied, and he truly fell into a deep sleep on the battlefield.</p><p>This stunned Qin Sang.  She couldn't fathom his intentions; he surely hadn't given up.</p><p>“Could it be…?”</p><p>She suddenly remembered a legendary type of tapir demon—the Dream Tapir!  Tapir demons were rare, Dream Tapirs even more so.  These beasts were said to possess exceptional dream-based abilities, hence their name.  Was Dingxiang Hou's battlefield slumber a prelude to such an ability?  This power was truly bizarre.</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head silently. The vast world held endless wonders. Whatever dream power this was, if it involved drawing someone into a dream, it likely targeted the mind.  She trusted the jade Buddha's protection would prevent her from being lost.  Still, unseen dream powers demanded caution.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang's palm glowed with bloody light.  Her palm-sword flew out, a streak of blood-red energy aimed at Dingxiang Hou. She wanted to see if he could continue sleeping once struck.</p><p>The instant the spiritual sword left her hand, Qin Sang noticed the surroundings had changed.  The area was now shrouded in a thick white fog, creating a hazy, dreamlike atmosphere.  She quickly scanned her surroundings and found Dingxiang Hou gone, replaced by a mountain.  His energy signature indicated his presence within the mountain.</p><p>However, the scene before her was utterly different.  A cave was visible halfway up the mountain; inside, a white juvenile tapir demon peeked out curiously.  In a flash, the tapir grew, dragging other beasts back into the cave to feast.  Later, the tapir learned to absorb moonlight energy, beginning its cultivation journey…</p><p>…until it achieved human form, received a jeweled crown, became a demon lord, earned the favor of a demon king, and rose to become his right hand.</p><p>Scene after scene unfolded before Qin Sang, each a crucial point in the tapir's growth, passing swiftly. Each scene left behind an image of the tapir at that stage on the mountain.</p><p>In an instant, seven tapir demons stepped out, all staring at Qin Sang—juvenile, adult, demon form, human form—a single entity, their auras linked, inseparable.</p><p>"So, this is that dream power…" Qin Sang understood.  These dream manifestations, projected from the dream into reality, were like avatars or clones. Even if destroyed, they wouldn't harm the original—a perfect method for delaying the inevitable.  The question remained about their strength.</p><p>As Qin Sang suspected, Dingxiang Hou, in his dream cultivation, had studied the art of dream-drawing, aiming to silently kill enemies within dreams.  However, he found it exceedingly difficult. After long research, he realized it only worked on weaker opponents with poor mental fortitude, so he abandoned it, instead cultivating the art of external dream manifestation.  He was fortunate not to have attempted to draw Qin Sang into a dream; he might have met his match.</p>
