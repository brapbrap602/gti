<h1>Chapter 932: Appearance</h1><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang drew in his hand, Nine Nether Devil Fire enveloping his body. He pressed himself against the canyon wall, squeezing through a crevice.</p><p>Entering the Ghostlands, a piercing coldness assaulted him.</p><p>Shrouded in the ghostly mist, Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The last time he was here, his vision and divine sense were blocked by the mist, limiting his sight to a small area.  That wraith had snatched the Flying Night Devil and, relying on its familiarity with the terrain, had toyed with him, leaving him completely helpless.</p><p>Now, things were different. The Skyeye Butterfly's Skyeye ability could easily pierce through the ghostly mist, revealing everything around him.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, then a light flashed from between his brows. The Ebony Sword shot out, circling Qin Sang briefly before hovering above his head.  The sword then trembled, splitting into four beams of sword light, setting up a perimeter.</p><p>Qin Sang then activated his movement technique, venturing deeper into the Ghostlands, intending to find the wraith first. During his search, he continued to feign blindness.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his search yielded nothing.</p><p>“Hiding? Could there be a concealment barrier within the Ghostlands that even the Skyeye Butterfly can't see through?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly.</p><p>Not only had he not found the wraith, he hadn't even found the Flying Night Devil. The Ghostlands had boundaries, and there were no obvious hiding places.</p><p>“It seems I can only wait for it to reveal itself.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>After his fruitless search, Qin Sang discreetly patted his waist, and several Corpse Puppets with Foundation Establishment stage strength jumped out of his Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>These were all individuals who had foolishly crossed him during his travels through the Splitwind Islands. As the islands also had Earthly Yin Veins, he had conveniently refined a few Corpse Puppets.</p><p>Qin Sang's lips moved slightly, and the Corpse Puppets scattered. He then slowly walked forward.</p><p>Soon, the area in front of Qin Sang was in chaos. The Corpse Puppets wreaked havoc, crushing decaying magical artifacts, collapsing piles of bones, and disturbing all the resentful spirits hidden within.</p><p>For a time, ghostly wails and howls filled the air, like a procession of a hundred demons.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, capturing the resentful spirits one by one, while his palms pulsed with true essence, refining them into Soul Threads.</p><p>The number of resentful spirits here was immense. In a short time, a foot-long Soul Thread was refined.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang ordered the Corpse Puppets to stop and found an open space to sit cross-legged.</p><p>He took out a Ten Yama Banner and attempted to weave it with the Soul Thread.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had been contemplating what kind of formation to arrange with the Demonic Banners to maximize the power of the eighteen banners. He often studied the Yuan Mirage Sect’s "Fragments of the Tai Xuan Formation" for this purpose.</p><p>Later, he discovered that the formations recorded in the book were incredibly profound and intricate. Even if he could comprehend them, it would be difficult to apply them to the Demonic Banners.</p><p>Fortunately, his efforts were not in vain.</p><p>The questions that had previously plagued Qin Sang were now answered, and his understanding of the three Demonic Banners in his possession deepened. He truly understood how much effort Patriarch Kui Yin had poured into the banners.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banner Grand Formation created by Patriarch Kui Yin was not limited to ten banners. Even with a greater number, it could still function, its power increasing proportionally.</p><p>Clearly, Patriarch Kui Yin was ambitious and, from the beginning of refining the Demonic Banners, had considered how to obtain more Nine Nether Devil Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang simply needed to follow Patriarch Kui Yin’s method to refine all eighteen Demonic Banners. However, his cultivation was still too low, his divine sense and true essence insufficient.  How many banners he could control simultaneously remained unknown.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, holding the banner pole in one hand and the Soul Thread in the other.</p><p>The Soul Thread seemed weightless, gently floating.</p><p>Qin Sang focused intently on the two objects.</p><p>After a moment, his divine sense guided the Soul Thread, slowly drifting towards the banner pole. At the same time, the banner pole emitted a resonant ‘铮’ sound, and the light of its restrictions erupted, revealing countless runes.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly performed hand seals, activating the runes on the banner pole to connect with the Soul Thread.</p><p>He was completely focused, seemingly defenseless to the outside world. In reality, he was ready to activate his Demonic Transformation and open the Heavenly Corpse Coffin at any moment.  He believed that as long as the wraith wasn't at the Nascent Soul stage, it wouldn't be able to escape his grasp.</p><p>Initially, the two objects ignored each other.</p><p>As the light on the banner pole grew brighter, the Soul Thread suddenly trembled. One end of it actively wrapped around the banner pole, merging with the restrictions on it, becoming a seamless whole!</p><p>“Success!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart rejoiced. Just as he was about to continue activating the restrictions and completely refine the Soul Thread, his heart stirred, and a sneer appeared on his lips.</p><p>“You finally dare to show yourself!”</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly raised his head, his eyes flashing with sharp light. His gaze, like lightning, pierced through the thick ghostly mist, instantly locking onto an illusory spectral figure.</p><p>This wraith thought it was well-hidden, spying on Qin Sang from a distance.  It was discovered by the Skyeye Butterfly the moment it appeared.</p><p>The surrounding resentful spirits had all been captured by Qin Sang, making the wraith's identity obvious.</p><p>The wraith, indeed startled by him, couldn't resist approaching.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang quickly put away the banner pole. Azure light surged behind him as his wings unfolded. He unhesitantly activated his Demonic Transformation.  Azure and crimson light then flickered alternately on his body, instantly erupting with astonishing speed as he lunged towards the wraith.</p><p>The wraith was exceptionally alert.</p><p>At the same moment Qin Sang discovered it, it sensed something and abruptly leaped backward. It then transformed into a grayish-white mist similar to the surrounding ghost mist, fleeing towards the depths of the Ghostlands.</p><p>The wraith moved through the ghost mist like a fish in water, its flight silent and ripple-free, its speed incredible. Last time, it was with this ability that it had seized the Flying Night Devil, leaving Qin Sang helpless.</p><p>Now, it thought it could escape Qin Sang in the same way, but it quickly realized its mistake.</p><p>“No wonder I couldn’t find it last time. It's not that its concealment ability is so advanced, it can actually merge with the ghost mist. Unless a cultivator possesses extremely powerful divine sense, it's difficult to detect its presence.  Now that it's being targeted by the Skyeye Butterfly, let’s see where you can run!”</p><p>Qin Sang used his movement technique to its fullest, pursuing the wraith.</p><p>Seeing its movement and concealment methods, he couldn’t help but feel somewhat surprised.</p><p>He wondered how this isolated Ghostlands had given birth to such a wraith.</p><p>The wraith merged with the ghost mist, darting around like a headless fly.</p><p>No matter how it changed direction, Qin Sang relentlessly pursued it.</p><p>Although the wraith's speed was fast, it was only slightly faster than a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator. It was far inferior to Qin Sang, and the distance between them rapidly closed.</p><p>Finally, the wraith understood where the problem lay and stopped running randomly, fleeing directly towards the depths of the Ghostlands.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang flashed over, his gaze sweeping across the surroundings before settling on a mountain of bones below him.</p><p>The wraith suddenly vanished.</p><p>But the Skyeye Butterfly had been closely monitoring its movements; escaping wouldn't be so easy.</p><p>“No wonder I couldn’t find it before.  Is there something hidden within the bones?”</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword. Sword Qi surged as he fiercely slashed towards the bone mountain.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The bones were already decayed. The Sword Qi, like a withered tree before a storm, cleaved down from the mountaintop, piercing through the entire bone mountain.</p><p>Countless bones turned to ash as the mountain collapsed.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, a dark figure suddenly burst through the bone mountain, charging towards him. Qin Sang’s eyebrows twitched. Without time to recall the Ebony Sword, he met the attack with his fist.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The two figures clashed and separated instantly, seemingly evenly matched!</p>
