<h1>Chapter 884: The Gray Hare</h1><p>Suddenly,</p><p>Elder Huayang's expression shifted as he looked at someone.</p><p>It was Zhao Songqiao, a man of about sixty.</p><p>Deep wrinkles lined the corners of Zhao Songqiao's eyes, but his face was resolute.  His eyes were tightly closed, yet his head began to rotate, constantly following a wisp of Yin-Yang energy swirling around him.</p><p>Seeing this, Elder Huayang hurriedly grabbed the jade slip containing the new disciples' information, found Zhao Songqiao’s record, and sighed.</p><p>“Too old.  He might have some hope cultivating other techniques, but if he divides his attention to condense Yin-Yang Armor, he’ll have no hope of reaching Foundation Establishment…”</p><p>The elder slowly shook his head and turned his gaze to the others.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang’s avatar was flying through the illusory realm.</p><p>Here, time and space were illusions.  After flying for an unknown distance, a gray light flashed in the depths of the white mist. The avatar's heart stirred, and he was about to chase after it, but after seeing the true form of the gray light, he stopped.</p><p>It was a giant, grotesque bird formed from gray energy, its body a full ten feet long.</p><p>The avatar recognized that the bird was composed of Yin-Yang energy.</p><p>As the avatar spotted the bird, the bird seemed to sense him as well.  Without a sound, it flapped its wings, its speed exploding as it vanished into the depths of the white mist in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The bird was incredibly fast and possessed strange movement abilities.  Within the mist-shrouded space, unless someone had a sensitivity to Yin-Yang energy, even if they were lucky enough to spot the bird, they would be unable to catch it.</p><p>The avatar watched the bird fly away and gave up after a short pursuit.</p><p>He was certain that capturing the bird would guarantee passing the test and earn him Elder Huayang's favor.</p><p>However, the bird was too large.  Only someone with extremely keen senses could capture so much Yin-Yang energy.</p><p>The avatar lacked such talent and didn't dare attract too much attention by being opportunistic.</p><p>With this in mind, the avatar changed direction and continued his search. Finally, he spotted a gray hare hopping in the void. His face lit up with joy, and he immediately gave chase.</p><p>The hare kicked off with its hind legs, leaping dozens of feet in a single bound.</p><p>However, these gray energy creatures only excelled in speed.  Under the avatar's relentless pursuit, the hare was finally caught, seized by the scruff of its neck without any resistance.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The moment the avatar caught the hare, the white mist abruptly dispersed.</p><p>The avatar's vision blurred, then returned to normal. Looking down, the gray hare in his hand had vanished, leaving only a thumb-thick wisp of gray energy struggling in his palm.</p><p>When he looked up, he found Elder Huayang standing before him, the other candidates staring at him with complex expressions. The formation and Yin-Yang disc had been removed.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, I've truly found a disciple with such talent today.  To capture a thumb-thick wisp of Yin-Yang energy is quite impressive. Though his spiritual roots are somewhat lacking, he's already reached the ninth level of Qi Refining at such a young age. It seems the assessment of his character in the jade slip was accurate. With proper guidance, he can become a pillar of strength…”</p><p>Elder Huayang pondered.</p><p>In the past, he would have carefully considered a disciple with four spiritual roots. Now, however, they were short-handed, so he accepted him directly. He looked at the avatar with a kind expression. “Your name is Zhang Yue?”</p><p>“Disciple Zhang Yue greets Elder,” the avatar said, scrambling to his feet and bowing respectfully.</p><p>The elder nodded in satisfaction. “Are you willing to join my Luminous Hall Sect?”</p><p>The avatar feigned hesitation, glancing at the others.</p><p>The other candidates were filled with envy. They had expected to see Zhang Yue become a laughingstock, but the situation had taken an unexpected turn.  He was accepted into Luminous Hall Sect, leaving them with mixed feelings.</p><p>The young man in green and the others also had complex expressions.</p><p>“What? Are you unwilling?”</p><p>Elder Huayang's face darkened.</p><p>The avatar shuddered and bowed deeply. “Disciple is willing!”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao also held a wisp of gray energy in his hand, but seeing that Elder Huayang ignored him, he couldn’t help but feel deeply disappointed.</p><p>The attendant beckoned the avatar to stand behind him.</p><p>Elder Huayang flicked his dust whisk and bowed slightly. “Fellow Daoist Qi, I've imposed upon you today. I'll take this disciple with me now…”</p><p>“Please, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>……</p><p>The avatar and the attendant stood together, following behind Elder Huayang as they flew out of the Misty Pavilion and into the outer mist formation, quickly exiting the illusion.</p><p>Their escaping light suddenly brightened, shooting towards Luminous Hall Sect.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's true body, hidden in the wetlands, sensed the fluctuation and hurried out, only to see the escaping light disappear into the mountains.</p><p>Deep surprise registered on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>He sensed that his avatar was within that escaping light.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's sharp mind, without knowing the details, he couldn't guess that so much had happened in the Misty Pavilion’s main hall, leading to this unexpected turn of events.  His avatar had actually joined Luminous Hall Sect.</p><p>A flash of serpentine shadow accompanied him as he secretly followed.</p><p>Fortunately, his avatar seemed to be in good condition and didn't appear to be restrained.  This shouldn't be a bad thing.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang followed from a distance, watching as the light headed straight for Luminous Hall Sect.</p><p>They crossed countless mountains and ridges.</p><p>Elder Huayang suddenly stopped his escape, landing on a mountain peak. He instructed the attendant, “Take my token and bring Zhang Yue back to the sect. Register him in the jade册, then teach him the method of condensing Yin-Yang Armor and guide his cultivation.  I'll visit some old friends at other sects…”</p><p>“Yes, Master!”</p><p>The attendant took the token, and Elder Huayang nodded slightly, departing on the wind.</p><p>Seeing the escaping light depart, Qin Sang's true body immediately approached.  However, this location was right outside the gates of Luminous Hall Sect, so he remained cautious. Finally, he sensed his avatar's thoughts and learned what had transpired. He was utterly surprised, secretly sighing with relief.</p><p>He changed his mind, slowly retreating, and watched them leave.</p><p>“Disciple Zhang Yue, may I ask how I should address Senior?”</p><p>After Elder Huayang left, the avatar followed behind the attendant, taking the initiative to make conversation.</p><p>The attendant, despite his young age, was already at the Foundation Establishment stage and had been accepted as Elder Huayang's direct disciple. He must be highly regarded within the Yin-Yang lineage.</p><p>“I’ve only recently reached Foundation Establishment and haven't formally taken on a Daoist title. You may call me Martial Uncle Yang…”</p><p>The attendant’s attitude towards the avatar was amicable.  He looked him over and said, “You truly have remarkable talent. The Yin-Yang energy I captured during the Yin-Yang disc trial was smaller than yours.  When you’re able to cultivate the ‘Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art,’ your progress might even surpass mine.”</p><p>“Disciple wouldn't dare compare myself to Martial Uncle!”</p><p>The avatar forced a smile. “With my four spiritual roots, being able to join Luminous Hall Sect is already unimaginable. Disciple only wishes to cultivate diligently and not disappoint Master and Martial Uncle’s expectations.  I dare not hope for anything more.”</p><p>He muttered to himself.</p><p>It really seemed that core discipleship wasn’t easy to come by.  This wasn’t the Small Cold Region, and it wouldn’t be like Mount Shaohua, where techniques were openly available in the Pagoda Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood that his unimpeded access at Mount Shaohua was also partly due to Duke Dongyang’s ‘consideration.’</p><p>He wondered about the connection between condensing Yin-Yang Armor and the ‘Yin-Yang Heavenly Struggle Secret Art.’</p><p>If there was a chance to glimpse Luminous Hall Sect’s core teachings, he wouldn’t want to miss it.</p>
