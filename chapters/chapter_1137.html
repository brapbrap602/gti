<h1>Chapter 1129: Smooth Sailing</h1><p>Chapter 1129: Smooth Sailing</p><p>“I recall that this young friend, Qin Sang, was only at the False Core stage when he was brought to Purple Micro Palace by Daoist Dongyang and Miss Chenyan.  Originally a disciple of Xiaohua Mountain, when did he switch allegiances?”</p><p>Daoist Chongyi narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Qin Sang before glancing at Lord Dongyang, then unexpectedly posed the question.</p><p>Many of the Nascent Soul masters in the hall had been present back then.</p><p>Recalling the past grievances between the parties, they watched Qin Sang walk to Qingjun's side, his indifference towards his former master, Lord Dongyang, causing many to cast curious glances at the latter.</p><p>At this point, few truly cared about Qin Sang anymore.</p><p>Daoist Chongyi clicked his tongue.  “Back then, when he entered Purple Micro Palace, this lad was merely at the False Core stage. Now, his cultivation ranks among the top in the two realms’ Core Formation generation.  Such a talented disciple, and Daoist Dongyang was willing to let him go?”</p><p>“Could he be a traitor, guilty of defying his master and exterminating his clan? Otherwise, Daoist Leng wouldn’t have accepted him into the Yuan Shen Gate and made him an elder.”</p><p>A cultivator from the Heavenly Path Alliance, purely for the sake of watching the drama unfold, shifted his gaze between Lord Dongyang and Qingjun.</p><p>Xiaohua Mountain and Yuan Shen Gate were both located on the northern shore of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, one east and one west.</p><p>Could it be that not only were they close geographically, but their disciples also exchanged knowledge and skills?</p><p>Qingjun, masked and attending the alliance meeting, still maintained her disguise as Leng Yuntian.  While many Nascent Souls present implicitly knew the truth, they all tacitly accepted it, none daring to expose her.</p><p>Lord Dongyang’s smile didn't falter. His tone, as if sighing, was light.  “People strive for higher positions, water flows downhill, what’s wrong with that? No wonder Miss Chenyan searched for Qin Sang for years without success – it turns out he was hidden by Sect Leader Leng.”</p><p>“Miss Chenyan looked for him?”</p><p>“Wasn’t this kid only at the False Core stage back then? Miss Chenyan, a venerable Nascent Soul master, what connection could she possibly have with him?”</p><p>…</p><p>The Nascent Souls were clearly all very familiar with Chenyan, having witnessed her stunning beauty firsthand, and most also knew her background.</p><p>Hearing this, they were all quite surprised.</p><p>They were extremely curious – did Qin Sang do something to anger Chenyan, or was there another reason?</p><p>Yet Lord Dongyang abruptly stopped, leaving them hanging.</p><p>“This kid’s quite lucky with women…”</p><p>Someone sighed inwardly, but dared not speak aloud in front of Qingjun.</p><p>Qin Sang stared coldly at Lord Dongyang.</p><p>Truly cunning and shameless.  He didn’t mention the cause of their grievances at all, using a few light words filled with implications to shift everyone’s attention.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t know how much of Lord Dongyang’s words were true and how much was false.</p><p>Did Chenyan really look for him?  And why?</p><p>Could it be…that Chenyan was truly troubled by the repercussions of the *玄牝玉鼎真经* ( Xuan Pin Yu Ding Zhen Jing), needing to cultivate the so-called Stone Bridge Zen to resolve the hidden danger, thus continuing her cooperation with Lord Dongyang to find him?</p><p>In Purple Micro Palace, Chenyan had only helped him escape because she was forced to by Lord Dongyang; it was a mere expedient.</p><p>If this was true, he would have gained another enemy, a very powerful one.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of resentment.</p><p>Lord Dongyang’s ambiguous words clearly wouldn’t reveal the truth.</p><p>For another person, whether harboring inappropriate ambitions or fearing the pressure of facing two Nascent Soul enemies, hearing those words might lead to vacillation.</p><p>A slight flaw in their Dao heart, and Lord Dongyang would succeed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, not arguing.</p><p>Right now, the most important thing was entering the Pointing Heaven Peak; he didn’t want any complications.</p><p>He would seek justice when he had the strength.</p><p>Seeing that both Qin Sang and Lord Dongyang remained tight-lipped, everyone looked at Qingjun.  Could there be some grievance between her and Chenyan?</p><p>Qingjun got straight to the point.  “Regardless of Qin Sang’s sect affiliation, his contributions are undeniable. Most of you were present when this matter was agreed upon, you won’t have forgotten, will you?”</p><p>Before her words had finished, a relatively young cultivator from the Heavenly Path Alliance chimed in, “Indeed, thanks to these two youngsters, I only lost my physical body; my Nascent Soul escaped in time.”</p><p>Saying this, he nodded kindly at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was delighted, quickly bowing to the man in gratitude.</p><p>True One Daoist nodded slightly. “The other youngster has already been rewarded; it wouldn’t be fair to show favoritism. Daoist Leng’s meaning is clear to me.  Young friend Qin, you wish to enter Pointing Heaven Peak to cultivate secret arts using the peak’s abundant stellar energy? Such arts are rare in the world.  What kind of technique is it, and will its cultivation process affect the fragile space of Pointing Heaven Peak?”</p><p>Demon Lord Tongyou also said, “Whether the Purple Micro Palace celestial array’s power will continue to weaken remains uncertain.  Before that, the Stellar Essence Stones and the Little North Star Stellar Array cannot be lost.”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Revealing the secrets of the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique would be disastrous. If others learned that my physical cultivation surpassed my spiritual cultivation, trouble would surely follow.</p><p>Thankfully, my senior sister was there to help.</p><p>Qing Jun quickly interjected, “I’ll take him there to unlock the restriction.  Before entering, I will personally seal his true energy, guaranteeing no damage to the Finger Heaven Peak.”</p><p>Daoist Zhen Yi and the Demonic Lord Tong You exchanged a glance.</p><p>Tong You nodded.  “With Daoist Leng personally vouching, there should be no problem.”</p><p>To Qin Sang’s surprise, Lord Dong Yang didn’t interfere. “I believe Daoist Leng wouldn’t intentionally damage Finger Heaven Peak.”</p><p>The leaders of the righteous and demonic paths of Xiaohan region successively voiced their support.</p><p>Seeing this, Daoist Zhen Yi pondered for a moment, then turned to a helmeted warrior beside him.  “Jiugu, accompany Daoist Leng.”</p><p>…</p><p>“You may leave now. Wait for me at the bamboo building.”</p><p>Qing Jun transmitted her voice.</p><p>“Yes! Junior is taking his leave!”</p><p>Qin Sang turned and left, relieved.</p><p>It had gone surprisingly smoothly; he hadn’t had to expend much effort to gain permission to enter Finger Heaven Peak.</p><p>Leaving the hall, Qin Sang overheard the Yuan Ying cultivators discussing the war. He sensed a faint but persistent gaze upon him.</p><p>He paused briefly, then quickly walked away.</p><p>Now, he needed to focus on refining the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique, without distraction.</p><p>Back at the bamboo building, Qin Sang waited for two full hours.</p><p>As twilight deepened, Qing Jun returned.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance Yuan Ying cultivator, Jiugu, and a Xiaohan region demonic Yuan Ying cultivator arrived together, and accompanied Qin Sang as they immediately flew toward the depths of the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>Finger Heaven Peak constantly shifted its position within the Yun Cang Great Marsh.  Locating it required combining the talismans of the Tianxing Alliance and Xiaohan region to sense the peak’s restriction.</p><p>They flew for an unknown distance.</p><p>The four stopped over a vast expanse of water, produced complete talismans, channeled their true energy, and after a brief sensing, altered their course northeast.</p><p>After flying for some time, Qin Sang saw a familiar sight.</p><p>In the night, a beam of light descended from the heavens, connecting the stars above to the marsh below.  A peculiar energy pulsed within the beam, the surface of the water shimmering like mercury, a mirror-like reflection. There was the entrance to Finger Heaven Peak.</p>
