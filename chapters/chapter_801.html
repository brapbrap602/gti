<h1>Chapter 793: A Proposal for Cooperation</h1><p>Cui Ji's personal wealth was meager, not matching his status and power.</p><p>Picking up the flying dagger magical treasure, Qin Sang revealed a satisfied expression. No wonder it was so sharp. Like the Golden Yao Lock, it was a mid-grade magical treasure. Cui Ji must have spent a fortune to acquire it.</p><p>Qin Sang, having obtained an opportunity and greatly improved his swordsmanship, decided to continue on the path of the sword. He erased Cui Ji's mark from the magical treasure and stored it away for the time being.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist Priest, for helping me kill an enemy."</p><p>Madam Liu, having calmed down after her earlier outburst, extended her jade-like fingers, wiping away the bloodstains on her face and smoothing her hair. She thanked Qin Sang, her eyes unusually calm, like a stagnant pool.</p><p>At this moment, she no longer showed any trace of fragility, having been forged in the midst of adversity.</p><p>"Madam Liu, there's no need for thanks. I acted in my own interest as well."</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Madam Liu. "From what you said, it seems there's more than one enemy. Could Cui Ji have conspired with others to kill Fellow Daoist Liu?"</p><p>Madam Liu nodded, her words measured, "There's also Xiang Yi and the one surnamed An, though the one surnamed An is already dead."</p><p>So it was them.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. After asking a few questions, he learned that when they were leaving the forbidden zone, they were attacked by a terrifying beast.  The couple had a chance to escape, but were ambushed by Xiang Yi and the others.</p><p>As a result, the fat one surnamed An was unlucky and lost his life to the beast.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Liu desperately saved his wife, but he himself failed to escape. The young swordsman's whereabouts remained unknown.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was greatly surprised.  There were such terrifying beasts even in the outer regions of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.  From Madam Liu's description, its strength was no less than the beast leader guarding the purple crystals.  Fortunately, he had been delayed by the young man and the Nine Nether Devil Fire, otherwise, he might have encountered the beast himself.</p><p>"I must be careful next time I enter the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone to collect the Nine Nether Devil Fire…"</p><p>Qin Sang inquired about the beast's location and cupped his hands towards Madam Liu. "Madam Liu, the Seven Killing Palace will soon close. I'll take my leave now. Farewell."</p><p>As he turned to leave, he was suddenly stopped by Madam Liu.</p><p>"Daoist Priest, please wait!"</p><p>Madam Liu called out to Qin Sang. "Daoist Priest, we have both been harmed by these villains. Why don't we join forces for revenge? Xiang Yi's cultivation is extremely high. I heard him say that as long as this trip goes smoothly, he can reach the peak of the late stage after leaving the Seven Killing Palace, just one step away from Nascent Soul. His strength is far beyond Cui Ji's.  Fighting alone, we may never have a chance. Only by joining forces can we possibly avenge ourselves."</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, and said indifferently, "My enemy is dead. Why bother?"</p><p>Madam Liu's heart was filled with urgency, and she quickly said, "I don't know what happened to the Daoist Priest at that time, but if the Daoist Priest thinks that Cui Ji was the only one who wanted to kill you, you are gravely mistaken.</p><p>"When the Daoist Priest disappeared, my husband asked everyone to go back and search.  Unable to find the Daoist Priest, we had to give up.  At that time, my husband became suspicious and had always been wary of Cui Ji.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, the three of them had colluded long ago.  It was definitely not Cui Ji alone who plotted against the Daoist Priest.  If the Daoist Priest appears outside, and Cui Ji is missing, Xiang Yi will definitely guess something. With his ruthlessness, how could he let it go?</p><p>"If the Daoist Priest doesn't want to live in hiding and constantly look over your shoulder, the wisest choice is to strike first and eliminate Xiang Yi.</p><p>"If the Daoist Priest agrees, though I am unworthy, I will be responsible for tracking their movements.  There's no need for the Daoist Priest to worry.  When the time comes, you just need to kill them like you did today.  Moreover, I have obtained a spiritual medicine. After taking it, I will be able to cure my chronic illness and greatly increase my cultivation. I will not be a burden to the Daoist Priest.</p><p>"As long as the Daoist Priest agrees, after we take our revenge, all the spoils of war will belong to the Daoist Priest. I only want their lives!"  Madam Liu said resolutely.</p><p>Qin Sang turned around, seemingly hesitant.</p><p>In reality, he had already decided to kill Xiang Yi and the other one. This was just a test to see how determined Madam Liu was.</p><p>Peak late stage and just breaking through to late stage were two different concepts.</p><p>The main reason Qin Sang could kill the young man was the terrain.</p><p>Outside the poisonous land, although his swordsmanship had greatly improved, without using the fire pearl, he would be somewhat strained against Xiang Yi and would need to plan carefully.</p><p>Xiang Yi had a strong background and was very alert. Finding an opportunity to ambush him when he was alone would not be easy. If Madam Liu was determined to seek revenge, she would indeed be an excellent partner.</p><p>Qin Sang had cultivated the identity of Daoist Priest Qing Feng for decades and had a close relationship with the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce. This identity was very useful.</p><p>Xiang Yi had the backing of the East Pole Alliance Leader, a powerful figure. Qin Sang didn't want to be targeted by him.  Indeed, as Madam Liu said, only by eliminating Xiang Yi could he continue to use this identity.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's hesitation, Madam Liu mistakenly thought she had persuaded him, her face lighting up with joy. She handed a strangely shaped bronze bell to Qin Sang. "Daoist Priest, if you agree, please go to Skyrise Island and give this bell to…"</p><p>Madam Liu told Qin Sang how to contact her.</p><p>Qin Sang took the bell, thought for a moment, and said in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoist Liu, let me remind you, do not be blinded by hatred. If Xiang Yi senses your eagerness for revenge and sets a trap, I can still escape with my遁术, but you may never have the chance for revenge again."</p><p>Madam Liu's expression turned serious, and she nodded in agreement.</p><p>After a brief discussion, the two made an oath and parted ways.</p><p>Qin Sang went to a hidden place, removed his cloak, and returned to his original appearance.</p><p>Thanks to Cui Ji's interference, the trip to Flower Fairy Lake was cancelled.  Even the seemingly safe outer regions of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone harbored terrifying beasts.  Flower Fairy Lake was definitely filled with countless dangers.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang decided not to go to Flower Fairy Lake and go directly to the wasteland to wait.  If he couldn't find what he was looking for, he would go to the three islands outside the storm.  He wasn't sure if he could find the bone flute.</p><p>He determined his direction and flew towards the wasteland.</p><p>On the way, Qin Sang took stock of his gains from this trip.</p><p>Several magical treasures went without saying, but the most important was the jade slip. It not only completed the Killing Talisman, but also contained a Body Outside Body divine ability.</p><p>The earlier the Body Outside Body was refined, the better. He would strive to increase its cultivation before the next entry into the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>The corpses of low-level cultivators were not difficult to find. Killing was commonplace in the cultivation world.</p><p>The origins of those spiritual fruits were unknown. He could go to Skyrise Island and find a Grand Alchemist to appraise them.</p><p>However, what Qin Sang was most concerned about was the Nine Nether Devil Fire. It was related to a top-grade magical treasure, and he would definitely go all out.</p><p>Refining the black iron pillar into a flagpole required a lot of preparation.</p><p>Skyrise Island was the best place to gather these materials.  Moreover, Skyrise Island had the largest human city, where it was easiest to gather information.  For the sake of Spirit Turtle Island and Senior Qing Zhu, he had to make the trip.</p><p>Pondering these matters, before he knew it, Qin Sang had arrived at the edge of the wasteland.</p><p>He hid in a mountain, overlooking the wasteland.</p><p>All the way back to the wasteland, Qin Sang didn't see any further trace of the Nascent Soul cultivators from the two races. He suspected that after obtaining what they wanted, they had already left the Seven Killing Palace.</p>
