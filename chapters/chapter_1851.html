Chapter 1842: Armies Converge

Recalling the Crimson Gold Spirit Needles and the nearby illusions, Qin Sang attempted to discern some pattern, to find a clue, but to no avail.  He ceased wasting his mental energy.

Cultivating for a time, Qin Sang awoke from his meditative trance.  After a moment of contemplation, he summoned his Altar.

Within the Altar, the Divine Firmament Thunder Seal, formed by his Dharma Body's true form, slowly rotated, already showing signs of solidification.

His thoughts shifted. The Rune Form carrying the Five Thunders Secret Art appeared in his mind and decomposed into the next Dispersed Form to be refined into the Altar.

However, the Thunder Turtle demon cores used to refine the Altar had almost been depleted of their power. Qin Sang had yet to hunt down another Thunder Beast.

While auctions and trade fairs were frequent in Ju Shan Zhi, high-grade Lightning-attribute spirit objects that met his requirements were extremely rare. Even if they did appear, they would likely fall into the hands of the True People of the Left and Right Thunder Mansions, leaving none for itinerant cultivators like him.

Rune Forms, the Dao Court, and the Left and Right Thunder Mansions' scriptures related to Dharma Arts all flashed through Qin Sang's mind.

With the explanations of past sages, comprehending Rune Forms wasn't difficult. Qin Sang quickly grasped the essence and silently activated his Dharma Body.

Both the Azure Roc Dharma Body and the Phoenix Wings materialized, filling the cave dwelling with azure light.

Next, Qin Sang planned to use his Azure Roc Dharma Body to draw upon the Azure Roc's Primordial Lightning Power within the Phoenix Wings to forge the Altar!

Qin Sang had entertained this idea for a long time. Every time he explored the Altar, he would take the opportunity to deepen his understanding of the Dharma Body and the Phoenix Wings and make attempts.

After repeated trials, Qin Sang now had considerable confidence that he could draw out a trace of Primordial Lightning Power from within the Phoenix Wings.

The only question was whether the Altar could withstand the Azure Roc's Primordial Lightning Power.

If the rank of a spirit object was too high and its power too strong, it could backfire on the spirit apertures, causing the Rune Forms to scatter and the Altar forging to fail. There had been precedents for this in the early stages of Altar forging.

Qin Sang had no precise understanding of the rank of the Azure Roc's Primordial Lightning Power, but the Azure Roc's cultivation before its death was undoubtedly far greater than his own.

Qin Sang still wanted to try. The reason was that, with the integration and gradual completion of the Tier Three Dharma Art's Aperture Merging Form, the Altar was far more stable than it had been and should be able to withstand a stronger impact.

He wanted to test the Altar's limits.

If successful, he wouldn't need to seek external resources.

The Azure Roc Dharma Body circled above his head and then dove into his body. Qin Sang's aura transformed. The feathers on the Phoenix Wings trembled slightly, their luster flowing and becoming even more brilliant and crystalline, each feather like a jade carving.

Qin Sang slightly narrowed his eyes, his mind connecting with the Dharma Body. The power of the Dharma Body seeped into the Phoenix Wings, sensing the presence of the Primordial Lightning Power.

This power was very quiet within the Phoenix Wings. Once touched, its violent nature, surpassing even Heavenly Lightning, became apparent.  However, it showed no hostility towards Qin Sang.

The Phoenix Wings were originally a part of Qin Sang's body, and the Primordial Lightning Power had coexisted with him for so long that they were already showing signs of merging.  Moreover, with the integration of the Dharma Body, Qin Sang's aura was close to that of a true Azure Roc.

After a slight hesitation, Qin Sang used the power of the Dharma Body to envelop the Primordial Lightning Power and tentatively nudged it.

No backlash occurred.

Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He cautiously attempted to draw out the Primordial Lightning Power, his movements extremely careful.  He failed countless times before finally managing to draw out a trace and guide it out.

The moment the Primordial Lightning Power left the Phoenix Wings, an azure lightning flash instantly illuminated the entire cave dwelling, incredibly dazzling.

Qin Sang couldn't help but squint his eyes.

Nothing could be seen with the naked eye. Only within Qin Sang's perception did that trace of lightning power truly exist, slowly moving towards him.

At the center of the lightning glow, there was an extremely minute thread of lightning power. Although tiny, it still maintained the shape of a lightning bolt.

Observing it for a moment, Qin Sang murmured, "From now on, I'll call you Azure Roc True Lightning…"

The Azure Roc True Lightning resembled a living creature, constantly coiling and unfurling, yet it remained relatively stable.

After carefully experiencing it for a while, Qin Sang continued, using this thread of Azure Roc True Lightning to trace the Rune Form he had just comprehended.

Perhaps due to the affinity between the Azure Roc True Lightning and his own aura, Qin Sang was surprised to find that controlling the Azure Roc True Lightning to depict the Rune Form wasn't difficult.

Before long, an azure Rune Form appeared in the void. Electric arcs constantly flickered within the Rune Form, giving it a very dangerous aura.

The higher the rank of the spirit object, the less was needed.  A mere trace of Azure Roc True Lightning was enough to construct a complete Rune Form.

The next step, embedding the Rune Form into the Altar, was also crucial.

Qin Sang's expression became serious. He guided the Rune Form to slowly approach the Altar.  As lightning flickered, it began to merge inward.

Before the Rune Form could fully embed itself, the Altar suddenly vibrated violently. The Divine Firmament Thunder Seal became illusory at a speed visible to the naked eye.  Immediately afterward, a rich azure light erupted within the Altar, making it appear as though the entire Altar might explode at any moment.

Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He instantly executed several hand seals, forcibly peeling the azure light away from the Altar.

With a wave of his sleeve, the stone gate of the cave dwelling burst open, and the azure light shot out like a swimming dragon.

‘Crack!’

‘Rumble…’

A deafening thunderclap resounded throughout the flower field.

At this moment, the entire space was filled with azure light.  A bolt of azure lightning seemed to cleave the sky, vanishing in a flash.

The sound of thunder echoed, lingering for a long time.

Qin Sang stood before the cave entrance, watching the spectacle created by the Azure Roc True Lightning’s eruption. Recalling the previous moment, he couldn't help but feel a lingering fear.

The Azure Roc True Lightning's rank was clearly too high, the disparity too great. It had surpassed the Altar's limits.

It was a pity that, despite its high rank, the amount he could control was too small, making it ineffective for the time being.

"That Azure Roc truly wasn't ordinary…"

Qin Sang recalled the process of obtaining the Azure Roc True Lightning and couldn't imagine why such powerful divine beasts had become so weak, hiding within a Small Thousand World.

He turned back to the cave dwelling and saw the frightened Fire Jade Centipede huddled in a corner, trembling.

His first attempt had failed, and success seemed almost impossible.

Yet, Qin Sang saw a glimmer of hope within this failure.  He sat back on the meditation mat, gazing at the Altar with a contemplative expression.

After several days of intense thought, Qin Sang finally sorted out his thoughts and began a second attempt.

The initial steps were the same as before, still using the Azure Roc True Lightning to construct the Rune Form.  But when embedding the Rune Form into the Altar, Qin Sang's mental expenditure was several times greater than before.  It was no longer a simple embedding, but an active guidance of the Azure Roc True Lightning's aura, integrating it into every Rune Form and every corner of the Altar.

The Rune Form and the Altar weren't simply superimposed but combined with the previous Rune Forms to become a unified whole. The Initial Stage Jade Clarity Summoning Lightning Talisman, the Tier Two Flowing Gold Fire Bell Lightning Summoning, and the Tier Three Five Thunders Secret Art were all interconnected.

Qin Sang's actions were equivalent to simultaneously reinforcing the foundation while constructing the Altar and mitigating conflicts. This required a deep understanding of Dharma Arts and the properties of spirit objects, as well as exquisite control. The slightest discrepancy would result in complete failure.

This was difficult for ordinary cultivators, and even Qin Sang wouldn't have been able to succeed on his own. He dared to attempt it only because of the Azure Roc Dharma Body.

As it turned out, Qin Sang's idea was feasible.

As the Rune Form successfully embedded itself into the Altar, becoming one with it, a faint smile appeared on Qin Sang's lips.

The Altar seemed to be tinged with a faint azure light.

Qin Sang sensed the Altar. He intuitively felt that integrating the Azure Roc True Lightning would bring changes to the Altar, but it had just begun, and the changes weren't obvious.

Perhaps, this Altar, this Divine Firmament Thunder Seal, would no longer be used solely for stabilizing True Essence…

Qin Sang thought to himself.

With the Altar situation settled, he felt relieved and continued his tireless cultivation.

During Qin Sang’s meditative cultivation, the outside world had undergone a dramatic change.

Battles between the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom were constant, but the speed of this change in the situation was unprecedented.

The sects and itinerant cultivators in Ju Shan Zhi, those with less connection to the Dao Court, only realized the changes after they had occurred.

Even many Dao Court Immortal Officials and Daoist cultivators only learned of the war's location—not the Yellow Springs Path, but the Sinful Wasteland—when the armies assembled and marched north.

The Ghost Fang Kingdom had been scheming with the Demonic God for many years, yet the Dao Court hadn't shown any major reaction, only engaging in minor skirmishes.

Many people thought that the Demonic Path might not be the true path and that the Dao Court had tacitly approved, waiting to see the Ghost Fang Kingdom's downfall. They believed there wouldn't be a war.

Unexpectedly, the Dao Court’s actions were swift and decisive. The Ghost Fang Kingdom’s reaction was equally fierce.  It seemed a world-shaking battle was about to erupt in the Sinful Wasteland.

For a time, Ju Shan Zhi was filled with anxiety, countless eyes focused on the north.

…

For several months, Qin Sang remained secluded.

One day, he was suddenly awakened. His eyes opened, divine light flashing like lightning, seemingly penetrating the stone gate and looking out at the world.

Stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Sang rose to his feet. The Celestial Eye Butterfly immediately landed on his shoulder.

Then, with a flash of light, Qin Sang appeared outside the cave dwelling, standing in mid-air, facing the entrance of the flower field space.

Just now, a mark had been destroyed.

The marks he could sense from within the cave dwelling were all near the flower field space.  Someone had entered the Altar and was not far from him!

While he was pondering, another mark lost its connection.

"Could it be Dao Court Immortal Officials or Ghost Fang Kingdom's demonic creatures…?"

Qin Sang frowned. This was what he least wanted to see.

While others wouldn't dare to stay long in the Ju Shan Zhi Altar, for him, it was a sufficiently peaceful cultivation sanctuary, isolating him from the outside world's disturbances and providing the spirit pills and medicinal herbs he needed for cultivation.

A situation like the last time was acceptable.  He was most afraid of the two major forces sending people into the Altar to wreak havoc, even altering the Altar's structure.

This wouldn't only affect his search for the path to ascension but also potentially impact and destroy the flower field's great formation, damaging his cave dwelling.

Qin Sang formed a hand seal, concealing his aura, and quietly left the flower field, approaching the location of the mark.

Not long after, Qin Sang sensed another mark being destroyed.  In his mind, he traced the other party's path.

The other party was just passing through, not coming for him.

Qin Sang had placed the marks in concealed locations within some of the illusions, places that would inevitably be triggered if others entered.  These three marks were in a straight line and had been destroyed in quick succession.

The other party was moving in a straight line, at high speed, with an air of ease.

He had been in the Altar for so long, and this was the first time he had detected the presence of others nearby. The other party shouldn't be revisiting a familiar place.

These signs were enough to deduce that the newcomer was very powerful!

…

Massive boulders drifted within a void space.

These boulders resembled fragments of shattered mountains, bound here by an unknown force, constantly drifting yet unable to land.

Smaller stones and even dust particles surrounded the boulders, forming vast dust belts, all revolving around the largest boulder at the center.

At this moment, several figures appeared at the edge of the boulders.  There were seven or eight of them.  Just as they leaped onto a boulder, a cry of alarm came from the front.

One of them, caught off guard, landed headfirst, sticking tightly to the boulder's surface, enduring a terrifying suction force.

Then, blood seeped from their skin, pooling on the boulder's surface.  Their entire body began to shrivel.

However, these individuals were powerful and remained calm in the face of danger.  They each used their divine abilities to forcibly push themselves off the boulder's surface.

Their companions also moved to rescue them. A small flag appeared, floating in the void.  As the flag's light shone, the pressure on them lessened considerably, allowing them to stand firmly.

They gathered together, rested briefly, and then, under the protection of the small flag, traversed the area.

Just as they departed, a figure appeared at the edge of the dust belt. It was Qin Sang.

Watching the direction they had left, Qin Sang's expression was grave.

The other party was powerful. Qin Sang hadn't approached too closely, but he could confirm that they weren't human.  They were Nascent Soul demon cultivators, and among them were Nascent Soul late-stage powerhouses.  Despite the distance, he vaguely sensed a threat.

So many Nascent Soul demon cultivators entering the Altar, working in such close coordination, must have a clear objective.

Qin Sang's ominous premonition grew stronger.

He thought for a moment, then abandoned the idea of following them, deciding to check the situation outside first.

Whether to avoid the Altar, fish in troubled waters, or retreat to his cave dwelling depended on understanding the overall situation.

Turning back outwards, Qin Sang's expression gradually darkened.

As he traveled, he sensed more marks being destroyed, and not just in this one direction.

More than one force had entered the Altar.  If Dao Court Immortal Officials were also present, and their strength was comparable to those demon cultivators, a great storm was brewing within the Altar!

Arriving outside, Qin Sang stopped at the location of a former mark and scanned his surroundings.

He hadn't encountered anyone here.  Qin Sang wasn't sure if the Dao Court had sent anyone. He could only choose a direction and follow.

However, with the situation unclear, rashly getting involved seemed unwise.

Qin Sang pondered, then suddenly turned towards the entrance of the Altar.  This time, the scale of the event was even greater than the last. There must be support outside the Altar. The strength of the support could also reveal some information.

With this thought, Qin Sang immediately set off, passing through the Nine-Bend Star River. After confirming there was nothing unusual outside, he entered the Golden Palace.

Everything within the Golden Palace was as usual.

For some reason, after stepping into the Golden Palace, Qin Sang sensed a murderous aura, as if he had entered a battlefield. This was something he had never experienced before.

There were clearly no figures present.

He became even more cautious, employing various secret arts and treasures to conceal his aura and form, moving stealthily through the Golden Palace. He didn't see any cultivators or demon cultivators along the way.

Unimpeded, he arrived near the Altar's exit and chose a Cloud Path, entering the auspicious clouds.

Not long after traveling within the auspicious clouds, Qin Sang's figure suddenly froze, instinctively retreating.

Through the Celestial Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang vaguely saw the scene outside.

His face instantly darkened.

Outside the Altar, dark clouds obscured the sky.  Behind the dark clouds, golden light radiated in myriad rays, accompanied by lightning and thunder. Countless extraordinary phenomena filled the sky.

The dark clouds to the east were clearly mixed with demonic aura. As the sea of clouds churned, ranks of bizarre figures stood in formation, banners fluttering, their numbers impossible to count.

The other direction was equally impressive, but besides demonic soldiers, there were also Daoist figures.  Among the demonic soldiers, Altar lights flickered like towering platforms, stretching in rows as far as the eye could see.

The two sides had arrived at some point, confronting each other across the plains before the Altar, a great battle imminent.

Behind the two armies, extraordinary phenomena constantly manifested. Qin Sang recognized them at a glance as the celestial phenomena caused by Soul Formation cultivators!

Armies converged, with Soul Formation cultivators personally overseeing the battle.

This turn of events had surpassed his wildest imagination! (End of Chapter)
