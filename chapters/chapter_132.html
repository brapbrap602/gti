<h1>Chapter 125: Practicing Double Cultivation</h1><p>When passing through Jianmenguan City Gate, Qin Sang saw that the peach blossoms at Jianmenguan City Gate had fallen and given way to many delicious looking ripe peaches that overflowed from their clusters. Suddenly inspired, he descended and gathered several red jade peaches. As expected, the peaches were full of juice and very sweet. They were much tastier than those spiritual fruits planted by Sun De and did not at all resemble mortal fruits.</p><p>Qin Sang kept some peach pits, with the intention of planting them in his cave dwelling when he returned to the Cloud Mist Great Marsh and enjoying them regularly.</p><p>Returning to Daoist Gate Peak, Qin Sang hastily exchanged greetings with several familiar senior brothers and senior sisters, and then rather anxiously made his way to the Wooden Hall, but he did not see Steward Wen and only Steward Zhuang was present.</p><p>The two of them were on good terms. Steward Zhuang invited Qin Sang to sit and gave him an amused look as he asked with a grin, “Junior Brother Qin, did you also come back because of the Treasure Gourd Illusion?”</p><p>What was the Treasure Gourd Illusion?</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyebrows knitted together slightly. He had never heard of such a thing before.</p><p>However, his mind was currently filled with the mysterious orchid and he did not respond. Instead, he asked, “Senior Brother Zhuang, I was ordered by Steward Wen to exterminate demons in the Ancient Abyss Country. Now that the situation has been dealt with, I have returned to report my results to Steward Wen, but where is he at the moment?”</p><p>Steward Zhuang let out an “Oh,” and produced a jade slip, saying, “So Junior Brother Qin has been in the Ancient Abyss Country and has not yet seen the decree that the Headmaster gave… But Steward Wen is currently within the Treasure Gourd Illusion and has left me to take care of miscellaneous matters here. I wonder about the demonic situation in the Ancient Abyss Country. Could Junior Brother Qin first tell me the ins and outs of the matter, and I will record it? If you require assistance, I can assist you in deploying troops and commanding generals.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought that reporting to Steward Zhuang was a good idea.</p><p>He did not intend to report the complete story of what had happened to the sect, but if he covered up too much, there would inevitably be loopholes that Steward Wen might see through.</p><p>As long as this matter passed, nobody would be interested in the demonic possession of a Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang replied in a casual manner, “I do not need any assistance. It was only a matter of Senior Brother Gu, who was stationed in the Ancient Abyss Country by the sect, being tempted by an evil technique and causing harm to the mortal world. He killed a considerable number of mortals. He was very good at disguising himself in the past, but he let his true character slip this time. Once I found out, I immediately executed Senior Brother Gu. This corpse belongs to Gu Yuan, Senior Brother Gu’s disciple, and we can see the abnormal changes that have taken place in his body. Moreover, we can also look at this evil technique that we found on Senior Brother Gu, and I am not sure about how to deal with it.”</p><p>Qin Sang handed Gu Yuan’s corpse and the Corpse Pill Secret Technique to Steward Zhuang.</p><p>Steward Zhuang read it and shook his head in regret, saying, “This Senior Brother Gu was muddle-headed and made a grave mistake. His death was deserved. There is a long-standing tradition with respect to this type of evil technique that it must be destroyed on the spot. I believe that the hidden threat behind this evil technique is very great, and Junior Brother Qin, please do not be tempted by it. I really do not wish to have to fight you next time I exterminate demons.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and said, “I wouldn’t do that of course.”</p><p>Watching Steward Zhuang finish writing, Qin Sang secretly nodded his head. Even though he wanted to quickly borrow a badge and go to the Pagoda Peak, he had no choice but to wait until Steward Wen came out of the Treasure Gourd Illusion, so he patiently inquired, “Senior Brother Zhuang, I wonder what the Headmaster’s decree and the Treasure Gourd Illusion are that you spoke of earlier?”</p><p>Steward Zhuang’s eyebrows suddenly flew up, his expression somewhat sleazy as he chuckled for a while and said, “This is a great opportunity. Junior Brother Qin, you can take a look at this Headmaster’s decree first.”</p><p>With that said, Steward Zhuang used a sword talisman to send Qin Sang a copy.</p><p>The decree read: Real Person Ma Wu, a Golden Core cultivator from Mount Shaohua, wishes to seek a Dual Cultivation Daoist companion. Requirements: Male disciples at Foundation Establishment, or those under 40 and above Qi Refining Level 10, and must be virgins. The cultivation technique involved in this Dual Cultivation has extremely high requirements and a successful result in the Treasure Gourd Illusion is required to proceed, and this is merely the first test.</p><p>After Qin Sang had finished reading the text of the decree, he wondered, “Searching for someone for Dual Cultivation in a forthright manner?”</p><p>Watching Qin Sang’s expression, Steward Zhuang said with disdain, “What is Junior Brother Qin thinking? Our sect contains several Yin Yang Dual Cultivation methods. These are all orthodox techniques of Mysterious Sects. Brothers who have reached the Foundation Establishment stage often seek out Daoist companions and choose to use Dual Cultivation techniques. Not only are the techniques beneficial in themselves, but they can also involve an extremely advanced Daoist companion, which would be very useful whether for fighting or exploring. Why wouldn’t you do it? It is just that I have never heard of a technique with such strict requirements. It is likely that this is an extremely profound secret technique, and Real Person Ma Wu must have had no choice but to request that the Headmaster issue the decree.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded upon hearing this. Even though he had only recently embarked on the path of cultivation, he was not a clueless novice. He was simply a bit surprised because he had never seen such a situation before.</p><p>Yin and Yang resonate, Heaven and Earth unite.</p><p>As Zhuangyan said, the way of Yin-Yang Transformation is indeed the orthodox method of the Profound Gate Sect. It differs from the evil and wicked method of cultivation and absorption employed by the Black Sect. Unlike the wicked method which leads to one party solely benefiting at the expense of the other, the cultivation method of Yin-Yang Transformation offers benefits to both parties. It is certainly not an evil method.</p><p>"Who exactly is this Daoist Mawu?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the stories he had heard about the Golden Elixir Master and Nascent Soul Supreme Master of the Shaohua Mountain during his time there. However, he had never heard of this Daoist Mawu.</p><p>Zhuangyan replied: "I was told he is a personal disciple of the Dongyang Ancestor Master. He is cold and aloof, uninterested in worldly affairs. He has been cultivating in seclusion at the Cloud Mist Marsh and very few people have heard of him. I have only heard of him a few times myself, and have never met him in person."</p><p>"Disciple of the Ancestor Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, and he did some mental calculations before he continued: "This Daoist Mawu must be at least a few hundred years old by now. Do you know what he looks like?"</p><p>Zhuangyan scoffed: "Appearance is only skin deep. Qin Shidi, do you really care so much about age? Even as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, how much longer can you live? Don't tell me you won't die sooner than he will."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Zhuangyan. "Zhuang Shidi seems very eager. Why don't you give it a try at the Pearl Continent Illusion?"</p><p>"Who wouldn't be eager for a chance to become Daoist Companions with a Golden Elixir master? If you can hug his thigh, there's no telling how many Foundation Establishment pills you'll get. You might even have the chance to break through to the Golden Elixir stage. This is your shortcut to the heavens. Look at Uncle-Master Wen, he has already taken over the mundane affairs of the sect and given up all hope of cultivating. He hasn't given up this chance though. It's a pity…"</p><p>Zhuangyan face suddenly filled with extreme regret and he let out a long sigh. "When I was young, I was weak and the maid in my house was too fierce. She took my youthful essence very early on… Otherwise, how could I have allowed someone else to reach the summit before me!"</p><p>Looking at how vain Zhuangyan was, who actually took advantage of who was anyone's guess.</p><p>Noticing that Qin Sang had nothing to say, Zhuangyan assumed that Qin Sang still did not think much of it. He immediately grew serious and said: "If Qin Shidi has yet to lose his youthful essence, take my advice and give it a try. There's no need to be shy. We cultivators live and die for a chance at success. Now that such a chance is in front of us, it would be a pity to let it slip away."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>The youthful essence of this body had indeed not been lost.</p><p>Qin Sanwa was still young when Qin Sang had possessed his body. His life had been filled with constant fighting and battles, with the exception of meeting the Dongyang Princess who he had admired. However, their paths were incompatible and their values differed. After becoming the feudal lord, he had killed the crown prince the following day. He did not even get to enjoy the luxurious life for a single day.</p><p>He had joined the Ghost Sect afterward. To survive, he constantly walked on thin ice and his sole focus was on cultivation. He had never thought of anything else.</p>
