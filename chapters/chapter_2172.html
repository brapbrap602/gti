<h1>Chapter 2162: Success</h1><p>A green light shot out from the treasure orb, which instantly lost its color and returned to its original appearance.</p><p>The next moment, the green light transformed into a Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal.  The power of thunder immediately erupted, and instantly, blue lightning descended from the sky, striking the Rainbow Array.</p><p>Under the violent impact of the radiant light, the ancient temple and the Rainbow Array suffered severe damage.</p><p>Most of the rainbow beams that formed the Rainbow Array had dissipated, and most of the remaining beams were cracked and crumbling. The array was riddled with holes and could no longer protect the halls below.</p><p>The halls collapsed and were destroyed in large swathes; those that survived were protected by restrictions, but like the ancient temple, they suffered varying degrees of damage.</p><p>For Si Huang’s side, this unexpected change was advantageous. The radiant light not only forced Dingyuan Hou and his companions to retreat, reversing the situation, but also helped them destroy the Rainbow Array. Otherwise, even if Si Huang had summoned Qin Sang and used the treasure orb, they might not have been able to open the ancient temple.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Blue lightning pierced through the gaps in the Rainbow Array.</p><p>Seeing the blue lightning heading towards the ancient temple—all this happened in the blink of an eye—the Xu Yi tribal high priest's divine power failed, and it was too late to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The blue lightning struck the main gate of the ancient temple directly.</p><p>In an instant, a dazzling clear light pierced the eyes, and the temple was engulfed in lightning. Even under the influence of the radiant light, everyone could feel the powerful fluctuation of the thunder's might.</p><p>The temple's restrictions showed extremely violent fluctuations, giving a sense of imminent collapse, as if it would be broken through the next moment. Once the ancient restrictions were broken, nothing would stand between Qin Sang and the treasures within the temple.</p><p>Seeing this, the Xu Yi tribal high priest roared in fury.  With Dingyuan Hou and another expert assisting with all their might, a Xuan light broke through the yellow clouds, finally completely breaking free from the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram's restraint.</p><p>The Xu Yi tribal high priest successfully broke the deadlock, followed closely by Dingyuan Hou and the other expert.  Black and white were clearly visible in the gap in the yellow clouds, two powerful forces pushing forward forcefully, but they were already too late to participate in the contest; all hope rested on the Xu Yi tribal high priest alone.</p><p>The Xu Yi tribal high priest did not rush to stop Qin Sang.  He appeared above the yellow clouds, his three eyes shining brightly, shooting out tangible rays of light. Six silver beams converged in mid-air, flashing and transforming into a silver knife.</p><p>The silver knife was small and exquisite.  The blade pointed downwards, emitting a powerful blade glow, fiercely slashing towards the yellow clouds.</p><p>At the same time, the long roar from the Xu Yi tribal high priest continued incessantly. The roar stirred up a strange celestial phenomenon, and a black vortex appeared in the radiant light. The vortex spun rapidly, and suddenly a huge bird's claw stepped out of it, its claws sharp as swords.</p><p>His choice was undoubtedly correct. As long as they worked together inside and outside to help Dingyuan Hou and the others escape, they could hold back Si Huang and the Shao Shi, and he only needed to deal with Qin Sang alone.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had displayed various outstanding abilities, cultivation could not be faked. The Xu Yi tribal high priest was a true late-stage powerhouse; the advantage still lay with them.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The black vortex seemed to be shattered by the bird's claw, and then a second bird's claw emerged.  The vortex finally disintegrated, revealing a three-headed, six-tailed divine bird. The bird resembled a black crow in appearance, its eyes fierce, it stared intently at Qin Sang's back, ready to pounce.</p><p>Unbeknownst to it, the moment the blue lightning pierced through the Rainbow Array, Qin Sang inexplicably felt a warning. When the blue lightning was about to strike the temple, his unease reached its peak. Without hesitation, instead of seizing the opportunity to take the treasure, he retreated hastily.</p><p>Qin Sang’s action caused the divine bird to pause, hesitating for a moment, and it looked towards the ancient temple. The restrictions outside the temple were on the verge of collapse. At this moment, the Rainbow Array unexpectedly changed.</p><p>The rainbow beams melted away, all turning into white clouds, condensing into a huge white cloud that floated above the ancient temple, emitting an extremely violent fluctuation.</p><p>This fluctuation seemed like a last gasp of the Rainbow Array, originating from the change in the ancient temple's restrictions.  Perhaps it was the array's final transformation, and also its deepest hidden trap, revealed as the array was on the verge of collapse and the temple was about to be breached!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sudden change made everyone feel the danger and their faces changed. That cloud was like a blood and flesh mill, capable of devouring the lives of all those who entered it.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly rejoiced. It seemed simple to strike the temple with the treasure orb, but in reality, it was fraught with danger. Luckily, he was cautious enough, and the Si You Royal Clan had vaguely sensed the secrets hidden in the secret realm and had been prepared, so they hadn't fallen for the trap.</p><p>Danger often accompanies opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang's retreat at this moment meant he voluntarily gave up the treasures within the ancient temple, presenting an opportunity for his opponents.</p><p>The Yi tribe's High Priest's gaze was fixed on the ancient temple.  He clearly understood the priorities, immediately abandoning his attack on Qin Sang.  His three-headed bird's wings beat, its form flickering repeatedly, leaving afterimages in the void as it sped towards the temple.</p><p>Si Huang had also been watching the temple.</p><p>If the final incident hadn't occurred, he could have simply asked Qin Sang to retrieve the treasures.  Based on their previous agreement, in this situation, Qin Sang wouldn't risk his life for the treasures; Si Huang would have to rely on himself.</p><p>Si Huang and Qin Sang almost simultaneously sensed the change in the White Rainbow Formation. He immediately relinquished control of the Unstable Eight Extremes Diagram, entrusting it entirely to Shaoshi.</p><p>At this point, Dingyuan Hou and his companion, aided by the Yi tribe's High Priest, were about to break through the yellow clouds.</p><p>Shaoshi acted decisively, altering his hand seals. The yellow clouds surged, twisted, and merged, instantly transforming into a rope of Xuanhuang energy, coiling and winding.</p><p>The yellow clouds and the earth vanished, the diagram's power completely integrated into the rope. The rope writhed, agile as a serpent, with Dingyuan Hou and his companion right in the middle.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Before they could react, the ends of the rope rose like whips, lashing out at them.</p><p>Only the afterimages of the whips were visible, the sound and spectacle earth-shattering.  The rope carried not only devastating power but also binding power.  If struck, they wouldn't die, but would be tightly bound.</p><p>Simultaneously with the diagram's transformation, Si Huang's golden crown sprang forth, rotating and emitting a dazzling golden light rivaling the glow of the setting sun.  The golden light descended upon Dingyuan Hou and his companion, seemingly immensely heavy, causing the void to tremble during its descent.</p><p>Dingyuan Hou and his companion wouldn't simply wait for their demise. With Qin Sang's retreat and the Yi tribe's High Priest charging towards the temple, all they had to do was stall Si Huang and Shaoshi, preventing them from interfering with the High Priest, and the treasures would be theirs!</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>A bell tolled.</p><p>Dingyuan Hou, at some point, had summoned a small black-gold bell.  His movements followed the bell's rhythm, light and shadow flickering around him, transforming into a phantom giant bell. The rope wrapped around the giant bell again and again. The bell, though burdened, compressed inwards, proving remarkably strong and showing no signs of shattering.</p><p>The man in black armor, inexplicably, had brought a black mountain, perfectly countering the golden crown.</p><p>The two worked in perfect coordination, instantly devising the best response. Their gazes shifted, fixing on Si Huang and Shaoshi, ready to counterattack.</p><p>However, Si Huang, who had been planning for a long time, had more than just these preparations. His figure suddenly faded, vanishing into thin air.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>At the edge of the White Rainbow Formation, a small beast appeared from nowhere.</p><p>The creature resembled a weasel, with bright eyes, but then froze, transforming into Si Huang's likeness. It was his familiar, hidden here undetected.</p><p>Upon reappearing, Si Huang underwent another transformation. His body rapidly expanded, his hands and feet morphing into enormous bear paws. He transformed into a giant bear, roaring and charging recklessly towards the temple.</p><p>The Yi tribe's High Priest almost reached the White Rainbow Formation at the same time as Si Huang, but he encountered an obstacle.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A sword flashed from an oblique angle, its light blinding.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>"Get lost!"</p><p>The three-headed bird roared, its voice filled with a peculiar rhythm that echoed, each sound louder than the last, until it sounded like thunder.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a powerful shock wave attempting to shake his soul, wave after wave.</p><p>He used the same trick again, feigning pain and struggle.</p><p>It was possible for a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator to withstand the Yi tribe High Priest's supernatural powers. If he showed no signs of being affected, it would be too shocking, and Qin Sang wasn't ready to reveal his abilities.</p><p>Among the Yi people, there were many tribes who followed the spiritual cultivation path. Although spiritual cultivation techniques are not solely aimed at the soul, Qin Sang, relying on the jade Buddha, would undoubtedly have a significant advantage against spiritual cultivators.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>With a furious roar, the three-headed bird raised its claws, striking the sword light.</p><p>The sword light violently shook, almost being knocked away.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed. Spiritual cultivation was indeed not so simple.  He wondered what kind of secret technique had formed this three-headed bird's spiritual body; its power was not inferior to that of a late Nascent Soul physical cultivator!</p><p>As before, no matter how pained Qin Sang appeared, he stubbornly persevered.</p><p>With a shift in his sword technique, the light stabilized, then a dense darkness emanated from the blade.</p><p>The Four-Symbol Sword Formation!</p><p>And he unleashed a triple layered attack!</p><p>Tiger's Roar! Phoenix's Cry! Dragon's Howl!</p><p>Three star demons appeared simultaneously, their swords imbued with a sharp and powerful intent.  They dived down, merging in mid-air into a single, dazzling light visible only as a brilliant starlight.</p><p>For the first time, a look of apprehension crossed the three divine birds' eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang, still having time to observe, glanced at Si Huang, who had already charged into the sacred realm.</p><p>Approaching the ancient temple, Si Huang’s form faltered slightly under the immense pressure emanating from the white cloud.</p><p>Only those present could understand the terrifying weight of the pressure.  Si Huang, transformed into a bear, bled profusely, his body instantly crimson. Skin peeled away, revealing bone.</p><p>Si Huang's speed didn't falter. Before his bear form completely collapsed, he expelled a cloud of grey energy, transforming into a one-horned linhsi. The bear form crumbled to dust, but the linhsi continued onward.</p><p>Soon, the scene repeated itself, each transformation mirroring Si Huang's companion beasts.  Only when one foot was inside the temple did he revert to his human form.</p><p>The cost was evident in his pale face, yet Si Huang was spirited, his eyes alight as he gazed into the temple. With a gesture, a beam of light shot from within the temple and settled in his palm.</p><p>The light dispersed, revealing a small treasure box.</p><p>The box was square, inlaid with precious jewels that shimmered with light, and a small silver lock hung from the front.</p><p>There was no time for admiration. Si Huang didn't unlock the silver lock, instead slowly turning.</p><p>At that moment, all eyes were fixated on the box in Si Huang's hand.</p><p>The Xu Yi tribe's High Priest, though hindered by Qin Sang—who hadn't used his full strength—quickly broke through the barrier, but he was a step too late, watching helplessly as the treasure fell into Si Huang's hands.</p><p>On another battlefield, the Shao Shi, outnumbered two to one, was quickly overwhelmed.  Fortunately, aided by Si Huang's golden crown, he remained uninjured.  Seeing Si Huang succeed, he immediately retreated.</p><p>Si Huang held the box aloft, stepping out far more easily than he had entered.</p><p>The moment he possessed the box, the white cloud solidified, the formation's power dissipated, and the radiant light rapidly faded. The chaos seemed to subside, and the sacred realm was about to vanish.</p><p>The battlefield fell into a tense silence; both sides stood poised.</p><p>Si Huang walked out of the sacred realm, a slight smile on his lips. “Thank you, Dingyuan Hou and my two friends, for scouting the path for me!”</p><p>Dingyuan Hou's eye twitched, his gaze icy as he scanned Si Huang and Shao Shi, lingering a little longer on Qin Sang before letting out a cold snort.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>With the treasure in Si Huang's possession, killing him here was impossible. Further fighting would only serve to vent frustration, achieving nothing.</p><p>Many other sacred sites and ruins remained to be explored.  This temporary setback meant little.</p><p>The Xu Yi tribe’s High Priest withdrew his spirit body, giving Qin Sang one last deep look before retreating with Dingyuan Hou.</p><p>Si Huang watched them leave, putting away the box without pursuing them.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, sensing the killing intent in Dingyuan Hou’s eyes, unsure if he was being blamed. However, harmony in the sacred grounds was impossible.</p><p>Qingyangzhi was within the Zhuyan tribe’s territory, so Qin Sang wasn't worried about Dingyuan Hou retaliating there. He would simply need to be more cautious.</p><p>"Our success in obtaining the treasure and repelling our opponents is largely due to Master Qin."</p><p>Once Dingyuan Hou and his companions had vanished, Si Huang smiled, formally bowing to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang modestly replied, "Your strategies were unmatched, anticipating the opponent's every move, leading to this great victory."</p><p>Si Huang smiled again, avoiding any argument over credit. He produced several items and offered them to Qin Sang. "These treasures were found in the same cave as the [missing name of jewel], on the same shelf.  The [missing name of jewel] was tucked in a corner, looking quite unremarkable. The cave's location is marked on this jade slip. Master Qin may wish to investigate further; there may be other discoveries to be made."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted them without hesitation, glancing over them. The most valuable seemed to be a spirit treasure, while the rest were mostly unremarkable. A few items were peculiar; Qin Sang couldn't discern their use for the moment, planning to study them later.</p><p>Finally, there were two jade slips. The first contained a topographical map drawn by Si Huang. The second was found with the [missing name of jewel], but its contents were chaotic and contained no techniques or secret arts.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, disappointed at missing the chance to use the techniques to potentially deduce the [missing name of jewel]'s origins.</p><p>With a fleeting thought, he stowed the treasures and turned towards the fading light.</p>
