<h1>Chapter 985: Imminent Crisis</h1><p>“A feeling…”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>At that moment, the fire curse rune flared again, the emanations seemingly stronger than before!</p><p>Qin Sang’s face changed drastically. He spun around sharply, but the sea above was empty.</p><p>…</p><p>Daya Island.</p><p>North of the market town, a secluded mountain range was occupied by a single sect, the market town being their property.</p><p>Clouds shrouded the deep mountains.</p><p>A streak of light pierced the air and disappeared into the mountain gate.</p><p>Immediately, a young man, clutching a talisman, rushed towards the main peak on his flying sword.</p><p>Moments later, the young man landed before a grand hall on the main peak.  A deep voice suddenly boomed from within the hall, “What urgent matter requires such haste?”</p><p>The young man quickly bowed, “Reporting to Master Uncle, an urgent message from the market town.”</p><p>Inside the hall.</p><p>A stern-looking elder held a black chess piece.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The chess piece was placed.</p><p>The elder raised his head slightly, beckoned with his hand, drew the talisman into his grasp, and closed his eyes to examine it.</p><p>The man playing against him glanced over, curiously asking, “With Third Junior Brother personally overseeing the market town, is there something he can’t handle?”</p><p>After examining the talisman, the elder uttered a soft ‘Hmm’, “The left deputy envoy of the Qiongyu Trading Company of the East Pole Alliance was assassinated in the market town while attempting to kill an unknown cultivator. He was defeated and killed, along with Manager Liu; a total of six Foundation Establishment cultivators perished without a single survivor…”</p><p>Another man exclaimed in surprise, “How many people were there? How strong were they?”</p><p>“It is said that there might have been only one person; the others were either illusory forms or corpses.  A single person killed the deputy envoy and his party unscathed…”</p><p>The elder stated solemnly.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Another man gasped, “Even you and I might not be able to defeat the left deputy envoy, let alone his entourage.  Did they offend some Nascent Soul Grandmaster? The Qiongyu Trading Company won’t let this go lightly with so many losses.  Is Third Junior Brother planning on requesting the Master’s intervention…”</p><p>The elder shook his head, resolutely declaring, “Those who died were merchants, not righteous cultivators. It’s just dogs biting dogs. Why disturb the Master over such a trifle?  Before the Qiongyu Trading Company even comes knocking, that ‘Zuo’ dared to publicly declare that he would bear all responsibility and summoned help in the name of the East Pole Alliance.  As expected of a large trading company, incredibly wealthy and powerful! I was planning to rebuild the market town anyway, now someone’s paying for it. I'll send someone to demand compensation…”</p><p>…</p><p>An unknown distance southwest of Daya Island.</p><p>Cloudless skies.</p><p>On the vast expanse of the sea, a streak of light suddenly appeared.</p><p>The light moved like a shooting star, even Qin Sang would have to admit its speed was superior.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The light abruptly stopped, revealing a figure, the island master of Tianfeng Island, Mou Laomo.</p><p>He had been lingering near Dongmen Island. Upon receiving the news, he rushed here at full speed, getting closer and closer to Daya Island.</p><p>He seemed to sense something, slowed his flight, and glanced towards the northeast. A blue light flashed between his brows, and a blue flame emerged.</p><p>Under the sunlight, the blue flame appeared incredibly ethereal, gently swaying.</p><p>Mou Laomo's lips moved slightly, his hand seals changing rapidly as runes flowed into the blue flame. The blue flame flickered, becoming more substantial, then sharply tilted towards the northeast.</p><p>Seeing this, Mou Laomo's eyes narrowed slightly, “The East Sea deputy envoy of the Qiongyu Trading Company’s cultivation was considerable, a top-tier Foundation Establishment cultivator. Even if he couldn’t win, he wouldn't have misdirected the fire curse…”</p><p>Upon this thought, Mou Laomo’s expression brightened, and he produced a strangely shaped small drum.</p><p>The strange drum was a top-grade magical artifact.</p><p>Mou Laomo cackled, “Dare to use demonic fire to refine artifacts! If I hadn’t discovered this artifact on someone during soul searching, you might have escaped…”</p><p>When Qin Sang first arrived at the Demon Sea, he was recruited by the Qiongyu Trading Company to refine artifacts for them. At that time, his skill was far inferior to what it was now. To gain their trust and favor, he used the Nine Nether Demonic Fire to forge some top-grade artifacts; this strange drum was one of them.</p><p>Because the drum contained a trace of demonic fire, a Foundation Establishment cultivator mistakenly identified it as a treasure hidden by divine light and bought it from the Qiongyu Trading Company. He only later realized that it was useless, and tossed it aside.</p><p>By a twist of fate, the drum fell into Mou Laomo’s hands.</p><p>Mou Laomo put away the drum, beckoned with his hand, and the blue flame floated into his palm.</p><p>With a thought, the blue flame tilted once more.</p><p>Mou Laomo let out a sinister laugh, and his light resumed its flight, piercing through the air.</p><p>…</p><p>Upon entering the Seven Kills Hall, he learned that the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was also present here.</p><p>Qin Sang, fearing discovery, had never used the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to refine artifacts for others.  Even in battle, he always suppressed its fluctuations to avoid attracting attention.</p><p>The only artifacts he'd ever refined with the demon fire were few in number.  Furthermore, they were merely artifacts, not treasures. The demonic aura was well-concealed; typically, high-level cultivators wouldn't bother examining a simple artifact.</p><p>Unexpectedly, these artifacts malfunctioned.</p><p>Across the vast ocean, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of green light, fleeing north at top speed.  Almost half an hour had passed since the fire curse first afflicted him.</p><p>Then, the curse flared again.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes darkened as he stared at the curse mark on his arm.  Sensing its fluctuations, his gloom deepened into furious apprehension.</p><p>As he and Bai had suspected, the Deputy Commander had contacted Old Master Mou before arriving. The repeated activation of the fire curse was clearly Mou's doing.  After the first two times, the intervals shortened, sometimes to a mere few dozen breaths.  Each time, the curse's power increased, indicating Mou was rapidly closing in.</p><p>Mou could locate Qin Sang through the curse; conversely, Qin Sang could vaguely pinpoint Mou's position via the curse's fluctuations.  The changing intensity confirmed Mou's approach.</p><p>The good news was Qin Sang hadn't seen Mou yet. But the ability to trigger the curse from such a distance was terrifying.  The curse's strangeness, coupled with the power of a Yuan Ying cultivator, filled Qin Sang with both dread and urgency.</p><p>Mou could sense his location at any moment; changing direction was futile.  Faced with imminent danger, Qin Sang could only flee north.</p><p>His enemy was a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator. Even at his best, Qin Sang could barely scratch him.  But surrendering the Eighteen Demon Banners was unthinkable.</p><p>He didn't believe Mou would spare his life after seizing the banners.  A demonic ancestor wouldn't lack methods of torture.  Falling into Mou's hands meant a fate worse than death.</p><p>"Friend Bai, have you remembered anything?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the corpse puppet bag and asked, unable to contain himself.  During his flight, he'd tried countless methods to counter the curse, his only hope resting with Bai.</p>
