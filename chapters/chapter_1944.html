<h1>Chapter 1935: The Green Sheep Temple</h1><p>A large stone crashed to the ground, bounced, and tumbled down the hillside, across the mountain path, finally landing in a ravine.</p><p>Grass flew everywhere, a tremendous roar echoing through the mountains.</p><p>The young man, using every ounce of his strength, scrambled to safety, narrowly escaping being crushed by the very trap he had set.</p><p>“Huff, huff!”</p><p>He gasped for air, turning his head upward.</p><p>A poisoned dart was embedded in a tree trunk, a weasel’s body hanging lifelessly from it. Its head, tail, and limbs dangled weakly,妖 blood mingling with dark green poison flowing down the dart.</p><p>The weasel remained motionless, apparently dead.</p><p>But the boy dared not relax.  Ignoring the pain, he propped himself up and reloaded his crossbow.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The bolt struck the weasel.</p><p>The weasel made no attempt to retaliate.  Hit by the bolt, its body swayed violently, still hanging from the dart, blood spraying.</p><p>Once he was certain the weasel was dead, the boy seemed to deflate, collapsing to the ground.</p><p>There was no pride in slaying a monster as a mere mortal; instead, he lay on the grass, staring blankly at the sky, murmuring, “Master, I have finally avenged you!”</p><p>Tears streamed down his cheeks.</p><p>Memories flooded back—how warm and loving those days had been, and how desperately sad this moment felt.</p><p>His mother had been frail and passed away when he was young. His father, a hunter, died in the mountains when he was eight.</p><p>At eight years old, he had to support himself. His relatives and friends were kind but poor, unable to take him in, though they helped as much as they could.</p><p>He knew he was a burden and tried his best not to trouble anyone, supporting himself.</p><p>Then his master appeared, teaching him to read and write, imparting wisdom.</p><p>His master encouraged him to study, accepting no fees, and his master's wife showed him exceptional kindness, giving him a long-lost sense of family.</p><p>But happiness was short-lived.</p><p>One day, his master went to town to buy paper and ink for his students.  He never returned that night. The whole village searched, finding only a corpse.</p><p>His master's death was gruesome—his chest was ripped open, his organs missing, his blood drained, leaving him a desiccated corpse.</p><p>The boy remembered vividly the shock, the feeling of being struck by lightning, when he confirmed the body was his master's.</p><p>His master was the first victim of the weasel, and others followed, one after another.  The village organized several hunts, but they were unsuccessful; instead, the weasel killed more people in the chaos.</p><p>No one dared to speak of hunting the monster again.  The boy found no allies, but the flames of revenge never died.</p><p>He knew that monsters were powerful, and any mistake could mean death.  But he had to do it, to avenge his master, or he would be unworthy of the name of son!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Pain ripped through the boy's thoughts.</p><p>He raised his left arm; the pain intensified, forcing him to stop halfway. He removed a piece of metal from his arm; the wound was horrific.</p><p>His insides must have been injured, his organs feeling like they’d been squeezed by a giant hand.</p><p>The boy stuffed a cloth into his mouth, biting down hard.  He tended to his wound, gasped for air, and struggled to his feet, moving to the tree, tugging at the dart.</p><p>The dart was firmly embedded in the trunk; he had little strength left and couldn't pull it out.</p><p>He removed the weasel from the dart, picked up one as a cane, and limped back.</p><p>The village was surrounded by earthworks, with fortifications and patrols added after the weasel appeared.</p><p>Reaching the village, the boy was exhausted.  He raised the weasel high, shouting, "I killed the monster!"</p><p>Then he collapsed.</p><p>…</p><p>Xiao Wu and Zhu Que, having watched a month’s worth of drama, finally saw the curtain fall, still wanting more.</p><p>Qin Sang, oblivious to the outside world, focused solely on repairing the thunder altar, becoming increasingly skilled, restoring it to 90% functionality.</p><p>Within a month, he successfully restored the thunder altar.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang activated it, and as expected, it established a faint connection with the other two altars.</p><p>He focused all his attention on the connection, triggering another transformation in the altar.</p><p>Simultaneously, the positions and relationships of the three thunder altars were mapped out in his mind.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>Above the altar, thunder roared and lightning flashed.</p><p>Qin Sang was bathed in lightning, unharmed, each electrical surge unique, representing a new change.</p><p>Through these transformations, using the other two altars for comparison, Qin Sang's deductions became clearer, ultimately pointing towards a specific location.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed.  Though he still couldn't sense the main altar, knowing its location made the search much easier, unless it had been completely destroyed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The lightning vanished into the altar, and the thunder altar fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed the thunder altar with a formation and prepared to immediately search for the main altar.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang emerge from the crevice, Xiao Wu and Zhuque looked over.</p><p>“Repaired?” Zhuque asked.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  “I've located the main altar…  Wait, Taiyi brought someone, waiting in the distance. Perhaps they have a discovery.”</p><p>He sent a signal, summoning Taiyi.</p><p>Shortly after, a white cloud drifted from afar, bearing Taiyi and an elderly Daoist.</p><p>“Master, this is Jing Chun, the Abbot of Xin Huo Temple.”</p><p>Following Luo Hou’s example, Taiyi addressed Qin Sang as “Master” in front of others, and introduced the elderly Daoist. “This is my Master, his dharma name is Qingfeng.”</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Qingfeng.”</p><p>Jing Chun, having debated Daoist principles with Taiyi for days, was deeply impressed. He showed utmost respect to Qin Sang, whom even Taiyi addressed as “Master.”</p><p>Through Taiyi’s account, Qin Sang learned that Xin Huo Temple was the largest sect in the vicinity, possessing a lineage of thunder Daoism.</p><p>Taiyi had essentially investigated this lineage. Though connected to the Heavenly Court's Thunder Department, it wasn't particularly noteworthy.  Worried about a misjudgment, he summoned Jing Chun for Qin Sang's review.</p><p>Jing Chun, for reasons unknown, answered all of Qin Sang’s questions truthfully.  Unfortunately, Xin Huo Temple’s legacy proved unimpressive.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to leave when Zhuque stopped him, acting coy.</p><p>“There's a good show we haven't finished watching! A few more days won't hurt, wait a bit longer!”</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond, Jing Chun exploded in anger upon learning the situation.</p><p>“A monstrous beast wreaking havoc?  Such a thing! Our temple has an agreement with the Divine Path; no Earth God temples are established nearby.  Our sect is responsible for this area. This incident is our oversight. Please forgive our inadequacy.”</p><p>Jing Chun was indignant, but if he acted consistently with his words, the boy wouldn't have had to struggle, and the monster would have been killed the moment it harmed someone.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal. He glanced at Xiao Wu and said, “Since you're interested, waiting a few more days is fine.”</p><p>Several people sat down on the ground.</p><p>Jing Chun was anxious.  Only when he saw Qin Sang wasn't blaming Xin Huo Temple did he relax.</p><p>With nothing better to do, Qin Sang asked Jing Chun about any ancient legends in the area.</p><p>Jing Chun racked his brains, recounting various legendary stories. Most were absurd, but some were interesting, though impossible to verify.</p><p>Sixth day.</p><p>A rainbow-like light appeared in the distance, heading straight for them.</p><p>“The main players have arrived.”</p><p>Zhuque chuckled, glancing at Jing Chun, with an expression of anticipation for another good show.</p><p>Everyone stood up, concealed their forms, and disappeared from the mountaintop.</p><p>The rainbow light was a遁光 , enveloping a flying shuttle carrying a man and a woman.</p><p>Both were young, with elegant appearances and attire befitting noble children.</p><p>The man comforted the woman, “Don’t worry, sister. The aura is getting clearer. The Jade Dragon Sable is definitely nearby. That little guy managed to escape from my manor; it's very clever. It won't provoke strong enemies, at most it'll eat a few mortals. It'll be fine.”</p><p>“You still say that!”</p><p>The woman was full of resentment.  “It’s all your fault! You insisted your people would take good care of it, letting me entrust it to your manor, and now it's gone. If anything happens to my Jade Dragon Sable, I'll go to Master and make you answer for it!”</p><p>“Alright, alright, I'll answer for it. If the Jade Dragon Sable is dead, I'll compensate you with a new one, and I'll have those maids killed to vent your anger, alright?”</p><p>The man carefully apologized with a smile.</p><p>“I don’t want a new one; I want my Jade Dragon Sable!”</p><p>The woman’s lips pouted.  Suddenly, her face lit up with surprise.  “I found it!”</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The rainbow light descended from the sky, above a village.</p><p>The two appeared above the village, their gaze falling on the north side, where a small Earth God temple stood.</p><p>Seeing the scene within the temple, the woman's face turned pale, while the man's face turned ashen.  The boy had brought back the sable's corpse, becoming a village hero. No one dared to eat the monster’s corpse; it was offered to the Earth God.</p><p>“Who! Who dared to kill my sister’s Jade Dragon Sable!”</p><p>The man raged.</p><p>Seeing the wounds on the Jade Dragon Sable, the woman wept with grief, while the man was stunned.</p><p>These wounds…”</p><p>The man felt no trace of magic or magical artifacts.  There was no Earth God in the temple.  He said incredulously, “Could it have been ordinary people who killed the jade marten?”</p><p>Even the weakest jade marten was a spirit beast. How could ordinary people withstand its magic?</p><p>The man's shout alarmed the entire village. Villagers, young and old, poured out of their homes, following the roar to the temple, where they saw the couple.</p><p>“They're gods!”</p><p>Someone noticed the couple were levitating, and cried out, causing an uproar.</p><p>“Real gods!”</p><p>“The gods have appeared! They’re here to slay the demon!”</p><p>…</p><p>The villagers chattered, never imagining that the demon was owned by a god, and genuinely believed the gods had come to vanquish evil.  Their eyes were filled with fervent belief.</p><p>“Who killed my junior sister’s jade marten? Step forward!”</p><p>The man’s eyes were like knives, his killing intent palpable.</p><p>The woman, without turning around, hugged the marten’s corpse and wept.</p><p>The villagers finally realized something was wrong. They looked at each other, silent as the grave, dodging the man’s intense gaze.</p><p>“I killed it!”</p><p>A strong, resonant voice rose from the crowd.  The village elder stepped forward.</p><p>“Village head…”</p><p>Someone started to speak, but the elder silenced him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>The village head stood before the gods, his spine as straight as an arrow.  “This demon slaughtered more than a dozen people in our village alone, ripping them open and draining their blood, leaving behind nothing but carnage. I killed it to avenge my people! If you immortals wish to avenge this beast, kill me instead.  Don't harm others. This old body has lived long enough.”</p><p>These words weren't solely directed at the immortals, but also to the villagers behind him.</p><p>The villagers understood.  The village head was old; the youth was young. The elder had slain the demon for them, a true hero, willing to die in their stead.</p><p>The elder’s family could only weep softly.</p><p>Several strong men surrounded the youth, holding him back from any rash actions.</p><p>“Heh…”</p><p>The man sneered, “You mortals dare deceive this immortal to our faces? Your crime is compounded! Come out!”</p><p>A thunderous roar nearly shattered the villagers' souls.</p><p>The youth felt his body tense, lifted by a tremendous force, involuntarily flying through the air before crashing to the ground.  The men who tried to intervene were thrown back, spitting blood, unable to rise.</p><p>The village head’s attempt to take the blame couldn't escape his discerning eye. A faint resentment clung to the youth, proving his guilt.</p><p>But the man didn't believe the youth acted alone, and sneered, “Who else? Did the entire village participate?”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>The village head’s face turned ashen. The man intended to massacre the entire village!</p><p>“The demon could eat people, but we can’t fight back? What kind of justice is that!” the youth cried out in grief and anger.</p><p>“Hmph! What are you? A bunch of ignorant peasants, daring to reason with this immortal!”</p><p>The man kept an eye on his junior sister; this display was meant to appease her.  “No one’s stepping forward, is there? Good!”</p><p>Seeing his junior sister remain unresponsive, the man raised his hand, palm forward. Five fingers, like swords, shot out five beams of energy, striking towards the villagers.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A furious shout echoed from above.</p><p>Seeing the man about to slaughter the villagers, Daoist Jingchun revealed himself, dispersing the energy beams with his shout. Qin Sang and the others landed on the ground.</p><p>“Senior Jingchun!”</p><p>The man’s face turned pale at the sight of Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>The woman trembled, dropping the marten's corpse, her face drained of color.</p><p>Their sect held some power, but even their master would bow before the head of the Xin Huo Temple.</p><p>“Damn it! You raised a spirit beast that harmed people, yet you indiscriminately slaughter the whole village!  Two fine disciples of the Yin Xiao Sect!”</p><p>Daoist Jingchun’s sharp words were like a thunderbolt, leaving the two kneeling and trembling.</p><p>“Senior, how should we punish these evildoers?” Daoist Jingchun’s actions sent them into further terror.</p><p>“Since your sect has established its laws, administer justice impartially,” Qin Sang turned to Xiao Wu and Zhuque, “Had enough of a show?”</p><p>“Boring! Too weak. A Nascent Soul cultivator would be more entertaining,” Zhuque shook its head and tail, its arrogant tone shocking even Daoist Jingchun.</p><p>“You dare to think so.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. If he really attracted a Nascent Soul cultivator, this incarnation wouldn’t stand a chance.</p><p>“This matter is settled. We take our leave.”</p><p>The group bowed to Daoist Jingchun before departing.</p><p>The villagers, having experienced such extremes in such a short time, were finally coming to their senses. They realized these immortals were good, they were saved.  They knelt down to thank them.</p><p>“Mingyue, the immortals saved us. Hurry and thank them for saving our lives!”</p><p>Seeing the youth still dazed, the village head pulled him forward, and they knelt together.</p><p>Qin Sang, already turning to leave, stopped abruptly and looked back at the youth, “Your name is Mingyue?”</p>
