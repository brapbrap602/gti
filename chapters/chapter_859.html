<h1>Chapter 851: The Western幽 Alliance</h1><p>“Fellow Daoists, did you escape from the Demon Isle?  What happened there? Why such a strange phenomenon and beast frenzy?”</p><p>The three hovered above the sea, looking towards the direction from which Qin Sang and Su Nü had come, and at the chaotic Demon Isle behind them.  Their expressions were varied. All three men were Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>The man in the center, with a handsome beard and about fifty years old, wore Daoist robes similar to Qin Sang’s. He exuded an otherworldly aura and was a late-stage Core Formation grandmaster.</p><p>The other two were also quite powerful.</p><p>This wasn’t surprising. Only cultivators of such strength would dare to travel in the current state of the Demonic Sea.</p><p>It was the bearded man who had spoken.</p><p>Su Nü was only at the Foundation Establishment stage. The bearded man glanced at her without much interest, his gaze ultimately settling on Qin Sang, whom he scrutinized.</p><p>However, his companion on the left, dressed in extravagant finery like a wealthy merchant, stared intently at Su Nü with an odd look.</p><p>Uncomfortable under the merchant's gaze, Su Nü hid behind Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his gaze and said, "We were on a small island nearby when the commotion on the Demon Isle startled us. We came to investigate but were unfortunately caught in the stampede. It was quite dangerous, but we managed to retreat before alerting any powerful demons on the island. As for what actually happened, I'm not sure."</p><p>"Is that so? Our cave is also nearby, yet we haven't seen you two before."</p><p>The bearded man looked towards the Demon Isle, seemingly believing Qin Sang's words.</p><p>A mid-stage Core Formation cultivator with a Foundation Establishment companion was unlikely to cause such havoc on the Demon Isle and escape unscathed.</p><p>The Demon Isle was vast and home to powerful demons, including a formidable overlord whom even he was wary of.</p><p>"May I know your names? Since you're hiding here, I presume it's also because of the demonic unrest outside. My surname is Cang. I'm a member of the Western幽 Alliance.  I was too slow to escape when the unrest began. Our human territories were ravaged by the beast tide, leaving no corner untouched. Countless cultivators perished. With nowhere to go, like you, I thought the most dangerous place might be the safest. I escaped into the demon territory and found a deserted island to hide."</p><p>He paused, then continued, "Although temporarily safe, we live in constant fear. Since fate has brought us together, I'd like to invite you to join forces. With more people, we'll be stronger and can support each other.  This is Fellow Daoist Liu, whom I met while escaping..."</p><p>The bearded man gestured to the man on his right, introducing him.</p><p>The three major merchant alliances were highly respected and influential in the Demonic Sea.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Liu also added words of encouragement.</p><p>"The Western幽 Alliance?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the young man from the Western幽 Alliance he had killed in the Seven Slaughter Hall.</p><p>He wondered if these three had any connection to that young man.</p><p>He still needed to meet with Immortal Yue and naturally wouldn't accept Cang's invitation.  Seeing that they seemed harmless, he felt relieved. He bowed slightly, declined politely, and activated his escape technique to leave.</p><p>Suddenly, the wealthy merchant flew forward and whispered something to Cang.</p><p>Cang's pupils constricted slightly as he stared at Su Nü.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang and Su Nü about to leave, the wealthy merchant grew anxious. He raised his voice, "Fellow Daoists, please wait! I have a question.  I sensed something peculiar about this young lady's aura, somewhat similar to the legendary True Demonic Qi. Could I be mistaken?"</p><p>"So what if you're right? So what if you're wrong?"</p><p>Su Nü, already annoyed by the merchant's stare, retorted sharply.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Su Nü's outburst and was unable to stop her. He glared at her.</p><p>He didn't know how they had detected the True Demonic Qi within Su Nü, but this wasn't the time for childish behavior.  It was best to smooth things over and avoid further complications.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you're mistaken. True Demonic Qi is a legendary power wielded by ancient demons.  Even Nascent Soul ancestors of the demonic path cannot withstand its erosion. She's only at the Foundation Establishment stage. How could she possibly handle it? This girl is mischievous and speaks without thinking. Please don't take her seriously."</p><p>Qin Sang spoke calmly, feigning another attempt to leave.</p><p>"Don't misunderstand, Fellow Daoist."</p><p>Cang's expression remained unchanged as he flew forward and patiently explained, "My junior brother meant no harm. His cultivation technique is similar to this young lady's, and he merely wished to exchange some insights.  With his cultivation level, he could easily offer her some guidance. She wouldn't lose out..."</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Seeing their true intentions, Qin Sang grabbed Su Nü's wrist and activated a talisman.</p><p>Su Nü, knowing she had made a mistake, lowered her head silently.</p><p>They transformed into streaks of light, shooting towards the sky like meteors.</p><p>Cang's eyes flashed coldly. "Junior brother, are you certain that girl possesses True Demonic Qi?"</p><p>The wealthy merchant nodded confidently. "Brother, you must have sensed it too. There's no mistake! Even if she doesn't have the Nine Revolutions Yin Body, being able to absorb True Demonic Qi means she's extraordinary.  The Alliance Leader has tasked us with finding a Nine Revolutions Yin Body, but such a physique is rarer than a Heavenly Spiritual Root. If we capture her, whether she has a special physique or cultivates some ancient demonic art, if she proves useful to the Alliance Leader and earns his favor, we won't have to worry about the spiritual materials needed for Nascent Soul formation!"</p><p>"Good! Chase them! Fellow Daoist Liu, you heard it. If we capture them, we'll put in a good word for you with the Alliance Leader..."</p><p>Cang and the wealthy merchant flashed and pursued.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Liu hesitated for a moment but followed closely behind.</p><p>On the Demon Isle, the demonic beasts were in complete chaos.</p><p>Off the island, several streaks of light chased each other across the sea.</p><p>Still some distance from the agreed meeting point, Qin Sang had already consumed a significant amount of energy. He thought they were safe, only to be pursued by powerful cultivators.</p><p>Although the trouble stemmed from Su Nü, the Mountain Vine and the teleportation talisman were with Immortal Yue.  For the sake of the treasures, he had to protect Su Nü at all costs and keep her out of the fight.</p><p>Knowing he could no longer hide, Qin Sang summoned the Two-Headed Serpent from his Twin Heart Ring.</p><p>The Demonic Sea was too dangerous to let Su Nü travel alone.</p><p>He ordered the Two-Headed Serpent to take her ahead while he held back their pursuers.</p><p>Su Nü, stunned as Qin Sang tossed her onto the Two-Headed Serpent, finally realized how deeply this mysterious Daoist had concealed his strength.  He even possessed such a powerful spirit beast.</p><p>"Take her to Immortal Yue..." Qin Sang commanded the Two-Headed Serpent.</p><p>The serpent roared, its back enveloped in green qi, firmly securing Su Nü. With a flap of its wind wings, it sped away.</p><p>Su Nü sat securely on the Two-Headed Serpent, her eyes vacant and lifeless.</p>
