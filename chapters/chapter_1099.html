<h1>Chapter 191: Seeking the Way</h1><p>“Let her decide when she wakes up.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the unconscious Su Nü.</p><p>He had only met Su Nü a few times, saving her each time for reasons unrelated to her personally.  They had barely interacted.</p><p>Qin Sang crushed the Ghost Seal, refusing to treat Su Nü as a true soul slave.</p><p>Firstly, he owed her a debt of gratitude for his survival.</p><p>Secondly, the incident with the Two-Headed Vulture had taught him that forcing someone's compliance was unsustainable and only bred resentment.</p><p>The Two-Headed Vulture had followed him for so many years, yet even the allure of the Tyrant Blood Fruit couldn't sway its desire for freedom, choosing to act as a decoy to escape his control.</p><p>If even a beast felt this way, how much more so a human?</p><p>Su Nü would never willingly become anyone's soul slave and would undoubtedly have safeguards in place. Given her ruthless methods of refining herself into a soul slave, Qin Sang knew he wouldn't sleep soundly if he kept her by his side.</p><p>It was better to let her go and foster goodwill.</p><p>Bidding farewell to the Bao siblings, Qin Sang followed Qing Zhu.</p><p>Neither Ling Zhu Zi nor the elder stopped them.</p><p>Qing Zhu led Qin Sang out of the space, through the river channel, and back to Ascending Heaven Peak, flying towards the summit without a word.</p><p>Suddenly, Qing Zhu faltered, nearly collapsing.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  Catching Qing Zhu, he smelled the pungent scent of blood and realized that Qing Zhu was covered in wounds.</p><p>Qing Zhu had been holding on, concealing his injuries from Ling Zhu Zi and the others.</p><p>“It’s nothing.”</p><p>Gripping Qin Sang's arm, his voice weak but his tone calm and composed, Qing Zhu said, “To the Nether Valley!”</p><p>“Senior, your body…”</p><p>Qin Sang's face was filled with worry. Qing Zhu's aura was incredibly weak, his life force rapidly fading.</p><p>He immediately took out the Three Lights Jade Liquid, intending to give it to Qing Zhu, but was stopped.</p><p>“My essence is shattered… Don’t waste such a divine medicine on me.”</p><p>He couldn't stop Qin Sang's insistence.</p><p>Qing Zhu stopped refusing and sighed. “Very well.  I have one last wish, and it concerns you.”</p><p>Qin Sang also took out the Soul Nourishing Wood Plaque.</p><p>“Senior, try this…”</p><p>Qing Zhu's face was full of surprise.  He smiled. “You are quite the treasure trove, Daoist. I remember your natal spirit sword chose a wood-elemental spirit object. No wonder you've cultivated to this realm so smoothly.  It's because of the Soul Nourishing Wood. You truly are blessed with great fortune…”</p><p>Qin Sang saw that Qing Zhu mistakenly believed the Soul Nourishing Wood was the reason he could cultivate the "Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture," and he let it be, offering no further explanation.</p><p>“I channeled sword intent into my body, annihilating the demonic soul and the Ancient Demon's fragmented soul. But my own essence was also shattered by the sword Qi, my divine soul flickering.  I’m only clinging to life thanks to the spirit sword fragment.  It's beyond saving.  The Soul Nourishing Wood can only prolong my existence for a little while…”</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid nourished his body, and the Soul Nourishing Wood's gentle light warmed his fragmented soul. Qing Zhu's complexion improved slightly.</p><p>But as he said, he was beyond saving. It was merely a brief resurgence.</p><p>When Qing Zhu channeled the sword intent into himself, Qin Sang had a premonition.  He hadn't expected that even the Soul Nourishing Wood couldn't save him.</p><p>Qin Sang silently asked Bai, but Bai had no solution either.</p><p>“He's different from me. I must have made arrangements to persist with a sliver of my soul. His essence was shattered by sword intent, fragmented beyond repair, his soul unable to coalesce.  If not for the fragment, he would have perished on the spot…”</p><p>Bai had also been affected by the demonic roar.</p><p>Fortunately, he had protected Ya Gu in time, and both of them only needed to rest to recover.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes dimmed.</p><p>This was his second encounter with Senior Qing Zhu, but they had been connected since he joined Lesser Hua Mountain.</p><p>Seeing Qing Zhu unhesitatingly channel the sword intent to strike himself, Qin Sang knew he had judged him correctly. If there had been a way to save Qing Zhu, he would have spared no effort.</p><p>“You must have many questions.”</p><p>They flew side-by-side towards the peak of Ascending Heaven Peak.</p><p>Qing Zhu looked up at the Sword Qi Hall bathed in the glow of the setting sun.  Lost in thought, he recounted his experiences to Qin Sang, from his teleportation from the Ziwei Palace to the Seven Kills Hall, and later in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Some of these events were related to Qin Sang, unraveling many mysteries for him.</p><p>“My teleportation to the Seven Kills Hall was the first time it appeared. The second time was when you were transported here, and the third was this time.”</p><p>Qing Zhu gazed into the depths of the glow, his voice echoing.</p><p>“Back then, my junior sister and I plotted to assassinate Leng Yun Tian in the Ziwei Palace to avenge our senior sister, but Leng Qian saw through our plan. We only managed to severely injure Leng Yun Tian. I was discovered by Leng Qian and pursued relentlessly. Worried about implicating my junior sister, I activated the teleportation formation after being injured and arrived here.”</p><p>Qing Zhu pointed above the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>“The ancient teleportation formation is located atop the Immortal Restriction, at the intersection of the inner and outer halls. I followed the white jade corridor, found the exit below, and made some arrangements to conceal the true passage. Remember the route, and use this talisman to return.”</p><p>He relayed the route to Qin Sang and passed him a talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately memorized the route, relieved to finally learn the location of the ancient teleportation formation and the way back to the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>“Thank you for your generosity, Senior.”</p><p>Qing Zhu smiled faintly. “No need for thanks. If I hadn't come here first, you would have been the first to discover the secret of the Immortal Restriction, and you wouldn't have gone through so much.”</p><p>Qin Sang listened attentively.</p><p>“I was teleported here, and from the Immortal Restriction, I reached the Nether Valley…”</p><p>Qing Zhu paused abruptly and asked, “Do you know the origins of the 'Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture' and this fragment?”</p><p>“I’ve heard the scripture originated from the Ziwei Palace, but I was unaware of the fragment's existence.”</p><p>Qin Sang searched his memory, but he had never heard of any fragment.</p><p>The spirit sword fragment was indeed connected to the "Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture."</p><p>This surprised Qing Zhu. “You're the one who has cultivated the 'Spirit Sword Nurturing Scripture' to the highest realm after me, aren't you? And unlike me, you haven't been plagued by the hidden danger of killing intent. When did Elder Dong Yang become so blind?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of shame. After a moment of hesitation, he didn’t hide anything from Qing Zhu, briefly explaining his entanglement with Chen Yan and Elder Dong Yang's schemes.</p><p>Qing Zhu chuckled. “I don't have any ill will towards Elder Dong Yang. Back then, Leng Qian was at the height of his power, and my cultivation path was arduous.  Anyone else in his position wouldn’t offend the Yuan Mirage Sect for a single disciple. However, Elder Dong Yang has always been dedicated to revitalizing Lesser Hua Mountain. If he knew he had driven away a disciple with the potential to reach Nascent Soul, I wonder what his expression would be…”</p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Sang was embarrassed, quickly saying he didn't dare to think so.</p><p>If he was a genius, then other cultivators were divine beings.</p><p>“Don't underestimate yourself! I see your vital essence and spirit are robust. You're cultivating both body and Dharma, possess the Soul Nourishing Wood, and have consumed the Soul Cleansing Liquid.  You have a greater chance of reaching Nascent Soul than others, and you'll definitely have the opportunity to stand before Elder Dong Yang with your head held high in the future.”</p><p>Qing Zhu seemed to anticipate such a scene.</p><p>“Cultivating both body and Dharma, is it helpful for reaching Nascent Soul?”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up, and he quickly asked Qing Zhu for guidance.</p><p>This was the first time he received instruction from a Nascent Soul ancestor.</p>
