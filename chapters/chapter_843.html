<h1>Chapter 835: The Beast Tide</h1><p>“Die!”</p><p>Revenge was at hand.</p><p>Madam Liu, tears in her eyes, cried out.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't relent, giving Xiang Yi no chance.</p><p>Trapped by the Restraining Yuan Talisman, Xiang Yi's true energy was sluggish, his magic weapon's power greatly diminished.  Facing the combined attack of Qin Sang and Madam Liu, he retreated steadily.</p><p>Despair filled his heart as he struggled desperately.</p><p>Xiang Yi was on the verge of defeat, escape impossible.  Then, unexpectedly, the Sky-Eye Butterfly gave warning.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Sky-Eye Butterfly to activate its Sky-Eye for surveillance, and it indeed detected something unusual.</p><p>Deep within the Demon Sea, waves surged, dark clouds blotted out the sun, rapidly approaching.</p><p>“Great Demon!”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.  How could a Great Demon appear at such a time?</p><p>The dark clouds were dense, the scale immense, and it was unknown how many demons lurked within.</p><p>No, perhaps it wasn't unexpected. His fight with Xiang Yi had caused a great disturbance, likely attracting the attention of the Great Demons.</p><p>The Demon Sea is truly dangerous now, as perilous as a dragon's lair.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>At the same time, Madam Liu and Xiang Yi also noticed the anomaly.</p><p>Madam Liu became anxious, urging Qin Sang to quickly kill Xiang Yi.</p><p>Xiang Yi, however, saw a glimmer of hope, and turned to charge into the approaching beast tide.</p><p>He was certain to die here; entering the tide offered a slim chance, at least dragging his enemy down with him.</p><p>Alas, with the appearance of a blue lightning bolt, all of Xiang Yi's plans turned to dust.</p><p>Qin Sang was forced to unleash the Star Conch, seeking a swift victory and immediate escape.</p><p>Xiang Yi's chest was pierced by the Star Conch, leaving a gaping hole.  His face was etched with disbelief as he looked down at the wound, the light fading from his eyes, then silence.</p><p>Madam Liu's long-held wish was fulfilled.  Seeing her enemy's demise, her body went limp, her spirit seemingly drained.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly moved to Xiang Yi's corpse, collecting his belongings before burning the body.</p><p>Unfortunately, that treasured robe, having been repeatedly struck by the double-headed… [translator's note: unclear original text], was completely destroyed.</p><p>“Madam Liu, let's go!”</p><p>Qin Sang urgently urged Madam Liu, who stood there lost in thought.</p><p>Looking back at the approaching beasts, Qin Sang mused that their appearance might not be entirely bad.</p><p>Any remaining traces would be destroyed by the beasts; others would assume Xiang Yi died at their hands, making it impossible to suspect them.</p><p>At Qin Sang's call, Madam Liu awoke from her trance.</p><p>“Thanks to the Daoist, this wicked villain is dead.”</p><p>Madam Liu whispered, grateful for her wise choice in making this alliance years ago.</p><p>Xiang Yi was incredibly powerful and cunning. Madam Liu suspected that even a fellow cultivator at the late Nascent Soul stage might have failed and allowed Xiang Yi to escape.</p><p>Even more alarming to Madam Liu was that, despite their lengthy struggle, Xiang Yi hadn't used his full strength.</p><p>She hadn't clearly seen the final, fatal blue light, but the chilling feeling remained vivid.</p><p>She must never offend this Daoist again, she vowed silently.</p><p>“Without Madam's carefully prepared Restraining Yuan Talisman, this wouldn't have gone so smoothly. I only hope Madam will keep today's events secret and not reveal my background…”</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>Madam Liu immediately swore an oath.</p><p>The two quickly fled.  Even far away, they found the beasts still in hot pursuit, the scale of the attack growing.</p><p>“Could this become a full-blown beast tide?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered uneasily, consulting with Madam Liu before deciding to return to Yu Heng Island for help.</p><p>With Xiang Yi dead and the aftermath handled cleanly, there was no need to rush their departure; they could move openly.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang and Madam Liu, when Qin Sang used the Star Conch to kill Xiang Yi, a large panther-like demon in the clouds seemed to sense something, its eyes gleaming with avarice.</p><p>Before landing on the island, Qin Sang, amidst his various tasks, examined Xiang Yi's belongings to avoid carrying anything incriminating.</p><p>Xiang Yi was wealthier than that young man from the Western You Alliance.  This haul would allow Qin Sang to live comfortably for some time.</p><p>Besides spirit stones and other items, there were rows of jade slips.  Qin Sang initially thought they were cultivation techniques, astounded by the sheer number—enough to found a sect.</p><p>A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed most contained records of the Commerce League's spiritual materials and their locations.</p><p>Qin Sang initially planned to destroy them, but on a whim, decided to examine them closely.</p><p>Examining the contents of these jade slips reveals the immense power of the Three Great Merchant Alliances.  The treasures within aren't all exceptionally valuable, but their sheer quantity is staggering.</p><p>Xiang Yi only possessed a fraction of these, from several nearby large islands.</p><p>Most spiritual items were sent to the well-fortified Da Huang Island, a sign of the Alliances’ preparedness.</p><p>Qin Sang even saw Soul-Guiding Grass, more than one plant, though it's no longer useful to him now.</p><p>He's searching for Azure Herb Root and Scorpion Venom Grass, hoping for a lucky break.</p><p>Only the Dongji Alliance and a few other major powers could amass so many spiritual items.</p><p>“Found it! There really is Hairy Mountain Vine!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes lit up.  He actually found Hairy Mountain Vine—the Azure Herb Root—in one of the slips, though only one stalk.</p><p>But the next piece of information disheartened him.  “This item has been sent to Da Huang Island!”</p><p>Xiang Yi was only responsible for transporting these items to Da Huang Island; he knew nothing of their subsequent destination. Whether the Hairy Mountain Vine remains there is unknown.</p><p>“I must return immediately, inquire about the Hairy Mountain Vine, and try to buy it. I wonder where Elder Zou is, and if he can help?”</p><p>While at the Qiongyu Trading Company, Qin Sang made several acquaintances; undoubtedly, Elder Zou is the most influential.</p><p>Madam Liu also has significant connections.  With Xiang Yi’s death, their previous relationship can be re-activated.</p><p>Upon learning Qin Sang's intentions, Madam Liu didn't hesitate and agreed to help.</p><p>The two flew towards Yu Heng Island without delay, pursued relentlessly by the monstrous beasts.</p><p>Fortunately, they didn't delay when killing Xiang Yi; otherwise, Qin Sang could have escaped, but Madam Liu might not have.</p><p>As Yu Heng Island came into view, the sky was overcast, the pursuing storm clouds rapidly approaching.</p><p>The island clearly detected the anomaly; a resonant bell tolled throughout, alerting all cultivators.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>Qin Sang and Madam Liu were stopped and questioned by the guards as soon as they appeared.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, these are my friends!”</p><p>Jin Ying had been waiting for news. Seeing their return, she rushed forward, displaying her identity.</p><p>While speaking, she anxiously glanced at Madam Liu.</p><p>Madam Liu smiled reassuringly.  Jin Ying visibly relaxed, suppressing her excitement, and led them onto the island.</p><p>Despite Jin Ying’s protection, they underwent a thorough search by the guards before being allowed entry.</p><p>Faced with the beast horde, Yu Heng Island seemed to come alive; the atmosphere had drastically shifted. All cultivators of the Nascent Soul stage and above were required to obey orders; no one could remain unaffected.</p><p>They had no time for conversation before being integrated into the island's defense force.</p>
