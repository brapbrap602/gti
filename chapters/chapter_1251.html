<h1>Chapter 1243: A Fair Fight</h1><p>Back on Cang Heng Island, Qing Jun brought Qin Sang there.  Unexpectedly, Qin Sang reached the late Gold Core stage. Dong Yang Bo considered killing him to eliminate future threats.</p><p>However, he hesitated because of two people.</p><p>First, Qing Jun. Dong Yang Bo knew Qing Jun was Qing Zhu's daughter, and Qin Sang practiced the same cultivation technique as Qing Zhu.  He suspected Qing Jun secretly protected Qin Sang all these years out of affection.</p><p>Second, Chen Yan. He couldn't fathom Chen Yan's true feelings for Qin Sang.</p><p>Chen Yan was desperate to save her master and would surely return.  Qin Sang's reappearance would inevitably cause a stir.</p><p>Dong Yang Bo could only act in secret, avoiding any leaks.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang was too cunning. After that appearance, he disappeared again, thwarting Dong Yang Bo's plans. Later, the Zui Yuan incident erupted, leaving him no time to deal with Qin Sang.</p><p>Ultimately, Dong Yang Bo didn't believe Qin Sang posed a real threat.  The young man had five innate spiritual roots, could only achieve Foundation Establishment through questionable means, and had failed to form a Gold Core despite consuming Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.</p><p>He wondered how Qing Jun helped him form a Gold Core; perhaps through similar means.</p><p>Could one casually achieve Nascent Soul?</p><p>In fact, Dong Yang Bo was partially right. Qin Sang only succeeded with the help of the Du E Dan and Di Hun Ye, two rare elixirs, along with the Ben Ming insect Gu and the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* secret techniques.</p><p>He never imagined that the pawn he once considered insignificant would not only achieve Nascent Soul but also surpass all expectations, becoming a powerful Demon King and making a name for himself.</p><p>Now, this person stood before him, a fair match!</p><p>Surprise flickered across Dong Yang Bo's face.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored him, his intentions clear. There was nothing left to say to Dong Yang Bo.</p><p>Without a word, he unleashed his sword techniques. The ebony sword blazed with light, shattering the Zuo Ying, then splitting into countless sword beams, instantly forming the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Seeing the array, a technique clearly related to a familiar one, Dong Yang Bo was startled.  His expression was one of disbelief. "Did I personally drive away two such geniuses?"</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Array led Dong Yang Bo to believe it was something Qin Sang learned from Qing Jun.  It was actually evidence of Qing Zhu’s success in creating her own Nascent Soul cultivation method.</p><p>Even if his assumption was wrong, it wasn't far off.</p><p>One could create their own cultivation technique; the other, despite having unusual roots, achieved Nascent Soul with five spiritual roots—a testament to exceptional talent.</p><p>Spiritual roots were only one aspect of talent.  With the dominance of orthodox cultivation and the decline of other paths, spiritual roots seemed far more significant.</p><p>Each of these individuals was exceedingly rare, capable of founding their own sect and elevating Shao Hua Mountain to new heights.  If he had kept either one, he wouldn't have worried about successors or schemed to seize Nascent Soul puppets.</p><p>Yet, he had driven them both away.</p><p>"Haha…"</p><p>Dong Yang Bo suddenly erupted in laughter, a complex sound filled with an uncertain mixture of emotions.</p><p>Regret?  Self-mockery?</p><p>However, he was a Nascent Soul ancestor. Despite his shock, his actions were swift.</p><p>Dong Yang Bo knew that his past actions meant reconciliation with Qin Sang was impossible. Qin Sang's hidden identity as a Demon King proved his resentment ran deep.</p><p>He didn't bother with polite requests for Qin Sang to return to the mountain and reconcile.</p><p>"Hehehe, I've long heard of the Mingyue Demon King's reputation, but never imagined it was you," Dong Yang Bo said, his tone ambiguous, his expression wistful.  "Truly, each generation produces its own exceptional talents! Your current achievements are remarkable; you're worthy of Chen Yan, perhaps even to the point where she'll become dependent on you someday. I underestimated you back then when I encouraged her to practice the *Stone Bridge Zen* technique.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved by the mention of Chen Yan, focusing solely on his attack.  Even with the hasty preparation, he would do his best to fight Dong Yang Bo.</p><p>Seeing that Chen Yan couldn't sway Qin Sang, Dong Yang Bo changed tactics, his mind racing.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang possessed not only an excellent spiritual sword but also other powerful techniques. A quick victory seemed unlikely, and he had no intention of prolonging the battle.</p><p>He needed to retrieve the puppet quickly to avoid further complications. Then he would carefully consider his next moves.</p><p>Qin Sang's Nascent Soul breakthrough and his exceptional strength had introduced too many variables, shattering his previous plans.</p><p>Dong Yang Bo made his decision. He looked around and found himself enveloped by the sword array, surrounded by the dimming light.</p><p>At that moment, countless sword threads from the array converged upon him.</p><p>The array's attack caused Dong Yang Bo's spiritual body to tremble, threatening to break his composure.  He realized this array possessed not only immense power but also the ability to assault the spiritual body.</p><p>Dong Yang Bo wouldn't allow the array to approach, immediately activating the King Kong Zhuo.</p><p>The Diamond Pestle hovered above his head, trembling slightly but ever ready to evade the Blood-Soiling Radiance.  Its power remained undiminished.  Waves of pestle-images surged outwards in all directions.</p><p>For a moment, the area around Dongyang Bo was brilliantly lit, revealing the sword threads of the formation, which were disrupted but not destroyed by the pestle images, still swirling and attempting to ensnare him.</p><p>Simultaneously, a soft light emanated from Dongyang Bo's palm, revealing a small bronze lamp.  Only three inches tall, it was exquisitely crafted, its top carved into the shape of a lotus flower; each petal a jade-like green.  The lamp held no oil, only a wick of unknown material.  With a mere infusion of Dongyang Bo's true energy, the wick ignited without flame.</p><p>The bronze lamp hovered before his brow, its tiny flame a dull yellow. Yet, upon its appearance, the sword threads faltered, and Dongyang Bo visibly relaxed.</p><p>Qin Sang, observing from outside the array, understood the lamp’s ability to counter the Seven Souls Killing Array.  He recognized Dongyang Bo as a veteran Yuan Ying cultivator and sect leader, possessing many powerful treasures; the earlier dispatch of Gongliang Yu was merely a prelude.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly.  The instant Dongyang Bo summoned the lamp, he focused his intent, and the Ebony Sword burst from the array, unleashing the Blood-Soiling Radiance without hesitation!</p><p>Dongyang Bo, having previously suffered from the Blood-Soiling Radiance, knew he couldn't risk further defilement of his Diamond Pestle.  His only option was to disable Qin Sang's treasure first.</p><p>Qin Sang's strategy worked.  Touched by the radiance, the bronze lamp’s power plummeted; its flame flickered wildly, then died.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Dongyang Bo, having lost his lamp, burst into laughter and spat out a beam of yellow light.  Within the light, a stone pillar, intricately carved with dragons and phoenixes, suddenly materialized.  It expanded rapidly, smashing towards the Ebony Sword with tremendous force.  This was a potent artifact, heavy as a mountain, its wind-like power overwhelming.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's timing was impeccable; the sudden emergence of the pillar from his mouth was impossible to anticipate.  The Ebony Sword’s light faltered, momentarily hindered by the immense pressure.</p><p>At that very moment, the Diamond Pestle finally found a weakness in the sword array.  Its aperture opened like a bursting dam, unleashing a torrent of light that slammed into a specific point in the array.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, regretting his relative lack of experience; a deeper understanding of the Seven Souls Killing Array would have prevented Dongyang Bo from finding that vulnerability so easily.</p><p>However, Dongyang Bo’s satisfaction was premature.  He had unknowingly played into Qin Sang’s hands.  The eighteen demonic banners were already secretly deployed.</p>
