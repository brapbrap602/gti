<h1>Chapter 846: Lan Dou Gate</h1><p>Urgent, traveling day and night.</p><p>Deep in the demon sea, we dare not be ostentatious. We must remain hidden at all times, carefully avoiding the notice of demonic beasts.  Everyone's expressions are tense.  After just a few days, they are exhausted and rest on the ground.</p><p>The journey is harrowing.</p><p>Islands once occupied by cultivators have become demon lairs, the cultivators themselves vanished without a trace.  The smaller islands they pass show clear signs of demonic beast raids—bloodbaths.</p><p>During their travels, Qin Sang seizes every moment to cultivate.</p><p>Half a month after their departure.</p><p>One evening, they spot a small island and land to rest and recover their true essence.</p><p>The four take turns standing guard; this time it's Zhu Shan Weng's turn.</p><p>Qin Sang finds a clear space to sit, setting up a simple restriction around himself.  As the sun's power wanes, he makes the most of the time to cultivate the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique.</p><p>The *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique uses stellar energy to refine the body. To outsiders, it appears to be a cultivation method that uses the celestial stars. Nobody suspects Qin Sang is practicing demonic arts.</p><p>With others nearby, he can't use the bone flute to cultivate, slowing his absorption of stellar energy. However, it remains a top-tier body refinement technique.</p><p>After entering the second level, the foundation he laid previously becomes less effective, and his progress slows.</p><p>From Old Man Zou, he learned that the next opening of the Seven Killing Hall will be in over forty years, making Qin Sang even more anxious.</p><p>As his understanding of this technique deepens, Qin Sang estimates that, with the *Yuanshen Yang Jian Zhang* stalled, if he cultivates *Tian Yao Lian Xing* to the mid-third level and activates the Tian Yao Transformation, he will possess the terrifying strength of a peak Nascent Soul stage cultivator, enough to contend with one of the swordsmen from the Sword Path!</p><p>Even in the second level of *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, Qin Sang has a premonition that his physical strength and true essence can complement each other, the benefits of dual cultivation surpassing expectations.</p><p>Qin Sang can't help but think: Could this be the right path?</p><p>If he also had a top-tier technique to strengthen his primordial spirit and cultivate his spiritual sense, cultivating all three together—how terrifying his strength would be! He could easily crush cultivators of the same level.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is merely wishful thinking.</p><p>Not to mention such top-tier techniques have long been lost to the passage of time, he himself has luckily obtained two, both incomplete. Even if such a technique existed, cultivating three top-tier techniques simultaneously is impossible in the resource-poor current cultivation world.</p><p>The result of distraction is regret at the end of one's lifespan.</p><p>If it weren't for the bottleneck in *Yuanshen Yang Jian Zhang*, Qin Sang wouldn't have focused on *Tian Yao Lian Xing* before reaching the Core Formation stage.</p><p>There's hope for the Mao Shan Vine, only the Scorpion Venom Herb is missing.</p><p>As long as he breaks through in time, there is a good chance of reaching the mid-third level before the Seven Killing Hall opens.</p><p>Qin Sang estimates the Seven Killing Hall might open several times before the next natural opening, but he dares not slacken or delay.</p><p>The world is unpredictable, chaos abounds in the Cang Lang Sea, accidents are inevitable. He must seize the present moment.</p><p>He looks up at the stars, his eyelids droop, and he enters deep meditation.</p><p>Around him, a layer of clear light emanates, drawing in the surrounding starlight and gathering it around him.</p><p>The Milky Way flows, the moon moves west.</p><p>At dawn, Qin Sang senses the restriction being touched and awakens from meditation.  He glances at the time; it's not yet time to depart. He sees Zhu Shan Weng standing outside the restriction.</p><p>"Daoist Zhu Shan, is something the matter?"</p><p>Qin Sang removes the restriction and invites him in.</p><p>Zhu Shan Weng nods, smiles, and enters, his gaze sweeping around.</p><p>The starlight hasn't completely dissipated.</p><p>Zhu Shan Weng's face shows curiosity. He says, "While on guard, I sensed the island's stellar energy converging towards Daoist Master. I was curious and dared to disturb you. Please don't mind.  Could it be that the Daoist Master cultivates a rare celestial-star technique, perhaps connected to the Lan Dou Gate?"</p><p>"Lan Dou Gate?"</p><p>Qin Sang is startled, recalling that the Lan Dou Gate is a fairly powerful sect in the inner sea.  Its mountain gate is located in a sea area northwest of Tian Xing Island, not too far away. Qin Sang has heard of it several times.</p><p>"I do indeed cultivate such a technique, but I have never had any dealings with the Lan Dou Gate. I wonder why Daoist Zhu Shan asks?"</p><p>"Then I must have been mistaken."</p><p>Zhu Shan Weng points to the rapidly dissipating stellar energy, explaining, "In the cultivation world, those who cultivate the power of the stars are rare.  It is said that there are differences between these techniques.  If I'm not wrong, Daoist Master draws stellar energy directly into the body. This method is extremely dangerous, easily harming one's foundation. It's quite uncommon."</p><p>This reminds me of an acquaintance of my master.  When I was a nobody, just starting my cultivation journey, this senior was already a high-level cultivator at the Core Formation stage, an elder of the Lan Dou Sect. I served him tea when he visited my master; I only met him once. His cultivation displayed a similar phenomenon to yours, friend. Seeing this, I felt a sense of familiarity and wondered if you were his descendant.”</p><p>“It must be a coincidence. I’ve never encountered any cultivators from the Lan Dou Sect before, and I obtained this cultivation technique by chance.  As far as I know, among the three most famous core techniques of the Lan Dou Sect, there are two Five Elements techniques, divided between wood and earth elements, and one extremely difficult Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Art. There's nothing similar to this technique.  Friend Zhushan, do you remember that senior's name?”</p><p>Qin Sang was searching for a place to perform the Star Yuan body-infusion, thus inquiring everywhere for information.  Gathering information on the core techniques of famous sects, he found no renowned Heavenly Cycle Star technique.</p><p>Instead, he was close to completing the collection of three spirit herbs; he was quite hopeful.</p><p>“I only remember that senior's Daoist name was Qi Yunzi. I haven't heard of him since.”</p><p>Old Man Zhushan shook his head regretfully. “The Lan Dou Sect has stood in the Inner Sea for many years. Besides their three core techniques, it’s not surprising that they also possess other techniques. However, achieving significant results without cultivating the core techniques is extremely difficult.  Senior Qi Yunzi probably didn't achieve much later in life and faded into obscurity.”</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, chatted with Old Man Zhushan for a while, and Yue Xian and Kong Yun also awoke. They decided to set off early.</p><p>On their journey, Qin Sang pondered Old Man Zhushan's words.</p><p>The Daoist name and origin were clearly stated; Old Man Zhushan wasn't making it up to ingratiate himself. There was no conflict of interest between the four of them, and he had no reason to lie.</p><p>So, could the Lan Dou Sect possibly possess a technique similar to the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*?</p><p>It certainly couldn’t be the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*; it was only through a stroke of luck, across an unknown distance of tens of thousands of miles, that he managed to gather the three bone flutes to obtain this technique.</p><p>However, talented individuals have always appeared throughout human history, and it’s not strange that techniques similar to the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* would be created.</p><p>Old Man Zhushan was right. Even if they both use the Heavenly Cycle Star power for cultivation, the differences are significant; the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* is the most brutal and dangerous method.</p><p>The breakthrough is even more terrifying, forcibly drawing Star Yuan to break through cultivation barriers during body infusion.</p><p>If Qi Yunzi cultivated such a technique to achieve Core Formation, would he have had similar requirements during his breakthrough?</p>
