<h1>Chapter 855: The External Avatar</h1><p>Chapter 855: The External Avatar</p><p>During his seclusion on Tianxing Island, he befriended several fellow cultivators.  The numerous message talismans were mostly left by them. Qin Sang casually picked up two.</p><p>One invited him to a small gathering with a few friends to discuss Daoist principles.</p><p>Another informed him of a senior cultivator giving a lecture elsewhere and invited him to attend.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to check on his external avatar, so he left the talismans and quickly entered his cave abode.</p><p>Inside the cave abode,</p><p>Moonstones provided faint illumination.</p><p>His external avatar sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, unaware of Qin Sang's arrival due to the isolating barrier.</p><p>His breath was steady, his posture unwavering.</p><p>This was a good sign, indicating that no accidents had occurred while Qin Sang was away.</p><p>He deactivated the barrier and entered. The external avatar remained motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang sat opposite his external avatar, examining its condition. He discovered that the demonic seed had 'consumed,' or perhaps merged with, the physical body, reaching the critical stage of fetal gestation.</p><p>He hadn't expected to be gone so long, nearly jeopardizing the entire operation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. After a moment's reflection, he rose, sealed the cave, and then took out spirit stones, setting up a spirit gathering array.</p><p>Resuming his seat, Qin Sang activated his divine sense, connecting with the external avatar's consciousness, preparing for the blood feeding ritual.</p><p>The spiritual energy on Baogu Mountain was already exceptionally rich. With the added support of the spirit gathering array, the cave's spiritual energy was sufficient for Qin Sang to complete the secret technique.</p><p>It took an entire night.  Once he was certain everything was flawless, Qin Sang squeezed a drop of his essence blood.</p><p>The blood droplet hovered between them. Qin Sang's face was grim as he rapidly changed hand seals. The cave's spiritual energy surged, and numerous runes spontaneously generated, swiftly settling onto the blood droplet.</p><p>The blood droplet absorbed the runes, glowing intensely red.</p><p>This single drop of blood had to bear hundreds of runes, a significant test of Qin Sang's control. Fortunately, his cultivation base was high enough, and everything proceeded smoothly.</p><p>The final rune entered the blood droplet.</p><p>With a 'pop,' the blood droplet burst like a blood bubble.  A blood essence, neither dissipating nor dispersing, condensed into a humanoid blood shadow.</p><p>The shadow was only finger-sized, its features strikingly similar to Qin Sang's, yet its brows held an intensely sinister aura.</p><p>Its face bore a ghastly smile, chilling anyone who caught sight of it.</p><p>"As expected of a demonic, heretical technique, truly wicked,"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>From the beginning of the secret technique, the seeds of backlash were sown.</p><p>Even with his current cultivation, he already felt the intention of the backlash, though extremely faint and negligible.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang's low command rang out. He pointed a finger at the external avatar. The blood shadow's sinister smile intensified, eagerly lunging towards the external avatar and entering through its forehead.</p><p>The external avatar trembled slightly then stilled.</p><p>Qin Sang then activated his divine sense, following the blood shadow into the Purple Mansion.  He saw a black cocoon, within which lay the dormant sword-soul demonic seed, on the verge of breaking free.</p><p>The blood shadow merged into the cocoon and vanished.  However, Qin Sang didn't stop. He continuously extracted more drops of blood, refining them into blood shadows. Some entered the Purple Mansion, others into the external avatar's body.</p><p>Having finished, Qin Sang slowly exhaled, his face slightly pale. Checking the external avatar's state, he found the secret technique had been successfully completed.</p><p>A faint connection seemed to exist between him and the external avatar.</p><p>The sword-soul demonic seed was exceptionally stable. At this rate, a few more blood feedings would suffice to successfully refine the external avatar.</p><p>After consuming so much essence blood, he hastily swallowed several spirit pills.</p><p>The ninth day arrived.</p><p>He repeated the secret technique every day, using his essence blood to nurture the fetus.  This was the ninth and final time.</p><p>'Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!'</p><p>Blood shadows materialized at Qin Sang's fingertips, then surged towards the external avatar, leaving bloody streaks on its body.  The most obvious change was the cocoon in the Purple Mansion, now dyed blood-red.</p><p>When the final blood shadow entered, the cocoon abruptly split open, and the sword-soul demonic seed leaped out. Simultaneously, the external avatar abruptly opened its eyes.</p><p>Its eyes were bloodshot, the pupils resembling pools of blood. A hint of a sinister smile played on its lips.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.  He unleashed a thunderous roar, activating the secret technique from the "Cultivating the Demonic Fetus" manual, erasing the external avatar's improper thoughts and bringing it under control.</p><p>The external avatar stiffened as if struck by lightning. The bloodshot eyes gradually returned to normal, and its expression regained composure.</p><p>The two, vastly different in appearance, possessed remarkably similar auras.</p><p>However, the subtle connection between Qin Sang and his now refined external avatar became more obscure.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang's external avatar appears simultaneously with himself, or the opponent's cultivation far surpasses his, it's impossible to see through the avatar's true nature at a glance.  Furthermore, the external avatar possesses its own consciousness and can act independently. Even when out of Qin Sang's sight, it behaves like a normal person.</p><p>Finally completing the refinement of his external avatar, a smile graced Qin Sang's face as he checked its condition.  The avatar's original cultivation level was only at the Qi Condensation stage, and its post-refinement level wouldn't be higher.  Qin Sang needs to continuously feed it blood and use secret techniques to rapidly increase its strength.</p><p>Of course, the "Seed Yuan Demon Fetus" also records another method: devouring other cultivators. The higher the cultivator's level, the faster the avatar's improvement. However, the consequences are obvious: the avatar becomes more prone to turning against its creator, potentially creating a demonic entity that backfires.</p><p>After the "Soul-Nourishing Sword Chapter" stalled, Qin Sang had to control a peak Foundation Establishment external avatar with his mid-Foundation Establishment cultivation. To be safe, he decided to feed it with refined blood and gradually improve its strength.</p><p>Unfortunately, the external avatar hasn't cultivated a second Nascent Soul and can't be stored in a corpse puppet bag like a corpse puppet.  It must remain outside at all times.  To prevent accidents, until it has sufficient self-preservation abilities, he keeps it in his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang forced out a few drops of refined blood, completed the blood-feeding, and then ordered the external avatar to cultivate in solitude. He also sat cross-legged, entering a state of forgetfulness, and after a night of meditation, finally washed away his fatigue.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Sang glanced at the external avatar, then strolled out of his cave dwelling. He was pondering matters related to the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect possesses a cultivation technique based on the Zhou Tian stars.  It once produced Foundation Establishment cultivators, but now it's unknown whether the technique is flawed, unpracticed, or if something else happened. To find out, he'd likely have to go near the Lan Dou Sect's mountain gate and try to contact core disciples or high-level cultivators.</p><p>Getting to the Lan Dou Sect from Tian Xing Island isn't far. At his speed, it would take less than a month.</p><p>"Before I go, I should ask Master Yi about Scorpion Venom Grass.  My main priority is still finding spiritual herbs. Oh, right…"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a transmission talisman outside and drew it in.  Most messages on the talismans were outdated, but one caught his attention – a message from a shopkeeper, the one who had helped him trade for high-grade spirit stones last time.</p>
