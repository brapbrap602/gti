<h1>Chapter 1797: Mole Cricket Mountain</h1><p>Having informed Qin Sang of the method of contact, Mo Xingdao continued, "Hongyuzi suffered grave injuries this time. Medicinal pills can only temporarily alleviate his condition. He needs to return to the Celestial Court to recuperate for a period and likely won't return here soon.  I cannot act alone. After he recovers, I will send a message to Fellow Daoist before taking action.  May I ask where Fellow Daoist Qin is residing?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then said, "Send the message to Gourd City. I will make the necessary arrangements."</p><p>The two agreed on a specific talismanic seal as a secret sign.</p><p>If Mo Xingdao and Hongyuzi returned to this place in the future and ventured into the depths of the Ritual Altar, Qin Sang would follow behind, while Mo Xingdao would secretly leave guidance.  The two would then seize the opportunity to act.</p><p>This was only a rough plan.</p><p>After all, Mo Xingdao was controlled by Hongyuzi and had no freedom. There was little he could do.</p><p>Times change and circumstances shift. No one could predict how the situation would unfold.  The two could only ensure continuous contact and act according to the circumstances.</p><p>When the time came, whether Qin Sang agreed or not would depend on his own situation.</p><p>Hidden currents flowed between the Ghostfang Kingdom and the Celestial Court, perhaps offering opportunities to exploit.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then asked, "Did you discover anything during your venture into the Ritual Altar this time?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao had mentioned earlier that he and Hongyuzi entered the Ritual Altar of Mount Ju this time for two purposes: one was to investigate the Ghostfang Kingdom's demonic plot, and the other was to delve into the Ritual Altar and search for locations that matched Mo Xingdao's memories.</p><p>"No."</p><p>Mo Xingdao replied, "The deeper we go, the more complex and dangerous it becomes. Hongyuzi alone would be fine, but he needs to constantly protect me. My old injuries haven't fully healed, and even without this incident, it would have been extremely strenuous."</p><p>Pausing, Mo Xingdao continued, "I will now share some scenes from my memory with you. Fellow Daoist, if you have time, you might as well search for them and take the initiative."</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.  Wasn't Mo Xingdao afraid that he would find the way out and ascend alone?</p><p>But on second thought, even if there was a way out in the depths of the Ritual Altar, it would surely connect to the Returning Ruin, and it might not directly lead back to the path of ascension.  Falling into the chaotic depths of the Returning Ruin would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>He had never entered the Returning Ruin.  Joining forces with Mo Xingdao was the wisest choice.</p><p>Little did he know, Mo Xingdao also had no other recourse.</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Golden Palace Censor and the Celestial Court behind him were like an insurmountable mountain, making Mo Xingdao不敢造次 (not dare to act rashly).</p><p>Qin Sang was the only external force he could rely on.</p><p>During his time in the Storm Realm, he had interacted with Qin Sang several times and had heard the evaluations of Qin Sang from Venerable Huiguang and others. He had a certain understanding of Qin Sang's character. Mo Xingdao had witnessed the entire process of Qin Sang, with his late Nascent Soul cultivation, contending with two Soul Formation cultivators, and he admired him greatly.</p><p>Then, Mo Xingdao replayed some memory fragments.</p><p>Scenes flashed through Qin Sang's mind, most of them chaotic. Seeing these, Qin Sang's own memories were stirred.</p><p>He recalled his experience falling into the spatial turbulence, and a sense of helplessness and despair arose spontaneously.</p><p>Even the clearest memory fragments were extremely blurry, but Qin Sang could sense something unusual within these scenes. They resembled the various illusory scenes created by the divine powers within the Ritual Altar. No wonder Hongyuzi suspected this place.</p><p>"And our experiences this time," Mo Xingdao continued, transmitting more information before Qin Sang could respond.</p><p>He and Hongyuzi weren't simply exploring; they were searching for the path of ascension. Every certain distance, they would first find a place to rest and establish a relatively safe path.</p><p>Before coming, Hongyuzi had made some preparations. Initially, their speed was very fast, but it gradually slowed down.</p><p>In the deepest parts, auspicious clouds were almost nonexistent.  Various illusory scenes and remnants of divine powers filled every space, leaving no gaps. They could only rely on their own strength to force their way through.</p><p>"Hongyuzi finally entered a realm of pure white light.  Initially, there was no danger.  The eruption of golden light triggered a tide of light. Shortly after the light tide appeared, Hongyuzi was gravely injured and returned. I escaped the calamity because I was lagging behind," Mo Xingdao recounted the scene, still feeling a lingering fear.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, taking note of this place.</p><p>He didn't necessarily have to retrace Hongyuzi's path. It was originally an aimless search. As long as he could continue to delve deeper, it was the same from other directions, choosing according to his own abilities.</p><p>For example, he could easily pass through illusory scenes that attacked the Nascent Soul or affected the divine soul.</p><p>Mo Xingdao wanted to say more, but his tone suddenly changed, and he said gravely, "Hongyuzi has awakened! Fellow Daoist Qin, until we meet again!"</p><p>With that, the facial features on the stone vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang reached out and grabbed the stone. The moment it landed in his hand, the stone's shape drastically changed, becoming a cold stone figure.</p><p>This was Mo Xingdao's token.</p><p>Qin Sang stored it in his Thousand Jun Ring and then felt a divine sense sweep over him. He remained composed, rising and flying back to the stone pavilion.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stood respectfully in a corner of the pavilion.  Their gazes met briefly, then separated, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Hongyuzi refined the spiritual pill.  His aura stabilized, and his injuries were almost imperceptible, only his complexion remaining faintly pale.</p><p>Then, Realmaster Zhijian and the others arrived one after another.</p><p>Hongyuzi glanced at everyone, flicked his wrist, and shot a talisman towards Qin Sang.  "This humble Daoist and Realmaster Wan have set up a talismanic formation here. We request Realmaster Qingfeng to take charge of this talisman and assist our fellow Daoists."</p><p>"I shall certainly obey!"</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands in respect, accepted the talisman, and offered a word of caution to the realmasters beside him.</p><p>The expressions of the others were grave, but Realmaster Zhijian smiled majestically, simply saying there was no need to worry.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that Realmaster Zhijian's true strength was definitely not what it appeared to be on the surface.  That sword strike, comparable to the Void Refinement stage, was proof enough.</p><p>It was a pity that this time they were forced to separate, and he couldn't witness the splendor of superior swordsmanship firsthand.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…*</p><p>The realmasters transformed into streaks of light and vanished in an instant.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped into the stone pavilion, sat down cross-legged, and placed the talisman on his knee.  Sensing it slightly, he discovered the presence of the formation.</p><p>This formation was attached to the gray curtain and was extremely ingenious.  It was difficult to detect before activation.</p><p>Through the formation, Qin Sang could perceive the situation outside the gray curtain and detect anyone pursuing them in advance.</p><p>After the others left, the stone pavilion fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on the encounters of this journey, becoming curious about the source of the golden light and the demons' plot. But he quickly cautioned himself not to delve too deeply, best not to be caught up in the great battle.</p><p>He dismissed these distracting thoughts and focused on smoothing out the lingering effects of the Wood Spiritual Qi within his body, while also paying attention to the depths of the Ritual Altar.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>More than half an hour quickly went by.</p><p>The golden light had subsided, and the turmoil affecting the entire Ritual Altar was gradually calming down. The surroundings became even quieter.</p><p>There were no unusual phenomena in the depths of the Ritual Altar for a long time, nor did the realmasters return.</p><p>Qin Sang had nothing to do, his thoughts swirling. Events, one after another, flashed through his mind.</p><p>Encountering Mo Xingdao had disrupted his previous plans. He needed to find a new direction and carefully sort things out, pursuing cultivation and searching for the path of ascension simultaneously.</p><p>While pondering, amidst the illusory gaps in front of the gray curtain, on a slender path formed by auspicious clouds, a light suddenly flickered.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned slightly serious. Upon closer inspection, he confirmed it was a streak of escaping light, flying towards him. Moreover, the aura was weak, and the escaping speed wasn't fast, equivalent to only the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Currently, the cultivators in the Ritual Altar of Mount Ju were at least at the Soul Formation stage.</p><p>"Could someone be seriously injured?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>Someone returning with severe injuries so quickly?  Could the demons have gained the upper hand?</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood up, his expression changing.  But as the escaping light gradually approached, Qin Sang suddenly noticed something was amiss.</p><p>"How could it be him?"</p><p>Seeing the person clearly, Qin Sang was taken aback, utterly surprised.</p><p>The newcomer was a tall and thin Daoist priest with a familiar face. It was actually Realmaster Yunwei of Mole Cricket Mountain!</p><p>Years ago, when receiving the decree to gather the Dream Weaver Four Seasons Flowers, Qin Sang had competed with him for qualification.</p><p>Realmaster Yunwei was carrying a female Daoist priest in his arms. The female Daoist's face was ashen, her breath faint, motionless in his embrace, clearly gravely injured.</p><p>While flying, Realmaster Yunwei constantly checked the female Daoist's condition, his face filled with anxiety.</p><p>"Why is he here?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled.</p><p>Judging by Realmaster Yunwei's cultivation, he was still at the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators, with enough courage and preparation, could also traverse the Nine-Bend Star River and explore the outermost areas, broadening their horizons.</p><p>But to venture deeper, even Soul Formation cultivators had to be extremely cautious.</p><p>Realmaster Yunwei came from the depths of the Ritual Altar.  For a mere Nascent Soul cultivator to go so deep, his courage was truly extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully examined the female Daoist priest and discovered she was also a Nascent Soul cultivator, finding the situation increasingly bizarre.</p><p>He stood in the pavilion, watching Yunwei and the female Daoist, making no move.</p><p>"Please, Senior, open the formation!"</p><p>Arriving before the gray curtain, hope flickered in Yunwei's eyes as he called out loudly and sent a talisman flying.</p><p>Seeing the talisman, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then opened the formation.</p><p>This was the secret sign he had agreed upon with Hongyuzi.  Yunwei knowing this talisman indicated he was directed here by Hongyuzi.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Overjoyed, Yunwei carried the female Daoist priest without pause through layers of gray curtains, arriving before the pavilion.  His face still filled with urgency, he bowed deeply, "Please, Senior, save my Junior Sister!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the female Daoist priest and said indifferently, "Who sent you here?"</p><p>"It was Seniors Hongyuzi and Realmaster Wan.  My master and I encountered several seniors on our way.  My master was invited by the two seniors to deal with demons.  He departed hastily and could only temporarily suppress my Junior Sister's injuries, but they are worsening.  Realmaster Wan directed this junior to come here, hoping Senior would lend a hand…"</p><p>Yunwei spoke rapidly. It was no wonder he was anxious.  The female Daoist's aura was growing weaker and weaker, and an unnatural flush was spreading across her face.</p><p>So the Soul Formation ancestor of Mole Cricket Mountain had arrived.  He wondered why he would risk bringing his disciple into this place.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the conversation between the Roaming Envoy and Yunwei.</p><p>Could the Mole Cricket Mountain ancestor have discovered some treasure in the Ritual Altar of Mount Ju, prompting him to take such a risk?</p><p>"Senior only needs to suppress the strange force within my Junior Sister.  Once my master returns, he will heal her injuries."</p><p>Yunwei spoke repeatedly, fearing Qin Sang would refuse.</p><p>Suppressing the strange force wouldn't consume much true essence, but that force was very peculiar, having dispersed into his Junior Sister's internal organs.  It would take time, sealing it bit by bit, to completely suppress it.</p><p>The matters of the Celestial Court were urgent. The Mole Cricket Mountain ancestor didn't want to displease the two Rank Four Celestial Officials, so he had agreed and ordered Yunwei to quickly bring the female Daoist here.</p><p>Mole Cricket Mountain specialized in poison techniques and talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang had long had the intention of contacting Mole Cricket Mountain.  He didn't expect to encounter them here.</p><p>Even if it wasn't Realmaster Wan's request, he would still save her.</p><p>Instructing Yunwei to place the female Daoist priest on the ground, Qin Sang pressed his fingers together and pointed them at her brow, carefully examining her condition.</p><p>Yunwei's anxious heart finally settled.  He then noticed Qin Sang and, the more he looked, the more familiar he seemed, surprise flickering in his eyes.</p><p>When he heard the title "Realmaster Qingfeng" from Realmaster Wan, Yunwei hadn't given it much thought. He never expected it to be him!</p><p>They had once fought in the arena.</p><p>Reunited today, the other party had already taken that step, while he was still struggling at the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Realmaster Yunwei's expression was complex.  Seeing Qin Sang open his eyes and reveal a look of concern, he asked, "Senior, my Junior Sister, she…"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yunwei, you and I could be considered to have become acquainted through combat.  After so many years, do you not recognize this humble Daoist?" Qin Sang smiled faintly.</p><p>Yunwei's lips trembled, and he forced a smile. "Senior is no longer one of us. How could I be so disrespectful?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, not insisting further, and lowered his gaze to examine the female Daoist priest.  "Suppressing the strange force shouldn't be difficult, but I wonder how this force came about?"</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Yunwei was initially delighted, then hesitated.</p><p>Seeing his difficulty, Qin Sang rephrased his question, "Dare I ask, is this strange force a type of poison?"</p><p>He had probed the female Daoist's body and, upon contacting the strange force, immediately made a discovery.  He sensed the force was like poison, yet not quite poison, rather peculiar.</p><p>"This junior's knowledge is limited, and I cannot determine if it is poison, but it is definitely related to poison.  This strange force appeared suddenly during the eruption of golden light.  There were no signs beforehand.  My Junior Sister couldn't dodge it…"</p><p>As he spoke, Yunwei's eyes brightened.  He just remembered that Qin Sang was also an expert in poison techniques, completely unaffected by their sect's inherited Dissipating Impurity Curse.</p><p>"Senior, can you remove the strange force?"  Yunwei pleaded anxiously with a glimmer of hope, fearing he might anger Qin Sang.</p><p>Before breaking through, Qin Sang could easily resist the Dissipating Impurity Curse.  Now, with his increased cultivation, his poison skills must have improved further.</p><p>The strange force lingering within the body for a long time might leave unknown hidden dangers.  The sooner it was removed, the better.</p><p>"Let me try."</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently, his fingertips emitting a strange light that seeped into the female Daoist's body.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang activated the Poison Bead, subtly infiltrating it.  Upon contacting the strange force, he indeed successfully absorbed a trace of it.</p><p>The strange force within the female Daoist's body wasn't abundant, but it was very bizarre, deeply rooted, and unheard of, even the Mole Cricket Mountain ancestor found it tricky.</p><p>However, Qin Sang discovered that removing all the strange force with the Poison Bead wasn't difficult, but he didn't want to appear too effortless, feigning a contemplative appearance.</p><p>After a while.</p><p>Seeing his Junior Sister's complexion begin to improve, Yunwei was overjoyed and even more impressed with Qin Sang.</p><p>With the crisis resolved, Yunwei's tense mind finally relaxed, and he finally had the mood to think about other things.  Seemingly remembering something, a hint of joy flashed in his eyes.</p><p>A long time later, Qin Sang removed all the strange force and slowly withdrew his technique.</p><p>The female Daoist's complexion was rosy, though her aura was still weak, a result of her recent recovery from severe injuries and depletion.  There was no major problem.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for saving my Junior Sister's life.  All of Mole Cricket Mountain is eternally grateful to you."</p><p>Yunwei bowed deeply, praising profusely, "Senior's poison skills far surpass what they were back then, rarely matched in this world!"</p><p>"You flatter me.  This humble Daoist is only slightly versed in detoxification techniques. I have long admired your master, having heard that Mole Cricket Mountain's poison curse techniques are unparalleled in the world."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was calm.</p><p>"Knowing a fellow Daoist like Senior exists, my master will surely be overjoyed as well,"  Yunwei spared no words of praise.</p><p>His gaze flickered, wanting to speak yet hesitating.  In the end, he swallowed the words he was about to say.</p><p>With his master present, he couldn't make the decision.  He could only wait for his master's return before deciding.</p>
