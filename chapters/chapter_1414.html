<h1>Chapter 1406: Improved Soul-Bound Insect Gu</h1><p>Chapter 1406: Improved Soul-Bound Insect Gu</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly glimpsed a scene, a fleeting view.</p><p>It gave Qin Sang a very dangerous feeling.</p><p>He couldn’t explain it to Valley Master Mu and the others, only offering ambiguous warnings.</p><p>If they didn’t listen, Qin Sang wouldn’t force them.</p><p>At least, he himself would wait for the pillar of light to weaken before entering.</p><p>Fortunately, Valley Master Mu and the other three were shrewd and experienced; their intuition told them something was amiss, so Qin Sang didn’t need to elaborate.</p><p>“But how long will we have to wait…”</p><p>The Qi cultivator showed concern, looking around.</p><p>The Kongling Sea was no longer its usual calm self.</p><p>The aftershocks from the pillar of light created a violent storm, affecting the entire Kongling Sea.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, towering waves were everywhere.</p><p>Ahead of them, the seawater had caved in, revealing a huge crater, exposing the source of the light pillar and the damaged Buddha lotus.</p><p>Besides the four of them, no other figures or ships were visible for the time being.</p><p>But they all knew this was temporary.</p><p>Such a spectacle was impossible to conceal. Low-level cultivators were of little concern, but if any Nascent Soul cultivators were nearby, they would certainly be drawn here.</p><p>“Let’s wait and see. Everyone should recover their strength first to prepare for the upcoming changes. If we delay too long, it might turn into a treasure-grabbing battle…”</p><p>Valley Master Mu recalled the time and effort spent breaking the formation, and couldn't help but wryly smile.</p><p>Not to mention other things.</p><p>For this, his highly valued Jade-衔玉蜂 (replace with appropriate translation based on context, e.g., "衔玉蜂" could be translated as "Jade-biting Bee" or a more descriptive name) had self-destructed. He had twice deployed the Three Spirit Disk King Formation, refining two altars – a huge expenditure.</p><p>He had also made a deal with Qin Sang.</p><p>He only hoped the upcoming rewards would compensate for the losses.</p><p>With the Buddha lotus broken, the Three Spirit Disk King Formation shouldn't be needed anymore. Entering the Jinghai Sect, with the Fire Jade Centipede's own cultivation, it should be able to sense the Myriad Spirit Fruit.</p><p>Valley Master Mu stopped the insect formation.</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned, and the Fire Jade Centipede flew back into his palm.</p><p>Its originally fiery jade-like body had become extremely dull, losing its luster.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede lay limp in Qin Sang's hand, its legs motionless, its body stiff, its breath weak.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn’t been able to sense the Fire Jade Centipede's consciousness, he would have thought it had turned into a statue.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade bottle.</p><p>It contained the spirit dew given by Valley Master Mu, which could alleviate the injuries of spirit insects.</p><p>After entering the Jinghai Sect, the Fire Jade Centipede would still be needed to lead the way, so any recovery would be helpful.</p><p>The spirit dew dripped in front of the Fire Jade Centipede, which immediately lapped it up. It slightly revived, its body moving slightly, before falling into a deep sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, then withdrew his hand into his robe.</p><p>“Daoist Mu?”</p><p>Qin Sang reminded Valley Master Mu that their previous agreement should be fulfilled.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede had done its job, the entrance had been found, and although they couldn't enter now, it wasn't Qin Sang's fault.</p><p>Valley Master Mu sighed lightly, somewhat reluctantly throwing a jade slip to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang thanked him and quickly probed his consciousness into it.</p><p>Valley Master Mu naturally wouldn't give him the entire inheritance; the jade slip only contained the Hundred Flowers Valley's soul-bound insect Gu technique.</p><p>Qin Sang had expected this, but seeing it still made him exclaim.  Truly of the same origin.</p><p>He hadn’t been wrong; the Hundred Flowers Valley's soul-bound insect Gu technique was a modified version of the Wu tribe's inheritance, a refined secret technique suitable for human cultivation, and the method of modification was extremely ingenious, opening Qin Sang’s eyes.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang cultivated the original version of the soul-bound insect Gu technique, he couldn't achieve this.</p><p>This made Qin Sang wonder if there were truly prodigies in the world who could obtain an unprecedented secret technique and devise such a method out of thin air?</p><p>However, this modification was not without flaws.</p><p>First, disciples who cultivate the soul-bound insect Gu must possess a Water element spiritual root and must bind a spirit insect compatible with Water element power as their soul-bound insect Gu to minimize the risk of being devoured by the insect.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Valley Master Mu. No wonder the spirit insects of the Hundred Flowers Valley disciples were all of this type, including Valley Master Mu himself.</p><p>Second, even after modification, the spirit insect's bond with its master is not as close as that of the Wu tribe's soul-bound insect Gu.</p><p>The jade slip only contained content below the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't insist; these were enough for him to see many things.</p><p>Modifying secret techniques becomes more difficult the higher one’s cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance was limited, possibly only reaching the late or even mid-Nascent Soul stage.  He wondered if Valley Master Mu's desperate attempt to break into the Jinghai Sect was to search for the subsequent cultivation methods.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized a problem.</p><p>The Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance was inferior to the original version.</p><p>Their relationship with their soul-bound insect Gu was not as close as his with the Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>My chances of successfully raising my Sky Eye Butterfly should be higher than those of the Baihua Valley cultivators!</p><p>This unexpected discovery pleased Qin Sang greatly. If I can find the Wanling Fruit later, my chances of success will be even greater!  Unfortunately, the Fire Jade Centipede isn't my natal insect, so whether it can break through to the fourth transformation will depend entirely on its luck.</p><p>As for the Fat Silkworm...</p><p>Qin Sang had been hesitating whether to use the Ascending Spirit Ritual on it.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm isn't his spirit insect; the probability of success is pitifully low.  Wasting the opportunity wouldn't be worthwhile.</p><p>Moreover, the Fat Silkworm's abilities are limited, but it can already easily withstand the intense poison released by the Transformation Stage frog-fish.  That's enough to handle most situations, so there's no need to force its advancement for now.</p><p>These thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang destroyed the jade slip in front of Master Mu, and sent a wry voice transmission: "No wonder you were so quick to agree; you're cultivating a natal insect, occupying the position of your natal treasure. Even if I obtained this secret technique, I wouldn't be able to cultivate it anymore."</p><p>Master Mu laughed heartily, "My sect's inheritance is unique and demands extremely high aptitude.  Even if you had the talent, you've already missed the opportunity to cultivate it. However, this was painstakingly created by our sect's ancestors; it should still provide you with some inspiration."</p><p>"You're right."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a perfunctory nod.</p><p>While the two were exchanging voice transmissions, the anomaly, instead of weakening, grew stronger.</p><p>It had expanded to at least double its previous size.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were forced to retreat further.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>Soon, a night passed.</p><p>By the next morning,</p><p>Qin Sang and his companions, tirelessly, monitored every change in the anomaly.</p><p>In the distance, a ship floated on the sea, with several figures standing on it.</p><p>Two of them were Golden Core cultivators.  Passing through the Kongling Sea, they saw the anomaly and, mistaking it for a precious treasure, happily rushed to find it.  Unexpectedly, they encountered four Nascent Soul masters, and trembled with fear.</p><p>Fortunately, the masters weren't vicious; they didn't kill them.</p><p>Shortly after, another cultivator's treasure ship appeared and was also detained, restrained on the sea's surface by a simple restriction. No one dared to object.</p><p>The Kongling Sea is a safe and important shipping route.</p><p>More and more people and ships were drawn in, all detained.</p><p>As for others elsewhere, Qin Sang and his companions could no longer handle them.</p><p>Another day and night passed.</p><p>The anomaly intensified.</p><p>Still, no Nascent Soul cultivator appeared.</p><p>Just as their anxiety reached fever pitch, the pillar of light finally stopped expanding, and its intensity began to wane!</p>
