Chapter 313: Heavenly Mandate Alliance


“Junior Brother Yu, your efforts are evident to me, but alas, fate is not always in our hands…”
Jade Sun remarked to Qin Sang with a detached tone.  Having met countless cultivators at Skull Fortress, he seemed unfazed. “Most cultivators, like Junior Brother Yu, including our sect's disciples, share a similar path. They either accept the limitations of their cultivation journey and return to the sect for a menial role, or return home to raise a family. Some even establish prosperous lineages, and many of the cultivation families affiliated with our sect were founded by such individuals. Others, unwilling to give up, frequent the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, searching for elusive opportunities, only to vanish one day. True success is exceedingly rare…”


Jade Sun gave a self-deprecating chuckle. “I've merely taken a few extra steps myself. What right do I have to judge them?  Forget it, let's not dwell on it…”


A solemn silence fell between them, extinguishing their previous enthusiasm. They continued in silence to meet Senior Brother Qi.


Another person was present in the room.


Surnamed Rong, he was also a senior brother from Mount Shaohua, whose cultivation had remarkably reached late Foundation Establishment, only slightly inferior to Senior Brother Qi.


This man had a square face, bronze skin, and a stern demeanor. When Qin Sang and Jade Sun greeted him, he returned the gesture with formal precision.


“You've arrived just in time. Junior Brother Rong has just arrived from the sect. From now on, he will be responsible for matters at Skull Fortress."


Qi Yuanshou introduced Qin Sang and Jade Sun to Junior Brother Rong, then informed them that he was returning to the sect and that they should consult Junior Brother Rong for any future matters.


Jade Sun, having just learned this news, was initially surprised, then his face lit up with sudden realization. "Senior Brother Qi, have you sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough? Junior Brother Qin just reached mid Foundation Establishment, and now Senior Brother Qi is about to reach Core Formation? This is a doubly joyous occasion!"


Qi Yuanshou chuckled. "Junior Brother Qin's breakthrough is indeed a joyous event. However, my return to the sect isn't for a breakthrough, but for other important matters."


Jade Sun inquired with a grave expression, "Senior Brother Qi, has something happened at the sect?"


The relationship between these disciples and Mount Shaohua was like that of branches and the main trunk.


Without the skin, where would the hair grow?


If something happened to Mount Shaohua, even if they could preserve their lives, losing the sect's support would reduce them to rogue cultivators, making their future cultivation path much more arduous.


At the very least, they wouldn't be able to occupy such a prime cave dwelling outside Skull Fortress.


Mount Shaohua was protected by a Nascent Soul ancestor and Core Formation elders in closed-door cultivation.  The fact that Senior Brother Qi was summoned back from such a distance couldn't help but spark their anxieties.


Qi Yuanshou shook his head. "Don't worry, Junior Brothers. The sect is safe and sound. With our ancestor and the protective formation, it's as stable as a rock. However, the atmosphere in the Severed Mountains and the Azure Mire has become somewhat unusual. Master urgently summoned me back to investigate."


"The Severed Mountains and the Azure Mire…"


Jade Sun's expression shifted to understanding, then to resentment. "Are the Heavenly Mandate Alliance at it again?"


Qi Yuanshou responded with a hum. "With the approaching Spirit Tide, the Heavenly Mandate Alliance always becomes restless. Whether they will actually attack remains uncertain. This isn't just Mount Shaohua's concern, but the entire Small Cold Region's. However, due to Mount Shaohua's strategic location, we are at the forefront and must exercise caution. I'm returning to investigate. Once I confirm the situation, I will inform the other sects to prepare a joint defense. You two should also make preparations. If a war truly breaks out, no cultivator in the Small Cold Region will be spared."


Qin Sang listened silently to Qi Yuanshou and Jade Sun, grasping the general situation.


The Heavenly Mandate Alliance was another major force outside the Small Cold Region, separated by the Severed Mountains and the Azure Mire. These two natural barriers served as the boundary between the two realms.


The Small Cold Region and the Heavenly Mandate Alliance had a long-standing animosity, practically sworn enemies.  The few major wars Qin Sang knew of were almost all between these two powers.


At its most brutal, the Small Cold Region had been largely occupied, and only the combined forces of the righteous, demonic, and beast factions had managed to repel the Heavenly Mandate Alliance.


However, the last war had been a long time ago. For centuries, the Small Cold Region had been very stable, with both sides maintaining a tacit understanding.


Qin Sang, previously focused solely on his own cultivation breakthroughs, hadn't paid much attention to these matters. With so many high-level cultivators in the Small Cold Region, he figured any major threats wouldn't fall on his shoulders.


He hadn't expected that he might experience a war between the two regions during his cultivation journey!


This caused Qin Sang to frown with worry.


He had experienced mortal wars, and some of the gruesome scenes remained vivid in his memory. A war between cultivators would undoubtedly be far more terrifying!


Once a war started, the momentum would be like a torrential flood, unstoppable.


Only Nascent Soul Grandmasters at the top of the pyramid could easily extricate themselves. Even Core Formation cultivators could be swept away if they weren't careful.


Foundation Establishment cultivators like them couldn't even dream of resisting such a force. They could only follow the tide, wherever it may take them.


There might be opportunities within, but more likely, dangers.


The most terrifying aspect was the complete lack of control over one's future and life!


Although he cultivated through the path of slaughter, he didn't want to be engulfed by a tide of carnage.


His chosen path didn't require him to experience slaughter within a war to gain insights. He only needed to diligently cultivate in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to steadily reach the pseudo-Core Formation realm.


With this in mind, Qin Sang quickly inquired about the details.


"With the Spirit Tide approaching, we must allocate manpower to Seven Heroes Pass to defend against the frenzied Cloud Beasts. If the Heavenly Mandate Alliance invades at this time, the Small Cold Region will be attacked from both sides, which would be their ideal opportunity.  Looking back, almost every major war has coincided with the Spirit Tide," Qi Yuanshou sighed.  "As for the reason for the war, it's nothing more than competition for cultivation resources. Although the Ancient Immortal Battlefield is dangerous, it's a treasure trove exclusively occupied by us. Do you really think others aren't envious? Moreover, deep within the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, there's also..."


Qi Yuanshou paused, then changed the subject. "You don't need to worry too much. During the last Spirit Tide, the Heavenly Mandate Alliance did make some moves, but they retreated before we could organize a counterattack. It was more like a show of force, a harassment tactic born of resentment.  It seems the lessons from the last war were profound. This time, it's likely the same. They may not dare to launch a full-scale invasion, but we must take necessary precautions."


Qi Yuanshou briefly explained the situation and gave some necessary instructions.


Qin Sang still planned to return to the Heavenly Crystal Secret Realm to cultivate. He declined Junior Brother Rong's invitation to stay at Skull Fortress. After a brief conversation, he departed.


Qin Sang walked towards the Taiyi Alchemy Pavilion, his heart heavy with worry.


He knew that with his meager strength, he couldn't change the situation.  Regardless of how things unfolded, he could only accept it. The only thing he could do was to improve his strength as quickly as possible.
