<h1>Chapter 907: The Immense Power of Heaven and Earth</h1><p>Chapter 907: The Immense Power of Heaven and Earth</p><p>A deserted island.</p><p>The sun set in the west, painting the sky with red clouds, and the red tide beat against the shore.</p><p>A streak of light, like a shooting star, flew towards the island, paused briefly above it, then swerved downwards and disappeared into the dense forest in the center of the island, revealing the figure of a man carrying a black coffin.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>After receiving a message from his clone, he set off in a certain direction, flying day and night without stopping.  Once he was sure he was safe, he landed on this island to rest for a while and examine his spoils.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, activated his ebony sword to dig a hole at the base of an old tree, set up some restrictions and concealment prohibitions, and slipped into the cave.</p><p>Silence returned to the island.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang rested for a moment, took out two pouches, and placed them in front of him.</p><p>He had hastily placed seals on the pouches, which he removed with a wave of his hand before emptying their contents.</p><p>Initially, he didn't notice the stone platform and searched without finding the treasure he expected.</p><p>There were over a dozen Beast King Banners. Qin Sang placed them with the one he already had, intending to study them carefully later; perhaps he could replicate the set.</p><p>There were also numerous spirit stones, pills, and spiritual materials, all of which he put away.</p><p>The black-robed man and the dwarf were both Foundation Establishment cultivators from a major Wu tribe, of high status and immense wealth.</p><p>With this, added to the amazing harvest from killing the Fourth Brother of Black Serpent Mountain, he wouldn't have to worry about cultivation resources for at least several decades before the Seven Killing Hall opened.</p><p>However, after careful consideration, Qin Sang realized that his cultivation would soon stagnate.  Only body refinement and cultivating external avatars consumed significant resources.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang beckoned, drawing a jade slip into his palm, eager to examine it.</p><p>The jade slip contained two parts.</p><p>One was a cultivation technique called "Yuan Chen Jue".</p><p>The other was a spell called "Control Thunder Technique".</p><p>"Control Thunder Technique..."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, a hint of joy appearing on his face.  "This spell must be the terrifying thunder magic used by the cultivators on Dou Niu Peak."</p><p>The Control Thunder Technique had left a deep impression on him.  At the time, it had been extremely dangerous; the five Foundation Establishment cultivators, controlling the "Heavenly Cold Fierce Wind Array," were struck from a distance by the thunder that forcefully broke through the array. The remaining power was still incredibly frightening, destroying his Golden Light Armor.  Even now, the memory made him shudder.</p><p>If it weren't for the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's ability to control thunder, he probably wouldn't have escaped so easily.</p><p>The mixture of thunder and star煞 energy had also greatly piqued Qin Sang's curiosity.</p><p>However, the Control Thunder Technique wasn't what Qin Sang urgently needed. He skimmed through it before carefully examining the Yuan Chen Jue, his face falling into disappointment.</p><p>It wasn't what he had expected.</p><p>The true secret transmission of Dou Niu Peak wasn't a cultivation technique, but this incredibly powerful spell.  The Yuan Chen Jue seemed to be a technique specifically created or found to complement the Control Thunder Technique.</p><p>The Yuan Chen Jue and Control Thunder Technique had no connection.</p><p>The Control Thunder Technique was an independent inheritance. Perhaps it originally had a companion cultivation technique, but for some reason, it was lost, making it impossible to cultivate alone, hence the search for the Yuan Chen Jue.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen this kind of situation many times before and wasn't surprised.</p><p>The Yuan Chen Jue was a very ordinary cultivation technique.</p><p>Its only merit was that it helped resist the intrusion of煞 energy and dissolve internal煞 energy.</p><p>The essence of the spell was to borrow the power of star煞 to control thunder, hence the name "Control Thunder Technique".  That's why, when Qin Sang was struck by lightning, he felt the strange coexistence of star煞 and thunder.</p><p>People admire the dreamy beauty of the celestial constellations but fear the chaotic and gloomy star煞.</p><p>They don't realize that the immense powers of heaven and earth are countless, all mysterious and powerful, without inherent good or evil. To heaven and earth, cultivators are just slightly larger ants than ordinary mortals; fear stems from the unknown.</p><p>While others fear the star煞 like a tiger, among both humans and demons, there have been brilliant ancestors who attempted to control this power, forging distinctly different paths.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Refining Form" uses the power of the celestial constellations to refine the body, using star煞 to temper the bloodline, step by step achieving ascension to the realm of Heavenly Demon.</p><p>The "Control Thunder Technique" uses star煞 to control another immense power of heaven and earth, creating a top-tier spell.</p><p>Unfortunately, humans are not as naturally gifted as demons; this spell harbors hidden dangers. While cultivating the Control Thunder Technique, one is very easily invaded by star煞 into their primordial spirit, making it difficult to remove.  Becoming mad is the least of the worries; one can only find ways to resolve it.</p><p>Lan Doumen sought out the "Yuan Chen Jue," intending to resolve a hidden danger.  It likely failed, otherwise the Dou Niu Peak lineage wouldn't have been abandoned.</p><p>Neither the "Yuan Chen Jue" nor the "Yi Lei Shu" mentioned stellar energy infusion; that path seems impassable.</p><p>However, this year-long, painstaking endeavor yielded considerable rewards.</p><p>He thwarted his enemies' plans, avenged himself, and obtained a useful technique and spell.</p><p>The technique is the "Yin Yang Tian Dou Secret Art."</p><p>Qin Sang, protected by a jade Buddha, is unafraid of star煞 (sha), rendering "Yuan Chen Jue" largely useless to him.</p><p>Among the techniques Qin Sang has seen over the years, besides the unconventional and extraordinary lineages like the "Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang" and "Tian Yao Lian Xing,"</p><p>the most impressive is Lan Doumen's Yin Yang lineage's "Yin Yang Tian Dou Secret Art."</p><p>His accidental condensation of煞 (sha) and罡 (gang) during his Golden Core formation gave him a deeper understanding of Yin and Yang than most.</p><p>The "Yin Yang Tian Dou Secret Art," however, cultivates Yin Yang armor and Yin Yang energy from the very beginning of cultivation.  Having obtained the first layer of the "Yin Yang Tian Dou Secret Art," he finds it truly remarkable—a major orthodox Xuanmen lineage in ancient times.</p><p>Cultivating this technique should greatly aid Golden Core formation.</p><p>Yet the Yin Yang lineage's decline leads Qin Sang to suspect that the ancestor who created the later stages may not have fully grasped the original technique's essence, thus losing interest.</p><p>The Yin Yang armor, however, can conceal the Buddha's light, resolving a minor threat.</p><p>Qin Sang's greatest surprise is the "Yi Lei Shu."</p><p>This spell's power is immense. Others are hesitant to cultivate it due to concerns about star煞 (sha), but he has no such worries. Furthermore, his concurrent cultivation of "Tian Yao Lian Xing" will aid in learning this spell.</p><p>Mastering the "Yi Lei Shu" would be a powerful weapon, even surpassing the Star Conch.  Once he reaches the later stages of Golden Core, it could threaten even Nascent Soul masters.</p><p>With the successful breakthrough of "Tian Yao Lian Xing," cultivating both body and skills, reaching the later stages of Golden Core won't be difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang is realistic; he won't provoke Nascent Soul masters lightly.  However, life is unpredictable, and the Qisha Hall is ever-changing; no one knows what the future holds.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the "Yi Lei Shu" several times, memorizing it thoroughly and carefully analyzing it before confirming its suitability for his cultivation.</p>
