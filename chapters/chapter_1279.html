<h1>Chapter 1271: The Messenger</h1><p>Chapter 1271: The Messenger</p><p>This place was once a blood hell, a land of execution grounds.  Even after countless years of sealing, the carnage and bloodshed of the past are still palpable in the ruins.</p><p>The world was awash in blood.</p><p>Thick blood mist, charged with malevolent energy, filled the air.  Those who entered felt as if they were submerged in a sea of blood, a chilling, bone-deep cold.  An oppressive and eerie atmosphere permeated everything, causing involuntary tension.</p><p>Ancient prohibitions were everywhere.</p><p>However, the greatest danger wasn't the prohibitions, but the living creatures.  The monsters born from this wicked, bloody land were undoubtedly chaotic, bloodthirsty, and extremely dangerous.</p><p>Fortunately, since entering the Blood Mist Basin, aside from the blood and flesh puppets in the Black Tower formation, they hadn't encountered any living monsters.  Even the puppets were mindless corpses.</p><p>But the moment they burst through the gate, everyone's expression changed.</p><p>The flag gate formation in front faltered slightly.</p><p>Their worst fears had come to pass!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>…</p><p>The ground trembled.</p><p>From the depths of the blood mist, thunderous sounds erupted from all directions.  It sounded like countless giant beasts running, their footsteps pounding the earth.  Accompanying this were roars, some distant and indistinct, others close at hand.</p><p>The blood mist and ancient prohibitions obscured vision. Everything about the monsters was unknown; only the booming sounds and roars echoed incessantly, chilling everyone to the bone.</p><p>What caused this sudden change?</p><p>Everyone looked around in bewilderment, feeling surrounded by monsters.  They saw only a world of blood, unable to locate the creatures, but they sensed disturbances deep within the blood mist, causing the mist to churn in chaotic turmoil.</p><p>For a moment, fear gripped everyone.</p><p>Although they were top-tier experts of their time, there were countless existences in the cultivation world that could threaten them, especially in places like Blood Lake and Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Similar tragedies had occurred more than once.</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly. He recalled the unknown monsters he and Dongyang Bo had disturbed at the bottom of the Blood River.  Leaving the Blood River, he had lingered outside for a while, observing the awakened monster. Seeing it remain inactive, he waited until the Blood River calmed before leaving.</p><p>Could it be my doing?</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Only one monster had awakened then; now, an unknown number lurked in the blood mist. If they all possessed comparable strength to that monster, their situation would be extremely perilous!</p><p>The flag gate formation paused briefly, then plunged into the blood mist.  Their pursuers were relentless; they couldn't worry about the monsters within.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances, stopping simultaneously and watching the flag gate formation disappear from sight.</p><p>Finding the cause of the disturbance, determining the nature of the monsters, and escaping the danger as quickly as possible were the priorities.  They didn't want to die alongside Ye Laomo.</p><p>Just then, a figure suddenly flashed from the blood mist.</p><p>Upon seeing this person, a flicker of surprise crossed Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Everyone else was equally surprised.</p><p>It was Dongyang Bo, missing for so long!</p><p>Dongyang Bo, still in his elegant robe, looked scholarly, though his face was unnaturally pale, as if injured, yet his breath was steady.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist...?"</p><p>The group stepped out of the formation, looking at Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Several gazes subtly scanned between Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo, their expressions varied.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, lost in thought.</p><p>After Qin Sang revealed his identity, some of the more perceptive among them suspected a connection between Dongyang Bo's disappearance and Qin Sang.  Qin Sang had forced Ye Laomo to self-destruct his avatar; with premeditation, he had the ability to kill Dongyang Bo.</p><p>The scene of Qin Sang sacrificing his Blood Demon avatar and revealing his true appearance was deeply ingrained in everyone's minds.</p><p>No one was foolish enough to confront him directly.</p><p>Alienating a top expert who had just made a great contribution was unwise.  If he sided with the Abyss of Sin or the Heavenly Demon Mound, they would deeply regret it.</p><p>Besides, there was no proof.</p><p>No one knew the extent of the animosity between the former master and his disciple, whether it had reached a point of no return.</p><p>Dongyang Bo appeared before the group.  Seeing Qin Sang without his mask, his pupils constricted slightly, then he composed himself, saying, "The monsters in the Blood Lake have awakened. I was injured and surrounded by monsters, delaying our meeting. Luckily, I found you by following your markers. The monsters are bloodthirsty and ferocious; some are extremely powerful. We can't stay here long; let's leave quickly!"</p><p>Some secretly observed Dongyang Bo and Qin Sang.</p><p>Both appeared calm, seemingly ignoring each other, as if Dongyang Bo had already known Qin Sang's identity.</p><p>This only deepened their suspicions.</p><p>Something was definitely going on between those two!</p><p>But now wasn't the time to worry about such trifles.</p><p>"Everything was normal before we entered.  Fellow Daoist, do you know when these monsters appeared? Why did they suddenly awaken? What are they?"  Lord Tongyou frowned, asking repeatedly.</p><p>Dongyang Bo replied, "Beneath this place are countless intertwined blood rivers, with flowing blood mist. They slumbered at the bottom of these rivers. Only a few initially awoke, wandering within the rivers, likely disturbed and awakened by our opening the seal. But shortly before, something happened – all the ancient prohibitions in the blood lake trembled, and the monsters suddenly awoke simultaneously, bursting forth from the ground…"</p><p>Having clarified the timing, Qing Jun said gravely, "Precisely when Elder Ye broke the prison seal!"</p><p>"Could they be blood prison guards, similar to the flesh and blood puppets? The core seal being broken affected the entire blood lake?"</p><p>Lord Tongyou quickly asked Dongyang Bo about the monsters' appearance, confirming their resemblance to the flesh and blood puppets.</p><p>"When we passed through the Black Tower Formation earlier, the flesh and blood puppets seemed… unusual."</p><p>Someone recalled.</p><p>Zuiyuan, desperate to escape, deliberately avoided the flesh and blood puppets in the Black Tower Formation, so they hadn't noticed anything unusual about them.</p><p>They immediately returned to the Blood Gate to confirm this.  The flesh and blood puppets were restricted by the Black Tower Formation, unlike the frenzied monsters outside.</p><p>If each monster possessed the strength comparable to a flesh and blood puppet, they were in serious trouble!</p><p>They had planned to explore the Black Tower Formation thoroughly after pursuing Elder Ye, but unforeseen circumstances arose, forcing them to abandon this plan.</p><p>"Our only course of action is to leave the Blood Lake as soon as possible and restore the seal, hoping these monsters won't venture beyond the lake. If we let them loose, not only Xiaohan Domain would be the first to suffer, but the entire Beichen Region would face a great calamity."</p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed, "When the monsters burst from the ground, I sensed several extremely powerful auras, far surpassing ours. They're invincible."</p><p>His decision to stay and not return to Xiaohan Domain after tending to his injuries was carefully considered.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's strength, no one would dare oppose him. Moreover, Qin Sang wasn't alone; his ambiguous relationship with the Yaozu, and his alliance with Qing Jun, were all factors.</p><p>If Qin Sang chose to, he would undoubtedly shine during the confrontation with Zuiyuan.</p><p>Then, one fleeing in battle, and another achieving great merit – which side would the various forces in Xiaohan Domain favor? It's obvious.</p><p>While they wouldn't entirely side with Qin Sang, Shao Hua Mountain would undoubtedly be put in a difficult position, and years of work would be ruined.</p>
