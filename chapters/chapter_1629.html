<h1>Chapter 1620: The Five Elements Crown</h1><p>Chaos!</p><p>Standing atop the mountain, witnessing the scene beyond, everyone simultaneously shared the same thought.</p><p>Even from the highest point, it was impossible to see much clearly.</p><p>Within the Unseen Immortal Sect, mist and clouds swirled, a sea of mist filled with vibrant colors.  The glow of various prohibitions and spirit arrays flickered incessantly, countless magic swords drifted in the void – complete pandemonium.</p><p>Straining their vision, the group could only vaguely make out layers of mountain shadows.</p><p>The Unseen Immortal Sect exuded an air of profound mystery.</p><p>The mountaintop had been leveled into a platform.  Judging from the remaining traces, this was originally the entrance to the Unseen Immortal Sect.  Several teleportation arrays were built on the platform, likely leading to different locations within the sect – all once neatly organized.</p><p>Each teleportation array had a stone tablet behind it.</p><p>However, these arrays had long been destroyed from the opposite side and were beyond repair.  The stone tablets, surely protected by prohibitions in the past, were now reduced to fragmented remains.</p><p>From the surviving text on these fragments, words like "valley," "hall," and "pavilion" could be discerned, but most were shards, only allowing for rough guesses about their functions.</p><p>In the center of the platform, several teleportation array locations were clearly of great importance. One stone tablet miraculously preserved complete writing – "Earth Aspect Hall!"</p><p>Four other teleportation arrays, along with the Earth Aspect Hall array, were arranged to protect a central array.</p><p>Su Zinan pointed to these arrays, “Based on what fellow cultivators have mentioned, these should be the core of the Unseen Immortal Sect. This unnamed teleportation array is guarded by the Five Elements Halls, indicating its high status.  The Unseen Immortal Sect's most precious treasure, the Five Elements Crown, must be stored here, right?”</p><p>He paused, his gaze seeking confirmation from Zhu Wudao, the scarred-faced man, and the others.</p><p>The scarred-faced man ignored him.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, unwilling to clash with Su Zinan at this moment, replied while observing the Unseen Immortal Sect, “When the Unseen Immortal Sect suffered its catastrophic destruction, its heritage was scattered, and the Five Elements Crown disappeared without a trace. No one knows where it ended up.  It might still be hidden somewhere within the ruins, gathering dust, or perhaps it’s already been taken away…”</p><p>“In that case, the Five Elements Crown is ownerless; whoever obtains it will possess it.  Later, let's avoid claims of ‘ancient ownership’ and unnecessary disputes,”</p><p>Su Zinan paused, a satisfied smile appearing as Zhu Wudao nodded.  “When my foster father recounted the secrets of the cultivation world to me, he never mentioned a single word about the Five Elements Crown. If it weren't for your assurances, I wouldn't believe that the Unseen Immortal Sect's most treasured artifact was such an obscure treasure.”</p><p>“If it were widely known, would I dare use the Five Elements Crown to summon the sect’s descendants?”  Zhu Wudao seemed to have spotted something, his gaze fixed on a certain direction.  “The Five Elements Crown is just one among all the Unseen Immortal Sect's treasured artifacts, the most unknown one. Back then, only the true inheritors of each lineage knew of its existence…”</p><p>It turned out that the bizarre statue worshipped by the Gu God Cult wore a crown made of five crude jade pieces fitted together – the very image of the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, through spreading the Gu God Cult, used the image of the Five Elements Crown to call out to the hidden descendants of the Unseen Immortal Sect.</p><p>While Zhu Wudao observed, others also struggled to discern the various sights within the Unseen Immortal Sect, trying to guess which secret realm they were in, but with little success.</p><p>The only certainty was the northeast direction, where numerous immortal prohibitions and towering peaks were layered upon each other.  Even the chaos couldn't completely obscure the aura of a grand immortal sect – surely a vital area of the Unseen Immortal Sect!</p><p>The Five Aspects Hall was most likely in that direction.</p><p>Finding his target, Zhu Wudao was the first to descend the mountain.</p><p>Based on his demonstrated knowledge of the Unseen Immortal Sect, no one present could match him.  The others immediately followed him down.</p><p>"Hmm? The anti-flight prohibition is weakening."</p><p>Not far from the summit, Mo Xingdao was the first to notice the change.  He leaped, rising about seven feet before feeling the pressure, a sensation of being targeted by magic swords.</p><p>Everyone tried the same, confirming his discovery.</p><p>The swordsman gazed ahead, pondering, "The Unseen Immortal Sect's chaos isn't just on the surface; the prohibitions and spirit arrays defy common sense.  In some places, the restrictions are weaker, allowing for higher flight; in others, they're stronger.”</p><p>"Precisely!” Zhu Wudao, his figure moving relentlessly, said without looking back, “Everyone, proceed with caution.  If any unexpected changes occur, it could affect others."</p><p>Following his advice, they continued their low-altitude flight.</p><p>Reaching the foot of the mountain…</p><p>A vast expanse of desolate, rocky beach stretched as far as the eye could see, filled with rubble, devoid of vegetation.</p><p>Zhu Wudao flew onto the beach, suddenly stopping, glancing down, and picking up a piece of grayish-white rubble.</p><p>This wasn't just a stone, but a fragment of meticulously refined spirit material, yet not like a broken magic treasure.</p><p>The boundless beach was littered with these fragments.</p><p>In countless numbers.</p><p>Others also discovered the true nature of the beach.</p><p>Just then, the fragments on the surface of the beach suddenly trembled, a dull rumbling sound emanating from beneath – like the pulse of the earth.</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>Su Zinan’s expression changed slightly, a bad feeling washing over him.  Even as a successor of the Divine Transformation lineage, he dared not be careless within the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's grounds. This place was far more complex than a mere Divine Transformation training ground; countless unknown entities lurked here.</p><p>The tremors beneath their feet intensified.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ground exploded.</p><p>Immediately after, a flurry of explosions rocked the stone beach.  Amidst the *bang, bang* sounds, fragments flew everywhere as bizarre, shadowy figures burst forth.</p><p>Before these shadows appeared, Zhu Wudao and the others had detected no life force fluctuations.</p><p>The shadows emerged from the stone beach, silent and lacking any discernible aura.  They turned as one towards Zhu Wudao and the others.</p><p>“War-Formation Puppets!”</p><p>Zhu Wudao recognized the shadows, his expression darkening.  The figures were puppets, crafted by the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  Their forms varied, designed for optimal coordination within a battle formation.</p><p>These were pure killing machines, born for warfare.  Sensing an intrusion, they attacked all enemies indiscriminately.</p><p>Although Zhu Wudao had inherited from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, he couldn't control the Legacy Grounds. These war-formation puppets wouldn't recognize him.</p><p>The puppets’ eyes were vacant and lifeless.</p><p>Even with their high cultivation, the sight of so many puppets caused a tightening in their hearts.</p><p>The next moment, the sound of piercing air filled the heavens!</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Darkness enveloped them as the war-formation puppets surged forward, the sky above the stone beach instantly filled with a dense, oppressive mass.</p><p>Their keen senses detected that the individual puppets weren't particularly strong, many being maimed and broken, unable to form a proper formation. They posed no lethal threat.  However, the sheer number of puppets was overwhelming. Their support was lagging behind, leaving them to fight alone.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Without needing Zhu Wudao to say anything, everyone understood their only option.</p><p>Immediately, Su Zinan and the others unleashed their magic treasures, displaying their powers as they charged into the stone beach, attempting to carve a path through the puppets.</p><p>They were all peak-level experts, capable of obliterating small groups of puppets with a single strike, reducing them to fragments.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the puppets on the stone beach seemed inexhaustible, a never-ending stream.  Furthermore, the loss of coordinated teamwork, coupled with mutual suspicion, forced them into individual battles, making things considerably harder.</p><p>Su Zinan moved at a moderate pace, maintaining a distance from everyone, including Mo Xingdao.</p><p>He raised his right hand slightly; five dragon tendons, connected to a dragon tendon net, wrapped around his fingertip.  The net, like a fluttering butterfly, ensnared groups of puppets.  With a tightening of the tendons, the puppets were shredded into pieces.</p><p>Su Zinan's face showed no strain. His eyes flickered, subtly observing the backs of Zhu Wudao and the others, lost in thought.</p><p>At that moment, Su Zinan felt a sudden intuition, causing him to abruptly look up!</p><p>The clouds above swirled, and unknown lights flickered in the mist, their brightness fluctuating.</p><p>They had seen this sight before – it was the sign of the magic swords being triggered, about to attack!</p><p>Their entry into the stone beach had not only awakened the puppets, but also the magic sword formation.</p><p>Su Zinan inwardly cursed, flicking his fingers.  Bloody light shot out, converging above his head to form a blood amulet.  The amulet shattered with a *bang*, unleashing a visible blood ring that swept outwards.</p><p>Upon contact with the blood light, the puppets' joints seemed to rust, their speed drastically reduced.</p><p>Su Zinan rapidly swung his right hand, spreading the dragon tendon net overhead, forming a defensive barrier.</p><p>At the same time, a deafening roar descended from above.</p><p>Magic swords, countless in number, rained down from the sky!</p><p>In an instant, all figures vanished, swallowed by a sea of magic swords and puppets.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, with a golden mirror above his head, braced against the impact of the magic swords.  Golden light enveloped him, repelling nearby puppets as he relentlessly pushed forward towards his chosen direction.</p><p>His target wasn't the northeast, the previously assumed location of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's main area, but rather, a slightly offset direction towards the north.</p><p>Since entering the stone beach, the sword-carrying man had closely followed Zhu Wudao, consistently wielding his heavy sword with relentless strikes.</p><p>He used sword techniques adapted for a broadsword.</p><p>The style was unusual, yet the power was undeniable, effectively masking his identity.</p><p>The heavy sword's force cut through the puppet horde as if they were nothing.</p><p>As the magic swords descended, the sword-carrying man remained calm amidst the chaos, his sword a whirlwind around him, creating a protective blade-storm while maintaining a fixed focus on Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>The strange-faced man and the Crying Spirit Cave Master had somehow found each other.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master had a red flower atop their head.</p><p>This treasure emitted beams of light, capable of repelling puppets or, when its power was reversed, of absorbing magic swords; its uses were boundless.</p><p>However, the most relaxed person of all was the strange-faced man.</p><p>He moved without touching the ground, his feet on a vine as thick as a giant serpent.  Both ends of the vine were deeply embedded in the earth, carrying the strange-faced man forward.  As soon as a puppet drew near, thinner vines would shoot out from the main vine, entangling it and dragging it underground.</p><p>When the magic swords descended, the strange-faced man reacted similarly to Su Zinan, countless vines shooting upwards to weave a net above his head.</p><p>Glancing at Zhu Wu Dao's position, the strange-faced man transmitted a message: "Master of the Weeping Spirit Cave, please stay close to Elder Zhu. I will go to the Wood Aspect Hall to obtain that secret technique, and then immediately rejoin you."</p><p>The Master of the Weeping Spirit Cave showed displeasure.</p><p>Sensing the Master's reservations, the strange-faced man added, "Elder Zhu is treacherous. We must be wary of him tampering with the teleportation array leading to the Heavenly Unity Hall and leading us into a trap.  This secret technique is also crucial, second only in importance to the Immortal Palace. Elder Zhu's destination and the Wood Aspect Hall are in different directions, so we must split up. I have sworn oaths by both the Demon Heart and Karma to the Master.  What else do you worry about? Elder Zhu's disciples and grandchildren haven't arrived yet. As long as you remain vigilant, you should be safe."</p><p>Finally, the Master of the Weeping Spirit Cave heeded the strange-faced man's advice and pursued Zhu Wu Dao alone.</p><p>The strange-faced man watched for a moment, then pushed off the vine, which promptly turned eastward.</p><p>The man in white robes was at the rear.</p><p>Surrounded by puppets and magic swords, he was more cautious than the others. He immediately slowed down, his body steaming with water vapor, transforming into a thick suit of water armor.</p><p>The armor looked weak.</p><p>A continuous 'popping' sound echoed as the puppets and magic swords struck the armor, but failed to penetrate it, protecting the man in white.</p><p>He proceeded unhurriedly, showing no intention of speeding up even when he lost sight of Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>In the end, he stopped, waited a while, and quietly distanced himself from the others.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao was arguably the least knowledgeable about the Unseen Immortal Sect, having only recently begun gathering information. Su Zinan, on the other hand, had heard some secrets from Elder Lu.</p><p>His agreement with Su Zinan ended after they left the Unwavering Hall. Although they temporarily allied again at Zhu Wu Dao's invitation, Su Zinan wouldn't share those secrets with him.</p><p>Besides the Five Element Crown, he didn't know what other treasures the Unseen Immortal Sect possessed.</p><p>However, Mo Xing Dao was certain of one thing: sticking with Zhu Wu Dao was the right choice!</p><p>After a fierce dash, Zhu Wu Dao finally broke free from the stone beach.</p><p>Ahead lay a ravine overgrown with weeds, which didn't look promising.</p><p>Ignoring his pursuers, Zhu Wu Dao pressed on without hesitation, soon followed by the swordsman and the Master of the Weeping Spirit Cave.</p><p>When Mo Xing Dao left the stone beach, he unexpectedly found Su Zinan missing.</p><p>The man hadn't followed, and his whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Mo Xing Dao decided to ignore Su Zinan and proceed alone.</p><p>…</p><p>Two figures appeared on the mountaintop:  Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Lingtian.</p><p>They looked down at the mountain below.</p><p>The stone beach was a sea of puppets and magic swords, too chaotic to discern the movements of others.</p><p>While Yue Lingtian observed the stele, Zi Lei Zhenren took out a jade talisman, held it in his palm, sensed it briefly, then said, "Let's go," and dashed onto the stone beach.</p><p>Yue Lingtian followed closely behind.</p><p>Before leaving, Yue Lingtian glanced back, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p>With the Cloud Dragon changing, he wondered if Hua Chenzi could arrive in time.</p><p>…</p><p>Shortly after Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Lingtian entered the stone beach, Qin Sang reached the mountaintop, also exclaiming, "What a mess!"</p><p>"Anti-flight restrictions, magic sword formations, a sea of puppets… They must have forcefully sealed the sect gates during the war with the Unseen Immortal Sect.  These restrictions have fallen silent. Now, sensing the presence of living beings, they've been reactivated…"</p><p>Qin Sang analyzed the events based on these clues.</p><p>The hasty sealing of the sect gates by the Unseen Immortal Sect's ancestors suggested many treasures had not been moved.</p><p>Scanning the area, Qin Sang didn't rush down, instead examining the inscriptions on the stele.</p><p>"Earth Aspect Hall… some sort of Tea House…  Huh?  Lang… something…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>Legend says Lang… something… was the Unseen Immortal Sect's treasure repository.</p><p>The Unseen Immortal Sect wouldn't have named it arbitrarily;  the Lang… something… must be the sect's scripture library!</p>
