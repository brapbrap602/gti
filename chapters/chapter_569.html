Chapter 562: The Sacred Treasure of the Yao


The moment the Celestial Gate appeared, more than a dozen figures flew out from the warships and the four-colored cloud formations, assembling at the forefront.

Half were from the Minor Cold Realm and the other half from the Heavenly March Alliance, led by True Unity Elder and Redhair Ancestor, respectively.  Between them stood a uniquely adorned, feathered man.

This man was tall and slender, with narrow eyes, a hooked nose, and a somewhat effeminate gaze. He wore exquisitely crafted robes, brilliantly colored as if woven from beautiful plumes.

Upon his head, he wore an elaborate crown, sparkling with jewels.  A closer look, however, would reveal a startling detail: the crown's frame was crafted from the bleached bones of some unknown monstrous beast, the bone spurs concealed beneath the glittering jewels.

This attire resembled less that of a cultivator and more that of a mortal king.

“The Celestial Gate has appeared; there's no time to lose.  Your Majesty, Feather Demon King, we request that you utilize your sacred treasure to locate the weakest point of the Celestial Array,” Redhair Ancestor and True Unity Elder said, bowing to the feathered man.

He was the Demon King of the Heavenly Yao Hills!

The Feather Demon King nodded slightly, removed his crown, and said, “I shall begin immediately. Fellow Daoists, please step back.”

Redhair Ancestor, True Unity Elder, and the others retreated.

The Feather Demon King stood alone at the forefront, beckoning with his hand.  Two similarly strange-looking cultivators, a man and a woman, also Demon Kings from the Heavenly Yao Hills, flew forward.  They positioned themselves between the human cultivators and the Feather Demon King, watching the humans warily.

After a moment, the Feather Demon King flew forward, closer to the vortex, stopping only when he could barely withstand the chaotic forces emanating from it. He looked upwards.

After observing for a while, the Feather Demon King tossed the crown upwards, muttering incantations. A flicker of pain crossed his face as he spat out a mouthful of blood essence.

The blood landed precisely on the crown, which absorbed it completely.

Having devoured the blood essence, the crown erupted in brilliant light.  Countless multicolored rays shot outwards, a myriad of rainbows obscuring not only the crown itself but also the Feather Demon King.

Just then, an exceptionally sharp cry echoed from the center of the light, a sound that even the roar of the wind vortex couldn't suppress.  

Accompanying the increasingly loud cry, a massive phantom appeared within the light.

The phantom stood on one leg, like a divine bird. Layers of radiant light obscured its true form, making it impossible to discern its species.

However, the powerful aura emanating from the divine bird could not be concealed by the light. All present were Nascent Soul cultivators, and their expressions turned grave, including Redhair Ancestor and True Unity Elder.

‘Screech!’

The divine bird shrieked and soared towards the vortex, undaunted.

But the vortex was not easily breached.  The chaotic forces within, like countless sharp swords, assaulted the divine bird.  Even the powerful bird struggled to resist. As it flew, countless specks of light scattered like shredded feathers, leaving a comet-like trail.

Yet, it showed no fear, pressing forward with bright, determined eyes.

The vortex began to react to the bird's intrusion.  The bird’s powerful force stirred the swirling clouds, radiating outwards.

However, this could not prevent the bird’s demise. Its body grew smaller and smaller, seemingly on the verge of being completely annihilated by the vortex.

Suddenly, the divine bird let out a long cry.  Its body ignited in flames.

As the divine bird willingly immolated itself, its eyes shot out two beams of tangible light, like two sharp swords, piercing deep into the vortex.

‘Boom!’

The vortex trembled violently, and a strange phenomenon occurred.  Mysterious runes appeared below the Celestial Gate, flickering briefly before vanishing.

The divine bird's sacrifice had revealed the Celestial Array!

With the bird’s disappearance, the brilliant light dispersed, revealing the Feather Demon King and his crown.  He caught the crown, his figure flashing as he rapidly retreated. The other two Demon Kings flew forward to meet him, flanking him protectively as they returned.

The Feather Demon King’s face was abnormally pale, and the once radiant crown had dimmed.

It seemed that summoning the divine bird had taken a toll.

“Each use of this treasure consumes most of my lifeblood.  Even with my cultivation, I nearly lost control. I had to damage its essence to succeed. It will require a long period of nurturing to recover,” the Feather Demon King said, swallowing a green pill. His complexion improved slightly.  He sighed and pointed towards a spot in the vortex. “Fortunately, I have fulfilled my task! As you witnessed, that is the weakest point of the Celestial Array. It will remain stable for an incense stick's time.”


Redhair Ancestor and True Unity Elder exchanged glances and bowed. “We thank you for your efforts, Feather Demon King. Your sacred treasure is truly remarkable! Without its aid, the Minor North Star Primordial Array would be utterly incapable of breaching the Celestial Array.  Your single treasure has saved us countless precious spirit materials!”

The Feather Demon King waved his hand dismissively.  “When my ancestors led our people to establish ourselves in the Minor Cold Realm, assisting in breaking the Celestial Array of the Purple Star Palace was one of the conditions agreed upon with your human race. We, the descendants of the Sacred Ones, will naturally honor this agreement and fully support you in breaking the array. Furthermore, entering the Purple Star Palace will also benefit us. I have just taken a healing elixir and require a moment to meditate and refine its power. Please proceed.”

The Feather Demon King returned alone to the iridescent beast while the other two Demon Kings remained.

Redhair Ancestor and True Unity Elder stepped forward, each accompanied by another cultivator: Coldcloud Sky of the Yuan Mirage Sect and a young Daoist priest in a black-yellow robe.

After a brief discussion, the four separated, each taking a position and sitting cross-legged in the void.

The other Nascent Soul cultivators also flew forward, forming a circle around the four and similarly sitting in meditation. Their spiritual energies intertwined.

Redhair Ancestor and True Unity Elder each produced a pouch, tossing them upwards.

“Go!”

With a series of clinking sounds, tens of thousands of crystal beads flew from the pouches, reflecting dazzling light as they flowed out and converged in midair.

These beads were the Star Origin Stones gathered by the two realms.

Redhair Ancestor and True Unity Elder made hand seals.

The initially scattered Star Origin Stones, guided by the two leaders, flew towards the center of the four cultivators, coalescing into a sphere that hovered motionless.

Redhair Ancestor called out, “Fellow Daoists, we may begin!”

Coldcloud Sky and the yellow-robed Daoist’s expressions turned serious.  They immediately entered deep meditation, focusing their efforts on assisting with the array formation.

A series of hand seals formed at the fingertips of the four, flying continuously towards the sphere of Star Origin Stones. Each seal drew out a varying number of stones.
