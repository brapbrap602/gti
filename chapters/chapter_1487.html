<h1>Chapter 1478: The Grand Wedding (8k)</h1><p>Chapter 1478: The Grand Wedding (8k)</p><p>A cave dwelling.</p><p>Before Qin Sang, his external avatar sat cross-legged facing him.  The Sun God Tree floated between them, divine birds held their heads high and tails aloft, the aura of the Nanming Li Fire occasionally surged forth, its fiery glow illuminating their faces.  Both Qin Sang and his avatar had their eyes closed.</p><p>They had maintained this posture for a month.  At this point, the avatar's cultivation had caught up to Qin Sang's, reaching the astonishing mid-Yuan Ying stage; it had not regressed, but rather surpassed its previous state when it was a spirit puppet.  The refinement of the soul shadows within Qin Sang’s second primordial spirit was largely responsible.  The remaining credit belonged to  Luli. Qin Sang had borrowed some Ice Soul Jade from her, and after absorbing them, his strength rapidly increased to a level commensurate with his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang thus learned that although Luli had failed to break through many years ago, she had, with her tenacious willpower, stubbornly cultivated the Ice Soul Radiance divine ability despite the influence of the heretical cultivation's imprint.  These Ice Soul Jades were no longer very useful to her, which is why Qin Sang had borrowed them so easily.</p><p>In the past, Bing Yao had obtained a considerable number of Ice Soul Jades, but they weren’t as affluent as the Green Sun Demon Sect, where the entire Divine Gang Peak was full of Green Sun Jades, an inexhaustible supply.  All the Ice Soul Jades were taken away by Bing Yao, leaving Luli with only a small amount.  With Bing Yao’s ascension, the Ice Soul Jades were gone, and they would have to be sought elsewhere if needed.</p><p>Supporting Qin Sang was like supporting herself, so Luli readily handed over her remaining Ice Soul Jades.</p><p>A small portion of the soul shadows within the avatar remained unrefined. Qin Sang estimated that even if they were all refined, there was little hope of breaking through to the late Yuan Ying stage, unless the Dao Tree could bring him unexpected surprises.</p><p>However, with Qin Sang's current cultivation, possessing a mid-Yuan Ying stage external avatar was absolutely unimaginable for others, let alone the mystical ability to resurrect his main body.  His current task was to help the avatar refine the Sun God Tree.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, another major use of the external avatar was to provide him with two opportunities to use the Sun God Tree. The Sun God Tree could only be used like a thunderclap; it wasn't a spiritual treasure and didn't require a master or any treasure refinement techniques. This simple and brutal method of control allowed even the avatar to wield it.</p><p>However, from the moment the avatar was created, they had already embarked on completely different paths. After the avatar’s creation, Qin Sang made a new discovery.  The avatar didn't have to cultivate the cultivation technique included in the *Cold Nether Yin Return* scripture.  Because it needed to maintain the illusory Yuan Ying state, reducing the risk of betrayal, this technique was somewhat mediocre in cultivation; the avatar could only refine cold energy and slowly improve its cultivation, which shows its advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Qin Sang could allow the avatar to cultivate other techniques. The price was to cancel the illusory Yuan Ying state and transform it into a real Yuan Ying. While this wouldn't affect resurrection, it would further weaken the main body's control over the avatar. This is a common problem with external avatars and second primordial spirit-type secret arts.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha's assistance, Qin Sang's control over the avatar far exceeded that of others. He just needed to ensure that the avatar's cultivation didn't surpass his own by too much.  The avatar had to choose a cultivation technique within the icy path.  The Profound Heaven Palace didn’t lack such techniques, but Qin Sang wasn’t sure which ones were suitable and didn’t have the time to carefully select one, so it remained as it was.</p><p>Different paths.  Most of Qin Sang's treasures and secret techniques, even if the avatar managed to use them, could not exert their full power.  After careful consideration, apart from the Sun God Tree, the most suitable were the Golden Sinking Sword and the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.</p><p>The avatar did not yet have a suitable treasure; the main body controlled fire, and the avatar controlled the sword; their division of labor was clear.  Coupled with the several divine abilities recorded in the *Cold Nether Yin Return*, the avatar already possessed considerable strength.</p><p>Time slowly passed.  After an unknown period, the quiet of the cave dwelling was broken. Someone outside triggered the restriction and respectfully said, "Senior, the auspicious time is approaching."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, put away the avatar and the Sun God Tree, his body flashed with light as he changed his attire, then opened the formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Listening Snow Tower, Main Peak.</p><p>It was the coldest time of the year outside, the earth covered in a layer of snow.  However, inside Listening Snow Tower, it was as warm as spring, adorned with brocade and red silk, festive and lively.</p><p>Teams of disciples hurried between the jade bridges and halls, busily preparing for the upcoming ceremony. Most disciples had radiant faces.  But some had dull eyes and vacant expressions; among them were several female disciples.</p><p>This day had finally arrived.  Grandmaster Luli was to hold a Dao Companion ceremony with another man, and these meticulous preparations for the ceremony were all done by their own hands.</p><p>The sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow on the peaks of the Listening Snow Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in her secluded chamber, watching the disciples bustling outside the hall. Her gaze drifted upwards, following the fading light.  A moment of wistful reflection overcame her.</p><p>In the mortal world, marriage was the most important event in a person's life.  Now, it had become merely a component of a transaction.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace's customs were quite unique. The Daoist partner ceremony was held at night, coinciding with a crucial ritual: the Lamp Ceremony.</p><p>Countless lanterns, wrapped in red paper, adorned the peaks of Listening Snow Mountain. Once lit, the spectacle would be breathtaking.</p><p>Though the sky was not yet fully dark and the wicks unlit, the disciples responsible for the lamps were already in place, spaced at intervals, facing west, preparing and arranging the lamps according to ritual.</p><p>At this moment, an unusual quiet settled over Listening Snow Mountain.  Countless eyes focused on the slowly descending sun, silently calculating the time.</p><p>Night descended. Stars and moon hung high.</p><p>Though snow and rain were forecast, Listening Snow Mountain had already deployed a large formation to dispel the moisture, ensuring a clear night sky.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>A sudden bell toll shattered the silence.  The disciples' hearts pounded.  Unanimously, they looked towards the main peak, their faces alight with anticipation.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>…</p><p>The bell resonated, nine slow, deliberate tolls echoing across the heavens.</p><p>Before the assembled crowd, a woman in a gold-threaded crimson robe ascended from the peak of the main mountain—Shi Xue, the head of Listening Snow Mountain, and the officiant of this wedding ceremony.  Her steps were steady, her progress across the void as effortless as walking on solid ground. Reaching a height of hundreds of feet, she stopped, flicked her whisk, and clouds and mist billowed around her, creating an ethereal atmosphere.</p><p>The mist coalesced into a high altar.  A group of disciples, bearing incense burners and jade trays, gracefully flew into the air, presenting offerings of incense, flowers, lamps, water, and fruit.  The incense was heavenly fragrance, the flowers the Harmony of Heaven and Earth blossoms, the lamps Red Luan lamps, the water Moon Dew, and the fruit immortal peaches.</p><p>After the disciples arranged the offerings, they elegantly returned.  Shi Xue approached the altar, offered incense, chanted sutras, performed ritual steps, and recited sacred texts, appearing as if a celestial being.</p><p>All eyes at Listening Snow Mountain were on Shi Xue. The lamp attendants, especially, maintained serious expressions, not daring to show the slightest slackness.</p><p>After Shi Xue finished her chanting and offered a final incense, the lamp bearers, as if receiving a signal, simultaneously raised their hands.  A spirit lamp appeared in each palm, its flame igniting, shining brightly.</p><p>‘Go!’</p><p>A teenage girl, her face tense, carefully completed a hand gesture, gently touching her spirit lamp.  The lamp's flame quivered, then split into a hundred fire serpents, scattering like celestial maidens, falling precisely into the lanterns, igniting the wicks.  She glanced around, relieved that there were no mistakes, then regained her solemn expression, knowing their duties were far from over.</p><p>In an instant, countless lanterns on Listening Snow Mountain blazed, illuminating the heavens with red light!</p><p>Reflected in the firelight, the dragon and phoenix designs etched on the lanterns seemed to come alive, breaking free from the paper. Although their movements were slightly stiff—the result of being paper cutouts—they remained near the lanterns, intertwined and protecting them, lifting them gently into the air.</p><p>These lanterns rose only a few feet but shone even brighter, a blaze of light against the night sky, surrounded by ethereal beauty.</p><p>Listening Snow Mountain’s peaks transformed into a river of light.</p><p>The grandeur of the lamp lighting, an act of immense merit, illuminated the heavens and the earth, spreading its light across all directions and throughout the night.</p><p>The Red Luan Lamp Ceremony!</p><p>The young disciple, mesmerized by the unprecedented spectacle, was momentarily lost in wonder, almost forgetting her responsibilities, her eyes filled with an uncontainable longing.</p><p>The Red Luan Lamp Ceremony was the highest-ranking ritual of Listening Snow Mountain, an honor reserved for those of琉璃祖师's status. Even if she married, at most her master would be a witness, and the ceremony would be a more lavish version of a mortal wedding; the entire sect would never celebrate for her.</p><p>From above, the view was even more magnificent.</p><p>With Listening Snow Peak’s main peak as the center, the Red Luan Lamp Ceremony was divided into eastern and western sections. The western section formed the shape of a phoenix, each lantern resembling a feather, its flicker creating waves of light that resembled swaying plumage. The eastern section, long and winding, formed a dragon, its scales sparkling, its form vigorous and powerful.</p><p>Shi Xue, standing on the cloud altar, moved like a phantom, her hand gestures flowing. Suddenly, she pointed towards the main lamp on the altar, a beam of light shooting forth from her fingertip. The main lamp lit up, as if activating a magical formation.</p><p>The main lantern gathered countless lights, its flames soaring into the heavens!</p><p>At this moment, the stars in the sky seemed to tremble, echoing the Red Luan Lantern array in a dazzling display. Four stars shone particularly brightly, one surpassing even the moon in brilliance.</p><p>This was the Red Luan star!</p><p>The Red Luan star moves, signifying the marital palace.</p><p>Of course, this wasn't a genuine celestial phenomenon, but an illusion created by the grand array and the Red Luan Lantern ceremony.  Its effects were limited to the vicinity of the Listening Snow Tower; it wasn't visible in other parts of the North Sea.</p><p>Starlight poured down from the heavens, merging with the main lantern.  Countless fantastical images filled the night sky – blue birds, phoenixes, flying swords – as if the Red Luan Star God had descended to bestow blessings.</p><p>The starlight infused the lanterns, amplifying the Red Luan array's brilliance several times over. The dragons and phoenixes formed by the lanterns seemed poised to come alive.</p><p>Even from a great distance beyond the Listening Snow Tower, the magnificent lights and radiant starlight were awe-inspiring.</p><p>Shi Xue bowed again.</p><p>Suddenly, a cloud drifted into view.</p><p>Two women stood upon it; one was Luo Wan.</p><p>The other, a younger woman, appeared to be her junior, her cultivation at only the late Golden Core stage.  A hint of youthful exuberance flickered in her eyes, though she quickly suppressed it.</p><p>Luo Wan, however, showed no such restraint, her face still adorned with an alluring smile.</p><p>Some Listening Snow Tower disciples, glancing upwards, were instantly captivated by Luo Wan's gaze.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>Several figures flew from the peaks of the Listening Snow Tower, each exuding an aura no less powerful than Luo Wan's – the Tower's Yuan Ying stage masters, all returning for the ceremony. They would be greeting the guests on behalf of Qin Sang and Liu Li.</p><p>"Daoist Friend Luo, greetings."</p><p>One of them approached Luo Wan directly.</p><p>"On such a joyous occasion for my junior sister Liu Li, I couldn't miss it. I also wish to see for myself what kind of man could capture her heart," Luo Wan said with a smile.</p><p>The man laughed heartily, "Daoist friend, please be patient. Enjoy the celestial delicacies first; you'll get a good look soon enough..."</p><p>With that, the three of them flew towards Shi Xue.</p><p>Midway, more guests arrived.</p><p>Clouds filled the distance, celestial carriages and birds, a dazzling spectacle.</p><p>Distinguished guests filled the entrance, celebrating the joyous event.</p><p>Seeing this, the Listening Snow Tower's Yuan Ying masters instructed their disciples to welcome Luo Wan to the feast, offering a quick apology before resuming their duties.</p><p>Luo Wan flew to the cloud platform.</p><p>The scene had transformed.</p><p>Fragrant aromas wafted, auspicious clouds swirled.</p><p>Busy Listening Snow Tower disciples bustled about.</p><p>A disciple quickly brought a cloud bed, and soon, cranes carried jugs of wine, and flower spirits presented fruits.</p><p>Crimson clouds served as tables, rainbow clouds as seats.</p><p>Delicious delicacies and celestial fruits and wine were abundant.</p><p>Luo Wan casually sat down, glancing at Shi Xue standing on the cloud platform. She transmitted a teasing voice message:  "Old hag, I underestimated your courage, daring to let Liu Li cultivate that technique."</p><p>She mistakenly believed Liu Li was cultivating the "Divine Maiden Heart Sutra."</p><p>It wasn't far off the mark.</p><p>Shi Xue ignored her, overwhelmed by the arriving guests.</p><p>Although they hadn't formally invited guests from outside the Xuan Tian Palace, its vast influence meant all branches, regardless of size, deserved equal courtesy, resulting in a large number of attendees.</p><p>For a time, the sky above the Listening Snow Tower buzzed with activity, with Yuan Ying masters arriving and departing.</p><p>Rarely seen Yuan Ying ancestors appeared one after another.</p><p>One greeted, "Joyful occasion! Joyful occasion!"</p><p>Another offered, "Congratulations! Congratulations!"</p><p>The main peak was filled with cloud formations, each seat occupied by guests.</p><p>There was no rigid seating arrangement. People sat wherever they pleased, joining cloud beds together to chat when they recognized each other.</p><p>Everyone was happy and joyous.</p><p>Suddenly, someone announced,</p><p>"Grand Elder has arrived!"</p><p>Everyone fell silent, rising to greet them.</p><p>The Grand Elder, several other elders, and the Zi Xia Xuan sect leader arrived together, all smiling.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu stepped forward to greet them.</p><p>Greetings were exchanged.</p><p>Tong Lingyu, her beautiful eyes sparkling, asked with a smile, "Where are the newlyweds?"</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu glanced at the sky, "The auspicious time hasn't arrived yet.  Elders, please be seated and enjoy our Listening Snow Tower's prized Nine-Flower Jade Peach."</p><p>"We've long heard of the Listening Snow Tower's finest treasure.  We heard it's only served during the Tower's greatest ceremonies. My senior brother and I have never had the honor,"</p><p>Two young men in Taoist robes approached, one strikingly handsome and young, showing no fear in the presence of these Xuan Tian Palace dignitaries.</p><p>Two cultivators, both at the mid-Yuan Ying stage!</p><p>Grandmaster Jiang's eyes flickered. He clasped his hands and said, "My apologies for the delay, Master Shang and Daoist Yue. I'll have my disciples pick a basket and send it to Tianshan."</p><p>"Grandmaster Jiang, you're too kind. My junior brother was just joking..."</p><p>The speaker was Shang Lu, the head of the Tianshan sect. His tone was gentle, and he greeted everyone before heading towards a cloud bed with the cultivator surnamed Yue.</p><p>The others watched their backs, some frowning, some lost in thought.</p><p>As time passed, fewer guests arrived.</p><p>Shi Xue found an opening and approached Grandmaster Jiang, whispering, "Master Uncle, is the one surnamed Yue the genius you mentioned?"</p><p>Grandmaster Jiang sighed, "Indeed. I had high hopes for him upon his entry into the Yuan Ying stage.  To think he'd reach the mid-Yuan Ying stage after only a hundred years of seclusion! Coupled with Shang Lu's previous failure, this is his last chance, and he certainly won't miss it. Just Tianshan alone has two! The Tianshan sect is becoming increasingly prominent, its overall strength surpassing even the Xuantian sect. It only lacks a stabilizing force."</p><p>With two Tianshan cultivators working together, Qin Sang faced more than just another competitor. If they encountered each other within the restriction, he would not only be suppressed by the restriction but also face a two-on-one fight!</p><p>"Shang Lu used forbidden techniques to forcefully improve his cultivation back then but failed to qualify, damaging his foundation. I don't know if he's recovered. My brother-in-law has extraordinary abilities, so he shouldn't be afraid of them."</p><p>Shi Xue offered comfort, though she herself was uncertain.</p><p>After a brief exchange, the two separated.</p><p>Guests sat on cloud beds, bathed in starlight, enjoying themselves with laughter, drinks, and toasts.</p><p>Then.</p><p>Shi Xue looked up at the time and walked towards the central cloud platform.</p><p>The guests fell silent as they noticed her movement.</p><p>Many cloud beds moved, separating to the south and north, creating a wide path in the center.</p><p>Shi Xue stood before the platform, flicking her whisk.</p><p>Two incense-bearing acolytes chanted in unison.</p><p>"The auspicious time has arrived!"</p><p>The voice echoed far and wide.</p><p>The lights on the mountains shook, and the pure starlight at the heart of each flame flew out, slowly rising and drifting towards the ends of the Red Luan lamp array, gradually revealing the outlines of dragon and phoenix figures.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>The disciples guarding Qin Sang's cave became busy.</p><p>Some took out talismans, patting them lightly to transform them into golden armored warriors.</p><p>A Golden Core disciple opened a spirit beast pouch. A gust of demonic wind arose, and a dragon emerged, clawing and circling above the crowd.</p><p>The dragon's eyes showed no savagery; it had been tamed. Without its master's command, it remained docile in the air, refraining from roaring.</p><p>The disciple pointed forward, and the dragon flew towards the mountain's edge.</p><p>Simultaneously, a fiery torrent poured in from the west. The starlight dragon-shaped figures charged forward with awe-inspiring momentum. The dragon let out a whimper, showing a hint of fear.</p><p>But under its master's control, it couldn't retreat and pressed forward, directly towards the dragon-shaped figures.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The seemingly imposing dragon-shaped figures were illusory and were dispersed by the dragon in one blow.  However, the starlight, though scattered, remained coherent, merging into the dragon's body.</p><p>Instantly, the dragon's appearance changed, transforming into a true dragon.</p><p>It wore dragon scales, had horns, commanded clouds and mist, and exuded majestic power.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A deafening dragon's roar echoed, attracting the attention of the guests.</p><p>Immediately, a phoenix's cry, equally powerful, sounded from the west, harmonizing with the dragon's roar, resembling true divine beasts, drawing admiration from everyone.</p><p>At this moment, the two girls standing at the entrance exchanged glances, giggled softly, and sang together, "The groom, please ascend the dragon carriage."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and stepped out of the hall.</p><p>Before the hall, everyone's eyes instinctively turned to Qin Sang. On such a joyous occasion, they presumed Qin Sang would not be angry, so the disciples dared to watch.</p><p>He did not remove his Thousand Fox mask; it continuously showed his past life's appearance. Though not strikingly handsome, his cultivation and trials had refined his bearing, setting him apart.</p><p>"He is worthy of the Liuli ancestor,"</p><p>The two female disciples stared for a while, the same thought occurring to both, their faces blushing crimson.</p><p>As Qin Sang stepped out of the hall, the dragon lay prostrate, a dragon carriage bound to its back.</p><p>He glanced towards the main peak and ascended the carriage.</p><p>Golden armored warriors lined up in two rows, holding ritual objects in front of the carriage. At the very front were four fair-skinned children, adorable and smiling, each carrying an incense burner.</p><p>They burned high-quality incense.</p><p>The children led the way, the groom riding the dragon forth.</p><p>At the same time...</p><p>A fragrant breeze wafted from the west. Four young boys, carrying censers filled with burning incense, led a procession of enchanting flower spirits, their ethereal forms drifting gracefully.  Each spirit, exquisitely beautiful, scattered petals, creating a fragrant path.</p><p>But none of these flower spirits compared to the woman in the phoenix palanquin.</p><p>Liuli, having removed her veil, revealed a breathtakingly beautiful face, flawless in every way. She shed her simple robes, her hair elegantly styled, and donned a night-glowing silk dress and a five-colored cloud-patterned shawl.  Even without makeup, she was dazzling.  Even the Queen Mother's wedding wouldn't have been more splendid.</p><p>On the main peak, the guests were speechless, their eyes darting from one magnificent sight to another. The man in the dragon carriage, wearing a jade crown and a crane-feather cloak, was handsome and elegant – a perfect match.  Truly a dragon and phoenix auspicious pairing, a perfect match made in heaven!</p><p>They approached, floating towards the cloud altar.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, seated in the dragon carriage, recalled Shi Xue's instructions.  His eyes flickered, and he silently activated the *Green Bamboo Sword Scripture*.</p><p>The sound of the sword's hum echoed across the heavens, instantly silencing the dragon's roar and the phoenix's cry. Above the dragon carriage, a strange fluctuation in the air materialized into an ethereal sword, similar in shape to the Golden Sinking Sword, its energy piercing the sky.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang protected those around the dragon carriage and the golden armored guards; otherwise, they would have been scattered by the sword intent.</p><p>Then, a phoenix-shaped sword phantom appeared in the west, its sound melodious, harmonizing with the first.</p><p>The guests, sensing the impending spectacle, sat up straight.</p><p>The two ethereal swords vibrated simultaneously, preceding the couple, flying to the peak above, intertwining, their sword intents finally merging, becoming one.</p><p>This was not merely a fusion of sword intents; it also contained Qin Sang and Liuli's Dao rhymes, their paths resonating in harmony.  Their compatibility wasn't natural; Liuli had intentionally released a trace of her malevolent energy imprint, creating the illusion of a perfect couple to deceive onlookers.</p><p>To others, their Dao rhymes were perfectly harmonious, a match made in heaven, beyond reproach.  But Liuli had to fight against the malevolent energy imprint to prevent it from affecting her mind.</p><p>Just then, a melodious flute sound echoed through the gathering.</p><p>Luo Wan, appearing seemingly from nowhere, held a jade flute to her lips. The flute's notes were clear and pure, unbelievably serene.  She winked at Shi Xue.</p><p>The flute's melody, imbued with a hint of Dao rhyme, drifted towards the sword phantoms.  The other guests seemed to awaken from a dream.</p><p>Some, like Qin Sang and Liuli, manifested sword shadows, pointing them at the sky, their sword songs accompanying.  Others unleashed spells, creating illusions of sound.  Some grabbed rough stones from the ground, shaping them into chimes or drums, ignoring the stares of others, beating rhythmically and lost in their own world.</p><p>Others still grabbed a passing crane delivering wine, plucked a few feathers, and, with a few deft strokes, created a seven-stringed zither, and began to play. The startled crane, in pain, knocked over a jade jug and a table, causing a wave of laughter.</p><p>…</p><p>The myriad sounds, though not all harmonious, possessed a profound resonance. To low-level cultivators, it sounded like celestial music! This was the guests' congratulatory offering!</p><p>They were forcibly injecting their own Dao rhymes, causing disruption and pressure to help the newly coupled cultivators refine their Dao, seeking the most harmonious level.  Such an opportunity, provided by so many Yuan Ying cultivators working together, would greatly benefit a true couple.</p><p>Unfortunately, this not only offered little benefit to Qin Sang and Liuli but also burdened Liuli even more, forcing her to persevere.</p><p>Qin Sang looked through the sea of lights, meeting her pure gaze, and sighed silently.</p><p>The ethereal phenomena grew increasingly spectacular.  The low-level disciples focused intently on experiencing this, the Yuan Ying masters' display of Dao rhyme offering a great opportunity for even a minor insight.</p><p>The lamp attendants were incredibly busy. They yearned to focus on the experience, but the phenomena affected the surroundings, creating fierce winds.  This wasn't just a simple wind; the lamps violently swayed, requiring their constant attention to prevent the red-鸾 lanterns from being damaged.  Unable to focus on both, they grew increasingly anxious.</p><p>Meanwhile, the young attendants on either side remained oblivious, happily guiding the dragon and phoenix palanquins to the cloud platform.  The attendants, flower spirits, and golden armored guards paused, stepping aside.</p><p>The dragon and phoenix prostrated themselves.  Their eyes met.</p><p>Instantly, all sound ceased.  The Yuan Ying cultivators sheathed their weapons, smiling at the newlyweds.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Liuli rose simultaneously, descended from their palanquins, met in the center, and took each other's hands.</p><p>Above, only the sword auras of Qin Sang and Liuli remained.</p><p>Suddenly, a clear sword song rang out, the intent powerful. They displayed their swordsmanship; Qin Sang using a style based on the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, and Liuli showcasing a technique from the Listening Snow Tower.  This was their gift to the guests.</p><p>The assembled guests, including the Yuan Ying cultivators, fell silent, attentively observing.</p><p>Two sword auras spiraled upwards, then descended from the heavens, dissipating mid-air. Stars rained down.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli gazed at each other amidst the falling stars for a long moment, before walking hand-in-hand towards Shi Xue.  On a cloud…</p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Yue assessed Qin Sang with a critical gaze.</p><p>Shang Lu, eyes still closed, murmured, "Not weak, but we'll know for sure after a test…"</p><p>…</p><p>Shi Xue smiled, watching them approach, offering celestial incense.</p><p>"Go."</p><p>The next step was to pay respects to Heaven and Earth.  They didn't need to bow to parents, masters, or sects; only Heaven and Earth, the Dao. The meaning of Dao companions was to share a heart, a will, and walk the Dao together.</p><p>At this moment, a discordant voice cut through the air.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Shang Lu abruptly stood, halting the proceedings.</p><p>A murmur rippled through the assembly.  Many had heard rumors—decades ago, Shang Lu had expressed his affection for Liuli, only to be rejected.</p><p>Shi Xue's face hardened, her gaze fixed on Shang Lu.  "Master Shang, this is my junior sister's wedding day!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then chuckled. A fake marriage and now a kidnapping attempt?</p><p>Ignoring Shi Xue, Shang Lu looked at Liuli. "Master Shang has long known Junior Sister Liuli's feelings, and dares not hope for a change of heart. However, I'm dissatisfied with losing to this unknown Qingfeng Daoist. My Dao heart is unsettled. Only by engaging the Daoist in combat and witnessing his skill can I find peace. I hope the Daoist will grant me this."</p><p>His gaze fell upon Qin Sang, sharp as lightning, his fighting spirit surging.</p><p>Shi Xue exploded with anger. "Shang Lu, you're mad! Don't think I don't know your true intentions!"</p><p>Shang Lu didn't argue, watching the unmoved Qin Sang. His tone was playful. "I hear the Daoist single-handedly entered the demon's lair, possessing exceptional courage. Are you afraid?"</p><p>Silence fell over the gathering.</p><p>Those eager for a spectacle watched Qin Sang and Shang Lu, their sympathies clearly lying with Shang Lu, hoping he would teach Qin Sang, the outsider who had stolen his beloved, a lesson.</p><p>Tong Lingyu frowned, about to speak.</p><p>From a cloud bed nearby, a powerful voice boomed, "Master Shang's sincerity is truly earth-shaking."</p><p>All eyes turned to the source.</p><p>It was Yin Dianzhu of the Imperial Palace, ranked highest among all Dianzhus, surpassing even Jiang Dianzhu!</p><p>The Xuan Tian Sect’s leader sat below him. With the Palace Master in seclusion, he was the de facto leader of the Xuan Tian Sect. His words signified the Sect's support for Shang Lu.</p><p>Two of the most powerful factions within Xuan Tian Palace now backed Shang Lu!</p><p>"Dianzhu Yin is right."</p><p>"A little sparring wouldn't hurt, just keep it light. With so many watching, neither side will be seriously injured."</p><p>…</p><p>Such voices rose in a wave.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's gaze swept across the speakers, her expression unreadable.</p><p>Jiang Dianzhu restrained the furious Shi Xue, whispering in her ear.</p><p>Then, Liuli released Qin Sang's hand, coldly stating, "I'll fight you!"</p><p>Shang Lu was taken aback, wryly smiling.  "Junior Sister, you're a realm lower than me. I adore you, why would I fight you? And surely the Qingfeng Daoist wouldn't hide behind a woman?"</p><p>Liuli's eyes were icy, her tone lethal.  "If you harm a single hair on his head, I swear I will be your enemy for life.  You might as well kill me first."</p><p>An uproar erupted.</p><p>Liuli's decisiveness shocked everyone; even bitter internal conflicts within Xuan Tian Palace rarely became this absolute.</p><p>Shi Xue and Jiang Dianzhu were stunned.</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly surprised. After a moment of silence, he transmitted a message to Liuli, "I could actually intervene."</p><p>He knew Shang Lu wasn't truly acting out of love. His intentions were clear—the Cleansing Pool.  He was using this to create trouble and test Qin Sang's capabilities.</p><p>Qin Sang had many hidden strengths; revealing a few wouldn't matter.</p><p>Liuli was a realm below Shang Lu. While her Ice Soul Divine Light was powerful, Shang Lu, as a sect leader, certainly possessed numerous treasures and abilities.</p><p>Liuli replied, "This doesn't concern you… If you intervene, the elders will easily see through you."</p><p>She deliberately left no room for compromise, forcing Shang Lu to retreat.</p><p>Even if they fought, she wasn't afraid.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  Even though it was a fake marriage, it was a dramatic, highly public affair. He couldn't remain uninvolved.</p><p>Revealing his identity was acceptable; he held even stronger cards.</p><p>"No need for this."</p><p>Qin Sang first transmitted messages to Shi Xue and the others, then, taking Liuli’s hand, he calmly said, "This Daoist and Liuli are now Dao companions, one body. Any obstacle, any opponent, we will face it together, sharing life and death.  Master Shang, have you considered this?"</p>
