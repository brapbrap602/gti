<h1>Chapter 1159: A Turn of Events</h1><p>Chapter 1159: A Turn of Events</p><p>Yi Tiannie coveted the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid and led the Kuiyin Sect to attack the Yuanzhao Sect.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Yuanzhao Sect Master acted decisively, self-detonating his Golden Core, the sect's protective formation, and the spirit veins, instantly dismantling the attack and annihilating the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>After the battle, the Yuanzhao Sect, with the support of the Wuji Sect, occupied the Kuiyin Sect's territory.</p><p>The Kuiyin Sect initiated the conflict, and the Yuanzhao Sect's retaliation was deemed acceptable by the demonic cultivation forces, who chose not to interfere.</p><p>Traveling north through Da Sui stirred many memories for Qin Sang.</p><p>Once, he was just a lowly cultivator, easily crushed by a Foundation Establishment cultivator with a single finger. He fled in terror, living in constant fear.</p><p>Now, he was a being worthy of reverence and worship.</p><p>...</p><p>The former site of the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>Now the mountain gate of the Yuanzhao Sect.</p><p>After seizing control, the Yuanzhao Sect deployed formations to seal the Yin煞 Abyss's negative energy. Without the corrosive energy, the mountain's scenery was stunningly beautiful, completely transformed.</p><p>War clouds loomed over the cultivation world, and the Yuanzhao Sect, a third-rate sect, was struggling to survive, uncertain of its future, its protective formations constantly active.</p><p>They were also sending disciples to the front lines, leaving few strong cultivators at the sect; most were recently admitted new disciples.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master, advanced in years, remained behind to oversee the sect.</p><p>At the summit, before the Sect Master's residence.</p><p>A streak of light swiftly approached, landing before the entrance.</p><p>The visitor was a Foundation Establishment youth, his expression respectful. He activated the residence's restrictions, receiving permission to enter. He then met with the Yuanzhao Sect Master.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master, a mid-Golden Core cultivator, showed signs of age, his hair and beard completely white.</p><p>“Disciple greets the Sect Master!”</p><p>The youth quickly approached and paid his respects, presenting a talisman. “Sect Master, this message was sent back by Master. He has contacted a senior from the Taiyi Dan Sect, as you instructed, and received their assistance. Master and the senior brothers were only given patrol duties. The situation at the front remains stable; they are not currently in life-threatening danger…”</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master drew the jade slip into his hand. After reading it, he nodded. “Send word to your master to return to the sect after some time. I will personally go to the front lines.”</p><p>Hearing this, the youth was shocked. He urgently pleaded, “Sect Master, the battlefield is so dangerous; how can you…”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master interrupted him. “Precisely because it's dangerous, I must go! I'm already one foot in the grave. Dying on the battlefield isn't so bad; it might even be a good thing, giving the Yuanzhao Sect a chance. You are the sect's future hope!  Sending your Master away was meant to give him experience. I sense that the Crime Abyss has been biding its time, preparing some plot. I believe it is almost ready to be executed, and it's time for your Master to return...”</p><p>Before he could finish, a thunderous roar erupted outside.</p><p>The entire residence violently shook.</p><p>A cold light flashed in the Yuanzhao Sect Master's eyes. He immediately left the residence, hovering in midair.  Seeing the scene outside, he gasped in shock and horror.</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect was in chaos.</p><p>The sect's protective formation shone brightly, under attack from outside, a seven-colored protective dome appearing to defend against it.</p><p>Outside the dome, a dazzling array of sword lights filled the air.</p><p>These sword energies were perfectly ordered, forming a magnificent sword array.</p><p>The incredible power, even through the formation, sent a shiver down the Yuanzhao Sect Master's spine.</p><p>“Sword Intent!  A sword forming an array!”</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master cried out in surprise and terror.</p><p>Those who could comprehend Sword Intent and form an array with a single sword were exceedingly rare among Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>The scale of the attack, a single strike shaking the protective formation relentlessly, indicated the attacker was likely a Nascent Soul grandmaster!</p><p>“Who is it?!”</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master's expression changed, puzzled as to which Nascent Soul cultivator would attack. After the Wuji Sect incident, everyone in the Yuanzhao Sect had remained very low-profile under his command; there was no reason to provoke a Nascent Soul grandmaster.</p><p>At that moment, the sword array condensed another sword energy, striking the protective formation before the Yuanzhao Sect Master.</p><p>Amidst a deafening roar, the protective dome dimmed, its ability to withstand the attack uncertain.</p><p>Seeing this, the Yuanzhao Sect Master couldn't wait any longer. Gritting his teeth, he flew to the front of the dome and called out, “I wonder which senior has graced us with their presence. If I have been remiss in any way, I beg your forgiveness!”</p><p>After a moment, a voice came from outside.</p><p>“You are the Yuanzhao Sect Master? Come out and speak.”</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master's face changed drastically, but he thought again: if this Nascent Soul cultivator was determined to kill him, escape would be impossible. Hiding behind the formation would only endanger his sect.</p><p>He sighed sadly, sent a message ordering all his disciples back to their caves and to activate the protective formation, then went out.</p><p>The sword formation retracted, revealing a cloaked figure.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang.</p><p>The ebony sword was still refining the Soul-Nurturing Wood. Qin Sang used a lower-grade spiritual sword he had previously obtained to deploy the sword formation, which still possessed considerable power.</p><p>“Junior Valley Master, I greet you, senior! If any Yuanzhao Sect disciples offended you, it is only because of my poor discipline. I am willing to pay any price; please, senior, calm your anger.”</p><p>The Yuanzhao Sect Master didn't mention Qin Sang's attack on the protective formation, but instead showed great respect.</p><p>“Offended? What right do you have to offend me?”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted disdainfully.</p><p>Although he had stolen the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid from the Yuanzhao Sect, Qin Sang had no good impression of them.</p><p>Using the Ascension Ceremony as a pretext to provide the secluded place with blood sacrifices didn't seem like the actions of a righteous sect.</p><p>One glance at this Yuanzhao Sect Master revealed his dwindling lifespan.  Calculating the time, he must be the only remaining Golden Core cultivator from the Yuanzhao Sect after that incident years ago.</p><p>Back then, Valley Master was high and mighty, and Qin Sang didn't even qualify to meet him.</p><p>Now, this person was cowering before Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  In truth, there wasn't much direct enmity between himself and the Yuanzhao Sect, so he didn't feel like bullying them.  He got straight to the point:  “I recall this place originally belonged to the Kuiyin Sect. Now it's occupied by your Yuanzhao Sect.  So, the Kuiyin Sect's treasures must have fallen into your hands, haven't they?”</p><p>Kuiyin Ancestor had refined ten demonic banners; seven are missing.</p><p>Even if the banners were destroyed, the banner poles must still exist.</p><p>The Xuan Tie Pillar and the Demon-Binding Rope have similar restrictions, possibly created to counter ancient demons.</p><p>The Qisha Hall demons rioted, massacring Yuan Ying cultivators, and Qin Sang still felt the lingering fear.</p><p>When attacked by the Abyss of Sin, a three-headed, six-armed demonic shadow appeared.</p><p>In the cultivation world, countless ancient demons remain hidden.</p><p>Once Qin Sang refines the demonic fire, the banner poles will become useless.  Only by gathering all of them can he find a way to repair the Xuan Tie Pillar.</p><p>After Bai advances to Corpse King, he will have the energy to comprehend the spiritual formation that works with the Demon-Binding Rope. Based on that, creating a spiritual formation to work with the Xuan Tie Pillar is not impossible.</p><p>By then, Qin Sang will possess a treasure specifically designed to subdue ancient demons.</p><p>Even broken into banner poles, the Xuan Tie Pillar could easily suppress the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  This shows the power of this treasure must be extraordinary.</p>
