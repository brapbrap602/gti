<h1>Chapter 897: Unexpected Reunion</h1><p>Chapter 897: Unexpected Reunion</p><p>The elder hastily caught the iron token.  Upon closer inspection, it was a token belonging to a Foundation Establishment cultivator from their sect! This person was actually a senior fellow disciple. The token was genuine, bearing the unique mark of the Lan Dou Sect, undeniable proof of authenticity.  The elder and his companions were all stunned. These disciples hailed from various peaks of the Lan Dou Sect, including both the Five Elements and Yin-Yang lineages. They racked their brains, but couldn't recall such a senior uncle within the sect.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside Dongming Island.</p><p>A gathering of Foundation Establishment cultivators sat in a bamboo pavilion, enjoying the extraordinary scenery outside.  Fine wine and spiritual fruits were laid before them as they engaged in scholarly discourse, punctuated by occasional bursts of laughter. The atmosphere was seemingly very amicable. The pavilion wasn't large, but there weren't many Foundation Establishment cultivators on Dongming Island at the moment.  Everyone sat dispersed, still leaving ample space.  Leader Lu of the Lan Dou Sect and other Golden Core cultivators sat in the center, surrounded by their peers.</p><p>Qin Sang, under the alias Mingyue, sat beside Daoist Mo Yu, listening more than he spoke.  During this time, he picked up quite a few secrets about various sects on Lan Dou Island.</p><p>“Daoist Mingyue's cultivation cave is on Bao Gu Mountain in Tianxing Island? With your cultivation level, you surely wouldn't be unknown. Before I took charge of Canglan Peak, I frequently traveled to Tianxing Island, yet I never heard of you.”</p><p>Leader Lu looked at Qin Sang, his curiosity evident.</p><p>“I am merely a solitary cultivator, an insignificant figure. Moreover, before achieving Foundation Establishment, I was always active in the Demon Sea. Due to the recent upheaval in the Demon Sea, I was forced to relocate to the Inner Sea and rented a cave on Bao Gu Mountain. I rarely appeared in Tianxing City previously; therefore, few know me. Leader Lu’s unfamiliarity with me is perfectly normal.”</p><p>Qin Sang took a sip of wine, his expression calm. He added with a sigh, “I don’t know when the turmoil in the Demon Sea will subside. Fortunately, I acted quickly and escaped back to the Inner Sea in time. However, my base of operations in the Demon Sea was completely destroyed.  My troubled mind prevented me from quietly cultivating, so I decided to go out for a while. Passing by here, I happened to meet Daoist Mo Yu and have been bothering him for a few days.”</p><p>“The Demon Sea!”</p><p>Leader Lu showed a look of understanding. “No wonder Daoist Mo Yu speaks so highly of you.  You dared to venture into the Demon Sea at the Foundation Establishment stage, such courage is something I admire.”</p><p>Others echoed his sentiments.</p><p>Lan Dou Island wasn't too far from Tianxing Island. Out of curiosity, they had all visited the Demon Sea, fully aware of the dangers it held. Hearing that Qin Sang had been wandering the Demon Sea alone for so many years, they began to reassess his strength.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, “I was also forced to do so. I envy you all, having your sect as your backing. Unlike me, once affected, I became a stray dog. Leader Lu, I previously heard from Daoist Mo Yu that you were currently on Da Huang Island resisting the demon beasts. Is there any news back? When can the beast tide be repelled?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked with feigned urgency.</p><p>Leader Lu's eyes flickered. His suspicions about Qin Sang lessened, guessing that the man's presence on Dongming Island was a pretense; his true purpose was to inquire about the Demon Sea.</p><p>Seeing everyone else equally curious, Leader Lu didn't hide it, saying calmly, "My foster father is probably busy with matters and hasn't sent a message recently. However, I've heard from other fellow cultivators about the situation in the Demon Sea.  It seems that holding Da Huang Island is not difficult, but when the beast tide will recede is hard to say…"</p><p>Just then, a streak of light pierced the mist and flew directly into the bamboo pavilion.</p><p>Leader Lu's expression changed slightly. He flashed to the pavilion entrance, grabbed the light, and was about to examine it when a dull thud echoed from afar, causing the ground to tremble.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators present had excellent hearing. They vaguely heard several screams, recognizing them as the Lan Dou Sect disciples guarding outside.</p><p>“Who dares to trespass on Dongming Island!”</p><p>Daoist Hua Yang’s face turned pale, and he rushed out.</p><p>However, Leader Lu was even faster, disappearing into the mist.</p><p>Everyone exchanged glances and flew out of the pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang, unconcerned, lingered behind.  If anyone dared to provoke the Lan Dou Sect, he would be delighted; the more chaotic the situation, the more advantageous it would be to his plans.</p><p>However, he was also curious about who dared to attack Dongming Island.</p><p>When he reached the entrance, he saw Leader Lu and others confronting three Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect disciples guarding the gate lay moaning on the mountain slopes. With their cultivation levels, they were clearly no match for the attackers and were all injured.</p><p>Fortunately, the attackers hadn't gone for the kill; they were all still alive.</p><p>These three were strangers. Except for the last young man, whose cultivation was slightly weaker, the other two were mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators with powerful auras.</p><p>However,  Headmaster Lu had more than ten cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage, with Headmaster Lu himself being a peak late-stage expert.  Compared to Headmaster Lu's group, these three looked rather thin on the ground.</p><p>Despite this, the three newcomers were aggressive and showed no signs of weakness.</p><p>Even stranger to Qin Sang was the surprised and peculiar look on the faces of Headmaster Lu and Old Daoist Hua Yang upon seeing the intruders.</p><p>The leader, a burly man, sneered at Headmaster Lu: "What, Junior Brother Lu? Now that you're Headmaster and hold all the power, you don't recognize your fellow disciples?"</p><p>This caused an uproar.</p><p>Cultivators from other sects were stunned, their magical treasures still in hand, unsure whether to put them away or attack.  They had assumed an external enemy had invaded the island, expecting a united front. Hearing the man’s tone, however, it was clear that these were disciples from the Lan Dou sect, leaving them utterly confused about how to proceed.</p><p>All eyes turned to Headmaster Lu, seeking his confirmation. His face was grim, and he remained silent.</p><p>"Are you three also from the Lan Dou sect? I've never seen you before," asked a cultivator surnamed Qi.</p><p>A few showed thoughtful expressions, as if they knew something.</p><p>Headmaster Lu's gaze sharpened. He demanded, "Senior Brother Gao, you violated the agreement, appeared here, and even injured our gatekeepers. What do you intend to do?"</p><p>Were they really Lan Dou sect disciples? Could it be an internal conflict?</p><p>Lu Xiaoyun now held absolute power in the Lan Dou sect, but the sect actually had two Yuan Ying masters, meaning there was still opposition to Lu Xiaoyun's faction.  However, the other master had disappeared for many years, supposedly in seclusion.</p><p>If this person were to reappear while Lu Xiaoyun was absent…</p><p>Those present, all ancient beings who had lived for centuries, couldn't help but speculate.</p><p>A disturbance rippled through the crowd as they quietly put away their magical treasures.  As outsiders, they didn’t want to risk any misunderstandings in this unclear situation.</p><p>"A few insignificant disciples, blind and unable to recognize their senior uncles and aunts, dared to obstruct our entry.  I had to teach them a lesson!"</p><p>The burly man sneered, his expression disdainful. "Our presence here is to reclaim what rightfully belongs to our Dou Niu Peak lineage, but which you have usurped. Junior Brother Lu, return what you've taken, and I'll leave immediately and never set foot on Lan Dou Island again!"</p>
