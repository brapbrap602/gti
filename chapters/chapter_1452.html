<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang glanced outward and then retracted his gaze.</p><p>Earth-attribute Escape Arts were the rarest among the Five Elements Escape Arts. Most of their utility lay in using earth to escape, concealing the body and aura. However, this person was requesting a flying escape art similar to Thunder Escape or Wind Escape.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the secret arts and cultivation methods he had collected before, but there was nothing of that kind.</p><p>He did understand Sword Escape and Thunder Escape, but those were attained through painstaking cultivation of the Sword Dao and the divine ability bestowed by Qingluan's essence blood. He couldn't impart them to others. Otherwise, that person would surely be ecstatic.</p><p>Either wait and see if someone later trades Earth-attribute Escape Arts,</p><p>Or find another way .</p><p>Qin Sang probed his consciousness into the Mustard Seed Pouch, swept past four spirit herbs, and finally settled on a vine that was entirely dark black, only the thickness of a thumb.</p><p>The surface of this vine was rough, bulging with瘤包 , and it seemed that black浆液  was flowing inside, about to spurt out.</p><p>This object was called Gloomthorn Bramble.</p><p>As far as Qin Sang knew, there was a type of spirit pill called Profound Unity Pill, and one of its main ingredients was Gloomthorn Bramble. If cultivators practicing Earth-attribute cultivation methods took this pill, the true essence in their bodies could be凝练 , adding a bit of thickness, which would greatly benefit future cultivation and breakthroughs.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Profound Unity Pill was also a spirit pill that Qin Sang only learned about from ancient texts. The pill formula was probably even harder to find than Gloomthorn Bramble.</p><p>Before setting off, Qin Sang had exchanged for ancient formulas that might be useful to him, but he did not have the Profound Unity Pill formula, nor did he know if the Grand Yi Pill Sect had any hidden treasures.</p><p>Mount Cauldron was unlikely to have it.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang took out the Gloomthorn Bramble, many people had already begun to speak, trying to bargain with the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal*.</p><p>Body cultivators were rare in the world, and Nascent Soul-level body cultivator divine abilities were equally rare. If they could trade for one without much cost, many people would be happy to.</p><p>However, according to the rules of the Trading Convention, each cultivation method or secret art could only participate in one transaction per convention. Therefore, the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal* remained unwilling to compromise.</p><p>Seeing that he showed no sign of lowering the price, everyone's interest greatly diminished. Only a few people persisted, trying to persuade him to relax the conditions with words.</p><p>"A complete Gloomthorn Bramble!"</p><p>Qin Sang held the jade token, spoke softly, and briefly described the effects of the Profound Unity Pill. He then added, "Fellow Daoist can also directly refine the Gloomthorn Bramble. Your true essence will then be integrated with Gloomthorn Yin Qi, which will have unexpected effects when facing enemies."</p><p>Refining it like this was actually a bit wasteful.</p><p>"Does the Profound Unity Pill really have such miraculous effects?"</p><p>"Does Fellow Daoist know how to refine the Profound Unity Pill?"</p><p>"If it's true, I can give you something better..."</p><p>...</p><p>Before Qin Sang finished speaking, the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal* had not yet reacted, but other cultivators practicing Earth-attribute cultivation methods couldn't sit still. They spoke all at once, eagerly asking.</p><p>Revered Chongtai coughed lightly, suppressing the noise, "Perhaps some Fellow Daoists have forgotten these rules... Now is this Fellow Daoist's time, please be patient. You can freely communicate at the end!"</p><p>Silence returned to the island in the middle of the lake.</p><p>At this time, the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal* hesitated and opened his mouth, "Do you have the Profound Unity Pill formula?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly; this was the crux of the matter.</p><p>After a pause, he added, "If Fellow Daoist doesn't mind, after the Trading Convention ends, I can help you introduce a Grandmaster of Pill Dao. Or, give me some time, and I can inquire with my friends, but I don't guarantee that I can find it."</p><p>Qin Sang was considering returning to Northern Chen Domain to ask. He already had experience traversing the Storm Belt and wouldn't be as disheveled as last time.</p><p>But that meant they needed to contact each other privately.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind. Apart from Old Demon Hun, there weren't many people who could threaten him.</p><p>The key was the other party.</p><p>As expected, the owner of the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal* said, "I want to wait a bit longer."</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words, the enthusiasm of the others also plummeted. They thought to themselves that it was no wonder; who would use such a precious spirit herb to exchange for a body cultivator's divine ability?</p><p>Seeing that there were no strong contenders, Qin Sang didn't rush to increase his stakes, nor did he urge him. He boldly displayed the Gloomthorn Bramble outside.</p><p>Since this transaction wasn't directly achieved, Revered Chongtai said, "Please welcome the next one," and moved a new bamboo pavilion over.</p><p>The transaction continued.</p><p>Next.</p><p>One bamboo pavilion after another was moved up in turn.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, before the Trading Convention had reached its halfway point, he had already seen three spiritual materials suitable for reforging the Gold Submergence Sword, namely a piece of Azure Dot Gold, a clump of絮状  Cloud Crystal, and two drops of Celestial Crown Heavy Liquid, not counting the ones that had already been traded.</p><p>Exchanging for one or two of these, plus the Fallen Phoenix Jade.</p><p>With Qin Sang's attainments in the Dao of Crafting, he could barely raise the Gold Submergence Sword to the level of a Top-grade Magical Treasure.</p><p>Different spiritual materials would impart different characteristics to the Gold Submergence Sword.</p><p>However, Qin Sang only wanted to improve the grade of the Gold Submergence Sword as soon as possible, and his other requirements weren't too harsh. Some spiritual materials with similar characteristics could be used.</p><p>The Gold Submergence Sword was only a substitute for the Wandering Cloud Sword, mainly used to cast Sword Escape and the Seven Souls Killing Array. Only if the grade was sufficient could the full power of the Sword Array be unleashed.</p><p>This was why several spiritual materials were suitable; otherwise, he would have to search hard for a while.</p><p>But Qin Sang wasn't in a hurry to participate in the transaction. He watched the rare treasures with great interest, feeling that today was truly an eye-opening experience and worth the trip.</p><p>There were a few among them that he was quite tempted by.</p><p>Unfortunately, compared to other Nascent Souls, Qin Sang's cultivation time was too short, and his accumulation was insufficient. The treasures he had obtained from several opportunities couldn't be taken out for trade. He could only prioritize satisfying the most urgent needs.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was carefully calculating, he suddenly heard the owner of the central bamboo pavilion say, "Seeking a cultivation method or secret art to enhance divine consciousness. I can exchange for Gold- and Wood-attribute orthodox Xuanmen cultivation methods. Other conditions can also be discussed if there are any."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's mind stirred slightly.</p><p>The divine ability to cultivate divine consciousness; wasn't that the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*?</p><p>There was no need for a complete secret art. Just taking out the first layer would attract many people like moths to a flame. In this day and age, it was normal for such secret arts to be incomplete.</p><p>Qin Sang also didn't need to worry that the other party would become a threat to him after cultivation.</p><p>As for the outflow of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* leading Old Demon Hun to associate it with the Nine Nether Fiend Fire that contended for treasure with him in the Buddha Palace, Qin Sang wasn't afraid.</p><p>The several treasures that this person had traded for earlier indicated that he was a Daoist Xuan cultivator.</p><p>After the Myriad Demon Assembly ended and he left Demon Hun Island, even if Old Demon Hun discovered something, there was nothing to worry about.</p><p>The problem was that this secret art had two major limitations.</p><p>First, one must first find a powerful spirit fire. Second, cultivation required coordination with the Transparent Lotus Seed, unless the other party also had a treasure like Jade Buddha, which could avoid danger.</p><p>Qin Sang had condensed fire seeds several times, and in the end, he didn't use the Transparent Lotus Seed, storing it in the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>But Qin Sang wouldn't sell the Transparent Lotus Seed to others.</p><p>He had just broken through to the second layer of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, and his understanding of this divine ability was still very superficial. If the Transparent Lotus Seed not only helped to condense the fire seed, he would be crying later.</p><p>Without the Transparent Lotus Seed, the value of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* would be greatly reduced.</p>
