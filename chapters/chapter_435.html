Chapter 428: The Trading Fair


The cultivators from the Xiao Han region lacked strong fighting spirit, missing the best chance to pursue the Tianxing League cultivators. After a brief, haphazard exchange of blows, they separated.


Without using magical treasures, Qin Sang's strength would be greatly reduced, leaving him no choice but to let the Tianxing League cultivators escape.


Qin Sang joined up with the Xiao Han region cultivators, verifying their identities.  He learned they weren't actually assigned together on a mission; they were attending a secret trading fair.


Unexpectedly, after the fair ended, they were spotted by Tianxing League cultivators who had infiltrated the event, leading to the fight.


That explained the lackluster battle.


Fortunately, they were still relatively close to the fair's location and hadn't scattered too much. Otherwise, they would have been picked off one by one by the Tianxing League and wouldn't have lasted this long.


Qin Sang knew that with so many cultivators gathering in the Yun Cang Marshes, secret trading fairs were inevitable. However, he had been in seclusion cultivating and hadn't had the time to seek them out.


This opportunity was too good to pass up, so Qin Sang immediately asked for information.


The secret trading fair wasn't large, and after its exposure, that location was no longer safe. The cultivators were shaken and didn't plan to hold another fair anytime soon.  However, Qin Sang learned of another fair's location from one of them.


This new trading fair was extremely well-hidden, opening every three months and requiring a token for entry.  It was quite large and a real melting pot, with righteous and demonic cultivators, and loose cultivators alikeâ€”mostly Foundation Establishment cultivators.  You could find many good items there.


The cultivator thanked Qin Sang for his help and gave him his token.  After verifying its authenticity, Qin Sang frequently visited the fair, occasionally finding desirable items.


Tomorrow is another trading fair day.


Qin Sang emerged from seclusion, his aura even calmer than two years ago.


After instructing Jie Ying to watch over the medicinal garden, Qin Sang flew out from the protective formation.  He checked his bearings, concealed his presence, and quietly flew toward the southwest waters.


Through contacts at the trading fair, Qin Sang gained a general understanding of the latest developments in the Xiao Han region and the Tianxing League.


Currently, battles are occurring in the Yun Cang Marshes and southern Tian Duan Mountains, but there are no signs of major conflicts. Both sides are exercising restraint, and the strongest cultivators in these battles are only at the False Core stage. There have been no reports of Golden Core stage masters participating.


However, it's rumored that numerous Golden Core cultivators from various sects have arrived in the Yun Cang Marshes. They're secretly controlling the situation, their authority widely recognized by the major sects.


They can freely conscript disciples from various sects, and anyone who disobeys will be accused of treason.


Many disciples from Shao Hua Mountain have been conscripted.


This type of conflict isn't new; it seems to follow a set pattern.


The most common actions are infiltrating enemy territory to sabotage spirit stone mines, medicinal gardens, and other important locations, or assassinating lone cultivators, effectively muddying the waters of the Yun Cang Marshes.


Only a few smaller sects have been unintentionally affected.


Whether infiltrating the Tianxing League or patrolling the border, casualties are unavoidable.  Compared to that, Qin Sang considered his assignment a relatively easy one.


Seeing that a true large-scale conflict won't break out soon, Qin Sang relaxed, waiting for the medicinal herbs in the garden to mature before deciding his next move, fulfilling the task assigned by Qi Yuan Shou.


It's best to avoid the heart of the conflict.


While stronger than cultivators of his realm, he can't reveal his magical treasures. If he gets caught in a large battle, the unpredictable situation would make even his treasures no guarantee of safety.


Fortunately, with Qi Yuan Shou as his backing, he doesn't have to worry about being used as cannon fodder.


Qin Sang flew low over the water, at a slow speed, taking a full day to reach the vicinity of the trading fair.


The terrain in this area was peculiar. A vast expanse contained countless large and small stone islands, scattered like stars. Unfortunately, the spiritual energy here was extremely thin, and the underground spiritual veins were barren, unsuitable for building caves.


However, these desolate stone islands were perfect hiding places for a trading fair.


Qin Sang flickered, landing on a barren island. After observing for a while, he took out a jade compass from his storage pouch; it contained a drop of crimson liquid.


The moment Qin Sang took out the compass and touched the blood droplet with his spiritual energy, the droplet seemed to be pulled by some force, gradually thinning into the shape of a needle. No matter how Qin Sang rotated the compass, it always pointed in one direction.


Holding the compass, Qin Sang flickered and flew towards the direction indicated by the blood needle.


As Qin Sang flew, the needle gradually shortened, finally returning to a droplet shape.  Qin Sang was directly above a small island, only a few dozen feet across. The whole island was composed of stones, devoid of plants.  Erosion from the lake had caused the stones to become covered in moss, with their base dyed greenish-black.


Qin Sang found no trace of any magical barriers on the island, but upon closer inspection, he noticed something amiss with a certain stone.

It was a mundane mechanism.

Such mechanisms are easily detected by a cultivator's spiritual sense, yet here, it proved far more effective at concealment than any barrier.

Qin Sang stopped before the stone, pressing his hand in a specific spot.  A 'click-click' sound echoed as the stone split open, revealing a staircase descending into darkness.

Reaching the bottom, Qin Sang found himself before a pitch-black space. Suddenly, a sharp voice called out, "Who's there!"

"Ahem!"

Qin Sang, now cloaked, cleared his throat, affecting a raspy voice.  "Participant of the trading assembly. This is my token."

He raised a compass.

Moments later, Qin Sang sensed the fluctuation of a spirit array. A cultivator wearing a tiger-head mask emerged, nodding slightly and gesturing. "Friend, please enter!"

No more was said.

Knowing their temperament, Qin Sang remained silent, entering the darkness.  A flash of light later, he found himself in a stone chamber.

Exiting the chamber, he entered a large hall. It was crude, clearly hastily fashioned with magic.

The trading assembly lasted only a day, changing locations each time.

Dozens of cultivators were already gathered, most squatting on the ground, haggling like ordinary people.

This assembly was quite famous in the area, and more people would arrive.  At least a hundred cultivators attended each gathering.

The hall had no visible exit.  Many identical stone chambers lined the perimeter, sealed with barriers; discreet transactions took place within.  A second level existed below.

Qin Sang's appearance drew attention; some looked at him expectantly.

However, Qin Sang wasn't there to trade.  A quick glance revealed nothing of interest, so he chose a chamber and entered.
