<h1>Chapter 1458: Nine Nether Returns to Yin (4k, two-in-one)</h1><p>玄天宫竟然有灵宝！</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace actually possesses a spiritual treasure!</p><p>秦桑想起虚灵派的剑胚，以及自己的云游剑。</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the sword embryo of the Xu Ling Sect, and his own Yunyou Sword.</p><p>虚灵派和玄天宫的底蕴差距不可以道里计，从祖师开始，历代图谋，直至冰晗，才有机会将山中之山孕育的火玉炼制成剑胚。</p><p>The difference in foundation between the Xu Ling Sect and Xuan Tian Palace is immeasurable. From their founding ancestor onwards, through generations of scheming, it was only with Bing Han that they had the opportunity to refine the fiery jade nurtured within the “mountain within a mountain” into a sword embryo.</p><p>最终能否孕生灵性，进阶灵宝，整个过程需要多长时间，还是未定之数。</p><p>Whether it would ultimately develop sentience and advance to become a spiritual treasure, and how long the entire process would take, remained unknown.</p><p>云游剑先后熔炼了无间血桑、养魂木和清福正竹真灵，作为秦桑的本命灵剑，已经在元神温养数十年，仍未出现蜕变的迹象。</p><p>The Yunyou Sword had successively refined the essence of the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry, the Soul-Nurturing Wood, and the Qing Fu Zheng Bamboo. As Qin Sang’s lifebound sword, it had been nurtured by his primordial spirit for decades, yet still showed no signs of transformation.</p><p>时间遥遥无期。</p><p>The time was indefinitely long.</p><p>悲观一点儿，秦桑甚至不知是自己先面临化神瓶颈，还是云游剑先进阶灵宝。</p><p>Pessimistically, Qin Sang wasn't even sure whether he would first face the tribulation to become a Nascent Divinity cultivator, or if his Yunyou Sword would first advance to a spiritual treasure.</p><p>由此可见，元婴修士炼制一件灵宝的难度有多大。</p><p>This shows just how difficult it is for a Yuan Ying cultivator to refine a spiritual treasure.</p><p>那位大长老只有元婴中期，基本可以肯定，灵宝不是他亲手炼制的，而是玄天宫的传承灵宝。</p><p>That Grand Elder was only at the mid-Yuan Ying stage.  It was almost certain that the spiritual treasure wasn't personally refined by him, but rather a heritage treasure of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>秦桑不了解玄天宫的门规，不知为何将传承灵宝交给大长老而非宫主执掌。</p><p>Qin Sang didn't understand the rules of Xuan Tian Palace, and didn't know why the heritage treasure was entrusted to the Grand Elder rather than the Palace Master.</p><p>“那件灵宝有什么神通？”</p><p>“What abilities does that spiritual treasure possess?”</p><p>秦桑若有所思的问道。</p><p>Qin Sang asked thoughtfully.</p><p>他在梳理自己身上的宝物。</p><p>He was reviewing his own treasures.</p><p>云游剑暂时是指望不上了。</p><p>The Yunyou Sword was not a reliable option for now.</p><p>太阳神树变化喜人，尤其在他神识化形之后，秦桑发现自己也能施加一些影响，花蕾的火焰之力聚合速度似乎变快了，颜色愈发深邃，可以期待。</p><p>The Sun God Tree was changing remarkably. Especially after his divine sense took physical form, Qin Sang found he could exert some influence. The speed at which the flame power of the buds coalesced seemed to have increased, their color growing deeper and more profound. It was something to look forward to.</p><p>南明离火的威力和位格毋庸置疑。</p><p>The power and status of the Nan Ming Li Fire were unquestionable.</p><p>但和魔幡中封印的魔火一样，秦桑只能御使太阳神鸟，蕴含的仅仅是南明离火的一部分力量。</p><p>But like the demonic fire sealed within the demonic banner, Qin Sang could only control the Sun God Bird, which contained only a portion of the Nan Ming Li Fire’s power.</p><p>太阳神鸟成型后，威力有多强，能否达到灵宝层次，还要打一个大大的问号。</p><p>After the Sun God Bird was fully formed, how powerful it would be, and whether it could reach the level of a spiritual treasure, remained a big question mark.</p><p>能够大概做出评估的，只有魔幡和九幽魔火。</p><p>Only the demonic banner and the Nine Nether Demonic Fire could be roughly assessed.</p><p>十八魔幡胜过极品法宝，是以秦桑御使魔幡和混魔老人交手时不落下风。</p><p>The eighteen demonic banners surpassed top-grade magical artifacts, which is why Qin Sang was not at a disadvantage when he used them to fight the Hun Mo Old Man.</p><p>不过，九幽魔火本体被封印在魔幡之中，这还不是真正的威力。等他用《火种金莲》将所有魔火炼化，即使经过精炼，有所损失，应该是一门不弱于灵宝的神通。</p><p>However, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire's true form was sealed within the demonic banners, so this was not its full power. Once he refined all the demonic fire using the “Fire Seed Golden Lotus”, even after refining and experiencing some loss, it should become an ability no weaker than a spiritual treasure.</p><p>但这需要时间，不可能一蹴而就。</p><p>But this would take time, and couldn't be accomplished overnight.</p><p>仔细想来，在凝聚出太阳神鸟前，他还真没有太好的手段应对灵宝。</p><p>Thinking carefully, before he condensed the Sun God Bird, he really didn't have any good methods to deal with spiritual treasures.</p><p>秦桑在心里飞快过了一遍，却见琉璃看着他，一言不发。</p><p>Qin Sang quickly reviewed his options in his mind, but saw Liuli looking at him silently.</p><p>见状，秦桑心中恍然。</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang suddenly understood.</p><p>琉璃毕竟出身玄天宫，不可能把自家师门的秘密都抖落出来。这句提醒已经足够，以后遇到玄天宫大长老时多加警惕。</p><p>Liuli, after all, came from Xuan Tian Palace. She couldn't possibly reveal all her sect's secrets. This warning was sufficient; he would be more vigilant when encountering the Xuan Tian Palace Grand Elder in the future.</p><p>秦桑想了想，笑道：“辛苦仙子煞费苦心，晓以利害。我已经明白，霸占圣物弊大于利。不知玄天宫打算付出多大的代价，换回圣物？”</p><p>Qin Sang thought for a moment, then smiled. “Thank you, Fairy, for your painstaking efforts in explaining the risks and benefits. I understand now that seizing the sacred object has more disadvantages than advantages. I wonder what price Xuan Tian Palace intends to pay to retrieve the sacred object?”</p><p>“你想要什么？”</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>琉璃反问。</p><p>Liuli asked in return.</p><p>她对秦桑的要求并不意外，也很清楚，她和秦桑明面上恩怨已清，不可能要求秦桑白白还回圣物。</p><p>She wasn't surprised by Qin Sang's request. She was also clear that their surface grievances were settled, and she couldn't ask Qin Sang to return the sacred object for nothing.</p><p>直到现在，琉璃心情依旧无比复杂，只是没有表现出来，从师父失踪，独自寄身少华山，她就习惯了压抑自己的情绪。</p><p>Even now, Liuli's feelings were incredibly complex, though she didn't show it. Ever since her master disappeared and she had lived alone on Shao Hua Mountain, she had become accustomed to suppressing her emotions.</p><p>一方面是邪功后患至今仍未清除。</p><p>On the one hand, the lingering consequences of the heretical cultivation technique still hadn't been eliminated.</p><p>师雪之言，贴近部分事实。</p><p>Shi Xue’s words were partially true.</p><p>当年，琉璃离开北辰境返回玄天宫，修炼冰魄神光，就是想借冰魄封情，摆脱邪功带来的影响。</p><p>Years ago, Liuli had left Bei Chen territory and returned to Xuan Tian Palace to cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light, hoping to use the ice soul to suppress her feelings and escape the influence of the heretical technique.</p><p>银针锁情、冰魄封情。</p><p>Silver needle to lock feelings, ice soul to seal feelings.</p><p>自始自终，她都在依靠自己的力量，努力寻找解决之道。</p><p>From beginning to end, she had relied on her own strength, striving to find a solution.</p><p>她认为，这是自己选择邪功必然付出的代价，和秦桑无关，不想牵连别人，所以从未被东阳伯蛊惑，修炼所谓的石桥禅。</p><p>She believed this was the inevitable price for choosing the heretical technique, and had nothing to do with Qin Sang. She didn't want to involve others, so she had never been swayed by Dong Yang Bo to cultivate the so-called Stone Bridge Zen.</p><p>可当秦桑真正出现在面前，她才惊觉，邪功的影响竟如此之深！</p><p>But when Qin Sang truly appeared before her, she was shocked to realize how profound the influence of the heretical technique was!</p><p>另一个方面，是在看到秦桑后，不由自主想起在少华山的经历。</p><p>On the other hand, upon seeing Qin Sang, she involuntarily recalled her experiences on Shao Hua Mountain.</p><p>当年他如蝼蚁一般，自己一个指头就能碾死。如今修为却已经反超自己，成长为让玄天宫忌惮的顶尖强者，不得不压下其他想法，寻求交易。</p><p>Back then, he was like an ant; she could crush him with a single finger. Now, his cultivation had surpassed hers, and he had grown into a top-tier expert that Xuan Tian Palace feared, forcing her to suppress other thoughts and seek a transaction.</p><p>五行灵根。</p><p>Five-element spiritual roots.</p><p>卖身筑基。</p><p>Selling oneself for foundation establishment.</p><p>修炼元神养剑，切割神魂的功法。</p><p>Cultivating primordial spirit to nurture a sword; a technique to sever the soul.</p><p>先后服用坎离金丹，雪灵莲和鸢尾花，两次结丹失败，让东阳伯都无奈了，费尽心机才找了个合理的借口，把秦桑带进青铜殿。</p><p>He had successively consumed Kan Li Golden Pills, Snow Spirit Lotuses, and Iris Flowers, failing twice in his attempts at forming golden cores.  Even Dong Yang Bo was helpless, and only with great effort did he find a reasonable excuse to bring Qin Sang into the Bronze Hall.</p><p>Leaving the Purple Micro Palace, she searched everywhere for Qin Sang, wanting to tell him not to worry about his feud with Dongyang Bo, to focus on his cultivation, and that she would take full responsibility.</p><p>During this process, she learned about some of Qin Sang's deeds, shocked by his tireless efforts and numerous hardships in pursuit of the Dao.</p><p>She believed this was not the whole story.</p><p>It was hard to imagine what this person had gone through after being framed by his ancestor and abandoned by his sect.</p><p>How did he form his Golden Core? How did he condense his Nascent Soul? How did he reach where he is today, step by step?</p><p>Compared to Qin Sang, she was undoubtedly a prodigy. Her efforts and difficulties in saving her master were insignificant.</p><p>At least, she had the ability to find and try various ways to solve problems, while Qin Sang could only grasp at every straw, relying on sheer resilience and perseverance to climb his way up.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't guess that this icy fairy had so many thoughts.</p><p>He pondered silently.  His primary goal was the Central Plains sea chart; other conditions could be negotiated.  Hearing that the sacred artifact was the key to the sacred land gave him a new idea.</p><p>He left the North Star Realm, originally traveling to find other fragments of the Killing Sword.</p><p>Upon arriving in the North Sea, however, he hadn't heard of any ancient secret realms or ruins. The Pure Ocean Sect was merely a powerful, relatively recent Buddhist sect.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace sacred land sounded mysterious, perhaps he could find something there.</p><p>Qin Sang proposed observing the ceremony in the sacred land and asked, "Can Xuan Tian Palace agree to this condition?"</p><p>He understood the importance of the sacred land to a sect; it was generally impossible for outsiders to enter.  But now that he held the key, it was all or nothing.</p><p>Liuli was startled, clearly not expecting such a request.  She was silent for a long time. "There's no precedent."</p><p>After a pause, she said, "I'll ask the Grand Elder."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, thought for a moment, and said carefully, "My path is completely different from that of your Xuan Tian Palace.  The secrets of the sacred land hold no appeal to me; I won't do anything harmful to others or myself. I mainly want to broaden my horizons, and the opportunity to observe the ceremony from the outskirts of the sacred land will suffice. If you are not at ease, I can take a soul oath."</p><p>Entering the sacred land would allow him to sense the Killing Sword fragments through the sword spirit.</p><p>If there were indeed Killing Sword fragments in the sacred land, Xuan Tian Palace wouldn't be able to stop him; he would find a way to obtain them, though a peaceful resolution would be preferable.</p><p>Liuli nodded noncommittally.</p><p>She continued to look at Qin Sang, knowing there would be more conditions.</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared his next request, "I also need the sea chart to the Central Plains."</p><p>"Central Plains?"</p><p>Liuli's eyes showed confusion.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  He hurriedly asked, "Haven't you heard of the Central Plains?"</p><p>Liuli nodded, sincerely saying, "I don't know."</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Given Liuli's status and strength, her position in Xuan Tian Palace certainly wouldn't be low. She should have access to most secrets, yet she didn't know about the Central Plains!</p><p>Even if she didn't have clearance to view the sea chart, her mysterious master should have mentioned it.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly realized something.</p><p>He had heard that the Ghost Mother infiltrated Xuan Tian Palace, assuming that they definitely had a sea chart to the Central Plains.</p><p>Could it be that the Ghost Mother was only guessing?  After infiltrating, finding that Xuan Tian Palace didn't have it, she ventured into the Pure Ocean Sect?</p><p>This was unexpected to Qin Sang.</p><p>As the largest sect in the North Sea, if Xuan Tian Palace didn't have the sea chart, where could he find it? The Pure Ocean Sect's chart had been taken by the Ghost Mother.  He would have to visit a sect older than Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't explain, "Tell the Grand Elder exactly what I said; she should understand."</p><p>Liuli asked no more questions and silently made a note.</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.  He had almost gathered the materials for the Golden Sinking Sword, needing only two more spiritual objects for the Ascension Ceremony, but he could obtain them from the Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>It seemed he didn't have any urgent needs.</p><p>If possible, Qin Sang would prefer to enter Xuan Tian Palace's treasury and choose himself.</p><p>Liuli remained quiet and showed no impatience.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something, "Does Xuan Tian Palace possess any orthodox Xuanmen techniques for cultivating external avatars?"</p><p>Almost every Nascent Soul cultivator considered cultivating an external avatar or a second Nascent Soul, but such techniques were extremely rare.</p><p>Moreover, most originated from heretical paths, harming Heaven's harmony and leading to countless troubles. While orthodox Xuanmen techniques had fewer hidden dangers, the requirements were extremely strict, and very few succeeded in cultivation.</p><p>Liuli wasn't surprised by this request.</p><p>Her gaze softened, as if she was reminiscing.</p><p>After a moment, Liuli recalled a technique that met Qin Sang's requirements.  To Qin Sang's delight, she nodded, "Yes! The Nine Nether Returning Yin Chapter!"</p><p>"Nine Nether Returning Yin..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the name, unable to deduce anything from it.</p><p>Liuli pondered for a moment, then said, “The Nine Nether Yin Jade Scripture is extremely difficult to cultivate. It has three requirements. First, one must possess a powerful spirit and consciousness; otherwise, the latter two steps will be difficult to succeed.”</p><p>She paused, glancing at Qin Sang, clearly indicating that Qin Sang didn't need to worry about this.</p><p>“Second, a unique spiritual body must be refined using a special method and nurtured in the earth's Yin veins for eighty-one days.  Using a beast corpse can be a shortcut, but as far as I know, only a few special types of humanoid demonic creatures meet the requirements, making them extremely rare in the present world. Third, the spiritual body's foundation must be built using rare treasures of the ice-cold Dao, only then can it be refined into an external avatar.”</p><p>Truly demanding!</p><p>After Liuli finished explaining all the requirements, Qin Sang silently sighed.</p><p>The current cultivation world is barren, making it practically impossible to independently refine a spiritual body. Those few substitute demonic beasts are extinct in the North Sea; perhaps there's a chance to find them in the Demon Sea, but there's no way to return.</p><p>“Bai once mentioned that the Dao Manifestation Tree is a natural treasure, far superior to any artificially refined spiritual body. But the Dao Manifestation Tree is inherently pure; it has been corrupted.  Can it still be used to cultivate the Nine Nether Yin Avatar technique? This secret technique clearly belongs to the ice-cold Dao and is quite extreme…”</p><p>Qin Sang was uncertain.</p><p>Even with the secret technique, it's impossible to confirm its feasibility without trying.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet's potential is basically exhausted.</p><p>Approaching mid-Nascent Soul stage, it's gradually unable to keep up with his pace. An external avatar is necessary.  I just don't know if the Dao Manifestation Tree can handle it.</p><p>As for the rare treasures of the ice-cold Dao, Qin Sang wasn't worried; the Xuan Tian Palace certainly has them.</p><p>“What abilities does an external avatar possess, and what are its hidden dangers?”</p><p>Qin Sang cautiously asked in detail.</p><p>Liuli had clearly considered refining an external avatar and was very familiar with the secret technique. “Once the external avatar is refined, it can use several abilities of the ice-cold Dao, wield magic treasures, and possesses considerable combat power. However, it won't independently condense a second Nascent Soul; instead, it will condense a phantom Nascent Soul. Compared to demonic blood infant and demonic infant techniques, the chance of backlash to the main body is very small.”</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently, wondering about the nature of this phantom.</p><p>“After the main body perishes, as long as the distance between the main body and the external avatar is not too far, resurrection is possible through the external avatar; the phantom Nascent Soul will solidify and transform into the main body.”</p><p>When she mentioned this, a glimmer of anticipation flashed in Liuli's eyes.</p><p>This is essentially a second life; who wouldn't be tempted?</p><p>“Truly a top-tier Xuanmen secret technique!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Even he couldn't guarantee smooth sailing; the chance of resurrection was very attractive.</p><p>But he wasn't blinded by it. “There must be some hidden dangers, right?”</p><p>“Absolutely!”</p><p>Liuli nodded. “After all, the spiritual body isn't the true body; there's bound to be a disconnect and various incompatibilities. Also, after resurrection, one can only cultivate techniques of the ice-cold Dao.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded along.</p><p>These hidden dangers were far less than he anticipated; compared to the miraculous resurrection ability, they were insignificant.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang remain silent for a long time, appearing quite moved, Liuli hesitated before saying, “Sect rules prevent me from transmitting the technique to you. But if you can refine a spiritual body, I can give you the most suitable rare treasure.  The stability of the foundation is crucial to the future potential of the external avatar.”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised that she would offer a rare treasure, realizing she must have ulterior motives.</p><p>After staring at Liuli for a moment, Qin Sang asked, “Which rare treasure is best?”</p><p>“The Xuan Tian Palace treasures a Kan Shen Pearl suitable for cultivating the Nine Nether Yin Jade Scripture.  Because it’s rare and can assist in cultivating another technique, one needs to accomplish great feats to obtain it. However, the Kan Shen Pearl's effect is inferior to another.”</p><p>Liuli slowly uttered four words, “Ice Soul Divine Gang!”</p><p>Following the Qingyang Divine Gang of the Qingyang Demon Sect and the Pure Yang Divine Gang of the Pure Yang Sect, this was the third Heaven-Opening Divine Gang Qin Sang had heard of.</p><p>He knew how rare Heaven-Opening Divine Gangs were.  First, a Heaven-Opening Divine Gang must descend, and under various fortuitous circumstances, condense into a divine essence in the form of a divine jade and exist for a long time.</p><p>Liuli actually possessed Ice Soul Divine Gang!</p><p>“The Ice Soul Divine Gang is an extremely cold object, but its power is too violent and lacks gentleness, making it difficult to control. However, with your strong consciousness, you should be able to manage it with difficulty.”</p><p>After a pause, Liuli added, “This doesn’t prevent you from asking the Xuan Tian Palace for the Kan Shen Pearl. Even though it’s precious, the Grand Elder won’t be stingy. Refining it into the external avatar can greatly enhance its power.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect you, fairy, to possess such a treasure!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, then got straight to the point. “I can’t accept such a gift without reciprocation. What can I do for you?”</p>
