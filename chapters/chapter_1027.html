<h1>Chapter 1119: The Glacial Plains</h1><p>Sword light blazed, transforming into a whirling blade that slashed at the puppet beast!</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated his spirit sword, locked in combat with the puppet beast.</p><p>Encircled by the puppet beasts, Qin Sang's senses were completely blocked by the dense sword energy.</p><p>He carefully observed the sword momentum contained within the puppet sword formation, while simultaneously attacking with all his might, forcing the formation to reveal its true power. He then summoned the Skyeye Butterfly to analyze and deconstruct the formation.</p><p>Fully comprehending the formation within such a short timeframe was impossible. However, he memorized as many of its changes as he could, intending to integrate them into his whirling sword technique later.</p><p>The puppet sword formation was incredibly powerful.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the creator of these puppets possessed exceptional swordsmanship, seamlessly integrating a complete sword formation into their creations.</p><p>After a short while.</p><p>The boundless sword light suddenly dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his sword, feeling a sense of unfulfillment.</p><p>He wondered what kind of power the Seven Kills Hall wielded at its peak.</p><p>The Sword Path and the puppet sword formations were invaluable teachers for any sword cultivator.</p><p>Cultivating in such an environment would greatly accelerate one's progress in the way of the sword. At the very least, comprehending sword momentum would be no difficult feat. It was truly a sacred ground for sword cultivators.</p><p>Bai, who had been standing in the corner, approached Qin Sang and requested a blank jade slip. Moments later, he returned the slip.</p><p>"This contains my understanding of the sword formation from observing your battle. With your insights from within and mine from without, we've managed to grasp the complete picture of the formation. By combining our knowledge, we should be able to reconstruct a large portion of it. This puppet sword formation is quite unique; it feels like a simplified version of some high-level formation. Deciphering it could yield significant benefits."</p><p>Qin Sang accepted the jade slip, his face lighting up with joy. He thanked Bai and put the slip away.</p><p>Now wasn't the time to study the formation.</p><p>Bai glanced around and pointed towards the back. "That should be the entrance to the next trial. You mentioned earlier that the Soul Cleansing Liquid is beneficial to the spirit. Perhaps it could also help me… Would you…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes gleamed. Before Bai could finish, he immediately and unhesitatingly agreed.</p><p>Bai's advancement to the Corpse King realm would be a tremendous asset to Qin Sang. If there was a chance to obtain a second portion of the Soul Cleansing Liquid, he would strive for it with all his might.</p><p>After the puppet beasts vanished, two doors appeared on either side of the hall.</p><p>Clearly, one led to the next trial, and the other back to the entrance of the inner hall.</p><p>Bai returned to the Corpse Puppet Pouch.</p><p>Qin Sang strode towards the next trial. The moment he stepped through the door, the familiar sensation returned – darkness descended.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang found himself standing amidst a vast icy plain.</p><p>"The Glacial Plains?"</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, a world of shimmering ice.</p><p>"Indeed, the Glacial Plains. This trial is rather straightforward. One needs to constantly circulate true essence to ward off the intense cold and be wary of the occasional attacks from ferocious beasts. Other than that, there shouldn't be too much danger."</p><p>A chilling wind howled. Qin Sang raised his hands, and a thin layer of ice instantly spread from his fingertips.</p><p>The cold was piercing.</p><p>"The further one goes, the colder it gets. Ordinary cultivators with fragile bodies would expend a significant amount of true essence just to resist the cold. If their reserves are depleted, they'll be in grave danger if attacked by a beast. However, this cold is nothing to me."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, his tone brimming with confidence.</p><p>A flash of azure light enveloped him as a pair of wings sprouted from his back. He had activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation.</p><p>With the transformation active, the Glacial Plains' cold posed no threat to him.</p><p>Qin Sang assessed his condition, a smile spreading across his face as he looked ahead.</p><p>"It's said that certain areas within the Glacial Plains harbor rare and precious spirit herbs that are hard to find in the outside world. Other trials also have similar hidden treasures, waiting to be discovered by those with good fortune. Not all participants are solely focused on the final reward; many come seeking these opportunities. With my physical resilience, I could stay here indefinitely and search for all the spirit herbs. However, that would waste too much time, causing me to miss the Soul Cleansing Liquid."</p><p>These thoughts flashed through Qin Sang's mind. With a beat of his phoenix wings, he flew swiftly across the icy surface.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly was also using its Skyeye ability to scout the area beneath the ice.</p><p>Most of the beasts emerged from below.</p><p>Sure enough.</p><p>Not long after he set off, the ice ahead suddenly cracked, and a white flash shot out, hurtling towards him. It was an ice python, no thicker than a man's arm.</p><p>A putrid wind washed over him.</p><p>The ice python opened its jaws, revealing its fangs, its ferocity evident.</p><p>Suddenly, sword light flashed.</p><p>The ice python instinctively sensed danger, but it was too late to escape.</p><p>The Ebony Sword, swift as lightning, pierced the python's mouth, silencing its hiss.  It then effortlessly cleaved the python's body in two from head to tail.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Withdrawing his sword light, Qin Sang didn't even glance at the python's corpse as he flew past.</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere on the Glacial Plains.</p><p>A young man's figure materialized out of thin air. His face, initially pale, suddenly lit up with delight upon seeing the icy expanse. "The second trial is the Glacial Plains! Excellent!"</p><p>The young man was only at the Core Formation mid-stage. He had barely managed to pass the first trial's puppet battle, using every means at his disposal. He hadn't expected much from this trial, but surprisingly, the second trial was one of his objectives.</p><p>"Ghost Orchid, here I come!"</p><p>The young man licked his lips, formed hand seals, and his true essence surged. A fiery robe materialized around his body, a type of cold-resisting technique.</p><p>At the same time, he produced a peculiar red crystal that radiated warmth, another treasure to ward off the cold.</p><p>The young man was clearly well-prepared.</p><p>He glanced around, chose a direction, and swiftly flew off.</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere else on the Glacial Plains.</p><p>There was a large hole in the ice.</p><p>Beside the shattered ice lay two ice lizards, their crystalline bodies motionless on the icy surface. Beneath them was a pool of frozen blue blood. They were dead.</p><p>Standing beside the corpses of the two ice lizards was a young woman, Su Nu.</p><p>The ice lizards were her handiwork.</p><p>Despite having slain the two beasts, Su Nu bore no visible injuries.</p><p>She wore a high-quality red robe that repelled the cold, keeping her warm amidst the icy landscape.</p><p>Su Nu looked towards the edge of the plains, but didn't rush to leave. She held a black token in her hand, her expression contemplative.</p><p>After a while.</p><p>Su Nu gritted her teeth, seemingly having made a difficult decision. She lightly patted her storage pouch.</p><p>'Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…'</p><p>Several streaks of light flew out, revealing identical jade bracelets.</p><p>Gazing at the bracelets, Su Nu muttered an incantation.</p><p>Moments later, the bracelets sank into the ice below. They were similarly translucent and, hidden within the icy terrain and amongst the remnants of battle, were completely undetectable to the naked eye.</p><p>Having planted the bracelets, a fierce glint flashed in Su Nu's eyes.  She suddenly raised her hand, true essence flickering, and struck her own chest with her palm.</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>Su Nu groaned, spitting out a mouthful of blood. The crimson stain was shockingly bright against the ice.</p><p>She had intentionally injured herself.</p><p>As if that wasn't enough, Su Nu further damaged several of her meridians, her face turning deathly pale.</p><p>Then, she retrieved a cushion, set up some warning restrictions around herself, and sat down, remaining there.</p>
