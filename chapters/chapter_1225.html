<h1>Chapter 1217: Revisiting the Proposal of Marriage</h1><p>The yellow sand outside the city had turned into quicksand, and the Serpent King emerged from the depths of the sandy sea.</p><p>"Have Fellow Daoist Lu and Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard not arrived yet?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept around, noticing only the Serpent King.</p><p>The Serpent King nodded, a hint of worry in his expression. "I arrived not long ago myself and have no news of the two fellow Daoists. When they charged out, they were bound to encounter obstacles..."</p><p>"The combined secret technique that Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard and Fellow Daoist Lu unleashed at the end was no small matter. If their goal was merely to preserve their lives, it shouldn't have been too difficult."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the aura Cold Lizard had revealed at the final moment and the immense power unleashed by the Snow Pearl. It was as if the cultivation of two individuals had been concentrated into one. If it were him, he too would have had to avoid their锋芒 like the old demon Ye.</p><p>Hearing the caution in Qin Sang's tone, the Serpent King's expression softened slightly, and he chuckled. "Bright Moon, do you know why Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard and Fellow Daoist Lu were able to merge their cultivation into one? In truth, Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard was once Fellow Daoist Lu's spirit beast. They spent every day together and had long since mastered several joint-attack secret techniques. It's just that Fellow Daoist Lu was severely injured and couldn't unleash them, otherwise the situation wouldn't have come to this. At the last moment, they had no choice but to use it, and the two fellow Daoists must have paid a heavy price..."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard was once a spirit beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned. He truly hadn't noticed.</p><p>"That was in the past. Fellow Daoist Lu has a gentle temperament. After Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard achieved human form, Fellow Daoist Lu voluntarily released the restraints on him and treated him as an equal. In fact, the opportunity for Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard to achieve human form was something Fellow Daoist Lu actively sought out for him. As a result, Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard harbors no resentment for having been enslaved. On the contrary, he is deeply grateful to Fellow Daoist Lu. If the situation had turned dire, Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard would have surely fought to the death to ensure Fellow Daoist Lu's escape..."</p><p>The Serpent King spoke of these hidden past events.</p><p>As a demon beast, he harbored deep hatred for the human practice of enslaving demon beasts, but his words revealed great admiration for the cultivator surnamed Lu.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a sense of respect as well.</p><p>Back then, the cultivator surnamed Lu was only at the early Nascent Soul stage. To have a spirit beast at the human transformation stage was equivalent to doubling his strength, yet he had let it go without hesitation.</p><p>It was worth noting that Cold Lizard had been subdued by the cultivator surnamed Lu during his Foundation Establishment stage and had never shown any resistance toward him.</p><p>Qin Sang admitted to himself that he would find it difficult to do the same.</p><p>Such detachment from worldly possessions was undoubtedly why the cultivator surnamed Lu had been able to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage and become one of the few top experts in the North Star Realm.</p><p>"Let's wait a little longer."</p><p>Qin Sang also wanted to meet this Fellow Daoist Lu. He turned to the Serpent King. "What about your injuries..."</p><p>The Serpent King gave a bitter smile. "I'm afraid it will take decades of quiet cultivation to recover. I hope Fellow Daoist Lu and the others managed to bring out that scale, otherwise this trip will have been a huge loss."</p><p>It was only then that Qin Sang learned from the Serpent King about their experiences.</p><p>After finding the entrance to the ancient demon's cave, they had expended tremendous effort to slowly break through the ancient restrictions. Just as the cultivator surnamed Lu had obtained a snake scale recording a secret technique and an ancient treasure, they were ambushed by the Serpent Spirit, alerting Jiang Chenzi and the others in the Blood Lake and triggering a disaster.</p><p>"Serpent King, what do you think of the old demon Ye and the Blood Lake?" Qin Sang changed the subject, sharing his own speculations.</p><p>"This was my first time facing the old demon Ye in battle. If he is truly a peak mid-Nascent Soul stage avatar as you say, then the strength he displayed is likely just the tip of the iceberg. His ambitions are far from small!"</p><p>The Serpent King's expression turned grave, his wariness of the old demon Ye deepening.</p><p>"As for the Blood Lake, I've never been to the Endless Valley, so I'm not very familiar with it. However, I can testify on your behalf before the Two Domains Alliance. The old demon Ye has been pursuing us for so long. Whatever he's planning, we can't let him succeed so easily!"</p><p>Seeing the Serpent King's咬牙切齿 expression, Qin Sang couldn't help but smile. "That's what I think as well."</p><p>They entered the cave dwelling the Serpent King had opened and waited for several days.</p><p>Suddenly, the Serpent King opened his eyes, his divine sense sweeping outward. He captured a small sand lizard wandering outside and brought it into the cave.</p><p>Strangely, as soon as the sand lizard entered the cave, it stopped struggling. Its eyes gradually turned a deep,幽蓝 blue.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, I'm relieved to see you've escaped danger."</p><p>The sand lizard's mouth opened and closed, emitting the voice of the cultivator surnamed Lu.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu!"</p><p>The Serpent King's face lit up with joy. "How are you and Fellow Daoist Cold Lizard?"</p><p>"Cold Lizard isn't doing well. To get me out, he self-destructed his magic treasure and nearly self-destructed himself. I managed to save his essence, and we'll find a way to restore him later. As for me, although my foundation isn't damaged, my injuries will take more than a year or two to heal. It's inconvenient for me to meet with you two fellow Daoists, so I can only use this little fellow to relay my message."</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Lu's tone was heavy, carrying a hint of apology.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Serpent King expressed their understanding.</p><p>Then, the sand lizard spat out a snake scale. "I'll keep that magic treasure on behalf of Cold Lizard. This scale records an ancient secret technique originating from the serpent race. It's most suited for Fellow Daoist Serpent King, but it doesn't strictly require serpent bloodline, so Fellow Daoist Bright Moon should also be able to cultivate it. Thank you, Fellow Daoist Bright Moon, for your assistance. This secret technique is a small token of my gratitude. Once Cold Lizard and I have recovered, we will surely visit to express our thanks in person."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't claim credit. "I merely happened to be in the right place at the right time."</p><p>After a few more words, the blue in the sand lizard's eyes faded, and it regained its own consciousness. It jumped out of the Serpent King's hand and scurried into the yellow sand.</p><p>The Serpent King eagerly pressed the scale to his forehead. After reading it, he passed it to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stand on ceremony either. After reading it, he discovered it was a secret technique related to bloodline power. Unless he could fully merge with the Qing Luan's blood essence in the future, he wouldn't be able to cultivate it.</p><p>However, he could bring it back to the Thousand Bamboo Sea. After all, neither the Serpent King nor the cultivator surnamed Lu had placed any restrictions on him passing the technique down to his descendants.</p><p>As for the white copper Qin Sang had seized, the cultivator surnamed Lu and the Serpent King didn't mention it at all.</p><p>"I've refined some pills to temporarily suppress my injuries. Let's head back."</p><p>The Serpent King suggested.</p><p>Qin Sang had no objections.</p><p>On the return journey, Qin Sang and the Serpent King didn't rush.</p><p>Relying on the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's ability to break through restrictions, they explored various secret realms and forbidden areas within the desert. With the two of them working together, there were few things that could threaten them.</p><p>If not for the Serpent King's injuries, they would have been even more肆无忌惮.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't find any fragments of the Slaughter Sword, but Fat Chicken reaped great benefits.</p><p>Although it had always followed Qin Sang closely, Qin Sang, being human, could offer limited guidance to a demon beast.</p><p>The Serpent King was different. With just a few words, he pointed out the true essence of demonic cultivation, greatly benefiting Fat Chicken. Combined with its previous积累, it finally had an epiphany and broke through to the late Demon Core stage, much to the Serpent King's surprise.</p><p>"This lad has good talent. No wonder you keep him by your side, Bright Moon. The Thousand Bamboo Sea truly produces outstanding talents... Is he married?"</p><p>Seeing the look in the Serpent King's eyes, Fat Chicken felt a chill run down its spine.</p><p>"Serpent King, you don't have a niece, do you?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself. Why was this old fellow so fond of playing matchmaker?</p><p>The Serpent King chuckled. "Not only do I have a niece, but I also have an unmarried daughter. Her cultivation is a bit low, though! But if this marriage were to happen, I can't let your Thousand Bamboo Sea take all the advantage. The young couple would have to come to my Mount Transformation."</p><p>"Children have their own fortunes..."</p><p>Qin Sang said indifferently.</p><p>Fat Chicken breathed a sigh of relief. The White Crane brothers were enough for political marriages.</p>
