<h1>Chapter 489: Hiding Place</h1><p>Chapter 489: Hiding Place</p><p>Piercing screams echoed in the distance.</p><p>The beast horde near the Stone Sea was roused, creating immediate chaos. Some huddled in their lairs, trembling; others fled with their families.</p><p>“Hold it!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t use any magical artifacts.  Using only the Ten Directions Yama Banner, he and the Flying Night Rakshasa beat the black dragon until it was disoriented.</p><p>At Qin Sang's command, the Flying Night Rakshasa vanished, reappearing instantly near the black dragon's head.  Its massive hand clamped down on the dragon’s head, smashing it against a rock.</p><p>The black dragon was pinned, unable to cry out, its body still struggling. Its long tail thrashed, attempting to sweep away the Flying Night Rakshasa, but it was easily dodged.</p><p>The black dragon’s breath was now extremely weak.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed forward, gripping the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, and pressed it precisely onto the black dragon’s forehead, channeling his spiritual energy to activate the talisman’s power.</p><p>The talisman adhered to the black dragon’s brow, radiating a brilliant light, like a flawlessly clear jade.</p><p>But to the black dragon, this jade was a death warrant. The talisman’s light felt like countless needles, inflicting terrible agony.</p><p>The black dragon’s body convulsed violently, but all resistance was futile.</p><p>Qin Sang focused all his attention on controlling the talisman.</p><p>Soon, the black dragon's struggle ceased. A mysterious, dark light emanated from its forehead, and then a dragon spirit, no bigger than a palm, was slowly extracted.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face lit up; he removed the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman.</p><p>A chain bound the dragon spirit, firmly restraining it.</p><p>It let out a desperate roar, but couldn’t break free. Pulled by the chain, it drifted slowly toward the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, ever closer.</p><p>The dragon spirit’s resistance intensified – this was the crucial step.  Qin Sang’s expression was serious; he used all his strength to activate the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman, slowly absorbing the dragon spirit.</p><p>The talisman's light flickered, the talisman trembled, the dragon spirit still struggling.</p><p>Finally, the talisman calmed.</p><p>“Whew!”</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, bringing the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman before him to examine.</p><p>He probed the talisman with his spiritual sense; the dragon spirit within was now subdued, docile. After absorbing two dragon spirits, the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman’s power had significantly increased.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction, storing the talisman within his body to nurture it. He turned his gaze to the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>After this battle, Qin Sang’s confidence in the Flying Night Rakshasa grew.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa placed the black dragon on a rock. Qin Sang personally butchered it. The dragon corpse was rare and valuable. With Qin Sang's skill in crafting artifacts, he could create several excellent high-grade artifacts using the corpse as the primary material, supplemented by others.</p><p>However, his standards had risen; he no longer cared much for high-grade artifacts.  This dragon corpse wasn’t enough to craft a treasure, so he wasn’t overly excited.</p><p>After butchering the corpse, storing the Flying Night Rakshasa and the煞尸 (sha shi) in his Corpse Puppet Bag, Qin Sang found a secluded spot to test the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot Talisman’s power, before swiftly leaving Wuyaya Valley and heading directly north toward Qingyang Market Town.</p><p>…</p><p>Hanshan City.</p><p>Hanshan Village would be a more fitting name.</p><p>Hanshan City is small, with a far smaller population than larger cities. It’s built on a hillside.</p><p>The city stands alone, untouched by war.  Behind it lie vast mountains; in front, a large river. The land is fertile, and the city lives peacefully, like a hidden paradise.</p><p>Fortunately, spiritual energy is exceptionally scarce in this area, and powerful demonic cultivators don't bother with it.</p><p>However, the city lord is actually a cultivator.  The city’s largest family, the city lord’s family, has remained here, ruling as local kings for generations.</p><p>This family’s surname is Ji.</p><p>Ji Wu is the eldest son of the current Ji family head.</p><p>On a mountaintop outside Hanshan City, Qin Sang stood amidst the trees, surveying the city.  Hanshan City’s walls are not high, but thick – sufficient to deter wild beasts.</p><p>The city’s inhabitants were bustling like ants.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze moved from the foot of the mountain to the middle, pausing momentarily at a particularly opulent palace, then continued upward.</p><p>His eyesight was excellent; he could see a small, winding path in the northern forest beyond Hanshan City. Qin Sang concealed his presence, carefully observing the path, quietly moving closer.</p><p>The path extended into the valley behind the mountain and disappeared. Qin Sang remained calm.  His gaze swept over the beautiful valley scenery, and he couldn't help but admire it inwardly.</p><p>The valley was filled with peach blossoms, a breathtaking expanse of vibrant pink and purple, like a magnificent carpet stretching as far as the eye could see.  Deep within the blossoms, a faint pink mist swirled, clinging to the air, refusing to disperse.</p><p>This mist, however, was a poisonous peach瘴, deadly to ordinary mortals. Even cultivators risked serious internal injury if they weren't careful.  The瘴, thick and persistent, veiled several structures within.</p><p>This was the hidden refuge of Jiupao Daoren!  Ji Wu, a disciple of exceptional talent, had been taken on by Jiupao Daoren after the latter's arrival in Hanshan City.  Jiupao Daoren then secluded himself here, under the patronage of the Ji family.</p><p>However, the main base of the Moyan Sect wasn't located here.  Hunted relentlessly by the Yuanzhao Sect, Jiupao Daoren was extremely cautious. He understood the value of multiple hiding places; this was only one of his secret refuges, known to very few—perhaps not even all four of the Moyan Envoys.</p><p>Yu Hua's position within the Kuiyin Sect seemed far higher than Qin Sang had imagined. He had gone to extraordinary lengths to uncover Jiupao Daoren's secrets, even learning about his various hideouts.</p><p>It wasn't a personal quirk of Jiupao Daoren's to cultivate peach trees near his residence.  Instead, the Kuiyin Sect possessed a highly secretive, unique spirit array that subtly leveraged the natural peach瘴 to create an undetectable perimeter. Anyone unaware of the array would focus solely on navigating the poisonous mist, completely oblivious to the trap laid within.  All of Jiupao Daoren's hideouts utilized similar arrays.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be certain whether Jiupao Daoren was currently hidden within the peach瘴. However, according to Yu Hua, this was Jiupao Daoren’s most secret refuge, known only to Ji Wu.  Qin Sang reasoned that if Jiupao Daoren had obtained restorative medicine, this would be the ideal place to recuperate.  That's why he came directly to Hanshan City, instead of searching elsewhere.</p><p>Unable to see clearly through the peach瘴, Qin Sang wasn’t sure if Jiupao Daoren was inside.  He had to check for himself.  Having learned the array's solution from Yu Hua, Qin Sang quickly identified the pattern, concealed his presence, and approached the eastern side of the瘴.  He covered his nose and mouth before swiftly entering.</p>
