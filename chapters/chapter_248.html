<h1>**Chapter 241 – Centipede Guide**</h1><p>Yu Daiyue seemed to still want to persuade him, but at this moment, a black vortex suddenly appeared on the stone stele, and a figure slowly walked out. The man had a bun hanging at the back of his head, dressed as a mid-age Taoist priest. There were slight creases on his Taoist robe, and his breath was a trifle chaotic.</p><p>His countenance was, however, very calm, seemingly untroubled by the trial of the ancient ruins. He was slightly taken aback by the sight of two persons standing before the stone stele. His eyes instantly turned vigilant, and his momentum transformed. But upon recognizing Qin Sang and Yu Daiyue, he visibly relaxed and greeted them with a smile.</p><p>"Turns out to be the two Junior Brothers from Shaohua Mountain. This humble Wen greets you."</p><p>"Greetings, Senior Brother Wen!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Daiyue returned his greeting together. This man was a disciple of the Shangyuan Pure Palace. As Shaohua Mountain enjoyed a friendly relationship with Shangyuan Pure Palace, they had met and exchanged courtesies outside the Tianjing Secret Realm.</p><p>This man was a cultivator at the advanced Foundation Establishment realm, one of the strongest among the people who had entered the Ancient Ruins this time. It was no wonder that he had passed the trial with such ease.</p><p>After the mid-age Taoist exchanged a few pleasantries with them, he headed in a certain direction and left on his own.</p><p>He did not go straight to the west, showcasing that everyone had tacitly agreed that it was the territory of the Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Sidetracked by the mid-age Taoist and having witnessed Qin Sang's firm resolve, Yu Daiyue dropped the idea of trying to persuade him. He randomly picked a direction and flew away.</p><p>Qin Sang watched on as Yu Daiyue's figure disappeared into the depths of the forest, then retrieved the RuYi Jade Talisman. A contemplative look filled his face.</p><p>After coming to the Tianjing Secret Realm, he had been forced to use the talisman once to escape danger, resulting in even deeper cracks on the talisman.</p><p>During the trial, Qin Sang had been surrounded by humanoid ghosts and saw that Yu Daiyue had remained motionless the entire time. Thus, he was forced to use the RuYi Jade Talisman. The might of the talisman was as expected. It transformed into countless RuYi Jades, clearing a large number of humanoid specters in an instant and carving a bloody path.</p><p>Qin Sang was convinced that Yu Daiyue must not have been without a trump card, but had been hiding its use.</p><p>However, Qin Sang also understood that Yu Daiyue's reluctance to reveal his trump card was not necessarily out of malintent.</p><p>Putting himself in Yu Daiyue's shoes, Qin Sang realized that his reaction was perfectly normal. When he had passed the second stage of the trial, Yu Daiyue had been severely injured and in a miserable state. He had even been forced to give up an arm to preserve his life. On the other hand, Qin Sang had sustained not one injury, demonstrating a gap in their capabilities.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang made the excuse that he had used an exploding top-grade magic weapon, there would be no way to verify it, making it difficult to convince Yu Daiyue.</p><p>In Yu Daiyue's eyes, Qin Sang was likely shrouded in a layer of mystery, with his real strength not matching his apparent realm. If he did not force out some of Qin Sang's trump cards, he would be unable to set his heart at ease.</p><p>In the cultivation world, the foundation of cooperation has never been the so-called bonds of kinship.</p><p>Realizing Yu Daiyue's thoughts, Qin Sang no longer纠结. He directly used his Ruyi Jade Talisman anyway. Besides, his real trump card was not this talisman.</p><p>If he dragged things out, Yu Daiyue would only become more convinced that Qin Sang harbored malicious intent. He would rather let everything go than give Qin Sang an opportunity to exploit.</p><p>Nobody was a fool!</p><p>Qin Sang reached out to touch the cracks on the talisman, sighed inwardly, and put it back into his Mustard Seed Pouch. He then chose a nearby place near the stone stele, set up a restriction, and began to recover his spiritual energy.</p><p>Some time later, Qin Sang's strength had been restored to its peak. He stood up and jumped into a treetop to scan the surroundings.</p><p>After glancing in the direction Yu Daiyue had disappeared, Qin Sang looked away. The direction Yu Daiyue had taken was definitely not the real one. He could forget about using him as a guide.</p><p>The seniors with higher cultivation had entered the ancient ruins long before them. Qin Sang scanned the area multiple times but found no traces of fighting.</p><p>He wondered if the depths of the ancient ruins were also this peaceful.</p><p>Watching for a long time without seeing anything unusual, Qin Sang stepped on a tree trunk and randomly chose a direction. He summoned his sword and headed straight north, flying away.</p><p>At first, he traveled by sword, but when he reached the edge of the mountain range, he put away his spiritual sword and proceeded silently.</p><p>The vegetation on the mountain was the same as it was at the foot of the mountain, wilted and desolate.</p><p>At the waist of the mountain was an ancient, dilapidated seven-story wooden building. The building was extremely degraded, its exterior covered in withered vines. Its doors and windows had disappeared, leaving several gaping holes. The vines crawled into the holes, suggesting that the interior was likely in a state of disarray.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared before the wooden building. He was clear that this building definitely did not contain anything, but it did not hurt to go inside and check.</p><p>Gusts of icy winds howled about the wooden building, ripping through it with the force of blades, and with a clean sweep, sliced off all the trailing vines that had once densely covered its exterior. It had been given a new look.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended the stairs and proceeded to the threshold of the building. He carried out a detailed inch-by-inch inspection and discovered remnants of formations that had been destroyed by brute force.</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>Qin Sang looked thoughtful. There had once been formations protecting this wooden building, but it had been certainly been ransacked by the demonic sect.</p><p>He walked into the first floor, which was littered with dried vines and yellowed leaves and thick with dust. Directly opposite the entrance were seven wooden stakes which were more or less intact.</p><p>On one of the stakes was, surprisingly, a circular light screen. Qin Sang was somewhat taken aback. He hadn’t expected to find any intact seals here. There should originally have been treasures on each of these stakes, but they had already been taken away, and even within the light screen, there was nothing.</p><p>He stepped forward to gauge the strength of the seal. He realized that breaking it would take a great deal of his energy.</p><p>He went from the first floor all the way to the seventh and highest floor. The number of stakes gradually decreased until there was only one left on the top floor, and it definitely contained a precious treasure.</p><p>However, they were all empty—not a single thing left behind.</p><p>“What a bunch of bandits!” Qin Sang inwardly cursed. He leaped through the window and headed due north.</p><p>He did not tarry at any similar wooden buildings along the way. On the seventh floor of the building, he had seen a fresh footprint. Clearly, somebody had already preceded him in this direction. He would have to proceed to the depths of the ruins as quickly as possible to gain an advantage.</p><p>The ruins were more expansive than he had imagined. Qin Sang had been flying for some time without catching sight of its boundaries. He searched several ruins in succession but came up empty-handed. Finally, he came across the remains of what had seemed to be a medicinal herb garden. Its defensive perimeters were more or less intact, but the interior was overgrown with weeds, and all the plants had been uprooted.</p><p>Exiting the medicinal garden, Qin Sang shook his head as he walked, then outside its precincts, he sighed. He had lost all hope of finding anything in these ancient ruins.</p><p>After reflecting for a moment, Qin Sang placed a hand on the spirit beast pouch, and the fiery jade centipede emerged in his palm. He switched the dry yang crystal with a fire element stone.</p><p>After twenty years of care, the fiery jade centipede had undergone no change whatsoever and was still the same size as it had been two decades ago. Qin Sang still had not gotten it to acknowledge him as its master.</p><p>He let go of its spiritual energy. The fiery jade centipede fumbled about left and right as if it could not find anything. It crawled around aimlessly.</p>
