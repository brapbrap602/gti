<h1>Chapter 1453:  Shifting Shadows</h1><p>Chapter 1453:  Shifting Shadows</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang's eyes remained unwavering, his form unhesitating.  He clenched his right fist, a spirit-energy fist-guard, bristling with spikes, materializing on its surface. He then unleashed a devastating blow against the still-forming ice wall.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The ice wall shattered.</p><p>A flash of lightning pierced the flying ice shards.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Qin Sang didn't forget to create a deception.  The spirit-energy fist-guard made it appear as if he'd broken the ice wall with some supernatural ability, not his raw strength.</p><p>Especially in front of the Hun Mo Elder, concealing a trump card was crucial; it might prove invaluable later.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang made a gesture with his hand.</p><p>Just as he was about to retrieve the Jin Chen Sword, Qin Sang's expression shifted subtly, his brows furrowing in a peculiar way.</p><p>A beam of sword light flew back.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly sheathed it.  Besides the Jin Chen Sword, there was a tiny, translucent ice bead, no bigger than a pea, pressed beneath the sword, brought back unnoticed by others.</p><p>He glanced sideways at Chen Yan, subtly and without pausing, then strode away amidst the diverse expressions surrounding him.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang let out a low, angry chuckle.</p><p>"Humph!  Ambushing and attempting to assassinate this old man, yet claiming it's a misunderstanding?  When did the Xuan Tian Palace become so shameless?  When I have the time, I will personally demand an explanation from Yin Changsheng!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng, the Palace Master of the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>This person's name echoed throughout the North Sea; finding information wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>That tone…</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace disciples were momentarily stunned, a thought occurring simultaneously to them.</p><p>"Does he have some connection with the Palace Master?  Which old demon from the Boundless Sea is he?"</p><p>"Junior Sister, are you alright?"</p><p>Shi Xue breathed a sigh of relief, her heart pounding, seeing the demon finally driven off by the two Elders and Chen Yan.</p><p>This was the first time she'd faced such danger.</p><p>The oppressive feeling the demon had given her still sent shivers down her spine.</p><p>Noticing her junior sister standing there, still holding the phoenix-shaped sword, eyes closed, seemingly unwell, Shi Xue rushed over to support her, her face etched with worry.</p><p>Chen Yan shook her head, her eyelids fluttering as she slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>She turned towards the south, her gaze following the lightning-fast escaping figure, her eyes flickering in thought.</p><p>Another Xuan Tian Palace Nascent Soul cultivator flew over, discovering Shi Xue and Liu Li extremely weak, inwardly alarmed.</p><p>Elders Mei and Lan ordered this cultivator to protect Shi Xue and Liu Li, before giving chase.</p><p>After hearing a brief account, this cultivator was even more shocked, involuntarily looking ahead, then exclaiming in surprise, "The two Elders have been left behind!"</p><p>Shi Xue looked, and it was true.</p><p>That person was too fast!</p><p>Unable to fight and unable to pursue, such an opponent was truly terrifying.</p><p>…</p><p>On the sea.</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder, accompanied by his black-robed senior disciple, their forms rising and falling with the waves, rapidly approached.</p><p>Aware of the missing Xuan Tian Palace Elders, they had left the island to search, drawn by the unusual spectacle.  They discovered a fierce battle and approached to observe.</p><p>The black-robed man saw from afar that four Xuan Tian Palace Nascent Soul cultivators seemed helpless against a single person.  Even the two Elders' mouths hung open, their expressions vacant.</p><p>He believed his master possessed similar strength, but his master was the top expert of the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Who was this person?</p><p>No wonder the Xuan Tian Palace sought his master's cooperation; they were hunting such a powerful foe.</p><p>But the black-robed man was puzzled: why wasn't the Xuan Tian Palace's Grand Elder present?  Otherwise, this person wouldn't be so brazen.</p><p>"Master, the Xuan Tian Palace Grand Elder doesn't seem to be here," the black-robed man carefully transmitted his voice.</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder hummed, scanning his surroundings. He hadn't sensed the Grand Elder's presence along the way, suggesting another plan.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang swiftly evaded the encirclement, escaping unscathed.</p><p>The black-robed man was once again dumbfounded, mentally assessing the person's strength, using the Hun Mo Elder as his benchmark.</p><p>Although this person had employed clever tactics, taking advantage of the Xuan Tian Palace's eagerness to rescue people and seizing every opportunity, this feat still demonstrated their terrifying power.</p><p>Seeing this, the Hun Mo Elder's eyes narrowed sharply.</p><p>Then, the Hun Mo Elder said solemnly, "He discovered me."</p><p>The black-robed man was momentarily stunned before understanding his master's words.</p><p>That person hadn't been driven away by the Xuan Tian Palace, but had fled after discovering his master's presence.</p><p>In other words, this wasn't even his full strength.</p><p>This man…</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren's eyes flashed with cold light.  The fact that someone could detect his presence brought back memories of a failed ambush at the Thousand Buddha Wall of Jing Hai Zong, an event that triggered a chain of unfortunate events. Now, this person displayed astonishing escape skills.  Individuals with such abilities are few and far between in all of Bei Hai.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren recalled the battle for the artifact in the Buddha Hall.  That person's speed had been exceptional; he'd barely entered the secret passage when the person escaped deep inside, detonating the Chi Yan seal.</p><p>Though the person had masked their aura with black spirit fire, it didn't stop Hun Mo Lao Ren from connecting the dots.  Such coincidences were too much; he couldn't ignore the pattern.  This was enough to make a judgment. At least, it was worth a try!</p><p>A whistling sound approached from behind.  More Yuan Ying stage cultivators from Xuan Tian Palace arrived.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren glanced back and forth, seeing the two Xuan Tian Palace elders' incompetence. He snorted, his shoulders rising, and a ghostly specter floated out from behind him.</p><p>The black-robed person, swept by the specter's eerie and indifferent gaze, felt a chill and quickly lowered their head.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren forced out a drop of blood, feeding it to the specter, and hissed, "Go!"</p><p>No longer concealing himself, he struck his black bamboo staff, transforming into a black light.</p><p>Shi Xue, worried about the sacred artifact, felt the sudden surge of power behind her, her body stiffening.</p><p>Mei and Lan, helplessly watching the artifact fly away, were equally shocked to find Hun Mo Lao Ren nearby. They hastily moved aside, uncertain and alarmed. The situation was far beyond their control.</p><p>Most shocking was the specter.  It transformed into a ghostly mist, tinged with blood red, moving faster than Hun Mo Lao Ren and Qin Sang, leaving a striking trail in the void.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang easily evaded the Xuan Tian Palace elders, then sensed Hun Mo Lao Ren and the specter's activity.</p><p>"That old demon finally made his move!"</p><p>Qin Sang felt the specter approaching with unbelievable speed, his heart trembling. He then noticed the ghostly mist shrinking and weakening as it sped, seemingly burning its own essence for speed.</p><p>"What good will that do?"  Qin Sang questioned, secretly forming hand seals.  When the specter entered range, he decisively unleashed a heavenly thunderbolt. However, sensing something amiss, he held back, testing it.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Divine thunder descended, striking the ghostly mist. Qin Sang's pupils constricted.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren, who had been lagging behind, emerged from the dissipating mist!</p>
