  Chapter 975 - Mission Generated
 </h1>
 <div class="chapter-c" id="calibre_link-2362">
  <p class="calibre5">
   When the bombing stopped, the abandoned military base had turned into
          a mess, with the collapsed gravel blocked off countless roads. The
          terrain had become much more complicated, and the gravel fell from
          time to time with a clacking sound.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The bottom of the base was filled with smoke and dust. The falling
          debris had piled up into a hill, beneath which Nero was firmly buried.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Suddenly, there was a sound akin to a slimy liquid flowing in the
          darkness.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Whoosh!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   An area of two square meters within the debris below gradually turned
          red as it shone brighter and brighter. The metal beams and stone
          pieces melted together to reveal an empty hole.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero crawled out of the hole, his hands continuously casting heat rays
          as he limped. The high temperature around him caused the very air to
          warp.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Cough cough cough…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   A dull cough escaped the mechanical suit as Nero took gasps of air. He
          focused, activating the mechanical suit to do a full body scan.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Left leg is slightly misaligned. Awaiting permission for mechanical
          suit to autocorrect bone alignment.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Go ahead.”
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His armor on the left leg tightened a little, and the misaligned bones
          were set. Nero snorted in pain before relaxing. Previously, a few tons
          of debris had hit his body, and although his mechanical suit was fine,
          the shock had given him a slight injury. After all, he was an
          ordinary, fragile mechanic.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The radar displayed that the enemies were above him. Nero knew that
          this was not the time for him to relax, and he immediately opened the
          communicator to contact his teammates.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Captain, Nero here. Where are you guys, and how’s the situation?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Static sound buzzed, broken by intermittent screams of pain. Nero
          shouted for quite a bit before he received news from them.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “We’re not doing good here!” His teammate’s face popped up on his
          tactical display, filled with bruises and cuts. His tone was hurried.
          “I was beside the captain just now, and when the base collapsed, the
          captain was stunned. An artillery shot penetrated through the ground
          and hit us, and many of us are now injured and scattered. No matter
          who hears this news, save them, and bring everyone to gather. We have
          to escape immediately!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero immediately opened the team’s health monitoring subprogram and
          was shocked when he saw the red on the screen.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Everyone’s injuries were worse than his, and there were several
          people, including the captain, who were already on the verge of death.
          Because he had fallen to the bottom of the base and was buried, he had
          managed to escape the subsequent bombing from the battleship, so he
          was the least injured.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   It was because of his Luck Glow.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
   <div class="chapter-c">
   </div>
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “My condition is the best…” Nero immediately felt the pressure on his
          shoulders.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He gritted his teeth, opening the position locator for his team. The
          position of each teammate was marked on the tactical screen of the
          mechanical suit, and the artificial intelligence within operated at a
          high speed to map out the fastest rescue route.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   From behind his back jetted out a tail flame, and Nero flew out of the
          big pit at the bottom of the base to rescue the scattered members.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The terrain was complex, but there was no time for him to make a
          detour. His palm continuously shot out heat rays, melting through all
          the obstacles in front of him, saving one teammate after another
          before the arrival of the Kunde ground troops. Finally, he reached the
          position of his captain.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Blasting aside an obstructing metal plate, Nero flew into the messy
          room and landed with a loud thud. He saw the captain and a group of
          members there, all with varying injuries.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The captain was lying paralyzed on the ground, his upper body leaning
          against the wall. His armor was scorched black, revealing large holes.
          Looking up at Nero’s entrance, he squeezed out a smile, saying in a
          weak voice.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Nero, you’re here. You… cough cough… you did well.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Captain, don’t talk anymore.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Seeing this, an intravenous needle shot out from Nero’s finger, and he
          pierced it into the captain’s chest.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Aurora’s special life potion was injected into the captain’s body
          through the needle, and his serious injuries were cured in an instant.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The captain’s state recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye,
          causing him to let out a comfortable groan. He got up full of energy,
          clicking his tongue. “This is the special life potion of Her
          Excellency Aurora? What good stuff!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Aurora would occasionally activate her ability to produce such life
          medicines, but the quantity was limited after all, and there was even
          a shelf life for the potions, so not all warriors from Black Star Army
          could have them. The normal members would all use the typical store
          bought medicines, but with Nero’s background, he naturally had
          Aurora’s life potions.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Those with major injuries come over. I still have a few more of the
          life potions, and it will recover your combat capabilities,” Nero
          shouted.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   One of them could not help but say, “Leave some for yourself. There’ll
          be another bloody battle ahead. What will happen if you’re injured?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “It’s ok. I still have other medicines.” Nero did not seem to care.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Everyone glanced at each other before shrugging. Having a descendent
          with a powerful background in their team was not too bad a thing. The
          backer had already offered, so why were they hesitating?
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero healed up all his teammates, and they discussed their options.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Everyone, we’re in an unfavorable situation. We’ve been caught in an
          ambush, and the entire fleet is being attacked by the enemy,” the
          captain explained in a serious tone. “The others are too busy to
          respond to us, so we can only break through by ourselves. There are
          three Kunde battleships above us, but we have no vehicles, so it will
          be dangerous…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “If the enemy continue to bomb the fleet, it will be a desperate
          situation for us, but now the enemy has stopped attacking and has sent
          their ground troops to approach us instead.” The eyes of the vice
          captain flashed. “This means that they intend to capture us alive.
          This is perhaps our only chance to escape.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “That’s right!” The captain nodded. “If we wish to escape, we must
          obtain control of the airspace. The fleet can’t meet up with us, so we
          can only grab a spaceship. The chances are slim but not impossible.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “This debris is our barrier. If we rush out, the enemy spaceships can
          bombard us unscrupulously. Thus, we can only wait for the enemy
          soldiers to enter the base and fight with them directly. In order to
          prevent friendly fire, the spaceships will not open fire at random, so
          we need to approach this with a two-pronged strategy. One team will
          deal with the enemy soldiers, while the other will go to steal a
          spaceship…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The captain paused. Everyone looked at each other.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was something that would affect everyone’s survival. Out of ten
          paths, only one would lead them out alive.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   So, the question was, who should grab the spaceship? It stood to
          reason that the strongest person should be the one performing this
          task, and the strongest in the team was Nero with the biggest
          background.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   But to ask someone from such a huge background to accept such a huge
          responsibility, and only a young teen at that… Everyone was a little
          hesitant.
  </p>
  <div class="chapter-c">
  </div>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Seeing this, Nero gritted his teeth and set his resolve.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Let me go. There’s no one more suitable than me.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The captain looked at him, but in the end, he did not try to dissuade
          him, only solemnly saying, “We’re relying on you. We’ll be engaging
          the enemy to earn time for you… Remember, everyone’s life is in your
          hands.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I understand.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero took a deep breath, regaining his calm. He controlled his
          mechanical suit to enter stealth mode, casting one last glance at his
          members. He then separated, vanishing into the darkness.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The captain breathed out heavily and turned to the rest with a severe
          expression, “You guys don’t need me to tell you what to do. No matter
          what, lure down every single enemy.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “We understand.” The vice captain had a complex expression and nodded.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Other than Nero, everyone else understood what the captain’s tone
          implied. In actual fact, they had two plans. The first was to allow
          Nero to capture the spaceship and then escape with him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   But if this level failed, they would unhesitatingly invoke the hidden
          level… which was to turn themselves into suicide warriors, allowing
          Nero to abandon them and run off by himself.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   It was not just because of Nero and his relationship with the Army
          Commander, but everyone also knew that the future of this young man
          was immeasurable. Only by allowing a person with potential to escape
          could they then obtain their revenge in the future.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   …
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After sneaking around in the dark for a moment, the commotion of his
          teammates fighting the Kunde soldiers came from Nero’s communicator.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At this moment, he was no longer on the battlefield but had arrived in
          front of a collapsed area leading to the ground level. He remained
          hidden, using the radar to lock onto the spaceship closest to him in
          the air.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His palms were slick with sweat as he carefully released a
          unique-looking hovering guard. It was painted in black and gold, and
          it looked completely different from all of Nero’s other equipment.
          There was an unparalleled sense of quality in it. After being
          released, it smartly started to circle around Nero’s head.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I’m relying on you, brother.” Nero patted the hovering guard, his
          heart firm.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Relax, kid. With your big brother here, no one can hurt you!” The
          hovering guard actually replied!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was Nero’s final card. This hovering guard was a present from Han
          Xiao when they first met.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   It was high-grade equipment personally built by a Beyond Grade A
          Super, driven by dark energy. In addition, it had the blessings of
          [Emperor’s Gift] and [Machinery Fusion]. After Han Xiao obtained the
          skill of [Mechanical Life Tinder], he had also transformed it into an
          intelligent mechanical life form, with its independent consciousness
          and chance to grow. He had named it ‘Sky Guardian’.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Even when Nero was a kid, the Sky Guardian without any Mechanical
          Force could fend off Grade C Supers.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Now, with Nero as a Grade C+ Super, along with Perfect Mechanical
          Sense, the Sky Guardian could unleash even more force. Even when
          compared to Grade Bs, Nero did not lose out at all.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero had never taken out this trump card of his, especially when
          sparring in school. Even if a pugilist rushed up to his face and beat
          him black and blue, he had never taken out this killing machine.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His true combat capability was unknown, even to Mia who was the
          closest to him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Within the school compound, Mia had often sparred with him, but she
          did not know how strong he could be if he went all out.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Staring at the radar on his screen, Nero breathed in and out to
          stabilize himself, allowing his energy to fill every cell of his body.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Hu, I can do this…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero did not hesitate any longer and activated his thrusters.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Boom!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His entire body shot forward, blasting through the rocks at the
          entrance and rushing into the sky!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The three battleships immediately set their guns and fired at Nero.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The power of the battleships’ cannons were deadly to a Grade C, but
          the Sky Guardian accompanying Nero shook, and rays of light shot out
          from it, forming a golden protective shield to surround Nero.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Boom boom boom!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   All the artillery cannons bombarded the area in a burst of fireworks,
          but the shield only showed a slight crack, which instantly repaired
          itself. It forcibly endured an entire round of firepower.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At the same time, the Kunde battleships above understood Nero’s
          intentions and activated their shields, preventing external entry.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Open a pathway for me!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   With a thought, the Sky Guardian released a blinding ray of Mechanical
          Force, which quickly reformed into a hexagonal shaped muzzle. An
          all-consuming black beam burst out, carrying immense penetrative
          force.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Pew pew pew!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The rate of fire was incredible and resembled the actions of someone
          who was rushing urgently toward the toilet.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The target battleship’s shields were blasted apart, and Nero seized
          the chance, rushing into the gap created.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Pa pa pa…
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Compressed orbs were thrown out from his hands and transformed into
          laser cutting drills with electromagnetic bases. They attached
          themselves to the spacecraft, quickly cutting through its hull to
          create an entrance to the internal compartments.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero did a barrel roll in midair, slamming into the spaceship. Without
          a word, he threw out a large number of mechanical soldiers and
          activated his weapons, cutting through the ship’s members as if he was
          chopping vegetables.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Because this spaceship was the one that had sent the ground troops to
          capture Nero’s team, its strength on board was insufficient, and this
          made it more convenient for Nero.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Firing without any reserve, Nero did not take much time to kill his
          way into the main control room, and he immediately took out a Virtual
          Intrusion chip manufactured by the army. He inserted it into the core
          of the spaceship’s artificial intelligence. He was not a Virtual
          Mechanic yet, but the army provided such virtual intrusion aspects.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At this moment, Nero stumbled because the spaceship had suddenly begun
          to tremble violently!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Rumble!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Looking outside the window, Nero saw that the other two spaceships had
          turned around, facing him to concentrate their fire without caring
          about the lives of their comrades.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “To actually fire at your own teammates, how vicious.” Nero clicked
          his tongue but did not slow down, killing his way into the command
          room and seizing the authority of the spaceship.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He immediately poured the majority of energy into the battleship’s
          shields, controlling it to slam into the nearest enemy.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Bang!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The shields of both spaceships collided, creating firework-like
          sparks. The other spaceship lost its momentum, careening off course.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Whether it was a coincidence or not, the direction it was sent flying
          was precisely where the second enemy spaceship was. Both enemies
          collided toward each other, and they lost control momentarily as they
          attempted to steady their spaceships.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Taking this opportunity, Nero piloted the spaceship, directly sliding
          below the two spaceships, parallel to the ground.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Come out quickly! I’ve got the spaceship! Meet me at the coordinates
          that I’m sending over. I’ll beam you guys up!” Nero shouted into the
          channel.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Beautiful!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His teammates exclaimed in joy. They then used their strong bodies to
          withstand the pressure, breaking out of the Kunde Race soldiers’
          encirclement.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Bang!
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The next moment, a portion of the rubble exploded, and the team
          members rushed out, with the Kunde soldiers chasing close behind.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero’s face lit up, and he shouted, “Captain, don’t stop!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This was a race against time, so Nero had no time to control the two
          enemy ships that had adjusted to fire at him. He immediately used the
          traction beam to attract his team members, at the same time releasing
          a large number of turrets to fire at the pursuing soldiers, providing
          cover.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero did not dare drag out the battle, so after rescuing the team, he
          immediately rushed into the sky, fleeing into the universe.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Soon, the rest of his team joined him in the command room, rushing up
          to rub Nero’s head frantically.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Kid, good job!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Haha, we’re saved. I thought we were gonna die this time!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “To get it so smoothly, it seems like luck is on our side!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Everyone had on a joyous expression, continuously praising Nero.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Don’t count your blessings too soon. We’re not out of danger yet.”
          Although the captain tried to dampen their spirits, he was grinning
          from ear to ear himself.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   While there were still spaceships after them, their situation was much
          better compared to before.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   After celebrating for a while, they remembered the rest of their
          comrades who were still trapped, and their joyful expressions quickly
          faded.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “We’ve managed to escape, but what about those in our unit that have
          been surrounded?” someone asked.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “There’s no way. We cannot help them because there are too many
          enemies. If we try to help, we will only get surrounded again.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   His captain shook his head in response. He understood the current
          situation clearly. Going with just their one spaceship was as good as
          sending themselves to their graves. It would only waste their chance
          of escaping.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   This should be the best time for them to separate and run; they should
          not engage in further battles.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At this time, Nero recalled something, and his heart began pounding
          rapidly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   That’s right. I don’t know how Mia’s team is doing…
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Having thought of this, Nero could no longer sit still, he immediately
          passed the spaceship to his teammates to operate while he took out his
          communicator.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The time that it took to connect was akin to him being boiled alive;
          it was excruciatingly long.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero’s heart was burning with anxiety as he waited, but the call never
          got through. He called every single one of Mia’s teammates, but no one
          answered as well.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The call only connected when it reached Mia’s captain. From it came
          the sounds of battle.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Cough cough… Nero? You guys have escaped?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “That’s me. You guys got ambushed too? How’s the situation? We have a
          spaceship that can save you!” Nero spat out quickly like bullets.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Don’t… don’t come over. You guys must take the chance to run. My
          entire team has already been captured, and I’m the only one still left
          resisting. I will not be able to hold on for long as well. You guys
          can’t save us. Quickly go cough cough…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   While speaking, the communication was suddenly cut.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero’s expression tightened, and he turned to walk toward the hatch of
          the spaceship.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Having witnessed the previous scene, his teammates immediately leapt
          up, swarming over him as a mob and restraining him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Nero, don’t be suicidal,” the captain shouted.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I have to save her!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero was tackled by the seven or eight blokes, and he could not move
          at all even if he struggled. However, his attitude was firm.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Don’t be a fool. I told you just now, but going over to save them is
          as good as suicide!” the captain roared in anger.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I know. That’s why I’m not intending to ask for help!” Nero gritted
          his teeth. “This is my own choice. I will not let you guys get
          involved. You can pilot this spaceship, and I’ll go down alone. Don’t
          stop me!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Going solo will make it even more impossible. There’s no point
          sending yourself to die!” The captain was set on holding Nero down.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero struggled for quite a while before he finally calmed down. He sat
          down on the ground, his hands covering his face as he kept silent.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Empathizing with Nero’s situation, the captain could not help but
          sigh, patting Nero’s shoulder. He also did not know what to say, and
          he could only mutter in a depressed tone, “She has only been captured.
          She’s not dead yet. There may still be a chance for their survival. We
          can only escape for now and think of ways to save her later.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The moment he spoke, Nero raised his head and spoke in a low tone with
          reddened eyes.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “You’re right. I was too rash. Thanks for stopping me… I cannot allow
          Mia to fall into the enemy’s hands, not knowing what they will do to
          her. I still have one last hope.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   As he spoke, Nero stood up, taking out his communicator. Taking a deep
          breath, he mustered the courage to dial Han Xiao’s number on the
          communicator.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   He had originally decided not to rely on Han Xiao during his service
          so as not to disappoint him, but he did not have a choice…
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   The communicator rang three times in total. The interval between each
          ring seemed like eternity to Nero. After three rings, Nero heard the
          familiar voice.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Oh, Nero. What have you called me for?” Han Xiao’s face wore a slight
          smile as he answered.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Godfather, I’ve disappointed you.” Nero rubbed his eyes, softly
          speaking. “I’ve met something I cannot solve, and I hope you can help
          me.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Go on,” Han Xiao simply replied.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero quickly explained the situation with his head lowered, waiting
          for a reply.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Seeing his expression, Han Xiao stroked his chin as he smiled. “I
          refuse.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero jerked his head up with an expression of shock and surprise.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Very surprised?” Han Xiao kept his smile. “Your identity now is
          different. You’re no longer my godson but also an ordinary soldier.
          While I indeed give you preferential treatment, I cannot give you
          special care forever.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “But… but…” Nero’s eyes turned red.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “It’s not that I cannot help. Putting aside our relationship, let’s
          look at this from a business perspective. What can you give me to hire
          me?” Han Xiao indifferently continued.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I… I don’t know.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Then, how can you expect me to help?” Han Xiao blinked. “My
          relationship with you is not fake, but I cannot help you without a
          reason. Rules are set like this, so what you desire must be exchanged
          for something else. Throwing away your identity, what else do you have
          to offer me?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero’s emotions were a mess, and he muttered, “I… I have nothing…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Looking at Nero covering his head with both hands, his expression
          despondent, Han Xiao spoke softly as he smiled. “What? Are you feeling
          despair now? Think about it, how long have you not expressed your
          thanks toward me?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Hearing this, Nero’s figure shivered, and he lowered his head.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I’m sorry… I beg you…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Let me ask you again. Have you felt this despair yet?” Han Xiao
          narrowed his eyes, emphasizing on his words.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero was silent for a long time before raising his head. His lips were
          bleeding due to his biting, and his eyes were bloodshot as he stared
          at Han Xiao and nodded.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Good. Remember this feeling, and don’t ever experience it again.” Han
          Xiao straightened himself up before laughing. “Relax, I’ll agree to
          your request this time and save your little girlfriend.”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero’s emotions seemed to have risen back up after being thrown into
          the depths of hell. He stared stunned for a while before he recovered
          his spirits, grasping the communicator with both hands tightly.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Thank you… thank you…”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “Don’t rejoice so early. I never act without a price.” Han Xiao
          propped his head with his hands. “You don’t know what you can offer
          me, but in reality, you are not worthless. At the very least, you have
          a strong gift for machinery. How about using that as a bargaining
          chip?”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “What does this mean?” Nero could not understand.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “If I really must explain, you can understand it as me not wanting you
          to waste your gifts. You don’t need to fully understand this now, and
          you only need to say whether you accept or reject this arrangement.”
          Han Xiao spoke with a smile that was not really a smile at the same
          time.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   Nero was still befuddled, but he had no choice. He could only grit his
          teeth and nod his head.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   “I agree. Please help me!”
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5">
   At the same time, Han Xiao received a notification on his interface
          while seated in his Black Star Palace.
