<h1>Chapter 1896: The Dao Platform of Great Completion</h1><p>The woman, Qin Sang had no idea how long she had been there.  He hadn't sensed her arrival at all.</p><p>She wore blood-red battle attire, faint blood Qi swirling around her. Her already ethereal form appeared even more hazy, her features somewhat indistinct.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could sense the aura emanating from the woman.</p><p>It was an aura filled with unease and violence, which even her strenuous efforts to suppress couldn't conceal.</p><p>It was as if Qin Sang faced a ferocious beast, ready to pounce and devour at any moment, sending shivers down his spine.</p><p>The Blood Moon that pursued him in the Storm Realm gave Qin Sang a feeling incredibly similar to this woman!</p><p>The woman gave a noncommittal glance, then looked towards Qin Sang's dantian, saying faintly, "Lend me your sword."</p><p>The Earth Slaughter Sword within his dantian trembled without reason. Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat, yet he found himself utterly powerless to stop it.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>With a flash of sword light, the Earth Slaughter Sword shot out from his dantian, hovering upside down between them.</p><p>This sword had been with Qin Sang for many years, always silent unless its sword spirit was stirred. Its form was ancient and simple, but its luster was dull, unlike a supreme treasure.</p><p>Now, the Earth Slaughter Sword trembled slightly, its divine light brilliant, displaying a splendor Qin Sang had never witnessed before. The cracks on the blade seemed to have mended, as if it had transformed into a completely different sword.</p><p>The woman stared at the Earth Slaughter Sword, her expression complex, murmuring, "You've finally awakened. It's not too late…"</p><p>A flicker of sword light revealed a figure manifested on the blade—a young boy in azure robes, seemingly asleep with his eyes closed.</p><p>The azure-robed boy's eyelids twitched slightly, then slowly opened. He spoke apologetically, "Someone has been constantly divining my location.  I haven't fully recovered and could only seal myself, unable to perceive your call…"</p><p>As he spoke, the azure-robed boy noticed the woman's state. His voice paused, and an urgent expression appeared on his face. "What happened to you…?"</p><p>"Searching for...my sister...entangled me...I drifted in the River of Sin for too long… too long… sinking into the River of Sin…"</p><p>The woman's eyes revealed sorrow, her voice low.</p><p>She couldn't recall how many years had passed, nor did she know if her pursuit would bear fruit.  An unyielding belief sustained her as she drifted alone in the River of Sin, gradually becoming lost and consumed.</p><p>She spared no effort, persevering relentlessly.  Heaven had eyes, and finally, a glimmer of hope appeared.</p><p>Even if it was only her sister's sword she found!</p><p>The azure-robed boy knew of the woman's experiences all these years.  Pain and sadness flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman's expression changed, her gaze burning as she stared at the azure-robed boy, wanting to speak but hesitating. Her eyes held an anxious anticipation.</p><p>She yearned to ask, yet feared receiving the worst possible answer.</p><p>The azure-robed boy froze, his face revealing unbearable pain and infinite sorrow. His lips moved slightly, speaking soundlessly.</p><p>The woman trembled, revealing deep grief.</p><p>So profound was her grief, it seemed to move heaven and earth.  The tribulation clouds had just dispersed, and now dark clouds gathered once more.</p><p>Black clouds rolled, the wind biting cold, an atmosphere of desolation descending.</p><p>"Hehehehehe…"</p><p>The woman's hair and beard danced wildly as if she had fallen into the demonic path.  A strange laughter escaped her lips.</p><p>The laughter was incredibly shrill, like the shriek of a malevolent ghost, transforming the Divine Court into a hellish realm.</p><p>The blood Qi surrounding her suddenly vibrated violently, her aura unsteady. Her ethereal form became distorted, as if she was about to lose her reason and descend into madness, a perilous situation!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel terrified, instinctively retreating.</p><p>The azure-robed boy sighed, about to speak again.</p><p>Abruptly, the woman's grief transformed into boundless killing intent. She roared, "Is your edge still sharp?!"</p><p>The azure-robed boy's expression turned solemn.  Without a word, he flashed and merged into the sword.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A divine edge was revealed.</p><p>Sword intent shook the heavens!</p><p>The woman looked towards the Nine Heavens Thunder City.</p><p>"The Divine Court emerges, the Dao returns to the Great Thousand, a joyous occasion! This matter arose suddenly, and this Palace hasn't prepared a congratulatory gift. I specially present a Dao Platform of Great Completion, but the Celestial Master must come personally to claim it. Celestial Master… do you dare accept?!"</p><p>Her voice boomed like thunder, piercing the clouds!</p><p>…</p><p>Zhongmao Prefecture, the Ritual Altar.</p><p>Heaven and earth, everywhere consumed by war.</p><p>The chaos didn't reach this place.</p><p>The Bestowal Academy in Zhongmao Prefecture remained tranquil. No one dared disturb True Monarch Zhang's closed-door cultivation.</p><p>Whether it was summoning the Lunar Primordial Monarch or invoking the Thunder Ancestor, no matter how magnificent the celestial phenomena, the Bestowal Hall remained firmly shut.</p><p>*Dong! Dong! Dong!*</p><p>The demonic creatures of the Ghostfang Kingdom beat their demonic drums once more.</p><p>The border war continued unabated.  Although many ferocious beasts were scared off by the Thunder Ancestor's aura, many remained driven by their savage nature.</p><p>However, the momentum of the drumbeats was noticeably weaker than before, lacking conviction.</p><p>The Thunder Ancestor's divine might was too terrifying. The sight of eight thunder dragons converging was deeply etched into the hearts of all the demons, an indelible mark.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators, on the contrary, their fighting spirit surged. They even seized the opportunity of the chaotic beast tide to launch attacks outside the city walls, fighting fiercely.</p><p>With the Thunder Ancestor's aid, what fear did they have of mere demonic creatures?</p><p>However, the two Grand True Ones overseeing the Zhongmao Prefecture Ritual Altar knew that the situation remained fraught with danger.</p><p>Experts from the Outer Territories had set their sights on the Divine Court, and they could return at any moment, perhaps even more than one.</p><p>And the Thunder Ancestor only had the power of a single strike.  True Monarch Wei, the Capital Protector of Baishi Prefecture, was nearly exhausted after summoning the Thunder Ancestor, unable to act again for a short while.</p><p>Now, the entire Daoist sect's hopes rested on True Monarch Zhang!</p><p>The two sat cross-legged on their respective altars, consuming丹药pills and seizing every moment to meditate, occasionally casting worried glances towards the Bestowal Academy.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Radiant light shone from the horizon—it was the Capital Protector Seal of Baishi Prefecture.</p><p>The Capital Protector Seal hung high in the sky, seemingly attempting to resonate with the Capital Protector Seal of Zhongmao Prefecture.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no reaction from the Bestowal Academy.</p><p>Just then, the expressions of the two Grand True Ones shifted slightly. They both sensed unusual fluctuations in the world's spiritual energy and instantly realized what was happening, their faces revealing ecstatic joy.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Gale-force winds erupted around the Bestowal Hall.</p><p>Spiritual tides filled the sky.</p><p>This phenomenon had occurred not long ago, triggered by True Monarch Zhang's breakthrough to the mid-stage.</p><p>Now, with the phenomenon reappearing, there was only one possibility.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang had broken through consecutively, directly reaching the late stage of the River Diagram Dharma Position!  Just one more step, and he would be a Celestial Master!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The spiritual tides surged, emanating a power that startled the two Grand True Ones, pouring continuously into the Bestowal Hall.</p><p>Soon after, the spiritual tide abruptly dispersed, the celestial phenomena vanishing.</p><p>The Bestowal Hall became quiet, with no movement.</p><p>The two Grand True Ones exchanged glances, worry surfacing once again.</p><p>"The True Monarch is perhaps stabilizing his cultivation…" one murmured.</p><p>Before he could finish, a figure suddenly appeared above the Bestowal Hall—it was True Monarch Zhang.</p><p>The two were overjoyed, just about to rise and salute, when True Monarch Zhang raised a hand to stop them.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang stood with his hands clasped behind his back, suspended in the air. Having broken through so rapidly, his aura had yet to completely stabilize.  But his cultivation was now vastly different—he was the first True Monarch since the decline of the Dao Court to reach the late stage of the River Diagram!</p><p>His eyes held divine light as his gaze swept over the two prefectures of the Daoist sect, over the battlefields in the north and south, over Jushan Prefecture, and across the void towards the Great Sage Mansion.</p><p>The drumbeats suddenly stopped.</p><p>The Demon King beating the drum felt an inexplicable chill in his heart, a sense of impending doom.  His arm holding the drumstick trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang paid them no mind.  His gaze shifted upwards, seeing Celestial Venerable Tianyue and the Demonic Dragon locked in a fierce battle. He saw the scenes within and outside the Divine Court, instantly grasping the situation.</p><p>Lightly shaking his Daoist robe, True Monarch Zhang held the Zhongmao Prefecture Capital Protector Seal and stepped into the sky.</p><p>After summoning the Thunder Ancestor, True Monarch Wei hadn't dispersed the Celestial Earth Altar.  As True Monarch Zhang took control of the altar, his actions immediately caused the Celestial Earth Altar to resonate.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang walked on air. With each step he took, the divine light of the Celestial Earth Altar brightened, quickly surpassing its previous peak.</p><p>Still not satisfied, he ascended the Celestial Earth Altar and bowed remotely towards Baishi Prefecture: "Fellow Daoist Wei, assist me!"</p><p>True Monarch Wei cast off her exhaustion and nodded solemnly.</p><p>She knew the Talisman Deity to be summoned next was extraordinary, requiring one of the three highest Daoist rituals—the Grand Ritual of Reaching Heaven!</p><p>True Monarch Zhang feared he couldn't manage alone and needed her assistance.</p><p>She hadn't fully recovered and couldn't do more, but she could serve as the Ritual Master and concurrently oversee the斋vegetarian offerings, assisting True Monarch Zhang, the High Priest.</p><p>The High Priest, Ritual Master, and Overseer of Offerings were the three primary roles in Daoist rituals.</p><p>The High Priest paced the罡steps and communicated with the divine, holding the highest position. The Ritual Master served as the assistant, even more indispensable in important rituals.</p><p>True Monarch Wei calmed her breath, flew towards the Capital Protector Seal of Baishi Prefecture she had previously deployed, and stood beneath it with a solemn expression.</p><p>Next, True Monarch Zhang pointed across the void towards Mount Heming in Jushan Prefecture. A cluster of spiritual light flew out from the Yin Heaven Palace—it was a fragment of the Jushan Prefecture Capital Protector Seal.</p><p>The three seals shone brightly!</p><p>Orders were transmitted to the three prefectures, and all the presiding cultivators immediately followed the commands, circulating their cultivation and performing the Dharma.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang commanded the three seals, holding spiritual incense. The fragrance reached the azure heavens as he bowed towards the Divine Court.</p><p>A ritual, more complex and grander than before, commenced.</p><p>As the Grand Ritual of Reaching Heaven progressed, some cultivators remained in each Immortal City to defend, while the rest of the Daoist cultivators summoned their altars and gradually converged upon the Celestial Earth Altar.</p><p>"Six Dragons to the left of the Imperial Steps, Nine Tigers within the Pass.</p><p>Reveal the three-headed, six-armed majestic form, wield the grand creation of the Seven Luminaries and Eight Spirits.</p><p>As the Imperial Bell tolls, all saints descend; with a light swing of the battle-axe, all demons shatter.</p><p>Divine light resplendent, eternally protecting all beings;</p><p>True nature majestic, vowing eternal prosperity for the righteous path.</p><p>Cleaving corpses for a thousand li, slaying ghosts of the Five Elements.</p><p>Great compassion, great vows, Great Sage, Great Mercy.</p><p>Reaching Heaven, praying for blessings, extending auspiciousness, cleansing misfortune, protecting life, the Great Marshal of the Eighty-One Legions of the North Pole Tianpeng, the Perfected Lord of the Dharma Cloud Covering Heaven!"</p><p>True Monarch Zhang led the True Ones, their chanting shaking the Three Realms.</p><p>The incantation they recited was called the *Precious Proclamation of Tianpeng*, used to summon one of the legendary Four Saints of the North Pole, the Great Marshal Tianpeng!</p><p>As the final incantation resounded, the Celestial Earth Altar burst forth with dazzling golden light.</p><p>Countless Daoist cultivators gazed at the heavens with excitement.  Following the Thunder Ancestor, they were about to summon another supreme celestial deity!</p><p>Unexpectedly, the golden light quickly dimmed.  Only the chanting echoed between heaven and earth, but no deity descended!</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"Where is Great Marshal Tianpeng?"</p><p>…</p><p>Doubt arose in the hearts of the Daoist cultivators, accompanied by an inexplicable panic.</p><p>The astute ones had already sensed something amiss. Even a fragmented deity, summoned by the Grand Ritual of Reaching Heaven, would give a faint response.</p><p>There was only one possibility—the Talisman Deity had shattered.  Great Marshal Tianpeng no longer existed!</p><p>Panic, sorrow, fear…</p><p>Various emotions spread among the Daoist cultivators.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang seemed oblivious, pausing briefly before continuing to chant.</p><p>"In the wondrous center of Heaven, to the right of the Hall of Illumination.</p><p>Leading the second marshal of the Celestial Stems, ranking amongst the feudal lords of the earthly realm.</p><p>…"</p><p>One of the Four Saints of the North Pole, Marshal Tianyou!</p><p>"Imperial achievements complete, celestial position attained.</p><p>Commanding the Three Caverns and Five Thunders, governing the Eight Heavens and Nine Earths.</p><p>…"</p><p>The *Precious Proclamation of the Supporting Sage*!</p><p>After reciting the three proclamations, it was just like before.</p><p>Countless Daoist cultivators looked up at the heavens, as if questioning why the deities had abandoned them.  Their expressions were filled with grief and indignation, their chanting carrying a profound sense of tragedy.</p><p>Until the last of the Four Saints of the North Pole, the *Precious Proclamation of the True Martial Great Deity*, was finished, there was still no response.</p><p>The Four Saints of the North Pole, all perished!</p><p>The tragic sentiment of the Daoist cultivators shook the sky. Some couldn't help but roar, venting their grief, indignation, and despair.</p><p>Stimulated by this divine intent, the Celestial Earth Altar became even more solidified and dazzling.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang's movements paused. He closed his eyes slightly, carefully sensing the Celestial Earth Altar.</p><p>Back in the glorious days of the Daoist sect, the Talisman Dao and the Deity Dao coexisted, the former no less inferior than the latter.</p><p>The Deity Dao produced a Chengtian Emulating Earth Sovereign.</p><p>Within the Talisman Dao, the Ministry of Battles not only deduced the Four Saints of the North Pole, whose positions were equivalent to the Thunder Ancestor, but also achieved what the Ministry of Thunder couldn't—deduced the Talisman Deity of the Second Step of Cave True, the Gouchen Supreme Palace Celestial Emperor.</p><p>His position was equal to the Chengtian Emulating Earth Sovereign!</p><p>The Four Saints of the North Pole were destroyed in the chaos of that year, but the Gouchen Emperor remained!</p><p>But with his current cultivation, summoning the Gouchen Emperor was no easy feat.</p><p>Moreover, he couldn't be like True Monarch Wei before, possessing only the power of a single strike.</p><p>The Divine Court emerged, the world barrier would disappear.</p><p>This world would return to the Great Thousand!</p><p>The hope of the Daoist sect rested solely on him.</p><p>He had to gather the power of the Daoist sect, transform into the Gouchen Emperor, control the Talisman Deity, resist external enemies, awe the wicked, and lead the Daoist sect to establish itself in the Great Thousand, protecting the millions behind him!</p><p>"The hearts of the people can be used!"</p><p>True Monarch Zhang's expression shifted slightly. He opened his lips and recited another proclamation.</p><p>"Purple Subtlety Zenith, Gouchen Celestial Palace.</p><p>Within the Nine Lights Treasure Garden, above the Five Supreme Palaces.</p><p>Embodying the Primordial Emperor and assisting in the profound transformations, governing the Two Poles and jointly managing the Three Powers.</p><p>Presiding over the balance of military might, widely promoting great virtue;</p><p>Ruling over the constellations, never deviating from the constant path.</p><p>Supreme image, lofty and grand, true essence vast and boundless.</p><p>Great compassion, great vows, Great Sage, Great Mercy.</p><p>Gouchen Supreme Palace, Celestial Emperor!"</p><p>Ten thousand cultivators chanted together, the sound resounding all the way to the celestial realm!</p><p>Within the Divine Court, in the Purple Subtlety Enclosure, a divine hall suddenly emitted divine light. The sacred image within the hall was complete, infinitely majestic, unlike the Thunder Ancestor's, which was covered in cracks.</p><p>After the heavenly thunder, celestial phenomena appeared in the sky once more.</p><p>The moonlight dimmed as if entering deep night.  The hidden stars appeared one after another, their light intersecting, the constellations arrayed.</p><p>This was the night sky familiar to all beings on earth.</p><p>However, the stars at this moment were brighter than ever before.  The stellar river was brilliant, densely and sparsely arranged, and even the dimmest stars were clearly visible, seemingly within reach.</p><p>Starlight filled the heavens!</p><p>It was not just starlight, but the manifestation of the Divine Court's power.</p><p>With the Thirty-Two Heavens as the frame, the Twenty-Eight Constellations as the wheels, the Seven Luminaries as the carriage, the sun and moon as the reins, the North Pole as the pivot, encompassing all directions, branches connected to roots!</p><p>Within the position of the Three Enclosures, in the Purple Subtlety Enclosure, it was as if a palace with multiple stories appeared—this was the position of the Heavenly Heart, the Emperor's residence.</p><p>The starlight from all over the sky converged on the Purple Subtlety Enclosure, the stars of the Big Dipper particularly dazzling.</p><p>The Big Dipper was known as the Emperor's Chariot.</p><p>As the Dipper turned and the stars shifted, the handle pointed directly at the Celestial Earth Altar.</p><p>In the next moment, the starlight descended, truly transforming into an Imperial Chariot.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The chariot traversed the celestial river, descending from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Atop the altar, light shone brilliantly.</p><p>True Monarch Zhang, bathed in starlight, transformed into the Gouchen Emperor.</p><p>The Imperial Crown adorned his head, the sea of stars incorporated into his robe.  He boarded the Imperial Chariot and ascended to the Nine Heavens!</p><p>Passing by the gates of the Divine Court.</p><p>The Imperial Chariot stopped.</p><p>Celestial Venerable Tianyue and the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon, locked in battle, ceased their fighting and gazed at the Imperial Chariot, their expressions varied.</p><p>From beginning to end, the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon hadn't managed to set foot within the Divine Court!</p><p>True Monarch Zhang gave Celestial Venerable Tianyue a solemn bow, then looked at the Five-Clawed Golden Dragon and shouted, "Evil creature, surrender yourself!"</p><p>The Five-Clawed Golden Dragon's expression was desolate. Knowing the situation was hopeless, it could no longer muster the will to resist.</p><p>Its dragon body prostrated, its ferocity gone.</p><p>"I beg the Celestial Master for forgiveness!"</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
