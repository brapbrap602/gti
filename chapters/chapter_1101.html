<h1>Chapter 193 Peach Blossoms</h1><p>“This…”</p><p>Qin Sang examined his dantian, observing the grey energy.  The grey energy, which had always quietly resided within him, was actually the spirit sword's spirit, and it was anything but peaceful, wreaking havoc while he was unconscious.</p><p>“I don’t know if the spirit counts as acknowledging you as its master, but you should be more vigilant in the future.  However, this might not be a bad thing. Once the spirit awakens, you can easily discover the locations of the other spirit sword fragments and gather this astonishing cultivation technique!”</p><p>Qing Zhu sighed with emotion. He had persevered until this point to help Qin Sang obtain this technique and support the next generation. His unfinished immortal path would be continued by Qin Sang, and with great hope!</p><p>Qin Sang struggled to process so much information. He didn’t know whether to be excited or relieved. But he still had one question.</p><p>Before the teleportation, the spirit had already entered his body. When exactly had that happened?</p><p>It definitely wasn't in the grand hall of the sword path where the ancient teleportation array was located. Otherwise, since Qing Zhu and he had both cultivated the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang*, the spirit wouldn't have ignored Qing Zhu to find him, a latecomer.</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered being detained in the bronze hall by Dongyang Bo – the same place where Master Chen Yan disappeared – and used to threaten Chen Yan.</p><p>Before that, he could be certain that nothing was amiss with his body; the spirit couldn’t have infiltrated silently.  Only then had Dongyang Bo sealed Qin Sang’s entire body with禁符 (prohibition talismans).</p><p>Had the spirit been hidden in that bronze hall all along, waiting for someone who had cultivated the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* before secretly entering his body?</p><p>The more Qin Sang thought about it, the more likely it seemed.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang’s account, Qing Zhu mused, “Possible! The Seven Killing Hall, the Ziwei Palace… they all have a strong connection to the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* and the spirit sword fragments… Unfortunately, I can’t accompany you. You’ll have to explore on your own later.”</p><p>Qing Zhu patted Qin Sang on the shoulder and briefly recounted the subsequent events.</p><p>“After sending you and the spirit away, I intended to retrieve the spirit sword fragments and the technique. However, the demonic soul grew suspicious and searched the sword energy hall relentlessly, lingering there. If I had forcefully broken the barrier, the commotion would have alerted the demonic soul, and I was no match for him at the time. I would have fallen into his hands before obtaining the spirit sword fragments. This stalemate continued until the Seven Killing Hall closed, forcing me to abandon the attempt and leave the inner hall.”</p><p>“Afterward, I searched both great seas for the demonic soul, discovering that the seal was weakening as his cultivation improved. Moreover, the demonic soul frequently changed identities, seemingly plotting something.  If I couldn’t wait for the inner hall to reappear, the seal would break, and I had to find a way to counterattack.”</p><p>“Then, the Witch tribe opened the outer hall for the first time. I left a jade slip in the sword path to lure the demonic soul to Linggui Island.  Simultaneously, I misled the demonic soul, making him believe that his true identity was my sword spirit, preventing him from consuming me first.”</p><p>“I actively lured the demonic soul into my body, personally controlling the spirit sword fragments, and the seal indeed stabilized.”</p><p>“Before that, I sent my sword spirit incarnation into the Heavenly Dao Sect. If the incarnation failed to break through, I would use the Earth Blood Ginseng to create an external Nascent Soul to retrieve another spirit sword fragment. With the power of two spirit sword fragments, I could reseal the demonic soul.”</p><p>“However, the situation was far more complicated than I imagined. The demonic soul attempted to release an ancient demon, wreaking havoc throughout the cultivation world and provoking various factions. I could only watch, unable to do anything. When the Witch tribe opened the Seven Killing Hall a second time, I intended to use you to send out a message, but was stopped by the demonic soul.  Then came the events on Yitian Peak…”</p><p>After hearing Qing Zhu's story, Qin Sang sighed. He never expected that Senior Qing Zhu had experienced so many twists and turns, surpassing even his own.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Qin Sang softly said, “Senior… is there any message you would like me to convey?”</p><p>Though cruel, Qin Sang had to ask. He sensed that Qing Zhu’s condition was deteriorating.</p><p>“Don’t grieve for me! After I die, just send my body back. They’ve waited for me for many years and can finally reunite in the afterlife.  As for Qing Jun, there’s no need for further words…”</p><p>Qing Zhu shook his head.  “To her, I failed in my duty. I am merely her biological father, nothing more.”</p><p>Qing Zhu walked to the edge of the Netherworld Valley, gazing for a long time before turning to Qin Sang. “Having dedicated yourself to the ethereal path of immortality, have you ever regretted it?”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, but shook his head without hesitation.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Qing Zhu offered a word of praise.</p><p>He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze distant, unfocused, a hint of reminiscence and reflection in his eyes.</p><p>"Do you remember the Crimson Peach?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Of course he remembered. The Crimson Peach of Jianmen Pass in Shaohua Mountain, sweeter than any spirit fruit. It was then that he first heard the legends of Elder Qingzhu, and now he would witness the legend's end.</p><p>"It's been many years since I last tasted one,"</p><p>Qingzhu murmured.</p><p>He had searched everywhere for the peach seed, hoping to cultivate Crimson Peaches on Spirit Turtle Island, but they never tasted like the ones he remembered.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something.  He quickly searched his storage ring and found a few peach pits.  Years ago, he'd wanted to grow Crimson Peaches in his cave, so he had collected a few, keeping them until now.</p><p>Qin Sang planted the pits in the earth mound and asked Elder Qingzhu to infuse them with life force using his Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>The pits sprouted roots, then buds, branches, and leaves, growing into a peach tree at an astonishing speed.  </p><p>In an instant,</p><p>Peach blossoms bloomed!</p><p>Their fragrance filled the valley.</p><p>Then, the blossoms fell, replaced by green fruit that blushed crimson, finally ripening into Crimson Peaches!</p><p>A bountiful harvest!</p><p>Vibrant and beautiful!</p><p>Such a miracle could only occur in the world of cultivators.</p><p>The peach tree continued to grow, its branches spreading, its blossoms perpetually blooming.</p><p>Qingzhu stopped infusing life force, staring at the tree with softened eyes. He nodded to Qin Sang, gently picking a Crimson Peach.</p><p>He took a bite, savoring the taste, then sighed, "It's a fast-growing fruit, lacking the depth of flavor from age."</p><p>Qin Sang ate one as well, agreeing, "It's not as sweet as the ones from Jianmen Pass."</p><p>"You haven't tasted the best ones," Qingzhu said regretfully.</p><p>Nevertheless, Qingzhu finished the entire peach.</p><p>"Go,"</p><p>Qingzhu said.</p><p>Qin Sang, with a hint of worry, glanced at Qingzhu before flying towards the Nether Valley.</p><p>As Qin Sang disappeared into the Nether Qi, Qingzhu summoned his spirit sword, unleashing a breathtaking sword energy to clear a path for Qin Sang.</p><p>He chanted softly,</p><p>"With my sword, I cleave the Nether, may your next life know no hardship!"</p><p>The sword energy carved a path, breaking through ancient prohibitions.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the depths of the Nether Valley.</p><p>As Qingzhu had said, there was a cultivation technique,  "Chapter on Soul Cultivation and Sword Nurturing," within.</p><p>After obtaining the technique, Qin Sang flew out of the Nether Valley, landing on the earth mound.  He unconsciously slowed his pace.</p><p>Qin Sang saw</p><p>Several lines of writing on the stone wall, left by Elder Qingzhu:</p><p>—</p><p>A small courtyard, full of peach blossoms</p><p>A clear pond, pure as jade</p><p>An elder sister, eighteen years of age</p><p>A younger sister, still a child</p><p>A lifetime pursuing immortality, yet unsure where the grave will lie</p><p>Why not</p><p>Live by the mountains and water, farm and sail</p><p>Catch a demon or ghost, tell fortunes</p><p>—</p><p>The inscription, written in elegant swordsmanship, imbued with the essence of the sword.  A fragment of a spirit sword was embedded in the stone wall, along with a message: The sword is gifted to Daoist Friend Qin.</p><p>Qin Sang saw</p><p>Qingzhu, embracing his peachwood sword, resting peacefully beneath the peach tree.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew,</p><p>Petals danced and fell.</p><p>(End of Volume Two!)</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>1. I stayed home today and didn't go anywhere. I wrote four chapters to finish this volume, posting them all at once to make up for the previous two missing chapters.  Consider this my New Year's greeting to all of you, my readers.</p><p>Happy New Year! May all your wishes come true!</p><p>2. Volume Two is renamed "Peach Blossoms".</p><p>3. Volume Three is tentatively titled "Ascension".</p><p>4.  This volume basically contains everything I wanted to write, so there is no need for further explanation.</p><p>5. As you all have seen, the latter part of this volume was very challenging to write, but I finally finished it, and I feel quite a sense of accomplishment.  However, I feel completely drained and now I just want to sleep for a long time.  I'll take a two- or three-day break (depending on how I recover) to coincide with the New Year and the end of this volume.</p>
