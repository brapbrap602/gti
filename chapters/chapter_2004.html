<h1>Chapter 1995: The Heavenly Sea God's Eye</h1><p>The Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven was a realm of vegetation, a kingdom of plants. It wasn't surprising to find flora that had attained sentience.</p><p>Qin Sang also sensed the presence of these nature spirits.</p><p>The four cultivators changed direction, flew for a hundred miles, and hovered in mid-air, overlooking the ground below.</p><p>Beneath them stretched a boundless expanse of green. Giant, fan-like leaves, layered upon each other in dense profusion, spread out over hundreds of miles, forming an impenetrable canopy.</p><p>‘Pit-pat-pit-pat…’</p><p>Torrential rain hammered against the green leaves, only to be deflected. The rainwater trickled down the intricate veins of the foliage.</p><p>These veins were unique, forming channels between the leaves, gathering rainwater from a wide area and directing it toward a central point.</p><p>It was easy to imagine waterfalls cascading down beneath the leaves, while the rest of the area, sheltered by the canopy, remained untouched by the raging storm.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed numerous small creatures dwelling beneath the leaves, living as dependents of the giant plant.</p><p>The Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven was not devoid of insects and beasts, but they were small, clearly overshadowed by the dominant flora of this Minor Thousand World.</p><p>The ceaseless ocean storms, powerful enough to draw up water from the deep sea and hurl it skyward, made survival a constant struggle for the scaly creatures.</p><p>Over countless years, this, along with other factors, had shaped the current ecosystem.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Beyond the area covered by the green leaves, the earth suddenly quaked, creating widespread chaos.</p><p>A mountain-like shadow was rushing towards them, driving hordes of insects and beasts into a panicked flight.</p><p>It was as if the shadow were a terrifying predator, capable of devouring them all.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, it became clear that the shadow was neither a mountain nor a beast, but a towering tree.</p><p>The tree's root system was incredibly developed, resembling thick legs. A massive trunk, hundreds of feet tall, rose from the ground, its branches replaced by flexible vines covered in sharp thorns. Impaled on some of these thorns were the carcasses of wild beasts.</p><p>The thorns were hollow, piercing into the bodies of their prey and writhing as they sucked out the flesh and blood, quickly leaving behind nothing but dried husks.</p><p>The vines flailed wildly, blood and rainwater mingling and streaming down the tree's body, giving it a demonic appearance.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>With nowhere else to go, the insects and beasts swarmed beneath the green leaves, the giant tree hot on their heels.</p><p>Its sharp thorns, its most formidable weapons, tried to pierce the leafy canopy, attempting to tear it apart.</p><p>However, the leaves proved remarkably resilient.  A vine lashed out, but instead of penetrating, it was flung back with a resounding thud.</p><p>The tree seemed momentarily stunned. Its thick roots gripped the rocks tightly as its trunk swayed violently, halting its advance before turning to flee.</p><p>Just then, a whip-like shadow shot out from beneath the leaves, striking the tree with lightning speed.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The tree was sent flying, caught and bound mid-air by the whip shadow.  A loud 'bang' echoed as the tree exploded, crushed by the constricting force.</p><p>Immediately after, countless tiny white tendrils emerged from beneath the leaves, enveloping the tree fragments and retracting back into the foliage.</p><p>The leaves trembled slightly, then returned to normal, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>"Mid-Nascent Soul stage," Winning Patriarch said.</p><p>He was referring to the leaves, whose cultivation was comparable to a human cultivator at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>The tree was merely a nascent tree spirit, newly awakened. Since arriving on the continent, they had seen many similar trees. Even before attaining sentience, they were mobile, hunting and preying on insects, beasts, and even other plants – apex predators of their environment.</p><p>Of course, the true rulers of the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven were the powerful tree spirits, like the one with the giant leaves.</p><p>The leaves that stretched for hundreds of miles all belonged to a single ancient tree, a tree spirit that had reached the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Although the four cultivators hadn't deliberately concealed their auras, they were far beyond the perception of this tree spirit, allowing them to scan the area with their divine sense without fear.</p><p>"Its intelligence seems rather limited," Patriarch Yu also observed.</p><p>In the Greater Thousand World, except for certain unique races, tree spirits that reached the Nascent Soul stage generally possessed intelligence comparable to humans.</p><p>They continued their flight, soon encountering several other Nascent Soul stage tree spirits.</p><p>These tree spirits varied in size, each with its own territory. Some were rooted in place, while others moved around.</p><p>They possessed intelligence, but it was limited.  Some, even at the Nascent Soul stage, were still driven primarily by instinct.</p><p>The four continued flying and conversing, soon coming upon a mountain.</p><p>It was the highest peak they had seen since arriving on the continent. Its summit, surrounded by sheer cliffs, seemed to pierce the sky.</p><p>Neither wind nor rain could touch this mountain.</p><p>Enveloped by the storm, the mountain formed a hollow space, allowing a single beam of sunlight to illuminate its peak.</p><p>At the summit, a red plum tree stood in full bloom, a picturesque scene.</p><p>They had already sensed a presence on this mountain, an aura comparable to the late-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Tree spirit, come forth and greet us!" Old Man Gu Yun called out.</p><p>A red light flickered at the base of the tree, revealing a dignified woman. She looked at them cautiously and asked, "Are you also immortals?"</p><p>She didn't communicate through mental projections but used human language.</p><p>"It seems you've met disciples from the Radiant Heaven Sect. No wonder you know how to assume human form. What did they tell you? Did they claim to be immortals descending from the heavens?" Old Man Gu Yun asked with a strange smile.</p><p>To the inhabitants of a Minor Thousand World, Void Refinement cultivators were no different from immortals, but in the Greater Thousand World, no one would dare to claim such a title.</p><p>"They said that immortals would one day take control of this world, guide its inhabitants, and offer us a way out," the woman replied, then asked again, "Are you them?"</p><p>"You could say so. What is your name? How many others in this world possess cultivation comparable to yours?" Old Man Gu Yun inquired.</p><p>"My name is Hong Mei," the woman answered without hesitation. "There are four other fellow Daoists with similar cultivation. We have an agreement, each occupying the center and the four cardinal directions of the continent."</p><p>Patriarch Yu interjected, "Come with us and gather them. Tell us about this world as we go."</p><p>Hong Mei hesitated for a moment, then waved her sleeve, releasing a cloud of red mist that enveloped the plum tree.  Moments later, the tree vanished, and Hong Mei flew up to join them, her expression a mixture of anticipation and apprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances. Hong Mei's intelligence was not low, but her nature seemed somewhat naive.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun expanded the white cloud beneath their feet, allowing Hong Mei to join them.</p><p>As they flew, they listened to Hong Mei's explanations, combining her knowledge with their own observations to gain a better understanding of the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven.</p><p>The Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven consisted of a single continent surrounded by a vast ocean.  There were no Deity Transformation stage cultivators here. The five most powerful beings, all at the late-Nascent Soul stage, were plant spirits.</p><p>According to Hong Mei, there had never been any recorded Deity Transformation stage cultivators in this world. The Deity Transformation stage seemed to be an insurmountable barrier for the inhabitants of this world.</p><p>There was a legend in this world that anyone who could break through this barrier would ascend to the Immortal Realm.</p><p>In fact, this legend wasn't entirely inaccurate. Like the Storm Realm, anyone who reached the Deity Transformation stage would sense the Beacon Gate and be able to enter the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>Qin Sang and the three others communicated through voice transmissions.</p><p>"It's possible that no one has ever reached the Deity Transformation stage in this world. Otherwise, after entering the Greater Thousand World, they could establish a Daoist lineage, claim a world as their own, and develop a considerable force. Yet we've never heard of such a thing."</p><p>"Indeed. It's said that many sects in the Greater Thousand World were founded by ascendants from Minor Thousand Worlds, relying on their original worlds as a foundation to gradually establish themselves in the Greater Thousand World."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the Storm Realm and the countless Minor Thousand Worlds he had seen in the River of Sin.</p><p>A normal Minor Thousand World, after producing an ascendant, would benefit from their return, establishing a connection with the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>Unlike the Storm Realm, where ascendants had to face life-or-death trials before finding the Beacon Gate.</p><p>And then there were the Minor Thousand Worlds in the River of Sin.  Even if an ascendant was rescued by the Ferryman, they were left adrift in the Greater Thousand World, with little hope of ever finding their way back home.</p><p>These Minor Thousand Worlds, without the support of their ascendants, would eventually deplete their resources, unable to produce new ascendants. They would silently decline, like an old tree that could no longer bear fruit, eventually withering away.</p><p>"Limited intelligence, difficulty in breaking through to the Deity Transformation stage… it might be related to the fragmented nature of this Minor Thousand World…"</p><p>"These plant spirits, born from this unique environment, might possess special innate talents and divine abilities. If nurtured properly, they could offer unexpected benefits. We could selectively recruit them into our sects."</p><p>"I wonder if the Radiant Heaven Sect has explored those restricted areas that Hong Mei mentioned…"</p><p>"This is likely the extent of the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven's value."</p><p>"There are no sects here, meaning the mineral veins and spiritual materials haven't been extensively mined. We can use them for the development of our sects."</p><p>"This place is ideal for plant growth. There must be valuable spiritual herbs…"</p><p>"Most tree spirits are ferocious by nature. Their bodies are essentially high-quality spiritual wood, and this world could serve as a training ground for our disciples."</p><p>"Indeed. We can spread our teachings here, nurture more Nascent Soul stage tree spirits, and allow our Core Formation disciples to train here as well."</p><p>"Yes! But we must not overexploit this world, lest we incite resentment.  When they reach a certain cultivation level, or achieve designated merits, we can bring them to the Greater Thousand World and accept them into our sects."</p><p>…</p><p>The four of them discussed the Azure Sky Grotto-Heaven, making plans for its future management.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Just then, Patriarch Yu suddenly stopped them, flying off at an angle. A peculiar sight emerged on the ground below.</p><p>Countless white, python-like roots crawled across the earth, intertwined and densely packed, stretching as far as the eye could see. In the center of this network stood a slender, person-high green plant.</p><p>This was the root system of a Nascent Soul stage tree spirit. The plant itself was that delicate green sprout, while its roots formed a vast subterranean sea.</p><p>Patriarch Yu made no attempt to conceal himself as he entered the tree spirit's territory, immediately provoking its wrath.</p><p>The roots began to writhe frantically, resembling a giant nest of snakes, a sight that sent chills down one's spine.</p><p>Hong Mei's lips moved slightly, sending out a calming mental message to the tree spirit.</p><p>Patriarch Yu extended a finger and pointed. A large section of the intertwined roots untangled themselves, revealing a fiery red valley.</p><p>Within the valley grew numerous trees, resembling maple trees in shape.</p><p>"Five-Pointed Maples."</p><p>Patriarch Yu exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>"Are you certain they're Five-Pointed Maples?" Old Man Gu Yun scrutinized the trees, finding them quite different from the Five-Pointed Maples described in ancient texts.</p><p>Five-Pointed Maples had leaves with five points, corresponding to the five elements.</p><p>"Do you doubt the expertise of my Ancient Grain Garden?" Patriarch Yu pointed towards the roots. "They must have mutated due to the environment, but their innate properties remain. Extend your divine sense and follow their roots. Don't they lead directly into a spiritual vein?"</p><p>The others did as instructed, confirming his words.</p><p>"No wonder the spiritual energy here is so abundant! These trees can connect to spiritual veins, harmonizing the spiritual energy of a Daoist lineage. Over time, they can enhance the spiritual environment without the need for spirit arrays. They're among the best spiritual trees to cultivate within a sect's grounds, rare even in the Greater Thousand World."</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun offered a detailed explanation, then looked at Qin Sang. "Daoist Priest, you can transplant these trees to your Green Ram Temple."</p><p>Patriarch Yu and Winning Patriarch didn't object to Old Man Gu Yun's suggestion. Their sects were ancient, possessing various methods of harmonizing spiritual energy. Moreover, the spiritual energy within their sect grounds was already stable, and they didn't lack a few Five-Pointed Maples.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't refuse. He cupped his hands in thanks, then made a grasping motion with his hand, uprooting the majority of the Five-Pointed Maples.</p><p>The remaining roots stirred uneasily.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his finger, sending a beam of azure light towards the small green plant.  Upon contact with the light, the plant swayed violently, expressing its excitement and elation.</p><p>The azure light contained a cultivation method suitable for plant spirits, a reward for the Five-Pointed Maples.</p><p>The discovery of the Five-Pointed Maples ignited their interest.</p><p>The Radiant Heaven Sect clearly hadn't plundered this world completely. There might be even rarer spiritual treasures to be found.</p><p>Eventually, they summoned the five late-Nascent Soul stage tree spirits, gathering information about this world from them.</p><p>"We four come from four different sects in the Greater Thousand World. From now on, this world will be under our jurisdiction. When the beings of this world achieve sufficient cultivation, they can join us in the Greater Thousand World for further cultivation.  You five, choose a sect to join.  Our three sects will each take one, and two will follow Daoist Priest Qing Feng," Old Man Gu Yun instructed.</p><p>The territories of the five spirits were roughly equal in size. The four sects would divide the land accordingly, each exploiting their own resources.</p><p>"I will follow Immortal Yu," a tree spirit, transformed into a large man, spoke first. Patriarch Yu's aura resonated with him.</p><p>Hong Mei hesitated for a moment, then said, "I want to join the Green Ram Temple."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly surprised. He could see that Old Man Gu Yun held Hong Mei in high regard, yet she chose to follow him instead.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Hong Mei had observed the subtle deference shown to Qin Sang by the other three during their journey.  Moreover, Qin Sang had been granted two territories, indicating that the Green Ram Temple was likely the most powerful among them.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly understood her reasoning, thinking to himself that the plum spirit was not without cunning, though she had miscalculated.</p><p>"I'll join Elder Sister Hong Mei," the only flower spirit immediately added.</p><p>Of the five spirits, the only two who had taken female forms both chose to join the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Not in a hurry to explore the resources within their territories, Qin Sang and the others were more interested in the restricted areas mentioned by the five spirits.</p><p>This world likely didn't contain ancient sect ruins. The restricted areas were probably naturally occurring dangerous locations.</p><p>There were four major restricted areas and seven minor ones.</p><p>The major restricted areas were places even the five spirits dared not approach.</p><p>Two major and three minor restricted areas were located on land, and all had been explored by the Radiant Heaven Sect. However, the sect had only plundered the terrestrial restricted areas.</p><p>Therefore, the four cultivators headed out to sea.</p><p>The northern sea had the fiercest storms and the most restricted areas: one major and three minor.</p><p>Not far from the shore, they reached a minor restricted area.  Without even entering, they could clearly see everything within.</p><p>"So this is where the Severing Hook Divine Wind is formed."</p><p>"Indeed. We can have our disciples train their divine sense here, but we'll need to set up some protective measures…"</p><p>They didn't linger, continuing to fly north, soaring over towering waves, until they witnessed a breathtaking celestial phenomenon.</p><p>A furious wind howled, spiraling wildly, carrying vast amounts of seawater skyward, forming a colossal waterspout. The scene was awe-inspiring, as if the vortex were trying to drain the entire northern sea.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The wind was razor-sharp, and the spiritual energy was in turmoil, forming gale winds even more potent than the Severing Hook Divine Wind, capable of shredding Nascent Soul cultivators to pieces. No wonder the five spirits dared not approach.</p><p>"This is the Heavenly Sea God's Eye. Truly magnificent!"</p><p>"Likely a phenomenon caused by the shattering of the Grotto-Heaven."</p><p>…</p><p>The cultivators admired the Heavenly Sea God's Eye, treating the terrifying celestial phenomenon as a scenic wonder. They passed through the gale winds and entered the eye of the storm.</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>Thanks to Bigshot Bi Cang Zhe Tian for the generous Alliance Leader donation!</p>
