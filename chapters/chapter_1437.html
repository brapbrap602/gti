<h1>Chapter 1429: The Demon-Subduing Pestle</h1><p>Disaster struck the Kong Ling Sea.</p><p>Countless cultivators watched in horror.</p><p>Flames erupted, shooting straight into the sky.</p><p>Some Golden Core cultivators who failed to escape were engulfed by the inferno.</p><p>The Jing Hai Sect was completely overturned by the inferno.  Remaining land fragments were tossed above the sea surface; some fragments still bore pavilions and temples, with glowing Buddhist prohibitions, but all were rapidly consumed by the flames.</p><p>Nearby cultivators saw figures emerging from the wreckage.</p><p>These Nascent Soul cultivators, far from perishing, displayed their various abilities, and before retreating, they even snatched treasures thrown up by the inferno.  The situation was critical; regardless of the treasure's grade, they grabbed what they could and fled.</p><p>They swiftly retreated before the inferno's full might exploded.</p><p>The inferno brought a scorching storm, spreading with terrifying speed to the surrounding area, descending upon the lower-cultivation practitioners in their horrified gaze.</p><p>Seawater boiled.</p><p>Giant waves crashed.</p><p>Ships that failed to escape were either capsized or shattered, consumed by flames.</p><p>Lower-cultivation practitioners with insufficient cultivation were blown to pieces by the intense storm, dying in terror.  Only in their final moments did they recall an ancient adage in the cultivation world—stay away from high-level cultivators, especially battlefields involving Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Scenes of carnage unfolded ceaselessly.</p><p>In the air,</p><p>Hun Mo Laoren, unlike others scrambling to seize the Jing Hai Sect's treasures, had dark pupils, surveying his surroundings like a hawk.  But ultimately, he couldn't locate the suspicious figure.</p><p>…</p><p>Southeast of the Kong Ling Sea.</p><p>This area was already outside the Kong Ling Sea; occasionally, one could see occupied islands, where many cultivators were active.</p><p>Two figures sped discreetly across the sea, seemingly on guard against something.</p><p>After a while,</p><p>Endless blue waves stretched around them; not even a deserted island was in sight.</p><p>"Senior's water palace is here."</p><p>The burly, rough-looking man, after observing for a moment, pointed ahead. He flew forward and dove beneath the surface.</p><p>The other person followed closely.</p><p>These two were Qin Sang and Tan Hao.</p><p>It was the fourth day after the Jing Hai Sect battle.</p><p>After leaving the Jing Hai Sect that day, Qin Sang suppressed his injuries, and without looking back, he fled with Tan Hao, never stopping, never seeking out Mu Valley Master, and remained unaware of how the Jing Hai Sect matter concluded.</p><p>They were now searching for Gui Mu's former cave.</p><p>Tan Hao had stayed there for a while when he followed Gui Mu to the North Sea.</p><p>This cave remained undiscovered for so long, demonstrating its secrecy.  Qin Sang could heal here, sort through his spoils, and plan his next steps.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The two hadn't descended far when they saw a hidden island beneath the sea.</p><p>Tan Hao tried a spell; a faint glow flickered at the island's center, then a door materialized.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Tan Hao inside, discovering several stone chambers filled with intensely rich spiritual energy. But the furnishings were extremely simple; some chambers were completely empty.</p><p>"Senior Gui Mu hasn't returned."</p><p>Tan Hao checked several doors before reporting back.</p><p>"It seems she has indeed left the North Sea."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded without expectation, casually chose a chamber, then paused. "Brother Tan, how are your injuries?"</p><p>"After taking some spirit pills, I'm fine.  Thanks to Brother Qin for blocking the inferno," Tan Hao recalled their final encounter that day, still somewhat fearful, but also excited.</p><p>Because he and Qin Sang had successfully snatched treasures from under the noses of powerful cultivators!</p><p>Qin Sang hummed.  "I remember you said you'd been active nearby and had some contacts; you shouldn't be suspected.  Once things calm down, go out and gather information.  I shouldn't appear for now.  Yes, see if Qi and Wang's descendants are making any moves.  Hun Mo Laoren might target them; be careful and avoid direct contact."</p><p>Qin Sang was still concerned about the Ascending Spirit Festival, but wasn't planning to visit Hundred Flower Valley yet.</p><p>The movements of Qi and Wang's descendants would reveal the outcome of the great battle—whether anyone survived.</p><p>Three against two.</p><p>At the last moment, I seized the opportunity to guide the power of the Thousand Buddha Wall, and managed to create an opening for them.  At least one should have escaped, right?</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Tan Hao nodded.  "I'll go out in a few days."</p><p>"Also, help me find out about those in the Boundless Sea skilled in alchemy or any relevant forces…"</p><p>Qin Sang considered the tasks ahead, finally saying, "Your Demon-Subduing Pestle, though a Buddhist treasure, can also be used by cultivators outside the Buddhist sect.  As it's specialized for killing, its abilities might be single-minded, but its power is enhanced because of it."</p><p>Even though it's a top-grade magical artifact, once you completely refine it, it should be able to unleash power comparable to a top-tier artifact..."</p><p>He had obtained the treasure, a staff called the Demon-Subduing Staff, from the Buddhist temple.</p><p>Tan Hao's face lit up with joy at the news. With this artifact, after his breakthrough, he would no longer fear those established Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang's tone shifted, and he smiled, "Let's leave it with me for now. I'll see if I can alter the Demon-Subduing Staff's form. Otherwise, even if I gave it to you, you wouldn't dare use it publicly, unless you want to risk being discovered by the 混魔老人's minions."</p><p>Tan Hao shuddered at the thought of being targeted by the 混魔老人.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang closed the door and set up a protective barrier. He summoned his Yuan Ying spirit puppet. The puppet was charred, with no obvious external injuries, but a large part of the puppet seal had collapsed.</p><p>After examining it, Qin Sang exclaimed, "The puppet's injuries are comparable to when it was just retrieved from the storm zone.  Ah, following me has caused you so much suffering."</p><p>He gently stroked it before setting the Yuan Ying spirit puppet aside.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring flashed.</p><p>Streams of light fell to the ground like flowing water.</p><p>"This is truly an unprecedentedly bountiful harvest..."</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his hands together, eager to examine his treasures.</p><p>First, he carefully laid out the nine Wanling Fruits.</p><p>The fruits' luster was dim, but this didn't affect their efficacy.</p><p>"There's plenty left over, it's a pity I didn't find the formula for refining Zhenling incense..."</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the 鬼母 might have taken it.  Dismissing the thought, he opened his spirit beast pouch and summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede curled up, its red glow pulsating faintly.</p><p>The injuries it sustained from the Three Spirits Pan Wang Formation required a long recovery period, and the centipede had been listless for the past few days.</p><p>Qin Sang opened a jade box, took out a Wanling Fruit, and recalling the feeding method described by Master Mu, gently channeled his true energy to pierce the fruit's skin.</p><p>The juice, brimming with vitality, flowed out, its fragrance intoxicating.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede suddenly sprang up straight, stiff as a rod.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled softly, setting up several protective barriers, refining a drop of the juice before feeding it to the Fire Jade Centipede, storing the remainder in a jade bottle.</p><p>The effect was immediate.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede's aura immediately stabilized, then, looking languid, it curled back into Qin Sang's palm, drowsy and beginning to digest the medicinal fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the process, refining two more Wanling Fruits and feeding them to the Sky Eye Butterfly and the Fat Silkworm respectively.</p>
