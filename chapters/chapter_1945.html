<h1>Chapter 1936: Seeing a Doctor</h1><p>Mingyue.</p><p>A common name, yet one Qin Sang cannot forget.</p><p>It's a memory from so long ago.</p><p>Qin Sang sees a young Taoist priest in his mind's eye, the image still vivid.</p><p>Mingyue, who helped him fetch a small wooden stool, examined his injured leg; Mingyue, who rejoiced when he learned that the Jixin Taoist had taken him in; Mingyue, who admired him for diverting the stream to the Taoist temple; Mingyue, who drooled watching him grill meat; Mingyue, who feasted with him in the city; Mingyue, who diligently studied Taoism, medicine, and martial arts; Mingyue, with whom he soaked in herbal baths; and Mingyue, who helped Jixin Taoist heal the sick and save people…</p><p>Alas, his sudden departure on that occasion became a final farewell.</p><p>Qin Sang gently stroked the Qianjun Ring.  The painting that Mingyue had drawn himself, he had kept it all these years.</p><p>The painting depicted him, a record of their joyful times.  Though he hadn’t witnessed it, he could imagine Mingyue’s expression as he painted.</p><p>The time spent at Qingyang Temple held pure, sincere emotions.</p><p>It was a brief yet exceptionally peaceful and tranquil period in Qin Sang's life, one he could never forget.</p><p>Everyone watched Qin Sang, wondering why he had suddenly stopped and then fell into a pensive silence.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the young man before him.</p><p>Many people are named Mingyue.</p><p>Yet, for some reason, this particular youth evoked those buried memories of his Mingyue.</p><p>Was it because of his innocent heart?</p><p>Based on Zhuque's description and what he'd seen and heard, Qin Sang, though unaware of the full story, could guess the general situation.</p><p>The youth dared to hunt down a demonic beast with his mortal body to avenge his master, and dared to reason with cultivators.  His courage was commendable.</p><p>But was that all?</p><p>Ah, this young man's talent was unremarkable – Gold, Fire, and Wood spiritual roots.</p><p>But even exceptional talent wasn't what moved Qin Sang. The world was vast, filled with countless mortals.  Finding someone with dual spiritual roots wouldn't be too difficult, even if finding someone with a superior spiritual root might take time.  And with Qin Sang's current abilities, he could even raise someone with five spiritual roots, although they might struggle later in their cultivation.</p><p>Reflecting on his life since leaving the mountain, perhaps he'd lived too long; whatever happened, he always associated it with old friends and past events, his sealed memories being constantly unearthed.</p><p>Since leaving the mountain, he has lived a carefree life, content wherever he went. This ease subtly mirrored the mindset he cultivated in Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Through repeated awakenings of these emotions, was he subconsciously seeking a repository for those memories?</p><p>This young man appeared, also named Mingyue.</p><p>Perhaps it was fate…</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>"I've been called Mingyue since I can remember; it's the name my parents gave me. My master said that when I came of age, he would give me a courtesy name," the youth answered honestly, his voice filled with sadness and resentment when speaking of his master.</p><p>The two immortals, who had been so arrogant just moments ago, now knelt on the ground, trembling.</p><p>Yet the youth would never forget what had just transpired.</p><p>"What is your surname?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Qin," replied the youth.</p><p>Qin Sang froze, then chuckled.  It really was fate!</p><p>"Would you like to follow me in the path of cultivation?" Qin Sang stopped thinking about trivial matters, following his heart.</p><p>Upon hearing this, not only Jingchun Taoist Priest, but even Zhuque was surprised.</p><p>Luohou and Taiyi were surprised and envious.</p><p>"Are you crazy?!"</p><p>Zhuque couldn't understand.  They had just watched a play, and now Qin Sang suddenly had a disciple?</p><p>During his travels, Qin Sang had never shown any intention of taking on a disciple.</p><p>"Just because his surname is Qin? This village seems to be called Qin Family Village, and everyone here has the surname Qin. Do you plan to take them all in and establish a Qin Family Temple?"</p><p>Zhuque flew in front of Qin Sang, her eyes wide, trying to figure out what he was thinking.  Qin Sang flicked her away with a finger.</p><p>This statement shocked everyone, leaving them speechless.</p><p>The two kneeling men were filled with despair.</p><p>The rules of Xinhuo Temple wouldn't kill them.</p><p>But they had offended a great cultivator's disciple, a great cultivator even the Jingchun Temple Master addressed as a senior!</p><p>If their master found out, he would likely not only fail to plead for them, but would expel them from the sect.</p><p>The youth himself was completely stunned.</p><p>Seeing the youth’s dazed state, the old village head, exasperated, slapped his head to the ground, "Hurry and kowtow to your Master!"</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A resounding thud brought the youth out of his stupor.</p><p>“Does one have to leave home to cultivate the Dao?”</p><p>“This Daoist travels the world. If you follow me to cultivate, naturally you must leave this place. Moreover, immortals and mortals are different; one day you must sever ties with the mortal world.”</p><p>“Immortals and mortals are different,” the boy murmured, repeating the four words.  Suddenly, he looked at the two people kneeling on the ground. “After cultivation, can I also possess the power of immortals?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew what the boy really wanted to ask. “They are not immortals, only cultivators; this Daoist is the same, only my cultivation is higher than theirs. They can bully ordinary people at will, and cultivators stronger than them can treat them the same way. That's just how the world is.”</p><p>“The world!”</p><p>The boy clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't say anything more. The boy was smart and would understand.</p><p>In the world, cultivators with a sincere heart like him must be numerous, but how many can maintain their original aspirations? After experiencing hardship, most people understand the importance of self-preservation.</p><p>Besides, can such a world really be changed?</p><p>Even a powerful cultivator at the highest level could only change things for a short time and in a limited place.</p><p>“I didn’t expect this Daoist to witness such a beautiful event.”</p><p>Seeing the situation, Abbot Jingchun interjected, “Young friend, you have been blessed in misfortune and will surely have a bright future.  Rest assured, go with the Daoist to cultivate.  I, Jinghuo, will personally protect Qin Village, and will absolutely not allow anyone to harm a single person there!”</p><p>He swept a sharp look at the two kneeling individuals.</p><p>“These two acted recklessly, violated the law, and will not be spared!”</p><p>The boy turned to look at the villagers and found a woman in the crowd.</p><p>The woman was his step-mother.  After his teacher’s death, she had been severely affected, her body weak, bedridden.  Following the recent upheaval, she had managed to get up and walk to the wall.</p><p>Seeing the boy lying on the ground, she almost fell from the shock, but Abbot Jingchun appeared in time to help.</p><p>The step-mother, supported by others, still looked scared and anxious.</p><p>Seeing Mingyue, she urged, “Mingyue, quickly go and meet your master.  If you succeed in life, your teacher will surely be happy for you in the afterlife. Many people are taking care of your step-mother, so don't worry.”</p><p>Tears in his eyes, the boy no longer hesitated, and kowtowed deeply. “Disciple greets Master.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, pondered for a moment and said, “Today, Master will give you a character on behalf of your former teacher.  From now on, you shall be called Yu Lang – your given name and Daoist name.”</p><p>Like jade in virtue, like the bright moon.</p><p>“Yu Lang, what a good name! What a good Daoist name! It is a great honor for our Jinghuo Temple that such a senior cultivator is taking a disciple under our jurisdiction. We must celebrate! Senior and fellow Daoists, please come to the Temple, let me show my humble gratitude…”</p><p>Abbot Jingchun was even more enthusiastic than Qin Sang, the master.</p><p>“Cultivators don’t need so much ceremony,” Qin Sang shook his head, handing Qin Yu Lang a jade bottle and transmitting his voice, “These pills can regulate your blood and prolong your life.  Say your farewells to your family and friends, Master will wait for you at the place where you fought the demon.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang and the others vanished from the villagers' sight, leaving Abbot Jingchun looking regretful.</p><p>“You really are taking a disciple?”</p><p>Zhu Que still didn't understand, landing on the mountaintop, continuing to ask questions.</p><p>“I do want to take a disciple, to find a younger brother for Xiao Wu. Isn’t that good?” Qin Sang ruffled Xiao Wu's hair.</p><p>In his mind, however, other faces appeared: Li Yu Fu, Mei Gu, Bai Hanqiu, Shen Chen…</p><p>How are they doing?</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded repeatedly, smiling happily.</p><p>“Why not find a genius with a superb spiritual root? This guy… though young, has courage, strategy, and is quite good. He has good character and knows how to respect his master…”</p><p>Zhu Que looked at the traces of the trap below the mountain, muttering, more worried than Qin Sang, the master.</p><p>“Are you evaluating someone else's character?” Qin Sang laughed. He was in a good mood after accepting a disciple.</p><p>Zhu Que was furious, “Just you wait, if I can’t beat you, I’ll beat your disciple!”</p><p>Less than an incense stick of time later, a figure ran up the mountain path, Yu Lang.</p><p>He carried a bundle almost bigger than himself. Luckily, he had practiced martial arts, otherwise he would have been crushed by the weight.</p><p>Seeing the figures on the mountain, Yu Lang felt a lightness under his feet, lifted by a gust of wind, landing before Qin Sang, still gasping for breath.</p><p>“Master,” Yu Lang put down his bundle, bowed respectfully, took out a short sword, and said uneasily, “This was given to me by Abbot Jingchun, I dare not accept it, but…”</p><p>“Since it is Abbot Jingchun's kindness, keep it.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it.  It was a fine top-grade magical weapon; Abbot Jingchun knew his limits.</p><p>“Master will introduce you…”</p><p>Qin Sang introduced his disciple one by one.</p><p>“Greetings to Senior Zhu Que, greetings to Senior Luo Hou, greetings to Senior Taiyi, greetings to Senior Sister…”</p><p>Yu Lang greeted each person with a respectful attitude.</p><p>Zhu Que was satisfied and no longer mentioned bullying Qin Sang's disciple, even giving a welcoming gift.</p><p>Along the way, slaying demons and eliminating evil, Zhu Que had privately kept many good things.</p><p>Taiyi and Luohou both presented gifts. Xiao Wu's gift was given by Qin Sang, who also produced a storage artifact, packed away miscellaneous items, and handed it to Yulang.</p><p>Yulang, despite not yet having achieved Dao, already possessed considerable wealth.  Recalling the hardships of his initial pursuit of the Dao, Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh.</p><p>Zhuque's moment of pride was short-lived; soon he was grumbling and back to being a mount.  Flying in the sky, Yulang, a mix of wonder and apprehension, sat stiffly, afraid to move. Qin Sang, meanwhile, pondered how to guide this new disciple.  Having accepted a student on a whim, he was only now considering the implications.</p><p>Achieving the Dao wasn't difficult; one could simply choose any of the three basic techniques—metal, fire, or wood. The path ahead, however, required careful consideration.  He possessed numerous lineages; aside from his own cultivation techniques, he had the complete lineage of the Wu Xiang Xianmen's Wood Aspect, seemingly ideal for Yulang.  The Dao Court's talisman technique was also a possibility. As a Commandant of the Five Thunder Academy, holding the Academy's seal, he could establish a teaching altar without needing the Heavenly Court's approval.</p><p>Daoist techniques predated both the Heavenly and Dao Courts.  However, he could only teach Thunder techniques, limited by his own cultivation level and unable to leverage the Heavenly Court's power.  Qin Sang didn't make an immediate decision; teaching required adapting to the student, and he still didn't know this disciple well enough.</p><p>"Study this 'Gentle Willow Heart Sutra'," Qin Sang wrote the scripture on paper, briefly explaining its meaning. Yulang was literate, saving a lot of trouble.  Taiyi and Luohou both listened intently as Qin Sang lectured, but the scripture's content was too elementary; even a Void Refinement cultivator couldn't embellish it, offering them nothing insightful.</p><p>They flew across mountains and rivers on Zhuque. The main altar drew closer.  Taiyi, gazing down at the landscape, seemed to recognize something.  "Sir Commandant, we're nearing Yan," he said.</p><p>"Yan is one of the strongest countries.  Yan and its neighboring states are the heart of the region, abundant in resources, with a strong economy and peaceful populace. When I first left my secluded dwelling to travel, I passed through those border states before arriving in Yan, expanding my knowledge considerably. I still remember it. I wonder if Yan has changed dynasties…" Taiyi sighed.</p><p>"Did you not find a Thunder Altar nearby?"</p><p>Taiyi pointed towards a secluded dwelling. "I only found the ruins of a Thunder Altar in Daliang, east of Yan.  Unfortunately, my experience is limited, and I couldn't distinguish between a branch altar and the main altar. I suspected that Yan and its neighboring states, being at the heart of the region, might hold special significance, but I found nothing."</p><p>"Were there no cultivators practicing Dao Court Thunder techniques near Yan?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"I found none," Taiyi shook his head.</p><p>Branch altars had left behind their legacies; the main altar, however, had not.  It seemed they would have to search themselves, Qin Sang mused.</p><p>"The main altar must be within Yan; the Daliang altar definitely isn't it. It's too badly damaged; there's no point going there!"</p><p>This time, Qin Sang could narrow the search to a single province.  With everyone's efforts, if the main altar left any trace, they would find it!</p><p>"What a huge river!"</p><p>Yulang, clutching Zhuque's feathers, looked down, filled with awe. He had become more comfortable with everyone, no longer as taciturn as before.</p><p>"Let's go down and have a look!"</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang spoke, Zhuque unceremoniously dumped them, squawking, "This Zhuque is exhausted!"</p><p>"This is the Ping River, flowing down from Daliang," Taiyi, revisiting familiar territory, remembered.</p><p>They landed, and Qin Sang sat down, preparing to make his final calculations to narrow down the area.</p><p>For three days, Qin Sang remained motionless.  On the evening of the third day, he stood up.  "Let's go! Let's meet the Ping River's river god."</p><p>Using the topography and waterways could aid his judgment, even if centuries of change might have altered the landscape, leaving behind some trace.</p><p>The River God Temple was within Yan, but not on this section of the river.  They flew along the river.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before reaching the water deity's abode, they made a peculiar discovery.  Something on the river was gleaming in the sunlight.</p><p>Although named the Ping River, the water wasn't calm at all. The glittering object turned out to be a block of ice floating on the surface.  And inside the ice… was a person, resembling a frozen corpse.</p>
