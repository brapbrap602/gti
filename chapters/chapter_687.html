<h1>Chapter 679: The Essence of the Jiao Dragon</h1><p>Chapter 679: The Essence of the Jiao Dragon</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of the outside gossip, was preparing for his refining work in the furnace room.</p><p>His first attempt had to be spectacular.  He could use the earth fire for less crucial steps, but the key processes absolutely required the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to guarantee success.</p><p>In the furnace room, an underground fire vein ran through the floor, though invisible from the surface.</p><p>At the center of the room was a circular pit, its walls built from neatly arranged square bricks engraved with nine fire phoenixes in various poses.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly recognized these as a sophisticated array, designed to stabilize and amplify the earth fire's power.</p><p>He inserted the talismans the guards had given him into the pit.  A phoenix shrieked, and the nine fire phoenixes seemed to come alive, their wings blazing crimson, their beaks spewing intensely hot flames – pure earth fire energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened slightly. He selected several unimportant materials from his pouch and tested them, finding the earth fire remarkably stable and surprisingly efficient; it consumed minimal spiritual energy.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang paused, remaining inactive for a full day, pondering how to best utilize the materials.</p><p>The next day, Qin Sang finally began. One after another, materials flowed into the earth fire for refining, then were meticulously categorized and set aside.</p><p>Throughout the process, Qin Sang would periodically interrupt the earth fire refining, taking out the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner and using the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to refine the more important materials.</p><p>When his spiritual energy was depleted, he would put away the banner, switch to the earth fire, and gradually recover.</p><p>This careful back-and-forth continued, with Qin Sang making the most of every moment.</p><p>…</p><p>Every evening, Ran Luo would visit the furnace room.  The continued lack of news worried her.</p><p>"Reporting to Steward Ran, Daoist Qingfeng has not yet emerged, nor given us any instructions."</p><p>The guards, diligent and unwavering, reported as soon as Ran Luo arrived.</p><p>Ran Luo nodded. "Continue your vigil. Report to me immediately if the Daoist emerges."</p><p>Turning to leave, Ran Luo heard a guard softly exclaim, "The Daoist is out…"</p><p>Her face brightened, and she hurried back.  She saw Qin Sang striding towards her. "Daoist, have you finished refining everything?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. "I have fulfilled my duty, please examine these."</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, five beams of light shot from his palm, hovering before Ran Luo.</p><p>Each beam encased a magical artifact: a pair of wings, a bone whip, an oddly shaped small drum, and two suits of armor – one leather, one bone.</p><p>All were exceptional artifacts!</p><p>Qin Sang had truly done his best, putting his ingenuity to the test, ultimately crafting five top-tier artifacts.</p><p>Artifacts used by cultivators in the Canglang Sea are invariably made from beast bones and hides, and these were no exception.</p><p>The wings were forged from several pairs of demonic bird wings; the whip from a section of the Jiao dragon bone; and the drum was uniquely crafted from several demonic beast skulls.  When activated, it unleashed spectral beast images that could assault the opponent's spirit.</p><p>Ran Luo examined each item, praising them repeatedly, finally convinced of Qin Sang's extraordinary refining skills.</p><p>"Oh, I almost forgot to inform Elder Zou."</p><p>Ran Luo gasped, quickly sending a message, then continued to admire the artifacts.</p><p>After a while, a peculiar expression flickered across Ran Luo's face.</p><p>She noticed that while the five artifacts were distinct, their power undeniable, they shared a peculiar quality: a faint chill, an intensely powerful aura similar to that of demonic or ghost-cultivation artifacts, a quality seemingly incongruous with their nature.</p><p>Even the wings, imbued with abundant fire energy, couldn’t completely suppress this icy presence.</p><p>Ran Luo subconsciously glanced at Qin Sang, filled with suspicion.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed her expression and wryly smiled.</p><p>He hadn't expected that the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire would leave its mark on the artifacts, imbuing them with an ineradicable chill.</p><p>This wasn't necessarily bad; it might even enhance their power.</p><p>But Qin Sang was frustrated. Ran Luo had already suspected him, and now, with these artifacts, his identity as a 'great demon' would likely be confirmed.</p><p>Luckily, the rigid distinctions between sects were less pronounced in the Demon Sea;  being labeled a demon would have to suffice.</p><p>If the Qiong Yu Trading Company rejects me because of this, it's no big deal.  There are plenty of other places for someone like me.</p><p>Qin Sang tossed a pouch to Ran Luo. "These are the remaining spirit materials refined into magical artifacts.  The quality varies, take them all."</p><p>By this time, Ran Luo had regained her composure.  Clearly, she had come to terms with it.  Whether Qin Sang was righteous or evil before didn't matter; as long as he could refine artifacts, that's all that counted.</p><p>Moments later, Elder Zou and the others arrived.  Seeing Qin Sang produce the five artifacts without any missing, their doubts vanished.  The young man surnamed Zhuo had nothing more to say, bowing to Qin Sang in apparent submission.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng," Elder Zou said, "as the chief steward of the Qiong Yu Trading Company, I invite you to become an external Sea Guest Elder of our company.  Henceforth, you may utilize the company's resources in both the inner and outer seas at your discretion, using this token…"</p><p>Elder Zou swiftly appointed Qin Sang an external Sea Guest Elder, handing him a token.</p><p>"Daoist, you are now one of us.  If you have any requests, please feel free to mention them."</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Guest Elder token. It seemed his position was even more important than Hui Wen's, carrying considerable authority. He could not only mobilize some of the Qiong Yu Trading Company's resources but, in times of crisis, could even seek help from the entire Dongji Alliance.</p><p>His role in the company, as an artifact refiner, simply required him to fulfill his refining duties.</p><p>"Since Elder Zou asks, I'll be frank. My main focus is my own cultivation, though I also refine artifacts. My cultivation technique is unique, requiring me to hunt monsters for training at intervals. I cannot remain on the island for continuous refining."</p><p>Elder Zou readily agreed, promising Qin Sang access to the company's resources to ensure his safety during monster hunts.</p><p>Qin Sang made several requests, each of which Elder Zou readily granted.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang added, "The company purchases so many monster corpses; it seems I'll be busy on Duyan Island for a year or two. However, I urgently need eight Dragon spirit cores at the peak of the Spirit stage, and they must be extracted from live subjects.  I wonder if the company can quickly gather them?"</p><p>Ran Luo pondered, "Refining high-quality Demon Slayer Pills also requires monster cores.  Considering the Daoist's requirement for live capture of peak Spirit stage dragons, it might be difficult. I will do my best to help you collect them."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, "Thank you for your efforts, Daoist Ran. If they can't be gathered quickly, please help me find out where nearby dragons appear. I can hunt them myself."</p>
