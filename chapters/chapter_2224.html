<h1>Chapter 2214: The Illusory Realm</h1><p>“Thank you, senior, for your guidance.”</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated his spiritual sense avatar and bowed to the void.</p><p>Whether the spirit intentionally or unintentionally, the benefits he received here were undeniable.</p><p>The surroundings remained silent and unresponsive.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly withdrew his spiritual sense from the Sun-Moon Hall, returning to his physical body, and then left.</p><p>Emerging from the clouds, Qin Sang found Zhan Yan and the others staring at him, realizing that his immersion in the hall had aroused their suspicion.</p><p>However, outsiders could not know what he had gained, so Qin Sang remained composed and flew back to Liuli.</p><p>Confirming that both Qin Sang and the Sun-Moon Hall showed no abnormalities, Zhan Ran and the others looked away, and Xu Mu flew into the clouds.</p><p>Liuli was about to leave when she heard Qin Sang planned to stay, causing her to pause, then her eyes widened slightly in surprise.  “Daoist Qin…”</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had shown little interest in the Chunqiu Gui. They had planned to give up decisively if they didn't receive the spirit's approval on their first try. Qin Sang's sudden change of heart must have a reason.</p><p>Considering a possibility, Liuli was first shocked, then immediately became vigilant.</p><p>If Qin Sang took the Chunqiu Gui, Zhan Yan and the others would probably not stand idly by, and a struggle would inevitably ensue.</p><p>If the news leaked, it would cause an even bigger stir. The temptation of a high-level spiritual treasure was too great. Even without the spirit's approval, many would still want to fight for it.</p><p>Moreover, there were even Saint-level experts from the Yi Ren tribe guarding outside!</p><p>“Fairy, you misunderstand. It wasn't that the spirit favored me, but that I gained other benefits…”</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained to Liuli, pausing before continuing, “Fairy, you might try approaching it from the Yin and Yang Dao; you might find it surprisingly effective.”</p><p>Liuli realized, “My master once explained the Yin and Yang Dao to me, comparing it with the Ice Dao. It was profound, but with my current cultivation, I could only grasp it superficially, failing to comprehend its essence.”</p><p>Qin Sang felt somewhat helpless about this.</p><p>If not for this unexpected event, he and Liuli would have entered the Heart Lake much earlier to help Liuli overcome her tribulation and wait for the celestial phenomenon, allowing her to visit the spirit with her Void Refinement cultivation.</p><p>The upheaval in the sacred land had completely reversed their plans. They had gone through many hardships just to find this place, and now they had to rely on the Sun-Moon Hall to find that secret realm.</p><p>With only Nascent Soul cultivation, it was extremely difficult for Liuli to gain the spirit’s approval!</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s familiarity with the Yin and Yang Dao, Liuli recounted Ning Zhenren's explanation of the Dao. Qin Sang found himself unable to fully grasp it either.</p><p>As the saying goes, "teach according to the student's aptitude". Ning Zhenren clearly explained the Dao based on Liuli's situation, making it unsuitable for Qin Sang.</p><p>The more Qin Sang understood the Yin and Yang Dao, the more he sensed its profoundness. All Daoist techniques could be explained through Yin and Yang, including thunder techniques!</p><p>There was a scripture in the Five Thunder Envoy's seal that stated: "Yin and Yang clash to create thunder, and their surge creates lightning."</p><p>Some believe that the different Daos are not strictly separate but have varying levels of inclusion, considering the Dao of Thunder as part of the Yin and Yang Dao.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang didn't achieve immediate results in the Sun-Moon Hall.</p><p>Perhaps his understanding was not deep enough; he hadn't obtained any cultivation techniques from the black and white pieces, and he still didn't understand their origin or abilities.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang realized that his understanding of the Yin and Yang Dao could be applied to thunder techniques!</p><p>If he encountered a nemesis like the Extinction Gourd again, or had to seal another Mahayana-level thunder technique with thunder beasts, it would be much easier.</p><p>Just this alone was worth staying and continuing to contemplate several times.</p><p>Qin Sang, using thunder techniques as a foundation, explained his understanding of the Yin and Yang Dao to Liuli. The extent of her gain would depend on her own aptitude.</p><p>As they communicated through divine sense, Xu Mu flew out of the clouds, his expression clearly showing that he had also failed.</p><p>After a round, no one had gained the spirit’s approval.</p><p>No one was surprised. If it were that easy, previous generations would have already taken the Chunqiu Gui, leaving nothing for them.</p><p>Zhan Yan took the lead and entered the clouds again.</p><p>Each time the Sun-Moon Hall appeared, it would remain for a period of time. In the past, the various sects of the Daoist tradition competed for the time spent comprehending within the hall. Those lacking in strength might not even qualify to enter.</p><p>Now, only five of them remained, giving them plenty of time, enough for each of them to try several times.</p><p>Zhan Yan's second attempt yielded no miracle, and it was Liuli's turn.</p><p>Even with Liuli’s high aptitude, she couldn't make a significant breakthrough in such a short time. But since she was going to try, she would do her best.  Liuli sat cross-legged in front of the hall entrance. With her previous experience, she withstood the impact without vomiting blood.</p><p>Time passed, and the time limit was soon approaching; it seemed another failure was imminent.</p><p>At that moment, the clouds suddenly churned, and the Sun and Moon Palace trembled slightly.</p><p>In an instant, everyone's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>The sudden disturbance in the Sun and Moon Palace—what did it mean? Was the Chunqiu Gui about to acknowledge Liu Li as its master?</p><p>Qin Sang was also taken aback, but he reacted swiftly, his figure flashing as he positioned himself between the three cultivators, Zan Yan and his companions, and the swirling clouds.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A sword light appeared before him.</p><p>Then, thunder roared.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A bolt of azure lightning struck down in front of the three.</p><p>“I urge you three not to cross this boundary; otherwise, don't blame me for being ruthless!”</p><p>Qin Sang's voice was icy as he issued a warning, secretly preparing to summon his Thunder Beast guards.</p><p>He was willing to reveal his strength; he couldn't let these three ruin everything.</p><p>Sensing the power of the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal, Zan Yan and the others suddenly came to their senses, their expressions shifting.</p><p>At this moment, the power Qin Sang displayed was far beyond what a mid-stage Refining Void cultivator should possess, and Liu Li's identity made them hesitant to act.</p><p>Just as the three were hesitating, the Sun and Moon Palace trembled again, accompanied by cracking sounds.</p><p>Everyone looked on in astonishment. A crack had appeared on the top of the Sun and Moon Palace.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The tremors continued, and the crack spread rapidly.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Sun and Moon Palace suddenly shattered into countless fragments, from which shot a grayish-white beam of light.  Its speed was incredible; before anyone could see what was within the beam, it shot towards the heavens.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, Qin Sang felt a change in his sleeve.  A talisman jumped out, about to fly away, but Qin Sang restrained it.</p><p>Others also experienced unexpected events.</p><p>A round mirror appeared on Zan Yan's chest, like a protective amulet, transforming into a full moon that gently rotated above his head, emitting a white line that extended to the horizon.</p><p>A clear bell rang from Jing Zhen's wrist.  She wore a red string with a small bell that shook violently, its urgent ringing as if urging its owner to hurry to a specific location.</p><p>Xu Mu also released a talisman, different from Qin Sang's, but with a similar function.</p><p>These were ancestral tokens they had obtained from the Yi Ren cultivators, guiding them here.</p><p>At this moment, all the tokens pointed to the same place—the direction of the gray beam of light!</p><p>The series of events were bewildering, but one thing was certain: it wasn't the Chunqiu Gui acknowledging Liu Li; it was likely that a change in the sacred land startled the spirit, causing it to break free from the Sun and Moon Palace!</p><p>When Qin Sang realized what had happened, his heart sank.</p><p>“That's likely the Chunqiu Gui; let's chase it!”</p><p>Zan Yan and the others no longer hesitated, hurriedly giving chase.</p><p>The spontaneous appearance of the Chunqiu Gui was unprecedented.  An opportunity to subdue this treasure might have arisen!</p><p>With the Sun and Moon Palace collapsing and the Chunqiu Gui appearing, the cloud formation showed signs of dissipating.</p><p>Liu Li leaped out; thankfully unhurt.  Gazing at the direction where the gray beam and the three cultivators had disappeared, she said gravely, “The location I predicted earlier was also there.”</p><p>The Chunqiu Gui, the talismans, and their destination—all pointed to the same place and all happened at the same time!</p><p>Would the place they were heading to become the center of a new storm?</p><p>"What's done is done!"</p><p>Faced with this situation, Qin Sang remained calm. If they were all going to the same place, that saved them from traveling back and forth!</p><p>That being said, Qin Sang couldn't help feeling regret. This opportunity to comprehend the secrets of the black and white pieces was rare; missing this time, it would be difficult to encounter it again.</p><p>Although he hadn't gained any direct benefit, it felt like a door to the secrets of the black and white pieces had been opened for him, which would be invaluable in the future!</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li immediately set off.</p><p>They hadn't forgotten Yu Zhen, who also sensed the change in the talismans and was anxious.</p><p>“Daoist Yu,” Qin Sang said this time without evasion, getting straight to the point, “Before leaving the sacred land, I cannot return the Mie Jin Gourd to you.”</p><p>Yu Zhen understood Qin Sang's meaning. With the situation unclear, no one would readily give up an item that could restrain them.</p><p>Qin Sang's attitude was satisfactory to him; he was overjoyed, thinking he hadn’t worked hard for nothing.</p><p>“I have accumulated some wealth; I will certainly not let Daoist Qin suffer a loss!” Yu Zhen said repeatedly.</p><p>Qin Sang looked deeply at Yu Zhen. This young man was quite shrewd.</p><p>It seemed that he had trapped Zhang Yan only to show his goodwill, and did not intend to use it as a bargaining chip; he would pay separately during the transaction.</p><p>"No rush, we might have further opportunities to cooperate," Qin Sang said meaningfully.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Yu Zhen was slightly stunned, feeling as if he had unexpectedly benefited. With the Mie Jin Gourd in Qin Sang's hands, the immortals and Tang...were fewer, and any sensible person would not refuse to cooperate with such a powerful cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli, without a word, took flight, disappearing into the sky.</p><p>Yu Zhen, though anxious, knew it was best to avoid appearing with Qin Sang, so he took a detour before heading to the place indicated by the talisman.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli sped onward; the talisman’s reaction grew increasingly intense.  As they suspected, the talisman led them precisely where they intended to go!</p><p>By now, they had completely lost track of the Chunqiu Gui. Even Zan Yan and the others, had they immediately pursued, would have been far behind, unable to follow its trail.</p><p>During their flight, they heard a distant sound of breaking air.  Slowing down, they saw a red streak across the horizon; cultivators were being drawn from all directions.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they concealed their auras and proceeded stealthily.</p><p>Wind and sand swept across the desolate landscape.  In the vast emptiness, a patch of green suddenly appeared, like a jewel embedded in the earth, capturing their attention.</p><p>It was a lush forest, mountains and rivers teeming with life, miraculously untouched by the storm.</p><p>“This is it!” Liuli declared firmly.</p><p>The talisman pointed to this forest!</p><p>Master Ning had said this place was a phantom realm, where reality and illusion intertwined.  They planned to use this realm to help Liuli overcome her karmic tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang would also enter the realm.  This particular realm was unique; it could transport Qin Sang into Liuli’s karmic illusion, allowing him to guide her through it and help her overcome her demonic obstacles.</p><p>Master Ning speculated that Liuli’s karmic demons were likely connected to Qin Sang and Bing Yao, making Qin Sang the key to resolving them.</p><p>Qin Sang had never heard of such a place.  He gazed at the scene before him: lush grass, flowers carpeting the ground, streams winding through the mountains, birds and animals living peacefully—a world apart from the outside.</p><p>The talisman had led them here, suggesting this phantom realm held a far greater secret!</p><p>At the forest's edge, a dozen figures hovered, gazing at the forest with apprehension.  To their senses, everything seemed real, yet it defied logic.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli avoided them, approaching from another side and slipping into the forest unseen.</p><p>Immediately, the fragrance of plants filled the air.  Qin Sang reached the stream, cupping some water in his hands; it was refreshingly cool, and everything felt utterly real.</p><p>“It’s time,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>Liuli nodded. Entering the phantom realm required the right moment.  The realm had its own cycles; now, with the realm's power stable, she had sufficient time to break through and face the celestial tribulation when the realm’s power surged.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the talisman. It had guided them to the realm, not falling silent as before, yet offering no further direction.  It seemed the forest itself was the final destination, explaining why those others lingered outside.</p><p>The realm remained calm for now.  They could only hope the upheaval would come later, giving him and Liuli time to accomplish their task.</p><p>Knowing time was short, they moved swiftly through the mountains, putting distance between themselves and the others.  However, once the tribulation arrived, it would be impossible to hide it; Qin Sang would have to protect her.</p><p>After a while, they reached a mountain peak, surveyed the area, and finally chose their spot.</p><p>Liuli entered the mountain, carving out a cave and setting up formations to prepare for her breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang, meanwhile, erected banners on the summit, summoning Mount Taiyu.</p><p>Unlike last time, as he activated the secret technique, Mount Taiyu emitted strange fluctuations, radiating layers of green light.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had preemptively set up a large formation to contain the phenomenon, otherwise, it might have alerted those outside the phantom realm.</p><p>Standing on the peak, Qin Sang held the mountain aloft, his eyes deep as he gazed into the heart of the phantom realm, finally locating the mountain's essence!</p><p>The next moment, his astral body separated, carrying the mountain, and soared into the sky.</p>
