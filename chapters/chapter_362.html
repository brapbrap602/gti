Chapter 355 The Grand Tutor


On the flying boat, the two were chatting happily, almost becoming sworn brothers.
Their cultivation levels were similar, and exchanging cultivation insights and verifying their own understanding brought them both new realizations.
The flying boat sped through the air, still a long way from Han Family Fort.
Qin Sang didn't enter a meditative state for cultivation, but kept looking outside the flying boat.
Fluffy white clouds, a clear blue sky.
Ever-changing mountains and rivers, and scattered villages of ordinary people – scenery completely different from the ancient immortal battlefield – rapidly receded from view.
“Friend Han,” Qin Sang suddenly stood up, apologetically saying, “I suddenly remembered an important matter, I'm afraid I can't go back to Han Family Fort with you, friend. I will visit another time.”
The Han Family Head was startled and quickly tried to persuade him to stay, “Friend Qin, what urgent matter is it? You saved my life, and I almost repaid your kindness with evil; I haven’t even apologized yet. Besides, there’s also the matter of Zhen Ming…”
Qin Sang slowly shook his head.
“At Mount Gu Ling, it was merely a small effort on my part, Friend Han. Please don’t mention saving your life again.
“And it’s not Friend Han’s fault.  You guided me to You Mountain Market back then, allowing me to embark on the immortal path – an opportunity others would desperately seek.
“I truly have urgent business, I will visit Han Family Fort and share drinks with you another day.
“As for Zhen Ming's matter, so many years have passed. The truth, it doesn't matter anymore…”
The Han Family Head seemed thoughtful, after pondering for a moment, he looked deeply at Qin Sang and said, “I understand! However, Zhen Ming had ulterior motives, and I must give you a satisfactory explanation, Friend Qin. Rest assured, I will handle it. Regardless, I will never forget Friend Qin's kindness. If you ever need help, just send a message, and I will definitely do my utmost to assist!”
Qin Sang nodded, leaped from the flying boat, and said, “Till we meet again, Friend Han.”
“Till we meet again!”
The Han Family Head bowed to see him off, suddenly remembering something, and shouted towards Qin Sang's back, “Friend Qin, the Great Sui hasn't moved its capital; the imperial capital remains in its original location.”
…
As night fell.
In the Great Sui capital, countless lights shone.
Qin Sang stood atop a mountain north of the capital, overlooking the magnificent city.
He discovered that the capital's current size was at least twice as large as when he left, even the Ascension Mountain outside the city had been enclosed within the city walls.
Its prosperity far surpassed the past.
In just a few decades, from a city ravaged by war, it had developed to this extent.
The Han Family Head's words about the Empress's great talent were no exaggeration.
Suddenly, a gust of wind, a figure barely visible to the naked eye, floated over like a wisp of wind – clearly a type of escape technique.  This person was not a martial arts expert, but a cultivator.
Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and looked down at the newcomer.
“May I ask if you are Senior Qin?”
The person landed before Qin Sang, glanced at him, and quickly bowed.
“Who are you?”
Qin Sang sized up the man.
Judging by his appearance, he was forty or fifty years old, with a goatee, looking like a scholar. His cultivation was not high, only at the eleventh level of Qi Refinement, wearing an exceptionally luxurious brocade robe.
“Reporting to Senior, I am a member of the Han family; the current Family Head is my uncle…”
The scholar explained his origin and produced a letter, presenting it to Qin Sang with both hands.
“The Family Head ordered me to deliver this letter to Senior Qin, and to report to you, Senior.
“Years ago, Zhen Ming's younger brother lacked talent, and Zhen Ming wanted his younger brother to enter the inner sect as a guard two years later, fearing someone would take his place, so he deceived his superiors and committed a despicable act.
“The Family Head has dealt with it according to clan rules.
“The ringleader has been executed.
“Also, his descendants have had their cultivation removed, expelled from Han Family Fort, and left to fend for themselves.”
Qin Sang listened to the scholar's account while opening the letter.
It was a handwritten letter from the Han Family Head, full of words of gratitude and apology, and an invitation for Qin Sang to visit Han Family Fort.
Qin Sang put the letter away and bowed to the scholar, saying, “Thank you for your trip, please also tell the Han Family Head that I appreciate him upholding justice, and I will definitely visit when I have the time.”
“As you command!”
The scholar paused, seeing that Qin Sang had nothing else to say, he wisely took his leave.
…
Great Sui, Grand Tutor's Mansion.
It was already late at night, but the study was still brightly lit. An elderly man with white hair was writing diligently at his desk, piles of documents on the table before him.
The old man put down his pen, blew the ink dry, folded the paper, and put it into an envelope.


At that moment, the old man suddenly frowned, coughing violently. He covered his mouth with his hand, suppressing the sound so that those outside wouldn't hear.  After a long while, he finally managed to calm down.

"Alas! Time waits for no man!"

He gently patted his lower back, leaned against the chair, closed his eyes, and softly said, "Zhi Niang, bring a few more candles and make a cup of invigorating tea…"

'Creak!'

An elderly woman carrying tea entered the room.  Her gaze swept across the old man's face, instantly discerning his condition.  With a worried tone, she said, "Coughing again? I told you to ask the Emperor for some elixirs, but you refused!  You can't keep pushing yourself like this! Didn't you say the Emperor is growing weary of you and wants to retire? Why are you still worrying about so many things every day?"

The old man sipped his tea, his complexion improving slightly. He patted the woman's hand and said wistfully, "Retirement… I must first complete the task entrusted to me by the late Emperor, to appease his spirit, before I make any plans. The foundation painstakingly built by the late Emperor and his colleagues must not be allowed to collapse.  The Emperor must endure for a few more years. Once this is done, we will return to your hometown and live in seclusion, away from worldly affairs. Whether the Sui Dynasty thrives or perishes will no longer concern me."

"Back to Guling Mountain?  Why there?"

The woman massaged his shoulders. "My earliest memories are all of hardship.  During your attacks, I was captured and almost… You rescued me, and I’ve lived peacefully ever since. Wherever you are, that's my home. Oh, but wasn't your father buried in Cuiming Mountain? Why don't we go there? The scenery is beautiful…"

She glanced back at the back of the study.

It was strange.  Wu's ancestral tablet was only one, not enshrined in the ancestral hall, but in the study.

Even stranger, the tablet read "Wu Ya-ba," which didn't seem like a name.

Beside the tablet was a scroll, which had remained there for years unopened. The husband only ever bowed before it; he never burned incense.

After all these years of marriage, the husband had never told her about this person's identity.

Their children, ordered by their father to bow before the portrait, curiously asked about it, but their father only said it was his teacher. When asked why they only bowed and didn't burn incense, he said the teacher had profound blessings and would certainly live forever.

…

This old man was Wu Chuanzong, a beggar in his youth, now a Grand Tutor.

Hearing his wife mention Cuiming Mountain, Wu Chuanzong immediately recalled someone, falling into a daze, muttering, "I wonder where my teacher is now? Has he ascended to immortality?"
