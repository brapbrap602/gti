<h1>Chapter 2114:  Imminent War</h1><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader was evasive, revealing very little information. Qin Sang couldn’t guess the true strength of Ziyun Mountain. However, the Yuanxiang clan leader’s caution suggested that Ziyun Mountain was at least as powerful as the Zhuyan clan.</p><p>According to the Yuanxiang clan leader, Master Liuli was a highly skilled Daoist cultivator, so Ziyun Mountain was most likely a Daoist sect.</p><p>“Could it be related to the Daoist Court?”</p><p>It was understandable that Qin Sang suspected this.  Both the Storm World and the Talisman World ascended from the Evil River to the Greater Thousand World, and both concealed great secrets.  These similarities made it hard not to connect them.</p><p>The Daoist Court ascended to the Greater Thousand World and then vanished from the world, known to few.  Could it be near the Mist Sea, like the Storm World?</p><p>These were just Qin Sang’s guesses, lacking evidence.  Judging by the Yuanxiang clan leader's tone, Liuli’s master was more likely a descendant of the Dan Ding School.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang’s experiences in the Greater Thousand World, there were no rumors within the Daoist community of an open conflict between the Dan Ding School and the Talisman School. The disagreements between the two schools were mostly inferred by outsiders based on their differing cultivation philosophies.</p><p>What was the Dan Ding School’s attitude toward the Daoist Court’s descendants?</p><p>The Storm World, originally under the protection of someone, had become Qin Sang’s domain.  He had to carefully consider how to present himself to Liuli’s master in the future.</p><p>His most legitimate and impressive identity was undoubtedly that of a Daoist Court official: a Third Rank, Five Thunder Palace Envoy!</p><p>Initially, the First Sword Attendant had Zhang Zhenjun bestow this position upon him to deter others in times of crisis.</p><p>Although the Daoist Court had suffered significant losses and remained hidden, outsiders were unaware of their true strength. In their eyes, the Talisman School was still a top-tier power in the Greater Thousand World, equal to the Dan Ding School.</p><p>Conspiring against a Third Rank immortal official would necessitate considering the Talisman School’s reaction.</p><p>Currently, the Great Zhou human race and the Eight Great Heavenly States’ implementation of the benevolent governance system in Gan State shared similarities with the Daoist Court’s divine court system, even surpassing it in some aspects.</p><p>Times change. The Greater Thousand World no longer harbored the same prejudice against the Daoist Court.</p><p>Before arriving at the Mist Sea, Qin Sang had considered using this identity if necessary.</p><p>As he pondered, a familiar aura approached from afar—it was Yuan Miao.</p><p>Yuan Miao descended, noticing that the atmosphere between the clan leader and Qin Sang wasn’t tense, and his expression softened slightly.  He bowed slightly and said calmly, “I received Daoist friend’s message some time ago.  Since the Siyou clan sent an envoy, I intended to clarify the situation before replying.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the courtesy. “Yuan Daoist, you’ve taken the trouble. The Yuanxiang clan leader has explained the risks to me.  This time, it’s my fault; I’ve made a grave mistake. We must bear the consequences ourselves; we dare not implicate innocent people, nor can we allow the Yuanxiang clan leader to break the rules for us and damage the Zhuyan clan’s reputation.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s determination to oppose the Siyou clan, Yuan Miao was surprised and looked at the Yuanxiang clan leader.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader narrowed his drunken eyes, carefully observing Qin Sang, stroking his long beard. “He’s quite responsible.”</p><p>Qin Sang humbly replied, “My opponent is stronger, and I’m not oblivious to the danger. I have an unseemly request, a bold plea. I wonder if the Yuanxiang clan leader would grant it, considering… his position.”</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader took a sip of wine, noncommittally replying, “Let’s hear it.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t hesitate. “If the Siyou clan doesn’t send many experts, we might be able to manage.  Also, could the Yuanxiang clan leader delay the Siyou clan’s army for at least three months?”</p><p>“Three months? That’s not difficult! As for the strength of the Siyou clan’s arrival, the ancient alliance has its rules. As long as they don’t threaten my clan, I can’t go too far.”</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader stood up from the branch, his eyes flashing. “Are you truly confident? You won't avoid a direct confrontation?”</p><p>Qin Sang solemnly bowed. “I’m willing to give it a try!”</p><p>Knowing these hidden details changed the meaning of this battle.  He not only needed to drive away the enemy but also prove to Liuli’s master that he had the strength to protect the Storm World and use it as his cultivation base!</p><p>“Good! You have courage! I’ll be watching!”</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader tapped his wooden staff in the air, and clouds formed beneath his feet as he ascended into the clouds.</p><p>Yuan Miao didn’t leave with the clan leader. He said regretfully, “In this time of crisis, I shouldn’t spar with you, lest I distract you. If you need anything, feel free to ask. I can’t directly help, but I can do some small things without breaking the rules.”</p><p>“Once we drive away the enemy, I’ll have a good fight with you!”</p><p>Qin Sang gratefully accepted the offer and then, without hesitation, requested some spiritual materials needed for the battle.</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded frequently, making a note of everything.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang remembered something. “Yuan Daoist, there’s no need to persuade the Changyou clan.  Clan Chief Minzhuo is determined and has likely received promises from the Siyou clan. He won’t change his mind.”</p><p>Perhaps the Changyou leaked information, attracting the Siyou.  But dwelling on that is pointless now.</p><p>Yuan Miao sighed, “Both the Changyou and Siyou have grievances against you. Their alliance is only natural.  For both practical and emotional reasons, we can’t interfere. I hope you understand.”</p><p>After their conversation, Yuan Miao took his leave of Qin Sang.</p><p>After seeing Yuan Miao off, Qin Sang went to the North Sea, soon entering the Yinri Realm and arriving at the Xuantian Palace.  The North Sea branch was overseen by Su Nu, with Palace Master Tong Lingyu assisting her.</p><p>Qin Sang flew across half the Yinri Realm,  Tingxue Tower appearing in the distance.</p><p>The landscape around Tingxue Tower hadn't changed much due to the ascension; the peaks were snow-capped, the air biting cold.</p><p>Tingxue Tower's protective array generated white mist, obscuring the entrance, but it couldn't hide it from Qin Sang.</p><p>His time at Tingxue Tower was short, but the memory remains vivid; scenes from the wedding ceremony played in his mind.  It was a sham marriage, yet his only wedding.  Even now, the truth remains unclear.</p><p>His appearance at the gates immediately alerted the Tingxue Tower cultivators.  The Tower Lord, still Shi Xue, was constructing an altar.  Receiving the message, she quickly welcomed Qin Sang into the main hall.</p><p>“Brother-in-law!”</p><p>Shi Xue’s face lit up with a smile, not treating Qin Sang like a formidable cultivator at all.  She'd heard rumors at the Yan Yue Monastery.  Mistress Yunxin, being a serious woman, wouldn't spread gossip about her junior sister.  Perhaps the two had become a genuine couple, simply too stubborn to admit it publicly.</p><p>Feelings cannot be faked.  Over the years, Shi Xue's dedication to Qingyang View surpassed even her devotion to Xuantian Palace and Yan Yue Monastery. She treated Li Yu Fu and the others like her own children.  More than once, Shi Xue had seen her junior sister's lonely figure.  Finally, the clouds had parted, revealing the bright moon; the hardships had ended. She was happy for them.</p><p>“Brother-in-law, please sit.  This is the spirit wine you shared at your wedding. See if it still tastes the same?” Shi Xue personally poured a cup for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully savored the wine, but offered no comment.  Setting down the cup, he said, “According to tradition, the retreat of the foul lands should happen within the next few years.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang turn to business, Shi Xue’s smile faded.  She guessed what he was really asking.  Becoming serious, she said, “My junior sister said before leaving that she'd return before the retreat.”</p><p>Qin Sang calculated. Since returning to the Storm Realm, seventy years had passed. The foul qi retreated approximately every hundred years, although it could vary by a few years. If sooner, it could happen by the end of this year. To be safe, Liuli should return this year.</p><p>Knowing Liuli had a powerful master, Qin Sang wasn't worried about her safety and was genuinely happy for her good fortune.</p><p>The Siyou wouldn’t wait for Liuli's return, and Qin Sang wanted to resolve the matter before her return, to welcome his beloved.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and pressed further, “Has Liuli changed her cultivation techniques after breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Shi Xue shook her head.  “My junior sister’s Ice Soul Divine Light is now masterful, repeatedly achieving great success.  Why do you ask?”</p><p>“I've obtained several treasures. Some might help Liuli.”</p><p>Qin Sang offered a casual explanation, thinking to himself that her master hadn't asked Liuli to change her cultivation. Perhaps Liuli was unwilling to change schools, or her master also cultivates the Way of Ice.</p><p>There must be a reason for her master’s favor, though her own talent is exceptional.</p><p>“You’re thoughtful, brother-in-law.  It's well deserved,” Shi Xue said gratefully.</p><p>Qin Sang spoke with Shi Xue a while longer, but learned nothing useful. Liuli’s secrecy was profound; Shi Xue, who lived with her, hadn’t noticed anything unusual.</p><p>…Zhuyan Tribe.</p><p>Before the Shifting Palace.</p><p>The atmosphere was heavy, filled with killing intent.  Countless Zhuyan elite warriors, fully armed, stood arrayed before the palace, their killing intent palpable.  Numerous eyes fixed on the Shifting Palace, its interior eerily silent.</p><p>Suddenly, a powerful aura filled everyone's senses.  This wasn’t the aura of a single individual, but the combined aura of countless people.  To achieve such unity is difficult, requiring battle-hardened elites.</p><p>Feeling the immense pressure, the Zhu Yan soldiers' eyes lit up.  They had encountered a worthy opponent, a thrilling challenge. Without orders, they unleashed their own power in a unified surge, a tidal wave of energy aimed at the teleporting palace.</p><p>'Boom!'  An invisible shockwave tore through the void. Fortunately, the palace was sturdy enough to remain unmoved.</p><p>Those inside the palace were about to emerge, but suddenly paused. The teleportation array had a limited capacity; the arriving reinforcements would be far fewer than the opposing Zhu Yan forces. Their morale plummeted, like flickering candles in a gale, nearly extinguished. Yet, they held on, stubbornly refusing to yield.</p><p>Then, they began to stir, preparing for a counterattack.</p><p>At that moment, a figure emerged from the palace.  He was an old man with youthful vitality, a celestial air about him. A glowing orb pulsed between his brows, radiating an aura of mystery.  Standing at the epicenter of the clashing energies, he remained unperturbed, strolling with effortless grace.</p><p>He stopped before the palace gates, hands clasped behind his back, his gaze sweeping across the Zhu Yan soldiers.  He looked up at the sky.</p><p>His eyes, sharp as swords, seemed to pierce the clouds, reaching the heavens.  He proclaimed aloud, "Truly impressive!  The Zhu Yan elite, what incredible resolve!"</p><p>Though his identity was unknown, his demeanor proclaimed him a master of unparalleled skill.  Encouraged by his praise, the Zhu Yan soldiers stood taller.  Then, a streak of light descended from the sky. Yuan Miao appeared, bowing respectfully, "Are you the Grand Protector of the Lu family of Hanjiang? I am Yuan Miao."</p><p>"Indeed, I am," the Grand Protector replied. He did not underestimate Yuan Miao because of his cultivation level. "This expedition against the rebels is led by King Lu himself, with the Crown Prince’s Tutor assisting.  The Crown Prince has appointed me as vanguard. We apologize for any disturbance to this sacred place."</p><p>"The Crown Prince’s Tutor?"</p><p>Yuan Miao was startled. He hadn't expected the Crown Prince to send the Tutor.</p><p>The Tutor was the Crown Prince’s right-hand man, a figure of immense power and prestige, whose cultivation was at least equal to the Grand Protector's.</p><p>This meant the Si You tribe had sent at least two late-stage powerhouses; the number of mid- and early-stage experts was unknown.</p><p>Worrying about Qin Sang, Yuan Miao kept his composure, saying, "Our clans already have a treaty, I hope you will uphold it. I will personally oversee your forces."</p><p>"Naturally," the Grand Protector replied amicably.  After the exchange, he ordered the vanguard to leave the palace.</p><p>The vanguard, though elite, felt immense pressure facing the Zhu Yan army.  Trembling, they passed through the enemy lines and formed ranks outside the mountains.</p><p>The grand teleportation array was activated again, and wave after wave of troops arrived.</p><p>Soon, a vast army filled the area outside the mountains, banners fluttering. They finally matched the Zhu Yan forces in numbers, but the Grand Protector strictly forbade any conflict.  They were forced to suppress their own energy, enduring the pressure from the Zhu Yan soldiers.</p><p>An uncountable number of Si You elite had arrived.  Suddenly, a palanquin emerged from the palace, its silk curtains obscuring the view of the throne inside. A shadowy figure sat beside the throne, their presence subtly powerful.</p><p>"Your Majesty, this is Daoist Yuan Miao," the Grand Protector announced, bowing.</p><p>"Thank you, Special Envoy Yuan," King Lu's voice was gentle, not the commanding tone one might expect.</p><p>The palanquin floated to the front of the army and waited.</p><p>More Si You troops emerged from the palace, causing Yuan Miao's brow to furrow. He seemed on the verge of speaking, but hesitated.</p><p>Then, a blinding golden light descended from the heavens, piercing the darkness.</p><p>The Grand Protector's face changed slightly, his fingers trembling, but he remained still, allowing the golden light to land before him. It was a divine staff, blocking the palace entrance.</p><p>Inside the palace, a Void Realm Level Two expert was about to step out, but froze, his back breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p>"Enough!  The rest should return," a ethereal voice echoed from the sky.</p><p>The Grand Protector's eyes flashed. He recognized the staff's owner.  The number of troops exceeded the agreement, but he did not call them back.  This was a test, and it had alerted the Clan Chief Yuan Xiang.</p><p>"Go back.  Tell those behind you not to come," the Grand Protector waved his hand.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The soldiers dared not disobey and retreated, crestfallen.</p><p>On a distant mountain peak, a stunning scene unfolded.</p><p>In a cool pavilion amidst the breathtaking scenery, two individuals played a game of Go. One, clad in white robes, possessed golden eyes and an imposing presence.</p><p>His opponent was a young man, seemingly struggling with the game.  He stared at the board, deep in thought. Behind him stood another young man, bearing a striking resemblance—his brother, perhaps.  They too were lost in contemplation.</p><p>Suddenly, the young man playing Go felt a shift, turning towards the mountains.  He exclaimed, "My uncle predicted it perfectly! The Clan Chief Yuan Xiang has intervened!"</p>
