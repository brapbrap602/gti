<h1>Chapter 857: The Employer</h1><p>Xiang'an Auction House.</p><p>Qin Sang met Alchemist Yi.</p><p>Alchemist Yi looked exhausted.  Upon inquiry, Qin Sang learned that since the entrapment on Great Waste Island, the three major trading alliances had stepped up their war preparations. Alchemist Yi had been assigned tasks, refining pills day and night, and was utterly worn out.</p><p>"I'm tied up, unlike Fellow Daoist Qin, who had the foresight to remain unfettered and free," Alchemist Yi said, taking a large gulp of tea and leaning back in his chair.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through Alchemist Yi's insincere words. "While I enjoy freedom, I lack the protection of a powerful force. If I'm wronged, I have nowhere to seek redress and can only swallow the bitter pill. Fellow Daoist Yi's hardship is only temporary. Once the chaos in the Demon Sea subsides, you'll regain your freedom."</p><p>"Easy to say."</p><p>Alchemist Yi shook his head, his tone pessimistic. "The scale of this demonic disturbance is unprecedented. Both sides are arrayed against each other. Who knows when the beast tide will be repelled?"</p><p>After lamenting the current situation, Qin Sang brought up the real reason for his visit. Unfortunately, Alchemist Yi had no good news.</p><p>"I've inquired with many old friends, all seasoned alchemists, but none have heard of Tyrant Blood Fruit, or the other two herbs. Fellow Daoist Qin, your search for these herbs will likely depend on luck…"</p><p>Alchemist Yi expressed his regret.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Alchemist Yi was right. Obtaining the Tyrant Blood Fruit and Hairy Mountain Vine had indeed been strokes of luck. For the last ingredient, Scorpion Venom Grass, all he could do was cast a wide net.</p><p>He took out a jade box.</p><p>Inside were a dozen or so spirit flowers called Wind-Rain Orchids, favored by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and highly beneficial to its growth.</p><p>"I wouldn't dare trouble Fellow Daoist Yi with these Wind-Rain Orchids, but I'd appreciate it if you could arrange for an alchemist to refine them into pills."</p><p>Qin Sang handed the pill recipe and the flowers to Alchemist Yi.</p><p>Alchemist Yi glanced at the recipe and immediately became intrigued. "Hmm? This pill formula and technique are new to me.  From what I can tell, this medicine isn't meant for human consumption, is it? Please wait a moment, Fellow Daoist Qin. I'll personally refine these pills. I'll be back shortly."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised that Alchemist Yi could discern the pill's purpose at a glance. He was naturally delighted that Alchemist Yi was willing to do it himself.  While waiting, he browsed the auction house for useful cultivation resources.</p><p>…</p><p>Bao Gu Mountain cave.</p><p>Qin Sang took a pill from a jade bottle.</p><p>The fragrance of flowers filled the room.</p><p>These were the pills Alchemist Yi had refined from the Wind-Rain Orchids.</p><p>Smelling the aroma, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly perched on Qin Sang's right shoulder immediately flapped its wings and flew over to paw at his fingers, looking impatient.</p><p>From the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's mind, pleas and coquettishness also emanated.</p><p>"Here you go."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and fed the pill to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly swallowed it in one gulp and became extremely excited, fluttering its large wings and flying around Qin Sang.</p><p>Its size had increased several times, and now a single wing was the size of an adult's palm. However, its growth had slowed down, even though Qin Sang had been diligently feeding it the best pills and spirit flowers.</p><p>Natural transformation for spirit insects was extremely difficult.  The growth rate of a rare insect like the Sky-Eyed Butterfly could only be described as incredibly slow. Without blood feeding and the Spirit Controlling Sect's scriptures, Qin Sang would likely reach the end of his lifespan before witnessing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's third transformation peak.</p><p>"Choosing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly as my natal spirit insect was the right decision. Hopefully, it will be helpful during my Nascent Soul formation."</p><p>Compared to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, the Fat Silkworm's condition was a mystery to Qin Sang.</p><p>Previously, the Fat Silkworm had nibbled on a piece of Amethyst, then fallen into a deep sleep.  After finally waking up, it had immediately asked Qin Sang for more Amethyst, taken another bite, and gone back to sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang had become a caretaker.</p><p>During its slumber, it couldn't be woken no matter how hard he tried.  Fortunately, they hadn't encountered any venomous beasts or poisonous lands during this time. But despite consuming so much Amethyst, the Fat Silkworm didn't seem to have changed much, and its growth rate was slow, even slower than the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>"Is it accumulating power, or is there some other reason?"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure it out.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was an enigma, its origins unknown. It had willingly acknowledged him as its master, and its fragile body could treat potent poisons as delicacies.</p><p>After feeding the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang followed his routine, first blood-feeding his avatar, then cultivating the "Spirit Refinement Sword Canon," and going out at night for astral body refinement.</p><p>A monotonous but organized routine, preparing for his next trip to the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>He had originally planned to visit the Lan Dou Sect recently, but for the sake of high-grade spirit stones, he had to put that aside and wait for news in his cave.</p><p>After more than a month of secluded cultivation, there was still no news from the shopkeeper. Just as Qin Sang couldn't resist the urge to inquire, the restriction outside his cave was triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed out and found a transmission talisman. After reading it, his face lit up with joy. He immediately sealed the cave, left his avatar inside to cultivate, and hurriedly left.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, you arrived quickly."</p><p>The shopkeeper teased as Qin Sang pushed the door open.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly said, "I'm driven by external matters, what can I do?"</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>The shopkeeper closed the shop and led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the shopkeeper, who took a winding path towards the city gate of Tianxing City.  He couldn't help but ask, "What's the status of this employer? Are they not in Tianxing City?"</p><p>The shopkeeper said, "I'm just a mediator. I don't know much about the employer's background or identity, just like you, Fellow Daoist Qin. We only discuss business. They asked to meet outside Tianxing Island. I'll take you there, and you can talk directly. Of course, if you're unwilling, I can send a message to decline."</p><p>"So, you don't know what they're planning to do by gathering people?"</p><p>"Correct," the shopkeeper nodded.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.  After some thought, realizing his avatar could cultivate independently in the cave and he had everything else with him, he said, "Please lead the way."</p><p>The shopkeeper's tone softened. "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist Qin. From what I've observed, they might have been delayed by something and are likely in urgent need of manpower. As soon as I contacted them, they immediately asked me to bring you to meet..."</p><p>As they spoke, they walked out of Tianxing City's gate, activated their flying light, and flew towards the island.</p><p>The shopkeeper led him north. After flying for half a day, they arrived at an island inhabited by mortals.  Pointing ahead, he said, "The meeting place is on this island."</p><p>Seeing it wasn't a desolate place, Qin Sang relaxed and landed on the island with the shopkeeper, flying towards a verdant mountain.</p><p>As they approached the mountain, Qin Sang sensed several auras at the summit. The other party had also noticed them.</p><p>At the mountaintop, stone tables and stools were set amidst a babbling spring.</p><p>A young man sat there, leisurely sipping tea.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt a sense of alarm and stopped his flying light.  He heard a whistling sound from the mountaintop, and then a young man in white robes flew down towards them.</p><p>The shopkeeper also stopped, waiting for the young man to approach.  He introduced them, "Fellow Daoist Fang, this is Fellow Daoist Qin, whom I mentioned. Fellow Daoist Qin, this is Fellow Daoist Fang, the employer. I've brought him here, so I'll take my leave."</p>
