<h1>Chapter 1397: The Chaos Demon Isle and the Ethereal Sea</h1><p>As Qin Sang had expected.</p><p>He looked at Lan Jingsi, then at the jade slip, and remained silent in contemplation.</p><p>Lan Jingsi continued, "Senior Brother will arrange everything in a famous large city in the Boundless Sea. Fellow Daoist should first make contact with our informant. Once Senior Brother receives the news, he will go to meet you as soon as possible."</p><p>Valley Master Mu arranged the meeting in the city, rather than elsewhere, to dispel Qin Sang's doubts as much as possible.</p><p>Other matters will be discussed in detail after they meet.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly weighed his options.</p><p>He had already planned to take a trip to the Boundless Sea to investigate Clear Lake, so meeting with Valley Master Mu wouldn't be a problem.</p><p>The fact that the other party urgently requested him to rush to the Boundless Sea likely meant they had encountered some matter and needed to rely on his power.</p><p>Otherwise, Qin Sang didn't believe that Wind Ascetic had enough influence to make Valley Master Mu care about such a minor matter amidst his busy schedule.</p><p>Since the other party was seeking something, this was the perfect opportunity to make demands.</p><p>Valley Master Mu didn't know that he possessed the Heaven's Eye Butterfly and was determined to obtain the Spirit Ascension Ritual, giving him the upper hand.</p><p>After considering everything, Qin Sang reached out and grabbed the jade slip, scanning it with his divine sense.</p><p>Lan Jingsi revealed a smile upon seeing this, her tone tinged with urgency, "The journey is long, and time is of the essence, please set out as soon as possible. If there has been any discourtesy these past few days, I hope Fellow Daoist will forgive us…"</p><p>It seemed Lan Jingsi wouldn't reveal any more information.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the jade slip, nodded to her, and immediately rose to take his leave.</p><p>He didn't disturb the disciples of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Qin Sang discreetly left Hundred Flowers Valley. After exiting the miasma, he soared into the sky on his escape light.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang saw the azure sea in the distance.</p><p>However, he wasn't in a hurry to leave. Instead, he detoured to a nearby marketplace and bought another sea chart.</p><p>The sea chart Lan Jingsi gave him was simple, mainly marking a route. Qin Sang naturally wouldn't obediently follow this path and prepared to plan his own.</p><p>The agreed meeting place was called Nine Precepts City, a bizarre name that was also the name of the island.</p><p>Qin Sang purchased several sea charts in the marketplace, claiming to be the most comprehensive, but couldn't find detailed information about Nine Precepts Isle.</p><p>Comparing several sea charts, he first planned a section of the route, intending to further refine it after entering the Boundless Sea, and then left String Moon Realm that very night.</p><p>The sea area near String Moon Realm was still under the control of the land-based forces.</p><p>Further ahead lay the true Boundless Sea!</p><p>Flying across the sea.</p><p>On the boundless sea surface, there were scattered large and small islands.</p><p>The familiar scenery evoked memories of Qin Sang's time in the Azure Wave Sea, filling him with a strange sense of familiarity.</p><p>He had cultivated in the Azure Wave Sea for over a hundred years and had adapted to this state of drifting at sea.</p><p>The various rumors about the Boundless Sea were intimidating, but perhaps not as dangerous as some of the forbidden areas in the Azure Wave Sea. Back then, he was only in the Golden Core stage, and his self-preservation ability was far inferior to what it was now.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang occasionally encountered cultivators, and when he had the opportunity, he would stop to inquire about news and purchase more detailed sea charts.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang had a clear impression of the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, there was another set of order.</p><p>The current so-called core of the Boundless Sea was an island called Chaos Demon Isle (Mixed Devil Isle) by the cultivators of the Boundless Sea, and the nearby sea area.</p><p>The reason it became the core was simple: the master of Chaos Demon Isle was a Grand Cultivator—Old Man Chaos Demon (Old Devil of Chaos)!</p><p>Although Old Man Chaos Demon occupied Chaos Demon Isle, he didn't restrict other forces from entering. On the contrary, he held a laissez-faire attitude and treated righteous, evil, demon, and monstrous cultivators equally.</p><p>Chaos Demon Isle gathered countless forces, the situation was complex, but it had its own rules.</p><p>As long as one didn't do anything that violated Old Man Chaos Demon's taboos, Chaos Demon Isle was actually safer than other places.</p><p>However, Old Man Chaos Demon had no ambition to unify the Boundless Sea and didn't care about what happened outside Chaos Demon Isle.</p><p>In the Boundless Sea, there were also several places similar to Chaos Demon Isle, but their fame was not as great as Chaos Demon Isle.</p><p>Nine Precepts Isle was one of them.</p><p>Nine Precepts Isle was located in the southern part of the Boundless Sea. After Qin Sang left String Moon Realm, he headed straight for the southeast.</p><p>However, he deliberately detoured around the halfway point to an area called Nine Stars Sea Area.</p><p>Nine Stars Sea Area was a force in the Boundless Sea, the base of the Nine Stars Society.</p><p>The Nine Stars Society consisted of nine chambers of commerce active in the Boundless Sea. It was a force in the nature of an alliance, and was quite well-known in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Chambers of commerce had always been the most well-informed. Qin Sang came here to inquire about some news.</p><p>Nine Stars City.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his appearance, disguised as an ordinary cultivator, and entered the base of one of the chambers of commerce.</p><p>He only revealed his Golden Core stage cultivation, but still received VIP treatment, with a chamber of commerce steward personally welcoming him.</p><p>"This humble one is surnamed Luo, with the given name Chen. May I ask how I should address the esteemed guest?"</p><p>Steward Luo warmly led Qin Sang into a quiet room.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of introducing himself and went straight to the point, "I want to inquire about some news."</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang didn't come to buy treasures, a flash of disappointment appeared in Steward Luo's eyes, but his enthusiasm didn't diminish, "Fellow Daoist has come to the right place. As long as it concerns matters of the Boundless Sea, nothing can escape the ears of our Nine Stars Society!"</p><p>"Don't speak so definitively!"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, "I'll ask you, has anything major happened recently near Nine Precepts Isle?"</p><p>Steward Luo was stunned and frowned, "That's too general. What does Fellow Daoist mean by…?"</p><p>"Anything that could attract the attention of Nascent Soul cultivators," Qin Sang emphasized, "Anything!"</p><p>"Nascent Soul?"</p><p>Steward Luo's heart trembled. He glanced at Qin Sang, then said cautiously, "These matters are beyond the scope of my responsibilities. I will immediately send a message to the chamber of commerce elders, but…"</p><p>Qin Sang understood and directly threw a bag of spirit stones on the table, "Is this enough?"</p><p>He was just inquiring about news, not investigating secrets, so paying spirit stones would suffice.</p><p>Steward Luo's face was full of smiles, "Enough, enough. Please wait a moment, Fellow Daoist…"</p><p>"Hold on!"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped Steward Luo and tossed out another bag, "Also, help me check if there's a place called Clear Lake." (Alternative: Help me check if a place called Jing Hu exists)</p><p>Steward Luo asked in confusion, "Is it an island named Clear Lake, or…?" (Alternative: Is the name of the island Jing Hu, or…?)</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, "Only the two words Clear Lake (Jing Hu), or it might be a name from thousands of years ago, which has now changed."</p><p>Steward Luo left with doubts.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in the quiet room and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p>A full half-day passed before Steward Luo finally returned, "Fellow Daoist, sorry to keep you waiting! Clear Lake (Jing Hu) is too broad a term, and required carefully searching through various books, which is why it took some time."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly, "You found it?"</p><p>Steward Luo nodded, "Fortunately, I didn't fail my mission! Recently, everything has been normal around Nine Precepts Isle, and no major events have occurred. Of course, it may have been deliberately concealed and hasn't been circulated. As for Clear Lake (Jing Hu), I ordered people to search through ancient books and really found a place called Clear Lake (Jing Hu). The sea has changed over time, and many things are unrecognizable, and Clear Lake (Jing Hu) is no exception. Now there is no name Clear Lake (Jing Hu). After careful comparison, we can only confirm that Clear Lake (Jing Hu) should be in the vicinity of the current Ethereal Sea (Kong Ling Hai)."</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>I found a bug in the outline, and scratched my head all night, my hair is about to fall out, I tasted the taste of card text.</p><p>I squeezed out a chapter in the middle of the night, and the other chapter can only be owed again, wait for me to sort out and make up.</p>
