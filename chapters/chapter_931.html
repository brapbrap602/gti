<h1>Chapter 923: Ambush</h1><p>At dusk.</p><p>Two figures quietly left Toad Island. After flying for a distance, they activated their escape lights and flew towards the depths of the Demon Sea.</p><p>One of them had a long beard and looked nearly fifty years old, yet he was extremely respectful to the other, a younger man.</p><p>This young man was none other than the Fang Clan youth whom Qin Sang had encountered before, the chief disciple of Black Serpent Mountain.</p><p>“Senior Brother, I’ve searched that area for months and confirmed that the lair belongs to a rare Gloom Beast.  There's likely a late-stage or even peak Demon Core realm great demon. My cultivation is low, and I feared being discovered by the Gloom Beast, so I didn't dare get too close. I had to ask Senior Brother to come and investigate the lair…”</p><p>The older cultivator led the way, speaking through voice transmission.</p><p>Young Master Fang hummed in acknowledgement and said indifferently, “If there's only this Gloom Beast in the lair, the two of us can just kill it directly. If there are other great demons, we'll have to wait a few days and invite a few helpers before taking action. The Gloom Beast's eyes are the most crucial ingredient in Master's prescription, the sooner we get them, the better.”</p><p>As he was speaking, Young Master Fang suddenly frowned. “Are you certain no other factions have their eyes on this beast?”</p><p>The older cultivator was taken aback, then asserted, “Rest assured, Senior Brother, I've been very careful. I haven't leaked any information about the Gloom Beast to anyone. I've been lurking and scouting around the lair for a long time, and haven't found any signs of other factions.”</p><p>Young Master Fang nodded slightly and said no more.</p><p>However, he couldn't help but recall a humiliating incident from years ago, gritting his teeth secretly.</p><p>To this day, he still couldn't understand where he had gone wrong.</p><p>He had replayed the entire plan countless times, carefully considering every detail. There was no possibility of his fellow disciples betraying him, yet at the last moment, it all fell apart, becoming a wedding gift for his enemy.</p><p>Even more tragically, they were double-crossed. So many of his fellow disciples had gone out, and only three returned alive.</p><p>The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.</p><p>How did that oriole discover their secret and follow them so silently?</p><p>Although Master hadn't severely punished him after returning to Black Serpent Mountain, Young Master Fang had always kept this incident in his heart, considering it a lifelong disgrace. For years, he hadn't given up on searching for that person, wishing to tear him to pieces to relieve the hatred in his heart.</p><p>That person, however, had vanished into thin air, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Both the Vast Sea and the Demon Sea were vast and boundless, making it easy to hide someone. Moreover, they weren't human, making it difficult to find accurate information.</p><p>But in Young Master Fang's view, these were not excuses. He would never give up his desire for revenge. A fierce glint flashed in his eyes. That person better pray they never fall into his hands.</p><p>The two exchanged a few words and flew silently towards the lair.</p><p>Three days later, they arrived above an unremarkable desolate island.</p><p>The older cultivator stopped and pointed at the island.</p><p>“Senior Brother, the lair is not far ahead. I've opened a cave dwelling here. We might as well rest for a moment and adjust our condition before investigating the lair…”</p><p>Young Master Fang nodded, and his escape light shifted, about to land on the desolate island. Suddenly, his eyes flashed. “Who's sneaking around!”</p><p>Almost at the same time as Young Master Fang's angry shout, a swift sword light suddenly flashed from the dense forest below, accompanied by an extremely sharp whistling sound, heading straight for the two of them.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Young Master Fang reacted extremely quickly, slapping the storage pouch at his waist. The blood sword that had accompanied him for many years transformed into a streak of blood-red light, intercepting the sword light.</p><p>The two flying swords clashed and separated, seemingly evenly matched.</p><p>Then, ripples of a restriction appeared in the dense forest, and three figures emerged.</p><p>“Senior Brother, it wasn't me…”</p><p>Caught in this sudden change, the older cultivator hadn't yet understood what was happening. Seeing his senior brother glaring at him fiercely, he was terrified and quickly defended himself.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Fang, don't you recognize me?”</p><p>One of them removed the mask from his face. It was Qin Sang.</p><p>The other two were naturally his Avatar and the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>He looked at Young Master Fang with an amused expression and said with some感慨, “I’ve searched the Demon Sea for three whole years, and finally, you’ve emerged.”</p><p>Since he had the strength to take revenge, he had no intention of continuing to endure silently.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that once he made a move, it would inevitably alert the Black Serpent Mountain ancestor, and the other party could easily turn the tables and set a trap for him to walk into.</p><p>He only had one chance, and his chosen target was naturally Young Master Fang. Besides, to further enhance his Avatar, he needed a high-level cultivator like Young Master Fang as a blood sacrifice to reach its peak.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed his identity and searched for clues while refining his body. After three whole years, he finally ascertained the whereabouts of the Black Serpent Mountain disciples and patiently lay in wait until now, finally intercepting his target.</p><p>Young Master Fang's cultivation was even stronger than before, already a peak Demon Core realm cultivator, only a hair's breadth away from Nascent Soul.</p><p>But as long as it wasn't a Nascent Soul cultivator, Qin Sang had absolute confidence that this person wouldn't escape his grasp.</p><p>“It’s you! You dare appear before me!”</p><p>Young Master Fang recognized Qin Sang, the person he hated to the bone, at a glance. His eyes instantly turned bloodshot, and he laughed in fury. “Good! Good! It saves me the trouble! Hand over the stone platform, and I’ll give you a quick death!”</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, “Fellow Daoist Fang hasn't forgotten the stone platform. Perhaps you should be more concerned about your own life! Kill!”</p><p>Before his voice fell, Qin Sang, his Avatar, and the Twin-Headed Serpent attacked.</p><p>The three figures abruptly separated.</p><p>Qin Sang charged straight towards Young Master Fang, while his Avatar and the Twin-Headed Serpent pounced on the Witch Clan cultivator, preparing to eliminate him first.</p><p>Seeing this, Young Master Fang was somewhat surprised. He had long since seen through the other party's cultivation level and understood that since they dared to ambush him, they must be ill-intentioned.</p><p>He had thought that it would be the late Demon Core stranger who would deal with him, but he didn't expect it to be Qin Sang.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang had already closed in.</p><p>Qin Sang's body surged with azure light, and a pair of exceptionally beautiful phoenix wings abruptly unfolded behind him, under Young Master Fang's astonished gaze.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Qin Sang's aura soared rapidly, instantly surging to a level that made Young Master Fang's expression change.</p><p>“What kind of secret technique is this?”</p><p>A strong sense of foreboding rose in Young Master Fang’s heart.</p><p>Qin Sang was clearly only at the mid-Demon Core realm, but after using this transformation technique, his aura was almost as strong as his own. At this moment, Young Master Fang truly sensed danger, his face drastically changing.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>With the phoenix wings revealed, Qin Sang's speed exploded. With a flicker, he appeared before Young Master Fang.</p><p>Demonic Qi diffused from Qin Sang’s body, his wings spread wide, like a bloodthirsty, ferocious great demon, pouncing forward.</p><p>Young Master Fang was utterly shocked, but his movements weren't slow in the slightest. Black light flashed on his body, and a strange insect carapace appeared. Then, with a flick of his arm, his blood sword erupted with scarlet sword Qi, slashing out swiftly.</p>
