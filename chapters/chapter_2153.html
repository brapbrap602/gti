<h1>Chapter 2143: The Chihua Tree</h1><p>Kinship may linger in sorrow, yet others already sing.</p><p>The Storm Realm, having endured a great upheaval of heaven and earth, then entangled with the Changyou Clan for nearly a millennium, and recently subjected to the Siyou Clan's invasion, had finally reached a time of peace and prosperity. All factions could at last live tranquil lives.</p><p>Fang Laomo's death caused only a brief ripple in the Storm Realm, quickly subsiding into calm.</p><p>Soon after, the Azure Ram Temple once again issued invitations, summoning all clans and sects to a grand celebration.</p><p>Just as rewards and punishments must be clear, the previous celebration was meant for chastisement, while this one was a gathering to recognize meritorious deeds.</p><p>That evening, the celebration concluded amidst an atmosphere of harmony.</p><p>In this great war, those who garrisoned branch altars, assisting Qin Sang in deploying Thunder Talismans, all earned their share of merit. However, the greatest contributions belonged to those who entered the battlefield, facing the Siyou Clan's army directly.  These were mostly demon soldiers, but also included cultivators from various sects, such as Huanhen.</p><p>Furthermore, their merits earned during previous battles against the Changyou Clan were also considered.</p><p>The main rewards were divided into three categories. First, the qualification to serve as an official within the Five Thunders Court. Second, those factions and cultivators unwilling to cultivate Thunder Arts could exchange their merit for assistance from Qin Sang or other experts in refining their cultivation techniques. Third, and the most anticipated by countless individuals, was the Azure Spirit Qi!</p><p>Since Qin Sang had taken the Azure Spirit Qi from the Immortal Mountain's fissure, no new Azure Spirit Qi had been produced. Now, with Mount Daiyu riddled with holes, Qin Sang dared not act rashly, suggesting that what remained was likely the last of the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>Qin Sang divided it in two, leaving a portion for the Azure Ram Temple and storing the rest within the Five Thunders Court.  Strict procedures and corresponding rules, modeled after the Dao Court’s Merit System, governed access to the Azure Spirit Qi.</p><p>Regardless of sect or school, any who accumulated sufficient merit could exchange it for a wisp of Azure Spirit Qi at the Five Thunders Court.</p><p>Azure Spirit Qi sat at the very top of the Merit Board. Unless another great war erupted, exchanging merit for it would be exceedingly difficult. To a certain extent, an excessively peaceful external environment was also a drawback.  The Dao Court's continuous expansion might stem from this very reason.</p><p>The current purpose was primarily to offer everyone a tangible hope, encouraging them to wholeheartedly embrace the Merit System and support both the Azure Ram Temple and the Five Thunders Court.</p><p>Of course, there were shortcuts to obtaining Azure Spirit Qi. One could exchange treasures, cultivation techniques, or Daoist arts obtained from the Immortal Palaces. Even fragments of these were acceptable. Qin Sang naturally hoped to acquire more fragmented treasures like the Thousand Jun Ring or the Purple Star Emperor Sword.  Even fragments comparable to the three he obtained at the Formless Immortal Sect would suffice.</p><p>Due to the overall low cultivation level in the Storm Realm, the cultivators' contributions remained limited, creating little value for Qin Sang. Therefore, the current Merit System was merely a prototype, to be gradually refined over time as the Storm Realm's overall strength increased.</p><p>Rewards on the Merit Board would also be gradually added. Future additions might even surpass Azure Spirit Qi in value, until the system reached a state of virtuous circulation.</p><p>On Qin Sang's behalf, Li Yufu outlined the Merit System at the celebration, painting a vision of a prosperous Storm Realm, and requesting the cooperation of all factions in constructing altars and establishing the Five Thunders Court.</p><p>Subsequently, all factions expressed their full support, recognizing the Merit System as a fair and virtuous policy, a cornerstone for revitalizing the Storm Realm. They eagerly dispatched their most talented members to assist in the establishment of the Five Thunders Court, resolutely upholding Lord Qin's will.</p><p>Furthermore, the celebration was also attended by tribes and sects preparing to migrate overseas.  They unanimously declared their unwavering loyalty to the Five Thunders Court, vowing to uphold Lord Qin's decrees wherever they went.</p><p>…</p><p>Azure Ram Temple's Forbidden Grounds.</p><p>Within the valley, Qin Sang sat in meditation before the stone stele of Mount Daiyu.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird flitted around the Immortal Mountain, its eyes filled with curiosity.  It repeatedly attempted to enter the mountain's fissure, only to be stopped by Qin Sang, much to its displeasure.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, teasing, "Aren't you usually fond of excitement? Last time you claimed to be my backup. Why are you cowering now, afraid to show your face?"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird landed on the stele, tucking its head, "That Daoist Nun is definitely not someone to trifle with. You'd best stay far away from her. Why not be sensible and offer your wife to her?  If you die, so be it, but don’t drag me down with you."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird was usually audacious; it was rare to see it so fearful of someone.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at it intently, "At your peak, how would you compare to her?"</p><p>"Definitely a hundred times stronger!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird proudly raised its head, its eyes full of disdain. "This Vermilion Bird could crush her with a single wing!"</p><p>Having learned about the Great Ascension without Tribulation from Ning Zhenren, Qin Sang began to reassess the 'ancients' he'd encountered in the Storm Realm.</p><p>For example, the Vermilion Bird and the Ghost Mother had been trapped in the Storm Realm for far more than three thousand years.  If they had faced the Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, they would have been reduced to ashes long ago.  The Vermilion Bird had followed him for so long without experiencing a single tribulation.  Could it be that they were previously Great Ascension cultivators?</p><p>For dignified Great Ascension stage mighty figures to be reduced to this state, was this the so-called Formless Tribulation?</p><p>The Vermilion Bird's previous boastful words might eventually come true. One day, he might indeed have to rely on it.</p><p>"It's a pity the Qilin Egg still shows no signs of hatching," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang sensed his cave dwelling's restrictions being triggered.  A sweep of his divine sense revealed the visitor's identity, and he forcibly brought the Vermilion Bird out of the forbidden grounds.</p><p>"Mingqiu greets Lord Qin!"</p><p>The newcomer was indeed Mingqiu. After the announcement of the Merit System, everyone respectfully addressed Qin Sang as Lord.</p><p>"I summoned you here for a specific task."</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Vermilion Bird on his shoulder, "Go and invite Fellow Daoist Ji Hong."</p><p>The Vermilion Bird reluctantly departed.</p><p>Qin Sang led Mingqiu into the cave dwelling and retrieved an ice casket and a wooden box. The ice casket contained the Sacrificial Insects he had collected at the Fengju Jade Gate, while the wooden box held the seeds of the flower trees they inhabited.</p><p>Back then, after acquiring the Small Cave Heaven, Qin Sang had collected the entire grove of flower trees before leaving.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon entering the Small Thousand World, the trees immediately began to wither.  Qin Sang was unable to reverse the process, nor did he have the energy to tend to them.  In the end, they all perished.</p><p>As the Chihua Trees withered, the Sacrificial Insects also began to die in droves.</p><p>Only after obtaining the Hao Bo Clan's secret art of cultivating Sacrificial Insects did Qin Sang learn how delicate these Chihua Trees were. Even though he had moved them along with the soil, even the slightest change in environment could cause them to wither.</p><p>The Hao Bo Clan had to nurture these trees with utmost care, expending considerable effort.  However, once a grove of Chihua Trees was successfully cultivated, the rewards were substantial. They served as a habitat for the Sacrificial Insects, pacifying them and making them easier to control, along with other wondrous uses.</p><p>The most valuable of these was the ability to stimulate the Sacrificial Insects to accelerate their production of Ying Crystals.</p><p>Although the Chihua forest had withered, some trees had left behind seeds, and Qin Sang had sealed the surviving Sacrificial Insects.</p><p>After thoroughly studying the Hao Bo Clan's secret art, Qin Sang found himself stuck at the very first step.  He only possessed this single Witch Clan secret art. Without Chihua Trees, he couldn't cultivate the Sacrificial Insects.</p><p>Cultivating Chihua Trees required two conditions.</p><p>The first required someone inheriting the Hao Bo Clan's legacy to continuously cast secret arts upon the trees.</p><p>Qin Sang had already passed the Hao Bo Clan's legacy to Fang Laomo. With the combined efforts of the Witch Clan experts, significant progress had been made, and some Witch Clan cultivators had begun attempting to cultivate it. This task could be entrusted to them.</p><p>The second required special spiritual herbs for irrigation, most of which were unique to the Witch Clan. After searching extensively, Qin Sang realized it was impossible to gather them all.  He had specifically invited Ji Hong from the Siyou Clan to inquire about alternative methods.</p><p>Qin Sang gestured for Mingqiu to open the ice casket, revealing the frozen juvenile Sacrificial Insects within.</p><p>He had previously collected some special Sacrificial Insects, considered Insect Kings, which would save considerable time in the future. However, Insect Kings required a large population to support them, or they would gradually degenerate. The current task was to cultivate the insect population first.</p><p>As they were speaking, the Vermilion Bird returned with Ji Hong.</p><p>Ji Hong and Qin Sang were already well acquainted.  He hopped onto the stone table and asked, "Before departing, Fellow Daoist Si Lu asked me to relay a message.  Recently, the Si Emperor has repeatedly sent envoys inquiring about the Mirage Conch, fearing that the Lu family's Mirage Conch has fallen into other hands.  How should I respond?"</p><p>"No rush. Let them stew a little longer."</p><p>Holding the Mirage Conch, Qin Sang naturally felt confident. He would wait until the Si Emperor became impatient and sent the Junior Preceptor to the Storm Sea. Then, the time would be ripe.</p><p>Ji Hong's nostrils twitched, as if he'd caught a scent. He stared intently at the wooden box. "What's inside?"</p><p>"Some tree seeds," Qin Sang smiled. "Fellow Daoist, why not open it and have a look?"</p><p>Ji Hong, unable to contain his curiosity, hopped to the wooden box.  With a *click*, the box opened, revealing several olive-shaped seeds. He carefully picked one up, his gaze fixated.</p><p>"These are Chihua Tree seeds. Are you interested, Fellow Daoist?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Ji Hong nodded repeatedly, then suddenly shook his head, exclaiming, "Difficult!  Very difficult!"</p><p>Seeing that Ji Hong instantly recognized the delicate nature of the Chihua Tree, Qin Sang knew he had found the right person. He retrieved a jade slip. "This contains an effective cultivation method.  Unfortunately, most of the spiritual herbs mentioned are lost.  Perhaps Fellow Daoist can draw inspiration from it."</p><p>Ji Hong immediately grabbed the jade slip and began scrutinizing it.</p><p>Qin Sang observed that Ji Hong's true nature shone through when he was engrossed in something. He would shake his head and mutter to himself, scratch his head in deep thought, and even lie on the table, using the jade slip as a pillow, almost appearing asleep.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, any insights?" Qin Sang inquired.</p><p>Ji Hong sat up abruptly, tapping his forehead. "I have an idea, but it's chaotic. I need quiet!"</p><p>Without even bidding farewell to Qin Sang, he grabbed the wooden box and jade slip and rushed out of the cave dwelling.</p><p>Mingqiu watched Ji Hong, amazed. Suddenly, he noticed Qin Sang's gaze and hurriedly said respectfully, "On behalf of the Witch Clan, I am willing to undertake this task and alleviate Lord Qin's concerns!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Cultivating the Sacrificial Insects is crucial to the Storm Realm's future. I will designate an area near each altar and establish a department within the Five Thunders Court specifically dedicated to cultivating Chihua Trees and Sacrificial Insects, to be named the Mountain Yu Garden.  The officials of this department, excluding the Director position, will be selected from your Witch Clan."</p><p>Mingqiu was overjoyed.  His greatest fear was that the Witch Clan would have no place in the Five Thunders Court.  With a department dedicated to them, as long as they diligently cultivated the Sacrificial Insects, they wouldn't have to worry about their standing with Qin Zhenren.</p><p>"You may take the secret art and these Sacrificial Insects back for preliminary study.  Regarding the cultivation of Chihua Trees, you may consult Fellow Daoist Ji Hong at any time," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>"Yes, Lord!"</p><p>Mingqiu bowed and retreated.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the forbidden grounds, leaving the protesting Vermilion Bird outside.</p><p>Gazing at Mount Daiyu, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>His conversation with Ning Zhenren had deepened his understanding of the Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Ning Zhenren had suggested temporarily refining Mount Daiyu using a method similar to refining magical treasures.  The purpose was to shrink the mountain's size and conceal its fluctuations, making it easier to transport into the Sacred Ground. However, he cautioned that this might accelerate the mountain’s collapse.</p><p>Possessing the Small Cave Heaven allowed Qin Sang to bypass this step.</p><p>He had spent this time in deep contemplation, arriving at a conclusion: Mount Daiyu was too fragile.  Regardless of his intentions, it would be safest to wait until he had absorbed the mountain's essence and repaired its structure.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang abandoned the idea of exploring the mountain's secrets and immersed his consciousness into the stone stele once more.</p><p>This time, with ample time, Qin Sang carefully selected the ancient restrictions within the mountain.  As he gained control over each restriction, the mountain began to transform.</p><p>The clouds and mist suddenly dispersed, fully revealing the mountain's form.</p><p>Then, a faint mist began to rise from the foot of the mountain, slowly creeping towards the summit, appearing even more ethereal than before.</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed.  When the mist once again enveloped the mountain, Qin Sang opened his eyes to a world of white.  Flying outside the mountain, he could barely sense its fluctuations. The impact on the Small Cave Heaven would also be minimized.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his right hand. The Thousand Jun Ring shimmered, and Mount Daiyu vanished, drawn into the Small Cave Heaven.</p><p>The mountain settled firmly on the ground, its misty shroud making it stand out from its surroundings.</p><p>Qin Sang waited patiently, observing that the Small Cave Heaven showed no signs of instability.  In fact, it seemed even more stable than before.</p><p>He recalled Ning Zhenren's words about the power of Immortal Mountains enhancing Dharma Domains. Nascent Soul cultivators controlled Dharma Domains, while Great Ascension cultivators could create worlds.  Could it be that Dharma Domains were a preliminary form of world creation, a prototype of a world?</p><p>If so, it was perhaps not an illusion.</p><p>Returning to his cave dwelling, Qin Sang found several transmission talismans trapped in the restrictions at the entrance. Retrieving Mount Daiyu had taken a considerable amount of time. Most of the talismans were reports from Li Yufu, indicating that construction of the transmission altars had begun.</p><p>These matters could be handled by his juniors. The only task requiring Qin Sang's personal attention was the final consecration of the altars.</p><p>As the Lord of the Five Thunders Court, Qin Sang's establishment of transmission altars here meant the Storm Realm could be considered a Prefecture, albeit a Roaming Prefecture at best.</p><p>In ancient times, Roaming Prefectures held a glimmer of hope for connecting to the Divine Court. Now, it was practically impossible, and condensing a Prefecture Merit Seal was merely a pipe dream.</p><p>After casually glancing through them, Qin Sang set the transmission talismans aside and began to reflect on his own cultivation.</p><p>Having attained enlightenment during the great war, his next focus should have been on advancing his cultivation.</p><p>Ning Zhenren had only mentioned that the Sacred Ground would open within a millennium, but he hadn’t specified the exact time.  It could be a long time from now, or it could be very soon.</p><p>The Sacred Ground would be teeming with experts, and conflict was inevitable. He needed to increase his strength in preparation for his journey. His best course of action was to refine the Heaven-Trapping Golden Lock and perfect the Four Symbols Sword Formation.</p>
