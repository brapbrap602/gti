<h1>Chapter 1979: Unbounded Corpsewalk</h1><p>Minghu Laozǔ was driven into the earth by a single sword strike.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Body arrived gracefully, materializing above the magma, sensing the situation below.</p><p>As expected, Minghu Laozǔ couldn't be slain so easily with a single sword.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword, having ascended to a spiritual treasure and wielded by a Void Refinement cultivator, possessed undeniable power.</p><p>It was unclear whether Minghu Laozǔ utilized some treasure, but to outsiders, it appeared as if he had caught the sword blade with his bare hands, directly receiving the blow.</p><p>Even with the Everbright Lamp mitigating some of the sword's momentum, it was still astonishing.</p><p>It was certain that Minghu Laozǔ was also at the early stage of Void Refinement, a similar realm to his own.</p><p>However, Minghu Laozǔ must have achieved Void Refinement much earlier and possessed a far deeper foundation.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ's Dao was different from the *Celestial Demon Refining Form*, not cultivating a Dharma Idol, but purely refining his physical body to this level.</p><p>This was the might of a Corpse Dao expert, the Unwithering Bone!</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, without hesitation, immediately forming a sword seal, causing the wind and clouds to change color.</p><p>The world's spiritual energy erupted into chaos, forming a visible hurricane of spiritual tide.</p><p>Within the void, streaks of grey energy danced wildly, sweeping across the heavens and earth, sharp as swords, forming a terrifying spectacle.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>These energies were indeed very close to sword light.</p><p>The spiritual energy of this world was under Qin Sang's complete control, transforming into countless sharp swords that roamed the sky, their momentum earth-shattering.</p><p>The void seemed to be shattered into pieces, segmented by the sword rain.</p><p>As the 'sharp swords' swept across the ground, the earth crumbled, and the magma lake continued to expand outwards.</p><p>As for the magma within the lake, it had already surged into monstrous waves.</p><p>Fortunately, the Three Corpse Demons of the Soulfall Abyss were quick-witted and decisively fled the battlefield.</p><p>If they had fallen into the sword rain, their physical bodies would have likely shattered like the earth.</p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The sword rain unanimously pointed towards the earth.</p><p>Countless sword shadows stood erect in the void, forming a forest of swords.  With a single command from their master, the myriad swords moved as one.</p><p>And Qin Sang, standing amidst the myriad swords, was their master!</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Swords fell like rain.</p><p>Individual sword shadows were almost invisible to the naked eye. Only a black torrent could be seen pouring down from the heavens, carrying an incomparably sharp aura that threatened to pierce the very earth.</p><p>Even rock couldn't resist, let alone the thin magma.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ, who had been driven into the earth by the Grey Warbler Sword, hadn't yet stopped his descent. His body was forcefully boring a hole through the earth.</p><p>An unnatural crimson glow appeared in Minghu Laozǔ's eyes, ferocious and compelling.  Feeling the sword momentum begin to weaken in his joints, he was about to counterattack when he suddenly sensed another wave of danger.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Dozens of sword shadows pierced through the earth's crust, arriving in an instant.</p><p>These sword shadows seemed to merge with the Grey Warbler Sword, or perhaps were absorbed by it, enhancing its formidable power.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ had no time to discern, suddenly feeling a violent impact. His arm was in excruciating pain, his entire body trembled violently, and his barely stabilized aura fluctuated wildly once more.</p><p>His body plummeted even faster than before, carving a bottomless hole in the earth.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Sword shadows bombarded Minghu Laozǔ like thunderbolts, striking continuously.</p><p>These sword shadows were even more dangerous than thunderbolts. Not only did they possess terrifying power, each carried an extremely sharp undulation, attempting to pierce his physical body.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ fell further and further, unable to stop his descent no matter how he tried.</p><p>His misjudgment had cost him the initiative, and he now faced an extremely passive situation.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ's entire body stiffened. He had no choice but to maintain his grip on the sword blade, exerting all his strength to resist the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>With the inexhaustible world's spiritual energy, the sword shadows seemed endless, and his arms began to tremble.</p><p>The trembling grew increasingly violent.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>An explosion resounded, like leather tearing, originating from Minghu Laozǔ's fingers, accompanied by splatters of blood.</p><p>The skin there split open, revealing bright red flesh and blood, a gaping wound.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ's flesh and blood looked no different from a living person's, not at all like a corpse.</p><p>The first crack in his skin triggered a series of explosions.</p><p>Pieces of skin peeled off his hands.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ's fingers quickly became a bloody mess, as if a layer of skin had been forcibly removed.</p><p>His expression darkened. Every part of his body had been meticulously tempered, his skin as tough as any armor.</p><p>But this armor was breached, first his fingers, then his hands, wrists, and forearms, a horrifying sight.</p><p>After the skin was peeled away, it was the turn of the flesh and blood. Layers of muscle and fascia were torn open, blood vessels flying everywhere.</p><p>Despite such gruesome injuries, Minghu Laozǔ's face showed no sign of pain, his hands still gripping the Grey Warbler Sword tightly.</p><p>Finally, the last traces of flesh and blood on his fingers were stripped away, revealing bone.</p><p>Surprisingly, Minghu Laozǔ's finger bones were a dark gold, not like human bones, but resembling incredibly hard metal.</p><p>Soon, the entire skeletal structure of Minghu Laozǔ's hands was exposed, emitting the same metallic sheen.</p><p>The bones, as it turned out, were indeed harder than skin and flesh, and did not continue to crack.</p><p>At this moment, Minghu Laozǔ suddenly let out a furious roar.</p><p>The secret technique he had painstakingly prepared in secret finally activated with difficulty.  The roar vented the rage and brutality in his heart.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The flesh on his arms suddenly exploded, peeling away like scattered flower petals.</p><p>From his wrists to his shoulders, only bone remained on both arms.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>Ten finger bones gripped the Grey Warbler Sword tightly, joints cracking.</p><p>The splattered pieces of flesh and blood merged, forming a revolting, writhing mass of crimson.</p><p>This mass of flesh and blood slammed into the Grey Warbler Sword, like the filthiest substance in the world, coating the blade.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword's spiritual light dimmed slightly.</p><p>At the cost of his arms, Minghu Laozǔ finally gained a moment's respite from the relentless assault. His eyes widened slightly, then his mouth opened wide.</p><p>The roar from his mouth transformed into a sharp shriek, a bizarre sound that could penetrate the earth, invade the mind, and shatter the soul.</p><p>Qin Sang, standing on the surface, clearly heard Minghu Laozǔ's shriek, his expression turning grave.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang sensed something amiss, his gaze sharpening as he quickly scanned the ground.</p><p>An ordinary person wouldn't notice anything unusual, but in Qin Sang's eyes, a mysterious change was occurring in this world.</p><p>The boiling magma, the turbulent spiritual energy, should have been a vibrant scene, yet Qin Sang felt an inexplicable chill.</p><p>The magma seemed less crimson and dazzling, its flow lacking its usual all-consuming momentum.</p><p>This feeling was difficult to describe.</p><p>Although there were no living creatures around, Qin Sang felt as if all vitality had been drained, leaving only 'walking corpses'.</p><p>He glanced at the edge of the magma.</p><p>Sand dunes were being continuously swallowed by the magma.</p><p>He noticed that the sand on the dunes had taken on a faint greyish-white hue.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of hot wind blew past, and a plume of smoke suddenly rose from a sand dune. The sand had inexplicably crumbled into dust.</p><p>The smoke immediately dissipated into the void, and the entire sand dune vanished, as if it had never existed.</p><p>The magma, the sand, even the earthfire flickering on the magma's surface were 'fading'!</p><p>Beneath the earth.</p><p>A strange undulation emanated from Minghu Laozǔ, silently permeating the earth, the magma, and even the world's spiritual energy in the void.</p><p>Then, this undulation carried wisps of energy back, devouring them into his body.</p><p>The Corpse Demon's body devoured the spiritual energy of this world!</p><p>If there were other living creatures on the battlefield, they would instantly be deprived of their life force.</p><p>Although sand, stone, and magma were inanimate objects, they were creations of heaven and earth. Minghu Laozǔ wouldn't let a single drop of essence escape, devouring everything!</p><p>The blazing flames fluctuated weaker and weaker, leaving only afterimages in the world.</p><p>The wind swept across the earth, scattering layers of magma and rock.</p><p>The earth's crust, riddled with holes from Qin Sang's myriad swords, finally collapsed, unable to maintain its integrity.</p><p>The earth's collapse was silent, for it had already lost its weight, devoured by Minghu Laozǔ.</p><p>After this battle, if no Void Refinement cultivator moved mountains and filled the earth to restore its former appearance, a bottomless chasm would remain in the desert.</p><p>The chasm, centered on the magma lake, would encompass the entire fissure.</p><p>Many years later, the chasm would become a legend in the cultivation world, spoken of with relish.</p><p>Qin Sang even sensed that the world's spiritual energy, which he had already controlled and transformed into swords, was faintly being devoured by Minghu Laozǔ.</p><p>The Void Refinement level Corpse Dao divine ability was truly formidable!</p><p>Qin Sang marveled, observing Minghu Laozǔ, sensing his aura surging.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ also looked up, his gaze passing over the Grey Warbler Sword, fixing on Qin Sang.</p><p>His eyes were no longer cloudy, but radiated a chilling intent to kill, his dark pupils emitting a慑人 gaze.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderous sound erupted from the earth, the sound of bones cracking.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ suddenly changed his grip from claws to a fist, striking out fiercely.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>This punch was aimed directly at the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>The fist was bare bone, its luster deep and restrained, yet Qin Sang sensed an immense threat.</p><p>Just as the fist was about to explode with power, Qin Sang's heart tightened involuntarily, as if this punch would drain the void itself, its point the center of the universe.</p><p>The power of this punch was unimaginable.</p><p>The bone fist slammed into the sword blade.</p><p>In an instant, the Grey Warbler Sword also emitted a brilliant light, countless sword shadows converging on the blade.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The impact of fist against sword sent shockwaves rippling through the chasm, causing turbulent waves that ravaged its interior, effortlessly widening its circumference.</p><p>At this moment, it was clearly impossible to capitalize on the opportunity and slay Minghu Laozǔ with a single sword strike.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wouldn't allow Minghu Laozǔ to counterattack and reverse the favorable situation he had created with the bronze pillar as bait.</p><p>He made a decisive move, instantly changing his sword seal.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>Within the chaotic chasm, the clear sound of a sword's hum resonated.</p><p>Darkness, emanating from an unknown source, completely obscured the sun in the sky, engulfing the chasm.</p><p>This wasn't complete darkness; there was starlight within the darkness.</p><p>Stars hung high, seemingly distant, yet also close at hand.</p><p>Qin Sang vanished within the sea of stars, his presence untraceable.</p><p>At the same time, Minghu Laozǔ lost all sense of the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>After the first punch, Minghu Laozǔ immediately threw a second, but it missed its target.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ's expression shifted slightly as he found himself immersed in a sea of stars.</p><p>Although his fists were powerful, within the vast expanse of the star sea, he felt a sense of helplessness.</p><p>“Sword Formation!”</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ saw through the nature of the star sea.</p><p>His enemy was a Sword Cultivator, definitely not that old fool Gu Yunsou!</p><p>The situation had changed too quickly. Minghu Laozǔ hadn't had time to think. From the moment he was ambushed to now, the two of them had turned this place upside down in mere breaths.</p><p>A sword formation?</p><p>Break it with a single punch!</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ was eager to turn the tables, to regain the initiative.  If he remained entangled within the sword formation, he would be at the enemy's mercy.</p><p>Having lost his target, Minghu Laozǔ didn't retract his fist.  He didn't bother observing the changes in the stars or attempting to decipher the sword formation, instead striking fiercely at the void.</p><p>The so-called boundless expanse was merely an illusion created by the sword formation. How could Minghu Laozǔ not understand?</p><p>If one's cultivation was insufficient, illusions could become reality, but as long as his fist was powerful enough, the sword formation would eventually reveal its flaws.</p><p>Overwhelming power breaks all techniques!</p><p>The master of the sword formation naturally wouldn't remain idle.  The starlight in the sky flickered, and several star swords descended, transforming into giant swords of starlight, slashing at Minghu Laozǔ.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>With repeated heavy punches, he shattered the giant star swords one after another.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ stood beneath the starry sky, like a god of war, facing the celestial enemy.</p><p>His eyes flashed like lightning, a sneer appearing on his face.</p><p>As expected, when the enemy was eager to kill him and activated the sword formation, he would inevitably reveal some clues.</p><p>He couldn't instantly decipher the sword formation, but it was a great help in resolving the current situation.</p><p>“Unbounded Corpsewalk!”</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ growled.</p><p>His body suddenly transformed into a gust of eerie wind, ethereal and intangible, causing the giant star swords to slash at empty space.</p><p>The eerie wind was intangible, seemingly unbound by the sword formation, blowing through every corner of the star sea before reforming.</p><p>However, when Minghu Laozǔ reappeared, he wasn't alone.</p><p>Beneath the starry sky, below each star sword, a figure of Minghu Laozǔ appeared, all looking up at the sky, each throwing a heavy punch.</p><p>There was no need to deliberately search for the main star.  As long as all the star swords were destroyed, the sword formation would naturally collapse.</p><p>Seeing this bizarre sight, Qin Sang raised an eyebrow.</p><p>The formidable Unwithering Bone was truly not to be underestimated!</p><p>He had used the Seven Constellations Sword Formation countless times against enemies, but this was the first time he had encountered such a direct countermeasure.</p><p>Qin Sang could tell that Minghu Laozǔ wasn't bluffing; this divine ability was extremely powerful.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang unleashed the final move of the Seven Constellations Sword Formation.</p><p>Stars gather baleful energy, White Tiger roars at the heavens!</p><p>A ferocious tiger swooped down, heading straight for one of the countless figures – Minghu Laozǔ's true body.</p><p>Immense divine might rushed towards him. He could clearly see the tiger's sharp claws and teeth, threatening to tear him apart.</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ snorted coldly, undaunted. He advanced, changing his fist into a palm, his movements eerie and ghost-like, striking at the tiger's forehead.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Minghu Laozǔ shuddered, his skin and flesh rupturing all over his body, blood splattering everywhere, but he remained indifferent.</p><p>He had thought that transforming baleful energy into a tiger was the final change of the sword formation, but after exchanging a blow with the White Tiger's baleful aura, just as he was about to regroup, he suddenly found himself enveloped by an even more dazzling starry sky.</p><p>The enemy's attack was relentless, giving him no time to breathe.</p><p>A new expanse of stars had appeared to the south of the original star sea, doubling its size.</p><p>The starlight in the south was slightly hazy.</p><p>Faintly, there seemed to be a touch of firelight.</p>
