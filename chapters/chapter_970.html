<h1>Chapter 962: Lake Bottom</h1><p>Qin Sang wasn't particularly interested in the demons' plans; those were matters for the Yuan Ying stage cultivators of both races.  Although he wasn't a cultivator from the Canglang Sea and desperately wanted to return to Xiaohan Domain, as a human cultivator, he wasn't averse to lending a hand if he could.  He wouldn't hesitate to kill any demon spies if given the opportunity.</p><p>Unfortunately, these demons all hailed from the major clans of the Demon Sea, possessed extraordinary bloodlines, and were incredibly powerful. Caiyi Xianzi and Gu Heng, descendants of the Xuanfeng and Jiao Long clans respectively, possessed top-tier demon bloodlines and strength beyond compare. Their escape techniques were astonishing, leaving Qin Sang quite shaken.</p><p>Once his cultivation and physical body both broke through, his escape techniques should surpass these two demons.  Right now, however, he had little confidence in escaping them. If he showed any weakness or acted rashly, he would face a simultaneous attack from seven top-tier experts. His usually proud escape techniques were rendered ineffective against these powerful demons.</p><p>Qin Sang, his external avatar, Bai (who hadn't fully recovered from overexertion), and the two-headed snake could only handle three of them at most, and even then, victory wasn't guaranteed.  These demons were highly intelligent, not easily fooled.  They wouldn't stand there to be struck by lightning.  Against their combined might, the effectiveness of the *Yireishu* (lightning summoning technique) was limited.</p><p>Even if he got lucky and managed to critically injure one or two by surprise, the remaining demons would swarm him while he was casting spells.  It's a case of outnumbered, and even with the San Guang Jade Liquid, he'd likely have no chance for another attack and find himself in grave danger.</p><p>His only option was to maintain his disguise flawlessly, avoid detection, and find an opportunity to escape. Qin Sang's mind raced, desperately searching for a solution.</p><p>At that moment, Caiyi Xianzi spoke, saying calmly, "I found that place in the Flower Fairy Lake. I searched for a long time before I found it. Don't worry, it's not the bottom of the lake; the toxins aren't that potent.  Anyone without poison resistance techniques, take one of these pills made from the venom gland of a thousand-year-old viper. They'll protect you from the poison for an hour."</p><p>As she spoke, Caiyi Xianzi produced a jade bottle containing several oddly colored pills. Gu Heng and Caiyi Xianzi didn't take any, nor did the gloomy man with Gui Che bloodline. Yuan Zhu, also of the Jiao Long clan, readily accepted a pill.</p><p>Caiyi Xianzi offered the bottle to Qin Sang.  Qin Sang, relieved after escaping a crisis, quickly and repeatedly refused. He was secretly grateful for the fat silkworm; otherwise, his disguise as a Bi Jiu descendant would have been exposed immediately by the mere poison mist.</p><p>Seeing that it was a poison-resisting pill, Qin Sang sighed. If it had been a treasure that repelled poison, he could have easily disabled someone once the fight started, but the Bloodlight couldn't be used.</p><p>After the demons took the pills, Gu Heng gave the order and they all activated their escape techniques, silently heading towards Flower Fairy Lake. Qin Sang tried to fall behind, but the demons moved in an orderly fashion, maintaining close proximity, giving him no chance to escape. He had to wait until they were in the Flower Fairy Lake to look for an opening.</p><p>Yuan Zhu was very talkative, flying alongside Qin Sang, chattering incessantly about his fantasies of achieving great merit, receiving rewards, and the carefree life he’d have after his transformation tribulation.  Fearing exposure, Qin Sang could only nod and stammer in response.</p><p>Fortunately, they weren't far from Flower Fairy Lake, and soon they reached one of the entrances.  Just like the other entrance, an ancient wooden bridge was there, with countless flower petals dancing in the air. A dreamy scene, yet concealing deadly poison.</p><p>Upon seeing the bridge, Gu Heng waved his hand forcefully. The demons stopped. Gu Heng vanished momentarily, then reappeared after a quick investigation near the lake, beckoning the others to follow.</p><p>Qin Sang had been to Flower Fairy Lake once before, but due to the Cui Ji incident, he hadn't had time to explore it.  Flower Fairy Lake, one of the three infamous poisonous lands, was also considered the most beautiful place within the Seven Kills Hall.  Basking in the sunlight, the lake was brightly colored and dazzling.</p><p>Thick poisonous algae, at least a man's height at their shortest, reached the height of ancient trees in places, densely packed and emitting faint green fluorescence, like a sea of dazzling light. Some algae were still budding, most were already in full bloom.</p><p>Seed-like blossoms danced on the breeze, a swirling, surging ocean of flowers.</p><p>Beyond the wooden bridge, a green luminescence was clearly visible.</p><p>But upon crossing, the sky was a breathtaking, transparent blue.</p><p>For a moment, they felt as if they were underwater, the fluttering petals resembling beautiful jellyfish drifting in the sea.</p><p>A heavy, unfamiliar scent filled the air.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately ordered Fei Can to deploy anti-toxin armor. The fragrance came from the pollen of poisonous algae – a potent toxin that even eroded spiritual energy and consciousness.</p><p>Some of the other beasts, slower to react, began to cough violently, hastily activating the power of their pills to alleviate their symptoms.  Fear was etched on their faces.</p><p>"The Flower Fairy Lake is not easy to conceal our movements. Stay vigilant!  Kill any cultivator you encounter,"</p><p>Gu Heng said coldly.</p><p>The demons responded, emerging from their enchantment with the beauty, their eyes scanning their surroundings.</p><p>The wooden bridge was nestled amongst countless poisonous algae.  As far as the eye could see, the algae stretched into the depths of the Flower Fairy Lake, disappearing into the distance.</p><p>The lake wasn't flat; mountains rose from its surface. Although the area was exceptionally bright, visibility was strangely limited, the depths shrouded in darkness.</p><p>Poisonous swamps were everywhere, but the danger wasn't confined to them.</p><p>Within the aerial flower sea, barely perceptible ripples occasionally appeared—signs of ancient restrictions. No one dared to test their power.</p><p>Cai Yi, familiar with the path, led the way.</p><p>The bridge was long, extending deep into the Flower Fairy Lake.</p><p>They soon reached its end.</p><p>Cai Yi warned the demons briefly, then leaped into the air.  However, she flew low, weaving through the algae. The demons followed her example, flying at low altitude.</p><p>Qin Sang, amongst the demons, was restless, his gaze darting around as he considered escape routes.</p><p>A cunning plan formed: he could remain amongst the demons, leading them to the Yuan Ying cultivator on the barren plains.  He could then escape amidst the ensuing conflict.</p><p>However, Qin Sang quickly dismissed the idea.  He risked exposure at any moment; the longer he stayed with these beasts, the greater the danger. It was too risky; he might be attacked before even escaping the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, the demons, navigating the dense algae, ventured deeper into the Flower Fairy Lake.</p>
