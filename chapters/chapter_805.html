<h1>Chapter 797: The Power of the Fire Pearl</h1><p>Fortunately, the Star Conch’s power was weakened when it was obstructed during its attack on the Golden Yao Lock.</p><p>Qin Sang remoulded the demonic fire, and at the same time, the two-headed beast focused its wind blades, finally managing to block the Star Conch.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Demons fire and wind blades flew wildly everywhere.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two-headed beast both turned pale, their figures flying backward before barely regaining their footing.  Both were greatly shocked.</p><p>The Star Conch, exhausted, lost its blue glow, revealing a jade-white sheen. The hooked-nose man retrieved it, his brow furrowed slightly, seemingly dissatisfied.</p><p>Qin Sang stared in astonishment. The Star Conch clearly surpassed a mid-grade magic weapon, but Qin Sang couldn’t determine its exact rank.</p><p>The conch showed no obvious signs of refinement; its entire body was seamless, as if naturally formed—a type of magic weapon Qin Sang had never encountered before.</p><p>Its power was unquestionable.</p><p>But what surprised Qin Sang was that the hooked-nose man didn’t continue the attack with the Star Conch, instead pocketing it and charging again.</p><p>“Dare to enslave a spirit beast! You’ll die for that!”</p><p>The hooked-nose man’s killing intent intensified upon seeing the two-headed beast.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two-headed beast fought back, but the hooked-nose man’s offensive was like thunder.  Even fighting together, they felt overwhelmed and were steadily forced back.</p><p>The vision was filled with fists and the blue rainbow-like flashes of light.</p><p>Qin Sang manipulated the Ten Directions Yama Banner, striving to defend and create openings, while the two-headed beast fought alongside him, sometimes releasing illusions, sometimes gathering wind blades.</p><p>They fought and retreated, moving through the storm, occasionally using the hurricane to gain a moment's respite.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a close eye on the hooked-nose man’s movements, fearing another sneak attack with the Star Conch; he had no second Golden Yao Lock, and the loss of this treasure pained him greatly.</p><p>During this time, the hooked-nose man didn't use the Star Conch again.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if the weapon's use might require a certain cost or a period of charging, hence its infrequent use.</p><p>However, the hooked-nose man was extremely cunning, so Qin Sang dared not relax.</p><p>What worried Qin Sang was that even after all this fighting, he hadn't found a suitable opportunity to strike, and had to endure the relentless assault.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, Qin Sang couldn't prevent the opponent from closing in.</p><p>He could clearly see the man's face.</p><p>“I have to admit, for someone of your cultivation, managing to escape this long is quite impressive. In time, humanity would have gained another top expert.  Unfortunately, you met me…”</p><p>The hooked-nose man sneered.</p><p>Although it seemed a long fight, the actual time was short, with Qin Sang mostly on the defensive.</p><p>But in this dangerous place, every extra moment brought a greater chance of an accident.  The hooked-nose man was quickly losing his patience.</p><p>Wings like blades cut through the demonic fire.</p><p>The two-headed beast's eyes widened, about to block the attack, but sensing the power of the wings, it whimpered, and turned to flee.</p><p>Simultaneously, the ebony sword was struck aside by the hooked-nose man's fists.</p><p>The hooked-nose man suddenly unleashed a fierce attack, leaving Qin Sang wide open.  The man rapidly closed in, and seeing this, Qin Sang immediately activated a magic talisman and fled towards a gap in the hurricane.</p><p>Suddenly, the hooked-nose man raised his hand, the Star Conch reappearing.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and sidestepped.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the hooked-nose man smirked; he didn’t use the Star Conch, but his wings blazed with light, his speed dramatically increasing. As he closed in on Qin Sang, a plume of thick green smoke shot from between his eyebrows, directly towards Qin Sang's face.</p><p>Qin Sang cried out inwardly, quickly dodging. He suddenly smelled a strange odor, feeling dizzy and drowsy.</p><p>“Poison!”</p><p>Qin Sang yelled in his mind, a sudden flash of insight illuminating his thoughts.</p><p>At that moment, the green smoke enveloped him.  Affected by the smoke, he failed to fully escape, stumbling before being completely engulfed, his escape route cut off.</p><p>The hooked-nose man let out a triumphant laugh, his figure flashing, appearing beside the smoke cloud, ready to capture Qin Sang, when suddenly his face changed drastically. He roared in anger and fear, retreating rapidly, terror etched on his features.</p><p>Qin Sang's collapse was a ruse.  He hadn't expected the hooked-nose man to cultivate poison techniques, but the appearance of the green smoke gave him his opening!  The fat silkworm secretly protected him with its anti-venom armor.  Qin Sang waited for the perfect moment, finally unleashing the fire pearl.  The hooked-nose man reacted swiftly, but it was too late.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The fire pearl shot towards the hooked-nose man, piercing his protective aura with ease. Even his vaunted physical strength proved utterly inadequate against the pearl.  A tiny flame flickered on its surface, burning through his skin and destroying him from the inside out.</p><p>*Gasp… gasp…*</p><p>The hooked-nose man made strange gurgling sounds, his eyes vacant. Apart from a small hole in his chest, there were no other wounds, yet he was completely lifeless.  A cold light flashed from the small hole; ice spread rapidly from within, engulfing his entire body. His internal organs were already frozen solid.</p><p>Unharmed, Qin Sang, protected by his demonic fire, flew out from behind the green smoke and risked everything to grab a bracer from the dead man.  He sensed the other bone flute fragment was hidden within.  Then he took the star conch—a treasure that would compensate for the loss of the Jin Yao lock—he had a vivid memory of.  Quickly, he snatched the man's pouch and fled.</p><p>*Crack…*</p><p>A top-tier expert, completely frozen, was shattered into ice shards by the waves, vanishing without a trace. In its place was a ball of blue flame.  Unbound, the cold flame’s power erupted, freezing a large area of the sea.  However, these ice formations were quickly destroyed by a hurricane.</p><p>The cold flame’s power caused intense chaos.  Surrounded by the hurricane, wind and fire intertwined, brewing a terrifying energy. Qin Sang knew he had to leave immediately, not bothering to examine his spoils. He hurried to join the two-headed… *[creature's name]*</p><p>…</p><p>妖海 (Yao Hai).</p><p>An unnamed island, an unnamed mountain.</p><p>Deep within the mountain, a vast cave was filled with elaborate yet crudely fashioned furnishings.  A human-head sized crystal sat on a stone table, containing a sealed green feather.</p><p>Suddenly, the feather vibrated violently. The crystal groaned, then exploded with a deafening roar.</p>
