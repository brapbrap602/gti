<h1>Chapter 1009: Three Entrances to the Seven Kills Hall</h1><p>Qin Sang trailed behind the group, communicating secretly with Bai.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the edge of the storm zone.</p><p>The cultivators present were all powerful, and without hesitation, they charged in. Qin Sang summoned his sword energy for protection, and with a flash, entered the storm.</p><p>Having been forced deep into the storm zone before, Qin Sang was adept at navigating the hurricane.</p><p>He moved freely through the storm zone, his speed second only to the Nascent Soul cultivators, making him among the first to reach the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>Seeing the Seven Kills Hall's celestial array again, Qin Sang saw a drastically different scene.</p><p>Before, the array's power was stable, like a gray wall of wind, its might not outwardly apparent.</p><p>Now, with the Seven Kills Hall emerging, the impact on the array caused the wind wall to dissipate. The array was like the eye of the storm, with violent winds sweeping in all directions, spiritual tides surging, and terrifying waves crashing, possessing the power to tear everything apart.</p><p>Its power surpassed even the raging spiritual tides deep within the storm zone.</p><p>Standing far from the periphery, Qin Sang could still clearly feel the extremely violent power of the array. It was hard to imagine the dangers that awaited those who entered.</p><p>Entering the Seven Kills Hall required courage.</p><p>At this time, Qin Sang noticed a faint red glow at the center of the array, like the rosy light of dawn rising from the seabed.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang was struck by an idea, recalling the red-hued celestial restrictions in the inner hall of the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>He suspected that the source of this glow was likely the outwardly manifested red light of the restrictions.</p><p>"Is the Seven Kills Hall about to emerge?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked down slightly, his gaze fixed on the glow.</p><p>Ahead of him, two Nascent Soul masters stood motionless at the edge of the array, seemingly waiting for a specific moment. He patiently waited, not rushing to enter the array.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>The glow rose very slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated the time; it took eight or more hours for the glow to finally rise from the seabed to a level where he could look at it directly, after which it almost stopped.</p><p>At that moment, the Nascent Soul cultivators in front suddenly moved.</p><p>One summoned a flying sword, the spiritual sword circling around him and enveloping two disciples beside him.  He unleashed an extremely complex sword technique, transforming into a sharp sword light and disappearing into the array in a flash.</p><p>The other person materialized a dark-colored treasure armor around himself and took a light step, appearing otherworldly, and 'walked' into the array alone.</p><p>In other directions, the other Nascent Soul cultivators also moved simultaneously.</p><p>After the two Nascent Soul cultivators left, Qin Sang dashed to the edge of the celestial restriction.</p><p>Feeling the power of the restriction up close, a serious look appeared in Qin Sang's eyes. After pondering for a moment, he suddenly changed his aura, wings appearing behind him as he used the Sky Demon Transformation.</p><p>Then, he swept his divine sense through the Qianjun Ring, and the Sky Corpse Coffin flew out, transforming into a suit of armor that completely enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>Having done this, Qin Sang summoned the ebony sword and, feeling confident, lightly tapped the spiritual sword, creating a sword wheel to lead the way, and dashed into the array.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang left, two figures arrived one after the other, landing there.</p><p>"Senior Brother, did you see that? That person ahead didn't seem ordinary, extremely high in swordsmanship."</p><p>One of the young men narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the direction in which Qin Sang disappeared.</p><p>He was also focused on the sword path; he had sensed the fluctuations in sword energy and, excited by the prospect, had changed his mind and hurried here, but he was still too late, missing the main event.</p><p>The other said, "Those who dare to enter the Seven Kills Hall alone are no ordinary people. We should go too, or we'll miss our chance. Remember, if you feel overwhelmed, turn back immediately; don't force it. If we get separated in the array, meet at the Heavenly Pagoda."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Before the words were finished, the two entered the array side by side.</p><p>The same scene played out repeatedly.</p><p>Unaware of the brief incident outside, Qin Sang was fully focused on dealing with the array's onslaught.</p><p>After entering the array, Qin Sang felt like a small boat inadvertently caught in a stormy sea, without support.  Without the protection of a jade talisman, he had to be extremely cautious every moment, as a single mistake could cost him his life.</p><p>He focused his mind, using his sword wheel to cut through the waves.</p><p>Thanks to his evasion skills far surpassing those of cultivators at the same level, Qin Sang was able to dodge every impending crisis, which saved much more energy than simply resisting.</p><p>As Qin Sang delved deeper, the power of the celestial array became increasingly chaotic and dense, leaving less and less room to maneuver.  He also felt a subtle but growing pressure bearing down on him, causing his true essence to stagnate, filling him with a sense of foreboding.</p><p>He could only push the ebony sword to its limit, relentlessly consuming his true essence to carve a path through the array.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the pressure on the Nascent Soul cultivators was even greater.  Those who had to protect their disciples faced even more difficulty, moving slower than Qin Sang.</p><p>A deafening roar echoed around him.  Qin Sang had no idea how long it would take to traverse the array, and pressed on relentlessly.</p><p>Suddenly, the pressure vanished.  Qin Sang seized the opportunity, unleashing a swift strike with his ebony sword, and finally glimpsed what seemed to be the interior of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Confirming there was no immediate danger, he darted inside.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Landing from his flight, Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, a look of surprise on his face. "I didn't emerge from the wasteland. This place… seems to be quite close to the Flower Fairy Lake?"</p><p>He looked up and saw that the entire sky above the outer hall of the Seven Killing Hall was shrouded in turbulent clouds, a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>"Previously, it was like an entrance forcibly opened from the outside, and that wasteland was probably the weakest point of the celestial array.  Now that the Seven Killing Hall's emergence is disrupting the surrounding array, the entire outer hall can be considered its gate. So, entering from anywhere will lead you to that spot, and leaving should be the same..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, piecing together the situation. He wasn't worried about being ambushed on his return, but accidentally falling into an ancient restriction or a perilous place like the Flower Fairy Lake would be disastrous.</p><p>Hiding in the shadows, he confirmed that no other cultivators were nearby before moving to a vantage point and observing the inner hall.  The tall tower was clearly visible.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed intently.  The cloud-like celestial restriction covering the inner hall, viewed from afar, resembled celestial fire on the horizon or slowly flowing liquid glass, breathtakingly brilliant and dazzling.</p><p>However, a gap had appeared.</p><p>As Ning Wu Hui had mentioned, that was the entrance to the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>A strong sense of familiarity washed over him. Qin Sang immediately took flight in that direction.  Upon seeing the sight before him, he finally understood the source of that feeling.</p><p>Simultaneously, he also understood why this secret realm was called the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>At the entrance to the celestial restriction stood an ancient palace.  A plaque hung high above the entrance, bearing the inscription — Seven Killing Hall!</p><p>The style of these three characters was clearly from the same source as the "Purple Micro Palace" inscription on the Heavenly Gate of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p>
