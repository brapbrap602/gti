<h1></h1><p>Perhaps in its urgency to return and digest the rainbow-colored energy mass, the insect cloud, unlike before, no longer plundered the vitality of all it passed, but hurried back to its nest.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm gnashed its teeth, cursing and swearing.</p><p>It had obtained the Amber Insect Crystal, but at the cost of some of its primordial essence. Although this wouldn't cause irreversible damage, it would require a long period of quiet recuperation to recover, delaying its advancement.</p><p>In its simple mind, not getting an advantage was the same as suffering a loss, as the previous time with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the gradually disappearing insect cloud, still recalling the recent experience, which he found remarkably strange.</p><p>The True Insect King was, at the very least, a spirit insect that had undergone four transformations!</p><p>Wild spirit insects that had undergone four transformations were indeed rare.</p><p>Firstly, the difficulty for spirit insects to grow was extremely high.</p><p>Secondly, wild spirit insects were adept at concealing themselves. Some spirit insects skilled in stealth divine abilities could, with deliberate concealment, deceive the perception of even higher-level enemies.</p><p>However, this True Insect King's divine ability wasn't simply stealth.</p><p>Otherwise, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly would certainly have detected its presence.</p><p>In the insect-controlling scriptures of both clans, the descriptions of the Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies were only a few brief sentences, depicting them as a swarm with only simple instincts, seemingly nothing worth mentioning.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Insect King of the Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies was so peculiar.</p><p>"Hmm, perhaps there is no Insect King, but rather a mutation of the swarm's collective consciousness."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the feeling of being watched by the swarm and this thought flashed through his mind. Then, another possibility occurred to him, "Perhaps the True Insect King is actually another spirit insect, with a special divine ability, enslaving this swarm of Corrosive Phosphorescent Fireflies..."</p><p>Pondering these questions, Qin Sang intended to retrieve the Amber Insect Crystal for examination, but unexpectedly, Fatty Silkworm had already stuffed the crystal whole into its mouth and was struggling to swallow.</p><p>Its small eyes darted around, clearly wary of Qin Sang.</p><p>It knew that Qin Sang had two other spirit insects, and the coquettish butterfly was the most favored.</p><p>In truth, the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had shown no interest in the Amber Insect Crystal.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled helplessly. Could he really snatch the treasure this fellow had exchanged its primordial essence for?</p><p>After swallowing the Amber Insect Crystal, Fatty Silkworm dragged its bulging body back, its eyelids starting to droop, unable to conceal its exhaustion, almost falling asleep on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang roughly checked it, confirmed that there were no abnormalities, and let it return to slumber, hoping that Fatty Silkworm would be able to advance after refining the insect crystal.</p><p>With this matter settled, Qin Sang returned to the stone cave, seeing Zhou Ruan and the other were obediently staying within the spirit array. He then took them along, making their way out of the Heaven's Rift Valley, stopping and starting as they went.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside Heaven's Rift Valley.</p><p>Three figures flew slowly through the mountains and forests.</p><p>"Reporting to Senior, ahead is the Daoist temple where we cultivate, the Tower-Gazing Temple."</p><p>Zhou Ruan and the other led the way, Zhou Jin occasionally turning his head to introduce the surrounding terrain to Qin Sang.</p><p>This place was thousands of miles away from Heaven's Rift Valley, even more barren than other areas, with few cultivators around.</p><p>The Tower-Gazing Temple had some fame in the mortal world, but no one would have imagined that a small Daoist temple was hidden in the back mountain of the Tower-Gazing Temple, inhabited by cultivators.</p><p>A temple hidden in the mountains and forests.</p><p>The environment was very quiet and secluded.</p><p>Zhou Ruan was an orthodox descendant of the Daoist sect. The founder of the Tower-Gazing Temple had chosen to establish a place of practice in the Northern Barrens for unknown reasons. The lineage had continued ever since, though it could not be called prosperous, with only the two of them in this generation.</p><p>There were also a few young Daoist acolytes staying in the temple, disciples of Zhou Jin.</p><p>They resided in the Daoist temple for a few days.</p><p>Ruan Yu completely absorbed the medicinal power of the Snake Shadow Grass, and her chronic illness improved, her originally sallow complexion gaining a bit of rosiness.</p><p>At this moment, however, there was no joy on her face, only worry.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to take Zhou Jin with him, guiding him through the most chaotic part of the Northern Barrens and dropping him off at the border of the Nineteen Prefectures of Misty Rain, then parting ways.</p><p>He would turn west.</p><p>Zhou Jin would enter the Nineteen Prefectures of Misty Rain alone.</p><p>He had made his decision, and Zhou Ruan did not have the courage to refuse, only able to silently endure the pain of separation.</p><p>"Junior Sister, rest well in the temple. I will go and return," Zhou Jin pretended to be relaxed, squeezing Ruan Yu's thin shoulder. He mounted his sword and soared into the sky, flying out of the Daoist temple without looking back, catching up to Qin Sang.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>...</p><p>The Nineteen Prefectures of Misty Rain, also known as the Central Plains by the cultivators of the Northern Barrens, didn't actually have a clear boundary with the Northern Barrens.</p><p>The division into nineteen prefectures was said to be related to the past struggle between Buddhism and Daoism. Originally, there were only the six core prefectures of Jiangzuo, and the old Central Plains referred to these six prefectures. Later, it gradually expanded, encompassing the seven prefectures of the Western Route, the four prefectures of the Northern Lands, and the two prefectures of the Southern Barbarians, forming the current格局 (géjú - structure/pattern), collectively known as the Nineteen Prefectures of Misty Rain.</p><p>Misty rain and empty mountains, a magnificent and sacred scene.</p><p>The four prefectures of the Northern Lands bordered the Northern Barrens.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhou Jin walked out of the Northern Barrens, first entering Ze Prefecture, one of the four prefectures of the Northern Lands.</p><p>Ze Prefecture.</p><p>As the name suggests, boundless waters and marshes.</p><p>In fact, the entire four prefectures of the Northern Lands were filled with mountains, marshes, and lakes. The six prefectures of Jiangzuo also had well-developed water systems, but they were far less rugged than the four prefectures of the Northern Lands, which often featured ten-thousand-mile-long marshes and thousand-fathom-high peaks.</p><p>It was said that ninety percent of Ze Prefecture was covered by marshes and lakes, shrouded in clouds and mist, vast and sparsely populated.</p><p>The mountain cities and marketplaces of Ze Prefecture were like isolated islands in a lake, making one unfamiliar with the area feel as if they had entered the East Sea.</p><p>A streak of遁光 (dùnguāng - escaping light) sped across the lake surface,匆匆 (cōngcōng - hurriedly) landing on a green peak. It was Zhou Jin.</p><p>He walked to the top of the peak, to a sheer cliff face, and bowed to the stone wall.</p><p>"Senior Qin, I've inquired. A thousand miles south from here is Muguan Yuan. There's a Hall of Six Prefectures in the city, said to be the northernmost branch."</p><p>'Yuan' can be seen as a city in the cultivation world, a large marketplace, common in the Nineteen Prefectures of Misty Rain. Other places might call them market towns or prefectural counties.</p><p>The Hall of Six Prefectures was an organization similar to a merchant guild, with a deep background and well-informed sources.</p><p>It was named the Hall of Six Prefectures because it originated in the six prefectures of Jiangzuo. Later, it gradually grew stronger, defeating many competitors, and its influence spread throughout the nineteen prefectures, becoming one of the most widespread merchant guilds in the Central Plains.</p><p>The name Hall of Six Prefectures has been used to this day.</p><p>After Zhou Jin finished speaking, there was no response from within the cliff. He still maintained a respectful posture, waiting quietly for a while. Suddenly, a flash of light appeared on the cliff, and Qin Sang walked out from within.</p><p>"Catch!"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand and tossed an object to Zhou Jin.</p><p>Zhou Jin hurriedly caught it with both hands. It felt soft, almost weightless. Upon closer inspection, it was a cloud-like gray light veil, appearing extremely light. It was actually a magical treasure.</p><p>"I see you are not proficient in escape techniques, unable to escape in times of crisis. This treasure is called Thousand-Mile Mist. After you refine it, use it to conceal your aura. When necessary, you can also ride it to fly."</p><p>Qin Sang said lightly. The Thousand-Mile Mist was something he had casually refined using materials from demonic beasts hunted in Heaven's Rift Valley.</p><p>Compared to the Northern Barrens, the Nineteen Prefectures of Misty Rain were a land of peace and prosperity, but in the cultivation world, there was never absolute peace. Zhou Jin helped him investigate information, so he first had to ensure his survival.</p><p>Zhou Jin was overjoyed, "Thank you, Senior, for the treasure!"</p><p>Traveling together, although Qin Sang was not talkative, he was not unapproachable, and he was nothing like a demonic cultivator.</p><p>Zhou Jin encountered difficulties in his cultivation, hesitated for a long time, and tentatively asked Qin Sang for guidance. He unexpectedly received answers, concise yet insightful.</p><p>At this time, his feelings towards Qin Sang were not entirely fear, but also respect. He was determined to do his best. Perhaps, not only could he cure his Junior Sister's chronic illness, but this could also be an opportunity for them.</p><p>"This time, you will enter the Central Plains alone. Every so often, leave a token at the Hall of Six Prefectures. After I have finished my business, I will return and contact you through the Hall of Six Prefectures..."</p><p>The two flew towards Muguan Yuan. Qin Sang gave instructions, and Zhou Jin carefully memorized them.</p><p>Arriving near Muguan Yuan, Zhou Jin bowed to Qin Sang in farewell and disappeared into the vast marsh.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed in place for a while, then entered the city alone.</p><p>The clamor entered his ears.</p><p>In Ze Prefecture, due to the vast and sparsely populated nature of the land, not only the Yuan cities and market towns, but even the scale of mortal settlements was far greater than elsewhere.</p><p>Muguan Yuan was said to be controlled by three major powers, intertwined and complex. Qin Sang had no interest in understanding these, as he would not be staying long.</p><p>The purpose of entering the city this time was, firstly, to establish contact with the Hall of Six Prefectures for future convenience, and secondly, to purchase a topographical map of the Western Desert and all kinds of information.</p><p>The Hall of Six Prefectures.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately released a wisp of Nascent Soul cultivator aura. As soon as he entered the Hall of Six Prefectures, he was invited into a quiet room and received personally by the manager.</p><p>This manager was actually a Golden Core stage cultivator, but he looked like a fat merchant, with two mustaches, smiling and amiable, completely lacking the appearance of an immortal.</p><p>The manager glanced at Qin Sang and bowed, "Forgive this junior's lack of insight, but may I ask Senior's honored name and the location of your immortal abode?"</p><p>"This old man's surname is Qin, and I am a rogue cultivator from overseas."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was calm.</p><p>"Senior Qin."</p><p>The manager was enlightened, "So Senior comes from the immortal islands of the East Sea. It's only that this junior is lacking in experience... Senior should not yet have a Six Prefectures Token, right?"</p><p>With that, the manager took out a token and presented it with both hands, "The Hall Master has ordered that the Six Prefectures Token is only given to Nascent Soul Seniors. No matter where you are, as long as Senior shows this token, all branches will do their utmost to serve Senior."</p><p>Qin Sang had received many such things in the North Sea.</p><p>He took it indifferently and asked, "I heard that your hall is well-informed. Do you have any knowledge of the Western Desert?"</p><p>The manager nodded repeatedly, not asking Qin Sang's purpose. He excused himself, left the quiet room, and soon returned, holding a jade slip in his hand. "This is the latest map. However, due to the limitations of our hall, and the vastness and ever-changing nature of the Western Desert, it is impossible to cover the entire Western Desert. It is most detailed only in the areas close to the seven prefectures of the Western Route. There are also some rumors circulating from the Western Desert, all of which are included and given to Senior Qin free of charge."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was displeased, "Do you think this old man would cheat you out of a few spirit stones?"</p><p>The manager repeatedly said he dared not, urgently explaining, "Senior, please understand, this has always been the rule of our Hall of Six Prefectures. Such information is always provided free of charge to Nascent Soul cultivators. For no other reason than to form a good relationship."</p><p>"Hehe, your hall has great魄力 (pòlì - boldness/resolution), no wonder you can grow so large."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and accepted it readily.</p><p>Taking the jade slip, Qin Sang immediately saw Nine Brahma Mountain, which was still a Buddhist holy land.</p><p>...</p><p>After a short stay in Muguan Yuan, Qin Sang left the city and headed west towards Nine Brahma Mountain to meet up with Liuli.</p><p>This journey was easy to navigate. Qin Sang only needed to follow a large river called the Heavenly Tuo River all the way west to reach Nine Brahma Mountain.</p><p>Leaving Ze Prefecture and passing through Sai Prefecture, the northernmost of the seven prefectures of the Western Route, one would enter the Western Desert.</p><p>In the western part of Sai Prefecture, one could see a landscape similar to the Western Desert.</p><p>Vast Gobi, desolate as far as the eye could see.</p><p>However, the banks of the Heavenly Tuo River were always lush with vegetation, and the scenery outside the Great Wall was not inferior to the six prefectures of Jiangzuo.</p><p>Even in the Western Desert, it was not all desert and Gobi. The hinterland was not lacking in oases, rivers, and lakes, and there were also fertile lands, very abundant.</p><p>For example, in the northern region of the Western Desert, the source of the Heavenly Tuo River, the Snow-Capped Continuous Mountains, the melted snow from the mountains nourished a large area of oases, forming vast rivers that flowed through the Central Plains and eventually into the East Sea, making it one of the most important rivers in the Central Plains water system.</p><p>Legend has it that the Snow-Capped Continuous Mountains were the place where Buddhism flourished, and there were many Buddhist holy lands, of which Nine Brahma Mountain was only one.</p><p>Over the years, the Western Desert was no longer the domain of Buddhism alone. Disciples of the Daoist sects had come out to spread their teachings, taking root in the oases of the sandy sea, establishing sects and schools.</p><p>There were also many unorthodox sects and demonic cultivators who chose to go west instead of entering the Northern Barrens. Although not as chaotic as the Northern Barrens, the situation was also very complex.</p><p>Of course, the Snow-Capped Continuous Mountains were still the reserved land of Buddhism, and external forces found it difficult to penetrate.</p><p>Along the banks of the Heavenly Tuo River, Buddhist temples and monasteries were as numerous as the stars in the sky, visible everywhere, countless. This river was also the pilgrimage route for Buddhist followers in the Central Plains.</p><p>Buddhism, which was extremely declining in the North Sea and the Canglang Sea, was one of the most important forces in the Central Plains, enough to contend with Daoism.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled with Buddhist followers, calling himself a lay practitioner, with the title of Bright Moon Wanderer.</p><p>He cultivated the *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal*, so he could be considered somewhat related to Buddhism.</p><p>Leaving Sai Prefecture, the scenery became increasingly desolate. Even the moisture of the Heavenly Tuo River could not resist the erosion of the wind and sand. The oases on both sides of the river were gradually compressed, and the vegetation became increasingly sparse.</p><p>Entering the hinterland of the Western Desert, the scenery was almost indistinguishable from the Beichen Great Desert of the Beichen Realm. Qin Sang was not surprised, hurrying along, making almost no stops along the way.</p><p>It was not until he reached the edge of the Snow-Capped Continuous Mountains that it gradually became prosperous again.</p><p>Green trees were like shade, and vegetation was lush.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a Gobi Desert, looking towards the depths of the oasis. He saw the white peaks of the mountains, temples standing majestically among the snow-capped mountains, and the radiance of Buddha shining everywhere.</p><p>"I wonder if Liuli has arrived."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, recognizing the direction of Nine Brahma Mountain, and flashed away.</p><p>Nine Brahma Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared at the foot of the mountain, gazing at the huge city wall surrounding the mountain top.</p><p>As expected, in the center of the city wall, on the top of the mountain, a Buddhist temple was also built, and it was the largest Buddhist temple he had seen on his westward journey.</p><p>Among the peaks of the Snow-Capped Continuous Mountains, Nine Brahma Mountain was not particularly majestic or steep.</p><p>The reason it became a holy land was related to a Buddhist sage who once cultivated here. The Buddhist temple was the place of practice of that sage.</p><p>The mountain path was crowded with people, not lacking Buddhist cultivators, but they, like mortals, chose to walk up the mountain to show respect.</p><p>Nine Brahma Mountain was not entirely known as a Buddhist holy land.</p><p>Because it was located at the southern foot of the Snow-Capped Continuous Mountains, it was also the gateway from the southern desert into the Snow-Capped Continuous Mountains, and the order in the city was stable, undertaking the duties of a marketplace and trusted by nearby cultivators.</p><p>Therefore, many people on the mountain path were not dressed as monks, and Qin Sang was not out of place.</p><p>He observed for a while and found that the expressions of these Buddhist cultivators were somewhat strange, with a seemingly accumulated resentment and anger. According to Buddhist teachings, the嗔念 (chēnniàn -嗔恚/anger) should be severed. These Buddhist cultivators were clearly not up to par in their cultivation.</p><p>It would be normal for one or two people to be like this.</p><p>It was strange that so many Buddhist cultivators were like this.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the mountain path, entered the city, deliberately acted ostentatiously, revealing the name of Bright Moon Wanderer, and then found the most famous inn and settled down.</p><p>He rested briefly in the room, washing away the dust of travel, and also waiting for Liuli to find him.</p><p>If Liuli had not arrived, he would first inquire about the situation in the Western Desert himself, looking for information related to the Buddhist bone relics.</p><p>Before dusk, the restriction on the room door was triggered. Qin Sang's heart stirred, a smile appearing on his face, and he opened the door.</p><p>"Please come in."</p><p>A figure wearing a cloak flashed in. It was Liuli!</p>
