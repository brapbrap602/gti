<h1>Chapter 846: The Lándǒu Sect</h1><p>With utmost urgency, they journeyed day and night.</p><p>Deep within the Demonic Sea, they dared not attract attention.  Forced to remain hidden, cautiously avoiding the notice of demonic beasts, everyone's nerves were taut. Within a few days, they were exhausted and had to stop to rest.</p><p>The journey was harrowing.</p><p>Large islands once occupied by cultivators had become demonic nests, the cultivators vanished without a trace. The smaller islands they passed also showed clear signs of demonic beast activity, bearing the scars of slaughter.</p><p>Qin Sang seized every possible moment to cultivate during their travels.</p><p>Half a month after their departure.</p><p>One evening, they happened upon a small island and landed to adjust their breathing and restore their true essence.</p><p>The four took turns keeping watch, with Bamboo Mountain Elder currently on duty.</p><p>Qin Sang found an open space, sat down, and set up a simple barrier around himself. As the sun's power waned in the sky, he raced against time to cultivate the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula*.</p><p>The *Celestial Demon Refining Formula* draws upon stellar energy to temper the physical body. To outsiders, it appeared to be a cultivation method that utilizes the power of the celestial bodies. No one could guess that Qin Sang was cultivating a demonic art.</p><p>With others nearby, it wasn't convenient to use the bone flute to cultivate, which slowed down the absorption of stellar energy. However, it remained a top-tier body refining secret art.</p><p>After entering the second level, the foundation he had previously laid became less effective, and his progress slowed down.</p><p>Having learned from Old Zou that the next opening of the Seven Kills Hall would be in just over forty years, Qin Sang felt a greater sense of urgency.</p><p>With his deepening understanding of this cultivation method, Qin Sang estimated that, with the *Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit Chapter* stalled, if he cultivated the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula* to the mid-stage of the third level and activated the Demonic Transformation, he would possess the terrifying power of a peak Core Formation cultivator, enough to confront one of the Swordsmen of the Sword Path!</p><p>Even though he was still at the second level of the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula*, Qin Sang had a premonition that his physical power and true essence could complement each other, and the benefits of dual cultivation of body and magic would exceed expectations.</p><p>A thought arose in Qin Sang's mind: Could this be the true path?</p><p>If he could find another top-tier cultivation method to strengthen his primordial spirit and cultivate his divine sense, the simultaneous cultivation of all three would grant him unimaginable power, easily surpassing cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>Unfortunately, this was merely a fantasy.</p><p>Not to mention that such top-tier cultivation methods had long been lost to the river of time, and he had been fortunate enough to obtain two, both incomplete. Even if such a cultivation method existed, cultivating three top-tier methods simultaneously would be impossible in the resource-scarce current cultivation world.</p><p>The consequence of dividing his focus would be regret when his lifespan was exhausted.</p><p>If the *Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit Chapter* hadn't encountered a bottleneck, Qin Sang wouldn't have focused his main energy on the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula*, at least not before forming his nascent soul.</p><p>There was hope for the Hairy Mountain Vine, with only the Scorpion Venom Herb missing.</p><p>As long as he could break through in time, there was a high chance of reaching the mid-stage of the third level before the Seven Kills Hall opened.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the Seven Kills Hall might be opened multiple times before its next natural emergence, but he didn't dare to slack off or delay in the slightest.</p><p>Life was unpredictable, and chaos frequently arose in the Boundless Sea.  Unforeseen circumstances were inevitable, and he had to seize the present.</p><p>He looked up at the starry sky, closed his eyes, and entered a meditative state.</p><p>A clear radiance enveloped him, drawing the surrounding starlight to converge around his body.</p><p>The stars flowed, and the moon drifted westward.</p><p>At dawn, Qin Sang sensed his barrier being touched, woke from his meditation, glanced at the time, and saw that it wasn't time to depart yet. He found Bamboo Mountain Elder standing outside the barrier.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Bamboo Mountain, is something the matter?"</p><p>Qin Sang removed the barrier and invited him in.</p><p>Bamboo Mountain Elder nodded and walked in with a smile, his gaze sweeping over the surroundings.</p><p>Traces of starlight remained, not yet fully dispersed.</p><p>Curiosity flickered in Bamboo Mountain Elder's eyes.  He opened his mouth and said, "While I was on watch earlier, I sensed the island's stellar energy converging towards Fellow Daoist. I was curious and disturbed Fellow Daoist, please forgive me. Is Fellow Daoist cultivating a rare celestial cultivation method? By any chance, do you have any connection to the Lándǒu Sect?"</p><p>"The Lándǒu Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback. He recalled that the Lándǒu Sect was a relatively powerful sect in the Inner Sea. Their mountain gate was located in a sea region northwest of Tianxing Island, not too far away. Qin Sang had heard of it several times.</p><p>"This poor cultivator does indeed cultivate such a method, but I have never had any dealings with the Lándǒu Sect. Why does Fellow Daoist Bamboo Mountain ask?"</p><p>"Then I must have guessed wrong."</p><p>Bamboo Mountain Elder pointed at the rapidly dispersing stellar energy and explained, "Fellow Daoists who cultivate stellar energy are not common in the cultivation world.  It's said that such cultivation methods differ. If I'm not mistaken, Fellow Daoist seems to be directly drawing stellar energy into your body. This method is extremely dangerous and can easily damage one's foundation, making it quite rare. It reminds me of an old acquaintance of my master. Back then, I was but a nameless novice who had just entered the path of cultivation, while that senior was already a Core Formation cultivator and an elder of the Lándǒu Sect. I served tea when he visited my master and met him once. The scene of him cultivating was similar to Fellow Daoist's, and seeing this brought back a sense of familiarity. I thought Fellow Daoist might be his descendant."</p><p>"It must be a coincidence. I've never encountered any cultivators from the Lándǒu Sect before, and I obtained this cultivation method by chance.  As far as I know, among the three most renowned inheritances of the Lándǒu Sect, there seem to be two Five Elements cultivation methods, divided into Wood and Earth, and a Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art, which is said to be extremely difficult to cultivate.  They don't have this type of cultivation method. Fellow Daoist Bamboo Mountain, do you remember that senior's name?"</p><p>Qin Sang had been searching for places with concentrated stellar energy, inquiring everywhere for information and gathering news about the inheritances of famous sects, but he hadn't found any well-known celestial cultivation methods.</p><p>On the other hand, he only needed one more of the three spiritual herbs, so there was great hope.</p><p>"I only remember that senior's Daoist title was Resting Cloud Master.  I haven't heard anything about him since."</p><p>Bamboo Mountain Elder shook his head regretfully. "The Lándǒu Sect has stood in the Inner Sea for many years. It wouldn't be surprising if they possessed other cultivation methods besides their three main inheritances, but it's extremely difficult to achieve greatness without cultivating one of the inheritances.  Senior Resting Cloud Master likely didn't accomplish much in the end and faded into obscurity."</p><p>"Perhaps..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and chatted with Bamboo Mountain Elder for a while. Immortal Maiden Yue and Kong Yun also woke up one after another, and they decided to set off early.</p><p>As they flew, Qin Sang pondered Bamboo Mountain Elder's words.</p><p>He had clearly stated his Daoist title and background. Bamboo Mountain Elder shouldn't have fabricated it to get closer to him. There was no conflict of interest between the four of them, and there was no reason for him to do so.</p><p>So, could the Lándǒu Sect possess a cultivation method similar to the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula*?</p><p>It definitely wouldn't be the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula* itself. He had likely traveled tens of thousands of miles and been incredibly lucky to gather the three bone flutes to obtain this cultivation method.</p><p>However, the human race had produced countless brilliant predecessors, and it wouldn't be surprising if someone had comprehended a cultivation method similar to the *Celestial Demon Refining Formula*.</p><p>Bamboo Mountain Elder was right. Even if they were both cultivation methods that drew upon the power of celestial bodies, there would be significant differences.  The *Celestial Demon Refining Formula* was the most brutal and dangerous kind.</p><p>Breaking through realms was even more terrifying, requiring the forceful channeling of stellar energy into the body.</p><p>If Resting Cloud Master cultivated this type of method to reach the Core Formation stage, would he have similar requirements for breakthroughs?</p>
