<h1>Chapter 1858: Earth-Shattering Changes</h1><p>“Senior Brother Zuo?”</p><p>Liu Zhenren, standing beside Zuo Zhenren, noticed the change in his expression and softly asked.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Zuo Zhenren let out a long breath and opened his eyes.</p><p>They were still on the edge of the sea of fire, countless green flames flickering like ghost fires behind them.  After the upheaval caused by the emergence of the Divine Court, the altar had been relatively calm. The flames in the sea of fire were stable, and the surrounding view was expansive, making this area safer than most others.</p><p>Seeing Zuo Zhenren awaken, Liu Zhenren quickly described the scene he had witnessed, secretly observing Zuo Zhenren’s complexion. Zuo Zhenren’s complexion was somewhat rosier, but Liu Zhenren sensed no significant change in his vital energy, unsure of the extent of his injuries.</p><p>“Even if Senior Brother Zuo recovers, I fear it will be too late…”</p><p>Liu Zhenren glanced towards the South Heavenly Gate. He didn't know the purpose of their journey, but the sight of the South Heavenly Gate had left an unforgettable impression.  During this time, experts from both sides must be converging there, leaving them far behind.</p><p>At that moment, Liu Zhenren suddenly noticed a change in Zuo Zhenren’s expression. He saw him subtly turn his head, frowning towards the southeast.</p><p>Following Zuo Zhenren’s gaze, Liu Zhenren extended his senses but detected nothing unusual. His spiritual perception was far less acute than Zuo Zhenren’s, and a wave of anxiety washed over him. He quickly scanned his surroundings, his face filled with apprehension.</p><p>“Wait here, and be careful. I’ll be right back,” Zuo Zhenren gazed into the distance, pondering for a moment before giving instructions and rising to leave.</p><p>“Senior… Protecting you is my duty, Senior.”</p><p>Liu Zhenren hastily stopped Zuo Zhenren, his face filled with worry.  “I don’t know what’s wrong out there, Senior. Your injuries…”</p><p>Before he could finish, Zuo Zhenren interrupted him with a wave of his hand. “It’s alright! I faintly sense a familiar energy fluctuation, possibly an old adversary, seemingly engaged in a struggle with someone. I’ll go take a look. If it's a fellow Daoist from our sect, we must try to rescue them.”</p><p>Looking towards the depths of the altar, Zuo Zhenren sighed softly, “Countless illusions separate us from the South Heavenly Gate. By the time we arrive, the battle will likely be over, making any intervention useless. If I can save a fellow Daoist and reduce our sect's losses, it won't be in vain, even if it means sacrificing my remaining cultivation…”</p><p>Hearing this, Liu Zhenren wisely fell silent. Since Zuo Zhenren dared to go, he must have confidence and be able to suppress his injuries.  Zuo Zhenren would be more mobile and easier to conceal alone; bringing Liu Zhenren along would only increase the risk of exposure.</p><p>“Be careful, Senior.”</p><p>Liu Zhenren bowed respectfully.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren nodded, stepped into the void, and vanished in a few blinks.</p><p>…</p><p>At that time, a cultivator and a demon were locked in a frantic chase amidst the illusions.</p><p>The illusions here weren't as vast as the sea of light; in a short time, they had already passed through over a dozen illusions.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not relax for a moment.  Ling You Wang was pursuing him relentlessly.  Even though he understood the layout of this place, it was difficult to set traps under Ling You Wang’s watchful gaze.</p><p>A demon king's spiritual perception was exceptionally sharp. Without careful planning, it was impossible to lure the opponent into a trap.</p><p>Nevertheless, Qin Sang had to try.</p><p>‘Rumble… ’</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! ’</p><p>Lightning flashed, bringing gusts of violent wind.</p><p>This illusion was a wind domain. The wind was crimson, making one feel as if they were above lava, yet the place was extremely cold, even colder than the other illusions filled with ice and snow.</p><p>Past scenes flashed through his mind.</p><p>There was nothing usable in this place, but there was something in the next illusion that he could try.</p><p>“Whoosh…”</p><p>After rushing through the crimson cold wind for a while, Qin Sang suddenly felt warmth. The crimson color disappeared ahead, replaced by jade-like flowing light. Multicolored brilliance, like a dream, unfolded before him in a breathtaking panorama.</p><p>The flowing light constantly danced, and within it were inconspicuous, slender pillars of light, perpendicular to the sky. They were few in number, appearing only where different streams of light intersected, and disappearing after a short time.</p><p>Qin Sang rushed into the flowing light. The black fish Dharma image, carrying dark waves, immediately pursued, pausing slightly outside the flowing light. Its deep eyes gazed for a moment, before the sound of rushing water resounded, as giant waves crashed through the entrance!</p><p>The flowing light showed no unusual behavior during the chase.</p><p>Qin Sang, using his celestial eye divine ability, fixed his gaze on the dark waves. His eyes flickered, and he sped between two streams of light.</p><p>Soon, the black fish Dharma image caught up. Just as the first wave of dark waves spread, a pillar of light, only about the thickness of a thumb, suddenly condensed between the two streams of light.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang heard a thunderous roar behind him, like a collapsing mountain. A giant light ring visibly formed, drawing the flowing light into its center.  A shadowy figure could be glimpsed within, disappearing instantly, leaving the fate of the black fish Dharma image unknown, seemingly swallowed.</p><p>Qin Sang had barely begun to feel relieved when a long, dark shadow emerged from the base of the light halo.  Moving with incredible speed, it effortlessly broke free from the halo's confines, disappearing beneath the churning waters.  Through the Tianmu Butterfly, Qin Sang saw the mocking glint in Ling You Wang's eyes, a sight that chilled him to the bone.</p><p>He tried twice more to evade the demon king, only managing to briefly delay him.  This encounter deepened Qin Sang's understanding of the formidable power of the Ling You Wang.</p><p>However, the pursuit had continued for some distance, with the demon king always trailing behind. This lack of decisive action suggested the chase was genuinely beyond his capabilities.</p><p>“If I can just reach the forest region…” Qin Sang mused, his initial panic subsiding as he considered how to leverage the terrain to his advantage.</p><p>Suddenly, a sense of unease washed over him.  He quickly scanned his surroundings, finding nothing amiss. They were traversing a desolate, arid desert, the dry wind whipping up swirling sand.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang detected an unnatural humidity in the air.  Understanding dawned, a shock rippling through him.</p><p>The air grew heavy with moisture, the ground dampened. The earth began to tremble, a low rumble of water echoing from his left.</p><p>In a blink, a colossal wave, a thousand zhang high, appeared in the Tianmu Butterfly’s view, sweeping across everything in its path.  The wave’s power was awe-inspiring.</p><p>“Could it be…?” Qin Sang instantly guessed the source of the wave.  Knowing Ling You Wang's true form was a fish demon, and his mastery over water magic, Qin Sang realized that the demon king had deliberately avoided water-related illusions during his escape.  Near the desert was an illusion of a bottomless pool.  This water…it must have been drawn from that pool.</p><p>To manipulate the power of an illusion, and to transcend the boundaries between them - even after self-restricting his power, the demon king could still perform such feats! Qin Sang's heart pounded as he changed course.</p><p>Behind him, the black fish form rose upright, its head slightly cocked, facing the pool and inhaling deeply.  Its mouth gaped open, revealing rows of sharp teeth.</p><p>Outside the desert, the previously still pool was now agitated, its water rising dramatically as if a dragon were sucking it up from above. A massive column of water was drawn towards the sky, its destination unknown.</p><p>The area where the desert met the pool was in chaos, the earth crumbling into a storm, yet unable to stop the torrent of water surging into the desert like a dragon, whipping up furious waves, the moisture creating heavy rain clouds that blotted out the sky.</p><p>The black fish form abruptly turned its head, fixing Qin Sang with a murderous gaze, then darted towards the rain clouds.</p><p>“Crash!”  A torrential downpour suddenly erupted over the desert, thick moisture filling the air.  The rain fell with a strange rhythm, the water vapor condensing around Qin Sang, forming a cage of rain.</p><p>Sensing the danger, Qin Sang's surrounding sword light paused, and his Yunyou Sword shot out.</p><p>The water vapor around him thickened to the point of resembling an ocean.  A blinding light erupted, the void shimmering and distorting, forming an enormous fish, its body the size of a mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself directly in the fish's mouth. Before he could react, a terrifying suction force erupted beneath him, his flight faltering, and he plunged downwards.</p><p>“Rumble…”  He felt like a ship caught in a storm, surrounded by raging waves, wind, and rain.</p><p>Just as it seemed he would be swallowed whole, the Yunyou Sword trembled, its light exploding outward, instantly growing a thousand zhang long, slashing at the giant fish.</p><p>“Boom!” The power of the single sword strike could shatter mountains. The fish's mouth was cleaved open, the sword light unstoppable, splitting the fish's head.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the suction weaken considerably.  Without hesitation, he furiously flapped his phoenix wings, charging upwards.</p><p>“Crack!”  A bolt of lightning shot from the fish's mouth, as the suction continued to lessen.</p><p>At that moment, the unsettling feeling returned, stronger than before.  He didn't dare delay, ordering the Tianmu Butterfly to unleash its full power.</p><p>His vision transformed into a watery expanse.  Once he saw the rain clouds above and the giant fish below, the source of his unease became clear, sending a jolt of terror through him.</p><p>The next moment, the bolt of lightning abruptly halted in mid-air, before reversing course and plummeting back into the fish's mouth – a clear case of self-destruction.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang felt the world turn upside down. The space itself seemed to flip.  The desert was still below, the illusion unchanged.</p><p>Keyu Yun appeared beneath Qin Sang, while a giant fish hovered above, its body unharmed, looking down at Qin Sang with its mouth agape.  Qin Sang was already within its jaws; had he not been alert, he would have been swallowed whole without realizing it!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated the immense power of Ling You Wang's spell. His reaction was too slow; not only did his Yunyou Sword miss, but he himself failed to escape in time as the fish's mouth snapped shut.</p><p>In this critical moment, a golden sun slowly rose behind Qin Sang.</p><p>The golden light illuminated the fish's mouth, shining through its head and dyeing the surrounding rain clouds a pale gold.</p><p>Immediately, the giant fish radiated golden light.</p><p>It was as if a sunny morning had broken through the rain, with a golden fish swimming within the sun.</p><p>Its golden scales shimmered, the gaps between them widening as the fish's body began to disintegrate.</p><p>Even under the impact of the Sun Wheel Seal, the fish's mouth remained tightly closed.  Its body rapidly shrank and twisted violently.</p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p>The desert was impacted, the earth cracked, and rainwater immediately filled the fissures.</p><p>At that moment, a red glow suddenly flashed within the fish's body, like a fiery red arrow piercing outwards from within.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding the Sun God Tree in one hand, looked grave. The Sun Wheel Seal couldn't destroy the giant fish, so he had to use the Sun God Tree again.</p><p>He was also ready to activate the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>He had possessed this treasure for many years, nurturing it constantly. Though he hadn't tamed its spirit, he could unleash the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light without awakening it.</p><p>However, one strike would disturb the spirit, and repeated use might awaken it, leading to internal and external troubles. He would need to calm it afterward, so he rarely used it.</p><p>Nine Sun God Birds struck the fish's body.</p><p>From the outside, a noticeable red spot appeared on the fish, rapidly expanding.</p><p>Terrible flames erupted from the red spot, streams of fire releasing astonishingly violent power, finally tearing a wound in the fish's body!</p><p>Golden sun, flowing fire!</p><p>With divine abilities and treasures unleashed, Qin Sang finally broke free.</p><p>Before the red fire dissipated, lightning burst forth from within.</p><p>The giant fish desperately tried to fill the wound with water vapor, but ultimately failed, allowing Qin Sang to escape.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>Qin Sang ran towards the vapor without looking back.</p><p>The rain clouds continued to pursue, finally showing signs of exhaustion and began to retract.</p><p>The rain clouds covered the desert, and the black fish apparition appeared in the clouds, gazing at Qin Sang's back, its dark eyes showing ripples of emotion.</p><p>Then, it glanced back, and a sigh echoed from the clouds.</p><p>That spell required five talismanic positions to cast.  He had used the apparition and the water from the deep pool, creating a spectacle comparable to before, but its power was only sixty or seventy percent of its peak.</p><p>Although he lured his opponent into striking, he did not expect him to still hold back.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this attack would never have failed so easily. But this time was different; the forcibly condensed fish body was inherently unstable, and by drawing water into the desert, he was simultaneously attacking both the desert and Qin Sang.</p><p>This wasn't an ordinary desert, but a transformation of an ancient spell.</p><p>At this moment, Ling You Wang was essentially facing the rejection of heaven and earth. His all-out attack could only be sustained for a short time, leaving him to helplessly watch Qin Sang escape.</p><p>Qin Sang also noticed something amiss, but unsure if Ling You Wang had another scheme, he didn't dare relax, making sure to get as far from the deep pool as possible.  He planned to avoid other bodies of water along the way to prevent a repeat of the ordeal.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>The black fish apparition swung its long tail, riding a rain cloud to continue the pursuit.</p><p>Without anyone to maintain the water vapor, the rain cloud issued a thunderous roar and completely collapsed, the torrential rain evaporating before it could reach the ground.</p><p>The desert returned to dryness, without a trace of moisture.</p><p>The deep pool stirred with a final ripple before calming down.</p><p>While rushing out of the desert, Qin Sang kept his eyes on his pursuer, noticing Ling You Wang in hot pursuit.  He had just used a powerful spell, yet showed no sign of weakness.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the battlefield.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren was also flying through the illusion, occasionally glancing towards the South Heavenly Gate.</p><p>Gradually, the fluctuations ahead became increasingly obvious, clearly perceptible even through the illusion, like guiding lights.</p><p>The moment Ling You Wang summoned the water from the deep pool, Zuo Zhenren paused, his gaze sharp as he stared intently for a moment, then looked back towards the blue sea of light before speeding towards the battlefield.</p><p>As they drew closer, Zuo Zhenren initially intended to slow down and reduce his presence. But he found that he would quickly be left far behind, so he took out a talisman.</p><p>He rubbed his two fingers together, the talisman spontaneously combusting and transforming into a pair of fiery wings.  As they fluttered, they left a trail of fire that persisted.</p><p>…</p><p>After this battle, Qin Sang's energy was severely depleted. He was weak and running frantically through the illusion, his desperation apparent to Ling You Wang.  Unbeknownst to Ling You Wang, he was getting closer and closer to the forest domain!</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>On the return train, I will edit later.</p><p>Thank you all for your concern. The deceased have passed, but the living must move forward and live up to the expectations of our elders.</p><p></p>
