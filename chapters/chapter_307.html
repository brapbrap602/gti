<h1>Chapter 300: Human-headed Birds</h1><p>As the words were spoken, darkness suddenly fell upon them, and the human-headed birds lunged at Ge Yuan with a howl. Ge Yuan's pill theft had clearly angered them.</p><p>One of them was smaller, but much faster than the others. Its feathers were hard as wrought iron.</p><p>With a beat of its wings, the human-headed bird became a black streak, arriving above Ge Yuan's head in an instant. Its sharp claws shone with cold light as they closed in on his head.</p><p>The sudden eruption of this human-headed bird's aura was terrifying, even scaring Qin Sang. It was a Late-stage Demon Spirit!</p><p>Apart from it, the other human-headed birds were much weaker. Only one was an Early-stage Demon Spirit, while the rest were mundane.</p><p>No wonder Luo Xingnan and his team had failed to gain an advantage. Facing a Late-stage Demon Spirit, not being killed by the claws of the human-headed birds was already impressive.</p><p>Also, they seemed to be missing someone.</p><p>Only Luo Xingnan, Wandering Child, Shangguan Lifeng, and White Robe Scholar remained.</p><p>Elder Gong was gone!</p><p>Ge Yuan himself was even more terrified.</p><p>This human-headed bird was terrifyingly strong, two whole levels above him.</p><p>Even during normal times, he would find it difficult to escape from this human-headed bird, let alone now, after being sent flying by Luo Xingnan's jade fork. He was at his most vulnerable, and his aura was unstable.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The human-headed bird spread its wings, and the raging wind enveloped by its demonic powers pressed Ge Yuan to the ground, easily destroying his attempt to escape.</p><p>Ge Yuan was terrified. He saw himself on the brink of death by the claws of the bird.</p><p>Just when things reached a critical point, fortunately, Wandering Child moved quickly and threw a yellow copper ring.</p><p>'Swish, swish...'</p><p>The copper ring released a dense yellow light, then split into dozens of identical images in midair, all hitting the human-headed bird.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after being hit by the copper ring, the human-headed bird staggered back and roared in anger. The other human-headed birds seemed to know the power of the copper ring and retreated with cries of alarm.</p><p>Ge Yuan finally found an opportunity to turn around and flee as light.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and noticed that the formation of Wandering Child and the others had not been broken. Everyone was controlling the same yellow copper ring.</p><p>This was a set of forbidden instruments!</p><p>A sense of understanding dawned on Qin Sang. No wonder they didn't seem too flustered when facing the Late-stage Demon Spirit. It was because of this set of forbidden instruments that they had the ability to fight back.</p><p>Otherwise, they would have met the same fate as Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>"What are you doing?!"</p><p>Luo Xingnan glared at Wandering Child, annoyed by his unauthorized intervention.</p><p>Wandering Child's expression remained calm. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the low point of the outer formation is almost over. We don't have much time left. Each additional helper is an extra source of power. We must suppress this beast as quickly as possible and free up some people to gather the herbs. That should be our priority!"</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also received a voice transmission from Wandering Child, who informed him that Elder Gong was dead.</p><p>Like Ge Yuan, he had triggered the enchantment while gathering herbs and alerted the human-headed birds.</p><p>However, Elder Gong was unlucky. He was the human-headed birds' first target, and its claws pierced through his skull, killing him instantly. He had no chance to fight back.</p><p>The others were terrified by this sight and dared not fight alone. They hurriedly gathered together to fend off the monsters' siege. Wandering Child took out this set of forbidden instruments called the Golden Ring Formation, which barely allowed them to hold their ground and withstand the human-headed birds' attacks.</p><p>Even with the help of the Golden Ring Formation, killing the human-headed bird was nearly impossible, and they didn't have time to keep fighting it.</p><p>The only thing they could do was use the power of the forbidden instruments to trap the human-headed bird and free up some people to get the herbs and then escape!</p><p>Luo Xingnan snorted coldly, seeming to accept Wandering Child's explanation. He urged the copper ring to create countless images and continue attacking the human-headed bird. At the same time, he swiped his palm over the copper ring, splitting it into two and tossing them to Qin Sang and Ge Yuan. He said without a doubt, "You two team up to block these birds. I'll go out and gather the herbs!"</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Wandering Child stopped Luo Xingnan. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the monsters are powerful. Without you, we may not be able to suppress them. I think it's better to send Clear Wind Daoist to gather the herbs. We can then divide the herbs equally on the spot."</p><p>Luo Xingnan's face stiffened as he suddenly realized something amiss.</p><p>Luo Xingnan glared with increasing anger at Qin Sang, Ge Yuan and the itinerant monk Yun Youzi, and swore, "Old geezer, are they your men?"</p><p>"I wouldn't say they are anyone's men. I've simply made the acquaintances of these two fellow Taoists," Yun Youzi said calmly.</p><p>"Fine! Excellent!"</p><p>Luo Xingnan smiled in extreme anger, exclaimed "excellent" twice, and said in a voice filled with malice, "The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind it! I shall concede defeat this time! You old geezer, you dare to plot against me? You're daring indeed! Are you not afraid I will kill you?"</p><p>"Fellow Taoist Luo, do not exaggerate!"</p><p>Yun Youzi was not in the least intimidated by the murderous glare Luo Xingnan directed at him. He glanced at Shangguan Lifeng and the white-clad scholar and said, "Esteemed fellow Taoists, we have all ventured into this treacherous place in search of treasures. Unlike Yu Kong, we bear no great grudge against you, Fellow Taoist Luo. Nor has this old man ever thought of harming you, so how could I have plotted against you? From what I have observed, the majority of the spirit medicines on this mountain have been destroyed by these creatures, but seven of them still remain intact. The warding enchantments surrounding the spirit medicines are extremely powerful, and the creatures dare not force their way through. There are six of us present, more than enough for each of us to take one plant. Your earlier promise reflected this as well. Why did you become so angry when I mentioned splitting them equally? Has Fellow Taoist Luo been stringing us along?"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Confronted directly by Yun Youzi and his finger pointed at the heart of the matter, Luo Xingnan's expression suddenly became rigid. His glare burned with anger and shock.</p><p>Not giving Luo Xingnan another chance to speak, Yun Youzi ignored Shangguan Lifeng and addressed the white-clad scholar. "Esteemed Taoist, what are your thoughts?"</p><p>The white-clad scholar glanced at Luo Xingnan and Shangguan Lifeng, and hesitated for a moment under Luo Xingnan's piercing gaze. "I feel that Fellow Taoist Yun Youzi's words are not without merit."</p><p>As he spoke, the white-clad scholar subconsciously moved closer to Yun Youzi.</p><p>However, Yun Youzi did not wish to press Luo Xingnan too hard, lest he lose his reason. He added, "It will take us much effort to break these enchantments, and Daoist Qingfeng may find it difficult to do it alone. Why not let Fellow Taoist Luo assign someone to work with him? That way, they should have no trouble. Furthermore, we owe our presence here to Fellow Taoist Luo's foresight. It is only fitting that he should take two of these seven spirit medicines. What do the esteemed Taoists think?"</p><p>With Elder Gong surnamed dead, Luo Xingnan's men were down to just Shangguan Lifeng. It was as if Yun Youzi had made it plain without saying so outright.</p><p>Aside from Luo Xingnan, the others were not entitled to more, even if they were greedy, and they all nodded in agreement.</p><p>Chapter 300: Bird-Headed Creatures</p><p>As they spoke, the group's vision suddenly darkened.  With shrill cries, the flock of bird-headed creatures swooped down towards Geyuan, clearly enraged by his theft of the spirit herbs.</p><p>Among them, one was slightly smaller but significantly faster than the others. Its feathers, like black iron, appeared incredibly hard.</p><p>With a beat of its wings, the creature turned into a black streak, appearing instantaneously above Geyuan's head with astonishing speed.  Its sharp talons, gleaming with a cold light, lashed out at Geyuan.</p><p>The aura erupting from this particular creature was terrifying, startling even Qin Sang. It was a late-stage Spirit Demon!</p><p>The other creatures were much weaker.  Only one was an early-stage Spirit Demon; the rest were lesser demons.</p><p>No wonder Luo Xingnan and the others hadn't gained the upper hand. Facing a late-stage Spirit Demon, simply surviving its attacks was a feat in itself.</p><p>Also, one person seemed to be missing.</p><p>Only Luo Xingnan, Yun Youzi, Shangguan Lifeng, and the scholar in white remained.</p><p>Elder Gong was gone!</p><p>Geyuan himself was the most terrified.</p><p>This creature was vastly more powerful, two whole realms above him.</p><p>Follow our official account: Book Friends Base Camp, follow to receive cash and points!</p><p>Even under normal circumstances, escaping from this creature would be difficult.  Now, after being struck by Luo Xingnan's jade fork, he was at his most vulnerable, his breath unsteady.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The creature spread its wings, demonic power whipping up a gale that pinned Geyuan to the ground, easily crushing any attempt to escape.</p><p>Terror seized Geyuan as the creature's talons closed in.</p><p>At this critical juncture, Yun Youzi reacted swiftly, throwing a yellow copper ring.</p><p>'Whoosh...Whoosh...'</p><p>The ring emitted a strong yellow light, then split into dozens of identical phantoms in mid-air, all striking the creature.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the creature staggered from the impact of the rings, roaring in fury.  The other bird-headed creatures, seemingly aware of the rings' power, shrieked and retreated.</p><p>Geyuan finally seized the opportunity, scrambling to his feet and fleeing without a backward glance.</p><p>Qin Sang watched closely, noticing that the formation of the remaining four hadn't broken. They all wielded identical yellow copper rings.</p><p>It was a set of restriction-based magical instruments!</p><p>Understanding dawned on Qin Sang.  This was how they had managed to hold their own against the late-stage Spirit Demon, relying on this set of magical instruments.</p><p>Otherwise, they would have likely met the same fate as Sheng Yuanzi.</p><p>"What are you doing?!"</p><p>Luo Xingnan glared at Yun Youzi, furious that he had intervened.</p><p>Yun Youzi remained calm. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the outer formation's weak phase is almost over. We don't have much time. One more person means more strength. Subduing this beast quickly and getting someone to harvest the herbs is our priority!"</p><p>At the same time, Yun Youzi's voice transmission reached Qin Sang's ear, revealing that Elder Gong was dead.</p><p>Like Geyuan, he had triggered a restriction while harvesting herbs and alerted the creatures.</p><p>Unfortunately, Elder Gong had been the first target, killed instantly with a claw through the skull before he could react.</p><p>The others, horrified, had quickly regrouped to defend against the creatures' onslaught. Yun Youzi had then deployed the Golden Ring Formation, a set of restriction-based magical instruments, to barely hold their ground.</p><p>Even with the Golden Ring Formation, killing the creatures was nearly impossible, and they didn't have time for a prolonged fight.</p><p>Their only option was to use the instruments to trap the creatures, get someone to collect the spirit herbs, and then escape!</p><p>Luo Xingnan grunted, accepting Yun Youzi's explanation. He manipulated the copper rings, creating countless phantoms to attack the creature.  He then swiped his hand across a ring, splitting it into two, and tossed one each to Qin Sang and Geyuan. "You two hold off these birds. I'll go harvest the herbs!" he commanded.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Yun Youzi stopped him. "Fellow Daoist Luo, the beasts are strong.  Without you, we may not be able to hold them back. To be safe, why not let Daoist Qingfeng harvest the herbs?  We can divide them evenly on the spot."</p><p>Luo Xingnan froze, suddenly realizing something was amiss.</p><p>His gaze shifted between Qin Sang, Geyuan, and Yun Youzi. His expression grew increasingly furious.  "Old man," he roared, "they're with you?!"</p><p>"Not exactly 'with me.' I simply know these two fellow Daoists," Yun Youzi replied calmly.</p><p>"Good! Very good!"</p><p>Luo Xingnan's fury turned to a chilling smile.  "The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. I'll admit defeat today!  Old man, you dare scheme against me? You've got guts!  Are you not afraid I'll kill you?!"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Luo, you exaggerate!"</p><p>Unfazed by Luo Xingnan's murderous glare, Yun Youzi looked at Shangguan Lifeng and the scholar in white. "We all ventured here for treasure.  Unlike Yu Kong, we bear no deep grudge against Fellow Daoist Luo. I never intended you any harm, so there's no scheme.  I observe seven surviving spirit herbs, protected by powerful restrictions that keep these beasts at bay. There are six of us; one herb each is more than enough, as per your previous offer. Why such anger when I suggest an even split?  Could it be... your offer was merely empty words?"</p><p>"You..."</p><p>Luo Xingnan's face stiffened, his eyes flashing with rage at being called out.</p><p>Not giving him a chance to speak, Yun Youzi addressed the scholar in white, bypassing Shangguan Lifeng. "Fellow Daoist, what are your thoughts?"</p><p>The scholar glanced at Luo Xingnan and Shangguan Lifeng, then hesitated under Luo Xingnan's intense gaze before saying, "I believe Daoist Yun Youzi's words are reasonable."</p><p>He then subtly moved closer to Yun Youzi.</p><p>However, Yun Youzi didn't want to push Luo Xingnan too far, lest he lose control.  He added, "Breaking the restrictions will take time. Daoist Qingfeng alone may struggle.  Perhaps Fellow Daoist Luo could assign another person to assist him.  Also, we owe our presence here to Fellow Daoist Luo's planning.  You taking two of the seven herbs is only right. What do you all think?"</p><p>With Elder Gong dead, Shangguan Lifeng was Luo Xingnan's only remaining ally. Yun Youzi's implication was clear.</p><p>Except for Luo Xingnan, no one else had the standing to object, even if they were greedy. They readily agreed.</p>
