<h1>Chapter 1650: First Battle</h1><p>Chapter 1650: First Battle</p><p>The hall had no windows.</p><p>The protective barrier of the Ruyi Jewel was the only light source, dispelling the darkness, casting shifting shadows within the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, surveying his surroundings.  He found himself alone, a strange occurrence.</p><p>He replayed the recent events in his mind.</p><p>He was certain the change wasn't caused by him. Something else must have shifted, but he didn't understand how he'd been transported here, or why he was the only one.</p><p>“What did Zhu Wu Dao do?”</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively thought of Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>This man knew the Unseen Immortal Sect best.  Given the timing, he wouldn't have waited for the Weeping Spirit Master and should already be on the mountain.</p><p>His gaze shifted.</p><p>The hall was quite spacious, devoid of furnishings, except for a two-tiered jade platform at the center, resembling some sort of altar.</p><p>However, the altar showed no signs of spiritual energy, appearing abandoned.</p><p>He was about to approach the altar to examine its purpose when he paused. The situation was unclear; rash action was unwise. He needed to determine his location and find a way out.</p><p>“No doors…”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. The entire hall lacked even a single door.  Runes flickered on the walls, indicating that breaking through would be impossible.</p><p>He looked up at the ceiling; no skylight.</p><p>A subtle tremor ran through the ground.  The outside of the hall seemed unsettled.</p><p>This further baffled him. The way out might lie with the altar.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed towards the altar, just as a bright light erupted. It didn’t originate from the altar itself, but from the other side of it.</p><p>The light filled the hall, then vanished as quickly as it appeared.</p><p>But the hall didn't fall into darkness, as new light clusters immediately ignited.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>In the blink of an eye, four light orbs appeared successively. When the light faded, four figures materialized, each radiating a powerful aura, comparable to Qin Sang's.</p><p>Upon seeing the four figures, Qin Sang’s expression froze, a silent groan escaping his lips.</p><p>Su Zi Nan, Mo Xing Dao, and Zhu Wu Dao teaming up was expected. But when did Fan Lao Mo arrive and join forces with them?</p><p>The newcomers were indeed Zhu Wu Dao and three others.</p><p>Qin Sang had a history with two of them, minor grudges.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, it wouldn't have escalated to a life-or-death struggle, but now they were outnumbered and trapped, a desperate situation ripe for treachery.</p><p>Even Qin Sang, not one to underestimate himself, didn't dare face four powerful cultivators alone.</p><p>“Where is Zi Lei Lao Dao?”</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, his eyes scanning frantically.</p><p>But after their appearance, no further lights appeared.</p><p>Were the three Daoist masters not on Di Shou Mountain?</p><p>At the same time, eight pairs of eyes fixed on Qin Sang. The four cultivators wore diverse expressions.</p><p>“The Fire Demon!”</p><p>Su Zi Nan blurted out, then rejoiced, declaring his good fortune.  Upon arriving, a great gift had been delivered.</p><p>If they killed the Fire Demon here, they would not only obtain the tribulation-crossing treasure, but also the third soul of the Demon Banner!</p><p>Seeing the hall was sealed, Su Zi Nan laughed, “Did you ever imagine this day would come?”</p><p>Qin Sang found this peculiar. He and Wu Lao had fought once to a standstill. Why did Su Zi Nan seem to harbor such intense hatred?</p><p>Either he blamed Qin Sang for the Moon Princess's death, or Su Zi Nan knew something about the Water Aspect Master's tomb!</p><p>Fan Lao Mo had been observing Qin Sang with an enigmatic smile. Hearing Su Zi Nan's laughter, he exclaimed, “Su Daoist also has a grudge against this villain?  Heaven has eyes.  Injustice will always lead to self-destruction. Hell has no door, yet he has come seeking it himself!”</p><p>Murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Dark light surged from his palm, nine Yin Demon Nails poised to strike.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo still remembered the previous battle outside the Immortal Gate where he suffered a setback, three of his nails instantly shattered – a memory fresh in his mind. Thus, this time he deployed nine.</p><p>Su Zi Nan had been secretly communicating, urging the others to attack.</p><p>He and Mo Xing Dao had a pact, but Zhu Wu Dao and Fan Lao Mo were more enigmatic.</p><p>Qin Sang's Ice Instrument Divine Disk was recognizable to some, but certainly not to Zhu Wu Dao, and Su Zi Nan didn't want to fight a major battle only to have the two demons reap the rewards.</p><p>Seeing that he'd persuaded Fan Lao Mo without much effort, Su Zi Nan rejoiced.  He noticed a slight smirk on Qin Sang's lips – no fear, just a cold smile.</p><p>The next moment, the hand Qin Sang placed on the altar’s edge turned black, Nine Netherworld Devilfire erupting unrestrainedly, slamming into the altar!</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Su Zi Nan's expression changed drastically. Black light blazed from his palm, transforming into a black ruler.  The ruler's shadow, devoid of any flourish, shattered the void, striking towards Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo's face darkened, and the nine Yin Demon Nails shot out.</p><p>But Qin Sang was too close to the altar.  Though their movements were swift, the devilfire was faster.</p><p>As soon as the four appeared, Qin Sang had already swept the altar with his spiritual sense.  The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect wouldn't have built this hall without escape routes; it had to be connected to the altar.</p><p>A sweep revealed the secret: the altar was the key to the hall's restrictions.  Furthermore, a powerful force was constantly assaulting the hall from outside, causing tremors and destabilizing the altar.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A torrent of demonic fire poured into the altar.</p><p>The runes on the altar flashed explosively.  Overwhelmed by the demonic fire, the restrictions immediately went haywire.</p><p>This was a double whammy.  Under attack from both inside and out, the entire hall vibrated violently. The five people inside felt a violent tremor beneath their feet, then saw the altar shatter into pieces, leaving behind a blinding white light.</p><p>Qin Sang, expecting this, quickly retreated.  Immediately afterward, he heard a tremendous crash behind him—a section of the stone wall had crashed onto the protective barrier of the Ruyi Treasure Pearl.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the hall was already collapsing. The ceiling was the first to be blown away, with clouds and mist pouring in, followed by the walls.</p><p>Finally, the hall's foundation was torn apart by the immense force, turning into a torrent of rubble that was swept into the depths of the mist.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh…*</p><p>The five people inside reacted swiftly, flying into the air before the hall completely collapsed, escaping injury.</p><p>The only effect was on the attacks launched by Su Zinan and Fan Laomo; they were disrupted by the altar's collapse, allowing Qin Sang to effortlessly evade them.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>A gale howled, clouds and mist churned.</p><p>The five stood on clouds, their bodies shimmering with various colored lights from their protective treasures, defending against the turbulent currents within the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang was still facing four opponents.</p><p>During the standoff, they silently observed their surroundings.</p><p>Above and below, mist was everywhere, limiting their vision.</p><p>Above, they could vaguely see the shadow of a divine mountain, towering and even grander than the mountain scenery they had seen before.  Upon seeing this, they understood: this was the true Emperor's Mandate Mountain!</p><p>They had made it inside, but were still within the array's range; the surging mist was caused by the array's disruption.</p><p>While it sounds complicated, with their cultivation levels, they understood the situation in an instant.</p><p>Su Zinan and the others didn't rush to climb the mountain; they kept their eyes fixed on Qin Sang.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and Qin Sang had no grievances between them.</p><p>After entering the hall, he had been wary of Daoist experts, gathering allies partly to avoid being cornered by the Daoists.</p><p>The Daoists had entered Emperor's Mandate Mountain earlier.</p><p>Surprisingly, even now, Zi Lei Zhenren had not appeared.</p><p>Zhu Wudao felt slightly relieved.  He glanced around, then looked at Qin Sang in surprise, curious about this person.  "I wonder what your name is, friend. Are you a descendant of the Fire Phase lineage? It's a pity you weren't willing to make friends in the teleportation hall. Otherwise, I might have been able to mediate and resolve the conflict between you all. As long as it's not a deep-seated feud, I believe Su Daoist and Brother Fan would give me some face…"</p><p>"What's the point of wasting words on him! Even without a grudge, it doesn't hurt to eliminate this person, one less competitor for the treasure!"</p><p>Fan Laomo, still smarting from the loss of nine Yin Demon Nails, blamed it all on Qin Sang.</p><p>Su Zinan remained silent, holding the black ruler before him.  A delicate net slipped from his sleeve into his hand.  Silently chanting incantations, the dragon tendon net spread out, tearing through the air.</p><p>The dragon tendon net could expand and contract at will; as small as nothingness, or large enough to seal off the heavens and earth!</p><p>Capturing the Yuan Ying of the Yan Shan Old Man was thanks to this net.</p><p>The net might not stop Qin Sang, but even a moment's delay would be enough.  Even if Zhu Wudao didn't take a side, they had three against one; Su Zinan was sure they could subdue Qin Sang!</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The dragon tendon net vanished, replaced by grid-like beams of light in the void.</p><p>The beams crisscrossed, about to close in.</p><p>A pair of exquisite phoenix wings materialized behind Qin Sang.  He aimed for the depths of the mist, merging man and sword, and vanished in a burst of lightning speed.</p><p>A thunderclap in the air.</p><p>"What incredible speed!"</p><p>Su Zinan and the others were shocked, watching as the lightning bolt pierced through a gap in the net.</p><p>Only after the lightning passed did a black lotus bloom in the gap, its demonic energy swirling, forming a cage—but it only trapped a wisp of cloud.</p><p>Fan Laomo's expression stiffened, then he raged.  His left palm flipped, the black lotus soared, its petals reversed, shooting endless black light.</p><p>Wherever the black light went, black lotuses bloomed one after another.</p><p>In an instant, thousands of lotuses filled the mist-shrouded sea, undulating among the clouds and fog, resembling a lotus pond.</p><p>Qin Sang's escaping light fell into the lotus pond.  An intensely cold aura permeated the surroundings, black lotuses surrounding him from all sides; no matter how he moved, he couldn't escape.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Black lotuses surged madly, sharp as blades.  If caught, Qin Sang would be instantly reduced to pulp.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, protected by a protective barrier and wielding demonic flames, stood firm, annihilating countless black lotuses.</p><p>But Fan Laomo's goal was only to delay Qin Sang, forcing him to divide his attention. Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao moved in from either side, flanking him.</p><p>Just then, a fierce shout echoed from the depths of the cloud sea:  "Myriad Illusory Shadow Lotuses!"</p><p>The shout itself carried a chilling intent.</p><p>Hearing it, people like Zhu Wu Dao's faces turned pale.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a thunderclap, even more terrifying than a lightning strike, boomed from the cloud sea. Five thunder pythons burst into view, charging into the lotus pond.  They worked in concert with Qin Sang's demonic flames, clearing the path ahead.</p><p>Behind the thunder pythons, two figures descended on clouds – the two True Immortals of the Eight Scenic Views.</p><p>"The two True Immortals have finally arrived!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded from afar.</p><p>Having escaped the ruined hall, he no longer worried about his situation.  His Heavenly Eye divine ability pierced the mist, revealing the presence of True Immortal Zi Lei and True Immortal He Gao. They must have arrived earlier, having already broken through the Jade Pavilion space and entered the mountain before the upheaval, thus avoiding being transported to the main hall.</p><p>As for why only the two True Immortals of the Eight Scenic Views were present, and not Yue Lingtian, Qin Sang was unsure. But with these two here, Zhu Wu Dao's faction would certainly not dare target him anymore.</p><p>In the teleportation hall, he had attacked them. Now, he relied on them for his escape.  Times change.</p><p>"It's you."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, True Immortal He Gao looked displeased. Qin Sang had attacked them; he didn't have a good impression of him.</p><p>"The incident in the teleportation hall was a misunderstanding. I apologize to both Daoist friends.  These Wuxiang Sect villains deliberately sabotaged the formation; their intentions are nefarious and must be investigated!"</p><p>Qin Sang shifted the blame to Zhu Wu Dao, his figure flashing as he landed near the two True Immortals.</p><p>Behind him, Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao were in hot pursuit. Seeing this, they hesitated, uncertain what to do.</p><p>True Immortal Zi Lei's gaze shifted to Fan Laomo. "Daoist Fan, are you also colluding with the remnants of the Wuxiang Sect?"</p><p>Fan Laomo chuckled, putting away the Myriad Illusory Shadow Lotuses. He instead turned the tables, accusing, "Old geezer, I hear they could open the Wuxiang Sect because you deliberately allowed it?"</p><p>The anger on his face had vanished; his eyes no longer focused on Qin Sang.</p><p>"After we leave, I will give you an explanation," True Immortal Zi Lei said calmly.</p><p>"No, no, no…"</p><p>Fan Laomo shook his head repeatedly. "I don't want any explanations. You just need to tell me what happened in the Immortal Palace!"</p><p>True Immortal Zi Lei frowned, knowing he couldn't hide it any longer. He sighed inwardly, saying, "If I knew the details, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths. Once this is settled, I will join forces with the Ganlu Zen Temple to open the Immortal Palace, and we will invite your sect and various schools from Central Plains to witness it."</p><p>Seeing that they were about to reach an agreement with a few words, Zhu Wu Dao felt a sense of foreboding; his gaze grew darker.</p><p>He glanced at Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao. Since the Daoist sect appeared, these two had remained aloof, seemingly uninvolved.</p><p>Earlier, Mo Xingdao had forced him to reveal the wordless jade tablet, and now he had used his Golden Phase Order to enter. He was no longer of use, and their true intentions were clear.</p><p>The only good news was that Yue Lingtian wasn't there.</p><p>Seeing True Immortal Zi Lei's openness, Fan Laomo found it hard to press further. He subconsciously glanced at Zhu Wu Dao, hesitant.</p><p>At that moment, Zhu Wu Dao's voice, like a whisper, reached his ears.</p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Fan Laomo's eyes. He declared righteously, "Junior Brother Zhu openly violated sect regulations, colluding with the remnants of the Wuxiang Sect – a grave transgression! I will personally bring him back to the sect to receive disciplinary action…"</p><p>Before he finished, True Immortal Zi Lei's figure blurred.</p><p>Fan Laomo cried inwardly, just as a thunderous roar erupted beside him. Where Zhu Wu Dao stood, lightning shot into the sky, his figure obscured. Then, a clear crane's cry rang out – a crane soared into the heavens!</p><p>The two True Immortals of the Eight Scenic Views, in perfect unison, seeing that they couldn't persuade Fan Laomo, immediately took action!</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang bowed to them from afar, his phoenix wings flapping rapidly as he fled towards the mountain without looking back.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao exchanged glances, ignoring Zhu Wu Dao behind them, and pursued swiftly, "Where do you think you're going!"</p><p>Leaving Fan Laomo alone to curse his misfortune.</p><p>…</p><p>Below the cloud sea.</p><p>Two figures were hidden in a corner, sensing the battle of powerful cultivators above, not daring to move.</p><p>"So many powerful cultivators."</p><p>A female cultivator sensed the energy in the clouds, sticking out her tongue in surprise, grateful for her senior brother's decision.</p><p>A man in white robes stared fixedly upward, sensing three auras fleeing, while the rest were in chaos. "Let's go!"</p><p>The two suppressed their auras, carefully passing through the area.</p>
