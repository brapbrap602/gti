<h1>Chapter 369 Hunting Ghosts</h1><p>The roars and howls of monsters echoed around them.  The group walked silently through the valley, occasionally glancing up at the mountain, where ghostly shadows flickered amidst the howling wind.  They suppressed the fluctuations of their protective talismans with all their might, unable to use transportation spells, and forced to proceed on foot.</p><p>A river of blood flowed from the mountain's heart, its waters tainted by a bloody miasma, turning them crimson red.</p><p>The river undoubtedly contained toxins even more potent than the miasma.  The group walked along the riverbank, carefully treading on the uneven stones, afraid of disturbing any ghosts, their journey arduous and cautious.</p><p>“There's a hidden passage inside the mountain leading to an exit opposite the ghost nest. There are stray ghosts in the passage, mostly solitary and weak.  If we encounter any, we'll strike together swiftly, denying them the chance to summon their companions.”</p><p>Kong Xin stood before the entrance to the mountain's heart, observing for a moment.  After conveying this warning to the group via voice transmission, he waved his hand and entered first.</p><p>The others quickly followed.</p><p>Inside the mountain, the bloody miasma was only slightly thinner. Fortunately, they were not ordinary people, and could still discern the path ahead with their eyesight.</p><p>The deeper they went, the narrower the passage became. The jagged stone walls on either side left almost no room to place their feet. Without Kong Xin's command, they dared not use movement techniques to hasten their progress, making their journey even more difficult.</p><p>Just as they were growing impatient, a fork appeared in the path ahead.</p><p>“This way!”</p><p>Kong Xin seemed very familiar with this place and changed direction without hesitation.</p><p>The group filed in and, seeing the environment ahead, breathed a sigh of relief. This forked path had no underground river. Although it was winding and uneven, it was much easier to traverse than the previous path.</p><p>Kong Xin led the way, the master and disciple walked in the middle, and Qin Sang and Yun Youzi brought up the rear.</p><p>This was their own initiative.  First, they were the most coordinated team, and second, if danger arose ahead, they would have room to react.</p><p>At first, fearing a ghostly ambush, they proceeded slowly and cautiously.</p><p>However, as time passed, according to Kong Xin, they were almost halfway through the passage, but they had only encountered a few weak ghost soldiers, easily dispatched.</p><p>Gradually, their courage grew, and they increased their pace.</p><p>Kong Xin transmitted, “We’re approaching the deepest part of the mountain’s heart, where there’s a cavern. It’s vast; at least, I haven’t explored its full extent.  It likely houses numerous ghosts.  Fortunately, we only need to skirt its edge to reach another passage leading out.”</p><p>Before Kong Xin could finish, the path ahead vanished abruptly. Upon closer inspection, they realized the passage ended at a short cliff.</p><p>The bottom of the cliff was shrouded in bloody miasma, its depths invisible, confirming Kong Xin's description of a cavern.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>Kong Xin stepped on protruding stones along the cliff face and descended gracefully.  The others followed suit.</p><p>Soon, they reached the bottom, confirmed the area was clear, and proceeded along the cliff wall.</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>Sun Xin suddenly stopped, letting out a low shout. Holding Chi Dan with one hand, he pointed with the other, sending a nine-story pagoda-shaped talisman flying towards the front like a streak of light.</p><p>The bloody miasma churned, and the palm-sized pagoda grew to the height of a man, hovering steadily in mid-air. A clear light emanated from it, trapping a vicious-looking, double-horned ghost below.</p><p>Despite being suppressed, the ghost struggled violently and roared furiously. Fortunately, the pagoda muffled its cries, preventing it from alerting more ghosts.</p><p>Even Kong Xin's talisman couldn't easily subdue it.  This ghost's strength was only slightly weaker than a Foundation Establishment cultivator, making it the strongest opponent they had encountered since entering the Boundless Valley.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A speck of white light flashed.</p><p>It was a needle-like talisman, as thin as a cow hair.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this seemingly insignificant talisman pierced the ghost's body, working in concert with Kong Xin's nine-story pagoda to kill it. The light then returned to the red-clad woman's palm.</p><p>Upon death, the ghost transformed into a wisp of bloody air and merged with the miasma.</p><p>Kong Xin retrieved his pagoda and bowed slightly to the red-clad woman. “Thank you, fellow Daoist, for your timely assistance.”</p><p>The red-clad woman said dismissively, “I merely saved us some time. Fellow Daoist Kong could have handled it easily.  The presence of such a strong ghost suggests this passage isn't as safe as you claimed.  We should press on, lest we encounter further surprises.”</p><p>A sarcastic expression flickered across her face, clearly displeased with Kong Xin's earlier omission.</p><p>Kong Xin, unfazed, replied, “Rest assured, fellow Daoist. The strongest ghost I've encountered on previous trips was no stronger than this. There won't be…”</p><p>As if to contradict him, Yun Youzi, who had been at the rear, suddenly changed expression. He turned sharply, staring behind them and shouted, “More!”</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, trusting Yun Youzi’s warning. Without hesitation, he swung his right palm, releasing a burst of golden light that shot into the bloody miasma.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The Soul Binding Rope tightly bound another ghost.</p><p>This ghost was similar in strength to the previous one.  Because Qin Sang was concealing his cultivation and hadn't used his full power, the Soul Binding Rope couldn't completely suppress it.</p><p>Fortunately, Yun Youzi also acted, his flying sword slaying the ghost.</p><p>Qin Sang, without even glancing at the slain ghost, launched another attack. A black light, a square black stone, flew from his palm, smashing into the other side with thunderous force.</p><p>Only after the Black Dragon Stone struck did the others notice a wisp of bloody air emerge from beneath it, merging with the miasma.</p><p>That ghost had been crushed before it could even fully materialize.</p><p>Upon entering the Boundless Valley, Qin Sang had already prepared Liang Yan's Black Dragon Stone and Soul Binding Rope.</p><p>The valley's demons and ghosts were resistant to poison, rendering the Poisonous Sky Gauze less effective, and the Yin-Yang Compass lacked offensive power.  In contrast, Liang Yan's two talismans proved quite handy.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang produce two high-grade talismans of considerable power, the others looked at him with a newfound wariness and apprehension.</p><p>Just then, ripples appeared in the depths of the bloody miasma, and several shadowy figures rushed towards them.</p><p>More ghosts had been alerted by the fighting.</p><p>There were over a dozen of them, varying in strength.  Fortunately, the strongest were no more powerful than the previous three, remaining within the group's capabilities.</p><p>They each employed their techniques, slaying the ghosts one after another, but remained vigilant. This place was not safe to linger in; otherwise, a chain reaction could occur, attracting even more ghosts.</p><p>Sun Xin quickly increased his pace, and the others followed, fighting and retreating until they finally saw a narrow opening in the cliff wall ahead.</p>
