<h1>Chapter 1939: The Storyteller</h1><p>Winter gave way to spring.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the new year was upon them.</p><p>This year was destined to be a prosperous one.</p><p>In just a few short months, Qin Sang's reputation had spread far and wide.</p><p>The three villages at the foot of the mountain, in particular, had truly benefited from his grace.</p><p>Whether suffering from major or minor ailments, all who sought help at the Daoist temple found their illnesses cured by his remedies.</p><p>Qin Sang's ledger was already half-filled with entries, yet he never pressed for payment. Even with the new year approaching, no Daoist from Green Ram Temple was seen descending the mountain to collect debts.</p><p>Some impoverished families, still owing for their first consultation, found themselves needing his help again. They entered the temple with trepidation, only to find Qin Sang making no mention of their debt.</p><p>Everyone witnessed this, proclaiming that a true Immortal had graced the mountain.  Even the incense offerings flourished as a result.</p><p>Those who butchered their livestock for the new year would set aside the choicest cuts to offer to the temple.</p><p>Qin Sang declined incense offerings, so they insisted it was nourishment for the two young Daoist disciples.  They always left their gifts, reasoning that Daoists weren't vegetarian.</p><p>Unable to refuse their heartfelt generosity, especially during the festive season, Qin Sang made an exception.</p><p>In a matter of days, half a room was filled with various New Year's goods, rustic in preparation, but delicious nonetheless.</p><p>Nothing went to waste.  The master and his two disciples, living in the mortal realm, partook in the daily rhythms of mortal life, savoring the flavors of the human world, three meals a day.</p><p>The twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month.</p><p>New Year's Eve was almost here.</p><p>Yu Lang, invigorated after a night of cultivation, cracked open a window. A gust of icy wind, swirling with snowflakes, drifted inside.</p><p>At some point during the night, a heavy snowfall had begun.</p><p>"Auspicious snow heralds a bountiful year."</p><p>Yu Lang pushed the window wide open, forgoing any spells, letting the snowflakes fall upon him, a picture of contentment.</p><p>The village school was closed for the New Year holidays, granting leave until the eighth day of the first lunar month, and he had completed his studies early.</p><p>Before enrolling, he yearned for the opportunity to study, but once in the school, he discovered the true pleasure of holiday breaks.</p><p>"I wonder if Senior Sister is awake yet?"</p><p>Yu Lang leaned out the window, glancing towards the adjacent room.</p><p>During the past six months at school, his Senior Sister remained quiet, but noticeably less taciturn than before.</p><p>He had recently learned that she didn't meditate at night, but slept like an ordinary person.</p><p>"Just how did Senior Sister attain her cultivation?"</p><p>Yu Lang pondered, unable to comprehend.</p><p>"With this weather, the mountain must be snowed in.  No one should be coming up. I wonder if Master will still emerge from seclusion.  Senior Luo Hou is still sleeping, and Senior Tai Yi's whereabouts are unknown.  Senior Vermilion Bird, too, stays nestled in its nest all day. I haven't seen it in a while.  Is it bored on the mountain? Master strictly forbade it from playing pranks..."</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, Yu Lang noticed the snow gradually lessening. By daybreak, it had stopped completely.</p><p>The Daoist temple was blanketed in white, a pristine layer of soft snow, flawless and unbroken. Even the courtyard walls wore a crown of white.</p><p>"Huh!"</p><p>Yu Lang pushed open the door, his breath forming a white cloud.  Just as he picked up a broom from beside the wall, he heard the creak of the neighboring door and saw Xiao Wu emerge.</p><p>"Senior Sister."</p><p>Yu Lang called out.</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded, picking up a broom of her own.</p><p>"Senior Sister, let's sweep all the way down to the foot of the mountain. Qiu Hua and the others said they wanted to come up and play with you. With all this snow, I wonder if they'll still come."</p><p>The Qiu Hua Yu Lang spoke of was his classmate.</p><p>The few girls in the school often played together, led by Qiu Hua, who had a spirited personality and could out-argue any boy.</p><p>Including Qiu Hua, all the girls were fond of Xiao Wu, believing her silence stemmed from a gentle nature, and they were determined to protect her from any bullying by the boys.</p><p>Thinking of this, Yu Lang scratched his head, uncertain of his Senior Sister's true feelings towards these playmates.</p><p>They first cleared paths within the temple grounds, opened the temple gates, and then continued sweeping along the mountain path downwards.</p><p>Before reaching the foot of the mountain, they encountered three figures approaching.</p><p>It was Scholar Chen, accompanied by his book boy, trudging through the snow.  With them was their classmate, Tao Teng, who shared a kindred spirit with Yu Lang.  Within days of their meeting, Yu Lang had given him the nickname 'Nao Teng' (Restless).</p><p>"Yu Lang! Senior~ Sister...hee hee."</p><p>Tao Teng deliberately drew out his words, winking mischievously.</p><p>Yu Lang, despite appearing several years older than Xiao Wu, still addressed her as Senior Sister, a fact that often amused his friends.</p><p>"Greetings, Teacher."</p><p>Yu Lang glared at Tao Teng, then set down his broom with Xiao Wu and bowed respectfully.</p><p>"I came today specifically to test your studies."</p><p>Scholar Chen started with a jest.  Seeing no trace of apprehension on his students' faces, he inwardly marveled at the fine disciples Master Qing Feng had taken in.</p><p>Yu Lang had a foundation, having studied previously.</p><p>Xiao Wu, however, was only seven or eight years old, yet possessed a remarkable memory. Within days of enrolling, she had memorized several classic texts flawlessly, along with the teacher's interpretations.</p><p>For this reason, Scholar Chen had specifically consulted with Qin Sang, concluding that their minds were not yet mature enough and they should remain in elementary studies.</p><p>"A pity she's a girl."</p><p>Scholar Chen sighed inwardly. While Yan Country's customs were relatively open, there was no precedent for women holding official positions.</p><p>Yu Lang, though a spirited young man who often displayed ambition, seemed strangely unaffected by the pursuit of fame and fortune, influenced by his master's teachings.  He appeared to study solely for the purpose of understanding Daoist scriptures.</p><p>"If I had encountered such a master in my youth, perhaps I would be like Yu Lang as well?"</p><p>Scholar Chen, reflecting on Master Qing Feng's demeanor and conduct, entertained this thought.  He gestured towards the food box carried by his book boy. "The mountains draped in snow, a breathtaking sight.  Such a scene demands the company of friends.  I specifically asked your teacher's wife to prepare some hometown delicacies. Has the Daoist Master finished his morning rituals?"</p><p>He lived in seclusion in Qi Pai Village, nestled amidst mountains and rivers, yet there was no one in the village he could truly converse with.  His close friends resided elsewhere.</p><p>Finally, he had met Master Qing Feng, a kindred spirit, but this man was even busier than himself.</p><p>"Master..."</p><p>Yu Lang hesitated slightly, looking towards his Senior Sister.</p><p>Xiao Wu nodded gently. "Master has emerged from seclusion."</p><p>The two quickly finished sweeping the remaining snow.  As expected, no one else was at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Returning to the Daoist temple, they found their Master and Scholar Chen had already set up a table and charcoal brazier in the small loft.</p><p>The loft had been suggested and constructed by Scholar Chen.  Supported by wooden pillars below, a ladder led to the second floor.</p><p>The second floor rose above the courtyard walls, offering a superb view of the surrounding mountains.</p><p>"Yu Lang, the beef sent by the Zhang family, skewer it and bring it to grill.  And those fruits I gathered in the mountains, wash them and bring them up," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>"Fruits? Oh, alright."</p><p>Yu Lang understood, called out to Tao Teng, and hurried to the room where the food was stored.  Sure enough, there was a cluster of bright red spiritual fruits.</p><p>"There are still fruits in the mountains at this time of year? What kind are they?" Scholar Chen inquired.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is unsure, but rest assured, Scholar Chen, these fruits are non-toxic and possess a unique fragrance."</p><p>Scholar Chen chuckled. "Of that, I have no doubt.  At the Daoist Master's abode, one can always find novel delicacies.  I truly wonder how you concoct those seasonings, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. In comparison, the food I brought seems quite pedestrian."</p><p>The seasonings were crafted from spiritual herbs, how could they not be fragrant?</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself. He rarely indulged in culinary pleasures, but wishing for Xiao Wu to experience the five flavors of the human world, he had spared no effort.</p><p>He picked up his chopsticks, placed a piece of golden-yellow pastry into his mouth, and chewed slowly.</p><p>It wasn't as exaggerated as Scholar Chen made it out to be.</p><p>"Madam Chen's culinary skills are exceptional, truly unique."</p><p>As Qin Sang spoke, his gaze drifted towards the area outside the temple.</p><p>Several figures were approaching along the mountain path, led by two elderly men, one of whom was Physician Liu.</p><p>"Oh?  More visitors today?" Scholar Chen peered out, observing.</p><p>"Perhaps an urgent medical matter," Qin Sang glanced at the elderly man beside Physician Liu, then rose. "Excuse me for a moment."</p><p>"Wait outside!"</p><p>Physician Liu waved, stopping those behind him at the temple entrance, bringing only the elderly man inside.</p><p>"Daoist Master..."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, preventing them from bowing, and led them into the main hall.</p><p>The elderly man, dressed in fine silk robes, appeared to be a person of status. His face was flushed, but with an unhealthy redness.</p><p>Physician Liu, slightly uneasy about disturbing them during the New Year's period, quickly explained the elderly man's condition.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "This ailment is not suited for medicinal herbs. Bring acupuncture needles."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Physician Liu, familiar with the procedure, retrieved the silver needles from his medical kit, his face full of anticipation.</p><p>He had witnessed Qin Sang's acupuncture before, an art he could only describe as miraculous.</p><p>"Observe carefully!"</p><p>Qin Sang reminded him, instructing the elderly man to lie on the straw mat. He deliberately slowed his movements, allowing Physician Liu to clearly see the subtle vibrations of each needle.</p><p>In less than the time it took to brew tea, Qin Sang withdrew the needles and stepped back.  The unhealthy flush on the elderly man's face gradually receded.</p><p>"Miraculous! Truly miraculous!"</p><p>Physician Liu, having observed every detail, was deeply awed.  Suddenly, his expression darkened. "I'm too old... I couldn't replicate that! Such a pity to have only encountered the Daoist Master now!"</p><p>"If you cannot use it, you can pass it on to your disciples," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>The others who had accompanied the elderly man were his attendants, their carriage waiting at the foot of the mountain.  As Physician Liu prepared to depart with them, Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>"You've arrived at an opportune moment.  We are lacking company today.  It won't hurt to stay overnight at the temple.  Your family can fetch you tomorrow."</p><p>Physician Liu was overjoyed and readily agreed, sending a message home with one of the attendants.  He then followed Qin Sang up to the loft.</p><p>"So Scholar Chen is here as well," Physician Liu greeted him with a slight bow.  The two were acquainted, formalities unnecessary.</p><p>"Come! Come quickly!  Sample the Daoist Master's treasures.  I guarantee they are unparalleled delicacies, rarely found in this world! If the Daoist Master doesn't return soon, I fear I won't be able to resist partaking!"</p><p>Scholar Chen, impatient, held a handful of skewers, grilling them over the charcoal until they sizzled, releasing fragrant oils. He sprinkled on a pinch of spices, the rich aroma exploding outwards, blending seamlessly with the scent of roasting meat.</p><p>Physician Liu inhaled deeply, unable to contain his admiration.  "How fragrant!"</p><p>The book boy and Yu Lang, attending to them, were already swallowing their saliva.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang chuckled softly. "What a lively day it is."</p><p>Everyone turned to look outside the temple. The elderly man and his attendants had disappeared from the mountain path, replaced by two men.</p><p>One was young and handsome, the other slightly older.</p><p>The older man walked half a step behind, yet their demeanor wasn't that of master and servant. Both were dressed in white, exuding an air of refinement.</p><p>"What distinguished bearing!"</p><p>Scholar Chen's eyes lit up, unable to help but express his admiration. "Such individuals, I have never encountered before!  A great pity! A great pity! Are they friends of the Daoist Master?"</p><p>"This is our first meeting, though I have heard of these two gentlemen before. They should be Mr. Yu and Mr. Yi."</p><p>Qin Sang stated.</p><p>Seeming to sense their observation, the younger man looked up and smiled, raising a ceramic jar. "With spiritual fruits and fine cuisine, how can we be without exquisite wine? I have brought a jar of century-old wine. May we exchange it for two places upstairs?"</p><p>"You are too kind, Mr. Yu. It is said, 'Is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters?' Please, join us upstairs!"</p><p>Qin Sang stood by the window, instructing Yu Lang and Xiao Wu to welcome the guests.</p><p>The newcomers were the City God and the Registrar of the county.  Qin Sang had learned their names from the Earth God earlier and had guessed their identities upon seeing them.</p><p>The loft was not large.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, City God Yu and Registrar Yi took their seats.  With the addition of the four youngsters attending to them, the space felt slightly crowded. Fortunately, no one else ascended the mountain.</p><p>The exquisite wine was opened, its fragrance filling the air.</p><p>Each person took a cup, drinking together, the initial strangeness between them quickly dissipating.</p><p>Only Registrar Yi occasionally glanced at the table, his pupils constricting slightly, subtly gesturing for the City God to notice the plate of seasonings.</p><p>The cluster of fruits was called Jade Pill Fruit, capable of enhancing the cultivation of Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Offering them to mortals was already an extravagant gesture.</p><p>Yet, the seasoning powder contained spiritual herbs of even higher quality than the Jade Pill Fruit, along with other powders they couldn't identify.</p><p>The two exchanged a discreet glance, quite astonished, their regard for Master Qing Feng increasing.</p><p>Scholar Chen was more interested in them. "May I inquire as to where you gentlemen reside?  You are not from Jin County, are you?  Otherwise, I would surely recognize you."</p><p>Mr. Yu smiled. "We are indeed from Jin County, but we do not often appear in public. It's natural that Scholar Chen wouldn't recognize us."</p><p>"Two more recluses!"</p><p>Scholar Chen gave a self-deprecating smile, taking a sip of wine. "With such refined character...compared to you two, my so-called seclusion seems like a mere pretense for fame."</p><p>"Our talents are limited to a single county, a single city.  Scholar Chen, however, possesses the talent to govern a nation and pacify the people, the bearing of a duke or marquis.  How can we compare?"  City God Yu raised his cup in response.</p><p>"If you gentlemen insist, then I can only be considered a man of the wilderness," Qin Sang joined in, raising his cup.</p><p>"You are all immortal figures, while I am but a common man," Physician Liu chimed in, raising his cup playfully.</p><p>Registrar Yi glanced at him, taking a small sip of wine, his words carrying a deeper meaning.  "If you learn even a fraction of Master Qing Feng's benevolent heart, and not merely his medical skills, it will be enough to benefit you for a lifetime."</p><p>Physician Liu was momentarily taken aback.</p><p>Scholar Chen, seemingly intoxicated, his eyes glazed over, murmured,  "Mr. Yu's words might have been spoken in jest, but for scholars like myself, if we cannot serve our nation and bring peace to the common people, to whom shall we offer our knowledge and learning?"</p><p>Qin Sang rotated his wine cup in his hand, suddenly pausing, a slight furrow appearing between his brows.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, in Jin County city.</p><p>A streak of azure light landed in a secluded corner of the city. Moments later, a young, beautiful girl emerged.</p><p>A翠鸟 circled a few times before landing on her shoulder, its eyes bright and full of spiritual energy.</p><p>"So lively!"</p><p>The city was overflowing with the festive atmosphere of the New Year, the streets around the City God Temple bustling with people.</p><p>The girl, fascinated by everything, exclaimed, "The mortal world is wonderful, so much livelier than the mountain! Don't you think so, Xiao Zhu?"</p><p>The kingfisher fluttered its wings, chirping twice.</p><p>"So many delicious things too!"</p><p>The girl looked left and right, her mouth watering, stopping in front of a teahouse.</p><p>A resonant voice drifted from within.</p><p>Listening for a moment, the girl wondered aloud, "Is this what they call a storyteller in the books?  Isn't it almost New Year's? Why is someone still telling stories?"</p><p>The girl didn't realize that her presence had drawn the attention of everyone on the street.</p><p>"Do people stop eating during the New Year? That gentleman inside, though young, is a skilled storyteller," a nearby matron couldn't resist interjecting.</p><p>"Let's go inside and listen," the girl stepped across the threshold.
