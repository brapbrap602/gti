<h1>Chapter 1203: The Demon King Appears </h1><p>The tremors grew increasingly frequent.</p><p>Each one more violent than the last.</p><p>"The strongest tremor is about to come!" </p><p>The high-crowned Daoist spoke in a deep voice, his true essence surging wildly from his palm as he activated the spirit formation. The white-haired elder followed suit with a similar action.</p><p>The other cultivators assisted the two patriarchs, not daring to relax in the slightest.</p><p>The light barrier above the void suddenly brightened, appearing incredibly dense and heavy.</p><p>In the next moment—</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>It felt as though a heavy hammer had struck the minds of everyone present!</p><p>An invisible wave abruptly surged from within the void, rushing out of the darkness and slamming fiercely into the light barrier.</p><p>The light barrier dimmed momentarily.</p><p>The immense shockwave spread outward, causing the entire Heavenly Scar to tremble. The cultivators swayed with the force but held their ground, continuing to channel the spirit formation.</p><p>The tremor came quickly and vanished just as fast.</p><p>The light barrier remained intact, brightening once more in an instant.</p><p>But the tremors were far from over. A second wave of impact followed closely, then a third, a fourth...</p><p>Soon, they came in rapid succession, leaving no time for anyone to catch their breath. It was as if an incredibly violent force was raging within the Abyssal Ruins, trying to break free from the void.</p><p>Under the combined efforts of the cultivators, the light barrier formed by the spirit formation firmly sealed the void, blocking the waves below.</p><p>However, the effects of the tremors still spread outward. The space seemed to show signs of instability, and the spiritual energy became chaotic, forming a storm comparable to a small spiritual tide that battered the surroundings.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>No one knew when the tremors would end.</p><p>Just then, to the north of the Abyssal Ruins' entrance, within a narrow stone crevice, three figures silently appeared, descending slowly from above.</p><p>The storm caused by the tremors reached this area, the chaotic spiritual energy howling in disarray.</p><p>Around these three figures, a wisp of azure energy swirled. When the storm rushed toward them, the azure energy gently swayed, causing the storm to slide past them on either side, unable to touch them.</p><p>The source of the azure energy was a small, square azure banner held before one of the figures.</p><p>This person wore white robes, his appearance dignified and exceptionally handsome.</p><p>The small azure banner danced before him, one side painted with clusters of azure clouds, while the other side constantly shifted, its pattern impossible to discern.</p><p>"Thanks to Fellow Daoist Lu's Banner of Ten Thousand Miles of Azure Clouds, otherwise it would have taken us quite some effort to silently block the spiritual tide and infiltrate this place..."</p><p>A voice transmitted a compliment to the white-robed man holding the banner—apparently, his surname was Lu.</p><p>The speaker had a peculiar appearance, half-human and half-snake—it was none other than the Snake King!</p><p>On the other side of Lu stood a slender young man with pure ice-blue eyes, his gaze chillingly cold. His ears resembled fan-shaped membranes, clearly not human.</p><p>This young man was a transformed great demon, a Frost Lizard who had attained the Dao, his Dharma name also Frost Lizard.</p><p>However, Lu was human, his aura no less formidable than the Snake King's.</p><p>The three had come here together to explore the ancient demon's cave. They hadn't just arrived; they had been waiting nearby for nearly a month, precisely for the tremors of the Abyssal Ruins to occur.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Snake King, there's no need for modesty. I don't believe you lack such means," Lu chuckled, his gaze shifting to the depths of the crevice. "Without Fellow Daoist Frost Lizard's guidance, I wouldn't have noticed any ancient restrictions here. No wonder the cultivators of the Sin Abyss pass by here daily without discovering anything. The tremors of the Sin God Palace are most intense during the initial waves, which can mask the fluctuations of our restriction-breaking. Once those waves pass and they regain their senses, it won't be easy to deceive them. If we alert those two old fellows and they activate the grand formation against us, we'll have no choice but to flee. If we fail this time, we'll have to wait for the next tremor half a year later. If the Sin Abyss withdraws its forces during that time and all those Nascent Soul old ghosts return, we'll have to wait until the Sin God Palace emerges before we get another chance."</p><p>The ancient demon's cave they sought to explore was actually near the Abyssal Ruins, which explained their caution.</p><p>"If it comes to that, this king will definitely head to the Purple Subtlety Palace," the Snake King shook his head. It was obvious which was more important between the Purple Subtlety Palace and this place. He sighed softly, "It's a pity Fellow Daoist Brightmoon isn't willing to take the risk. With his Heavenly Eye Butterfly, breaking the ancient restrictions would be foolproof."</p><p>Frost Lizard sneered, "Isn't there a human saying that each to their own? If he doesn't care for the treasures of an ancient demon, can we force him? The restriction-breaking methods we've carefully gathered are no worse than the Heavenly Eye Butterfly."</p><p>As he spoke, Frost Lizard's figure flashed, darting into the crevice. In his hand, he held a piece of beast hide from some unknown spiritual beast, which he gently waved toward the stone wall.</p><p>Immediately, a massive ancient vine shadow appeared on the stone wall, its top extending from within the wall, thick as a dragon's body, coiling and hanging down.</p><p>The shadow of the ancient vine was both real and illusory, flickering on the verge of shattering.</p><p>The Snake King's expression turned grave, "Are you certain the demon's cave is hidden within the Abyssal Ruins?"</p><p>"Almost certainly. Where else could this ancient vine grow from if not the Abyssal Ruins?" Frost Lizard nodded. "It's said that ever since the Sin God Palace and the Purple Subtlety Palace began emerging prematurely, some of the previously unbreakable restrictions and seals within the Abyssal Ruins have either shattered under the tremors or weakened and loosened. The Sin Abyss has reaped quite a few benefits. I'm worried that if we wait any longer, the Sin Abyss will discover this cave."</p><p>"If we can connect to the Abyssal Ruins and control this passage in the future, we can also share in the spoils. But it's too early to speak of that now. If we alert the depths of the Abyssal Ruins, it'll be a major trouble. Be careful, both of you."</p><p>As he spoke, Lu flicked his sleeve, summoning eighty-one golden needles, each three inches long—a set of treasures specifically designed for breaking restrictions.</p><p>Frost Lizard opened his mouth and spat out a blue pearl. Inside the pearl, snowflakes drifted, forming a world of blizzards. Amidst the chaos, these snowflakes gradually condensed into a vine shadow identical to the one on the stone wall, mimicking the ancient vine restriction and seeking a way to break it.</p><p>The Snake King's actions were the most unusual.</p><p>He first took out several bottles of differently colored spiritual liquids, guiding them with his hand. The liquids merged, forming a multicolored pearl in mid-air, which he then pressed into his forehead.</p><p>The flesh of his forehead split, and the pearl embedded itself, as if opening a heavenly eye.</p><p>The three each displayed their unique abilities, all using secret techniques and treasures for breaking restrictions. Then, their figures flashed as they landed on a leaf of the ancient vine.</p><p>The vine shadow shattered, and the three figures dissolved like water.</p><p>Afterward, occasional inexplicable fluctuations emanated from the space, but they were masked by the tremors of the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>...</p><p>At the main hall of the Corpse Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang was seated cross-legged, deeply immersed in comprehending the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.</p><p>Suddenly, without any warning, a wave surged up.</p><p>The protective divine light around Qin Sang flickered as he was flung into the air, his face filled with astonishment as he looked at the suddenly turbulent water surface.</p><p>He had been here meditating on sword techniques and refining the Ebony Sword, and it had always been peaceful. This was the first time such a thing had happened.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was gripped by uncertainty—</p><p>Wave after wave rose, and the sealing power within the water also began to tremble violently.</p><p>Qin Sang realized the source was the sealed space!</p><p>In an instant, massive waves surged, and the entire secret realm shook uncontrollably.</p>
