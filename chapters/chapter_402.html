<h1>Chapter 395: Breakthrough</h1><p>Qin Sang's cultivation was below the Pseudo Core Formation realm, but through his sect's treasured scriptures and discussions with his fellow disciples, he had a general understanding of it. This was the advantage of being a sect disciple. Cultivators of the same realm varied in strength.  Aside from external factors, solely in terms of cultivation, there wouldn't be a world of difference.</p><p>Understanding the consumption rate of magical treasures, Qin Sang could guess Yu Hua's current state, and a bold plan immediately formed in his mind.</p><p>“Retrieve!”</p><p>Qin Sang controlled his magical treasure, recalling the Nine Nether Demonic Flame and the Ten Yama Devil Formation.  He then brought out the Five Elements Sword, walked towards the darkness, took a deep breath, stepped into the darkness, and returned to the side chamber!</p><p>The Flying Night Devil feared the Nine Nether Demonic Flame. It was suppressed by Yu Hua through the power of the magical treasure, preventing it from unleashing its full power.</p><p>Yu Hua certainly wouldn't expect him to dare to return now!</p><p>Qin Sang silently counted the time. After a dizzying sensation, the barrier appeared before him.</p><p>The scene within the side chamber astonished even Qin Sang.  Yu Hua, using some unknown method, had transformed the Nine Nether Demonic Flame into a massive cage of fire, trapping the Flying Night Devil inside. Within the cage, the devil's escape techniques seemed ineffective.</p><p>The Flying Night Devil's fear of the Nine Nether Demonic Flame surpassed Qin Sang's imagination. It roared furiously within the cage, not daring to cross the boundary!</p><p>However, the price Yu Hua paid was not insignificant. His right arm was severed at the elbow, and judging by the wound, it wasn't torn off by the Flying Night Devil but cut off by a sharp weapon.  It was likely that Yu Hua was injured by the Flying Night Devil, poisoned by its corpse venom, and forced to sever his own arm.</p><p>Moreover, Yu Hua's breathing was rapid, indicating significant exhaustion. He stood before the barrier, racing against time to break the restriction.</p><p>The restriction was almost open.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared!</p><p>The two locked eyes across the barrier.</p><p>“You dare return?”</p><p>Yu Hua didn't expect Qin Sang to actually return. Surprise and a hint of wariness flickered in his eyes.</p><p>A ferocious grin spread across Qin Sang's face. He suddenly activated the Five Elements Sword.</p><p>This barrier, like the ice wall opposite, mainly functioned defensively. It seemed the person who left the restriction did so to prevent accidental intrusion by demonic beasts that might damage the core teleportation formation.</p><p>Opening it from the inside wasn't difficult, especially since Yu Hua had already partially broken it.  Borrowing Yu Hua's efforts, the Five Elements Sword easily shattered the barrier.</p><p>Caught off guard, Yu Hua's first reaction was to retreat.</p><p>But Qin Sang decisively abandoned the Five Elements Sword. With a wave of his arm, the hidden Ten Yama Devil Formation appeared. Its main spirit roared, and black demonic flames surged forth, transforming into a long arrow that shot out explosively.</p><p>Yu Hua's pupils dilated, his face filled with shock.</p><p>“Nine Nether Demonic Flame! You…”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The approaching Nine Nether Demonic Flame cut off his words.  Yu Hua paled, retreating rapidly. But Qin Sang acted too quickly, and he was too close to the barrier, leaving no room to maneuver.</p><p>Watching the Nine Nether Demonic Flame rapidly enlarge in his vision, a desperate Yu Hua only had time to throw out a jade bracelet-shaped artifact.</p><p>The jade bracelet was an artifact of excellent quality, kept by Yu Hua as a precaution against unforeseen events while breaking the restriction, a prudent move.</p><p>However, against the power of a magical treasure, this artifact proved too weak.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade bracelet was easily shattered by the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, but it fulfilled its purpose, buying Yu Hua a moment of respite.</p><p>Yu Hua retreated in disarray.  At this point, he couldn't think of any other way to escape the predicament except to activate his magical treasure and recall the Nine Nether Demonic Flame to counter Qin Sang.</p><p>But if he recalled the Nine Nether Demonic Flame to resolve the immediate crisis, what about the Flying Night Devil?</p><p>Yu Hua didn't know.</p><p>Qin Sang, understanding the principle of eliminating all threats, pressed his advantage. The situation didn't allow Yu Hua time to think, forcing him to improvise.</p><p>Yu Hua prayed silently that the mindless Flying Night Devil, not being Qin Sang's refined corpse, wouldn't distinguish between friend and foe…</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Two masses of demonic fire collided.</p><p>Qin Sang's body trembled violently, but he gritted his teeth and persevered.</p><p>The scene Yu Hua most hoped for didn't occur.  The Flying Night Devil seemed to have no regard for Qin Sang, its eyes fixed solely on him, as if he were the only living person in the chamber!</p><p>“Why!”</p><p>Yu Hua roared in frustration, frantically urging his magical treasure to push back Qin Sang while simultaneously manipulating the demonic flames to narrowly block the Flying Night Devil's sudden attacks, attempting to escape.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a figure flashed before him. Qin Sang blocked the exit of the side chamber even faster than him.</p><p>Yu Hua, coveting the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid, wouldn't let Qin Sang go.</p><p>Qin Sang also constantly thought about eliminating Yu Hua!</p><p>If there was no opportunity, he would have prioritized escape.</p><p>But since there was a chance, he had to seize it firmly.</p><p>Letting Yu Hua go free to wreak havoc wouldn't just expose his identity. Decades of his efforts in the Small Cold Territory and Mount Shaohua would be wasted, potentially forcing him to flee the Small Cold Territory.</p><p>Being constantly targeted by a much more powerful demonic cultivator was a feeling Qin Sang refused to experience.</p><p>Therefore, seeing that he couldn't kill Yu Hua by surprise, Qin Sang immediately changed his strategy, choosing to block the entrance to the side chamber and trap him!</p><p>The Flying Night Devil was the most reliable ally.  It feared nothing but the Nine Nether Demonic Flame.</p><p>Qin Sang had no worries about betrayal.</p><p>One man and one corpse, or rather, two "living corpses," cooperated seamlessly.</p><p>With Qin Sang holding back the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, the Flying Night Devil finally unleashed its Gold Core level power, its attacks like thunder, its movements unpredictable.</p><p>Without the magical treasure, even a Yu Hua at his peak wouldn't be a match for the Flying Night Devil, let alone a significantly exhausted Yu Hua. Within a few breaths, defeat became apparent.</p><p>Yu Hua attempted to flee, but Qin Sang and the Flying Night Devil forced him back.</p><p>“You deserve to die!”</p><p>Yu Hua's eyes were bloodshot, his hatred for Qin Sang reaching its peak. With death beckoning, Yu Hua no longer cared about the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid.  Survival was paramount.</p><p>Yu Hua decided to awaken the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu.</p><p>But then, a look of horror spread across his face. “You…”</p><p>“I was just pretending.”</p><p>Qin Sang stood unharmed, revealing his white teeth in a chilling smile at Yu Hua.</p><p>In Yu Hua's eyes, he was like a demon.</p><p>Startled by Qin Sang's smile, Yu Hua revealed a slight opening. The Flying Night Devil struck his chest with a fist, sending him flying with a scream.</p><p>Yu Hua struggled desperately, quickly summoning the Nine Nether Demonic Flame to repel the pursuing Flying Night Devil.</p><p>This was his chance!</p><p>Qin Sang acted decisively, completely exhausting his spiritual power, leaving not a drop in his spiritual sea.  He exerted all his strength to propel the Nine Nether Demonic Flame towards Yu Hua.</p><p>Yu Hua wanted to recall the Nine Nether Demonic Flame to block Qin Sang's sneak attack, but he couldn't form an effective defense in time. Qin Sang seized the opportunity and broke through in one fell swoop!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Nine Nether Demonic Flame had unique properties, burning the soul first. Before any physical injuries appeared on Yu Hua, he let out earth-shattering screams, his Nascent Soul rapidly weakening.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He suddenly redirected the Nine Nether Demonic Flame, blocking the Flying Night Devil.</p>
