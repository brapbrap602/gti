<h1>Chapter 1966: Fox's Lament</h1><p>Qingyang Teahouse.</p><p>Having received the news, Yulang hurried over.</p><p>“Brother Shi, you've emerged from seclusion.”</p><p>“As we were just saying, I should call you Brother Sha,” Xiao Wu chuckled softly, stroking the little white fox nestled in her lap.</p><p>Yulang poured himself a cup of tea and looked at Sha Jiayu quizzically.</p><p>Xiao Wu also wore a curious expression.</p><p>“I am a direct descendant of the Sha Clan. My family suffered a great calamity, and it was inconvenient for me to reveal my true identity, so I adopted the alias Shi. I've kept it from you for so long, brother, you won't blame me, will you?” Sha Jiayu gave a self-deprecating laugh, sighing, “My parents gave me this name, but I didn't expect it to be prophetic.  A single feather of the Sha Clan, drifting alone.”</p><p>Yulang and Xiao Wu exchanged glances, their expressions turning serious.</p><p>“Every time you returned to Qingyang Temple, Elder Brother, you would bring delicacies for Elder Sister and sacred texts and martial arts manuals for me.  We have always cherished this kindness, so what does your surname and given name matter?  Besides, you had such a painful past," Yulang declared resolutely.</p><p>As he spoke, Yulang recalled something.</p><p>No wonder Brother Sha reacted so strongly when Elder Sister was framed by Meng Yusu.</p><p>Bearing such a blood feud, it’s normal to have a strong killing intent. It’s already remarkable that Brother Sha didn’t become a great demon.</p><p>Sha Jiayu said gratefully, “Speaking of which, I also have to thank Daoist Qingfeng and you two for allowing me to retain a shred of clarity and not completely succumb to demonic influence. Every time I returned to Qingyang Temple, although my stay was very short, it was a rare moment of peace in my life. I could completely relax, talk and laugh with you, and forget about those things.”</p><p>A deep nostalgia appeared on his face.</p><p>The total time he spent at Qingyang Temple was only a few days, but for him, it was enough to be etched in his memory.</p><p>Only there did he feel like a living person.</p><p>Xiao Wu bowed slightly, “Elder Brother, now that you are willing to tell us, does it mean you’ve already avenged your family?”</p><p>A strange expression flashed across Sha Jiayu’s face, and he said faintly, “My enemy was the Bai Clan of Guanyang Mountain.  Half a year ago, the entire clan was annihilated, Guanyang Mountain was reduced to ruins, and not a single soul was left alive!”</p><p>Yulang was startled.</p><p>Not a single soul left alive meant that everyone, regardless of age, gender, or status, even the common branches of the family, had been slaughtered.</p><p>Every single person with Bai blood, exterminated!</p><p>But recalling the Sha Clan’s extermination, the Bai Clan had been equally ruthless, and only Sha Jiayu escaped.</p><p>Sha Jiayu’s extermination of the Bai Clan to avenge his family was justified.</p><p>Outsiders couldn’t blame him.</p><p>Yulang looked Sha Jiayu up and down.  He was now a mortal and couldn’t tell if Sha Jiayu was injured.</p><p>When they were at Qingyang Temple, he had heard Sha Jiayu discuss the major powers near the Yan Kingdom, including the Bai Clan of Guanyang Mountain, but at that time, Sha Jiayu’s expression and tone had been completely normal.</p><p>Yulang remembered that the Bai Clan had three Nascent Soul Ancestors!</p><p>Sha Jiayu was only at the late Golden Core stage before.  Even if he successfully stepped into the Nascent Soul stage, he couldn't possibly fight three Nascent Soul cultivators alone.</p><p>He couldn't imagine the price Brother Sha had paid.</p><p>Should he ask Master for medicine?</p><p>Sha Jiayu saw through Yulang’s thoughts and shook his head, “My enemies have been exterminated, but unfortunately, it wasn’t me who eradicated them…”</p><p>Listening to Sha Jiayu recount the events at Guanyang Mountain six months prior, Yulang opened his mouth, unsure whether to be happy for Brother Sha or to console him.</p><p>The extermination of his enemies was certainly cause for joy.</p><p>But Brother Sha had carried the blood feud of his family, lived his entire life for revenge, and yet he couldn't personally kill his enemies…</p><p>Tormented by hatred for two hundred years, unable to find release, everything suddenly lost meaning.</p><p>Yulang keenly noticed a lingering shadow in Brother Sha's eyes.</p><p>If he couldn't let go, over time, it would transform into the heart demon that cultivators feared the most.</p><p>Yulang was worried about Sha Jiayu but didn't know how to comfort him, so he asked, “What do you plan to do in the future, Brother Sha?”</p><p>“The vast world is boundless, and the small Yan Kingdom is but a drop in the ocean. Legend has it that there are all sorts of magical creatures and treasures in the world. I want to travel and see them.”</p><p>Sha Jiayu stood up, walked to the window, and looked out at the vast expanse of blue, a glimmer of interest in his eyes.</p><p>Before this, his heart held only hatred, nothing else.</p><p>When he calmed down and began to think about his future, this was the first thing that came to mind, not cultivation.</p><p>Before, he cultivated diligently for revenge, hatred supporting him, finding every way to survive.</p><p>Now, however, he was lost.</p><p>He couldn't understand, even if he achieved immortality and eternal life, what would he live for?</p><p>Furthermore, he had used the blood sacrifice method to open his Heavenly Meridians, greatly reducing his lifespan, and his hope of breaking through to the Deity Transformation stage was very slim.</p><p>Fate was cruel.</p><p>If the battle of Guanyang Mountain had occurred before he opened his meridians, he wouldn’t have had to resort to such extreme and unorthodox methods out of fear that the Bai Clan’s power would grow, leaving him with no hope of revenge.</p><p>With patience and refinement for a hundred years, aided by the Purple Origin Pill, he might have had a chance to normally form his Nascent Soul.</p><p>“That’s good,” Yulang strongly agreed with Brother Sha's decision.</p><p>Traveling the world could broaden his horizons and perhaps he could find an opportunity to resolve his inner turmoil.</p><p>“However, before I leave, I will stay for a while and assist you,” Sha Jiayu turned around and said.</p><p>“Assist?”</p><p>Yulang was taken aback.</p><p>He guessed that Brother Sha must have broken through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>He had descended into the mortal world, lived among mortals, and considered himself to be no less intelligent or strategic than others, with martial arts skills rarely matched.</p><p>How could he possibly deserve the assistance of a Nascent Soul cultivator?</p><p>Perhaps Brother Sha was tired of the struggles of the cultivation world and wanted to seek peace in the mortal realm, like his Master.</p><p>Yulang thought to himself.</p><p>Sha Jiayu said meaningfully, “Brother, haven’t you noticed that the situation in the mortal world is becoming increasingly strange?”</p><p>Hearing these words, Yulang's expression changed instantly.</p><p>Of course, he had noticed!</p><p>Previously, when he was ordered by the Emperor to suppress the rebellion, he discovered that the rebels' resistance was far stronger than expected.</p><p>There were traces of cultivators among the rebels.</p><p>However, these cultivators did not directly interfere with mortal affairs using their powers, and after the defeat, they vanished without a trace. Yulang had never had any concrete evidence.</p><p>Now, the situation in the Yan Kingdom, the Great Liang Kingdom, and the surrounding countries had become increasingly strange.</p><p>“What happened in the cultivation world?”</p><p>Yulang already had a guess in his mind, and Sha Jiayu only needed to mention it for him to understand immediately.</p><p>Could there be more to the Bai Clan's extermination?</p><p>“I haven’t figured out what happened either. However, in the past six months, I’ve traveled through various countries and witnessed too many unreasonable things.  The cultivation world is showing signs of great chaos.  The mortal world isn't just collateral damage, it’s more than that.  With your powers sealed, you probably don’t know yet, but the Yan Kingdom’s ghosts and gods have sealed the Ghost Gate!”</p><p>The Ghost Gate, the gate between Yin and Yang.</p><p>Closing the Ghost Gate meant that the ghosts and gods of the Yan Kingdom would no longer interfere with worldly affairs, even if demons and monsters harmed mortals, they would no longer intervene.</p><p>They abandoned the mortals, abandoned their incense offerings!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Yulang was shocked.</p><p>No wonder he and Tao Teng had obtained permission to descend into the mortal world so easily.</p><p>What on earth had happened?</p><p>The Yan Kingdom’s ghosts and gods’ actions were no different from self-destruction.</p><p>Sealing themselves off, as if hiding from a great calamity.</p><p>“It’s not just the Yan Kingdom. This great chaos will spread far beyond your and my imagination.”</p><p>Sha Jiayu's gaze drifted, looking towards the foreign countries.</p><p>It was precisely because of this journey that he was shocked to discover that the world outside had changed drastically!</p><p>"Similar things are happening everywhere beyond the Yan Kingdom, in every country, every place, the cultivation world, the mortal world, the ghost and god world, no one can escape.  Most ghosts and gods, like the City God of the Yan Kingdom, have ordered the Ghost Gate to be sealed and no longer interfere with worldly affairs.  But there are also ghosts and gods with consciences, unwilling to let the cultivation world interfere with the mortal world and cause suffering to living beings.  Their fate…”</p><p>Sha Jiayu sighed and didn’t continue.</p><p>Yulang could guess, and instantly felt as if he had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p>“Why… why?”</p><p>Yulang murmured.</p><p>Unsure whether he was asking Sha Jiayu or the heavens.</p><p>He felt a deep sense of helplessness.</p><p>If it were only within the Yan Kingdom, with Brother Sha’s help, perhaps they could protect the safety of the Yan Kingdom’s people.</p><p>The cultivation sects around the Yan Kingdom would probably not offend a Nascent Soul cultivator for the sake of mortals.</p><p>But this was a terrifying catastrophe!</p><p>He himself was but a grain of sand in this catastrophe.</p><p>“It is said that from Cloud Capital Mountain to Twilight Fall Mountain, the entire mortal realm is in chaos.  I was worried that you were unaware of the situation and might offend someone you shouldn’t, so I rushed back immediately.”</p><p>Sha Jiayu paused, seeing Yulang’s bewildered expression, he said regretfully, “Now is not a good time for mortal cultivation. You… might as well return to the mountain.”</p><p>He empathized with Yulang’s feelings.</p><p>This torrent had erased the meaning of his life and would also crush Yulang’s mortal cultivation journey.</p><p>Even if Yulang was brilliant in both literary and martial arts, and diligently governed, he could not stop the coming disaster.</p><p>He and the people of the Yan Kingdom were all ants!</p><p>Return to the mountain, return to Qingyang Temple, to Daoist Qingfeng’s side.</p><p>Daoist Qingfeng was unfathomably powerful and would definitely protect them.</p><p>But…</p><p>Sha Jiayu secretly shook his head.  He wondered if the abrupt end to Yulang’s mortal cultivation would affect his temperament or even leave a heart demon.</p><p>“Jiji! Jiji!”</p><p>Suddenly, the little white fox in Xiao Wu's lap cried out, filled with anxiety.</p><p>Xiao Wu explained, “It’s asking if the demon race will be involved.”</p><p>“Whether human or demon, no one can remain untouched,” Sha Jiayu said with certainty.</p><p>The little white fox’s eyes immediately reddened.  Its two front paws clutched Xiao Wu’s front lapel tightly, letting out anxious cries, “Ying ying ying…”</p><p>Xiao Wu reached out and stroked the little white fox’s head, gently comforting it, saying, “I know.”</p><p>She looked towards the north.</p><p>North, Beikuo County, Yubai Temple.</p><p>Back then, she had followed Qin Sang down the mountain, crossed the desert, and arrived in the Southern Kingdom, and the first place they reached was Beikuo County.</p><p>In Beikuo County.</p><p>She met her first friend, Chen Ya’er.</p><p>Helped a kind-hearted willow demon attain godhood.</p><p>Witnessed for the first time a good person being guided by ghosts and gods after death, stepping onto the path of divinity.</p><p>Helped the ghosts and gods of Beikuo County capture the demon of Yubai Temple and rescued a group of white foxes controlled by the demon.</p><p>The bloodline of those white foxes was similar to this little white fox!</p><p>At the ruins of the Leixiao Sect, the little white fox was still naive, but it remembered the conversation between her Master and herself.</p><p>With a certain level of cultivation and intelligence, the little white fox descended the mountain to search for them, wanting to ask them where its relatives were.</p><p>Unfortunately, she and her Master had long since departed.</p><p>The little white fox went through countless hardships but couldn’t find Xiao Wu.  Fortunately, while lost and confused, it left the Yan Kingdom and Xiao Wu sensed it, leading to their reunion.</p><p>Knowing that its relatives might be in danger, the little white fox couldn't help but plead.</p><p>An image flashed through Xiao Wu's mind.</p><p>In the image, there was a boat, a grandfather and grandson, and a child named Chen Ya’er.</p><p>‘Dong! Dong! Dong!’</p><p>The crisp sound of a pellet drum seemed to echo in her ears.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Xiao Wu’s body trembled, her hair fluttering without wind, and she instantly released the seal on her body.</p><p>Yulang was still in a daze, looking blankly at his Elder Sister.</p><p>He then saw Xiao Wu wave her jade hand, a gust of wind sweeping up the three people in the private room, and in a flash, they appeared outside the capital of the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Yulang hadn't yet realized what happened.</p><p>Sha Jiayu, however, was already wide-eyed, deeply shocked.</p><p>He was already a Nascent Soul cultivator, and having cultivated demonic arts, his strength was a notch above cultivators of the same level.</p><p>Just now, being swept up by Xiao Wu and taken out of the capital, he hadn’t had time to react, unable to do anything.</p><p>In a daze, he was brought into the air.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Sha Jiayu's eyes were as wide as saucers, in disbelief.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yulang were disciples of the same master, and he had always assumed that Xiao Wu’s cultivation wouldn’t be much higher than Yulang’s.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Xiao Wu transformed into a streak of light, flying away with everyone.</p><p>Sha Jiayu stared blankly at the ground below, mountains and cities retreating at a speed he couldn't comprehend, already beyond the Yan Kingdom in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Yulang finally came to his senses.  Forgetting his shock, he was most worried about his Elder Sister's current state, which seemed a bit off.</p><p>“Elder Sister, where are we going?”</p><p>Xiao Wu didn’t answer, her lips pressed tightly together, a foreboding feeling in her heart.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The moment Xiao Wu flew out of the capital.</p><p>A Daoist appeared in the temple courtyard.</p><p>It was Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the courtyard, hands clasped behind his back, silently looking towards the north.</p><p>…</p><p>Xiao Wu flew north with lightning speed, but didn’t forget to conceal her aura.</p><p>Along the way, the scenery below continuously flashed past their vision.</p><p>Some places were still peaceful and tranquil.</p><p>But many places had already become ruins, a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>Fights between cultivators, wars between nations, occurring incessantly.</p><p>Even more lamentable was that in some places, the aura of the Divine Dao could no longer be sensed.</p><p>Xiao Wu didn't stop for a moment.</p><p>Flying past the Ji Kingdom, continuing north, they saw the familiar Fuchun River.</p><p>Getting closer and closer to Beikuo County.</p><p>She subconsciously slowed down.</p><p>Finally, they saw the county town below.</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>Sha Jiayu let out a mournful sigh.</p><p>Beikuo County was in ruins, smoke and dust billowing.  Even from the sky, they could smell the burning, mixed with the thick stench of blood and corpses.</p><p>“Jiji!”</p><p>The white fox suddenly cried out, leaping from Xiao Wu’s arms, and jumping into a mountain valley north of the county town.</p><p>In the valley, there was an abandoned Daoist temple.</p><p>A fierce battle had clearly taken place in the temple. The halls and walls had collapsed, leaving only the temple gate still standing.</p><p>Hanging from the doorframe were clumps of bloody, mangled flesh, emitting a foul odor.</p><p>The outlines of foxes could vaguely be seen, all stripped of their fur.</p><p>Xiao Wu landed by the river outside the county town, paused for a moment, and carefully walked into the town, arriving in front of a collapsed house.</p><p>She stood there.</p><p>Looking at the dark red bloodstains beneath the bricks and rubble.</p><p>“Wuuuu…”</p><p>The sound of a fox’s lament came from the mountains.</p><p>‘Dong! Dong! Dong!’</p><p>The sound of a pellet drum echoed through the ruined Beikuo County.</p><p>Muffled, desolate, mournful. (End of Chapter)</p>
