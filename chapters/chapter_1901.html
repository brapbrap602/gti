<h1>Chapter 1892: Yang Shen (Radiant God)</h1><p>A celestial thunderbolt passed through.</p><p>The beast tide showed a clear pause, fear once again gaining the upper hand.  Many parts of the beast tide showed signs of retreat.  The beasts charged and collided, their ranks thrown into utter chaos.  Even the fearsome great beasts trembled. The thunderbolt didn't strike them directly, but in the eyes of all creatures, the power of the Thunder God was akin to the divine might of the Dao!</p><p>…</p><p>Guifang Kingdom.</p><p>Grand Saint's Manor.</p><p>The drumming stopped. A demon king, still clutching his drumstick, stared blankly at the sky, watching the thunderbolt split the void.  The other demon kings held similar postures. The manor fell silent. Despair filled the hearts of the demons.</p><p>This was the power of the Thunder God! If it struck here, all the demon cultivators and demon kings would be annihilated along with the Grand Saint's Manor.  How could Guifang Kingdom possibly stand against the Dao Sect with such terrifying power? Unless the demon drums could attract a Celestial Master-level beast, their exhaustion would be in vain.</p><p>At this thought, the demons looked towards the moon. The demon Great Saint hadn't given up; it was still fighting!</p><p>…</p><p>Before the South Heavenly Gate.</p><p>The battle between Heaven Transcending Senior and the demon Great Saint paused due to the Thunder God's might.  Heaven Transcending Senior leaned against the Broken Army Divine Sword, his breathing more rapid and ragged than before, yet his eyes shone with a piercing brilliance. He was like a drawn sword, ready to cut down all enemies!</p><p>A Dao Court True Monarch cast an incantation, and heavenly dew descended. Heaven Transcending Senior absorbed the dew, his complexion regaining some color.  For the five-clawed golden dragon, however, the dew was like poison.</p><p>The tide turned slightly in Heaven Transcending Senior’s favor, though only marginally.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A spirit sword flew back to Heaven Transcending Senior, radiating a cold light. He withdrew his gaze from the void, fixing it on his powerful foe.  He noticed the strange behavior of the five-clawed golden dragon, frowning with a sense of foreboding.</p><p>Since the Dao Sect had invoked the Thunder God, the five-clawed golden dragon had ceased its fierce attacks. It stood before the Heavenly Gate, its body blocking the entrance, glaring at Heaven Transcending Senior with a murderous rage, wishing to devour him and grind his bones to dust.</p><p>Though seemingly stunned by the Thunder God's power, the golden dragon remained motionless for a long time. However, a tremendous change was occurring within its body.</p><p>Before its ascension to the heavens, it had swallowed a golden elixir.  This elixir was refined from the demon pill of the previous generation's Great Saint.  It could have been used for a breakthrough, but the five-clawed golden dragon, possessing exceptional talent, had already achieved the Great Saint rank and thus kept the elixir.  Most importantly, this elixir was of the same origin as its bloodline, making it far easier to refine than other pills.</p><p>While battling Heaven Transcending Senior, the golden dragon had been quietly refining this elixir.</p><p>A dragon's roar echoed. The five-clawed golden dragon raised its head high, golden light illuminating the sky and obscuring the moon. It had broken through in the midst of battle!</p><p>This breakthrough would undoubtedly leave hidden dangers, but it was its only chance. It would seize the opportunity while the Dao Court dealt with external enemies, and storm the Divine Court. Even if it couldn't seize the Divine Court entirely, forcing the Dao Sect to compromise with Guifang Kingdom would be enough. At least they wouldn't repeat the mistakes of their ancestors and become mere slaves of the Dao Sect.</p><p>From the ground, one could see it. When the celestial thunder dissipated, a golden sun replaced the moon in the heavens.</p><p>Heaven Transcending Senior straightened up, his expression solemn, but he showed no sign of retreat. Faced with a powerful enemy, he was fearless, his fighting spirit surging.</p><p>His spirit sword sensed its master's will and emitted a clear, resonant hum, seemingly eager for battle.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A golden dragon claw tore through the air, a fierce gust of wind striking his face.</p><p>Heaven Transcending Senior's clothes billowed in the wind as he laughed heartily, "Excellent!"</p><p>The next moment, a thousand-foot-long sword light pierced the heavens!</p><p>…</p><p>Baishi Ritual Platform.</p><p>Kun Dao sat cross-legged on the ritual platform, her gaze fixed on the heavens. She knew that a new change had occurred at the Heavenly Gate, but she was near the end of her strength and could not assist Heaven Transcending Senior.</p><p>She glanced one last time at the deep void, where the void storm caused by the Thunder God's power was growing stronger.</p><p>She then turned her gaze towards Zhongmao. Zhang True Monarch was still in seclusion, attempting a breakthrough!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Kun Dao lightly flicked her jade finger, sending the Baishi Ritual Seal flying towards the west like a streak of light.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was still in a state of confusion, not fully recovered from the impact of the Thunder God's power. The entire process of the descent of the god felt like a fleeting dream.  The sensation was indescribable, exceeding his cultivation and understanding.  In fact, while resisting the mental shock, Qin Sang still couldn't explain how the Thunder God's power had descended and how it had been unleashed from his fingertips.</p><p>If the Thunder God's power were compared to a river, Qin Sang's body was a section of the riverbed. The river water rushed through, but some ‘traces’ inevitably remained.</p><p>From the fragments of his memory, Qin Sang glimpsed something of immense value, a crack opening in a door.  Behind that door lay an unimaginable mystery, a different world entirely, endlessly alluring to any cultivator, and intensely captivating to Qin Sang himself.  He didn't even bother checking for injuries, so eager was he to push open that door and unravel its secrets!</p><p>But the situation wouldn't allow it.</p><p>The figure's eyes were like sharpened blades, attempting to dissect Qin Sang's very being.  The tone was dripping with malice, jolting Qin Sang awake, sending a chill down his spine.</p><p>Trouble was coming!</p><p>Qin Sang realized he was still in grave danger, forcing himself back to rationality.</p><p>“Emperor Sword? What Emperor Sword? What are they talking about?”</p><p>Qin Sang was bewildered, not even knowing the figure's identity.  He was certain he’d never seen this person, neither in this realm nor the Storm Realm; they had no quarrel between them.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang noticed something in the figure’s gaze.  The figure’s eyes were fixed intently on Qin Sang's energy sea, burning with greed and fervor.</p><p>“Emperor Sword? Could it be the Earth Slaughter Sword?”</p><p>Thinking of what lay within him, only the Earth Slaughter Sword fit the description.</p><p>What was the true origin of the Earth Slaughter Sword? Why was it called an Emperor Sword? The figure was clearly an outsider; how did they know about the sword being within him?</p><p>That palm strike, shattering the void before him, was far too close to be accidental.  He had clearly been targeted beforehand!</p><p>Overwhelmed by questions, Qin Sang's reaction was instantaneous – an instinctive retreat.  Unfortunately, the Celestial Patrol Chariot was destroyed, plunging him into the clouds below, robbing him of its instant-escape ability.  His Lei Zu power was also depleted; he was entirely on his own.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>With a powerful flap of his phoenix wings, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of lightning, shooting backwards.  At this moment, he had no other thoughts; he could only do his best and leave the rest to fate.</p><p>The palm strike, capable of shattering void like the silver threads, piercing the Divine Court barrier, indicated that its wielder’s cultivation was not far inferior to the silver thread user’s.  And repelling the silver threads had required summoning the power of Lei Zu!</p><p>If this figure was the wielder of the palm strike, then whatever Qin Sang did would be futile.</p><p>However, the pressure he felt from the figure wasn't as overwhelming; he didn't feel utterly helpless. Perhaps the figure, originally powerful, had paid an exorbitant price to breach the Divine Court, sustaining grievous injuries. After all, the figure’s expression and cries when emerging from the blood pool showed immense pain.  Or perhaps the figure wasn't the wielder at all, but had been forcibly sent here.</p><p>With death imminent, Qin Sang couldn’t, and didn’t want to, investigate further. He had to fight for his life, even if he could only buy himself a moment; that would be a chance of survival!</p><p>The fact that he could channel Lei Zu’s power meant someone had been watching over him – Tian Yue Shang Ren, the Daoist Court True Monarch, and the mysterious person Tian Yue Shang Ren had spoken of. He only hoped they wouldn't abandon him after using him.</p><p>As soon as he moved, Qin Sang realized his condition wasn’t as bad as he’d thought; he still had the capacity to fight.  In that instant, he couldn't recall how many things he did, pushing himself to his limit.  His blood roared within him, a faint golden light emanating from his body, along with the faint shadow of an inner armor. The Great Vajra Wheel Seal and the Ming Shan Armor protected his body.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of a sword echoed through the empty Divine Court.  A point of sword light shot from his brow.  The Cloud Wanderer Sword, displaying its sharpness, sliced through the clouds and mists, aiming for the enemy.</p><p>Within his energy sea.</p><p>The Celestial Eye Butterfly spread its wings, the Celestial Eye patterns on its wings rapidly rotating, bloodshot threads filling the eyes, fully activating its Celestial Eye ability, locking onto the figure's every move.</p><p>…</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang was also calling out to the young Vermillion Bird, hoping for its assistance to activate the Solar God Tree.  Unfortunately, his calls fell on deaf ears; the young Vermillion Bird did not respond.</p><p>Had the Lei Zu power injured it?</p><p>Qin Sang, barely holding on himself, couldn't afford to worry about the young Vermillion Bird, unleashing all his fastest divine arts.</p><p>Alas, all to no avail!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Sword intent locked onto the figure, the sword light like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The figure’s cruel smile transformed into a contemptuous sneer. A point of blood light flickered within them, then they vanished into nothingness, disappearing into thin air.</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang lost sight of them, vanished from the Celestial Eye ability.</p><p>Not entirely, though.</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified to discover that thin strands of blood, like a vast net, crisscrossed the void, everywhere.  The blood net formed, then closed in an instant. Qin Sang saw a flash of blood light, the net reforming before him, revealing a grotesque face – the figure.</p><p>A figure's face was almost pressed against Qin Sang's, incredibly close!</p><p>Thunder techniques were useless against the figure.</p><p>"This is... a Yang God!"</p><p>In recent years, Qin Sang had frequently visited the Baishi ritual grounds, gaining permission to read various Daoist scriptures and encountering similar descriptions.</p><p>Just as in body cultivation, the stages of  "transforming into a spirit" and "refining into emptiness" are vividly depicted as inner and outer scenes.</p><p>Spiritual cultivation has similar concepts, termed Yin God and Yang God.</p><p>Extreme spiritual cultivators, upon achieving Yang Godhood, might even abandon their physical bodies—a process called shedding the mortal shell—becoming unbound and existing solely as a Yang God.</p><p>Legend says powerful Yang Gods can merge with the heavens and earth, traversing boundless realms.</p><p>This meant the figure was at least a Refinement of Emptiness realm cultivator!</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Blood-red light appeared in the figure's pupils, a dull crimson similar to the blood pool, with a strange rune flickering faintly within.</p><p>The rune imprinted itself onto Qin Sang's eyes, identical runes appearing in his pupils.</p><p>Simultaneously, the figure transformed into a streak of blood, penetrating Qin Sang's body and entering through his eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely defenseless.</p><p>His consciousness remained clear.</p><p>The crimson rune clearly had a hypnotic and controlling effect, but its power was far inferior to the power of the Thunder God, unable to penetrate the jade Buddha's flaws and thus ineffective against Qin Sang.</p><p>However, the jade Buddha couldn't save him.</p><p>The moment the figure possessed him, the light vanished from Qin Sang's eyes, his body stiffening.</p><p>He felt he'd lost control of his body, his blood and true essence nearly frozen.</p><p>Powerful spiritual cultivators are unpredictable and possess countless methods to subdue their foes; the jade Buddha wasn't omnipotent.</p><p>Even when pursued by two demon kings, Qin Sang hadn't felt this helpless.</p><p>Within his Purple Mansion.</p><p>Dim bloodlight suddenly flashed.</p><p>The figure reformed.</p><p>"Where did you obtain the Emperor Sword?"</p><p>The accusatory voice echoed through the Purple Mansion, icy and cold.</p><p>However, the figure merely asked casually; it could already manipulate Qin Sang at will, making possession or soul-searching quicker methods.</p><p>The figure focused on Qin Sang's primordial spirit, only to see a spirit wearing grey armor, causing it to let out a surprised sound.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>This was the Yin-Yang armor formed by cultivating the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique."</p><p>When the power of the Thunder God descended, the armor was the first to shatter.</p><p>The instant the figure entered his body, Qin Sang instinctively condensed the Yin-Yang armor to conceal the jade Buddha's light.</p><p>The jade Buddha was his greatest secret.</p><p>But what good was it to hide the jade Buddha from the enemy?</p><p>The figure easily shattered the Yin-Yang armor.  Even with Qin Sang's consciousness and primordial spirit intact, he was no match for the figure; his fate was predictable.</p><p>Sure enough, the figure hesitated not at all, lunging at Qin Sang's primordial spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't attempt to escape with his primordial spirit; it remained motionless, seemingly surrendering.</p><p>Yet, within the stillness, an almost imperceptible fluctuation occurred.</p><p>Facing death, Qin Sang was completely absorbed, ignoring the powerful enemy; his mind filled with only one scripture—the "Tianmo Zhaosheng Jing"!</p><p>This scripture was obtained from the Qinghu Saint King, although Qin Sang already knew its origins.</p><p>Cultivating this scripture allowed one to actively invite celestial demons to refine one's mentality.</p><p>The Hui Guang Saint tried to use this scripture to harm him, but instead, Qin Sang used it to condense the Wu Sheng Demon Seal, breaking through the Transformation God realm!</p><p>However, cultivating this scripture left hidden dangers.</p><p>The celestial demon intent he had drawn during the ritual was twofold; the first vanished inexplicably, seemingly screaming before its disappearance.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected it might be connected to the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>If his guess was correct, the master of the second celestial demon intent must be incredibly powerful.</p><p>Being targeted by this celestial demon, even with the jade Buddha's protection, Qin Sang couldn't help but worry.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he could consider how to deal with the demon tribulation he faced during his breakthrough, he was about to actively invite another celestial demon!</p><p>According to the scripture, inviting a celestial demon required establishing a ritual altar.</p><p>The Great Dao is interconnected.</p><p>Few were likely more proficient in this than the Daoist sect, whose practices are deeply tied to altars.</p><p>Sects have their sect altars, the Daoist court has ritual and pacification altars.  Rituals require altars, cultivation requires altars, inviting deities, summoning generals, and performing ceremonies all begin with establishing a Xuan altar.</p><p>To practice Daoist rituals, Qin Sang had to thoroughly understand this.</p><p>As the saying goes, "If you desire something, act accordingly; if you feel something, resonate with it; merge with it, without being bound to external objects."</p><p>Within the Daoist sect, those with sufficient cultivation could summon deities without relying on physical altars.</p><p>During the Yuan Ying stage, external objects were necessary, requiring the creation of altars; but Qin Sang was no longer the same, having already once invited a celestial demon. He understood the scripture's meaning and principles; there was no need for such complexities.</p><p>Using his spiritual sense, he created an invisible altar!</p><p>Instantly, endless coldness enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang felt his consciousness freeze; this celestial demon's intent was far more terrifying than before, as if it had been waiting for him.</p><p>The moment he felt it.</p><p>It arrived!</p><p>Just as the figure was about to reach Qin Sang's primordial spirit, it sensed the chill, suddenly freezing, its face filled with terror.</p><p>(End of chapter)</p>
