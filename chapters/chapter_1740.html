<h1>Chapter 1731:  Old Friends and Past Events</h1><p>A cultivator was approaching, his aura strong, a Yuan Ying early-stage expert, my spiritual sense perceived.  His trajectory was directly towards me.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the token in his hand, stood still, and looked towards the approaching cultivator.  Soon, a blue streak of light tore through the air, revealing a man in long robes.</p><p>The man was handsome and appeared to be in his forties.  As he flew, a pale blue sword light danced around him. The surrounding storm was drawn to the sword light, transforming into swirling water that he manipulated with some skill, greatly increasing his speed – a remarkable feat for someone of his cultivation level.</p><p>The Rain-Swept Lands were perpetually drenched. The man utilized the environment to his advantage.</p><p>Qin Sang remained motionless, but the man sensed nothing until he saw him.  Seeing a figure standing on the sea, the man was startled, his eyes wary. He stopped before reaching Qin Sang.</p><p>He kept his sword unsheathed, a sign of caution yet politeness. He bowed and asked, "I am Zhuo Yunshui, a protector of the Four Saints Palace. Did you activate the sacred token, friend?"</p><p>As he spoke, he saw the token in Qin Sang’s right hand, his expression softening slightly.</p><p>The sacred token held exceptional significance within the Four Saints Palace. Only the most honored guests, or those who had aided the Palace in times of crisis, were bestowed with one.  Only a few within the Palace had the authority to grant them.</p><p>Since the establishment of the Four Saints’ lineage, probably only a few dozen tokens had been issued. During the Palace's decline, secluded from the world, perhaps centuries had passed without a single one being given away.</p><p>Holding the token, the man was clearly not an enemy.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui's mind raced, subtly observing Qin Sang, growing increasingly puzzled and alarmed. He knew the identities of most recent recipients, but this person was completely unfamiliar.</p><p>Although standing before him, Qin Sang was imperceptible to his spiritual sense.  If he hadn't seen him with his own eyes, he would have found it hard to believe that anyone was nearby.</p><p>This could only mean that the other's cultivation far surpassed his own!</p><p>Could he be a hidden master from some secluded sect?</p><p>"Protector Zhuo is referring to this token?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised the token.</p><p>The man’s tone suggested that the token was very special to the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>Remembering that day, Qin Sang realized that the token was probably not intended for him but for Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>Sadly, Elder Qingzhu had been mortally wounded...</p><p>Remembering old friends and past events, Qin Sang sighed. If given the chance, he would return to that valley to pay his respects.</p><p>"I, Qin, along with Daoist friend Bao Zhengnan, fought together against enemies at the Seven Kill Hall. This token was given to me by Daoist Bao, who instructed me to activate it in the far north of the Rain-Swept Lands should I visit the Four Saints Palace."</p><p>Qin Sang explained.</p><p>"So Daoist Qin is an old friend of the Palace Master! My apologies! My deepest apologies!"</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui bowed again, but his expression revealed that he didn't recognize Qin Sang.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan had become the Palace Master!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered, but he wasn't surprised.  He listened as Zhuo Yunshui continued, "A visit from you should have been met by the Palace Master in person. Unfortunately, the Palace Master is currently overseeing Tianxing Island.  I am responsible for guarding this area.  Sensing the token's activation, I took the liberty of coming to greet you. Please forgive my presumptuousness."</p><p>With that, Zhuo Yunshui asked no more, gesturing towards the Palace, personally inviting Qin Sang inside.  He had already informed the Palace – each token had a unique marking, and the Palace Master on Tianxing Island would have been notified.  The elders would make arrangements.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui watched Qin Sang, his confusion deepening.  The Palace Master’s long presence on Tianxing Island wasn't a secret in the Canglang Sea. Why would someone visiting the Palace Master come here instead of going directly to Tianxing Island?</p><p>Could this truly be a reclusive cultivator, oblivious to worldly affairs?</p><p>Qin Sang gleaned information from Zhuo Yunshui's words. It seemed Tianxing Island was back under the Four Saints Palace's control. The situation in the Canglang Sea was vastly different from what it had been. He wondered about the outcome of the righteous-demonic conflict.</p><p>He nodded and followed Zhuo Yunshui.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui, intent on testing him, flew with full power, pushing his swordsmanship and flight to their limits.  To his astonishment, even when he was exhausted, Qin Sang remained calmly three zhang behind, neither closer nor further.  Qin Sang's breathing was even; only his clothes fluttered in the wind.</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui was startled and dared not entertain any other thoughts. He took Qin Sang and flew northeast.</p><p>Approaching Si Sheng Palace, they saw two figures approaching from afar.</p><p>"Greetings to Elder Wu and Elder Xiao."</p><p>Zhuo Yunshui stopped and bowed, using divine sense to explain Qin Sang's identity.</p><p>The two elders landed before Qin Sang, bowing, "The Palace Master is overjoyed to hear of Daoist Qin's visit and will return to the Palace tomorrow. We've been instructed to welcome you with the utmost respect."</p><p>Like Zhuo Yunshui, they were full of questions.  They hadn't participated in the Yitian Peak demon-slaying battle and didn't recognize Qin Sang.</p><p>"It's kind of Daoist Bao to remember me," Qin Sang smiled faintly, waving his hand. "No need for such a grand welcome. I'm simply visiting old friends."</p><p>Qin Sang followed the two elders onward.</p><p>Soon, a large shadow appeared behind the rain curtain.  </p><p>Floating above the sea, the shadow, visible through the rain, revealed a vast expanse of palaces, exuding an extraordinary presence. This must be the legendary Si Sheng Palace.</p><p>Si Sheng Palace, a unique dojo meticulously established by the Four Saints, possesses a remarkable characteristic.</p><p>When secluded, activating the corresponding spirit array allows it to blend into the storm zone, shielding it from worldly affairs.  </p><p>When it chooses to appear, it manifests before the world, becoming a sacred place.</p><p>Si Sheng Palace's open display, without concealment, shows absolute confidence in its unassailable position.</p><p>The two elders' cultivation—both at the mid-Yuan Ying stage—demonstrates the Palace's profound foundation.</p><p>From above, the view encompassed exquisite and ornate palaces.  Vegetation was scarce, only a few green patches visible at the edges, likely medicinal fields.</p><p>This contrasted sharply with the typical secluded immortal dwellings hidden amidst deep mountains and clouds.</p><p>Si Sheng Palace resembled a city, its palaces arranged systematically according to the Bagua positions, layered concentrically. The Palace Master and elders resided at the center.</p><p>The further outward, the lower the occupant's status, with different functional areas extending outwards.</p><p>Landing with the elders, Qin Sang was enveloped by a rich spiritual aura. Though not as potent as Luye, it was still a top-tier dojo in the Central Plains.</p><p>Furthermore, Si Sheng Palace was larger than Luye, capable of accommodating a whole sect.</p><p>Upon arrival, however, Qin Sang found the number of cultivators surprisingly small. He learned that most disciples had relocated their retreats to Si Sheng Mountain on Tianxing Island, leaving only a few at the main palace.</p><p>The elders settled Qin Sang in a quiet chamber and offered him celestial wine and fruits.</p><p>Qin Sang had many questions but hesitated to ask unfamiliar people, patiently awaiting Bao Zhengnan's return.</p><p>The next evening,</p><p>As Qin Sang meditated, sensing an activated restriction, he went outside. Five individuals stood there: Elders Wu and Xiao, accompanied by two men and a woman.</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the man and woman; Bao Zhengnan and his sister, Bao Xi.  Having received news, they immediately departed from Tianxing Island, activating the ancient teleportation array to the Rain Desert, arriving within a day.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan had changed significantly.  Once a young man, he now appeared to be in his forties, shedding his youthful appearance.</p><p>His bearing as Palace Master was majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p>Bao Xi remained beautiful, yet with a mature charm.</p><p>A stranger, a young man in white, stood beside Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi, receiving respectful treatment from Elders Wu and Xiao.</p><p>Upon meeting, both sides were astonished.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by the trio's cultivation levels.</p><p>When they last parted, Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi were both at the late Golden Core stage. Now, Bao Zhengnan had reached the late Yuan Ying stage, while Bao Xi was at the mid Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>The young man's aura was only slightly weaker than Bao Zhengnan's; another grand cultivator!</p><p>After the loss of two powerful cultivators centuries ago, Si Sheng Palace hadn’t declined; instead, it had produced numerous top-tier experts!</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the others were equally shocked by Qin Sang.</p><p>Informed beforehand that Qin Sang might be comparable to them, considering the prowess of their former master, they anticipated a strong disciple.</p><p>But upon seeing him, they found his aura incredibly subtle and unreadable!</p><p>They presumed he'd reached the pinnacle of the late Yuan Ying stage, never imagining his ascension to the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan was the first to recover, bowing and sighing, "Daoist Qin, it's been almost six hundred years since Yitian Peak, hasn't it?"</p><p>"Indeed,"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed. "Though centuries have passed, those memories remain vivid. Were it not for the selfless sacrifice of those seniors in slaying the demons, we would all be long dead."</p><p>Recalling the past, a sense of camaraderie subtly grew between them.</p><p>They exchanged smiles. Bao Zhengnan introduced Qin Sang to his sister, "This is my younger sister.  Daoist Qin, you should remember her. She's mentioned you many times, eagerly awaiting your arrival.  This is my junior brother, Zhuo Ming. He's now the Grand Elder of the Four Saints Palace."</p><p>"Brother, even as Palace Master, you can't help but be so outspoken. Please forgive me, Daoist Qin," Bao Xi interjected, playfully. Her beautiful eyes twinkled as they rested on Qin Sang's face before she covered her mouth and smiled. "I still remember clearly how Daoist Qin delivered the fatal blow to the ancient demon, turning the tide of battle all those years ago.  It's wonderful to see you again, your brilliance remains unchanged."</p><p>...</p><p>After a pleasant exchange, everyone settled down in the quiet room.</p><p>Elders Wu and Xiao took their leave, while Zhuo Ming stayed, mostly silent, observing their reunion.</p><p>"It's been many years. The Four Saints Palace is brimming with talent and exceptional individuals," Qin Sang remarked, gazing at the three, his thoughts drifting to Qingzhu.</p><p>If only there had been so many experts back then, the outcome might have been different! Qingzhu wouldn't have died, and Bao Zhengnan's two grandmasters wouldn't have fallen so prematurely.</p><p>During their conversation, Qin Sang learned that not long after leaving the Four Saints Palace, the elderly master of the palace perished in a heavenly tribulation, reuniting with the Southern Return Immortal in the afterlife.</p><p>Shortly after, the天道宗 sect leader, Lingzhuzi, met the same fate.</p><p>The Demon Lord, after leaving the Seven Killing Hall, vanished without a trace, withdrawing from the world. Rumor has it he sought a place to heal his wounds, but with no news for nearly six hundred years, his injuries might be as severe as, or even worse than, Lingzhuzi's, especially after sacrificing the Yin Heavenly Ghost divine light. His survival seems unlikely.</p><p>And then there were the three Grand Alliance Masters and Old Mu, who died on Yi Tian Peak.</p><p>The Yi Tian Peak battle left both righteous and demonic sects severely weakened, leading to the dissolution of the three Grand Alliances.  The losses were significant; not only did humanity suffer, but the Witch Clan lost their Great Shaman, and the Demon Clan lost their Jiao King, leaving the Cang Lang Sea in turmoil.</p><p>Before his death, Lingzhuzi, as the sect leader, managed to stabilize the situation. Otherwise, with so few human experts left, a great upheaval would have surely occurred.</p><p>The subsequent events unfolded as they did, ultimately making the Four Saints Palace the greatest beneficiary.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan guessed what Qin Sang was reflecting on. Recalling his two grandmasters, a look of sadness flickered across his face, but his resolve was firm, and he quickly regained his composure. "In fact, we owe our current standing to Daoist Qin."</p><p>'Oh?'</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. "What do you mean?"</p><p>Bao Zhengnan spoke seriously, "Do you remember the young woman you entrusted to me?"</p><p>"Su Nu."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>He certainly hadn't forgotten Su Nu.  Not only was she exceptionally talented, but even after becoming a pawn of the three Grand Alliance Masters, she never gave up, constantly resisting. Her unwavering resolve and decisiveness were extraordinary.</p><p>Before arriving, Qin Sang had reflected on the past, and among those he knew, excluding the demon clan, Su Nu, now free from constraints, seemed most likely to achieve extraordinary success.</p><p>"It's her!"</p><p>Bao Zhengnan nodded, pausing before continuing. "The full story goes back a long time. Since the Four Saints' ancestors established their lineage, their descendants proved unworthy, causing a gradual decline.  However, the legacy of the ancestors was profound.  Without an unforeseen incident, the palace could have maintained its existence for a long time, even if not as prosperous as before, it wouldn't have retreated from the world.  The reason is that several grandmasters discovered a hidden realm in the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall. After analyzing it, they believed it contained a great legacy, so they gathered the palace's experts to explore it. Unfortunately, they triggered ancient restrictions inside, failing to obtain any treasures and barely escaping, each injured.  From then on, the Four Saints Palace declined drastically."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan looked up at Qin Sang. "After the Yi Tian Peak battle, human experts fell one after another, while the demon and witch clans lurked, creating a critical situation.  We had no choice but to gamble and continue exploring that hidden realm. During the next opening of the Seven Killing Hall, while exploring the hidden realm, Su Nu stepped forward. She claimed that after being possessed by the ancient demon, while the demon's soul was destroyed, some strange power remained in her body, granting her divine abilities beyond our reach, which proved invaluable in the hidden realm. She helped us open the realm and obtain its legacy. My sister, junior brother Lu, and I all benefited. Without that opportunity, we wouldn't be where we are today."</p><p>Qin Sang was also surprised, never expecting such a connection after rescuing Su Nu.</p><p>"Where is Su Nu now?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Considering Bao Zhengnan and the others had all broken through to the late Yuan Ying stage, Su Nu, as the leader, should be at least as strong, right?</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and Bao Xi exchanged a strange look. "When the Seven Killing Hall opened, Su Nu was last seen acting alone in the inner hall. Unexpectedly, the Seven Killing Hall underwent a change, forcing us to flee. At the last moment, we discovered that Su Nu was somehow on top of Yi Tian Peak and couldn't escape.  Her whereabouts are currently unknown."</p><p>(End)</p>
