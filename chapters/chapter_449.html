<h1>Chapter 442: Standoff</h1><p>Both were severely injured, but their lives were not in danger.  The waters around the archipelago were scattered with barren islands, overgrown with weeds and moss; some even piled high with bird droppings.  These high-ranking Golden Core cultivators didn't bother with such things, finding a relatively level spot to begin their urgent recuperation.</p><p>The Golden Core cultivators had only just appeared when booming sounds echoed from beyond the fog, as if someone was attacking the True Water Illusory Array.  The fog muffled the sounds, making them dull, but the scale was astonishing and relentless.</p><p>The fog began to tremble.  Qin Sang and the others, within the array, could vaguely see colored orbs of light appearing deep within the fog. These orbs represented powerful spells and magical artifacts; though dim and unable to penetrate the fog for now, their sheer number put immense pressure on the Xiaohan cultivators.</p><p>It was unclear how many cultivators the Tianxing Alliance had sent, but the orbs flickered like a never-ending fireworks display. Each boom resonated in everyone's hearts.  They whispered amongst themselves, anxiously watching the fog, many showing expressions of unease.</p><p>If the array broke, close combat would ensue. Even if they weren't slaughtered by the Golden Core cultivators, being caught in the crossfire wouldn't be pleasant.  They could only hope the True Water Illusory Array was strong enough to withstand the Tianxing Alliance’s assault.</p><p>Fortunately, despite the constant turmoil, the fog remained relatively stable.  As time went on, the Tianxing Alliance cultivators seemed to realize their haphazard attacks were futile, and their assault became more organized.  The orbs coalesced, glowing like a blazing sun, advancing and retreating in unison.</p><p>Each strike caused the fog to shake far more violently than before, threatening to dissipate entirely, deepening everyone's anxieties.  Faced with the Tianxing Alliance's concerted attack, the Golden Core cultivators controlling the array were nearing their limit.</p><p>Seeing this, Shepo awakened some of the less severely injured Golden Core cultivators to assist in maintaining the True Water Illusory Array. Then she personally guided the Foundation Establishment disciples, channeling spiritual energy into the disc to lend their strength.</p><p>With these reinforcements, the fog gradually stabilized, and a stalemate ensued. The Tianxing Alliance remained unable to break the array, and their attacks grew less frequent.</p><p>Hail fell from the sky, accompanied by a biting wind.  Qin Sang sat on a rocky outcrop, drenched in sweat, his spiritual energy nearly depleted. But seeing the Tianxing Alliance's stalled offensive, he knew it had all been worthwhile.</p><p>The hail turned to a light rain. The previously frozen water surface melted instantly.  The spectacular scene elicited gasps of wonder.</p><p>The fog remained quiet for a long time.  No one knew what the Tianxing Alliance cultivators were doing.  Had they given up? Or were they searching for another way to break the array?</p><p>"Old hag!" a roar suddenly boomed from beyond the fog.  "Hiding inside the array, are you planning to be a coward forever?  Come out and fight like a true cultivator!"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced secretly at Shepo, who was busy helping the Di surname Golden Core cultivator refine the True Water Illusory Array, her head down, completely ignoring the Tianxing Alliance’s provocation.</p><p>Their repeated taunts met with no response, causing their insults to become increasingly vicious.</p><p>"Why isn't the old hag saying anything?"</p><p>"Scared witless, are you?"</p><p>"Are you busy dual-cultivating with your snake demon lover?  Ha ha…"</p><p>"I’ve seen it, the old hag and the snake monster are clearly up to something. I wonder how they manage dual-cultivation, with the snake monster still half-formed…"</p><p>"Dual-cultivating with one's own spirit beast?  I've never heard of such a thing. No wonder everyone from Xiaohan is called a barbarian; only these uncouth tribesmen would do such things!"</p><p>…</p><p>Obscenities and laughter filled the air as the Tianxing Alliance cultivators heaped insults upon them. The Xiaohan cultivators were furious, and some began to shout back.  Separated by the fog, they engaged in a verbal brawl like commoners in a village squabble, with their vocabulary hardly surpassing that of ordinary people—a rare sight in the cultivation world.</p><p>Shepo remained unmoved, as if the insults weren't directed at her.  Her snake-bodied companion, however, could not restrain himself.  His tail lashed against the ground, his scarlet tongue flickered rapidly, emitting a hissing sound. His cold eyes glared fiercely at the outside of the fog, exuding an intensely chilling aura charged with anger.  The pressure was too much for the nearby Foundation Establishment cultivators, who hastily retreated.</p><p>Shepo reached out and stroked the snake-bodied man's head, whispering something in his ear.  She somehow managed to calm his rage.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A man whose body was that of a serpent glowed with green light. When the light faded, he had transformed into a slender green snake,  thin as a finger.  With lightning speed, it zipped to the Serpent Matriarch's wrist, transforming into a snake bracelet.</p><p>Outside, the shouting continued, and the attacks on the protective array resumed.</p><p>With the help of the Serpent Matriarch and the others, they persevered for some time longer. Finally, the Di Clan Gold Core cultivator opened his eyes, wiping the sweat from his face.  He sighed in relief, “The spirit array is complete!”</p><p>No visible changes were apparent in the array, but under the assault by the Skyfaring League, the sea mist was significantly more stable than before.  Those operating the array looked much more relaxed.</p><p>Sensing the changes in the True Water Thousand Illusions Array, the Skyfaring League cultivators realized that the Xiaohan Region had stabilized their position.  Seeing their efforts were futile, they began to retreat.</p><p>“Old hag, we’ll see how long you can play turtle!  Show some guts and never come out to look for the Celestial Peak!”</p><p>The shouts faded into the distance as the Skyfaring League cultivators withdrew.</p><p>The commotion seemed to have subsided.</p><p>Deputy Island Master Xiao sighed, “It’s a pity. I never imagined it was true; the Celestial Peak appeared nearby!  If only we’d sent a few more Gold Core cultivators to search… Even without precise information, the Skyfaring League would suspect something.  They certainly won’t give up and will likely amass troops here.”</p><p>Fang and Shentu, who had been recovering from their injuries, spoke weakly, “We are to blame for our carelessness. We were discovered by the Skyfaring League.  We beg the two Island Masters to punish us.”</p><p>The Serpent Matriarch shook her head, “It’s not your fault. The Celestial Peak is crucial to the struggle for control of the Ziwei Palace—it's the Skyfaring League's only chance. Even if Elder Sister and Deputy Island Master Xiao had gone themselves, it would have been hard to avoid their notice. Although we know the Celestial Peak drifted to that area of water, its exact location remains elusive in the short term.  The Celestial Peak's protective enchantments are incredibly well hidden, making its discovery far from certain. The outcome is still undecided.”</p><p>She paused, then continued:</p><p>“Since the Celestial Peak has appeared, until we find it, this place will be a battleground between our Xiaohan Region and the Skyfaring League. A major confrontation is inevitable.</p><p>“We should use the True Water Thousand Illusions Array as a foundation to rebuild Stargazing Island here.</p><p>“Time is of the essence. I shall immediately send messages to all the sects, summoning their disciples to aid us.</p><p>“Di Daoist friend, please send word back to your sect, requesting several cultivators to reinforce the True Water Thousand Illusions Array.  All necessary spirit materials will be taken from Stargazing Island.”</p>
