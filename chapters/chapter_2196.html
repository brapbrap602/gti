<h1>Chapter 2186: Reunion with Yuan Jian</h1><p>A bright flame, like a nimble fire spirit, erupted from the talisman in Qin Sang's palm, struggling to break free.  </p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli sensed the talisman resonating with some unknown force, immediately releasing their hold.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The talisman shot out, Qin Sang and Liuli swiftly followed, chasing after it through the empty void.</p><p>Along the way, they frequently saw areas torn apart by radiant light, some transformed into boundless seas of light stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>The sacred land was nearly destroyed, leaving them in a world riddled with holes, destined to share the same fate. No one knew how the situation would ultimately unfold.</p><p>Qin Sang silently calculated the time; they had been chasing the talisman for almost a day when the flame suddenly flared, invigorating them both. They guessed they were nearing their destination.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He secretly transmitted a message to Liuli, simultaneously restraining the talisman with his true energy, halting their movement. He turned to his left.</p><p>Moments later, a faint light appeared on their left, containing a flame similar to the talisman.</p><p>Its trajectory matched the talisman's direction.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged glances.  As expected, not only had the ancestor of the Gou tribe left a guide, but also strong warriors from various tribes were gathering, the situation uncertain. A great battle seemed inevitable.</p><p>The light paused, the occupant noticing their presence.  Only one figure, indistinct, was visible within the light.</p><p>The two parties faced each other across the vast void.</p><p>Coincidentally, the space between them suddenly ripped open, a torrent of radiant light obscuring their view.</p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, this person is from a tribe within the Water Tribe," Qin Sang said, "Hopefully the Water and Sky Tribes will continue their conflict, giving us outsiders a chance."</p><p>Liuli nodded. "Exactly!  Following your suggestion, Qin Daoist, should we seek out the Yuanxiang clan leader, or watch from the sidelines?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  "Normally, there might be a chance to profit from the chaos, but now, with possible Unity Stage powerhouses on both sides, we're not in a position to be opportunistic. We can only side with one and fish in troubled waters.”</p><p>Their biggest concern was that a Unity Stage powerhouse might consider the sacred land their private domain, barring all outsiders. They could only take things one step at a time.</p><p>Qin Sang released the talisman, and they continued their journey. After half an hour, the landscape changed.  Before them lay an expanse of grey-white; upon closer inspection, it was a boundless expanse of fog blocking their path.</p><p>The fog was thick and deep. Even with his celestial vision, Qin Sang could only see endless mist.  The scene reminded them of the spiritual mist in the Heart Lake.  Could the Heart Lake be here, its mist still lingering?</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, unable to find the cultivator he had encountered earlier, unsure if they had already entered.</p><p>The flame pulsed, eager to penetrate the fog.</p><p>After brief consultation, acknowledging their limited information, they decided against rashly entering, opting instead to circle the fog and observe.</p><p>Choosing a direction, they flew along the edge of the mist. Shortly after, they saw ripples on the fog's surface, as a streak of light plunged into it.</p><p>Soon, a second light arrived. Its occupant noticed Qin Sang and Liuli, paused briefly, glanced in their direction, then eagerly entered the fog.</p><p>"Something's not right..."</p><p>Liuli frowned.</p><p>Something within the fog seemed to be attracting these people, creating a sense of urgency.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>They immediately decided against further observation, releasing the talisman and chasing the flame into the fog.</p><p>Traveling through the fog, they were constantly enveloped by its swirling sounds, yet surprisingly, it wasn't as perilous as expected.</p><p>"The spiritual mist is getting thicker..."</p><p>Qin Sang observed the changes in the mist.</p><p>Liuli nodded, about to speak, but abruptly fell silent, her expression alert.  Qin Sang had already sensed the anomaly; powerful auras radiated from ahead—so many strong individuals gathered together!</p><p>"They're all Yi Ren Tribe warriors. What are they doing?" Qin Sang transmitted, his heart growing wary.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang sensed several gazes upon them—their presence had been discovered!</p><p>Should they join them or retreat and observe?</p><p>As Qin Sang hesitated, he sensed a faint, familiar aura, and his expression softened. He immediately signaled Liuli to fly toward it.</p><p>The aura seemed to be in a meditative state, but soon noticed them, breaking from the group and flying towards them.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, gazing at the approaching figure, and bowed. "Greetings, Clan Leader Yuanxiang."</p><p>Liuli also bowed.</p><p>"Master Qin! Fairy Liuli!"</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader arrived, a flicker of surprise in his eyes at finding them there.  He exclaimed, "I thought you had already left the Sacred Grounds. This upheaval has driven away many powerful cultivators, even from the most prominent clans."</p><p>"We only dared remain, clinging to hope, after learning that Heart Lake wasn't destroyed by the celestial glow…"  Qin Sang briefly recounted their experiences, swirling the celestial flame in his hand, then questioned, "Why are you all here? Have you encountered difficulties?"</p><p>"I see." The Yuanxiang clan leader nodded. "Come with me, both of you. The situation is rather complicated; we can discuss it later…"</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw a mountain peak ahead—a rootless, severed mountain floating amidst the mist, magically suspended in mid-air. Figures were scattered on it; some huddled together, others meditating in solitude.  Most of them were late-stage cultivators!</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang sensed that similar severed mountains existed elsewhere, forming two distinct camps: the Water and Sky clans. Scattered individuals from other clans were also present, but far too few to matter.</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader led them to a cliff face, where a stone platform jutted out midway. Three people sat on it. Qin Sang recognized two of them—cultivators from the Youming clan, including Yuan Jian.  Qin Sang remained outwardly calm, concealing his killing intent.  He suspected Yuan Jian's collusion with the Celestial Child and sought clues from him. However, the Celestial Child was absent. The third person was a Zhuyan clan master unknown to Qin Sang, but easily identifiable as the Yuanxiang clan leader's seventh brother.</p><p>This was Yuan Ren, the Zhuyan clan's second most powerful cultivator after the clan leader.  He was said to have been unremarkable in his youth, but his name became apt; his relentless dedication to cultivation ultimately surpassed all his peers, leaving only his elder brother above him.</p><p>"That's my seventh brother, Yuan Ren. He arrived at the Sacred Grounds last, so you haven't met him…"  The Yuanxiang clan leader gestured towards Yuan Ren. "Many fought fiercely for the treasures left by our ancestors, sustaining serious injuries. A major conflict is likely, and I can't protect everyone; I've sent them away. Only we two remain." He paused, then earnestly advised, "Fairy Liuli, please be extremely cautious."</p><p>Qin Sang understood why there were far fewer people than expected. Even the Yuanxiang clan leader couldn't guarantee the safety of his people—he and Liuli needed to be careful. Fortunately, he had a Thunder Beast Guard, providing protection for Liuli.</p><p>"I never imagined Master Qin would enter our clan's Sacred Grounds!"</p><p>Yuan Jian opened his eyes, astonishment etched on his face.  He smiled faintly, saying, "It seems you received guidance, Master Qin. You're probably the first outsider to do so. You must be careful; some will resent your achievements. If you excel, causing them to lose face, they'll surely act against you."</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader shook his head. "Several other outsiders arrived on the opposite side, but Elder Yuan's words hold merit."</p><p>"Thank you, Elder Yuan, for your warning!  As a mere mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, I hardly stand a chance amongst so many powerful individuals!" Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>"Master Qin is too humble…" Yuan Jian shook his head slightly, saying nothing more, returning to meditation. He seemed to have awakened only to greet Qin Sang.</p><p>Feigning ignorance, Qin Sang turned to the Yuanxiang clan leader. "We encountered a cultivator undergoing a tribulation a short while ago; they may have achieved Sainthood…"</p><p>"Ah! You're referring to Elder Hongtian." The Yuanxiang clan leader pointed upwards, then switched to voice transmission, "A Saint has appeared on the other side as well. Elder Hongtian has likely clashed with them; it remains unknown who prevailed."</p><p>"This upheaval truly brought countless great opportunities!" Qin Sang exclaimed, "I heard that Elder Hongtian has a conflict with the Feather People."</p><p>The Yuanxiang clan leader sighed, "Even you've heard of it, Master Qin. It's an old grievance. It's hard to determine who's right or wrong. Elder Hongtian left in anger but didn't join the Water Clan. The Feather People never publicly mentioned it either. Perhaps Elder Hongtian has forgiven them, but the Feather People dare not risk it; even now, the Feather King and others remain missing."</p><p>"Who is on the other side? Is it the Mermaid Queen?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Not the Queen, but a powerful Mermaid noble, once favored by the Queen. She's unlikely to experience the same internal strife as we have." The Yuanxiang clan leader shook his head repeatedly, his brow furrowed, pessimistic about the future.</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "My companion and I are still confused.  Why are you all stopped here?"</p><p>A flame flickered in his sleeve; this wasn't their final destination.</p><p>"Master Qin, can't you see the situation? Those two who broke through to the Saint Realm haven't been summoned out of the Sacred Land.  We can only wait for their instructions. They ordered us to remain here and await their orders."</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader mused, "I suspect the Sacred Land might undergo further, unknown changes. Those two are waiting for a specific moment. The long-standing conflict between the Water and Heaven Departments continues; they will settle it here first.  Also, I heard a rumor—those two entered but suffered a significant setback, forcing them to retreat."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. If even powerful cultivators at the Unity Stage were forced back, wouldn't they be facing certain death if they entered?</p><p>"Is that truly the Heart Lake ahead?" Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>"Yes and no!"</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader replied, "It's said that one can see vestiges of the old Heart Lake, but, like the current Sacred Land, it has undergone dramatic changes. Or perhaps this is the true Heart Lake!  However, several of the first arrivals encountered those two near the Heart Lake's periphery and were stopped. What they saw might not be accurate; nobody knows its current state."</p><p>What if the Heart Lake’s transformation damages that hidden realm…?</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged worried glances.</p><p>Qin Sang found an excuse to leave the stone platform with the Yuanxiang Clan leader.  They investigated the area, finding mostly cultivators from major clans and powerful groups. Smaller clans or those with less strength had either left or were content with their gains.</p><p>Dozens of Heaven Department experts had gathered, with more on their way. Everyone awaited the orders of the two Saint Realm cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang keenly sensed that the tension between the Water and Heaven Departments wasn't as sharp as before. These top-tier experts weren't fools; if Saint Realm cultivators intervened, their conflict would be meaningless. Now, everyone, and the past grievances between the two departments, would become pawns in the hands of the two Saint Realm cultivators. They only needed to play their assigned roles.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after a deliberate search, they didn’t find Si Huang or the others; naturally, the young immortal attendant was also absent.</p><p>Away from Yuan Jian's sight, Qin Sang finally asked, "Clan Leader Yuanxiang, have you seen a young immortal attendant...?"</p><p>Qin Sang recounted Si Lu's story.</p><p>Hearing this, the Yuanxiang Clan leader's expression grew serious. "Are you certain that person was the young immortal attendant from the Siyou Clan ancestor's retinue?"</p><p>"He said so himself, and the Grand Attendant's origins are indeed unclear. It seems true. Since he acted without understanding the situation, repeatedly claiming revenge for the Grand Attendant, and Daoist Si Lu nearly perished, how can I stand idly by!"</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was filled with killing intent. His gaze flickered towards the cliff.</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader understood. "Master Qin suspects Elder Yuan and the immortal attendant are collaborating."</p><p>"If no one informed him, how would the immortal attendant know of outside matters?" Qin Sang said. "Clan Leader Yuanxiang, you previously warned me about him."</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader replied, "I did.  I secretly investigated within my clan but found nothing unusual, so I suspected an outsider was involved. Among the major clans, only the Siyou Clan and Elder Yuan could have acted so secretly, but there's no proof. However, my clan has an ancient pact with the Siyou Clan. Even if it were Elder Yuan, I'd be powerless to help."</p><p>"I'll settle my own grudges!"</p><p>Qin Sang never relied on others. His expression turned cold. "But I wonder, can this immortal attendant be killed?"</p><p>"If someone attacks, why wouldn't they be killable! It's unheard of for any ancestor to interfere in Sacred Land disputes and personally avenge their juniors, even their own descendants..."</p><p>The Yuanxiang Clan leader paused, suddenly remembering the two Saint Realm cultivators present. However, these two were newly ascended, unlike those ancient ancestors.</p>
