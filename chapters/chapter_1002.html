<h1>Chapter 994: Seed of the Fire Curse</h1><p>Qin Sang cautiously surveyed the area, then plunged into the depths of the ocean. The source of the light beam was on the seabed.  The seabed wasn't calm either; the storm's power reached down, creating turbulent currents as dangerous as the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang struggled to steady himself and looked towards the source.</p><p>The strange light was blinding.</p><p>Using his Heaven's Eye, Qin Sang saw a large curtain behind the light. Behind the curtain was a desolate land and several ancient temples.</p><p>He scanned the scene behind the curtain and found it lifeless and desolate.</p><p>Everything was visible, with no apparent danger on the surface.</p><p>The curtain itself was the ancient restriction.</p><p>To his surprise, Qin Sang discovered that the curtain was not intact. A corner was shattered, as if the ancient restriction had been broken by brute force.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Qin Sang immediately flew to the curtain.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly fully activated its innate power.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had never seen this type of ancient restriction before, with the help of the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, he slowly analyzed the power of the restriction, eventually finding a way to break it.</p><p>With the previously shattered corner, Qin Sang was quite confident he could break through.</p><p>He didn't act rashly. After waiting for a while and confirming there were no hidden dangers behind the curtain, he began to break the restriction.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>Six demonic banners formed an array. Nine Nether Demonic Fire transformed into a fire spear, fiercely thrusting towards the corner of the ancient restriction.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The curtain remained motionless.</p><p>The light beam only rippled slightly.</p><p>But something changed where the fire spear hit.</p><p>There were already cracks there. The fire spear precisely hit one of the cracks, immediately causing that part of the curtain to emit a brighter light, with frequent anomalies appearing.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly spread its wings wide, a pair of real Heaven's Eyes materialized on its wings, staring intently at the curtain.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang rapidly changed hand seals, sending streams of restrictive spells into the curtain.</p><p>The first few attempts failed.</p><p>After repeated adjustments, Qin Sang finally succeeded.</p><p>The cracks in the corner of the curtain suddenly dimmed. Qin Sang's figure flashed, successfully passing through the crack and entering the area behind the curtain.</p><p>The space here wasn't large.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his spirit sword and demonic banners for protection, quickly circling the area.  He arrived in front of the temples and found traces of the restrictions here also being broken.</p><p>"Empty!" Bai suddenly spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with joy. "Fellow Daoist, you've recovered?"</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Pouch and nodded. "By tomorrow, I should be able to barely break the Fire Curse."</p><p>He looked around. "I didn't expect Fellow Daoist to find this secret realm! However, these restrictions seem to have been broken by someone and have been visited long ago..."</p><p>"Countless powerful predecessors from both the Human and Witch Tribes must have explored the Storm Belt. It's normal for it to have been visited before. As long as it's safe enough to shelter us for a while, I'll be satisfied. Since the escape began, my physical and mental strength have been almost completely depleted, and I've been relying solely on willpower."</p><p>Qin Sang said with a sigh, his tone revealing deep fatigue.</p><p>"I haven't had the chance to thank you, Fellow Daoist! Without your help, I would already be dead."  Qin Sang bowed sincerely in gratitude.</p><p>Bai looked deeply at Qin Sang. "Being able to find a glimmer of hope in a desperate situation and escape from a Nascent Soul enemy is mostly due to your own efforts, Fellow Daoist! If it were anyone else, even with me, they would only await death."</p><p>After a brief discussion, they each chose a temple and focused on recuperating.</p><p>Qin Sang desperately wanted to sleep, but it wasn't the time.</p><p>He sat down in meditation, his mind and soul merging.</p><p>Several hours later, Qin Sang recovered some of his energy and walked out of the temple, looking up at the curtain above.</p><p>The anomalies of the ancient restriction were too conspicuous.</p><p>Qin Sang flew close to the curtain and studied it for a long time. Finally, he found a way to conceal the light beam anomaly and strengthened the damaged part of the curtain as much as possible.</p><p>By the time he was finished, Bai had been waiting for a while.</p><p>Inside the temple, Qin Sang summoned the Demonic Fire.</p><p>He had learned the Demonic Fire Curse Seal technique from Bai, and together they worked to break the Fire Curse.</p><p>Bai's target was Qin Sang's limbs, while Qin Sang himself dealt with the Fire Curse deep within his internal organs and Purple Mansion.</p><p>It seemed Old Devil Mu had given up, as the Fire Curse remained inactive.</p><p>Although the process of breaking the Fire Curse was slow, it progressed smoothly.</p><p>During a break, Qin Sang pondered for a long time, then suddenly said to Bai, "How about leaving one Fire Curse behind, using it to track Old Devil Mu's location or lure him here?"</p><p>Bai was stunned. "You don't mean..."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. "I suspect Old Devil Mu might still be looking for me."</p><p>"I underestimated you. To say you're audacious is an understatement!"</p><p>Bai shook his head repeatedly. "If Old Devil Mu were only at the early stage of Nascent Soul, you might have a one in ten chance with your powerful lightning technique. But a cunning old fox like Old Devil Mu wouldn't easily put himself in danger. If he dares to stay in the Storm Belt, it's certain he has a trump card to save his life, or even counterattack. Even if we wait for him, fully recovered, it will be difficult to gain an advantage against him."</p><p>"Don't worry, Fellow Daoist, I'm just thinking..." Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He understood this reasoning.</p><p>The difference in their strength was too great for schemes to be effective.</p><p>"However..." Bai's tone suddenly shifted, as if lost in thought. "What you said reminded me of something. Curse techniques are double-edged swords. I can try to tamper with the Fire Curse, leaving behind a Fire Curse Seed. In the future, when your strength surpasses his, it might be possible to hunt down Old Devil Mu."</p><p>After a slight pause, Bai looked at Qin Sang. "If the Winter Nether Cold Flame is truly as powerful as you say, after subduing it, Old Devil Mu's strength will likely surpass his peers, second only to late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators.  It will be very difficult for you to seek revenge... If you think the chance is slim, it's better to let go of the thought, lest it becomes a heart demon."</p><p>Qin Sang was silent.</p><p>Even if Old Devil Mu stopped progressing, he didn't know when he would be able to break through to the mid-stage Nascent Soul, and by then he might have already left the Canglang Sea.</p><p>If Old Devil Mu became a Grand Cultivator, revenge would be even more distant.</p><p>Being pursued by Old Devil Mu, Qin Sang had suffered heavy losses.</p><p>He had very few top-grade spirit stones left, and his丹药were almost depleted.</p><p>In addition, his avatar self-destructing and losing his Twin-Headed Serpent was like losing both arms, greatly diminishing his strength.</p><p>Refining a new avatar would take at least several decades.  Capturing other demonic beasts wouldn't compare to the spirituality and strength of the Twin-Headed Serpent.</p><p>What pained Qin Sang the most was using three drops of Three Lights Jade Liquid!</p><p>It was hard to swallow this resentment, but he had to.</p><p>He had to endure and bide his time!</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled and resolutely said, "Please, Fellow Daoist, leave the Fire Curse Seed! I've experienced many ups and downs along the way, and similar things have happened before. I won't easily develop a heart demon."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Bai said in a deep voice, "Condensing a Fire Curse Seed and ensuring Old Devil Mu doesn't detect it requires careful consideration."</p>
