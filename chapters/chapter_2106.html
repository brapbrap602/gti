<h1>Chapter 2097:  Display of Power</h1><p>Si Lu and Min Zhuo faced off high in the sky.</p><p>The demon cultivators below, having narrowly escaped, were still shaken.  However, being elite forces, they quickly recovered from their initial panic and, centered around the Phoenix King, managed to form a makeshift battle formation. They were caught between the giant dragon and the crimson bird.</p><p>The dragon's tail trailed across the water's surface like undulating mountains, disappearing into the distance. Its body stretched skyward, its head lost in the clouds, creating an overwhelming sense of pressure.</p><p>In contrast, the crimson bird was small and seemingly weak, yet it held the dragon at bay.</p><p>The Phoenix King was equally shocked.  Maintaining a calm facade, she had guessed from their earlier exchange that the attacker was Min Zhuo, the clan leader of the Changyou.  They had never anticipated Min Zhuo's swift breakthrough to the second stage of the Void Realm.</p><p>This shift in power was nothing short of a catastrophic blow to the Storm Realm.</p><p>If it weren't for the intervention of a mysterious figure, countless more demon cultivators would have perished that day.</p><p>But where did this mysterious figure come from?</p><p>Why did they stop Min Zhuo and save them? And who was the "main person" they mentioned?</p><p>The Phoenix King felt a chill run down her spine.  She stood at the pinnacle of the Storm Realm, yet how many secrets remained hidden, even from her?</p><p>Could it be that the Glass Fairy had also broken through to the Refinement Void stage and was observing the demon clan's every move?</p><p>She couldn't think of any other possibility.</p><p>Suppressing her anxiety, she left the treasure ship, flew into the air, and prostrated herself before the crimson bird. "Junior Phoenix Jun respectfully thanks the senior for your aid in stopping the enemy."</p><p>Approaching the bird, the Phoenix King's unease intensified. She had assumed it was an elder demon, but it emanated no demonic energy.</p><p>"You are the Phoenix King?"</p><p>The crimson bird surveyed the Phoenix King, calmly commenting, "Misfortune and good fortune are self-made."</p><p>The Phoenix King stiffened, speechless.</p><p>"Don't thank me. I didn't act for your sake."</p><p>The crimson bird fixed its gaze on the dragon opposite, its expression wary.  It commanded, "What follows is none of your concern. Take your forces and retreat to the sidelines. Await further instructions."</p><p>The Phoenix King dared not argue or leave without permission.  She sullenly retreated to the sea, leading her army away from the clash of the powerful beings, waiting patiently in the distance.</p><p>Min Zhuo looked down at the retreating demon cultivators, without attacking. "It seems you are determined to oppose me.  We have no quarrel, why would you stand against me?"</p><p>"If you could restrain yourself for a while, I would not attack you either," the crimson bird said calmly.</p><p>Min Zhuo's expression shifted between anger and uncertainty. He coldly snorted, "I wonder who the 'main person' you speak of is, their identity, and what reason they have to interfere in our conflict?"</p><p>Before Si Lu could respond, Min Zhuo continued, "Do you know that the feud between our clan and these outsiders has lasted nearly a thousand years? Countless members have fallen in battle, countless gifted youngsters cruelly murdered.  A blood feud, an irreconcilable hatred!  Can your few words resolve that?"</p><p>The crimson bird said curiously, "After all I've said, you still don't understand?  Your feud is none of my concern.  As long as you don't attack before me, I will not stop you."</p><p>Min Zhuo laughed angrily, the dragon roaring in agreement.</p><p>The dragon's roar shook the heavens and earth. Some of the demon cultivators felt their minds tremble at the sound.</p><p>Seeing Min Zhuo poised to attack, the crimson bird's gaze sharpened.  It warned in a cold voice,  "Your aura is slightly unstable.  You must have only recently broken through, your cultivation not yet fully solidified. You are no match for me; don't court disaster."</p><p>Min Zhuo grunted, his face changing repeatedly, seemingly weighing his options.</p><p>After a long pause, he feigned surprise as if just recognizing Si Lu's identity.  "Could this be the legendary companion beast? You are from the Si You clan?"</p><p>"You have sharp eyes. I am indeed of the Si You clan," Si Lu readily admitted.</p><p>"Since you are a Si You master, surely you know that our superior clan is the Zhu Yan, and this is Zhu Yan territory! You trespass on another clan's land, without restraint, are you not afraid of provoking the Zhu Yan?" Min Zhuo's voice carried an implicit threat.</p><p>"Thank you for your concern. However, since I am here, it is with the Zhu Yan's permission," the crimson bird said nonchalantly, completely unfazed by the threat.</p><p>…</p><p>On Spirit Island.</p><p>Si Lu remotely controlled his companion beast, their minds linked, intimidating Min Zhuo.  At that moment, he suddenly opened his eyes, looking towards the sky, and waved his hand, opening a circular mirror seal. A person entered.</p><p>"Qin…"</p><p>Si Lu focused on controlling her companion beast, remaining seated. She nodded to Qin Sang and asked, "Your Dharma body?"</p><p>She hadn't sensed the aura of Qin Sang's Dharma body; only his main body was present.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>The Black Lion Saint and two demon lords bowed together.</p><p>"My Dharma body has gone to Sheng Mu Plain," Qin Sang said, gracefully landing.</p><p>"Sheng Mu Plain?" Si Lu recalled where Sheng Mu Plain was and was rather surprised. "Brother Qin intends to…"</p><p>"It's a precautionary measure!"</p><p>Qin Sang sent his Dharma body to the Chang You clan's sacred lake. If negotiations failed, he would resort to force, aiming to capture the Chang You clan leader and control the sacred lake simultaneously.</p><p>It was unknown how the Chang You clan would seek outside aid—through divine abilities or some artifact. If it was an artifact, and not on the clan leader, it would be in the sacred lake.</p><p>The Dharma body also took the Sky-Eye Butterfly, hoping to use its divine ability to locate weaknesses in the sacred lake's protective formation.</p><p>Successfully seizing and secretly controlling the Chang You clan would be a lasting solution.</p><p>However, the sacred grounds of the Yi Ren race were not easily conquered. Qin Sang had consulted Si Lu and Ji Hong. The sacred grounds of each Yi Ren tribe were their most important and mysterious places, originating from ancient times.</p><p>Even a small clan like the Chang You, their sacred ground was no simple matter; it might hold unknown secrets, only revealed during a crisis.</p><p>A rash attack, even if they had the strength to break through, would be hard to keep secret. Due to the ancient pact, the Zhu Yan clan, upon learning of an attack, would inevitably intervene!</p><p>The situation had taken a sharp turn. Qin Sang, even knowing the chances were slim, had to try if necessary.</p><p>"What was that person's reaction upon seeing you?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"He was eager to fight, even wanting to engage me. Even after I revealed Brother Qin's presence, he showed no fear or hesitation," Si Lu said, puzzled.</p><p>This deviated from their expectations.</p><p>The Chang You clan leader had only recently broken through. Dealing with a peer was already difficult; knowing his opponent had help, he didn't choose to retreat and observe.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, saying gravely, "It seems this person has backing."</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "That must be so! However, the Chang You clan seems proficient in water-elemental illusion techniques. That might not be his true form; it might be a bluff, with his true body having fled."</p><p>Companion beasts, after all, aren't the same as the main body, and are subject to limitations. Si Lu wasn't sure if that was the clan leader's true form or a clone.</p><p>Qin Sang said, "Makes sense. I'll go meet him! However, I have another matter to ask you about. You previously mentioned something about an ancient pact; could you elaborate?"</p><p>Si Lu answered completely.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang flew into the air, leaving the island with Si Lu.</p><p>Approaching the battlefield, Qin Sang and Si Lu parted ways. He found a spot, a green light rose above his head, his Qingluan Dharma form spread its wings, transforming into lightning, breaking through the air. The thunder shook the sea, making no attempt to conceal his thunder escape technique.</p><p>Soon, the Qingluan Dharma form neared the battlefield. Min Zhuo vaguely sensed an incredibly powerful aura rushing towards him.</p><p>Min Zhuo looked up sharply.  "Is this the person you spoke of?"</p><p>"It is I!"</p><p>The voice boomed like thunder.</p><p>The next moment, lightning tore through the sky. Min Zhuo's vision was filled with blinding light; his eyes stung, and an overwhelmingly powerful force rapidly approached.</p><p>The force was terrifying, making Min Zhuo's heart pound.</p><p>After breaking through to the second stage of the Sky Realm, he hadn't fought a peer at full strength, but he was certain an ordinary early second stage Sky Realm cultivator wouldn't compare to this person.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Thunder seemed to pierce the void. Min Zhuo's face changed; he felt danger imminent.</p><p>He hadn't expected the other party to attack without warning. Fortunately, he remained vigilant and reacted quickly, immediately summoning a giant dragon for protection.</p><p>Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger.</p><p>The dragon churned the seawater, torrential rain poured down, and amidst the rain, the dragon soared, immediately clashing with the lightning.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Brilliant lightning erupted, and in the void, electric snakes shot in all directions.</p><p>In mid-air, the dragon's body stiffened, its head straining upwards, attempting to block its enemy.</p><p>In the center of its two horns, a giant bird's claw appeared, sharp and firmly embedded in the dragon's flesh, lightning flowing between its talons.</p><p>With a deafening 'boom', the dragon's head exploded. The dragon's body was composed of seawater; its head turned into droplets of water, with traces of lightning within.</p><p>With the head's explosion, the body disintegrated, the rain intensifying, as if the Celestial River was pouring onto the earth.</p><p>Min Zhuo grunted, reeling backward in disarray.  His eyes widened in shock; a newly mastered ability had been shattered with a single claw!</p><p>The disparity between cultivators of the same level can be unimaginable.</p><p>Amidst the storm, the owner of the claw slowly revealed itself: a magnificent azure bird stood proudly in the air, looking down at Min Zhuo with disdain.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised, for he discovered that Min Zhuo was not using an avatar, but his true form!</p><p>The fundamental cultivation of the  Yi people relies on ancestral, inherited abilities. However, achieving the Saint and Ancestor realms—returning to the origin—is not a simple task. It requires cultivation methods to enhance oneself. Unlike humans, their goal is to understand their innate abilities, viewing the methods as vehicles and steps towards that goal.</p><p>Ultimately, it all boils down to cultivating the primordial spirit, refining the body, and cultivating spiritual energy—the three veins of spirit, technique, and body. Based on Qin Sang's understanding of the Changyou clan, they should be considered technique cultivators, while the Zhuyan clan are undoubtedly body cultivators.</p><p>However, because the strength and abilities of the Yi people are inextricably linked to their bloodline, some, even if technique cultivators, cannot independently separate a spiritual body to fight; otherwise, their strength will be significantly reduced.</p><p>Of course, some clans have found alternative methods. For example, Si Lu's four companion beasts are even stronger than a spiritual body.</p><p>Qin Sang had never seen a second Changyou cultivator at the Empty Realm Second Stage, and he wasn't sure if the Changyou clan faced this limitation.</p><p>Min Zhuo's daring use of his true form was illogical.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something amiss; it would be wise to have the true form hidden and send a spiritual body.</p><p>"Who are you?!"</p><p>Min Zhuo steadied himself, unfazed, and loudly demanded.</p><p>"Don't you recognize me?"</p><p>The azure bird's spiritual body spoke, its voice like thunder.  Lightning flashed in its eyes, and blue light erupted, transforming into Qin Sang's image.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's face, Min Zhuo was puzzled. The other's tone implied he should recognize him.</p><p>But…</p><p>Min Zhuo suddenly remembered a confidential report from long ago, and Qin Sang's features seemed familiar.</p><p>"You are…"</p><p>Min Zhuo remembered.</p><p>The sacred statue enshrined in Qingyang Temple, hailed as a saint and revered by various clans and sects, and supposedly close to the Glass Fairy—it was this person!</p><p>"It seems you remember! It is indeed I!"</p><p>Qin Sang said coldly, "You claim to have a blood feud with us, with countless Changyou masters dead, and countless of our masters slaughtered by you!  Though I have the power to destroy the Changyou clan, I didn't want to escalate the conflict and haven't interfered.  You broke through to Empty Realm Second Stage, making us peers, yet you disregarded your status and hastily came out, bullying the weak and slaughtering countless of my fellow cultivators in the Demon Sea!"</p><p>His voice was filled with fury, "You just said it was a blood feud, and killing you was just. Since that’s the case, killing you is justified!"</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense! That Qin Saint is human, you are a demon…"</p><p>For some reason, even knowing Zai Zhen was behind him, Min Zhuo felt a flicker of panic and hastily argued.</p><p>At this point, he paused abruptly.</p><p>Hailed as the Qin Saint, enshrined in Qingyang Temple—does that make him human?</p><p>After all, Qingyang Temple used to have many powerful demon cultivators, once occupying half of the temple, but were supposedly wiped out by a fog tide, leaving only a raccoon demon.</p><p>Min Zhuo believed the other was using a false identity for legitimacy but found it hard to expose him.</p><p>His mind raced, about to speak, when a sudden ominous feeling struck him.  A blinding blue light bore down upon him.</p><p>Seeing the other attack again without a word, Min Zhuo was inwardly alarmed. A milky white light shot from his sleeve—an exquisite jade bowl.</p><p>This was a spiritual treasure bestowed by that mysterious being.  The bowl’s clear water shimmered, full to the brim.</p><p>Min Zhuo summoned the bowl, pouring out endless water, enough to fill several large lakes, transforming into a raging torrent.</p><p>Just then, Min Zhuo caught a glimpse of blazing red fire in his peripheral vision and sensed a stagnation in the water.  The Siyou cultivator had also attacked!</p><p>The opponent clearly intended to kill him!</p><p>Already struggling with one opponent, facing a two-pronged attack meant certain defeat!</p><p>In this critical moment, Min Zhuo no longer cared about any agreements, shouting, "Brother Zai, save me!"</p><p>"Alas!"</p><p>A sigh echoed through the void, and a figure appeared beside Min Zhuo.</p>
