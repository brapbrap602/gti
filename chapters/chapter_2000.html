<h1>Chapter 1991: The Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation</h1><p>Returning to the Treasure Courtyard, Qin Sang took stock of his possessions.  If he wanted to gain anything from the auction and trade fair, he would inevitably have to tap into his previous hoard.</p><p>The Ji Tian Assembly would commence in ten days.</p><p>On the third day, the first auction on Spirit Treasure Peak began.</p><p>A steward had already delivered the invitation slip to the Treasure Courtyard, and Qin Sang, accompanied by Tai Yi and Yu Lang, arrived as scheduled.</p><p>The auction itself was uneventful, and the treasures presented as the grand finale hardly caught Qin Sang's eye.</p><p>Nevertheless, he made two bids, acquiring two treasures, both intended for Tai Yi and Yu Lang.</p><p>As for himself, he bought nothing.</p><p>On the seventh day, at the second auction, Qin Sang arrived at the last minute, watched for a while, and then left, his interest waning.</p><p>Until the ninth night.</p><p>The hour of Zi (11 PM - 1 AM).</p><p>The Treasure Courtyard's restrictive formations were triggered, and Qin Sang personally went out to greet Gu Yun Sou, who stood outside.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist must have reaped quite a harvest these past few days," Gu Yun Sou said with a smile.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou had been busy with matters related to the Ji Tian Assembly and the Small Cave Heaven, and during these days, he had only met with Qin Sang once.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang sigh, Gu Yun Sou let out a hearty laugh.</p><p>He also knew that those ordinary merchants and public auctions could hardly offer much assistance to a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>Those people might lack sufficient cultivation, but their discerning eyes were sharp.  Each one possessed a keen eye for treasures; there weren't that many overlooked gems to be found.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, follow me.  I guarantee you’ll be satisfied tonight!” Gu Yun Sou gestured for Qin Sang to follow him.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he quickly caught up. “Is the trade fair tonight?”</p><p>“Indeed.  There are a few smaller gatherings afterward, but none compare to this trade fair in terms of comprehensiveness and opportunities. Moreover, the host always arranges things meticulously, so there's not much to worry about.”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou nodded in explanation.</p><p>The trade fair among Void Refinement cultivators was typically held the day before or the first day of the Ji Tian Assembly; it had become a customary practice.</p><p>This time, it was scheduled before the Ji Tian Assembly.</p><p>Tonight, essentially all the factions that could arrive were already present.</p><p>From what Gu Yun Sou implied, this trade fair was the most renowned, and most Void Refinement cultivators attending the Ji Tian Assembly would participate in this trade fair, making it a smaller-scale Ji Tian Assembly of its own.</p><p>The two walked side by side down the mountain, then ascended a vine bridge, traversing it at a leisurely pace.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou explained the procedures of the trade fair to Qin Sang.</p><p>Although it was the middle of the night, the city wasn't completely dark.</p><p>The blossoms of the vines served as light sources, emitting a faint glow, scattered among the peaks like thousands upon thousands of flower lanterns.</p><p>They couldn't illuminate every corner, but they added a touch of serene elegance.</p><p>Many cultivators enjoyed this ambiance, specifically venturing out of their caves at this time to admire the beautiful night scenery.</p><p>From time to time, people passed by on the vine bridge.  After walking for a while, Gu Yun Sou gently waved his sleeve, casting a spell to conceal their figures.</p><p>They continued to walk and chat, but others could no longer see them.</p><p>Finally, Gu Yun Sou led Qin Sang to an unnamed mountain peak.  They circled the mountain halfway and arrived before a cliff face.</p><p>The stones on the cliff face were jagged and uneven, with three vine bridges clinging to the wall, one above the other.</p><p>They ascended the middle one.  Gu Yun Sou counted the flower lanterns on the vine bridge, and upon reaching the ninth, he softly said, “Here it is.”</p><p>As he spoke, he lightly tapped the flower lantern.</p><p>The lantern trembled slightly, and a languid voice emerged from within.</p><p>“Ah woo!”</p><p>The petals parted, revealing an infant, like a flower spirit slumbering within the blossom's heart, just awakened and stretching languidly.</p><p>The infant was smaller than a fist, exquisitely delicate, fair and tender, utterly adorable.  It wore a large red bellyband, barely covering its private parts, inadvertently exposing its little bird as it stretched.</p><p>The infant, completely unaware of its exposure, opened its sleepy eyes.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou retrieved a jade pendant from his sleeve and held it to the infant's mouth.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The infant’s eyes lit up, and it swallowed the jade pendant in one gulp, chewing with a loud crunch, the sound crisp and sweet.</p><p>After swallowing the pendant, the infant widened its eyes, looked at Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou, then crawled back into the flower's heart using both hands and feet.  Immediately afterward, the petals abruptly opened wide, like a large mouth, swallowing Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou.</p><p>Having been forewarned by Gu Yun Sou, Qin Sang offered no resistance.  He only felt himself falling into darkness, surrounded by nothingness, unaware of where he was being taken.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but glance back. The area behind was shrouded in darkness; the infant was gone.  He couldn't help but marvel inwardly.</p><p>Just now, he had carefully observed the infant but couldn't discern its origin.  It didn't resemble a flower spirit; he didn't know what kind of creature it was.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou, noticing Qin Sang's action, transmitted his voice: "Fellow Daoist, there's no need to look. I've seen this kind of Flower Infant before, and to this day, I still don't know its origins. It must be a special creature reared by the host, certainly possessing some unique divine ability to prevent anyone from causing trouble at the trade fair."</p><p>Since even Gu Yun Sou couldn't discern its origin, Qin Sang no longer bothered, thinking to himself that this host was quite mysterious.</p><p>As they conversed, the surrounding environment changed again.  Faint light dispersed the darkness, and a light mist rose around them. The ground beneath their feet felt soft, as if they were riding on clouds and mist.</p><p>The space was initially empty, then light flickered, and two pairs of stone tables and chairs appeared ahead.</p><p>On each stone table was a stone plate.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou invited Qin Sang to sit, then took out a longan-sized jade pearl and placed it on the stone plate.</p><p>"To participate in the trade fair, each person must contribute a spirit treasure in exchange for a seat."</p><p>The entrance fee being a spirit treasure was astonishing.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no other requirements. As long as it was of spirit treasure quality, it didn't matter if there was a Treasure Recognition Formula, and the host wouldn't take a commission, which was acceptable.</p><p>These past few days, Qin Sang had inquired about some of the rules.</p><p>Although spirit treasures were rare, over countless years, some effective trading methods had been established.</p><p>In Mooncry Bay, there were people who purchased spirit treasures that had lost their masters and lacked Treasure Recognition Formulas, though their value was significantly discounted.</p><p>In addition, there were merchants who sold spirit treasures on consignment, but it could take a long time to find a suitable buyer.</p><p>And then there were these trade fairs among Void Refinement cultivators.</p><p>Upon reaching the Void Refinement realm, their divine abilities far surpassed those of Nascent Soul and Deity Transformation cultivators.  They weren't as helpless with spirit treasures lacking Treasure Recognition Formulas as before.</p><p>In the vast world, secret techniques specifically targeting spirit treasures had emerged, but these techniques weren't common, and their execution often required various conditions.  Subduing spirit treasures was no easy task.</p><p>Sometimes, expending too much effort to subdue a spirit treasure wasn't necessarily worthwhile.</p><p>Like Qin Sang, after slaying Patriarch Ming Hu and seizing several spirit treasures, he hadn't considered subduing them, preferring to refine his own from scratch, which would be more compatible with him.</p><p>Conversely, spirit treasures with similar Daos and matching divine abilities were easier to subdue.</p><p>Cultivators often chose these types of spirit treasures, and this was also a kind of 'fate'.</p><p>If such a spirit treasure appeared at this trade fair, Qin Sang would make a bid.</p><p>Hearing Gu Yun Sou's explanation, Qin Sang selected a pair of phoenix-shaped earrings and placed them on the stone plate.</p><p>This treasure was called the Twin Phoenix Earrings, a relic of the Black Roc Demon Peng.</p><p>Qin Sang had effectively obtained the relics of two Void Refinement cultivators.  Besides the spirit treasures they commonly used, there were also a few they had seized from their enemies, varying in quality.</p><p>The Twin Phoenix Earrings were among the lowest tier.</p><p>Once the spirit treasure was placed, the stone plate floated up on its own and disappeared into the depths of the mist.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang noticed several faint glows appearing within the mist.</p><p>Within the spheres of light, human figures seemed visible, yet also appeared miles away, impossible to see clearly, quite peculiar.</p><p>More and more spheres of light appeared.</p><p>Those were the cultivators participating in the trade fair, and the trade fair took place in this environment.</p><p>Being in Mooncry Bay, the Void Refinement cultivators had more or less heard of each other's names and knew of each other's deeds.</p><p>Some might wonder why they didn't sit together openly.  This arrangement might seem unnecessarily mysterious.</p><p>Those who understood the dynamics of the cultivation world knew that this arrangement prevented direct conflicts between righteous and demonic cultivators, and some illicit treasures could also be traded here.</p><p>The premise was that the host remained impartial.</p><p>"The Ji Tian Sect has put in considerable effort," Qin Sang remarked with emotion.</p><p>"Does Fellow Daoist also believe the host is the Ji Tian Sect?" Gu Yun Sou inquired.</p><p>"If not the Ji Tian Sect, then who else?  However, even with this arrangement, it can't eliminate everyone's concerns," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>“In so many assemblies, aside from those who voluntarily revealed their identities, I haven't heard of anyone's identity being leaked or suffering unwarranted retaliation from the Ji Tian Sect," Gu Yun Sou transmitted his voice.</p><p>As they spoke, the number of glowing spheres in the mist increased.</p><p>There were no attendants here, no spirit tea or immortal fruits.  Everyone waited patiently.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes and rested, waiting for the time it took to burn an incense stick.  Suddenly, he sensed a ripple in the mist.</p><p>"Ahem!"</p><p>An aged voice resounded, "Almost everyone is here. Most of the fellow Daoists present are not first-time participants in this fair.  To the newcomers, I extend a welcome. The rules are simple and require no elaboration.  Fellow Daoists will take turns speaking, displaying their treasures, and stating their requests.  Those interested in trading will then make contact.  As for whether you trade on the spot, make a private agreement, or trade outside, that is none of my concern..."</p><p>"However, there is one point.  Here, we only consider the value of the treasures, regardless of the stories behind them or any grudges you may hold. I do not wish to see any conflicts arise here.  Of course, since the inception of this trade fair, there have never been any conflicts."</p><p>The tone remained calm throughout, but when everyone heard the last sentence, they couldn't help but feel a chill down their spines.</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously straightened his posture, searching fruitlessly for the source of the voice, as if it came from all directions.</p><p>After some thought, he abandoned the idea of awakening the Heaven's Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The host paused briefly, then asked, "Which Fellow Daoist would like to begin?"</p><p>"I'll go first."</p><p>A hoarse voice emerged from one of the spheres of light.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou shook his head at Qin Sang, indicating he couldn't discern the speaker's identity.</p><p>The sphere of light brightened slightly, and three streaks of light flew out, hovering amidst the numerous spheres, revealing a saber, a long flute, and a pair of bronze gongs, all clearly visible.</p><p>"These three spirit treasures, only the Featherborn Flute has a Treasure Recognition Formula.  Any Fellow Daoist interested can exchange them with another spirit treasure."</p><p>"In addition, I seek only one item: a piece of Hanhai Bright Jade weighing at least seven liang."</p><p>Before the voice faded, streaks of divine sense swept over the spirit treasures.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was perceiving the properties of these spirit treasures, he heard someone from a nearby sphere of light say, "Hanhai Bright Jade is only produced in the Sunken Jade Sea. It's a second-grade jade on the Sunken Jade Sea's Hundred Jade List, and even there it's rarely found. Seven liang or more is an exceptionally rare treasure. What does Fellow Daoist intend to exchange for it?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at that sphere of light.</p><p>As a Refiner, he naturally focused on inquiring about nearby special materials.</p><p>The Sunken Jade Sea, east of Mooncry Bay, was renowned for producing various spiritual jades, and it had established a Hundred Jade List.</p><p>There were only three first-grade jades on the list.</p><p>There were six second-grade jades, all of which were rare treasures.</p><p>It was said that many Sunken Jade Sea cultivators' cultivation techniques required the use of spiritual jades, making the jades that circulated outside even rarer.</p><p>The person chuckled, "I have many treasures, but it's inconvenient to display them publicly. If Fellow Daoist can produce the Hanhai Bright Jade, I will try my best to meet any conditions."</p><p>Then the two fell silent, likely communicating privately.</p><p>Shortly after, the Featherborn Flute was exchanged for another spirit treasure, while the other two spirit treasures without Treasure Recognition Formulas remained unclaimed.</p><p>There was no further exchange regarding the Hanhai Bright Jade; it was unknown what agreement they had reached.</p><p>Next, the person in the nearby sphere of light spoke.</p><p>"I have a Thousand-Leaf Immortal Sunflower..."</p><p>The trade fair proceeded in an orderly fashion.  All were Void Refinement old monsters, so there was no need for the host to maintain order.</p><p>Qin Sang was intrigued.  He hadn't encountered any spirit treasures that caught his fancy, but he was interested in a few of the spiritual materials.</p><p>However, he needed to prioritize his own cultivation and wasn't in a hurry to trade.</p><p>One by one, it was soon Qin Sang and Gu Yun Sou's turn.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed numerous gazes converging upon him.  With a thought, several streaks of light shot out from the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Each streak of light contained a spirit treasure, including the Everbright Lantern that Patriarch Ming Hu had wielded, known as the Soul-Extinguishing Lantern.</p><p>This was a spirit treasure that Patriarch Ming Hu relied heavily on, ranking among the top tier of the spirit treasures that had appeared today.</p><p>There were two others, no less in quality than the Soul-Extinguishing Lantern, perhaps even surpassing it, which were relics of the Black Roc Demon Peng.</p><p>With the appearance of these three spirit treasures, Gu Yun Sou was slightly moved, further solidifying his resolve to form an alliance with Qin Sang.</p><p>"My request is for a method that can draw upon the power of the stars, gathering starlight and bringing it down to the mortal realm.  It doesn't matter if it's a spirit treasure, spirit formation, spirit talisman, Daoist technique, or even if any Fellow Daoist cultivates such a technique!"</p><p>The appearance of the Soul-Extinguishing Lantern caused a slight stir in the venue, but Qin Sang seemed oblivious as he stated his request in a deep voice.</p><p>After a brief silence, transmitted voices arrived one after another.</p><p>Most inquired about the exchange conditions for these spirit treasures.</p><p>Unfortunately, no one could fulfill Qin Sang's need.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was feeling disappointed, a sharp voice pierced through.</p><p>"Heh heh, that old zombie Ming Hu died at your hands, didn't he?"</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied, replying coldly, "What do you mean by that?  Do you intend to avenge that fiend?"</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>The sharp laughter seemed capable of piercing eardrums.  "That old zombie kicking the bucket makes me happier than anyone.  What I'm interested in is a rather potent secret technique that old zombie possessed.  It should have fallen into your hands, hasn't it?"</p><p>The technique this person referred to must be the *Life and Death Reversal Wheel*, a top-tier secret technique of the Corpse-Ghost Dao, extremely difficult to cultivate.  Despite its formidable power, Qin Sang could only look on with longing.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Yun Sou's eyes flickered as he thought of something.</p><p>"This person should be Old Devil Zhen of Myriad Net Island.  The news of Patriarch Ming Hu obtaining a powerful secret technique after returning from a trip was leaked for no apparent reason.  It was likely spread by Old Devil Zhen.  Now it seems they may have had a struggle over it back then..."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's continued silence, the other party couldn't hold back any longer and took the initiative to say, "I know of a spirit formation called the Heavenly River Reversal Slaughter Formation.  It's a killing formation of the Star Dao, but it's not in my possession.  Give me that secret technique, and I'll help you acquire this formation."</p>
