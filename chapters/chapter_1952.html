<h1>Chapter 1943: Great Ascension</h1><p>“Buns…?”</p><p>The innkeeper’s mouth twitched, his tone changing slightly.</p><p>Thankfully, Qin Sang was a distinguished guest invited by Qingyuan; otherwise, with his temperament, it would have been difficult for him to restrain himself.</p><p>Qingyuan chuckled and shook his head, unsure of what to say.</p><p>The innkeeper fell silent for a moment.  “The Seven Heads Feast includes a dish called ‘Jade Pouch Treasure,’ made with seven precious fish species from the Blue Lake in the capital city.  The fish are combined with mountain delicacies and thinly sliced jade bamboo shoots, forming a jade pouch. It’s a true delicacy. If it doesn't suit the Daoist's palate, we can prepare a separate main course…”</p><p>After deciding on the Seven Heads Feast, the innkeeper went to the kitchen to oversee preparations.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t actually trying to make things difficult for the innkeeper; he wanted to buy some time to consider his next move.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang’s true self stood somewhere, hands clasped behind his back, gazing towards Jian County.</p><p>His expression was unusually serious, mentally running through simulations repeatedly.</p><p>No matter how many times he ran the simulations, the answer remained the same—he couldn't do it!</p><p>He even doubted whether a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator could accomplish it.</p><p>Qin Sang had never truly faced a Nascent Soul cultivator in direct combat, but based on his own deductions, he could estimate their capabilities.</p><p>Before breaking through to a higher realm, there wouldn't be any fundamental transformation.</p><p>Unless Qingyuan possessed unique cultivation techniques or abilities.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lin Baoshan's cultivation base was too low, the gap between him and Qingyuan was like a chasm.  From this single encounter, it was impossible to determine much more.</p><p>If Qingyuan could perform like this against a Divine Transformation cultivator, that would be truly terrifying.  Anyone wielding Daoist techniques in his presence would need to be wary.</p><p>…</p><p>Drunk Fragrance Tower.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to wait and see what Qingyuan’s intentions were.</p><p>Before the main course, cold dishes were served, all made of rare ingredients rarely seen by ordinary people.  The tea was Yan Kingdom tribute tea.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed the maids, keeping Yu Lang to serve tea and Tao Teng to assist.</p><p>Qingyuan took a sip of tea, looking out the window at the endless houses stretching to the city walls.</p><p>The streets below were bustling.</p><p>The cries of street vendors, children's laughter, congratulatory greetings, and even arguments filled the air.</p><p>Firecrackers, drums, and the rhythmic thumping of clappers…</p><p>After Lin Baoshan left, Qin Sang removed the restrictions, and all the sounds flooded into the private room, creating a lively atmosphere.</p><p>“It's truly a time of celebration for the people.”</p><p>Qingyuan seemed touched, sighing softly.  “Daoist, did you find the mountain too lonely when you came down?”</p><p>“We cultivators must endure solitude. I have other reasons for descending the mountain, and it hasn't been long.”</p><p>Qin Sang was telling the truth, but he omitted crucial information.</p><p>He turned to Qingyuan, “Daoist friend, have you been traveling around?”</p><p>“Indeed, I enjoy good food and drink. Each region has its own unique characteristics, and even after seeing so much, I always encounter surprises.”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled slightly, then quickly composed himself. “Unfortunately, not every place is as prosperous as Yan Kingdom, with its people living in peace and contentment. Even within Yan Kingdom, it’s not all joy; the world is always full of sorrow, joy, hardship, and suffering.”</p><p>“Is it just the human world? The sea of suffering is vast; how many can be saved?”</p><p>Since Qingyuan was so talkative, Qin Sang put aside his thoughts and echoed his sentiment.</p><p>This sigh came from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>If ascension to immortality could free one from suffering, but looking at the entire vast world, how many have successfully ascended?</p><p>Each realm is a hurdle, blocking countless people.</p><p>“You and I are stronger than most.”</p><p>Qingyuan pointed at Qin Sang, then at himself, suddenly turning to Yu Lang and Tao Teng, who had been listening quietly.</p><p>“You are both scholars, who study the writings of sages. People often speak of humanity, humanity… what exactly is the path of humanity?”</p><p>Yu Lang and Tao Teng hadn't expected Qingyuan to address them, and were taken aback.</p><p>At that moment, they felt an inexplicable pressure, greater than when called upon by their master, causing them to sit up straight.</p><p>Yu Lang furrowed his brow, deep in thought.</p><p>After waiting a while, seeing his companion silent, Tao Teng, emboldened, replied, “The relationship between father and son, the loyalty between ruler and subject, the distinction between husband and wife, the order of seniority, the trust between friends.”</p><p>Qingyuan said, “This is the way of human relationships, which can benefit the country.”</p><p>Tao Teng didn't receive praise, and scratched his head. After thinking for a while, he recited,  “When the Great Way prevails in the world, all under Heaven is shared equally; the worthy are selected and talented people are employed; honesty and harmony are cultivated. Therefore, people do not only love their own parents, do not only love their own children. The old have sustenance in their old age, the strong find work, and the young are cared for; the widowed, orphaned, lonely, disabled, and sick are all provided for…”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled without speaking, looking at Yu Lang, “Little Daoist, it seems you have a different opinion?”</p><p>Yu Lang looked at his master, then at his companion.</p><p>In this room, only Tao Teng was a mortal.</p><p>He hesitated, not answering, but instead asking a question: "Are mortals destined only to be slaughtered like fish?"</p><p>Tao Teng's words, without outside interference, naturally described the most ideal world imaginable.</p><p>But the world contains not only humans, but also immortals, gods, demons, and monsters.</p><p>Mortals without extraordinary powers are like pigs and dogs, at the mercy of others.</p><p>Even if the mortal realm truly achieved the Great Harmony spoken of by sages, without the ability to protect themselves, it would be like a flower in a mirror, a moon in water.</p><p>For example, Jien County, without the protection of Yu Cheng Huang and other deities, could the city enjoy such peace and tranquility today?</p><p>Can this kind of human path be considered the Great Dao?</p><p>Tao Teng stared blankly at Yu Lang, somewhat confused. He couldn't understand the deep meaning of this question.</p><p>Qing Yuan's eyes lit up, and he laughed heartily, "At such a young age, to think of these things, and it seems you've truly pondered them – it's quite remarkable. Your master has taught you well. This question perfectly aligns with the concepts of Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism in the world."</p><p>Having said this, Qing Yuan suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Then, a knock came on the private room door.</p><p>"Come in," said Qing Yuan.</p><p>A man dressed as a servant gently pushed open the door, bowing first to the main seat, "Greetings to both gentlemen."</p><p>He then turned to Tao Teng, "Young Master, it's getting late.  It's time to leave. Father has sent me to call you down."</p><p>"I..."</p><p>Tao Teng looked reluctant.  He not only didn't want to leave his friends, but he also wanted to hear more of this gentleman's profound insights.</p><p>His intuition told him that this gentleman, like Qingfeng Daoist, was a master.</p><p>But the servant lacked tact, urging, "Young Master, your father is waiting downstairs."</p><p>"Sigh!"</p><p>Tao Teng had no choice but to stand up with a long sigh, gripping Yu Lang's hand tightly, "Yu Lang, you must come to the capital to find me someday!"</p><p>Then he bowed to Qin Sang and Qing Yuan, reluctantly following the servant away.</p><p>"Mahayana, Hinayana..."</p><p>The true self and the manifestation at the Drunk Fragrance Tower were both momentarily lost in thought, repeating these two words in their hearts.</p><p>Vaguely, it felt like he had grasped something.</p><p>"This Mahayana is not that Mahayana, but there should be a connection."</p><p>Qing Yuan glanced at Qin Sang and continued, "Hinayana and Mahayana, they differ only in their pursuit, not in their superiority or inferiority. To put it simply, Hinayana cultivates oneself, while Mahayana cultivates others!"</p><p>Cultivate oneself!</p><p>Cultivate others!</p><p>In Qin Sang's mind, it was as if a lightning bolt had struck, instantly illuminating many of his previous doubts.</p><p>The path of Hinayana, cultivating oneself, reaching the ultimate point wouldn't that be ascension and transcendence?</p><p>And the ultimate of the Mahayana path?</p><p>This world contains not only humans, but also demons, witches, all living beings, and even the entire vast world.</p><p>Could it be, to cultivate this heaven and earth with oneself?</p><p>"The Divine Dao..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>He had always had doubts about the Divine Dao.</p><p>Especially since he knew the origins of the Divine Dao, possibly connected to the Dao Court.</p><p>Why did some people in the Dao Court change to cultivate the Divine Dao back then? What kind of Daoist theories did they base it on?</p><p>Divine Dao cultivation relies on the offerings of incense and faith, which is clearly contrary to the Xian Dao that Qin Sang had always understood.</p><p>Xian Dao cultivation pursues ascension to immortality.</p><p>But what about the Divine Dao?</p><p>If a Divine Dao cultivator ascends themselves, but cannot bring their believers to the Immortal Realm, even if it doesn't directly break their faith, it might easily create variables in the lower realm.</p><p>Unless the Immortal Realm and the lower realm could freely travel between each other.</p><p>Moreover, the more followers a Divine Dao cultivator has, the more constraints they have. How can they transcend?</p><p>So, there is also the Mahayana path in the world!</p><p>"The Divine Dao can be called Mahayana. But in my view, the Divine Dao, as it has evolved today, some of its cultivators have deviated, merely regarding the human path as sustenance for the Divine Dao, failing to serve as its rightful path. The Mahayana path is based on the world; one cultivates merit, or sagehood, or blessings, or accumulating Yin virtue… rooted in the human path.  I've traveled the world and seen some signs, some even inspired by the Divine Dao; some are kingly ways, some are sagehood, many kinds exist, the future is promising. Perhaps one day, a hundred flowers will bloom, a multitude of Dao will contend, and this will answer the young Daoist’s question."</p><p>Qing Yuan spoke eloquently.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't interrupt, nor did he want to; he just wanted Qing Yuan to continue.</p><p>The joy of hearing the Dao!  That was precisely how Qin Sang felt now.</p><p>This encounter came unexpectedly and suddenly.</p><p>Meeting on the path of Dao, hearing the Dao from a stranger seemed absurd, raising concerns about possible traps.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could judge within himself; he had already had a faint intuition, but it was unsystematic.</p><p>Qing Yuan's discussion on the Dao coincided perfectly with his own thoughts, and was even more comprehensive.</p><p>Not only did it solve many of Qin Sang's doubts.</p><p>Even more, upon hearing these words, Qin Sang's understanding of his own cultivation felt a subtle stir.</p><p>Yu Lang's cultivation was insufficient to grasp the deeper meaning; his thoughts remained on his own problems.  </p><p>Hearing these words, his brows remained furrowed.</p><p>His thoughts could not be hidden from the two of them.</p><p>The young Daoist seemed a little unwilling.  “Regardless of the Divine Way, the Kingly Way, or the Sacred Way, mortals always rely on others and cannot truly control their own destinies, isn’t that so?”</p><p>Qingyuan smiled slightly. “You only see cultivators as the butcher and mortals as the fish, but haven’t you noticed that among cultivators and among mortals there is also strength, weakness, and oppression? I incorporated the young lady from the Yin family and the ghost gods of Jian County into my story—what can they do to me? If everyone could cultivate, wouldn't Qi Refinement cultivators become like ordinary people today? And could the world even bear it?  Haven't you seen how locusts leave not a blade of grass behind when they pass?”</p><p>Qin Sang also looked at his disciple and said gravely, "Have you forgotten Master’s words? A man without aspiration cannot stand firm, but beware of empty talk and lofty ambitions."</p><p>“Exactly. There’s a saying among mortals: ‘If you are not in the position, you do not plan the policies.’ If you want to change this world… well, at least catch up with your master first.”</p><p>Qingyuan finished his cup of tea and picked up the teapot.</p><p>“Disciple understands,” Yu Lang, as if awakening from a dream, quickly took the teapot and refilled Qingyuan and his master’s cups.</p><p>The tea poured gently.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to calm down. He sat up straight, his brow no longer furrowed.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qingyuan resumed their previous conversation.</p><p>“In the cultivation world, the debate concerning Lesser and Greater Vehicles is becoming increasingly heated, particularly within Buddhism. However, there are exceptions, such as the Dan Ding school of Daoism. While they cultivate Lesser Vehicle Dao techniques, they possess the bearing of the Greater Vehicle!”</p><p>Qingyuan showed admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart stirred, and he couldn’t help but ask, “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Qingyuan picked up his folding fan and drew a large circle in the air.</p><p>“In this vast world, the five elemental energies are everywhere. Cultivating through understanding the five elements is, relatively speaking, the easiest path compared to other schools.</p><p>“Once you enter the Dao, changing to another path is like building a bridge over a chasm. Though this bridge leads to other directions, walking on land is undoubtedly easier than directly flying across the chasm.</p><p>“Legend says this bridge originated from the Dan Ding school of Daoism!</p><p>“Initially, Daoism combined the five elements, creating the Golden Core path, directly pointing towards the Great Dao, and subsequently spreading this Dao technique throughout the world.</p><p>“From then on, human cultivation seemed to have found a foundation. Regardless of sect or school, most first cultivate the five elemental techniques to enter the path of cultivation, then gradually clarify their Dao and pursue their own way—it's considered the general principle of all methods!</p><p>“The rise of humanity, surpassing all races in the world, is largely due to Daoism!</p><p>“Five-elemental spiritual roots also became the most important method for judging human aptitude.</p><p>“The cultivation realms of the Dan Ding school—Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and even the Great Vehicle—became prevalent throughout the world and are continuously being refined.</p><p>“Each breakthrough in realm is accompanied by a transformation, with clear rules that are convincing, and now they are revered by the world as the standard.</p><p>“Therefore, the Dan Ding school’s naming of its final realm as ‘Great Vehicle’ was certainly not arbitrary!</p><p>“Cultivating to improve oneself and using the Dao to improve others—what a great merit this is!”</p><p>These words deeply shocked Qin Sang.</p><p>In the Talisman Realm, he had read some Daoist scriptures containing records of the Dan Ding school, knowing that it had once been on par with the Talisman school, representing two of Daoism’s most important branches.</p><p>Due to the limited texts, Qin Sang could only make vague guesses, suspecting that perhaps the Dan Ding school later declined, or had disputes with the Talisman school, leading them to part ways.</p><p>During its heyday, the Talisman school’s power was astonishing.</p><p>But Qin Sang never imagined that the Dan Ding school’s achievements were in no way inferior to the later Talisman school!</p><p>Even now, most cultivators rely on the five elements to enter the immortal path—they should all thank Daoism!</p><p>“The food is here!”</p><p>A shout came from outside the private room.</p><p>A waiter quickly came to the door, knocked gently twice, opened the door, and held a tray.</p><p>On the tray was a dish of exquisite artistry, steaming hot, emitting a rich aroma.</p><p>In an instant, the room was filled with fragrance.</p><p>The dish was delicious and visually appealing, making everyone hungry.</p><p>The waiter smiled broadly. “The first dish, ‘Phoenix Welcoming Spring’!”</p><p>Along with the dish came a pot of wine. “This is the finest ‘Drunken Spring Breeze’ wine. Please enjoy yourselves, esteemed guests.”</p><p>The waiter bowed slightly and withdrew from the private room.</p><p>Qingyuan put down his fan and looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>“If the Dan Ding school was like that, what an impressive sight the Talisman school, once known as the Greater Vehicle school of Daoism, must have been!”</p><p>“I have always longed to see it!”</p>
