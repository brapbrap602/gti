<h1>Chapter 1803: The Nine Great Bright Seals</h1><p>May I trouble a sword cultivator to examine this?</p><p>Qin Sang was silent, speechless.</p><p>The Dianjin Mountain sect leader didn't suspect anything, assuming Qin Sang was in a difficult position. In this realm, true sword cultivators are extremely rare, rarely seen by ordinary people.</p><p>"If it's inconvenient for the Daoist Master, I happen to know a Daoist Master who is passionate about the sword way and has exceptional swordsmanship.  I can introduce you."</p><p>Qin Sang gently shook his head, "No need."</p><p>Disappointment flickered across the Dianjin Mountain sect leader's face. He was very curious about the sword's origin. If he could obtain its crafting method, it would certainly benefit his own refining techniques.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's will was firm, his aura subtle, so the Dianjin Mountain sect leader dared not press him, only reluctantly returning the Chengying sword to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Thank you for your trouble!"</p><p>Qin Sang paid for the appraisal and took his leave.</p><p>The Dianjin Mountain sect leader sighed softly.</p><p>...</p><p>Star Island Immortal Lake.</p><p>Qin Sang flew slowly above the water. His recent trips to the Demonic Source and the Daoist sect were incredibly fruitful. Next, he should dedicate some time to quiet cultivation and digest his gains.</p><p>Seeing the outline of Sword Heart Island in the distance, Qin Sang flew over. The black-robed elder immediately came to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang had frequent interactions with the Sword Master, and was quite familiar with the black-robed elder. He knew that the elder had once received great kindness from the Sword Master and had since called himself "Sword Servant," forgetting his original name, to show his loyalty to the Sword Master.</p><p>After speaking with Sword Servant, Qin Sang learned that the Sword Master was in seclusion.  He instructed Sword Servant not to disturb him.</p><p>"The master has ordered that Sword Heart Island always reserve a cave dwelling for the Sword Master. I will lead you there now," Sword Servant said respectfully.</p><p>"Very well," Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>They soon arrived at the center of Sword Heart Island.</p><p>The central part of Sword Heart Island is higher, the whole island resembling a raised mound, with the most concentrated spiritual energy at its core.</p><p>The Sword Master's cave dwelling is on the left of the peak, while Qin Sang's is on the right.</p><p>Entering the cave dwelling, Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings. The interior was elegantly and simply furnished, exactly to his liking.  It was clearly meticulously arranged by Sword Servant.  He was very satisfied. "Thank you for your trouble."</p><p>Sword Servant humbly replied he did not dare take credit, and bowed before leaving.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the quiet room, sealing the protective formations, and took out a jade slip.  It contained the cultivation insights of his ancestors related to the Supreme God-Soaring Thunder Technique.</p><p>Some were treasures from the two halls of the Daoist Court, others from the Left and Right Thunder Palaces.</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed through them, discovering that not all these insights were necessarily suitable for him.</p><p>The ancestors of the Daoist Court and the Left and Right Thunder Palaces certainly cultivated orthodox methods compatible with the Supreme God-Soaring Thunder Technique.  However, Qin Sang only used the Supreme God-Soaring Thunder Technique as a tool; his fundamental cultivation method remained the "Chapter of Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen."</p><p>Sticking to the old method might be influenced by the others’ cultivation path, even shaking his own.</p><p>Daoist techniques are all-encompassing; one technique might have many corresponding cultivation methods. For example, the two halls of the Daoist Court each only have one type of official technique, yet there are countless Daoist officials in the Daoist Court, they wouldn't all cultivate the same method.</p><p>Although the Left and Right Thunder Palaces were not as large as the two halls of the Daoist Court, they were still among the major sects.</p><p>Different techniques, different paths, and the higher the realm, the greater the divergence.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the split between the Left and Right Thunder Palaces might be related to disputes over techniques.</p><p>Different techniques invite different guardian generals, leading to subtle differences in the Dao understood from the techniques, and changes in the constructed altar.</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was to find common ground in these insights, to remain uninfluenced, and to make them his own.</p><p>In the following period, Qin Sang placed the jade slips on the ground in front of him.</p><p>He would sometimes pick one up and examine it for a long time, sometimes fall into deep thought, and at other times summon his altar and use the power of the Thunder Tortoise demon pill to attempt to forge the altar.</p><p>The altar gradually took shape.</p><p>The process of forging the altar was not something that could be accomplished overnight; it must be complemented by cultivation.</p><p>After several months, Qin Sang saw that the time was right and stopped forging the altar. He calmed his mind and truly began to cultivate.</p><p>The eleventh layer of the "Chapter of Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen" had been cultivated for a while in the Storm Realm. Although he couldn't cultivate in this realm, he would contemplate the technique whenever he had free time.</p><p>After slaying Li Hou, he had a new understanding of the technique in battle.  His cultivation in the following period should be very smooth.</p><p>Mulling this over, Qin Sang began to practice the technique.</p><p>Rich spiritual energy continuously gathered towards where Qin Sang sat cross-legged, and the cave dwelling once again fell silent.</p><p>It's common for Nascent Soul cultivators to enter seclusion for years, even decades.</p><p>But after only a stick of incense, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes, waking from his meditative state, a look of surprise on his face.</p><p>In just a short stick of incense of cultivation, his cultivation had made significant progress, faster than he had anticipated.</p><p>This unexpected result made Qin Sang fall into deep thought, and he gradually made a discovery.</p><p>The understanding of the Dao of Killing accumulated from slaying Li Hou was one reason. Another reason was likely the legacy of the ascension tribulation!</p><p>After the tribulation, Qin Sang vaguely felt a certain transformation within himself, as if the tribulation thunder contained the true meaning of the Dao, making up for his own shortcomings.  The previous biases and inadequacies in his understanding of the Dao had been perfected.</p><p>The Heaven-Eyed Butterfly also benefited from this, breaking through on its own.</p><p>Now, as Qin Sang began his cultivation, the true benefits of the Heavenly Tribulation manifested, his cultivation rapidly advancing in a short time.  After all, the attunement between Heaven and Man is the most crucial aspect of Nascent Soul cultivation. He carefully reflected on this, acknowledging its truth without being overwhelmed by the surprise.</p><p>“How long will the legacy of the Heavenly Tribulation last?”</p><p>Qin Sang believed it couldn't be sustained; otherwise, with such an advantage, the Greater Thousand World would be ruled by ascended cultivators.  Perhaps because the Lesser Thousand World's Heavenly Dao is incomplete, ascended cultivators from the Lesser Thousand World only experience this rapid progress upon entering the Greater Thousand World, and this effect should gradually weaken.  But undoubtedly, the perfection of one's own path will benefit every ascended cultivator for life.</p><p>With this discovery, Qin Sang was even more eager to cultivate.  He cultivated without regard for the seasons.</p><p>Two years had passed since Qin Sang's return to Sword Heart Island.  During these two years, Qin Sang hadn't left. He had already made arrangements on Hu Zhong Island for the communication method agreed upon with Mo Xingdao.  Neither Mo Xingdao nor Qing Dan Yuanjun had sent any messages, and the Sword Master hadn't disturbed him.</p><p>Inside the cave abode…</p><p>Qin Sang stopped cultivating at some point, his hands clasped before his chest, intently gazing at his empty palm.  A faint sword shadow lay on the ground.  Upon returning to Sword Heart Island, Qin Sang would take out the Chengying Sword during breaks in his cultivation, examining it repeatedly.  He first attempted analysis using refining techniques, to no avail; then he infused the Chengying Sword with his own sword intent, still to no effect.  Finally, he tried both methods simultaneously.  Two years passed, and Qin Sang still had no clue.</p><p>Qin Sang considered himself at least a half-sword cultivator, and he suspected that the Point Golden Mountain Sect Master had misjudged him.</p><p>An hour later…</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly withdrew his attention, a thoughtful expression on his face. He had been trying things according to his own ideas. If he remained at an impasse, he would have to ask the Sword Master for guidance.</p><p>Putting away the Chengying Sword, Qin Sang took out the gauntlet's unrefined core, sketching out the energy pathways, and quickly returned to his cultivation.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the cave abode's restriction was suddenly triggered from outside. Qin Sang awoke from his cultivation, his divine sense probing outward. He discovered it was his sword servant, and transmitted a message, "What is it?"</p><p>“Reporting to Master, Venerable Zhenru of Jingtai Temple is visiting; the master requests your presence.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly.  Immersed in cultivation for these years, he had forgotten about Venerable Zhenru. This was intentional; if the other party sought the Seven Masters Buddha Seal, he would simply wait and see.</p><p>“This cultivator understands. Please ask both daoist friends to wait,” Qin Sang said, calming his true energy and leaving the cave abode.</p><p>His cave abode was separated from the Sword Master's by a field of Sword Heart Orchids.  Passing through the woods, he arrived at the main hall and heard the two conversing and laughing.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru and the Sword Master also noticed Qin Sang and stood up to greet him.</p><p>The Sword Master said jokingly, “Qingfeng, you’ve been on Sword Heart Island for two years, and I haven't even seen you once. I owe this meeting to the Venerable.”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru clasped his hands together, saying, “This monk's visit is presumptuous; I apologize for disturbing Daoist Qingfeng’s seclusion.”</p><p>“Are you blaming me for lacking etiquette, Daoist Brother?” Qin Sang replied with a smile, then shook his head at Venerable Zhenru. “It is a pleasure to welcome friends from afar. Why would you say such a thing, Venerable?”</p><p>As they spoke, Qin Sang noticed something unusual about the Sword Master and Venerable Zhenru's expressions.</p><p>The Sword Master was the first to notice the anomaly, constantly observing Qin Sang.  Venerable Zhenru soon noticed as well, showing surprise.  “The Real Person's cultivation… In just a few years, your progress is so rapid!”</p><p>Qin Sang's cultivation had significantly improved since his time at Jushan. However, his suspicions were confirmed: the benefits of the ascension tribulation were indeed waning.</p><p>“This cultivator wasted many years before ascending. What slight progress is there to speak of?” Qin Sang shook his head, feigning unconcern.</p><p>The three sat down, drinking tea and discussing Daoist matters.  Unconsciously, their conversation turned to their experiences at Jushan, and to the movements of the Dao Court and the Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>In the previous battle, the Dao Court had obtained something at Jushan, but then fell silent.  These past two years, there had been no summons related to Jushan, nor news of the Dao Court launching a large-scale attack on Jushan.</p><p>Instead, Gui Fang Kingdom had begun to make significant moves.</p><p>“You two Daoist friends have been secluded in Star Island’s Immortal Lake; you might not have heard yet.  The eastern demon kingdoms have suddenly begun a revival of demon worship. Demons are proclaiming themselves demon gods, building numerous shrines and temples. If it were just one or two demon kingdoms, it might be tolerable, but all the demon kingdoms have changed their systems.  This must be orchestrated by Gui Fang Kingdom.  It’s said that demons have even entered the Abyssal Wasteland, attempting to convert the Gui people into believers…”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru recounted his findings.</p><p>Jingtại Temple is located southeast of Star Island's Fairy Lake, bordering the Demon Kingdom, and is intimately familiar with the Demon Kingdom's every move.</p><p>Upon learning of this, Qin Sang immediately recalled her experiences upon first arriving at Jushan.</p><p>Back then, the demons were only building temples on the outskirts, and the Demon Marquis only dared to lurk in the shadows, as if testing the waters.</p><p>Now, they openly and blatantly worship their demon god.</p><p>“Could it be because of the Jushan Altar Battle?”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, could the treasure the Guifang Kingdom and the Daoist Court are vying for be related to the divine path?</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren sipped his spiritual tea, seemingly unconcerned, and smiled faintly, "These demons, are they impatient to become subjects under the Daoist Court's rule?"</p><p>“This god is not that god!”</p><p>Zhenru Zunzhe shook his head.  All lands are under the Daoist Court's control; the Guifang Kingdom's ability to stand against the Daoist Court is incomparable.</p><p>He worriedly said, "I fear the demons have glimpsed the heavenly secrets of the divine path and are using it to rise to power."</p><p>Where the nest falls, the eggs break.</p><p>The cultivators and sects of Jushan were able to remain safe only because the Daoist Court withstood the Guifang Kingdom's might; this is why the demons dared not cause trouble.</p><p>If the Daoist Court falls to the demons, Jushan will be the first to fall.  Where will they go then?</p><p>“Regardless of demons or demon gods, Daoist Court officials will worry about them. We are too few and isolated, we can only follow the course of events; why worry ourselves needlessly? As long as the demons don't perform blood sacrifices and the people have a place to rely on, it’s a fortunate matter.”</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren's expression turned serious, “What actions has the Daoist Court taken regarding the demon god?”</p><p>“I haven’t heard of any,” Zhenru Zunzhe shook his head.</p><p>“Let’s wait and see.”</p><p>……</p><p>The three chatted, unaware that dusk had approached.</p><p>Zhijian Zhenren stood up, saying, “Venerable One, your visit must be for important matters to discuss with Qingfeng, I shall not keep you any longer.”</p><p>Qin Sang and the other also stood up and bid farewell to Zhijian Zhenren.</p><p>Through the forest, on a stone path.</p><p>A monk and a Daoist, dappled shadows of trees, the gentle murmur of a stream.</p><p>“Venerable One’s invitation, I’ve always kept it in mind. I've been delayed for too long. I recently obtained a new method and am eager to consolidate my cultivation,” Qin Sang explained.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators, a year or two is nothing.</p><p>That Zhenru Zunzhe couldn't even wait a few years shows how important the *Seven Master Buddha Seal* is to them.</p><p>Zhenru Zunzhe smiled, “The mountain doesn’t go to the monk, the monk goes to the mountain.”</p><p>As they spoke, the two entered Qin Sang’s cave dwelling and sat facing each other.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, waiting for Zhenru Zunzhe to state his purpose.</p><p>Zhenru Zunzhe’s smile faded, his expression turning serious, he asked formally, “I dare ask, from where did you learn that Buddha Seal?”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned a frown and asked back, “Does this Buddha Seal have some connection to your temple?”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s unwillingness to answer, Zhenru Zunzhe sighed. He knew he was too hasty and had revealed himself.</p><p>But this matter concerns a great secret of the temple, and he absolutely cannot miss this person.</p><p>Moreover, the other party is Dongxuan Zhenren, a worldly wise person; trying to deceive him is not easy.</p><p>Zhenru Zunzhe looked hesitant, after much deliberation he said, “Have you ever heard of the Nine Great Bright Seals?”</p><p>Nine Great Bright Seals!</p><p>Qin Sang’s pupils constricted, a storm brewing in his heart.</p><p>He not only knew of the Nine Great Bright Seals, but he had also learned half of one!</p><p>He had learned half of the Inner Lion Seal from Master Huaiyin of the Great Compassion Chan Temple. Although only half, it possessed immense power, capable of instantly healing grievous wounds, a truly extraordinary skill.</p><p>“What is the relationship between the *Seven Master Buddha Seal* and the Nine Great Bright Seals?” Qin Sang sensed something, feeling both surprise and delight.</p><p>“Among the Nine Great Bright Seals, there is one called the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.”</p><p>Since he had already spoken, Zhenru Zunzhe no longer hesitated, explaining, “Once this seal is perfected, one cultivates the Vajra Glass Body, a body like pure glass, invulnerable to divine weapons, its power unparalleled. Our temple possesses a recording of a high monk using this seal, and I have had the privilege of viewing it…”</p><p>Pausing, Zhenru Zunzhe gazed at Qin Sang, “The Buddha Seals you displayed possess a certain aura of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal. I suspect that the creator of this seal, not only deeply understands Buddhist principles and possesses great supernatural powers, but may have also drawn inspiration from the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.”</p><p>“Inspiration…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>Zhenru Zunzhe didn't know, he had only seen the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Qin Sang had mastered all seven Buddha Seals, only to find that he was far from mastering the *Seven Master Buddha Seal*.</p><p>The seven seals could be merged, and he was only just beginning.</p><p>The abilities of the seven seals are very balanced; what kind of supernatural power will result from their fusion? Is that the limit?</p><p>Could it possess several times the power of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal?</p><p>Reflecting on the cultivation process, a thought suddenly occurred to Qin Sang.</p><p>Could it be that there was no inspiration at all?</p><p>But rather, a supremely powerful cultivator had divided one seal into seven, making it easier for future generations to cultivate step-by-step and achieve perfection!</p>
