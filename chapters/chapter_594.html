<h1>Chapter 587: Soul Searching Technique</h1><p>Yi Tiannie's surprise attack failed.  He didn't immediately flee, daring to use the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit to threaten Qin Sang, because he believed Qin Sang's Corpse Pill was similar to the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>He controlled the Flying Night Rakshasa and knew Qin Sang's background well, believing they were at least evenly matched.  With his speed, he thought escaping would be easy; Qin Sang couldn't stop him.</p><p>But Yi Tiannie never imagined this Corpse Pill was different.</p><p>Qin Sang had used violent energy to forge her pill, her strength not inferior to a true Foundation Establishment cultivator, while Yi Tiannie only controlled an artificially refined Flying Night Rakshasa!</p><p>"You were a formidable figure.  If you'd been patient a few more years, you might have succeeded,"</p><p>The sea of fire parted, and Qin Sang emerged from the demonic flames, her gaze icy as she stared at Yi Tiannie.  She said coldly, "This place has a beautiful view.  Perfect for your burial!"</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner vibrated repeatedly, emitting demonic sounds.</p><p>The cold wind intensified, its mournful wail agonizing.</p><p>The stone hall was pitch black, nothing visible. Qin Sang stood beside the Ten Directions Yama Banner, wielding the demonic banner, surrounded by raging demonic flames, like a demonic figure reborn from fire.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire wasn't hot; instead, it made the stone hall incredibly cold. This chill seemed to seep into one's soul, causing involuntary trembling.</p><p>The flames were black, as if from the Nine Netherworlds, swallowing all light, bringing immense pressure. Yi Tiannie, surrounded, felt a pang of fear.</p><p>The rocks in the stone hall creaked, but a faint fluorescence flowed within, indicating their exceptional strength, easily withstanding the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's assault.</p><p>Protected by the妖王血禁 (Yao Wang Blood Prohibition), even with all their strength, neither Qin Sang nor Yi Tiannie could break through the stone walls, allowing them to fight freely.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's expression froze, utterly grim.</p><p>Years ago, when the Kuiyin Ancestor passed away, he bestowed the Ten Directions Yama Banner upon his disciples. Yi Tiannie had mastered this treasure and knew it intimately.</p><p>If Qin Sang had a normal Corpse Pill, there would be nothing to fear, but now, things were different.</p><p>Demonic flames blazed.</p><p>A green light flashed across Yi Tiannie's chest, and his figure vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  She knew this wasn't Yi Tiannie's concealment technique; his speed was simply too fast, creating an illusion.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa was inherently skilled in escape techniques, appearing and disappearing without a trace. Yi Tiannie had used some demonic secret art, making his speed even faster and incredibly agile.</p><p>She'd spread the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire precisely to counter this move.</p><p>The moment Yi Tiannie moved, he inevitably touched the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. Qin Sang easily tracked his movements, flicked a finger, and the surrounding demonic flames surged towards Yi Tiannie's path, blocking his escape.</p><p>For a time, the stone hall was chaotic.</p><p>With the sounds of repeated impacts, Yi Tiannie's figure, like a ghost, appeared now on the left, now on the right, desperately trying to break through the demonic fire.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire sometimes condensed into a mass, sometimes dispersed.</p><p>Its changes were unpredictable yet orderly, controlled by Qin Sang's will.</p><p>Even under Yi Tiannie's powerful blows, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire rapidly reformed, blocking his path, forcing him back, leaving no gaps.</p><p>Despite the difference in their strength, killing Yi Tiannie wouldn't be quick.</p><p>Too much haste could expose weaknesses, allowing Yi Tiannie to escape.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't aiming to kill Yi Tiannie, not even to injure him immediately. Her focus was on manipulating the Ten Directions Yama Banner, blocking escape routes and firmly trapping him!</p><p>Because of Qin Sang's steady approach, no matter how Yi Tiannie struggled, he couldn't find a way out.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was subtly connecting with the soul mark within the Flying Night Rakshasa, attempting to break through Yi Tiannie's control and awaken the soul mark.</p><p>Yi Tiannie was left with only a remnant soul; until his soul recovered, he had to rely on the Flying Night Rakshasa for strength.</p><p>If Qin Sang could regain control of the Flying Night Rakshasa, cutting off his support, Yi Tiannie would be like a rootless weed, a lone ghost, completely at her mercy.</p><p>Even if she couldn't completely reclaim the Flying Night Rakshasa, she could create chaos and weaken Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Yi Tiannie quickly sensed Qin Sang's intentions, feeling despair, roaring in rage, and desperately attacking the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>All his efforts were in vain; he'd missed his only chance to escape, cutting off his own retreat and becoming a caged beast.  Yi Tiannie's attempts to attack Qin Sang, who held a banner, were equally futile.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the other hand, appeared increasingly calm. He sensed the soul imprint becoming clearer, while Yi Tiannie's movements slowed, clearly affected.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang reawakened the soul imprint.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang was about to seize control of the Flying Night Yaksha's body, Yi Tiannie ceased struggling. The Flying Night Yaksha remained motionless.  Yi Tiannie seemed to vanish.</p><p>Qin Sang, puzzled, focused his mind and unleashed all the Nine Netherworld Infernal Fires onto the Flying Night Yaksha.</p><p>In that instant, a dazzling blue light erupted from the Flying Night Yaksha's chest, releasing an incredibly powerful pressure that shot forth.</p><p>This blue light forcefully pierced through the flames, but failed to create an escape route, ultimately weakening and extinguishing itself, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.  Just as he was about to investigate, he sensed something amiss.  Looking down at the lake bed, he discovered the anomaly.</p><p>Immediately, a clear, resonant sword chime rang out in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>The next moment, the ebony sword appeared at the bottom of the lake.</p><p>With a burst of sword energy, the ebony sword struck the lake bed.</p><p>A sharp "clang" echoed.  From the seemingly empty lake bottom, a crescent-shaped jade was struck out of thin air by the ebony sword.</p><p>Inside the jade, Yi Tiannie's resentful soul was clearly visible.</p><p>Even in this desperate situation, Yi Tiannie had managed a clever ruse, detonating all his remaining spiritual energy to hide within the jade, attempting to slip away.</p><p>What a tenacious will to survive!</p><p>Qin Sang was impressed, but showed no mercy.</p><p>Sword energy enveloped the jade, rendering Yi Tiannie helpless.</p><p>But the instant the sword energy surrounded the jade, a crack appeared on Yi Tiannie's soul, and his essence rapidly dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly moved, seizing the jade.</p><p>Yi Tiannie tried to kill himself, but he wouldn't get off so easily. Qin Sang still needed to extract information about the Three Lights Jade Liquid.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to activate the Soul-Seizing Incantation, he heard Yun Youzi's voice transmission: "His soul is about to dissipate. Use the Soul-Searching Technique!"</p><p>Then, a Soul-Searching Technique appeared in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>This technique was incredibly refined, far surpassing any he'd encountered before.</p><p>Knowing time was of the essence, and that the Soul-Seizing Incantation was less effective than the Soul-Searching Technique, Qin Sang immediately changed his plan.  He swiftly completed the incantation, eerie black energy emanating from his fingertips as he grasped at Yi Tiannie's fading soul.</p>
