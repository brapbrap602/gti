<h1>Chapter 2184: Thunder Beasts</h1><p>When the radiant light breaks through the barrier between the shadowy space and the sanctuary, the Thunder Palace is bound to be impacted.  We must be vigilant. If the radiant light has spread, sweeping across the Thunder Palace, the grey figures will appear.</p><p>In the face of the grey figures, Qin Sang and the others will be severely affected and unable to fight with full force.</p><p>Therefore, the moment to strike must be chosen when the radiant light is about to arrive but hasn't yet, a window of time that may be very short.</p><p>They could wait for the radiant light to destroy the Thunder Palace and reap the benefits. But Qin Sang has doubts, worrying that if those Thunder Generals aren't killed by their own hands, they might not obtain the Thunder Crystals.</p><p>The Thunder Crystals only appear after the Thunder Generals are killed. Before the Thunder Generals descend, within the thunderclouds, there's no trace of the Thunder Crystals. Once the radiant light disperses the thunderclouds, the Thunder Crystals within might also dissipate, becoming untraceable.</p><p>The Thunder Crystals are closely related to the golden page mark in Qin Sang's palm, and are clearly a very crucial element, one that cannot be missed.</p><p>Qin Sang shared his concerns and plan.  Everyone realized that even with the radiant light's assistance, the path ahead wasn't easy. Their spirits, which had just relaxed, immediately tightened again.</p><p>"Daoist, what do you think is sealed within the Thunder Palace?" Fu Jiang couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Having worked together to attack the Thunder Palace, their relationship had eased somewhat. Although the treasures weren't theirs, the Fu clan leader and Fu Jiang couldn't help but be curious about what was inside.</p><p>Logically, something that needs to be sealed should be harmful; opening the seal is probably not a good thing. But this is a sanctuary. If something forbidden is sealed within, the ancestor of the Yi Ren clan would certainly have warned their descendants, and certainly wouldn't have left instructions on how to enter this place.</p><p>Another possibility is that it's a living creature, sealed so it won't run around, staying quietly here waiting for a destined person.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't provide an answer.  Various treasures flashed through his mind.</p><p>The golden page mark, the Thunder Crystals, the armor, the… beads…  Ultimately, perhaps they need to be combined to reveal their true nature, but none of these have the slightest life force; it shouldn't be a living being within the seal.</p><p>While discussing, they waited for the moment to arrive.</p><p>They spent another three days amidst continuous tremors.</p><p>On this day, Qin Sang activated the mark in his palm, attempting to return to the sanctuary to observe the situation outside. Unexpectedly, the mark only flickered once, and he remained in place.</p><p>"The outside has been destroyed by the radiant light!"</p><p>Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>The last time he went out, Qin Sang saw a lake of radiant light appearing at the edge of the island. It's estimated that the entire island has been swallowed by the lake of radiant light.</p><p>This signified that the time was about to come.</p><p>The Fu clan leader observed the thunderclouds and said, "The fluctuations in the thunderclouds are several times more intense than three days ago. The sealing array must have been affected."</p><p>"Correct, but it's still not enough for us to pass the final hurdle," Qin Sang turned, gazing at the Thunder Palace.</p><p>They re-entered the palace, arriving at the vermilion gate that had blocked them before. Everyone stared intently at the sky.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Whoosh… Rumble… Boom…’</p><p>…</p><p>Dark clouds surged, wind and thunder intertwined. Amidst the lightning and thunder, one could see the thunderclouds rising and falling, sometimes towering high, sometimes the cloud layers suddenly plummeting.</p><p>The thunderclouds were also part of the sealing array, the place where the Thunder Generals were born.  Accompanying this was a violent fluctuation of the spirit array power, as if the sealing array was about to collapse.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Even as the thunderclouds above crashed down, lightning striking nearby, dark clouds almost pressing down on them, they suddenly sprang back.</p><p>A glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes, "Go!"</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The vermilion gate sprung open, and everyone entered in succession.</p><p>Intruders should trigger the sealing array immediately, and the guardian Thunder Generals should descend, yet only the silver mist appeared as expected.</p><p>Five balls of thunder light appeared in the clouds, rising and falling, seemingly the five Thunder Generals that would initially descend. But at this moment, these five balls of thunder light were of varying brightness, some immediately turning into lightning and striking down, others fluctuating uncertainly, appearing stagnant.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Only two Thunder Generals successfully descended, and there was a sequence to their appearance. Their giant eyes wide, just as they were about to roar in anger, streams of light engulfed them.</p><p>Divine techniques and spirit treasures shone brilliantly.  The opportunity to attack a lone Thunder General was rare; they naturally would not show mercy.</p><p>Void power, five-element divine light, Grey Warbler Sword…</p><p>Qin Sang held nothing back.</p><p>They had already figured out the Thunder Generals' details. Under the combined attack of everyone, the first Thunder General quickly transformed into lightning and returned to the sky.</p><p>Then came the second, the third…</p><p>The thunderclouds seemed to cooperate with them; for every one they killed, a new one descended. Regardless of the number of Thunder Generals, their formations had been completely disrupted, unable to use combined attacks, ultimately being defeated individually—even easier than the previous stage.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed a Thunder Crystal, his figure flashing to the front of the hall. Pushing open the hall doors, inside he found only the neck piece of a helmet, the helmet disassembled into various parts.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed her armor, glancing skyward.  The transformation of the thunderclouds was happening faster than anticipated, even while they were slaying the thunder generals.  They didn't dare hesitate, immediately pressing onward.</p><p>The radiant light became their ally, weakening the sealing array.  To buy time, Qin Sang took the risks, allowing Liuli and the others to focus solely on supporting her.</p><p>One vermilion gate after another swung open.  Finally, Qin Sang opened the last gate before the central thunder hall.</p><p>Inside, the final piece of the helmet resided – a fierce beast head, majestic and imposing.  Liuli and the others were puzzled; they had never seen such a spirit beast.</p><p>"This is one of the thunder beasts revered by the ancient Daoist sects…" Qin Sang explained.</p><p>The origins of the Daoist Court revealed the chaos of the ancient Daoist sects' lineages—independent and disparate, each with its own history and unique characteristics. Only after the Divine Thunder Assembly did they form the Court.</p><p>The ancient Daoist sects drew power from observing nature, hence their deep respect and fear of thunder. The Thunder God was one of humanity's earliest deities.</p><p>Different sects depicted the Thunder God in various ways, leading to diverse legends and associated thunder beasts. Some revered real creatures as thunder beasts, while others were figments of imagination, lacking real-world counterparts.  They were simply called "Thunder Beasts."</p><p>These legends rose and fell with the sects, most lost to the river of time.  Qin Sang had seen records of many such beasts in the Daoist Court's archives. One resembled the beast head, not perfectly, but enough to confirm its identity: the chief among thunder beasts!</p><p>This armor was modeled after it.  In ancient times, thunder beasts held a high status, some even considered them manifestations of the Thunder God, or at least its mounts.  The armor's origin remained a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang easily drew the beast head helm towards her, retrieved the other parts, and discovered they formed a complete suit of armor.</p><p>But what was in the thunder hall?  Only helmet plumes?</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind. She tried activating the armor, but it remained unresponsive.</p><p>Cracks appeared in the thunderclouds, and multicolored lights flickered on the horizon.  Soon, the radiant light would pierce the barrier and sweep through the palace!</p><p>There was no time. Qin Sang stowed the thunder beast armor and pushed open the final vermilion gate.</p><p>Beyond lay a vast courtyard, with the thunder hall at its center, bombarded by lightning.  Bathed in thunder, the hall exuded an awe-inspiring power.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed evenly laid stone slabs, but also slightly raised platforms encircling the hall.  Empty at first, as they crossed the threshold, the platforms glowed, connecting with the thunderclouds above, revealing a familiar energy.</p><p>The number was significant, but more importantly, the platforms were interconnected, forming a sophisticated array, designed to amplify the thunder generals' combined attack.</p><p>"This array… gasp…"  The Fu clan leader was shocked. "Even with the aid of their own people, aside from the Feather and Mermaid clans, even the upper clans would struggle to overcome this and seek external assistance!"</p><p>"We lucked out…" Qin Sang thought thankfully.</p><p>The array needed all the thunder generals to reach its full potential, but now, scattered and weakened, its power was greatly diminished.</p><p>As lightning struck a platform, they instantly killed the first thunder general and moved to the next, without pause.  Thunder general after thunder general fell, leaving behind thunder crystals that merged with the golden page mark, a burning sensation rising in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>This level was now significantly easier; the thunder generals were disorganized, the situation becoming clearer.  Yet the thunderclouds raged more violently.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The clouds tore open, and radiant light flooded in.</p><p>One beam struck outside the palace, like sunlight after a storm, dispelling the gloom, but it also heralded a new threat.</p><p>Another beam appeared, thankfully far away.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A third, a fourth…</p><p>The radiant light continued to pierce the clouds and spread. The situation was critical.</p><p>Suddenly, a beam entered the palace. Though not directly on them, it would soon reach them.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. She activated the Sky-Binding Golden Lock, the illusory realm simultaneously trapping the last two thunder generals.  Liuli and the others surrounded one while Qin Sang attacked the other.</p><p>Finally, another thunder general fell.</p><p>The last thunder guardian before Qin Sang exploded, leaving behind a thunder crystal.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly turned, looked at the spreading dawn light beyond the Zhu gate, and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The dawn light struck the Thunder Hall, causing lightning to flash. The hall shook slightly but didn't collapse.</p><p>Grey figures appeared beside everyone.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly sent a voice message to the Fu clan leader. Their figures crossed, the Fu clan leader intercepting the grey figures pursuing Qin Sang, while Qin Sang approached the Thunder Hall and found the barrier had dissipated.</p><p>He pushed open the main door and entered the hall, which was unusually empty except for a circular altar.</p><p>A silver light, like a ball of lightning with countless electric threads flickering within, floated above the altar.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>Qin Sang was puzzled. This silver light seemed connected to the power of thunder, yet it was unlike anything he recognized.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took out the armor fragments.  Drawn to the silver light, they attempted to break free from his control.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then released his true energy.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The fragments shot towards the silver light.  A series of *bangs* echoed as the silver light suddenly vanished, replaced by a complete set of thunder beast armor.</p><p>The thunder beast armor hung silently above the altar, unchanged in size, barely reaching Qin Sang's knees.  He touched it with his true energy, but there was no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang then understood. He stepped forward, raised his hand, and pressed the golden page mark on his palm onto the chest of the thunder beast armor.</p><p>The next moment, a strange force surged from his palm into the armor's chest.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Silver light shot from the empty eye sockets of the beast's head, like real eyes, radiating a fierce aura.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, and he retreated several meters.  Countless bolts of lightning coursed through the thunder beast armor, transforming it almost into a ball of lightning, concealing an unprecedentedly powerful energy.</p><p>These lightning bolts intertwined into a familiar pattern, perfectly matching the sealing array.</p><p>Qin Sang realized the Thunder Hall wasn't a simple seal. The thunder beast armor had been disassembled, and the sealing array had evolved from the armor itself – it was both the seal and the armor itself!</p><p>The energy within the armor was awakening, drawing the attention of everyone outside the hall.</p><p>It was clearly not just a suit of armor.</p><p>The energy grew stronger, causing even Liu Li and others to feel apprehension.</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant, yet he sensed a connection, a strange affinity, with the thunder beast armor. This connection likely stemmed from the golden page mark.</p><p>Under the curious gazes of the crowd, the thunder beast armor completed its transformation. Nine feet tall, its silver surface gleamed, now a full set of thunder armor. The thunder beast's eyes were particularly striking, bright and lifelike.  However, one eye was missing; the left eye socket was empty. Qin Sang's expression shifted; he immediately took out a [missing word, presumably a pearl or similar item], flicked it towards the left eye socket.</p><p>Perfect!</p><p>The eye returned, the silver light in the thunder beast's eyes even more brilliant, radiating an indescribable ferocity.  Upon closer inspection, a difference was evident between the two eyes: one real, one illusory.</p><p>Suddenly, the thunder beast armor's eyes flashed menacingly, and it vanished.</p><p>A thunderclap later, the thunder beast armor reappeared before Qin Sang, incredibly close.  Everyone was startled.</p><p>The speed of the thunder beast armor's appearance was second only to Qin Sang's thunder escape technique.  From this, one could infer its full capabilities.  If not for the dawn light, Qin Sang would certainly have tested its strength.</p><p>"This thing seems not to be alive, whether a puppet or a thunder guard. I suspect it could fight even late-stage peak experts single-handedly! Congratulations on obtaining such a powerful aid, what a stroke of luck!"  The Fu clan leader said enviously.</p><p>"I shall call it the Thunder Beast War Guard.  The Sacred Land's transformation brought me this opportunity.  Many others have likely also gained great fortune this time…"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, but inwardly thought, the Fu clan leader hadn’t seen everything yet.</p><p>If a Nascent Soul-level thunder spell were sealed within the [missing word, presumably a pearl or similar item], the Thunder Beast War Guard's power would be even more terrifying!</p>
