<h1>Chapter 1435: Azure Luan Dharma Appearance</h1><p>Next, Qin Sangâ€™s gaze flashed.</p><p>His divine sense was unreserved.</p><p>The astral winds grew even more violent, the white streams of energy within them noticeably different from the other astral winds. This was the external manifestation of the power of divine sense, the transformation of divine sense into form!</p><p>Only with an extremely powerful and solidified divine sense could this be achieved, and it was considered one of the hallmarks of a Great Cultivator.</p><p>Very few at the mid-Nascent Soul stage could accomplish this; they were all at the pinnacle of the cultivation world.</p><p>"Still unable to directly manipulate the vital energies of heaven and earth. It's said that only those at the Spirit Transformation stage possess such methods, a fundamental difference from the Nascent Soul stage. I'm thinking too much."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered rapidly as he returned to reality.</p><p>"Hmm, the benefits of divine sense transformation are very obvious. Besides the inherent advantages, the speed of casting Dao techniques and the grasp of timing have taken a qualitative leap, making disguise harder to detect. Also, my spiritual perception is much sharper! For example, the premonition of danger, and the ability to sense when someone is spying on me, are much easier to perceive than before."</p><p>Only now did Qin Sang understand why he had been followed by Old Demon Hunmo for so long, yet the Skyeye Butterfly only discovered him at the final moment.</p><p>He recalled any anomalies in the Skyeye Butterfly before entering the Pure Ocean Sect, remembering the inexplicable fluttering of its wings at one point.</p><p>It was likely caused by Old Demon Hunmo.</p><p>It wasn't that the Skyeye Butterfly's innate divine power was weak, unable to detect Old Demon Hunmo's movements. Rather, it was Old Demon Hunmo's spiritual perception that was too sharp; he noticed the anomaly just as he was about to be exposed and took timely countermeasures.</p><p>And also in the Buddha Hall.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo's reaction speed was faster than Qin Sang had anticipated. The demonic light he released in haste was actually able to disperse the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>"No wonder!"</p><p>Qin Sang understood the previous doubts, gently nodding. In his heart, he wondered if the Skyeye Butterfly could conceal itself from the perception of a Great Cultivator when it ascended to the mid-fourth transformation.</p><p>After finishing his analysis, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense, and immediately, the Fire Lotus Seed flew out from between his eyebrows.</p><p>Qin Sang had it hover in front of him, carefully examining it.</p><p>After refining the Hidden Fragrance Pill and focusing on cultivation for four months, Qin Sang had successfully broken through to the second layer of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*!</p><p>The appearance of the Fire Lotus Seed at this time was not much different from before, except for a faint flame that surrounded its surface. Upon closer inspection, one could find that it vaguely formed the prototype of a flower bud.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled carefully.</p><p>Back then, Old Demon Mou's Fire Lotus Seed seemed to have a similar manifestation, and the flower bud prototype on the surface of Old Demon Mou's Fire Lotus Seed was fuller.</p><p>From this, it could be inferred that Old Demon Mou was in the second layer of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* at that time, and his attainments were higher than Qin Sang's current level.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Fire Lotus Seed that had not yet bloomed, recalled the descriptions in the secret technique, and said softly, "Only by condensing a complete lotus flower can one advance to the third layer, evolving a spiritual fire lotus platform. Looking at this, refining all the Nine Nether Demonic Fire won't be enough, and it will require a long period of cultivation. To break through to the third layer, is it necessary to be at the Spirit Transformation stage or even... higher?"</p><p>What level of secret technique is the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*?</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that he had to re-evaluate it.</p><p>The third layer of the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* was difficult to reach, and Qin Sang stopped thinking about it, instead pondering the future process of refining demonic fire. With the transformation of divine sense and its increasing solidification, the speed of refining would naturally become faster.</p><p>He threw out the Demonic Banner, controlling the demonic fire, and indeed, it was easier and more skillful than before, without worrying about being found a flaw by the opponent and escaping.</p><p>He also tried to use Dao techniques, including the *Lightning Command*, and they were all easier and faster than before.</p><p>After verifying the transformation brought by the solidification of divine sense in all aspects, Qin Sang was about to return to his cave when he suddenly remembered something, performed a hand seal, and his figure changed.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Phoenix wings spread wide behind him, and Qin Sang actually used the Heavenly Demon Transformation, demonic energy permeating.</p><p>He was about to try to use the Lightning Escape technique to see what changes the phoenix wings had after the transformation of divine sense, when suddenly, feeling something in his heart, he shouted, "Azure Luan Dharma Appearance!"</p><p>The Azure Luan Dharma Appearance emerged, still unusually illusory.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that it was because his *Heavenly Demon Transformation* had not made much progress.</p><p>However, this time, when he summoned the Azure Luan Dharma Appearance, the feeling was completely different from before.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, and with a thought, the Azure Luan Dharma Appearance flickered slightly. Then Qin Sang felt that the power of lightning in the phoenix wings suddenly became violent.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A bolt of lightning pierced through the void, and only then did the sound of thunder come.</p><p>Before the thunder could disappear, another bolt of lightning returned along the same path, revealing Qin Sang's slightly excited smile.</p><p>For a time, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning alternated in this sea area.</p><p>The creatures in the sea instinctively feared and fled.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, the benefits of divine sense transformation are not limited to this. It can even initially mobilize the power of the Azure Luan Dharma Appearance to enhance the Lightning Escape technique, making the escape speed even faster!"</p><p>On second thought, this was not surprising.</p><p>All indications showed that essence, energy, and spirit were all very important to cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Old Demon Hunmo's performance in the Pure Ocean Sect and assessed in his heart, "If Old Demon Hunmo didn't hold back, my two escape techniques combined would be faster than him. Hmm, Old Demon Hunmo wouldn't sacrifice reason because of rage. At that time, I needed to guard against traps in the secret passage, so it might not have been his full strength, and it remains to be verified. However, with my current strength, even if I encounter that old demon in the future, I will have the ability to confront him."</p><p>The improvement of his escape technique was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>This greatly increased his confidence.</p><p>"Greatly increased speed, keen spiritual perception, now I have enough confidence to participate in the Myriad Demons Assembly, even if there are any traps. Old Demon Hunmo certainly wouldn't expect that I could break through to divine sense transformation in such a short period of time. However, I still can't be complacent, that old demon is, after all, a Great Cultivator. I'll go back and contact Tan Hao to see how much news he has gathered, and whether the emergence of the Yellow Dragon Gentleman's Palace is true or false."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was filled with the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal*.</p><p>He didn't want to miss the opportunity to obtain a martial art divine power at the Nascent Soul level.</p><p>The previous plan was to ask Real Person Yin Quan to buy it on his behalf. But in this way, he would have to give the spiritual medicine and pill formulas to Real Person Yin Quan first, and Qin Sang couldn't accept exposing his cards to outsiders, even if he could use a demonic heart oath to restrain him.</p><p>Moreover, if a treasure better than the *Seven Teacher Buddha Seal* appeared at the trade fair, he would miss it.</p><p>Normal top-tier cultivation methods, or breakthrough secrets, those old things wouldn't take them out.</p><p>But if there were fatal flaws, like the *Mystic Female Jade Cauldron True Scripture*, Corpse Pills, or *Heavenly Demon Transformation*, and he happened to be able to avoid them with the Jade Buddha, he could buy them at a low price.</p><p>It would be best to have divine powers related to divine sense.</p><p>Qin Sang's application of divine sense was still at a rudimentary stage.</p><p>While thinking about these things, Qin Sang slowly flew towards his cave.</p><p>Tan Hao had not left any messages, and it was unclear where he had gone.</p><p>Qin Sang was considering whether he should go out, as the Myriad Demons Assembly was approaching, and it must have spread like wildfire, making it easy to find out.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly remembered that there was still one thing in the Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>The Mysterious Ice Box of the Profound Heaven Palace!</p><p>A powerful divine sense was helpful in breaking restrictions and seals, and now he might be able to open the Ice Box.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang immediately accelerated and quickly returned to his cave, taking out the Mysterious Ice Box.</p>
