<h1>Chapter 1756:  Conquering the Mountain, Breaking the Temple</h1><p>Shen Huo, a man of strong character, learned that Qin Sang also cultivated physical strength. His attitude immediately changed. He pulled Qin Sang to sit down, plopping beside him, picking up the wine jug on the table and draining it in one gulp, wiping the liquor from his lips.</p><p>He intended to clap Qin Sang on the shoulder, but for some reason, changed his mind mid-gesture. Slamming his hand on the table, he declared, “They say we of the Dragon Tiger Altar are barbarians!  But manipulating armies—nothing beats a good punch!  Just based on Daoist Qingfeng’s cultivation of the Dragon Tiger Altar, Shen trusts you!”</p><p>Shi Xuan shared a drink, a wry smile playing on his lips.</p><p>He and Shen Huo had known each other for years, understanding his nature: he considered those of similar paths as kindred spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang's smile remained, he raised his cup in acknowledgment before emptying it.</p><p>His investigations revealed that the Dragon Tiger Altar and the Military Altar represented different schools of cultivation within the Daoist world.</p><p>There was also the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>The Military Altar is straightforward: Daoists summon and raise armies, not only able to deploy troops and fight as a one-man army, but also to unify the soldiers' spiritual energy for mutual enhancement and cultivation aid.</p><p>The Daoist tradition calls this the Military Altar's peace, a cornerstone of orthodox Daoism.</p><p>But not every Daoist has the ability to raise an army.</p><p>Those from prominent sects or the two courts of the Daoist government already possess armies provided by their masters upon apprenticeship.</p><p>These soldiers are born and raised within the sect, utterly loyal, requiring no training to obey commands.</p><p>Without a sect-provided army, one must venture out to subdue demons and recruit soldiers themselves.</p><p>This leaves aside the question of ability to subdue demons; finding soldiers compatible with oneself requires immense effort.</p><p>Such recruited demon soldiers are known as "Five-Chang Armies."</p><p>As the name suggests, they are unrestrained and unruly, initially a rabble incapable of following orders. Even after taming, they demand constant appeasement.</p><p>Many rebellious armies that attack altars are of this kind; even True Immortals of the Danxiao Mansion have fallen victim, showcasing their danger.</p><p>However, once an army is cultivated, it not only aids in cultivation but also greatly enhances the power of formations, talismans, and incantations on the battlefield.  However, there's a deep connection between the cultivator and their army; if the army suffers losses, the altar itself is in danger.</p><p>There is another path.</p><p>This involves minimal or no recruitment of an army, instead relying on external forces such as natural wonders to strengthen the altar. As the Daoist cultivates, the altar and their spirit merge to form a true Golden Seal.</p><p>The Daoist tradition calls this the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>Except for the two courts of the Daoist government, which are wealthy, other sects have limited numbers of soldiers they can support.  Except for their most promising disciples, most cultivate the Golden Seal Altar, though finding the necessary natural wonders is challenging.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t yet witnessed a Golden Seal cultivator in action, unsure of their capabilities.</p><p>It is said that the two methods are not mutually exclusive, and many cultivators practice both.</p><p>Whether it's the Military Altar or the Golden Seal Altar, the goal is to forge a stable altar, using the altar to secure the spirit, a vessel for cultivating spiritual energy.</p><p>The stable altar settles the spiritual energy, and the guardian deity protects the mind.</p><p>The third school is the Dragon Tiger Altar; this involves refining the body, merging Qi and blood to manifest the power of dragon and tiger, thus its name.</p><p>Those who cultivate the Dragon Tiger Altar no longer fear the six celestial energies, even using them to refine their bodies.  Yet, they still require a stable altar and a guardian deity for their spirit.</p><p>Regardless of the school, cultivating the spirit is essential for peaceful cultivation in this world.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang recalled the snake demon in his spirit beast pouch. The demon's cultivation method felt very similar to the Daoist Dragon Tiger Altar, the only difference being the focus of their spirit.</p><p>Sensing resentment in Shen Huo's tone, Qin Sang guessed the reason.</p><p>It matched his findings: the Daoist world considered Military Altar cultivation superior and Dragon Tiger Altar cultivation inferior, giving rise to the derogatory term "barbarian."</p><p>“The six celestial energies are ubiquitous; those furry and scaled beasts thrive, leaving us behind. When will we pacify the demon kingdom and purge the evil influence? Since we're here, we should act accordingly, yet the world remains stubbornly entrenched in the past!”</p><p>Shen Huo raged, glaring at Shi Xuan and his sibling, even cursing his friends.</p><p>He didn’t believe in the supposed orthodox Daoism, instead viewing the Dragon Tiger Altar as the true path.</p><p>His unrestrained voice carried outside, heard by several other Daoists, who shared his anger, but dared not argue given Shen Huo's cultivation and demonstrated combat prowess.</p><p>Luo Yin puffed out her cheeks in anger, unable to formulate a rebuttal.</p><p>Shi Xuan sighed, ordering a large jug of fine wine to be brought to Shen Huo to placate him.</p><p>Those with innate spiritual abilities are naturally suited to physical cultivation.  We humans, lacking special bloodlines, are physically weak. Is cultivating in the Dragon Tiger Altar truly easier than other methods?  Brother Shen and Daoist Qingfeng, having experienced numerous hardships in their cultivation, should understand this better than anyone.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, acknowledging Shi Xuan's gaze, but showed no interest in joining the debate.</p><p>Shi Xuan was disappointed, and soothed Shen Huo alone, until his throat was parched, only to be silenced by Shen Huo's retort:</p><p>“You claim that profound cultivation allows you to summon heavenly soldiers and generals, to command the armies of the upper altars, and to borrow the power of the gods to enhance your talismans. But where are these gods now? You offer countless prayers and perform countless rituals, yet have you received any response?  Aren't we all the same, relying only on a protective deity sent from the Divine Realm?”</p><p>Shen Huo expressed his disdain with a scoff. Shi Xuan sighed deeply, shaking his head, too weary to argue further.</p><p>Shen Huo then turned to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had long observed Shen Huo. While seemingly rough and boisterous, he was actually shrewd, carefully avoiding sensitive matters and never revealing a single secret.  To believe one could be completely open and honest with him would be a grave mistake.</p><p>Nevertheless, Shen Huo was not as cunning as Qin Sang.  Without revealing his intentions, Qin Sang gleaned much useful information, particularly gaining a thorough understanding of Ju Shan Zhi.</p><p>Shen Huo had spent many years in Ju Shan Zhi, where he met Shi Xuan and his sibling.</p><p>Ju Shan Zhi lies between the Dao Court and the Ghost Fang Kingdom, a long-disputed battlefield.</p><p>Years of relentless warfare have failed to dislodge either side, trapping both in a quagmire of conflict and fostering an irreconcilable blood feud.</p><p>Recently, the Dao Court and the Demon-Ghost Kingdom have declared a truce, a period of recovery and recuperation. However, Shen Huo claims this respite will be short-lived, and both sides are surely preparing for renewed conflict.</p><p>History shows that even if the Dao Court reclaims Ju Shan Zhi, the war will not end, and vice versa.  Even during truces, Ju Shan Zhi remains a scene of bloodshed.</p><p>Both sides maintain a large military presence, engaged in constant open and covert conflict, giving rise to various practices and rituals.</p><p>However, unlike the Dao Court's heartland, a separate faction exists in Ju Shan Zhi, known as the Yin Tian Palace, rumored to rival the two main branches of the Dao Court.</p><p>Shen Huo spoke of the Yin Tian Palace with admiration: “I most admire the cultivators of the Yin Tian Palace. Rooted in Ju Shan Zhi, they dedicate themselves to vanquishing demons and slaying monsters, never seeking ease or comfort, and constantly battling evil spirits!”</p><p>Its full name is Zhou Jue Yin Tian Palace, commonly known as Yin Tian Palace, a name derived from the legendary Six Heavenly Palaces of the Daoist tradition.</p><p>Legend holds that the Northern Emperor governs the Underworld Capital, the nine earthly centers, where the Six Heavenly Palaces reside, with Zhou Jue Yin Tian Palace being the foremost.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Yin Tian Palace but, upon hearing Shen Huo's account, listened attentively.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the more factions in Ju Shan Zhi, the better; the more chaotic the situation, the easier it would be to take advantage of the turmoil.</p><p>The group chatted and laughed as their official vessel passed through several checkpoints.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the others did not discuss the details of the rituals, and Qin Sang did not inquire.</p><p>Once they became more familiar, they briefly shared their abilities to facilitate future cooperation.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally presented himself as a physical cultivator, whose abilities are entirely inherent.</p><p>Upon reaching the last fortress on the river, the official vessel dared not proceed further.  Only the four of them and the soldiers remained aboard.</p><p>"The journey ahead is perilous. Be careful, everyone."</p><p>Shi Xuan was the first to rise, stepping out of the cabin.</p><p>Possessing cultivation, Qin Sang and the others followed Shi Xuan, leaping into the air, flying across the river, then speeding along the riverbank before landing.</p><p>Before them lay a desolate landscape.</p><p>In fact, since boarding the official vessel, the scenery along the riverbanks had progressively deteriorated.</p><p>The Dao Court's resources are ultimately limited; it cannot constantly deploy experts to defend against demon-ghost incursions.  Certain territories can be temporarily abandoned if necessary.</p><p>The group traveled across mountains and ridges for several days, finally encountering a continuous range of mountains and treacherous terrain.</p><p>Shi Xuan leaped onto a mountain peak, surveyed the area, and then cautioned, "Conceal your auras. Avoid flying at high altitudes. Without cover, you'll be easily detected by demons and ghosts, who can then ambush you.”</p><p>This warning was primarily directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>Though Shen Huo possessed a fiery temper, he displayed no carelessness.</p><p>Upon learning that the Dao Court and the Demon-Ghost Kingdom confronted each other in the central region of Ju Shan Zhi, where Daoist officials and troops were stationed, providing the greatest safety, this caution came as a surprise.</p><p>Conversely, these remote areas posed a risk of encountering roaming demon soldiers from the Ghost Fang Kingdom; any encounter would be a fight to the death.</p><p>It's a fight to the death!</p><p>Qin Sang readily complied, selecting a suit of fine armor from the Qianjun Ring.</p><p>Shi Xuan couldn't help but glance at it twice, but didn't ask any questions. He signaled everyone to stop and said to Qin Sang, "Brother Dao, you have remarkable patience. I haven't even revealed the contents of the summons, yet you've been able to refrain from asking and have traveled this far with us."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly. "Since you all presented the summons and invited me, it's unlikely to exceed my capabilities.  I'll understand when the time comes. Why waste words?"</p><p>Shen Huo exclaimed, "Well said!"</p><p>Shi Xuan looked deeply at Qin Sang. "Brother Dao trusts us; we are deeply honored. However, not all Daoists are virtuous; some are wicked and commit murder for profit.  Jushan Prefecture is chaotic, a den of iniquity. If the Daoist Court launches a purge, there's even the risk of defectors from Gui Fang country. Brother Dao, you must be vigilant."</p><p>"Thank you for your concern,"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's lack of arrogance, Shi Xuan nodded silently.  "To be frank, this summons from the North Pole Exorcism Academy is for us to attack and destroy a mountain temple, to eliminate several evil gods!"</p><p>"Attack and destroy a mountain temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, instinctively thinking of the mountain gods and land deities under the Daoist Court's jurisdiction.</p><p>Qin Sang still hadn't ascertained the origins of these deities.  Shi Xuan hailed from Jiu Hua Cave Heaven, and Qin Sang had thought he might know more.  Qin Sang had subtly inquired, but even he couldn't explain it, only knowing that the mountain gods, land deities, city gods, and mountain gods were all appointed by the Daoist Court.</p><p>The legendary celestial soldiers and generals were even more mysterious. As Shen Huo had said, cultivators only knew of the guardian deities of the altar, never having witnessed a heavenly god manifesting.</p><p>Evil gods...</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself, so the Daoist Court's appointees are the righteous gods.</p><p>He looked up and surveyed the surrounding mountains.</p><p>Since entering Jushan Prefecture, Qin Sang hadn't discovered any trace of mountain gods or land deities.</p><p>However, Shen Huo had mentioned that in the central part of Jushan Prefecture, where the Daoist Court held territory, there were deities appointed by the Court that could play a significant role in their struggle against Gui Fang.</p><p>As they spoke, Shi Xuan flicked his finger, releasing a point of yellow light that expanded into a talisman before them.</p><p>The summons was in the form of a talisman, containing a brief introduction to the mission and a rough map.</p><p>The map was very crude, only serving to indicate direction.</p><p>It didn't mark any dangers along the route. Jushan Prefecture was rife with demons and ghosts, the situation changing daily, requiring them to be cautious. Fortunately, their destination wasn't too far.</p><p>"From here, head east to the vicinity of the evil temple, then search carefully," Shen Huo pointed forward casually after reviewing it.</p><p>Shi Xuan agreed, put away the talisman, and urged everyone to set off.</p><p>A month later...</p><p>The journey was relatively uneventful.</p><p>In a mountain range, the four gathered, consulting the map to determine their location and finally confirming their target.</p><p>"It's just ahead, less than five hundred miles! What evil god dares to establish a temple here?  Take my sword, you fiend!"</p><p>Shen Huo, shouldering a heavy sword, charged forward, murderous intent radiating from him.</p><p>The others followed closely behind.</p><p>As they neared the temple, they were surprised to find that the ghosts here were unlike those elsewhere. They lived in huts, forming a village.</p><p>They stopped outside the village and saw that the villagers, while still somewhat bestial, had learned basic manners and were cultivating the land around the village.</p><p>In front of the village was a leveled circular plaza with a stone statue.</p><p>Though the carving was crude, it was clearly a monster with a fox head and a human body.</p><p>Offerings were piled before the statue, showing the villagers' fervent worship and daily offerings.</p><p>The group exchanged glances, silently bypassed the village, and continued forward until they reached a steep mountain peak.</p><p>Even from the foot of the mountain, they could see a temple atop the cliff, radiating golden light in the morning sun, yet shrouded in persistent mist.</p><p>Qin Sang had expected the evil god to be a unique entity, but the aura he sensed from the temple was still demonic.</p><p>Furthermore, the demonic aura in the mountain converged into a single stream, indicating a large number of demons.</p><p>Shen Huo could no longer contain himself. After observing the aura for a moment, he stamped his foot, his bones cracking, silently forming a hand seal. His form suddenly swelled, transforming into a giant several dozen feet tall.</p><p>His already ill-fitting robe instantly burst, revealing a suit of armor beneath.</p><p>Shen Huo, broad-faced and broad-eared, raised his heavy sword high, leaped upward, and roared.</p><p>"Your Daoist master is here!"</p><p>At the same time, Shi Xuan and Luo Yin moved.</p><p>Qin Sang paid attention to Shi Xuan, whose cultivation method was the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>Shi Xuan rose into the air, light flashing before him, revealing a blue altar, smaller than a normal military altar, its seal more condensed.</p><p>He pointed, and a stream of light flew from the seal, transforming into a talisman in mid-air.</p><p>(To be continued)</p>
