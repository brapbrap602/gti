<h1>Chapter 1692: A Shared Fate</h1><p>Having escaped Mount Disu, the avatar and its master found themselves within a sword formation, only to feel a sudden chill down their spines.  Looking up, they saw a surging wave of demonic energy; a horde of demons had arrived.</p><p>Leading the charge was a ghastly white figure, humanoid in form but with slender limbs and pointed fingers, resembling some kind of mountain demon or vengeful spirit.  It was surrounded by swirling white smoke, like the essence of ghosts, adding to the terrifying atmosphere.  Its very presence seemed to darken the light.</p><p>This figure was the true form of Bai Xiao the Great Sage, obeying the Saint King's orders by manifesting his demonic body. Flanking him were two demon kings skilled in escape techniques, followed by the rest of their demonic retinue. Among them was a fleshless bone bird with a few sparse, withered feathers clinging to its bony frame, and a four-winged blood serpent with crimson scales.  All were bizarre and monstrous.</p><p>The avatar felt Bai Xiao’s gaze fixed upon them.  Having witnessed Qin Sang and the avatar flee into the sword formation, Bai Xiao was determined to stop their escape.</p><p>With a cold, harsh laugh, Bai Xiao swirled his arms.  The white smoke around him gathered, drawn to some unseen force, coalescing into a slender bone sword.  The four-winged blood serpent and the bone bird, long-time companions who understood their master's intentions, reacted instantly. The serpent spat a blood bead, while the bird unleashed three demonic feathers.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Three attacks streaked through the air – white, yellow, and red – fast as lightning.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A brilliant green light erupted above the sword peak. The formation, recently breached by Qin Sang, shook violently.  The blood bead and demonic feathers struck the formation before the bone sword, unleashing a burst of bloody light, murky yellow energy, and green light, causing the ground to tremble.</p><p>The bone sword followed swiftly, striking a weak point with deadly precision.  Trailing a long plume of white smoke, it descended like a comet.</p><p>The avatar felt a piercing pain, as if locked in the sights of a true blade.  His expression tightened, and he swept his arm back, unleashing a torrent of icy white energy behind him.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>The bone sword pierced the icy river.  </p><p>There was no splash, no impact.  The next moment, a flicker of surprise and rage crossed Bai Xiao’s face. The bone sword had vanished without a trace; he felt no impact whatsoever.  It was utterly inexplicable.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the others, as the ice-soul radiance was deployed, the Sky Eye Butterfly perched on the avatar's shoulder unleashed a beam of Sky Eye divine light. The bone sword, being a manifestation of divine power, disintegrated upon contact.</p><p>Qin Sang, desperate to find a place to heal, didn't want to engage Bai Xiao. The ice-soul radiance not only masked the Sky Eye light but also provided cover.  Using the icy veil for concealment, the avatar scanned his surroundings and burrowed into the earth, flitting between sword peaks.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The avatar, carrying his master, crashed into an unknown valley.  A fierce gust of wind ravaged the vegetation, leaving a trail of destruction.  A clear stream flowed through the valley, beside a simple wooden hut – likely the dwelling of a sword cultivator, now undoubtedly deserted.</p><p>The avatar quickly laid down his master, whose injuries were worsening.  The effects of the two Boiling Snow Pills were taking their toll.  A great cultivator typically only takes one such pill and then immediately begins healing.  The damage to meridians and energy sea is only part of the problem;  the sudden influx of immense energy, without any buffer, impacts the cultivator's foundation, risking its instability with even a moment's delay.</p><p>His master had only managed to endure through sheer physical strength and a powerful spirit far exceeding his cultivation level, thereby stabilizing his body and foundation.</p><p>In reality, his master’s energy wasn't completely depleted; the pills' effects didn't dissipate instantly, and some residual power remained from the two pills.  But this energy was worse than useless; he couldn't control it, struggling merely to prevent his injuries from worsening, unable to spare any attention to anything else.</p><p>To make matters worse, the poison within his body was stirring, trying to exploit the weakness. While the antidote pill's protective aura helped, it relied on Qin Sang's ability to control it.</p><p>His master's face was pale, his brow furrowed, his breathing ragged and weak.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly took flight from Qin Sang's avatar, its wings enabling a swift understanding of the Jinxiang Palace formation's structure.  Landing gently on Qin Sang's shoulder, its soft wings brushed against her cheek, seemingly sensing her pain; the butterfly's wings trembled, a pale blue mist emanating from its Tianmu markings.</p><p>The avatar flashed behind Qin Sang, its hand pressing against her back.  As one being, Qin Sang allowed the avatar's energy to flow into her, aiding in the restoration of her vital energy.</p><p>With the avatar's help, Qin Sang's condition improved slightly. The pain on her face lessened, but her injuries remained severe.  The avatar quickly located several healing pills and fed them to Qin Sang.</p><p>Suddenly, the ground shook violently.  Above, shadowy figures appeared in the air.</p><p>Three powerful demons—Bai Xiao and others—hovered menacingly, their eyes like lightning.  Quickly spotting Qin Sang, the four-winged blood snake let out a shrill cry.  A flash of blood, and it appeared above the sword formation, its long tail lashing out.</p><p>With a deafening *boom*, a powerful shockwave, even through the sword formation, created a whirlwind of energy that ripped through the valley, leveling everything in its path.  Wooden houses collapsed, revealing bare earth. Qin Sang was gone.</p><p>Anticipating the attack, Qin Sang had already escaped the valley, suppressing her aura as she moved erratically, seemingly at random.  In reality, she relied on her knowledge of the formation and the Tianmu butterfly's ability to navigate the array.</p><p>*Boom!*  *Boom!*  *Boom!*…</p><p>The explosions continued relentlessly.  Tracking Qin Sang through the formation was difficult. The demon kings unleashed a barrage of attacks, Bai Xiao, the four-winged blood snake, and the bone bird taking turns, forcing Qin Sang to keep moving.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang roughly grasped the formation's shifts and unexpectedly sensed a hidden location, quickly escaping into it.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A long-hidden chamber was illuminated by a sudden shaft of light.  It appeared the original creator had been careless; the chamber's restrictions were linked to the mountain's protective formation, drawing power from it. This allowed Qin Sang to enter so easily.</p><p>The chamber was sparsely furnished, seemingly unimportant.  Seizing the opportunity, the avatar continued to restore Qin Sang's vital energy, but its mood grew increasingly grave; Qin Sang's condition was worse than anticipated.</p><p>The trip to the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect yielded significant rewards, far exceeding Qin Sang's expectations—provided she lived to enjoy them.  The depletion of her true energy wasn't a major concern; she had spirit stones to replenish it.  Against the Saint King, the avatar had no chance to act, and she slowly recovered using other pills.  The high-grade spirit stones were reserved for Qin Sang, to be absorbed once her condition improved.</p><p>But the problem wasn't true energy; Qin Sang couldn't move without first suppressing her internal injuries.  Even with the Sun God Tree, the avatar, alone, could repel a demon saint, but how could it withstand a siege by many demon kings?  They could easily encircle and exhaust her, waiting for the Qinghu Saint King to return.</p><p>Now, she could only use the formation to stall them, unsure if she could hold out until Qin Sang recovered.</p><p>"Must I sacrifice either myself or the avatar?" Qin Sang mused bitterly.  If forced to choose, the avatar would be the one to give up.</p><p>...</p><p>On the edge of Jinxiang Palace.</p><p>An old nun, seeing Qin Sang fleeing towards her, felt a sense of foreboding.  She didn't know the extent of the three avatars' demise on the Qinghu Saint King, but she didn't want to be involved in their conflict, let alone risk the wrath of the transformed deity. The sect's top experts were present; any collateral damage would be catastrophic for Yan Yue Monastery.  Other cultivators exploring Jinxiang Palace had already scattered far and wide.</p><p>She immediately crushed a jade talisman, ordering a retreat.  Fortunately, her junior sisters had sent word that they had broken most of the secret chamber's restrictions and obtained significant treasures.</p><p>Warned of the danger, they didn't dare linger, fleeing swiftly.  After escorting her junior sisters, the old nun looked west but found Liuli missing.</p><p>"Did she see the battle at Di Shou Mountain and detour?"</p><p>As the thought crossed her mind, a cold voice echoed from the shadows nearby. "Abbess."</p><p>Liuli appeared from the shadows, having arrived sometime ago, avoiding open flight and suppressing her aura.  Seeing the battle between Qin Sang and the demon deities, she had hidden herself.</p><p>A secret technique from the Listening Snow Tower, used by Qin Sang to create her phantom body, and the phantom’s cultivation of the Ice Soul Divine Light, shared a common origin.  Their auras were similar, and if left unmasked, the demon's powerful mage would detect it, implicating Qin Sang.</p><p>“It’s good you’re back!”</p><p>The old nun’s expression softened. She said in a low voice, “We can’t stay here long! While the gains weren't as expected, this is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. Upon our return, dedicate yourself to quiet cultivation and understanding; your abilities will surely improve greatly. Be decisive, and don't let greed control you.”</p><p>These words weren't just for Liuli; they were a warning to the other disciples who harbored discontent.</p><p>Once the old monk suppressed the demon and had free hands, he would certainly target them, the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.  Lingering this long was already risky.</p><p>“Such a pity! With a little more time, we could have broken the final sword energy seal on that secret chamber! Based on our previous findings, it definitely contains invaluable sword cultivator treasures, possibly even the ‘Taiyuan Golden Gang Sword Scripture’!” a young nun lamented.</p><p>“Sister Ying, you mapped the protective mountain formation of the Jinxiang Hall, right? Give me the map, and I’ll retrieve the treasure from the secret chamber,” Liuli offered, extending her hand.</p><p>Her words surprised everyone.</p><p>The old nun waved her whisk, stopping Liuli.  “Sister, don't be reckless…”</p><p>Liuli interrupted the old nun, insisting, “Since joining the monastery, I've received much care but contributed little.  The cultivation techniques and arts I practice aren't from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect’s lineage, and others don't know I joined Yan Yue Monastery; I won't be targeted.”</p><p>The others were tempted, the young nun especially eager, already producing a jade slip with anticipation.</p><p>The old nun said nothing, her gaze fixed on Liuli.</p><p>After a long moment, she looked back at the Jinxiang Hall, but not towards the secret chamber. Then, noticing the suddenly turbulent lake suspended in the sky, she said to a female lay disciple beside her,  "This place is fraught with danger. We can't let Sister Liuli go alone. I'll stay behind to provide support. Sister, take the others and leave first.”</p><p>The lay disciple was startled.</p><p>Before she could respond, the old nun had already taken the jade slip from the young nun, leaving no room for argument, urging them to leave.</p><p>“The manor is crowded. Don't use the teleportation array; exit through the main passage. Other factions are either held back by the ancient demon or busy searching for treasures, unable to spare attention. You shouldn't encounter any obstacles. Remember not to linger.”</p><p>They all understood; the teleportation array was reserved for the Abbess and Liuli. The nuns had no objections.</p><p>The young nun, a mixture of hope and worry, said, “We found several secret passages in the Jinxiang Hall…Abbess, Sister Liuli, please be careful.”</p><p>The old nun's tone was serious, her command as Abbess unquestionable. The lay disciple immediately beckoned her fellow nuns, bidding farewell to the two, suppressing their auras, and swiftly departed toward the entrance of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Watching them leave, the old nun withdrew her gaze, handing the jade slip to Liuli.  “Sister, have you considered the dangers within?”</p><p>“Thank you, Abbess.”</p><p>Liuli accepted the jade slip, understanding the Abbess might have noticed something.</p><p>Joining Yan Yue Monastery was a coincidence, forging a connection with the Abbess. Aside from the restriction against leaving, the rules weren't strict, and the Abbess aided her in comprehending Buddhist principles—all things Liuli needed.  Thus, she accepted the invitation.</p><p>She didn't harbor deep feelings for Yan Yue Monastery.</p><p>Nor did she hold high expectations.</p><p>With the demon saint's authority above them, what right did she have to make the old nun gamble the sect’s survival? Regardless of the Abbess's intentions, her presence was a godsend. So Liuli thanked her sincerely.</p><p>Liuli's mind delved into the jade slip.</p><p>They had spent time exploring the Jinxiang Hall. Combined with the sect's existing scriptures, they had a good grasp of the protective mountain formation's structure and flow, with many details that could be utilized.</p><p>Meanwhile, demonic energy filled the Jinxiang Hall.</p><p>Bai Xiao, unable to find Qin Sang, struggled to search across the protective formation.  He decided to besiege a large section of the sword peaks, trapping Qin Sang within.</p><p>The demons formed a formation, each occupying a sword peak, watching vigilantly.</p><p>Four-winged blood snakes and bone birds launched continuous attacks, while Bai Xiao remained idle, emitting white smoke that rose, forming a white sphere the size of a head, eventually transforming into an eye-like shape.</p><p>The eye floated, rotating in any direction, unnervingly inspecting below to prevent Qin Sang's escape.</p><p>The demons then attacked the formation simultaneously.</p><p>The peaks trembled, and the formation surged.</p><p>Liuli and the old nun had infiltrated the Jinxiang Hall.  The old nun was surprised by Liuli's clear direction; she quickly moved near the demon formation, but dared not get too close due to the hovering demon eye.</p><p>Then, Liuli stopped at a certain spot, quietly unleashing the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>Her Ice Soul Divine Light was inherently silent. With the disruption caused by the attack on the formation as cover, no one noticed. The divine light infiltrated with the formation's movements, targeting Qin Sang’s hiding place.</p><p>She had discovered in the North Sea that due to the flaws in her evil technique, within a certain range, she could sense Qin Sang through a mark. Earlier, Qin Sang had been in the Emperor's Mandate Mountain, concealed by the Five Elements Divine Prohibition, so the evil technique mark hadn't reacted.</p><p>In a certain dark room.</p><p>Qin Sang’s main body's aura stabilized, showing signs of improvement.  She was about to plan her escape when she opened her eyes in surprise.</p>
