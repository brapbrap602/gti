<h1></h1><p>Two incarnations clashed.</p><p>Qin Sang's previous cautious approach paid off.</p><p>The stone statue's incarnation only knew one divine ability.</p><p>The external incarnation no longer hid its strength. All color vanished from its eyes, leaving them crystalline and transparent. A fissure cracked open in each, and two piercing, sword-like beams of light shot forth.</p><p>The beams solidified mid-air, transforming into two chains of glacial crystal.</p><p>At this moment, the stone statue's incarnation was still mechanically using frigid energy attacks, its divine ability singular.</p><p>The Fissure Eye Ice Chains were ranked among the top three divine abilities recorded in the *Netherfrost Canon*.</p><p>The glacial crystal chains pierced through the frigid energy.</p><p>Sensing danger, the stone statue's incarnation retreated swiftly, its eyes undergoing the same transformation. It instantly mimicked the Fissure Eye Ice Chains.</p><p>However, it was merely an imitator, and losing the initiative in a clash of techniques was fatal.</p><p>*Clatter!*</p><p>The glacial crystal chains rapidly coiled, forming a chain prison around the stone statue's incarnation.</p><p>Simultaneously, the external incarnation swiftly completed an incantation seal. Frigid light descended from the heavens, and boundless frigid energy filled the gaps in the glacial crystal chains, isolating the stone statue's incarnation from the battlefield.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The prison shook violently. Cracks appeared on the glacial crystal chains as the stone statue's incarnation's counterattack proved equally fierce.</p><p>The external incarnation's goal was only to temporarily trap the stone statue incarnation. It did not press its advantage but turned its gaze towards its main body, its hand seals changing again.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was very close to the python banner.</p><p>It appeared he intended to repeat his previous tactic, eliminating the stone statue's helper first.</p><p>Copper cauldron, demonic flames, ice fan...</p><p>A series of attacks arrived one after another.</p><p>The stone statue instinctively tried to stop Qin Sang.</p><p>At that very instant, a peculiar glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. Without any warning, he suddenly changed direction. Treading upon the Lotus Seal, he skillfully evaded the jade-white profound light. With a twist of his body, he charged directly towards the main body of the stone statue, defying its attacks.</p><p>The stone statue showed no joy or anger, its hollow eyes filled only with battle intent.</p><p>It showed no surprise at Qin Sang's unexpected move. The ice fan in its hand blazed with light, and the banner flapped fiercely.</p><p>A flame dragon and an ice dragon intertwined, roaring towards the heavens with earth-shattering momentum, intent on devouring Qin Sang.</p><p>*Crack! Crack!*</p><p>Just then, a faint blue light emerged in the void before Qin Sang. In an instant, it transformed into an ice mirror, crystalline and clear, yet seemingly incredibly heavy.</p><p>Another major divine ability of the external incarnation—the Profound Ice Mirror!</p><p>This divine ability was simple and unadorned, yet exceptionally sturdy.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The stone statue's attack struck the Profound Ice Mirror head-on.</p><p>In an instant, flames and frigid energy flew in all directions, interspersed with fragments of the Profound Ice Mirror of varying sizes. The platform was a scene of utter chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang remained exceptionally calm. With the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he clearly saw the turbulent energy flows. His body was like smoke, weaving through them, rapidly approaching the stone statue.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the stone statue mimicked the Lotus Seal, its movements as refined and elusive as Qin Sang's. While maneuvering, the copper cauldron above the stone statue aimed at Qin Sang, firing continuous bolts of azure profound light.</p><p>Unable to get close to the stone statue, Qin Sang showed no sign of anxiety. His gaze flickered, and he suddenly pointed two fingers at the stone statue.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Heavenly lightning descended!</p><p>With a *clang*, the Lightning Control Technique struck the copper cauldron squarely.</p><p>Under the frenzied assault of the violent lightning energy, the copper cauldron was sent flying. The stone statue below staggered, nearly falling to the ground, in a most undignified state.</p><p>However, the stone statue was still not seriously injured. It immediately pointed a finger back at Qin Sang.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>As expected, it had also learned the Lightning Control Technique.</p><p>The next moment, two bolts of lightning converged in mid-air.</p><p>The instant the heavenly lightning descended, Qin Sang activated his long-prepared Lightning Evasion Technique, successfully avoiding it and emerging unscathed.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>On another platform.</p><p>Cultivator Yue faced the stone statue, growing increasingly alarmed with each exchange. Realizing he couldn't defeat the stone statue in a short time, he, like Qin Sang, quickly analyzed the essence of this trial.</p><p>Without hesitation, he slapped his Mustard Seed Bag, and a palm-sized gourd flew out. He prepared to unleash his trump card, giving everyone else a surprise!</p><p>Just then, he saw the stone statue make a strange gesture, raising its finger and pointing at him.</p><p>Cultivator Yue was stunned, suddenly realizing the danger. A sense of impending doom surged within him.</p><p>He didn't dare hesitate. He quickly flicked the top of his head, and white energy surged from his Baihui acupoint, forming a large hand.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The lightning struck the large hand, directly shattering it, reverting it to white energy.</p><p>Cultivator Yue's body trembled. He felt as if he had been struck by a tremendous force, thrown heavily onto the platform. He slid backward uncontrollably, his entire body numb, his figure extremely disheveled.</p><p>Before he could regain his footing and adjust, his vision was filled with light. The stone statue transformed into a bolt of lightning, its speed increasing to an astonishing degree, closing in instantly!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Black spiritual flames swept across the sky.</p><p>Cultivator Yue's expression changed drastically.</p><p>He had been considered a genius since childhood, especially after successfully forming his Nascent Soul after only ten years of secluded cultivation. He was held in high regard, spending years in secluded cultivation on Heavenly Mountain, undisturbed. In just over a hundred years, he broke through again.</p><p>However, this resulted in a lack of practical experience.</p><p>Over the years, the experts of the Heavenly Mountain lineage had taken turns sparring with him, but they couldn't provide him with life-or-death crises. Moreover, there were no Grand Cultivators in the Heavenly Mountain lineage.</p><p>At this moment, facing the Lightning Control Technique, the demonic flames, and the Lightning Evasion Technique in quick succession, a sense of fluster and disarray, absent for many years, reappeared on Cultivator Yue.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The black spiritual flames swept out.</p><p>The stone statue suddenly stopped in place. All the phenomena caused by its magical treasures and divine abilities vanished instantly, as if they had never existed. The place where Cultivator Yue had been standing was now empty.</p><p>Only a curse remained.</p><p>"Your mother!"</p><p>...</p><p>At the exit of the archway.</p><p>A meteor-like light shot out from the depths of the white mist. Then, a figure tumbled out, thrown out of the archway. It was Cultivator Yue.</p><p>He took a deep breath, calming the chaotic energy within his body. He carefully checked himself, confirming he hadn't sustained any serious injuries.</p><p>Just now, at the moment the stone statue's final attack was about to land, he was teleported out.</p><p>Staring resentfully at the depths of the white mist, Cultivator Yue's face revealed a hint of unwillingness. Even though he was a genius, his cultivation speed unparalleled in the Profound Heaven Palace, he still didn't want to miss any opportunity to improve himself.</p><p>Alas, he was inferior in skill, and it was all for naught.</p><p>At this moment, Cultivator Yue sensed a tremor from a token in his Mustard Seed Bag. Remembering the instructions of Palace Master Shang, he was about to reach for the token when he sensed something.</p><p>He stopped, glanced at the ruins of an ancient hall not far away, snorted, and rode his遁light, soaring into the sky.</p><p>Not long after he left, a white shimmer appeared in the ruins, revealing two figures, a man and a woman, both dressed in white, with ethereal auras.</p><p>"He discovered us! As expected of the genius hailed as a once-in-a-millennium talent of the Profound Heaven Palace, he easily saw through my Thousand Illusion Refraction Mirror."</p><p>A treasure mirror with an uneven surface floated before the woman. She looked in the direction Cultivator Yue had flown, her eyes filled with admiration.</p><p>"So what if he's a genius? Isn't he just like us, defeated by someone else? Besides, Junior Sister Yu, you didn't even fully activate this magical treasure. It's a pity this trial is so unique that your magical treasure couldn't display its true power. We were also forced to separate, and our previous agreement to join forces came to nothing..."</p><p>The man was as unwilling as Cultivator Yue, his tone filled with helplessness.</p><p>As he spoke, the man suddenly coughed violently, the energy within his body thrown into chaos.</p><p>The woman was startled, "Senior Brother Zhang, you..."</p><p>"It's nothing!"</p><p>The man waved his hand, smiling bitterly. "I forcibly used a secret technique to raise my cultivation for this opportunity, possessing the cultivation level but lacking the corresponding comprehension. I will fall back to the early Nascent Soul stage and must spend at least several decades in quiet cultivation to recover. It's truly not worth the loss!"</p><p>This situation was commonplace in the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Before the opening of the Sacred Land, each lineage had three hundred years to prepare, ample time to acquire secret techniques to temporarily raise one's cultivation level, which were not particularly precious or rare.</p><p>Therefore, the woman was not surprised. She said with empathy, "I didn't expect the final winner to be an outsider. I wonder why Palace Master Shang didn't appear. I heard he forcibly broke through in the past, using methods even more radical than yours, Senior Brother. Did he suffer lasting damage, realize he had no chance, and give up voluntarily? I originally considered him and Junior Brother Yue as formidable rivals."</p><p>"Palace Master Shang's disruption of the wedding ceremony was likely to pave the way for Junior Brother Yue. Facing the suppression of the ancient restrictions, those who have participated a second time and won are few and far between in the records. It's normal for Palace Master Shang to give up. With the demonic invasion and the chaos in the Sacred Land, we still need Palace Master Shang and the others to strategize."</p><p>The man pondered.</p><p>"Did Senior Brother Zhang forget this person?"</p><p>The woman pointed her chin towards the Body Cleansing Pool. "He's an outsider, also subject to the suppression."</p><p>The man said meaningfully, "Junior Sister Yu, haven't you figured out this person's background yet?"</p><p>"What background?" The woman was stunned.</p><p>"There's always been a rumor within the sect that the Sacred Artifact was lost for a period of time ten years ago. It was later recovered by the Grand Elder and the other Elders, but the process wasn't smooth. They reportedly encountered a mysterious expert, a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator whose strength rivaled a Grand Cultivator. He embarrassed the Elders, forcing them to make a deal with him before they could retrieve the Sacred Artifact. I once subtly questioned Elder Lan, and he didn't deny it. Later, I specifically gathered some information about the Ten Thousand Demons Convention. This person uses a type of black demonic flame..."</p><p>The man paused, then sneered, "Since when did mid-Nascent Soul cultivators become so common, with two popping up one after another? The Elders probably suspected it long ago, but it involves one of the four main lineages and the Grand Elder. The implications are too great, and it would expose the Elder Council's failure to protect the Sacred Artifact, so they're all playing dumb."</p><p>The woman's eyes widened with increasing surprise. She sighed, "Facing such an opponent, we didn't lose unjustly. However, whether that grand wedding was real or fake, this person's connection to the Profound Heaven Palace is unbreakable. With this person around, he might be the key to the sect overcoming this calamity."</p><p>The two fell silent, gazing at the archway for a moment, then departed together.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the white mist.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his arm, retracting the Demonic Banner.</p><p>He was the only one left on the platform. Just now, the stone statue had acquired a new divine ability, its strength greatly increasing. Qin Sang was locked in a fierce battle, but after a few exchanges, the stone statue stopped moving.</p><p>A smile appeared on Qin Sang's lips. As he expected, the others had been eliminated.</p><p>A gentle force appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He relinquished resistance and was pushed by the gentle force, flying off the platform and into the white mist.</p><p>Before long, his feet landed on solid ground.</p><p>Before him was a swirling immortal mist. From the depths of the mist, a faint golden light emanated. Within the golden light was the shadow of a peculiar spirit tree.</p><p>It was a type of spirit tree Qin Sang had never seen before. Facing the tree's shadow, Qin Sang felt as if the golden light illuminated his entire body, penetrating his mind. The energy within him immediately calmed, his true essence as tranquil as water, flowing smoothly through his meridians.</p><p>Qin Sang could almost hear the sound of his true essence flowing within him.</p><p>His eyes gleamed with wonder, and he instinctively walked forward.</p><p>When he drew near, the tree's shadow and the golden light suddenly vanished. Everything before seemed like an illusion.</p><p>He stopped, savoring the feeling from just now. Only then did he notice that at the base of the tree's shadow was a clear spring. The water was so clear it seemed non-existent.</p><p>"Is this the Body Cleansing Pool?"</p><p>Qin Sang had heard descriptions from Liuli before, but seeing it in person was still somewhat surprising. The Body Cleansing Pool was so small, one person could fill it completely.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he stepped into the Body Cleansing Pool.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>Everything around him disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he had entered a vast, unknown world. The void was filled with five-colored light, yet it was utterly silent, inducing a desire to fall into a deep slumber.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly felt a subtle, tingling sensation.</p><p>He then realized that a strange force had surrounded him, omnipresent and all-penetrating, entering his body through every pore.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated both his body and his essence. His physical body was powerful, and he was indifferent to this level of pain.</p><p>As time passed, the tingling sensation intensified, eventually penetrating deep into his meridians, spreading along them to his Sea of Qi, and even reaching his Nascent Soul!</p><p>Qin Sang's forehead beaded with sweat, his entire body tense.</p><p>He could no longer ignore the intense pain within his body.</p><p>His meridians felt as if they were being cut by knives, his true essence like a flood breaching a dam, rampaging through everything.</p><p>The source of the flood was his Sea of Qi.</p><p>Under the influence of that strange force, Qin Sang's Sea of Qi had long lost its usual tranquility, becoming incredibly turbulent, with colossal waves crashing incessantly.</p><p>This was only the beginning.</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified to discover that his Nascent Soul was also showing signs of losing control.</p><p>That force had somehow invaded his Nascent Soul.</p><p>The Nascent Soul's features were contorted, as if it were undergoing cultivation deviation, emitting silent roars.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The true essence within his Sea of Qi surged wave after wave, pounding against Qin Sang's mind, the intense pain襲assailing him in relentless bursts.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang finally understood why the Body Cleansing Pool required a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator. If an early Nascent Soul cultivator encountered this kind of impact, their Nascent Soul would likely collapse on the spot.</p><p>The Body Cleansing Pool was an opportunity, but it also concealed danger.</p><p>That strange force seemed endless, continuously entering his body.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly was also in Qin Sang's Sea of Qi, ignored by that force. She sensed her master was in danger but was powerless to help. She could only obey his instructions and hide in a corner, the rapid fluttering of her wings indicating her anxiety.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists tightly, his expression ferocious.</p><p>He forgot everything, focusing all his effort on keeping his Nascent Soul from dispersing.</p><p>Every strand of the strange force that entered was like a needle, a dagger, wreaking havoc within his Nascent Soul. Compared to this, the pain in his meridians and Sea of Qi was insignificant.</p><p>His Nascent Soul repeatedly approached the brink of collapse, only to be pulled back by Qin Sang's sheer will.</p><p>Time and time again, breaking and then reforming.</p><p>Qin Sang had the illusion that he was repeatedly going through the process of consolidating his Nascent Soul.</p><p>He had become numb, unable to count how many times he had faced the crisis of his Nascent Soul collapsing.</p><p>...</p><p>Just as Qin Sang entered the Body Cleansing Pool.</p><p>On another floating mountain, the light of magical treasures and divine abilities flashed continuously, and the sounds of battle shook the heavens.</p><p>The Ice Wind Cave was located on this mountain.</p><p>This place could increase the chances of Core Formation cultivators forming their Nascent Soul, making it one of the most treasured locations of the Profound Heaven Palace, crucial to the sect's inheritance.</p><p>Even though many personnel had to be allocated to gather treasures from various locations, the Palace Master and the Grand Elder still dispatched several Nascent Soul cultivators to protect the disciples entering the Ice Wind Cave.</p><p>As expected, they encountered competitors.</p><p>The other side was led by Dongyang Bo, and most of the Nascent Soul cultivators, like him, had no hope of further advancement, using their remaining time to pave the way for their successors.</p><p>The two sides clashed immediately upon disagreement.</p><p>The entrance to the Ice Wind Cave was a sheer cliff.</p><p>In the center of the cliff, a ball of blue light was currently spinning continuously.</p><p>When the light stabilized, the Ice Wind Cave would open!</p><p>Core Formation cultivators were not qualified to join the battle, standing on either side of the cliff, glaring at each other, but maintaining their composure, not daring to act rashly, constantly monitoring the changes in the light.</p><p>They occasionally glanced at the battlefield in front of the cliff.</p><p>With insufficient cultivation, they could no longer clearly distinguish the figures within, nor could they tell which side had the upper hand. They could only wait anxiously.</p><p>"Wu Junzi, you dare to cause trouble in my Profound Heaven Palace's Sacred Land? Aren't you afraid I'll destroy your Black Wu Island once I get out!"</p><p>A stern shout rang out from the battlefield.</p><p>It was followed by a burst of laughter, filled with mockery: "This is led by Old Man Hunmo and the Great Sage Tianpeng. If you have the ability, kill them first! This old man will be waiting for you on Black Wu Island. Let's see how capable your Profound Heaven Palace is, whether you can sweep the Boundless Sea! You've occupied this secret realm for long enough. It's time to share the benefits!"</p><p>This statement immediately drew a chorus of agreement.</p><p>"Bullshit Sacred Land! This is an unowned ancient secret realm, which should be shared by the cultivators of the three realms of the North Sea. You shamelessly named it a Sacred Land!"</p><p>"That's right!"</p><p>"It should be shared!"</p><p>...</p><p>Just then.</p><p>The light on the cliff changed, splitting into two, forming a Taiji pattern, slowly rotating. A cave entrance gradually appeared in the center.</p><p>"Enter!"</p><p>Qiu Mubai heard Dongyang Bo's voice and immediately charged towards the light. Then, a stream of light shot out from the battlefield, clearing a path for him.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's opponent's eyes flickered, and he suddenly changed his target, directing his treasure saber to fiercely slash at Qiu Mubai.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's expression changed slightly. He hurriedly urged his Diamond Carving, blocking the saber strike for Qiu Mubai.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>The Diamond Carving's light flickered.</p><p>Dongyang Bo tasted sweetness in his throat, but he forcibly suppressed it.</p><p>However, his opponent still noticed his abnormality, laughing heartily: "Decrepit body, yet you dare to be so arrogant!"</p><p>This person fought Dongyang Bo alone and was quite wary of him. But during the fight, he faintly sensed that something was wrong with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>After a brief probe just now, it was confirmed to be a bluff!</p><p>Qiu Mubai successfully dashed into the cave entrance. A bone-chilling wind assaulted him, and at the same time, he heard the laughter behind him. His eyes revealed a look of anxiety.</p><p>He knew his master's current state.</p><p>After arriving in the North Sea, his master had aged rapidly, especially in the past ten years. The situation had worsened, and with each closed-door cultivation, he aged further.</p><p>He was unwilling to believe it, but he had to admit the fact.</p><p>Now, fighting fiercely to help him contend for the Ice Wind Cave was adding frost to his master's already snowy condition.</p><p>Qiu Mubai clenched his teeth, suppressing his worry. He rushed into the Ice Wind Cave without looking back.</p><p>The sooner he emerged, the sooner his master could escape.</p><p>A fork appeared ahead. He randomly chose one path and found a circular ice platform inside, with a cushion woven from ice silkworm silk on top.</p><p>Qiu Mubai leaped onto the cushion. Just as he sat down, the platform vibrated, and blue light surged, enveloping him.</p><p>...</p><p>An incense stick's worth of time later.</p><p>Qiu Mubai's figure appeared at the cave entrance, his expression complex, a mixture of joy and anxiety.</p><p>"Did you succeed?"</p><p>A familiar figure appeared before him.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Qiu Mubai was overjoyed, nodding repeatedly.</p><p>Dongyang Bo revealed a gratified expression, grabbing Qiu Mubai's shoulder. "Let's go!"</p><p>Qiu Mubai saw that his master was unharmed, his heart greatly relieved. Just as he was about to say something, he suddenly saw a figure chasing after them. Then, a white light was struck out by Dongyang Bo.</p><p>It was his life-bound magical treasure, the Diamond Carving.</p><p>The next moment, Qiu Mubai witnessed a scene he would never forget.</p><p>The Diamond Carving emitted mournful cries, suddenly shattering. An extremely dense white light, radiating an aura of destruction, attracted everyone's attention, stinging Qiu Mubai's eyes.</p><p>"Madman!"</p><p>The pursuer didn't expect Dongyang Bo to self-detonate his life-bound magical treasure. His expression changed drastically, and he hastily retreated.</p><p>Qiu Mubai's eyes were bloodshot. He felt his master's aura rapidly declining, but the hand on his shoulder was as firm as an iron hoop, carrying him away from the scene.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Two figures landed on an unnamed floating mountain.</p><p>Dongyang Bo staggered.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Qiu Mubai hurriedly supported Dongyang Bo, his face filled with anxiety and remorse.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had Qiu Mubai help him sit down, looking at him, his gaze gradually softening. "I've been wrong about two people, but I finally wasn't wrong about you. With this opportunity, your formation of the Nascent Soul should be guaranteed."</p><p>"If I had known... I would rather not have this opportunity."</p><p>Qiu Mubai said through gritted teeth.</p><p>"Don't talk nonsense," Dongyang Bo scolded with a stern face. "You know my condition. Living nearly three hundred years longer is already defying fate! Dying in an ancient secret realm is not a grievance. After I die, take my belongings and quickly leave the Sacred Land... I have a few words to say."</p><p>Qiu Mubai's eyes were filled with tears. He knelt heavily, "This disciple vows to revitalize Shaohua Mountain in this lifetime!"</p><p>Dongyang Bo chuckled, "Who said I want you to revitalize Shaohua Mountain?"</p><p>Qiu Mubai was stunned.</p><p>Dongyang Bo sighed, "I once made this vow before your grandmaster, making the sect my responsibility. I only planned for myself once in my life, but..."</p><p>He paused, his face revealing a look of melancholy. "Everything in the world is an illusion, only the Great Dao is eternal! You should not follow in my footsteps. I command you to henceforth focus on cultivation, pursuing the Immortal Dao. Shaohua Mountain has Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng to look after it. It will eventually prosper."</p><p>"Junior Brother Qin?"</p><p>Qiu Mubai looked up in astonishment.</p><p>He had personally experienced the upheaval of the Bronze Hall.</p><p>After that, Junior Brother Qin became a taboo in Shaohua Mountain, Junior Brother Mu was confined to Cleansing Moon Peak, and Miss Chenyan also left Shaohua Mountain not long after, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Qiu Mubai was both talented and intelligent. Although he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he could guess a few things, but he could only pretend not to know.</p><p>Decades ago.</p><p>Junior Brother Qin made a strong return, achieving astonishing accomplishments and becoming a top expert in the Northern Star Region.</p><p>His master, on the other hand,黯然took him and left for the North Sea.</p><p>Qiu Mubai had always thought his master was worried about Junior Brother Qin's revenge and chose to avoid him.</p><p>Now, hearing these words, had his master and Junior Brother Qin reconciled?</p><p>"When you become a Nascent Soul cultivator, you'll understand that there are no grudges or grievances in the world that cannot be resolved, and the path of cultivation isn't all about life and death."</p><p>Dongyang Bo pretended to be profound, his tone shifting, his eyes revealing a look of longing. "The ascension of the Purple Micro Palace is an unprecedented change, and there must be a reason, but the time is not yet ripe. I have a premonition that the world will usher in a brand new era, and it won't be long! Perhaps, the opportunity for the Immortal Dao will also appear, but unfortunately, I won't be able to see it! You and Qin Sang are both fortunate. You shouldn't be trapped by the sect, always scheming and striving! Remember, focus on cultivating diligently, waiting for the time to come. When you have achieved success in your cultivation, it won't be too late to give back to the sect!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking.</p><p>Dongyang Bo looked at Qiu Mubai with a smile, crystalline fragments flaking off his face.</p><p>In an instant, his entire body shattered like a mirror, scattering with the wind, leaving behind a Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>"This disciple... obeys!"</p><p>Tears streamed down Qiu Mubai's eyes. He kowtowed, thanking his master for his grace, bidding his final farewell. He grabbed the Mustard Seed Bag, turned resolutely, and obeyed the command to leave the Sacred Land.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after Qiu Mubai left.</p><p>A faint sigh echoed in the void.</p>
