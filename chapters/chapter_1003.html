<h1>Chapter 995: Important Matters</h1><p>The two continued to break the fire curse.</p><p>Ultimately, they did not completely remove the fire curse. Bai refined the demonic fire curse mark and left a seal within Qin Sang's body, preparing to refine the fire curse seed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, give me the spirit herbs first.  I've overdrawn my energy several times, impacting myself quite a bit. I need to stabilize my life essence before I can refine the fire curse seed."</p><p>Bai sensed his internal state, his expression slightly changing.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly handed Bai the pouch containing the spirit herbs.</p><p>These spirit herbs were collected by Manager Liu of the Qiongyu Trading Company. They had taken them when they raided the company.  To avoid arousing Qin Sang's suspicion, Manager Liu had tried his best, collecting about a third of the herbs on the list.</p><p>"There are too few spirit herbs. After we leave this place, I will definitely help you acquire the rest."</p><p>Qin Sang promised.</p><p>He and the Qiongyu Trading Company were sworn enemies; their previous relationship was unusable, so he could only purchase them himself. Fortunately, having defeated six Golden Core cultivators including the Left Deputy Commander, his gains were plentiful, and he had enough spirit stones.</p><p>Bai took the spirit herbs, nodding. "As a temporary measure, this is enough."</p><p>After Bai returned to his cave.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged on a cushion, lost in thought.</p><p>The remaining fire curse in his body was minimal, and with Bai's seal, the hidden danger was removed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang, once bitten by a snake, feared the rope for ten years.  He felt it was safer to stay in the storm zone. This secret realm seemed stable; he'd leave after Bai refined the fire curse seed.</p><p>Finally able to rest properly.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to remain vigilant, then lay down fully clothed and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>The secret realm had no day or night.</p><p>He slept for an unknown amount of time.</p><p>After waking, Qin Sang felt refreshed. He sat cross-legged in meditation, circulating his cultivation technique, refining his true essence, and eliminating accumulated impurities.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>Qin Sang finally recovered completely, only missing his avatar and two-headed… causing him some discomfort.</p><p>Thinking of Old Devil Mu, Qin Sang's expression darkened.</p><p>He reviewed the events of the past few days.</p><p>Old Devil Mu had a strong obsession with spiritual flames. He had first subdued the Winter Nether Cold Flame left by Winter Nether Elder, and then coveted the Nine Nether Demon Fire, leading him to target Qin Sang.</p><p>"A crime to possess treasures!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>The two had no grievances between them.</p><p>Yet he had become a thorn in Old Devil Mu's side.</p><p>Ultimately, he was simply outmatched and at the mercy of others.</p><p>After feeding the Sky-Eyed Butterfly and the fat silkworm, Qin Sang left the cave. Seeing that Bai was still inactive, he guessed that it would take some time for him to recover, and refining the fire curse seed would also require considerable effort.</p><p>Qin Sang flew up, spending a whole day carefully repairing the ancient restrictions of the secret realm, then returned to his cave.</p><p>The Qianjun Ring flashed.</p><p>A piece of decaying wood flew out—the Soul-Nourishing Wood, radiating a faint soul light.</p><p>Unable to leave for the time being, Qin Sang decided to first re-refine his Ebony Sword to quickly improve his cultivation and break through to the late Golden Core stage. If he encountered a strong enemy again, he wouldn't be so helpless.</p><p>The last time he refined the Ebony Sword, he was still at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>He had spent about twenty years using the thin piece of Nether Blood Mulberry.</p><p>This time, the Soul-Nourishing Wood was larger, but his cultivation and weapon refinement skills had greatly improved, so it certainly wouldn't take that long.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to see what changes the Soul-Nourishing Wood would bring to the Ebony Sword.</p><p>He took a section of Soul-Nourishing Wood, summoned the Ebony Sword, and recalled the previous process of melting the spiritual wood.</p><p>'Rise!'</p><p>Qin Sang pointed at the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The sword hummed pleasantly, the Ebony Sword flashing over to the Soul-Nourishing Wood, its sword light gently enveloping the wood.</p><p>Then Qin Sang closed his eyes and urged the Ebony Sword to melt the Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>The cave was silent.</p><p>Time flowed slowly.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Soul-Nourishing Wood was 'dissolving', the Ebony Sword about to absorb the extremely pure primordial wood spirit into its body.</p><p>Previously, it was at this moment that the abnormality occurred, the spiritual wood essence being tainted by the Nether Blood Mulberry, losing all its spirituality.</p><p>'Hum...'</p><p>The Ebony Sword trembled slightly.</p><p>The Soul-Nourishing Wood merged into the Ebony Sword.</p><p>At that moment, a strange streak of blood-red suddenly appeared.</p><p>"It's coming!"</p><p>Qin Sang whispered inwardly.</p><p>As the streak of blood-red was about to fall upon the Soul-Nourishing Wood, the Soul-Nourishing Wood suddenly emitted a strong soul light. The blood-red color seemed to hit an unyielding wall, firmly blocked by the soul light, unable to penetrate even slightly.</p><p>Throughout the process, the blood-red color lingered, but was helpless against the Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>Finally, the Ebony Sword absorbed the Soul-Nourishing Wood, transforming into a transparent sword embryo, floating before Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's face lit up. He withdrew the Ebony Sword to nurture it with his divine sense, and then proceeded to refine the Ebony Sword while simultaneously comprehending the Killing Talisman.</p><p>…</p><p>One year later.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in the storm zone.  He summoned his Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn to orient himself, then flew on, taking out a dusty-looking orb.</p><p>“I didn’t expect it would take this long…”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, twirling the orb between his fingers. Bai had stabilized his life force, then failed repeatedly for over a dozen attempts before finally refining this fire-curse seed.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, they had been stranded in the storm zone for a year.</p><p>After traversing the storm for a long time, Qin Sang reached the outskirts, near Yuanzhu’s cave, and activated the restriction on his scales.  The situation had been urgent earlier, and Yuanzhu hadn’t been specific. Qin Sang had intended to ask Yuanzhu for more details, but after waiting a long time, received no reply.</p><p>“Could he not be at the cave?  Looks like I’ll have to come back at the appointed time…”</p><p>Qin Sang stroked his chin, then left without delay, flying out of the storm zone.</p><p>Returning to the Canglang Sea felt like a lifetime ago.  Qin Sang looked around; there was no one. He used his flight technique and headed west.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to the Heavenly Dao Sect to find someone?” Bai asked.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced in the direction of the Heavenly Dao Sect and sighed, “I’ve already wasted so much time, what’s the rush?  I’ll go to Tianxing Island first, acquire the friend’s needed herbs, and stabilize their life force.”</p><p>He pondered what identity to use. His true identity, along with his aliases Mingyue and Qingfeng, had all attracted powerful enemies, making him sigh.</p><p>…</p><p>Tianxing Island.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the city in disguise and went straight to the shops and auction houses. In just a few days, he had almost collected all the herbs Yuanzhu needed. Only a few very rare and precious herbs remained, which he would have to rely on luck to find later.</p><p>While on Tianxing Island, Qin Sang had intended to secretly investigate Mou Laomo’s background. Knowing your enemy is crucial for victory.</p><p>Unexpectedly, without much effort, Qin Sang heard about a major recent event involving Mou Laomo that left him speechless.  Just a few months ago, Mou Laomo's Tianfeng Island was suddenly attacked.  The attackers were a joint force of righteous and demonic cultivators—the two strongest human factions in the world.  It was said that Lingzhuzi and the Demon Lord, two powerful cultivators, personally participated.</p><p>Since then, Tianfeng Island was completely wiped off the map of the Canglang Sea!</p><p>Mou Laomo was renowned in the demonic cultivation world and even among all humankind.  The Demon Lord had supposedly even tried to recruit him. Some people had compiled a list of cultivators most likely to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage, and Mou Laomo was prominently featured.</p><p>The news caused an uproar, shaking the entire world.  Months later, the event was still widely discussed.</p>
