<h1>Chapter 982:  A Tough Nut to Crack</h1><p>A commotion erupted in the surrounding shops.</p><p>Qin Sang's face drastically changed.</p><p>"Attack!"</p><p>Before the words left her lips, a bright green light flared from Qin Sang.</p><p>Phoenix wings appeared, a dragon's shadow emerged.</p><p>A series of sharp, piercing sounds, like thunder, exploded in the street.</p><p>Three-colored遁光 (escape light) streaked towards the Deputy Commander like lightning.</p><p>The Deputy Commander's pupils constricted.</p><p>The others were all shocked, stunned by Qin Sang's sudden burst of speed.</p><p>They had assumed that with five of them, subduing their opponent wouldn't be difficult, and that the Deputy Commander's summoning of reinforcements was unnecessary and overly cautious.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the opponent's speed far exceeded their expectations.  If she wanted to escape, they had no confidence in stopping her.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai and Fei You separately attacked their respective opponents.</p><p>Qin Sang had Fei You engage the young man in the tight-fitting clothes.</p><p>Bai ended the life of Manager Liu, then charged towards another late-stage Jindan cultivator.</p><p>The Deputy Commander and his men reacted swiftly. Qin Sang didn't flee but proactively split her forces, which played right into their hands.</p><p>The Deputy Commander's sleeve fluttered, and a black dragon-headed stone staff appeared in his hand.  Made from an unknown material, it shone like jade, emitting a faint black light.  As it vibrated, strange waves emanated from it.</p><p>Holding the dragon staff, the Deputy Commander coldly watched Qin Sang approach, standing his ground. He brought the staff down with a powerful blow.</p><p>The other four immediately produced their own magic weapons.</p><p>The young man in tight-fitting clothes confronted Fei You.</p><p>The late-stage Jindan cultivator charged towards Bai alone, confident that even if he couldn't subdue Bai, he could keep him occupied for a while.</p><p>Their main target was Daoist Qingfeng.  As long as the Deputy Commander and his men captured their main target, it would be a great achievement; the others were less important.</p><p>Therefore, the other two cultivators each summoned their magic weapons, flanking Qin Sang with the Deputy Commander.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A gust of wind hit their faces.</p><p>An ice-blue iron chain and a moon-white flying knife tore through the air.  Even more terrifying was the dragon-headed stone staff in the middle, its black light obscuring the sky like a real black dragon descending, bringing immense pressure.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The ground cracked, ancient trees snapped.</p><p>The autumn street scene was instantly destroyed.</p><p>If not for the protective array, the surrounding shops would have been affected, possibly collapsing.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were cold, but she was prepared.  With a flick of her finger, the ebony sword materialized before her, emitting a dazzling sword light, its aura in no way inferior to the dragon-headed staff.</p><p>The sword wheel reappeared.</p><p>The next moment, the black dragon pounced.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled, her figure abruptly stopping.</p><p>The ebony sword flew back, its wheel shattered.</p><p>Facing three opponents, one of whom was a top-tier expert, even Qin Sang was somewhat strained.  She used all her energy, the ebony sword reforming its wheel.</p><p>But the Deputy Commander and his men wouldn't give her a chance to recover. They unleashed all their power; the three magic weapons paused slightly, then shone brightly, attacking Qin Sang without reservation.</p><p>It seemed the battle was decided.</p><p>But they hadn't noticed that during the fight, Qin Sang had secretly thrown out the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring.</p><p>The ring flashed in mid-air, and a figure emerged—the two-headed beast. Without hesitation, it charged towards Bai's opponent.</p><p>"Careful!"</p><p>The Deputy Commander was the first to notice the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring and warned his companions.</p><p>Seeing the two-headed beast, he was secretly shocked. This person actually had such a powerful spirit beast.  No wonder the Chamber of Commerce had warned them to be extremely cautious and not act rashly.</p><p>However, just as this thought crossed his mind, an even more shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>From a second-story window of an inn beside the street, a figure burst out without warning, aiming for the same target as the two-headed beast.</p><p>After entering the market, Qin Sang felt that carrying a coffin was too conspicuous, so she had left her external avatar in the inn.</p><p>Previously, before going to see Elder Zou, she would also leave her external avatar elsewhere, fearing that if she made enemies, they would trace her Qingfeng identity.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly awakened her external avatar, serving as an unexpected trump card.</p><p>The Deputy Commander and his men initially thought it was a member of the Merchant Guild, coming to help them at the Deputy Commander’s request. But after seeing the avatar's actions, their faces completely changed.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>The Deputy Commander's eyes were bloodshot as he yelled in alarm, simultaneously summoning a flying sword to quickly strike at the two-headed beast.</p><p>The late-stage Jindan cultivator had already sensed something was wrong.</p><p>Bai alone had already put him under tremendous pressure.</p><p>The sudden appearance of a man and beast on either side, each exuding powerful energy, filled him with terror.</p><p>Bai knew Qin Sang's plan beforehand.  He subtly guided the opponents, who were completely unaware, into the most advantageous position for them.</p><p>Three top experts jointly attacked one person. The outcome was predictable.</p><p>Bai, moving like lightning, unleashed a massive burst of corpse energy, enveloping the opponent.  His double-headed  creature and his avatar descended from the sky.</p><p>Three attacks struck simultaneously.</p><p>The cultivator, panicked, could only throw out a few talismans, but they were ineffective.  His protective aura was broken, and he died instantly.</p><p>The avatar clawed open the man's chest, its arm stained with blood.  It smelled the blood, licked its lips, but unable to disobey its master's command, violently threw away the corpse and looked towards another target.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Bai intervened, assisting the double-headed creature.  Man and beast seamlessly switched targets, killing Fei You's opponent.  Then, together with the avatar, they surrounded the Left Deputy Envoy.</p><p>Fei You stared blankly at his dead opponent, still stunned.</p><p>He had been filled with immense regret, believing his death was certain, but unexpectedly, the situation had taken a dramatic turn.  Qingfeng Daoist had somehow summoned numerous powerful allies, instantly reversing the tide of battle.</p><p>"No wonder my parents and the Wang sisters held him in such high regard!"</p><p>Fei You was elated.</p><p>He'd gambled right!</p><p>A deathly silence descended upon the shops lining the street.</p><p>When the Left Deputy Envoy spoke those words, some were tempted. Many of these shops had close ties to the three major merchant alliances, including several guilds of the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>Indeed, there was a mutual aid pact among the East Pole Alliance's guilds.</p><p>However, while they hesitated, the situation changed in an instant. The person the Qiongyu Merchant Guild sought to arrest displayed astonishing power, instantly killing two Qiongyu Merchant Guild experts.</p><p>"嘶! Three top-tier experts! The Qiongyu Merchant Guild has stirred up a hornet's nest.  Thankfully, I didn't intervene!"</p><p>In one shop, someone gasped, breaking out in a cold sweat, deeply regretting his inaction.</p><p>"Don't forget the spirit beast. Its power is probably comparable to a late-stage Golden Core cultivator."</p><p>A seductive woman beside him added.</p><p>The woman peered at the street, a strange glint in her eyes. "Did you sense a connection between the last person to appear and the cloaked figure's energy, as if they were one?"</p><p>Another person's expression shifted. He stared intently at the avatar, then exclaimed in shock, "It's likely a similar secret technique to avatar creation! Could that corpse-energy-ridden necromancer be his animated corpse?"</p><p>The two exchanged a look, speechless in their astonishment.</p>
