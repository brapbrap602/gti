<h1>Chapter 706: Insect Shadow</h1><p>When the five people on the other side of the light barrier realized something was wrong, Qin Sang and the gaunt old man had already finished their fight. The old man had perished in the demonic flames, while Qin Sang remained unscathed.</p><p>By the time they rushed out, the battle was over.</p><p>After killing the old man, Qin Sang retreated swiftly. The old man's corpse was quickly incinerated by the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, leaving only a pile of ashes on the ground.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, everyone's expressions changed drastically. They all brandished their magical weapons, pointing them at Qin Sang as if he were a great demon.</p><p>“What are you doing? Why did you kill him?”</p><p>The stout cultivator bellowed, glaring at Qin Sang.</p><p>The others were equally shocked.  Blocked by the light barrier, they hadn't heard the conversation between Qin Sang and the gaunt old man.</p><p>On one hand, they were unaware of the events leading up to the killing and were astonished that the usually silent Qin Sang had suddenly attacked a companion. Cultivators of their level naturally had blood on their hands, but for Qin Sang to kill someone without provocation, right outside the entrance to the cave, was something no one had anticipated.</p><p>On the other hand, they were also shocked by Qin Sang's power, as he was able to instantly kill a cultivator of the same realm!</p><p>None of them were confident that they could easily defeat the gaunt old man.</p><p>Didn't this mean that if Qin Sang decided to kill, no one present would be spared?</p><p>Qin Sang distanced himself from them, his expression unchanged.  A cold mist surged, and two Sky Demons landed beside him, like guardians, confronting the five people opposite them.</p><p>Seeing the ferocious appearance of the Sky Demons, everyone gasped. They finally understood why the gaunt old man had died so quickly, almost without resistance.</p><p>These two Sky Demons were terrifying.</p><p>One of them possessed an aura comparable to a true Core Formation cultivator, while the other was slightly weaker but still a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Coupled with the strange demonic fire controlled by Qin Sang, even a mid-Core Formation cultivator would likely choose to flee if suddenly attacked by Qin Sang and the Sky Demons.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Qin…”</p><p>The scholar in blue robes gulped and asked cautiously, “What exactly happened? We've arrived at the Nascent Soul cave, and we're about to enter. Whatever the conflict, why couldn't it be resolved peacefully in front of everyone? Why resort to such drastic measures?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, his gaze cold as he scanned each of the five faces.</p><p>If the gaunt old man had accomplices, the stout cultivator was the most likely suspect, but the other four couldn't be ruled out either. They were all cunning and deceptive, and Qin Sang couldn't detect anything amiss.</p><p>After witnessing Qin Sang kill the old man, everyone felt threatened and now regarded him as the greatest enemy. Mere words wouldn't be enough to explain the situation and gain their trust.</p><p>Even with his strength, Qin Sang didn't dare challenge them all at once.</p><p>The signal had been sent. Staying in the cave would lead to being trapped. Explaining to them would be a waste of time and unnecessary.</p><p>He estimated that the gaunt old man's accomplices weren't overwhelmingly powerful; otherwise, they wouldn't need to resort to such underhanded tactics.</p><p>However, firstly, the cave was narrow, and talismans couldn't be fully deployed. Secondly, everyone was suspicious of each other, and he didn't know how many more of the gaunt old man's accomplices were among them. It was impossible to distinguish friend from foe, and fighting them one by one would be impractical.</p><p>What worried Qin Sang the most was the strange cold mist in the cave.</p><p>He suspected that the mist might be related to some powerful spiritual fire. If someone could control the fire, killing them would be as easy as turning one's hand.</p><p>A wise man does not stand under a dangerous wall.</p><p>It would be much safer to leave the cave and escape the danger first.  He could decide his next move after the gaunt old man's accomplices arrived, depending on the situation.</p><p>Treasures were tempting, but only if one was alive to claim them.</p><p>Moreover, it wasn't even certain if there were any treasures in the cave. Qin Sang now felt that this place was more like a sweet but dangerous bait, someone else's hunting ground!</p><p>With this thought, a smile appeared on Qin Sang's face, which in the eyes of the others seemed like the grin of a demon, especially in this environment, making them shudder.</p><p>The two female cultivators' hands trembled slightly as they gripped their magical weapons.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Lan, out of our alliance, I must warn you.”</p><p>Qin Sang pointed to the gaunt old man's ashes.  “This man, taking advantage of the chaos when the light barrier was broken, secretly sent out a signal. I don’t know who he was contacting, but luckily, I noticed. If you’re in league with him, consider this unsaid. But if not, think carefully. We're being eroded by the cold mist and have exhausted our efforts breaking the restriction.  What do you think will happen if we are trapped here…?”</p><p>Qin Sang appeared calm and unafraid.</p><p>Hearing these words, the scholar in blue robes and the others' expressions changed repeatedly, filled with doubt and suspicion.</p><p>But they subconsciously began to guard against the stout cultivator.</p><p>After all, he was the initiator and the most likely suspect.</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>The stout cultivator interrupted Qin Sang sharply, shouting, “Don't listen to this demon's lies! He must have been exposed, killed to silence the witness, and now he's trying to sow discord among us to seize the treasure for himself! Don't fall for his tricks! Kill him first!  There are five of us, we don't need to fear him…”</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, disdaining to argue.</p><p>“That’s all I have to say. Farewell!”</p><p>Before his voice faded, Qin Sang beckoned and recalled the Sky Demons.  Then, the sound of a dragon's roar echoed from his body as he transformed into a streak of light and rushed back the way he came, disappearing instantly into the depths of the cold mist, leaving behind the dumbfounded group.</p><p>The cold mist surged. A figure burst out of the mist and landed on the branch of an ancient tree at the edge of a hill. As soon as he appeared, a touch of sky-blue materialized in the void before him, revealing the exquisite form of the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>A gentle smile appeared on Qin Sang's face. He offered a finger as a perch for the butterfly and stroked it gently with his other hand as encouragement.</p><p>“Insect shadow?”</p><p>After communicating with his natal insect gu, Qin Sang received more precise information.  The gaunt old man had released what seemed to be a spirit insect. The insect's shadow flew high into the sky and then vanished.</p><p>“Communicating through spirit insects? That sounds like a Witch Clan method.  Similar to Green蚨 Cash, but not as discreet. It seems it needs to overcome the interference from the cold mist. These six people are all human cultivators. Could someone be colluding with the Witch Clan to harm their own kind?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, looking up at the surrounding sea.</p><p>The blue sea and sky, dotted with white clouds, seemed normal.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened, fixated on a white cloud rapidly approaching from the distant northern horizon.</p><p>This cloud moved through the sea of clouds, approaching at an alarming speed.  Seeing its speed, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.</p><p>He suspected that the cloud contained the gaunt old man's accomplices, but he couldn't tell how many there were. Knowing he couldn't stay here any longer, he pushed off the branch with force, activated his talisman again, and sped off in another direction.</p>
