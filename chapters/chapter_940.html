<h1>Chapter 932: Appearance</h1><p>Chapter 932: Appearance</p><p>‘Whew!’</p><p>Qin Sang channeled the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire, enveloping himself. He pressed close to the canyon wall, squeezing through a crack.</p><p>Entering the Ghostland, a bone-chilling coldness assaulted him.</p><p>Surrounded by ghost mist, Qin Sang narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>On his last visit, his vision and spiritual sense were blocked by the mist, limiting his view to a small area. That ghostly creature had snatched away the Flying Night Rakshasa, using its familiarity with the terrain to outwit him completely.</p><p>This time was different. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly's divine ability easily pierced the ghost mist, revealing everything around him.</p><p>After a moment's thought, a light flashed from his brow. His ebony sword shot out, circling him briefly before hovering above his head.  The sword then shimmered, splitting into four beams of sword light to stand guard.</p><p>Qin Sang then activated his movement technique, delving deeper into the Ghostland to find the creature.  He maintained the pretense of being unable to see clearly.</p><p>However, he found nothing.</p><p>“Hiding?  Could there be hidden restrictions in the Ghostland that even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly can't see through?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned inwardly.</p><p>He hadn't found the ghostly creature, nor the Flying Night Rakshasa. The Ghostland had boundaries; there were no obvious hiding places.</p><p>“Looks like I'll have to wait for it to reveal itself,”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>His search yielding nothing, Qin Sang calmly patted his waist. Several煞尸 (sha shi), possessing the strength of Foundation Establishment cultivators, leaped out of his corpse puppet bag.</p><p>These were some who had foolishly provoked him during his travels in the Split Wind Islands.  The islands also had geomantic yin veins, so he'd conveniently cultivated these煞尸 (sha shi).</p><p>Qin Sang moved his lips, and the煞尸 (sha shi) scattered. He slowly walked forward.</p><p>Moments later, chaos erupted ahead of Qin Sang. The煞尸 (sha shi) wreaked havoc, crushing decayed magical artifacts, collapsing piles of bones, and startling the vengeful spirits hidden within.</p><p>For a time, ghostly cries echoed, like a hundred ghosts at night.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered as he captured the vengeful spirits one by one, simultaneously channeling true essence from his palm to refine them into spirit threads.</p><p>There were far too many vengeful spirits here. Before long, a foot-long spirit thread was refined.</p><p>Qin Sang then ordered the煞尸 (sha shi) to halt, found a clear space, and sat cross-legged.</p><p>He took out a Ten Directions Yama Banner, attempting to weave it.</p><p>For years, Qin Sang had pondered how to arrange a formation using the demonic banners to unleash the full power of the eighteen demonic banners. He frequently studied the *Grand Xuan Array Remains* of the Yuan Shen Sect.</p><p>He discovered that the formations described in the book were exceptionally profound, interconnected in a way that even if he understood them, applying them to the demonic banners would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>Fortunately, this effort wasn't wasted.</p><p>Problems that had previously puzzled Qin Sang were now solved, deepening his understanding of the three demonic banners in his possession. He truly grasped the effort that the Kui Yin Patriarch had poured into the banners.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner formation created by the Kui Yin Patriarch didn't limit itself to ten banners; even more could be used, their power increasing accordingly.</p><p>Clearly, the Kui Yin Patriarch was ambitious, considering how to obtain more Nine Netherworld Magic Fire from the start of the banner's creation.</p><p>Qin Sang only needed to follow the Kui Yin Patriarch's method to refine eighteen banners.  However, his cultivation was still too low; his spiritual sense and true essence were insufficient, and it remained unknown whether he could simultaneously control several banners.</p><p>He sat cross-legged, one hand grasping the banner pole, the other lightly holding the spirit thread.</p><p>The spirit thread seemed weightless, gently floating.</p><p>Qin Sang intently stared at both.</p><p>After a moment, he used his spiritual sense to guide the spirit thread towards the banner pole. The banner pole emitted a 'zheng' sound, its restrictive light erupting, countless runes appearing.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly cast incantations, activating the runes on the banner pole to connect with the spirit thread.</p><p>Fully focused, he seemed defenseless to the outside world, yet he was ready to activate the Heavenly Demon Transformation and open the Heavenly Corpse Coffin at any moment.  He believed that unless the ghostly creature was at the Yuan Ying level, it wouldn't escape his grasp.</p><p>Initially, the two items ignored each other.</p><p>As the light on the banner staff grew brighter, the spirit thread suddenly trembled. One end spontaneously wrapped around the staff, merging with the prohibitions etched upon it, becoming one with the artifact!</p><p>“It’s done!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped with joy.  He was about to further refine the spirit thread when a sudden thought made him smirk.</p><p>“You finally dare to show yourself!”</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly looked up, his eyes blazing with intense light, piercing the thick ghost mist and instantly fixing on a ghostly apparition.</p><p>This ghost, believing itself well-hidden, had been spying on Qin Sang from afar.  Its appearance was immediately detected by the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Qin Sang had already captured all the surrounding resentful spirits; the ghost's identity was now clear.</p><p>The ghost, startled, instinctively approached.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly put away the banner staff.  A green light erupted behind him, wings unfurled, as he decisively transformed into his Tian Yao form.  Then, green and red light alternated, instantly propelling him towards the ghost with astonishing speed.</p><p>The ghost was exceptionally alert.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang discovered it, the ghost sensed danger and leaped back, transforming into a wisp of greyish-white energy similar to the ghost mist, fleeing into the depths of the Ghostland.</p><p>The ghost was at home in the mist. Its escape was silent and smooth, its speed incredibly fast. This was the same method it used to steal the Flying Night Rakshasa, leaving Qin Sang helpless.</p><p>Now, it believed it could escape Qin Sang again, but it quickly realized it had miscalculated.</p><p>“No wonder I couldn’t find it last time. It wasn’t exceptional stealth, but its ability to merge with the ghost mist.  Unless a cultivator possessed extremely powerful spiritual sense, it was almost impossible to detect its presence. Now that the Sky Eye Butterfly has it, let's see where you run!”</p><p>Qin Sang used his full evasion skills to pursue the ghost.  Seeing the ghost’s evasion and concealment methods, he was somewhat surprised.</p><p>He wondered how such a ghost could be born in this isolated Ghostland.</p><p>The ghost, blending into the mist, darted about aimlessly.</p><p>No matter how it changed direction, Qin Sang relentlessly pursued.</p><p>Though the ghost’s speed was faster than that of a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was still slower than Qin Sang’s. The distance between them rapidly closed.</p><p>Finally, the ghost understood the source of its predicament. It stopped its erratic movements and fled directly towards the depths of the Ghostland.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang instantly arrived, his gaze sweeping across the surroundings before settling on a mountain of bones beneath him.</p><p>The ghost had vanished.</p><p>But the Sky Eye Butterfly had been constantly tracking its movements; escaping wouldn’t be easy.</p><p>“So that's where it was hiding, another realm within the bones?”</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword, unleashing a powerful sword qi, which he aimed fiercely at the bone mountain.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The bones were long decayed.  The sword qi cut through the mountain with ease, from top to bottom, piercing the entire structure.</p><p>Countless bones turned to dust, and the mountain collapsed.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, a black shadow suddenly burst from the mountain, rushing towards Qin Sang.  Qin Sang raised an eyebrow, not having time to retrieve his ebony sword, and instead met the attack with a punch.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The two figures separated, seemingly evenly matched!</p>
