<h1>Chapter 1391 Mysterious Ice Box</h1><p>Island Master Shen and the others also suspected that the demon race was behind the scheme, deliberately putting on a show of desperately fighting for the white-robed man to secretly send out the Rainbow Rat to steal the treasure.</p><p>It was their fault for overlooking the Rainbow Rat.</p><p>Mocked by Master Feng, Bifang felt even more ashamed and angry, wishing he could immediately drag out the Rainbow Rat and dismember it into eight pieces.</p><p>But reason told him it was too late.</p><p>The desolate island was so close to the storm belt; once the Rainbow Rat escaped into the storm belt, no one would be able to find its trail.</p><p>Bifang glared fiercely at the Eagle and Snake Demons.</p><p>They had some acquaintance with the Rainbow Rat before.</p><p>The Eagle Demon gave a bitter smile, half admiration, half anger, "I didn't expect that in its condition, it still had the audacity to try to swallow the treasure alone…"</p><p>Everyone wanted to possess a treasured artifact of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat was simply outrageously bold.</p><p>Of course, some Demon Kings suspected that the Rainbow Rat's inexplicable disappearance might be related to the white-robed man and that the white-robed man would have the last laugh. But these were no longer important.</p><p>Master Feng and the others didn't believe their nonsense at all, taking the Demon Kings as merely putting on an act.</p><p>They were pretending to be good after taking advantage.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>Master Feng roared angrily.</p><p>Since they couldn't find the Rainbow Rat, they could only vent their anger on the Demon Kings in front of them.</p><p>Qin Sang heard Master Feng's voice transmission in his ear, inviting him to join forces to hunt down Bifang and slay this fiend.</p><p>Although they didn't get the treasured artifact of the Profound Heaven Palace, the treasures in those ice boxes used as bait weren't of low value either.</p><p>The white-robed man was indeed from the Profound Heaven Palace, with a very wealthy background. Island Master Shen and the others managed to snatch a few boxes, to be divided equally later, with a share for Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. After pondering for a moment, he agreed to Master Feng's proposal.</p><p>A chaotic battle was about to break out.</p><p>Without another word, Qin Sang and Master Feng rushed directly at Bifang, filled with murderous intent.</p><p>Bifang was shocked. Not daring to hesitate, he urgently flapped his wings. The bloodflame feathers on his body jingled, like an arrow leaving the bow, and flew towards the outside of the island.</p><p>Island Master Shen and the other three took action one after another, entangling the Frog, Fish, and other four Demon Kings. But, after all, they were one person short, and the other side quickly seized the opportunity.</p><p>The pursuit battle between the two races' experts played out again in this sea area.</p><p>A streak of crimson light pierced through the night sky.</p><p>Immediately afterward, two streaks of light followed closely behind.</p><p>Like three meteors, they rapidly flew across the sea.</p><p>The three streaks of light were all extremely fast.</p><p>But there was still a gap between them.</p><p>Bifang's Bloodflame Transformation Secret Technique hadn't ended yet, and his escape speed was as fast as lightning. In the end, he rushed into the storm belt.</p><p>Qin Sang was still able to keep up, but Master Feng was gradually being left behind. His escape technique was excellent in its flexibility, transforming into wind and smoke, penetrating everywhere, but he was somewhat lacking in pure speed.</p><p>Qin Sang was quite surprised by the speed Bifang displayed at this time.</p><p>After observing for a while, he finally discovered the clue.</p><p>Bifang was now transformed into a ball of bloodflame. The bloodflame continuously emerged from his body, burning his own essence blood, which was likely due to a kind of divine ability that overdraws potential.</p><p>"This is already the third transformation of Bloodflame Transformation. Bifang's divine ability is truly not simple…"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>No wonder Bifang was entrenched between the Crescent Moon Realm and the Star Sand Archipelago, causing trouble for so long without being eliminated.</p><p>"I'll see how long your essence blood can burn!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered in his heart.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after chasing for a while, Bifang saw that there was no hope of shaking off Qin Sang and flew out of the storm belt again.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang discovered that demonic energy in the north soared into the sky. The sea surface was a dark mass. The demon race army had finally arrived.</p><p>The demon race army was well-trained. Their battle formation was not disordered while advancing.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned and stopped, watching Bifang escape into the Myriad Demon Formation.</p><p>The demon race army had formed a formation, and he didn't know if there were any other Demon Kings present. Without his Nascent Soul Puppet by his side, he didn't want to risk charging in.</p><p>Even if he was unwilling, he could only give up.</p><p>He didn't return the same way to meet up with Master Feng but flew near the storm belt, flew back for a while, and a black shadow floated on the sea surface.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet had returned.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly's excitement hadn't passed yet. It pounced on Qin Sang, rubbing against him again and again, before finally escaping into the Qi Sea.</p><p>Taking the ice box from the Nascent Soul Puppet,</p><p>Qin Sang examined it. He found that the seal on the ice box was very unusual and needed to be carefully studied back home.</p><p>"Spirit body…"</p><p>Qin Sang, holding the ice box in his hand, recalled the course of the previous fight, lost in thought.</p><p>In both battlefields, the white-robed man's Nascent Soul was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>But the aura emanating from him was clearly that of a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>In the storm belt battle, it was impossible for the white-robed man to do anything further. He must have already fallen. However, his spirit body seemed to be a little different from the Nascent Soul of ordinary cultivators.</p><p>"His spirit body doesn't have a fluttering feeling and is extremely condensed, like a ghost cultivator with a physical body… Could it be that he specializes in the cultivation of the nascent spirit (yuanshen)?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>In today's cultivation world, this kind of cultivator is even rarer than body cultivators.</p><p>At least, in the Northern Chen Realm, he hadn't heard of anyone who specialized in cultivating the nascent spirit or the physical body and could still cultivate to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"Could it be that cultivators who specialize in cultivating the nascent spirit or the physical body don't need to form a nascent soul (jieying)?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the ancient books he had read before. The relevant records were too scarce, almost nonexistent.</p><p>As far as Qin Sang knew,</p><p>In macroscopic terms, most cultivation paths could be classified into the three paths of Essence, Qi, and Spirit. These could all achieve the Great Dao in ancient times. Dharma cultivation was just one of them.</p><p>In this day and age, the path to immortality is difficult.</p><p>For the human race alone, only Dharma cultivation is the only right path.</p><p>Other paths, even if one could barely cultivate, the hope of cultivating to the Golden Core stage was very slim, so they gradually declined until they were abandoned.</p><p>Dharma cultivators condense True Essence and form a Nascent Soul, but the other two probably won't!</p><p>*Fire Seed Golden Lotus* is just a secret technique to subdue spirit fire; unfortunately, *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* comes from the demon race, and I can't cultivate it completely; otherwise, I should be able to comprehend some mysteries."</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was in turmoil as he secretly sighed, "The No. 1 power in the North Sea, the Profound Heaven Palace, is indeed well-deserved! They have inheritances for this kind of rare technique, and it can really be cultivated to the Nascent Soul realm. I wonder if there will be a chance to borrow it in the future."</p><p>It was a pity that he couldn't get the technique from the white-robed man's relics.</p><p>Qin Sang tried a few more times, but he couldn't open the ice box for the time being, so he put it into the Thousand Jun Ring, made a big circle, and met up with Master Feng and the others.</p><p>Upon learning that Qin Sang had lost Bifang, Master Feng was quite regretful but understood that Qin Sang was not to blame.</p><p>"Bifang burned his essence blood to escape this time, and it's estimated that he won't be able to come out and cause trouble without a hundred years of recuperation. The Frog Fish and other demons are also injured. It's a good opportunity to drive them back to the demon realm in one fell swoop!"</p><p>Master Feng was preparing to vent his anger on the nearby demons, but when he thought of that treasure, he was still very unwilling, "It's hateful that the treasure fell into their hands!"</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm and echoed Master Feng, cursing the Rainbow Rat together.</p><p>They turned back to meet up with the human race army, made arrangements, and returned to the nameless island by the same route.</p><p>Walking into the main hall, everyone was silent, and the atmosphere was heavy.</p><p>Island Master Shen swept away the gloom on his face and said with a smile, "At least we snatched a few ice boxes. The treasures on that person's body should not be bad. It's not a trip for nothing. Let's see what's inside first…"</p>
