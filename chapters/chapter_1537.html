<h1></h1><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected this.</p><p>After hearing his story, Liuli reciprocated, recounting the tale of her and her master.</p><p>Perhaps it was the long-suppressed emotions, the impact of the civilization's tombstone, that triggered Liuli's first desire to confide. And by her side was only Qin Sang.</p><p>However, Qin Sang might be the most suitable person.</p><p>Too many entanglements had occurred between her and Qin Sang that shouldn't have.</p><p>From another perspective, Qin Sang was the one who understood her best, even better than her master, Bing Yao.</p><p>After Bing Yao was trapped in the Purple Micro Palace, almost every major turning point in Liuli's life was accompanied by Qin Sang's shadow, and he was deeply involved.</p><p>Qin Sang listened quietly.</p><p>When speaking of her master, Liuli's eyes showed a rare tenderness. She hugged her knees, and a girlish expression appeared on her face.</p><p>The story was a clich√©.</p><p>A beggar, born into a fallen family and homeless, whose natural beauty became a burden. At a young age, she learned to smear mud on her face.</p><p>In her desperate moment, she finally met the benefactor of her life. Bing Yao descended like a celestial, holding her small hand, pulling her out of the mire, and leading her into a fantastic and bizarre world.</p><p>This person let her know what happiness was for the first time.</p><p>It turned out that winter nights could be mild.</p><p>From then on, Bing Yao became the most important person in her life, like a teacher and a mother.</p><p>But the good times didn't last.</p><p>She was, after all, ill-fated.</p><p>Bing Yao was trapped, and she, who was only at the Foundation Establishment stage at the time, shouldered the mission of saving her master.</p><p>The taste of living under someone else's roof was not pleasant.</p><p>At that time, Dongyang Bo hadn't yet revealed his fangs, but she, having already experienced the warmth and coldness of human relationships, knew that Dongyang Bo must have ulterior motives, yet she had no other choice.</p><p>Qin Sang already knew what happened next.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly finished listening to her story and was about to speak when he found that Liuli had already straightened her back, the tenderness in her expression nowhere to be seen.</p><p>It seemed like an illusion just now.</p><p>Qin Sang understood.</p><p>She didn't need comfort!</p><p>...</p><p>After leaving.</p><p>Thinking of this cultivation world that buried a civilization, Qin Sang often sighed.</p><p>As time passed, the turmoil in his heart gradually subsided, but the feeling at the moment he learned of the civilization's demise was deeply engraved in their hearts.</p><p>He couldn't help but wonder how many similar civilizations had silently passed away in the boundless storm belt, and how many were still struggling on the brink of extinction.</p><p>It was fortunate.</p><p>On the entire sea chart, there was only this one exception. The others were normal shelters.</p><p>After another thirteen years of travel.</p><p>Finally, they were about to arrive in Central Province!</p><p>The last shelter was successfully found.</p><p>It was a reef hidden deep in the seabed. The reef was full of holes, and the turbulent currents couldn't penetrate the holes, which could serve as a place to stay.</p><p>The divine shuttle entered the largest hole.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared, his expression showing joy.</p><p>All in all, they had been in the storm belt for thirty-seven years. Even subtracting the five years spent on the incarnation's healing, it was still thirty-two years.</p><p>At the beginning of the journey, neither of them expected that it would take so long just on the road.</p><p>"Conserve your strength and prepare for Central Province!"</p><p>Qin Sang patted the sea chart in his hand, full of spirit.</p><p>The mysterious Central Province was finally about to be unveiled!</p><p>A glimmer of anticipation appeared in Liuli's eyes. She nodded gently, then suddenly remembered something and summoned the Four-Patterned Coiling Serpent Seal. "I have comprehended the latter half of the *Universal Treasure Technique*. I'll return the spirit seal to you."</p><p>Inside the storm belt, one can not calm down and cultivate. Qin Sang focused on cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, while she comprehended the new Ice Soul Divine Light and refined her spiritual treasure.</p><p>The Four-Patterned Coiling Serpent Seal was originally close to Liuli. She quickly gained the spirit seal's recognition and became its master.</p><p>After years of continuous refinement, after she truly mastered the spirit seal, the complete *Universal Treasure Technique* appeared in her mind.</p><p>"No rush!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and stopped Liuli. "We're about to reach Central Province. Who knows what troubles will arise when searching for the Buddhist relics. Cultivating the *Universal Treasure Technique* is not something that can be achieved overnight. The spirit seal should stay with you, Immortal Maiden, so that it can exert its proper power and deal with unexpected situations."</p><p>Liuli thought for a moment, then put away the spirit seal. "Alright! Once I find the Buddhist relics, I will return the spirit seal to you."</p><p>She not only had no greed.</p><p>It was like holding a hot potato, she didn't want to hold it for a moment longer.</p><p>Central Province was just ahead.</p><p>Both of them were a little impatient. After recovering their true essence and being fully nourished, they decided to set off immediately.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The divine shuttle broke through the sea surface.</p><p>It was still Liuli and the incarnation who took turns controlling it.</p><p>At first, everything went smoothly.</p><p>But after flying halfway, Qin Sang felt that something was not quite right.</p><p>The storm here showed a tendency to intensify, and there was a faint sound of thunder in the distance, brought by the storm.</p><p>Since ancient times, wind and thunder have always accompanied each other.</p><p>In the storm belt, there was no shortage of thunder and lightning.</p><p>They even encountered a thunder marsh, its momentum comparable to a Heavenly Tribulation. Lightning struck the same area constantly, turning the vast sea into a thunder marsh, and the sky and earth were a silvery white.</p><p>The hurricane couldn't invade the thunder marsh either, and was marked as extremely dangerous by Xiaoxiang Zi.</p><p>Since there were no shelters nearby, the two didn't dare to get close. They stopped the divine shuttle far away, looked at it for a while, and then left.</p><p>But the sound of thunder here was a bit strange.</p><p>From such a distance, they actually felt a sense of oppression.</p><p>It seemed... not like real thunder, one after another, more like the roar of some kind of creature.</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened slightly.</p><p>They had been traveling through the storm belt for many years and had only encountered a Ferocious Beast once. He originally thought that the number of Ferocious Beasts in the storm belt was very small, but he didn't expect trouble to arise just as they were about to reach Central Province.</p><p>How could there be Ferocious Beasts near Central Province?</p><p>There had never been a precedent of Ferocious Beasts attacking the Northern Sea. Qin Sang therefore inferred that the barrier's function might not only be to resist storms, but also to drive away Ferocious Beasts.</p><p>Was he being slapped in the face so soon?</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli looked at each other, surprised and uncertain.</p><p>Just as they were hesitating, the sound of thunder became clearer, and the familiar feeling of madness appeared again after many years!</p><p>"Ferocious Beast!"</p><p>Qin Sang almost squeezed these two words out from between his teeth, no longer doubting.</p><p>At this moment, the sound of thunder became more urgent, clearer each time, and closer and closer!</p><p>"It has discovered us!" Liuli's expression was solemn.</p><p>At this time, one couldn't harbor any illusions, thinking that it was just a Ferocious Beast passing by like last time.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly calmed himself down, his thoughts racing. He said quickly, "Follow the plan, split up! If we get separated too far, after entering Central Province, go to Nine Ga Mountain to meet! The second choice is the White Lotus Pure Land."</p><p>With that, he grabbed the Moon-Gazing Rhinoceros Horn, put away his external incarnation, and escaped from the Ten Directions Ground-Breaking Divine Shuttle.</p><p>Their understanding of Central Province was still limited to Xiaoxiang Zi's few words. They didn't know where they would end up. Since the location of the Buddhist relics was not easy to find, Qin Sang could only choose two famous place names from the jade slip.</p><p>Nine Ga Mountain.</p><p>It was not a sect or a force.</p><p>In Xiaoxiang Zi's records, it was one of the holy places of the Buddhist sects in Central Province. A few words were enough to show the grandeur of this mountain.</p><p>Even if this kind of holy place was accidentally destroyed, there would be no shortage of legends. As long as one patiently searched, they would definitely be able to find its location.</p><p>In case Nine Ga Mountain really disappeared, the White Lotus Pure Land was the backup.</p><p>The White Lotus Pure Land was the top force of the Buddhist sects at that time, and there must be legends circulating.</p><p>'Boom...'</p><p>The hurricane rushed towards him head-on.</p><p>Qin Sang dodged nimbly, looked back at the divine shuttle, nodded goodbye, then activated the Thunder Wings and broke through the air, his direction exactly opposite to that of the Ferocious Beast.</p><p>Liuli watched Qin Sang go away, didn't stop him, and didn't make any coy gestures.</p><p>This was the best way they had discussed before, when encountering a Ferocious Beast.</p><p>She was not good at escape techniques, and following Qin Sang would be a burden. Qin Sang would lure away and get rid of the Ferocious Beast, while she would take the opportunity to escape and wait for him ahead.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's figure disappear into the depths of the darkness, Liuli lowered the fluctuations of the divine shuttle and left this place of trouble.</p><p>Soon, she judged from the 'sound of thunder' that the Ferocious Beast was gradually moving away, and was indeed attracted by Qin Sang.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately created a commotion, fully displaying his Thunder Escape, confirming that the Ferocious Beast's attention was drawn to him, and ignoring Liuli, he began to observe the changes in the surrounding storms, looking for a place that could help him escape.</p><p>Similar to the wind walls and thunder marshes he had encountered before.</p><p>The power didn't need to be comparable to them. Qin Sang only needed the hurricane to be fierce enough to cover his aura. All signs indicated that although the Ferocious Beast was powerful, its temperament was frenzied, and its actions relied on instinct, so there were loopholes to exploit.</p><p>The storm belt was ever-changing.</p><p>This kind of place was not common, but as long as one searched patiently, they would definitely find it.</p><p>Qin Sang was very familiar with the storm belt and could judge through various signs.</p><p>In a desperate situation, there was another way.</p><p>Take this opportunity to verify whether the cultivation world's barrier can resist Ferocious Beasts.</p><p>In addition, there are Ferocious Beasts roaming near the cultivation world. Are the Central Province forces not aware of it and unprepared?</p><p>Of course, unless he was desperate, Qin Sang didn't want to do this. If the barrier was ineffective against Ferocious Beasts, introducing a Ferocious Beast into the cultivation world would cause a terrible disaster.</p><p>The roar was like thunder.</p><p>The hurricane brought the sound over and into his ears. Qin Sang actually had an illusion of blood stagnation.</p><p>This was due to the gap in levels!</p><p>"Could it be at the Soul Formation stage?"</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>Last time, they had a fleeting glimpse, blocked by the wind wall. They didn't have the opportunity to directly experience the strength of the Ferocious Beast. They didn't know which of these two Ferocious Beasts was stronger or weaker.</p><p>"Roar! Roar!"</p><p>The Ferocious Beast sensed the tempting blood food, and its roar became urgent.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to stop for a moment, displaying his escape technique to the extreme.</p><p>Judging from the sound, although the Ferocious Beast was fast, it was not to the point of despair. For Qin Sang, this was undoubtedly good news.</p><p>He was calm and collected, his gaze moving rapidly. The seemingly chaotic storm, in his eyes, had a pattern to follow.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang heard something unusual from the Ferocious Beast's roar.</p><p>The Ferocious Beast's frenzied roar seemed to be mixed with a trace of hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang realized one thing.</p><p>His current flying direction was still forced to approach Central Province.</p><p>Could it be that, as he had guessed before, the cultivation world's barrier could drive away Ferocious Beasts, making them fear or dislike it?</p><p>The speed of the Ferocious Beast was not as fast as expected because it was unwilling to approach the cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart moved, and he immediately changed direction, heading straight for Central Province!</p><p>...</p><p>An unknown place in the storm belt.</p><p>There was a small island here.</p><p>The small island was isolated, and hurricanes filled all directions, surrounding the island. Above the island, runes flickered from time to time, forming a firm barrier, very mysterious.</p><p>The light on the island was bright, and some figures were sitting cross-legged, all wearing Daoist robes, with an immortal and virtuous air.</p><p>Everyone was sitting around a square cauldron.</p><p>Inside the square cauldron was a black object, the size of a fist, occasionally flickering with red sparks. A strange fragrance was emitted along with the curling smoke.</p><p>The smoke was blown away as soon as it entered the storm belt, and the fragrance was almost imperceptible, but it spread into the depths of the storm belt. If there was an existence with extremely keen perception, it would be attracted by the fragrance.</p><p>"This time, with the addition of the Buddhist Diamond Demon-Subduing Formation, we shouldn't be defeated as badly as last time, right?"</p><p>A Daoist with a carefree scarf and a long beard hanging down to his knees stared at the square cauldron, playing with an ancient bronze square-holed coin in his hand, and suddenly spoke with emotion.</p><p>His words evoked unpleasant memories for the others. Everyone's expression was different, and they faintly revealed fear.</p><p>The person next to him sighed, "Not to mention the great time wasted waiting for the Ferocious Beast to take the bait here. The Ferocious Beast is so fierce, with just the few of us, no matter what methods we use, it is impossible to subdue it. It's only a matter of how quickly we are defeated. I really don't know why the Grand Elder asked us to do such a thankless task."</p><p>"That's right! Either the Grand Elder should take action personally, or announce it to the Daoist sects and unite the various sects, then there might be a slight possibility. But the Grand Elder..."</p><p>Someone echoed.</p><p>When mentioning the Grand Elder, his tone was extremely respectful, but there was a hidden resentment.</p><p>"Speak cautiously!"</p><p>Among the crowd, the only old man in a purple robe opened his eyes. There were faint purple lightning flashes in his pupils, majestic without anger.</p><p>That person's expression was startled, and he immediately fell silent.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist was not afraid of the old man in the purple robe. The corners of his mouth curled slightly, and he smiled at everyone, "It is said that the Ferocious Beast originally occupied the legendary Guixu of the Eastern Sea. Now it has left its nest and is wandering around. This is something that has never happened before."</p><p>After a pause, he said quietly, "Eastward, who knows how many hundreds of millions of miles away, there is a greatÂ£ë. It is truly a bottomless valley, and its bottom is bottomless. It is called Guixu. The waters of the eight Ëçí and nine wilds, the flow of the Heavenly River, all pour into it, without increase or decrease. Pouring into it does not fill it, and scooping from it does not deplete it... Fellow disciples, are you not curious about what kind of upheaval has happened in the Eastern Sea's Guixu?"</p><p>"Who among us has been to Guixu? The Eastern Sea's Guixu, the Ferocious Beast's nest, there are many opinions, and no consensus. This junior sister has only one wish, that the upheaval does not spread to Central Province."</p><p>A female Daoist spoke with emotion, her expression hiding worry. "First there were Ferocious Beasts, and then what other fierce things? Dangerous! Dangerous!"</p><p>"At least, the barrier is still strong and can drive away Ferocious Beasts, making them afraid to approach. If the barrier really collapses and Central Province is destroyed, we will probably have already ascended to immortality by then."</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist was optimistic. "Capturing the Ferocious Beast may be able to bring the legend into reality. Isn't it an opportunity? The Grand Elder ordered us to hunt the Ferocious Beast, there is a deep meaning. When the time is right, the Grand Elder will definitely take action."</p><p>Just then.</p><p>A hurried ringing sound suddenly came from the waist of the old man in the purple robe.</p><p>'Dong dong dong...'</p><p>The bell rang like a drum, interrupting everyone's debate.</p><p>Everyone's gaze was instantly drawn to it, and their expressions became extremely serious.</p><p>The old man in the purple robe took off the bell.</p><p>The bell was completely black, engraved with cloud and thunder patterns. Every time it vibrated, the surface would bulge out faint cloud energy, which would then merge into the bell, repeating endlessly.</p><p>This treasure had the function of warning.</p><p>"The Ferocious Beast is approaching!"</p><p>The old man in the purple robe stood up and shouted in a low voice, "Form the formation!"</p>
