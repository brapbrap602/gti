<h1>Chapter 2263: The Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe</h1><p>Qin Sang was unaware of his master's predicament, currently communicating with the mysterious Azure Luan within his cave abode.</p><p>"The time… has come… it's finally here!"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Luan's tone was unusually grave, tinged with excitement.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang was greatly shaken. "Is the treasure finally about to appear?"</p><p>No wonder the celestial omen had been so prolonged and extraordinary.</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Luan replied.</p><p>It and Qin Sang had been painstakingly preparing, not daring to slacken, waiting for this moment, the moment of truth.</p><p>The outcome would likely determine the fate of all beings in this realm; it couldn't help but be nervous.</p><p>Bound tightly by its enemies, it could do nothing but rely on Qin Sang to understand the world.  This waiting was a torment. What must come, will come; regardless of the outcome, there's no point in further agonizing.</p><p>"That divine ability… what level of mastery have you achieved…?" the mysterious Azure Luan pressed.</p><p>"Senior refers to the Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe? I've achieved a rudimentary understanding," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Over the years, the mysterious Azure Luan had imparted several abilities and spells to Qin Sang for self-preservation.</p><p>These abilities were, however, mostly practical and easy to learn, designed to allow Qin Sang to master them quickly.</p><p>The only one that could be considered a truly great ability was the Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe. This ability allowed the use of Azure Luan's demonic thunder to transform its feathers into thunder feathers, resembling a thunder robe.</p><p>The robe's greatest function was concealment; it was said only Heaven itself could detect it, thus its name.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Luan naturally knew more than just this one great ability, but it believed that diverting Qin Sang's attention to multiple abilities would consume precious cultivation time.  Their time was too limited; mastering the Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe was already the limit for Qin Sang.</p><p>This meant Qin Sang's combat strength would be a significant problem, but there was no better solution.</p><p>Furthermore, the mysterious Azure Luan didn't intend for Qin Sang to clash directly with the minions of the extraterrestrial demons.  All that was needed was to evade them, stealthily approach the treasure, and steal it.</p><p>Ideally, if the treasure were a magic weapon or spiritual treasure, it could recognize Qin Sang as its master.</p><p>If the extraterrestrial demons were alerted and intervened, they would inevitably reveal weaknesses on the battlefield, allowing the powerful figures of this realm to escape.  A battle for the treasure and Qin Sang would then ensue, rendering Qin Sang's cultivation level less critical.</p><p>Therefore, the Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe should suffice for the situation.</p><p>Moreover, the one wielding the ability wouldn't be Qin Sang, but the mysterious Azure Luan!</p><p>This was to familiarize Qin Sang with the ability as much as possible. When the mysterious Azure Luan personally imparted the ability later, Qin Sang's endurance would be enhanced.</p><p>"Rudimentary understanding? Excellent… sufficient!"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Luan's tone became invigorated.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't being humble; he had truly only achieved a rudimentary understanding. The ability was extremely profound and mysterious; if its full power were unleashed, it would likely be a divine ability on par with the Unity Stage.</p><p>The power used by the Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe should not be Azure Luan's demonic thunder, but its true thunder!</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's mid-Void Refinement cultivation, comprehending it proved challenging.</p><p>"Silently recite the incantation… within your mind," the mysterious Azure Luan urged.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered, various thoughts racing through his mind.</p><p>He hadn't expected the treasure to appear so soon. For years, he hadn't found a reason to ask the mysterious Azure Luan to search for the stone pavilion again.  The Azure Luan had shown little interest. Now that he had broken through, the most pressing matter was no longer overcoming his inner demons, but the imminent appearance of the treasure.</p><p>Furthermore, each time the mysterious Azure Luan imparted an ability, it had to be careful not to be detected by its enemies, consuming a great deal of its energy. It was engaged in a fierce battle, and every ounce of strength was precious.</p><p>"Still no news from my senior sisters…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Mount Yuanjing had accepted many disciples, its manpower growing. At Qin Sang's request, his two senior sisters had sent disciples to search for the stone pavilion, but to no avail.</p><p>Qin Sang had even considered offering a reward in the immortal city, but feared this might attract fraud and create interference, ultimately counterproductive.</p><p>"Senior, how exactly will the treasure appear? If I stay in the cave, will it come to me?"</p><p>Qin Sang voiced his doubt.</p><p>"Don't overthink it! Quickly… activate the ability!" The mysterious Azure Luan sharply rebuked.</p><p>Without receiving an answer, Qin Sang had no choice but to obey.</p><p>It was clear the treasure would emerge in an unexpected way.</p><p>Qin Sang deduced that once the treasure appeared, it would shake the illusory realm, and those who entered with him would likely manifest. Perhaps, he could finally meet Liuli then.</p><p>He closed his eyes, summoned his Azure Bird Dharma form, and silently activated the incantation.</p><p>The Azure Bird Dharma form hovered behind Qin Sang, its feathers radiating a blue light, emitting a rustling sound like countless tiny thunderclaps.  Lightning danced across its body; the Dharma form bathed in thunder, resembled a divine bird born of lightning itself.  Upon closer inspection, tiny blue arcs of electricity leaped between the filaments of each feather. Its feathers appeared increasingly verdant and translucent, the filaments like crystalline threads of thunder.</p><p>With the appearance of the Sky-Feeling Thunder Robe, Qin Sang merged with his Dharma form, his figure gradually fading into a hazy blue light, fluctuating and indistinct.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was concentrating on this divine ability, he felt a strange force approaching. Knowing it was the mysterious Azure Bird beginning to impart its power, he quickly steadied his mind, awaiting the impending pressure.</p><p>This wasn't his first time bearing the Azure Bird's power, but the pressure intensified with each attempt. As his cultivation improved, so did the power the Azure Bird imparted, pushing Qin Sang to his limits.</p><p>Within the blue light…</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave, his body trembling slightly.</p><p>A terrifying pressure assaulted him. The Sky-Feeling Thunder Robe blazed with lightning, illuminating the cave in a bluish-green hue.  These thunderbolts formed a ring that coursed around the surface of the robe. With each pass, the robe's luster deepened, becoming infinitely heavier, though its shape remained unchanged.</p><p>The pressure continued to rise. This journey was crucial; every increment of power the Sky-Feeling Thunder Robe gained increased their chances of success.</p><p>Finally, the mysterious Azure Bird ceased its transmission.</p><p>Unlike before, the Sky-Feeling Thunder Robe remained on Qin Sang, continuing to protect him.  Similarly, the pressure would persist until he could endure no longer.</p><p>To maintain the Sky-Feeling Thunder Robe, Qin Sang had to focus most of his attention.</p><p>"It's coming!"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird's voice echoed again, this time a warning.</p><p>Before the words fully faded, another wave of power surged. Qin Sang's expression changed, but he held firm.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang sensed an unprecedented shift in the celestial omen.</p><p>The feeling was indescribable. It felt as though a mysterious force was trying to peel him from the world, or perhaps two worlds were superimposed, and a gateway had opened before him, about to transport him to another realm.</p><p>This power appeared suddenly with the celestial omen.</p><p>A strange, multicolored light shimmered around Qin Sang, beautiful and dreamlike, captivating and enchanting.</p><p>Even Qin Sang's body seemed ethereal, as if he’d transformed into a colorful butterfly flitting between dream and reality.</p><p>Qin Sang understood: his status as an outsider likely attracted the celestial omen.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird was unaware of the changes in Qin Sang. The second ability it imparted was intended to actively send Qin Sang to where the treasure would appear.</p><p>Two paths converged.</p><p>With the situation unclear, Qin Sang, intending to continue his act, didn't reveal the truth to the Azure Bird. He kept his eyes closed, outwardly still, but a blue rune suddenly glowed on his forehead.</p><p>Then, with the rune as its center, blue light rapidly rotated, distorting space. Qin Sang's body was sucked into the vortex of light, twisting violently before being completely swallowed.</p><p>In the next moment, the cave was empty, Qin Sang vanished, and all disturbances ceased.</p><p>While described in detail, from the celestial omen's change to Qin Sang's disappearance, it all happened in an instant. Qin Sang couldn't react; he acted purely on instinct.</p><p>…</p><p>In the desert west of Yongtu Immortal City…</p><p>lay an oasis inhabited by a unique tribe.</p><p>The oasis was sizable, but more impressively, a lake lay at its center.  No matter how arid the season, the lake never dried up, nourishing all life within the oasis.</p><p>Four streams branched from the lake, flowing in different directions, then further dividing to ensure every member of the unique tribe received their share of precious water.</p><p>A white cloud drifted down from the sky.</p><p>Two figures stood atop the cloud.  They were humanoid, but their features differed greatly from humans; they possessed only one eye situated in the center of their face – the ancestors of the One-Eyed tribe.</p><p>One-Eyed cultivators, upon reaching a certain level, would have their physical bodies regress into refined energy, merging into their eyes, eventually even the eyes would be refined, transforming into pure spiritual bodies.</p><p>Two One-Eyed Cultivators, lacking sufficient cultivation, were dispatched to inspect the oasis's water sources.  Their physical bodies remained intact.</p><p>Gazing downward, the two One-Eyed individuals' single eyes flashed.</p><p>One, clad in armor, sighed, "The spring at the lake bottom shows signs of drying up. This year's drought is unprecedented. I wonder if it's due to the bloodshed we've caused all these years, incurring Heaven's wrath…"</p><p>"Careful!" his companion sharply rebuked.</p><p>The armored cultivator, realizing his slip, quickly changed the subject, "No time to waste, let's quickly set up the spirit array."</p><p>He produced several small flags and leaped from the clouds, only to find his companion was gone!  He spun around in startled horror.</p><p>North of Yongtu City.</p><p>A small mountain village, distant from the demon tribe, was spared forced relocation by Yongtu City. The outside war hadn't disturbed its peace.  Nestled beside a stream fed by clear, cold mountain spring water—the villagers' source of drinking water—a creaking sound echoed along the path.</p><p>Moments later, a young boy appeared at the path's end, carrying water buckets toward the stream.</p><p>"Once the buckets are full, I can make medicine for Mother.  If she recovers, I can ask for Qiaolian's hand in marriage…"  He daydreamed, lost in blissful anticipation.  Then, he vanished, leaving only a flash of strange light.</p><p>Within Yongtu City.</p><p>A squad of celestial guards, mostly comprised of otherworldly beings, received new orders and prepared for battle.  During a headcount, the captain discovered one member missing.</p><p>"Where's Old Four?" he frowned.</p><p>After glances exchanged amongst themselves, one stepped forward, "Three days ago, Fourth Brother asked me to help him refine a magic artifact. I left halfway through; maybe he's still working on it?"</p><p>"Let's go check!"</p><p>They arrived at the man's cave, activating the protective barrier, but received no response.  Bound by years of teamwork and deep camaraderie, they were torn between concern for their comrade's safety and the fear of disturbing him at a crucial moment.  The cave was empty.</p><p>Similar events unfolded simultaneously across various locations.  A family's elders witnessed their patriarch consumed by a strange light, vanishing before their eyes.  Others disappeared without a trace, leaving loved ones bewildered and searching for clues.  Most victims were otherworldly beings.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he'd become a butterfly, adrift in the currents of a mysterious force.  Wave after wave of this power washed over him; he focused all his energy on maintaining his Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe.  He eventually landed on a mountain, surrounded by peaks in a remote mountain range, unaware of his location.</p><p>"Senior, where am I?"  Qin Sang attempted to communicate with the mysterious Azure Vermillion Bird but received no reply.  He called again and again, to no avail.</p><p>His heart sank.  The Azure Vermillion Bird had just been imparting its abilities, making sudden silence inexplicable.  Even under attack, it would find a way to warn him.  Unless…</p><p>His eyes flickered. Unless this was an isolated space, severing their connection.  Temporary silence didn't mean complete isolation; perhaps the Azure Vermillion Bird was trying to contact him, and communication would resume later.  Since reaching the Void Refinement stage, Qin Sang's connection with the Azure Vermillion Bird had deepened, enabling easier communication and subtle awareness of his cultivation advancements, even without breakthroughs.</p><p>Therefore, he remained cautious, even with the suspected severed connection. Clad in his Heavenly Perception Thunder Robe, remaining hidden, he found himself alone, contrary to his expectations.  Where were the others?</p>
