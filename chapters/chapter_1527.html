<h1>Chapter 1518: A Puppet Body (4k)</h1><p>Leaving Nine Rings Island, I went to the Ghost Mother’s Cave.</p><p>Tan Hao was in seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang went to where the Myriad Spirits Fruit tree was cultivated, carefully probing with her spiritual sense. She could clearly perceive the life force.</p><p>There's a high probability of reviving the Myriad Spirits Fruit tree, but it’s unknown how long it will take to grow and bear fruit.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully dug up the roots, using restrictions to prevent the spiritual energy from dissipating, preparing to take it back to Beichen Realm.</p><p>The Beichen Realm gate could not be abandoned under any circumstances.</p><p>In case Qingyang Sect could no longer stay in the North Sea, at least there would be a retreat.</p><p>Qin Sang had just dug up the roots when the door creaked open, and Tan Hao came out.</p><p>Qin Sang looked him up and down, cupped her hands and smiled, "Congratulations, Brother Tan!"</p><p>The Qi in Tan Hao's body was exceptionally steady, like the water of a deep pool, without a ripple.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could see that there was actually a surging undercurrent in Tan Hao's body, a certain momentum was accumulating.</p><p>Fullness leads to overflow; it was time to break through to the Yuan Ying stage!</p><p>It shouldn't take too long!</p><p>Tan Hao smiled slightly, “I didn’t expect it to go so smoothly. The effect of the morning bell and evening drum was better than expected, otherwise I would have needed at least ten years of seclusion!”</p><p>"This is a secret of the Jinghai Sect, it's Brother Tan's good fortune…"</p><p>Qin Sang talked about the origin and secrets of the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Tan Hao was surprised, "Brother Qin, these days, it seems I've missed a lot of big things?"</p><p>He had been wholeheartedly in seclusion, unconcerned with worldly affairs, and didn't even know that the Boundless Sea had changed, unaware of Qin Sang's actions.</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head slightly and smiled, "No big event is more important than Brother Tan's breakthrough. I will personally protect you in seclusion. During this time, I'll find a place for Qingyang Sect to settle, then you and your son can reunite."</p><p>"Hong'er, Yi'en…"</p><p>Thinking of his loved ones, Tan Hao was lost in thought.</p><p>Saving Tan Jie had been his obsession in the past, causing him to neglect many things and endure the painful separation from his own flesh and blood.</p><p>Now Tan Jie is dead, Shi Hong is aging prematurely, thankfully Tan Yi'en met Qin Sang.</p><p>He still has one relative alive.</p><p>"Brother Qin plans to move Qingyang Sect here?"</p><p>Tan Hao was lost in thought for a while before realizing the key issue.</p><p>"Brother Tan doesn't know yet, the Boundless Sea is no longer the same Boundless Sea…"</p><p>Qin Sang briefly explained a few things.</p><p>Tan Hao's jaw dropped in disbelief. He had only been in seclusion for more than ten years, and he no longer recognized the outside world; it felt like a lifetime ago!</p><p>Although Qin Sang's words were always understated, Tan Hao could tell that she seemed to have played an important role in this upheaval.</p><p>Repeatedly shocked by this fellow disciple, Tan Hao was already numb and readily accepted this fact.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Tan Hao hesitated slightly and said, "Brother Qin, if I'm lucky enough to succeed in my breakthrough, may I ask for a place to stay in Qingyang Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and feigned reproach, "Brother Tan, why are you so formal? We were fellow disciples, the Demon Flame lineage of Qingyang Sect were disciples deceived by the Jiupāo Daoist.  In fact, you are their elder. Besides, Yi'en is now managing everything in Qingyang Sect. This connection, Brother Tan, you can't cut it even if you want to!"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, "Back then, I was able to build my foundation thanks to the pills gifted by Brother Qin and Senior Yunyouzi, otherwise, how could I be where I am today? After returning, I must go to Qingyang Sect to pay homage to the seniors."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent for a moment and talked about her plan to search for the ancient road and go to the Central Plains.</p><p>Tan Hao sighed, "Brother Qin has great ambitions, unfortunately, I can't follow in your footsteps. I've received your kindness many times, always unable to repay you before we part again. Time goes by, I can only wish you success in your future cultivation! Rest assured, after you leave, I will take good care of Qingyang Sect for you."</p><p>"With Brother Tan's words, I'm relieved!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Tan Hao, Qin Sang began to search according to her original plan.</p><p>Stopping and starting, several islands she passed were not satisfactory.</p><p>It wasn't because the islands were already occupied.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't deliberately conceal her whereabouts; along the way, she visited fellow cultivators, who all treated her with courtesy.</p><p>Various forces took turns dominating the stage, including hidden sects, which broadened Qin Sang's horizons.</p><p>Most of the islands were newly occupied by them, so giving them up was no loss, and they were happy to establish a good relationship with Qin Sang and Xuantian Palace.</p><p>A strong individual is not terrible, what is terrible is that they have the North Sea's number one sect behind them!</p><p>To some extent, Qin Sang and Xuantian Palace mutually achieved success.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang's requirements were too high. These islands either lacked sufficient spiritual energy, were too remote, or had too few nearby islands, lacking depth.</p><p>Qin Sang ultimately chose Huangtian Island, one of his initial selections.</p><p>Located in the southeastern part of the Boundless Sea, yet maintaining a safe distance from Xuantian Palace, Huangtian Island was once the base of the Huangtian Sect, a powerful force in the Boundless Sea with three Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Sect suffered a devastating blow when two of its Yuan Ying masters were trapped by the Exquisite Pagoda.  The third, away at the time, rushed back upon hearing the news, but disappeared en route.</p><p>Huangtian Sect was known for its ruthlessness and had made many enemies.  No one knew who was responsible for their downfall, nor did anyone particularly care.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang arrived, Huangtian Sect was in ruins, its members scattered, and outsiders had begun to carve up the remains. Chaos reigned on the island.  Qin Sang, however, managed to restore order through negotiation, and ultimately claimed the island for himself.</p><p>Huangtian Island is surrounded by a thousand smaller islands, perfect for the Qingyang Sect's expansion.  Qin Sang renamed the archipelago the Cui Ming Islands, and Huangtian Island itself became Qingyang Island. He intends to control only a core group of islands, allowing other cultivators to practice freely in the area.</p><p>“Senior, this will be a new beginning!”  Qin Sang erected a jade stele inscribed with the character ‘Qin’ on Qingyang Island, tapped it gently, summoned his Yunyou Sword, and softly declared.</p><p>He then proceeded to set up an array obtained from Mount Tian, crafting and deploying protective formations around the island.  By the time the protective array was complete, the date of his agreement with Tan Hao was approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang sealed Qingyang Island and returned to the Ghost Mother's Cave. Two months later, Tan Hao finally began his breakthrough attempt.</p><p>To prepare for the Heavenly Tribulation, Qin Sang brought Tan Hao back to Qingyang Island. Tan Hao remained on the island, activating the protective array, while Qin Sang provided external protection.</p><p>Initially, it was a tense wait.</p><p>Soon, however, Qin Sang sensed the approaching Heavenly Tribulation, signaling Tan Hao's successful advancement to the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>The tribulation arrived swiftly. The sky above Qingyang Island darkened, ominous clouds gathered, and thunder brewed.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the tribulation unfold. Tan Hao’s ascension seemed to progress smoothly, causing Qin Sang to nod approvingly.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed. He retrieved an item – the Yang Puppet Crystal given to him by Dongyang Bo before his death.  The crystal emitted a faint, yet undeniable, flicker.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang glanced at Qingyang Island, then dispatched the python banner and the captured snow python to protect Tan Hao.  He himself moved with lightning speed to an outer island of the Cui Ming Islands, one of the largest three. This island held a substantial human population, once kept as sustenance by Huangtian Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang’s purpose was clear. He targeted a specific young man at the city gate.</p><p>Simultaneously, the young man looked up and met Qin Sang’s gaze.</p><p>In the next instant, his body exploded in a bloody mess, showering the surrounding populace with gore and causing many casualties.</p><p>A foul-smelling mass of blood and flesh shot towards Qin Sang. From within, a dark ray zipped away in another direction.</p><p>The ray contained a small figure, about the size of a palm, that was not a Yuan Ying but strikingly resembled Gui General.</p><p>This was indeed Gui General, inhabiting a puppet body.  At the Exquisite Pagoda, facing certain death, he'd resorted to a desperate measure: merging his soul with the puppet, burning his life force in the process.</p><p>He had obtained the puppet crystal from Dongyang Bo, partly by force, partly in exchange. Refining it had greatly enhanced his puppet's abilities.  Exploiting the puppet's inanimate nature, he had managed to escape.</p><p>But this was a double-edged sword.  Once merged, he could no longer separate himself from the puppet. His personality was being influenced by it, making emotional control increasingly difficult and hindering further cultivation.</p><p>Gui General harbored intense hatred for Qin Sang, the cause of his downfall. He secretly allied with demons escaping from the Sacred Land, planning a gradual revenge.</p><p>However, these demons, having not suffered as much as him, were only paying lip service.  They had no intention of provoking Qin Sang again.  Of course, they would not refuse an opportunity if it presented itself.</p><p>Sensing their insincerity, Gui General was furious.  Recently, he learned of Qin Sang's reappearance in the Boundless Sea, igniting his thirst for revenge and prompting him to follow.</p><p>He still remembered Qin Sang’s ability to detect his puppet at the Exquisite Pagoda.  Therefore, he maintained a safe distance, using low-level cultivators to spy on Qin Sang, waiting to see his next move.</p><p>Tan Hao had just finished his tribulation.  The Ghost General, sensing the tribulation thunder, couldn't contain himself and self-sealed, hiding his puppet body among low-level cultivators, attempting to approach.</p><p>As long as he didn't act, the puppet was just an inanimate object, and wouldn't likely be exposed.  However, he hadn't even gotten close to Qingyang Island before Qin Sang locked onto him.</p><p>At that moment, the Ghost General finally understood that Qin Sang had discovered his whereabouts, not through sharp senses, but for another reason. But it was too late. He was furious and terrified.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted. He hadn't been deliberately revealing his location; he'd intended to lure out his enemy.  He hadn't expected to catch such a big fish.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace had given special attention to the demon clan. Not only had the Hun Mo Elder escaped with his soul, but the Ghost General had escaped as well.</p><p>Judging by his condition, something was clearly wrong. He was clearly inhabiting a puppet body.</p><p>During its flight, the puppet rapidly expanded, becoming the size of an adult in an instant.  Its features were expressive, its face animated, and its body indistinguishable from a normal human’s. It was hard to believe it was a puppet.</p><p>Encountering his enemy, the Ghost General's eyes blazed with rage. He couldn't suppress his anger, yet he also felt fear and regret.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The puppet's escape technique was truly extraordinary, breaking through the void like a meteor.</p><p>Though consumed by hatred, he hadn’t completely lost his reason. He had prepared a backup plan at his hiding place.  Reaching it offered a chance to escape Qin Sang.</p><p>As his target came into view, a look of intense joy appeared in the Ghost General's eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, a cold snort echoed in his ears.</p><p>“Hmph! Ha!”</p><p>The Ghost General felt as if his soul had been struck by a heavy hammer; a searing pain shot through him, his body trembled, and his face contorted in agony.  It was Qin Sang's Soul Capture Incantation.</p><p>Since acquiring this secret technique, he had been constantly studying it.  Because of the Soul-Nurturing Wood, his cultivation of soul techniques was much faster than others, and he mastered the incantation quickly.</p><p>His training was still short, so Qin Sang couldn’t modify the incantation like Yin Changsheng could. He chanted the “hmph ha” incantation straightforwardly, feeling somewhat strange each time he used it.</p><p>Qin Sang correctly guessed the Ghost General was inhabiting a puppet and, lacking the support of a physical body, used the Soul Capture Incantation. It worked perfectly.</p><p>The Ghost General was quite formidable; his body shook slightly, but he suppressed the pain, focusing on escaping.</p><p>But for Qin Sang, that short time was more than enough.</p><p>A bolt of lightning surpassed the Ghost General, blocking his path.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hold back; a crimson glow appeared before him as he summoned the Solar God Tree.</p><p>The Ghost General was terrified, turning to flee, only to find Qin Sang's avatar blocking his path.</p><p>The Solar God Tree was, of course, a feint.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to capture the Ghost General alive, and the Golden Sinking Sword shot out, a sword array descending upon him.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The Ghost General and the avatar clashed.</p><p>Having lost his treasures and body in the stone tablet space, he hadn't dared to act conspicuously since his escape, lacking a suitable magical weapon, and could only use the puppet’s own abilities.</p><p>The puppet’s body was as hard as iron.  Its powerful fist struck out, runes flashing and forming a bloodthirsty ghost face, exuding terrifying killing intent.</p><p>The avatar fought back relentlessly, continuously changing hand seals and unleashing techniques, firmly blocking the Ghost General's retreat.</p><p>The Ghost General failed to break through the blockade.  As he tried to attack again, darkness fell, and he found himself trapped in the sword array.</p><p>Pulling him into the sword array made it much easier to deal with him.</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, summoning demonic fire and slightly infusing it into the sword array.</p><p>The sword array trapped and killed, the avatar attacked relentlessly.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang inflicted numerous sword wounds and ice marks on the puppet. Although he hadn't injured any vital points, he could clearly feel the Ghost General's energy waning.</p><p>The Ghost General roared angrily, but his efforts were futile, his strength only outward.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned to wear down the Ghost General like he did with Yin Dianzhu, waiting for the right moment before making his final strike to capture him alive.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a cold smile appeared on the Ghost General's face, his eyes suddenly dulling, while his inner energy rapidly increased, becoming violently unstable.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. He unleashed the Soul Capture Incantation and the demonic fire, forcefully interrupting the puppet's self-destruction, but he couldn't stop the Ghost General's determination to die.</p><p>In his final moment, the Ghost General glared at Qin Sang, his hatred boundless, as if saying that he wouldn't reveal the whereabouts of the other demons.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.  He summoned the puppet into his hand, finding it very unusual; quite different from his senior sister's, more like a life-bound treasure.</p><p>Even if it fell into the hands of others after the Ghost General's death, it couldn't be controlled.</p><p>Qin Sang searched around but found no other demons. Amidst the shocked gazes of many, he returned to Qingyang Island, examining the puppet repeatedly.</p><p>He had considered obtaining the Yin Puppet Crystal within, but found it fused with the puppet itself. After much examination, he couldn't find a way to separate them, so he temporarily stored it with the Yang Puppet Crystal.</p><p>At that moment, a figure flew out from Qingyang Island – Tan Hao, having successfully completed his tribulation!</p>
