<h1>Chapter 1260: A Secret Passage</h1><p>Qin Sang had never witnessed his senior sister's prowess firsthand.  Before her ascension to the Nascent Soul stage, she had always seemed enigmatic. Her strength was unquestionable; otherwise, the self-proclaimed righteous ancestors like the Red-Haired Ancestor wouldn't have so easily conceded when they discovered Qing Jun's usurpation.</p><p>However, to Qin Sang's surprise, even after his own advancement to the Nascent Soul stage, putting him on equal footing with his senior sister, she remained an enigma, impossible to fathom.  This mysterious aura had intensified in recent years, like a deep, unfathomable pool.</p><p>Among the Nascent Soul cultivators Qin Sang had encountered in the Northern Star Realm, only Ye Laomo evoked a similar feeling.  Reflecting on it, the source seemed to stem from his request for the fragmented demonic banner before his trip to the Abyssal Ruins.</p><p>Qing Jun had taught him the "Lifeless Demon Seal," a demonic art. She had confessed to being plagued by it for many years, only recently resolving the hidden dangers from cultivating it—likely connected to the matter. After resolving these dangers, his senior sister's strength must have surged.</p><p>"Could my senior sister's cultivation be comparable to that of the Profound Mystery Demon Lord and the others?"</p><p>This conjecture startled Qin Sang.  The True One Daoist, the Profound Mystery Demon Lord, and the rest—weren't they all the products of centuries of arduous cultivation?  Reaching the Nascent Soul stage required exceptional talent, except for himself, an anomaly. Even he had benefited from a unique cultivation technique that enhanced his innate abilities.  Even with Qing Jun's Heaven Spirit root, achieving such a high level of cultivation in such a short time made her a peerless figure.</p><p>Nevertheless, these were merely Qin Sang's speculations. Perhaps his senior sister possessed a unique cultivation technique with exceptional concealment methods.  Given the sensitive nature of the matter concerning Qing Jun, he refrained from asking further questions.</p><p>The Profound Mystery Demon Lord, Qing Jun, Qin Sang, and Jing Yu—a total of four. Qin Sang and Jing Yu, both members of the demon race, needed Jing Yu's guidance.  With Qin Sang's evident strength, their decision to participate met with no objection.</p><p>After reaching an agreement, they immediately sprang into action. The Profound Mystery Demon Lord and Qing Jun transferred the jade talismans to Si Di and the others. Xiang Qing's body blazed with demonic fire; the spiritual fire he controlled differed subtly from before, now infused with the Ancestor Saint Fire, possessing a more domineering aura.</p><p>With Xiang Qing leading the formation, the others used their respective methods to assist with all their might. The grand formation swayed slightly before stabilizing, with barely any change from before.  This change couldn't be concealed for long, but it was enough to buy them time to infiltrate.</p><p>The jade talismans changed hands.  The group suddenly altered their offensive, maneuvering the Reverse and Right Nine Palaces Array to retreat, feigning a withdrawal.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi and the others, who were manipulating the Flag Gate Array, noticed their movements and were puzzled.</p><p>"What?  Do they realize they can't break through and are retreating?"</p><p>Another Nascent Soul cultivator in charge of the flags exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>A nearby person scoffed, "It's not that easy! The Profound Mystery Demon Lord is notoriously cunning. He's probably given up on a direct assault to avoid wasting energy. He's likely preparing an ambush, waiting for us to emerge before launching a surprise attack."</p><p>"If that ancient cultivator still has the strength to fight back, leading to a mutual destruction, they might succeed.  Such a pity…"</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator chuckled.</p><p>Jiang Chenzi frowned.</p><p>The Reverse and Right Nine Palaces Array, with its ever-changing formations, obscured the movements within, making it difficult to discern their intentions. They could only watch and wait.</p><p>They didn't hinder their retreat.  The priority was the main objective; the status of the ancient cultivator was uncertain, and they wished to conserve their strength in case of unforeseen circumstances.  Defending the entrance to the Blood Pool was sufficient.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, do not relax!  The Profound Mystery Demon Lord might be feinting!"</p><p>Jiang Chenzi warned loudly.</p><p>As Jiang Chenzi predicted, the Reverse and Right Nine Palaces Array, after retreating a distance, suddenly unleashed two beams of yin and yang light, transforming into sharp swords that pierced forward.  Simultaneously, the grand array, instead of retreating further, advanced even faster than before.</p><p>"Stop them!"</p><p>Jiang Chenzi remained calm. Everyone worked together to activate the three Flag Gates, firmly blocking the path of the Reverse and Right Nine Palaces Array.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and the other three had secretly detached themselves from the Reverse and Right Nine Palaces Array, concealed their figures, and returned to the blood mist.  At the center of the array, a ball of black light pulsed, representing the illusion of the central black tower.  It was being replenished by the power of the Black Tower Array, slowly reconstituting itself.  However, the clash between the two grand formations at the entrance to the Blood Pool caused disturbances, disrupting the illusion repeatedly.  This provided the perfect opportunity.</p><p>The four, aware of the urgency, immediately moved, circling around to another direction, plunging into the illusion to locate the weak point in the ancient restriction.</p><p>The blood pool was vast.  Surrounded by illusions, even though they were damaged, finding the ancient restriction's weak point and entering required considerable effort.</p><p>Fortunately, with Jing Yu leading the way and the Sky-Eye Butterfly assisting, after some searching, the four finally located a fissure.</p><p>They stopped.</p><p>Thick blood mist surrounded them.</p><p>Before them lay a corridor of black stone, originally connecting to the black tower. Now, with the tower collapsed, it was a dead end.  The lingering shockwaves from the clashing formations continued to disturb the illusions, causing cracks to spread across the corridor, threatening imminent collapse, revealing its illusory nature.</p><p>Without much difficulty, they found the true location of the ancient restriction—an invisible barrier.</p><p>Damage was indeed present on the barrier, but unfortunately, the crack was too small, with powerful ancient restrictive energy still flowing within the fissure.</p><p>"Forcing our way in is unwise! Even if we succeed, it would cause a considerable disturbance, alerting Ye Laomo inside,"</p><p>Qin Sang examined the barrier, then shook his head.</p><p>Undeterred, they immediately changed direction, searching for another weak point.</p><p>After trying three more locations, they finally discovered a suitable spot behind the collapsed tower. Here, the ancient restriction was weaker; a combined assault by the four should create a gap barely large enough for one person to pass through.</p><p>Finding a better option seemed impossible, so they decided to act here.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun again summoned his Yin Thunder Gourd.</p><p>Qing Jun brought forth a Xuan iron black tower, inscribed with the three characters 'Five Directions Tower'.  It was a treasured heirloom of the Yuanshen Sect.</p><p>After killing Leng Yuntian, the Five Directions Tower fell into her possession.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but take another look. He had previously seen Leng Yuntian wield it while attempting the Ziwei Palace celestial array.  Due to a trap, the tower's power remained untapped before being defiled by the Blood-Soiling Divine Light.</p><p>As a Yuanshen Sect heirloom, the Five Directions Tower was among the top-tier magical artifacts.  He wondered, compared to the Eighteen Demon Banners, which was stronger?</p><p>Qin Sang mused that in terms of destructive power, the Five Directions Tower probably couldn't match the Eighteen Demon Banners.</p><p>The Eighteen Demon Banners had already displayed power exceeding the typical capabilities of a magical artifact.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang summoned the Demon Banners, preparing for battle.</p><p>Jing Yu stood beside him, holding the Thunder Bead—her only treasure. In her hands, it shone with true brilliance, far surpassing the meager five percent output achievable by Pang Ji.</p><p>Qin Sang's task was to create as many opportunities as possible for Jing Yu to seize the Corpse Flower Blood Jasper.</p>
