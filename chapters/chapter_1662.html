<h1>Chapter 1653:  True Yang Refining Demons</h1><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Heavenly fire rained down incessantly, the deafening roar shaking the earth.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was obscured by the intense flames, his features blurred.</p><p>A brief pause.</p><p>Another fireball plummeted before him.  Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang manifested a protective energy shield and charged without hesitation into the Yang Flame Divine Restriction.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The moment he entered, he triggered the restriction, feeling a wave of scorching heat wash over him, making his scalp tingle.</p><p>Invisible, crimson clouds surged, birthing new fireballs that locked onto Qin Sang and crashed down!</p><p>More perilous still, nearby fireballs were drawn in by the energy, altering their course.  Those close charged directly at him, while those farther away seemed to anticipate his trajectory, pursuing and intercepting him.</p><p>Qin Sang was like a drop of water in boiling oil; his intrusion threw the entire area into chaos.</p><p>From outside, his figure was completely invisible.</p><p>Qin Sang was surrounded by heavenly fire on all sides. A single strike, even if it didn't kill him, would trigger a chain reaction, allowing him to fully experience the true might of the Divine Restriction.</p><p>In this situation, Qin Sang could only maneuver through the gaps between fireballs, thankful that the Divine Restriction was ownerless.</p><p>Fortunately, to maintain its ceaseless flow, the falling heavenly fire’s trajectory was immutable. The fireballs couldn't endlessly pursue Qin Sang, preventing them from accumulating endlessly, giving him room to maneuver.</p><p>Most fireballs plunged into the sea of fire, reintegrating into the Divine Restriction.</p><p>However, some collided while pursuing Qin Sang. If their internal energy faltered, an explosion would occur, instantly unleashing a dazzling ring of fire, its power no less than the fire waves below.</p><p>The fire rings swept with explosive force.</p><p>Each time this happened, Qin Sang would flap his phoenix wings, quickly darting through the gaps in the Yang Flame Heavenly Fire. For now, he seemed to be handling it with relative ease.</p><p>While flying, Qin Sang simultaneously communicated with his Sky Eye Butterfly, analyzing the Yang Flame Divine Restriction, and activated secret techniques, manifesting a fire lotus in his palm.</p><p>Within the fire lotus, flames flowed, with the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the Ancestor Saint Fire, and other spirit fires he had subdued flashing alternately. He attempted to use the fire lotus or a particular spirit fire to resist or redirect the Yang Flame Heavenly Fire.</p><p>He pursued both strategies simultaneously, searching for a way to break the restriction.</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang’s entry, Su Zinan and the other followed to the edge of the Yang Flame Divine Restriction. After a moment's hesitation, seeing Qin Sang moving further away, they pursued relentlessly.</p><p>Some of the Yang Flame Heavenly Fire was drawn away by Qin Sang, but the Yang Flame energy within the restriction was inexhaustible.  The Yang Flame Heavenly Fire surrounding Su Zinan and the other was no less numerous than that surrounding Qin Sang.  Indeed, their reluctance to be too close to each other actually attracted more Yang Flame Heavenly Fire.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Su Zinan flicked a finger, sending his black staff flying. Thousands of staff shadows shot out.</p><p>The staff shadows did not directly target the Yang Flame Heavenly Fire, as this would cause them to explode—a lesson learned earlier. Instead, the shadows struck empty space, their ripples scattering, their force significantly softened.</p><p>Several fireballs that were obliquely colliding were disturbed by the staff shadows, their direction slightly shifted, creating a gap.</p><p>Simultaneously, Mo Xingdao used his Xuan Qi to create a shield, blocking a fire ring charging from one side. The two, one in front and one behind, passed through the gap.</p><p>Being two people, working together, they certainly found it easier than Qin Sang, but in such an environment, speed was inevitably hampered.</p><p>They could only patiently use various treasures to counter the heavenly fire and continue their pursuit.</p><p>…</p><p>While the three pursued.</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>The two from Jade Platform Sect deliberately avoided Qin Sang and the others, detouring before reaching the Yang Flame Divine Restriction.</p><p>Unable to see the terrifying Yang Flame Heavenly Fire, the female cultivator felt both fear and excitement, looking at her senior brother with anticipation.</p><p>The man in white robes flicked his wrist, sending his Crimson Fire Sword flying. It soared above them, its blade suspended upside down.</p><p>"Yang Flame Seal!"</p><p>He silently formed hand seals, his fingers extended and joined like a sword, rapidly pointing upward.  His fingers turned crimson, a small flame leaping to the tip of the Crimson Fire Sword, instantly splitting into flames that flowed along the blade.</p><p>The next moment, the Crimson Fire Sword hummed, transforming into a Yang Flame Magic Sword.  Sword shadows split into light, forming a sword wheel; sword shadows like flowing fire continuously revolved around them.</p><p>The aura of the flowing fire shadows was remarkably similar to the Yang Flame Heavenly Fire.</p><p>The man in white robes seemed to struggle somewhat in controlling the Yang Flame Magic Sword. He nodded to the female cultivator, using the sword wheel to envelop them both before flying into the Yang Flame Divine Restriction.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A mass of Yang Flame Heavenly Fire fell directly in front of them.</p><p>The female cultivator held her breath, observing through the curtain of sword shadows, she was overjoyed to see that the Yang Flame Heavenly Fire only slightly altered its course, plunging straight into the sea of fire.</p><p>The Yang Flame Sword, while not completely masking their presence, proved highly effective.  With caution, they could move freely.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist let out a sigh of relief.  Their sect's legacy was fragmented, lacking the methods to manipulate the Yang Flame Divine Restriction. Otherwise, they wouldn't have feared the powerful cultivators within.</p><p>Fortunately, the Yang Flame Seal remained, and it proved highly effective.</p><p>Under the sword's protection, they moved swiftly through the Yang Flame Divine Restriction, far faster than Qin Sang and the others, and with a clear objective.  Instead of heading straight for the summit, they gradually moved towards the center of the restriction, the convergence point of the Yang Flame Celestial Fire's energy.</p><p>Initially, the female cultivator calculated their distance, but later gave up. They had already surpassed the summit of Emperor Mandate Mountain, yet their target was still far off—the restriction had warped the space.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more intense the Celestial Fire became.  Even with the sword's protection, they had to proceed with utmost care.</p><p>After much maneuvering, they finally reached their destination.</p><p>Before them, a boundless sea of fire rained down like fire from the heavens.  Within this inferno, a clear area had been carved out.  Free from flames, the Celestial Fire did not fall within this space. There, a section of cliff face and a cave dwelling were revealed.</p><p>The cliff face, abruptly appearing within the fiery sea, was surrounded by flames above and below.  It seemed to be a portion of Emperor Mandate Mountain, isolated by the restriction.</p><p>The edge of this area was where the Yang Flame Divine Restriction was at its strongest.  The two struggled to pass, facing several near-death experiences and breaking into a cold sweat.</p><p>Entering the cliff area, they were astonished by the stillness; not a trace of heat could be sensed.</p><p>The cave's stone door was shut, protected only by a simple barrier. The external Yang Flame Divine Restriction served as its main defense.</p><p>They exchanged a glance.</p><p>Exercising caution, the white-robed Daoist cast a talisman, creating a molten rock golem to open the door.  The interior was instantly illuminated by the firelight from outside.</p><p>They saw a figure seated with its back to the entrance.  The back of its head, with its hair and flesh, was perfectly preserved, lifelike.</p><p>Their hearts pounded; the female cultivator almost cried out.</p><p>The next moment, due to a shift in the cave's energy, the figure turned to ash.</p><p>"Dead!"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist relaxed, then looked inside again, surprised to find an old man.</p><p>The old man sat amidst intertwined flames, seemingly connected to the external Yang Flame Celestial Fire.  The Yang Flame energy flowed continuously, forming a bell-shaped fire shield around him.</p><p>"This formation… it seems to be refining a demon with True Yang energy…"</p><p>The white-robed Daoist's mind raced. His gaze fell upon a crimson jade pendant embedded in the top of the fire shield.</p><p>(End)</p>
