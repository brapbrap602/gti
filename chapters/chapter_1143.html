<h1>Chapter 1135: Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea</h1><p>Qin Sang had met the Feather Demon King before.</p><p>To enter the Purple Micro Palace, one must pass through the outer fairy array.  The Feather Demon King, using a treasure of the Witch Clan, found a flaw in the array, allowing him to set up a small Beichen Star Yuan array to break into the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>The Feather Demon King was extremely mysterious.</p><p>Even the Red-haired Ancestor and Zhenyi Daoist were wary of him.</p><p>“It seems the interior of the Sky Demon Mound is not at peace,”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>The white cat, seeming to have experienced danger, said with lingering fear: “Other places aren't like the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea, which has many gentle wood spirits… The territories controlled by the various Demon Kings are relatively stable, but only internally. If any outside demonic beasts stray in, they'd be devoured without a doubt…”</p><p>Qin Sang sat opposite the white cat, questioning him in detail about the Demon Realm.</p><p>“Does Daoist Friend Liu know of my existence?”</p><p>Qin Sang continued to ask.</p><p>He needed help to obtain the stone tablet, but he didn't know Old Willow Tree's temperament, and the Wandering Taoist hadn't had time to say much before.</p><p>The white cat seemed trustworthy, not harboring ill feelings towards him, and they had a past connection.</p><p>The question was whether other beasts in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea would dislike humans.</p><p>“He knows!”</p><p>Because of the Wandering Taoist, the white cat greatly trusted Qin Sang. “After Elder Bamboo Demon sent me a message, I returned to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea. Grandpa Willow instructed me to stay in the Immortal Demon City, awaiting Elder Bamboo Demon or Young Master Qin's return.  Young Master Qin, rest assured, Grandpa Willow is very kind and fiercely loyal to Elder Bamboo Demon.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the white cat.</p><p>The cat's tone was somewhat urgent, seeming to have sensed his worry and was eager to allay his concerns.</p><p>“Has something happened in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and without hiding his thoughts, he asked directly.</p><p>The white cat was startled and hung its head. “You can't hide it from Young Master… For years, the demon race has been constantly transferring troops to the front lines.  A while ago, I received news that the Feather Demon King has ordered the various Demon Kings to continue training their troops and prepare for a desperate battle.  It is said that this time is different, the outcome may be extremely disastrous. Elder Bamboo Demon is away, and I’m worried that Grandpa Willow and the disguise left behind by Elder Bamboo Demon won't hold up… if it's discovered…”</p><p>Currently, the war is still brewing, and the demon race is temporarily transferring troops according to the old rules, proceeding as usual.</p><p>But once the situation becomes critical, and the master of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea remains absent…</p><p>Thinking of the terrible consequences, the white cat couldn't help but shiver.</p><p>The Wandering Taoist hadn't anticipated the Abyss of Sin's quick resurgence, the situation becoming so tense.</p><p>His previous preparations probably wouldn't last much longer.</p><p>The beasts of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea understand the principle of "if one falls, all will fall," they aren't refusing to participate in the war, but they fear being discovered by other Demon Kings, resulting in all the beasts, regardless of age or strength, being driven to the front lines.</p><p>On the battlefield, without a Demon King's protection, they would only be cannon fodder.</p><p>Many of the creatures in the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea are wood spirits who have attained enlightenment, and many wood spirits have limited combat abilities, sending them to the battlefield is akin to sending them to their deaths.</p><p>“Elder Bamboo Demon spoke very highly of Young Master Qin… Does Young Master Qin have a solution?”</p><p>The white cat looked at Qin Sang with anticipation.</p><p>With the Wandering Taoist gone, she could only place all her hopes on Qin Sang.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang also felt the situation was difficult and the pressure immense.</p><p>The Wandering Taoist entrusted the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea to him before his death, and he would certainly do his utmost. But he hadn't even reached the Nascent Soul stage yet, protecting a region was simply too difficult for him.</p><p>However, for Qin Sang, the perilous situation of the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea might also be an opportunity.</p><p>The Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea desperately needed a protector, and the best choice was to fully assist him in obtaining the mysterious stone tablet, helping him to form his Nascent Soul.</p><p>Thinking of this, he decided to go to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea first.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, pacing back and forth, and mused: “Before the situation becomes critical, I might be able to help you buy some time. Once the situation becomes tense, I won't be able to do much, unless I can form my Nascent Soul before then.”</p><p>Qin Sang's answer made the white cat's eyes light up.</p><p>Then he heard something unexpected.</p><p>“Can you leave now and take me to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea to meet Daoist Friend Liu?” Qin Sang paused, and asked.</p><p>“Young Master Qin is going to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea?”</p><p>The white cat said with worry: “I stayed in the Immortal Demon City to wait for Young Master Qin, and I can return anytime. However, the journey back to the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea is long, and we need to bypass the territories of other Demon Kings. I should be fine on my own, but Young Master Qin is human…”</p><p>Human cultivators are very conspicuous entering the Heavenly Demon Hill and easily spotted.</p><p>"It doesn't have to be a human, then? Look at this..."</p><p>Qin Sang silently activated his incantation, using the Heavenly Demon Transformation ability.</p><p>A pair of phoenix wings sprouted from his back, and demonic energy surged around him, incredibly pure.  Without looking at his form and appearance, he could easily be mistaken for a demonic beast.</p><p>The white cat's eyes widened in shock, "Sir Qin was also a demon before? No wonder!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed helplessly.</p><p>This cat demon seemed to think that, like Yun You, he too was a fusion of human and demon souls.</p><p>"I'm not a demon. I merely cultivate a secret technique that allows me to manifest wings and generate demonic energy.  And look again!"</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang activated the disguise technique Yuan Zhu gave him, his aura immediately becoming subtle, restrained, and unfathomable.</p><p>"I can disguise myself as a powerful transformed demon. If I appear, it should deter those with ill intentions and prevent them from immediately oppressing the Thousand Mountain Demon Sea. However, this technique reveals itself if I use true energy; it's just a bluff."</p><p>Qin Sang also explained the technique's flaws to the white cat, sighing, "Safety gained through external means is temporary, like a fleeting illusion. In the cultivation world, strength is fundamental."</p><p>The white cat nodded sympathetically.</p><p>Hearing that Qin Sang had a way to solve the crisis in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, even if only temporarily, the white cat was still excited, its tail wagging.</p><p>"Sir Qin, time is of the essence; let's leave immediately!"</p><p>The white cat acted swiftly, settling all matters that day.</p><p>With only the two of them, their travel speed would be very fast.</p><p>Even with the Heavenly Demon Transformation, Qin Sang's appearance was too striking. He didn't want to encounter other Demon Kings; if a Demon King felt like sparring with him, his disguise would be blown.</p><p>They traveled as discreetly as possible, choosing remote and difficult paths, and with other disguise methods, they arrived at the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea without incident.</p><p>The Little Cold Region and the Sky Walk League are located north and south respectively, separated by the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>West of the Yun Cang Great Marsh, its scale gradually reduces, transforming into the Yun Cang River. The river flows into the far west of the Northern Star Realm, the vast and desolate Ice Sea.</p><p>Heavenly Demon Hill occupies the northwest coastline of the Northern Star Realm, stretching along the coast and continuing for a considerable distance south of the Yun Cang River.</p><p>However, the south of the river is a desert, and most Demon Kings prefer to establish themselves north of the river.</p><p>A region north of the river, close to the coast, is filled with continuous mountains and boundless bamboo forests.</p><p>Therefore, it is named the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.</p>
