<h1>Chapter 1591: The Meteorite Godwhip</h1><p>People came and went in the county city.  </p><p>Qin Sang, upon entering the city gate, sensed the presence of several Golden Core cultivators. This auction was clearly very attractive to them.</p><p>Tianzhong County was similar in size to Yan Shui Market.</p><p>The auction was held in the cultivator market in the west of the city.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his pace, strolling through the streets and alleys. Passing through the mortal marketplace, he witnessed the bustling everyday life, and for a moment, he remembered that he was still in the human world.</p><p>For over a hundred years, he had dedicated himself to cultivation, day and night, becoming a person apart from the world.</p><p>Recalling his ambitious pronouncements in Da Sui felt like a lifetime ago.</p><p>Now, he was among the very top tier in this world, yet still far from his goal. The path ahead was long and uncertain, leaving him no room for complacency.</p><p>The sounds of vendors calling out brought Qin Sang back to the present.</p><p>Fragrant aromas filled the air.</p><p>Despite his cultivation allowing him to abstain from food, Qin Sang found his appetite piqued.  He searched for shops, then suddenly remembered that his Qianjun Ring hadn't held any gold or silver for a long time.</p><p>Spirit stones were fine, but he feared causing trouble for the merchants.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to scan the street.  He noticed that most of the mortals had various ailments.  His expression shifted, and he took out several pills, gathering Qi and condensing water to dissolve the medicinal power.</p><p>He walked down the middle of the street; the bustling crowd parted to give him way, yet they seemed oblivious to his presence, detecting nothing unusual.</p><p>Without any apparent movement, various kinds of food appeared in his hands. He walked along the street, eating heartily without concern for appearances.</p><p>His stomach seemed bottomless; he thoroughly sampled the street's culinary offerings.</p><p>With each step Qin Sang took, a gentle rain fell, silently merging into the bodies of the mortals.</p><p>The mortals remained unaware.</p><p>“Hey, wife, my back… it’s healed!”</p><p>The first shop at the market entrance was a bun shop, run by an elderly couple for many years.</p><p>The old man had suffered an injury in his youth, leaving him with a lingering ailment.  As he aged, his back grew more and more stooped, and years of hard work caused him unbearable pain.</p><p>Just now, as the old man habitually put down a steamer basket, when he stood up, he found himself standing perfectly straight, startling himself.</p><p>“Whoa! Slow down! You’ve been saying you’d get medicine from the Yue Xian Master on North Street, but you’re too stingy! What’s gotten into you?”</p><p>The old woman was startled.  Her rolling pin fell to the ground.  She frantically waved her hands, then quickly stood up to help her husband, discovering that her legs didn't hurt either.</p><p>The couple looked at each other in astonishment.</p><p>Suddenly, a commotion erupted in the market, causing the couple to rush outside.</p><p>Everyone felt an unprecedented lightness. The ailments that had plagued them vanished in an instant.</p><p>Some knelt and cried out in joy.</p><p>“A god has appeared!”</p><p>“Heaven has eyes! A god has appeared!”</p><p>…</p><p>The gentle rain ceased.</p><p>Qin Sang wiped the oil from his mouth and calmly left the market.</p><p>At the market entrance, a male and female Golden Core cultivator happened to pass by, staring blankly at the refined and elegant figure, their faces full of disbelief.</p><p>Having satisfied his hunger, Qin Sang proceeded directly to the auction.</p><p>In a corner of the market.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before an unremarkable three-story wooden building, his expression unusual.</p><p>It was just an ordinary shop selling spirit materials, without the expected throng of people.  A few cultivators entered and exited, all at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>After glancing at his invitation, Qin Sang entered, immediately confirming he was in the right place. The seemingly young shopkeeper was actually a late Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Approaching the shopkeeper, he presented the invitation.</p><p>The shopkeeper opened it, his expression unchanged. He gestured towards the inner hall, “Please, honored guest.”</p><p>Entering the inner hall, the shopkeeper closed the door and bowed, “Gong Xingqing, the Tianzhong County steward of the Six States Hall, greets Senior Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and looked around. “Where is Daoist Jiang Mu?  Is this where you’re holding the auction?”</p><p>“Elder Jiang is currently occupied and unable to leave. He instructed me to treat Senior Qin with utmost respect.”</p><p>Gong Xingqing then opened a back door, revealing a spacious courtyard connected to the opposite building. “There are too many people outside, and we were concerned about disturbing Senior. When the auction begins, you can go through here.  …Does Senior Qin have any companions?”</p><p>“Only myself.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Gong Xingqing.</p><p>Gong Xingqing guessed what Qin Sang was thinking and respectfully said, “Elder Jiang gave you a token, and I assume you still have it?  There’s a private exchange later; you can rest in a private room.  If you're interested in the auction, I'll arrange the best seat for you.</p><p>The invitation to the Yi Bao Hui (Treasure Exchange) would be revealed on the senior's token.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled upon hearing this.  "Isn't the Yi Bao Hui held within the city? With your Six States Hall's influence in Central Plains, why all the secrecy?"</p><p>Gong Xingqing dared not object, saying, "Senior, you may not know, but before the Zhongyuan Dharma Assembly and the Ullambana Festival, our Hall always holds a similar Treasure Exchange, primarily inviting trusted fellow cultivators, providing a chance for mutual exchange.  This time should have been the same; we were prepared to ensure the seniors' identities wouldn't be leaked, allowing for secure transactions. However, an unforeseen incident occurred."</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed slightly; he disliked unexpected changes.</p><p>"Someone approached our Hall at the last minute, commissioning us to hold a Treasure Exchange, but with specific requirements:  it would begin during an auction, outside the city, and secrecy was mandatory before commencement. As we were merely hosting, we can only guarantee safety during the Exchange; you may decide whether to participate."</p><p>Gong Xingqing explained everything clearly, outlining the risks. "Senior, rest assured, after the auction, our Hall will endeavor to organize another Treasure Exchange, ensuring you won't leave empty-handed."</p><p>"How many real treasures will be left by the second round?" Qin Sang coldly snorted.</p><p>Gong Xingqing remained bowed, unable to respond.</p><p>"What did the party that forced your Hall to alter its plans pay? I wonder who this generous patron is?" Qin Sang was curious.</p><p>Gong Xingqing shook his head. "Senior, please forgive me; my position is low, and this is all I know."</p><p>Having come this far, there was no choice but to participate.</p><p>High-level cultivators were neither few nor many in the cultivation world; they often spent decades or even centuries in seclusion, appearing rarely.  Treasures accumulated slowly.</p><p>Such high-level Treasure Exchanges only happened near Dharma Assemblies, a rare opportunity.</p><p>As for safety concerns...</p><p>If a threat truly arose, even the Six States Hall's own Exchange might not be able to contain it.</p><p>"Get me a seat up front, and take these items to the auction."</p><p>Qin Sang tossed over a spatial pouch containing some captured treasures – nothing special, but after his refinement, they would surely attract Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Gong Xingqing replied affirmatively, quickly moving ahead to send a message via transmission talisman, then leading Qin Sang into a magnificent hall opposite.</p><p>The hall held a hidden space; the interior was ten times larger than its exterior appearance, resplendent and exquisite.</p><p>"Is this the Six States Hall's headquarters?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, ascending to the top floor of the hall, entering a private room overlooking the auction hall below.</p><p>Dismissing his attendants, Qin Sang placed his token on the desk, his gaze sweeping across the hall.</p><p>The auction was about to begin. The hall was eight-tenths full, mostly Golden Core cultivators.  The sheer number of Golden Core cultivators showed the Six States Hall's influence.</p><p>Above the main hall were three more levels, with private rooms surrounded by restrictions that blocked spiritual sense – undoubtedly, many Nascent Soul cultivators like himself were waiting for the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>The clamor from the hall was blocked by the private room's restrictions.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes to rest, patiently awaiting the auction's start, activating his Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Every time he attended such auctions, he would have the Sky-Eyed Butterfly keep a close watch.</p><p>The Sky-Eye ability could see through disguises undetectable to others; unfortunately, Qin Sang had poor luck and hadn't found any bargains yet.</p><p>Suddenly, a bell rang, and a middle-aged scholar ascended the stage, followed by a group of young girls carrying bronze trays, their smiles captivating.</p><p>As the auction progressed, treasures were sold one after another, the hall's excitement rising with each bid.</p><p>"A Buddhist body-refinement technique, the 'Arhat Jade Bone Scripture'!"</p><p>When the middle-aged scholar revealed the contents of a jade slip on a bronze tray, Qin Sang opened his eyes for the first time, looking over.</p><p>Body-refinement cultivators were nearly extinct in the North.  Central Plains still had some lineages, especially among the Buddhist sects, often producing powerful body-refinement masters, rumored to be able to withstand the force of magic treasures with their bodies.</p><p>The 'Seven Master Buddha Seal' was most likely brought from Central Plains by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>This Buddhist body-refinement technique piqued Qin Sang's interest.</p><p>He was currently focused on the 'Fire Seed Golden Lotus', but before attempting the Nascent Soul breakthrough, he needed to enhance his physical body to increase his chances of success.</p><p>The 'Seven Master Buddha Seal' was also a Buddhist technique.</p><p>Moreover, cultivating a demon technique in human form had inherent drawbacks at higher levels.</p><p>Studying the 'Arhat Jade Bone Scripture' might provide useful insights.</p><p>"'Arhat Jade Bone Scripture', origin unknown, only three levels remain, cultivable to the equivalent of late Golden Core stage.  Starting bid: 10,000 spirit stones, minimum increment: 1,000.  Please place your bids..."</p><p>The middle-aged scholar only gave a brief introduction, but there was a moment of silence.</p><p>Body-refinement cultivators were rare.</p><p>Dual cultivation of body and spirit wasn't usually considered by Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Even if one wanted to use body refinement to aid in breaking through to the Yuan Ying stage, there are many less flawed cultivation methods to consider, at least those with a complete Yuan Ying section, providing a solid foundation.</p><p>This cultivation method is somewhat mediocre, and the Six States Hall naturally understands this, so they set the starting bid very low.</p><p>Qin Sang was also disappointed, but since she was already there, she ultimately acquired the method for only tens of thousands of spirit stones.</p><p>As the auction progressed halfway…</p><p>The token suddenly vibrated, then emitted a green glow.</p><p>Simultaneously, a middle-aged scholar's voice echoed from the hall.</p><p>He lifted a bronze tray, picked up a nine-section iron whip, and chuckled before speaking, “The next treasure is rather unique. I hope our esteemed demonic cultivation friends won’t mind. This is the Meteor Iron Divine Whip.  Legend says its material is a rare and peculiar type of meteor iron, effective against certain demonic cultivation techniques…”</p><p>Qin Sang had just grabbed the token, sensing the guidance within, and was about to leave when she suddenly paused, abruptly turning around to stare intently at the iron whip in the middle-aged scholar's hand.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>A vaguely familiar aura caused Qin Sang's expression to change slightly.</p><p>The treasure emitted an aura remarkably similar to the Demon Binding Rope!</p><p>Back at Purple Micro Palace, Qing Jun and Bai had used the Demon Binding Rope to subdue the Jade Bone Demon, throwing it into a spatial vortex to be annihilated. Qing Jun then took the rope.</p><p>Now, she sensed a similar aura emanating from the Meteor Iron Whip.</p><p>Using her Heaven's Eye Butterfly to activate her Heaven's Eye ability, the Meteor Iron Whip was revealed in exquisite detail.</p><p>“The third, fourth… seventh, eighth, ninth sections…”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze quickly swept across the whip, then suddenly shot a beam of light, triggering the chamber's restrictions.</p><p>Five sections of the whip clearly bore the exact same patterns as the Demon Binding Rope, resembling some kind of special runes!</p><p>Qin Sang recalled an iron chain she had discovered in the Seven Killing Hall's treasure pavilion.</p><p>The Meteor Iron Whip, like the chain, was forged from fragments of the destroyed Demon Binding Rope.  Therefore, it was effective against certain demonic cultivation techniques, but without corresponding spirit formations, its power couldn't compare to the true Demon Binding Rope.</p><p>These demonic cultivation techniques likely referred to the ancient demons' legacies integrated into modern demonic cultivation.</p><p>After all, the Demon Binding Rope was specifically created to counter ancient demons.</p><p>There's a Demon Binding Rope in the Central Plains!</p><p>The existence of a Demon Binding Rope implies the existence of ancient demons, and ancient demons could mean the existence of an Ascension Platform!</p><p>Bidding had already begun below.</p><p>While its use was rather niche, its ability to counter demonic cultivators made it attractive to many, sparking a wave of bidding from the start.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>A knock came on the door. Gong Xingqing, having received permission, hurriedly entered. Seeing Qin Sang still hadn't gone to the treasure exchange, he looked puzzled.  “Senior…”</p><p>“I want this item, regardless of the price. If I don't return to collect it, send it to Daoist Jiang's residence.”</p><p>Qin Sang pointed towards the hall and tossed a pouch of spirit stones to Gong Xingqing.</p><p>Gong Xingqing glanced down, a troubled expression on his face.  As a Six States Hall attendant, interfering in the auction was against the rules.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was willing to pay, so Gong Xingqing sighed inwardly and said, “Junior obeys.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, then made an even more audacious request, “Furthermore, find out the origins of this item: who forged it, and where the meteor iron was initially discovered.”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Gong Xingqing truly dared not agree, his face full of difficulty.  “Senior, please forgive me. We only assess the value of treasures; we never investigate their origins or the identity of the seller. This treasure was shipped from another branch several years ago; we definitely won't find the seller.  And doing so is against the rules…”</p><p>“Can't find it? Then go find it! Do you think I'm short of your spirit stones?”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed her eyes, suddenly releasing her aura, and coldly asked, “What rules?”</p><p>The aura of a late Yuan Ying cultivator suddenly appeared, like a heavy hammer striking Gong Xingqing's mind, causing his face to turn pale. He retreated towards the door, his face filled with terror.</p><p>“Tell Daoist Jiang, I await good news.”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew her aura and walked out, leaving a casual remark as she passed Gong Xingqing.</p><p>Her sudden display of cultivation was a result of an instant cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>Searching for clues to the Demon Binding Rope was like searching for a needle in a haystack; she could only rely on the Six States Hall's power.</p><p>Even if she found the origins of the Demon Binding Rope and discovered the ancient demons, she would need help to subdue them. Qin Sang still vividly remembered the Jade Bone Demon's power.</p><p>If she found the Ascension Platform, as long as there was a place for her, she wouldn't mind others hitching a ride. The Six States Hall had a strong background and was qualified to cooperate with her.</p><p>On the other hand, it was also a warning to the Six States Hall—they'd better not have any designs on her during this treasure exchange.</p>
