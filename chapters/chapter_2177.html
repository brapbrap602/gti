<h1>Chapter 2167:  Raising Children (or, Bearing and Raising Children)</h1><p>Qin Sang summoned the lightning crystal into his hand. It was about the size of his thumb, clear and translucent within. Before he could examine it closely, the crystal suddenly melted in his hand, merging into the mark on his palm.</p><p>The mark became more complex, gaining a bit more brilliance, its spiritual light even purer.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at it for a while, unable to discern anything. Seeing that the mark was no longer changing, he frowned, and flashed to the palace gate.</p><p>The vermillion paint on the palace gate was as bright as new.  The gate was unlocked, but sealed by ancient prohibitions.</p><p>Although the Lightning General had been slain by Qin Sang, the prohibitions on the gate hadn't dissipated.</p><p>He raised his right hand, aiming the mark on his palm at the gate. As soon as his hand touched the gate, a change occurred.</p><p>A stream of light slid across the surface of the gate, and the ancient prohibitions melted away like ice and snow, finally dissipating completely.</p><p>Qin Sang gently pushed, slowly opening one gate leaf, revealing a crack.</p><p>Through the crack, Qin Sang saw the ground behind the gate, the same as the outside – still a vast, empty space.</p><p>Three large halls stood there, appearing ancient and grand under the lightning, namely the main hall directly facing the gate and two side halls. There were no other doors; it seemed that only by entering the main hall could he proceed to the next level of the palace.</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the gate and observed for a moment, stepping over the threshold with one foot.  His expression suddenly changed, and he raised his right hand.</p><p>The instant he crossed the threshold, the mark on his right hand seemed to be sealed, preventing him from using the mark to leave.</p><p>When Qin Sang stepped back out, the mark returned to normal.  It seemed that once inside the palace, he could only rely on his own strength; in case of danger, he could not rely on the mark to escape.</p><p>Furthermore, after Qin Sang entered the palace, the power of the lightning in the clouds changed.</p><p>Standing at the palace gate, looking up, he sensed that three forces of lightning were stirring, ready to strike at any moment. The situation was similar to when the Lightning General appeared, but this time, instead of one, three generals might emerge!</p><p>Three Lightning Generals, each comparable to a late-stage Refining Void cultivator, even if they were inanimate, Qin Sang dared not be careless.</p><p>Moreover, he discovered a hidden formation on the square in front of the ancient halls; the spiritual power of the formation was subtly connected to the lightning in the heavens. Once he stepped onto the square, triggering the formation and angering the three Lightning Generals, no one could guarantee their safety.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected the difficulty to increase so suddenly. He hesitated, wavering.</p><p>He could slowly deal with three Lightning Generals, hoping to defeat them one by one. His greatest fear was that the three Lightning Generals, empowered by the formation, would possess the ability to combine their attacks – that would be far more than a simple addition of strengths.</p><p>If the formation were a trapping array, the difficulty of breaking it would be extremely high under the harassment of the three Lightning Generals.</p><p>Even with Min Zhuo here, Qin Sang would have hesitated, and now he felt even more uncertain.</p><p>Unable to leave using the mark, once trapped here, escape wouldn't be quick.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't blinded by the opportunity. He gradually began to reconsider, feeling a growing desire to retreat.  Reuniting with Liuli and restoring Mount Taiyu was more important than this unknown opportunity. Moreover, only he knew how to enter this place, so there was no need to worry about anyone getting there first; he could deal with it later after accomplishing more important tasks.</p><p>The first hurdle after entering the palace was so difficult; to enter that lightning hall, he would likely need to invite some help.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering this, his nostrils twitched, and a surprised expression flashed in his eyes.  "How could there be poison here?"</p><p>He sensed poison; at some point, a trace of toxic air had wafted over.</p><p>And this poison was no ordinary toxin.  Qin Sang tried to ingest a bit; he felt his true essence subtly stirring within his body.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately activated his true essence, isolating the inside from the outside, turning sharply, his gaze sweeping across his surroundings before turning towards the heavens, even more surprised.</p><p>He discovered that the poison was floating down from the clouds, originating from outside this space.</p><p>Where was this place? What was beyond the thunderclouds?</p><p>Qin Sang had been curious about this, but hadn't had time to investigate thoroughly. Now, sensing the poison, he could confirm that this place wasn't isolated; it was connected to somewhere else.</p><p>The poison was so potent; it was clear that the outside wasn't safe. Although Qin Sang had lost his poison pearl, he had practiced the *Poison God Scripture*, and had ways to deal with it.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang withdrew his foot, stepped back out, and flapped his lightning wings, slowly flying towards the high altitude.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Lightning was close at hand.  Qin Sang weaved between the bolts, his figure disappearing into the dark clouds, rising continuously. He didn't encounter much resistance, feeling as if he'd passed through an invisible barrier, finally breaking through the sea of clouds.</p><p>In an instant, the thunder ceased, leaving behind a profound silence.  Before him lay a vast, boundless expanse of darkness, utterly devoid of anything.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back, unable to see any clouds or lightning with his naked eyes; there was no visible disturbance.  However, he could sense it through the mark on his palm.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly's perception differed slightly from Qin Sang's.  The void wasn't completely black; a faint, almost imperceptible, pinkish aura was present.  So subtle was it, only the butterfly could see it; Qin Sang couldn't detect it with any other spiritual vision techniques.</p><p>Yet, invisibility didn't mean undetectability.  This faint aura was the toxin Qin Sang sensed!</p><p>Focusing his senses, Qin Sang discovered the pink toxin was drifting from somewhere else. After a moment's thought, he flew towards its source.</p><p>He flew for some time, still unable to locate the source. The toxin grew denser, though still very faint.  Qin Sang could isolate it with his true energy, without needing any secret techniques from the *Poison God Canon*.</p><p>The emptiness made orientation extremely difficult.  Qin Sang constantly monitored the mark on his palm; its intensity was indeed weakening, but the change was minuscule, causing no immediate concern.</p><p>To his surprise, this place was far vaster than he anticipated.  Even after flying for a considerable time, he hadn't reached any boundary, the scenery remaining monotonous.</p><p>As Qin Sang frowned, he suddenly sensed an unusual fluctuation emanating from the distance.</p><p>"This fluctuation... it seems like some kind of restriction has broken!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed; he turned and flew towards the fluctuation.  Simultaneously, he instructed the Tianmu Butterfly to use its divine vision, peering into the darkness.  A faint yellow glow became visible.</p><p>Within the glow floated a staff, seven feet long, with a lifelike dragon's head carved at its top.</p><p>Surprisingly, a person was perched on the staff.  This individual was remarkably small, no bigger than a thumb, appearing somewhat disheveled as he clung to the dragon-headed staff, gazing ahead with an angry expression.</p><p>Beside the yellow light, a幽蓝光芒 (a deep blue radiance) rippled like water, creating waves mixed with fragments of a broken restriction.  The fluctuation Qin Sang sensed originated from here.</p><p>Seeing this tiny figure, Qin Sang immediately recognized him as a skilled warrior from the Jiaojiao tribe.</p><p>However, this person was unlike Ji Hong. Ji Hong possessed a natural grace and cleanliness; his every move was endearing.  This man, however, had coarse features, a full beard, and wore a simple, short outfit; a typical Jiaojiao strongman.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a tiny wooden pendant, about the size of a grain of rice, hanging from his waist. He had seen a similar one on Ji Hong.</p><p>"Who's spying on me?!"</p><p>A sudden roar erupted.  The tiny man sat up, glaring fiercely.</p><p>Seeing he'd been discovered, Qin Sang didn't hide.  He flew forward, bowing slightly.  "I am Qin Sang.  May I ask, esteemed friend, are you from the Ji clan of the Jiaojiao tribe?"</p><p>The small man eyed Qin Sang skeptically, his voice a low rumble.  "I don't know you.  Where have you seen me before?"</p><p>Qin Sang replied with a smile. "I haven't met you before, but I've become quite close with another member of the Jiaojiao tribe.  He's currently a guest at my abode, helping me cultivate spiritual trees. His name is Ji Hong.  Do you happen to know him?"</p><p>"Ji Hong, that brat!"</p><p>The small man clearly knew Ji Hong, and their relationship seemed very close.</p><p>"I'm Ji Xia, his uncle!"</p><p>"So you're Daoist Ji Xia!" Qin Sang's face lit up as he bowed repeatedly. "My apologies! My apologies!"</p><p>Ji Xia enjoyed the deference, a pleased expression on his face.  He then remembered something and spoke seriously.  "Qin Zhenren, has that boy married and produced any children?"</p><p>"Um..."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, vaguely replying, "I haven't seen Daoist Ji Hong's spouse or children. Perhaps he left his family at home."</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>Ji Xia suddenly exploded in rage. "I’ve toiled tirelessly to reach the Void Realm Second Stage, all to avoid getting married and having children!"</p><p>"This brat dared to run away from his wedding! If he won't have children, does that mean I have to?"</p><p>Ji Xia's assumption that Ji Hong had eloped puzzled Qin Sang.  "Is this what your cultivation is all about?" she thought to herself.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Jiaojiao tribe's customs.  Each clan was required to produce a certain number of offspring; failure to do so resulted in punishment for the entire clan.</p><p>While the Jiaojiao tribe included ordinary people who didn't object to marriage and childbearing,  their small population posed a challenge. Maintaining their superior status required a sufficient number of strong cultivators, which was difficult to achieve solely through the children of ordinary people.</p><p>Fairness is a rare thing in the world.  Cultivators nurture their offspring, administering elixirs, employing secret techniques, and refining their children's innate talent even before birth, resulting in extraordinary abilities from the moment of their arrival.</p><p>With their cultivation levels, having children is remarkably easy; they could even extend gestation for several years, perfecting their offspring's potential.</p><p>However, at their level, few are willing to have children. Some find true love, others know their time is short, and others have reasons tied to their cultivation techniques.  These are just a few of the reasons they might choose to leave behind heirs.</p><p>Each child represents more karmic ties and burdens. In times of crisis, children can become weaknesses, easily exploited by enemies.  In the demonic path, there's no shortage of evil techniques used against one's own blood relatives.</p><p>Refining a fetus's talent is essentially defying fate – a difficult task. The higher the ambition, the greater the difficulty.  It consumes vast resources and can harm the parents' essence.</p><p>Talent is not everything; future opportunities are also crucial, but naturally, the higher the talent, the better. They obviously want their children to have the best possible innate abilities; otherwise, it's hardly worth the effort.</p><p>Jiaojiao people are burdened with this responsibility from birth.  Ji Xia, with his cultivation almost unmatched outside the ancestral shrine, found himself still bound by such constraints.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned to invite Ji Xia to Qingyang City, hoping to bring the Jiaojiao tribe into the merchant guild, but now decided to postpone it. She didn't want to risk getting Ji Hong captured as well.</p><p>Changing the subject, Qin Sang asked, "I wonder how you came to be here, friend. Do you know where we are?"</p><p>She looked at the blue light behind Ji Hong; it seemed to connect to another place.</p><p>Ji Xia countered, "Did you also fall in unexpectedly?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "I’ve been flying around here for a while, sensing toxins and searching for their source when I encountered you."</p><p>Ji Xia grunted, then said resentfully, "That damn radiant light! I was in an ancestral tomb, about to succeed, when this light appeared out of nowhere, shattering the tomb, and I fell through the crack."</p><p>Radiant light again!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. It clearly wasn't isolated.</p><p>Dangerous nests, hidden realms, ancestral tombs—anywhere could be affected.  Radiant light was likely erupting across the sacred grounds.</p><p>"Forgive my boldness, but where is this tomb located? I’ve encountered this radiant light twice recently..."</p><p>Qin Sang briefly recounted her previous encounters.</p><p>"What?  The Hundred-legged Mountain range also had radiant light?"</p><p>Ji Xia didn't hide anything. His location was almost on the opposite side of the sacred grounds.</p><p>The effects were widespread; even hidden realms and ancestral tombs had been destroyed.  This was unprecedented in the history of the sacred grounds trials.</p><p>Qin Sang worried about the impact on their plans.</p><p>Even more astonishing was their meeting so far apart. What was this place?</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>Ji Xia cried out, "The fissure is closing! The tomb is shattered, and the treasures are exposed!"</p><p>Frantically, he used his dragon-headed staff to leap into the blue light.</p><p>Only then did Ji Xia seem to notice Qin Sang, warning, "If you can’t find a way out, you can use this. But wait until I've secured the treasures. Don't try to take anything!"</p><p>It was a verbal warning only, without any precautions.  Qin Sang wasn't sure if Ji Xia truly trusted him, but he wouldn't steal anything.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the blue light contract, unsure if the fissure would vanish completely. He couldn't follow Ji Xia; getting to the other side of the sacred grounds and returning would take too long.</p><p>The radiant light intensified, emphasizing the urgency.  He needed to rejoin Liuli and the others.</p><p>"I know of another exit, so I won’t be going..."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, making a verbal agreement with Ji Xia to cooperate in the future if the opportunity arose.</p><p>Ji Xia readily agreed. Before leaving, he gave Qin Sang a token that would resonate if they came within a certain distance.</p>
