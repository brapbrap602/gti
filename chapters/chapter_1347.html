<h1>Chapter 1339: The Blood Altar</h1><p>Chapter 1339: The Blood Altar</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the inner hall and saw the demonic chasm through which they had entered.  The earth had been torn apart, and the chasm was no exception. A huge gaping hole had ripped open its mouth, countless boulders tumbling into the abyss.  The chasm seemed bottomless, swallowing the stones without showing any sign of filling. However, inside, it was far from calm; the space was extremely unstable.  Qin Sang suspected that the ripples caused by the inner hall's anomaly in Ziwei Palace were spreading through the chasm to the Zuishen Palace.  If this continued, not only would the chasm be destroyed, but Zuishen Palace might also suffer the same fate as the outer hall. The anomaly's influence was too wide-reaching.</p><p>Fortunately, Ziwei Palace had more than one exit. Even if the chasm was destroyed, they could still escape through the outer hall and avoid being trapped.  Landing on the ground, Qin Sang felt the unique, icy chill of the ghost mist. It was thin here, but thickened further in.  However, more and more ghost mist continued to emanate outwards.  It was unimaginable how much ghost mist the ancient tomb had accumulated, and its post-explosion influence was astonishing.</p><p>The tomb held countless ghosts and spirits.  For some reason, these beings rarely left the tomb's boundaries. Even powerful Corpse Kings and Ghost Kings only attacked if living beings intruded. Other Corpse Kings and Ghost Kings lacked the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, appearing and disappearing without a trace. Nobody knew how many had bred over the countless years.  Now, the ghosts and spirits surged out of the tomb along with the mist.  Ghostly howls echoed, accompanied by chilling winds and a terrifying horde of specters, enough to make one's hair stand on end.  The outer hall had become a ghost realm, utterly chaotic.</p><p>This should have been where they sent their signal; that’s where the talismanic sword pointed before stopping. He was late; there was no one else around.  Qin Sang didn't know what had happened; the talismanic sword had lost its connection, making it impossible to determine his senior sisters' location.  Unable to act rashly, he stared into the depths of the ghost mist.  The mist was dense. Besides the ancient tomb, the outer hall contained several forbidden areas, all now shrouded in mist.</p><p>The only exception was a pool of bloodlight deep within the mist, faintly visible even from where Qin Sang stood.  Due to the distance and the obscuring mist, the bloodlight’s outline was small.</p><p>"That must be the Blood Altar."</p><p>Qin Sang remembered it; after leaving the tomb, the Blood Altar was the next thing he'd see. It was massive, shaped like a huge pyramid, surrounded by crimson blood煞 energy and intricate, terrifying ancient prohibitions. It was clearly nothing good.  Even Yuan Ying cultivators, who might dare to traverse the Heavenly Mountain in the inner hall, wouldn't dare provoke the Blood Altar.  Therefore, it had stood in the outer hall for years, rarely attracting attention.  The blood-red killing intent around the Blood Altar was thick, but in Qin Sang’s memory, it hadn't been this bright, not even the ghost mist could hide it.</p><p>"Could they all be there?"</p><p>Qin Sang wondered, unable to see anything in the mist except for the mist itself.  Qingjun, Jingyu, and Bai had disappeared, most likely trapped in the mist. No matter what, he couldn't stand idly by; he had to investigate.  The three of them were strong, with life-saving techniques.  So many Yuan Ying cultivators working together shouldn't have all been killed by Elder Ye.  Furthermore, the ghost mist was Bai's domain. In the mist, hardly anyone could defeat Bai.  Bai was at home in the mist; even if he couldn't defeat Elder Ye, he could definitely escape.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the situation was most likely a stalemate. Elder Ye's motives were intriguing; first releasing a demon from Zuishen Palace, then going to the Blood Altar. Could there be another demon sealed within Ziwei Palace?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled obtaining the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire in Ziwei Palace.  It was entirely possible!  One demon was already enough for Qin Sang to feel threatened; if it became two, he couldn't imagine what would become of the Northern Star Realm's cultivation world. He wouldn't hesitate to retreat to a safe haven.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang made a new discovery.  Several places in the ghost mist flickered with faint light, disappearing quickly. Without a doubt, it was cultivators using magical treasures to fight.</p><p>"No wonder there's been little commotion. They’d prepared a spirit array and were using it to confront Elder Ye.  It seems my senior sisters were separated before they could set up the array, now fighting individually. Elder Ye only has two people… I don't know how he managed that..."</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze back and forth, determining the locations of these battlefields.</p><p>The magical artifact's glow was weak and flickering, making it impossible to identify its user. Qin Sang summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly, fully activating its divine ability, but still couldn't locate the Five Directions Pagoda.</p><p>"Unable to pinpoint Qing Jun's location, I can only choose the nearest one, find out what's happening, and then decide. Once I go in, Bai should contact me…"</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang hesitated no longer, urging the ebony sword forward into the ghostly fog.</p><p>Eighteen demonic banners were hidden in her sleeve.  Using the banners consumed too much energy; Qin Sang couldn't sustain it for long, so she had to use them judiciously.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang transformed into a sword light, speeding through the fog.  Any foolish ghost or spirit that dared to cross her path was instantly sliced into pieces.</p><p>She soon arrived near the first forbidden zone. The ground was riddled with large and small holes, interconnected in a complex network.  In the past, cultivators passing through this area would disturb the serpentine creatures within if they didn't carefully conceal their presence, leading to a swarm attack.</p><p>Now, those creatures were gone, replaced by countless ghosts and spirits.</p><p>Qin Sang's luck held; she didn't encounter any ghost kings. Passing through several forbidden zones, she saw the bloody altar's glow become increasingly brighter.</p><p>Just when she was close to her target, Qin Sang suddenly stopped and sheathed her sword.  Her brow furrowed as she examined the fog ahead. There were no strange fluctuations, but her Sky Eye vision revealed an unusual flow in the fog.</p><p>After observing for a while, she couldn't discern anything conclusive. Time was pressing; she couldn't afford to ponder any longer. She released her Nascent Soul puppet to scout ahead.  Confirming there was no immediate danger, she dashed forward.</p><p>Upon entering, Qin Sang found her vision severely restricted, her spiritual sense suppressed.  Without the Sky Eye ability, others would only be able to see a few yards around them – no wonder they hadn't been able to rendezvous.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang found her target.</p><p>Several Nascent Soul cultivators were being attacked by something, and at their forefront was Zhen Daoist!</p><p>Simultaneously, at the blood-red altar…</p><p>Two figures hovered on either side of the altar: Ye Lao Mo and Yu Gu.</p><p>"Another foolhardy one dares to intrude! Heh, decent swordsmanship, and a Nascent Soul puppet too…"</p><p>Ghostly flames flickered in Yu Gu's eyes as he spoke indifferently, a hint of disdain in his tone. (To be continued)</p>
