<h1>Chapter 452: Wind and Blade</h1><p>A fierce wind swept across the battlefield. Not just wind blades, but the gale itself seemed to solidify, obscuring the night sky and stars. Its oppressive force made it difficult to breathe.  The raging hurricane threatened to tear the very space apart.</p><p>The only sound was the incessant howling of the wind.</p><p>The chaotic spiritual energy stirred everyone's heart. Faced with such a terrifying scene, the cultivators on the Xiaohan Domain side were incredibly tense, their expressions grim.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look at the Heavenly Firmament Alliance, but stared intently at the air blades he controlled.</p><p>The hurricane drew closer.</p><p>Finally, the air blades moved.</p><p>Moving in unison, the blade formation met the hurricane head-on, erupting in a dazzling light.</p><p>To the naked eye, all the air blades seemed to merge into one, transforming into a slender dragon. With a sharp shriek, it charged directly into the hurricane.</p><p>‘Boom…’</p><p>The earth trembled.</p><p>The terrifying collision made every cultivator's heart skip a beat.</p><p>Even the distant battleground of Core Formation cultivators was startled.  The fighting paused briefly, and many gazes focused on the scene.</p><p>The gale swallowed the air blades.</p><p>The blade's edge shattered the wind blades.</p><p>At the center, spiritual energy swirled chaotically, forming a terrifying vortex.  Within the vortex, wind and blade intertwined, tearing apart the surrounding spiritual energy, making it impossible to see clearly.</p><p>The shockwave from the impact rippled outwards.  A massive hole was blasted into the water's surface, revealing the mud and weeds on the lakebed.</p><p>Huge waves surged, the currents turbulent, yet unable to fill the gaping hole.</p><p>The shockwave reached the two battle formations. The surging tide of spiritual energy, mixed with fragments of air blades and wind, still possessed frightening destructive power.</p><p>Commotion rippled through the Xiaohan Domain ranks. Without needing orders, everyone raised their magical tools to defend against the aftershocks.</p><p>Mu Yifeng led others, shielding Qin Sang, and brandished his Nine Fire Divine Blade.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly groaned, a sweet taste rising in his throat.  His face paled slightly, and his body swayed as if he might lose his footing.</p><p>Mu Yifeng noticed Qin Sang's distress and turned to him amidst the chaos.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, indicating he was alright.</p><p>The air blades he controlled had been destroyed, causing backlash. However, this wasn't his first time as a formation's focal point. Experienced and prepared, he severed the connection with the air blades at the critical moment, suffering only minor injuries that wouldn't affect his combat ability.</p><p>Quickly swallowing a healing pill, Qin Sang glanced at the approaching aftershocks.  He immediately issued commands, and soon another air blade formed, which he directed into the vortex.</p><p>This clash lasted for almost the time it takes an incense stick to burn.</p><p>Both sides spared no effort. The vortex shifted back and forth, but remained roughly in the center between the two formations.</p><p>Neither side seemed able to gain a decisive advantage.</p><p>However, as time went on, the destructive power of the vortex weakened. The most noticeable change was that the hole in the water's surface was almost filled.</p><p>During this process, the distance between the two sides steadily decreased.</p><p>Once again, the hurricane tore apart the air blade. This time, Qin Sang didn't immediately form another.  He watched his approaching opponents, took a breath, and said in a deep voice, "Prepare for close combat!"</p><p>As he expected, the battle was progressing as he was familiar with.  Close-quarters combat was inevitable.</p><p>Both sides had deployed their forces.  In the initial stages of these confrontations, there were sometimes unexpected turns.</p><p>Later, as opponents became familiar with each other, such tactics were less effective, even within the grand formations.</p><p>Several large-scale battles had followed a similar pattern.</p><p>‘Swish…’</p><p>Countless streaks of light crisscrossed as the formations abruptly shifted.</p><p>Having fulfilled their role as the formation's focal point, the cultivators surrounding Qin Sang returned to their squads. The light of countless magical tools illuminated the battle formation, dense as the stars.</p><p>The vortex hadn't completely dissipated, but it couldn't halt the advance of the two sides.</p><p>War cries echoed through the sky as the two forces finally clashed.</p><p>However, hidden beneath this spectacular scene was a deadly intent.</p><p>At such close range, differences between the Heavenly Firmament Alliance and Xiaohan Domain became apparent. While both were cultivators, they weren't identical.</p><p>These differences were not only reflected in their magical tools but also in the cultivators themselves.</p><p>Despite being honed by three years of war, the Xiaohan Domain's formation still appeared somewhat looser compared to the Heavenly Firmament Alliance.  Individual squads within the formation were well-coordinated, but the overall formation showed disparities.</p><p>However, the overall strength of the Xiaohan Domain cultivators wasn't inferior to the Heavenly Firmament Alliance. Although the Alliance had greater numbers and a larger formation, Xiaohan Domain surpassed them in the number of False Core and late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Moreover, the Xiaohan Domain possessed a wider variety of magical tools. The Alliance's tools were mostly limited to armor, spears, halberds, swords, and similar types, appearing very uniform.</p><p>Having fought them for so long, Qin Sang didn't underestimate them based on their seemingly limited arsenal.</p><p>For cultivators, magical tools were only part of their strength, and the Alliance's tools were well-suited for coordinated attacks, allowing them to exert power beyond their individual quality.</p><p>“Senior Brother Mu, you lead the vanguard, I'll support from the center," Qin Sang transmitted his instructions.</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Mu Yifeng gripped his Nine Fire Divine Blade, a fire dragon coiling around him, and charged forward.</p><p>Their squad formed around Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng, ready for battle.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed a finger, and the Frost Metal Sword, which had been circling him, shot out alongside Mu Yifeng.  With his now free hand, he retrieved the Yin-Yang Compass…</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>War cries shook the heavens.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The two battle formations finally collided.</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang couldn't see anything beyond his immediate opponents.</p><p>This group of enemies pierced the opposing formations like a sharp sword, carving a path directly towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Similar scenes played out simultaneously across the battlefield.</p><p>However, the Xiaohan Domain's formation, while scattered, held its ground.</p><p>Qin Sang had no time to concern himself with other areas. He quickly scanned his surroundings, silently assessed the opposing force, and issued a command.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Frost Metal Sword transformed into a streak of cold light, advancing alongside the Nine Fire Divine Blade. Simultaneously, the squads around Qin Sang, anticipating his move, sprang into action.</p><p>Magical tools flew out in a coordinated assault.</p><p>The enemy fought back fiercely, sword Qi and blade light flashing.</p><p>After the initial clash, the enemy's advance stalled momentarily.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't press the attack.</p><p>"Yield!"</p><p>As the saying goes, initial momentum is strong, but wanes with each subsequent push.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't foolish enough to engage in a direct confrontation.  Weakening the enemy's initial assault was enough for now.</p>
