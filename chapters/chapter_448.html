<h1>Chapter 441: Serpent Witch</h1><p>As he approached the large disc, Qin Sang abruptly shuddered.</p><p>A terrifying chill emanated from ahead, second only to the Blackfrost Wind!</p><p>The closer he got, the more Qin Sang felt his spiritual power stagnate, his whole body on the verge of freezing.</p><p>Finally, he saw Teng Zhaogang's figure.</p><p>Teng Zhaogang was covered in a thick layer of frost, looking like a snowman at first glance. The disc rested on his knees, still emitting a constant stream of cold air.</p><p>Opposite Teng Zhaogang sat another senior disciple from the Grand Elixir Sect, looking equally miserable.</p><p>They were activating the disc, supporting the large disc above, assisting the Di of the Golden Core stage in setting up the formation.</p><p>However, even at this distance, Qin Sang still couldn't see the large disc with his naked eye.</p><p>Above Teng Zhaogang's head, the cold air gathered into a cloud, resembling a giant snowdrift hanging in midair.  The extreme chill radiated from there.</p><p>"Help me dispel the cold..."</p><p>Teng Zhaogang's teeth chattered, his voice weak, but he persisted in activating the disc, not daring to relax.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhan Yi landed on either side of Teng Zhaogang.</p><p>After a moment of thought, Qin Sang took a teapot-shaped artifact from his Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>This artifact was personally refined by Qin Sang. It was a fusion of the not entirely destroyed Myriad Crows Gourd and another artifact. Qin Sang called it the Myriad Flames Gourd.</p><p>The smoke from the Myriad Crows Gourd was inherently a fire element, and the phantom crows were a type of fire crow, containing rich fire elemental power.  The other artifact fused with it also had similar properties.</p><p>At the time, Qin Sang had attempted the fusion out of a desire to salvage the excellent Myriad Crows Gourd and to hone his refining skills. He hadn't expected to succeed on his first try.</p><p>The resulting Myriad Flames Gourd, though not improved in quality, possessed even more abundant fire elemental power.  Instead of smoke, it spewed a type of spiritual fire.</p><p>Its function also changed, leaning towards offense rather than defense.</p><p>Holding the Myriad Flames Gourd, Qin Sang released rolling flames, enveloping the three of them and dispelling the cold.</p><p>Zhan Yi took out a fire-element flying sword and activated it, slashing out streaks of flame-like sword energy, but the effect was less than satisfactory.</p><p>...</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang entered the formation, several streaks of light flew in from the horizon. Di of the Golden Core Stage let out a long sigh of relief, saying, "It's good that you fellow Daoists have returned. Quickly help me stabilize the artifacts and set up the formation together!"</p><p>An unknown amount of time passed. Just as Qin Sang was nearing exhaustion, Teng Zhaogang was finally able to withdraw.</p><p>Returning below, they discovered that the Chaotic Isles waters had undergone a startling transformation.</p><p>In all directions, and above, a boundless sea of fog now reigned.</p><p>The formation's range was even larger than Qin Sang had imagined.  He flew close to the fog layer and peered out, barely able to see the boundary of the space.  The white fog remained dense and unyielding, covering the sky above the Chaotic Isles, enclosing this vast area.</p><p>Below the fog, for a height of less than three zhang, the fog was thin and didn't obstruct vision.</p><p>Although the fog was thin here, the weather within the Chaotic Isles kept changing. Sometimes heavy snow poured down, sometimes goose feathers drifted gently, sometimes a fine drizzle fell, and sometimes icy winds swept through...</p><p>No wonder it was called the Truewater Mirage Formation; it was truly ever-changing.</p><p>The entire Chaotic Isles seemed to have transformed into a shelter made of fog. The low-hanging fog created a sense of oppression.</p><p>However, being within it, they felt much safer than before.</p><p>After all, with the protection of the grand formation, they wouldn't be constantly embroiled in chaotic battles.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and found Di of the Golden Core Stage sitting in meditation at the center of the Chaotic Isles, on the largest island.  Around him sat several equally powerful cultivators, all Golden Core experts.</p><p>The formation seemed incomplete, as they were still busy at work.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he could sense a trace of weakness in their auras, demonstrating the difficulty of setting up the Truewater Mirage Formation.</p><p>Vice-Island Master Xiao wasn't among them.  Could it be that the battle was still raging elsewhere?</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was pondering this, Di of the Golden Core Stage seemed to sense something. He suddenly opened his eyes, looked south, and shouted, "Open!"</p><p>Immediately, a faint white light shone within the dense fog, shooting out beyond it. As the fog churned, a narrow passage appeared.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh...*</p><p>Several streaks of light flew in through the passage.</p><p>Along with them came Vice-Island Master Xiao's urgent voice: "Quickly seal the formation!"</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw that over a dozen figures had appeared on the island.  Most of them had tattered robes and hadn't had time to retract their artifacts.  Some had alarming wounds, all looking extremely disheveled.</p><p>Vice-Island Master Xiao and Che Yutao were among them.</p><p>However, at the very center was an old woman holding a serpent staff.</p><p>Seeing how respectfully Di of the Golden Core Stage and the others treated the old woman, Qin Sang was secretly surprised.  So, this old woman was the Island Master of Stargazing Island.</p><p>Beside the old woman stood a strange figure, close by her side.  His upper body was that of a handsome young man, but his lower body was that of a serpent.  From his mouth flickered not a tongue, but a crimson snake's forked tongue.</p><p>His pupils were vertical slits, like a snake's, and his gaze held a chilling coldness.</p><p>Qin Sang had asked Zhan Yi about this figure. He was called Serpent Witch and was the Vice Sect Master of the Spirit Taming Sect.</p><p>This half-human, half-snake creature was nominally the old woman's spirit beast, but in reality, he was a demon beast from the Demonic Beast Hill.  Enlightened by the Emperor's Flow Nectar, he had awakened his intelligence early on and been sent to the Spirit Taming Sect to form a pact with Serpent Witch.</p><p>It was said that this strange figure held a significant position within the Demonic Beast Hill and possessed strength comparable to Serpent Witch's.</p><p>The Spirit Taming Sect's location was northwest of the Yuan Mirage Sect, the sect closest to the Demonic Beast Hill among both righteous and demonic paths in the Small Cold Realm, and it had intricate connections with the Demonic Beast Hill.</p><p>Like the Upper Primordial Pure Serenity Palace and a few other sects, the Spirit Taming Sect was an ancient sect with a long heritage. Regardless of how the situation changed, it always maintained its position within the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>Its foundation was far superior to that of ephemeral demonic sects like the Kui Yin Sect.</p><p>The Spirit Taming Sect's reliance was precisely this close relationship with the Demonic Beast Hill. Even without a Nascent Soul cultivator, other sects were reluctant to provoke them.</p><p>There were rumors that true Nascent Soul experts were extremely rare in the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>The current generation of the Spirit Taming Sect had no Sect Master, meaning no Nascent Soul cultivator within the sect. Serpent Witch was the de facto leader.</p><p>Even among the Eight Righteous Sects and the renowned demonic sects, several were similar to the Spirit Taming Sect, lacking a Nascent Soul cultivator but possessing means to deter them.</p><p>This contradicted Qin Sang's understanding from his Qi Refining stage days, but it was understandable.</p><p>He still wasn't qualified to learn about secrets of this level and could only treat them as legends. Even the rumors he heard now might not be true.</p><p>Seeing Serpent Witch and the serpent-bodied man looking around, Qin Sang felt a sudden pang of guilt and quickly averted his gaze.  He still had the relics of a Spirit Taming Sect Golden Core cultivator in his Mustard Seed Bag and couldn't afford to be exposed.</p><p>All Golden Core experts, Qin Sang couldn't discern their cultivation techniques, but from their artifacts, he could glean some clues.  Righteous cultivators, demons, and rogue cultivators from all over the Small Cold Realm had arrived.</p><p>Among them, they were protecting two individuals, Senior Fang and Senior Shentu, the first ones who had been ambushed. </p>
