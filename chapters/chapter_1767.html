<h1>Chapter 1758: Crane Cry Mountain</h1><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword vanished into Qin Sang’s palm.</p><p>The large man slid down the stone wall and collapsed, revealing his true form—a brightly-colored, ferocious tiger.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the corpse and surveyed the hidden chamber.</p><p>The furnishings within were simple. Aside from the two stone rooms containing the jade sphere and the teleportation formation, there were only two other chambers.</p><p>For a cultivation site used by two Transformation stage Great Demons, it seemed far too spartan.</p><p>This was clearly a temporary cave dwelling!</p><p>Yet such a dwelling was meticulously protected by defensive formations.</p><p>The sword strike that had cleaved the mountain wall moments ago was the result of the Skyeye Butterfly’s divine ability to discern the formation’s weakness, combined with the power of the pseudo-spirit treasure Gray Warbler Sword and the Seven Souls Slaughter Formation.</p><p>As Qin Sang’s cultivation deepened, his comprehension of the Seven Slaughter Sword Formation grew more profound. He could now wield it with greater control, no longer needing the extravagant display of power as before.</p><p>Outsiders saw only a flash of sword light, but it contained the full might of the sword formation.</p><p>Defensive formations outside, a teleportation formation within, and two demon beasts hiding here—they must have been plotting something for a long time, making their intentions highly suspect.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze swept over the tiger demon’s corpse and landed on a jade bracelet on its right wrist. He beckoned it into his hand; it was indeed a Mustard Seed spatial treasure.</p><p>After a thorough search, Qin Sang retrieved a golden seal inscribed with two characters in the demonic script of the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>“Yu Shuai.”</p><p>After deciding to travel to Jushan Prefecture, Qin Sang had been paying attention to any information regarding the Ghostfang Kingdom, after all, they could become his greatest enemy in the future.</p><p>The Ghostfang Kingdom was known as the Kingdom of Demons and Ghosts. While not exclusively populated by demons, demonic cultivators held the dominant position.</p><p>More overt than the Dao Court, the Ghostfang Kingdom’s name itself included the character for “kingdom.”  Within, they had established official ranks, much like the Dao Court, creating a clear hierarchy, truly resembling a nation.</p><p>Only Transformation stage demonic cultivators qualified for the rank of Demon Marshal (Yao Shuai). Above that were Demon Marquises (Yao Hou), and above them, Demon Kings.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t yet uncovered information about higher ranks and didn't know if all Demon Kings were Soul Formation stage cultivators, but for the Ghostfang Kingdom to contend with the Dao Court for so long without falling behind, they must have numerous top-tier experts.</p><p>This golden seal indicated that the tiger demon was a Demon Marshal of the Ghostfang Kingdom, a position of considerable power.</p><p>The character ‘Yu’ had multiple interpretations.</p><p>It could be this tiger demon's title.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that within the cultivation world, tiger demons also had the appellation of "Yu Li" (Tiger Official).</p><p>The escaped demon must also be a Demon Marshal.  Two Demon Marshals of the Ghostfang Kingdom lurking in such a remote area couldn't be simply to ambush a few Golden Core juniors.</p><p>Qin Sang looked back towards the mountain’s exterior. He had easily captured the strongest white tiger, significantly lessening the pressure on Shi Xuan and the others. The battle at the Blue Fox Divine Temple was nearing its end.</p><p>The tiger demon's jade bracelet contained several useful treasures, which Qin Sang temporarily stored away. He then bent down to examine the tiger demon’s corpse.</p><p>The tiger demon had been slain by a single sword strike before it could display its true strength. Qin Sang didn't see its Contemplation Inner Spirit but sensed a fluctuation similar to that of the snake demon.</p><p>"Senior...Qingfeng, is this..."</p><p>Shi Xuan’s hesitant voice came from outside the cave.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the other two had eliminated most of the demon gods and captured three alive, including the white tiger Qin Sang had subdued. They rushed over with their captives and were startled by the sight of the tiger demon's corpse.</p><p>Shi Xuan never imagined that the helper they had casually recruited on the road would be a true expert, nor that such a seemingly simple mission would harbor such deadly danger.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a few demon gods and interrogated them, discovering they didn’t recognize the tiger demon.</p><p>They all claimed to have recently gained sentience. A mysterious will had compelled them to establish temples and pose as demon gods, performing miracles among the ghostfolk and demanding worship.</p><p>It was certain that their awakening was connected to the two Demon Marshals.</p><p>Unknowing of the details, Qin Sang couldn't fathom their intentions, but thinking of the righteous gods appointed by the Dao Court, he felt a premonition of an unknown conspiracy.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the others also considered this. The best course of action was to report the matter to the Dao Court immediately.</p><p>However, the tiger demon was slain by Qin Sang, so they dared not speak. Even the usually boisterous Shen Huo became unusually quiet.</p><p>Qin Sang knew they couldn’t stay here long. He returned the Marshal's seal and the captured demon gods, then kicked the tiger corpse towards Shi Xuan, asking, "These should be worth a considerable amount of merit, right?"</p><p>Shi Xuan caught the seal, glanced at it, and his face paled with shock. “Bringing back this Demon Marshal's corpse and this information, regardless of whether it exposes the Ghostfang Kingdom's plot, is a great contribution. The Dao Court will surely reward Senior handsomely.  The Dao Court is never stingy with those who contribute."</p><p>He didn't dare claim any of Qin Sang’s credit and decided to persuade his companions to give their original reward to Qin Sang as well.</p><p>As they spoke, they collected their spoils and flew away from the mountain with the captives.</p><p>Qin Sang led the way, with the three following closely behind.</p><p>They didn't return by the same route, choosing to take a detour to avoid running into pursuers.</p><p>After flying for several days without encountering any enemies, Qin Sang suddenly halted his escape light and landed on a barren mountain. He turned and said, "There shouldn't be any pursuers now.  You're heading directly to Crane Cry Mountain, correct? Why not bring the spoils back first, and Fellow Daoist Shi can collect my merit as well.  I have other matters to attend to and must delay for a few days.  I will meet you at Crane Cry Mountain soon."</p><p>Crane Cry Mountain was the largest immortal city in Jushan Prefecture.  It was said its name originated from a sacred mountain in Daoist legends.</p><p>The Dao Court issued its decrees from Crane Cry Mountain and stationed true experts there. However, the city wasn't solely under the Dao Court's control.  Forces like the Yin Heaven Palace, rooted in Jushan Prefecture, were also present, creating a complex mix of factions.</p><p>With the Dao Court's resources, occupying the entire city would be effortless.  It was said this was a deliberate decision by the Dao Court to maintain a tacit understanding and balance.</p><p>As such, Crane Cry Mountain gained renown as the largest hub of activity for Daoist cultivators in Jushan Prefecture.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the others had originally planned to go to Crane Cry Mountain after completing the mission on the decree and cultivate in Jushan Prefecture for a while. Now, after this incident, they needed to return even more urgently.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang’s words, the three were momentarily stunned but didn't dare inquire further. They agreed on a method of contact, bid farewell to Qin Sang, and hurried away.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t worried they would steal his merit.  After watching them leave, he glanced around, then vanished into a nearby mountain.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from his cave dwelling, his expression now tinged with a deeper gloom.</p><p>Calculating the time, in about thirty years, it would be six hundred years since his breakthrough to Nascent Soul.</p><p>This meant the second Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation was imminent.</p><p>The Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation occurred every three hundred years and was the greatest trial for a cultivator.  It wouldn’t become easier with changes in cultivation realm.</p><p>If someone was unfortunate enough to break through to Deity Transformation just before the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, they had to be prepared to endure two tribulations in quick succession.</p><p>Qin Sang could already sense the aura of the tribulation.  Even if he left the Storm Realm, the tribulation wouldn’t be postponed.</p><p>Before this, Qin Sang hadn’t been worried about the Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, even in his current weakened state, under numerous restrictions.</p><p>The tribulation’s power increased with each occurrence and was also somewhat related to the cultivator's cultivation level, but it wouldn't be excessive; there was an upper limit.</p><p>In the cultivation world, cases like his, encountering the second Four-Nine Heavenly Tribulation only after reaching Deity Transformation, were extremely rare, at least in the Storm Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang judged that with the Skyeye Butterfly's assistance, numerous supreme treasures and secret techniques at his disposal, two top-tier sword formations, the Postnatal Wood Stele refined from the Dao Comprehension Tree, and the instant healing of the Inner Lion Seal, even without fully recovered strength, he had absolute confidence in overcoming this tribulation and thus hadn't been anxious.</p><p>Unexpectedly, while fighting the demons earlier, he had experienced a sudden, inexplicable sense of foreboding.</p><p>After a month of secluded cultivation and careful reflection, he realized it might stem from the next heavenly tribulation!</p><p>The next tribulation was likely to undergo a mutation, one that could threaten his life!</p><p>He wondered if coming to this foreign realm had caused the tribulation to change.</p><p>The various sects of the Storm Realm had no relevant records; it was a complete blank, with no prior experience to draw upon.</p><p>This feeling seemed vague and intangible, but it concerned life and death, so Qin Sang couldn't afford to be careless.</p><p>This left him with only two paths:  either quickly find a method to stabilize his Yuan Qi and recover his strength, or seek a breakthrough in body refinement and regain Deity Transformation level combat power.</p><p>After years of covert investigation, Qin Sang knew that stabilizing his Yuan Qi could only be achieved through a Dharma Position.</p><p>He had some leads on how to obtain a Dharma Position, but whether he could qualify for a Deity Transformation level Dharma Position within thirty years was still uncertain.</p><p>The higher the Dharma Position, the more difficult it would be to obtain, requiring meticulous planning and allowing no room for error.</p><p>Conversely, the path of body refinement offered more hope.</p><p>Body cultivators thrived in this realm.</p><p>With Six Heavens Primordial Qi tempering his body, the unrefined Dragon Transformation Pond spirit liquid within him, and the possibility of finding more body refinement pills, Qin Sang was confident he could cultivate the Demonic Refinement to the peak of the fourth level within thirty years.</p><p>The only problem was where to find a place for Star Essence Body Infusion.</p><p>While traversing the Middle Vast Prefecture and White Stone Prefecture, Qin Sang had paid special attention and hadn't found any such blessed lands.</p><p>“Crane Cry Mountain…”</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, gazing north.</p><p>Due to its special status, Crane Cry Mountain Immortal City was undoubtedly the place with the fastest information circulation. He decided to inquire within the city before making a decision.</p><p>……</p><p>Perhaps due to the rampant demons and devils, the weather in Jushan Prefecture was perpetually overcast.</p><p>A grayish, lingering Yin Qi seemed to permanently shroud this world.</p><p>Even Crane Cry Mountain, the so-called number one immortal city, was no exception.</p><p>As its name suggested, the immortal city was indeed built on mountains, not a single peak, but a vast, seemingly endless range of interconnected mountain peaks.</p><p>The true Crane Cry Mountain referred to the most majestic peak at the center of the range, but now the name had come to represent the entire immortal city.</p><p>The immortal city was built atop the mountain peaks.</p><p>Below lay a vast, bottomless lake.</p><p>It was as if someone had used immense divine power to carve out this section of land, lifting it tens of thousands of feet into the air, supported by thousands of mountains as pillars, upholding this immortal city.</p><p>Looking up from the lake’s surface, one would see a landmass suspended in the sky.</p><p>The immortal city had eight entrances, one in each cardinal and intercardinal direction. Each had a wide stone staircase winding down the mountainside, descending directly into the lake’s depths.</p><p>Regardless of background, even Dao Court immortals had to obediently descend and walk to enter the city.</p><p>From afar, the city's edges appeared to lack walls, and seemingly powerful restrictive formations.</p><p>However, no one was foolish enough to cause trouble here. Even the Ghostfang Kingdom's armies deliberately avoided Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Not only were there Dao Court immortals stationed here, but legend held that the Yin Heaven Palace Master's cave dwelling was located near the city, though no one knew on which mountain.</p><p>At the south gate of the immortal city.</p><p>Two cultivators in black Daoist robes, their faces hidden by bamboo hats, were walking down the mountain.</p><p>One shook his head and cursed, "Damn it! I was entangled by those damned Daoists for half an hour, and all the newly issued Dao Court decrees have been taken."</p><p>His companion asked curiously, "Brother Dao, aren't you always criticizing the Dao Court for being autocratic, incompetent, and corrupt? Why are you accepting their decrees?"</p><p>The man snorted. "I criticize the Dao Court for its inaction, its internal strictness while failing to eradicate the demonic scourge and restore order to the world, allowing the Ghostfang Kingdom to grow! Most decrees involve hunting demons and ghosts, and the Dao Court's rewards are generally generous. Why shouldn't I accept them?"</p><p>His companion laughed. "Brother Dao is truly discerning. However, the Dao Court still has so many decrees left unclaimed. Why not take one to avoid returning empty-handed…"</p><p>"Do you take me for a fool?"</p><p>……</p><p>The two continued chatting as they walked, unaware of a young man passing by them.</p><p>This person was none other than Qin Sang, who had traveled thousands of miles to reach this place.</p><p>The immortal city had no walls, and there were no gates to speak of. Stepping onto the stone stairs was equivalent to entering the city.</p><p>There were no strict inspections, only a bronze mirror suspended in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang paused briefly, glancing at the bronze mirror inconspicuously, then entered the city with a calm expression. The mirror showed no reaction.</p><p>He didn't rush to find Shi Xuan and the others, instead seeking the location of the Dao Court, which he easily discovered.</p><p>Flight was prohibited within the city, but immortal birds, spirit beasts, and palanquins were available for transportation. Qin Sang rented a palanquin and entered meditative cultivation.</p><p>He didn't know how much time had passed before the spirit beast pulling the palanquin woke him.</p><p>"Immortal, we’ve arrived at the Heavenly Hub Institute."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped down from the palanquin, paid the fare, and saw a misty landscape to his left, a cluster of pavilions and halls nestled within, as if floating in a sea of clouds, a truly otherworldly sight. This was the Heavenly Hub Institute.</p><p>To his right, opposite the Heavenly Hub Institute, stood the Northern Pole Exorcism Institute.</p><p>The Northern Pole Exorcism Institute had a more austere and solemn style, consisting mostly of black, square stone halls.</p><p>Hundred-foot-tall archways stood before each institute, inscribed with jade palace spirit script, bearing their respective names.</p><p>Although the two institutes were separate, in Jushan Prefecture, they were considered a single entity, united by their common goal—to slay demons and subdue ghosts!</p><p>At this moment, many Daoists were gathered beneath the archways.</p><p>Qin Sang extended a wisp of divine sense, probing the Heavenly Hub Institute's archway. He instantly felt himself enter a dark space, ‘seeing’ clusters of golden light suspended within.</p><p>Each golden light contained a golden talisman—the renowned decrees.</p><p>The other side was the same.</p><p>Every so often, the Dao Court issued new decrees, and these people waiting beneath the archways were waiting for the newest ones.</p><p>The remaining decrees were all extremely dangerous, with no one daring to accept them for the time being.</p><p>Some of them, Qin Sang mused, even he would find difficult.</p><p>He perused them with great interest, paying particular attention to the rewards, many of which were treasures he had never heard of.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang let out a soft gasp. He discovered one reward offered a single opportunity to request assistance from one of the Dao Court’s Lords of Appeasement, provided the request didn’t violate Daoist principles.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he found that through the Dao Court, one could request the aid of a cultivator far exceeding one's own cultivation, as long as one could offer sufficient merit!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>That night.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared in a small shop specializing in selling information, asking the white-haired old Daoist before him,</p><p>"Within our Daoist sects, which faction specializes in talismans that channel starlight?"</p><p>The old Daoist gave him a strange look. "The Dao Court's Department of Celestial Concord's deities naturally specialize in star-slaying talismans."</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
