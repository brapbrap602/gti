<h1>Chapter 1114: Wind Extremity Nails</h1><p>The High Priestess tapped her foot and soared skyward in a streak of light.</p><p>Elder Fang and the other cultivators followed closely behind.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at the mysterious valley.</p><p>The valley was silent and deserted.</p><p>The High Priestess glanced around, then flashed into the deepest part of the valley, arriving before an ancient barrier between two sheer cliffs.</p><p>The valley was dark, like a black hole.</p><p>Black light, composed of densely packed, fine threads, emanated from the cliffs. These threads were extensions of the ancient barrier, crisscrossing and sealing the valley's entrance.</p><p>The threads were thin and intangible.</p><p>The human cultivators paled, not daring to approach them.</p><p>This barrier had already claimed the lives of many cultivators.</p><p>Fortunately, the barrier wouldn't harm anyone unless they actively intruded.</p><p>"The Celestial Pagoda is clearly a relic of a human sword cultivator sect. Why would there be a Witch Tribe treasure vault here?"</p><p>Standing before the barrier, Elder Fang still had doubts.</p><p>The High Priestess stared intently into the depths of the barrier and said indifferently, "Who can say for sure whether humans and witches were enemies or allies in ancient times? Within the Seven Kill Hall, there are remnants not only of human cultivators but also of witches and demons. The fact that we can directly cultivate human techniques speaks volumes. Furthermore, while humans are helpless against these barriers, we witches may not be."</p><p>With that, the High Priestess flipped her palm and revealed two black, nail-shaped treasures.</p><p>She channeled her True Essence into them.</p><p>The nails shimmered with a faint blue light from the inside out, revealing countless blue runes.</p><p>Simultaneously, small whirlwinds gathered at the tips of the nails, gradually turning blue.</p><p>"Last time, I faced numerous dangers inside and gained nothing because I couldn't shake off Ling Zhuzi. He was watching from the sidelines, so I couldn't use these Wind Extremity Nails and had to resort to other methods... These treasures are the best choice, as they can counteract the barrier here."</p><p>The High Priestess flicked her fingers. "Go!"</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The two nails embedded themselves into the cliff walls, disappearing completely.</p><p>The stone walls trembled violently.</p><p>The black light within seemed like black water about to overflow.</p><p>A violent wind suddenly erupted in the valley, centered around the two nails.</p><p>The High Priestess formed hand seals, fully activating the treasures.</p><p>The black light on the stone walls gradually subsided, and the chaotic threads in the valley began to dim, eventually vanishing completely.</p><p>In an instant, the dense black threads thinned considerably. Although they still looked dangerous, navigating through them was no longer difficult for the High Priestess and her group.</p><p>Even the powerful High Priestess felt strained after this exertion.</p><p>She turned to the two elders behind her. "Elder Feng, Elder Yue, I'll trouble you to guard this place and prevent the human cultivators from taking the Wind Extremity Nails."</p><p>"Rest assured, High Priestess, we will defend this place to the death!" the elders said solemnly.</p><p>The High Priestess spoke gently, "There's no need to defend to the death. If you spot human cultivators before we return, take the Wind Extremity Nails and conceal yourselves. Return after they leave."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>One elder sat down cross-legged, while the other flew out of the valley to stand guard.</p><p>Having made all the necessary arrangements, the High Priestess nodded to Elder Fang and led the remaining witches into the barrier.</p><p>The black threads inside were still chaotic and dangerous.  The group carefully maneuvered through the gaps between the threads, heading deeper.</p><p>The valley was much larger than they had imagined.</p><p>Beneath their feet was bare rock, and above, the valley stretched beyond sight. They seemed to be in a deep canyon, with nothing but black threads around them.</p><p>The High Priestess and Elder Fang walked at the front, while the others followed silently.</p><p>They spread out to avoid accidentally triggering the barrier and affecting each other.</p><p>After walking for a while, the High Priestess paused, surveyed her surroundings, and retrieved a black stone disc from her waist.  Simple symbols were etched on its surface.</p><p>Holding the disc aloft, she chanted incomprehensible incantations.</p><p>Soon, an intricate tattoo appeared on her snow-white wrist.</p><p>Elder Fang and the others were not surprised by this.</p><p>These tattoos symbolized divine markings, the true power of the Witch Tribe, akin to their natal insect gu, representing their true heritage.</p><p>Unfortunately, the path of divine markings was a dead end, its highest level equivalent to only the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>All the witch experts present had delved into the study of divine markings, but all had failed without exception.</p><p>The natal insect gu, on the other hand, held great promise, with some having forged an unprecedented path through it.</p><p>Thinking of this, several witches subconsciously glanced at Elder Fang.</p><p>He had abandoned his human form, merging with an insect gu body for a breakthrough, a shocking act.  But if there were a high probability of reaching Nascent Soul, many would likely be willing to do the same.</p><p>After a period of activity, Elder Fang had become very secretive, cultivating in the Spirit Cicada Cave for years without accepting any disciples.</p><p>They wondered if he would share his secret techniques and pass down his legacy after his death.</p><p>Elder Fang remained silent, waiting for the High Priestess's next move.</p><p>'Ding!'</p><p>The stone disc trembled slightly in her hand.</p><p>As she wielded the power of her divine markings, countless shimmering raindrops began to fall around her, creating a hazy scene.</p><p>This seemingly beautiful image of a woman amidst the rain was taking place within the extremely dangerous ancient barrier.</p><p>The raindrops brushed past the black threads, a heart-stopping sight, yet they didn't touch the threads at all, demonstrating the High Priestess's exquisite control.</p><p>'Drip... Drip...'</p><p>The raindrops fell onto the stone disc, and the strange symbols on its surface seemed to come alive.  The disc became like a vast lake with surging waves.</p><p>The High Priestess gently swiped her finger across the disc.</p><p>The waves converged towards one point, reaching the edge of the disc but unable to go further.</p><p>Seeing this, the High Priestess looked up in that direction and declared, "It's there!"</p><p>The group immediately set off.</p><p>The High Priestess, holding the stone disc, led the way.</p><p>Elder Fang patrolled the area, vigilant for any unforeseen events that might disturb her.</p><p>They continued in this manner for a while.</p><p>Expressions of surprise appeared on everyone's faces.</p><p>The black threads of the barrier suddenly disappeared before them, revealing a circular stone hall.  It had no plaque or inscriptions.</p><p>The weathered stone hall exuded an ancient aura, clearly not a product of the present era.</p><p>After a brief examination, they found the entrance – a large, oblong stone slab.</p><p>The slab stood like a giant stele, serving as the hall's door.</p><p>At the center of the slab was a circular recess.</p><p>Everyone realized what it was for, their gazes falling upon the stone disc in the High Priestess's hand. The recess was the same size as the disc.</p><p>The High Priestess paused, taking a step forward.  She didn't immediately place the disc into the recess. Instead, she reached out and gently touched the stele, carefully sensing the barrier within the stone hall.</p>
