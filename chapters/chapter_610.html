<h1>Chapter 603: Tianshan Mountains</h1><p>Qin Sang tried to activate the green copper block, but ultimately failed.</p><p>He grabbed the green copper block and exited the stone chamber.</p><p>Turning back to look at the path he came from, the small bird puppet was still struggling in the Southern Bright Fire. Its body had mostly melted, extremely weak, its lifespan nearing its end.</p><p>Qin Sang held the green copper block in one hand and flew off on his sword, retracing his steps.</p><p>This time, as he passed through the Southern Bright Fire, he felt something different.</p><p>Holding the green copper block, he didn't feel like he was about to be incinerated in the next moment as he did before.  A faint warmth emanated from his palm, seeming to bear the brunt of the Southern Bright Fire's pressure.</p><p>Under the green glow of the copper block, the Southern Bright Fire seemed to dim slightly.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang successfully passed through the Southern Bright Fire and landed on the ground.</p><p>The small bird puppet within the demonic fire let out a silent wail and turned to ashes the moment Qin Sang landed.</p><p>Yun Youzi collapsed on the ground, drenched in sweat, near exhaustion. Manipulating the spirit array and the bird puppet had pushed him, who had just recovered, to his limit once again.</p><p>"This green copper block truly isn't afraid of the Southern Bright Fire!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the green copper block, recalling his recent experience, secretly amazed. However, apart from this one function, it seemed to be nothing more than a piece of scrap metal.</p><p>No matter how powerful the former immortal cauldron was, it was irrelevant now, just a fragment.</p><p>"Senior, are you alright?"</p><p>Qin Sang walked over, handed the green copper block to Yun Youzi, and helped him up, reminding him, "This copper block is extremely heavy, Senior, be careful."</p><p>Yun Youzi's eyes lit up with excitement. He took the green copper block with both hands, and indeed, his arms felt heavy. He placed it on the ground, waved away Qin Sang's support, stood up on his own, and said, "Thank you, Brother Qin, for your help! How is the mark on your hand? I need to meditate and recover to my peak before I can begin. Let me escort you out first."</p><p>Qin Sang raised his wrist and saw that the cracks on the wooden bracelet had increased to seven or eight, and even one of the dragon scales had shattered.</p><p>He estimated that the bracelet wouldn't last much longer.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't say anything more, wished Yun Youzi success, and walked towards the exit of the secret passage.</p><p>"Brother Qin, until we meet again!"</p><p>Yun Youzi, in his Daoist robe, stood tall at the entrance of the secret passage, bowed to Qin Sang with a carefree smile. "If this old Daoist fails, Brother Qin, the next time you enter the Violet Palace, light a stick of incense for me, that will be enough!"</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>Qin Sang solemnly returned the gesture.</p><p>If Yun Youzi failed to be reborn from the fire, this would be their final farewell!</p><p>The secret passage slowly closed. Qin Sang stood where he was, watching Yun Youzi resolutely turn and stride towards the flames.</p><p>……</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Another crack appeared on the dragon-shaped wooden bracelet. This time it was on the dragon's head, a dragon whisker shattered and drifted down.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, then picked up his pace, speeding towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>On the way, he sorted through the few gains he had made after entering the Violet Palace.</p><p>Having passed through so many places and experienced so many things, because of the accurate information, he actually hadn't spent much time, most of which was spent traveling.</p><p>Qin Sang was afraid that the wooden bracelet would break on the way and his location would be detected by Duke Dongyang, so he didn't dare to stop for even a moment to catch his breath.</p><p>The Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and the subsequent cultivation techniques of the *Yuanshen Raising Sword Chapter*, the two goals he had for entering the Violet Palace, were miraculously achieved, and he even gained more than he expected.</p><p>The Three Lights Jade Liquid went without saying, being regarded by Qin Sang as the most precious item, related to the Salvation Pill.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banner had the potential to become a mid-grade magic treasure, and the refined corpse had a high chance of transforming into a true Flying Night Devil, capable of fighting cultivators in the early stage of Core Formation without falling behind.</p><p>With all these things combined, after forming his core and before reaching Nascent Soul, a smooth path lay ahead.</p><p>The only imperfection was that the cultivation technique was incomplete, lacking the final touch.</p><p>Qin Sang went down the mountain while summoning the Flying Night Devil from the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>It was currently immobile, its spirit still in chaos. The transformation process was slower than Qin Sang had imagined and might continue for some time.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang had returned to the shore of the small lake. He put away the Flying Night Devil, took out the compass given to him by Yun Youzi, and entered the illusion array.</p><p>Because the illusion array was a remnant of an ancient formation, there were many weak points within it.</p><p>With the help of the compass, Qin Sang quickly found one and approached it.</p><p>He put away the compass, checked himself to make sure he hadn't left any traces, then reached out and crushed the wooden bracelet. He then stepped forward and entered the weak point.</p><p>He pretended to be lost and panicked, running around like a headless fly in the illusion array, unable to find a way out.</p><p>As Qin Sang ran around, he suddenly felt his body tighten and realized he was enveloped by a shadow.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. He looked up sharply and could only see a giant hand easily breaking through the illusion array and grabbing towards him, as fast as lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang was powerless to resist and was caught like a chick.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>When he came to his senses, he was already high in the air, having been directly pulled out of the illusion array.</p><p>Qin Sang stumbled, and after steadying himself, he found Duke Dongyang looking at him with a gloomy expression, the anger in his eyes almost overflowing.</p><p>Facing a Nascent Soul ancestor, his gaze brought terrifying pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang's back was instantly drenched in cold sweat, and he bowed to admit his guilt. "Ancestor, forgive me! Disciple was trapped in this illusion array, unable to find my way, and almost thought I was going to die inside. Fortunately, I was rescued. I have delayed Ancestor's important matters, and I deserve ten thousand deaths..."</p><p>He had delayed things because of his own affairs and had already anticipated incurring Duke Dongyang's wrath.</p><p>However, the reason Qin Sang gave was still plausible.</p><p>Within the illusion array, some areas could block the fluctuations of the mark. Although not many people who entered the inner hall from the jade wall landed on the central continent, and even fewer were unlucky enough to fall directly into the Immortal Restriction, it wasn't entirely impossible.</p><p>Disguised as an accident, as long as he was still useful, no matter how angry Duke Dongyang was, he wouldn't directly lash out.</p><p>After leaving the Violet Palace, once he successfully formed his core, his value would be different. Duke Dongyang shouldn't blame him for an accidental incident.</p><p>At the cost of incurring Duke Dongyang's anger in exchange for his own future, Qin Sang thought it was worth it.</p><p>Qin Sang explained with a panicked expression, choosing his words poorly.</p><p>Duke Dongyang's eyes were gloomy. He stared at Qin Sang for a moment, then glanced at the illusion array on the mountain and snorted coldly. "There are countless Immortal Restrictions here. It's your good fortune that you didn't die inside!"</p><p>With that, Duke Dongyang flicked his sleeve, and a wave of true essence swept up Qin Sang, heading straight for the Tianshan Mountains as fast as a shooting star.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to struggle.  He was carried by Duke Dongyang, secretly relieved that he had managed to conceal the truth. Fortunately, Duke Dongyang had important matters to attend to and didn't investigate further.</p><p>As long as he followed Duke Dongyang's instructions meticulously and completed the task at hand, this matter would be over.</p><p>Duke Dongyang's speed was extremely fast, the scenery below retreating at an alarming rate.</p><p>The distant Tianshan Mountains were soon within sight.</p>
