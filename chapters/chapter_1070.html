<h1>Chapter 162: Immortal Mountain</h1><p>"That old fiend and his followers arrived here, why haven't they made a move?"</p><p>Outside the Spiritlock Domain.</p><p>Hidden within a remote mountain forest, cultivators blended seamlessly with the stone forest.</p><p>A raspy voice emanated from a stone tree.  They were extremely cautious, utilizing a concealment formation to mask their presence completely.</p><p>"The Fiend Lord is after Skyreach Peak. Unfortunately, that old devil is tight-lipped. Even his trusted confidant, Elder Yin, knew nothing. We captured him alive but didn't get any information. It seems our prior arrangements are useless."</p><p>A stone tree stirred, revealing the figure of an old Daoist, who was none other than the Celestial Path Sect's leader, Ling Zhuzi!</p><p>He gazed up at Skyreach Peak, his brow deeply furrowed, and mused, "Within the Spiritlock Domain, even the Grand Elder's power will be suppressed, making it impossible to ascend Skyreach Peak. We can only ask Lady Li and myself to make the journey."</p><p>Saying this, Ling Zhuzi glanced towards a patch of fossilized flowers and grass nearby.</p><p>Space shimmered, and a woman in palace attire emerged.</p><p>The woman possessed exquisite beauty, yet her expression was stern and commanding, inspiring awe and reverence.</p><p>Lady Li was the leader of another righteous sect, the Rosy Cloud Sect.  Originally, she was merely the wife of the sect leader. After her husband's passing, she took the reins and led the sect.</p><p>A woman no less capable than a man, she not only revitalized the Rosy Cloud Sect but also achieved successive breakthroughs in her own cultivation. Now at the peak of Mid-Nascent Soul stage, she was a pillar of the righteous path, renowned alongside the three Trade Alliance leaders.</p><p>Her prestige resonated throughout the Inner Sea, yet she still preferred to be addressed as Lady Li.</p><p>Among the righteous cultivators, she held the greatest potential for advancing to Late-Nascent Soul stage. Even the Celestial Path Sect's Grand Elder's cultivation was inferior to hers.</p><p>Barring unforeseen circumstances, after Ling Zhuzi's passing, she would become the leader of the righteous path.</p><p>"Since Elder Mou is still alive, will he join the Fiend Lord in entering the mountain this time?"</p><p>If only the two of them entered, their strength would be no match for the demonic side.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi said gravely, "Forcing the Fiend Lord to act against Elder Mou in the name of humanity was already difficult. We believed that with thorough preparations, even if Elder Mou was protected by the Fiend Lord after being severely injured, he wouldn't be able to influence the situation.  Thus, we didn't press the matter.  However, I found an opportunity to use a secret technique to damage his foundation. He won't recover anytime soon. We have the element of surprise, and our chances of victory are still significant..."</p><p>Just then, another tree shadow swayed, and a Daoist silently emerged.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi handed a seal to the Daoist, "Grand Elder, I entrust this formation to your control. Adapt to the circumstances..."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The Daoist acknowledged.</p><p>...</p><p>On Skyreach Peak.</p><p>Before a sheer cliff face.</p><p>Clouds and mist swirled.</p><p>Pavilions and towers were built amongst the rocks, remnants of former grandeur faintly visible.</p><p>Now, without the protection of the ancient restrictions, they were dilapidated, a celestial realm returned to the mundane.</p><p>Streams had dried up, rocks were exposed, a broken bridge spanned halfway across a valley, pointing towards the cliff.</p><p>Judging by the traces, there might have once been a magnificent waterfall, a celestial river cascading down for thousands of miles, endlessly flowing.</p><p>Through the mist, three figures appeared one after another.  It was an old man and two youths, the descendants of the Four Saints, who had arrived after refining the Soul Cleansing Solution in the Trial Realm!</p><p>The young man and woman were only at the Late Core Formation stage, yet they could move freely within the heart of the Spiritlock Domain, on Skyreach Peak. If others saw them, they would surely be astonished.</p><p>"This is the last place I will show you, and the most crucial point in our ancestors' teachings!  You must engrave every word I say in your hearts. This is the mission of our Four Saints Palace."</p><p>The old man stood with his hands behind his back, gazing up at the cliff.  Just as he was about to step forward, he paused slightly and said, "Once inside, do not remove your protective talismans. Your cultivation is too low, and the Spiritlock Domain is too dangerous for you. Without the talismans' protection, you will instantly perish."</p><p>"We obey!"</p><p>The young man and woman felt a chill down their spines.</p><p>On their chests, blue threads of light formed jade-shaped talismanic images, clinging tightly to their bodies.</p><p>Along this journey, they had followed their master and witnessed countless ruins, heard thrilling stories, and their minds were still reeling.</p><p>The old man walked to the cliff face and drew a talisman in the air. Then, he forced out a drop of blood and infused it into the talisman.</p><p>The blood talisman merged into the stone wall.</p><p>On the seemingly ordinary cliff face, an incredibly complex restriction suddenly appeared. The blood talisman integrated into the restriction, opening a gap, like a door.</p><p>The three entered one after another.</p><p>...</p><p>Above the Immortal Restriction.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Ning Wu Hui, walking along the white jade corridor.</p><p>This path was unexpectedly long. Qin Sang suspected they had already crossed the boundaries of the Spiritlock Domain, yet he still couldn't see the end. Ahead lay an endless expanse of rosy clouds.</p><p>His mind was constantly tense.</p><p>No wonder, the surroundings were too perilous.</p><p>Above and below were the Rosy Cloud Immortal Restriction and surging spiritual tides. The white jade corridor appeared thin and fragile, as if it could be destroyed at any moment.</p><p>Qin Sang widened his eyes, searching everywhere, but couldn't find any similar white jade corridors.  Moreover, this path had no branches, offering no alternative routes.</p><p>He patiently followed Ning Wu Hui and, after a while, finally reached the end and saw a white jade platform.</p><p>"An Immortal Palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, but upon closer inspection, he realized that this place didn't match the images of the immortal palaces he had seen.</p><p>"It's Skyreach Peak!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, his gaze piercing through layers of rosy clouds, vaguely discerning blurred images.</p><p>It was a celestial mountain that resembled a pillar of heaven, the part of Skyreach Peak that extended into the Immortal Restriction, majestic and extraordinary.  Even from here, its summit remained hidden from view.</p><p>The platform was built on a protruding rock, resembling a viewing platform.</p><p>However, the platform was now submerged in rosy clouds, and the mountain below was barren, offering no scenic views.</p><p>The two quickly walked onto the platform and discovered two sets of stairs, one on the left and one on the right, extending from the platform in different directions.</p><p>One was intact, winding downwards around the mountain.</p><p>The other was broken just after the first few steps.</p><p>"We go down from here."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui pointed to the intact corridor.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, stared intently at the other set of stairs.  "Where does this path lead?"</p><p>If this place was connected to the ancient teleportation formation, and the path Ning Wu Hui indicated led down the mountain, this one might lead to the formation!</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui shook her head.</p><p>Qin Sang walked over and examined it carefully, not missing a single detail.  Unlike before, the broken section didn't affect the Immortal Restriction. This area remained incredibly dangerous, with no visible weaknesses or exits.</p><p>He activated his Heavenly Eye divine ability, only to be disappointed.  Ahead lay only a bare mountain wall.  There might never have been a path here.</p><p>"Alas! I have to wait for Senior Qing Zhu to appear before I can find the way out..."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed resignedly and turned to follow Ning Wu Hui.</p><p>The white jade corridor was built along the mountain, winding through forests and valleys, before turning sharply downwards.</p><p>The long stone steps were almost vertical.</p><p>As they descended, the light of the Rosy Cloud Immortal Restriction flickered almost right before their eyes, and the spiritual tide surged towards them like a tsunami, seemingly about to crash into them, but ultimately blocked by the corridor.</p><p>Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat, carefully inching downwards, finally reaching the end with a sigh of relief.</p>
