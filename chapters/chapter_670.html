<h1>Chapter 662:  The Golden Barrier Grass</h1><p>Chapter 662:  The Golden Barrier Grass</p><p>Qin Sang flipped his hand, revealing a crystal-clear crystal in his palm.</p><p>He channeled his true energy into the crystal.  The crystal trembled, a milky white light blooming within, then displaying a vivid scene.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the crystal.</p><p>The Sky Tower stood tall, an armless corpse falling from the heavens.</p><p>Through the thick clouds, only a blurry shadow of the corpse was visible, shrouded in dense corpse qi, staining even the white clouds with an eerie color.</p><p>Just as the armless corpse was about to fall from the clouds, it suddenly disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, several powerful figures soared into the sky, but were blocked below the cloud layer, unable to enter, hovering in mid-air.</p><p>At this point, the scene in the crystal abruptly ended.</p><p>Why he suddenly vanished from the Seven Killing Hall and reappeared in the distant Wu God Continent remained a huge mystery, lingering in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>Was it a unique restriction within the Seven Killing Hall that transported him here?</p><p>Or was someone mysterious in the Sky Tower who took him out of the Seven Killing Hall and left him here?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure it out, but he realized the ancient teleportation array was probably at the top of the Sky Tower, and he had wasted his time in the Western Frontier.</p><p>To find out the reason and locate the ancient teleportation array, he had to personally enter the Seven Killing Hall again.</p><p>The next opening of the Seven Killing Hall wouldn't be for decades, until a low point in the protective Immortal array allowed some factions to attempt entry.</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang's priority was to improve his strength as much as possible.</p><p>Although he didn't get all the information about the Seven Killing Hall from Du Han, he gleaned enough to understand its extreme danger, a place of constant death, comparable to the outer hall of the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>It was definitely not the otherworldly paradise of the Ziwei Palace's inner hall.</p><p>At the early stage of the Core Formation stage, he was merely at the bottom among cultivators who entered the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>"With the cultivation speed of the 'Chapter of Soul-Nourishing Sword', as long as I diligently cultivate, a few decades should be enough for me to break through to the mid-Core Formation stage, after all, this cultivation method has no bottlenecks in minor realms... I need to go to the Demon Sea as soon as possible," Qin Sang muttered. The Storm Demon Sea was the most suitable place for his cultivation, allowing him to comprehend killing talismans while also exchanging demonic beasts for spirit stones.</p><p>Qin Sang was deeply worried. If the Sky Tower was as dangerous as rumored, would he have to wait until he reached the Nascent Soul stage before he could return to Xiaohan Domain?</p><p>Without the DuåŽ„ Dan, what were his chances of forming a Nascent Soul?</p><p>Qin Sang was very troubled.</p><p>He also secretly rejoiced.</p><p>It was said that the clouds at the top of the Sky Tower were very unusual, containing ancient restrictions that even Nascent Soul masters couldn't penetrate with their divine sense.</p><p>He couldn't use divine sense to investigate the identity of the corpse.</p><p>Relying only on his eyes, through the hazy clouds and dense corpse qi, he couldn't see the corpse's face, and due to the corpse's curled-up posture, even its body shape wasn't clear.</p><p>Because the corpse qi was so strong, and because it fell from the remote top of the Sky Tower, no one who witnessed it would have guessed it was a living person.</p><p>After his severed arm was restored and the corpse qi was cleared, no one would believe Qin Sang was that armless corpse.</p><p>After learning about the significant connection between the Seven Killing Hall and the corpse, and the intense attention it attracted, Qin Sang had been very nervous, fearing that his identity would be exposed, making it impossible for him to move freely in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Seeing the scene in the crystal, he finally felt relieved.</p><p>From Du Han, he learned that after the armless corpse disappeared, some Nascent Soul masters believed that it had been stolen in broad daylight, almost causing a huge commotion.</p><p>Du Han didn't know how those Nascent Soul masters settled it, but a great battle was averted.</p><p>After the Seven Killing Hall closed, some human factions spread the news of searching for the armless corpse.  Du Han and others then realized that those human Nascent Soul cultivators hadn't found it.</p><p>After returning to Wu God Continent, they immediately reported the incident at the Seven Killing Hall to their sects, hoping to emulate the humans and search for the armless corpse there.</p><p>What if it landed in Wu God Continent?</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall was one of the most important secret realms for humans, and the armless corpse might hold some secrets.</p><p>Relying solely on those who had been to the Seven Killing Hall, their power was limited and they couldn't mobilize the entire Wu God Continent, they needed the support of Nascent Soul masters.</p><p>After Du Han reported it to his sect, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. Later, he learned that his master was in seclusion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after contacting others, he found that other sects were the same.  The Nascent Soul masters of the major sects had coincidentally chosen to go into seclusion at this time.</p><p>Among them, even a top sect among the Wu people, ranked among the top three, had all its Nascent Soul masters in seclusion.</p><p>No way such a coincidence could happen!</p><p>They immediately realized that the Yuan Ying masters were probably no longer in the sect, surely secretly plotting something of great importance.</p><p>The Wu clan wasn't united; something huge must be afoot, involving the entire high command.</p><p>Compared to a matter concerning the entire Wu clan, what was a severed arm and an ancient corpse?</p><p>The Wu clan's clandestine actions were likely timed to coincide with the human race's focus on the Qisha Hall, making it easier to evade detection.</p><p>After learning of this, Qin Sang quickly dismissed it from his mind.</p><p>Though human, he wasn't from the Canglang Sea region and wouldn't risk exposure by revealing anything.</p><p>Furthermore, the Wu clan hadn't tried to conceal their actions; they probably just needed a little time and weren't worried about being discovered by the humans; their goals were likely already achieved.</p><p>With the Wu clan's Yuan Ying masters missing, the human spies within the Wu clan must have already noticed something amiss; Qin Sang's involvement was unnecessary.</p><p>Lacking support from their sect, Du Han and the others could only contact fellow cultivators, each choosing a relatively safe area to gather information and try their luck.</p><p>A thorough search of the entire Wu clan territory would have to wait until the return of the Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>Du Han's chosen area was northern Xijiang, including the Xiongshan region and other areas where his fellow cultivators and brothers were also searching.</p><p>Xijiang was vast, and the local cultivators were not strong, so they needed to search thoroughly.</p><p>Du Han chose this area for two reasons:</p><p>First, he bought information in Qisha Hall from a newly acquainted human cultivator about a Thousand-Handed Spider Fruit hidden in the Xiongshan region, which could help his senior disciple form a Golden Core.</p><p>Second, it was because of a medicinal herb called Jinlan Grass.</p><p>Jinlan Grass wasn't particularly valuable initially.</p><p>However, cultivators later discovered that it was effective against the demonic energy that plagued nascent souls, causing its value to skyrocket.  It was now extremely rare.</p><p>Du Han had inadvertently discovered a Jinlan Grass in the heart of Xijiang, but it hadn't reached peak maturity. He killed the guardian beast, then placed a barrier to conceal the herb's aura.</p><p>The Jinlan Grass matured recently, and upon returning to the Wushen Continent, Du Han immediately went to harvest it.</p>
