      “How do you feel?”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">

     <p class="calibre5">
      No. 1 opened his eyes. His eyes had been modified, too. They
                flashed red light, and his field of sight could zoom in and out
                like a camera lens. He looked down at his palms covered in
                metallic skin, and as he moved his fingers around, a hideous
                smile appeared on his face.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Never been better.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With a buzz from the exoskeleton, he punched at the metal wall
                and created a pit. His hideous smile expanded and turned into a
                maniacal laugh.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Finally, after enduring endless pain, he had gained transcendent
                power.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He enjoyed the surge of confidence.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      No. 1 realized that with this power, the Zero that had once
                killed him was nothing more than a weakling.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      They were not on the same level anymore.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Zero, don’t get killed by anyone else before I find you.” No.
                1’s eyes were vicious as he talked to himself. “You’re mine.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Cyberlos walked out of the experiment lab to report to the
                leader.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “As the schedule has been brought forward, the experiment has
                yet to reach a mature stage. No. 1 was the only one that could
                endure and finish all the modifications. I did not think that he
                could endure all that torture,” Cyberlos said.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “He was killed by Zero. Hatred turned his will indestructible,”
                the leader said indifferently.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “About Zero…” Cyberlos narrowed his eyes. “If he really has the
                power to predict the future, we have to get rid of him before
                the war. Otherwise, all of our strategic deployments and
                planning will be exposed.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “He’s like a rat in the sewers, hiding too deep.” The leader
                fiddled with his fingers before coming to a decision. “Activate
                Destiny’s Child, find his position.”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Cyberlos smiled. He had always been very interested in the
                Destiny’s Child.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The duo walked in the twisted corridor and past locked gates
                that each required higher authority than the last. Elite teams
                of guards patrolled the corridor in synchronized footsteps. The
                secret room was deeply hidden.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader walked to the gate and entered the password. Next was
                the fingerprint scanner. He removed the glove that he had always
                been wearing. His hand looked horrible—it was full of scars like
                it had once been bitten and chewed by a beast.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      There were scars on his fingertips, too. The leader put the
                glove back on after the authorization was completed. The metal
                gate slid open to the side. Only the leader could open this
                gate.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Inside was a hibernation pod with a man wearing a metal muzzle
                in it, and the nutritional liquid injections were all that was
                keeping his body alive.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader controlled the hibernation pod to inject a drug that
                would wake the person inside. The door opened up, and the man
                slowly opened his eyes. He was extremely calm. His eyes had no
                signs of life, and he did not seem to care if he was asleep or
                awake.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Germinal Organization called this man ‘Destiny’s Child’. He
                had some ability to affect the future with his words, but the
                Germinal Organization did not know many of the details.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader waved behind his back, and his subordinate handed the
                documents on Zero over. He then flipped the pages. Destiny’s
                Child looked at the pages without even changing the focus of his
                pupils.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader flipped through the pages twice and said, “Make him
                appear.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Destiny’s Child finally blinked.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader took out a specially made key and opened the metal
                mouth mask of Destiny’s Child.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Destiny’s Child closed his eye for five minutes. When he opened
                them again, he said slowly with a hoarse voice, “He will come
                here himself.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader’s breath paused for a second and demanded, “When?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Not too long.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Hope it’s successful this time.” Cyberlos shook his head.
                Destiny’s Child’s ability did not work every time. The smaller
                the request, the more likely it was to succeed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The leader put the metal mask back on Destiny’s Child and pushed
                him back into the hibernation pod.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The guards outside careful extended their heads and looked at
                each other with confusion.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Why were the leader and Cyberlos talking into the air with
                themselves?
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After staying in the last novice village in the Western
                Continent for three days, Han Xiao left hurriedly in a plane.
                His next stop was the Northern Continent, which would be a long
                trip.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The average level of players was getting close to 20, so Han
                Xiao had to speed up on his schedule.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Stars filled the night sky outside the window. The plane flew
                stably in the clouds with its preset route.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The stars glowed in the clear eyes of Han Xiao.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Every time Han Xiao looked at the night sky and the bright stars
                in it, he thought of the countless civilizations and
                opportunities that existed in the universe.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was very aware of this, and every time he thought of
                it, he was filled with ambition.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       A man’s journey belongs to the sea of stars.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had already built his base on Planet Aquamarine—this was the
                starting point. The more he accumulated here, the more confident
                he would be.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao opened the interface and counted his earnings.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the more than ten days that he had stayed in the Western
                Continent, he had robbed a large number of drugs, one of which
                had an unknown effect but could potentially be a very valuable
                semi-finished drug. He had also built many relationships, with
                Dion, two superheroes that he had no idea of what use they would
                provide, Hannes, and others. Furthermore, he had managed to
                trigger the hidden main storyline.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He also built the mechanical suit, Viper.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Viper could increase both his Strength and Dexterity
                drastically, which made up for the Mechanics’ weaknesses in
                these two attributes in the early stages. In Han Xiao’s mind,
                Viper was his second battle plan, and it was only a prototype.
                He needed to continuously add more modules to it so as to
                enhance his combat abilities.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Sniping was for assassination, kiting, and stealth; Viper was
                for head-on combat, and he actually already had a few
                modification ideas for it.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      His largest earnings were the experience and money from the four
                novice villages. [Energy Training Technique] sold very well just
                as he expected, and it had brought him an outrageous and
                unbelievable amount of rewards.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      120,000,000 Experience!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Those who could afford [Energy Training Technique] were the
                players who were rather ahead—not everyone could afford it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The class-change knowledge and basic skills were selling at a
                low profit margin, but the number of people who bought it was
                the highest.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He already had 20,000,000 Experience saved up. Thus, the accumulated
                experience on the interface totaled to 140,000,000!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao felt content as he looked at the long string of zeros.
                Even for the players at his level, this amount of experience was
                beyond their imagination. Some players could not even get as
                much experience during the whole version 1.0.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Nice.
      </em>
      Han Xiao was overjoyed. He would
                not have to worry about experience points for a long time.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As long as he settled the two biggest obstacles—changing class
                and upgrading tier—his level would increase tremendously, and he
                could even splurge on upgrading his skills. It would be easy for
                him to max the levels of all his abilities except for
                blueprints, and most importantly, he could infuse blueprints in
                bulk and build up his inventory.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Experience points were not the only thing. He had also earned
                3,600,000 Aquarium dollars by selling [Energy Training
                Technique], and he had sold five referral letters, which totaled
                to 4,850,000 dollars. His wallet was packed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Worth it!
      </em>
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao rubbed his palms. He could not wait to open the
                interface.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Excluding blueprints, the abilities he had yet to reach max
                level were: [Accurate Shooting Level3], [Special Combat Level1],
                [Stealth Level1], [Steady Aim Level1], [Night Attack Level1], [Medium
                Enhancement Level4], [Energy—Magnetic Enhancement Level1],
                [Meticulous Repairs Level1], and the amazing [Pickpocketing Level1]
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Without even looking at the experience points they needed, he
                maxed the level of each of those abilities!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       That’s the feeling of being rich!
