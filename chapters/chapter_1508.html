<h1>Chapter 1499 The Heavenly Tribulation</h1><p>The aura of the tribulation thunder was unique, imbued with the divine might of Heaven.  This was a pressure that terrified all cultivators; even amidst the chaotic energy storm, it could be clearly felt.  Yin Changsheng felt it especially keenly!</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The storm intensified, seemingly becoming even more violent due to the appearance of the tribulation thunder. Suddenly, a figure shot into the sky, appearing and disappearing within the turbulent storm.</p><p>Yin Changsheng hadn't died.</p><p>Previously, inside the ice coffin, Yin Changsheng wore a jade crown, looking like a young man. Aside from being thinner and paler than the average person, he appeared largely unchanged, possessing exceptional bearing.  Now, however, his hair was dishevelled, his appearance like that of a madman. His body was emaciated, his skin withered, and his veins stood out prominently. His features were distorted, his expression twisted with madness, as if he had completely lost his reason. His eyes were wide, bloodshot, fixed on the tribulation thunder, filled with fear, anger, hatred, and insanity!</p><p>“Damn Heaven, you dare to obstruct my ascension!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng roared, his demonic intent shaking the heavens.  After using the Hanging Sword Pavilion against Qin Sang, his mind was unstable, and demonic thoughts silently infected him, causing a drastic change in his personality – he had fallen into demonic possession.</p><p>The tribulation thunder summoned by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, while outwardly strong, lacked the true power of a Heavenly Tribulation, but the pressure it exuded was strikingly real. In this state, the crazed Yin Changsheng couldn't distinguish between truth and falsehood, mistaking it for his true Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p>He had resorted to forbidden techniques, hiding in the ice coffin, enduring endless coldness, all to evade the tribulation, delay it, and fight against Heaven, defying fate. Now, just as his plans were about to succeed, the tribulation suddenly arrived. How could Yin Changsheng not despair?</p><p>A lifetime of cultivation.  Carefully laid plans.  Everything had lost its meaning. How could he not be enraged!</p><p>“Aaah!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng let out an incredibly shrill cry. Fear and rage completely shattered his sanity.</p><p>*Ting ting ting…*</p><p>The bell’s tone remained clear, yet now held a melancholic quality, as if sensing the fate of its master and itself.  The Hanging Sword Pavilion returned to its master's side, spinning rapidly, its nine swords constantly moving. The radiant light was even brighter than before, a final brilliant display as it charged towards the tribulation thunder!</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang gasped. Yin Changsheng still had the strength! Or rather, this was Yin Changsheng's true power. While in the ice coffin, facing him and Tong Lingyu, he had been distracted by maintaining the forbidden technique to evade the tribulation.</p><p>Yin Changsheng was likely infinitely close to the Divine Transformation stage. This was the power of a half-step Divine Transformation cultivator!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>As if a night storm were approaching, lightning flashed and thunder roared. The vibrant sunset on the horizon seemed about to be torn apart by the thunder, then swallowed by darkness.</p><p>However, this scene didn’t happen.</p><p>What followed took Yin Changsheng by surprise.</p><p>The tribulation thunder plunged into the radiant light, immediately swallowed by it, never emerging again. It was simply consumed, without causing any ripples.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly was merely in the mid-fourth transformation stage. No matter how strong its thunder manipulation technique, it was no match for the Hanging Sword Pavilion.</p><p>How could the Heavenly Tribulation be so weak?</p><p>Yin Changsheng stared blankly.</p><p>At this moment, Yin Changsheng's aura was exposed!</p><p>…</p><p>The cave's ceiling wasn't solid but an illusion created by ancient prohibitions.  From above, the cave was actually a giant sinkhole on a massive peak, the peak situated on a floating mountain. The place was barren, with exposed rocks, extremely desolate. The ceiling was just part of the ancient prohibition.</p><p>Around the sinkhole, thick fog perpetually lingered, forming a barrier, sealing off the location and creating a forbidden zone. This fog was black, blending with the darkness of the Sacred Land, making it difficult to see with the naked eye.</p><p>At the edge of the black fog, a group of people were engaged in a fierce battle, all cultivators of the Xuan Tian Palace, without exception. One side was led by Yin, the Palace Master of the Imperial Palace, and Shang Lu and the Yue clan cultivators from the Tian Shan lineage. The other side comprised Jiang, the Palace Master of the Yuanji Palace, Elder Mei, and others.</p><p>The battle in the sinkhole was blocked by the black fog prohibition, having no effect on the outside.  The Xuan Tian Palace, already torn apart by the conflict between the Palace Master and the Grand Elder, neglected the invading demons of the Sacred Land, engaging in internal strife instead. These people were unaware of the situation inside, unsure of who had won between Yin Changsheng and Tong Lingyu.</p><p>With the element of surprise, Yin and Shang Lu clearly had the upper hand, surrounding Jiang and his group.</p><p>The black fog churned, treasure lights flashed repeatedly in various colors, the booming sounds continuous.  Various magical treasures and divine abilities bombarded back and forth, a dazzling spectacle.  Though from the same sect, they showed no mercy to each other.</p><p>The Hall Master Jiang and his group looked rather disheveled, huddled together in a defensive formation, desperately resisting.  Seeing their imminent victory,</p><p>Shang Lu let out a boisterous laugh.  He bellowed, “Surrender now! Do you think Tong Ni can survive the Palace Master’s wrath?  Your collusion with Tong Ni and attempt to murder the Palace Master are unforgivable crimes!  If you repent and abandon your wicked ways, the Palace Master, in their mercy, might spare your lives.”</p><p>Elder Mei angrily retorted, “Yin Changsheng is no longer the Palace Master we once knew! You are aiding a tyrant who murdered the Grand Elder.  The Xuan Tian Palace is doomed!”</p><p>“Lies!” Shang Lu’s face darkened, and he exploded in fury.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a tremor deep within his soul, and looked up sharply at the sky.  Almost simultaneously, everyone else sensed the anomaly, gazing upwards. They felt the immense pressure of Heaven's might, and a deep-seated fear washed over them, causing their expressions to change drastically.</p><p>“That’s…a Heavenly Tribulation…” a nascent Nascent Soul cultivator stammered, still fresh in his memory from his own recent tribulation.  To his horror, the Heavenly Tribulation was still forming, yet the terrifying pressure already far surpassed his own. He had no doubt that if this tribulation targeted him, he would be reduced to dust in an instant.</p><p>For a moment,</p><p>a deathly silence fell over the battlefield. Everyone seemed to forget their attacks. Their expressions varied wildly, a cacophony of thoughts flooding their minds.</p><p>Shang Lu stared fixedly at the heavens, a fervent smile spreading across his face. “Haha! Haha! The Heavenly Tribulation descends! The Palace Master has finally broken through to the Transcendence Stage…”</p><p>Transcendence Stage!</p><p>These three words struck everyone like a hammer, their minds reeling.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang and Elder Mei exchanged a look. Neither had ever witnessed a Transcendence Stage Heavenly Tribulation, but they sensed something was amiss.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Sacred Grounds,</p><p>darkness enveloped everything. Only a few floating mountains glowed faintly, insignificant against the vastness of the Sacred Grounds and the swirling darkness.</p><p>Suddenly,</p><p>a thunderous boom, like the shattering of the heavens, erupted from a deep within the Sacred Grounds, followed by continuous thunderclaps.  Unseen dark clouds gathered above a massive peak.</p><p>Gale-force winds howled, and black mist billowed from the peak.</p><p>These changes happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Heaven's might descended!</p><p>The cultivators on the other floating mountains felt it instinctively and turned towards the source.</p><p>The souls of the lower-cultivators trembled, consumed by fear and confusion, unable to comprehend what was happening.</p>
