Chapter 573: Ghost Howls and Jade Buddha


This was an endless expanse of ancient tombs.
Dongyang Bo called it the Immortal Tombs.
However, no one knew why such a vast cemetery existed within the Immortal Palace, who built it, or what lay buried within.
Immortals?
Or mortals?
These Immortal Tombs had weathered countless ages, their stones worn low by the passage of time, many cracked or even collapsed.
Most of the tombstones were destroyed; even the surviving ones were mere fragments, their inscriptions lost to time.
Qin Sang unexpectedly found a broken spear half-buried in the earth, heavily rusted.
The rust obscured its former glory, yet its presence remained undeniable.  It must have been a terrifying weapon in its prime, now reduced to impotent rust, abandoned in the earth.
Similar fragments were not uncommon, all their power leached away by time, reduced to mere scrap metal.
Where there is decay, there may be treasure.
The King Kong Zhuo hung high, its light forming a protective barrier around Qin Sang and his four companions.
Within the ghostly mist, faint ghostly figures, sensing intruders, shrieked and clawed, lunging at them. The mist churned and writhed.
‘Rip!’
When the ghostly mist touched the King Kong Zhuo's white light, it seemed to ignite, emitting a piercing shriek as it rapidly dissipated.
The ghostly figures hidden within fared even worse.  Touched by the King Kong Zhuo’s light, they only managed a brief scream before vanishing completely.
Perhaps due to being on the outer edge of the Immortal Tombs, these ghosts were weak. Under the protection of the King Kong Zhuo, Qin Sang and his companions felt little danger from the ghostly mist.
However, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan's movements became noticeably cautious.
The area was densely packed with tombs; there was hardly any safe ground to tread. Even seemingly level areas were actually collapsed tombs, giving off an unsettling sensation when stepped upon.
They proceeded cautiously, weaving through the graveyard.
The ghosts they encountered grew stronger, but both Yuan Ying cultivators handled them easily.
Concerned about alarming a Ghost King comparable in power to a Yuan Ying cultivator, they moved at a slow pace.  Even so, after half an hour, they still hadn't left the Immortal Tombs; a grey expanse stretched endlessly before them.
The extent of the Immortal Tombs already surpassed the palace ahead.
Qin Sang felt a chill.
How many were buried here?
What kind of horrifying massacre could have claimed so many lives?
Fortunately, despite its vastness, the Immortal Tombs were not as densely populated with ghosts as they'd imagined.
The ghost world seemed to have a strict hierarchy; weaker ghosts only dared to roam the periphery, clustering together, creating an illusion of abundance.
Deeper within the tombs, they sometimes went long stretches without encountering a single ghost.
They silently proceeded among countless tombs. After another fifteen minutes, Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan suddenly stopped.
Qin Sang and the others looked around curiously, but found nothing.
After a moment, Dongyang Bo said gravely, "It's Dongyun Xian!  He seems to be engaged with a powerful ghost. Judging by the sounds, he's not having an easy time. I hear there's a Ghost King in the vicinity, one comparable to a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator. Very troublesome; Dongyun Xian likely encountered it!"
Chen Yan glanced at Dongyang Bo. "You intend to help him repel the Ghost King?"
"Certainly not."
Dongyang Bo sneered, "Although the two realms have decided to cooperate, we remain rivals within the Ziwei Palace. That old fox Dongyun Xian is deeply entrenched; he won't die easily. We'll use this opportunity, while he draws the Ghost King's attention, to pass through this area and get ahead of him."
With that, Dongyang Bo gestured towards the King Kong Zhuo, extinguishing its light.
The seven figures suppressed their auras, concealing themselves within the ghostly mist, making them almost imperceptible. They bypassed the battlefield ahead and quickened their pace.
As they rounded the edge of the battle, Dongyun Xian, engaged with the Ghost King, sensed their presence.
Dongyun Xian wielded a bamboo flute-like treasure, manifesting countless flute shadows to lash out at the Ghost King, nearly shattering half its body.
Dongyun Xian glanced behind him, his brow furrowing.
At that moment, the Ghost King, flung back by the flute, shimmered and instantly regenerated, lunging again, giving Dongyun Xian no chance to escape.
Dongyun Xian roared, "Insolent creature!"
Unable to spare any attention to others, he focused on engaging the Ghost King.
On the other side, Dongyang Bo and the others continued their relentless advance, ignoring the fierce battle beside them.
As they neared the battlefield…


The piercing shrieks grew louder, sharper, like demonic whispers that wormed their way into their minds.  They struggled to shake them off, their minds starting to feel the strain.

The closer they got to the battlefield, the more intense the effect. Yu Wanshen was the first to show signs of distress. His face paled, sweat beaded on his brow, and his eyes glazed over in brief moments of confusion, clearly affected by the haunting cries.

Initially, these moments of confusion sparked his awareness, allowing him to break free.

But breaking free became increasingly difficult. The periods of disorientation lengthened, and each time he snapped out of it, the terror etched onto his face deepened. His back was drenched in sweat.

He attempted to use the shrieking to temper his spirit, a futile endeavor.

After a few steps, Yu Wanshen could take no more.  He used the power of his Vajra Pestle to seal his five senses, minimizing the impact of the shrieks.  His condition immediately improved.

Mu Yifeng and Ji Qing followed suit.

Then Qin Sang and Qiu Mu Bai also sealed their senses.

Qin Sang, in fact, was unaffected by the hallucinatory cries. He had encountered similar demonic sounds in the Sky Corpse Cave years ago, and his jade Buddha had shielded him then.

Once again, the jade Buddha effortlessly blocked the shrieks, protecting Qin Sang and bringing him a profound sense of calm.

These were the shrieks of a ghost king comparable to a Yuan Ying mid-stage cultivator, yet they failed to even slightly affect the jade Buddha!

Despite the distance, Qin Sang remained completely unaffected.  It was clear that even if the ghost king were present, the result would be the same.

Throughout their journey, the jade Buddha repeatedly demonstrated its power and reliability, never failing Qin Sang.

To avoid suspicion from Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan, Qin Sang pretended to succumb, sealing his senses.  He didn't know how long passed before his senses suddenly returned.

The mist and the graves were gone. They had finally left the fairy graveyard.

Behind them lay the grey-white ghostly fog; before them stretched a vast expanse of land. The earth was the same dark brown as that of the graveyard, stained with blood.

At the far end of this plain stood a massive earthen altar.

Shaped like an ancient pyramid, its peak pierced the clouds.  Crimson blood煞 energy swirled around it, revealing ancient restrictions within.

Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan, carrying them in flight, bypassed the altar, continuing onward.

Perhaps even they lacked the power to break the ancient restrictions upon it.
