<h1>**Chapter 278: Western Wasteland Town**</h1><p>Western Wasteland Town.</p><p>This town was completely exposed to the daylight, blown by the wind and sand, and only when the celestial phenomenon hits, will the magic circle open.</p><p>The north wind was howling, and yellow sand was rolling.</p><p>In the dim sand and dust, a figure loomed dimly and slowly walked toward the town.</p><p>In such a sandstorm, this person was not in a hurry at all, strolling leisurely. If mortals saw it, their jaws would drop in shock. But in Western Wasteland Town, it was very normal. Mortals could hardly reach such a far place. Only cultivators frequented here.</p><p>To cultivators, such a sandstorm was no different from scratching an itch, and what they feared was the celestial phenomenon that would follow the sandstorm.</p><p>The Daoist walked out of the sandstorm, but his body was exceptionally clean. His new Daoist robes were not wrinkled at all. Whenever sand and dust fell on it, they were bounced away by a layer of blue light.</p><p>The Daoist did not seem old, but his temperament was quite calm. His true age should not be as young as he looked.</p><p>During this period of time, the people in Western Wasteland Town have gotten used to seeing strangers from outside. They just glanced at him casually and ignored him.</p><p>"The celestial phenomenon is appearing more and more frequently."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the stone road of the town, stopped, and sighed to himself, thinking of the spiritual tide that Yunyouzi had mentioned.</p><p>Once the spiritual tide came, whether it was an immortal mansion or a secret realm, it had nothing to do with Qin Sang. His strength did not allow him to stroll around in the spiritual tide at will. The best thing to do was to hide outside the important pass and cultivate in seclusion, waiting for the spiritual tide to pass.</p><p>However, as the spiritual tide approached, affected by it, the environment of the ancient immortal battlefield would become increasingly harsh and harder to survive in. This was related to everyone's vital interests.</p><p>Human power was limited, and Qin Sang could do nothing about it. He only hoped that the spiritual tide would not come too soon.</p><p>Qin Sang brushed off the non-existent dust on his Daoist robes and squinted to look at this desolate town.</p><p>He and Yunyouzi had separated a month ago. Yunyouzi had entered Western Wasteland Town ten days before him. They had not contacted each other since, and he did not know if Yunyouzi had successfully infiltrated the target's team.</p><p>The scale of Western Wasteland Town was somewhat beyond Qin Sang's imagination. In terms of both size and population, it was the largest town that Qin Sang had seen in the ancient immortal battlefield.</p><p>Despite the raging wind and sand, one could still see many figures on the streets. It was estimated that most of them were attracted by the Qiuhong Market.</p><p>Qin Sang did not see Yunyouzi. Recalling what Yunyouzi had said to him before leaving, Qin Sang's eyes turned to the northeast corner of the town.</p><p>There was a wooden building there with a tall幌子, which was a teahouse.</p><p>...</p><p>"This Daoist priest looks unfamiliar. I have never seen you before. May I ask your Daoist name?"</p><p>The owner of the teahouse came over personally to fill Qin Sang's teacup, looking at Qin Sang secretly.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes had been roaming around the streets. He retracted his gaze upon hearing this, looked up at the owner, and cupped his hands, "Greetings, fellow Daoist. My Daoist name is Qingfeng. You are right. This is my first time in Western Wasteland Town."</p><p>The owner was also a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage. However, judging from his age, he had probably given up on the path to immortality and opened a teahouse in this town to spend the rest of his life.</p><p>"Daoist priest Qingfeng, you came to Western Wasteland Town in the wind and sand. You must be also here for the Qiuhong Market?" The owner asked straightforwardly.</p><p>"Most people are here for that."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and pointed to the people hurrying about on the street. There were not only Foundation Establishment stage cultivators, but even Qi Refining stage cultivators.</p><p>Foundation Establishment stage cultivators would also take certain risks to enter the Qiuhong Market, and the danger faced by Qi Refining stage cultivators was even greater. They might not be able to reach the Qiuhong Market alive, let alone break through the formation.</p><p>However, the saying goes that wealth comes with risks. There was never a shortage of daring people in the world.</p><p>The owner nodded. Seeing that Qin Sang was quite talkative, he sat down in front of him and chatted with him as if they were just chatting, "I wonder how much Daoist priest Qingfeng knows about Qiuhong Market? You came here alone. If you don't have any companions, you need to find some helpers. Otherwise, I'm afraid it will be difficult for you to break through the guardian formation of the Qiuhong Market alone."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang put down his teacup, leaned forward slightly, and said with pretended doubt, "On my way here, I heard that the Qiuhong Market required people to team up to break through the formation. Is this place really that dangerous? The Qiuhong Market has been out for a while now. Haven't you found a safe path yet? I am a casual cultivator with few friends. It will be difficult to find trustworthy helpers in a hurry."</p><p>The owner smiled, "Actually, if Daoist priest Qingfeng stays in Western Wasteland Town for two more days, you will know once you ask around.</p><p>The defensive array of Qiuhong Marketplace is subject to constant change, rotating in cycles through four arrays of earth, water, fire, and wind. As the laws of yin and yang govern these changes, there is no such thing as a safe path. However, everyone has gained some understanding of the array's patterns, and as long as helpers can assist each other, the danger can be significantly reduced. Success or failure is dependent on mutual support, so the Daoist Master need not worry about anyone playing tricks. However, if mutual trust cannot be established, there will be chaos after the group enters.</p><p>"Many thanks for the Daoist friend's guidance." Qin Sang was suddenly enlightened and bowed his hands in gratitude. "In that case, there should be people recruiting companions in the city, right? Does the Daoist friend have any information? Could you give this poor Daoist some guidance?"</p><p>"The Daoist Master has guessed correctly. Indeed, there are many people recruiting helpers. Some even charge Spirit Stones and blatantly collect wealth under the banner of a guaranteed passage through the array. These people are a mixed bag, so the Daoist Master should not trust them. In addition, there are several seniors of extremely high cultivation who would be extremely reliable should the Daoist Master be able to join their team, but..."</p><p>The shopkeeper stroked his long beard and glanced at Qin Sang, hesitating to speak.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head without showing any sign of concern and asked frankly, "The Daoist friend need not spare my feelings; this poor Daoist knows his own limitations. Is it because my cultivation is low, and people look down on me?"</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of hiding his cultivation with the Spirit Concealing Technique. His goal was to infiltrate another group and demonstrate his strength.</p><p>The shopkeeper chuckled.</p><p>"The Daoist Master is a straightforward person!</p><p>You and I both understand that high cultivation does not necessarily mean great ability, but cultivation is indeed the most intuitive indicator. It is not reasonable to expect people to reveal all their hidden skills, so it is understandable that they have this requirement.</p><p>Other than them, there are other options that are not so strict with their strength requirements.</p><p>However, as the Daoist Master is unwilling to continue cooperating after entering the marketplace, there are very few places to choose from.</p><p>The Daoist Master may not be aware, but all the easily accessible places in Qiuhong Marketplace have basically been visited. Wandering around such places will unlikely yield satisfactory results, making it a wasted trip.</p><p>However, the important places require cooperation to enter, so many people are looking for more than just companions to break the array.</p><p>If I may say so, I do know of one place that meets the Daoist Master's requirements. If the Daoist Master trusts me, I can introduce you."</p><p>Here it comes.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. This was the reason he had come to this teahouse.</p><p>Yun Youzi and the others had discovered that the teahouse owner had an unusual relationship with his target, Yu Kong.</p><p>Chapter 278 Western Desert Town</p><p>Western Desert Town.</p><p>This town is completely exposed to the sunlight and windblown sand, and its grand formation is only activated when celestial phenomena strike.</p><p>The north wind howled, and yellow sand swirled.</p><p>Amidst the dim, sandy dust, a figure appeared faintly, slowly walking towards the town.</p><p>Despite the massive sandstorm, this person wasn't hurried at all, strolling leisurely as if in a courtyard.  Any mortal witnessing this would be astonished. But in Western Desert Town, this was perfectly normal.  Mortals could hardly reach such a remote place; only cultivators came and went here.</p><p>For cultivators, a sandstorm of this magnitude was no different from a tickle. What they truly feared were the celestial phenomena that followed.</p><p>The Daoist emerged from the sandstorm, yet his attire remained remarkably clean. His brand-new Daoist robe was without a single crease, and whenever sand landed on it, it was repelled by a faint green light.</p><p>The Daoist didn't appear old, but his demeanor was quite composed, suggesting his true age was likely older than his appearance suggested.</p><p>By this time, the people of Western Desert Town had become accustomed to unfamiliar visitors. They casually glanced at the Daoist before losing interest.</p><p>"The celestial phenomena are occurring more and more frequently."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the town's stone-paved road, paused, and sighed inwardly, recalling what Yun Youzi had said about the approaching Spirit Tide.</p><p>Once the Spirit Tide arrived, neither immortal caves nor secret realms would be of any use to Qin Sang. His current strength wouldn't allow him to wander freely amidst the Spirit Tide.  The best course of action was to seclude himself outside the grand pass and cultivate diligently until the Spirit Tide subsided.</p><p>However, as the Spirit Tide drew nearer, influenced by its power, the environment of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would become increasingly hostile and more challenging to navigate. This was a matter of vital importance to everyone.</p><p>Human effort had its limits.  Qin Sang couldn't do anything about it, only hoping that the Spirit Tide wouldn't arrive too soon.</p><p>Qin Sang brushed off non-existent dust from his robe and squinted at the desolate town.</p><p>He and Yun Youzi had parted ways a month ago. Yun Youzi had arrived in Western Desert Town ten days ahead of him and hadn't contacted him since.  Qin Sang wondered if he had successfully infiltrated the target group.</p><p>The scale of Western Desert Town exceeded Qin Sang's expectations. Both its size and population were the largest he had encountered in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Despite the raging sandstorm, numerous figures could still be seen on the streets, most likely drawn by the Autumn Wild Goose Market.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't see Yun Youzi. Recalling Yun Youzi's instructions before their separation, his gaze shifted, settling on the northeast corner of the town.</p><p>There stood a wooden building with a high-hanging banner – a teahouse.</p><p>…</p><p>"You look unfamiliar, Daoist.  I don't believe we've met. May I inquire as to your Daoist title?"</p><p>The teahouse owner personally came to refill Qin Sang's tea, observing him discreetly.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze, which had been wandering the streets, returned. He looked up at the owner, cupped his hands in greeting, and said, "Greetings, fellow Daoist. You have a keen eye.  Indeed, this is my first time in Western Desert Town. My Daoist title is Qing Feng."</p><p>The owner was surprisingly also a Foundation Establishment cultivator. However, judging by his age, he had likely given up on pursuing immortality, choosing instead to spend his remaining years running a teahouse in this town.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng braved the sandstorm to come to Western Desert Town.  Are you here for the Autumn Wild Goose Market as well?" The owner asked directly.</p><p>"Most people are, I imagine."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and gestured towards the people hurrying along the streets.  Not only were there Foundation Establishment cultivators, but even Qi Refining cultivators.</p><p>Even Foundation Establishment cultivators faced certain risks entering the Autumn Wild Goose Market.  The dangers faced by Qi Refining cultivators were even greater. They might not even survive the journey to the market, let alone breach its formations.</p><p>But fortune favored the bold, and the world never lacked daring individuals.</p><p>The owner nodded. Seeing Qin Sang's willingness to converse, he sat down and began to chat as if making idle conversation. "How much do you know about the Autumn Wild Goose Market, Daoist Qing Feng? Coming here alone, without companions, you might need to find some help. Otherwise, it might be difficult for you to breach the market's protective formation by yourself."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang set down his teacup, leaned forward slightly, and feigned confusion.  "I've heard along the way that one needs companions to breach the formation of the Autumn Wild Goose Market. Is it truly that dangerous?  The Autumn Wild Goose Market has been open for a while now, hasn't it?  Has no one found a safe path?  I am a rogue cultivator, with few friends. The help I find in such haste may be untrustworthy."</p><p>The owner smiled. "If Daoist Qing Feng stays in Western Desert Town for a couple of days and makes some inquiries, you'll find out."</p><p>The protective formation around Autumnfall Market isn't static. It cycles through earth, water, fire, and wind elements, interwoven with yin and yang transformations. There's no single safe path. However, people have figured out some patterns.  As long as you find allies to support each other, the danger significantly decreases. Everyone succeeds or fails together within the formation, so you don't need to worry about sabotage. If mutual trust isn't possible, everyone can simply go their separate ways once inside.</p><p>“Thank you for the guidance,” Qin Sang said, appearing suddenly enlightened. He cupped his hands in gratitude. “In that case, there must be people in the city recruiting companions? Do you happen to know anything about this? Could you offer me some pointers?”</p><p>“You’re right. Quite a few are recruiting. Some even claim a guaranteed passage through the formation for a spirit stone fee, essentially extorting money.  These people are a mixed bag; it's best not to trust them.  There are also a few highly cultivated seniors. Joining their teams would be the safest option, but…”  The teahouse owner stroked his beard, glancing at Qin Sang, his words trailing off.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head nonchalantly, asking frankly, “You needn't spare my feelings. I'm self-aware. Is it because my cultivation level is too low for them?”  He wanted to blend into a team, so he hadn't bothered concealing his cultivation level with the Spirit Concealment Technique.</p><p>The owner laughed heartily.</p><p>“You’re a straightforward man! We both know high cultivation doesn't necessarily equal great skill, but it's the most obvious indicator. You can't expect people to reveal all their trump cards, and it's reasonable for them to have such requirements. Besides them, there are other options that aren't as stringent about cultivation level. However, since you don't want to continue cooperating once inside the market, your choices are limited. You might not know this, but the easily accessible areas within Autumnfall Market have mostly been picked clean.  Lingering in those places rarely yields worthwhile treasures.  It's practically a wasted trip. The more valuable locations, however, require teamwork to access. That’s why many people are looking for more than just companions to navigate the formation. As for options that suit your requirements, I do know of one. If you trust me, I can make an introduction.”</p><p>This was it. Qin Sang's heart stirred. This was precisely why he'd come to this teahouse.  Cloud Wanderer and his companion had discovered that the teahouse owner had close ties to his target, Yu Kong.</p>
