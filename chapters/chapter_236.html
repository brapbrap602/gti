Chapter 229: Breaking the Ban

In the flowing light Qin Sang and the others had previously obtained, not only included the operation method for the Nine Effulgent Galaxy Formation, but also the method for the Reverse Formation and reversing the flow of the galaxy.

This time, one end of the galaxy plunged into the black hole. The people at the forefront had already stepped into the black hole with one foot. Just as they were about to enter the black hole and touch the stone tablet, it was unknown why Che Yutao ordered them to quit.

However, everyone did not dare to disobey. Upon hearing the order, they reversed the formation without hesitation.

In that patch of the galaxy, countless stars were originally operating according to a certain rule. At this moment, the galaxy abruptly stopped, and then all the stars suddenly began to operate in reverse.

Throughout the starry sky, numerous meteors slid past, obeying the previously operating route, flowing in reverse, as if time was rewinding.

‘Buzz!’

The galaxy reversed, not attacking the black hole, but forcefully ‘pulled’ out of the black hole.

Waves of fluctuation were transmitted from within the black hole, constantly changing. Fortunately, no black light shot out. Finally, after the galaxy separated, it gradually returned to calm.

Everyone could not help but breathe a sigh of relief. They continued to maintain the galaxy and waited for the next order. However, they saw that Che Yutao and the others ignored them but instead looked at Sikong Muyue with a hint of anticipation.

Sikong Muyue floated in the air, free of dust and with an air of cold elegance. From the moment the galaxy came into contact with the black hole, Sikong Muyue had closed her eyes. Her divine consciousness enveloped the black hole, exploring every change within the black hole.

The galaxy retreated and the black hole gradually disappeared, but Sikong Muyue still did not wake up. She was still attentively analyzing the black hole restrictions.

A full quarter of an hour passed before Sikong Muyue suddenly opened her eyes. Stars appeared and disappeared within her eyes. Her黛眉 slightly wrinkled, and her expression was thoughtful as she looked at the black hole. Then, she lightly said: “Enter again.”

Qin Sang and the others immediately obeyed the order. After going through the previous incident, they were already familiar with the process and were well-prepared. Not long after entering, they heard the order to reverse the formation and immediately did so.

Just like that, they entered and exited three times continuously.

Sikong Muyue’s brows finally relaxed. She pondered for a moment, and a stream of light shot out from her fingertip again, flying towards the crowd.

Qin Sang saw the content in the flowing light clearly. He discovered that it was still the Nine Effulgent Galaxy Formation, but it had a slight difference compared to before. It could be seen that Sikong Muyue had modified the formation based on the changes in the restriction.

Qin Sang was amazed by Sikong Muyue’s powerful abilities and devoted himself to learning.

With the previous foundation, it was much easier to comprehend this time. In less than a quarter of an hour, everyone had comprehended the formation and then set up the Galaxy Formation according to the new formation.

On the surface, the dazzling galaxy did not seem to have changed much, but only those in the formation could sense the subtle difference. Some positions had stronger defense, while others were weakened.

Just as everyone was about to combine the three galaxies, Sikong Muyue suddenly said: “This time, there is no need to superimpose the formation. Only nine people need to enter…”

As she spoke, Sikong Muyue’s gaze swept across, seemingly pointing at random.

“You guys can go first.”

The direction she pointed to was precisely the team where Cloudswanderer was, and besides Cloudswanderer, there were three other Daoist Alchemy Sect disciples.

Seeing that Sikong Muyue had ordered her disciples to scout the way, the others naturally did not have any objections. Cloudswanderer and the others slowly moved forward, approaching the black hole.

Qin Sang noticed that when they approached the black hole, Sikong Muyue, Earthgap, and Reverend Xuanyu’s lips moved slightly, as if they were transmitting a voice message.

It seemed that these Nascent Soul cultivators did have a certain understanding of the ancient cultivator’s legacy. After entering, they would not be completely clueless.

Qin Sang felt slightly relieved. He knew that when his turn came to enter, Che Yutao would definitely give some instructions, so he would not let his disciples die in vain.

In the blink of an eye, Cloudswanderer and the others had come into contact with the black hole. The moment the galaxy entered the black hole, Sikong Muyue made them reverse the formation again.

Unexpectedly, the galaxy after the reversal failed to break free from the black hole’s束缚 and was instantly sucked in.

The black hole was like a huge black mouth that swallowed them in one gulp. As Cloudswanderer and the others encountered a strange and powerful suction force, they were even unable to maintain the formation when they were sucked into the black hole.

The galaxy suddenly dissipated, and the nine people seemed to have become lonely boats in the mighty waves, swept up by the hurricane. They were powerless to resist and randomly crashed into the stone tablet in the chaos.

However, the moment they came into contact with the stone tablet, the expected collision did not occur. A black vortex suddenly appeared on the mottled stone tablet, directly sucking them in.

In an instant, all nine people disappeared without a trace. There was only a stone tablet standing in the black hole, and it gradually disappeared.

Seeing this strange scene, the expressions of the others outside all turned slightly pale. No one knew what was inside the stone tablet and what dangers they would encounter after entering.

The unknown was the most terrifying thing.

Unexpectedly, Che Yutao and the others were overjoyed. They cupped their hands towards Sikong Muyue and admired: “Fellow Daoist Sikong’s attainments in the Dao of Restrictions are truly extraordinary. With just a slight modification to the formation, you can achieve such an effect.”

With no joy on her face, Sigong Muyue sighed and said, "It's really because my ability is insufficient... If it was a friend from the Mystic Mirage Sect, it would not have taken so long. What's more, if nine people form an array, they will certainly be able to break free from it."

Upon hearing this, Che Yu Tao smiled and said, "The Mystic Mirage Sect is renowned for its array formations. It naturally has its unique characteristics. Fellow Daoist Sigong, there is no need to be humble. In such a short time, you were able to figure out the changes of the restriction. It's already very difficult to achieve... Next, will you allow those three to try?"

"Hold on!"

Sigong Muyue lightly shook her head. "Let's separate out nine more people to try. I have some ideas that need to be verified."

Che Yu Tao nodded. He turned around and looked at the crowd with shimmering eyes and uneasy expressions. Che Yu Tao let out a laugh mixed with a scolding tone. "This stone tablet is the entrance to the ancient cultivator's secret repository. Others are trying to enter but can't. What are you afraid of?"

Only then did the crowd feel relieved. Another nine people entered the black hole. Just like before, they were unable to break free from its bounds and were sucked into the stone tablet.

In this way, only Qin Sang and the other eight remained. Sigong Muyue then released a stream of light and altered the array.

In the end, Qin Sang and the others transformed into a galaxy and came into contact with the black hole. During the reversal of the array, although it caused the array to come close to dissipating, they unexpectedly struggled free from the suction force of the black hole.

"Good!"

Sigong Muyue's eyes lit up. "Now, let's change it to three people to try."

At this moment, another new array formation appeared in Qin Sang and the others' minds. It was also an alteration made to the Nine Luminaries Galaxy Array. However, it unexpectedly only required three people. Each person occupied three positions in the array and could form an array.

However, the strength of the new array was much weaker. As soon as the first batch of three people came into contact with the black hole, the array immediately dissipated. They almost turned into mush under the pressure of the powerful restriction. Fortunately, they were rescued by a few Nascent Soul Formation cultivators working together.

This was also the first time Qin Sang truly felt the strength of the restriction. He was greatly shocked and secretly thought that it was no wonder these Nascent Soul Formation cultivators were so cautious.

After several failed attempts, Sigong Muyue's expression did not change. She calmly said, "Give me some time and I can alter it again. Three people will then be able to break the restriction. However, there isn't enough time now. What we have is enough for us. Let these youngsters go inside."
