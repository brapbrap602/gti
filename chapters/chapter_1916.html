<h1>Chapter 1907: Entering the World</h1><p>Zhu Que entered the cave and flew to the stone bed opposite Qin Sang.  She extended a small claw, touched the forehead of the Wu Xing Mian spirit, then landed on the spirit's arm, tilting her head to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>"When will she wake up?"</p><p>"Soon."</p><p>Qin Sang also looked at the Wu Xing Mian spirit, recalling the spirit's changes over the years.</p><p>For all these years, there hadn't been many opportunities to fight with others, so Qin Sang hadn't interfered much, letting the spirit suppress the demonic energy on its own.</p><p>Now, the spirit appeared as a cute little girl in a black dress, exquisitely beautiful and endearing.</p><p>She lay quietly on the stone bed, her eyes closed, her little mouth red and plump like a flower, her small hands lying flat at her sides, her fingers slightly curled. Her skin was as white and tender as her face.</p><p>She looked like a normal little girl, fast asleep and harmless.</p><p>Anyone seeing this little girl wouldn't associate her with a demon.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew very well that although three hundred years had passed and almost no demonic energy could be felt on the spirit, demonic intent remained deeply rooted within her, like a malignant tumor, incurable.</p><p>Suddenly, a ball of black flame appeared between Qin Sang and Zhu Que, transforming into a fire lotus suspended in mid-air.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred slightly, and the lotus petals opened one by one, revealing the 'lotus seed' at the heart of the lotus.</p><p>Because of this Qilin primal seed, Qin Sang still couldn't fully utilize his spiritual sense.  Subtly, the Qilin primal seed had also undergone significant changes.</p><p>Before, the Qilin primal seed only had a faint fluctuation, and it was rapidly weakening.</p><p>When Qin Sang followed Zhu Que's method and changed his strategy for extracting the seed's essence, the Qilin spirit stabilized and began to gradually strengthen.</p><p>Now, he could clearly feel the fluctuation within the Qilin primal seed – a life fluctuation.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed they might be reaching a critical point, but he wasn't sure, so he asked Zhu Que's opinion.</p><p>Zhu Que spread her wings and flew around the fire lotus, tapping the fire lotus and then the Qilin primal seed with her small claw before landing on Qin Sang's shoulder.  She answered irrelevantly, "Do you think… Qilins lay eggs?"</p><p>What kind of question was that?</p><p>Qin Sang found that this Zhu Que's thoughts were becoming increasingly whimsical.</p><p>Were the things this bird had taught him reliable?  Wouldn't it end up resurrecting the Qilin itself?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but look at Zhu Que with suspicion, "Legend says there are five types of insects in the world, three hundred and sixty hairy insects, and the Qilin is the longest."</p><p>"Can't hairy insects lay eggs?"</p><p>Zhu Que scoffed, "I think you might need to hatch an egg. When it hatches, it will be the day the Qilin is reborn."</p><p>"You think so?"</p><p>Qin Sang was increasingly uneasy about this bird.</p><p>He stared at the Qilin primal seed, recalling his feelings over the years and the changes in the Qilin spirit's fluctuations.</p><p>Apart from following Zhu Que's instructions, he didn't seem to have a better way.</p><p>"Fine," Qin Sang shook his head slightly, "Let's do it your way. If we can't find the Qilin's original essence in the end, it's not my fault. Anyway, your body has already recovered, you don't need the Qilin's primal essence anymore."</p><p>"I knew you were up to no good!"</p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Que suddenly flew into a rage, shouting loudly, "If you dare to keep my half, I'll fight you!"</p><p>The enraged Zhu Que even stretched out her claws, trying to scratch Qin Sang, but the difference in strength was too great.  An invisible force restrained her in place, leaving her only able to scratch the air.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored her, activating the fire lotus and taking the Qilin primal seed into its heart. The lotus petals closed one by one.</p><p>Strands of Jiu You demonic fire separated from the fire lotus and, under Qin Sang's mental control, formed strange patterns. Some merged into the lotus heart, others fused with the lotus petals, adding a touch of beauty to the fire lotus.</p><p>By the time Qin Sang finished, Zhu Que had calmed down.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the fire lotus and took Zhu Que to the copper pillar space down the mountain, asking, "Is it all set up there?"</p><p>Zhu Que was still angry and turned her head away without answering.</p><p>Inside the copper pillar space, besides the copper pillar, several glowing orbs floated, each a different color.</p><p>These were the Gray Ying Sword, the Four-Riding Serpent Seal, the Ming Shan Armor, the Blood Sword, and other items.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had asked Zhu Que to modify the copper pillar space. Although Zhu Que's cultivation was not high, her ability to manipulate flames was unparalleled in Qin Sang's experience.  It was an innate ability, as if she was born the master of all flames, something others could only envy.</p><p>Because of this ability, many things could be left to her, saving Qin Sang a lot of effort.</p><p>The space already had the basic structure of a fire chamber.</p><p>"Very good!"</p><p>Qin Sang offered his praise without reservation.</p><p>Hearing the praise, Zhu Que snorted and reluctantly turned her head.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to transform this place into a forge, not an ordinary one, but a place to forge his own sword.  He wouldn't simply craft the Grey Warbler Sword into an ordinary magical artifact; it had to be perfect.  Furthermore, the Four-Wheeled Serpent Seal and other treasures could be further refined using the Chongxuan Sect's secret techniques to enhance their power and quality.</p><p>"Let's begin!"</p><p>Qin Sang spread his arms, and the flames within the space suddenly became violent. Zhu Que dove into the fiery sea, and the raging flames were now restrained, allowing Qin Sang to work without worry. He manipulated the flames, wave after wave, the tremors spreading from the bronze pillar chamber to the outside world.</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The stone peak in the lake's center shook.  The lava lake also surged violently.</p><p>Luo Hou was training his fire spirits before the mountain. Sensing the disturbance, the fire spirits showed signs of unease.</p><p>"You, lead a squad east!"</p><p>...</p><p>"Anyone who dares approach here, kill without mercy!"</p><p>Luo Hou deployed all the demon soldiers from his training ground to patrol the area. The demon soldiers were highly disciplined and obeyed orders instantly, forming a formidable force.</p><p>The tremors continued until dawn several days later.  The sun rose amidst the fiery glow that reached the sky.  The bronze pillar chamber returned to calm; the scene had transformed.  The flames had turned into fire dragons, one end connected to the underground magma veins, the other coiled around the bronze pillar.  All the fiery energy converged at the top of the pillar.  The light there was extremely deep, yet the aura was incredibly subtle, appearing as a calm flame—Qin Sang's "forge," created using the Chongxuan Sect's secret techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged at the edge, summoned the Grey Warbler Sword, drew out his blood essence, and refined it using secret techniques. He repeated this process several times, leaving the treasures within the forge to be tempered.</p><p>After completing all this, even with Qin Sang's cultivated physique, he felt drained.</p><p>Over three hundred years, his progress in the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique had been slow. While improvements were readily achievable, he'd commissioned the Cloud Tripod City lord to collect potent poisons. Unfortunately, the poison beads were destroyed, although he could still use the techniques in the *Poison God Scripture* for body refinement, it wasn't as reckless as before. Reaching the peak of the fifth transformation and breaking through to the sixth would require significant time for comprehension.</p><p>With so much to do, he had to prioritize tasks, one by one.</p><p>Returning to his cave, Qin Sang pushed open the door, his expression shifting slightly as he looked at the spirit on the stone bed.</p><p>"Wow! She's awake!"</p><p>Zhu Que also noticed, its cry filled with surprise as it rushed into the cave.</p><p>The spirit's long lashes fluttered, her eyelids slowly opening to reveal eyes as black as ink. These eyes were like deep pools, penetrating and bottomless.  The spirit's eyes reflected Zhu Que's surprised expression.</p><p>Upon seeing her eyes, Zhu Que felt a chill, its whole body stiffening; it couldn't help but shiver, darting behind Qin Sang, pointing at the spirit and stammering, "Sh-sh-she..."</p><p>Qin Sang also saw the spirit's eyes.  These were eyes that could draw one's soul in, as if they were a boundless demonic realm, inescapable once entered.  Her black dress didn't diminish this feeling, but intensified it.</p><p>Anyone who saw these eyes wouldn't find the spirit cute; instead, they'd cry out "witch," "demon child," even if she did nothing.</p><p>When she first awakened, the spirit's gaze was vacant, gradually becoming confused, like a newborn infant seeing the world for the first time.  She first saw Zhu Que, her attention captivated by it, her head turning with it in somewhat stiff movements. Then she saw Qin Sang standing at the entrance.</p><p>Something about Qin Sang seemed to draw her in; the spirit stared intently at him, without blinking.  Perhaps inspired by Qin Sang's posture, the spirit moved her arms, her small hands groping to support herself on the stone bed, pushing herself up, then slowly standing on the bed.  Throughout this process, the spirit's eyes remained fixed on Qin Sang, her confusion laced with a hint of curiosity.</p><p>The atmosphere in the cave was strange. Qin Sang and the spirit faced each other, their eyes locked, neither speaking. The spirit was silently observing Qin Sang, and Qin Sang was studying the spirit.</p><p>The spirit's expression lessened the power of her demonic eyes.</p><p>Zhu Que's courage grew, peeking out from behind Qin Sang's neck, cautiously flying towards the spirit. The spirit's attention shifted again to Zhu Que, tilting her small face to observe it.</p><p>"Hey there, little one! I, Zhuque, am your master.  Say 'master' for me!"</p><p>Zhuque, seeing the spirit's dazed expression, grew bolder, chattering away excitedly.</p><p>"...Mas...ter..."</p><p>The spirit seemed to understand Zhuque's meaning. Its small mouth opened slightly, repeating the two words slowly and stiffly.  It seemed to be pondering their meaning, but its gaze drifted to Qin Sang, filled with bewilderment, confusion, and questioning.  It simply stared at him.</p><p>Zhuque, seeing no easy victory, hung its head and sighed.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown had been with Qin Sang for many years, bearing his imprint.  Only Qin Sang was worthy of being its master. That's why the spirit reacted this way.</p><p>Though both are spirits, this little girl and the Kun Dao from Di Shou Mountain only share similar features; their temperament, demeanor, and intellect are completely different.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the bedside and gently stroked the spirit's small head.</p><p>The spirit didn't dodge or attack, allowing Qin Sang to rub its hair.  It tilted its head slightly, its dark eyes fixed on Qin Sang, as if trying to imprint his face on its memory.</p><p>"From now on, your name will be Xiao Wu."</p><p>Qin Sang said softly.</p><p>"I...am...Xiao Wu..."</p><p>The spirit spoke more smoothly, slowly closing its eyes and leaning into Qin Sang's hand, seemingly enjoying the touch.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected it to be so easy.  The spirit awoke and immediately accepted him as its master.</p><p>Looking at the docile Xiao Wu, he felt he hadn't acquired a spirit, but a daughter.</p><p>"Hey! Xiao Wu, I'm the one who kept you company while you slept!"</p><p>Zhuque hopped around, wanting to rub Xiao Wu's head too, but hesitated.  It knew the power of the Five Elements Crown, fearing that Xiao Wu might unleash the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light in displeasure, causing it to vanish.</p><p>Xiao Wu opened her eyes again.  While there was no hostility towards Zhuque, her expression lacked the warmth she showed towards Qin Sang.  Instead, she had a cold, aloof aura that was intimidating.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up Xiao Wu and sat down at a stone table to the side of the cave dwelling, seating Xiao Wu opposite him.</p><p>Xiao Wu imitated Qin Sang, sitting upright on the stone bench.</p><p>"High intelligence, but lacking worldly experience..."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.  But upon seeing those eyes looking at him, he reconsidered his assessment.</p><p>"No, her expressions have been remarkably subdued since waking up.  She hasn't even smiled, even when facing me. Those eyes clearly show that the demonic influence within her hasn't dissipated.  If I weren't here, could she maintain this composure?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, Xiao Wu watching him silently and motionless.</p><p>"How can I dispel the demonic influence within Xiao Wu?"</p><p>Qin Sang found the problem far more difficult than he imagined.  Waiting for it to fade on its own seemed impossible.  What could he do?</p><p>"Demonic influence... demonic influence..."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted as something occurred to him.</p><p>Perhaps there was more than one way to remove the demonic influence!</p><p>There has always been debate in the world about human nature – are people born good or evil? This leads to the theories of innate goodness and innate wickedness.</p><p>Isn't a newly awakened spirit like an infant with an inherently demonic nature?</p><p>Regardless of whether one believes in innate goodness or wickedness, both acknowledge the importance of nurture.  Future development will determine whether a person becomes good or evil.</p><p>As the saying goes, experiencing the world, understanding reason, and knowing good and evil...</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and he remembered his own cultivation.</p><p>Upon learning the origin of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, Qin Sang felt the name didn't suit the majesty of the Purple Micro Emperor.  Since the sword spirit called the sword scripture nameless, he boldly renamed it the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture*.</p><p>The twelfth layer of the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture*—the key to enlightenment lies in killing those who deserve to be killed!</p><p>For years, Qin Sang had pondered the meaning of this phrase.</p><p>Who deserves to be killed?</p><p>For Qin Sang, it was those who had wronged him, but this was no different for a Nascent Soul cultivator; the sword spirit needn't have specifically mentioned it.</p><p>But what if he broadened his perspective beyond himself and looked at the world?</p><p>Perfected cultivators seek harmony between heaven and man.  The vastness of heaven, the immensity of the earth, the profundity of the Dao—how can one limit their pursuit of the Dao to oneself?</p><p>Some say the Dao is impartial.</p><p>Yet people have seven emotions and six desires. No one can ascend to enlightenment overnight. Enlightenment must begin with oneself.</p><p>For the people of the world, who deserves to be killed?</p><p>Those who mercilessly slaughter the innocent and act wickedly!</p><p>How likely is it that a killer stained with blood, upon sudden enlightenment, would become a righteous knight devoted to upholding justice?</p><p>Looking at the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture*, from the Golden Core stage, condensing killing talismans through slaughter, to the confusion of the Yuan Ying stage, and finally to the sheathing of the sword in the Transformation stage, drawing the sword only with cause...</p><p>It seems to make sense.</p><p>To stop killing with killing, is also a path of killing!</p><p>Qin Sang remembered legends from various mythological tales, where immortals and Buddhas sent down incarnations to the mortal world for worldly experience and cultivation.</p><p>Perhaps, he too should wander the mortal realm.</p><p>(End)</p>
