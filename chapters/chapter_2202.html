<h1>Chapter 2192: Missed Opportunity</h1><p>The monstrous beast slept soundly, its snoring echoing like thunder.  Saliva pooled on the stone beneath it, a strange look of contentment on its grotesque face; it seemed lost in a blissful dream, utterly lacking in vigilance.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were incredibly close, easily able to kill it, yet it remained unresponsive. Even when Qin Sang unleashed his sword intent, threatening its vital points, the beast remained oblivious. This wasn't sleep; it was clearly in a coma.</p><p>Qin Sang set up several restrictive talismans to prevent the beast's sudden awakening, then used his spiritual sense to examine the beast's body, finding nothing.</p><p>The monstrous beast was perfectly normal, without a single wound, its breath even, its spirit intact, just…unawakening.</p><p>What kind of power could incapacitate a Nascent Soul-level beast so completely, without any resistance?</p><p>The news they’d heard from Hong Yue wasn’t an exaggeration.  Seeing it firsthand was truly terrifying.</p><p>“Ten days!”</p><p>Qin Sang breathed out softly.</p><p>Whether the jade Buddha could withstand that power or not, they had to get out within ten days.</p><p>Many things needed doing in those ten days: kill the Immortal Child, find the hidden realm, and complete the task set by the Saint-level cultivator.</p><p>Both felt the urgency and immediately killed the beast.  The chilling thing was that the beast offered no resistance, dying in its sleep.</p><p>Obtaining the beast’s body without effort only deepened their worry. They silently flew onward.</p><p>Liuli’s escape technique was inferior to Qin Sang’s. To prepare traps in advance, they temporarily separated, Qin Sang going ahead to reach the hidden realm as quickly as possible.</p><p>A bolt of lightning zipped through the spiritual mist.  After covering a considerable distance without pause, Qin Sang finally arrived at the location marked on the map.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, then his expression changed.  He flew several miles further and saw a chasm before him.</p><p>A rumbling sound of water.</p><p>The chasm was only thirty feet wide, stretching endlessly in both directions. Below seemed a bottomless pit, with lake water continuously pouring from both sides, never filling the chasm.</p><p>This was the place Qin Sang sought. The hidden realm lay beneath the chasm, but its position had shifted.</p><p>Using his spiritual sense, Qin Sang detected fluctuating energy emanating from the depths of the chasm, his heart easing slightly. It seemed the hidden realm hadn’t been destroyed.</p><p>He’d chosen this location for an ambush because the hidden realm was permeated with a power targeting the primordial spirit, along with dangerous ancient restrictions. Ordinary people would fear it like a tiger. The jade Buddha might be able to block that power, so Qin Sang naturally wanted to utilize his advantage.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang plunged into the lake.</p><p>After working within the hidden realm, Qin Sang flew out of the chasm and saw Liuli had also arrived safely.</p><p>“How is it?” Liuli asked.</p><p>“The hidden realm is still there. There’s an ancient spirit array that’s still usable,” Qin Sang said lightly.</p><p>It seemed their plan had worked.</p><p>However, this was just the first step. The problem was how to lure their enemy into a trap.  Manipulating cultivators of this level was no easy feat.  Unfortunately, Qin Sang didn't know the Immortal Child's personality or cultivation techniques, otherwise he could set more targeted traps.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. The Immortal Child was still absent, their ambush location unknown.</p><p>Recalling the map, while the Heart Lake didn't have clear inner and outer lake divisions, one could roughly divide an outer perimeter based on the distribution and danger level of the hidden realm’s ruins.</p><p>Now that the Heart Lake had changed, if he were in the Immortal Child's shoes, he would choose to attack outside, as the deeper they went, the more unpredictable things became, unless one knew the Heart Lake intimately.</p><p>Qin Sang mentally drew a line between the inner and outer lake areas, concluding the Immortal Child was most likely to strike outside.</p><p>Then Qin Sang and Liuli slowed down and continued forward.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Immortal Child and his two companions were on their way. Worried that Qin Sang had gone into the depths of the Heart Lake, they used their escape techniques to the fullest, flying through the air.</p><p>However, these routes had been carefully calculated and chosen by Qin Sang. Even if the Immortal Child's escape technique was equal to his own, they wouldn't arrive before him and Liuli.</p><p>“Qi, has Fairy Ping responded?” The Immortal Child turned to the cloaked cultivator and asked.</p><p>“The message talisman was only sent recently. It won't be that quick. To be frank, younger brother, your eagerness for revenge is clouding your judgment. The three of us working together are more than enough to deal with that Qin Zhenren.  If we invite Fairy Ping, even if Qin Zhenren is incredibly powerful, he won't be able to escape our grasp!”</p><p>The cloaked cultivator said solemnly.</p><p>The clan leader left Yuan Jian, Yuan Ren, and Qin Sang to take a different route. While there were seemingly reasonable explanations, and it couldn't be confirmed if the danger was anticipated and deliberately aimed at them, the signs were enough to raise their suspicions.  Furthermore, when Xian Tong pursued another group of enemies, one person went missing and was last seen entering an ancient formation, never to be seen again, dead or alive. If that person escaped, they would certainly warn Qin Zhenren.</p><p>Worried about Qin Sang's potential schemes, and to ensure success, Xian Tong, at great cost, invited others to help.  The promised rewards for the others remained unchanged; more help meant an easier task for everyone, so they readily agreed.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xian Tong's face hardened, and he remained silent.</p><p>Suddenly, three streaks of light abruptly stopped.  Three figures materialized, their expressions changing as they sensed something and looked towards the heart of the lake.</p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p>A gleam flashed in the black-robed cultivator's eyes.</p><p>The man in green licked his lips and said to Xian Tong, "Daoist Si, we may need to alter our plans."</p><p>Xian Tong's expression shifted between anger and uncertainty.  He said resentfully, "You both promised me..."</p><p>He was cut off by the black-robed cultivator.  "Brother, have you forgotten the Ancestor's instructions?  Ordinarily, we would fully support you in killing your enemies, but now that omens appear, other matters must be set aside. Otherwise, who could bear the Ancestor's wrath? I advise you, brother, not to let hatred cloud your judgment and lose the bigger picture for the sake of a small matter!"</p><p>The man in green chuckled. "Killing that Qin Zhenren isn't difficult.  Before this upheaval ends, can he leave the sacred land? We can simply deal with him upon his return! Daoist Si, if you remain obstinate, we can only apologize."</p><p>Seeing their resolve, Xian Tong had no choice. These two were close associates of other Elder members of the different alien races, their status not inferior to his.  Their reasoning was sound; failing the greater mission due to personal revenge would be inexcusable to the Ancestors.</p><p>Moments later, the three changed direction and flew towards the heart of the lake.</p><p>Unaware, Qin Sang and Liuli continued their pretense, waiting for the enemy to appear.  Qin Sang had already awakened the Sky-Eye Butterfly, maintaining vigilance.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Instead of Xian Tong, Qin Sang felt an unusual fluctuation from the talisman in his sleeve.  They had been brought here by the talisman, then blocked by Hong Tian. After Hong Tian brought them inside, the talisman fell silent, seemingly shielded by some unseen force.  Initially, he suspected Hong Tian was behind it.</p><p>Pausing, Qin Sang took out the talisman and saw its light fading. The fluctuation had been momentary, too fleeting to sense before it subsided.</p><p>Liuli looked over curiously.</p><p>"The talisman just glowed briefly, for some reason," Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>The fluctuation seemed to hint at something, but it was too vague. The lake was vast; pinpointing its origin was impossible.</p><p>"Did the alien race ancestors leave this item anticipating the current trouble?"  A question lingered in Liuli's mind.</p><p>This was exactly what Qin Sang wondered. No one knew how long the alien race's sacred land had existed, yet it seemed to foresee this upheaval. Were the ancestors skilled in divination?</p><p>If they had foreseen this, why not avoid it?  Was this trouble deliberately provoked by the ancestors? If so, surely they wouldn't send their descendants to die?  Perhaps they needed their help, or maybe it wasn't as dangerous as imagined, even potentially offering great opportunities.</p><p>Of course, these were mere speculations.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the talisman repeatedly, but once its light completely vanished, no clues remained.</p><p>After this small incident, they proceeded with their plan.  However, upon reaching their destination, Xian Tong was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Looking at the empty lake, Qin Sang was surprised and pondered whether Xian Tong didn't know they entered the sacred lake, or if his plan was too obvious and Xian Tong sensed danger.</p><p>Xian Tong and the Grand Deacon seemed close.  Logically, even if Xian Tong noticed them, he wouldn't easily give up revenge against him and the early Nascent Soul cultivator Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli flew further, sensing a growing oppression. The ruins were far denser than the outside, affecting a wide area.  Different forces intermingled and clashed, making it extremely perilous.</p><p>Although the threat of beasts was gone, it had become more chaotic and no safer.</p><p>"It seems we have no choice but to abandon this opportunity..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Xian Tong might be lying in wait, but they couldn't afford to play games with him. They had to reach the ruin Ning Zhenren mentioned.</p><p>Then, the two altered course and flew in another direction.</p><p>And so, a potential ambush was inadvertently avoided.</p><p>Ning Zhenren's described hidden realm was deep within Heart Lake. Qin Sang and his companion chose a route that wasn't too far off. After flying for a while, they both noticed that the geographical markings were almost useless and couldn't help them avoid danger.</p><p>For example, they were stopped by a blizzard, clearly caused by an ancient protective formation from some hidden realm, something not indicated on any map.</p><p>In the depths of Heart Lake now, similar situations were common; the same distance took several times longer than outside.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, "Heart Lake is completely unrecognizable!"</p><p>Liuli closed her eyes, sensing deeply. After a moment, she opened them and said, "The snowflakes are formed from pure extreme cold energy. Perhaps we don't need to go around, but I need to first understand the hidden changes within this extreme cold energy."</p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. This blizzard was vast; going around would waste time, and other paths might not be any better.</p><p>"Be careful, fairy. There might be treasures of the ice path hidden within," Qin Sang said, summoning his Thunder Beast guards. One on each side of Liuli, he allowed her to focus on her understanding.</p><p>The three figures flickered, landing on the ice. They immediately felt intense pressure along with a wave of cold, and proceeded with heavy steps through the blizzard.</p><p>Soon, they were covered in a layer of snow. Without using magic to remove it, they walked slowly, gradually disappearing into the wind and snow.</p><p>There were no ferocious beasts here, but there were snow monsters formed from the shifting ice and snow, with considerable strength. However, perhaps because of the chaotic power of the formation, these snow monsters were dazed and their attacks lacked method.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Thunder Beast guards attacked together.  Lightning flashed across the sky, thunder splitting a path through the snow monsters.</p><p>As time went on, the pressure on them intensified. Though Qin Sang searched for weaknesses in the formation, passing quickly was not easy.</p><p>At this moment, the silent Liuli finally moved. With a wave of her jade hand, a blue light floated towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang allowed the blue light to approach. Feeling a unique chill similar to the surrounding atmosphere, a thin layer of ice quickly spread over him, forming ice armor around his body.</p><p>Enveloped by this cold, Qin Sang felt the pressure lessen considerably.</p><p>Liuli let out a sigh of relief, her expression slightly weary. "We'll rely on Daoist Qin to lead the way from now on."</p><p>"This ice armor is enough!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression brightened. He gave orders to the Thunder Beast guards, and together they charged out of the snow monsters' territory.</p><p>There were many weak points in the formation. Being able to withstand the pressure, their progress became much smoother. After traveling a while longer, Qin Sang suddenly sensed a faint fluctuation. His eyes flashed, and he informed Liuli.</p><p>Liuli hesitated. "Won't that take too long?"</p><p>Qin Sang concentrated, sensing the fluctuation. "It's alright!"</p><p>The location of the fluctuation was possibly an important point within the formation. Judging by the power of the formation, this place probably hadn't been explored.</p><p>Why not seize this easily available opportunity?</p><p>With the help of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, Qin Sang quickly located the position of the fluctuation. Working together, they finally broke through a barrier, revealing a snow-capped mountain.</p><p>The mountain was tall and imposing, its peak covered in white snow. A sheer cliff face stood before them, and atop the cliff sat an ice pavilion.</p><p>They exchanged a glance and flew to the pavilion. The door had no restrictions; perhaps the outer formation and the barrier were merely tests.</p><p>Liuli stepped forward and pushed open the door. The ice pavilion had only one floor. There were an altar and cushions on the floor, and a painting hung on the wall.</p><p>"This is someone from the Hanhuang State," Qin Sang recognized the person in the painting, having previously passed through Hanhuang State.</p><p>The altar was empty. Beside the painting was a niche, containing jade slips and other objects.</p><p>Liuli bowed to the painting, took a jade slip, and after a cursory glance, said, "These are magical techniques of the ice path, and this senior's cultivation insights. Most require Hanhuang bloodline to use, but I can still learn from them."</p><p>"We can trade them with cultivators from Hanhuang State," Qin Sang looked towards another niche. "What's this?"</p><p>Inside was an ice ball, the size of a baby's fist, crystal clear, but without any coldness.</p><p>Liuli's expression turned serious. She activated her true essence, forming an ice hand, carefully grasping the ice ball. Only after careful examination did she dare to confirm it, exclaiming in surprise, "It's a piece of Celestial Dew Ice!"</p><p>--</p><p>--</p><p>I got off work late today.</p>
