<h1>Chapter 344: The Choice</h1><p>The Celestial Corpse Talisman can harm, but it can also save.</p><p>However, this 'save' comes with a huge question mark.</p><p>Based on his experience refining corpses a few days ago, Qin Sang was confident the Celestial Corpse Talisman could seal Tan Jie's primordial spirit.  Tan Jie's cultivation was low, and his primordial spirit was fragile. With careful control, Qin Sang was confident nothing would go wrong.</p><p>However, once the Celestial Corpse Talisman enters the body, it completely fuses with the primordial spirit, causing strange changes.  They become one, and perhaps it could no longer be called a primordial spirit.</p><p>Tan Jie didn't have a jade Buddha to protect his primordial spirit. After the fusion, separation would be impossible.</p><p>This process is irreversible, incurable.</p><p>At least, there's no mention of it in the *Celestial Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>Even if Tan Hao could find a way to undo the Celestial Corpse Talisman, whether Tan Jie could awaken, or whether something more terrifying than death might occur, remained unknown.</p><p>Perhaps he would be trapped forever, even affecting the legendary cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>The world is full of wonders, after all.</p><p>Perhaps, a miracle might happen in the future.</p><p>A slim chance.</p><p>Should Tan Jie be laid to rest?</p><p>Or should he cling to his obsession, persevere, and grasp at this incredibly slim hope?</p><p>Only Tan Hao could decide.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't be explicit. He pretended the Celestial Corpse Talisman was a unique technique and used demonic corpse refining arts as an analogy, carefully explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the talisman to Tan Hao, especially the consequences.</p><p>He believed Tan Hao would understand.</p><p>After listening, Tan Hao stood there, dazed, speechless.</p><p>"Think it over carefully before making a decision. However, don't take too long. Otherwise, if Tan Jie's primordial spirit dissipates too much, it might have an impact," Qin Sang patted Tan Hao's shoulder and walked out of the cave.</p><p>If it were him, what would he choose?</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, refusing to dwell on it.</p><p>Back in his cave, Qin Sang waited for Tan Hao's reply while organizing his magical tools.  Regardless of Tan Hao's decision, he had to leave for the Ancient Immortal Battlefield in a few days to rescue Shi Hong.</p><p>He had his own matters to attend to and couldn't stay at the Yin Mountain Pass for too long.</p><p>Liang Yan was active around the Yin Mountain Pass and the Windswept Market, using aliases, moving mysteriously, and acting discreetly. Qin Sang needed to investigate secretly to track him down.</p><p>Liang Yan's strength was unknown.</p><p>Out of caution, Qin Sang tentatively treated him as a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Equipped with top-grade magical tools, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of any opponent at the same level. However, he needed to plan carefully how to eliminate Liang Yan without harming Shi Hong.</p><p>If he could set a trap beforehand and wait for Liang Yan to walk into it, that would be ideal. Qin Sang was confident he could prevent Liang Yan's escape.</p><p>Even capturing him alive wasn't impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang was pondering how to expose Liang Yan without alerting him.</p><p>Suddenly, someone knocked on his cave.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the cave's restrictive formation and saw Tan Hao standing outside.  Seeing Tan Hao's expression, Qin Sang knew his decision before he spoke.</p><p>He hadn't expected Tan Hao to decide so quickly.</p><p>With a complex expression, Qin Sang asked gravely, "Brother Tan, have you truly thought it through?"</p><p>Tan Hao's eyes were red-rimmed, a flicker of struggle in them. He took a deep breath and said resolutely, "Brother Qin, since Tan Jie fell into a coma, I've never again dreamt of achieving immortality!</p><p>"My only motivation to live until now has been to cure Tan Jie!  I'm willing to trade my life for his!</p><p>"If he dies, I don't know what meaning life holds for me.</p><p>"As long as there's a sliver of hope, I won't give up!</p><p>"Brother Qin, what preparations are needed for this unique technique? I'll go and exchange for them immediately!"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped talking and shook his head. "I have everything here. As long as you agree, we can begin immediately. Wait outside for a moment; it won't take long..."</p><p>He sealed the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the crystal coffin, opened it, and exposed Tan Jie's body.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to judge Tan Hao's choice, nor could he determine whether it was right or wrong.</p><p>After all, in this world, reincarnation also existed only in legends. No one knew if it was real, while death was something everyone could truly 'see.'</p><p>Although he had used the Celestial Corpse Talisman once before, Qin Sang was still very careful. After all, Tan Jie's cultivation was weak, his soul incredibly fragile, leaving no room for error.</p><p>When he sensed the connection between the Celestial Corpse Talisman and Tan Jie's primordial spirit, he struck the talisman into Tan Jie's forehead.</p><p>He felt almost no resistance. The Celestial Corpse Talisman easily sealed and merged with Tan Jie's primordial spirit.</p><p>Apart from the necessary restrictions, Qin Sang didn't take any extra actions, fearing unknown consequences, then carefully placed Tan Jie back into the crystal coffin.</p><p>Besides, Tan Hao wouldn't use Tan Jie as a corpse puppet.</p><p>After merging with the Celestial Corpse Talisman, Tan Jie's primordial spirit indeed stopped dissipating.</p><p>As for the future fate of the Tan brothers, it was up to the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang made a final check, opened the cave's restriction, and Tan Hao rushed in. After sensing Tan Jie's current state, his face was a mixture of grief and joy, his eyes filled with complex emotions.</p><p>Cloud Traveler had also arrived at some point, following him inside and nodding at Qin Sang.</p><p>An idea struck Qin Sang. He took a jade bottle from his Mustard Seed Bag and handed it to Tan Hao. Inside was a Foundation Establishment Pill.</p><p>"Take this Foundation Establishment Pill."</p><p>He had obtained three Foundation Establishment Pills in total: one as a reward from his sect, two from Sun De's belongings. He later consumed one himself and gave another to Song Ying to fulfill his promise.</p><p>He had originally planned to exchange this last Foundation Establishment Pill for something, but it hadn't been used.</p><p>The Foundation Establishment Pill was useless to Foundation Establishment cultivators, and Qin Sang didn't intend to take on any disciples, so it wasn't particularly precious. However, it was a treasure that Qi Refining cultivators yearned for.</p><p>Qin Sang was touched by Tan Hao's resolve and decided to give him one last push.</p><p>Tan Hao hadn't yet reached Foundation Establishment not due to lack of talent, but because he had been caring for Tan Jie.</p><p>His talent was far superior to Qin Sang's. Although he was over fifty, with the help of the Foundation Establishment Pill, he might have a chance.</p><p>Staring at the sparkling blue pill in the jade bottle, Tan Hao was completely stunned.</p><p>Noticing Qin Sang's sidelong glance, Cloud Traveler chuckled, pointing at him with a helpless expression, "You, you're even scheming against this old Taoist..."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. When it came to achieving Foundation Establishment at an advanced age with declining vitality, no one was more experienced than Cloud Traveler.</p><p>With his guidance, Tan Hao would definitely benefit greatly.</p><p>Cloud Traveler wasn't angry. After some thought, he also took out a jade bottle containing a jade-green pill.</p><p>"This Jade Radiance Pill is something I refined during my Qi Refining stage to replenish my declining vitality and break through to Foundation Establishment. It's useless to me now. Take it, Fellow Daoist Tan. Your situation is much better than mine back then. After consuming it, spend three days refining its potency. Coupled with Brother Qin's Foundation Establishment Pill, your chances of reaching Foundation Establishment are quite good."</p>
