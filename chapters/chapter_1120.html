<h1>Chapter 1112: Senior Sister</h1><p>The ice coffin emanated waves of chilling cold.  </p><p>Qin Sang looked at Qing Jun.  </p><p>Qing Jun gazed at the ice coffin.  </p><p>She saw the peach wood sword tightly clutched by Qing Zhu.  </p><p>She remembered that Qin Sang had bought such a wooden sword from her at the Moon Inquiry Market.  </p><p>“Did he pass away recently?”  </p><p>Seeing that Qing Zhu’s body was intact and not reduced to bones, Qing Jun’s brows furrowed slightly. Her eyes turned cold, and a hint of anger tinged her voice.  </p><p>After disappearing from the Purple Palace, Qing Zhu had left no trace—neither alive nor dead.  </p><p>For hundreds of years, they had been separated.  </p><p>Qing Jun knew a little about what had happened in the Purple Palace back then. She understood that Qing Zhu had faced an extremely perilous situation, a life-and-death struggle.  </p><p>They had all assumed that Qing Zhu had perished in the Purple Palace.  </p><p>Her mother had passed away with regret, her heart heavy with sorrow.  </p><p>Seeing Qing Jun’s misunderstanding, Qin Sang quickly explained, “Senior Qing Zhu did not wish to stay away. It was because he severed his own primordial spirit and forcibly cultivated the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Art*, which led to severe injuries and a backlash from the demonic soul. For years, he struggled against the demonic soul…”  </p><p>Qing Jun’s expression softened slightly, as if murmuring to herself, “Those who seek shortcuts must eventually pay the price.”  </p><p>She was well aware of Qing Zhu’s life and the power and hidden dangers of the *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Art*. She knew Qin Sang’s words were true.  </p><p>Qing Zhu’s actions back then had sown the seeds of disaster.  </p><p>From her tone, Qin Sang detected something unusual, and a flicker of surprise passed through his eyes.  </p><p>“He doesn’t seem to have died from the demonic soul’s backlash,” Qing Jun said sharply. “The injuries within his body are extraordinary.”  </p><p>Senior Qing Zhu had died by channeling sword energy into his own body.  </p><p>In the current era of cultivation, even the most powerful cultivators would find it difficult to inflict such injuries.  </p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “The demonic soul was seduced by an ancient demon lord and nearly released him from an ancient seal. Senior Qing Zhu, driven by righteousness, chose to sacrifice himself, perishing together with the demonic soul and the demon lord. Alas! If not for the ancient demon lord, Senior Qing Zhu could have returned with me…”  </p><p>Thinking of Qing Zhu’s fate, Qin Sang still felt a deep sense of injustice and sorrow.  </p><p>“That does sound like something he would do,” Qing Jun said, nodding. Then, her eyes narrowed sharply. “An ancient demon lord?”  </p><p>“Although the demon lord has been sealed for countless years, his power remains terrifying, capable of crushing Nascent Soul cultivators. I recall that during the ambush at the Immortal Array by the Sin Abyss, they summoned a three-headed, six-armed demonic shadow. Could that also be related to the ancient demon lord?” Qin Sang asked gravely.  </p><p>This was something he had long been concerned about. While interacting with various factions at Yin Mountain Pass, he had tried to probe for information.  </p><p>Unfortunately, he had no access to Nascent Soul ancestors and found it difficult to uncover the true secrets.  </p><p>Now that he had encountered Qing Jun, it was only natural to ask.  </p><p>His friends and loved ones were all in the Minor Cold Domain, and he would likely remain there for a long time to cultivate. He had no choice but to care about the state of the war.  </p><p>Qing Jun seemed lost in thought. Upon hearing Qin Sang’s question, she replied, “If the Sin Abyss also had such a terrifying ancient demon lord, the Minor Cold Domain would have already been devastated. The Sin Abyss is indeed peculiar, but the situation hasn’t reached that point yet.”  </p><p>After a pause, Qing Jun lowered her gaze to the ice coffin and asked, “Did he leave any last words?”  </p><p>“Senior Qing Zhu entrusted me to bring his remains back and bury them in Peach Blossom Valley. In his final moments, he harbored no resentment or regret. He only said that they had been waiting for him for many years and that he could finally reunite with them in the afterlife…”  </p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the two graves and faithfully recounted Qing Zhu’s last words.  </p><p>Then, he took out a jade slip inscribed with the *Qing Zhu Sword Scripture* and handed it to Qing Jun.  </p><p>“This sword scripture was carved by Senior Qing Zhu on a cliff. It contains the most precious insights of his life.”  </p><p>Qing Jun accepted the jade slip.  </p><p>She spent a long time reading the few lines inscribed on it.  </p><p>Finally, she returned the jade slip to Qin Sang. “This is what he left for you.”  </p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback but silently accepted it.  </p><p>Qing Jun walked over to the two tombstones and gently touched the stone tablets with her fingers. After a moment of silence, she suddenly spoke, “You must find it strange that, upon hearing this tragic news, I don’t seem to be grieving?”  </p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected Qing Jun to ask this.  </p><p>Ever since he had taken out the ice coffin, he had been secretly observing her.  </p><p>Even as he recounted Senior Qing Zhu’s ordeal and last words, her expression and tone had remained detached, as if she were listening to the story of a stranger.  </p><p>In the past, Qin Sang had also sensed something similar. Whenever Qing Jun mentioned Senior Qing Zhu, her tone had been indifferent. He had never imagined they were father and daughter.  </p><p>Feeling that he didn’t understand the full story, Qin Sang decided it was best not to say too much, lest he provoke Qing Jun’s anger. He carefully replied, “Senior Qing Zhu, trapped by the demonic soul, saw the peach wood sword you had carved. Despite the risk of being devoured by the demonic soul, he struggled to break free and asked me about your current state. When he learned that you were safe and had achieved great cultivation, his joy was evident. In his final moments, Senior Qing Zhu said that, to you, he had failed in his duties. He was merely your birth father, nothing more, and that you should not be disturbed…”  </p><p>“You don’t need to be so cautious in front of me. No matter what, he was my father. You brought his remains back, and for that, I owe you a debt of gratitude,” Qing Jun interrupted Qin Sang, seeing through his thoughts. After a moment of contemplation, she added, “Since he chose you as his successor, from now on, you may call me Senior Sister.”  </p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily stunned.  </p><p>He had vaguely hoped to use this opportunity to build a relationship with Qing Jun.  </p><p>Although they had interacted in the past, it had only been a transaction.  </p><p>He had never expected it to turn out so well.  </p><p>With Dongyang Bo as a formidable enemy looming over him, Qin Sang naturally desired the favor of a Nascent Soul ancestor.  </p><p>“Qin Sang pays his respects to Senior Sister!”  </p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang immediately bowed, acknowledging the relationship.  </p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at the ice coffin, silently thanking Senior Qing Zhu for his unspoken care.  </p><p>Senior Qing Zhu must have known his daughter’s temperament well. By having Qin Sang bring him back to Peach Blossom Valley for burial, he had likely foreseen this outcome.  </p><p>“This is the Elder Token of the Illusory Mist Sect. With this token, you may freely enter and leave Peach Blossom Valley and cultivate within it. You may also move through the cultivation world as an elder of the Illusory Mist Sect without fear of being questioned.”  </p><p>Qing Jun sent a streak of light toward Qin Sang, handing him a token. Then, her tone shifted slightly, her voice turning cold. “Qin Sang, I don’t care what grievances you have with Dongyang Bo. Do not attempt to drag me into them. If you seek revenge, rely on yourself.”  </p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang felt a chill in his heart. He understood the meaning behind Qing Jun’s words.  </p><p>Their connection was due to Senior Qing Zhu, but there was no real bond between them.  </p><p>Qing Jun had allowed him to establish a cave in Peach Blossom Valley and gifted him the Elder Token, ensuring that he wouldn’t have to worry about being discovered by Dongyang Bo before breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage. This was already a great favor.  </p><p>He must not overstep!  </p><p>Qing Jun had no enmity with Dongyang Bo.  </p><p>With the Sin Abyss pressing down on their borders and the crisis unresolved, Dongyang Bo, as a Nascent Soul expert, was crucial to their side. Given the circumstances and Qing Jun’s temperament, it was even less likely that she would take action against Dongyang Bo and cause internal strife within the Minor Cold Domain.  </p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had never entertained such thoughts.</p>
