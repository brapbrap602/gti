<h1>Chapter 1981: The Mortal Realm</h1><p>Activate the altar!</p><p>Using the bronze pillar as bait, Qin Sang deployed the incomplete Four Symbols Sword Formation to manifest his Sword Domain, trapping Old Ancestor Ming Hu, finally revealing his hidden dagger.</p><p>The Thunder Altar materialized.</p><p>The beam of lightning that shot towards the heavens was like the first light to illuminate the mortal realm, bathing the earth in its radiance!</p><p>The Yan Kingdom, already draped in the twilight's grey veil, was thoroughly illuminated by the lightning, every detail revealed.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom had already moved its capital to the former capital of the Da Liang Kingdom.</p><p>The Capital, Chancellor's Residence.</p><p>Yu Lang, draped in a brocade robe, leaned back in his grandmaster's chair, a scroll in his hand, engrossed in his reading. A charcoal brazier rested at his feet, the dark red embers radiating warmth throughout the study.</p><p>With his cultivation level, he wouldn't feel the cold of winter, but having spent the past decade disguised as a mortal, he had grown accustomed to this life.</p><p>The setting sun's afterglow streamed through the window, casting golden light upon the scroll.</p><p>Just as he was deeply absorbed, a blinding light suddenly pierced into the study. The light was so bright that it fell upon the book, blurring the characters.</p><p>Yu Lang's expression shifted, and he abruptly stood, gazing out the window. Outside, everything was a blinding white, impossible to see with the naked eye.</p><p>Chaos erupted within the Chancellor's Residence, filled with cries of alarm.</p><p>"Yu Lang!"</p><p>An urgent voice rang out beside his ear.</p><p>It was Brother Sha!</p><p>Evenings were his time for reading and contemplation; Brother Sha wouldn't usually disturb him at this hour.</p><p>"Brother Sha, where is this light coming from?"</p><p>Yu Lang's thoughts raced. He instinctively assumed that cultivators were battling outside the city. With such a display, they must be at least Nascent Soul cultivators!</p><p>A sign of troubled times!</p><p>The Yan Kingdom was unified, but everyone knew that the peace was only temporary. Conflicts continued to simmer along the borders.</p><p>The Yan Kingdom and its neighboring countries were all strengthening their armies, with cultivators fanning the flames.</p><p>True peace would only come with complete unification.</p><p>"It seems to be originating from Green Ram Temple!"</p><p>A figure flickered beside Yu Lang. Sha Jiayu appeared, his body coated in a layer of white frost under the radiant light, pale and unreal.</p><p>His face was grave as he looked towards the southwest, performing a hand seal.</p><p>Yu Lang felt his vision clear, finally seeing the pillar-like beam of lightning that pierced the sky.</p><p>Such a celestial phenomenon, visible even from a thousand miles away in the capital – what was happening there? Could it be that a powerful enemy had attacked Green Ram Temple?</p><p>Yu Lang couldn't help but recall the decisive battle years ago, when his master descended the mountain, defeating numerous demons and thwarting the Soulfall Abyss's scheme. Could they be holding a grudge?</p><p>"Stay calm! If the Daoist Priest and Little Wu are no match for them, we'll only be throwing our lives away. Let's inform Immortal Yun first," Sha Jiayu, seeing Yu Lang's expression, cautioned him, worried he was acting rashly out of concern.</p><p>Yu Lang nodded and immediately sent a message talisman, but his resolve remained firm. "Master has shown me immense kindness. If my sect is in danger, I must return. I'd rather die at Green Ram Temple! Brother Sha is not a disciple of Green Ram Temple, so don't get involved. Please, Brother Sha, send me back and then return to the capital. If I perish, I hope you can look after my family!"</p><p>Seeing Yu Lang's unwavering determination and fearlessness in the face of death, Sha Jiayu knew his mind was made up. He sighed softly, "Let's return and see. Hopefully, the situation isn't that dire..."</p><p>Sha Jiayu summoned his flying treasure, took Yu Lang aboard, and flew with all his might.</p><p>Only when they were airborne did they realize the true scale of the celestial phenomenon.</p><p>In all directions, above and below.</p><p>Light illuminated everything, painting the world in silver.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the phenomenon was not limited to the Yan Kingdom.</p><p>As the lightning rapidly spread beyond the Yan Kingdom, the branch altars erupted simultaneously with the main altar.</p><p>Sixty-four branch altars, arranged systematically around the main altar, covered nearly the entire mortal realm.</p><p>The locations of these branch altars varied greatly.</p><p>The world had changed dramatically since their initial construction.</p><p>Some were hidden deep within mountains, rivers, and lakes; others were situated in towns and villages; one even resided within an ancient well.</p><p>As the altar formation activated, all branch altars reappeared in the world!</p><p>Tai Yi felt the altar beneath him tremble, unable to suppress his excitement.</p><p>He had long yearned for the Dao Court and could finally witness the true power of Lord Shijun and the Dao Court's altar formations!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The altar stirred, and a celestial phenomenon erupted.</p><p>Mountains split open, revealing altars hidden for countless years.  Countless lightning-like runes lifted Tai Yi into the sky, instantly transforming into a Thunder Altar.</p><p>This Thunder Altar was slightly smaller than the one at Green Ram Temple, resonating with the main altar.</p><p>Similar phenomena occurred at the other branch altars.</p><p>Tai Yi stood atop the Thunder Altar, his robes fluttering, gazing towards Green Ram Temple.</p><p>From his position, he couldn't see Green Ram Temple, but he could sense the main altar and the other branch altars through the formation.</p><p>All the altars and altar masters were connected by the formation, brewing an immensely terrifying power.</p><p>Tai Yi dared not, nor could he, be distracted.</p><p>At this moment, all branch altar masters cast aside all other thoughts, following the will transmitted from the main altar, holding their thunder talismans, and pacing in ritualistic steps.</p><p>As the thunder incantations were activated, the Thunder Altars trembled violently, unleashing deafening thunderclaps.</p><p>Including the main altar, a total of sixty-five beams of lightning, like giant swords piercing the heavens, seemed to puncture the sky itself.</p><p>The mortal realm was being baptized by lightning.</p><p>Following the extreme brightness, darkness descended swiftly.</p><p>The celestial phenomena triggered by the Thunder Altars were earth-shattering. The world's spiritual energy surged, and boundless dark clouds gathered.</p><p>Before people could recover from the shock of the lightning, they saw the sky covered in dark clouds, as if the heavens were truly about to collapse.</p><p>At this moment, regardless of whether mortal or immortal, an uncontrollable fear rose within everyone's heart.</p><p>The entire sky of the mortal realm was shrouded in dark clouds, and the celestial phenomena were far from over.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Muffled thunder echoed from the heavens.</p><p>The thunder grew louder and louder, shaking hearts.</p><p>From within the churning dark clouds, bolts of lightning flashed intermittently, revealing all sorts of terrifying scenes.</p><p>Above the sea of clouds, an incredibly mystical realm, thunderbolts resembled true dragons, fleetingly glimpsed before vanishing back into the clouds.</p><p>The celestial phenomena grew increasingly terrifying, resembling the legendary Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Chaos reigned in the mortal realm.</p><p>"Heavenly Lord, have mercy! Heavenly Lord, have mercy!"</p><p>Mortals trembled with fear, kneeling and praying.</p><p>Demons recalled their own thunder tribulations, either prostrating themselves on the ground or hiding in their lairs, shivering.</p><p>Cultivators were filled with trepidation.</p><p>Sensing the terrifying heavenly might, even Nascent Soul cultivators paled. Some sects hastily activated their protective formations, but they all knew it was merely self-deception.</p><p>If the thunder from above truly descended, their mountain gates would be razed to the ground in an instant.</p><p>No one knew what was happening.</p><p>On the border of the Yan Kingdom, Immortal Yun was startled awake from his meditation. He flew out of his cave and, upon seeing the celestial phenomena, was filled with uncertainty.</p><p>…</p><p>The fluctuations of the altar formation spread to Twilightfall Mountain and Cloud Capital Mountain.</p><p>Cultivators in both locations were alerted.</p><p>Cultivators whose caves were closer to the mortal realm flew into the sky and witnessed the transformations occurring below.</p><p>From above, the mortal realm was enveloped in dark clouds, and above the sea of clouds, even more terrifying phenomena unfolded.</p><p>Almost the instant the sixty-five lightning pillars shot forth, countless thunderbolts were born.</p><p>Their origin unknown.</p><p>Beneath the heavens, all transformed into a sea of thunder!</p><p>Bolts of lightning, as if tearing through the void, danced wildly in the sky.</p><p>This was the scene witnessed by the cultivators of Twilightfall Mountain and Cloud Capital Mountain, each frozen in place, faces etched with shock.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang leisurely sipped his spiritual tea, his gaze sweeping past Gu Yun Sou towards the mortal realm.</p><p>As for Gu Yun Sou, the moment the altar formation activated, his expression drastically changed, and he abruptly stood.</p><p>Qin Sang remained seated, as steady as a mountain, admiring his handiwork.</p><p>Although he had anticipated it, witnessing the power of the altar formation firsthand still left him awestruck, let alone Gu Yun Sou.</p><p>…</p><p>Unfortunately, Old Ancestor Ming Hu remained completely oblivious.</p><p>The Sword Formation exuded the aura of a Sword Domain, causing not only Gu Yun Sou to lose his composure but Old Ancestor Ming Hu to be even more shocked.</p><p>The power of a Sword Domain was beyond his imagination.</p><p>Previously, under Qin Sang's continuous onslaught, Old Ancestor Ming Hu felt at most anger, not believing his life was in danger.</p><p>Now, he truly felt threatened, and terrified!</p><p>A sword cultivator who had comprehended a Sword Domain…</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu's thoughts raced. He chose not to immediately activate his Life and Death Reversal Wheel.  Instead, he opened his storage pouch and retrieved the bronze pillar.</p><p>"This old man has no intention of monopolizing the treasure. Since fellow Daoist also desires the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar, there's no need for us to fight to the death.  As they say, it's better to resolve grievances than to create them.  If fellow Daoist ceases your attack, we'll consider our past grievances settled. Of the Azure Sky Sect's reward, my Soulfall Abyss will only take forty percent!"</p><p>Since he could share the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation with Yun Du Tian, he could naturally share the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar as well.</p><p>The strength displayed by his opponent was enough to warrant a concession; there was no shame in showing weakness.</p><p>Forty percent, even thirty percent, was negotiable.</p><p>Ultimately, they didn't have any deep-seated hatred, and the Azure Sky Sect's reward wasn't some unique, irreplaceable treasure.</p><p>For a Void Refinement cultivator, their own well-being was paramount.</p><p>His opponent's strength was unfathomable.  After all, he was only at the early stage of Void Refinement. If he fought with his life on the line, his opponent wouldn't escape unscathed.</p><p>Injuries to a Void Refinement cultivator could take centuries to heal, undoubtedly affecting their cultivation.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu didn't believe Qin Sang would force him into a corner.</p><p>Little did he know that his senses were being obscured by the Sword Formation and the Sword Domain. Even if the fluctuations from the altar formation reached him, they were masked by the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>This was precisely Qin Sang's intention, meticulously laying a trap to lure Old Ancestor Ming Hu into a desperate situation!</p><p>The altar formation was inscribed with fourth-order spiritual runes, and he was only at the early stage of Void Refinement.  Even with the altar formation's aid, it would be incredibly taxing.</p><p>Qin Sang worried that if he directly activated the altar formation, Old Ancestor Ming Hu would escape before the thunder talismans could be unleashed, rendering all his efforts futile.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang couldn't respond to Old Ancestor Ming Hu.</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>The four Deity Transformation cultivators, leading the branch altar masters, exerted all their strength, channeling countless lightning bolts towards the heavens.</p><p>The thunderous might surged.</p><p>This was a divine power capable of shaking heaven and earth.</p><p>Only thunder remained in the sky, its power terrifyingly immense, enough to annihilate everything!</p><p>The power of the thunder grew increasingly vast.</p><p>When this power reached its peak, it suddenly converged towards the center of the sea of thunder. In an instant, all celestial phenomena vanished, giving birth to an even more dazzling, radiant ball of lightning.</p><p>Compared to the boundless mortal realm, this ball of lightning was minuscule, only the size of a human head.</p><p>Within the lightning's core lay a silver sheet of paper.</p><p>This paper was identical to the silver paper within the main altar, even more solidified, containing the concentrated power of the entire altar formation.</p><p>The Dao Court's Fourth-Order Thunder Talisman: the Oath of Thunder Sacrifice!</p><p>In the next moment, this paper gently trembled and floated like a feather towards the north.</p><p>The Oath of Thunder Sacrifice was incredibly light, seemingly slow but incredibly fast, instantly traversing thousands of miles, 'drifting' towards the desert.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma Body let out a sigh of relief, yet a shiver ran down his spine. He waved his hand, withdrawing the Sword Formation and escaping the sinkhole.</p><p>The starlight faded.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu, believing he had persuaded his opponent, was about to dispel his Life and Death Reversal Wheel when suddenly, an incredibly terrifying fluctuation descended.</p><p>At this moment, Old Ancestor Ming Hu felt a chill run down his spine, looking upwards in terror.</p><p>The sky appeared normal, except for a single, gently fluttering silver sheet of paper.</p><p>This silver paper descended from the heavens.</p><p>In Old Ancestor Ming Hu's eyes, everything around him vanished, leaving only this paper.</p><p>His thoughts seemed to freeze, and he didn't notice the terrified expression that had crept onto his face.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, there was no sound. The silver paper seemed to weigh a thousand pounds, bringing an unbearable pressure.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu roared towards the sky, his voice as shrill as a vengeful ghost, laced with fear.</p><p>The black and white wheel above his head spun rapidly, instantly reversing life and death, erupting with power!</p><p>The entire sinkhole seemed to be drained of color, leaving only black and white auras.</p><p>A massive Life and Death Reversal Wheel trapped the Oath of Thunder Sacrifice at its center. The swirling vortex of black and white light pressed inwards, attempting to tear the thin silver paper apart!</p><p>The Oath of Thunder Sacrifice remained undisturbed, continuing its descent, unwavering, pressing down!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A crack appeared on the Life and Death Reversal Wheel, right before Old Ancestor Ming Hu's horrified eyes.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu roared, a roar of despair.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Flesh exploded.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu transformed into a dark golden skeleton, radiating a strange light.</p><p>Void Refinement corpse cultivators were known as Undying Bones, their bones tempered to an incredible hardness.</p><p>They could even regenerate from a single bone fragment.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu, instead of retreating, advanced, his entire body flashing with a dark light, charging towards the Life and Death Reversal Wheel.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Life and Death Reversal Wheel shattered completely, chaotic black and white auras filling the entire sinkhole.</p><p>At the center of the black and white auras, a blindingly bright lightning flashed, forming a terrifying lightning storm that swept across the land, overwhelming the power of the black and white auras.</p><p>Simultaneously with the explosion, a sword beam slashed down from above.</p><p>A Body Integration cultivator wielding a fourth-order spiritual talisman could undoubtedly obliterate Old Ancestor Ming Hu with ease.</p><p>However, this Oath of Thunder Sacrifice was deployed through the altar formation, its power directly linked to the altar and the altar master's cultivation level. This being his first time using it, Qin Sang couldn't guarantee absolute success.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang immediately followed up with a sword strike.</p><p>The Grey Oriole Sword sliced into the lightning storm.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly sensed Old Ancestor Ming Hu's struggling aura within the storm and drove the Grey Oriole Sword deeper.</p><p>…</p><p>Gu Yun Sou's hands and feet were ice-cold, his composure completely shattered.</p><p>If that silver paper had floated towards him, towards his Dharma Body, could he have survived?</p><p>Gu Yun Sou had no confidence, unless he could sense the danger beforehand.</p><p>Qin Sang had shocked him too many times, the most shocking being the Sword Domain and the altar formation he revealed at the end.</p><p>He turned, facing the calm Qin Sang, forcing himself to remain composed, his voice raspy as he spoke.</p><p>"Is this the play Daoist Priest wanted this old man to see?"</p><p>Qin Sang's actions weren't like someone fighting over the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar; it was clearly aimed at killing the old zombie.</p><p>The Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar seemed more like bait.</p><p>Did they have a prior feud, or was there another reason?</p><p>Gu Yun Sou felt there was more to it than met the eye, but he couldn't fathom Qin Sang's true intentions.</p><p>'Clack!'</p><p>Qin Sang placed his stone on the center point of the Go board.</p><p>"The mortal realm is forbidden to immortals and demons!"</p>
