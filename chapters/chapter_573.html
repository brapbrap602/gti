<h1>Chapter 566: Unexpected Incidents</h1><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened. He saw it.</p><p>Floating before Huang Tian and the Wuji Sect Master were identical objects.</p><p>A peculiar formation composed of countless fragments of the Bloodsoul Mulberry. These fragments, while smaller than the piece refined into the Ebony Sword, were considerable in number when combined.</p><p>At least half a Bloodsoul Mulberry tree!</p><p>Once activated, the formation violently extracted all the Bloodsoul Divine Light from the fragments, converging it into a blinding crimson light.</p><p>This process was incredibly swift. The formation completed the absorption in an instant, leaving no time for anyone to react, even if they had noticed.</p><p>Such a brutal act was not without consequence.  As the Bloodsoul Divine Light was drained, the fragments visibly paled.</p><p>More alarmingly, cracks appeared on the fragments, and they began to crumble.</p><p>Their essence destroyed, they reverted to ordinary wood.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, every single Bloodsoul Mulberry fragment was ruined.</p><p>This was draining the pond to catch the fish!</p><p>This was utter waste!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were bloodshot as he roared inwardly.</p><p>His heart bled at this sight.</p><p>If he had these Bloodsoul Mulberry fragments, even if they couldn't elevate the Ebony Sword to a supreme-grade magic treasure, a high-grade magic treasure would be guaranteed!</p><p>He wouldn't have to worry about improving the Ebony Sword anymore!</p><p>But no one cared about Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>The moment the crimson light flared, True One understood what Redhair Ancestor meant, and everyone else realized something was amiss with these two.</p><p>Ahead, the Abyss of Sin loomed menacingly.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master and Huang Tian had been bought by the Abyss of Sin!</p><p>The Minor North Star Formation could only withstand a portion of the Immortal Formation's Divine Wind. The Nascent Soul cultivators had to deploy their magic treasures for additional protection.</p><p>As they also had to protect their disciples, for safety's sake, they mostly deployed their strongest magic treasures, many of which were their Natal Magic Treasures.</p><p>If they released the Bloodsoul Divine Light, their treasures would be contaminated. The weakening of their strength would be a secondary issue; they wouldn't have time to deploy other magic treasures.</p><p>Presumably, the Abyss of Sin wouldn't give them a chance to counterattack.</p><p>The Minor North Star Formation wasn't designed for combat. Without their magic treasures, surrounded by the omnipresent Void Winds, with nowhere to escape, wouldn't they be left with no option but to await their demise?</p><p>If the upper echelons of the two domains were annihilated, the Abyss of Sin could effortlessly seize control of all three domains!</p><p>What a vicious scheme!</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators of the Heavenly Alliance were horrified, while Huang Tian and the Wuji Sect Master wore manic grins.</p><p>"Detonate!"</p><p>The two, having prepared their escape route, roared, ready to detonate the blood orbs.</p><p>However, at that very moment, the smile on the Wuji Sect Master's face froze. His eyes reflected the shadows of countless magic treasures, and his expression turned to one of utter terror.</p><p>"You..."</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master never dreamed that after Chongyi Daoist relayed the message to Redhair Ancestor, they had been wary of him.</p><p>They had initially suspected collusion with the Heavenly Alliance, not that he had been bought by the Abyss of Sin and would strike during the Immortal Formation's activation.</p><p>Even so, their reaction was far swifter than the Heavenly Alliance's.</p><p>In an instant, the Wuji Sect Master was engulfed by a barrage of attacks from various magic treasures.</p><p>Facing the combined assault of so many Nascent Soul cultivators of the same level, amidst the multicolored lights, the Wuji Sect Master was practically powerless. His Natal Spirit Sword was instantly shattered.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>With a tremendous explosion, the Wuji Sect Master and the few Golden Core cultivators under his protection were obliterated.</p><p>The Wuji Sect Master had only brought one disciple nearing the end of their lifespan on this trip. The others were members of sects affiliated with Wuji Sect or rogue cultivators, clearly meant to be abandoned.</p><p>Now, they were reduced to dust along with the Wuji Sect Master.</p><p>The onslaught of magic treasures hadn't dissipated. A damaged Nascent Soul, a miniature version of the Wuji Sect Master, leaped out from a gap, his face filled with panic.</p><p>Surrounded by so many watchful Nascent Soul cultivators, the Wuji Sect Master had no chance of escape. The moment he appeared, he was pierced by a waiting sword beam, courtesy of Duke Dongyang.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Wuji Sect Master was dead.</p><p>Unfortunately, although they had slain the Wuji Sect Master, they couldn't prevent the eruption of the Bloodsoul Divine Light.</p><p>This tactic was too unexpected; no one anticipated the Abyss of Sin using the Bloodsoul Mulberry against them.</p><p>Fortunately, they had been wary of the Wuji Sect Master and reacted quickly, eliminating him with a thunderous strike and hastily maneuvering their magic treasures to evade the blast, buying themselves precious time.</p><p>However, those near the Wuji Sect Master weren't so lucky.</p><p>The first casualty was Leng Yuntian.</p><p>He was closest to the Wuji Sect Master and was also preoccupied with maintaining the Minor North Star Formation.</p><p>Above him floated a dark iron pagoda.</p><p>The nine-story pagoda had a gourd-shaped object carved on its top, shimmering with a faint golden light. Each story had eight sides, each with a window, and a door on the bottom floor, all closed.</p><p>The characters 'Five Directions Pagoda' were inscribed on its surface.</p><p>The pagoda itself was only palm-sized, emitting a faint black light that enveloped Leng Yuntian and his disciples. It appeared unremarkable, unassuming.</p><p>However, during the pursuit of the Wuji Sect Master, the pagoda projected a magnificent image of itself.</p><p>Playing a significant role in effortlessly destroying the Wuji Sect Master's Natal Spirit Sword and giving him no respite.</p><p>Regrettably, even the mighty pagoda couldn't withstand the Bloodsoul Divine Light.</p><p>The intensely concentrated Bloodsoul Divine Light was like a splash of blood.</p><p>Engulfed, the pagoda's black light vanished, the golden glow of the gourd and the black light of the tower disappeared completely. The already inconspicuous pagoda became dull and lifeless, tilting before falling from Leng Yuntian's head.</p><p>It would likely take Leng Yuntian months to restore his magic treasure.</p><p>"My Five Directions Pagoda!"</p><p>Leng Yuntian clutched the pagoda, attempting to activate it, but it felt completely inert, unusable within the Purple Star Palace. He cried out in anguish.</p><p>Bing Han, the Patriarch of the Illusory Spirit Sect, suffered a similar fate. Her clothes, originally a magic treasure, were reduced to coarse linen after being tainted.</p><p>Bing Han shook her head, distressed but not as distraught as Leng Yuntian.</p><p>Besides them, one demon cultivator was also unlucky.  Others managed to maneuver their magic treasures to escape. Though splashed, their losses were acceptable.</p><p>Chen Yan shielded Qin Sang and the others, sacrificing a magic treasure to protect them; otherwise, the Five Elements Beast Seal would have been affected.</p><p>The Bloodsoul Divine Light erupted and dissipated quickly.</p><p>Overall, the Minor Cold Domain's strength remained largely intact.</p><p>The Heavenly Alliance, however, wasn't so fortunate. Their delayed response allowed Huang Tian to detonate the Bloodsoul Divine Light and escape the encirclement.</p><p>Their magic treasures were all tainted by the Bloodsoul Divine Light to varying degrees.</p>
