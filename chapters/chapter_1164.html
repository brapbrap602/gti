<h1>Chapter 1156: Nascent Soul</h1><p>Near the Yuan Shen Gate, Qin Sang found nothing unusual.</p><p>He had expected Dongyang Bo to leave some kind of arrangement nearby.</p><p>Finding he'd overestimated, he felt a touch of disappointment.</p><p>"Brother Bai, the Yuan Shen Gate is rich in spiritual energy and safer than other places. You should cultivate here from now on. If you need anything, just give orders to the Yuan Shen Gate disciples in my name."</p><p>Qin Sang entered the former cave abode of Leng Yuntian and allocated a quiet chamber for Bai.</p><p>Bai nodded.  "I only need to focus on refining the Corpse Soul Pearl, I don't need anything else."</p><p>"Qin awaits Brother Bai's good news!"</p><p>Qin Sang watched Bai enter the cave abode.</p><p>This seclusion of Bai's might last many years.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang was no longer the same person he once was, and he didn't need another helper at this moment.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and quickly said, "Brother Bai, when you advance to Corpse King and undergo the tribulation, be extremely careful! If you sense the opportunity to break through, notify me in advance so I can come and protect you."</p><p>Qin Sang solemnly warned him.</p><p>He and Yun Youzi had both experienced changes in their heavenly tribulations.</p><p>Bai's situation was different from theirs, yet also similar.  He didn't know if his tribulation would also be unusual.</p><p>…</p><p>The cave abode was sealed.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, recalling the process of forming his nascent soul and crossing the tribulation, his heart still filled with lingering fear.</p><p>Forming the nascent soul was fine.</p><p>He had made so many preparations. While the process was a little slow, it was relatively smooth, with the shattering of the golden core being the most perilous step.</p><p>The reversal of true energy, his dantian and meridians were almost torn apart by the chaotic true energy, and the pain was excruciating. Fortunately, Qin Sang was used to such pain. With immense willpower, he focused his mind, stabilized his cultivation, and condensed his nascent soul!</p><p>The heavenly tribulation that followed made Qin Sang truly understand the unpredictable power of Heaven.</p><p>Even with his strength, it was still incredibly difficult, and this was even after directly skipping the heart demon tribulation.  For others, they probably would have been reduced to ashes.</p><p>"Nascent Soul Manifest!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't wait. A flash of spiritual light appeared above his head.</p><p>His nascent soul left his body.</p><p>The nascent soul was even smaller than a miniature Sky-Eyed Butterfly, small and cute, exactly like Qin Sang in appearance, with bright and lively eyes. It floated in front of Qin Sang, looking at his physical body with a smile.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly also came out, even more excited than the nascent soul, fluttering around it.</p><p>The nascent soul was overjoyed and played with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>Then, the nascent soul opened its small mouth, and a slender ray of light flew out, revealing the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The nascent soul, filled with playfulness, directed the Ebony Sword to fly around, with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly chasing after it.  The chamber was instantly filled with flashing lights, dazzling to the eyes.</p><p>After a while, a look of fatigue suddenly appeared on the nascent soul's face. It retracted the spiritual sword and returned to the physical body.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang opened his eyes, his eyes filled with unconcealed excitement, and also a new understanding.</p><p>After the shattering of the golden core and the formation of the nascent soul, although he could project his spirit onto it and have the nascent soul leave his body, controlling it was still somewhat difficult, with a feeling of awkwardness.</p><p>He probably needed to stabilize his cultivation and consolidate his nascent soul before he could use it freely.  Only then could he smoothly use the teleportation ability.</p><p>Even so, it still filled Qin Sang with great joy.</p><p>The nascent soul, like a newborn baby, had an innocent heart.  This state made it much easier to comprehend the Dao than before.</p><p>"Coupled with the amplification of the Killing Talisman, my cultivation speed is already very fast. However, I can't be careless.  In the future, I must overcome the bottlenecks of every small realm with my own abilities. These difficulties will probably not be easier than those I've faced before, otherwise there wouldn't be so few great cultivators…"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. Thinking about the later stages of Nascent Soul was indeed too early.</p><p>What he needed to do now was to cultivate step by step.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang suddenly summoned the Killing Sword fragment, gazing at it, his expression changing constantly.</p><p>At the moment he formed his nascent soul, a strange consciousness, very faint, suddenly came from within the Killing Sword fragment.  It was a crucial moment, and he almost missed it.</p><p>Without a doubt, this consciousness must have come from the sword spirit of the Killing Sword fragment.</p><p>Its message was that he should continue searching for the other Killing Sword fragments.</p><p>When he encounters a Killing Sword fragment, the sword spirit would send a reminder.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had tried countless times, but the Killing Sword spirit had never responded. He estimated it was because his cultivation was too low before.  At the moment of forming his nascent soul, the intense fluctuations awakened the sword spirit, allowing it to transmit its consciousness.</p><p>However, the consciousness of the sword spirit disappeared in an instant and fell back into slumber.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, tentatively using his divine sense to probe into the Killing Sword fragment. After searching, he still found nothing, receiving no response.</p><p>It's clear the sword spirit remains very weak and can't stay awake for long.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated.  Qing Zhu's warning echoed in his mind – the sword spirit had controlled his body while he was unconscious, causing Qin Sang to worry.</p><p>He couldn't be sure if the sword spirit was good or evil.  However, he hadn't sensed any malice from its consciousness.</p><p>A murder weapon that births a spirit is undoubtedly a treasure, incredibly tempting.  More importantly, each fragment of the murder weapon might be paired with a piece of a cultivation technique.  He hadn't expected the sword spirit to bring such a surprise.</p><p>While becoming a Divine Transformation cultivator remains a distant goal, preparing cultivation techniques in advance wouldn't hurt.</p><p>"I wonder if there are more fragments in the Purple Micro Palace or Seven Killing Hall.  I may need to leave Bei Chen territory and explore the other three regions later," Qin Sang thought.</p><p>The sword spirit's communication meant he needed to replan his actions. He couldn't stay in Xiao Han region for cultivation; he had to search for the murder weapon fragments. After establishing the Green Sheep Temple, he must quickly find a trustworthy person to protect the temple and the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea. He hoped Li Yu Fu wouldn't disappoint him.</p><p>As for the sword spirit's backlash, Qin Sang felt it wasn't an immediate concern.  Once the sword spirit awakened, his cultivation would undoubtedly be far stronger, and he might then have a way to subdue it. Besides, the spirit might already recognize him as its master.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang put away the murder weapon fragment and looked at the Heaven's Eye Butterfly on his shoulder.  During the tribulation, the butterfly had helped him withstand the lightning while absorbing stray bolts, but there were no noticeable changes yet.</p><p>"How can I help the Heaven's Eye Butterfly grow and truly master the ability to absorb tribulation lightning?" Qin Sang was troubled, having no idea how to continue its training. He wondered if the Imperial Spirit Sect had any relevant texts he could consult.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly rubbed against Qin Sang affectionately before retreating into his dantian.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang reviewed his post-Nascent Soul cultivation plans.  The first was to cultivate the eighth level of the *Metaphysical Spirit Sword Cultivation Chapter*.</p><p>This required projecting the killing runes on the ebony sword onto the seven sword souls, then slowly merging these souls with his seven essences.  The ebony sword's condition wouldn't affect the cultivation. So Qin Sang took out the other half of the soul-nourishing wood, intending to refine it soon to enhance the ebony sword.</p>
