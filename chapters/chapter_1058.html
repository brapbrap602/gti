<h1>Chapter 1050: The Dragon's Call</h1><p>Entering the Inner Sanctum, they were surrounded by enemies. The humans would certainly not hesitate to eliminate all the demon kings.</p><p>Just then, the Nine-Phoenix King, who had been silent, focusing on sensing the Heavenly Phoenix barrier, suddenly stirred and exclaimed with delight, "I've found the exit!"</p><p>With that, the Nine-Phoenix King's light flickered, and he flew off in another direction.</p><p>The other demon kings, overjoyed, immediately followed.</p><p>Soon, the Nine-Phoenix King landed on a bare, rocky mountain.</p><p>The mountain was unremarkable.</p><p>The slopes were gentle, barely reaching a hundred feet in height. Judging by its base, the mountain should have been imposing, but its top seemed to have been sliced off by a sword, leaving an unusually wide platform.</p><p>The summit platform was equally barren.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King stood on the peak, looking up at the sky.</p><p>The void was chaotic, filled with turbulent energy that converged into grayish-black clouds, obscuring the sun.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Nine-Phoenix King forced out a drop of blood, merging it with the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Demonic fire reappeared, soaring into the sky.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King quickly formed hand seals, channeling them into the demonic fire. The fire began to contract inwards, gradually taking the shape of a fire phoenix.</p><p>A strange aura emanated.</p><p>The fire phoenix cried out.</p><p>The Nine-Phoenix King seemed to be straining. As soon as the fire phoenix formed, he released it, guiding it with hand seals.</p><p>The fire phoenix spread its wings and soared skyward.</p><p>Under the tense gaze of the demon kings, the fire phoenix plunged into the clouds, leaving only faint, flickering sparks.</p><p>The next moment, the wind howled and the clouds churned, forming a vortex that grew larger and larger.</p><p>A fierce wind raged, and the demon kings activated their true essence for protection, all looking towards the Nine-Phoenix King.</p><p>When the vortex reached several tens of feet in diameter, its depths unfathomable, the Nine-Phoenix King finally spoke, "Go!"</p><p>The demon kings flew into the vortex together.</p><p>After a dizzying spin, the surrounding chaotic sounds abruptly ceased. The demon kings felt their bodies lighten as they entered an unfamiliar region.</p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p>Seeing the scene before them, the Flood Dragon King gasped.</p><p>The other demon kings also changed color, their bodies tense, standing motionless.</p><p>They were on a mountain, surrounded by a gloomy wind and darkness. As they had learned previously, this should be the Inner Sanctum of the Seven Slaughters Hall.</p><p>What made the demon kings' hair stand on end was the sight of large and small spatial rifts floating nearby, like gaping maws waiting to devour everything.</p><p>These spatial rifts were irregular, some as thin as silk, others spanning the sky like clouds.</p><p>They even saw, not far away, a slender, snake-like spatial rift twisting and turning – a mobile spatial rift.</p><p>Among these, there were countless hidden spatial rifts, the most dangerous of all.</p><p>Seeing this, the demon kings' scalps tingled, and they felt the urge to turn back. In this terrifying place, even they had to be cautious, lest they lose their lives.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King, relatively calm, looked around for a moment and said gravely, "This terrain doesn't match any of the information I gathered. This mountain shouldn't be within the area explored by humans. With so many spatial rifts, it seems our luck isn't good. We've entered the depths of the Inner Sanctum…"</p><p>"You're not thinking of forcing our way through this place, are you?" The armored giant's voice was dry, his heart filled with apprehension.</p><p>"Let's confirm the location of the True Dragon's remains first. If it's not too far, we should definitely try. Look, the space on the ground is more stable than above. As long as we're careful and don't fly here, we can definitely get out…"</p><p>The Flood Dragon King pointed towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p>The demon kings looked and saw that there were indeed fewer spatial rifts there, but the area was filled with miasma, swamps, and flickering barrier lights – likely not a safe place either.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please protect me."</p><p>The Flood Dragon King made his decision and prepared to cast the Dragon's Call technique.</p><p>They were standing before a stone wall, the entrance to the secret realm. They didn't have to exit from here, but the Nine-Phoenix King was busy making arrangements.</p><p>The other demon kings dispersed to keep watch.</p><p>Once everyone was ready, the Flood Dragon King held the dragon bone, chanted silently, and cast the Dragon's Call. Golden light emanated from his palm, slowly merging into the bone.</p><p>As the technique progressed, the dragon bone became dazzling, as if plated with gold.</p><p>Then, the Flood Dragon King's eyes widened, and he spat out a golden glow that entered the bone.</p><p>In an instant, the golden glow and light intertwined and erupted, faintly echoing with dragon roars. The demon kings, prepared, moved to conceal the phenomenon, but a certain fluctuation could not be hidden.</p><p>Fortunately, the surroundings remained quiet, and no beasts were attracted by the fluctuation.</p><p>The Flood Dragon King held the dragon bone, eyes closed, focusing on sensing the location of the True Dragon's remains.</p><p>Time slowly passed.</p><p>With every moment, the Flood Dragon King's complexion worsened and his aura weakened, showing the considerable toll the technique took.</p><p>Finally, he opened his eyes, a glint flashing within them.</p><p>The dragon bone in his palm was leaping, as if trying to escape his grasp. The Flood Dragon King withdrew the technique, the golden light gradually fading, and the bone settled down.</p><p>"I found it!"</p><p>The Flood Dragon King turned towards the direction the bone pointed, exclaiming with delight, "As expected, there are dragon remains in the Inner Sanctum, and they're not far. Moreover, from what I can tell, that direction is towards the exit of the Inner Sanctum. It seems the place where that Nascent Soul cultivator obtained the dragon bone is near the remains. The further we go in that direction, the less dangerous it becomes."</p><p>The demon kings had specifically learned about the terrain of the Inner Sanctum.</p><p>The Inner Sanctum was vast, and humans had only explored a small portion near the entrance.</p><p>Although humans treated the Inner Sanctum as their forbidden territory, some information had leaked out, enough to piece together a rough map. The Flood Dragon King's words were true; that direction was indeed towards the exit, the safest area in the entire Inner Sanctum.</p><p>The demon kings were tempted. As long as they didn't go deeper, even if they encountered human Nascent Soul cultivators, the risk would be much lower, worthwhile for the True Dragon's remains. The Flood Dragon King and the Nine-Phoenix King had risked not being able to return by sneaking into the Boundless Sea; why should they hesitate?</p><p>"As agreed, we'll take turns scouting the path. Do you have any objections, fellow Daoists?" The Flood Dragon King asked.</p><p>The demon kings exchanged glances.</p><p>The armored giant shook his head. "Agreed! You just used the technique, and your true essence hasn't recovered yet. I'll take the first stretch."</p><p>With that, the armored giant walked down the mountain, the other demon kings ready to assist.</p><p>"Thank you, Black." The Flood Dragon King bowed his hands.</p><p>Noticing the Nine-Phoenix King's concerned gaze, the Flood Dragon King transmitted a message, "Don't worry, my injuries have healed, thanks to the spirit medicine you brought back from the Seven Slaughters Hall last time."</p><p>Just then, the armored giant sent a message, and the demon kings set off.</p>
