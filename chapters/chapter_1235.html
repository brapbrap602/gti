<h1>Chapter 1227: The Fire Lotus Seed</h1><p>At the peak of Divine Peak.</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiang Qing sat like clay statues on either side of the Ancestral Sacred Flame. One was deeply engrossed in cultivating a secret technique, while the other was fully focused on activating the grand formation to restrain the Ancestral Sacred Flame.</p><p>Below the Divine Peak, Wu Youdao led a group of disciples from the Azure Sun Demon Sect, standing guard in a battle formation, ready to follow orders at any moment. They occasionally glanced up at the mountain peak, whispering among themselves.</p><p>"The Sect Master has been in seclusion at the peak for several months now, not even going to the front lines. Could something have gone wrong when suppressing the Ancestral Sacred Flame earlier?"</p><p>"Suppressing it? Before, we were allowed to go up the mountain to absorb the Azure Sun Essence, but after the so-called suppression, we're no longer permitted to go up. It doesn't seem like it's been suppressed at all."</p><p>Among the disciples, only Wu Youdao knew some of the truth, but they were all clever individuals. From the sect's strange behavior, they could sense that something was amiss.</p><p>Wu Youdao gazed up at the peak, listening to the disciples' murmurs but not stopping them. Not long ago, the Sect Master had sent a message, saying that this time, they would definitely resolve the sect's hidden danger once and for all. After this, there would be no need to hide anything anymore!</p><p>Thinking of this, Wu Youdao felt a surge of excitement.</p><p>Since he had joined the sect, he had known that the Ancestral Sacred Flame was on the verge of losing control. It was like a dark cloud hanging over the Azure Sun Demon Sect, suffocating everyone within.</p><p>The Azure Sun Demon Sect both revered and feared this spiritual flame left behind by their founder. It had once repelled invading enemies and protected the sect, but now it had become a dire threat, capable of destroying the Divine Peak and severing the sect's foundation.</p><p>It was all because the later generations were incompetent, with no one able to subdue the Ancestral Sacred Flame, leading to an irreversible situation.</p><p>Xiang Qing had ventured deep into the battlefield, facing death and emerging to break through to the Nascent Soul stage. They had thought they could finally suppress the Ancestral Sacred Flame, but to their dismay, Xiang Qing could only temporarily restrain it.</p><p>"I wonder what method the Sect Master has thought of. Could it be related to that old ancestor from the Demon Flame Sect?" Wu Youdao pondered.</p><p>He remembered that after the Demon Flame Sect's ancestor had visited, it seemed he had never left.</p><p>"I hope this gets resolved soon! Otherwise, if we're not allowed to go up the mountain, and we have to rely on the unified distribution of Essence Crystals, it's barely enough to sustain our cultivation. The most frustrating part is that Essence Crystals are hard to preserve. If something happens and they're not refined in time, they'll dissipate," someone sighed, eliciting murmurs of agreement.</p><p>"Exactly! I've lost them twice already. It's so painful!"</p><p>"Is there really no other place in the world where Azure Sun Essence Crystals exist?"</p><p>"Essence Crystals are formed from the descent of Heavenly Essence from the Nine Heavens. Even the Sect Master doesn't have the ability to ascend and collect Heavenly Essence. And Heavenly Essence isn't limited to just Azure Sun Essence. Legend has it there are thirty-six types. Even if Essence Crystals exist elsewhere, they might not be Azure Sun Essence Crystals. The Sect Master must have searched everywhere already..."</p><p>These disciples of the Azure Sun Demon Sect cultivated day and night using Azure Sun Essence Crystals and were quite knowledgeable about Heavenly Essence.</p><p>"The Sect Master has been in seclusion for so long this time. He must have a solution. Maybe before, it wasn't that he couldn't suppress it, but that he didn't want to!" someone snorted.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone's eyes lit up.</p><p>"Didn't want to suppress it? Could it be that the Sect Master plans to refine the Ancestral Sacred Flame?"</p><p>"Then the Sect Master's strength would..."</p><p>...</p><p>Regardless of the commotion below the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang had refined another portion of the Ancestral Sacred Flame and summoned the fire seed.</p><p>A bluish-green fire seed hovered before him, shaped like a lotus seed, though only partially formed, with the rest still illusory.</p><p>Apart from initially using the Nine Nether Demon Flame to condense a rudimentary fire seed as a catalyst, Qin Sang had been solely focused on refining the Ancestral Sacred Flame during this period.</p><p>At this moment, the Ancestral Sacred Flame's fire was still fierce, but its main body had shrunk significantly compared to a few months ago.</p><p>With its power greatly diminished, the Ancestral Sacred Flame was no longer as difficult to deal with.</p><p>Using the original formation, Xiang Qing only needed to put in some effort to reseal the Ancestral Sacred Flame. Then, he could gradually refine it while improving his own strength, thereby resolving this major threat.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang stop, Xiang Qing looked over, "Is this enough?"</p><p>The condition for Qin Sang's assistance in suppressing the Ancestral Sacred Flame was that he could refine it as he pleased. Over a month ago, Xiang Qing could have sealed the Ancestral Sacred Flame himself, but since Qin Sang hadn't stopped, he had allowed him to continue.</p><p>"It's enough! Thank you, Fellow Daoist Xiang, for your generosity!"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fire seed, stored it in his dantian, and nodded in response.</p><p>Previously, he had estimated that he would need to use the Ancestral Sacred Flame to condense the Fire Lotus Seed before he could refine the Nine Nether Demon Flame.</p><p>After studying the Azure Sun Demon Sect's secret techniques, Qin Sang could refine the demon flame more efficiently, making it easier to subdue than before. Thus, he no longer needed to wait for the Fire Lotus Seed to fully form.</p><p>Not long ago, news had come from the Boundless Valley that the disturbances in the Blood Lake's seal were becoming more frequent.</p><p>Since Qin Sang's journey to the Abyss Ruins nearly two years ago, Old Demon Ye's progress had been slow, indicating how sturdy the Blood Lake's seal was. The Two Realms Alliance had been quietly observing and preparing, unwilling to assist in breaking the seal, preferring to let Old Demon Ye expend as much energy as possible.</p><p>Before entering the Blood Lake, Qin Sang needed to refine the Nine Nether Demon Flame as quickly as possible and gain control over more demon banners, so he decided to end his efforts early.</p><p>Xiang Qing smiled broadly, stood up, and bowed, "Fellow Daoist Mingyue, your words make me ashamed! Your actions are equivalent to saving our sect's legacy. The weight of this matter is self-evident. I should be the one thanking you!"</p><p>Both of them had resolved a major problem and shared a hearty laugh.</p><p>After a brief rest, Qin Sang bid farewell.</p><p>He first went to the Demon Flame Sect to remind Zhao Shanran to focus on nurturing disciples and laying a solid foundation, avoiding overambition. Then, he visited the Phantom Mist Sect, only to find Bai still in seclusion, so he returned to Triple Pass.</p><p>After being away for several months, Triple Pass remained unchanged. Qin Sang called over some juniors to offer guidance before going into seclusion again.</p><p>He took out the complete demon banner given by his senior sister and began refining the demon flame with practiced ease.</p><p>The "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique was indeed extraordinary. Two completely different spiritual flames could coexist peacefully within the fire seed as long as Qin Sang followed the secret technique to refine them.</p><p>The two spiritual flames did not truly merge into a new flame with combined properties.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense stirred the fire seed, and a bluish-green flame appeared at his fingertip, then turned black, shifting back and forth effortlessly.</p><p>The flame then dispersed, transforming into a thin veil, its shape shifting endlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a deep connection with the spiritual flame, a sensation entirely different from controlling it through the Ten Directions Demon Banner. Everything was under his command, leaving no room for mistakes when using it in battle.</p><p>However, with his current cultivation, it was impossible for him to refine all the Nine Nether Demon Flames within the demon banners. For now, he still had to rely on the demon banner formation. His current goal was to gain control over more demon banners.</p><p>Days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in his quiet chamber, wholly focused on refining the demon flame. Li Yufu and the others had been instructed not to disturb him unless something major occurred.</p><p>Several more months went by.</p><p>The last illusory part of the Fire Lotus Seed was finally filled with spiritual flame!</p><p>Next, he would continuously nourish it with his divine sense, allowing the spiritual flame to nurture the Fire Lotus Seed. When the time was ripe, the Fire Lotus Seed would "sprout," entering the next stage and forming a bud.</p><p>Qin Sang stored the demon banner, rested for a moment, then flashed out of the Cold Bell Formation alone.</p>
