<h1>## Chapter 167: The Demon Servant</h1><p>Within the mountain pass.</p><p>The silver glow on the stone tablet faded, the sealing power greatly diminished.</p><p>The Demon Lord's screams turned into maniacal laughter.</p><p>Imprisoned beneath the tablet for countless years, finally breaking free.</p><p>His laughter echoed through the valley, filled with unrestrained joy.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The stone tablet trembled.</p><p>The seal was broken, revealing a flaw; a crack appeared in the center of the tablet, but it didn't shatter. Instead, it slowly began to mend itself.</p><p>At this moment, a bizarre sight emerged from beneath the tablet.</p><p>A mass of black energy transformed into a grotesque face, shifting between laughter and a savage grimace, its expression terrifying. Chains bound the face.</p><p>The chains rattled loudly, their luster dimming as if about to break.</p><p>“The secret technique you promised us…”</p><p>The three alliance leaders shouted urgently, poised to intervene.</p><p>The Demon Lord wasted no words. Three streaks of light shot out, each heading towards one of the leaders. Simultaneously, the black energy swirled, pulling the defenseless Su Nü towards him.</p><p>The three leaders each caught a streak of light, sensing a profound and wondrous secret technique within.</p><p>“It’s real!”</p><p>The Western Frontier Alliance Leader quickly verified its authenticity. The restless True Essence within him calmed the moment he activated the secret technique. He even sensed a loosening of his bottleneck, filling him with immense delight.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The Demon Lord, still bound by chains, burst forth from the stone tablet and entered Su Nü’s body through her forehead.</p><p>Su Nü's face was filled with terror. Her eyes rolled back, her expression froze, then contorted in agony.  Marks resembling the chains that bound the Demon Lord appeared on her body.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>The three alliance leaders exchanged glances, their faces hardening.  They shouted in unison!</p><p>A ring-shaped restraint appeared around Su Nü's waist, and an ethereal sword energy erupted from her wrist.</p><p>A shocking scene unfolded.</p><p>The Northern Star Alliance Leader’s ring-shaped restraint tightened rapidly. The sword energy, left by the Eastern Peak Alliance Leader, didn't strike Su Nü. Instead, the blade turned and slashed fiercely at the Northern Star Alliance Leader's restraint.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>The Northern Star Alliance Leader glared at the Eastern Peak Alliance Leader, instantly realizing something was amiss. Without a second glance at the Demon Lord, he retreated without hesitation.</p><p>Just then, the sound of chains rang in his ears.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>A sense of foreboding washed over the Northern Star Alliance Leader. He spat out a streak of light.</p><p>A fiery red saber expanded in the wind, slashing towards his side. However, it struck only air. A chilling pain pierced his abdomen.</p><p>A flying sword had wounded him.</p><p>The Northern Star Alliance Leader recognized the sword; it was the Eastern Peak Alliance Leader's lifebound spirit sword!</p><p>The Eastern Peak Alliance Leader watched his former companion coldly, his expression indifferent, devoid of emotion, as if he had just ambushed a stranger.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>A slender hand pierced through the Northern Star Alliance Leader’s chest from behind, clutching his still-beating heart.  Blood gushed forth, a gruesome crimson.</p><p>Su Nü, whose body was now occupied by the Demon Lord, held the heart in her hand.</p><p>She no longer appeared weak. Her hand was stained with blood, her eyes filled with greed and madness; she had become someone else entirely.</p><p>The chain marks on her skin grew more prominent.  Yet, she was able to move freely from the stone tablet, assaulting the Northern Star Alliance Leader.</p><p>The Northern Star Alliance Leader’s eyes lost their light.</p><p>In the next moment, his Nascent Soul leaped from his skull, looking around in confusion before rushing towards the exit of the mountain pass. But his opponents were prepared. The Eastern Peak Alliance Leader's lifebound spirit sword lay in wait.</p><p>Countless bright sword lights formed a powerful sword formation in the void, its menacing aura enveloping the Nascent Soul.</p><p>Alarmed, the Nascent Soul flickered and instantly reappeared far away, escaping the sword formation's range.</p><p>This wasn't due to the Northern Star Alliance Leader’s speed, but a powerful innate ability of a Nascent Soul cultivator upon leaving their body.</p><p>However, using this ability came at a cost, severely depleting one's vital energy.  Thus, cultivators typically resorted to it only in the direst of circumstances.</p><p>Therefore, it was also known as the ultimate escape technique.</p><p>In this desperate moment, the Northern Star Alliance Leader had no other choice.</p><p>His Nascent Soul teleported, attempting to flee the mountain pass. But before he could take another step, Su Nü's beautiful face appeared before him.</p><p>The Demon Lord, seemingly anticipating the Nascent Soul's teleportation point, was waiting. A jade hand reached out, radiating a powerful restraining force.</p><p>The Nascent Soul's face was ashen, powerless to resist as the Demon Lord seized it.</p><p>Then, the Demon Lord's figure flickered and disappeared, reappearing at the exit of the mountain pass, blocking the Western Frontier Alliance Leader’s path. He tossed the Northern Star Alliance Leader’s Nascent Soul into his mouth.</p><p>The Demon Lord chewed on the Nascent Soul, a look of relish in his eyes, as if savoring a delectable treat.</p><p>“Interesting…”</p><p>The Demon Lord looked at the Western Frontier Alliance Leader, a sinister smile spreading across his face.</p><p>Just a moment ago, when the three alliance leaders had agreed to attack, the Western Frontier Alliance Leader hadn't made a move, nor had she activated the restraint on Su Nü.  Instead, she had attempted to flee.</p><p>If they hadn't been powerful enough to swiftly eliminate the Northern Star Alliance Leader, and if the Demon Lord hadn't been so fast, she might have escaped.</p><p>The Western Frontier Alliance Leader gritted her teeth, tense and wary, slowly retreating.</p><p>Witnessing the horrifying sight of the Demon Lord consuming a Nascent Soul, her face paled, her eyes filled with terror.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The sound of something cutting through the air came from behind. The Eastern Peak Alliance Leader blocked her retreat, his expression impassive.</p><p>“Traitor! You’ve sided with the demon!”</p><p>The Western Frontier Alliance Leader, backed against the stone wall, shouted angrily.</p><p>The Eastern Peak Alliance Leader remained unmoved.  He said coldly, “The Bai Li clan has served Lord Demon Lord for generations!”</p><p>“Heh heh…”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled.  “It's not that he betrayed you. In truth, I planted a demonic seal on him years ago, transforming him into my Demon Servant, utterly loyal to me. If I hadn't been sealed and weakened, barely able to act on him alone, all of you would have fallen into my grasp. Unfortunately, once he reached the late Nascent Soul stage, he might have broken free of the demonic seal and escaped my control.  So, I had to treat you all equally regarding the cultivation technique, allowing him to remain hidden among you.”</p><p>Hearing this, the Western Frontier Alliance Leader showed no surprise.  A cold smile appeared on her face.  “I knew neither of you were trustworthy!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The Demon Lord expressed surprise.</p><p>The Western Frontier Alliance Leader turned towards the exit of the mountain pass and shouted, “Are you not going to act?  How long are you going to wait?”</p><p>“Haha, I’ve been waiting outside.  However, the situation changed so quickly. Before I could react, fellow Daoist Qing Yun had already fallen behind… No wonder you dare call yourself the Demon Lord!”</p><p>Within the stone forest.</p><p>The mist churned as a figure slowly emerged. It was the Demon Master.</p><p>The Demon Master strode forward, his pace deceptively quick, appearing at the entrance to the mountain pass.</p><p>Facing the Demon Lord, his expression remained relaxed and composed. His gaze swept over the scene, landing on the Northern Star Alliance Leader's corpse, his face unchanged.</p><p>“Late Nascent Soul stage?”</p><p>The Demon Lord paused, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>The Eastern Peak Alliance Leader’s lips moved slightly, transmitting a message through sound transmission.</p><p>Seeing only the Demon Master appear, the Western Frontier Alliance Leader’s heart sank. She angrily demanded, “Why didn't you save fellow Daoist Ji?”</p><p>The Demon Lord was too powerful.  The two of them alone couldn't possibly suppress him!</p><p>The Demon Master certainly had the power to save the Northern Star Alliance Leader, yet he hadn't acted.</p><p>“No rush,”</p><p>The Demon Master said calmly.  “Help is on the way. Besides, don't you have a backup plan?”</p>
