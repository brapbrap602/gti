<h1>Chapter 799: The Heavenly Demon's Body Refinement</h1><p>“Before that, there's something else I need to do. Given the strange phenomena caused by the bone flute, it's best to stay away from other cultivators. I should find a deserted island…”</p><p>Qin Sang flew from Lei Chen Island, chose a direction, flew far away, and found an uninhabited islet.</p><p>There were no signs of cultivator activity nearby. Qin Sang landed silently, set up a barrier, and then took out his finds.</p><p>A pouch, a star conch, an armguard…</p><p>Qin Sang was actually quite interested in the hooked-nose man's wings, but they had vanished when he died.</p><p>He casually picked up the pouch and scanned it with his spiritual sense, a surprised expression crossing his face.</p><p>Given the hooked-nose man's strength, his belongings should have been quite substantial.</p><p>In fact, the pouch only contained a pile of spirit stones, and some miscellaneous items. Most of it was various types of demon bones. While valuable, it didn't quite match his strength.</p><p>Qin Sang had most hoped to find the hooked-nose man's body refinement technique.  The man had cultivated his physical body to such a formidable level, clearly demonstrating the technique’s value.</p><p>If the technique suited him, cultivating the body wouldn't be a bad path.</p><p>But Qin Sang searched everywhere, and found neither body refinement techniques nor secrets for cultivating wings.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow furrowed deeper and deeper. Suddenly, he looked up at the star conch and picked it up.</p><p>He noticed a commonality: the items in the pouch were similar to the star conch—all raw materials, showing no signs of artificial refinement.</p><p>“This man didn't rely on any magical treasures at all. Did he emulate the ancient body cultivators, taking a purely physical cultivation path, not relying on any external objects, his power derived solely from his flesh?”</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>In ancient times, a hundred schools of thought contended, countless paths to power vied for supremacy, all capable of achieving astonishing feats.</p><p>The huge palm print he had seen in Zi Wei Palace, which had annihilated the fairy city, had been suspected by Yun Youzi to be the work of a top-tier body cultivator mastering the Heavenly Transformation Divine Ability.</p><p>Human cultivators, unlike demonic beasts, did not have the inheritance of powerful bloodline power.</p><p>In ancient times, countless secret techniques existed, and immortal medicines were plentiful. Now, it was extremely difficult to find even moderately valuable spirit medicines.  Taking a purely physical cultivation path would be exponentially more difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the star conch, understanding its nature. He realized his earlier guess had been correct: the star conch was indeed a strange treasure that needed time to charge.</p><p>The star conch was not artificially refined, but seemed to be the shell of some strange conch demon.</p><p>By storing the star conch within his body and continuously refining it, pouring his spiritual energy into it, when encountering an opponent, launching the star conch would unleash astonishing power.</p><p>The star conch's power was directly related to the cultivator's cultivation level and the duration of refinement.  It wasn't as simple as just pouring in spiritual energy; it required a complex process, consuming vast amounts of effort and refinement.</p><p>Qin Sang placed the star conch in his dantian and sensed it, immediately feeling a chill of fear.</p><p>The hooked-nose man must have used it once before. This time, the refinement hadn't been long, otherwise, it wouldn't have just destroyed the Jin Yao Lock.</p><p>Of course, the star conch's power was limited. Even if Qin Sang refined it to the maximum extent he could control, it wouldn't reach the level of the fire pearl, but it was still extremely formidable.  Used unexpectedly, it could directly kill a late-stage cultivator.</p><p>Since the star conch was a natural object, it was difficult to assess its grade, but its value definitely far exceeded that of a mid-grade magical treasure.</p><p>Its only drawback was that it could only be used once per encounter. If it missed, it would be useless for a short time.</p><p>Because the star conch was naturally formed, Qin Sang faced no obstacles and easily controlled it. He left it in his dantian to slowly refine spiritual energy.</p><p>Besides the star conch, a tortoise shell token caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>The tortoise shell token was about the size of a palm. The front had natural patterns, while the back had several strange runes, clearly added later.</p><p>These runes were strange, and Qin Sang couldn't decipher them. Sensing the tortoise shell token's aura, it didn't feel like a human artifact, and it didn't possess powerful energy, so he put it away.</p><p>Apart from that, the other materials were also quite valuable, including several rare items.  As a refiner, he could make the most of them.</p><p>Putting away the useful things, Qin Sang took a deep breath and picked up the armguard.</p><p>The armguard was woven from demon bones and was extremely hard. Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword, activated its sword energy, and struck directly at the thickest part of the armguard.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The armguard shattered, and a section of a round bone flute fell out.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled silently, took out the two original sections of the bone flute, and brought them together.</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The bone flute fused automatically. A flash of light flowed across its surface, then it fell silent.</p><p>Qin Sang looked doubtful, secretly wondering if he hadn't collected all the fragments yet.  He tried infusing his spiritual sense and True Qi into it.</p><p>The next moment, an astonishing sight appeared.</p><p>The bone flute trembled violently, then radiated light, bright as stars, extremely dazzling, almost breaking through the restrictive spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang was both surprised and delighted.</p><p>Before he could react, the starlight suddenly condensed.</p><p>A text composed of starlight appeared before Qin Sang.</p><p>"This is...?"</p><p>Qin Sang moved the bone flute, and the text rippled and moved with it, like water.  The flute itself, however, still showed no powerful abilities. He understood: the flute wasn't a treasure, but something like a jade slip, containing this text.</p><p>A jade slip, broken into three fragments, separated by thousands of miles – that's strange.</p><p>It wasn't a treasure.  Qin Sang felt somewhat disappointed, but focused on the text.  He quickly discovered, to his surprise, that it was written in demonic script!</p><p>After the Cang Lang Sea and the Demon Sea connected, human cultivators had found demonic realms and ancient treasures in the Demon Sea, so they were not unfamiliar with demonic script. They had also studied it extensively using ancient texts.</p><p>For convenience, Qin Sang had also learned some demonic script, though his knowledge was shallow.  Understanding the entire text was difficult, but he could make out parts of it.</p><p>"Titled 'Celestial Demon Body Refinement'… using the power of the celestial stars to refine oneself… refining star煞 with bloodline power also has a refining effect… This is a cultivation technique for demons!"</p><p>After reading the entire text, Qin Sang was greatly disappointed.</p><p>No wonder the bone flute contained the power of the stars. The technique is related to the celestial stars; the flute could serve as a guide, helping cultivators begin their practice and draw celestial stellar power into their bodies.</p><p>A demonic cultivation technique, requiring bloodline power, naturally unusable by humans.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the treasure he had obtained after so much trouble was a cultivation technique he couldn't use.</p><p>'Celestial Demon Body Refinement' – the name alone is grand.</p><p>In ancient times, Celestial Demons were top-tier existences, comparable to cultivators at the Great Ascension stage!</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed through it, but he could confirm that this technique was certainly a top-tier demonic cultivation technique from ancient times, a once-secret technique!</p><p>No matter how good the technique was, if he couldn't practice it, it was just useless paper.</p><p>"Wait… something's wrong…"</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have discovered something. His gaze sharpened, fixed on the text.</p>
