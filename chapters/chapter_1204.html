<h1>Chapter 1196: Journey Alone</h1><p>After a lengthy and secretive discussion, the Serpent King added several more conditions, but Qin Sang rejected them all. Qin Sang was not lacking in magical treasures. His Ebony Sword was on the verge of transforming into a supreme-grade treasure, and the power of his Demon Banner was no less formidable, ensuring that he wouldn't need to worry about acquiring treasures during his Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang truly had no intention of going and wasn't merely haggling, the Serpent King could only bid farewell with regret.</p><p>After seeing off the Serpent King, Qin Sang thought to himself that he couldn't wait indefinitely for the Ebony Sword. He decided to set off as soon as possible, allowing the sword to refine itself gradually along the way. Upon arriving in the Sin Abyss, he would keep a low profile to avoid unnecessary trouble. If the Serpent King and his companions stirred up any commotion in the Sin Abyss, leading to heightened security, Qin Sang might suffer collateral damage.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang quickly arranged his affairs. He found Jing Lin and the others, informing them that he would be leaving for a while. Though they were reluctant, they understood they had no grounds to stop him. Fortunately, the Sin Abyss's momentum had waned recently, and the Zen Spirit had retreated into its shell.</p><p>"Master, I've already refined the Azure Phoenix Thunder Force, and my Thunder Evasion technique has greatly improved. I can even feel the bottleneck to the late stage loosening. If you venture into the dragon's den alone and encounter trouble, wouldn't it be difficult to handle everything by yourself? I am willing to serve you with all my heart and soul, following your every command."</p><p>Before his departure, Fat Chicken came to Qin Sang, shamelessly begging to be taken along.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Fat Chicken and said, "Aren't you afraid that if we're pursued by a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss, I might throw you out as bait?"</p><p>Fat Chicken's expression stiffened, and he replied with difficulty, "If it means securing a chance for Master to escape, I am willing to die!"</p><p>It was unclear whether Fat Chicken truly believed his own words.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered but decided to bring Fat Chicken along, thinking he might prove useful.</p><p>Less than half a month after the Serpent King's departure, Qin Sang set off. According to his planned route, he couldn't cut straight through enemy lines. Instead, he would cross the grasslands into the Sin Abyss, but it was safer to detour through the vast desert, even if it took more time.</p><p>He first headed west, crossing the Stone Bend Mountains and arriving near the Hukou Pass, where the demon race was stationed. The Sin Abyss's defenses here were much laxer. Qin Sang found a gap and quietly left the Skywalk Plateau. The surroundings grew increasingly desolate as he entered the Gobi Desert, eventually reaching the endless expanse of yellow sand.</p><p>The desert was unbearably hot, a stark contrast to the cold Skywalk Plateau. Between the massive sand dunes, scorching winds blew, and the beginnings of a sandstorm began to form.</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared atop a dune, frowning as he gazed ahead at the yellowish haze signaling the approaching sandstorm. An invisible barrier seemed to surround him, keeping the wind and sand at bay, as if the terrifying sandstorm was nothing to him.</p><p>This figure was none other than Qin Sang. Observing the path ahead, he murmured to himself, "The patrols are becoming fewer. After a while, I should be able to travel at full speed without worry."</p><p>With his cultivation level, he had little to fear unless he encountered a Nascent Soul cultivator from the Sin Abyss. Considering that this area was already under Sin Abyss control, Qin Sang kept a low profile to avoid unnecessary trouble, which naturally slowed his progress.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In an instant, the sky darkened as the sandstorm swept in.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his figure flickering and disappearing, effortlessly passing through the storm. After flying for a while, a patch of green suddenly appeared in his vision.</p><p>"Another oasis, and the spiritual energy seems quite dense..."</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang activated his Concealment Technique and flew toward the oasis.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang stood atop a green mountain at the center of the oasis, surveying the surrounding ruins. He let out an almost imperceptible sigh.</p><p>This place had clearly once been the site of a cultivator sect. Now, the sect's gates had been destroyed by the Sin Abyss, and the fate of its disciples was unknownâ€”whether they were dead or alive, scattered to the winds.</p><p>Fortunately, the Sin Abyss hadn't gone so far as to slaughter mortals. The mortals in the oasis could still survive, though without the protection of cultivators, life in the desert was much harsher.</p><p>Throughout his journey, Qin Sang had encountered similar scenes repeatedly. The cultivators of the desert had long fallen under the blade of the Sin Abyss.</p><p>"What exactly is the Sin Abyss trying to achieve? And what about the Old Demon Ye? Is their goal merely to dominate the Northern Star Realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and continued onward.</p><p>The vast desert seemed endless.</p><p>This journey also served as a form of cultivation for Qin Sang. While his primary focus was on traveling, he would occasionally pause to observe the desert's unique landscapes. He even ventured deep into the desert to interact with the desert's cultivator community and understand the influence of the Sin Abyss here, hoping to gain as much insight as possible.</p><p>Along the way, he witnessed the cultivator sects of the desert and learned many unique desert cultivation techniques. One of the top sects, with a Nascent Soul cultivator at its helm, had a long and illustrious history, rivaling the renowned sects of the Little Cold Domain.</p><p>Unfortunately, this sect had originally been located near the Sin Abyss in an oasis. Forced by circumstances, they had abandoned their mountain gate and retreated deep into the desert to avoid disaster. Fortunately, the Northern Star Desert was vast enough that the Sin Abyss's reach couldn't extend to every corner.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang, however, was that the Sin Abyss had the capability to wage war on two fronts!</p><p>During his travels, Qin Sang happened to meet the sect's Grand Elder. Though their encounter was brief and neither probed into the other's secrets, they exchanged insights on the Dao, each gaining something from the conversation. Afterward, Qin Sang quietly departed.</p><p>The desert was filled with secret realms and forbidden lands, but Qin Sang had no interest in exploring them for treasures. Traveling in this manner, stopping and starting, it took him nearly two months to traverse the Northern Star Desert diagonally and enter the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Even in wartime, the Sin Abyss dared not let its guard down. Cultivators stationed at the sect frequently patrolled, forcing Qin Sang to slow his pace once more. This allowed him to gradually familiarize himself with the Sin Abyss's landscape, enriching his senior sister's geographical maps as he slowly made his way toward the Near Scar Mountain.</p><p>Contrary to the bloody, corpse-strewn demonic realm depicted by the Two Realms Alliance, the heart of the Sin Abyss was a place where mortals lived in peace and prosperity.</p><p>Unlike the Little Cold Domain, where cultivator sects were concentrated on both sides of the Heaven's Scar, the Sin Abyss employed a different strategy toward mortals. They sent low-level disciples with no hope of advancing in cultivation to serve as rulers, managing the mortal world and selecting talented individuals for cultivation.</p><p>Yet, for some reason, warfare among mortals was still common.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't delve too deeply into this. After gaining a general understanding, he quickened his pace.</p><p>The Near Scar Mountain's sect was located on the eastern bank of the Heaven's Scar.</p><p>After repeatedly avoiding patrols, Qin Sang finally laid eyes on the legendary Heaven's Scar!</p><p>The sight before him was indeed awe-inspiring, worthy of its name as the Heaven's Scar!</p><p>The earth here had split open, forming a chasm a thousand miles wide and unfathomably deep, reaching down to the Nine Netherworlds! One couldn't help but wonder if, one day, the two landmasses would completely separate.</p><p>Endless white mist rose from the depths of the Sin Abyss, making it difficult even for cultivators to see the opposite bank, even with their spiritual energy infused into their eyes. Floating within the mist were fragments of ancient restrictions, glowing with strange and mysterious colors.</p><p>Most cultivators dared not attempt to cross the Heaven's Scar directly through the air. At the narrowest points of the scar, various factions had established teleportation arrays. Though these arrays couldn't match the range of ancient teleportation formations, they were perfectly suited for this purpose.</p><p>"What a magnificent Heaven's Scar!"</p><p>Qin Sang marveled.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>There will be another chapter today, though it will be posted later.</p>
