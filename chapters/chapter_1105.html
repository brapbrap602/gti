<h1>Chapter 1097: The Corpse King</h1><p>"This place..."</p><p>Bai suddenly emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag, staring blankly at the Immortal Graveyard.</p><p>He slowly walked toward a severely damaged stone tablet, crouched down, and gently touched the inscriptions on it.</p><p>The stone tablet had long been ruined beyond recognition, its inscriptions illegible.</p><p>Bai touched the tablet for a long time before murmuring, "For some reason, seeing these graves doesn't bring back any new memories, but I feel an indescribable emotion..."</p><p>Qin Sang stood silently by his side.</p><p>Bai's body was that of a refined corpse, making it impossible to discern his expression.</p><p>But from his tone, Qin Sang detected a hint of sorrow.</p><p>The Immortal Graveyard was vast and boundless, filled with countless graves, eerily similar to the place where Bai had been trapped.</p><p>In the Purple Mist Forbidden Land, who knew how many remains were sealed away?</p><p>After a moment, Bai stood up. Instead of retreating into the Corpse Puppet Bag, he walked side by side with Qin Sang.</p><p>Bai's gaze swept over the graves, his eyes filled with melancholy.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, had no time to dwell on the past.</p><p>He knew how dangerous the Immortal Graveyard was. Ghost Kings with strength comparable to mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators lurked within. Once, a Nascent Soul ancestor named Dongyun Xian had been entangled by a Ghost King, giving Dongyang Bo quite a spectacle.</p><p>He summoned the Ebony Sword and the Six Demon Banner Formation, ready to swiftly eliminate any ghosts they encountered to avoid being surrounded and alerting the Ghost King.</p><p>Compared to him, Bai moved as if strolling through a garden, completely at ease.</p><p>After traveling for some time, they had reached the depths of the Immortal Graveyard.</p><p>At that moment, Bai suddenly paused and turned to look to the right.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of tension. He knew Bai's capabilities.</p><p>In a place filled with ghostly energy, Bai's strength would increase significantly, far surpassing Qin Sang's spiritual senses.</p><p>Bai's expression was peculiar. "I think I've sensed a fellow practitioner."</p><p>"A fellow practitioner?"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then realized something and exclaimed, "The Heavenly Corpse Talisman?"</p><p>Bai nodded. "Over the years, although I haven't completely broken the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, I've gained some insights and can harness a portion of its power. Just now, I sensed the fluctuations of a refined corpse, very similar to the Heavenly Corpse Talisman."</p><p>"I've searched the Cold Domain for years and found no sects with a heritage similar to the Heavenly Corpse Sect. What you sensed is likely a refined corpse controlled by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted, and he said with delight, "I haven't left any refined corpses here. It might have been left by another Heavenly Corpse Sect cultivator! A refined corpse controlled by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman is most likely a living corpse, with higher intelligence than other refined corpses. It's not surprising that it has survived in the Immortal Graveyard until now. Of course, if it's another fellow practitioner from the Heavenly Corpse Sect, capturing them would give us a chance to find clues!"</p><p>"I'll go take a look..."</p><p>Bai nodded, his figure flickering as he disappeared into the ghostly energy, heading in that direction.</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>Qin Sang warned.</p><p>He didn't have the ability to conceal himself in the ghostly energy and could only slowly approach.</p><p>Before long, the ghostly energy around Qin Sang rippled, and Bai reappeared, delivering a shocking message: "It's not just a simple living corpse. It's a Corpse King, and an unclaimed one at that!"</p><p>"A Corpse King? How is that possible?"</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>According to the Heavenly Corpse Sect's heritage he had obtained, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman could at most control a Corpse Fiend comparable to a Foundation Establishment cultivator. Through the Corpse Core Technique, it could be forcibly elevated to a Flying Yaksha, but no further.</p><p>He had conducted experiments in the Witch God Continent, attempting to control a Core Formation cultivator with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, only to have the talisman shatter and the soul dissipate.</p><p>He suspected that the Heavenly Corpse Sect controlled higher-level refined corpses not through the Heavenly Corpse Talisman but through other talismans or treasures. He never expected to encounter a Corpse King controlled by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman here.</p><p>"Could I have underestimated the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned in deep thought.</p><p>He believed that, in the art of refining corpses, few cultivators below the Nascent Soul stage could surpass him. Yet, he had misjudged this.</p><p>Could a Corpse King-level refined corpse have been left behind by a Heavenly Corpse Sect leader?</p><p>"Since it's a Corpse King, we should avoid provoking it. We can come back later to capture it and investigate further."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>He also wanted to unravel the mysteries of the Heavenly Corpse Talisman as soon as possible to save Mute Girl.</p><p>A Corpse King was a formidable existence that even Nascent Soul ancestors dreaded, especially in the Immortal Graveyard teeming with ghosts. Retreating was the wise choice.</p><p>However, as soon as Qin Sang finished speaking, Bai raised his hand to stop him.</p><p>"Wait! Have you forgotten my abilities? I observed that the Corpse King's intelligence is low. With the ghostly energy here, we might be able to try and kill it. Even if we can't defeat it, I can use the ghostly energy to cover our escape. It won't be difficult to shake it off."</p><p>"The Corpse King's body is harder than steel. Even with the ghostly energy, you won't be able to harm it, let alone kill it."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Taking such a risk was meaningless.</p><p>The two of them were no match for a Corpse King.</p><p>Bai, however, was unwilling to give up. He earnestly said to Qin Sang, "Although it's a Corpse King, its intelligence is lacking, making it no different from an inanimate object. If it were any other Corpse King or Ghost King, I wouldn't dare entertain such thoughts. But this one is different. Since it has the Heavenly Corpse Talisman within it, I can try to use the talisman to restrict its strength and movements. On the contrary, here, my strength is even greater than in the Purple Mist Forbidden Land. If we join forces, we might stand a chance. Of course, even if we can keep the Corpse King at bay, it won't benefit us. We'll need a decisive final blow!"</p><p>Before Bai could finish, Qin Sang understood his plan.</p><p>The only means to harm the Corpse King was the Twelve Demon Banner Formation.</p><p>"Based on my previous experience, I can barely activate the Twelve Demon Banner Formation with a bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid. However, I only have one bottle left, which I originally intended to give to you. Are you sure you want to use it now? If we fail to defeat the Corpse King, it will be wasted."</p><p>At the foot of Yitian Peak.</p><p>He had taken two bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid from the Four Saints Palace disciple, only consuming one.</p><p>The remaining bottle, the Four Saints Palace disciple hadn't mentioned, so Qin Sang naturally kept it for himself, planning to give it to Bai.</p><p>Last time, in a rush, he had barely formed the Fire Lotus and had to consume two bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid to barely control the Twelve Demon Banner Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that one bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid should be enough to stabilize the formation now.</p><p>"I feel that the Soul Cleansing Liquid won't be of much help to me. Let's take the risk and capture the Corpse King. Perhaps we can uncover some secrets of the Heavenly Corpse Sect!"</p><p>Bai said without hesitation, his tone urgent.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Bai, understanding his desire to escape his predicament as soon as possible.</p><p>He then thought of the Soul Nurturing Wood Bai always carried.</p><p>The effects of the Soul Nurturing Wood were no worse than the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>"Alright! Since you're willing to take the gamble, I'll join you!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate further and agreed.</p><p>Capturing the Corpse King would benefit him as well!</p><p>Bai was overjoyed upon hearing this.</p><p>Without delay, the two carefully discussed their plan, prepared an escape route, and stealthily approached the Corpse King.</p><p>Bai concealed himself and scouted the surroundings. If there was a second Corpse King-level presence nearby, they would have to abandon their plan.</p>
