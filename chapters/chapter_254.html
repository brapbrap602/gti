**Chapter 247:Illusory Notes**

Ultimately, the Myriad Phantom Sound transformed into a formidable hurricane that instantly blew the flying monkeys surrounding Qin Sang all over the place, carving out a path for him.

However, the earth-shaking hordes of monkeys quickly overwhelmed Qin Sang again.

Unable to advance very far, Qin Sang was forced to slow down and deal with the attacking flying monkeys.

Although the Myriad Phantom Sound was the esteemed Ground Deficiency's power, now controlled by Qin Sang, the elder could not provide any assistance. Whatever danger he faced, Qin Sang had to adapt and react on his own.

Fortunately, he was not a secluded cultivator who had never left his cave; he had ample experience fighting for his life. No matter how desperate the situation became, he could remain calm and composed.

Upon engaging in combat, Qin Sang gained a direct impression of the flying monkeys' strength.

They were even more formidable than he had imagined, and they were only just beginning to merge together. The Myriad Phantom Sound's power was rapidly depleting, and if this trend continued, he would definitely not be able to pick the Crimsonvine Fruit.

However, from what Ground Deficiency had said, it didn't seem like he had actually expected Qin Sang to obtain the fruit. The old ghoul had instructed him to hold out for a certain amount of time, as if he had other plans.

The Myriad Phantom Sound was extremely versatile; countless weapons, such as swords, spears, and shields, formed around Qin Sang, appearing like flowers of illusion that bloomed and withered away. However, as more and more flaming flying monkeys merged together, the pressure intensified, and the Myriad Phantom Sound's power was being consumed at an alarming rate.

'Boom!'

A gigantic staff, shaped like a fiery dragon, suddenly thrust forward from the periphery, cleaving the air with astonishing force.

The Divine Monkey brandished his Myriad Ton Staff!

This staff attack had emerged without warning. Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. This attack was terrifying. Its wielder had merged with an unknown number of flying monkeys, and its strength surpassed Qin Sang's wildest imagination.

This was why Qin Sang had been convinced that he would not be able to obtain the Crimsonvine Fruit. The further he advanced, the more flying monkeys would be alerted and merge together, and their strength would soar. Even if Ground Deficiency personally intervened, it would be difficult for him to reach the Crimsonvine, let alone with the limited Myriad Phantom Sound power at Qin Sang's disposal.

"Explode!"

Qin Sang roared in anger.

He dared not hesitate and released all of the Myriad Phantom Sound power within him without reserve. At the same time, he retreated rapidly.

Around Qin Sang, vast sound waves surged outward. They were clearly visible to the naked eye, and the terrifying fluctuations churned up towering waves, transforming into destructive energy. The surrounding flying monkeys were swept away by the sound waves, annihilated and reduced to their original fire essence.

However, under Qin Sang's urging, the vast majority of the Myriad Phantom Sound surged upward, hastily meeting the gigantic staff overhead.

'Rumble!'

The two forces collided, creating a deafening roar that shook the heavens and the earth. After the thunderous explosion, a ripple of energy spread out in all directions. Amidst this chaos, a faint shadow of a staff appeared, which descended lightly toward him.

Although this staff shadow seemed as if it would collapse at any moment, it still possessed an intimidating power that sent shivers down Qin Sang's spine. It slammed into the remaining Myriad Phantom Sound that enveloped Qin Sang, shattering it.

The Myriad Phantom Sound's protective barrier cracked and was covered in fissures. Fortunately, the staff shadow's power had been exhausted as well, and with a slight tremor, it dissipated on the spot.

Qin Sang grunted and his complexion darkened. When he saw that the terrifying figure in the air had raised his staff again, his heart skipped a beat. A sword light suddenly burst forth from his forehead, and the Ebonywood Sword shot out. Qin Sang's figure flashed, combining with the sword to form a long rainbow that retreated toward the edge of the lava lake without looking back.

The situation was urgent, leaving him no choice but to use the Ebonywood Sword.

'Swoosh!'

The sword light barely managed to slip through the flying monkeys' blockade and escape.

Qin Sang landed on a black rock by the shore, his body swaying as he struggled to standç©©. His face was extremely pale, and the Myriad Phantom Sound barrier around him flickered before shattering completely.

Originally, the situation had been under Qin Sang's control, but this unexpected event had caught him off guard.

He had not expected the flying monkeys to have the cunning to hide and merge together before launching a surprise attack. Fortunately, he had remained vigilant and reacted quickly enough to escape unharmed.

The restrictions around the lava lake were incredibly strong. Even when attacked by the merged flying monkeys, they remained unyielding. The giant monkey brandished its staff furiously and roared at Qin Sang from outside.

Qin Sang glanced at it but ignored it. He returned to the stone steps, calmed himself, and turned to look at Ground Deficiency.

The Ghost hovered there cross-legged, his eyes shut tight, motionless, and seemingly lost in thought. Qin Sang glanced at the stone steps behind him, hesitated for a moment, then sat down cross-legged, repairing the hidden wounds in his body.

A moment later, the old man opened his eyes and looked at Qin Sang meaningfully. "The strength of that mutant monkey is so formidable that even I find it tricky. Fortunately, Brother Qin is sharp."

Qin Sang understood that the old man had figured something out. He had an excuse ready. "The intelligence of these monkeys far exceeds any I have encountered before. They can not only merge with each other, but they also know how to lurk and launch sneak attacks. There are probably even more complex tricks in store. I fear I won't get very far with just the power of your Thousand Illusions Divine Sound."

The old man nodded and, without another word, stretched out his right hand, letting a stream of Thousand Illusions Divine Sound power gather in his palm, then throwing it to Qin Sang.

"Brother Qin, use the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound to investigate the monkeys' lair."

Qin Sang took it and sensed it carefully, surprised to find that the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound was no stronger than before, but it emitted a strange fluctuation that had not been there previously.

This fluctuation was very similar to the one emitted by the flying monkeys!

This is...

Qin Sang absorbed the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound into his body, thought about it, and the divine sound emerged outside his body, transforming into a layer of dark red flames, turning him into a human torch.

Or rather, a fire monkey, albeit a strange-looking one. These flames were not real but simulated by the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound.

Qin Sang suddenly realized what the old man had in mind.

The Ghost would let him confront the monkeys inside, while he waited outside, sensing the power fluctuations from the monkeys and analyzing them with all his might, using the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound to disguise himself. Once the Ghost had figured out the monkeys, he could use the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound to disguise himself as a fire monkey, blend in with them, silently sneak into the center of the lava lake, and pick the fruit.

Qin Sang proceeded towards the lava lake once more.

The flying monkeys in the lava lake were getting impatient from not seeing Qin Sang. As soon as he reappeared, Qin Sang noticed that the monkeys at the edge of the lava lake looked at him with confusion, hesitated for a moment, then suddenly went wild.

It really works!

Qin Sang was amazed by the old man. No wonder he was called the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound, he had such bizarre powers!

He was forced back again by the flying monkeys.

Qin Sang used the Thousand Illusions Divine Sound to make his illusionary flames more similar to the flying monkeys.

He tested and adjusted the flames again and again.

The final time, Qin Sang escaped from the lake in a sorry state. By then, hundreds of gigantic flying monkeys were hovering around the lava lake, making it as dangerous as a dragon's lair.

The old man suddenly got up.
