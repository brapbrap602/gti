Are you looking to purchase elixirs or magical artifacts, or perhaps sell some treasures…?”</p><p>At this moment, the manager surnamed Liu noticed a token Qin Sang discreetly displayed. His pupils constricted, and his attitude immediately became warm. He repeatedly urged, “Please come in, Daoist friend. Let’s discuss this in private!”</p><p>“Very well.”</p><p>Qin Sang followed Manager Liu to a private room on the second floor.</p><p>Manager Liu activated the restriction, sat opposite Qin Sang, and offered some spiritual tea. “So it’s Daoist Qingfeng. Although I’ve always stayed in this remote area of Dayu Island, I’ve heard of you. I never expected to meet Daoist Qingfeng. Today I realize that reputation doesn't do justice to the reality!”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, “I only did some insignificant tasks for Old Master Zou in the Demon Sea.  Due to my cultivation, I haven't appeared in the world for decades. It's surprising that Manager Liu still remembers me.”</p><p>Old Master Zou was a pillar of the Qiongyu Trading Company, so it wasn't strange that Manager Liu knew him. Qin Sang hadn't expected him to have heard of himself.</p><p>After leaving Poison Island, Qin Sang rarely interacted with people from the Trading Company. Only Old Master Zou knew about his plan to challenge the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Manager Liu laughed heartily, offering more compliments before asking, “Daoist Qingfeng, what brings you to my humble abode? I have some reputation amongst the Daoists in this area.  Anything within my power, I will do my utmost to help.”</p><p>“Manager Liu, you exaggerate.”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped beating around the bush and got straight to the point: “I need a batch of spiritual herbs.  Due to the urgency, I must gather them quickly.  These herbs are not commonly found, and it's difficult for me to acquire them alone. I can only ask the Trading Company and Manager Liu for help…”</p><p>He produced a jade slip and handed it to Manager Liu.</p><p>Manager Liu, understanding the rules, didn't ask about Qin Sang's purpose and took the jade slip.</p><p>After reviewing the list of herbs, Manager Liu frowned, appearing troubled.</p><p>Qin Sang understood his hesitation and added, “Manager Liu, rest assured, after the herbs are gathered, I will purchase them at the original price with spirit stones.  I won’t put you in a difficult position.”</p><p>Hearing this, Manager Liu smiled, readily agreeing, “Daoist, I trust you completely! However, the list contains many types of herbs, and our branch only has some of them in stock. To gather all of them, we must purchase from other trading companies or urgently request them from other branches. Daoist, you'll have to stay on the island for a few more days.”</p><p>“How long?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, frowning.</p><p>Manager Liu pondered for a moment, then spread his hand, “Daoist, if you are in a hurry, I will immediately order my subordinates to act. In five days, we should be able to gather more than 80%.”</p><p>“Three days.  As much as you can gather. Please trouble yourself, Manager Liu.”</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>He was at a crucial stage in refining the Demon Banner.  Since he had already been delayed, staying on Dayu Island for a few more days wouldn't hurt. Once the Demon Banner was refined, his strength would improve again.</p><p>“By the way, I heard from Old Master Zou that he was planning to challenge the Seven Killing Hall, seeking a breakthrough. Now that it has been so long since the Seven Killing Hall closed, does the company have any news of Old Master Zou?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked with feigned concern.</p><p>He wanted to find out where Old Master Zou's tomb was.</p><p>He had items left by Old Master Zou, but he wasn't ready to reveal them. It would be easy to arouse suspicion and cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p>He would find a chance later to secretly give the items to Old Master Zou's descendants at his grave.</p><p>“Old Master Zou entered the Seven Killing Hall?”</p><p>Manager Liu was shocked, showing admiration and some shame, “I thought Old Master Zou, like myself, had given up hope and lost the will to seek the Dao. I never expected Old Master Zou to have a change of heart and take such a gamble. The Seven Killing Hall is extremely dangerous, but with Old Master Zou's strength and strategy, he will certainly overcome danger and return safely! In the future, our company might have another Yuan Ying stage expert…”</p><p>Qin Sang echoed his words, but inwardly sighed.</p><p>Apparently, the company hadn't confirmed Old Master Zou's death. After all, it was possible that Old Master Zou had gone into seclusion immediately after leaving the Seven Killing Hall, otherwise, the news of his death would have already arrived.</p><p>“Please, Manager Liu, also inquire. If you have any news of Old Master Zou, please inform me immediately…”</p><p>Manager Liu nodded repeatedly, “I will send someone immediately. I am also very curious. If Old Master Zou can form a Yuan Ying, we will have a great patron! Given your relationship with Old Master Zou, you will certainly gain his favor.  I hope you will give me some assistance in the future.”</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang took his leave.</p><p>Manager Liu ordered a maid to take Qin Sang to the company's cave for cultivation.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang leave, the smile on Manager Liu's face disappeared, his eyes shifting. He quickly returned to the private room, sat down, pondered for a moment, took out a small bell, and gently shook it.</p><p>The bell was silent.</p><p>After a moment, a ripple appeared in the void of the private room, and a black shadow slowly emerged.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the cave dwelling and dismissed his attendants.  Instead of going inside immediately, he strolled through the market.</p><p>He visited various shops, occasionally purchasing necessities. His main purpose was to take Bai sightseeing, allowing him to experience the current cultivation world.</p><p>"The current world is so impoverished. Even Golden Core cultivators are so rare," Bai remarked after a long silence.</p><p>"Now you understand the difficulty of gathering those spirit herbs, right? Besides the ones I selected, you'll have to rely on luck at large trading events for the rest," Qin Sang said calmly.  "In the Canglang Sea, a Nascent Soul cultivator is at the peak of their power.  The Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages are like thousands of soldiers crossing a narrow bridge. If it weren't for the Canglang Sea discovering the Demon Sea and refining the Demonic Beast Pill, the number of Golden Core cultivators would be even smaller."</p><p>Bai sighed softly. "Let's go back! There's nothing more to see in this small city. If there's a chance, could you take me to Tianxing City, which you've praised so highly…?"</p><p>"Good," Qin Sang nodded, returning to the cave dwelling.</p><p>The cave dwelling assigned to him by the Liu family steward was ideally located, with abundant spiritual energy, making it a prime cultivation spot. The furnishings were also exquisite, resembling a mansion.</p><p>Ignoring his surroundings, Qin Sang added several layers of restriction barriers outside the cave dwelling, then took out six demonic banners.</p><p>Days of continuous refinement had made him quite familiar with the six demonic banner array.  Soon, he would be able to expertly control the demonic fire as if it were an extension of his own body.</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh…'</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banners swirled upwards, forming a flag formation before Qin Sang.  The Nine Nether Demonic Fire shot out from the banner surfaces, converging into a mass in the center, far more powerful than before. The demonic flames danced wildly, as if a demon lurked within.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly cast a spell, pointing at the demonic fire. Under his control, the Nine Nether Demonic Fire gradually calmed, slowly gathering in the center. Then, under his guidance, it dispersed and condensed, transforming endlessly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, three days passed.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Qin Sang swept his sleeve, collecting all the banners.  He glanced at the cave dwelling and strode out.</p>
