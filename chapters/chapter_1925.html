<h1>Chapter 1916: Rainbow's Appearance and Disappearance</h1><p>Qin Sang followed behind a host of ghosts and deities.</p><p>This was a rarely trodden mountain path, the wild grasses within the mountains reaching a man's height.</p><p>It was said that by following this mountain path, one could reach Zeyang Prefecture in the east. However, apart from daring merchants seeking a shortcut and martial artists confident in their skills, few dared to traverse this route, gradually leading to its further desolation.</p><p>The screech of an owl sounded like a ghostly wail.</p><p>A group of 'ghosts' were indeed silently proceeding along the mountain path.</p><p>The rugged path posed no challenge to them.  The group of ghosts and deities successively crossed several mountains, then suddenly veered off the path, following a valley deeper into the mountains.</p><p>The deep mountains and dense forests were shrouded in thick night mist.</p><p>After hurrying along for a while, a small path paved with bluestone slabs appeared ahead.</p><p>The path spiraled and snaked upwards, disappearing into the forest.</p><p>After rounding a bend, the ghosts and deities didn't continue forward but instead restrained their auras, quietly approaching a mountain wall.</p><p>Gao Xu raised a hand and performed a hand seal.</p><p>The surface of the mountain wall bulged, rippling like brocade, transforming into a square human face. Its eyes rolled, and upon seeing the group of ghosts and deities, quickly receded inward, while the mountain wall silently opened.</p><p>Gao Xu led his subordinates into the mountain wall.</p><p>“Greetings, City God!”</p><p>Inside the mountain wall, as if hollowed out, existed a considerable space, filled with ghosts and deities who bowed to Gao Xu.</p><p>Two figures led the group, a man and a woman.</p><p>The man wore black armor, appearing valiant, while the woman donned a white robe and skirt, equally stern. They were Wu Pan and Wen Pan, Gao Xu’s chief enforcers, second only to the City God in the City God Temple.</p><p>“What’s the situation with the demonic horde on the mountain?”</p><p>Gao Xu asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“We’ve investigated thoroughly.  They’re a group of fox demons, with considerable cultivation. The Daoists of Jade Cypress Temple have likely been slaughtered by these demons. Their evil deeds warrant punishment,” Wu Pan stated angrily.</p><p>Wen Pan calmly added, “This afternoon, two martial artists passed by this area and were captured by the fox demons and taken into the temple. To avoid alerting them, we didn't intervene.”</p><p>Gao Xu nodded. “Based on their past actions, they certainly know we prioritize mortals. They’ll likely only absorb some Yang Qi from those two mortals and then release them, not killing them. I fear the Daoists in the temple have met a grim fate!”</p><p>In this region, the Divine Dao and the Immortal Dao coexisted.</p><p>As long as Immortal Dao cultivators didn't slaughter commoners, cultivate demonic arts, or practice evil techniques like blood sacrifices, and instead diligently cultivated in the mountains, the ghosts and deities wouldn't actively seek them out.</p><p>The mountains and the lowlands were like two halves of yin and yang. Unless they had personal connections, both sides generally kept to themselves.</p><p>The Daoists on this mountain were no exception, cultivating in seclusion year-round, with only the temple master occasionally visiting Gao Xu.</p><p>At some unknown point, the temple had been usurped by a group of fox demons, and the whereabouts of all the Daoists were unknown.</p><p>Jade Cypress Temple was far from the mortal world, and these fox demons had concealed themselves well. The ghosts and deities of Beikuo County hadn't initially noticed them.</p><p>However, some impatient lesser demons descended the mountain to abduct mortals, using demonic enchantments to absorb their Yang Qi for cultivation.</p><p>Although those mortals survived, they inevitably suffered from lethargy and disorientation. With the increasing number of such cases, the Yin Messengers finally noticed and began a secret investigation.</p><p>Upon investigation, Gao Xu was startled to discover that quite a few rogue cultivators around Beikuo County had mysteriously disappeared. Most were solitary cultivators with few friends, clearly specifically chosen targets.</p><p>All clues pointed to Jade Cypress Temple.</p><p>Such a tragedy happening under his jurisdiction, even if the missing were all cultivators, Gao Xu couldn't ignore it.</p><p>“Is the Spirit Binding Formation ready?”</p><p>Gao Xu looked at Wen Pan.</p><p>Wen Pan confirmed and added, “As per your previous instructions, we’ve ascertained that these fox demons are still using Jade Cypress Temple’s original formation. There’s not much damage within the temple. The Daoists of Jade Cypress Temple were likely caught off guard, allowing the demons to infiltrate and attack from within. The strength of these fox demons shouldn't be as formidable as anticipated.”</p><p>“But we can't underestimate them. The Jade Cypress Temple Master was a late-stage Foundation Establishment expert, with several powerful techniques, yet even his Daoist sanctuary was seized,” Gao Xu shook his head, flicking his sleeve, and a silver talisman flew out. “I’ve personally inscribed a Mountain Suppressing Incantation. We must overwhelm these demons in one fell swoop, not letting a single one escape!  Once the fox demons send those two people out of the temple, act immediately!”</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>Wu Pan and Wen Pan bowed, each assigning half of the Yin Messengers. Their figures then plunged downwards, disappearing into the ground.</p><p>They waited until dawn.</p><p>Several white shadows suddenly ran down the mountain.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, they were three snow-white fox cubs, hopping and skipping on the bluestone path, occasionally chasing each other into the grass, playfully making chirping sounds.</p><p>These three adorable fox cubs each had a cloud of white mist floating above their heads, and within the mist were two unconscious men in black.</p><p>Both men were physically robust, with swords at their waists, clearly possessing martial arts skills, yet they were at the mercy of the little foxes.</p><p>Their eyes were sunken, their complexions pale, but their faces bore smiles as if immersed in sweet dreams or savoring something.</p><p>The three fox cubs carried them to the mountain path, away from Jade Cypress Temple, found a patch of wild grass, and left the unconscious duo there.</p><p>The two were under a spell and wouldn't remember anything upon waking.</p><p>On their return journey, a gust of Yin wind suddenly swept up the three fox cubs.</p><p>“Yip!”</p><p>“Yip!”</p><p>The fox cubs shrieked, struggling to break free, but they were firmly bound by the Yin wind, their cries unable to penetrate it. They were instantly carried away.</p><p>At this time, Gao Xu returned to the bluestone path, with only the mountain gods and earth deities remaining by his side.</p><p>Not far ahead, the bluestone path abruptly ended. Cultivators could see a small temple at the end.</p><p>The temple was nestled within the forest, quite serene, a place that should have been a tranquil sanctuary.</p><p>Gao Xu glanced left and right.  “Summon the fog!”</p><p>The earth deities responded in unison.</p><p>They each held a staff carved with a dragon's head at the top, a symbol of the earth deity's authority, sometimes called the Earth God's Crook, sometimes the Earth Measuring Staff.</p><p>The earth deities raised their Earth Measuring Staffs, shaking them towards the mountain below, and mist gathered, gradually rising to engulf the mountaintop, forming a curtain of fog.</p><p>This place was far from human habitation. A minor spell was sufficient to conceal the unusual phenomena of the impending battle.</p><p>As the mist rose, Gao Xu pinched the silver talisman, tossing it upwards, and simultaneously shouted.</p><p>“Move the mountain!”</p><p>The mountain gods acknowledged the command, merging into the ground and disappearing.</p><p>The next moment, the earth trembled, the surrounding mountains shook, and one peak swayed violently, rocks tumbling down.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning struck out of the clear sky, and that mountain astonishingly surged upwards by hundreds of feet.</p><p>A closer look revealed that it wasn't the peak growing taller, but the entire mountain being uprooted, its base severed, lifted by the mountain gods' power!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Gao Xu performed a hand seal, and the silver talisman embedded itself into the mountain, its surface seemingly plated with silver, incredibly heavy!</p><p>Within Jade Cypress Temple.</p><p>The quiet rooms that once belonged to the Daoists were now occupied by the fox demons, who were startled by the commotion outside.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>White shadows burst out of the doors, revealing over thirty fox demons, all white foxes.</p><p>Anxious cries came from the courtyard, quickly turning into screams of terror.</p><p>Inside the temple, some fox demons stood upright like humans, while others hadn't shed their beastly forms.</p><p>All the fox demons stared blankly at the sky above the temple, which, along with the temple itself, was enveloped by an enormous shadow.</p><p>It was a mountain, hurtling down towards them!</p><p>‘Yip!’</p><p>The fox demons felt intense fear, even the older foxes were filled with panic.</p><p>Gao Xu’s divine eyes, sharp as lightning, saw the fox demons within Jade Cypress Temple. He snorted coldly, “The strongest is only late-stage Demon Spirit, yet they dare to wreak havoc within this City God’s domain!”</p><p>With the strength of Beikuo County’s ghosts and deities, subduing these fox demons wouldn’t be difficult. The concern was that there might still be survivors within the temple, and in desperation, the fox demons might unleash their savagery, slaughtering indiscriminately. Hence, he directly employed the Mountain Moving Divine Ability to breach the formation and capture the fox demons!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The silver mountain tore through the air, smashing towards the peak where the temple stood.</p><p>The fierce wind snapped the trees in the mountains. The collision of the two mountains would undoubtedly be earth-shattering, and these fox demons would likely be buried alive.</p><p>By the time they realized the impending danger, it was too late. They could only see the severed base of the silver mountain.</p><p>As the silver mountain was about to descend, the terrified fox demons, in their panic, could only desperately activate Jade Cypress Temple’s grand formation.</p><p>A beam of cyan light shot out from the temple, transforming into a towering cypress tree in mid-air.</p><p>The cypress was lush and vibrant, its vast crown enveloping the entire temple.  Its branches swayed, scattering specks of cyan light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Just as the cypress materialized, the silver mountain crashed down.</p><p>In an instant, the cypress erupted with dazzling cyan light, broken branches and leaves falling like rain. Ultimately, it couldn’t withstand the silver mountain, buckling under the immense weight, emitting cracking sounds as cracks spread across its trunk.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Finally, under the horrified gazes of the fox demons, the cypress shattered with a loud crack, cyan light scattering everywhere.</p><p>The fox demons weren’t the masters of the temple and weren’t truly familiar with its grand formation.  Their hasty activation was easily broken by the silver mountain's single strike!</p><p>Gao Xu had anticipated this.  He pointed a finger, and the silver mountain, having breached the formation, halted in mid-air.</p><p>The terrified fox demons, devoid of any fighting spirit, scattered and fled in all directions, their escape routes haphazard.</p><p>Before they could escape the courtyard walls, billowing black mist and Yin wind surged from all directions, pouring into the temple.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Chilling Yin wind and impenetrable black mist filled the temple.</p><p>Not only did it obscure vision, but it also affected the fox demons’ spiritual senses. The weaker fox demons were instantly disoriented.</p><p>Panicked cries echoed continuously.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A black chain suddenly shot out from the black mist, heading straight for a dazed fox demon.</p><p>The fox demon, powerless to resist, was instantly bound by the chain and dragged into the depths of the black mist, its cries silenced.</p><p>Gao Xu also entered the temple, his gaze swiftly sweeping across each quiet room, searching for survivors.</p><p>Without needing the City God’s command, the earth deities took action.  They tapped their Earth Measuring Staffs on the ground, and green light rose beneath the fox demons, sprouting vines that bound them tightly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, only the most powerful fox demons could still struggle.</p><p>Wu Pan and Wen Pan led the Yin Messengers, appearing and charging directly at the remaining fox demons. Their battle formations shifted continuously, easily isolating the fox demons and attacking them individually.</p><p>No matter how potent the fox demons’ demonic arts were, they gradually lost ground against the combined assault of the ghosts and deities.  Moreover, their specialty was enchantment, not combat, and now they had no opportunity to utilize it.</p><p>One by one, the fox demons were captured, not even requiring Gao Xu to intervene.</p><p>Gao Xu remained vigilant against any greater demons that might be lurking, but ultimately, no unexpected events occurred.</p><p>He noticed a quiet room and flashed over, raising a hand to dispel the demonic enchantment on the door before pushing it open.</p><p>Inside, he saw more than a dozen cultivators, all familiar faces, standing or sitting.</p><p>However, the number of cultivators who had disappeared during this period far exceeded this group, and only two Daoists remained in Jade Cypress Temple. The others, including the temple master, were still missing!</p><p>The condition of these cultivators wasn't good either. Their cultivation was suppressed, their faces pale, their vital essence greatly depleted.</p><p>Gao Xu waved his hand, dispelling the demonic enchantments on them. Two immediately collapsed to the floor.</p><p>"The other fellow Daoists..."</p><p>"Master, they... they were all drained of their vital essence by those fox demons! City God, you must avenge us, kill those fox demons, avenge Master and Grandmaster!"</p><p>The remaining Daoists of Jade Cypress Temple wailed in grief.</p><p>Gao Xu sighed, returning to the courtyard to see that all the fox demons had been apprehended, shackled, not a single one escaping.</p><p>He scanned the temple, a nagging feeling that something wasn't quite right. He pointed at the oldest fox demon. "Bring it forward!"</p><p>…</p><p>Just as the ghosts and deities appeared, preparing to breach the temple’s formation…</p><p>In the innermost quiet room of Jade Cypress Temple, originally the Jade Cypress Temple Master’s cultivation chamber, sat a young man.</p><p>The young man had rosy lips and white teeth, possessing exceptional features, a handsome youth with a mid-stage Golden Core cultivation.</p><p>His eyes were closed, deep in meditation, when suddenly, he sensed something, opening his eyes with a slight furrow in his brow.</p><p>“They came quickly! Hmph! I knew those vixens couldn't resist. They must have taken advantage of my closed-door cultivation to harass mortals again, exposing themselves. The Beikuo County City God has some skill. I can only abandon these foxes!  Pity my injuries haven’t fully recovered. Without the fox demons aiding me, replenishing my Yang Qi will be troublesome…”</p><p>The young man shook his head, covering his mouth with a cough, and retrieved a small wooden figurine.</p><p>A drop of blood seeped into it, and the figurine erupted in bloody light, enveloping the young man.</p><p>The young man gradually became translucent, transforming into a bloody shadow, finally vanishing completely.</p><p>On another nearby mountain, a small tree suddenly withered, revealing the young man’s figure. He had silently escaped the encirclement, unnoticed even by Gao Xu.</p><p>The young man took out another talisman, its surface emitting faint electrical arcs and rainbow hues.</p><p>With a slap of his palm, he transformed into a faint rainbow light, disappearing into the morning mist, faster than lightning.</p><p>Even if Gao Xu had discovered him, he likely couldn't catch him.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang stood atop a mountain peak, witnessing the entire scene.</p><p>The young man’s cultivation was even higher than Gao Xu's, yet he abandoned the foxes and fled without a fight, surprising him.</p><p>Even more surprising was the talisman the young man used!</p><p>Qin Sang reached out with a grasping motion.</p><p>The young man, propelled by the talisman, suddenly felt his body constrict, his head spinning as he crashed heavily to the ground.  Looking up, he saw a Daoist standing before him.</p><p>He was quick-witted, rolling over and kowtowing repeatedly. "Spare me, Senior! Spare me!"</p><p>“This Rainbow's Appearance and Disappearance Talisman, where did you learn it?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The Rainbow's Appearance and Disappearance Talisman was a type of thunder talisman recorded in the Five Thunders Emissary's Seal!</p><p>"Rainbow… Is Senior referring to this Rainbow Lightning Talisman?"</p><p>The young man trembled, not daring to conceal anything. "This junior was originally from Ji Kingdom. After the great sect, Leixiao Sect, fragmented, its scriptures and techniques spread throughout the land. Cultivators around Ji Kingdom know a bit of thunder magic. This talisman's method, this junior exchanged for it from the Five Hues Sect using a family heirloom scripture…"</p>
