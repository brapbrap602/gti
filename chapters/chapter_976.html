<h1>Chapter 968: Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix</h1><p>After leaving the cave dwelling, King Nine Phoenix headed straight for the deepest part of the Seven Kills Hall.</p><p>She would occasionally stop to manipulate the glass bead, altering and adjusting her direction.</p><p>After several turns, King Nine Phoenix unexpectedly brought them to the edge of the outer hall.</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall also had inner and outer sections, different from the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>The area outside the Purple Micro Palace and the area where the Heavenly Mountain was located inside were only connected by some kind of restriction; the inside and outside didn't seem to be the same space.</p><p>The Seven Kills Hall, however, was a single entity.</p><p>Only the inner hall's powerful celestial prohibitions were impossible to forcibly break.  One could only wait for the Seven Kills Hall to open itself; only then would the celestial prohibitions lift, allowing entry.</p><p>Because of this, the areas inside and outside the prohibitions were called the inner and outer halls by cultivators.</p><p>“King Nine Phoenix wouldn't be thinking of breaking into the celestial prohibitions, would she?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at her in surprise.</p><p>He hadn't been able to find a chance to escape and had been dragged here.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix stood at the edge of the celestial prohibitions, gazing intently at the ubiquitous clouds, silent, making her intentions unfathomable.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered what King Nine Phoenix had said earlier—she possessed a Feather of the Heavenly Phoenix, which could break through space and enter the Seven Kills Hall without using the paths opened by cultivators.</p><p>Could she have a way to open the celestial prohibitions and sneak in?</p><p>The methods of the demon race were no less skillful than those of humans.</p><p>Although these demonic beasts weren't truly direct descendants of ancient divine beasts, merely possessing a trace of divine beast bloodline that awakened after cultivation, they still had a chance to obtain certain supernatural powers.</p><p>Especially a transformed demon like King Nine Phoenix.</p><p>She might truly be capable of things that cultivators couldn't.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't the least bit interested in King Nine Phoenix's intentions; whatever treasures she took from the inner hall had nothing to do with him.  Those treasures weren't something he could covet anyway.</p><p>He just wanted to get rid of this pestilence as quickly as possible.</p><p>King Nine Phoenix stared fixedly at the depths of the celestial prohibitions, her pupils flashing with strange light. The glass bead in her hand vibrated frequently, the drop of golden blood within surging.</p><p>The bead seemed to be sensing something, about to break through space and leave.</p><p>After a long time, King Nine Phoenix let out a long sigh, a look of intense surprise appearing in her eyes.</p><p>After a moment's contemplation, King Nine Phoenix took out some phoenix banners and said to the Rainbow-clad Fairy, “I will place these phoenix banners around to form a large formation. When I attempt to break the prohibitions, I will use the formation to conceal any unusual phenomena that might arise from the backlash of the prohibitions. However, I need to concentrate on another matter. If the backlash of the prohibitions is too strong, it might impact the phoenix banners. You will need to help me stabilize them then. I will teach you how to manipulate the phoenix banners. Before I successfully break the celestial prohibitions, you must keep the phoenix banner formation stable, lest you attract cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage.”</p><p>With that, King Nine Phoenix gently tossed her hand.</p><p>The phoenix banners scattered, expanding rapidly in the wind, transforming into gigantic banners several meters tall.  Seven-colored phoenixes in full flight were painted on the banners, vibrant and lifelike.</p><p>‘Whoosh whoosh whoosh…’</p><p>The banners were planted on the surrounding mountain peaks.</p><p>The demons followed suit.</p><p>Qin Sang silently leaped onto a mountain peak and landed beneath a banner.</p><p>His gaze swept across the demons; he hadn't expected King Nine Phoenix to actually try breaking the celestial formation. He secretly thought this might be an opportunity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yuan Zhu and the other demons also took their positions on the surrounding peaks.</p><p>“Divine Phoenix Appears!”</p><p>King Nine Phoenix shouted loudly.</p><p>All the phoenix banners trembled, and the phoenixes on the banners came alive, emitting clear phoenix cries.  Immediately afterward, illusory phoenixes flew out from the banners, soaring above the demons.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>Another loud shout, and the illusory phoenixes in the sky shattered.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Qin Sang felt a strange power appearing around him.</p><p>He looked around; it seemed no different from before, the distant Heavenly Tower clearly visible. But he understood that the power of the phoenix banner formation had already been activated.  Cultivators looking in from outside would only see an illusion.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged beneath a phoenix banner. He already knew how to manipulate the banners, but he was worried; manipulating them was very difficult, and if he used too much true energy, King Nine Phoenix might notice.</p><p>He had been very low-key, even relying on his Demonic Transformation wings to travel, precisely to avoid being discovered.</p><p>Afterward, King Nine Phoenix took a moment to adjust her breathing, put away the glass bead, and took out a wooden box.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>The wooden box slowly opened, revealing a long feather inside!</p><p>This feather was over a foot long and broken, like a withered flower, completely devoid of color, its feathers withered and lifeless.</p><p>One could vaguely tell that the feather must have been extremely gorgeous, with beautiful patterns.</p><p>Seeing the feather, a look of intense shock appeared in the Rainbow-clad Fairy’s eyes.</p><p>However, King Nine Phoenix’s actions towards this withered feather were extremely cautious.</p><p>She opened the enchanted box, her true energy surging in her palm.  She carefully reached for the long feather, but a wave rippled from the feather, deflecting her finger.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang winced, her expression shifting slightly.  She increased her true energy, but still couldn't control the feather.</p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p>A flash of multicolored light erupted from Jiu Feng Wang, revealing her true form.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised by Jiu Feng Wang's true form.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang, boasting descent from the Heavenly Phoenix, looked nothing like the phoenixes depicted in ancient texts.  Her form was exquisitely beautiful, with multicolored feathers radiating a captivating aura. Her body was small, almost petite, but her long tail feathers resembled those of a phoenix.</p><p>However, Jiu Feng Wang more closely resembled a kind of phoenix-tailed cuckoo than a true phoenix.</p><p>The aura of a transformed great demon was undeniable, full of beauty.  But compared to the Azure-winged Bird carved by Jing Po Po, it was clearly inferior, like a candle flame next to the moon.</p><p>After all, Jing Po Po had seen the true aura of a celestial demon, and even a tenth of her skill in replicating it far surpassed Jiu Feng Wang's.</p><p>"So this is a supposed descendant of the phoenix?  Sounds like she's embellishing her lineage. If I visualized this 'phoenix,' I'd probably never succeed in cultivating the 'Celestial Demon Transformation'…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, inwardly criticizing.</p><p>"Yuan Zhu and those fellows probably have even uglier true forms."</p><p>It seemed that not only was human cultivation difficult, but the demons weren't faring much better.  With such diluted divine beast bloodline, whether they could even be called descendants of divine beasts was questionable. No wonder, despite the exceptionally advantageous bloodline inheritance of the demonic beasts, no Nascent Soul stage demons had appeared. Otherwise, the human and witch clans wouldn't dare to wreak havoc in the Demon Sea.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang was unaware of Qin Sang's inner disdain; otherwise, she would have swatted Qin Sang with a wing.</p><p>Having revealed her true form, Jiu Feng Wang flapped her wings, true energy surging, engulfing the feather.</p><p>The feather trembled a few times before being subdued by Jiu Feng Wang, slowly floating out of the box.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang, holding the feather, flew towards the celestial barrier, facing the clouds.</p><p>A clear cry rang out.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang held the feather in her beak and soared high into the air.</p><p>Just as she was about to leave the range of the phoenix banner, Jiu Feng Wang halted.</p><p>Her bright, spirited eyes fixed on a point within the celestial barrier, and a torrent of true energy poured from her body into the feather.</p><p>A strange wave emanated from the feather, unlike anything Qin Sang had ever seen. Although it wasn't strong, it strangely evoked a sense of terror and fear.</p>
