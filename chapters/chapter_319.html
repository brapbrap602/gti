Chapter 312: Foundation Establishment, Mid-Stage


Three days later.


Cultivation surged.


As expected, once the medicinal power was fully absorbed and his cultivation stabilized after some time, he could inscribe the Killing Talismans and break through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment. For a moment, Qin Sang felt a mixture of joy and worry.


This situation could only mean one thing: the Profound Harmony Pill's potency was sufficient, but it might not be the right medicine for him, or its effects weren't strong enough. The damage caused by the *Mystical Jade Cauldron Scripture* might be more severe than he imagined.


Qin Sang opened his eyes, his expression serious. Although he'd had a premonition, he realized he'd still underestimated the *Mystical Jade Cauldron Scripture*. This cultivation method couldn't be compared to ordinary dual cultivation techniques. After all, it could help Core Formation cultivators reach Nascent Soul!


The Harmony Pill, Five Mushroom Divine Paste, and Snow Ginseng Jade Life Pill had similar effects to the Profound Harmony Pill. If that were the case, even consuming more of these spirit pills might not fully heal him, only improving his recovery to a certain extent. He should look for stronger spirit pills, or divine medicines recorded in ancient texts like the Dao Sutra Grass and Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit.


The good news was that he was about to break through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment without any hindrance from his foundation.  On the surface, the only impact seemed to be on his Qi Sea.


Countless thoughts arose in Qin Sang's mind.


Finally, Qin Sang closed his eyes and entered meditative cultivation.


Time flowed in cultivation.


Days turned into years, and three years passed in a blink.


The cave entrance was completely covered by heavy snow, making it impossible to discern a cultivator's dwelling with the naked eye.


Three years undisturbed.


Qin Sang refined the medicinal power, stabilized his cultivation, and meticulously inscribed the Killing Talismans, never leaving his cave.


A year ago, two complete Killing Talismans were inscribed on the Ebony Sword, his *Spirit Nurturing Sword Chapter* broke through to the third level, and Qin Sang successfully entered the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.  He spent this year consolidating his new realm.


"Whoosh!"


A gust of wind blew out from within, scattering the accumulated snow.


Qin Sang opened the restrictions and walked out of the cave. Seeing the bright daylight, it was noon. He looked up at the blue sky and bright sun, which he hadn't seen in three years, and after a while, retracted his gaze with a touch of emotion.


Then, Qin Sang's figure flashed, transforming into a streak of light and flying towards Cloud Wanderer's cave.


A moment later.


The light landed in front of a snowy valley. Cloud Wanderer's cave was located within, containing a non-freezing spring. The environment was much better than Qin Sang's cave.


Qin Sang landed, about to activate his spiritual power to trigger the restrictions when a fluctuation suddenly appeared nearby. Several Qi Refining cultivators in armor emerged, guards of the Suspended Skull Guard.


"Gan Ying greets Senior."


The leader of the Suspended Skull Guard bowed to Qin Sang and said, "Uncle Cloud Wanderer is in seclusion. He has given orders not to be disturbed. If Senior has any urgent matters, you can leave a message talisman. We will deliver it to him after he emerges."


This area belonged to the Taiyi Pill House, so this person must be a guard stationed here.


Qin Sang frowned and withdrew his spiritual power. He had intended to inform Cloud Wanderer of his situation and seek advice, as Cloud Wanderer was proficient in alchemy and his knowledge far surpassed his own. Perhaps he would have a solution.


Since he was still in seclusion, it was inconvenient to disturb him.


"Forget it. I wanted to catch up with an old friend, but since Senior Cloud Wanderer is in seclusion, I won't disturb him. There's no need for a message talisman. Just inform him that Qin Sang came by after he emerges."


Qin Sang shook his head and asked, "Fellow Daoist, do you know when Senior began his seclusion? Did he leave any word about when he would emerge?"


The Suspended Skull Guard answered truthfully, "Senior began his seclusion three years ago and left no word."


Also three years ago, almost at the same time as him.


So, Cloud Wanderer had also refined the spirit pills he needed. It was just unknown if his divine soul had been healed.


Qin Sang nodded silently, pondered for a moment, and then flew north towards Suspended Skull Pass. His cultivation had progressed, and he needed to report to the sect.


Breaking through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment meant more dangerous missions, but the merit and rewards would be more substantial.  Qin Sang weighed the pros and cons.  He possessed valuable treasures and a powerful Corpse Refinement assistant, making him stronger than the average mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Plus, Senior Qi Yuanhu was in charge.


Overall, the benefits outweighed the risks.


Entering the city, Qin Sang went straight to the hall and encountered Yu Yangzi.


Yu Yangzi was at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.  After years of not seeing him, his aura was much stronger than before. Although he hadn't reached the late-stage, it was likely not far off.


Old friends reunited, and upon hearing Qin Sang's good news, Yu Yangzi was happy for him. They went to see Qi Yuanhu together, exchanging cultivation insights along the way.


Previously, although Yu Yangzi had been amiable, he hadn't taken the initiative to discuss cultivation matters with Qin Sang.


This was the change brought about by improved cultivation.


Qin Sang felt emotional but maintained a calm expression, earnestly seeking advice from Yu Yangzi and resolving many of his doubts.


As they talked, they walked into the passage and met several fellow disciples of Lesser Hua Mountain, one of whom was Yu Daiyue.


"Greetings, Senior Brother Yu."


Qin Sang cupped his hands and noticed that Yu Daiyue was still stuck at the early-stage of Foundation Establishment, unable to break through the bottleneck. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly.


He had first met Yu Daiyue in front of the Red Dust Gourd. At that time, Yu Daiyue was already a Foundation Establishment cultivator, also agreeing to be a cauldron for a breakthrough.


Later, they entered the Heavenly Corpse Sect's underground lair together and went to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to seek opportunities.  More than thirty years had passed in a flash.


Now, he had broken through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment, while Yu Daiyue lagged far behind, possibly never able to advance further in this life.


Life's encounters were truly unpredictable.


"Junior Brother Qin, are you also going to see Senior Brother Qi..."


Mid-sentence, Yu Daiyue suddenly sensed Qin Sang's aura. His eyes widened, his face filled with shock, and his voice full of disbelief.


"Youâ€¦ You've already broken through to the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment?"


"It was also this junior brother's luck, a fortunate opportunity for a breakthrough," Qin Sang replied calmly, not hiding his cultivation with the *Spirit Concealment Technique* since he was going to see Qi Yuanhu, and Yu Daiyue had already noticed.


Yu Yangzi laughed heartily, "Junior Brother Qin, there's no need for modesty.  Reaching the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment at your age isn't slow in the sect. Your chances of forming a Core are not small. Within a hundred years, perhaps Lesser Hua Mountain will have another Golden Core cultivator!"


Qin Sang knew Yu Yangzi was being polite and repeatedly said he didn't dare to presume.


The others offered their congratulations.


Yu Daiyue, however, seemed somewhat dejected and distracted, murmuring a few words before leaving with the others.


Looking at Yu Daiyue's somewhat desolate back, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.
