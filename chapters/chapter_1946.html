<h1>Chapter 1937: Setting the Trap</h1><p>Vermilion Bird, having spotted something intriguing, danced with excitement.</p><p>Little Five lowered her head, following Vermilion Bird's gaze.</p><p>Below the cliff was a lush, verdant jungle.</p><p>Ancient trees towered skyward, their crowns forming a dense, impenetrable canopy, occasionally broken by thick, python-like vines dangling down.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>“Tweet… tweet…”</p><p>‘Flutter!’</p><p>This was a paradise for birds. Nests were visible everywhere in the canopy, and rustling sounds from below indicated beasts running through the undergrowth.</p><p>However, the roars of ferocious beasts were almost absent.  Predators like jackals, wolves, tigers, and leopards were likely rare in this area.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, a narrow path was visible, winding through the thorns and vegetation, a clear sign of human activity.</p><p>This place wasn't truly the deep mountains.</p><p>The path, leading from the outside world, disappeared at the mountain's base.</p><p>Overgrown with weeds, it was not easily discernible, suggesting infrequent use, likely carved out by hunters venturing into the mountains.</p><p>Following the path outwards, the terrain gradually flattened. Qin Sang and his companions had seen a mortal village in that direction when they arrived.</p><p>Beyond this mountain lay the true primeval forest, rarely trod by humans, where ferocious beasts gradually became more common.</p><p>Vermilion Bird was focused on that very path.</p><p>The sun had risen high, casting its rays upon the forest. At the other end of the path, a figure appeared.</p><p>It was a young man, seemingly fourteen or fifteen years old, clad in coarse hemp clothing and straw sandals, clearly from a poor family. Yet his clothes were clean, and his brow held a resolute air, along with a scholarly aura not often seen in common folk.</p><p>He walked with a bundle of hemp rope in one hand and a sharpened steel spike in the other, his steps light despite the uneven path.</p><p>The knuckles on the hand gripping the rope and spike were thick, clearly indicating martial arts training.</p><p>Hunters invariably practiced some form of martial arts; otherwise, even entering the mountains would be difficult, let alone hunting beasts.</p><p>Whether the young man was gathering firewood or hunting, venturing into the mountains alone at such a young age was daring.</p><p>‘Rustle… rustle… rustle!’</p><p>He wasn't a cultivator, nor a martial arts expert capable of walking on walls or leaving no trace in the snow. As he walked, his body brushed against the weeds, inevitably producing sounds.</p><p>The young man’s brow remained furrowed in caution, constantly wary of dangers hidden in the undergrowth. He paused frequently to observe his surroundings.</p><p>Soon, a mountain rose to the east of the path, casting both the path and the young man into shadow.</p><p>Now it became apparent that he wasn't hunting. He slowed his pace, scrutinizing the mountainside to the right of the path.</p><p>This mountain lacked the imposing majesty of the one where Qin Sang and his companions were situated.</p><p>Its slopes were sometimes steep, sometimes gentle, covered in dense vegetation. Sheer cliffs rose hundreds of feet high in the steeper sections, while the gentler slopes could be easily climbed.</p><p>The young man seemed to be searching for something, meticulously examining the area, occasionally shaking his head or pausing in thought.</p><p>Finally, his eyes lit up as he found a terrain that matched his expectations, and he quickened his pace.</p><p>His target was a cliff face, rising about a hundred feet above the path, beyond a gentle slope.</p><p>As he was about to ascend, he paused, glancing at the sun's position. He marked a line on the ground with his steel spike, then surveyed the slope.  With a burst of strength, he leaped onto a rock, repeating the action several times until he reached the base of the cliff, looking up.</p><p>The cliff itself wasn't exceptionally tall, but its face was smooth and vertical, dotted with clumps of weeds.</p><p>A tree grew stubbornly outwards from a crevice, its trunk intertwined with vines, two of which dangled down, almost touching the ground.</p><p>The cliff wasn't wide, flanked by earthen slopes.  A large tree grew close to the right side, its trunk also covered in vines.</p><p>The young man recognized these vines as exceptionally strong, capable of replacing rope.</p><p>He quickly scanned the entire cliff face, his eyes gleaming in thought, finally settling on the top.</p><p>From below, a shadow was visible – a large, rounded boulder, jutting out precariously, seemingly on the verge of rolling down.</p><p>This boulder was the young man’s objective.  Repeating his earlier maneuver, he leaped from the earthen slope to the cliff top, pressed against the boulder, and gently pushed.  It didn't budge.</p><p>He increased his effort, feeling a slight shift, and a smile spread across his face.  Ignoring the danger, he leaned over the cliff edge to examine the contact point between the boulder and the cliff face, attempting to insert his steel spike.</p><p>He continued to move up and down, measuring and comparing the spike and rope.</p><p>Lost in his work, he suddenly remembered something, glanced back at the line he’d drawn, and noticed the mountain’s shadow was about to cross it.  His expression tightened. He quickly hid the spike and rope in the undergrowth and ran back down.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Vermilion Bird and Little Five, engrossed in the spectacle, were surprised to see the young man suddenly flee as if encountering a predator.</p><p>“He'll definitely be back tomorrow,” Vermilion Bird declared confidently.</p><p>The next day, at the same time, the young man returned as expected.</p><p>This time, he brought a shovel, retrieved the rope and spike from the undergrowth, and continued his work.</p><p>As before, once the designated time arrived, he departed without hesitation.</p><p>From then on, with Qin Sang busy repairing the Thunder Altar, the young man became a source of entertainment for Vermilion Bird and Little Five in their boredom.</p><p>Vermilion Bird even tried to wager with Little Five on the young man’s intentions, but Little Five wouldn’t take the bait.</p><p>This didn't diminish Vermilion Bird’s interest.  Every day, she eagerly awaited sunrise.</p><p>However, to preserve their curiosity, they refrained from using their divine abilities to investigate or pry into the young man's plans.</p><p>Over the following days, the young man brought new items each time he arrived.</p><p>A roll of wire mesh studded with iron nails, their unnatural color suggesting they were poisoned.</p><p>Sharpened spears with wooden shafts and iron-banded tips.</p><p>And various mechanical contraptions.</p><p>These contraptions, crafted with the ingenuity of a hunter, were designed for setting traps, their construction quite intricate.</p><p>The young man experimented for over ten days before selecting the most suitable mechanisms.</p><p>“See! I guessed it on the first day! He’s setting a trap!” Vermilion Bird gloated, triumphantly showing off to Little Five.</p><p>But it was puzzling. The young man was clearly preparing to hunt a ferocious beast, yet there were no such creatures in the vicinity.  The beasts of the deep mountains were blocked by the mountain beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>The young man possessed remarkable patience.  After more than a month of meticulous work, he finally completed the trap.</p><p>On the final day, he carefully inspected each mechanism, meticulously cleaned up any traces, and even brought moss from elsewhere to conceal the unavoidable scuff marks on the stones.</p><p>Then, without leaving any bait or luring any beast, he departed as usual when the time came.</p><p>“This kid's concealment isn’t perfect. I'll help him out.”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, never one to miss a good show, chuckled mischievously and flicked a wing.</p><p>For the next three days, the young man didn’t appear, leaving Vermilion Bird restless and itching to fly to the village and drag him out to ask what he was up to.</p><p>On the fourth day, the sun rose.</p><p>The young man finally reappeared.</p><p>His steps seemed heavier than before, but his pace was still brisk.</p><p>This time, he passed the trap without stopping, heading straight towards the mountain where they were.</p><p>For the first time in days, the young man ventured deeper into the mountains.</p><p>The dense foliage couldn't obstruct Vermilion Bird and Little Five's view as they watched him move through the forest with the agility of a monkey.</p><p>With a light crossbow strapped to his right arm, and aided by his trap and arrows, he had a successful hunt.</p><p>Descending the mountain, his bag held several birds, and he carried a small forest deer in his hand.</p><p>Back on the path, he glanced at the sun. It was almost time for his usual departure.</p><p>This time, however, he didn't return home. Instead, he carried his game to the trap, built a bonfire at a pre-selected spot on the earthen slope north of the cliff, gutted a bird, and began roasting it over the fire.</p><p>The plump bird soon sizzled, releasing a tempting aroma that drifted far and wide.</p><p>The young man’s next action was surprising.  Unfazed by the scent of roasting meat, he drew a short blade from his waist, positioned it against his left arm, and with a grimace of pain, plunged it into his skin, carving a deep wound, showing no mercy to himself.</p><p>Flesh parted, and bright red blood instantly stained his clothing.  The metallic scent of blood mingled with the aroma of roasting meat and drifted outwards.</p><p>‘Hiss!’</p><p>The young man gasped, tore a strip of cloth, bit on one end, and bandaged his wound.</p><p>The bleeding didn't stop easily, and the cloth quickly became soaked.</p><p>His face paled from blood loss.  He untied his waterskin, took a long gulp of wine, and then focused on roasting the meat over the fire.</p><p>A short while later.</p><p>A white flash appeared on the hilltop where the young man sat, then vanished instantly.</p><p>“Here we go!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird, her eyes shining with excitement, lowered her voice.</p><p>“No wonder! He's hunting a demon! This kid must have a death wish!”</p><p>Little Five’s eyes also flickered.</p><p>The white flash hadn't escaped their notice. It was a Foundation Establishment stage white ferret demon.</p><p>While human martial artists, upon reaching the Innate Realm, possessed considerable strength, capable of fighting low-level Qi Refining cultivators, this young man was clearly not such a master.  Daring to lure a ferret demon to kill it was incredibly audacious.</p><p>The ferret demon moved stealthily, traversing the undergrowth without a sound, arriving silently behind the young man before suddenly pouncing.</p><p>The young man, seemingly focused on roasting meat, was in reality tense and alert.  But the ferret demon was too fast.  By the time he sensed the rush of air, it was too late to dodge.</p><p>The ferret demon closed in instantly, its sharp claws aimed at the young man’s back.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The sound of metal striking metal rang out.</p><p>Beneath the torn fabric, a metal plate was revealed.</p><p>Based on the corpses of Master and the others, as well as accounts from survivors, the young man had deduced that this demon favored sneak attacks, targeting the heart from behind, and had prepared a metal plate for protection.</p><p>However, the ferret demon's claws were incredibly sharp, piercing the metal!</p><p>The young man felt a sharp pain in his back and a terrifying force impacting him through the metal. He instinctively lunged forward.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Facing the cliff, he tumbled headfirst, along with the roasting rack, into the sandy soil below.</p><p>Pain shot through his body, his internal organs jarring.</p><p>Yet, even as he fell, he managed to twist his body, aiming the light crossbow on his right arm behind him.</p><p>Failing to kill its prey with one strike, the ferret demon shrieked.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>The cry was ear-piercing.</p><p>Simultaneously, the ferret demon transformed into a white blur, leaping down after the young man, continuing its pursuit. It puffed out its cheek fur, releasing a cloud of white smoke that enveloped the young man.</p><p>Anticipating the demon's tactics, the young man had already closed his eyes and held his breath.</p><p>Despite his thorough preparations, the shriek made his head ring, leaving him slightly dazed, even with cotton stuffed in his ears.</p><p>The white smoke and screech were terrifying demonic arts. The most skilled hunter in the village had died helplessly against them, instilling fear in the villagers.</p><p>Fortunately, this ferret demon didn't appear in the mornings.  The villagers only dared to venture out during the morning hours, sealing their doors and windows after midday, and none dared to hunt the demon.</p><p>These precautions proved effective.  The young man didn't lose consciousness immediately.  With sheer willpower, he raised his left arm and fired the crossbow.</p><p>As the ferret demon pounced, about to tear apart his left arm, the metal plate strapped to his forearm offered some protection, though it was also ripped open, leaving a deep gash.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Three crossbow bolts shot out, their tips gleaming blue, coated in poison.</p><p>The ferret demon was forced to evade, twisting its body at improbable angles to avoid the bolts, emerging unscathed.</p><p>‘Thump!’</p><p>The young man crashed to the ground, coughing up blood.</p><p>The ferret demon greedily eyed his vibrant body and leaped down.</p><p>Just then, something triggered a mechanism, and the sandy ground erupted.</p><p>Two bent branches on nearby trees snapped straight simultaneously with a bang.</p><p>The vines hanging from the branches were yanked from the sand.</p><p>Several vines, tightly bound to the wire mesh, sprang up from the ground, along with a cloud of sand, instantly forming a net. The ferret demon was almost caught inside, about to be impaled by the poisoned nails.</p><p>Being a demon with some intelligence, it reacted swiftly, clinging to the edge of the net and leaping high.</p><p>However, the springing net had a secondary mechanism. A vine close to the cliff face was pulled, dislodging a stone wedged against the boulder. The boulder instantly rolled down from the cliff top.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The gust of wind ruffled the ferret demon's fur.</p><p>The boulder’s shadow enveloped the demon.  Even with its cultivation, being crushed by the boulder would shatter its bones.</p><p>‘Screech!’</p><p>The ferret demon, enraged, let out a furious roar.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>At the last moment, the ferret demon hastily expelled a cloud of white smoke, momentarily hindering the boulder.  Its front claws gripped the boulder’s edge, and with a powerful kick, it flipped over, narrowly escaping.</p><p>But the trap wasn't finished.  As the boulder fell, a third mechanism was activated. A click echoed from the ground, and cold, gleaming points emerged from the undergrowth.</p><p>Five poisoned spears from each side shot out, targeting the ferret demon as it hung in midair with nowhere to maneuver.</p><p>‘Swish! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The force of the poisoned spears rivaled that of a powerful crossbow, swift as lightning.</p><p>Ten spears crisscrossed, leaving the ferret demon with no escape.  Its roar turned into a shriek of terror.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A trail of demonic blood stained the ground.</p><p>A poisoned spear pierced the ferret demon, its tip embedding deeply into a tree trunk, the shaft still vibrating.</p><p>“Magnificent!”</p><p>Vermilion Bird clapped her wings.  “Pity, that little ferret has the aura of a cultivator.  It’s probably someone’s pet. This boy’s in trouble now.”</p>
