Chapter 1316: The Ethereal Spirit Sect

Qing Jun listened quietly to their conversation. Earlier, she had asked Qin Sang about Bai's origins. Qin Sang's response had been vague. Now, hearing that Bai was even familiar with the Dao Manifestation Tree—something they had never heard of—Qing Jun realized that this person's background might be even more mysterious than she had imagined. She glanced at Bai, deep in thought.

"So, no matter how extraordinary the Dao Manifestation Tree is, it will eventually be no different from any other puppet," Qin Sang said calmly, having settled his thoughts. "Brother Bai, earlier I saw you easily suppress the talisman puppet. Do you have a way to deal with the soul shadows within it?"

"Not entirely," Bai shook his head. "After all, it is a spiritual root of heaven and earth, and it must have unique properties that other spiritual objects lack. If you obtain the external incarnation technique, you can transform the puppet into an external incarnation. I assure you, it won't disappoint. I suggest you don't cleanse the soul shadows within it now. Otherwise, you'll only end up with an obedient puppet. This Dao Manifestation Tree can only seal soul shadows at the Nascent Soul level, which means even if you enhance the puppet to its maximum potential, it won't be much stronger than it is now. It would be a waste. Let me teach you a method to preserve them for when you cultivate your external incarnation. They will still be useful then."

Qin Sang nodded, knowing Bai's advice was sound. Unlike Qing Jun, he did not specialize in the art of puppetry. No matter how strong a puppet was, it remained an external tool, incomparable to an external incarnation.

He thought of the "Seed of Demonic Essence."

Bai scoffed, "That blood-path incarnation technique of yours is crude at best. At most, you could cultivate a Nascent Soul incarnation. When it self-destructed back then, I said there was nothing to regret. Using it on the Dao Manifestation Tree would be a waste, no better than the person who refined the tree into a puppet. Wait until you obtain a proper external incarnation technique from a Daoist sect before you act."

Qin Sang was left speechless, silently thinking that Bai must have been a member of a Daoist sect in the past. In Bai's eyes, anything outside the Daoist sects was mere heresy. But Qin Sang had no choice but to follow his advice.

From Bai's tone, it seemed that an external incarnation refined from the Dao Manifestation Tree had limitless potential, possibly even reaching realms beyond the Nascent Soul stage. Following his advice wouldn't be wrong.

However, where could one find such a grand Daoist technique? Whether such a top-tier secret art still existed in the world was unknown. At the very least, Qin Sang had never heard of it during the Three Domains War.

At this moment, Qing Jun, who had been listening nearby, smiled and said, "Thank you, Brother Bai, for sharing these secrets. I've learned a lot as well. Congratulations, Junior Brother, on obtaining another rare treasure. If the Dao Manifestation Tree is truly as miraculous as you say, cultivating a Divine Transformation-level external incarnation would be of great benefit to your main body. In the North Star Realm, this would be an unprecedented achievement!"

"Senior Sister, you jest. These are but fleeting illusions. It's better not to aim too high and to remain grounded," Qin Sang replied seriously.

Qing Jun nodded slightly, approvingly saying, "It's good that you recognize this, Junior Brother."

After a moment of thought, Qin Sang suddenly remembered something and asked Bai a question. Since it was now clear that the soul shadows were preserved due to the Dao Manifestation Tree, was there a way to refine a similar treasure that could separate and seal several soul shadows within it?

"Golden Core cultivators can increase their chances of breaking through by comprehending these soul shadows. When I travel in the future, I will definitely bring the Nascent Soul talisman puppet with me, but I can leave such a treasure at the Green Goat Temple, giving future disciples of our sect a path to follow."

Bai pondered for a while before nodding. "There should be a way, but I need to think it over carefully. Ah! Today has been a rollercoaster of emotions, nearly shaking my Dao heart."

Bai sighed deeply, stood up with a sense of weariness, and after asking Qin Sang for the location of the Earth Sink Cave, flew out of Peach Blossom Valley without looking back.

Watching Bai leave, Qing Jun also stood up and returned to her cave abode.

Qin Sang remained alone in the stone pavilion, holding the Nascent Soul talisman puppet and examining it repeatedly.

"I am not afraid of the soul shadows' backlash. Using the method Bai taught me, refining these soul shadows shouldn't be difficult. However, I already have the Demon Banner, and a mid-Nascent Soul puppet is sufficient for now. There's no need to obsess over greater strength. I shouldn't sacrifice the future for the present."

Qin Sang quickly made his decision and returned to his cave abode.

For the next several months, he remained in Peach Blossom Valley, focusing entirely on refining the Nascent Soul talisman puppet.

Several months later.

The mist in Peach Blossom Valley stirred, and a figure shot out, pausing briefly before speeding northward.

It was Qin Sang!

During this time, he had been transforming the talisman seals within the Nascent Soul puppet. Though the process was not yet complete, he had made significant progress and could now barely control the puppet in battle.

Fully subduing the puppet would take more time, but Qin Sang couldn't wait any longer. He decided to visit Bing Han now.

Bing Han had repeatedly invited him to visit the Ethereal Spirit Sect, and her words seemed to carry deeper meaning, as if she had something important in mind.

Considering Bing Han's friendship with Xiang Qing and her help in subduing the Ancestral Sacred Flame, Qin Sang guessed that Bing Han was likely planning something and needed assistance.

The Ethereal Spirit Sect's refining techniques were something Qin Sang was determined to obtain. No matter what conditions Bing Han proposed, he would agree.

Bai was currently in seclusion at the Earth Sink Cave, so it wasn't convenient to disturb him. Bringing the Nascent Soul puppet would be enough.

By now, the talisman seals within the Nascent Soul puppet had been transformed into puppet seals. When it moved, there were no longer flashes of talisman shadows, making it vastly different from before.

Even the ancestors of the Upper Clarity Palace might not recognize the Nascent Soul puppet in its current state.

Of course, even if word got out that the Nascent Soul puppet was in his possession, Qin Sang wasn't overly concerned. Still, it was better to avoid unnecessary trouble.

He had no time to spare for other matters.

Before the Purple Tenuity Palace emerged, refining a treasure capable of subduing the South Ming Li Fire was his top priority.

The fact that Elder Ye had infiltrated the Sin God Palace gave Qin Sang a bad premonition. He feared that further delays might lead to unforeseen events. No matter what, he couldn't miss the South Ming Li Fire.

The Ethereal Spirit Sect's mountain gate was located northeast of the Beast Taming Sect, forming a triangle with the Beast Taming Sect and the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect.

Qin Sang flew out of Peach Blossom Valley, heading north.

Mountains and rivers intertwined.

After flying over countless mountain ranges and plains, Qin Sang arrived at a hilly region.

Here, the scenery changed abruptly.

Unlike other places, there were no dense forests. Only scattered, stunted trees could be seen, mostly low shrubs and withered grass, all unusually sparse.

It was as desolate as a desert or wasteland.

Accompanying this was a constant stream of hot wind blowing from ahead, carrying the scent of sulfur.

Ahead lay the Ethereal Spirit Sect!

The sect's mountain gate was built atop a convergence of underground fire veins, the most concentrated and pure source of earth fire energy in the entire Little Cold Domain.

Qin Sang flew a bit further, and within his field of vision appeared a black river. Upon closer inspection, it was the trace of a lava flow.

Here, there was even less sign of life, with no human presence in sight.

He continued flying along the lava river.

Before long, Qin Sang halted his flight technique, revealing himself in mid-air. His gaze swept forward, landing on a large cluster of dormant volcanoes.

Almost immediately, several streaks of light shot out from the mountains.

The disciples of the Ethereal Spirit Sect had already detected Qin Sang.
