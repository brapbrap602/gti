<h1>Chapter 1998: The Corpse King's Ferocity</h1><p>Chapter 1998: The Corpse King's Ferocity</p><p>“I once encountered a rogue flying yaksha. Driven by obsession and instinct, it wouldn't attack a corpse animated with the same Heavenly Corpse Talisman energy. If this Corpse King is similar, it will be much easier to deal with…”  Qin Sang recalled the encounter with Wu Shang in the Wuyagou Valley.</p><p>Wu Shang was in the ice cave when he was backlashed by corpse energy, transforming into a flying yaksha.</p><p>Unless something unexpected happened, he should still be trapped in that freezing ice cave, unable to escape, day after day.</p><p>Wu Shang was different from Ya Gu. After Ya Gu absorbed the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, her physical body and soul were constantly nourished by various treasures. Wu Shang, however, had long since fallen into ruin, with no hope of being saved.</p><p>“I owe my ability to form a Golden Core to Wu Shang’s last words, which guided me.  When I get the chance, I’ll visit Wuyagou Valley to lay Wu Shang to rest,” Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Approaching the Corpse King’s lair, Qin Sang stopped.</p><p>Soon, Bai appeared beside Qin Sang and transmitted his voice, “There are no Ghost Kings nearby; the top-tier ghosts in this graveyard each seem to have their own territories. I’ve already cleaned up most of the weaker ghosts on the outskirts. When we attack, focus on eliminating the ghosts near the Corpse King's lair first.  We shouldn’t alert the other Ghost Kings for a while, giving us enough time to assess the Corpse King.”</p><p>“Let this guy guard the perimeter and intercept ghosts. You and I will take on the Corpse King together,”</p><p>Qin Sang released the white crane.</p><p>Sensing the graveyard’s gloomy aura, the white crane suddenly retracted its long neck, its feathers ruffled.</p><p>Bai glanced at the crane. He knew the creature was extremely cunning and quite powerful.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>After a brief discussion, Qin Sang ordered the white crane to provide cover, while he and Bai approached the Corpse King’s lair.</p><p>Bai used ghost mist to conceal their movements.</p><p>The graveyard was uneven terrain, scattered with broken tablets and bones.</p><p>After a short walk, the ground gradually sloped downwards, and they soon saw a deep pit.</p><p>The pit was filled with an especially dense concentration of ghostly energy, pitch black and impenetrable.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang saw the pit, his heart tightened involuntarily—this was a dangerous place!</p><p>At that moment, his Heavenly Eye Divine Ability suddenly detected a dark shadow flashing past in the pit with incredible speed.  In that fleeting glimpse, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable pressure.</p><p>To cause him that feeling, it had to be the Corpse King!</p><p>“It’s here!”</p><p>Qin Sang let out a low roar, instantly summoning his ebony sword, transforming it into a sword wheel, and slashing down towards the pit!</p><p>The brilliant sword light instantly illuminated the surrounding area.</p><p>The ghosts lurking nearby were startled by the commotion, becoming ferocious and scrambling to attack.</p><p>Simultaneously, Bai made his move.</p><p>The piercing cold of the ghostly energy became unusually docile before him, completely at his command.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Bai seemed to possess an endless suction force; ghostly energy surged towards him, forming a vortex around him.</p><p>This ghostly energy condensed into streaks, manipulated by Bai as if they were extensions of his own limbs.</p><p>‘Swish swish…’</p><p>The ghostly energy, like a spiderweb, enveloped the area ahead.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>Two loud sounds rang out.</p><p>The sword wheel suddenly dimmed, and the ebony sword flew back.</p><p>Then, a dark greenish-grey claw appeared in their sight, accompanied by the sound of ghostly energy streaks being torn apart layer by layer as the claw quickly approached them.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face paled slightly, his heart pounding in alarm.</p><p>Their earlier clash between the ebony sword and the Corpse King had sounded like metal striking metal; not only had it failed to force the Corpse King to reveal itself, but the sword wheel had nearly disintegrated.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this outcome to some extent.</p><p>His hand seals changed rapidly, and he launched another sword technique, but this time, it wasn't aimed at the Corpse King.</p><p>The sword wheel shot towards the sky, then countless sword energies suddenly dispersed, like a peacock spreading its tail feathers, raining down from the heavens.</p><p>The remaining ghosts were engulfed in the sword rain, screaming and scattering in all directions.</p><p>The white crane seized the opportunity to harvest them.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai also acted.</p><p>The continuously flowing ghostly energy, finally caused the Corpse King to reveal itself!</p><p>The Corpse King’s true form was truly horrifying. Its flesh was shriveled and withered; its face was green, its teeth were sharp, and its eyes were bloodshot—a terrifyingly brutal appearance.</p><p>Its figure was unusually large, its body surrounded by soaring corpse energy. Its skin was a dark greenish-grey, covered with several-inch-long black hairs, each standing upright and incredibly hard.</p><p>Its claws were jet-black, its fingernails as sharp as spiritual swords, and corpse poison emanated from them.</p><p>No trace of a human being remained on the Corpse King.</p><p>If it were a self-cultivated Corpse King at this level, it would have mastered transformation techniques. As long as it didn’t show its true form, apart from its corpse energy, it wouldn't be much different from an ordinary person.</p><p>If sufficiently intelligent to appear human and move among people, a common cultivator would find it very difficult to detect the true nature of this Corpse King, especially if it deliberately concealed itself.</p><p>This Corpse King was originally a corpse cultivated by a descendant of the Heavenly Corpse Sect.  For some reason, it was left here and has yet to break free from the constraints of the necromantic arts and the Heavenly Corpse talismans. It lacks the intelligence commensurate with its cultivation level and doesn't know how to change its form.</p><p>This is good news for Qin Sang and Bai; dealing with the Corpse King will be easier.</p><p>However, after seeing the Corpse King's physical body, both of them had doubts.</p><p>The Corpse King's body is incredibly tough. It easily repelled the powerful blow from the ghost claw, tearing through the spectral energy, seemingly unscathed.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The Corpse King's fangs bared, unleashing a thunderous roar.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang and Bai, the bloodthirsty and avaricious intent in the Corpse King's bloodshot eyes intensified. It violently crossed its arms, and with a ripping sound, it forcibly tore through the spectral energy.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, and he immediately used his escape technique to retreat.</p><p>At this time, some of the other ghosts had been killed by Qin Sang's sword, and the rest, sensing the Corpse King's aura, scattered in terror, only to be hunted down and killed by Bai.</p><p>The area around the deep pit was empty.</p><p>Bai remained motionless, his eyes fixed on the deadly bloodshot eyes. His lips moved, seemingly chanting some kind of secret technique; his expression was extremely tense.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of foul wind swept by, carrying a nauseating stench.</p><p>The Corpse King suddenly unleashed a massive burst of corpse energy, vanishing from its spot and reappearing before Bai in an instant.</p><p>Bai, engrossed in his secret technique, was startled. He hastily dodged, moving several meters sideways, narrowly avoiding the attack.</p><p>Even so, three claw marks appeared on Bai's arm, deep enough to expose the bone.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the wounds turned pitch-black as the corpse poison invaded his body and spread rapidly.</p><p>Bai possessed the Nine-Lives Xuanwu Shell given to him by Qin Sang.  After years of refinement by the Nine-Lives Xuanwu turtle, its hardness was comparable to a defensive treasure; it could be used as a shield.</p><p>However, against the Corpse King, Bai failed to raise the shell to defend himself in time.</p><p>An ordinary cultivator would have succumbed to the corpse poison and died on the spot.</p><p>Fortunately, Bai himself was a cultivated corpse, less vulnerable to the Corpse King's poison.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and retreated to the outer edge of the deep pit, avoiding attracting the Corpse King's attention.  He was not a cultivated corpse, and even the physical body cultivated to the third level of the Heavenly Demon Transformation couldn’t withstand a blow from the Corpse King. If targeted, the consequences would be disastrous.</p><p>Bai continued to retreat, desperately maneuvering against the Corpse King, facing imminent danger.</p><p>At this moment, an unexpected event occurred.  Despite the Corpse King's ferocious aura, its figure inexplicably swayed, and its corpse energy fluctuated wildly.</p>
