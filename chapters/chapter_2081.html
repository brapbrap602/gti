<h1>Chapter 2072: A Solemn Offering</h1><p>Qin Sang and Li Yufu returned to the main hall. Si Lu and Ji Hong both looked up, and Shen Chen rose to offer a respectful bow.  Shen Chen had, as instructed by Qin Sang, revealed some information to the two, though certain matters were difficult to conceal entirely, and they would eventually discern the truth.</p><p>“With our arrival here, our previous agreement is fulfilled.  What are Daoist Si Lu’s plans going forward?” Qin Sang sat opposite them.</p><p>Qin Sang could surmise Si Lu’s intentions, but he wouldn’t reject him for it. This was the Zhuyan Tribe’s territory; even if Si Lu's identity were exposed, Si You couldn't launch a full-scale attack. The various tribes of the Otherfolk coexisted in the Sea of Mists, and competition was inevitable. The upper echelon tribes were also wary of each other.</p><p>He hadn't yet fathomed the Zhuyan Tribe's intentions, and keeping Si Lu around might prove useful.</p><p>“If we were to simply depart, I doubt Daoist Qin would be at ease, would you?”</p><p>Si Lu gave a cunning smile, gazing beyond the hall with a faraway look.</p><p>Legend had it that within the Great Thousand World existed countless Small Thousand Worlds, constantly being created and destroyed. The gateway to one might be right before your eyes, on a bedside table, amidst the branches of a tree, coexisting day and night yet remaining unnoticed. Even until the Small Thousand World perished, its inhabitants annihilated, not a ripple would disturb the surface.</p><p>They had yet to grasp the full truth, unable to imagine the Storm Realm merging entirely into the Great Thousand World. They assumed a cultivator from the Storm Realm had achieved Realm Ascension, benefiting their home realm and guiding others into the Great Thousand World to cultivate in a broader, more profound world.  Such occurrences were not uncommon in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Alternatively, these individuals might have come from a shattered Small Thousand World, fortunate enough to find a guiding gateway before its demise, escaping just in time.</p><p>Regardless, humans couldn't have appeared in the Sea of Mists out of thin air, and these individuals were certainly unrelated to the Si You Tribe.</p><p>‘Rustle… rustle…’</p><p>The disciples of the Green Ram Temple remained quietly in their meditation chambers. The wind blew through a cluster of purple bamboo before the hall, occasionally punctuated by birdsong. The absence of other sounds emphasized the temple's profound serenity.</p><p>“Having found such a tranquil place, I wish to impose upon your hospitality for a while longer. Would that be permissible?”</p><p>“I would be delighted,” Qin Sang glanced at Li Yufu.</p><p>Understanding his meaning, Li Yufu bowed and said, “Not far from here, our Temple maintains a secluded branch temple, nestled deep within the mountains, abundant in spiritual energy, perfect for hosting esteemed guests.  Only a few disciples reside there, keeping watch. It is exceptionally peaceful.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “After some time, when an opportune moment presents itself, I will trouble you to retrieve Su Nü and the others.”</p><p>Frequent comings and goings within a short period might arouse suspicion.</p><p>Si Lu readily agreed.</p><p>“And what of Daoist Ji Hong?” Qin Sang turned to Ji Hong.</p><p>“I still need to help Daoist Si Lu avenge his grievance!”</p><p>Ji Hong raised her small face, then eagerly inquired, “You must have novel and exotic species here, perhaps some with the potential to be cultivated into superior spiritual varieties. May I wander about?”</p><p>Qin Sang agreed without hesitation. “As long as Daoist Ji Hong adheres to the agreement between the Jiaojiao Tribe and the other tribes, sharing the cultivated spiritual varieties with us, you are free to come and go. However, I will not announce these matters publicly for now.  Others have never seen your kinsfolk, so it would be best to disguise yourself as a human cultivator.”</p><p>It wasn’t Ji Hong's safety that concerned him; few in the Storm Realm were her match now.  Qin Sang worried about Ji Hong causing unrest, disrupting his plans.</p><p>Ji Hong's small face lit up with joy as she nodded repeatedly. “Rest assured, Daoist Qin, I will be very careful!”</p><p>As they spoke, Li Yufu activated the Deer Wilderness Grand Formation, quickly arriving above the branch temple.</p><p>Having settled Si Lu and Ji Hong, Li Yufu left the Deer Wilderness there and accompanied Qin Sang outside.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to visit the Small Cold Region first. It was the ancestral home of the Green Ram Temple and where he began his journey. Shifting to the Crescent Moon Realm, Qin Sang conjured a spiritual wind, carrying them north.</p><p>Now, the storms between the Small Cold Region and the three Northern Sea Realms had dissipated, no longer isolated overseas. In truth, the two regions could always be loosely considered one. Before Ascendant Tian Yue planted his sword in the Northern Sea, there had been exchanges between the top cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang flew at a moderate pace, deliberately choosing a route closer to the outer sea.  He could see that the defensive line constructed by the Storm Realm cultivators extended to the Small Cold Region. The entire Northern Sea and its four realms faced the threat of the Changyou Tribe.</p><p>“The Storm Realm resembles a wedge embedded within the Changyou Tribe’s territory.  Except for the Tainted Lands to the east, it is entirely surrounded by their territory. Fortunately, the Changyou Tribe's forces are concentrated in the more fertile south, leaving the north relatively weaker. Thus, the initial fierce assaults targeted the Central Continent, the Roiling Sea, and the Demon Sea. Otherwise, the Northern Sea and its four realms might have been the ones occupied.”</p><p>Li Yufu spoke with a hint of emotion, gesturing towards the outer sea.  “The Changyou Tribe continues to reinforce the Northern Sea, attempting to replicate their past victories. However, with the Teleportation Formations, the Central Continent can readily reinforce the Northern Sea, and they have yet to succeed!”</p><p>Currently, the Storm Realm only held the Northern Sea and the Central Continent.</p><p>After the storms receded, Storm Realm cultivators discovered several locations resembling the refuge Qin Sang passed during his departure from the Northern Sea. These areas were small, incomparable to the major regions. Some had become dead zones, others inhabited by mortals and low-level cultivators, like scattered fragments.</p><p>These places were now abandoned, with the focus solely on defending the Central Continent and the Northern Sea. Cultivators traveled between the two regions through Teleportation Formations. With Changyou Tribe experts roaming between the two, even Nascent Soul cultivators risked attack while traversing the skies.</p><p>The defensive lines were well-organized. Unless the Changyou Tribe’s Patriarch broke through to the second level of the Emptiness Realm, they wouldn’t be able to overwhelm the Storm Realm cultivators in a short time. Qin Sang didn't need to rush his appearance, having ample time to make his arrangements.</p><p>As they spoke, they reached the edge of the North Star Realm.</p><p>The former North Star Great Desert had vanished, replaced by lush forests and grasslands. The air carried a moist, fresh scent, teeming with life enjoying the bounty of this fertile land.</p><p>With the revival of Heavenly and Earthly Qi, the weather and terrain in many places had undergone dramatic transformations.</p><p>Li Yufu continued to recount stories of old acquaintances.</p><p>“Senior Lu unfortunately perished, bequeathing all his possessions to Daoist Han Xi. After Daoist Han Xi stepped into the Nascent Soul realm, he relocated his cultivation grounds to the Demon Realm.</p><p>“However, the current ruler of the Demon Realm is King Yu. The former ruler perished during Heavenly Tribulation. It’s said King Yu unearthed a divine herb while ascending at the Purple Star Palace, aiding him in overcoming the tribulation. After achieving Nascent Soul, King Yu claimed the Demon Realm, unifying the Northern Sea's demon tribes.</p><p>“Many demon tribes from the Small Cold Region followed King Yu, migrating en masse to the Demon Realm. Those lands became unclaimed, and Senior Yu Nu connected the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea with the Green Ram Temple.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected Lu Boyuan's demise, while his spirit beast, the Cold Lizard, had achieved Nascent Soul.</p><p>He pondered. He hadn't interacted much with King Yu and was unsure if the demon's temperament had changed. If he proved unruly, the matter would be easy to resolve, handing the Northern Sea demon tribes to Yu Nu or Han Xi. Besides, he still had two Demon Marquises within his altar.</p><p>As for the human cultivators of the Northern Sea, the Profound Heaven Palace held supreme authority and had deep ties with him.  As long as the Profound Heaven Palace cooperated, the rest was of little concern.</p><p>The Central Continent demanded his primary attention, with its intricate web of tribes and sects requiring careful consideration.</p><p>Li Yufu pointed towards the Abyss of Sin to the east.  “Fairy Qiu Zhi possesses exceptional talent. In truth, even without the Azure Spirit Qi, she would have been among those most likely to achieve Nascent Soul.”</p><p>As they spoke, they approached the Skybound Plateau.</p><p>“It’s a pity that the two disciples of Daoist Zhen Yi, both possessing outstanding talent and character, were hindered by the flaws in their dual cultivation technique. They reached the late Nascent Soul stage but could progress no further, ultimately perishing with their aspirations unfulfilled.  The Skybound Alliance, rife with internal dissent, quickly fragmented…”</p><p>Li Yufu continued his narrative, and before they knew it, they arrived at the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea. He retrieved the Temple Master's command token, flashing it before him, allowing him and Qin Sang to pass through the grand formation undetected by the guarding demon soldiers.</p><p>As they stepped into the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, they heard a languid voice. “What brings the Temple Master back? Are the Changyou Tribe planning another major offensive?  Eh…”</p><p>The voice abruptly stopped.</p><p>The next moment, a lively figure materialized before Qin Sang and Li Yufu. She wore an elegant white dress, her face unadorned with makeup. Her face was round, her eyes round, her mouth agape as she stared at Qin Sang, even her small mouth appearing round, only her ears pointed.</p><p>"Daoist Yu Nu, it's been a while," Qin Sang greeted with a smile and a bow.</p><p>"Qin…"</p><p>Yu Nu was both surprised and delighted, stammering, then letting out a small cry before hurriedly curtseying. "Yu Nu greets Young Master Qin."</p><p>…</p><p>The three strolled among the clouds, slowly flying eastward.</p><p>Separated for a millennium, reminiscing about the past and those missing Daoist companions filled Qin Sang and Yu Nu with a mixture of emotions, the atmosphere turning somber.</p><p>The Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, the Green Ram Temple, and the surrounding areas were now considered Yu Nu's domain. The disciples of the Green Ram Temple and the demon cultivators of the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, upon achieving sufficient cultivation, could choose a scenic location to establish their cave dwellings, undisturbed by others.</p><p>The Green Ram Temple's ancestral home, Emerald Screen Mountain, also known as the former Great Sui Kingdom, was located here.</p><p>They headed straight for Emerald Screen Mountain. Temple members and disciples who had made significant contributions to the Green Ram Temple were buried in the back mountains, receiving offerings from later generations, including Tan Hao and the others.</p><p>The Ancestral Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang offered three sticks of incense, gazing at the memorial tablets.  Not only were Daoist Ji Xin and Ming Yue present, but so were Cloud Wanderer and his own.</p><p>The Green Ram Temple believed he had perished, and Cloud Wanderer surely had no hope of revival. More than a thousand years had passed, yet Qin Sang could still recall his time at the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>After he finished paying his respects, Yu Nu couldn't help but ask, "Will Senior Bamboo Demon return?"</p><p>Li Yufu looked on nervously; he had longed to ask but dared not.</p><p>"He will!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded firmly.</p><p>Both Yu Nu and Li Yufu placed unconditional trust in Qin Sang, their faces breaking into joyful smiles.</p><p>Then, Li Yufu remembered something else. "There’s another matter to report to Martial Uncle.  Over the years, strange occurrences have been reported in various locations.  Within temples and shrines, the clay and wooden statues receiving worship have suddenly come to life, birthing deities. Upon inquiry, we learned that these are the souls of the deceased returning to their rightful places, becoming deities in their bewildered state. Because of the Changyou Tribe, there hasn’t been a consensus on how to handle them.  Seeing these deities deeply connected to the mortal world, posing no immediate threat to the cultivation world, and even aiding the sects in stabilizing the mortal realm, we’ve temporarily allowed it."</p><p>He left one sentence unspoken. Ever since deities began appearing frequently, there were concerns that if the sacred statues, recipients of a realm's worship, were possessed by something, it might give rise to something extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang had sensed the auras of several deities on his journey here.  The Storm Realm previously had no deities, yet upon returning to the Great Thousand World, deities sprang up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Something was clearly amiss.</p><p>Unable to determine the cause, Qin Sang could only attribute it to the Storm Realm’s unique nature.</p><p>He had a theory: could it be that the Heavenly Dao of the lower realm was incomplete, and the missing aspect in the Storm Realm was precisely the Divine Dao?</p><p>Li Yufu paused, and seeing Qin Sang silent, continued, “Back then, the people, grateful for Master and Grandmaster’s benevolence, established the Ten Thousand Families Shrine, where incense has burned continuously.  Is it possible that Grandmaster and Master…”</p><p>His voice carried a hint of excitement.</p><p>Qin Sang understood his thoughts but believed the chances of Daoist Ji Xin and Ming Yue returning were slim. If the Divine Dao had always existed, given their merits, they would surely have been incorporated into it. However, they had been deceased for over a thousand years, their souls long dissipated.</p><p>Their return would prove that everyone possessed a unique mark in this world, un-erased by death. Reincarnation might not be just a legend!</p><p>Qin Sang had heard that among the Eight Heavenly Continents, the Divine Dao was most prosperous in the southeastern Zhen Continent, while in other places, it was largely suppressed. He had traveled through three continents and hadn't encountered any established Divine Dao cultivators.  Had he not received news from the Storm Realm, he might have gone there himself.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang visited the graves of Tan Hao and the others, paying his respects before leaving Emerald Screen Mountain alone.</p><p>Looking down from the sky, the once-thriving Three Witches City had gone through cycles of prosperity and decline, no longer its former self. The river had swelled, and the new city was situated far from the old site. The bun shop was long gone, and he wondered if their descendants remained.</p><p>He continued north, finally arriving above a mountain peak.</p><p>Pilgrimage Mountain!</p><p>Under the Green Ram Temple's meticulous care, Pilgrimage Mountain remained unchanged.</p><p>Qin Sang descended, a wine gourd in hand. He walked along a path until a nameless stele appeared before him.</p><p>Despite the careful preservation, the stele, weathered by a thousand years, bore the marks of time.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, gazing at it for a moment before approaching the grave.  He placed the wine gourd down, murmuring, "I've come rather late this time…"</p><p>He carefully brushed away the dust, sat before the grave, and looked up at the sky.</p><p>Unknowingly, over a thousand years had passed. Back then, he could never have imagined the trials and wonders he would experience after making that choice.</p><p>He had shattered the heavens, arriving 'in the heavens,' yet he hadn't seen any immortals. The path ahead remained long and arduous.</p><p>Fortunately, Consort Dongyang was under the same sky, able to witness him fulfilling his oath.</p><p>After sitting in silence for a long time, Qin Sang stood up, offered a toast to Consort Dongyang, and poured the fine spirit wine onto the grave.</p><p>He offered no words of remembrance nor grand pronouncements, simply saying, "I'm leaving now!"</p><p>Then, he waved casually, as if bidding farewell to an old friend.</p><p>His figure gradually disappeared into the night.</p><p>The moonlight was hazy, the tree shadows dancing and swaying on the stele.
