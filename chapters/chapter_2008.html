<h1>Chapter 1999: Visitors</h1><p>Cultivating the sixth level of the *Celestial Demon Transformation* technique.</p><p>In a trance, Qin Sang felt himself transform into a star-luan, soaring through the night sky, his body becoming stars.</p><p>Merging with the cosmos, drawing upon the power of the stars felt incredibly effortless, like a fish in water, swimming freely in the star sea.  Furthermore, Qin Sang sensed the presence of incredibly pure and substantial star energy deep within the night sky.</p><p>Cultivators of the stellar path typically only absorb star energy from the scattered starlight falling from the heavens; before reaching a certain level, they cannot access the deep cosmos.</p><p>One reason for the *Celestial Demon Transformation*'s power is its ability to help cultivators reach deeper into the cosmos, allowing them to absorb and refine star energy much faster.</p><p>However, before his breakthrough, Qin Sang could only vaguely sense this pure star energy; now, he could draw upon it.</p><p>Using this richer, purer star energy for body refinement could yield several times, even ten times, the effect, but it naturally demands more of the cultivator.</p><p>Having entered the sixth level of *Celestial Demon Transformation*, Qin Sang could meet these demands, immediately drawing upon the star energy to experience its effects in cultivation.</p><p>Various signs indicate that the higher the realm of this technique, the more it emphasizes the Dharma aspect. This is no exception.</p><p>The Azure-luan Dharma form descended behind Qin Sang, merging with his back as they both underwent star energy refinement. Most of the star energy was absorbed by the Azure-luan Dharma form.</p><p>The benefits to Qin Sang's physical body were limited, unless he infused his own qi and blood into the Dharma form for simultaneous refinement.</p><p>After cultivating for some time, Qin Sang sensed changes in the Azure-luan Dharma form, discovering that it had grown slightly stronger.</p><p>In other words, this method of cultivation was viable; he could continue to strengthen the Azure-luan Dharma form, enhancing his own strength without stagnation.</p><p>Discovering this, Qin Sang felt slightly relieved.  If so, he would maintain the status quo and not rush into a decision.</p><p>After the divergence between his own path and the Great Completion Killing Dao of the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture*, Qin Sang considered switching to other techniques.</p><p>Even in the Great Thousand World, techniques comparable to the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture* were likely few.  *Celestial Demon Transformation* was one option, but based on his own cultivation discoveries and the First Sword Attendantâ€™s warning, Qin Sang had a premonition that he would also diverge from this demon cultivation technique.</p><p>The facts proved him right.</p><p>His progress to this point was greatly due to these two top-tier techniques. He had thought they would help him further, but unexpectedly, he faced a choice in the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Besides this, Qin Sang reviewed his inherited legacies.  Of human origin was the Nine Great Luminous Seals of Buddhism, certainly a major legacy from Buddhist body refinement techniques. Unfortunately, he had the seals but lacked the Buddhist methods.</p><p>For poison techniques, he had the *Poison God Canon*, but it was incomplete, and the poison pearl was shattered.</p><p>He summoned the black and white pieces. The two pieces rotated slowly, forming the Taiji double fish in his palm. This treasure was an artifact of Yin-Yang Dao, but he had little understanding of it, not even knowing its origin.</p><p>As for thunder techniques, the Five Thunder Envoy seal was incomplete, and he did not know where to receive the high-level fourth-order God-Soaring Thunder Technique in the future.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang realized that if he were to change his path, the greatest legacy he could easily obtain might be the Dao Court thunder techniques.</p><p>The problem returned to the same point: he couldn't remain isolated; he had to go out into the world!</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently, deciding to maintain the status quo, primarily cultivating the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture*. At least the Great Completion Killing Dao was clear, its path ahead was evident.</p><p>Moreover, the sword Dao was bright and open. He had comprehended the Four Symbols Sword Array and the Sword Domain; he could dominate the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>In the future, the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture* would be his main practice, thunder techniques secondary, and *Celestial Demon Transformation* third. After breaking through, he could use the Sun Wheel Seal and the Azure-luan True Thunder; his goals had been achieved.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang sent a strand of consciousness down the mountain to a stone mansion and transmitted a message.</p><p>"Gui Hou, Luo Hou, come up."</p><p>After stopping the Celestial River Reverse-Killing Array, the two demon marquises hadn't left. They had remained at Bie Guan, guiding the Hongmei two demons.</p><p>The Hongmei two demons were plant spirits, while the two demon marquises were beast spirits; their cultivation was different. For example, the *Celestial Demon Transformation* technique could not be practiced by plant spirits.</p><p>However, Gui Fang also had plant spirits, and the two demon marquises were experienced; they were still capable of guiding the Hongmei two demons.</p><p>The Hongmei two demons had a close relationship and cultivated in the same cave.  The two demon marquises were seated, while the Hongmei two demons stood and listened.</p><p>Upon hearing the transmission, the two demon marquises quickly rose, bowed, and rushed to the mountaintop.</p><p>"Greetings, Great Master," the two demon marquises bowed together.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the two demons, his gaze assessing, making them uneasy.  It reminded them of hundreds of years ago, when they first entered the Great Thousand World, and Qin Sang had looked at them the same way.</p><p>"You have followed me, managing Qingyang Temple, and have been diligent. As I promised, rewards are given for merit."</p><p>Qin Sang tossed a bone flute to Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou was initially puzzled.  He placed the flute against his forehead. After a moment, his eyes widened, and forgetting his manners, he urgently asked, "This cultivation technique only has four levels?"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, *As expected. After the fifth level, each cultivator receives a different technique from the flute.*</p><p>Gui Hou could only see the first four levels, likely because he hadn't started cultivating yet. Once he switched to the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, the most compatible technique would manifest with his bloodline.</p><p>*One bone flute, a treasure trove!*</p><p>If the demons of the Great Thousand World knew, it would surely create karmic entanglement. Did the First Sword Servant see this possibility?</p><p>*I need to be more cautious when transmitting techniques in the future.*</p><p>"There are more levels, of course, but you will only see them after you start cultivating this technique. Whether you switch or not is your decision. I won't force you," Qin Sang said calmly after the two demons had examined the flute.</p><p>He hoped the two demons would switch to the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, ideally breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, to observe the effects of true demons cultivating this technique, for reference and self-verification. However, it wasn't so easy.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang would collect other demon cultivation techniques to compare with the *Celestial Demon Transformation*, if he had the chance.</p><p>The two demons had previously submitted their cultivation techniques. They weren't from prominent clans; their techniques were granted by the Gui Fang Kingdom, only reaching the Transformation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang also possessed a Nascent Soul stage demon cultivation technique, that of the black demonic roc.</p><p>However, it was a true inheritance of the roc clan, only cultivable by those with roc bloodline. Qin Sang couldn't practice it; comprehending it was exceedingly difficult. He only knew that the roc clan, at the Nascent Soul stage, also focused on refining their Dharma forms, but not using stellar energy.</p><p>According to the two demons, Gui Fang Kingdom also had demons who cultivated using stellar energy, but they hadn't obtained their inheritance.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, dismissing them to consider the matter.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>The two demons looked at each other.</p><p>Despite only seeing the first four levels, they were deeply captivated by the profound nature of the *Celestial Demon Transformation*; their original techniques couldn't compare.</p><p>To think Qin Sang, a human, possessed such a major demon lineage!</p><p>They were delighted by this discovery, but their excitement was tempered by the understanding that such power shouldn't be easily shared. Once they accepted it, they would surely be restricted, forever bound to Qin Sang.</p><p>But even without this technique, did they have a chance to escape?</p><p>They reflected on their years of following Qin Sang.  Besides the lack of freedom and the handling of various tasks, Qin Sang hadn't mistreated them in cultivation.  He treated them kindly, not as servants, and even brought them treasures as rewards after the Jitian Dharma Assembly.</p><p>If Qin Sang wasn't deceiving them, cultivating this technique might offer a chance to break through to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Silence filled the cave. The two demons saw the wavering in each other's eyes.</p><p>If before they were intimidated by Qin Sang's strength, now they seriously considered pledging their allegiance to him!</p><p>...</p><p>Two years later.</p><p>Outside the Azure Sky Grotto.</p><p>Qin Sang, Gu Yun Sou, and two others surrounded the mountain in the sea, standing at the four cardinal directions.  Countless points of light and numerous Seven Star Swords floated between them.</p><p>Four Nascent Soul cultivators jointly deployed the array.</p><p>The sea surface was calm, but the seabed churned violently as the local spirit veins were being transformed.</p><p>The four worked with clear divisions of labor, progressing swiftly.</p><p>The light points rose, forming a silver river. The Seven Star Swords plunged into the mountain, and the Celestial River Killing Array was finally completed!</p><p>If Zhen Laomo came now, he would find this formation unfamiliar.</p><p>Qin Sang, with a deeper understanding of the Stellar Dao, had made sweeping improvements to the array.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou clearly felt the significant differences from the array at the Qingyang Temple's branch, and secretly marveled at the hidden strength of this Qingfeng Daoist.  His understanding of the Stellar Dao was so profound, further solidifying his previous judgment.</p><p>After setting up the array, the four continually cast spells to transform the mountain, instantly adding pavilions and towers.</p><p>"From now on, this place will be called the Azure Sky Water Palace!"</p><p>Ying Zongzhu stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p>The other three nodded.</p><p>Yu Zongzhu looked towards the Water Palace's restricted area, where the marker of the Azure Sky Grotto was located, "Each of the four sects will send a Transformation stage disciple to garrison this place and maintain the array.  If external enemies attack, they can hold out until we arrive."</p><p>Taiyi, Yulang, and other disciples from the three sects, were waiting outside.  Everyone was curious about the Lesser Thousand World.</p><p>Orders were given, and the disciples entered the Azure Sky Cave, beginning their tasks.  Even with the combined efforts of the four sects, it would take time to get everything running smoothly.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Six years later.</p><p>Qingyang Temple, a branch temple.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed someone approaching his cave and awoke.  He heard Gui Hou outside say, "Master, Elder Yue is here to visit."</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang had mentioned her, Gui Hou didn't dare delay and immediately reported it.</p><p>"Finallyâ€¦"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed.  After the Jitian Dharma Assembly, he and Elder Yue had parted ways.  He hadn't heard from her for so long, he'd thought something had happened.</p><p>Looking at the Sky-Eyed Butterfly on his shoulder, Qin Sang smiled slightly, "Your delicious treat has arrived."</p><p>After his own breakthrough, Qin Sang had focused on the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, studying the *Panhu True Scripture* together to refine their cultivation, waiting only for the Azure Frost Dew.</p><p>Qin Sang rose, adjusted his robes, and went to the guest hall.</p><p>Inside, Elder Yue stood with her back to the entrance, hands clasped behind her back, seemingly admiring the hall's decor.</p><p>Elder Yue turned, bowed slightly, and a smile touched her lips. "Daoist Qin, greetings."</p><p>"Please, have a seat, Daoist Yue."</p><p>Seeing her smile, Qin Sang felt reassured. He calmly entered the hall.</p><p>Elder Yue wasted no time, producing a jade bottle and placing it on the table. "Daoist Qin, please have a look!"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. The jade bottle was completely translucent, yet contained shimmering lights, like snowflakes swirling within, creating a miniature world of frost and snow.  It captivated the eye.</p><p>Within his dantian, the Sky-Eyed Butterfly stirred, impatient.</p><p>It was the Azure Frost Dew!</p><p>Judging by its color, it was top quality.</p><p>Elder Yue stated proudly, "Refining this elixir was the most meticulous and careful work of my life. I am relieved to have succeeded."</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. "Daoist Yue, you've gone to so much trouble. I am deeply grateful."</p><p>He didn't rush to take the Azure Frost Dew. He continued to watch Elder Yue, knowing she hadn't come merely to deliver the medicine.</p><p>As expected, Elder Yue produced another item: a dry, yellow leaf with unusually intricate veins, unfamiliar to Qin Sang.</p><p>"If you wish to go to the Great Zhou, take this token to Jitian Peak and find a Mr. Hong. Once you meet him, wait patiently for the arrival of the Canjin City attendant. Mr. Hong will make the arrangements; don't ask any further questions."</p><p>"Mr. Hong?"</p><p>The man sounded mysterious. Seeing that Elder Yue didn't offer further explanation, Qin Sang nodded, remembering the instructions.</p><p>Elder Yue continued, "Travel to and from Canjin City isn't regular, usually spaced decades apart. If you decide to go, it's best to leave early."</p><p>Since Elder Yue had made all the arrangements, Qin Sang reciprocated by producing a jade slip.  He had already inscribed some alchemic formulas from the *Panhu True Scripture* onto it.</p><p>Elder Yue's eyes lit up.  She put down the leaf, picked up the jade slip, and eagerly examined it.  She looked entranced. After a long moment, she sighed softly, "The Wu-tribe's alchemic arts are truly extraordinary!"</p><p>Qin Sang didn't give her the entire *Panhu True Scripture*, but he discussed Daoist principles with Elder Yue, sharing his understanding to help her comprehension.</p><p>"I hope you will keep my trip to the Great Zhou confidential," Qin Sang said seriously.</p><p>Elder Yue glanced towards the hall's entrance.  As a grandmaster herself, she understood. She smiled, "I'm looking forward to your return, bringing some Wu-tribe secret techniques with you."</p><p>Qin Sang replied calmly, "If the opportunity arises, I'll keep an eye out for something suitable, Daoist Yue."</p><p>However, Qin Sang had no idea when he might return.</p><p>Elder Yue stayed a few more days before departing, leaving behind the Azure Frost Dew and the yellow leaf.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly was just one step away from its sixth transformation. Everything was prepared, so Qin Sang decided to wait until the Butterfly broke through before making any further plans.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Time flew by.</p><p>Seasons changed.</p><p>Eighteen years passed.</p><p>One day, the cave on the mountaintop opened, and a figure shot westwards.  After flying past Yue Du Bay and further west, into a deserted sea area, Qin Sang landed on the water's surface, concealing his movement techniques.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly gently fluttered on his shoulder.  After years of cultivation, its aura was perfectly roundedâ€”time for the breakthrough!</p><p>Because the Sky-Eyed Butterfly needed to absorb tribulation thunder, caution and secrecy were needed. Qin Sang had brought it to the deep sea for this.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>Qin Sang opened the jade bottle.</p><p>A refreshing, cool scent emanated. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's wingbeats quickened. It revealed its true form, a giant butterfly, instantly leaping towards Qin Sang, desperately trying to grab his finger, but failing, conveying its frustration and near tears through its thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang laughed heartily, no longer teasing it, and guided the elixir from the bottle, transforming it into a ribbon that flew towards the butterfly.</p>
