<h1>Chapter 1022: True Demonic Art</h1><p>Hearing Bai’s words, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>“I've seen her before! Back then, I was trapped in the Demonic Sea due to the demonic disturbance. At the invitation of Immortal Yue, I went to a place where True Demonic Qi converged and rescued her. I don't know if it was due to her constitution or cultivation technique, but she could directly absorb True Demonic Qi into her body, something even Nascent Soul cultivators couldn't do…”</p><p>“We haven't seen each other since. I don't know how Su Nü ended up serving the East Pole Alliance Leader…”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly recounted Su Nü’s origins, hoping to jog Bai’s memory. True Demonic Qi, also known as Ancient Demonic Qi, likely originated from the same era as Bai.</p><p>“True Demonic Qi…”</p><p>Bai fell silent, lost in thought.</p><p>Seeing no response from Bai, Qin Sang looked up at the approaching Su Nü. An idea struck him. He changed into a different mask and retrieved an ordinary spirit sword from his Mustard Seed Bag.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Focused on escaping, Su Nü failed to notice Qin Sang hidden nearby and flew overhead.</p><p>A moment later, a giant snow eagle arrived, enveloped in a gust of icy wind.</p><p>The instant the snow eagle flew past, Qin Sang struck.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The spirit sword sliced through the icy wind, its light flashing as it transformed into a spinning wheel of blades, aimed directly at the eagle’s belly.</p><p>Su Nü had seen the Ebony Sword during their last encounter and might recognize it. Qin Sang didn't want to expose his Qing Feng Daoist identity, which was linked to Old Devil Mu, so he used a different sword.</p><p>He had mastered the art of splitting sword light and could utilize the spinning sword technique even without his natal spirit sword.</p><p>As for the Demonic Transformation, very few knew about it, and Su Nü hadn't witnessed it firsthand, so there was no need to undo it.</p><p>The snow eagle, possessing formidable strength and keen senses, detected the danger the moment Qin Sang revealed himself.  It twisted its body mid-air, narrowly avoiding a fatal blow to its belly. Its wings, hard as iron, slammed towards the flying sword.</p><p>But how could Qin Sang's fully unleashed swordsmanship be so easily countered?</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A loud explosion echoed.</p><p>The snow eagle shrieked, its body sent tumbling sideways.  It struggled to regain its balance, flapping its wings frantically.</p><p>A trail of blood stained the ice, marking the long gash left by the sword on the eagle’s wing.</p><p>The eagle screamed in pain.</p><p>Hearing the commotion, Su Nü turned to see the scene and froze.</p><p>“What are you standing there for?! Help me slay this fiend! Do you want to attract more beasts?!”</p><p>Qin Sang glared at Su Nü and continued his assault on the snow eagle.</p><p>Looking at the mask Qin Sang wore, Su Nü couldn't fathom why this person would save her. Her mind raced, but considering her current predicament, what was the point of overthinking?</p><p>Resolutely, she swallowed a healing pill, suppressed her injuries, summoned her demonic blade, and joined Qin Sang in hunting the snow eagle.</p><p>While not using his full power, Qin Sang's masterful swordsmanship, particularly the spinning sword technique, forced the snow eagle into retreat.  Unwilling to reveal his most potent abilities, he summoned the White Crane to hasten the battle.</p><p>The White Crane, though weaker than the snow eagle, was cunning. It flitted around, targeting the eagle's underbelly, inflicting excruciating pain.</p><p>Ever since joining Qin Sang, the White Crane had employed this devious tactic.</p><p>Qin Sang, wincing each time he watched, swore he hadn't taught the creature this; it was simply its nature.</p><p>Seeing its effectiveness, however, he let it be.</p><p>With the White Crane and Su Nü joining the fray, the snow eagle was overwhelmed.</p><p>Instinctively sensing the danger, it tried to flee, but it was too late.</p><p>‘Thump!’</p><p>The White Crane unexpectedly plunged its claw into the eagle's rear.</p><p>The eagle cried out, its eyes bulging.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Su Nü’s demonic blade struck the snow eagle squarely.</p><p>White feathers scattered as the eagle shrieked, lost its balance, and crashed onto the ice.</p><p>Immediately after, a brilliant burst of sword light, like a cascading silver river, engulfed the snow eagle.  The ice was stained crimson, the blood quickly freezing into scarlet shards.</p><p>The snow eagle lay motionless, dead.</p><p>The White Crane, its claws dripping with blood, wiped them disdainfully on the eagle’s white feathers.</p><p>Su Nü glanced at the eagle, then the crane, and finally at Qin Sang. She bowed gracefully, expressing her gratitude. “My name is Su Nü. Thank you, fellow Daoist, for saving me!”</p><p>Ignoring the White Crane's protests, Qin Sang recalled it to the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings. He then incinerated the eagle's carcass, eliminating the bloody scent, and said coldly, "Hmph! You dared to lure ferocious beasts here, endangering me. If not for my need to search for spiritual herbs nearby and my desire to prevent you from causing chaos, I wouldn't care if you lived or died!"</p><p>Hearing these words, Su Nü felt a sense of relief.  She spoke earnestly, "Regardless, fellow Daoist, you saved my life. This is an undeniable fact. May I know your identity? Should the opportunity arise, I will repay this life-saving grace.”</p><p>Her eyes flickered, her expression a picture of vulnerable gratitude.</p><p>Unfortunately, such tactics were useless against the iron-hearted Qin Sang.</p><p>“Let's leave this place before we talk…”</p><p>Qin Sang pushed off the ground, activating his movement technique and flying away.</p><p>Su Nü stamped her foot in frustration, but not daring to leave on her own, she quickly followed.  “Thank you for the reminder, fellow Daoist. I was besieged by a group of ferocious beasts after slaying two lesser demons and staying in one place for too long.  I barely managed to escape them, only to be pursued by this snow eagle. I was at my limit, fortunate to encounter you and have my life spared."</p><p>Her story wasn't entirely fabricated.</p><p>She had been pursued by the Ice Flood Dragon King. After activating a talisman, she nearly escaped, but the Ice Flood Dragon King summoned other powerful demons.  She exhausted all her means to evade the Ice Flood Dragon King, only to be relentlessly pursued by the swift snow eagle.</p><p>Recalling the perilous situation, Su Nü still felt a lingering fear.</p><p>The two flew for some distance, one behind the other.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, turning to face Su Nü.</p><p>Su Nü’s hands clenched nervously.</p><p>“Your cultivation technique seems quite peculiar. I’ve never encountered anything similar before,” Qin Sang scrutinized Su Nü, feigning ignorance. “The aura you emanated while wielding that black blade earlier, it wasn’t spiritual power, was it? It resembled demonic qi, yet was distinctly different. What kind of power is it?”</p><p>Su Nü's expression relaxed slightly. She replied softly, "The power I wield is indeed not spiritual power. However, even if you haven't seen it, you must have heard of it. It’s called True Demonic Qi.”</p><p>“True Demonic Qi?”</p><p>Qin Sang feigned surprise.  “The demonic qi said to exist in ancient times, with only remnants found in a few special locations today? Even demonic cultivators fear it, yet you can cultivate with it? Could it be that you cultivate an ancient demonic art?”</p><p>Su Nü shook her head, answering honestly, “I don't know if it’s an ancient demonic art. This cultivation technique was bestowed upon me by a senior in my sect.  They only told me its name, *True Demonic Art*, without revealing its true origins.”</p><p>“True Demonic Art.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, secretly inquiring with Bai if it triggered any memories.</p>
