<h1>Chapter 1820: Allies</h1><p>In the quiet void, drifts a cluster of green lights.</p><p>The green light is faint, a reflection from the smooth surface of green leaves.  Palm-sized leaves are tightly stacked together, forming a sphere.</p><p>In this void, only these exist. These leaves seem like rootless duckweed, floating in the emptiness.</p><p>The inside of the leaves is hollow, with steel-hard branches interwoven, creating a space large enough to hold several people, resembling cages.</p><p>Currently, all the cages are empty.</p><p>These "cages" provide the Wood Spirit power, nourishing the Wood Spirit body.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by Cui Niao, returned here, flying to a central "cage" and carefully examining it before making a hand gesture.</p><p>Immediately, unusual lights flickered within several green light clusters—the formation flags Qin Sang had previously set up.</p><p>He had already laid a net here, waiting for Hong Yuzi to fall into it.</p><p>He glanced at Cui Niao; the bird remained motionless, as if dead.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged above the "cage," closed his eyes, and entered a meditative state, waiting for the opportune moment.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao were traversing illusions, heading towards their last destination, the illusion that injured Hong Yuzi.</p><p>Simultaneously, Xia Hou and Qing Fei both entered the Jushan altar, passing through the Nine-Curve Star River.</p><p>Only Qing Fei knew the location of the innate spiritual treasure; she led the way, with Xia Hou closely following.</p><p>The two demons swiftly moved through the illusions. If Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao could see their path, they would be shocked; the demons' direction was exactly the same as theirs.</p><p>Moreover, they were faster, seemingly pursuing them.</p><p>Although Qing Fei's cultivation was not as high as Xia Hou's, she was also a mid-stage Nascent Soul demon, surpassing Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Qing Fei and Xia Hou boldly charged through areas Mo Xingdao cautiously avoided due to sensed danger.</p><p>Qing Fei was clearly very familiar with this place, expertly avoiding all dangers and warning Xia Hou.</p><p>Xia Hou was most relaxed, occasionally lending a hand, leisurely following behind, admiring Qing Fei's alluring figure.</p><p>…</p><p>“We’ve arrived.”</p><p>After passing through a field of rubble, Mo Xingdao stopped, turning to Hong Yuzi, his voice weary.</p><p>Before them shone a brilliant golden light.</p><p>Atop a massive stone, larger than any mountain, devoid of vegetation, stood eight golden pillars.</p><p>Golden dragons were carved on the pillars, lifelike, seeming ready to spring to life and leap forth.</p><p>Each pillar was of equal height—seventy-seven forty-nine zhang —with a flat top, forming a circular platform.</p><p>And indeed, the dragons could come alive.</p><p>This was where they had previously failed.</p><p>The deeper into the altar, the more dangerous it became, but some areas remained peaceful and stable over the years, serving as resting places.</p><p>This was one such place.  Last time, they each chose a pillar to rest; when the golden light burst forth, the dragons were awakened, attacking fiercely.</p><p>In an instant, a murderous aura filled the air.</p><p>Amidst the dragons' roars, the pillars released incredible sword energy, as if they were not pillars but eight peerless divine swords.</p><p>The sudden change caught them off guard. If Hong Yuzi hadn't protected him, Mo Xingdao would have been instantly dismembered.  Hong Yuzi was severely injured as a result.</p><p>Now, the pillars and dragons were restored, and the place was once again peaceful.</p><p>Only they knew the danger lurking beneath the calm.</p><p>The two gazed at the pillars, confirming that the dragons had not revived. Mo Xingdao breathed a sigh of relief and sat cross-legged at the edge of the giant stone to recover.</p><p>Even without any sign of danger, he dared not approach the pillars again.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was severely depleted; he had relied on Hong Yuzi's assistance to navigate the last few illusions.  On his own, he would have faced further difficulties.</p><p>Hong Yuzi stood behind Mo Xingdao, patiently waiting for him to recover, his gaze fixed on the pillars, as if trying to uncover their secrets.</p><p>However, their purpose here wasn't the pillars, so Hong Yuzi didn't act rashly.</p><p>Soon, Mo Xingdao recovered. He wasn't injured, only exhausted.</p><p>“Friend Mo, any new discoveries?”</p><p>Seeing Mo Xingdao awake, Hong Yuzi asked.</p><p>Mo Xingdao rose, his gaze moving beyond the eight golden pillars towards the rear.</p><p>Behind them were black and white energies, like vast clouds merging, with a distinct boundary.</p><p>Clearly, there were two illusions, converging at this point.</p><p>Mo Xingdao stared for a moment, shook his head slightly, and pointed towards the white cloud.  “Let's proceed as planned.  I count on your assistance, Friend Dao.”</p><p>Going deeper without understanding the illusions, given his cultivation, he couldn't go far.</p><p>Hong Yuzi had to intervene personally, providing support from the side.</p><p>Hong Yuzi agreed, a thought flickered in his mind, and talismans spontaneously formed, transforming into a stream of light flying towards Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao remained still, calmly accepting it.  Moments later, he was clad in silver armor.</p><p>His puppet body was already strong, and with the added talismanic armor, he could handle most dangers.</p><p>Hong Yuzi himself didn't wear armor; he only took out a whisk and swept it gently forward.</p><p>Star-like dust floated up, forming a faint luminous path before them, disappearing into the deep clouds.</p><p>The two proceeded one after the other along the path.</p><p>Even Hong Yuzi couldn't charge recklessly through these illusions. He sometimes used various treasures and talismans to probe, sometimes stopping to ponder.</p><p>Proceeding in this stop-and-go manner, they passed through three illusions without major incident.</p><p>Throughout, Mo Xingdao remained silent, his dark eyes occasionally glancing at Hong Yuzi. There was no deliberate guidance; it seemed he had forgotten his agreement with Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, Qing Fei and Xia Hou followed closely behind, seeing the large stone and eight golden pillars.</p><p>"Good. If there are further difficulties, we can return here to rest."</p><p>Xia Hou confirmed there was no danger here, a little surprised. He immediately flew to the top of one of the pillars.</p><p>Qing Fei, however, stayed below, seeming to have noticed something amiss.  Her brows furrowed slightly as she paced around the pillar, finally stopping at the edge of the clouds, standing there for a long time.</p><p>Xia Hou, drawn by Qing Fei's strange behavior, asked questioningly, "Friend, what did you find? Did we come to the wrong place?"</p><p>Qing Fei shook her head, remaining silent.  With a flash, she dashed into the cloud illusion.</p><p>Xia Hou frowned, and had no choice but to follow.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang remained oblivious, still waiting for the fish to bite…</p><p>Deep within the Altar.</p><p>A magnificent palace stood quietly amidst the illusions. The palace was empty, deathly silent.</p><p>The palace was likely also a manifestation of divine power, for it was too perfect— intricately carved beams and pillars, elegantly upturned eaves, and not a single scratch on the exterior walls; it looked newly built.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The back wall of the palace suddenly shook violently, several cracks running through it before it collapsed with a thunderous roar.</p><p>Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao emerged from the dust.</p><p>"Well, I didn't expect such an open space deep within the Altar! Remarkable! Remarkable! Mo, take a look, does it feel familiar?" Hong Yuzi raised his whisk, pointing ahead.</p><p>The illusory space deep within the Altar was chaotic, not existing on a single plane, but intersecting and even overlapping.</p><p>Beyond the wall was a vast expanse of auspicious clouds.  The view from here was excellent; they could see multicolored lights shimmering in the distance— the manifestations of various illusions.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's eyes flashed. This was the moment he'd been waiting for. He stepped forward, gazing ahead, pretending to carefully discern the illusions, sometimes bowing his head in thought, comparing them to fragments of his memory.</p><p>"Let's investigate… there first!"</p><p>Mo Xingdao pointed towards a crimson illusion to the right, his tone feigning hesitation.</p><p>This would prevent Hong Yuzi from suspecting anything.</p><p>Hong Yuzi, indeed, remained unsuspicious, immediately flying towards the illusion Mo Xingdao had indicated.</p><p>Shortly after they left, the gap in the palace's back wall repaired itself, but soon another tremor occurred, causing it to crack open again.</p><p>Qing Fei and Xia Hou emerged from the opening.</p><p>Qing Fei's expression was extremely serious, her gaze heavy, her beauty undiminished, possessing an unusual allure.</p><p>Xia Hou also realized something was wrong and waited for Qing Fei's explanation.</p><p>Qing Fei glanced around, sighing, "Indeed! We're too late."</p><p>Xia Hou's brow furrowed even deeper. "Friend, shouldn't you give this Marquis an explanation? You said only you knew the location of that innate spiritual treasure; were you deceiving this Marquis!"</p><p>From Qing Fei's tone, the treasure had been obtained by someone else.</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes instantly flashed with killing intent.</p><p>The woman beside him was stunning, a rare beauty in the world, and Xia Hou had long considered taking her as his concubine.</p><p>But if the woman dared deceive him, he wouldn't hesitate to eliminate her!</p><p>Qing Fei's expression shifted several times. She whispered, "Have you forgotten? I said before that the ancient treasures within the Altar that have survived to this day are all extremely well-hidden and difficult to find. Back then, I was tracking a human cultivator when I learned the treasure's location; otherwise, I wouldn't have come so far."</p><p>"Him?" Xia Hou stared intently at Qing Fei, the killing intent in his eyes slightly subsiding, but suspicion remained.  "You said this person died in the Altar."</p><p>A cultivator of only early Cave Xuan realm, heavily wounded and fleeing years ago, shouldn't have survived leaving the altar.  I never expected him to be alive," Qing Fei sighed. "Human calculations are inferior to Heaven's will. Not only is he still alive, but he's also brought help, clearly plotting for this treasure. I'm skilled in tracking. I sensed two people's auras in the Golden Pillar space; they stayed there a long time. One is very familiar—him—and the other... is very strong!"</p><p>"How strong?" Xia Hou sneered.</p><p>"What if it's a late Cave Xuan cultivator? And there might be more than just two of them," Qing Fei said seriously.</p><p>Late Cave Xuan cultivators are mostly from Daoist sects, either sect leaders or high-ranking officials.  Such figures have many followers.</p><p>Xia Hou stopped sneering.  It knew its own weaknesses. It wasn't afraid of a late Cave Xuan cultivator, but if the opponent brought all their subordinates, openly prepared for battle, it would have to retreat.</p><p>However, if the opponent brought so many people, they would have already taken the treasure; why wait until now?</p><p>Qing Fei said, "The treasure is in a strange hall.  When I fought that person back then, we clashed inside the hall. I heavily wounded him and drove him back, but I was also backlashed and couldn't take the treasure.  I used the surrounding illusions to hide the hall. He only knows the general location and hasn't found the exact spot yet, so he's searching nearby."</p><p>Xia Hou uttered an "Oh," realizing, "In that case, let's just ignore them and take the treasure.  Let them continue searching."</p><p>"No!"</p><p>Qing Fei was frantic. "The hall is strange and hard to enter.  Forcibly entering will cause a huge commotion. Even with the illusions, if they don't notice, they'll sense it through the hall's key and come looking."</p><p>"Key?" Xia Hou snorted. "You didn't mention needing a key before!"</p><p>Qing Fei explained, "Because the key is with that person. I thought it would be trapped with him in some illusion and couldn't be found.  You can break the ancient prohibitions and enter the hall without the key, but it's dangerous. The worst thing is that before we even open the hall, they find us and ambush us, and we end up working for them."</p><p>Xia Hou understood her implication and examined Qing Fei. "You want to..."</p><p>Qing Fei nodded. "Before they find the treasure, they won't leave. We need to find a way to delay them."</p><p>Qing Fei searched around and returned, "There are only two auras here."</p><p>Based on their detected auras, the late Cave Xuan cultivator hasn't brought any help.</p><p>Seeing Qing Fei wasn't lying, Xia Hou started thinking seriously. "The enemy is in the open, we're hidden.  If we work together, killing that person isn't difficult, but the key might not be with him."</p><p>Qing Fei agreed. "You hold off the late Cave Xuan cultivator, and I'll deal with that person.  We should be able to capture him. If we can't get the key, we can only try to trap the strong cultivator and take the treasure before he escapes. But if you have a way to kill the strong cultivator..."</p><p>She paused, looking at Xia Hou.</p><p>Xia Hou remained silent.</p><p>Their opponent's identity was still unclear.</p><p>If the human cultivator cultivates the Golden Seal Altar, Xia Hou wouldn't fear him.</p><p>If he's a Daoist court official, he'd likely cultivate the Military Altar; if he sets up formations, Xia Hou would have to retreat.</p><p>Of course, since they were hidden, they could take the opponent by surprise, preventing them from deploying their formations.</p><p>However, regardless of their opponent's identity, there's considerable risk.</p><p>Killing a human late Cave Xuan cultivator would be a great achievement, but Xia Hou wanted the innate spiritual treasure more.</p><p>After careful consideration, Xia Hou didn't want to fight a same-realm cultivator to the death; it was better to trap the opponent.</p><p>"Let's find out that person's identity first, then decide."</p><p>Xia Hou said calmly.</p><p>Seeing Xia Hou so calm, Qing Fei didn't say anything else and could only bow her head in agreement.</p><p>...</p><p>In the distance.</p><p>Qin Sang sat motionless, his breath slightly rising and falling, having waited for an unknown amount of time. The kingfisher still hadn't woken up.</p><p>Suddenly, the kingfisher's wings fluttered, and it soared into the air, transmitting Mo Xing Dao's urgent, almost frantic shout: "Someone's attacking!"</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly woke up, startled at first, then understood, rising abruptly, "You're in danger?"</p><p>"Someone's attacking us!"</p><p>"People?" Qin Sang was shocked. "Are there other people here?"</p><p>"The Qinghu Saint King! It's her, and another demonic cultivator! Save me..." The kingfisher flew urgently, Mo Xing Dao's voice becoming increasingly frantic and then gradually weaker, apparently using some secret technique to forcefully transmit the message.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King!</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed drastically, and he was about to chase after the kingfisher, but suddenly stopped, staring intently at the bird, "Why would she attack you?"</p><p>Logically, they fell into this realm together and all wanted to find the ascension path; they should be natural allies!</p><p></p>
