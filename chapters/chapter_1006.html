<h1>Chapter 998: Late Core Formation Stage</h1><p>After testing his physical changes in the uninhabited sea, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling to continue his cultivation.</p><p>Seasons changed.</p><p>Eight years had passed since Qin Sang arrived at the Heavenly Dao Sect's market.</p><p>Less than a year remained before his appointed meeting with Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Aside from occasional outings to discuss the Dao with fellow cultivators, Qin Sang had spent almost all his time diligently cultivating in his cave dwelling. With the solid foundation he had built, his cultivation steadily increased as he focused on inscribing Killing Talismans and refining his True Essence.</p><p>Now, the first Killing Talisman created by Senior Qing Zhu was about to be completed.</p><p>Qin Sang had been in closed-door cultivation for several months.</p><p>He examined his inner self and confirmed that there were no abnormalities.</p><p>The Killing Talismans on his spirit sword were also very stable.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, his mind sinking into his Purple Mansion, and inscribed the final stroke on the Ebony Sword!</p><p>……</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from seclusion and walked quickly towards the city gates. He then summoned his flying light and soared towards another deserted sea area.</p><p>His aura revealed that he had reached the Late Core Formation stage!</p><p>Qin Sang had already been in the Mid Core Formation stage before entering the Seven Killing Hall, and only now had he broken through again.</p><p>"It feels good to have no bottlenecks."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and summoned the Ebony Sword.</p><p>He had focused on improving his cultivation and hadn't let the Ebony Sword continue to absorb the Soul Nourishing Wood, so it remained a high-grade magical treasure.</p><p>Once all his matters were settled, he could find a safe cave dwelling and continue to enhance the Ebony Sword. With the remaining Soul Nourishing Wood, it wouldn't be difficult to raise the Ebony Sword to the peak-grade magical treasure level.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew that relying solely on spirit materials wouldn't be enough to advance the Ebony Sword to a spiritual treasure.</p><p>He had befriended several fellow cultivators skilled in refining tools and learned some secrets during their discussions.</p><p>The key to a spiritual treasure lay in the word 'spiritual'!</p><p>It wasn't about a tool spirit, but about spirituality.</p><p>Treasures that birthed tool spirits were considered supreme treasures even in ancient times.</p><p>Before a tool spirit could be born, imbuing a magical treasure with a touch of spirituality was an essential step.</p><p>However, no one knew how to make a magical treasure develop spirituality, including these refining masters.</p><p>A refining master surnamed Guo seemed to recall something and said, "It is said that a cultivator's natal magical treasure, cultivated alongside their life force, is more likely to develop spirituality than ordinary magical treasures. This is one of the benefits of a natal magical treasure…"</p><p>Everyone discussed amongst themselves, but no clear conclusion was reached.</p><p>Someone self-deprecatingly said, "With our cultivation level, we can't even guarantee success in refining low-grade magical treasures, so let's not aim too high. Spiritual treasures are extremely distant from us, and I haven't heard of any spiritual treasures appearing in the world. In the entire current cultivation world, there may not even be a single spiritual treasure…"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, that's too assertive! I suspect that a long-standing, top-tier sect like the Heavenly Dao Sect should have some spiritual treasures in their collection. Not to mention the treasures obtained from secret realms like the Seven Killing Hall. Late Nascent Soul Grand Cultivators should be able to refine their natal magical treasures to the peak-grade magical treasure level. According to Fellow Daoist Guo, natal magical treasures are more likely to develop spirituality. It's impossible that none of the Grand Cultivators throughout history possessed a spiritual treasure."</p><p>Another person voiced their objection, turning to a white-haired elder beside them with anticipation, "Daoist Wu hails from the Heavenly Dao Sect and must know many untold secrets. Could you perhaps reveal a thing or two?"</p><p>The white-haired elder turned out to be a Heavenly Dao Sect cultivator.</p><p>It was thanks to the elder that everyone was able to gather here.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the elder smiled wryly, "I've been dispatched to the market, so how many secrets could I possibly know? My understanding of spiritual treasures is no greater than yours. However, I agree with your speculation. It's simply because our cultivation is too low to reach that level…"</p><p>Refining Master Guo chuckled and interrupted, "I only said that it's easier for natal magical treasures to develop spirituality than ordinary magical treasures, but I didn't say it's easy for them to develop spirituality… Fellow Daoists, consider the difference between peak-grade magical instruments and magical treasures. I imagine the difference between peak-grade magical treasures and spiritual treasures, in terms of spirit materials and power, is also worlds apart."</p><p>Listening to their discussion, Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>The Eighteen Demonic Banners were special. Individually, each banner was only equivalent to a low-grade magical treasure, and their power came from demonic fire, making the possibility of developing spirituality extremely slim. He could only pin his hopes on the Ebony Sword.</p><p>With the Soul Nourishing Wood integrated, the Ebony Sword's material quality wasn't a concern.</p><p>He just didn't know how to make it develop spirituality and advance to a spiritual treasure.</p><p>However, two peak-grade magical treasures were enough for him to be invincible after reaching the Nascent Soul stage. There was still plenty of time in the future, so there was no need to rush.</p><p>Recalling these thoughts, Qin Sang's fingers subconsciously brushed against the spirit sword, feeling its smooth texture.</p><p>"Sword Wheel!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted softly, and the sword wheel reappeared.</p><p>Previously, he had focused on cultivation and hadn't properly comprehended the Sword Dao. Once he thoroughly understood the insights gained on the Sword Path, the sword wheel would surely have a different appearance.</p><p>After testing the sword wheel's power, Qin Sang withdrew the Ebony Sword and activated his talismans, simultaneously activating the Heavenly Demon Transformation technique.</p><p>His escape technique was still the most important.</p><p>At the Late Core Formation stage, he could unleash the full power of the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman.</p><p>The "Heavenly Demon Refining Form" had also long since advanced.</p><p>Sword light surrounded his body, intertwined with the phantom of a Flood Dragon.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down, then his phoenix wings suddenly flapped, and his figure vanished.</p><p>In the next instant, a bolt of lightning appeared out of nowhere in the void, accompanied by the sound of thunder.</p><p>'Boom…'</p><p>Thunder rumbled.</p><p>On a whim, Qin Sang flew continuously.</p><p>After a long while, he finally stopped and withdrew his flying light.</p><p>By now, he was quite far from the previous sea area.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled and recalled the feeling from moments ago.</p><p>In terms of pure flying speed, he far surpassed his speed from ten years ago when he was pursued by Old Devil Mou.</p><p>Among Core Formation cultivators, it would be difficult to find someone whose escape technique could rival his. Many were proficient in one escape technique, but mastering three top-tier escape techniques like him was exceptionally rare.</p><p>He could easily toy with fellow cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>However, compared to Nascent Soul cultivators, Qin Sang couldn't draw a definitive conclusion. After all, there was a major realm difference.</p><p>After testing all his treasures and techniques, Qin Sang returned to his cave dwelling to stabilize his cultivation.</p><p>Soon, he would go to the storm belt for his meeting with Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Before that, Qin Sang decided to pay a visit to the Heavenly Dao Sect.</p><p>Over the years, he had not only interacted with Core Formation disciples of the Heavenly Dao Sect, but he had also learned the names of many of their Nascent Soul Patriarchs.</p><p>Some of these Nascent Soul Patriarchs were involved in external affairs, while others were very mysterious, living in seclusion and focusing on cultivation.</p><p>None of those he had heard of matched the description of the Ning surname sword cultivator.</p><p>Several months later, Qin Sang emerged from seclusion and activated the restriction on Bai's cave dwelling.</p><p>This time, Bai wouldn't be going with him.</p><p>The cave dwelling's entrance opened, and Qin Sang walked in. He found Bai still enveloped in corpse Qi, but his expression was much more lively than a Flying Celestial Night Devil.</p><p>Qin Sang occasionally went out, while Bai remained in closed-door cultivation, making various attempts.</p><p>Finally, the innate life force within his body gradually stabilized.</p><p>Qin Sang said with relief, "Fellow Daoist, your condition looks good. You shouldn't have to worry about the corpse Qi invasion for now, right?"</p><p>Bai nodded but didn't show much joy. "This isn't enough. With only Core Formation level strength, it's difficult to accomplish anything in the cultivation world. Unfortunately, I still don't dare to rashly attempt to break through to the Corpse King stage."</p>
