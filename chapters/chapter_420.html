Chapter 413: Austere Cultivation


Early that morning.
The Jian Ge remained closed.
Qin Sang was in the cave in the backyard. The cave's protective formations were open.  Qin Sang, undisturbed, stared intently at a spirit array before him.
This spirit array was a family heirloom of Master Wu, specifically designed for refining magic weapons.
The array could gather spirit energy into fire. The array's requirements were not complicated; the most valuable material needed was a peculiar spirit material called Flameheart Stone.
Using the Flameheart Stone as a conduit, spirit fire was born. Master Wu called this fire "Stonefire."
This Stonefire had absolutely nothing to do with the legendary Samadhi True Fire; their power levels were worlds apart.
However, this spirit array-generated Stonefire had one advantage: it was very gentle and easy to control, making it ideal for beginners.
Besides that, it had other merits. Its power depended on the amount of Flameheart Stone used. With enough Flameheart Stone, it could even barely be used to refine high-grade magic weapons.
With this array, Qin Sang temporarily didn't need to rent a ground fire for refining weapons, saving him a lot of money.
However, the price of Flameheart Stone was not low.  It was foreseeable that Qin Sang would be operating at a loss for a long time.
The array was laid out, and Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the center. Before him, a thumb-sized, pale white flame appeared out of thin air. The flame was very quiet, without any flickering, at first glance, it looked like a still object.
But the flame's temperature was very high, with waves of heat washing over him.
The air was also distorting.
Qin Sang enveloped the flame with his spiritual sense. As Master Wu had said, the flame's temperament was gentle, and after familiarization, it could be easily controlled. When refining weapons, he wouldn't have to worry about failing due to poor flame control.
Such a small flame was clearly insufficient for refining weapons.
Qin Sang flipped his hand, taking out several white Flameheart Stones and flicking them out, landing them in various places within the array.  Immediately, the flame swelled, expanding several times in size.
The temperature in the cave suddenly rose.
Qin Sang nodded with satisfaction, controlling the new flame. Then, with a sweep of his hand across his pouch, several things flew out, floating beside him.
Among them were several white spider silks and some emerald green jade, even more dazzling than the most precious gems in the mortal world.
The silk from the Cold Spider beast and the Qinglan Stone; these two were very common spirit materials in the cultivation world. Their spiritual essence was chaotic, at most able to be used to refine the most inferior low-grade magic weapons.
Qin Sang planned to start with low-grade magic weapons, building a solid foundation, and gradually improving.
Choosing these two materials was to refine a spirit sword imbued with water elemental power—a very good weapon for low-level cultivators.
Every step was carefully planned, including the magic weapon to be refined, a plan carefully devised by Qin Sang and Master Wu after an all-night discussion.
Thanks to Master Wu's selfless teaching, Qin Sang had the confidence to do this.
Qin Sang picked up a palm-sized piece of Qinglan Stone. With a slight exertion of his finger, the Qinglan Stone shattered with a "pop." Qin Sang's force was precise, removing only the most impure parts, not a bit more, not a bit less.
Then, Qin Sang tossed the Qinglan Stone fragments into the Stonefire.
The flame flickered, and the impurities of the Qinglan Stone were gradually burned away, leaving only the purest part, containing abundant water elemental power.
However, this water elemental power was very violent, making it difficult to combine and condense into a sword.
Qin Sang immediately picked up a spider silk and threw it in. The silk melted, like cold marrow, quite viscous, dripping onto the Qinglan Stone, gradually smoothing its violent nature.
Repeating this process, the two spirit materials gradually blended together, eventually merging into one, then transforming into a sword shape.
Finally, Qin Sang reached into the flame and pulled out a three-foot-long green blade.
The sword was long and slender, entirely emerald green, with a white stripe in the middle, quite eye-catching.
The first attempt at refining a weapon was successful, which was normal. With Qin Sang's Foundation Establishment Mid-stage cultivation, his control of spiritual sense and spiritual energy far surpassed Master Wu's. It would have been unusual for him to fail in refining a low-grade magic weapon.
After looking at the spirit sword for a while, Qin Sang reflected on the process, then casually threw the sword aside and continued refining.
One low-grade spirit sword after another was produced. Qin Sang became increasingly proficient. He focused his attention on the contents of the jade slip, feeling a deeper understanding than before.
He accidentally failed a few times along the way when trying new things, but it was inconsequential.
A month later, Qin Sang finally came out of the cave, walked into the shop, looked around, and with a point of his finger, a shelf appeared out of thin air in an empty space, filled with spirit swords.
Not only were there low-grade spirit swords, but also several mid-grade spirit swords.


The shop finally had a bit of that "Sword Pavilion" feel.

This was the result of Qin Sang's month of hard work. He'd spent the past month practicing diligently, testing all his ideas, and beginning to attempt refining mid-grade magical artifacts, aiming to fully grasp this section of the jade slip.

His progress was considerable, but some aspects still required further study.  However, there was no need to remain secluded in his cave dwelling indefinitely. He could use this time to visit Wuyagu Valley.

He could hone his skills while reflecting on his experiences, and also gather the materials he needed for refining artifacts in the valley.

Upon his return from his training, he would resume his studies of artifact refinement and cultivation.

For the coming years, he would live a life of austerity, making the most of every second.  The driving force behind this was the foreseeable substantial rewards in the future!

He pushed open the door.

The midday sun streamed in, warming him pleasantly.

Passersby on the street, hearing the sound, looked over in surprise, wondering which shopkeeper was so lazy as to be opening their shop so late in the day.

"I need to find an assistant,"

Qin Sang muttered to himself.

That day, Qin Sang went to the mortal employment agency, and after looking around, he brought back two people.

One was a thin, lanky young man like a beanpole, named Ning Youwei, a cultivator, though his cultivation was only at the second level of Qi Condensation.

The other was Ning Youwei's mother, recently recovered from a serious illness, and also frail.

Ning Youwei and his mother were original residents of Qingyang Market. Ning Youwei's mother had married a cultivator in her youth – Ning Youwei's father.

His father had poor aptitude and low cultivation, but he held the title of a cultivator and inherited his ancestors' wealth, allowing him to own a cave dwelling in the market and live comfortably.

Unfortunately, fate dealt a cruel blow. Ning Youwei's father encountered an accident while training outside the market and never returned.  Mother and son relied on each other, and then his mother fell seriously ill.

The son was filial, selling all his father's belongings and finally selling their cave dwelling to another cultivator to obtain the medicinal herbs that cured his mother's illness.

However, this left them destitute and without a place to live.

Ning Youwei's talent was even worse than his father's, his cultivation barely surpassing that of a mortal.  Turning his life around was incredibly difficult, so to make a living he resorted to competing with mortals for work.

Qin Sang verified Ning Youwei's story, and brought them back to the shop.

He needed someone to help, and this man seemed trustworthy.

He wasn't aiming for booming business; he just needed someone to watch the shop.
