<h1>Chapter 758: Shadowing</h1><p>Demon Path, Merchant League.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't fathom what undercurrents flowed beneath the seemingly calm surface of the Boundless Sea.</p><p>He cautiously approached, noticing restrictions left by Xiang Yi. Standing at the edge, he gazed at the deceased Pan and the Earth-splitting Lizard.</p><p>Pan stared wide-eyed, his expression frozen in death. Everything below his waist had vanished, the wound radiating a peculiar water-type energy.</p><p>The Earth-splitting Lizard was also torn in two, its lower half, like Pan's, reduced to dust.</p><p>The lingering power on their bodies must have been the Water罡 Divine Thunder that Xiang Yi mentioned.</p><p>"The residual power is this strong. The Water罡 Divine Thunder's might probably surpasses my Fire Pearls. The question is, how many does Xiang Yi possess?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious, hesitation flickering in his eyes. He carefully retreated, careful not to disturb anything and leave traces for Xiang Yi to discover.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't leave, remaining where he was, waiting.</p><p>After some time, he finally heard voices. Holding his breath, he strained to pinpoint their location, discerning a group of six.</p><p>"The Liu couple and the young swordsman have been rescued."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, listening intently. He wondered how Xiang Yi explained everything along the way.</p><p>The six arrived at the edge of the deep pit. The Liu couple and the young swordsman looked at the two corpses, unsurprised.  "It really was the Earth-splitting Lizard! This man truly was a Demon Path spy?" they exclaimed hatefully.</p><p>Xiang Yi nodded. "Most likely. Before we left, the Merchant League warned me to be cautious.  I deliberately withheld the full details of the mission as a precaution.  I didn't expect him to be so cunning, creating a diversion under everyone's noses and attracting the Purple Star Eagles. It's a pity about Daoist Qing Feng.  We searched for so long but couldn't find him. I fear the worst."</p><p>Madam Liu and her husband exchanged glances, sighing. "When the Earth-splitting Lizard and the Purple Star Eagles attacked, I noticed Daoist Qing Feng was in the worst possible position. He was practically knocked directly into the horde of beasts, with no time to react before being overwhelmed by the Purple Star Eagles. While his escaping technique is excellent, it wasn't much use in that situation.  His cultivation is still a bit too low.  My cultivation is similar to his, and facing the beasts and the poisonous mist simultaneously, I quickly felt overwhelmed. If my husband hadn't rescued me in time, I fear I too..."</p><p>Madam Liu's face was pale with lingering fear.</p><p>Mister Liu embraced his wife, comforting her briefly before speaking gravely. "Despite that, we can't simply assume Daoist Qing Feng is dead. The beasts are gathering, and we haven't explored the entire area.  Don't forget, Daoist Qing Feng is not only skilled in escaping techniques, but also in corpse refinement. There might still be hope. In this perilous place, every person adds to our chances of survival. We can't give up on him so easily. After we recover, let's join forces and search again. Fellow Daoist Xiang, we should still have enough time with the Bone Lotus, correct?"</p><p>Cui Ji and the richly dressed, stout man remained impassive.</p><p>Xiang Yi considered this, then slowly nodded. "Fellow Daoist Liu is right. In that case, everyone should recover their strength quickly.  We had ample time before, but after this chaos, things are getting tight. You've all experienced how terrifying it is to be submerged in that beast horde. Even Fellow Daoist Liu and I wouldn't last long without the Bone Lotus's protection.  We'll have at most two lotus petals' worth of time to rescue Daoist Qing Feng.  We'll do our best and leave the rest to fate."</p><p>By now, everyone was exhausted, their true essence nearly depleted.</p><p>The young swordsman sat down cross-legged, frowning. "Fellow Daoist Xiang, can you explain the mission clearly now?  We don't want to experience another inexplicable beast ambush."</p><p>Xiang Yi didn't hesitate.  "I concealed it earlier to guard against the spy, but now there's no need for secrecy.  This stone hall is the first stage. There are three such halls in the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone.  It's said the other two are similar to this one, sealed by restrictions and relatively safe.  We just need to open the three stone halls, then proceed to a place resembling an ancient divine platform to leave the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone..."</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang listened in secret.</p><p>He didn't know how Xiang Yi explained things, but it seemed the Liu couple and the young swordsman had bought his lies.</p><p>Hearing Xiang Yi explain the mission, an idea sparked in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>At the other two stone halls, if there wasn't a second person to create chaos, there likely wouldn't be a chance for revenge.</p><p>He considered emulating Pan, luring the beasts to disrupt their formation.</p><p>But after careful thought, he decided the chances were slim.</p><p>He didn't know what the Earth-splitting Lizard had done to enrage the Purple Star Eagles at their nest, causing them to swarm and allowing him to navigate the forbidden zone with such ease. The timing was too perfect to replicate.</p><p>The final ancient divine platform, which even Xiang Yi seemed unsure about, might be his only opportunity.</p><p>His enemies weren't just Cui Ji, but also Xiang Yi and the richly dressed, stout man.</p><p>All three were stronger than him.  He was confident he could take on anyone but Xiang Yi if he found them alone.</p><p>Facing Xiang Yi was tricky. The Water罡 Divine Thunder was terrifying.  Only by using the Fire Pearls and gaining the upper hand could he kill him. But the Fire Pearls were his strongest asset, and compared to revenge, the upcoming Heavenly Tower journey was more important.  It was best to save the Fire Pearls for then, to face unknown dangers.</p><p>One was momentary vengeance; the other concerned Nascent Soul formation. The choice was clear.</p><p>Qin Sang was always patient. He lurked in the shadows, waiting for the right moment.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others rested for a while, recovering their strength before returning to the battlefield. It was even more gruesome and dangerous than before.  Their search proved fruitless, and they retreated in disarray.</p><p>"Neither hide nor hair..."</p><p>The Liu couple sighed. "We used to think the rumors about the Seven Slaughter Palace were exaggerated. Now we know they weren't far from the truth. Daoist Qing Feng's escaping technique is among the best among Core Formation cultivators, yet he didn't even have a chance to flee.  His body was devoured by the beasts."</p><p>Xiang Yi glanced at the Bone Lotus, warning, "The lotus petals are more than halfway consumed by the poisonous mist. We're running out of time."</p><p>"Let's go..."</p><p>The group looked back once more, then headed deeper into the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>None of them noticed the silent figure trailing behind them.</p><p>Even with the poisonous mist hindering vision and perception, Qin Sang didn't dare get too close.  Tracking them was arduous, but thankfully the group of six was a large enough target.  He never lost their trail.</p><p>The second stone hall was located deeper within, reportedly near the deep chasm at the heart of the Violet Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>Xiang Yi wasn't traveling in a straight line but diagonally.</p><p>The poisonous mist here was even more potent. Qin Sang worried about the Fat Silkworm, constantly checking on it.  Seeing it lying lazily in his sleeve, seemingly unconcerned, he nodded in approval.</p>
