<h1>Chapter 1919: The Thunder Altar</h1><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and flew towards the depths of the secret realm.</p><p>The layout of the secret realm was simple; the entrance was a large forest.</p><p>Within the dense forest, there was an abundance of demonic beast auras, possibly descendants of spirit beasts once kept by the Lei Xiao Sect.</p><p>These demonic beasts weren't particularly strong, but they still posed a significant challenge to the disciples entering the secret realm.</p><p>Past the forest, towering peaks rose into view.</p><p>Heavy clouds and mist shrouded the mountains, lending them an air of mystery.  The faint silhouettes of pavilions and towers could be seen, all deserted and silent.</p><p>The mist was clearly a manifestation of a formation’s power.</p><p>These cloudy mountains were the core of the secret realm and the focus of the struggle between the Five Luminaries Sect and other factions.</p><p>Upon entering the secret realm, the disciples immediately headed for this place.</p><p>Battles unfolded continuously in the forest.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop to watch, arriving at the edge of the cloudy mountains in the blink of an eye. After a brief sensing, he confirmed that the mountains were carefully arranged, forming a spirit array. It bore the hallmarks of thunder techniques, but it wasn't any of the types recorded in the Five Thunder Envoy Institute's records.</p><p>In Qin Sang's opinion, the spirit array wasn't particularly refined, likely a self-devised creation of the Lei Xiao Sect.</p><p>The milky white mist couldn't obscure Qin Sang's vision; he easily pinpointed the core location and vanished into it.</p><p>He was alone in the mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a mountain path, looked around, and walked towards the summit.</p><p>“Hurry up! There must be treasures up there!”</p><p>Zhu Que chirped excitedly.</p><p>“What’s the rush? No one’s competing with you.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently. This Zhu Que had high standards; the mountain likely held nothing that would catch its eye. It was simply bored from being confined for so long and looking for amusement.</p><p>As he walked, he looked around, his gaze occasionally sweeping across the surrounding mountains. He noticed something peculiar about their formations, sensing a hidden mechanism, and couldn't help but feel surprised.</p><p>This trip might yield unexpected rewards.</p><p>In a moment, Qin Sang reached the summit.</p><p>The summit was empty except for a stone pavilion with a stone table and chairs.  On the table were scattered oddly shaped pieces, some kind of unknown game.</p><p>There was nothing else.</p><p>Qin Sang passed through the stone pavilion, stood before a cliff face, and lightly tapped his foot.  A burst of mysterious light erupted from beneath his feet, revealing a rainbow bridge spanning the valley, connecting to a mountain peak in the distance.</p><p>That mountain peak had previously been unremarkable, but now it glowed with rainbow light and seven-colored clouds, revealing a three-story jade pavilion.</p><p>The jade pavilion shimmered with radiant colors, clearly exceptional.</p><p>This jade pavilion was cleverly concealed; even a Nascent Soul cultivator wouldn't easily discover it without knowing the secret.</p><p>Qin Sang crossed the rainbow bridge, arriving before the jade pavilion. He found it perfectly preserved, without a trace of damage.</p><p>A restriction sealed the door, but Qin Sang dispelled it with a wave of his hand and pushed it open.</p><p>Inside was a meditation cushion and an incense burner, empty of incense, appearing to be a place of quiet cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, ascended to the second floor, and saw three rows of jade shelves holding luminous orbs. Most of the orbs contained jade slips, bamboo scrolls, and scriptures.</p><p>He quickly scanned the contents of these orbs.  As expected, they were various cultivation techniques and secret arts, extremely diverse but unrelated to thunder techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that they were cultivation methods collected by the Lei Xiao Sect over the years from various schools and placed here.</p><p>Besides the scriptures, there were also some magic treasures and spiritual materials of some value.  Zhu Que’s eyes lit up, and it swept them all away.</p><p>Continuing to the third floor, Qin Sang finally found what he was looking for – the true legacy of the Lei Xiao Sect!</p><p>Picking up the jade slip containing the fundamental teachings of the Lei Xiao Sect, Qin Sang felt a shock. It was a scroll of the "Six Waves Thunder Scripture."</p><p>Although not included in the Five Thunder Envoy Institute's records, this scripture was mentioned.</p><p>Few factions, perhaps none, have studied thunder techniques more thoroughly than the Daoist Thunder Department.</p><p>Even within the Daoist sect, there are different schools of thought on thunder techniques, with various classifications. The Six Waves Thunder belongs to one of the Thirty-Six Thunders and is considered a type of water thunder, a key inheritance of the Penglai Water Department.</p><p>The Penglai Water Department and the Five Thunder Institute are equally renowned, both subordinate to the Thunder Jade Mansion.</p><p>This scripture alone proves that the Lei Xiao Sect definitely received orthodox inheritance from the Heavenly Court's Thunder Department!</p><p>However, the "Six Waves Thunder Scripture" is an incomplete text.</p><p>The sections from Qi Refinement to Nascent Soul are complete, but it's incomplete beyond the Nascent Soul stage. The latter half of the jade slip contains numerous notes.</p><p>The Lei Xiao Sect's ancestors attempted to further develop the scripture, adding their own thoughts and conjectures for future generations to refer to.</p><p>There were also several other thunder techniques, but none were as profound as the "Six Waves Thunder Scripture."</p><p>Besides the scripture, the most important part of the Lei Xiao Sect's legacy was various thunder talismans, all bearing the hallmarks of the Heavenly Court's Thunder Department.</p><p>Among the third-order thunder talismans, only a few exist, and they are all relatively simple ones.  Qin Sang thus deduced that the legacy obtained by the Lei Xiao Sect was not of a high level.</p><p>However, they may not have obtained everything.  The preface of the *Six Waves Thunder Scripture* records the process by which the ancestor of the Lei Xiao Sect obtained this scripture.</p><p>Qin Sang's consciousness withdrew from the jade slip, looking down at the ground, and 'seeing' beneath the surface.  No wonder he felt the surrounding mountain range was peculiar earlier; the scripture was obtained from within this mountain!</p><p>His consciousness pierced through the rock and layers of formations, perceiving a cave within the mountain.  He sensed an obstruction and hesitated for a moment.</p><p>The cave was sealed by a formation. Although meticulously arranged by the Lei Xiao Sect, it would not be difficult for Qin Sang to break it.</p><p>If the cave contained what Qin Sang suspected, investigating it would take more than a day or two.  But the cave's formation and the entire secret realm's energy were completely integrated. The secret realm was already extremely fragile, and even a slight action could cause it to collapse; it couldn't withstand much disturbance.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang did not directly break into the cave. He returned all the scrolls to their original places, only erasing the records about their origins.</p><p>Leaving the jade pavilion, Qin Sang tapped a few times in the void, asked Zhuque for a piece of newly obtained Red Wind Copper, kneaded it into a golden copper plate, and casually threw it away.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the secret realm:</p><p>Casualties gradually increased.</p><p>The young man Qin Sang encountered earlier had changed his white robe for a suit of armor made from beast hide.  The original owner of this armor was injured by an enemy. Although he escaped, his injuries worsened, and he died on the run. The young man stumbled upon the body and salvaged the armor.</p><p>The armor was damaged, but its protection was far stronger than his robe.</p><p>After killing his first opponent, his courage grew, and he no longer panicked when encountering enemies.</p><p>Now, the young man cautiously moved through the woods, eyes and ears alert, a yellow talisman clutched in his hand, prepared to deal with any sudden enemy.</p><p>Confident that there were no abnormalities, the young man leaped into the treetops like an ape, carefully looking towards the depths of the jungle.</p><p>The outer treasures had all been looted. He needed to go to the heart of the secret realm.</p><p>The young man knew that without reliable information, finding treasures in the secret realm with his cultivation was a fool's errand.  It was a stage for the elite disciples of the major sects.</p><p>The major sects allowed loose cultivators to enter only to quell public opinion.</p><p>Some entered to hone their combat skills, others to kill and plunder, accumulating wealth—but not him.</p><p>Ahead, mist swirled, shadowy mountain shapes like devouring ghosts.</p><p>The young man gritted his teeth and resolutely pressed forward.</p><p>The further he went, the stronger the opponents became, and the more cautious he became.</p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap echoed ahead, shaking the trees, mixed with shouts.</p><p>The young man's heart tightened; he hid in the grass, not daring to move.</p><p>"Someone's fighting!"</p><p>Those who entered the secret realm were all descendants of the Lei Xiao Sect, skilled in thunder techniques.</p><p>The scale was so impressive; both sides were clearly experts, unable to defeat each other for the moment.</p><p>"Will they both end up seriously injured?"</p><p>The young man touched his hide armor, this thought crossing his mind.  He immediately shook his head, dismissing the idea, carefully bypassing the battlefield.</p><p>He proceeded in a winding path; the surrounding mist gradually thickened, finally approaching the heart of the secret realm.</p><p>The young man knew nothing about this place and could only choose a random direction. After traveling for a while, he was blocked by a mountain.</p><p>"The outer mountains must have all been explored."</p><p>The young man thought, bypassed the mountain, and continued inward.</p><p>The mist obscured the sky.</p><p>The formations here also confused perception; one could easily become permanently lost.</p><p>But the young man had no choice. He marked his direction using a pre-prepared secret technique.  Feeling he was near his limit, he decisively stopped, looking at the mountain in front of him.</p><p>Reaching this point safely was good luck; he hoped it would continue.</p><p>With that thought, he followed the mountain path uphill.  Midway up the mountain, he encountered a formation blocking his path.</p><p>Fortunately, due to the precarious state of the secret realm, the formation was damaged. The young man, also understanding thunder techniques, put in some effort and found a way out.</p><p>He encountered more formations afterward, but found no treasures, making him anxious.</p><p>Finally, he discovered a stone hall on a cliff and was attempting to break open the door when a sudden gust of wind arose.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>The young man was startled; his haste had probably caused him to overlook something.</p><p>Regretting was too late.  Even with all his strength, the young man could not resist the wind and was involuntarily blown off the cliff.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The boy fell hard, every inch of him aching.  Luckily, the wind had died down. He scrambled to his feet, realizing he hadn't fallen to the mountain base, but landed on a large outcropping of rock.</p><p>He felt a profound sense of relief, thankful for his escape.  The mountain felt uncanny, and he didn't dare linger. He prepared to use his agility to descend and leave the area.</p><p>Before departing, he caught a glint of gold in his peripheral vision.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>He looked around, then gestured with his hand. A small copper plate flew out from a crevice in the rock. "What's this?"</p><p>He held the plate, his eyes widening in surprise. "It's made of incredibly rare Crimson Wind Copper!"</p><p>Examining it closely, he saw intricate lines etched on its surface, resembling a map, vaguely familiar.</p><p>He scanned it with his spiritual sense, and the map imprinted itself directly into his mind!</p><p>"This…"</p><p>His heart pounded, disbelief etched on his face. "Could this be a map of this mountain range?!"</p><p>One location on the map was especially prominent, marked with a route leading to it, and accompanied by a cryptic chessboard diagram.</p><p>The chessboard seemed incredibly profound, but he couldn't understand its meaning.  He guessed he'd have to reach the location to decipher it.</p><p>His hands trembled as he held the plate. He abruptly raised his head, his expression shifting.</p><p>If the plate was fake, he might be lost forever. But if it were real, it represented an incredible opportunity!</p><p>"Go? Or not go?"</p><p>Who would waste Crimson Wind Copper creating a fake map?</p><p>Finally, he made his decision. He leaped down the mountain, following the path indicated on the map. As the mountain formations matched the map, his anxious heart gradually calmed.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>"You've got some nerve!"</p><p>Zhuque yawned languidly.</p><p>"You lost," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"I didn't bet with you!" Zhuque squawked, hopping onto Xiao Wu's shoulder and playfully nuzzling against her.</p><p>…</p><p>The copper plate guided him seamlessly.</p><p>The boy finally reached the mountain indicated on the plate. Ascending to the summit, he found a stone pavilion containing a chessboard and pieces.</p><p>Entering the pavilion, he examined everything carefully, but couldn't make sense of it. After a moment's thought, he arranged the pieces according to the diagram on the copper plate.</p><p>The instant the pieces were in place, rainbow light blazed, and a rainbow bridge appeared.</p><p>He stared blankly at the Jade Pavilion at the bridge's end, trying to control his excitement. Just as he was about to step onto the bridge, the rainbow light intensified, and violent fluctuations emanated from the pavilion.</p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p>He was completely at a loss.</p><p>The expanding rainbow light affected the entire hidden realm.  To prevent interference, the sect masters of the Wu Hui Gate and other sects locked their spiritual senses onto the realm, detecting any disturbance.</p><p>At that moment, the sect masters seated before the stone walls were jolted awake, their expressions changing drastically.  They stared intently at the realm's entrance, then all turned toward the deep mountains.</p><p>There, countless rainbow lights shone; the sky was changing!</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The sect masters soared into the air, rushing towards the radiant light. From a distance, they saw countless shadowy peaks within the light.</p><p>The familiar mountain range had been replaced by vast, unfamiliar forests. The so-called hidden realm was actually a section of mountains concealed by formations and restrictions.</p><p>The realm collapsed, peaks crumbling as cultivators frantically fled.</p><p>The sect masters charged into the realm, ignoring the collapsing mountains and heading straight for the source of the rainbow light.</p><p>Before the boy could comprehend what was happening, several figures appeared before him, staring at him and the copper plate.</p><p>"Sen… Seniors, I…"</p><p>Recognizing their faces, he was both shocked and terrified, his words a jumbled mess.</p><p>The Wu Hui Gate Master summoned the copper plate, scanning it with his spiritual sense.  His eyes flashed, locking onto the boy's. "Where did you obtain this?"</p><p>The boy, unable to conceal the truth, quickly recounted his experience.</p><p>The Man Lei Sect Master cleared his throat. "Young friend, would you consider joining my Man Lei Sect?"</p><p>The Jin Du Shan Sect Master was also eager to recruit him.</p><p>The Wu Hui Gate Master snorted. "Intrigue at a time like this!  Waiting for the Jade Pavilion to shatter and its treasures to be destroyed?"</p><p>They all looked towards the Jade Pavilion; indeed, it was covered in cracks, on the verge of destruction.</p><p>"If there are genuine Lei Xiao Sect teachings inside, we can study them together.  The artifacts are secondary."</p><p>The Wu Hui Gate Master glanced at the boy. "This child's contribution cannot be ignored.  We shall discuss the sects' offers later."</p><p>The others exchanged glances. "Agreed!"</p><p>…</p><p>While chaos reigned outside,</p><p>Qin Sang had entered the stone cave, using the confusion to destroy the cave's restrictions and set up a spirit formation, completely sealing the cave.  Seeing the cave's interior, her gaze sharpened.</p><p>"It's a Thunder Altar!"</p><p>Daoist altars served various crucial functions, including transmitting teachings, performing rituals, and cultivation.</p><p>Here was a Thunder Department altar, and certainly not a recent construction.</p><p>Could this have once been a Daoist court's administrative area?</p>
