<h1>Chapter 1312: The Seven Waters Mystifying Formation</h1><p>As they spoke, everyone entered the Abyssal Ruins and arrived at the sea of mist where the celestial gate was located.</p><p>Deep within the mist-shrouded sea, several Yuan Ying cultivators from the Abyssal Prison were guarding the area.</p><p>Around the vortex, the mist’s fluctuations were faint.  Between the mists, countless grey threads crisscrossed, appearing and disappearing—this was the Celestial Net Locking Yuan Formation, personally set up by  Autumn芷.</p><p>The Celestial Net Locking Yuan Formation blocked the vortex above, preventing Ye Laomo from returning.</p><p>However, the formation's range and power were limited.  Their purpose in coming here was to gather all the experts from the Northern Star Realm to set up a large-scale formation, completely sealing this space.</p><p>As long as Ye Laomo dared to leave the Crime God Palace, this formation would surely trap him.</p><p>Before that, however, they had to see if they could activate the celestial gate like Ye Laomo did.</p><p>Qin Sang flashed to the edge of the vortex, activating his Celestial Eye ability, gazing into the depths. The extremely dense mist was endless; even with his ability pushed to its limit, he could only see chaos.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang and the others took turns probing.</p><p>After many attempts and using every means at their disposal, the celestial gate remained unresponsive, and they had to give up.</p><p>“Let’s set up the Seven Waters Mystifying Formation! Once the formation is complete, until the Purple Micro Palace emerges, we will take turns guarding this place. We must not let Ye Laomo slip through the cracks…”</p><p>True One Daoist said.</p><p>Everyone agreed without objection.</p><p>The Seven Waters Mystifying Formation was designed to trap Ye Laomo inside, like a turtle in a jar. Before the Purple Micro Palace closed, Ye Laomo wouldn't be able to leave through its celestial formations.</p><p>Furthermore, if things changed, they could use the Seven Waters Mystifying Formation to buy time.</p><p>True One Daoist brought out various formation artifacts, all urgently refined over the past month.</p><p>Then, True One Daoist, Feather King,  Azure Crane Real Person,  Mysterious Void Demon Lord,  Green Lady,  the Lu cultivator, and Autumn芷 each took out a jade bottle.</p><p>The jade bottles were different colors, each containing one of seven rare spirit waters.  The combined efforts of the five major forces had been required to gather these seven spirit waters for the Seven Waters Mystifying Formation.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was strong, his cultivation was still below that of an ordinary early Yuan Ying cultivator, making him unable to control the spirit waters; he was assigned to stand guard.</p><p>Most of the formation's artifacts were made by Green Lady, who would also lead the formation.</p><p>Green Lady flew into the air above the vortex. With a flick of her jade finger, various formation artifacts flew in all directions, seemingly chaotic, before sinking into the mist.</p><p>“Junior Brother, dismantle the Celestial Net Locking Yuan Formation.”</p><p>Qin Sang heard the voice transmission and worked with the Shan cultivator and others to remove the formation before flashing outward.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang summoned eighteen demonic banners, transforming them into ten-foot-high banners.  Blazing demonic fire condensed into a black dragon before him, the fire dragon coiling, ready for battle.</p><p>Qin Sang turned, watching Green Lady and the others.</p><p>After the Yu City battle, Green Lady left alone to handle matters, returning a few days later with an unchanged expression, and showing no signs of injury.</p><p>True One Daoist and the others flew to Green Lady’s side.</p><p>After a series of actions, the seven simultaneously opened their jade bottles, pouring out the spirit waters.</p><p>These spirit waters had different properties.</p><p>Some emitted a piercing chill, surpassing even the coldest ice.</p><p>Others were as hot as magma.</p><p>Some were vibrant with life.</p><p>…</p><p>Green Lady and the others quickly incorporated complex runes into the spirit waters.</p><p>In a short while, there were a series of loud booms as the spirit water exploded into mist, then vanished completely, merging with the surrounding mist.</p><p>From the outside, everything appeared normal.</p><p>Green Lady and the others flew away from the vortex, glanced back, and silently cast a hand seal.</p><p>In an instant, the mist-sea's weather changed dramatically.</p><p>The dense mist surged, and the entire vortex disappeared before their eyes.</p><p>Everyone could feel that the mist here was different from elsewhere; its essence was transformed spirit water, with astonishing power. If they didn’t understand the Seven Waters Mystifying Formation and accidentally stumbled into it, even an unattended formation would likely require considerable effort to overcome.</p><p>“The formation is complete!”</p><p>Green Lady nodded slightly, giving everyone a token to control the formation.</p><p>“Lu recently needs to find a quiet place to help Daoist Han Xi heal his injuries. This place is quite suitable; Lu will guard it for the next two years.  Please keep a close eye on this place, Real Person. If Ye Laomo breaks out, I’m afraid I won’t be able to stop him.”</p><p>Lu Boyuan stepped forward.</p><p>Azure Crane Real Person was more than happy to oblige, nodding repeatedly. “Thank you, Daoist Lu. I will constantly send people to the Abyssal Ruins to assist you.”</p><p>After further discussion, the others established a schedule for taking turns guarding the location.</p><p>Then, everyone dispersed.</p><p>Some remained in the Abyssal Ruins; since the Abyssal Prison had rarely opened to them, they naturally wanted to explore thoroughly.</p><p>Qin Sang was heading towards the Heavenly Corpse Sect headquarters, hoping to find something he'd overlooked.  He'd just left the mist when someone called out.</p><p>“Daoist Qin, please wait!”</p><p>A figure flew towards him.  Recognizing the person, Qin Sang smiled knowingly.  “Ah, Daoist friend. We barely met amidst the battle.  It's a pleasure to finally see you properly.  Have you come to settle the score?”</p><p>The newcomer was the Judge.</p><p>The Judge's face fell.  “Daoist Qin, you jest. I was presumptuous and clumsy, and I was soundly defeated by you on the battlefield. I have no complaints. I came to see your skill, and also to make a humble request.”</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing the Judge's frankness, refrained from further teasing. He produced the Death Jade. “Is this what you seek?”</p><p>The Judge's eyes lit up.  He nodded repeatedly. “You see right through me, Daoist Qin. This Death Jade is crucial to controlling my corpse array.  While I can refine more, it would consume immense effort and time. Now that the two realms are at peace, the Death Jade is useless to you.  I would be grateful if you would return it. Naturally, any request you have in return, I will do my best to fulfill.”</p><p>The Judge’s words were sincere.  The loss of his secondary soul had greatly weakened him.  He'd already used his most precious resources as compensation for his soul's reconstruction, and refining another Death Jade would leave him with little chance of surviving the next heavenly tribulation. He had no choice but to beg.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. The Death Jade was indeed of little use to him.  This man, a product of the Abyss of Sin, was skilled in necromancy – a valuable asset.</p><p>“Returning the Death Jade isn’t difficult, Daoist friend. I’m searching for fire-attribute materials to refine a treasure. If you can find several of these…” He tossed over a jade slip listing the materials.</p><p>The Judge's mouth twisted into a wry smile. These materials were incredibly rare; finding them would likely take as long as refining a Death Jade.</p><p>Qin Sang observed his expression. “If that's too difficult, you can help me with a few things instead.  The terms can be adjusted.”</p><p>The Judge's face brightened. “Please, Daoist Qin, tell me!”</p><p>“I need to find a Golden Core cultivator skilled in necromancy, but their corpse refinement techniques differ from others. They possess the Heavenly Corpse Sect’s legacy.  It's best to start with the Heavenly Corpse Sect.”</p><p>Qin Sang and the Judge flew towards the Heavenly Corpse Sect headquarters.</p><p>“The Heavenly Corpse Sect?”</p><p>Surprise flickered across the Judge's face.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a stirring in his heart. This man certainly knew something.</p>
