<h1></h1><p>Azure Sheep Monastery (Green Ram Temple).</p><p>Qin Sang strolled leisurely, without a care in the world.</p><p>Today was the day of the Outer Sect disciples' grand competition.</p><p>Presiding over the competition was Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>She and her Daoist partner were a perfect match, deeply in love, and were an enviable pair of Immortal companions in the Azure Sheep Monastery (Green Ram Temple).</p><p>The arena was set up on the bank of a great river, located at the highest peak of the Outer Sect. Standing on the mountaintop, one could catch a glimpse of the scenery of the Inner Sect, using this to motivate the Outer Sect disciples.</p><p>Cheers rang out from the peak from time to time.</p><p>This was the final match of the competition, which would determine the ultimate victor.</p><p>The Outer Sect disciples surrounded the arena, cheering for both sides. Some Inner Sect male disciples even came out to watch the excitement.</p><p>On the arena.</p><p>One side was a young man dressed in yellow, whose appearance and temperament could be described as ordinary.</p><p>The other was a beautiful maiden in flowing white robes.</p><p>The maiden's complexion was like snow, and her temperament was aloof.</p><p>She held a spirit sword in her hand, the sword body as crystalline as if forged from Xuan Ice, as cold and alluring as she was.</p><p>The love of beauty is universal.</p><p>Clearly, most of the people were there to see the maiden, and the sound of their cheers drowned out the surging waters of the great river. A few companions, out of a sense of loyalty, tried to cheer for the young man, but the sounds they made were inaudible even to themselves, so they simply switched sides.</p><p>"Senior Sister Lu, add oil! (Go, Senior Sister Lu!)"</p><p>"Knock him out!"</p><p>"I bet this kid can take five moves from Junior Sister Lu."</p><p>"Three moves at most..."</p><p>…</p><p>The barrier surrounding the arena could not block out the sound.</p><p>The young man was drowned in the layers of noise, lonely and helpless, clutching a blackened Firewood Stick (burnt stick) in his hand, at a loss, looking rather pitiful.</p><p>The maiden's expression did not become self-satisfied because of this. Her vermillion lips parted slightly, "Junior Brother Zhang, I didn't expect my last opponent to be you. Please enlighten me!"</p><p>The young man, however, looked absent-minded, his eyes vacant.</p><p>He seemed to be dumbstruck by the grand spectacle around the arena.</p><p>The maiden frowned.</p><p>At this moment, the voice of the Outer Sect Elder announcing the start of the match rang out.</p><p>Intelligent as the maiden was, she could see that there was something wrong with her opponent's eyes, but her willpower was firm, and she would not be affected by this. No matter who her opponent was, she would give it her all!</p><p>The maiden gestured with her right hand, and the spirit sword left her palm and flew into the air.</p><p>Sword energy reverberated, the maiden's clothes fluttering, causing the people outside the arena to be stunned, and cheers resounded throughout the Outer Sect.</p><p>In contrast, the young man, as if awakened from a dream, hurriedly raised the blackened Firewood Stick (burnt stick) in his hand.</p><p>As expected, it provoked a burst of laughter.</p><p>It was hard to imagine who would refine such an unsightly magical artifact, but the young man relied on this magical artifact to pass through the rounds and stand on the final arena.</p><p>*Zheng!*</p><p>The spirit sword ruthlessly slashed down, transforming into a beam of azure sword light.</p><p>Provoked by the sword light, the Firewood Stick (burnt stick) also burst forth with brilliant azure light, instantly soaring into the sky.</p><p>The azure light and the blue light converged, clashing fiercely together.</p><p>For a time, the loud noise was like thunder, and the figures of the two became blurred. The azure and blue intertwined light swept towards the outside of the arena, causing the barrier to vibrate frequently.</p><p>The spectators pressed against the arena's barrier were shocked and leaned back subconsciously.</p><p>Seeing that the barrier was as solid as ever, they breathed a sigh of relief and looked at the two battling in the arena with surprised faces. They did not expect that there would be such power in just the first exchange.</p><p>The maiden was also taken aback. Not only could the Firewood Stick (burnt stick) on the opposite side contend with her spirit sword, but it also had a strange suction force, causing the spiritual power in her body to be unstable, and there were even signs of it boiling.</p><p>Clearly, the young man's cultivation was a level below hers.</p><p>This battle must not be lost!</p><p>The maiden gritted her silver teeth and no longer hesitated, immediately using a secret technique that she had mastered not long ago.</p><p>"Divine Sword Lightning Control Art!"</p><p>Accompanied by a delicate shout, the spirit sword emitted a long cry. With a flash of azure light, it suddenly transformed into a pillar of light, slashing towards the young man in the air with astonishing power!</p><p>"What! Junior Sister Lu has already learned the Divine Sword Lightning Control Art!"</p><p>"Worthy of being a genius!"</p><p>…</p><p>The crowd exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>The pillar of light was like a bolt of lightning, its momentum was earth-shattering, as if it wanted to split the mountain peak.</p><p>Of course, this could not have the power of real Heavenly Lightning, nor was it Sonic Boom of Sword Energy (Sword Qi Lightning Sound), but a sword art treasured by the Azure Sheep Monastery (Green Ram Temple). With the maiden's cultivation, being able to master this sword art could be called a Sword Dao genius.</p><p>Outside the arena, Bai Hanqiu looked at the maiden with an expression of approval on her face. An elder beside her looked at the young man nervously, his eyes faintly carrying a hint of expectation.</p><p>In front of the young man, there was no other barrier besides the Firewood Stick (burnt stick).</p><p>His face was twisted, blood flowing from his seven orifices. He grabbed the Firewood Stick (burnt stick). At the top of the blackened Firewood Stick (burnt stick) was a circular crystal, faintly revealing a trace of blood color, and he fearlessly rushed towards the pillar of light.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The thunderous roar of lightning.</p><p>The arena shook violently.</p><p>The azure light and the blue light were almost indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>Everyone fell silent, looking at the arena with nervous faces.</p><p>*Rumble...*</p><p>Suddenly, the azure light dimmed and flew back. The maiden was pale, her aura weak, her spiritual power nearly exhausted, barely able to stabilize her figure.</p><p>The young man, however, spat out blood and fell out of the arena like a broken rag.</p><p>"Junior Sister Lu won!"</p><p>After a brief silence, the crowd cheered excitedly.</p><p>The maiden, however, didn't say a word, standing there blankly, looking at the young man in a daze.</p><p>"Useless!"</p><p>The elder was heartbroken and could naturally see that the young man had retreated at the last moment.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu's gaze, however, was not bad.</p><p>Just as she was about to say something, she suddenly saw a refined figure outside the crowd nodding slightly to her. Thinking that she was seeing things, she quickly fixed her eyes and looked carefully.</p><p>After whispering a few instructions to the elder, Bai Hanqiu ignored the gazes of the disciples and turned into a ray of light, flying into the Inner Sect. Seeing Qin Sang strolling in the mountains, she obediently followed behind him, "Disciple pays respects to Master. Did Master also watch the disciples' competition just now?"</p><p>"In their youth, they are spirited and vigorous. This master is using this to reminisce about the past."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>In fact, he encountered too many twists and turns at the beginning of his cultivation, so he had no chance to participate in the Sect's grand competition.</p><p>Even after entering Shaohua Mountain, he would avoid such things if he could.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang did not blame her, Bai Hanqiu felt relieved and found something to talk about, "That male disciple doesn't know where he got the opportunity. The magical artifact in his hand may have some background. Senior Brother Tan said that it has the potential to advance to a magical treasure in the future..."</p><p>"It's a Blood Refined Demonic Artifact (evil artifact refined with blood), but there's no need to care. There is no good or evil in magical artifacts, it all depends on the owner's character."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded indifferently. He knew what Bai Hanqiu was afraid of.</p><p>He had been in closed-door cultivation for so many years, and Bai Hanqiu's cultivation had not improved much. It seemed that she had given up on the path.</p><p>This was Bai Hanqiu's own choice, and Qin Sang would not interfere.</p><p>Changing his tone, Qin Sang asked, "Has the Han family moved out of the Great Sui?"</p><p>Bai Hanqiu nodded repeatedly and reported to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Great Sui was the place where the Azure Sheep Monastery (Green Ram Temple) flourished. Jiang Xue was sensible and ordered Han Family Fortress (Han Family Stronghold) to move away, ceding the Great Sui and a large area of surrounding territory to the Azure Sheep Monastery (Green Ram Temple).</p><p>Tan Yien knew the significance of the Great Sui to Qin Sang and sent an elder to take charge, sealing the Pilgrimage Mountain (Chaoshang Mountain) as a holy land.</p><p>Bai Hanqiu became the contemporary Bai family head.</p><p>The Bai family became an Immortal Cultivation family in one leap.</p><p>However, the Qin family was still the imperial family of the Great Sui, enjoying wealth and glory. Unfortunately, no descendants with Immortal Cultivation talent had appeared. Once there were descendants with spiritual roots, they would immediately be introduced into the Azure Sheep Monastery (Green Ram Temple) for cultivation.</p>
