<h1>Chapter 983: The Blue Jade Bead</h1><p>Chapter 983: The Blue Jade Bead</p><p>Qin Sang swiftly killed two with overwhelming force, shocking the crowd and deterring nearby cultivators from interfering.</p><p>Market street.</p><p>The riverbank collapsed, leaving a scene of devastation.</p><p>Two corpses lay on the ground, leaves stained with blood—a horrifying sight.</p><p>Only three remained on the Deputy Commander's side.</p><p>Qin Sang, Bai, the avatar, and the two-headed creature formed a four-sided encirclement. Fei You jolted awake as if from a dream, but hesitated, realizing he would only hinder them, so he stayed on the periphery, observing.</p><p>Two Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivators were in a panic.</p><p>They came with boundless confidence, only to fall into hell in an instant.  At this moment, they desperately wished for help, but the shops along the street were silent; the other trading houses clearly didn't want to get involved.</p><p>The Deputy Commander managed to maintain his composure, his expression grim. The situation was clear: capturing their target was impossible; he was in danger himself.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists of the Merchant Alliance, help me kill this villain, and I, Zuo, will give you all my possessions…"</p><p>The Deputy Commander shouted repeatedly, offering tempting rewards.</p><p>Some were tempted and considered joining forces, but many hesitated.  No matter how high the reward, it was useless if they didn't live to claim it.</p><p>More importantly, the opponent's strength was terrifying; they must have a significant background and powerful connections.  Feuding with a major power like the Qiongyu Trading House would be a net loss.</p><p>The shops remained silent.</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>The Deputy Commander, having given up hope, shouted.</p><p>Two Foundation Establishment cultivators stayed close to the Deputy Commander. The three of them retrieved their magic treasures, scanned their surroundings, and identified the weakest point—the direction of the two-headed creature.</p><p>'Whoosh…whoosh…'</p><p>The dragon-head staff changed direction, swinging horizontally and crashing down toward the two-headed creature.</p><p>Dark light cascaded down like a waterfall, a black dragon roaring.</p><p>The shops along the street emitted strange lights as the dragon-head staff's power impacted them, activating the protective formations. The entire street shook violently as if an earth dragon had turned, causing hearts to tremble with fear.</p><p>In an instant, the street was plunged into darkness.</p><p>At the heart of the storm, the three figures of Qin Sang and the others converged.</p><p>Corpse energy, blood light, and the ebony sword's glow intermingled, their momentum exceeding the dragon-head staff's by a margin.  Strange lights surged like waves, colliding and engulfing the Deputy Commander and his men.</p><p>Two Foundation Establishment mid-stage cultivators, faces contorted with terror, followed the Deputy Commander's break-through attempt, both unleashing their magic treasures to try and resist Qin Sang and the others' attacks.</p><p>However, they were not only weaker but also outnumbered. There was no way they could withstand such a terrifying offensive.</p><p>They knew it.</p><p>A look of regret flashed in their eyes, but without hesitation, they channeled all their true energy into their magic treasures, their faces turning pale. Then they shouted, "Self-destruct!"</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The two magic treasures exploded simultaneously.</p><p>The ice-blue chains shattered into pieces, and the moon-white flying knives disintegrated into dust.</p><p>The self-destruction of the treasures bought them a moment.</p><p>The two suffered backlash, blood dripping from their mouths.  But they dared not hesitate, quickly producing several talismans, slapping them onto their bodies, increasing their speed drastically.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Deputy Commander used the dragon-head staff to force back the two-headed creature, creating an opening.</p><p>This was actually Qin Sang's order; he wanted the two-headed creature to desperately block them.</p><p>A three-sided encirclement leaving one side open, gradually depleting the opponent’s strength.</p><p>He wanted to capture them alive, to find out why the Qiongyu Trading House was targeting him and who his enemies were.  His confidence stemmed from his escape techniques, far surpassing those of cultivators at his level; the Deputy Commander and his men could not escape his grasp.</p><p>The two-headed creature struggled.</p><p>The Deputy Commander created an escape route. Hope flickered in the eyes of the three as they rushed out of the encirclement.</p><p>But before they could leave the street, a figure suddenly appeared in front of them, blocking their path—Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly observed the three, his sleeves fluttering.</p><p>Six small magic banners appeared, and three black arrows shot out—formed from condensed Nine Nether Demon Flames.  In public, Qin Sang didn’t want to expose the Nine Nether Demon Flames, so he disguised them, suppressing the flames' fluctuations.</p><p>The black arrows targeted the three's faces.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai and the avatar had caught up, re-encircling the opponents.</p><p>The Deputy Commander was furious, his heart sinking to the depths of despair.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had only used 70% of his strength. When his powerful escape techniques were fully unleashed, the Deputy Commander and his men felt only despair.</p><p>In despair, the Deputy Commander flung his staff.</p><p>A deafening explosion echoed as the Deputy Commander chose to self-destruct his dragon-head staff.</p><p>The other two also looked vicious, unleashing their new magic treasures with all their remaining strength, targeting Qin Sang.</p><p>This was their only chance.  If they could kill the leader, the others might hesitate, potentially breaking the deadlock.</p><p>The dragon-head cane, the deputy commander's life-bound treasure nurtured for many years, self-destructed at close range. The power was terrifying. The banner formation shook violently, nearly scattering, and the black fire arrows were swallowed.</p><p>Black light erupted, like a black sun, consuming everything, including the three black arrows.</p><p>Qin Sang, though prepared, was momentarily stunned by the cane's power.  Fortunately, his vigilance remained high. He immediately retracted his magic banner and retreated.</p><p>The spatial energy was chaotic, with sword energy and spiritual power clashing, forming a storm.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, retreating while unleashing his ebony sword in a series of strikes, deflecting waves of attacks.</p><p>Then, the deputy commander, with a cruel smile, charged forward, launching a projectile.  A sudden, small blue light emerged from the storm.</p><p>The light was a tiny, rice-grain sized blue bead.</p><p>It shot towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Compared to the dragon-head cane's explosion, the blue light was insignificant.</p><p>Yet, upon seeing the bead, Qin Sang's heart leaped in alarm. He felt a profound sense of danger, as if the object posed an immense threat.</p><p>His pupils constricted. Trusting his instincts, he swung his sword wheel at the bead, simultaneously retreating.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the bead was struck directly, yet the sword wheel seemed to pass through empty space.</p><p>An astonishing sight unfolded.</p><p>Unaffected, the blue bead passed through the sword wheel, seemingly slow yet incredibly fast, closing in on Qin Sang in an instant.</p><p>With a "bang," it exploded into a flash of flame, instantly extinguished. Then, a strange energy wave emanated from the bead, vanishing into the void.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could react, the wave enveloped him, penetrating his body like a clinging poison, then disappearing. His magic robes and armor offered no protection.</p><p>His face changed drastically. He quickly checked his body, his consciousness scanning from head to toe, but he found nothing amiss.</p><p>Bai and his avatar caught up.</p><p>"What happened?" Bai asked, noticing Qin Sang's grim expression and the bead.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, shook his head, glanced at the direction the three had fled, and said, "Get them!"</p><p>The three used all their strength to escape, but to no avail.</p>
