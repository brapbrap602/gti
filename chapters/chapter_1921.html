<h1>Chapter 1912: Fishing with a Fork</h1><p>Such a skilled cultivator, if from Cloud City, is hardly surprising.</p><p>Cloud City’s purging of the demons must have a deeper meaning. The Fire Region needs to prepare in advance and fathom Cloud City’s intentions.</p><p>“Daoist Fu, you’re overthinking it.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t look back, walking further and further away.</p><p>Fu Xiao watched the departing figure, hesitant, ultimately choosing not to pursue.</p><p>…</p><p>Soon after, the cultivators belatedly realized that the once rampant sand bandits had suddenly vanished.</p><p>As survivors were discovered and news spread, the story of the sand bandits' complete eradication gradually spread throughout the desert and even the Fire Region.</p><p>Some curious individuals, emboldened, investigated the three mountain bandit strongholds, finding corpses strewn across the ground and mountain walls stained with blood.</p><p>Under the bright sun, it was as grim as the underworld.</p><p>These people took one look and hurried down the mountain, unable to stay for long, their hearts filled with lingering fear every time they recalled the sight.</p><p>Then more news emerged: some prominent sects had internal traitors who were in cahoots with the sand bandits, and they were also purged, some even having their mountain gates destroyed.</p><p>Most of these sects chose to close their gates, remaining tight-lipped about the incident.</p><p>Surprisingly, the three major sects of the Fire Region did not react at all.</p><p>This turmoil gradually subsided, with no one ever knowing who was responsible.</p><p>Long after, many cultivators still appreciated the mysterious person’s righteous actions.</p><p>The horrific fate of the sand bandits struck fear into the hearts of those with evil intentions, and for a long time, no one dared to cause trouble in the desert.  The cultivation world experienced a period of improved order.</p><p>Only after a hundred years did a few scattered groups of sand bandits reappear, only to be quickly wiped out by a joint effort of the major sects.</p><p>…</p><p>Crossing the desert and entering the Gobi, they finally saw a patch of green.</p><p>Beyond the Gobi lay undulating peaks and endless barren mountains; not only were mortals unable to live there, but even cultivators were rarely seen.</p><p>A white cloud drifted by.</p><p>Standing on the cloud, Qin Sang looked at the scenery below and said, “Look at the direction of these rivers. A few hundred miles further south, there are settlements. We’ll find a boat and go south by water.”</p><p>Luo Hou had no objections; since dismounting, it had faithfully fulfilled its duty as a mount.</p><p>Zhu Que suddenly became excited, flapping its wings up and down, repeatedly asking, “Are there really so many delicious things in the mortal world?”</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang explained worldly affairs to Xiao Wu, recalling Xiao Wu's interest in the food at the Gathering Immortals Tower, and spoke of it more.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhu Que overheard.</p><p>“In terms of refined seasonings and precious ingredients, mortals can't compare to cultivators. But food is essential to the people, and different places have different local customs, which will always allow you to discover new and interesting things…”</p><p>As they spoke, the white cloud passed over the mountains, and Qin Sang noticed that the mountains ahead were becoming gentler, the river wider, and man-made structures beginning to appear on the riverbanks. He said, “There are people ahead. Let’s go down.”</p><p>Qin Sang cast an illusion, the white cloud lunged forward, and then descended directly onto a mountain path by the riverbank.</p><p>The river flowed relatively gently, with a simple wooden dock on each bank. The wooden piles submerged in the water showed clear signs of decay, suggesting they were quite old.</p><p>From each dock extended a road leading inland, narrowing as it went, eventually branching into several smaller paths that disappeared into the mountains and forests.</p><p>Each dock had a covered boat tied to it; both were passenger boats, seemingly with a clear division of labor.</p><p>The owner of the eastern boat was a thin old man, busily carrying materials onto the boat, fetching water, and cleaning. The owner of the western boat was strong and sturdy, leaning against the bow, legs crossed, squinting in the sun.</p><p>It wasn't time to set sail yet, and there were passengers waiting on both docks.</p><p>The old man kept smiling at the passengers, repeatedly saying, “Almost ready! Almost ready!”</p><p>The passengers didn't mind, some even offering to help.</p><p>The strong man didn't bother to talk to the passengers, so no one interacted with him. The passengers looked towards the east bank with some envy.</p><p>Getting slightly closer to the boat, they could smell a sour odor, but they didn't dare complain in front of the strong man, only secretly pinching their noses, worrying about the journey ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally chose the eastern boat, landing on a mountain path on the east bank and walking with his horse.</p><p>“Hey, a Daoist is coming.”</p><p>“Where did a Daoist come from here?”</p><p>“My, what a pretty girl. Is she asleep on the horse?”</p><p>…</p><p>The passengers on the bank gossiped as Qin Sang approached.</p><p>As Qin Sang drew closer, the passengers fell silent, revealing friendly smiles, some even giving an imperfect Daoist bow.</p><p>There are gods watching above, and whether Daoists have abilities or not, treating them with respect is always the right thing to do.</p><p>A Taoist priest, his sleeves billowing, possessed an otherworldly air, suggesting a man of genuine spiritual attainment.</p><p>“Boatman, my horse is weary.  Could you grant us passage?” Qin Sang asked gently.</p><p>The covered boat was spacious enough to comfortably accommodate a horse.</p><p>“This…” The old man, setting down his firewood, rubbed his hands, appearing hesitant.  “I can waive the fare for the Daoist master, but the horse…”</p><p>While there weren't many passengers now, the river led to several docks along the way, all the way to Beiku County.  Only two boats plied this route.  Townsfolk relied on them to reach the city, and the boats often became crowded halfway through the journey.</p><p>“No need to waive the fare.  Let the horse rest; we’ll disembark when more people board,” Qin Sang offered, producing several copper coins.  .</p><p>“No, no, the fare is truly unnecessary!”  The old man insisted, refusing the money.</p><p>Soon, the sun climbed high. The old man neatly stacked the firewood, calling for passengers to embark.  The number of people on both banks was roughly equal.  Once Qing Ma  boarded, the boat noticeably dipped on one side.</p><p>The boatman on the west side untied the horse's reins, grasped his oar, and with a powerful stroke, the covered boat sliced through the water with a speed rivalling a fast boat, leaving a white wake far behind.</p><p>The old man was in no hurry, paddling leisurely, chatting amiably with the passengers.</p><p>People’s gazes frequently drifted towards the stern where Qin Sang and Xiao Wu sat on the ground, Zhuque  dozing on Qin Sang's shoulder, and Qing Ma standing nearby. The unusual sight piqued everyone’s curiosity, but no one dared approach, fearing they might inadvertently offend the Taoist.  They assumed Qin Sang possessed spiritual abilities; otherwise, why would he travel with a young girl?</p><p>The river didn't flow directly south. After a while, it veered west, narrowing and becoming swift, easing the old man's work.</p><p>A second dock soon came into view.  Only three people were there: a boy of about ten, a large bundle at his feet, who waved excitedly at the approaching boat.</p><p>“Grandpa… Grandpa…”</p><p>The child’s childish voice reached the old man, whose face lit up. He paddled faster, quickly approaching the bank. “Son, did you get it?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The boy nodded vigorously. “Uncle Zhao said the harvest was good this year, and he made lots of cured meat. It smells so good!”</p><p>He hoisted the bundle, grunted, and before the boat had fully docked, leaped aboard in three strides, startling the old man into dropping his oar and catching the boy.</p><p>“Now, now!”  The old man raised his hand, feigning a strike.</p><p>“Hee hee…”</p><p>The boy, nimble as an eel, darted into the cabin, where his excited shouts soon filled the air.</p><p>“Wow! Grandpa caught so many fish today…”</p><p>“Wow! And a yellow-toothed fish!”</p><p>“I haven’t had yellow-toothed fish in ages! Last year’s one was so delicious and plump!”</p><p>…</p><p>The boy's excited chatter didn’t slow his efficient work; he moved the cooking pot and seasoning to the bow, took fish from the creel, and fetched firewood from the stern.</p><p>“Wow!”</p><p>Suddenly spotting Qing Ma, he exclaimed, “Such a magnificent horse!”</p><p>Which man wouldn't desire such a steed, especially one so magnificent?</p><p>The boy stared, awestruck, before noticing Qin Sang and Xiao Wu.  At the sight of Xiao Wu, he froze, staring for a moment, then his face flushed crimson.  He grabbed an armful of firewood, scurried to his grandfather, and stammered, “Grandpa, she… is she blind?”</p><p>The old man jumped, glancing cautiously at the stern, relieved by the lack of reaction. “She might just have eye trouble. Go cook now, I’m hungry.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>The boy returned to the stove, skillfully preparing a meal; a man in green from the cabin helped him.  They took cured meat from the bundle, washed, sliced, and rendered the fat, stewing it with river fish, the aroma soon filling the air.</p><p>While working, the boy kept stealing glances towards the stern, his secret admiration evident.</p><p>The cabin passengers smiled kindly, making the boy blush again and turn away.</p><p>‘Gurgle gurgle…’</p><p>The fish and cured meat soup simmered.  The fresh fish, rich meat, and intense aroma wafted into the cabin and towards the stern.</p><p>Zhuque instantly perked up, eyes fixed on the bow, seemingly yearning to leap into the pot.</p><p>Xiao Wu twitched his little nose and also turned to look, but his face showed no urgency. He simply watched quietly.</p><p>"This is the everyday life of mortals..."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the swiftly passing mountain scenery along the banks, feeling a pang of emotion. She had forgotten what the everyday life of mortals tasted like.</p><p>The passengers’ appetites were piqued, and they took out their prepared rations from their bags, nibbling them with sips of water.</p><p>The fish soup was ready.</p><p>It was in a large iron pot, a whole pot full, more than the grandfather and grandson could possibly drink.</p><p>The boy took a large bamboo tube from the edge of the awning, filled it with fish soup, carefully carried it into the cabin, and gave it to a timid little girl, crisply saying, "Sister, this is for you."</p><p>"No, no, no..."</p><p>The girl was flustered, waving her hands repeatedly, trying to stand up but afraid of spilling the boy's soup.</p><p>"Drink it! Old Man Chen is a good person. When he has a good catch, he always makes fish soup to share, free of charge! There's plenty, you can have more if you want."</p><p>A man in a green robe also came in with fish soup, smiling and distributing it to everyone. Only then did the little girl dare to accept it.</p><p>The bamboo tube contained not only fish soup but also small fish about the size of a thumb.  Eating it with the dry rations was much more flavorful than before.</p><p>Taking advantage of delivering the soup, the boy secretly looked toward the stern. He suddenly noticed Xiao Wu looking back, and his face turned red again. His hand trembled, nearly spilling the soup, causing a few gasps.</p><p>Then the boy realized that Xiao Wu probably couldn't see; she was drawn by the aroma of the fish soup.</p><p>"So pitiful."</p><p>The boy thought to himself.  Noticing that Qin Sang and Xiao Wu hadn't taken out any food, he quickly ran to the bow, tugged on his grandfather's clothes, and whispered a few words.</p><p>Seeing his grandfather nod, the boy jumped up happily, immediately filled two bamboo tubes with fish soup, placed them beside Qin Sang at the stern, and without saying a word, ran back to the bow, grabbed a bowl, picked up a yellow-toothed fish, licked his lips, and crammed it into the bowl along with plenty of cured meat and fish. He grabbed two pieces of bread and rushed back, breathless.</p><p>"My grandpa sent this to you, eat."</p><p>The boy didn't dare look at Xiao Wu. He said a word to Qin Sang and ran away.</p><p>Zhu Que’s eyes lit up, she fixed her gaze on a piece of cured meat and was about to eat it when Qin Sang knocked her on the head. Zhu Que chirped incessantly.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the bowl and, with Xiao Wu, went to the bow.</p><p>The boy was gobbling down his food. He quickly lowered his head and nibbled on the bread.</p><p>"Thank you, boatman."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in thanks. Seeing the old man repeatedly waving his hands, she smiled, "The boatman's kindness is gratefully accepted. However, with meat, there should be wine. I have brought some cloudy wine; please don't mind the simplicity."</p><p>As she spoke, Qin Sang reached into her bosom, producing a wine gourd as if by magic. She took two thin bamboo tubes, filled them with wine, and handed them to the old man.</p><p>"How can I accept this...?"</p><p>The aroma of the wine was truly tempting. The old man carefully took the bamboo tube, took a sip, and immediately felt a warmth spreading through his limbs. His body felt three points lighter, and the cold that had accumulated from years of boating seemed to dissipate.</p><p>"Excellent wine! This wine...isn't cheap, is it?"</p><p>The old man asked softly.</p><p>"I travel around the country. I need wine to keep warm on the road. I brewed some myself using herbs, it doesn't cost anything." Qin Sang gave Xiao Wu a piece of cured meat. Xiao Wu gently chewed, savoring this flavor, more rustic but different from the refined tastes of the Juxian Tower.</p><p>"Ah! It's herbal wine," the old man looked at his grandson, a little reluctant to drink it.</p><p>His grandson would eventually take over this work. With this wine to ward off the cold, he wouldn't suffer the same ailments as his grandfather.</p><p>"This wine isn't strong, even a child can drink it. It's good for health, just a little sip at a time." Qin Sang stood up, took an empty waterskin, and filled it with wine. "No one has appreciated my craft before. Since you like it, boatman, I'll give you some more."</p><p>"Enough! Enough! Thank you, Daoist! Thank you, Daoist!" The old man was overwhelmed.</p><p>The boy wasn't interested in the wine. He ate heartily. Xiao Wu sat opposite him.  Over time, she grew bolder. "Are you finished? Grandpa bought me lots of toys in town. Do you want to play?"</p><p>"Play?"</p><p>Xiao Wu tilted her head, looking puzzled.</p><p>"Go on. Do as he does," Qin Sang patted Xiao Wu's head.</p><p>Xiao Wu obediently stood up. The boy brought out a treasure chest from the cabin, filled with all sorts of toys.</p><p>Qin Sang talked with the old man about rural life while keeping an eye on Xiao Wu.</p><p>"This one! Like this... fun, right?"</p><p>The boy was excited, taking out the toys one by one, teaching Xiao Wu how to play.</p><p>Xiao Wu's expression remained flat.  After going through all the toys, none could elicit a smile.</p><p>The boy scratched his head, glanced at the side of the boat, saw a bamboo fishing spear tied to a rope, and his eyes lit up. He pulled Xiao Wu's sleeve and ran to the edge of the boat.</p><p>"My grandpa made this for me! I speared several fish with it!"</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The spear went into the water, missing its target as expected.</p><p>The boy pulled back the spear and gave it to Xiao Wu, holding the direction himself, his eyes keenly fixed on the river surface. "I'll tell you to let go, and you let go...let go!"</p><p>*Plop!*</p><p>Bloody water surfaced on the river.</p><p>The boy's mouth dropped open, his eyes wide.</p><p>Xiao Wu's small face was bathed in sunlight, a faint smile playing on her lips, pure and innocent.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly frowned.</p>
