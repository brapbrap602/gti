<h1>Chapter 1984: Moonfall Bay</h1><p>Proof of the Dao transcends grudges and grievances.</p><p>With the Great Completion path flourishing, demons, ghosts, and monsters are restrained, harboring caution and fear, not daring to wantonly slaughter civilians and the weak.</p><p>Order is not necessarily a bad thing, but there are certainly those who dislike it, unwilling to be bound.</p><p>Just as heroes emerge in chaotic times, great opportunities are often born amidst chaos; these are the so-called destined ones.</p><p>Cloud Metropolis, while claiming to be the leader of the righteous path, acts in ways far from righteous in the eyes of mortals.</p><p>If both Old Man Gu Yun and Qin Sang were slain together, the annihilation of Cloud Metropolis wouldn't be undeserved.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't confident in killing both of them simultaneously.</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators are cautious and value their lives. Even when vying for the bronze pillar, it's rare for them to end up mutually destroyed.</p><p>Should Qin Sang intervene during their duel, they would inevitably join forces to retaliate, and the Four Symbols Sword Formation wouldn't be able to trap them.</p><p>If that happened, the activation of the Thunder Altar would be detected by the two, and they would flee immediately, leaving Qin Sang with no recourse.</p><p>Even if they couldn't escape the Thunder Altar's range, and joined forces to defend against the Thunder Oath Decree, its power would be greatly diminished.</p><p>Moreover, the Thunder Altar couldn't be activated continuously. Even if it could, Qin Sang wouldn't be able to manage it; the consumption from a single activation already strained him considerably.</p><p>If he couldn't slay them in one fell swoop, the ensuing situation would become an unending blood feud.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't fear powerful enemies, but a single misstep would cause him to lose a golden opportunity.</p><p>The confrontation between the two factions had plunged the mortal world into chaos and deep resentment. His sudden emergence, turning the tide and saving the common people from fire and water, was the perfect opportunity to prove his Dao.</p><p>There wouldn't be another chance to lure them here. Relying solely on his own strength, Qin Sang still wasn't capable of slaying Void Refinement cultivators, which would hinder his cultivation.</p><p>He leveraged the suspicion between Old Man Gu Yun and Patriarch Ming Hu, dividing them – intercepting one, trapping the other, creating a blend of truth and illusion.</p><p>Now, by annihilating the Valley of Fallen Souls and intimidating Cloud Metropolis, Qin Sang had achieved his objective.</p><p>Keeping Old Man Gu Yun alive also served a purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Old Man Gu Yun. He had deliberately cultivated an aura of having a powerful backing, a significant background.</p><p>It was evident that Old Man Gu Yun had been intimidated.</p><p>After all, he wasn't a carefree rogue cultivator. Belonging to a sect meant having concerns.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang intended to eradicate Cloud Metropolis, Old Man Gu Yun certainly wouldn't risk mutual destruction.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun would serve as Qin Sang’s introduction to the Greater Thousand World.</p><p>Catching Qin Sang's gaze, Old Man Gu Yun's heart skipped a beat. Maintaining a calm demeanor, he continued explaining the method to break the formation.</p><p>With Patriarch Ming Hu’s demise and no Void Refinement cultivator guarding the Valley of Fallen Souls, the power of their protective formation was significantly weakened, posing no threat.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang, seeing no omissions, nodded and vanished into the ravine.</p><p>The ravine was deep and long, teeming with countless life forms. As he descended, Qin Sang saw lush forests covering the cliff walls on both sides, stretching all the way to the bottom.</p><p>Specks of fluorescent light scattered among the forests, painting the ravine's interior a vibrant green.</p><p>The fluorescence emanated from the leaves of a unique plant. Resembling vines, this plant was ubiquitous and served as the underground light source.</p><p>They could move like living creatures, their tendrils acting as tentacles, climbing between the branches.</p><p>The further down he went, the dimmer the fluorescence became, until he entered a world of darkness.</p><p>The Valley of Fallen Souls' mountain gate was located midway down.</p><p>Qin Sang and Old Man Gu Yun, one north and one south, arrived at opposite ends of the mountain gate, their presence completely unnoticed by the remaining members of the Valley of Fallen Souls.</p><p>The power of the grand formation manifested, a strange black mist shrouding the valley. The mist swirled, and a ghostly wind howled, enhancing the eerie atmosphere.</p><p>Beneath the black mist were frightened faces and dozens of suspended black coffins.</p><p>These coffins emitted a gloomy aura, their energies interconnected. The strange black mist drifted from the cracks in the coffins, forming the protective formation.</p><p>“Truly worthy of corpse demons, even their protective formation is made of coffins.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, then his eyes lit up as streaks of escaping light descended from the sky, illuminating the underground world.</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis cultivators, following Old Man Gu Yun's orders, had arrived to break the formation.</p><p>They had been eagerly awaiting this moment, rushing down one after another. Led by the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals, they attacked the formation from nine different directions.</p><p>Their Dao techniques and magical treasures formed nine torrents, a kaleidoscope of colors, but the remnants of the Valley of Fallen Souls didn't find the scene beautiful in the slightest.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Like nine celestial waterfalls, they continuously bombarded the formation.</p><p>The black mist churned, and the black coffins swayed ceaselessly, the chains suspending them rattling loudly.</p><p>The hearts of the Valley of Fallen Souls' remnants trembled along with the chains.</p><p>“Old Ghost Yun Xi, you dare! When Master returns, he will refine you into a corpse puppet, sealing your soul, condemning you to eternal suffering!”</p><p>A shrill roar came from below.</p><p>Yun Xi chuckled coldly.</p><p>“That old zombie slaughtered countless beings. Retribution is swift. He has long since perished. I’m afraid you’ll have to summon him from the underworld!”</p><p>“You corpse demons, absorbing Yin energy, sacrificing humans, you deserve to be cast into hell and endure endless torture! The mortal world cannot tolerate your existence!  We’ll send you back to the underworld to reunite with your old zombie!”</p><p>Yun Xi’s stern voice echoed into the Valley of Fallen Souls, causing an uproar.</p><p>The person who had shouted earlier tried desperately to appease the others, but to no avail.  Their protective formation hadn’t even been broken, yet they were already in disarray.</p><p>Patriarch Ming Hu hadn’t appeared to repel the enemy. No matter how unwilling they were to believe it, they couldn't change the reality.</p><p>Under the fierce assault of the Cloud Metropolis Nine Immortals, the protective formation was forced to undergo numerous transformations, all observed by Qin Sang and Old Man Gu Yun, who quickly gained a thorough understanding of it.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>At both ends of the formation, purple light and sword radiance erupted simultaneously.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun raised his purple bamboo staff, aimed it at the void before him, and thrust it down with force, the tip like a heavy hammer.</p><p>Purple light trails rapidly spread through the strange black mist, tearing it apart.</p><p>Qin Sang remained stationary. From his sleeve, a streak of sword radiance shot out.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword left his sleeve, instantly transforming into a beam of sword light. Aimed at the Valley of Fallen Souls, it slashed down without any flourish!</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The cliff walls on both sides trembled violently.</p><p>The black mist churned intensely, finally unable to withstand the combined assault of Qin Sang and Old Man Gu Yun.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>As the remnants of the Valley of Fallen Souls watched in horror, nearly a dozen black coffins shattered simultaneously. Fragments rained down, leaving only swaying iron chains.</p><p>The coffins shattered with alarming speed.  With only a third remaining, the formation was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The Cloud Metropolis cultivators, shouting slogans of slaying demons and eliminating evil, charged into the Valley of Fallen Souls like ravenous wolves.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang and Old Man Gu Yun had already entered the depths of the valley, standing by the black river.</p><p>‘Thud!’</p><p>Qin Sang threw a person onto the ground.</p><p>The person’s expression was surprisingly calm, but the turmoil in his eyes betrayed his inner unrest.</p><p>He rolled over and knelt, “Junior Jing Cang, pays respects to the two seniors.”</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun recognized Jing Cang and said with a smile, “This fellow is the old zombie’s prized disciple, quite resourceful, and highly regarded by the old zombie.  The recent chaos in the mortal world was his doing. Fortunately, this old man blockaded the Valley of Fallen Souls early on, otherwise this fellow would have escaped.”</p><p>“I beg the two seniors to understand, Junior was trapped in this den of evil, with no control over my actions. It was all under the control of that old demon.  I had no choice,”</p><p>Jing Cang's heart pounded with anxiety, unable to discern whether Old Man Gu Yun’s attitude was favorable or not.</p><p>These Void Refinement patriarchs were high and mighty.  The sect still needed someone to manage affairs. Perhaps he could leverage his resourcefulness to preserve his life. “Senior, spare my life, and I will dedicate myself to repaying your great kindness."</p><p>He added, “Junior followed the old demon for many years and knows some of the secrets of the Valley of Fallen Souls."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around. On both sides of the black river were several stone dwellings, presumably the Valley of Fallen Souls' treasure vaults.</p><p>Patriarch Ming Hu had been operating here for many years; his accumulated wealth certainly wasn't limited to this. The secret realms, medicinal fields, and other locations controlled by the Valley of Fallen Souls outside the mountain gate, each one represented immense riches.</p><p>More than enough to bolster Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Jing Cang and said indifferently, “Open your mind.”</p><p>Jing Cang’s face paled, his lips trembling. Ultimately, he didn’t dare to resist, allowing Qin Sang to implant a restrictive spell into his body, merging it with his soul.</p><p>From now on, he could only be at the mercy of others.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun retrieved a mustard seed bag and handed it to Qin Sang. It contained the spoils of war from this period. Qin Sang accepted it without hesitation.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Ripples appeared on the black river’s surface, revealing stone steps.</p><p>The two descended along the steps, finding themselves in a spacious stone chamber at the riverbed.  Its layout resembled a tomb, with strange murals carved on the walls.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun, also entering the Valley of Fallen Souls for the first time, observed carefully and said, “The first ancestor of the Valley of Fallen Souls was an ancient corpse buried here.  Incorruptible for millennia, it gained sentience and achieved enlightenment.  Upon its emergence, demonic flames raged.  Our sect's ancestor intended to slay the demon, but after several battles, failed to destroy the ancient corpse, and watched as it established a sect here, becoming a formidable foe.”</p><p>His voice grew softer, his gaze captivated by the murals.</p><p>The murals weren't very clear. It seemed the pigments had faded with the passage of time, and there were a few places where the paint seemed to have peeled off.</p><p>The patterns were simple yet profound.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun immediately realized that these murals were extraordinary!</p><p>With Patriarch Ming Hu's death and his belongings falling into Qin Sang’s hands, he had assumed there wouldn’t be anything valuable left in the cave dwelling. Unexpectedly, there was this peculiar mural.</p><p>Just as Old Man Gu Yun was becoming engrossed, he abruptly snapped back to his senses. Glancing at Qin Sang, he saw that Qin Sang’s gaze was also drawn to the mural, with no intention of driving him away.</p><p>Uncertain of Qin Sang's intentions, yet unable to resist the allure of the mural, Old Man Gu Yun decided to stop overthinking and focused on studying it.</p><p>“So that’s how it is…”</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun murmured.</p><p>The core cultivation method of the Valley of Fallen Souls must have a deep connection to this mural.  It was even possible that the Valley of Fallen Souls' ancestor had comprehended the mural and then, drawing upon other methods, created their own technique.</p><p>After observing for a while, he sighed inwardly with regret. The mural’s content primarily pertained to body refinement, greatly benefiting body cultivators, but it didn't align with Cloud Metropolis Mountain’s inheritance.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun glanced at Qin Sang again, unable to decipher anything from his expression.</p><p>This person cultivated both body and Dharma. To him, the value of this mural probably exceeded most of Patriarch Ming Hu’s treasures.</p><p>He wondered if this person had obtained the complete inheritance of the Valley of Fallen Souls.</p><p>Cloud Metropolis, in its crusade against the corpse demons, had only acquired the cultivation methods up to the Nascent Soul stage. The most crucial part of the inheritance remained in Patriarch Ming Hu's possession.</p><p>It must contain the Valley of Fallen Souls' ancestor's insights from studying the mural.  Those insights alone were worth taking Patriarch Ming Hu’s life for.</p><p>Qin Sang, unaware of Old Man Gu Yun’s train of thought, was also pondering this matter.</p><p>He had indeed obtained the Valley of Fallen Souls' inheritance, but only glanced over it briefly, lacking the time for a detailed study.</p><p>From his observation, if one patiently studied the mural, they were most likely to comprehend some bone tempering techniques.</p><p>The cultivation of the *Celestial Demon Body Refining* had increasingly leaned towards the Dharma Aspect, rather than purely tempering the physical body.</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely sensed that if he continued cultivating this technique, it would eventually absorb all his vital essence, completely merging it into the Dharma Aspect.</p><p>If he cultivated another body refining technique, emphasizing both the physical body and the Dharma Aspect, it might bring about significant improvement.</p><p>However, cultivating too many techniques wasn't necessarily beneficial.</p><p>The Four Symbols Sword Formation, thunder arts, *Purple Star Sword Canon*, *Celestial Demon Body Refining*…</p><p>How much more energy and time could he spare?</p><p>Void Refinement cultivators had no worries about lifespan, but they faced the tribulation of heavenly lightning.</p><p>He simply didn't have the time!</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, hesitant, and put the thought aside for now.  He withdrew his gaze and, noticing a stone table and stools inside the cave dwelling, walked over and sat down.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please be seated."</p><p>Qin Sang gestured, acting like the host.</p><p>In fact, he truly was the master here now.  Old Man Gu Yun was determined not to contend with him for the Valley of Fallen Souls.</p><p>"Does Fellow Daoist wish to play a game of chess with this old man here?"</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun glanced around and sat down with a chuckle.</p><p>At least the attitude Qin Sang displayed showed no overt hostility towards him or Cloud Metropolis.</p><p>"This humble Daoist is actually not skilled in the art of chess."</p><p>Qin Sang said casually, his fingers brushing over his Thousand Jun Ring. A dozen jade slips flew out, landing haphazardly on the table.</p><p>“How many ancient formation ruins has your esteemed sect excavated in the Fire Domain?”</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun looked at the jade slips, knowing they contained rubbings of the ancient restriction fragments left behind by the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation within those ruins.</p><p>These were precisely what the Clear Sky Sect needed.</p><p>However, fragments alone weren't enough. They needed to piece the fragments together, connecting all the ruins, successfully activate and trigger a transformation in the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation for it to be of value.</p><p>“Thirteen ruins have been located so far, and the rubbings aren’t yet complete.  However, all these combined are not worth a single Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar.”</p><p>“Are you referring to this?”</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the bronze pillar.</p><p>A mere bait, unexpectedly holding such immense value.</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun nodded, “The Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar is the most crucial formation tool of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation.  The Clear Sky Sect wishes to restore the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation, so the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillars are indispensable; the more the better!”</p><p>“The Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation… A single ruin covers the entire Fire Domain.  Just how vast is this ancient formation? The splendor of the ancient cultivation world is truly captivating…”</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to be merely expressing his admiration.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun, harboring no suspicions, echoed, "Indeed, why else would the Clear Sky Sect place such importance on it? The ruins of the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation have lay dormant for countless years, appearing at unknown times and for unknown reasons. To restore the Coiling Dragon Ancient Formation, the Clear Sky Sect has mobilized its forces, dispatching disciples to search throughout Moonfall Bay, searching tirelessly for millennia. They’ve been here many times, never expecting the Fire Domain to truly conceal a ruin.”</p><p>“Even with the entire cultivation world of Moonfall Bay mobilized by the Clear Sky Sect, the newly discovered ruins are becoming increasingly scarce, yet they still haven’t met the Clear Sky Sect’s requirements.  It is said that the rewards for this Clear Sky Dharma Assembly are exceptionally generous. This old man offers his congratulations to Fellow Daoist and Green Ram Temple in advance.”</p><p>Qin Sang remained impassive, simply humming softly, examining the Coiling Dragon Heavenly Pillar as if unconcerned.</p><p>He hadn't inquired about these matters in detail, only hearing rumors about the Clear Sky Dharma Assembly.</p><p>It was said that there were requirements for participation. Only forces within Moonfall Bay recognized by the Clear Sky Sect would receive a formal invitation.</p><p>Old Man Gu Yun, attempting to probe, said enviously, “It is rumored that among the various treasures offered by the Clear Sky Sect, there is a small cave heaven!”</p>
