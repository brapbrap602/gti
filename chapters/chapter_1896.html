Chapter 1887: Daoist Ritual

This type of magic is called 'Divine Transformation'.

When performing this art, the practitioner, through their Dharma vessel, connects with the Divine Court, visualizing the divine images and honored titles of the celestial deities from the Immortal Guides.  They contemplate becoming the deity itself, coordinating with the corresponding scriptures, Dharma incantations, and hand seals, thereby obtaining a response from the Talisman Spirit and an infusion of divine power.

The power of the Talisman Spirit can empower troops or enhance one's own body.

This magic also has limitations. To gain the response of a Talisman Spirit, the practitioner's cultivation level, temperament, and mastery of the art must meet high standards.

A higher-ranking Talisman Spirit isn't necessarily better. The higher the rank and the greater the number, the higher the requirements for the practitioner.

Most Daoist cultivators can only summon Talisman Spirits from the Divine Offices corresponding to their Dharma vessels, whose ranks are equivalent to their own Dharma rank, or not exceeding it by too much.  

Among these, summoning one's own altar-protecting Divine General is the easiest.

Summoning higher-ranking Talisman Spirits yields greater power, but the ritual steps become more complex. Opening an altar is mandatory, as is meticulously issuing talismans, combined with the corresponding incantations and罡 steps (gang steps - esoteric walking patterns used in Daoist rituals).

When summoning deities beyond one's rank, issuing dozens or even hundreds of talismans is not uncommon.

Moreover, multiple Daoist cultivators can open an altar and perform the ritual together to summon high-ranking Talisman Spirits, but this requires extremely strict and complex Daoist rituals, known as "Zhai Jiao" (斋醮 - Daoist religious services).

The most crucial point is that the Talisman Spirit must exist to respond.

Not every Daoist cultivator following Ruoquan Zhenren succeeded, but the results were enough to inspire hope!

Outside the Immortal City, demonic Qi billowed.

The city's grand formation was activated, and the Void Locking barrier enveloped hundreds of miles beyond the city. As the demonic clouds entered the range of the spiritual formation's power, they were noticeably forced downwards.

'Bang! Bang! Bang!'

Within the tide of beasts, countless flying creatures and airborne ferocious beasts plummeted to the ground.

The beast tide surged.

These unfortunate beasts were struck and trampled by their companions from behind, countless of them instantly turned into meat paste.

The scent of blood further stimulated the beast tide.

Innumerable beasts were killed or injured before the battle even began, but within the boundless tide, these losses seemed insignificant.

Empowered by 'Divine Transformation,' the Daoist cultivators felt the surge of power within them, their faces alight with excitement. Seeing the beast tide approaching, they could no longer restrain themselves and unleashed divine talismans towards the city's exterior.

Most of those who attacked cultivated pestilence-related Dharma.

Streams of light exploded outside the city, releasing vibrant, multicolored poisonous smoke.  The smoke plumes connected, forming a miasma.

A multicolored miasma materialized outside the city.  Beasts that strayed into the poisonous瘴 (zhang - noxious vapors, miasma) perished instantly.

Some collapsed silently to the ground, while others rotted completely, their flesh and blood turning into poison that continued to corrode other beasts.

With this attack, the Daoist cultivators immediately noticed the difference.  The same divine talismans were now cast faster and with greater power than before.

Moreover, some divine talismans previously considered difficult, or even exceeding their cultivation limits, could now be wielded.

They also felt the increased energy consumption. While they could previously cast ten talismans in a row, they could now manage only eight, or even fewer. The empowerment of the Talisman Spirits could not be sustained indefinitely.

However, these were minor issues. Nothing could be more heartening than receiving a response from the Divine Court.

Witnessing this scene, cheers erupted around them.

Within the city, spiritual lights flickered continuously. Countless altars rose into the air, and the sound of chanting echoed endlessly, as cultivators strove to summon the highest-ranking Talisman Spirits within their capabilities.

Under the night sky, the Immortal City shimmered with divine light, forming a stark contrast to the gloomy demonic clouds.

The cultivators who hadn't received a response were not discouraged.

As long as they survived this calamity, they would eventually restore the Divine Court to its former glory!

“Defend our Daoist Sect!”
“Defend our Daoist Sect!”
……

The cries resounded again, rising and falling, now with less despair and more heroic spirit.

‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’

The altar gates opened one after another, and Daoist cultivators led their troops to the front lines.

‘Rumble…'

The earth and mountains trembled.

Demonic clouds blotted out the sky, and the beast tide stretched as far as the eye could see.

‘Boom!’

The ferocious beasts arrived at the city walls.

Simultaneously, wind, frost, and raging fire descended from the heavens outside the city, transforming the earth into a morass of magma.

Each snowflake and each streak of fire possessed terrifying power, relentlessly reaping the lives of the beasts.

The city's protective grand formation activated!

“Kill!”

Roars of fury echoed from the city walls.

Under the protection of the city's grand formation, the Daoist cultivators charged towards the enemy.

The Dragon-Tiger Altar cultivators, empowered by divine force, were all incredibly mighty, leading their demon troops into battle.

Hidden within the formations were numerous altars, with Daoist masters serving as the core of each formation, controlling the battle array.

Looking down from above, one could see the entire Daoist force resembled a massive formation composed of altars, troops, and cultivators.

On the city walls, altars also floated in the air.

Countless altars, arranged in tiers, reached towards the clouds.

Many of these belonged to cultivators of the Golden Seal Altars, including numerous Cave Profound Grandmasters. Some joined forces to unleash devastating attacks, while others cast various divine talismans to support their comrades.

Compared to the beast tide, the Daoist force seemed meager, but their actions were well-organized and disciplined.

The Daoist forces divided into several detachments, plunging into the beast tide like raging torrents, yet coordinating with each other, crushing and sweeping through the enemy ranks.

Wherever their blades pointed, blood flowed like rivers!

At this moment, Ruoquan Zhenren's gentle chanting resonated from within the Immortal City. Though not loud, every cultivator and soldier could hear it clearly.

“Jade dew flows, divine spirits shine down,
Riding the Kui, soaring through the Nine Heavens.
People of the Nine Earths, destiny and fortune flourish.
Long life and eternal sight, forever free from sorrow.
Swiftly, as the law commands!”

The voice was like a gentle spring rain.

Many of the demon soldiers and cultivators, consumed by bloodlust on the battlefield, were on the verge of losing themselves. Upon hearing the chant, they regained some clarity.

Above the Immortal City, within the altar formation, one altar ascended high into the sky, surrounded and guarded by other altars.

The cultivator on the central altar was none other than Ruoquan Zhenren.

Bathed in divine light, her expression gentle, she resembled a holy mother descending from the Nine Heavens, unable to bear witness to the suffering of the world. She gently raised her jade hand, and her Heavenly Physician Staff radiated brilliant light.

The light transformed into a divine talisman, condensing in the void, forming a gigantic symbol that almost spanned the entire Immortal City.

Light streamed from the talisman's characters, and the divine talisman fluttered like a banner before shattering with a bang.

Myriads of shimmering lights drifted towards the city's exterior, falling upon the demon soldiers and cultivators engaged in battle.

The demon soldiers felt the effects most profoundly. They seemed to have gained infinite vitality, their Qi and blood surging as never before.

In some of their wounds, flesh began to writhe, the pain subsided, and they were instantly healed.

Even grievous wounds that threatened their lives were greatly alleviated.

Moreover, after healing their injuries, the talisman's power did not dissipate but continued to linger.

After casting this divine talisman, Ruoquan Zhenren's face turned deathly pale.  On the surrounding altars, some of the cultivators supporting her swayed unsteadily. Were it not for the divine empowerment, they would have already collapsed.

Ruoquan Zhenren took a deep breath, retrieved a jade bottle, swallowed the spiritual liquid within, and sat in meditation on the altar.

The other cultivators also took out pills and medicines to recover.

This divine talisman consumed a vast amount of energy, but its effects were immediate.

In an instant, the morale of the Daoist forces soared.  Their roars thundered like lightning, and they pushed the beast tide back a hundred miles in one fell swoop.

This was not limited to this single Immortal City.

Similar events unfolded in other cities, some holding their ground, others launching counterattacks against the beast tide.

Soon, the Immortal Cities on both the northern and southern borders were surrounded by the beast tide.

Guifang State and Jushan Prefecture were not spared, the two prefectures and their twin mountains becoming isolated islands in this world.

In the north, the demonic clouds churned like a sea, while in the south, the storm raged.

‘Boom!’

Suddenly, golden light erupted from a Daoist Immortal City.

The golden light shot straight into the sky, visible for a thousand miles.

As if it were a signal, other Immortal Cities emitted beams of golden light, each resonating with the others.

Golden radiance illuminated heaven and earth.

Within Jizhenjing Immortal City, Ruoquan Zhenren, sensing something, opened her eyes and gazed into the distance.

The entire northern border, like a golden serpent traversing east and west, formed a continuous line, a golden wall protecting the Daoist heartlands behind it.

For a time, the situation for the Daoist Sect looked favorable.

The beast tide was held at the border.

However, the situation in Jushan Prefecture and Guifang State was far more dire.

Jushan Prefecture fared slightly better.

On the human side, cultivators from the Thunderclap Left and Right Mansions stepped forward, organizing the northern cultivators to resist the beast tide, using the Star Island and the Immortal Lake as their stronghold.

The south was sparsely populated. Yin Tian Palace cultivators and the Daoist army of the Yellow Springs Dao formed a defensive formation.

On the demon side, the various demon nations were united.

The cultivators and demon cultivators of Jushan Prefecture were merely caught in the crossfire, many of them bewildered and numbly fighting.

They had no control over their fate and could only await the outcome of the conflict between Guifang State and the Daoist Court.

As for Guifang State, it was a scene of utter devastation.

The Great Sage of the Demon Race, in a desperate gamble, had deployed its elite forces to guard the  Drum of Summoning Demons at the Yellow Springs Dao and the Great Sage Mansion, leaving the outer defenses vulnerable.

The Drum of Summoning Demons could not control such a vast beast tide; it could only strive to guide the True Monarch-level great beasts.

The beast tide surged into Gangshan Prefecture, destroying demon cities, slaughtering indiscriminately, and leaving utter ruin in its wake. The scene was unbearable to behold.

Although the Merit Seal could draw upon the power of the Divine Court and resist the Six Heavens' ancient Qi, it couldn't expand outward on its own.  The purpose of constructing Tranquility Altars, Capital Altars, and Branch Altars was to address this.

Only areas where altars existed could be protected by the Merit Seal and incorporated into the Prefecture.

With demon cities collapsing and altars destroyed, the Six Heavens' ancient Qi immediately encroached, turning the lost territories, like those of Jushan Prefecture, back into blighted lands.

Even if the beast tide were repelled, rebuilding would be a formidable task.

This was no longer a pyrrhic victory. The Great Sage of the Demon Race was risking everything in a desperate last stand!

At the Great Sage Mansion, the drumbeats resonated through the heavens.

The Demon Kings grieved the destruction of their territories, yet understood their current predicament.

If the Daoist Court controlled the Divine Court, they could easily sever the connection between the demon lineage and the Divine Court. Then, the demons would have no choice but to submit to the Daoist Court, losing their freedom and becoming demon soldiers under the command of Daoist cultivators.

Generation after generation, they would be unable to rise again!

Compared to the Daoist Court, Guifang State was truly facing a moment of life or death!

A Demon King manifested its true form, a large demon resembling an ape, covered in gray fur, with a vertical eye on its forehead.

It stood before the Drum of Summoning Demons, all three eyes wide, wielding drumsticks in both arms, and pounded the drum fiercely.

'Dong!'
'Dong!'
'Dong!'
……

Beat after beat.

Each strike consumed a staggering amount of energy. Even a Demon King as powerful as this one began to falter.

The gray ape's arms trembled, its vertical eye bloodshot, but it persisted until it was utterly exhausted, striking the final beat with its last ounce of strength.  Its fur split open, it coughed up blood, and collapsed!

Behind it, another Demon King stood ready.  Without offering comfort or healing to its companion, it grabbed the drumsticks and immediately continued beating the drum.

Other demon cultivators caught the gray ape and began to heal its injuries on the spot.

The drumbeats reached the celestial pole.

The pangolin beast licked its wounds, its eyes filled with ferocious intent. Several times it lunged forward, attempting to attack the sword shadow.

Earth-shattering roars echoed from within the beast tide, rising and falling.

These roars grew increasingly mournful.

The Daoist cultivators understood that this favorable situation was temporary.  Those great beasts would eventually be overcome by their ferocity and charge forward.

When that time came, they would face not only the beast tide, but also terrifying opponents comparable to True Monarchs!
……

Within the Capital Altar of Zhongmao Prefecture, the two Grandmasters stationed there successfully established the altar, sitting cross-legged in mid-air above it. In unison, they spoke,

“We request the Upper Clarity Heavenly Hub Academy Seal!”

As their voices fell, a beam of precious light shot out from the Seal Bestowal Academy and flew between the two Grandmasters. It was the square seal previously held by Zhang Zhenjun.

The seal was made of jade, 1.8 inches wide and 1.9 inches long, with an inscription of six characters in two lines of overlapping seal script.

However, several areas on the square seal were of a different color, as if gaps had been repaired.

The two Grandmasters raised their arms, their four palms facing each other across the air, with the Upper Clarity Heavenly Hub Academy Seal suspended between them.

“We, by order of the True Monarch, convey this command to all altar masters…”

The two Grandmasters chanted in unison.

Far away in the Pure Spring Abbey, the Abbey Master, meditating before the Ancestral Altar, suddenly opened his eyes, his gaze sharp.  He abruptly stood.

“This disciple obeys!”

The Abbey Master bowed towards the Ancestral Altar, retrieved his Heavenly Physician Staff, and tapped it gently on the ground. Shifting his footing, he spun gracefully, his robes fluttering like a dancing butterfly.

The罡 step technique, performed by him, resembled a celestial dance, yet exuded heroic spirit and sanctity, forbidding any sense of disrespect.

The disciples remaining at the Pure Spring Abbey each brandished their Heavenly Physician Staffs, forming ranks behind the Abbey Master, following his steps as he paced the celestial罡.

At the same time, in various locations within the Daoist Sect – Tranquility Altars, Capital Altars, Ancestral Altars…

Daoist cultivators performed rituals before their altars, most wielding Dharma swords as if engaged in a sword dance.

All of them performed the same罡 step technique, synchronized in their movements, and chanted the same incantation.

Spiritual light shimmered from the altars, resonating with the Capital Altar.

This was the Daoist ritual, presided over by the two Grandmasters in the Capital Altar.

This ritual, activating all the altars within Zhongmao Prefecture, aimed to summon celestial deities.

Such a grand ritual naturally wasn't intended for ordinary Talisman Spirits!

After completing one set of罡 steps, the Capital Altar issued a command for another set, but the ultimate goal remained undisclosed.

……

‘Hiss!’

The pangolin beast, completely consumed by ferocity, let out a sharp shriek and transformed into a gray bolt of lightning, engulfing the sword shadow.

The next moment, a sword beam pierced through the gray lightning.  The residual energy effortlessly sliced several nearby mountain peaks in half, sending rocks tumbling into the beast tide.

The pangolin beast was flung back once more, a deep gash, exposing bone, now etched upon its shoulder.

However, this strike failed to kill the beast!

The pangolin beast let out a piercing scream.

Witnessing this, the other great beasts could no longer restrain themselves. A gigantic wing descended from the sky, belonging to the beast that had previously joined forces with the pangolin.

Terrifying celestial phenomena and auras erupted from other locations.

Within the Capital Altar of Zhongmao Prefecture, the two Grandmasters opened their eyes simultaneously.

Tian Yue Shangren had bought them precious time.  They had finally found a True Monarch-rank Talisman Spirit that still existed in the world!
