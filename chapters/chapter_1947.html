<h1>Chapter 1938 Tranquility</h1><p>Master Chen readily accepted two disciples, and waived their tuition fees.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dwell on such trivialities, thanked him, and had Xiao Wu and Yu Lang step forward to perform the apprenticeship ceremony.</p><p>"Mingyan, fetch two sets of writing implements."</p><p>Master Chen instructed.</p><p>The young servant, responding to the order, quickly ran down the mountain.</p><p>The apprenticeship ceremony took place at the temple.  Master Chen held great prestige among the villagers; even the delay in seeing patients didn't cause impatience.  They flocked into the temple, curiously watching the two young acolytes complete the ceremony.</p><p>When the breathless servant returned with the writing implements and several scrolls, Master Chen tested the boys' knowledge before personally initiating them as his disciples.</p><p>Xiao Wu was naturally to start with basic literacy classes.</p><p>Yu Lang had studied before, but there were slight differences in the scriptures taught in their respective regions, so Master Chen decided to have Yu Lang start in the basic literacy classes for a while.</p><p>Qin Sang agreed, temporarily keeping Yu Lang and Xiao Wu together until Xiao Wu adapted to the school environment before separating them.</p><p>After setting a date for their enrollment, Master Chen and his wife descended the mountain, leaving Qin Sang to continue seeing patients.</p><p>After a busy period, it was almost noon. The temple remained overcrowded.</p><p>Yu Lang, rushing to and fro, finally found a moment to sit beside Qin Sang, helping her grind medicine.  He worriedly said, "Master, what will you do when we're gone? When will Senior Taiyi emerge from seclusion?"</p><p>Luo Hou slept all day, Zhuque was unreliable, only Taiyi could help.</p><p>Xiao Wu also looked worried.</p><p>"You're worried about me now?"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, these disciples were more dramatic than she was.  "It'll only be busy for the first few days.  It won't be this crowded later."</p><p>On the first day, it wasn't until the stars were out that Qin Sang saw her last patient and closed the temple doors.  By the light of a small lamp, Qin Sang counted the coins and checked the accounts. Yu Lang, soaking in a tub, excitedly recounted his experiences at school, his gestures vivid and animated.</p><p>As Qin Sang predicted, by the fourth day, most of Qibai Village's patients had been seen, and the onlookers had lost interest.  The temple wasn't as crowded as before. However, news of the divine healer residing in the mountains of Qibai Village gradually spread.</p><p>One morning, as dawn broke, a young acolyte slowly opened the temple doors to find several people already waiting outside.  The autumn dew was heavy and cold. Some were shivering in their patched clothing.</p><p>"Come in, it's warmer inside," Yu Lang greeted them smoothly. A fire warmed the main hall, fueled by firewood generously donated by the villagers.  The mountain path had also been repaired a few days earlier; the village head even hired a drum and gong team to celebrate.</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang, each with a broom, swept the inside and outside of the temple—their daily chore.  Those who came for treatment would often lend a hand.</p><p>When they finished, Qin Sang emerged from her room.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Xiao Wu and Yu Lang ran to Qin Sang, their smiles uncontainable as they bowed. Today was the day they would descend the mountain to start school.</p><p>"Couldn't wait, huh? Look what I have," Qin Sang smiled at her two disciples, pulling her hands from behind her back, revealing two delicate little school boxes.  The boxes weren't large, but ample for a student's supplies.</p><p>"Wow! Thank you, Master!"</p><p>Yu Lang's eyes lit up, holding the box, reluctant to even put it on his back. Tears welled up in his eyes.  Few students had school boxes; most used bags. He had coveted the bags of his classmates, not realizing his own box would be so coveted by others. Because his classmates' bags were sewn stitch by stitch by their parents, while he had made his own box. This box was made from temple wood, nothing special, yet it was made by his master.</p><p>Xiao Wu, holding his box, treated it with far more care than any other possession.  He didn't speak, but as he touched the wood, his expression softened in a way Qin Sang had never seen before.</p><p>Qin Sang patted their heads and softly said, "It's getting late.  Go down the mountain."</p><p>Yu Lang and Xiao Wu exchanged glances, shouldered their boxes, and walked down the mountain side-by-side.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from the cliff as the two small figures grew smaller and smaller, feeling an inexplicable emotion. She hadn't felt this way with her other disciples.</p><p>"Perhaps it's because they were adults when they became my disciples," Qin Sang mused. "Is this what it feels like to raise children?"</p><p>The sun finally crested the mountain peak, its golden light illuminating Qin Sang's face, lengthening her shadow. She looked up at the stars, gradually fading in the brightening sky.</p><p>What would life be like if one day, I truly achieved immortality and became a celestial being, free from worries?</p><p>Would it be the same as now, simple and unassuming?</p><p>"This life... is quite good," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>Instead of being worn down by the peaceful days, he felt even more motivated.</p><p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo..."</p><p>The sound of roosters faintly came from the valley below. More people were arriving on the mountain path.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and went back to the main hall.</p><p>Patients came one after another, a never-ending stream.</p><p>Qin Sang, the renowned physician, had become a respected figure.  Even without Yu Lang, people spontaneously lined up. Anyone who disrupted the order was not only condemned by the crowd but also risked angering the physician and being denied treatment.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang managed everything smoothly, single-handedly.</p><p>Treating ordinary people consumed very little of his energy, leaving him free to contemplate matters concerning the main altar and Taiyi.</p><p>"Divine Doctor Daoist, please help me. I've had this tightness in my chest..."</p><p>After thanking the previous patient profusely, the next one immediately stepped forward and sat before Qin Sang.</p><p>This man appeared to be about forty, well-fed, and dressed in clothes that were neither luxurious nor ragged. He clutched his chest, quickly describing his symptoms with a pained expression.</p><p>Qin Sang put down his brush and looked at him. "You're not from the three villages down the mountain."</p><p>North of Qipái Village are two more villages: Beishan Village and Canghe Village, located deep in the mountains, and far less developed than Qipái Village.</p><p>The well-fed man was startled. "No! No! I'm from town. Have you met me before?"</p><p>"Your accent is different," Qin Sang said.</p><p>"You can tell that from my accent? You truly live up to your name as a divine doctor!" Unlike some places where accents vary greatly even within short distances, the accents in this area were quite similar, making it difficult for locals to distinguish subtle differences.</p><p>The well-fed man was completely convinced. He extended his arm. "Please examine me..."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't take his pulse.  "There's nothing seriously wrong with you.  A little care will do the trick. Haven't you seen a doctor before?"</p><p>"I saw a doctor in town, but I heard a divine doctor had come," the man said with a sheepish grin.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "No need. For a minor ailment like this, the town doctor is sufficient. Tell others the same, otherwise, coming here is a waste of your time."</p><p>"You... don't treat minor illnesses?"</p><p>The well-fed man was dumbfounded. He had never encountered such a peculiar doctor.  It defied common sense, and were it not for the Daoist's extraordinary reputation, even said to be admired by Scholar Chen, he would have certainly challenged him.</p><p>"Sir, please leave," Qin Sang gestured him away.</p><p>"I..."</p><p>The well-fed man was dissatisfied and about to speak when he noticed someone quickly entering the hall, prompting rebukes from other patients.</p><p>This person was strangely dressed in a thick coat and a large hooded cloak, completely concealing their face.</p><p>It wasn't that cold yet, was it?</p><p>"Hmm?  That face looks familiar..."</p><p>The well-fed man took another look, and the person removed their hood, revealing a familiar face.</p><p>"It's Doctor Liu!"</p><p>The well-fed man exclaimed, quickly rising.</p><p>This person was Doctor Liu, a well-known physician in town. He had previously consulted Doctor Liu, and encountering him here was rather embarrassing.</p><p>Doctor Liu's figure was hidden by his coat. He appeared to be around fifty, with a somewhat austere demeanor.</p><p>"I apologize! I apologize!"</p><p>Doctor Liu, flustered and having angered the crowd, repeatedly bowed and apologized, quickly going to Qin Sang and bowing deeply. "I am Liu Yuansheng, and I have come to apologize to the Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang looked puzzled. "We have never met. What is the meaning of this?"</p><p>"Daoist, yesterday I heard that you cured the old man Qi from Qipái Village and that you were seeing patients here, charging only a small fee and attracting a large number of people. I was resentful, so I came today with the intention of testing my skills against yours."</p><p>Doctor Liu had arrived at the temple early and had been secretly observing from outside.  A skilled physician could quickly tell the difference, he was immediately impressed. After hearing Qin Sang's conversation with the well-fed man, he finally couldn't resist entering.</p><p>"Not only is the Daoist's medical skill extraordinary, but he also possesses a benevolent heart towards his colleagues. You are truly a person of great virtue. I judged you with a villain's heart and thought of driving you out of Qinggui Town if your skills were inferior to mine. Shame on me! Shame on me!"</p><p>Doctor Liu didn't realize Qin Sang was a cultivator, traveling the mortal world, and would not compete with ordinary people for their livelihood.</p><p>"I heard that the Daoist's disciples are studying at the school run by Scholar Chen, and you lack assistance. I am willing to close my clinic and become your apothecary," Doctor Liu said earnestly.</p><p>This announcement caused an uproar. Doctor Liu was a well-established, renowned physician.</p><p>Qin Sang's popularity stemmed largely from his low consultation fees; he even offered credit to the impecunious, attracting many poor patients.  Few truly believed this itinerant Daoist's medical skills surpassed Dr. Liu's.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly.  The man's words were earnest, tinged with self-interest, but harmless; he was fundamentally good-natured.</p><p>“Dr. Liu, there’s no need. My meager earnings can’t support many people.  Besides, as a Daoist, I must also cultivate, and cannot constantly see patients all day.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Dr. Liu attempted to speak further, but Qin Sang stopped him with a wave of his hand.</p><p>“In the future, Dr. Liu, if you encounter patients you’re unsure about, feel free to bring them to the temple. We can discuss them together.”</p><p>Hearing this, Dr. Liu’s eyes widened.  He was self-aware; this ‘discussion’ would essentially be Qin Sang using the cases to tutor him, a privilege surpassing even that of an apprentice.  This was an opportunity most could only dream of.  Never had he expected to encounter a true medical prodigy in his old age – his decades of devotion had not been in vain. Dr. Liu nearly wept.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang didn’t interrupt, simply waving a hand, “Go.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Dr. Liu performed a respectful disciple’s bow.  A fifty-year-old man bowing deeply to a young Daoist seemed perfectly appropriate to everyone present.</p><p>After Dr. Liu left, the temple fell silent.  The onlookers regarded Qin Sang with even greater reverence.</p><p>“I now believe you are merely playing the part of a mortal,” a deep voice suddenly echoed through the main hall.</p><p>The patient before Qin Sang seemed oblivious, still anxiously watching him take his pulse.</p><p>Before the altar stood a man in white robes, possessing a refined and scholarly air. He had entered the main hall shortly after Qin Sang began his consultations. He hadn't come for treatment; he casually offered incense to the temple deity before standing with his hands clasped behind his back, watching Qin Sang treat patients with keen interest.  The villagers came and went, none noticing him.</p><p>“I thought the Land God wouldn’t reveal my identity,” Qin Sang replied calmly, without looking up.</p><p>The visitor was indeed the local Land God, a young man of refined demeanor.  He oversaw the region, and no event escaped his notice.  Learning of Qin Sang, he had come to investigate.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t deliberately concealed his cultivator’s identity.  Undertaking his trials didn't mean becoming a mere mortal.  Investigating the origins of the main altar might require the assistance of local deities.</p><p>“Mutual understanding is preferable, of course. But as the Land God, I receive the people's offerings; I must clarify matters for peace of mind.  It’s to prevent ill intent from bringing calamity,” the Land God said, staring intently at Qin Sang.</p><p>He couldn't discern the Daoist's cultivation level; either the Daoist was concealing it masterfully, or his cultivation far surpassed his own. However, he'd secretly observed the two disciples: one had recently started cultivation, the other was still a mortal.</p><p>“Are you reassured, Daoist Yue?” Qin Sang seemed to miss the underlying meaning.</p><p>“Your benevolent deeds benefit the people. I have no worries.  But, as my duty demands, the appearance of extraordinary individuals within my territory must be reported to the City God.  He may visit in due course; would the Daoist mind?”</p><p>The Land God decided against further investigation, opting for a direct report to the City God for judgment.</p><p>“That is only right.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone remained flat. He wrapped a packet of medicine and handed it to the patient, who left with profuse thanks.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's composure, the Land God frowned slightly, glancing towards the temple entrance. “The Daoist is busy; I shall not disturb you further. Farewell.”</p><p>“Farewell.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned a distant bow, startling the next patient.</p><p>The day passed in a flurry of activity, without the help of his disciples.</p><p>After sunset, Xiao Wu and Yu Lang returned to the mountain together, cleaning the temple and performing their evening devotions in the main hall.</p><p>“Master, I made several friends. Everyone likes Senior Sister… she learns so quickly, and I feel I’m getting smarter too…”</p><p>Yu Lang chattered excitedly about his day at school.  Xiao Wu smiled faintly.</p><p>From that day forward, the three continued their peaceful, daily routine.</p>
