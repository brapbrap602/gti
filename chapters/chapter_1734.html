<h1>Chapter 1725: Westward Journey</h1><p>Many disturbances occurred in Zhongzhou, but they need not be detailed here.</p><p>Qin Sang left Yanyue Nunnery and then went to Ganlu Zen Monastery.</p><p>His plan was to journey westward to Xitu, inform the cultivators there about the Ascension Platform, and personally visit Master Huaiyin.</p><p>He had learned from Ganlu Zen Monastery that Master Huaiyin originated from the Great Compassion Zen Temple in Xitu, a temple known for its ascetic practitioners and a rare Body Cultivation heritage.</p><p>Additionally, he also intended to ask Xitu for assistance in searching for the Earth-Slaying Sword fragments.</p><p>He had always suspected that there were still other fragments yet to be found.</p><p>First, each region had a corresponding Immortal Palace, each containing fragments of the Earth-Slaying Sword and incomplete cultivation techniques.</p><p>Second, due to the nature of the cultivation technique, the creator of the "Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter" must have been a peerless genius. Could they have truly stopped at the Void Refinement stage?</p><p>However, the Buddhist sects of Zhongzhou and Xitu had always maintained communication. Master Xingji confirmed that no Immortal Palace had been discovered in Xitu in the past.</p><p>It was also possible that a certain cultivator or sect had found an Immortal Palace and kept it a secret, enjoying its benefits alone.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't possibly visit every corner of Xitu alone; he needed the help of local powers. If he found fragments of the Earth-Slaying Sword and incomplete cultivation techniques, he naturally wouldn't take them for free.</p><p>For this journey, Qin Sang only brought his Avatar, leaving the Black Lion Great Sage in Zhongzhou.</p><p>After finishing his business in Xitu, he still needed to travel to other regions.  Unlike Xitu, which had ancient teleportation formations, he would have to traverse the storms, and the Black Lion would become a burden.</p><p>Leaving the Black Lion Great Sage behind served two purposes: firstly, as his mount and representative to oversee Zhongzhou, and secondly, as the Guardian Sage of Qingyang Temple, assisting Shen Chen.</p><p>Except for being subservient in front of Qin Sang, the Black Lion Great Sage could strut around anywhere in Zhongzhou. All powers, regardless of race, treated him with utmost respect.</p><p>Even disregarding Immortal Qin’s influence, the Black Lion Great Sage himself was a peak expert, and no one wished to offend him.</p><p>After Qin Sang's departure, the Black Lion lived quite comfortably.</p><p>Qin Sang only took his Avatar on this trip.</p><p>The Avatar consumed a great deal of energy.  The Second Nascent Soul was in a weakened state and could return to the main body for nourishment, which might even be faster for recovery.</p><p>In any case, cultivation was impossible while traversing the storms, so it wouldn't affect the main body's cultivation.</p><p>Bringing the Avatar was also a precaution against the unpredictable dangers that might arise within the Storm Belt, such as encountering extremely powerful ferocious beasts, just in case.</p><p>Yellow sand billowed across the Western Desert.</p><p>Qin Sang flew westward alone across the sea of sand.</p><p>The closer he got to the Storm Belt, the higher the temperature rose. Dry, hot winds blew against him, carrying scorching waves of heat, visibly distorting the void.</p><p>After flying for some time, a crimson expanse appeared on the horizon, resembling the most brilliant sunset.</p><p>Only after seeing the true nature of the 'sunset' could one feel the terror within. This was no sunset glow, but a raging inferno!</p><p>It was the Storm Belt, but not the ocean Qin Sang was familiar with; this was land.</p><p>Flames soared into the sky above the land, forming a fiery storm.  Countless tongues of fire and flickering flames danced across the heavens, stretching endlessly in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly see that the normally invisible barrier had been dyed crimson, as if countless fire spirits were dancing upon it, firmly preventing the firestorm from invading the cultivation world.</p><p>The invisible barrier separated the inside and outside of the storm into two distinct worlds. On the other side was a world composed of raging fire. The earth was cracked with countless fissures, overflowing with magma.  Underground flames constantly surged from these cracks, creating towering pillars of fire everywhere.</p><p>It was a miracle that this land hadn't been torn apart.</p><p>Swept up by the storm, the lower layer was a magma storm, while the upper layer was a firestorm. Both were equally scorching and boundless, capable of incinerating everything, even more terrifying than the storms at sea.</p><p>Low-level cultivators, if brave enough, could explore the oceanic Storm Belt but would never dare venture deep into the firestorm for long.</p><p>From afar, Qin Sang saw two monks standing outside the barrier.</p><p>They also noticed Qin Sang and immediately flew towards him.  Arriving before him, they bowed and said, "Greetings, Immortal Qin. We have received a message from the Abbot and are here to escort you to the ancient teleportation formation."</p><p>Without delay, the three flew into the firestorm.</p><p>Azure light emanated from the robes of the two monks, as if ripples of water were dispersing from them, encircling their bodies and repelling the flames.  They were clearly specially refined for this environment.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, made no visible movements; the flames couldn't touch him.</p><p>Looking down at the landscape below, Qin Sang thought to himself that this land, perpetually engulfed in flames, might have birthed some extraordinary spiritual fire.</p><p>Such naturally formed spiritual fires were extremely rare. If it was of a high enough grade, it could be used to cultivate the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus."</p><p>However, this land was vast and boundless, and it was said that this fiery landscape stretched all the way to Xitu, with both regions situated on the same landmass.  Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators couldn't withstand the constant scorching of the flames, so a thorough search of the firestorm would require Qin Sang to personally undertake it.</p><p>Business first; he could return to search for the fire later.</p><p>Soon, the two monks leading the way stopped.</p><p>Below them was a boundless magma lake.  The magma churned like the sea, forming towering waves, indicating its immense depth.  The scenery here was monotonous, but Qin Sang keenly noticed something different about this place.</p><p>"Reporting to Immortal Qin, the ancient teleportation formation is at the bottom of the lake."</p><p>One monk pointed downwards.</p><p>It turned out this magma lake was unique, possessing a lingering ancient spiritual formation. The ancient teleportation formation had survived to this day thanks to this formation.</p><p>However, after countless years, the spiritual formation was overburdened and nearly impossible to repair. Any drastic action might accelerate its destruction. The Buddhist sect could only perform simple maintenance, and the same was true on the other side.</p><p>Because prolonged stays within the lake were impossible, the monks responsible for guarding the ancient teleportation formation could only remain outside, which was how the Ghost Mother had exploited the opportunity.</p><p>They hadn't noticed anything until the Ghost Mother activated the ancient teleportation formation.</p><p>Qin Sang descended into the magma and quickly found the ancient teleportation formation.  He embedded spirit stones into it, and with a flash of light, he vanished.</p><p>…</p><p>Xitu.</p><p>Several figures stood in the air above a magma lake, all Buddhist monks.</p><p>At the front was a thin, elderly monk with a benevolent face and white hair. Beside him stood a seven-foot-tall, imposing monk – Master Huaiyin.</p><p>The monks silently watched the lake below, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>A figure suddenly flew out of the magma. Seeing the monks above, the figure paused briefly before flying straight towards them.</p><p>“Greetings, Immortal Qin.”</p><p>The old monk pressed his palms together and chanted a Buddhist mantra. Master Huaiyin and the others also bowed.</p><p>"Greetings, Master Zhitan," Qin Sang returned the greeting after landing. "I apologize for this unannounced visit and for disturbing your meditation."</p><p>This Master Zhitan was the Abbot of the Great Compassion Zen Temple and the foremost expert in Xitu.</p><p>Even Master Huaiyin treated him as his master.</p><p>"What are you saying, Immortal Qin? I have heard of your deeds in Zhongzhou and admire you greatly. Your lofty aspirations and concern for the world deserve our full cooperation," Master Zhitan said gently, but with a convincing authority.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to Master Huaiyin.  "It's been many years. You still possess the same impressive demeanor."</p><p>Observing Master Huaiyin, Qin Sang was secretly amazed.</p><p>Master Huaiyin looked healthy and full of vitality. It seemed his injuries had completely healed, and he appeared even younger and more vigorous than before.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that his flesh was as clear as jade, with a faint golden glow, extraordinary and unusual. His strength must have improved further, perhaps due to refining that Xin Metal Origin Crystal.</p><p>"I still remember Immortal Qin's dazzling debut at the Formless Immortal Sect. Your peerless presence remains etched in my memory," Master Huaiyin said with a gentle smile, completely unlike his ferocious demeanor in combat.</p><p>"This is not the place for pleasantries.  Shall we talk while we walk?"</p><p>Master Zhitan interjected.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "I was just about to visit your esteemed temple and experience the local customs of Xitu."</p><p>Unexpectedly, Master Zhitan shook his head. "Not yet. I'll take you somewhere first, Immortal Qin, for your assessment."</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, unsure what he was being asked to assess.</p><p>They flew north, following Master Zhitan.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang learned the situation, feeling both surprised and delighted.</p><p>It turned out they were going to a place suspected to be the ruins of an Immortal Palace!</p><p>The Buddhist sects of Xitu and Zhongzhou had long-standing ties.  Before his departure, Saint Huiguang had informed the Great Compassion Zen Temple of the situation.</p><p>Upon learning of the ascension of the Immortal Palace in Zhongzhou, Master Zhitan speculated that if an Immortal Palace existed in Xitu, it might have ascended as well.</p><p>Unlike Zhongzhou, the surrounding terrain of Xitu was entirely land, so an ascending Immortal Palace might leave behind traces. He secretly dispatched his disciples to investigate.</p><p>A discovery was finally made not long ago.</p><p>They learned from a small family in an oasis that one of their ancestors, while traveling, had entered the Storm Belt and witnessed a strange celestial phenomenon.</p><p>At that time, crimson flames had spiraled into the sky like a crimson dragon emerging from the earth, tearing through the void and soaring away. The ancestor had been terrified and fled in panic.</p><p>Calculating the time, it coincided precisely with the day the Immortal Palace ascended.</p><p>Master Zhitan and Master Huaiyin had just returned from that location.  A bottomless pit remained, now filled with magma, erasing any obvious traces. However, remnants of immortal restrictions seemed to linger deep within the pit.</p><p>But within the Storm Belt, even the Yuan Qi deep underground was chaotic. After descending a certain distance, both masters felt their strength waning and were forced to retreat.  They then invited Qin Sang to assess the situation.</p><p>Having explained the reason, they arrived at the location.</p><p>From above, it looked no different from other places.</p><p>Leaving the other monks above, Qin Sang jumped into the magma with the two masters.  Gradually, the two masters fell behind. Qin Sang activated his Fire Lotus for protection and continued to descend alone.</p><p>Reaching the deepest point, he activated his Heavenly Eye divine ability and carefully examined the area for a long time.</p><p>Half a day later, the three returned.</p><p>“The remnants of immortal restrictions below are no weaker than those of the Immortal Palace!”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke with a hint of excitement and certainty.  He had discovered fragments of immortal restrictions in the pit and, compared to the restrictions within the Seven Kills Palace's inner hall, they felt equally powerful.</p><p>The formations and restrictions of the Small Cold Region's Blood Lake, the Sinful Abyss's Abyssal Ruins, and the Xuantian Palace's Holy Land were no match for the immortal restrictions of the Immortal Palace.</p><p>This place was very likely where another Immortal Palace had fallen!</p><p>What that ancestor had witnessed was the scene of the Immortal Palace breaking through the void and ascending.</p><p>“There truly was an Immortal Palace in Xitu.  Unexpectedly, it was hidden underground.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced south. He had already inquired about the terrain of Xitu and learned that this was in the north of Xitu. This landmass was boundless, with Zhongzhou located at the eastern edge, but Xitu wasn't at the western edge; it was surrounded by land in all directions.</p><p>“This place isn't too far from the cultivation world. At least, Nascent Soul cultivators could reach this vicinity. Could it be that no one has ever noticed anything unusual and entered the Immortal Palace?”</p><p>Qin Sang inquired further.</p><p>Where there was an Immortal Palace, there might be cultivation techniques and fragments of the Earth-Slaying Sword!</p><p>If another power had obtained them, he would have to retrieve them, no matter the cost.</p><p>Master Zhitan said gravely, "I don't know what this place looked like before the Immortal Palace ascended, but our temple has no relevant records. I, along with past Abbots, have repeatedly joined forces with other temples to search for the Immortal Palace, but to no avail.  And as far as I know, I haven't heard of any sect suddenly prospering and obtaining an extraordinary inheritance."</p><p>After a pause, Master Zhitan continued, "Before coming here, I sent messages inviting the Abbots of other temples and fellow Daoists to a grand gathering.  They are currently awaiting Immortal Qin at our temple.  If any sect has indeed occupied the Immortal Palace alone, now that it has ascended, there's no need to keep it secret any longer.  With Immortal Qin bringing news of the Ascension Platform, we can use this opportunity to inquire."</p><p>Even without Qin Sang asking, Master Zhitan would actively investigate this matter.</p><p>It wasn't about coveting their treasures.</p><p>Various signs indicated that the Heavenly Demonic Sound was related to the ascension of the Immortal Palaces.  Perhaps someone had obtained something within the Immortal Palace that could lead to the source of the Heavenly Demonic Sound.</p><p>The Three Sects Alliance of Zhongzhou had already begun doing so. Once Qin Sang returned to Canglang Sea and the North Sea, he would also begin his investigation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  "I have been collecting the cultivation techniques and secret arts of the Immortal Palaces, even incomplete fragments are acceptable. If there is any news, please have someone inform me."</p><p>Master Zhitan readily agreed.</p><p>They didn't stay long and set off towards the cultivation world together.</p><p>While discussing the Dharma and Dao with the eminent monks and planning for the upcoming gathering, Qin Sang pondered the matter of the Immortal Palaces.</p><p>Considering the entire Small Thousand World, the North Star Region and the North Sea weren't far apart and could be considered a single entity.  In fact, the North Star Region had always been regarded as one of the four regions of the North Sea.</p><p>The North Sea, Zhongzhou, Xitu, and Canglang Sea all had Immortal Palaces.</p><p>Such a one-to-one correspondence couldn't be a coincidence.</p><p>What was the relationship between the Immortal Palaces and the regions of the cultivation world?  Which came first?</p><p>Were the refuges established first, attracting the Immortal Palaces?  Or was it because of the Immortal Palaces that, with this world on the brink of destruction, an invisible barrier could be erected, protecting the living beings nearby?</p><p>Where was the Demon Sea? Did it have an Immortal Palace and Earth-Slaying Sword fragments?</p><p>If it did, which part of the Earth-Slaying Sword was it? Could there be more than one such celestial sword?</p><p>Also, when he and Liu Li traversed the storm, they encountered a desolate cultivation world, much smaller than the other regions. Did it have an Immortal Palace?</p><p>Qin Sang had asked Master Huaiyin about this. Zhongzhou had always known about that place. For great cultivators, the distance wasn't considered far.</p><p>It was said that in the past, not only were there living beings there, but cultivators as well. It was unknown why a great plague had occurred. When powerful cultivators from Zhongzhou visited again, they were horrified to discover that all life had been extinguished, and it had become a desolate wasteland.</p><p>Some suspected that local cultivators had inadvertently brought it from some ancient secret realm, as such a terrifying plague couldn't have originated in the mortal world. But no one dared to confirm it.</p><p>While pondering these questions, they arrived at the edge of the Storm Belt.</p><p>As they passed through the invisible barrier, Qin Sang subconsciously reached out and clenched his hand, sighing inwardly, "I only hope that the ascension of the Immortal Palaces won't affect the cultivation world's barrier, leaving a glimmer of hope for the beings of this world."</p><p>At this moment, Master Huaiyin, who had been mostly silent, spoke, interrupting Qin Sang's thoughts, "I observe that Immortal Qin's Qi and blood are extraordinary. Are you also skilled in the Dao of Body Cultivation?"</p><p></p>
