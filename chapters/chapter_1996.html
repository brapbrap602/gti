<h1>Chapter 1987: The Yan Yang Corpse Canon</h1><p>Qin Sang thought of Qingyuan.</p><p>The other party's explanation of the Lesser and Greater Vehicles had brought clarity to Qin Sang, finally showing him the way.  His recent retreat for enlightenment had been quite fruitful.  Xiao Wu had gained experience in the ways of the world, his humanity suppressing his demonic nature.  From now on, it would simply be a matter of gradually diminishing the demonic intent, his transformation was imminent.</p><p>Though unconventional, Qin Sang had finally grasped the essence of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*. He wondered if Qingyuan had spoken so much to guide him toward the Dao Court, or if Qingyuan had recognized his confusion and obstacles, deliberately offering guidance.  Even if, given time and exposure to other powerful figures in the vast world, he would eventually have understood, he still had to acknowledge Qingyuan's kindness.</p><p>The vast world is boundless and the path ahead uncertain. He wondered if they would ever meet again.</p><p>"Greater Vehicle."</p><p>These two words swirled in Qin Sang's mind, refusing to leave.  It's hard for ordinary people to imagine that there could be a Greater Vehicle of the Killing Dao.  Qin Sang initially found it rather absurd, but upon reflection, it wasn't without precedent.</p><p>Through the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, one can glimpse the changes in the Ziwei Sword Venerable's state of mind and his path of cultivation.  It can be roughly divided into two stages, with the Nascent Soul stage as the dividing line.</p><p>Before Nascent Soul, killing intent condensed into killing talismans; murderous aura was rampant.  After experiencing the confusion of the Nascent Soul stage, and breaking through to the Divine Transformation stage, by sheathing his sword, he was able to control his killing intent, no longer the killing star he once was.</p><p>However, how the Ziwei Sword Venerable attained the Greater Vehicle of the Killing Dao, and what he experienced, is a matter of much speculation.  While the Divine Transformation stage was merely focused on suppressing the killing nature, the Void Refinement stage achieved transcendence from slaughter – a truly earth-shattering change.</p><p>Even more curious is why, if the Ziwei Sword Venerable acted with the intention of protecting all living beings, did he fall to the point of his pavilion being destroyed, his sword shattered, and the world becoming his enemy?</p><p>Now that the Ziwei Sword Venerable has disappeared, his forces scattered, and enemies still pursuing his remaining followers, even his 'successor' has to live in hiding.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't figure it out, but he wasn't in a rush.  From today on, he would openly step forward, making contact with major forces in the vast world, believing that he would eventually uncover some secrets.</p><p>The Dao Court and the Ziwei Sword Pavilion possess unfathomable power.  They were undoubtedly influential forces in the vast world, and even in their decline, they would leave traces behind.</p><p>Unless…</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect in Zhongzhou, erased from history by the combined forces of Daoists and Buddhists, and his certainty wavered.</p><p>A flurry of thoughts erupted, quickly suppressed by Qin Sang.  Overthinking was pointless; the most important thing was his own cultivation.</p><p>The return of the Dao Court and the Ziwei Sword Pavilion is a game played by powerful figures.  Without sufficient strength, like those swept along in the recent turmoil, one would only become a pawn.  When that day comes, even Ziwei Tongzi would likely abandon him.</p><p>Sighing inwardly, Qin Sang saw Yu Lang standing outside the plaza, hesitant to approach, so he beckoned him.</p><p>Yu Lang's mind echoed that phrase, half-understanding.  Collecting himself, he stepped forward and bowed, "Greetings, Master."</p><p>He had deduced that Daoist Qingfeng might be some kind of incarnation, but he felt there was a deeper meaning to his Master's words that he couldn't grasp.</p><p>Looking at his unfamiliar Master, Yu Lang's thoughts were in turmoil, still deeply shocked.</p><p>Judging from his senior sister's reaction, he had guessed that his Master was strong, but he hadn't imagined this level of strength.</p><p>With a single command, the world is overturned!</p><p>Yun Xian Shi, a cultivator from Yun Du Tian, left a voice transmission token for Tao Teng and fled back to Yun Du Mountain, not daring to show his face.  Various factions in the Yan Kingdom's cultivation world all retreated to the mountains, closing their doors and isolating themselves from the world.  Sha Da Ge and Tao Teng didn't dare enter the city, waiting anxiously outside the city walls.</p><p>The Master’s words are like heavenly laws.</p><p>The chessboard has been overturned, yet the Void Refinement ancestors of Luo Hun Yuan and Yun Du Tian have yet to appear, seemingly acquiescing.  He didn't yet know that the Ming Hu ancestor had perished and Luo Hun Yuan was in turmoil; if he did, he would be even more shocked.</p><p>"You should return to the mountain," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Yu Lang paused, replying, "Disciple obeys."</p><p>Before the words were finished, Yu Lang felt something, looking north. He saw a procession, a palanquin surrounded by an entourage, approaching from the imperial city.  Soldiers cleared the way, separating the people.  Civil and military officials followed close behind, conspicuously lacking the Prime Minister.</p><p>The procession passed the statue, ignoring them standing before it.  It must be Master’s illusionary technique, Yu Lang thought, then showed a surprised expression.  He saw them setting up an incense altar before the statue, with offerings of animals, and the monarch personally leading the civil and military officials in a ceremony, reciting the sacrificial text – a ceremony even grander than the Heaven Sacrifice.</p><p>"Great matters of state lie in sacrifice and warfare." Sacrifice has always been of paramount importance; Yu Lang was no stranger to it.</p><p>Now, the Yan Kingdom uses the Heaven-worship ceremony to worship a statue of their master!</p><p>The sacrificial text includes phrases like "acting on behalf of Heaven," "purifying demonic influences," "guarding humanity," and "sages of the world."</p><p>Yu Lang glanced at his master.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes shone with divine light as he looked towards the city, his gaze seeming to transcend the Yan Kingdom and sweep across the entire world.</p><p>At the same time, the same grand ceremony took place in various kingdoms across the world, replacing the Heaven-worship ceremony as an annual tradition, with the sacrificial text circulated throughout the land!</p><p>Qingfeng Daochang's virtue is known far and wide.</p><p>Qin Sang seemed lost in thought.</p><p>As the ceremony progressed, Qin Sang subtly felt a mysterious connection forming between himself and those statues, an inexplicable link.</p><p>While his cultivation didn't significantly improve, using it to verify his techniques, he found a new clarity.</p><p>Qin Sang's face remained impassive, his heart neither elated nor disappointed.</p><p>In this battle, only the Old Ancestor Ming Hu died.  Qin Sang merely verbally warned Gu Yun Sou, ensuring the Yun Du Heavens wouldn't interfere in human affairs again.</p><p>The world would be his world.</p><p>When he descended the mountain, Qin Sang didn't expect to make his move so quickly, seizing territory from two powerful forces.</p><p>Moreover, this territory was the least valuable in the area.</p><p>Even more unexpectedly, this became his place of enlightenment.</p><p>If this is his path, originating from his true nature, continuing on this path, he should eventually achieve great success, making his future cultivation of the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* much smoother.</p><p>But was he willing?</p><p>Qin Sang reflected on his path.</p><p>Initially cultivating the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, then called the *Chapter of Nurturing the Soul Sword*, he felt little resonance with it.</p><p>Relying on the Jade Buddha, he gradually reached this point, the cracks in his foundation widening.</p><p>Before today, Qin Sang believed he would follow the path of the Ziwei Sword Venerable, using the *Ziwei Sword Scripture* as his fundamental cultivation method, desperately seeking the latter half of the scripture.</p><p>Suddenly, that urgency vanished.</p><p>Of course, this doesn't mean he would abandon the search for the latter half of the scripture.  Even if he changed cultivation methods, the *Ziwei Sword Scripture*, a top-tier cultivation technique in the world, remained the best reference.</p><p>"Master plans to build sixty-four branch temples across the world, along with the main temple, and entrust their management to you.</p><p>Each branch temple will initially have a mountain-guarding spirit beast; there's no need to rush into recruiting personnel. I will have Taiyi and others spread throughout the world, searching for children with exceptional talent and strong character to bring into the sect.</p><p>My words were not empty boasts.</p><p>Qingyang Temple will oversee the world; all major and minor sects and factions will be under its jurisdiction to prevent anyone from secretly defying orders and disrupting the world."</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>Humanity's fate was decided.</p><p>For Qingyang Temple to oversee the world, relying solely on an empty shell would not suffice; the hearts of men are fickle, and intimidation only lasts for a short time.</p><p>Hereafter, Qingyang Temple truly took root in the vast world.</p><p>Yu Lang listened respectfully, his expression growing serious.</p><p>Master had driven away the Yun Du Heavens and Luo Hun Abyss, intimidating the cultivation world, forbidding cultivators from interfering in human affairs. This was exactly what he had sought after, and how could he not be pleased?</p><p>But this responsibility was heavy indeed.</p><p>Overseeing the world was far beyond the scale of a small Yan Kingdom.</p><p>Qin Sang continued, "With Taiyi and the others assisting, and the divine path also overseeing things, you don't need to do everything personally; prioritize your cultivation."</p><p>Before, Qin Sang allowed Yu Lang, despite his unfinished cultivation, to descend the mountain and experience the world, without urging him to focus on his practice, because he understood the importance of using his experience to cultivate wisdom.</p><p>Yu Lang possessed talent, and, more importantly, a resolute dao heart, so Qin Sang didn't want to see this disciple lead a mediocre life.</p><p>"Master's care and concern are deeply appreciated. I will remember it in my heart."</p><p>Yu Lang took a deep breath and nodded heavily.</p><p>Master's teachings were a profound lesson. Without Master, he would be merely a pawn, struggling in the murky waters, all his aspirations empty rhetoric, his fervor turning to nothing.</p><p>Only someone like Master could intimidate the wicked and restore peace and order to the world!</p><p>He was filled with gratitude for Master, believing that Master’s actions were aimed at awakening him.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't explain further. After watching the entire ceremony with Yu Lang, he left quietly, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Yu Lang stayed in the Yan Kingdom, appearing in the court, resigning from his official position, summoning Sha Jia Yu to come into the city, bringing his family with him, to return to the mountain together.</p><p>Qin Sang strolled through the clouds, heading west. He was unhurried, seemingly inspecting the world.</p><p>As he walked, a purple light shot towards him from ahead.</p><p>He caught it; it was a purple bamboo slip.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The bamboo slip ignited spontaneously without fire, transmitting Gu Yun Sou's voice.</p><p>…</p><p>West of Mu Luo Mountain.</p><p>In the plains, deep ravines stretched endlessly, their depths unfathomable.</p><p>This was once the mountain gate of Luohun Abyss, the dojo of Old Ancestor Minghu.</p><p>Now, above the ravine, numerous white clouds float, with many figures densely packed among them.</p><p>These people have sharp brows and bright eyes, dressed in white, their auras clear and bright, devoid of any demonic energy.</p><p>In the center of the cloud formations, nine people sit or stand on a single cloud—the Nine Immortals of Yun City.</p><p>The Nine Immortals of Yun City are filled with excitement, yet also deep confusion, repeatedly looking up towards the heavens.</p><p>Unseen by the other disciples, the Supreme Master of Yun City, Gu Yunshou, sits cross-legged on a cloud, seemingly awaiting someone.</p><p>“Master, why has he entered meditative seclusion at this time?”</p><p>A female cultivator among the Nine Immortals whispered.</p><p>Everyone looked at Yun Xi, who shook his head slightly, indicating that he didn't know either.</p><p>The Nine Immortals of Yun City exchanged glances.</p><p>Ancestor Minghu had left the mountain to seize a treasure; they had fled in a panic and then faced a cataclysm.  A series of unexpected events followed.</p><p>Just as the Nine Immortals were at a loss, their master finally arrived, bringing them peace of mind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the master ordered them to use all the sect's strength to exterminate the corpse demons of Luohun Abyss.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were shocked but dared not disobey.  To their surprise, the extermination went exceptionally smoothly.</p><p>Their master personally took action, capturing several top experts from Luohun Abyss effortlessly.  The rest were disorganized and easily dealt with; most of the effort was spent chasing down fleeing soldiers.</p><p>Even when the mountain gate was attacked, Ancestor Minghu did not appear to stop them, making his demise clear.</p><p>The Nine Immortals were both surprised and delighted.</p><p>They were delighted that Yun City had finally eliminated this major threat, but surprised by how Ancestor Minghu perished.</p><p>Their master's cultivation was no secret.  It was said that Ancestor Minghu was cultivating a powerful divine ability. Even if their master had broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, defeating Ancestor Minghu would be difficult, and killing him even more so.</p><p>Failing to completely eliminate the threat, Yun City could not withstand Ancestor Minghu's furious retaliation.</p><p>Therefore, although both sides were sworn enemies, neither wanted a fight to the death.</p><p>Their master's complete eradication of Luohun Abyss and Minghu's certain death suggested a mysterious individual had issued the order.  Could it have been a helper summoned by their master?</p><p>These past days, Yun City was unusually excited, about to completely destroy Luohun Abyss, but the master ordered a halt without explanation.</p><p>Morale began to falter.</p><p>Gu Yunshou wasn't actually in meditation; he was still thinking about that day.</p><p>When the Daoist declared his intention to protect the mortal realm, Gu Yunshou's heart leaped, fearing an attack.</p><p>After all, the mortal realm's chaos stemmed from the two major sects using it as a chessboard, and Yun City was implicated.  He, Gu Yunshou, was one of the masterminds.</p><p>Fortunately, the Daoist spared him, only requiring Yun City to exterminate the demons.</p><p>The Daoist didn't send anyone to monitor them, so Gu Yunshou, understanding the situation, ordered his disciples to turn over any belongings of corpse demons at or above the Transformation stage after they were slain.</p><p>As for the treasures within the Luohun Abyss mountain gate, Gu Yunshou dared not keep them for himself and asked the Daoist to collect them personally.</p><p>Otherwise, a thunderbolt would strike Yun City.</p><p>In a fleeting glance, Gu Yunshou couldn't fathom the details of the Daoist's formation, unsure of its range or how many thunderbolts it could unleash, and he dared not offend Qin Sang.</p><p>During this time, Gu Yunshou considered every sect, including the Jitian Sect, but couldn't figure out the Daoist's origin.</p><p>He seemed to appear out of thin air yet acted fearlessly.</p><p>He certainly had reason to be fearless.  His cultivation of both body and spirit, innate spiritual treasures, sword domain, and altar all indicated an incredibly powerful sect backing him, or at the very least, a highly skilled master.</p><p>Perhaps even a Unity stage cultivator!</p><p>Without the guidance of a Unity stage cultivator, how could he comprehend the sword domain at the early Nascent Soul stage? How could he have a spirit weapon brew tea for him?</p><p>Every time he thought about it, Gu Yunshou felt uneasy.</p><p>If it were only himself, he could escape to a faraway land, but relocating the sect wasn't so easy. He couldn't abandon his sect's heritage.</p><p>The mortal realm had been claimed by the Daoist, with numerous altars established.  Expecting him to leave was impossible.</p><p>Gu Yunshou's headache was managing the relationship between them.  He only hoped the Daoist's backing and the Jitian Sect weren't in conflict.</p><p>If two such powerful forces clashed, little Yun City would be crushed between them.</p><p>“Sigh!”</p><p>Gu Yunshou sighed, noticing the Daoist approaching at high speed, and rose to greet him.</p><p>"The remnants of Luohun Abyss are hiding below. Luohun Abyss’s sect formation is an ancient array obtained by the old zombie years ago. It's quite intricate. I ask for your assistance, Daoist, to break it together!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, noncommittal.</p><p>The darkness of Luohun Abyss couldn't obstruct his vision.</p><p>Through the formation, he saw panicked faces.</p><p>In truth, he had no grievance with Ancestor Minghu; the Ancestor was merely a tool for his ascension.</p>
