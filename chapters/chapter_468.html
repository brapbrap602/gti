Chapter 461: A Man of the Mortal World


Under the soft moonlight, Qin Sang was stunned.


How could such a woman appear in the mortal realm?  Having witnessed the rise and fall of the world, remaining untouched by it all, and living a secluded life in a moon palace—that should be her destiny.  Facing this woman, Qin Sang felt a sense of inadequacy. He was, after all, a man of the mortal world.


Having witnessed Qingluan transform from a wooden carving and back again, Qin Sang suspected this woman might also be a puppet carved by Old Madam Jing. But after seeing the woman in person, he wavered.  What incredibly powerful puppetry could create someone so real, so perfect?


"It is I,"


the woman softly nodded, confirming she was Old Madam Jing. Her voice had changed; it wasn't as distant and aloof as her demeanor, but rather softer, though still tinged with coldness and loneliness, like the solitary moonlight in the night sky.


"It's really you?" Qin Sang exclaimed, "Were you disguised before? This is your true form?"


Old Madam Jing didn't explain, but calmly asked, "It's merely a vessel. What difference is there between my former self and my current self?"


Well, I'm a common person.


Qin Sang chuckled wryly to himself, refraining from further questioning. He watched as Old Madam Jing stepped out from beneath a jade pillar, her gaze fixed on the towering Zhǐtiānfēng peak.


"Would you like to see your Grandmaster's cave entrance?"


Qin Sang was startled.  Looking up, following Old Madam Jing's gaze, he could only see swirling clouds.  The next moment, Qin Sang felt a sudden tightening, and he was swept upwards by Old Madam Jing, soaring through the air.  The wind roared in his ears as Shao Hua Mountain rapidly descended below him. In an instant, the clouds were within reach.


The cloud layer was only halfway up Shao Hua Mountain.  Beyond the clouds rose a snow-covered peak, its summit almost piercing the gale winds of the heavens. From his vantage point, Qin Sang could vaguely see a stone gate carved into the cliff face at the peak.  The gate was adorned with incredibly complex runes, glowing with a mystical light— none of which Qin Sang could decipher.


A howling wind and swirling snow raged, yet they couldn't penetrate the ten zhang radius before the stone gate.


"Is this enough?" Old Madam Jing turned to Qin Sang.


If I say no, are you going to push the gate open?


Qin Sang smiled wryly, realizing for the first time just how fragile his heart was.  "Enough! Enough! I believe you..."


…


The waters of the  Chaos Islands.


Qin Sang sat listlessly in his cave, one hand clutching a tangle of silk thread, the other holding the wooden carving Old Madam Jing had given him, examining it repeatedly.  What had just happened felt like a dream, so unreal. He'd made a trip back to his sect, been lucky enough to glimpse the cave of a Nascent Soul ancestor, and only then had he returned to reality in his own cave.


Back in the Chaos Islands, Old Madam Jing had left, leaving him only the Star Spirit Net and the carving.


Before, Qin Sang had thought the carving was incredibly lifelike and perfect.  But seeing the real person, he realized it was far, far inferior.


Qin Sang's mind raced, preoccupied with one question.


Old Madam Jing… what level of cultivation does she possess?


Even someone as powerful as She Po wouldn't be able to come and go from Shao Hua Mountain freely without being noticed by Dongyang Bo, would she?


The gap between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core is immense. The difference between Golden Core and Nascent Soul must be like a chasm.  There are many Golden Core cultivators in the Little Cold Region, but how many Nascent Soul masters are there?


Could Old Madam Jing be a Nascent Soul master in disguise?


Qin Sang was startled by his own thoughts, his eyes shifting restlessly.  If he could forge a connection with a Nascent Soul master, even without any benefits, Qin Sang would be delighted.  Especially since Old Madam Jing had promised to help him obtain the maximum amount of Star Yuan Stones to exchange for the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.


However, Qin Sang also understood that this would turn it into a transaction, a deal, and that after that, they'd be even.


Favor isn't so easily gained.


With his level of cultivation, he held no value whatsoever to someone of Old Madam Jing’s level.


Cold and aloof, keeping people at a distance—that was Old Madam Jing's true nature. The old woman in Wen Yue Market was merely a disguise, a wanderer in the mortal world.


As for why Old Madam Jing was hiding in Wen Yue Market, Qin Sang dared not ask.


"Zhǐtiānfēng…"


Qin Sang silently looked towards the southeast, clearing his mind and entering meditation.


…


The token startled him awake once more.


Qin Sang abruptly stood up, drawing spirit stones into his palm, about to rush out, but then paused, his hand going to his chest where he had hidden the carving.


Grandma Jing had said the wood carving couldn't be stored in a storage pouch; it had to be carried on one's person.

Fortunately, it looked like an ordinary, unremarkable peach wood carving.  Qin Sang could easily explain it away if anyone asked.

Cultivation wasn't about severing worldly ties or eliminating emotions; cultivators were just mortals with great power, at least those at the Foundation Establishment stage.  Everyone needs something to believe in.

Seeing how Grandma Jing used her carving, Qin Sang remembered buying a peach wood sword from her years ago as payment for a deal with the He sisters.

Like the carvings of Qingluan and Grandma Jing, Qin Sang couldn't see anything unusual about the sword.  Could it also possess great power?

Powerful cultivators traveling the mortal world sometimes leave behind fortuitous items for those they deem worthy.  The true power of these items only becomes apparent when the recipient faces danger, saving their life and propelling them to great heights.  These stories are commonplace in the cultivation world.

Unfortunately, Qin Sang was overthinking it. Grandma Jing had explicitly stated that her shop only sold ordinary wood carvings, and the sword Qin Sang bought was no exception.  However, these carvings were made using Grandma Jing's unique methods, and their only effect might be to significantly improve the skills of a mortal woodcarver who saw them.

Hiding the carving, Qin Sang took a deep breath, left her cave dwelling, and flew towards Stargazing Island.  She met Senior Brother Rong on the way.

Senior Brother Rong looked serious and was not in the mood for conversation.  They exchanged greetings and silently continued their flight towards Stargazing Island.

Upon arriving at Stargazing Island, they waited briefly until thirty-three experts gathered. The island was silent; everyone took their positions without exchanging words.

After a short wait, a bright light suddenly emanated from the depths of Stargazing Island, followed by five figures arriving on flying swords.  The first to arrive was Serpent Granny.

Besides Serpent Granny, Vice-Island Master Xiao was among them; the other three were all late-stage Golden Core cultivators.

"Old woman and Daoist Xiao will go ahead. Everyone, gather the other cultivators and follow," Serpent Granny's voice echoed.

"Yes!"

The other three immediately dispersed, flying towards the Righteous and Demonic cultivators, as well as the unaffiliated cultivators.

"Get on!"

Serpent Granny waved her hand, and the snake bracelet on her wrist detached, transforming into a giant serpent. Its vertical pupils glowed with a cold light as it scanned everyone.

Everyone was secretly alarmed and carefully flew onto the back of the giant serpent.
