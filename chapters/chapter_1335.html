Chapter 1327: The Time is Nearing

After speaking, Qin Sang ignored the others and began to speak on his own. The mountain quickly returned to tranquility, with only Qin Sang's calm and unhurried voice echoing softly.

At first, Qin Sang's words were simple, easily understood even by Qi Refinement disciples. They had initially come merely to witness the spectacle, fearing that the teachings of a Nascent Soul Patriarch would be too profound. To their surprise, they found themselves gaining real insights and soon became fully engrossed in his lecture.

As for the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, some grew impatient, wondering why a Nascent Soul Patriarch would spend so much time on such low-level content, especially on the external art of artifact forging. Naturally, they dared not show disrespect in front of a Nascent Soul cultivator, but they couldn't help but grumble inwardly.

While some of their minds wandered, a few noticed that several of their peers were utterly captivated by the lecture, their fascination seemingly genuine. Realizing they might have overlooked something, these cultivators quickly refocused their attention. To their astonishment, they discovered that the seemingly superficial content, which they had thought they had long mastered, actually contained unimaginable profundities. With just a few words, Qin Sang opened up a new world for them.

Artifacts, magic treasures... Qin Sang's lecture progressed layer by layer. His forging techniques, a fusion of the methods from the Surging Sea and the Ethereal Spirit Sect, formed a unique system. Many cultivators, due to their initial dismissiveness, found themselves increasingly unable to follow the lecture, as if listening to an incomprehensible celestial scripture. Eventually, they were gently pushed out of the mountain by a soft force, realizing too late what they had missed and filled with regret.

By the end, only Qin Sang, Qing Jun, Bing Han, and Jing Yu remained on the mountain. Each of them wore thoughtful expressions, patiently listening until Qin Sang finished. They then began to engage in a profound discussion with him, not limited to the art of forging. This discourse lasted seven days and seven nights.

Low-level disciples gazing up at the mountain peak could see four figures seated around a stone platform, though no sound reached their ears. A thin mist enveloped the scene, making it seem as though celestial immortals were gathered amidst the clouds.

...

Two years later.

Peach Blossom Valley.

The mist parted, revealing three figures: Qin Sang, Qing Jun, and Bai. Qing Jun took out a communication talisman and said, "Elder Netherfiend has sent word. They've already set out ahead of us and asked us to meet them directly at the Abyssal Ruins."

Bai, with an apologetic expression, said, "I'm the one who delayed us. I had intended to cultivate a secret technique, but it took far longer than I expected."

"Brother Bai, your cultivation is the priority," Qin Sang replied. "The Immortal Gate hasn't opened yet. What difference does it make if we arrive a bit late?"

Qin Sang glanced westward, silently calculating the time. "Fellow Daoist Jing Yu should be arriving soon."

As soon as he finished speaking, a bolt of lightning streaked across the distant horizon, landing before the three of them in the blink of an eye. After exchanging greetings, they immediately set off.

Bai suddenly remembered something and said, "I should probably hide for now. If we encounter others along the way, it might lead to unnecessary explanations."

With that, he vanished into Qin Sang's Corpse Puppet Bag. Qin Sang had been thinking the same thing.

Their destination was the Abyssal Ruins, where they planned to enter the Immortal Gate. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Violet Palace would soon emerge. This expedition to the Violet Palace was fraught with uncertainties, and Bai was Qin Sang's greatest hidden card. The later his presence was revealed, the better.

For this journey to the Violet Palace, all cultivators below the Nascent Soul level had been excluded. The other Nascent Soul cultivators from the Cold Domain had already left ahead of them, while they had waited for Bai to finish his seclusion, delaying them by a few days.

Qin Sang wasn't entirely sure how powerful Bai had become. For Bai, the greatest hurdle had been advancing to the Corpse King stage, which he had already overcome. The subsequent stages were relatively simpler. However, given that only twenty years had passed, Bai's strength shouldn't be excessively overwhelming.

The three of them flew swiftly, and upon entering the grasslands, they encountered Nascent Soul cultivators from the Heavenly Alliance. They joined forces and continued their journey together.

Abyssal Ruins, Mist Sea.

Figures floated in small groups around the Seven Waters Illusory Formation, occasionally glancing at the swirling mist vortex as they discussed something.

As soon as Qin Sang and his companions arrived, they were immediately welcomed to the gathering. Qin Sang looked around and realized they were among the last to arrive. Nascent Soul cultivators from the North Star Realm had received the news early and had come ahead of time.

The allure of Elder Ye's schemes and the anomalies within the Violet Palace had drawn almost all of them, except for those with unavoidable commitments.

"Fellow Daoists, you've finally arrived. Let me repeat what we've just discussed," said Elder True One.

Qin Sang and the others turned their attention to Elder Cang Hong.

"There are three forbidden zones within the Palace of the Fallen Deity, each hiding ancient secrets. These are places our Fallen Abyss has long sought to explore, and they may also be Elder Ye's targets. We cannot overlook them. After careful consideration, I suggest we split into three groups and head directly to these three forbidden zones. If we encounter Elder Ye, we will surround and eliminate him within the Violet Palace. If he is not found in any of these places, we will quickly regroup at the entrance to the Violet Palace. This way, we won't waste much time. Additionally, Fairy Qiu Zhi and a few others will remain outside to guard the Seven Waters Illusory Formation, preventing Elder Ye from escaping..."

Elder True One lightly tapped the air, and a misty image of the Palace of the Fallen Deity's terrain appeared. The interior of the palace was extremely complex, filled with dangerous restrictions far more perilous than those in the Violet Palace's inner halls.

Although Elder True One and the others had already heard this once, they listened with great seriousness this time as well. The three forbidden zones Elder Cang Hong pointed out were located in three different directions within the palace. If everyone were to explore them together one by one, it would waste a lot of time. The best approach was to divide their forces.

This approach carried some risks, but they had prepared thoroughly for this expedition. If they encountered Elder Ye, they should be able to hold him off for a while until reinforcements arrived.

"Elder True One and I will head to the forbidden zone on the left. Fellow Daoist Netherfiend and King Yu will take the one on the right. Fellow Daoist Qin, you and Fellow Daoist Lu will take the one in the middle. How does that sound?"

Elder Cang Hong pointed to the forbidden zone located in the center of the Fallen Abyss.

Qin Sang and the others neither agreed nor disagreed, instead asking about the dangers within the forbidden zones and how they could determine whether Elder Ye was there. Elder Cang Hong answered all their questions without hesitation.

Qin Sang and Qing Jun exchanged silent messages. The dangers of the three forbidden zones were comparable, so it didn't matter much which one they chose. The real threat was Elder Ye.

Next, Elder Cang Hong pointed to the depths of the Palace of the Fallen Deity, where the passage to the Violet Palace was located. "We suspect that Elder Ye's ultimate goal is the Violet Palace. But since he entered long before us, we can't possibly move faster than him. We'll have to search for him slowly after entering the Violet Palace. Elder Ye's ambitions are vast, and any significant actions he takes will surely leave traces."

Elder Netherfiend added, "The inner halls of the Violet Palace may seem stable, but they are far more dangerous than the Palace of the Fallen Deity. Most of the forbidden zones are not places that Nascent Soul cultivators can venture into alone. Elder Ye's options are limited. Last time, he forcibly broke into the Heavenly Mountain. It's highly likely he'll head there again this time..."

Seeing that they had already considered everything thoroughly, Qin Sang and Qing Jun said no more and agreed to the plan. They joined Lu Boyuan and the other Nascent Soul cultivators to discuss their next steps.

As the Violet Palace's emergence drew near, the Abyssal Ruins grew increasingly turbulent. The Mist Sea was in chaos, with chaotic currents appearing everywhere. Without protection, cultivators below the Nascent Soul level would find it difficult to survive here.

As time passed, a few more Nascent Soul cultivators arrived sporadically. Everyone silently watched the vortex, waiting for the Immortal Gate to open!
