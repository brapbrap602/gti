<h1>Chapter 2106: Seeing Is Believing</h1><p>Qin Sang was well aware of Si Lu's thoughts, but he wouldn't specifically help Si Lu take revenge and reclaim the throne.</p><p>Ultimately, all he was doing now was preparing for a rainy day.</p><p>If Si Lu's identity were exposed and the Lu family of Hanjiang came to attack, and the Thunder Altar was complete, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't show any mercy. If Si Lu's identity remained hidden, or if the Lu family considered the price too high and were unwilling to attack them, Qin Sang wouldn't take the initiative to attack, and he didn't have the strength to do so either.</p><p>In the end, it still depended on how the situation developed.</p><p>Moreover, in Qin Sang's view, the Mirage Jade was just a fleeting hope.</p><p>The chance for outsiders to enter the sacred land of the Exotic Tribes was too slim. Qin Sang dismissed it with a smile, not holding out much hope.</p><p>If Si Lu could truly achieve this, he wouldn't mind visiting the sacred land, even if most of the opportunities there might not be suitable for him.  But that place was the training ground for Saint Realm and Ancestral Realm experts of the Exotic Tribes. Even the most basic opportunities were at the Void Refinement level, and if he were lucky enough to obtain one, it would benefit him immensely.</p><p>Of course, his mindset would be good, treating it as an opportunity to broaden his horizons.  Gaining something would be fortunate, losing wouldn't be a tragedy.</p><p>Si Lu had been paying attention to Qin Sang's expression. Seeing this, he felt a pang of disappointment, but he also understood the principle of haste makes waste. He didn't say anything more and silently put away the Mirage Jade.</p><p>"So, we will have at least one enemy at the late Void Refinement stage," Qin Sang said thoughtfully.</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "They don't know that Grand Attendant Xia has already fallen. Once they receive the news, the Grand Protector of the Lu family will definitely come personally, and there will certainly be other helpers."</p><p>The Grand Protector of the Lu family was of similar cultivation level to Grand Attendant Xia. If they wanted to eliminate all threats, he alone wouldn't be enough.</p><p>It was still unclear whether the Lu family had allies. If they had already formed an alliance with the Si You Royal Family, they needed to be prepared to face two or even three top experts.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained calm as he said indifferently, "Once the Thunder Altar is completed, it doesn't matter how many enemies there are."</p><p>Si Lu felt a strong confidence in his tone, and the unease in his heart inexplicably calmed down a lot.</p><p>…</p><p>The Western Lands.</p><p>A flying ship hovered in midair, with streaks of light constantly flying from afar and landing below the ship.</p><p>Most of the arrivals were young men and women, all brimming with spiritual energy, possessing excellent talent, representing the future of various sects and tribes.</p><p>They had never seen such a magnificent flying ship before, and their youthful curiosity couldn't be suppressed. But when they thought of the high hopes their sects placed upon them, their hearts suddenly became heavy, their expressions somber and worried.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Several beams of spiritual light suddenly shot down from the flying ship, manifesting as steps in the void, and the cabin door opened.</p><p>Everyone boarded the flying ship in an orderly manner.</p><p>Above the ship, Qin Sang and Si Lu stood side by side, Ji Hong perched on Si Lu's shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands towards Su Nu. "We'll be back soon. If the Zhangyou Tribe attacks, try to hold them off."</p><p>"Don't worry, Brother Qin. I understand."</p><p>Su Nu watched as Qin Sang and the others boarded the flying ship. The ship trembled and then pierced through the sky.</p><p>She returned by the same route, beginning to patrol the several major domains.</p><p>Currently, the various sects and tribes of the Storm Realm were fully engaged in constructing altars, a scene of bustling activity, and they would inevitably encounter various problems.</p><p>On the other side, the flying ship cloaked itself, sailing steadily at high altitude, with Qin Sang and Si Lu jointly concealing its fluctuations.</p><p>Arriving at the edge of this sea region, the flying ship plunged into the misty tide, riding the wind and breaking through the fog, quickly emerging from the other side.</p><p>Ji Hong identified the direction and directed Qin Sang to sail due north.</p><p>The refuge chosen by Su Nu was located northeast of the Zhuyan Tribe's territory, not too far from the Storm Realm.</p><p>During their return journey, they had already explored a safe path, so Qin Sang and Si Lu only needed to be vigilant of the surrounding energy fluctuations, in case they encountered Zhuyan Tribe experts.</p><p>The flying ship gradually accelerated.  The journey was uneventful, and they smoothly reached the edge of the misty tide.  Ji Hong found the mark they had left, and the ship plunged into the fog. After a rapid flight, Qin Sang felt something and cast a spell.</p><p>The next moment, a bright light appeared ahead.</p><p>The mist was hazy, the light and shadow indistinct.</p><p>Below them was not the ocean, but a vast expanse of land. This land was large but incredibly desolate, covered with bare rocks and yellow earth. Occasionally, a few plants that could survive in the misty tide could be seen, but their propagation was also extremely difficult.</p><p>A rising mountain range was faintly visible, with the light on the other side, like a giant lantern.</p><p>As they drew closer, everyone on board was surprised to find that the other side of the mountain range was lush and green.</p><p>These trees were unlike any they had seen before, with straight trunks and crowns like giant opened umbrellas. The source of the light was the veins of the leaves, interwoven into a network of light, the intersections being the most prominent, resembling a bright starry sky.</p><p>These were clearly not ordinary trees, but a type of spirit wood.</p><p>Under the illumination of the spirit wood, the area below was as bright as day. Even more peculiar was that the halo seemed to repel the misty tide. The surroundings and the sky were enveloped in mist, but beneath the trees was a clear space.</p><p>Because the trunks were slender and the crowns were exceptionally large, the space below was quite expansive, with a lake in the center, resembling an oasis in the desert.</p><p>This was the place carefully selected by Su Nu, rich in spiritual energy.</p><p>The oasis was protected by a grand formation, the formation tools crafted by Qin Sang, so as soon as he arrived, he sensed it.</p><p>The change in the formation alerted Qing Jia and Qing Yi. They flew to the canopy, their faces full of vigilance. Seeing the flying ship and Qin Sang at the bow, they were overjoyed.</p><p>"Qing Jia, Qing Yi, greetings, Great Master."</p><p>After Su Nu and the others left, these two were left behind to manage the oasis and construct dwellings and caves. They had played a part in building this place.</p><p>"These are Qiqi Trees, and the vines wrapped around them are called Qiqi Vines. Working together, they not only shield against the mist, but also confuse Mist Beasts.  The Qiqi Trees' light brightens with sunrise and dims with sunset, maintaining this rhythm even within the misty tide. This light also nourishes all living things, allowing even mortals to maintain a normal sleep cycle. This miraculous spirit wood was first discovered by our Jiaojiao Tribe."</p><p>Ji Hong pointed to the spirit trees, his small face filled with pride.</p><p>"Truly remarkable," Qin Sang praised without reservation, thinking to himself that the Jiaojiao Tribe was indeed a treasure trove.</p><p>Ji Hong beamed at the praise and glanced behind him. "Unfortunately, Qiqi Trees have limitations. When they grow in clusters, their power is strongest, but as their number increases, their power actually weakens. Moreover, Qiqi Trees are rare. I only have these. It's best if you don't reproduce too many offspring here."</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze across the oasis. It was more than enough to accommodate those on the ship, but future circumstances also needed to be considered.</p><p>"Are there other spirit trees that can expand the oasis?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Ji Hong nodded. "Yes!  Our ancestors have always been dedicated to finding ways to resist the misty tide.  If the mist were to engulf the entire Mist Sea and never disperse, the Exotic Tribes would still need a place to inhabit. However, they later discovered that the power of the misty tide wasn't strengthening, but rather gradually weakening.  The territories of the various tribes were more than sufficient, so the research was put on hold. But there are certainly records and spirit seeds preserved."</p><p>"The power of the misty tide is weakening?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Perhaps," Ji Hong shrugged. "Who knows if it's like the Tainted Lands, also subject to tidal changes? We might just be in a period of low tide.  Even the lifespan of a Saint Realm expert is too short compared to the vastness of time and the heavens."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed with Ji Hong's statement and asked, "Where can we obtain these spirit seeds?"</p><p>"It depends on whether you can afford the price. This isn't something that can be achieved with just one type of spirit tree. It might require dozens or even hundreds of different types of flowers, grasses, and trees working in harmony, extremely complex. Each one is incredibly precious. I don't have any…"</p><p>Ji Hong spread his hands. "I have to consult the elders of my tribe, but even if I can find them, they might not be willing to see me."</p><p>Si Lu interjected, "The whereabouts of the Jiaojiao Tribe elders are unpredictable. Their abodes could be anywhere, making them difficult to find."</p><p>Ji Hong said indignantly, "They're afraid that someone will steal their achievements. Hmph, so petty! I'm more afraid that they, in their old age, will steal the spirit seeds that I discovered first!"</p><p>"Why can you only search for people outside? Doesn't your Jiaojiao Tribe have a territory?"</p><p>Yu Nu couldn't help but ask.</p><p>This time, it would stay in the oasis to look after the place. Li Yufu and Shen Chen had duties elsewhere, and Huan Hen needed to be tempered on the battlefield, so only Yu Nu could come.</p><p>"We do, but it's not the kind you imagine. Ordinary people can't find it. And…"</p><p>Ji Hong seemed to recall some unpleasant memories and pouted. "Our Jiaojiao Tribe has a small population. I好不容易才跑出来, and if I go back, I'll definitely be forced to breed. I'm not going back!"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others chuckled.</p><p>As they spoke, the flying ship sailed into the oasis. The younger generation disembarked, and Yu Nu bowed, also getting off the ship.  Gathering everyone together, it gave instructions and made arrangements.</p><p>Qin Sang watched for a moment, then said to Si Lu, "Let's go."</p><p>The return trip didn't have so much baggage. There was no need to take the flying ship. The two used their movement techniques, flying through the air.</p><p>Not long after, they arrived near the core territory of the Zhuyan Tribe and landed on a mountain peak.</p><p>Ji Hong jumped down from Si Lu's shoulder, worriedly saying, "Be very careful."</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "You two wait here. I'll be back soon!"</p><p>With that, Si Lu summoned his flying light and soared into the sky.  Along the way, he took out the token given by Yuan Miao and activated the restrictions on it.</p><p>A short while later, a slight fluctuation emanated from the token, indicating a direction.  Si Lu's flying light changed course, and soon he arrived before a mountain.</p><p>Green pines and cypresses covered the mountain, and winding paths led deep within.</p><p>Si Lu's figure flickered, landing on a bluestone. He saw thick vines hanging down from the cliff above like pythons.  Suddenly, a cave came into view, its stone door wide open. Moss grew on the rocks on either side, and a clear stream meandered past the entrance, its water gurgling.</p><p>"What a secluded abode!"</p><p>Si Lu praised.</p><p>Laughter came from within. Yuan Miao strode out. Seeing only Si Lu, he said with disappointment, "Fellow Daoist Qin didn't come?"</p><p>Si Lu, knowing the temperament of the Zhuyan Tribe, wasn't offended and smiled, "I came today to ask for a favor."</p><p>Fortunately, the Zhuyan Tribe wasn't ignorant of social graces. Yuan Miao gestured invitingly, "Fellow Daoist Qu, please come inside and speak."</p><p>Entering the cave, they took their seats.</p><p>Si Lu got straight to the point, explaining his purpose and adding, "I'm not on good terms with my tribe and wish to seek a place to reside. It just so happens that there's no Supreme Tribe in the Storm Continent, and they are willing to submit to me. I wonder if your noble tribe would agree? I understand the rules of the Ancient Covenant and can swear an oath that my actions will never overstep the boundaries. Regardless of any turmoil that may arise, it will not implicate the Zhuyan Tribe or other Imperial Tribes."</p><p>Yuan Miao was stunned. "Fellow Daoist Qu, are you saying that there's a continent next to the Zhangyou Tribe's territory, and this place has an owner, inhabited by outsiders, and they've already pledged allegiance to you?"</p><p>Noticing Yuan Miao's expression, Si Lu's heart stirred. Could it be that the Zhuyan Tribe truly didn't know about the Storm Realm?</p><p>He and Qin Sang had analyzed it. Logically, the sudden appearance of so many outsiders in their territory would be difficult to hide from the Zhuyan Tribe's eyes.</p><p>If they were truly unaware, it could only mean that the Zhangyou Tribe had done a good job of keeping secrets, and that the Zhuyan Tribe strictly adhered to the Ancient Covenant, never interfering in the internal affairs of Imperial Tribes.</p><p>The Ancient Covenant was fixed, but its implementation had a lot of leeway. Some Supreme Tribes sought absolute control over their Imperial Tribes. Other Supreme Tribes, like the Jiaojiao Tribe, didn't involve themselves in worldly affairs.</p><p>For the Imperial Tribes, both situations had advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Given the Zhuyan Tribe's temperament, it was quite possible that they truly didn't know.</p><p>For them, this was undoubtedly good news.  A Zhuyan Tribe that couldn't even be bothered to control their Imperial Tribes was unlikely to reject the Storm Realm.</p><p>"Indeed, Brother Qin is from the Storm Continent, and he is their leader," Si Lu replied, his expression unchanged.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin?  Isn't he Fellow Daoist Qu's guard, who came with you from outside?" Yuan Miao asked, puzzled.</p><p>Si Lu and Qin Sang had already prepared their story. "This place was originally Brother Qin's homeland.  A long time ago, he left due to an accident, and only after achieving a certain level of cultivation was he able to find his way back.  He is willing to be my guard, also for the convenience of moving around in the Mist Sea.  Fellow Daoist Yuan also knows that the Mist Sea is the domain of our Exotic Tribes, so Brother Qin decided to submit to me, willingly becoming my Imperial Tribe."</p><p>"Have they fought with the Zhangyou Tribe?" Yuan Miao asked.</p><p>"They have been at war for many years, with a generations-long blood feud!"</p><p>Si Lu nodded. "Originally, neither side had Void Boundary Second Stage experts.  After Brother Qin returned, he didn't attack the Zhangyou Tribe, hoping to resolve their feud.  Unexpectedly, the Zhangyou Tribe Chieftain had a breakthrough, and somehow discovered Brother Qin's identity.  He gathered several helpers and attacked us.  Fortunately, Brother Qin is powerful, and both sides were wary of each other, so a true war hasn't broken out yet.  But the situation is showing signs of getting out of control.  Brother Qin is struggling alone, worried that you might side with the Zhangyou Tribe, so submitting to me was a last resort, a way to seek self-preservation."</p><p>After a pause, Si Lu added, "Of course, if Fellow Daoist can persuade the Zhangyou Tribe to stop and recognize the Storm Continent as the ancestral land of outsiders, Brother Qin is also willing to resolve the feud between the two tribes."</p><p>He didn't want to see the Storm Realm and the Zhangyou Tribe reconcile, as that would render him useless.  But he understood even better that the trust between him and Qin Sang was hard-won, and it was best not to make any moves behind Qin Sang's back.</p><p>Moreover, a thousand-year blood feud wasn't so easily resolved.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Yuan Miao stood up and paced back and forth.  "I rarely interfere in the affairs of the Imperial Tribes and cannot make this decision. I need to consult with those above.  Please wait here for a while, Fellow Daoist Qu."</p><p>Si Lu naturally didn't object and rose to see him off.</p><p>Yuan Miao walked out of the cave, clouds forming beneath his feet, disappearing into the horizon in moments.</p><p>Si Lu stood by the clear stream, waiting only for the time it takes to burn an incense stick, before seeing Yuan Miao return, faster than expected.</p><p>"I need to go to the Storm Continent myself.  Seeing is believing," Yuan Miao said gravely as he landed.</p>
