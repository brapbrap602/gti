<h1>第 1487 章 Floating Sky Mountain</h1><p>Demon-Rejecting Island.</p><p>As the name suggests, this island owes its name to the demon race.</p><p>Many years ago, the Profound Heaven Palace suffered internal strife, and the demon race took advantage of the situation to invade the mainland multiple times, massacring mortals and low-level cultivators, resulting in a river of blood in the Hidden Sun Realm, a truly tragic sight.</p><p>It wasn't until the four lineages reconciled and the Profound Heaven Palace worked together as one that they were able to organize an effective counterattack, completely driving the demon army out of the Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>Demon-Rejecting Island was one of the landmark locations in that great battle.</p><p>Since then, the Profound Heaven Palace has ceased its internal squabbles, gradually recovering its vitality, and its strength has increased day by day. The demon race has launched many attacks, but all have been unsuccessful, and at most, they only managed to attack Demon-Rejecting Island before being unable to continue.</p><p>Now, Grand Elder Tong Lingyu is stationed on Demon-Rejecting Island, commanding the Profound Heaven Palace cultivators to fight against the demon race.</p><p>For the Profound Heaven Palace, Demon-Rejecting Island can be considered another holy ground.</p><p>After many years of operation, Demon-Rejecting Island has been built into an impregnable fortress.</p><p>The entire island, along with a large area of ​​the nearby sea, is covered by a grand formation, hidden in the mist. Once the demon army presses in, Demon-Rejecting Island is the strongest bastion.</p><p>Within the mist, guards patrol, and security is tight.</p><p>Teams of cultivators come and go, among them there are many with powerful auras, hurrying about, adding a bit of nervous atmosphere.</p><p>At this moment, three streaks of escaping light flew from the direction of the Hidden Sun Realm.</p><p>It was Shi Xue, Liu Li, and Qin Sang.</p><p>In recent years, Shi Xue has spent most of her time on Demon-Rejecting Island, assisting Tong Lingyu.</p><p>There were some trivial matters at Listening Snow Tower, and she had only returned for a few days when a new situation arose on the battlefield, so she brought Qin Sang and Liu Li and hurried back.</p><p>The three approached.</p><p>From the depths of the mist, a stream of light immediately flew out, while emitting a strong hostility as a warning.</p><p>Shi Xue signaled Qin Sang and Liu Li to stop, took out a token, and waved it forward.</p><p>The stream of light stopped, revealing a team of guards.</p><p>The lead Core Formation cultivator was neither humble nor arrogant, bowing and saluting, saying, "Greetings, Palace Master Shi."</p><p>Shi Xue nodded, pointing behind her: "This is my junior sister Liu Li and Qingfeng Daoist, the guest elder of Listening Snow Tower."</p><p>The man glanced at Qin Sang and Liu Li, took the token from his waist, held it in his palm, and closed his eyes slightly.</p><p>The token flashed slightly, as if sensing something from somewhere on the island.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang and Liu Li both felt a sense of being scrutinized. This was their first time coming to Demon-Rejecting Island, and this kind of review was necessary, even if Shi Xue brought them.</p><p>After a moment, the man's expression softened, and he stepped aside, opening the way forward.</p><p>A passage appeared in the mist.</p><p>The three moved forward slowly. As soon as they landed on Demon-Rejecting Island, a streak of escaping light fell in front of them. It was Elder Mei.</p><p>"You're here."</p><p>Elder Mei greeted with a smile, then took out two tokens and handed them to Qin Sang and Liu Li respectively.</p><p>"Refine them with blood, and you won't need so much trouble to enter in the future… Follow me, the Grand Elder is waiting for you."</p><p>The four walked and talked. Shi Xue took the opportunity to inquire about the war from Elder Mei.</p><p>"As you know, in the last great battle, although we abandoned the outer sea islands, we retreated in time, so the losses were not great. Neither side gained any advantage, but there were no serious casualties either. In the end, we hastily withdrew our troops, which seemed a bit anticlimactic."</p><p>Elder Mei briefly mentioned the previous situation, and then said, "Old Demon Golden Roc (Tianpeng Laoyao) is very ambitious and will definitely not be willing to give up like this. The Grand Elder expected this, but didn't expect him to make a comeback so quickly, and with such great fanfare. If it was the previous kind of offensive, there would be no need to worry too much. A few days ago, we discovered some new faces in the demon army…"</p><p>After a pause, Elder Mei glanced at Qin Sang and said, "Thanks to Qingfeng Daoist's previous information, we were able to determine their origins without any effort. They are all demon kings who are attached to Great Sage Nine Heads (Jiutou Dasheng)!"</p><p>Shi Xue's expression changed slightly, "Is Great Sage Nine Heads also going to participate in the war?"</p><p>Great Sage Nine Heads has been famous for many years.</p><p>His temperament is indifferent, and everyone knows it.</p><p>Over the years, Great Sage Golden Roc has been fighting alone, and Great Sage Nine Heads has not shown any intention of helping him. People once suspected that this Great Sage Nine Heads had encountered some kind of trouble, and was seriously injured or even fallen.</p><p>All things have spirits, each has its own Dao.</p><p>The demon race's Heavenly Tribulation is different from that of the human race, and even different bloodlines have different intervals between Heavenly Tribulations. The human race cannot accurately judge the state of Great Sage Nine Heads.</p><p>Of course, this is also related to the battlefield situation.</p><p>There are no Great Cultivators in the Star Sand Islands. Previously, the Profound Heaven Palace had been watching from the sidelines, and Great Sage Golden Roc had not encountered any strong opponents. If he encounters a life-threatening danger, Great Sage Nine Heads should not sit idly by and watch his fellow clan members perish.</p><p>"We can't rule out this possibility."</p><p>Elder Mei said.</p><p>A moment of silence.</p><p>There was something they didn't say. The Profound Heaven Palace has the Palace Master and Grand Elder, two Nascent Soul late-stage experts. Even if the demon race came out in full force, they wouldn't be afraid.</p><p>But the problem is, the Palace Master hasn't shown up publicly for a long time.</p><p>Anyone with eyes can see that the Palace Master's condition is probably worse than expected.</p><p>The Profound Heaven Palace has many Nascent Soul cultivators, and its overall strength is very strong. It can fight against two demon race Great Sages, but if the Palace Master cannot take action and no one stops Great Sage Nine Heads, it will inevitably cause serious casualties.</p><p>No one dares to guarantee that misfortune will not befall them.</p><p>Only Qin Sang felt relaxed and didn't have much worry.</p><p>The only thing he cared about was whether this demon chaos would affect the holy ground.</p><p>While speaking, the four flew to the highest peak of Demon-Rejecting Island.</p><p>A magnificent hall was built on the top of the mountain as a place for discussion.</p><p>The elders, hall masters, and the four main lineages of the Profound Heaven Palace, as well as the most powerful lineages, were basically all present. Some of them were unable to attend the wedding ceremony.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately fell behind half a step to show his low profile.</p><p>Still, many people's eyes fell on this son-in-law of Listening Snow Tower.</p><p>Of course, they had no contempt. To be a 'son-in-law' requires enough strength and talent to be recognized. Qin Sang is obviously qualified to sit on an equal footing with them.</p><p>Shi Xue introduced some Daoists that Qin Sang had not met before, and they exchanged greetings.</p><p>After taking their seats, they waited for a few more people, and Tong Lingyu arrived late. Without wasting words, she went straight to the topic.</p><p>Because the two demon race Great Sages and the holy ground were involved, each lineage had its own opinion and the debate was endless. Now, the power of the four main lineages could be seen. Some unreasonable proposals could be vetoed with one vote.</p><p>With Qin Sang and Liu Li sitting behind her, Shi Xue was confident and argued with reason.</p><p>Qin Sang kept to his duty, only watching and not speaking.</p><p>Until late at night, a consensus was barely reached.</p><p>If the situation does not improve, a large number of people must be left to guard Demon-Rejecting Island when the holy ground is opened.</p><p>For example, people like Qin Sang who have the qualifications to compete for the Body Cleansing Pool must go to the holy ground, and they should accept more dangerous missions as compensation for those who cannot enter the holy ground.</p><p>Things like that.</p><p>There are various games between each lineage, and even within a lineage. They are intricate and must be taken into account, which tests the abilities of Tong Lingyu and the palace masters of each lineage.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li were assigned a mission to go deep into the front line to investigate.</p><p>As long as his qualifications are not taken away, Qin Sang has no objections and works hard without complaint.</p>
