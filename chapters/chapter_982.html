<h1>Chapter 974: The Jiao King's Son</h1><p>At this time, strange lights flickered before the Heavenly Tower, and figures leaped out one after another.  </p><p>They were the Heavenly Dao Sect Master, the Grand Shaman, and the two clans' Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Both sides gathered behind the two Grand Cultivators. Although it wasn't like last time, when the Demon Lord and the Grand Shaman directly fought, the atmosphere was still tense, far from relaxed.</p><p>"I didn't expect you to be able to open the ancient restriction.  You must have obtained the treasure you wanted, haven't you?"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi said with a forced smile.</p><p>The Grand Shaman smiled charmingly. "Your actions were so swift, everything I did was under your watchful eye. If I really obtained any treasure, how could I hide it from you?"</p><p>"Your methods are unfathomable. I really don't have much confidence."</p><p>Ling Zhuzi chuckled, his eyes flickering as he scanned the Grand Shaman and Fang Laomo, whose body resembled a withered leaf. A hint of hesitation appeared in his eyes.</p><p>The Grand Shaman smiled without speaking, her遁光 flashed, and she flew directly towards the exit of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi hesitated for a moment, but ultimately chose not to attack. He also flew towards the wasteland. Some of the other Yuan Ying cultivators followed, while others remained in the Seven Killing Hall, tending to their own affairs.</p><p>Wasteland.</p><p>Before the Seven Killing Hall closed, the vortex-shaped passage was still quite large.</p><p>In the void, a shadowy figure lurked—Mou Laomo.</p><p>His expression wasn't as gloomy as before. He held someone's storage pouch, his face thoughtful, somewhat strange, and hesitant, seemingly unsure of what to do.</p><p>Edge of the Wasteland.</p><p>A sword light suddenly appeared in the wild grass and rushed into the passage.</p><p>The same scene played out again.  The moment the newcomer was about to enter the passage, he was suddenly attacked by Mou Laomo.  This person was also formidable; at the critical moment, his sword light sharply turned, aiming at the attacker and striking fiercely!</p><p>But the difference in strength between the two was too great. This person was only a mid-stage Golden Core cultivator, weaker than Qin Sang.</p><p>A large hand enveloped in blue flames easily broke through the sword light.  Before the cultivator's terrified eyes, his flying sword was snatched away.</p><p>The flying sword wailed but couldn't escape.</p><p>The cultivator watched helplessly as a blue flame rapidly grew larger before him.</p><p>At that moment, Mou Laomo seemed to sense something. His expression changed, and he abruptly turned his head towards the depths of the Seven Killing Hall, his eyes darkening. Then, his hand seals changed dramatically.</p><p>The speed of the blue flame soared. The cultivator was powerless to resist. The cold fire easily broke through his protective spiritual light and entered his forehead. Immediately, his entire body was covered with a layer of ice.</p><p>‘Pop!’</p><p>The ice shattered.</p><p>The cultivator turned to ashes, consumed by the cold fire. Mou Laomo took the cultivator's storage pouch. After a brief hesitation, he vanished.</p><p>Shortly after, the Grand Shaman and Ling Zhuzi arrived.</p><p>Their journey was uneventful, and their expressions were somewhat relaxed.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>The Grand Shaman, polite as ever, bowed to Ling Zhuzi. She activated a jade talisman, about to enter the passage, when her beautiful eyes suddenly shifted, as if she had sensed something. Her lips parted slightly as she transmitted a voice message.</p><p>"Friend, there's a bit more blood than there should be here. It's well-hidden, but it can't escape my eyes… It seems someone wants to challenge the rules set by the human ancestors."</p><p>The Grand Shaman's tone was somewhat gloating.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi's expression darkened, a flash of anger in his eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>Storm Belt.</p><p>Qin Sang, having agreed on terms with Yuan Zhu and made a heart demon oath, flew towards the cave dwelling under Yuan Zhu's spirit's guidance. Yuan Zhu's spirit was sensing its main body's location with all its might, but still had no news, only hoping that the main body would escape danger and still have the strength to avoid being swept away by the hurricane.</p><p>"Since Friend Yuan had already discovered the deception, why didn't you simply leave? Why did you put yourselves in danger by coming to the Seven Killing Hall?"</p><p>Qin Sang flew through the hurricane.</p><p>Curious about Yuan Zhu's predicament, he asked.</p><p>Yuan Zhu sighed. "I only suspected something was wrong with the secret technique, and I was lucky enough to think that our clan wouldn't be so cruel to us. I wanted to confirm it with the Nine Phoenix King personally before I could give up hope. Gu Heng and Cai Feng wouldn't believe me either; I only dared to hint at it a couple of times.  Unexpectedly, they were even more ruthless than I imagined!"</p><p>"Friend Daoist is incredibly resourceful.  When you cast this secret technique, you must have had your doubts.  Why did you agree to be sent to the Canglang Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang pressed further.</p><p>Yuan Zhu sneered.</p><p>"Doubt… Doubt who?"</p><p>"The Jiao Dragon King?"</p><p>"The Jiao Dragon King and those demon kings, to allay our suspicions, and to ensure that those sent out had the ability to complete the mission."</p><p>Most of those chosen were scions of various races, close confidants of demon kings, and even descendants of demon kings. Once they matured, they would become pillars of their respective races.</p><p>“Who would have thought we would be abandoned?”</p><p>“Do you know Gu Heng’s identity? He is the son of the Jiao Dragon King, always favored by the Jiao Dragon King, and has a chance to become the next Jiao Dragon King!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.</p><p>Tigers don't eat their own cubs.</p><p>He could tell that Gu Heng and the other demons were no ordinary beings. He hadn't anticipated their powerful backgrounds, and his understanding of the ruthlessness of those transformed demons deepened.</p><p>He didn't know how many had been sent in.</p><p>What exactly were the demons plotting?</p><p>“Friend, do you mean this conspiracy was launched by the current Jiao Dragon King? What is his purpose? Is it merely to get Jiu Feng Wang into the Seven Killing Hall?”</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his tone persuasive.  “Friend, you’ve been so cruelly wronged. Don't you want to expose their conspiracy and avenge yourself?”</p><p>Yuan Zhu remained unmoved.</p><p>“Exposing their conspiracy, what benefit would that bring to me?</p><p>“I’m fortunate to be alive. Now, I just want to find a way to break free from this imprisonment and continue my cultivation. Even revenge is something I will consider only after my cultivation has improved.</p><p>“Besides, what do I know?</p><p>“Jiu Feng Wang is extremely tight-lipped, only sending a long feather into the immortal array.  He revealed no other information. If I go to human sects, not only will I gain nothing, but I'll also lose my life.</p><p>“You, on the other hand, could report your findings to your sect and possibly gain great merit.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu in turn tried to persuade Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. “I prefer to be a lone wolf; I’m not interested in that.”</p><p>Yuan Zhu was unwilling to come forward; he only had a Xuanjia Talisman, and no other evidence.</p><p>The only force he could contact was the somewhat distant Dongji Alliance.</p><p>To rashly approach higher-ups in other forces, let alone whether they would believe such an absurd story, Qin Sang would have to explain the ins and outs, inevitably exposing the  "Heavenly Demon Transformation Technique," and perhaps even more.</p><p>When the nest falls, the eggs break.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally understood this.</p><p>If it involved the survival of humanity, he would certainly find a way to report it back to the human race as soon as possible.</p><p>Jiu Feng Wang’s secret passage to the Canglang Sea was already so arduous and nearly cost him his life; some minor demons in the inner sea couldn't stir up much trouble for now. He would only consider acting when the time was right.</p><p>Whether the human higher-ups believed him or not was beyond his control.</p>
