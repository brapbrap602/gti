<h1>Chapter 1416 Tombstone</h1><p>Chapter 1416 Tombstone</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Sword after sword, each strike landing in a different spot.  The Yuan Ying spirit puppet didn't give warning, and the Hun Mo elder hadn't arrived yet. Qin Sang, without hesitation, attacked with all his might.</p><p>The purple mist in the medicinal garden surged, strange phenomena appearing frequently. Finally, the purple mist before Qin Sang slowly parted to the sides, revealing a faint golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his spirit sword, gazing intently.  He discovered the golden light was a dome shaped like a Buddhist pagoda, and inside was a spirit tree!</p><p>The dome offered protection, but it had been dimmed significantly by the impact of the fiery aura. Breaking the dome to get the fruit wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>The spirit tree was rooted in a jade altar, the protective power originating from the altar itself. The tree was as tall as three men, yet resembled a withered tree.</p><p>Its bark was dry and charred black. A few leaves clung sparsely to the branches, listless and ash-grey. Only at the very tip of the branches could a precious touch of green be seen, a testament to the tree's tenacious will to live.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it, surprise flashing in his eyes.  Such a near-withered tree had actually borne quite a few fruits!</p><p>Qin Sang remembered what Master Mu had said:  the Wanling fruit tree takes a long time to nurture Wanling fruits, and they are few in number. Spirit insects don't benefit from consuming more fruits; less than four-stage insects should only consume one, while those above four-stage can consume more after digesting the medicinal power.</p><p>There were at least nine fruits on the tree! And they were all ripe. However, the Wanling fruit tree, scorched by the fiery aura, was near-withered, and the Wanling fruits lacked luster.</p><p>“Three spirit insects only need four, more than enough.  Plenty left over.”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected such a large harvest, and was overjoyed.  Without ceremony, he used his sword to break the dim dome, took out nine jade boxes, carefully harvested all the Wanling fruits, and gently patted his Qianjun ring.</p><p>“Didn’t expect it to be so easy.  The Jinghai Sect’s medicinal garden shouldn't only have this Wanling fruit tree, right? Since I’m here, I might as well search around.  Perhaps there’s more that has survived…”</p><p>Qin Sang was about to move when he stopped, carefully studying the Wanling fruit tree, considering whether he could dig up the tree as well.</p><p>The Wanling fruits could enhance the spirit insects, be used to refine Zhenling incense, and might have other uses. He could transplant it back to Qingyang Temple.  Even if he didn’t need it, it could serve as a sect treasure.</p><p>But the Wanling fruit tree was near-withered and very fragile.  Uprooting the tree was different from picking the fruit; it required destroying the entire jade altar.  If he used brute force, Qin Sang worried he might kill the tree. He didn't have time to study any breaking-the-seal methods here.</p><p>“Forget it! If I leave it here, it will only fall into someone else’s hands. Besides, these discoveries have given me a bad feeling. The Jinghai Sect probably won't survive for much longer.”</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision, stared at the jade altar for a moment, and then waved his hand, sending demonic fire to engulf the altar in flames.</p><p>‘Crack…’</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly changed hand seals, the golden light wavering. Cracks appeared in the jade altar as it burned.</p><p>At this moment, a startling sight unfolded. Without warning, the spirit tree's roots suddenly burst into flames, instantly engulfing the entire tree.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly. He used his sword to quickly cut into the shattered jade altar, forcibly digging out a section of the root.</p><p>Fortunately, the root Qin Sang managed to retrieve still retained some vitality. With careful nurturing after he left, it might survive.</p><p>He looked regretfully at the ash-covered tree, his gaze sweeping over the shattered jade altar, thoughtfully.  When he had broken the jade altar, Qin Sang’s feeling was clearer; the affected area seemed larger than just the altar.</p><p>Without time to think further, Qin Sang used a prohibition to seal the root, placing it in a jade box that could preserve its vitality, then left to continue his search.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang discovered another undamaged medicinal field.  The medicinal herbs here were old, but not as precious as he’d expected.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood.  The survival of the medicinal fields seemed to depend on luck. The purple mist prohibitions here were relatively intact, having suffered less impact, allowing them to be preserved.</p><p>He wouldn’t waste his time on these herbs, moving swiftly, breaking through layer upon layer of prohibitions, traversing field after field until he made a new discovery!</p><p>“Spirit Lamp Flowers! Thunder Serpent Vines…”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped abruptly, gazing at the undamaged medicinal field before him, and the brilliant light of the medicinal herbs within, his eyes flashing with excitement.</p><p>These medicinal herbs, protected and cultivated with various prohibitions, were, like the Wanling fruit tree, withered, but a portion had survived. Even some Yuan Ying cultivators would be tempted and unwilling to miss them.</p><p>Qin Sang's attention was caught by a small, jade-cup-shaped flower, about the size of a baby's fist.  He recognized it as a Spirit Lamp Flower, a rare herb used to refine Concealing Fragrance Pills that strengthened the spirit and had some effect even on Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>He was close to breaking through to the second level of the Fire Seed Golden Lotus technique, and the pill would certainly accelerate his progress.  The other herbs were useful, but less important to him than the Spirit Lamp Flower, though other Yuan Ying cultivators might find them highly desirable.  Clearing out all these herbs would make this trip worthwhile, even if he left immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the herbs, marveling at the wealth of the Jing Hai Sect, when his gaze suddenly sharpened, fixating on the depths of the herb garden. Several patches were empty.  The marks weren't from withered plants; they looked freshly dug.</p><p>"No way!"</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted. The marks were recent. Someone had gotten here before him and taken some herbs!</p><p>Qin Sang's mind tensed.  His demonic fire erupted from his sleeve, his consciousness spread, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's divine ability was pushed to its limit.</p><p>"Someone's already here, taking the most precious herbs. Master Mu or the Demon Lord? Why were there no signs before? Where are they now? Have they noticed me?"</p><p>A flood of thoughts raced through his mind.  Then, he sensed an alert from his Yuan Ying puppet outside.</p><p>Through the puppet, Qin Sang 'saw' violent fluctuations above the Jing Hai Sect, followed by a massive explosion. Amidst the chaotic flames, a crack appeared in the spirit array. The Demon Lord and Shi Jie Zhenren flew out, looking slightly disheveled.  Other figures seemed to follow.  The purple flames in the sky were thrown into disarray, temporarily obscuring his view.</p><p>"Not the Demon Lord!"</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed slightly, but his confusion deepened. Had Master Mu beaten him to it? But why hadn't he gone for the Myriad Spirit Fruit?</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the puppet to hide and continued to observe. He took a long look at the herb garden, but didn't try to take any herbs, remaining vigilant, concealing his presence, and slipping into the deep purple mist.</p><p>After an unknown distance, the mist suddenly dissipated, revealing a cliff face. Between the cliff and Qin Sang was a series of rolling hills.  He immediately spotted a solitary tombstone on the open hillside.</p><p>Inscribed on it:</p><p>My younger brother, Tan Jie's tomb.</p>
