<h1>Chapter 1164: Arrangements</h1><p>After untold hardships, the sect leader, usually so composed, wept openly.  Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>“My disciples have made a poor showing. I apologize for any disrespect shown to you, Sect Leader.”</p><p>Mei Gu wiped away her tears.  Her momentary display of girlish vulnerability quickly vanished, replaced by a composed expression.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I recall that when I left, you had only recently reached the Foundation Establishment stage.  I simply laid the groundwork, and yet you've managed to develop the Mo Yan Sect to this extent. It truly exceeds my expectations.”</p><p>“This is not solely my achievement.  Even Lu, before his betrayal, gave his full support.  Zhao’s contributions to the sect were no less than mine.  Our combined efforts, along with a few fortunate encounters, have led us to this point…”</p><p>Mei Gu remained humble, avoiding taking all the credit and specifically highlighting Zhao Shanran’s contributions.  She recounted several events, and seeing Qin Sang’s interest, she briefly described the sect’s history over the past hundred years.</p><p>Qin Sang understood Mei Gu's intentions and said directly, “Those who deserve recognition will receive it. Zhao Shanran, despite his age, shows considerable refinement in his cultivation.  He may yet achieve the Golden Core stage.”</p><p>Mei Gu was overjoyed. “I thank the Sect Leader on behalf of Master Zhao.”</p><p>Qin Sang stopped Mei Gu from bowing, changing the subject. “Let’s leave others aside for now. What are your aspirations for the future?  Your ability to reach the Golden Core stage under these circumstances demonstrates not only your strategic talent but also exceptional aptitude and fortuitous opportunities.”</p><p>“With all due respect, I beseech the Sect Leader, in recognition of my unwavering loyalty to the sect, to guide my cultivation so that I may advance further on the path of immortality! I am willing to relinquish all else, and I beg the Sect Leader to grant my wish!”</p><p>Mei Gu, as if she had anticipated this, responded decisively and without hesitation, kneeling before Qin Sang.</p><p>Previously, she hadn't dared to hope for much progress in her immortal cultivation, intending to dedicate herself entirely to the sect's development.  Qin Sang's appearance had given her a glimmer of hope.  The sect now had the strongest possible backing.  More importantly, the Sect Leader was a Yuan Ying master.  Mei Gu knew this was the greatest opportunity of her life, and she had to seize it.</p><p>“Very well, I accept you as my disciple.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't beat around the bush, readily agreeing. He had a favorable impression of Mei Gu; with her leading, the Mo Yan Sect would be a strong pillar when it became part of the Qing Yang Temple.</p><p>Mei Gu, so unexpected was this turn of events that she thought she misheard, was stunned for a moment before realizing what had happened.</p><p>“Disciple greets Master!”</p><p>Suppressing her overwhelming joy, Mei Gu performed the disciple's bow with precision and respect.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand to help Mei Gu rise, saying seriously, “From this day forward, you are my second disciple. You have other fellow disciples elsewhere, but you cannot meet them yet.”</p><p>Mei Gu looked puzzled.</p><p>Qin Sang paused. “Years ago, I incurred the wrath of a powerful enemy, forcing me to flee.  My enemy is too strong, and I cannot reveal myself openly. I must remain in disguise for now, and you will continue to lead the Mo Yan Sect.  Keep my true cultivation a secret; only you should know.”</p><p>Mei Gu was startled.  Now she understood the Sect Leader’s long absence.  Even more shocking was that their enemy was so formidable that even a Yuan Ying master like the Sect Leader had to proceed with such caution.</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>Mei Gu asked no further questions. The conflicts between Yuan Ying masters were far beyond her scope.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and handed Mei Gu a jade slip. “After leading your disciples to the front lines, deliver this to the Sect Leader of the Yuan Shen Sect.  I have some connection with him, and even though the Yuan Shen Sect is of the righteous path, they can offer you some protection.”</p><p>Mei Gu accepted the jade slip, carefully storing it away, feeling much more reassured.  In the Xiao Han region, despite the differences between the righteous and demonic paths, they always united against external enemies. This confrontation with the Crime Abyss was no exception; both sides were cooperating, and the Yuan Shen Sect leader could help them.  Having a Yuan Ying master’s support would provide significant security.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang gave Mei Gu a mid-grade magic treasure as a reward, offered some personal guidance, once again suppressed his cultivation to the Golden Core stage, and instructed Mei Gu to bring in Zhao Shanran and the others.</p><p>“Greetings to the Sect Leader…”</p><p>Zhao Shanran and the others bowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang addressed Zhao Shanran, saying solemnly, “Mei Gu mentioned your dedication to the sect over the years; you deserve recognition for your hard work.  These two pills can aid in achieving the Nascent Soul stage, a reward for your service.  Refine them diligently, and you still have a chance to reach the Golden Core stage.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang flicked his finger.  A jade bottle containing two Blood Fiend Pills flew towards Zhao Shanran.  Since returning, Qin Sang hadn't sold a single Blood Fiend Pill, keeping them all for himself.</p><p>Zhao Shanran quickly caught the jade bottle, his face flushed with excitement. He knelt and kowtowed, “Disciple Zhao Shanran, I thank the Sect Master. I will dedicate my life to repay the Sect Master’s great kindness.”</p><p>“Rise. Just remember this in your heart. Do not betray the sect in the future, otherwise Lu Xing will be your warning!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s voice turned cold.</p><p>The disciples shivered, repeatedly saying they dared not.</p><p>“And the rest of you, you may also earn this,” Qin Sang looked at the other disciples, “A great war is coming.  As a temporary measure, those at the nascent soul stage may receive one pill each. However, I warn you beforehand, you should first try to form your golden core by yourselves. If you fail, then take the pill. This pill can increase the chance of forming a golden core, but the cost is the lingering of demonic energy. This will not only affect your strength, but also greatly increase the difficulty of future breakthroughs when you encounter bottlenecks in your cultivation.”</p><p>The disciples showed various expressions.</p><p>Zhao Shanran didn't seem to mind; he only cared about forming his golden core, regardless of the cost.</p><p>“This demonic energy is not incurable. Taking some appropriate spiritual herbs can clear it. I will not interfere; whether or not you can find the herbs depends on your own abilities.”</p><p>Qin Sang handed Mei Gu a jade slip containing information on various spiritual herbs.</p><p>These herbs were nearly depleted in the Canglang Sea. They are relatively easy to find in the Xiao Han region, but the price won’t be low.  Consider it a trial for you.</p><p>…</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang stayed at the Moyan Sect, leaving some resources and working with Mei Gu to develop plans for the sect, preparing for its future merger with the Qingyang Temple and joining the righteous path.</p><p>Mei Gu, after learning the truth, showed no resistance, instead rejoicing at the chance to leave the demonic path.</p><p>Soon, the day of departure arrived.</p><p>As previously planned, Zhao Shanran remained behind, while Mei Gu led the other disciples to the front lines.</p><p>Before departure, Qin Sang called Mei Gu and taught her several life-saving techniques.</p><p>“You have another task this time.”</p><p>Qin Sang finally revealed his true purpose.  “Discreetly approach the Qingyang Demon Sect, ideally befriending the old demon’s direct disciple, and find out about the old demon’s temperament and the information regarding the Ancestor Saint Flame…”</p><p>A look of surprise flashed across Mei Gu’s eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang reassured her, “Don't overthink it. My enemy isn't the old demon. The Ancestor Saint Flame is of some use to me. If possible, I hope to make a deal with the old demon. I am too busy to go myself, so you will scout for me first.”</p><p>Mei Gu’s heart eased.  “Disciple obeys!”</p>
