Chapter 679: Flood Dragon Soul


Qin Sang was unaware of the discussions outside, busy with preparations for refining tools in the fire chamber.


For his first attempt, he aimed for a stunning debut. While less critical steps could be completed with the earth fire, the crucial stages required the Nine Nether Demonic Flame to guarantee success.


A fire vein ran through the chamber from underground, invisible on the surface.  In the center was a circular pit, its walls lined with precisely laid square bricks.  Each brick bore the image of a fire phoenix in a unique pose.


Qin Sang recognized at a glance that these images formed a subtle restriction, stabilizing and amplifying the power of the earth fire.


He activated the pit with the talisman given to him by the guard.  A phoenix cry echoed, and the nine phoenixes seemed to come alive, their wings blazing red, spewing intensely hot flames from their beaks – pure earth fire.


Qin Sang's expression turned serious. He selected a few unimportant spirit materials from his Mustard Seed Bag and tested the flames.  He found the earth fire remarkably stable and its activation consumed little of his true essence.


He then paused, spending an entire day in contemplation, strategizing the most efficient use of his materials.


The next day, Qin Sang began work in earnest.  Spirit materials flowed into the earth fire for refinement, then carefully categorized.


Periodically, he interrupted the process to draw out the Ten Yama Banners and refine key materials with the Nine Nether Demonic Flame. When his true essence ran low, he returned to the earth fire, replenishing his reserves.  He worked with meticulous efficiency, maximizing his time.
……
Every evening, Ran Luo visited the fire chamber. The lack of news from within worried her.


"Reporting to Steward Ran, Daoist Qing Feng has not yet emerged, nor has he given us any instructions."


The guards, diligently standing watch, reported to Ran Luo upon her arrival.


Ran Luo nodded. "Continue your vigil.  Inform me immediately of any news from the Daoist."


She turned to leave, but after a few steps, heard a guard exclaim, "The Daoist is out…"


Ran Luo turned back with delight, seeing Qin Sang stride out. "Daoist, have you completed the refining?" she asked eagerly.


Qin Sang smiled. "I have fulfilled my promise.  See for yourself."


With a wave of his hand, five streaks of light shot out, hovering before Ran Luo.  Each streak contained a magic tool: a pair of wings, a bone whip, a strangely shaped small drum, and two sets of armor – one leather, one bone.


All were top-grade magic tools!


Qin Sang had poured his heart and soul into the task, managing to create five top-grade items.


The magic tools used by cultivators of the Vast Ocean were often derived from beast bones and hides, and Qin Sang's creations were no exception.


The wings were primarily forged from the wings of several demon birds. The bone whip came from the flood dragon bone.  The drum, most peculiar, was crafted from the skulls of several demon beasts.  Upon activation, it unleashed spectral beast souls to assault an opponent's mind.


Ran Luo examined each item, praising their quality.  She was finally convinced of Qin Sang’s exceptional skill.


"Ah, I almost forgot to inform Elder Zou."


She quickly sent a message talisman, then returned to admiring the magic tools.


After a moment, a strange look crossed her face.


She noticed that while these five tools were different, all possessing exceptional power, they shared a common trait: a faint, yet potent, icy aura. Such an aura was typical of demonic or ghostly artifacts, seemingly out of place here. Even the fire-imbued wings couldn’t conceal this chill.


Ran Luo glanced at Qin Sang, suspicion rising in her heart.


Qin Sang, noticing her expression, smiled wryly.  He hadn't anticipated that using the Nine Nether Demonic Flame would imbue the tools with its icy aura. This wasn't necessarily detrimental; it could even enhance their power.


However, Qin Sang was troubled. Ran Luo already harbored suspicions about him, and these tools seemed to confirm them.


Fortunately, sectarianism wasn't as strong in the Vast Ocean.  If the Radiant Jade Chamber rejected him, so be it.  There were other opportunities.


Qin Sang tossed his Mustard Seed Bag to Ran Luo. "These are the remaining tools refined from the leftover materials.  Their quality varies. Take them."


Ran Luo had regained her composure. It seemed she had reached a conclusion: regardless of Qin Sang's origins, his refining skills were undeniable.


Soon after, Elder Zou and others arrived. Witnessing the five top-grade magic tools, all doubts vanished.  Even the young man surnamed Zhuo offered Qin Sang a respectful bow, seemingly convinced.


"Daoist Qing Feng, as the chief steward of the Radiant Jade Chamber, I invite you to become our Outer Sea Guest Elder. With this token, you may access the chamber's resources in both the inner and outer seas."


Elder Zou acted decisively, bestowing Qin Sang with a token of his new position.


"Daoist, you are now one of us. Please, state any requests you may have."


Qin Sang examined the token. His position seemed quite influential, granting him access to Radiant Jade resources and even potential aid from the entire Eastern Pole Alliance in times of crisis.  In return, he only needed to fulfill his refining duties.


"Since you ask, Elder Zou, I will be frank.  Refining is a secondary pursuit. My primary focus is cultivating my own power.  My cultivation technique requires periodic demon hunting expeditions.  I cannot remain on the island indefinitely."


Elder Zou readily agreed, promising access to chamber resources to ensure Qin Sang's safety during his hunts.


Qin Sang made a few more requests, all granted by Elder Zou.


Finally, Qin Sang, seeing no reason not to take advantage of the situation, said, "The chamber has acquired so many demon corpses.  It seems I'll be busy on Douyan Island for quite some time. I urgently require eight Flood Dragon souls at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage, extracted from living creatures. Does the chamber have a way to gather these quickly?"


Ran Luo considered this. "Even refining high-quality Demon Slaying Pills requires demon souls.  The Daoist also requires live capture of peak Nascent Soul Flood Dragons. I'm afraid that will be difficult. I will do my best to collect them."


Qin Sang bowed.  "Thank you for your efforts, Daoist Ran.  If gathering them proves too difficult, could you perhaps inform me of any nearby Flood Dragon sightings?  I wouldn't mind hunting them myself."
