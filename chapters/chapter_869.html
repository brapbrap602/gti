<h1>Chapter 861: Dragon Hunt</h1><p>Chapter 861: Dragon Hunt</p><p>The Kui Dragon is not a true dragon, but a beast resembling a dragon, with dragon-like features and a human face.</p><p>However, according to the young man surnamed Fang, this Kui Dragon only possesses a fraction of the beast's bloodline.  Its form is somewhat similar to a Jiao dragon, possessing a single leg on its abdomen, dancing with thunder, seemingly moving within lightning.</p><p>Whenever there's a thunderstorm, the Kui Dragon leaves its lair to absorb the power of the thunder.</p><p>The crystalline stele of the Heavenly Cold Wind Formation is refined using the Qi of the Cold Cauldron, with layers upon layers of formations, evolving extreme cold Yin Qi, precisely capable of counteracting the Kui Dragon's abilities.</p><p>"This Kui Dragon hides so close to Tianxing Island, quite bold. I haven't heard anyone mention a large demon's presence nearby before."</p><p>Qiu Ji has wide connections and many friends.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang's eyes flashed. He said, "That's hard to say. This area of the sea is exceptionally barren; cultivators rarely come here, so it's possible no one has seen it.  Furthermore, that beast is quite cunning; its appearances are brief, only leaving its lair at the peak of the thunder's power to devour it before immediately returning. No one noticing it is not surprising. Therefore, the window to hunt it is very short…"</p><p>As they spoke, the dark clouds above thickened.</p><p>The sky seemed to have a hole in it, as torrential rain poured down.</p><p>The wind howled, rain lashed down, and thunder rumbled.</p><p>Lightning flashed across the vast sea, illuminating the rainy night.</p><p>They channeled their True Essence to create protective shields, standing atop the mountain, gazing toward the Kui Dragon's lair.</p><p>Initially, it looked no different from any other place.</p><p>But upon closer inspection, one could see that lightning strikes from that direction were denser and more powerful than elsewhere.</p><p>The Kui Dragon's lair was still hundreds of miles away; their view was not clear.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang waved his hand, and without a word, the group flew towards the lair.</p><p>To avoid being detected, after leaving the island, they concealed their auras and figures, flying close to the sea's surface, silently moving through the storm.</p><p>Near the beast's lair, the phenomenon became clearer.</p><p>A shadow emerged from the distant sea – an island.  Though still far away, under the illumination of the lightning, they could vaguely see the highest peak on the island.</p><p>Whether due to the terrain or something else, the lightning in this area seemed to be guided, mostly striking the island's center.</p><p>As they neared the lair, the young man surnamed Fang raised his hand to stop them, his eyes sharp, intently staring ahead. He transmitted, "The lightning isn't at its most intense yet; the beast shouldn't have appeared. Prepare the spirit array; I'll scout the beast's movements. Wait for my signal…"</p><p>"Hold on, Fang. We're about to slay the Kui Dragon. Shouldn't you fulfill your promise regarding the treasures?"</p><p>Ma Debao stopped the young man surnamed Fang, his expression shrewd.</p><p>Others echoed his words.</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang turned, surveying them, and smiled. "How could Fang break his word? The treasures are ready."</p><p>With that, the young man surnamed Fang produced five jade boxes and tossed them.</p><p>Qin Sang caught the box flying towards him. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed abundant spiritual Qi – a water-type spirit stone, common in the Canglang Sea – half the payment.</p><p>He silently put the box into his storage ring, without checking what the others received. Some of Ma Debao and the others were expressionless, others delighted, indicating they were satisfied with their treasures.</p><p>"Fang will proceed first…"</p><p>Leaving this, the young man surnamed Fang melted into the storm.</p><p>Watching his back, Qin Sang and the others immediately produced the crystalline stele and infused it with True Essence.</p><p>Using the storm and waves as cover, the stele glowed faintly blue, gradually growing larger in their hands, until it reached three feet in height and became incredibly heavy, requiring their full strength to support.</p><p>With Chu Heng as the focal point, the five took their positions, their spiritual senses activating the stele. A spirit array slowly formed, creating a blue mist between them, gradually turning pale.</p><p>As they prepared the array, the young man surnamed Fang neared the island.</p><p>He took out a piece of red gauze from his bosom.  The silken threads were as luminous as jade, the gauze itself as thin as a cicada's wing, only the size of a palm, with a clear tear at the edge.</p><p>This was the Red Yuan Gauze, bestowed by their master to conceal their identities.</p><p>A young man surnamed Fang pointed at the crimson silk.  A red glow pulsed within the treasure, and the silk expanded, transforming into a gossamer robe.  </p><p>Simultaneously, more cracks appeared on the artifact.</p><p>A look of regret crossed Fang’s face. He murmured, “Each time I fully unleash this treasure's power, it suffers irreversible damage. I doubt I can use it more than twice. Without it, I can't move freely in human territory. This has to succeed.”</p><p>He donned the robe, his aura completely vanishing. He then flew to the island, landing atop a mountain peak to observe the area where the lightning struck. The spectacle was impressive, but no beast appeared.</p><p>“The Kui Dragon hasn’t emerged yet?”</p><p>Fang frowned.</p><p>He sensed something, abruptly looking up at the storm clouds.  Then, in a flash, he vanished. Soon after, the clouds churned, and a slender shadow chased the lightning through the clouds, heading straight for the island.</p><p>“Finally!”</p><p>Floating on the sea, Fang watched the shadow, a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.  He circled the Kui Dragon, flying behind it, searching for something.</p><p>“Only the Kui Dragon… those others haven’t shown themselves…”</p><p>He seemed to have anticipated this, but out of caution, he circled again.</p><p>The Kui Dragon reached the island, its immense body surprisingly agile as it descended on the lightning, landing in the most intense area.</p><p>Fang glanced at the island, then lunged towards it, flicking his fingers. Two dark beams shot into the sea. One flew toward Qin Sang and the others, while the other went to an unknown location.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Approaching Fang, the Kui Dragon sensed the intrusion and roared in warning.</p><p>In the rain-lashed night, the Kui Dragon stood on a mountain peak, its massive eyes shone like lightning, brimming with terrifying ferocity.</p><p>Undeterred, Fang removed the crimson silk, a golden light appearing in his palm—a golden rope-like artifact.</p><p>“Die, beast!”</p><p>Fang roared, soaring towards the Kui Dragon. He swung his arm, the golden lock's light intensified, transforming into a giant serpent that lashed out at the Kui Dragon.</p><p>The Kui Dragon exploded in fury.</p><p>With a thunderous boom, the mountaintop rocks shattered, the ground trembling violently.</p>
