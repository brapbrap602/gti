<h1>Chapter 1386: The Man in the Snow</h1><p>The winds and waves here are almost constant.</p><p>The island lacks tall ancient trees; even shrubs are rare.</p><p>Something, perhaps moss or algae, covers the rocks in a dark green, almost black hue, making the whole island seem dim and desolate.</p><p>There’s nothing obviously remarkable about this barren isle.</p><p>Qin Sang followed Bi Fang, flying towards the island.  She quickly scanned it, finding no trace of spirit arrays or restrictions.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine what treasure could be hidden here.</p><p>“A perfect place to escape after getting the treasure…”</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the island’s surroundings, thinking to herself.</p><p>Based on her experience, this place is very close to the storm belt. Once she enters the heart of the storm, her pursuers, fearing they might lose their way, won't dare to pursue her relentlessly.</p><p>…</p><p>On the island.</p><p>The Wind Master could only disperse his spiritual sense, searching blindly.</p><p>The various demon kings, guided by the Rainbow Rat, easily located the hiding place of the Xuan Tian Palace traitor.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The demon kings feigned disinterest, creating a diversion.  But when the Wind Master and the others showed uncertainty, their escape lights suddenly changed direction, swiftly and unexpectedly attacking the northern part of the island, a stony mountain area!</p><p>The stone mountains were jagged and rough, with exposed rocks everywhere.</p><p>These rocks formed several mountain ranges, but their layout was unusually chaotic and difficult to discern.</p><p>Their target seemed to be a deep valley in the middle of the stone mountains.</p><p>On both sides of the valley, countless protruding rocks, jagged and interlocking, almost completely covered the valley entrance. The interior was pitch-black, impossible to see even a hand's length away.</p><p>Seeing this, the Wind Master realized that the Xuan Tian Palace traitor was hiding within the valley.</p><p>He coldly snorted in annoyance. He had just used his spiritual sense to search that area and had detected nothing unusual. No wonder the traitor had been able to escape for so long; they certainly had some tricks up their sleeves.</p><p>Without hesitation, the Wind Master flickered, transforming into a wisp of green smoke, and rushed towards the valley at an even faster speed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the demon kings in mid-air suddenly split up.</p><p>The Frog Fish and the Sly Fox demons continued forward, one after the other.</p><p>The Eagle demon and the Green Snake demon, however, reversed course to intercept the Wind Master.</p><p>At that moment, the Rainbow Rat leaped from the Eagle demon’s back, escaping the battlefield early.</p><p>Still weak, it dared not participate in the fight.</p><p>The battlefield was chaotic and dangerous. The treasure was about to be obtained; getting injured or killed now would be a bad deal.</p><p>The Rainbow Rat, despite its round body, was remarkably agile.  It lightly landed on the ground, its tiny eyes darting around, scanning the battlefield, before twisting its body and slipping into a rock crevice, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The two demon kings blocked his path, but the Wind Master showed no fear, roaring with anger, full of arrogance.</p><p>Seeing the Wind Master's arrogance, the Green Snake demon felt displeasure, emitting a crisp hum.  Its slender waist swayed slightly, and its body suddenly swelled.</p><p>In an instant, the Green Snake transformed into a hundred-zhang long giant python.  Its body, comparable to a dragon, cast a huge shadow on the ground. Its upper body reared high, its cold eyes looking down at the Wind Master. Its vertical pupils shot out two sword-like beams of green light, and simultaneously, its tail lashed out, creating a gust of wind that struck at the Wind Master.</p><p>The Eagle demon was no slower.</p><p>Its wings spread wide, like dark clouds hanging in the sky, its sharp claws gleaming, sharper than any blade.</p><p>Undoubtedly, if caught by these claws, the victim would be disemboweled instantly.</p><p>The two great demons were incredibly ferocious and coordinated perfectly.</p><p>They attacked the Wind Master together!</p><p>Compared to them, the Wind Master appeared so frail.</p><p>Surprisingly,</p><p>the Wind Master seemed not to notice the two demons' attack; his figure, like smoke, continued undeterred.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The claws, swift as lightning, easily tore through the smoke.</p><p>The Eagle demon, somewhat surprised by its success, just as a hint of joy flashed in its eyes, suddenly froze.</p><p>An unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>After passing through the gap between the claws, the green smoke suddenly coalesced, and the Wind Master was unharmed!</p><p>But the crisis was far from over.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The snake's tail followed, plowing a deep furrow in the ground, sending rocks flying.</p><p>The green smoke suddenly rose upwards.</p><p>At that moment, not only did the Wind Master narrowly avoid the snake's tail, but a green light erupted from his body, revealing the vague shadow of an ancient mirror, which reflected the Green Snake's two beams of light back at it.</p><p>A green serpent whipped its head, its body smashing into a mountain, crushing countless rocks.  The mountain trembled. A tremendous roar mixed with a scream.  Even so, it failed to completely evade the attack; its cry was shrill. Blood flowed from its eyes, a clear sign of backlash.  However, this attack couldn't harm the demon king's core.</p><p>The green serpent immediately regrouped, attempting to stop Feng Shangshi, but it was too late.  All this happened incredibly fast. In an instant, Feng Shangshi moved with lightning speed, easily breaking through the two demon kings' blockade. His skill and evasion were astonishing.</p><p>The two demon kings stared at each other, the same question forming in their minds—what kind of evasion technique was that? It resembled Wind Escape, but it wasn't quite the same. Wind Escape and Thunder Escape are equally famous; while not as fast as Thunder Escape, it’s more flexible and unpredictable. Feng Shangshi’s technique possessed a certain quality of Wind Escape; even if not true Wind Escape, it was a superior ability.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Bifang pursued their target, arriving above a deserted island. It was unclear how the demon kings communicated.  The eagle and snake demon kings immediately decided to abandon Feng Shangshi and jointly attacked Shen Daozhu and his two companions, who were following closely behind.  Although outnumbered three to two by fellow Yuan Ying cultivators, they could stall them for a while—not everyone possesses Feng Shangshi's strange evasion technique.</p><p>Bifang completely ignored this battle, its fierce eyes fixed on Feng Shangshi. Transforming into a bloody rainbow, it dived downwards!</p><p>“Daoist Mingyue, quickly stop it!” Qin Sang arrived, hearing Madam Yue's urgent cry. Feng Shangshi could outmaneuver the lower-cultivation eagle and snake demons, but against his old nemesis Bifang, he wouldn't be able to escape so easily. The Xuan Tian Palace traitor was seriously injured. If Bifang could hold Feng Shangshi for a moment,  the frog, fish, and fox could kill him and seize the treasure. By then, it would be too late!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the deep valley, coldly saying, “Daoist Yue, won't you tell me the truth yet?”</p><p>“Yes…” Madam Yue was about to offer a prepared excuse.</p><p>At that moment, a sudden change occurred in the deep valley!  A cold wind surged from the valley. Snow fell from the sky. In an instant, a biting chill spread through the surrounding mountains, coating the dark rocks with a thin layer of frost. Wind and snow howled. A man in white clothes flew out of the valley, appearing before everyone.  This man was handsome and refined, his cultivation—that of a Yuan Ying cultivator—undisguised. His face was pale and bloodless, his skin almost transparent, his flesh seeming to be composed of dark ice. He appeared weak and frail, yet strangely, his aura remained powerful, not like someone seriously injured.</p>
