<h1></h1><p>Outside the tomb chamber, the fluctuations of the restrictive spells grew increasingly violent.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to catch up.</p><p>Elder Yanshan dared not hesitate. He flashed to the edge of the spirit array, glanced over it, then raised his palm. Silver light flickered in his palm as he directed a stream of Primordial Heavy Water toward the array.</p><p>This array's purpose was to extract the chilling Yin energy from the ice disc, sustaining the operation of the false tomb above. It wasn't specifically designed to protect the ice disc.</p><p>However, Elder Yanshan's attempt to directly seize the ice disc still triggered the spirit array's defenses.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Primordial Heavy Water pierced through the spirit array's outer spiritual light, forcibly disrupting it.</p><p>Layers of cold light rippled within the spirit array, causing the ice disc to tremble slightly. The array's formation shifted dramatically, the chilling Yin energy instantly condensing into a crescent-shaped ice blade that vanished in a flash.</p><p>The ice blade hadn't disappeared; its speed was simply too extreme. Its target: Elder Yanshan.</p><p>A chill ran down Elder Yanshan's spine. Without hesitation, he shifted several zhang away, leaving behind an afterimage that was instantly pierced by the ice blade.  A moment slower, and a gaping wound would have appeared in his chest.</p><p>Even so, the ice blade grazed his left shoulder. His protective True Essence proved utterly ineffective, pierced with ease.</p><p>Before the blood could flow, it froze, a layer of thin ice covering his shoulder and continuing to spread.</p><p>Elder Yanshan hastily circulated his True Essence, forcing out the invasive cold.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ice blade shattered mid-air, reverting to pure chilling Yin energy that returned to the spirit array, resuming its cycle.</p><p>Elder Yanshan stared at the remnants of the ice blade, cold sweat dripping down his face.</p><p>Even within his tomb chamber, the Water Aspect Master had set traps. If he were a true Water Aspect inheritor, breaking the spirit array and retrieving the ice disc wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>But he was barely a half-inheritor, having learned only the surface level of the arts.</p><p>Though he had ways to forcibly break the array, it would require time he didn't have. The pursuers were closing in; his time was running out.</p><p>Even Luye wasn't a match for them.  Elder Yanshan alone dared not linger in the tomb chamber.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The tomb chamber suddenly shook violently.</p><p>Elder Yanshan glanced back, seeing with his naked eyes the chaotic light and shadow cast by the collapsing restrictive spells.</p><p>Forcibly taking the ice disc would not only mean failing to obtain the treasure but also losing his life!</p><p>He returned his gaze to the ice disc, his heart aching with regret.  With a final sigh, he beckoned back the Primordial Heavy Water, decisively abandoning the ice disc.  He bypassed the spirit array and moved towards the jade boxes on the ice bed.</p><p>While the jade boxes also had seals, they were far easier to break.</p><p>Employing an unknown technique, Elder Yanshan closed and opened his eyes. They transformed into deep, dark pools, his gaze profound. He quickly scanned the three jade boxes, locking onto the middle one.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Primordial Heavy Water flew from his hand, expanding into a thin film of water that covered the middle jade box.</p><p>The ice bed trembled, an intense blue light erupting from within.</p><p>The tomb chamber was bathed in azure light.</p><p>Unaffected, Elder Yanshan's fingers moved like a spinning wheel, swiftly completing the hand seals.  He uttered a low shout, "Open!"</p><p>The Primordial Heavy Water rapidly contracted, tightly enveloping the jade box. With a 'crack,' the seal on the jade box shattered. It detached from the ice bed and flew into Elder Yanshan's hand.</p><p>Without pausing to examine it, he repeated the process, retrieving the second jade box.</p><p>Just as he was about to unseal and take the third jade box,</p><p>a thunderous roar came from outside the tomb chamber.</p><p>Countless fragments of restrictive spells rained down like shards of glass. Two powerful auras surged downwards, their vague silhouettes reflected on the icy floor.</p><p>Sensing the change, Elder Yanshan didn't look back. He leaped to the back of the tomb chamber, raising his right hand. He hurriedly pressed the circular mirror, which he had been clutching in his palm, against the wall.</p><p>The mirror vanished, leaving behind a man-sized circular pattern on the wall.  Water rippled within, resembling a watery portal. The wall appeared to have gained a well.</p><p>Only, this well stood vertically, its depths unfathomable, leading to an unknown destination.</p><p>Elder Yanshan lunged forward, entering the watery portal.  Half his body disappeared, his right hand grasping at the air, the Primordial Heavy Water on the verge of breaking the third seal.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang, having broken through layers of restrictive spells, finally laid eyes on the Water Aspect Master's tomb chamber!</p><p>The restrictive spells outside the chamber were incredibly intricate. Without Elder Yanshan paving the way, entering would have taken considerable effort.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang landed on solid ground. Before he could steady himself, his gaze swept across the tomb. He saw Elder Yanshan about to escape, then his expression shifted, a cry of surprise escaping his lips, "The Thousandfold Mirror!"</p><p>It wasn't the jade boxes that caught his attention, but the watery portal on the wall!</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, hastily urging his divine sense to cast the fastest-acting Soul Seizing Mantra.</p><p>Elder Yanshan heard two strange 'hum-ha' sounds and felt a stinging pain in his primordial spirit. His face paled slightly. He was, after all, a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, and he endured the pain. However, the Primordial Heavy Water faltered, failing to retrieve the third jade box in time.</p><p>Simultaneously, the tomb chamber was illuminated by the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>The sword light was dazzling.</p><p>The sword flashed like lightning!</p><p>Its target was not Elder Yanshan, but the watery portal on the wall!</p><p>Elder Yanshan's face was drained of color. He hastily retrieved the Primordial Heavy Water and plunged into the portal. After his figure vanished, the portal shrank rapidly, in an instant reduced to a single blue point of light.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword struck the point of light, but it was too late. The tomb chamber was empty.</p><p>Within the snowy plains,</p><p>amongst the crisscrossing ravines, a row of stone walls simultaneously glowed with an ethereal blue light.  Mirror-like surfaces materialized, embedded within the stone walls, reflecting each other into the distance beyond the snowy plains.</p><p>A white shadow flickered and leaped between the countless mirrors.  Each mirror vanished without a trace after the shadow passed through it.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the figure traversed the ravines, appearing at the edge of the snowy plains.  It was Elder Yanshan.</p><p>‘Stagger… stagger… stagger…’</p><p>Elder Yanshan materialized, rushing forward a few steps before stumbling to a stop.</p><p>His breath was ragged.  Recalling the perilous encounter, he raised his right hand. Seeing a clear sword mark on the surface of the precious mirror, nearly piercing through the treasure, he couldn't help but draw a sharp breath.</p><p>Storing the mirror, Elder Yanshan casually retrieved his spoils, his gaze falling on the first jade box. He eagerly opened it.</p><p>‘Click!’</p><p>Inside the jade box lay a single item: a token.</p><p>This token was strikingly similar to the strange-faced man's, differing only in some of the markings and inscriptions.  This token was engraved with the character 'Water,' while the strange-faced man's bore the character 'Wood'!</p><p>Holding the token, Elder Yanshan's frustration over losing the ice disc lessened somewhat. A satisfied smile spread across his face.  Only then did he remember that this place wasn't safe. He quickly stored the treasures and stealthily departed.</p><p>Within the tomb chamber,</p><p>Qin Sang, having failed to detain Elder Yanshan, stared at the wall, which had returned to its original state, a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>He recognized the treasure Elder Yanshan used to escape. He had once encountered records of such a treasure.</p><p>However, not in the Central Continent, but in the North Sea.</p><p>Years ago, while gathering information about Xiao Xiangzi in the North Sea, Qin Sang had also investigated the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Coincidentally, the disciple of Old Devil Hun had offered up his soul. Through soul searching, Qin Sang learned of a connection between Nine Rings Island and the Pure Sea Sect.  He personally visited and subdued the forces of Nine Rings Island.</p><p>From the classics left by True Person Nine Rings, he had gleaned some information.</p><p>Amongst it was a record of this treasure, known as the Thousandfold Mirror.</p><p>This treasure was unparalleled for escape.  Seeing Elder Yanshan use the Thousandfold Mirror, Qin Sang hadn't even considered pursuing him.</p><p>Its only drawback was the need for prior preparation.</p><p>Elder Yanshan had been cautious; neither his avatar nor the Heaven's Eye Butterfly had detected his subtle actions.</p><p>True Person Nine Rings had discovered the remains of a Pure Sea Sect monk, obtaining his relics, including a damaged Thousandfold Mirror. He didn't understand the refining method and couldn't repair it. After using it twice, the Thousandfold Mirror had completely shattered.</p><p>The Pure Sea Sect was founded by Xiao Xiangzi, its heritage passed down by him.</p><p>Elder Yanshan also possessed a Thousandfold Mirror.</p><p>Elder Yanshan had received the Water Aspect inheritance of the Formless Immortal Sect, making him a half-inheritor.  The Thousandfold Mirror likely originated from the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>It was a pity he had fallen out with Elder Yanshan.  The man wouldn't answer his questions now.</p><p>Even if Xiao Xiangzi wasn't from the Formless Immortal Sect, he had a deep connection to it!</p><p>Thinking further, could the two Killing Swords also be from the Formless Immortal Sect?</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of excitement.  His avatar had traveled for years, investigating everywhere without results.  He hadn't expected this trip to the Northern Wastelands to yield such unexpected gains.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang knew it was too early to celebrate.</p><p>If Xiao Xiangzi was from the Formless Immortal Sect, with his loyal and righteous nature, he hadn't forgotten the Xie Family in his letter.  Why not mention the Formless Immortal Sect?</p><p>And the Formless Immortal Sect had long since vanished from the cultivation world.</p><p>Finding descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect wouldn't be easy.</p><p>While his main body pondered, his avatar remained busy.</p><p>Only the last jade box remained on the ice bed.</p><p>With the seal mostly broken by Elder Yanshan, the avatar easily retrieved the jade box and tossed it to his main body.</p><p>Opening it, Qin Sang saw two medicinal pills inside.</p><p>Unmarked, their purpose unknown.</p><p>The pills were perfectly round and snow-white, without a single blemish.  A faint, elegant fragrance drifted to his nose.  Qin Sang sniffed lightly and felt a refreshing coolness permeate his body, extremely comfortable.</p><p>"It doesn't smell like a poison pill.  I wonder what its effects are…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly.</p><p>He knew little about alchemy and couldn't make a judgment.</p><p>Relics of the Water Aspect Master were undoubtedly valuable.</p><p>There were only two pills.  Having his avatar test them would be a waste if they didn't enhance cultivation.  He would continue investigating the Formless Immortal Sect; there would be opportunities in the future.</p><p>Qin Sang temporarily stored the pills with the Truth-Keeping Pills, then looked up at the writing on the wall, his expression gradually turning grave.</p><p>From these words, Qin Sang could sense the Water Aspect Master's intense resentment.</p><p>Most of it was directed at two individuals, accusing them of betrayal and taking advantage of his vulnerability to attack him.</p><p>One was named Huang Xi, the other Liao Su.</p><p>"Liao Su…"</p><p>"Liao Su…"</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow.  He seemed to have heard this name.  Racking his brain, he finally recalled that a Patriarch of the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery had the Dharma name Master Liao Su!</p><p>Master Liao Su was incredibly powerful, the figure who revitalized the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery, establishing an unparalleled legacy. It was said he even played a role in shaping the current landscape of the Central Continent.</p><p>"If it truly is Master Liao Su, could the other, Huang Xi, be the Patriarch of the Eight Scenery Pavilion…?"</p><p>Qin Sang felt he had stumbled upon a hidden secret of the Central Continent.</p><p>His gaze fell upon the final line of writing --  He who inherits my mantle shall slaughter Buddha and extinguish the Dao!</p><p>The hatred was palpable.</p><p>The killing intent, overwhelming!</p><p>It was a pity that despite all the Water Aspect Master's preparations, a true Water Aspect inheritor never appeared. Qin Sang wouldn't follow his command, and Elder Yanshan hadn't even glanced at it.</p><p>No wonder the Formless Immortal Sect seemed to have been deliberately concealed.  He hadn't been able to find any useful information before.  If the Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery were behind it, everything made sense.</p><p>What roles did the Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery play in the downfall of the Formless Immortal Sect?</p><p>Perhaps they rose to prominence by stepping on the Formless Immortal Sect's corpse.</p><p>Their actions were likely unsavory, which was why they wanted to eradicate the Formless Immortal Sect completely, as if wiping it from the cultivation world's memory.</p><p>If no one remembered the Formless Immortal Sect, no one would discuss the past.</p><p>Realizing this, Qin Sang understood.</p><p>He couldn't openly investigate the Formless Immortal Sect, lest he attract the attention of the Eight Scenery Pavilion and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery.</p><p>Conversely, they were the ones who knew the Formless Immortal Sect best.  When he couldn't find any useful information through other channels, he would still need to interact with them.</p><p>He would need to verify this information upon his return.</p><p>His main body turned towards the ice disc.</p><p>This was the only unusual object remaining in the tomb chamber. The ice bed was just ordinary Profound Ice, made to appear extraordinary by the Water Aspect Master's restrictive spells.</p><p>His avatar hadn't been idle, working with the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to decipher the patterns of the spirit array.</p><p>‘Swish, swish, swish…’</p><p>His main body summoned the Nine Nether Devil Fire, condensing it into dozens of thumb-thick fiery ropes. They shot towards the eight corners of the spirit array like scattered flowers, piercing the surface spiritual light and churning wildly within the array.</p><p>The same scene replayed.</p><p>Chilling Yin energy coalesced into an ice blade.</p><p>However, before the ice blade fully formed, Qin Sang had already activated his Phoenix Wings, flashing to the other side of the tomb chamber, leaving behind a residual image.</p><p>The spirit array's counterattack had no effect on him.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>His avatar seized the opportunity, cleaving the spirit array with his saber. He reached inside and firmly grasped the ice disc, pulling it out.</p><p>Losing the support of the ice disc, the spirit array abruptly dimmed, its energy collapsing.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly praised, "Such pure chilling Yin energy!  So this treasure is the source! With this, cultivating the Ice Soul Divine Light will be a simple matter…"</p><p>The threat of Luye remained; he couldn't stay here long.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't waste time examining it closely.  He stored the ice disc, his second Nascent Soul returning to his main body. He flashed out of the tomb chamber, then abruptly stopped, turning back and commanding his sword.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A thick sword beam pierced through the tomb chamber. The chamber's already weakened restrictive spells finally gave way, collapsing. All traces were erased.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the crevice on his sword.  Confirming there were no powerful enemies outside, he concealed his aura and stealthily departed under the cover of the snow.</p><p>Not long after Qin Sang's departure,</p><p>Su Zinan, following the trail, arrived at the false tomb.  He found only two patches of ruins, completely deserted. The treasures within had long been plundered.</p><p>He spread his divine sense, discovering some clues, but the trail went cold not far away.</p><p>Su Zinan snorted.  He hadn't spent much time dealing with Old Man Wu. These people were much faster than he anticipated.</p><p>However, he didn't regret it. The Three Corpses Soul-Reaping Banner was paramount.  Sacrificing a late-stage Nascent Soul to create the banner was the best possible start.</p><p>"Who was that guy? The current Fire Aspect Master?"</p><p>Su Zinan, through the evil banner, knew the details of the battle between Old Man Wu and Qin Sang.</p><p>He wandered the snowy plains, finding nothing.</p><p>Elsewhere,</p><p>Qin Sang returned the way he came, rushing back to Elder Yanshan's cultivation grounds with the utmost speed.</p><p>As expected,</p><p>Elder Yanshan hadn't returned.  Such cultivation grounds were easily abandoned.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the mountains briefly, not lingering, then turned and headed home.</p>
