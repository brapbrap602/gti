<h1>Chapter 1870: A Scale and a Claw</h1><p>Wind and sand swept across the battlefield.</p><p>The roars of combat vanished. Cultivators and demon cultivators alike stared at the sky, their faces etched with shock.</p><p>Boundless dark clouds spread from the southeast, turning day into night.  A golden light within the inky depths drew all eyes.</p><p>Within the golden light, a dragon-like figure seemed to ride the clouds, approaching.  As the cultivators caught sight of the radiance, golden clouds filled the sky above the battlefield.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Both demon and human cultivators felt a world-shaking pressure descend upon them.</p><p>Those with weaker cultivation bases reeled under the terrifying pressure.  Their hearts pounded, then faltered, their minds reeling as they coughed up blood.</p><p>Those who had formed battle formations joined forces to resist, barely managing to steady themselves. Yet, their faces were pale, their eyes filled with terror.</p><p>Among them were seasoned veterans of the Yellow Springs Path, who had witnessed the awe-inspiring might of Grandmasters and Demon Kings clashing.  But this power was on a different level entirely, beyond comparison.</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>“A Great Sage?”</p><p>…</p><p>The Daoist battle formation crumbled, its foundation shaken, not by force, but by fear.</p><p>The Daoists and the Ghost Fang Kingdom had been locked in endless conflict along the Yellow Springs Path, their battles typically involving Grandmasters and Demon Kings.</p><p>Grand Sovereigns and Great Sages were names whispered in hushed tones, figures of legend.</p><p>Every cultivator understood: if Grand Sovereigns and Great Sages personally joined the fray, the situation would become irrecoverable. The fate of Mount Juzhi would hang by a thread.</p><p>Even before the Great Sage's true form was revealed, the battlefield descended into chaos, though the pressure wasn’t directed at them.</p><p>In an instant, the dark clouds engulfed the Ritual Platform. The multicolored auspicious clouds above it were shrouded, their light dimmed.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>From within the dark clouds, a golden ray suddenly shot downwards.</p><p>…</p><p>White Stone Prefecture.</p><p>A mountain peak within the Ritual Platform.</p><p>This mountain was the highest peak of White Stone Prefecture, but it was concealed by the grand formation of the Ritual Platform, invisible to ordinary eyes.</p><p>Unlike other places, there were no golden palaces on this mountain. It was exceptionally beautiful and serene, a scene of natural wonder.</p><p>At the summit were groves of purple bamboo.  Within the groves, several bamboo halls had been built, their doors tightly shut, the surroundings deserted.</p><p>As the drumbeats sounded, a door suddenly opened.</p><p>‘Creak!’</p><p>No one emerged.</p><p>Inside the hall, an incense burner held burning spirit incense.  On a meditation cushion sat a woman in moon-white Daoist robes. Her aura was faint, almost nonexistent.  Her face was uncovered, yet a strange sense of obscurity surrounded her.</p><p>Those who saw her wouldn't find her exceptionally beautiful, nor would they find her ugly.  They would simply forget her appearance in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Her eyes were closed, deep in meditation.</p><p>The drumbeats reached her ears.</p><p>Her eyelids twitched slightly, but her expression remained unchanged.</p><p>A soft sigh echoed within the bamboo hall.  A streak of red light shot out the door, piercing the sky, heading straight for the Ritual Platform of Mount Juzhi.</p><p>Its true form was a thumb-sized bronze bell, a red ribbon tied to its loop.</p><p>The bell's speed rivaled the Great Sage's, crossing mountains and rivers in an instant.  But its movement was far less conspicuous.  To any observer, it would appear as a peculiar shooting star.</p><p>…</p><p>Central Abundance Prefecture.</p><p>The layout of this Prefecture’s Ritual Platform differed greatly from White Stone Prefecture’s.  Eight smaller formations linked together, forming a larger formation. These were the official residences of the various departments of the Heavenly Hub Institute, surrounding a mountain peak that wasn't particularly tall.</p><p>Golden palaces, resplendent and magnificent, adorned the mountain.</p><p>At the highest point stood the grandest palace of all. A golden bell hung beside its entrance.</p><p>At this moment, the golden bell rang of its own accord, its sound echoing only around the palace.</p><p>Spiritual energy converged above the palace, forming an illusory image of a gaunt Daoist.</p><p>The Daoist stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing north, a contemplative look on his face. He glanced towards White Stone Prefecture, then raised his right index finger, pointing remotely towards the Ritual Platform of Mount Juzhi.</p><p>The next moment, his figure faded, disappearing completely, yet his posture remained frozen in the air.</p><p>…</p><p>Golden light descended from the heavens.</p><p>Blindingly bright, it was a dragon's tail, its golden scales gleaming as it plummeted from the sky.</p><p>The cultivators outside the Ritual Platform could clearly see half of the dragon's body.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The dragon's tail pierced the auspicious clouds like an arrow, striking directly above the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons.</p><p>The auspicious clouds exploded, shaking heaven and earth. Even the cultivators and demon cultivators in the sky felt unsteady, their faces filled with awe.</p><p>Above the Ritual Platform, a section of the dragon's body spanned the heavens, its head unseen, its size unknown.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>As the Daoists stood paralyzed, the demon cultivators received the order to withdraw.</p><p>The Demon Kings were the fastest to react. By now, everything was unfolding according to the Great Sage’s plan.</p><p>Their mission was complete. Their previous display had been a bluff, meant to convince the Dao Court that the Divine Court had emerged.</p><p>They were no longer needed to seize the fragmented map; nor did they have the power to participate.</p><p>Orders were absolute.</p><p>The demon cultivators retreated like a receding tide.</p><p>The Daoists, as if awakening from a dream, found themselves in an unprecedented situation.  Hesitant, they then saw a red light approaching from the west.</p><p>‘Ring… Ring…’</p><p>As the red light streaked across the sky, the bronze bell chimed softly.</p><p>The chime wasn't jarring, but all cultivators inside and outside the Ritual Platform heard it. The chime carried a calming power, soothing their turbulent minds.</p><p>The red light reached the Ritual Platform, revealing its true form.  The ribbon danced in the wind as the bronze bell began to shake violently.</p><p>Visible ripples spread from the bell’s mouth. Yellow sound waves appeared, distorting the very fabric of space.</p><p>The sound waves enveloped the dragon's body within the dark clouds.</p><p>Just then, the persistent shriek echoed from the depths of the Sinful Wasteland, drawing closer.</p><p>Many cultivators and demon cultivators on the battlefield covered their ears in pain. The shriek drowned out the bell’s chime, piercing their minds.</p><p>The world grew darker.</p><p>Those with keen senses noticed something amiss.  They pointed towards the area behind the Ritual Platform, their voices trembling, "What is that?"</p><p>Those beside them followed their gaze, and their expressions froze.</p><p>Against the gloomy sky, strange patterns appeared, like ripples on water, radiating a black sheen.</p><p>"That… looks like plumage?"</p><p>"It's a wing!"</p><p>"One wing! Only one!"</p><p>…</p><p>Exclamations erupted.</p><p>They finally saw it clearly.  A monstrous beast's wing blotted out the sky.</p><p>Beasts were demon beasts. Logically, except for certain unusual creatures, they should have at least a pair of wings.</p><p>But from their vantage point, they couldn't even see the whole of this single wing, its edges extending beyond their sight, let alone a second one.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky seemed to fall!</p><p>The cultivators staring in that direction felt their breath catch, an immense pressure weighing on their hearts.</p><p>The sky hadn't collapsed.  The wing had simply moved, seemingly in slow motion.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A fierce wind erupted.</p><p>The single flap of the wing was as powerful as the dragon's tail strike. Black feathers rustled, and a black vortex of wind formed beneath the wing.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the vortex transformed into a hurricane, as vast as the wing itself, swallowing the bronze bell and its sound waves.</p><p>The chime weakened significantly.</p><p>Simultaneously.</p><p>From the northwest, deafening thunder roared.</p><p>With dark clouds in the east, black feathers in the north, the western sky was now dominated by grey lightning.</p><p>Countless bolts of lightning, seemingly chaotic, yet with a clear purpose, converged on the Ritual Platform.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The first and thickest bolt of grey lightning slammed into the void west of the Ritual Platform.</p><p>At that very moment, starlight descended.</p><p>Though it wasn't night, countless stars appeared in the sky.</p><p>Elsewhere, the starlight might have been brilliant, but here it was strangely dim.</p><p>However, the Milky Way remained clearly visible.</p><p>Stars within the Milky Way shimmered, sending down a beam of starlight. Then, surrounding stars began to twinkle in clusters.</p><p>Beams of starlight rained down, illuminating the battlefield, converging where the first beam had landed.</p><p>At this moment, the light of countless stars shone solely on this spot.</p><p>The starlight merged, transforming into a warm jade color, then truly coalescing into a jade talisman.</p><p>The talisman was no more than three inches long, small and exquisite, the most translucent jade imaginable.</p><p>Faint starlight flickered on its surface, its runes constantly shifting, as if containing the essence of all the stars in the heavens.</p><p>The jade talisman trembled, about to shoot towards the Ritual Platform, when the grey lightning struck.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>A domain of grey lightning instantly enveloped the jade talisman.</p><p>Though the talisman wouldn't be easily destroyed, it was trapped within a cage of lightning.</p><p>The Demon Calling Drum couldn't control the beasts it attracted, but it could manipulate their instincts, subtly guiding them, though only for a short time.</p><p>However, in the Great Sage’s plan, this brief period was sufficient!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The dragon's tail pierced the auspicious clouds.</p><p>From above, a deep hole appeared in the center of the clouds.  The dragon's tail had pierced through multiple layers of illusion.</p><p>Blinding golden light shone within, interspersed with other colors and countless strange fragments, swirling into a storm of terrifying destructive power, capable of tearing apart everything around it.</p><p>The Great Sage had forcibly invaded the Ritual Platform.  Wherever the dragon's tail reached, the illusions of the Platform were thrown into chaos.</p><p>The dragon’s tail was at the center of the storm.</p><p>The chaos signified that remnants of ancient divine powers were being awakened. Even the Great Sage dared not remain within the Ritual Platform for long.</p><p>The golden light on the scales flickered incessantly, like a pillar holding back the sea, relentlessly driving deeper into the Ritual Platform.</p><p>The Platform trembled violently.</p><p>With the storm at its core, waves of chaotic energy mixed with golden light erupted, spreading throughout the entire Platform.</p><p>Everyone within the Ritual Platform felt the terrifying tremors.</p><p>Qin Sang and Left Grandmaster hadn't yet recovered from the roars of the two beasts when they were stunned by this new development.</p><p>The storm at the depths of the Ritual Platform hadn't reached them yet, but they already felt its pressure.</p><p>And as the upper layers of illusion were consumed by the storm, they caught glimpses of something awe-inspiring amidst the chaos.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>The dragon’s tail was unstoppable, piercing through layer upon layer of illusion.</p><p>Now, the old Daoist understood the Ghost Fang Kingdom’s true intentions.  He acted decisively, whipping his horsetail whisk upwards.</p><p>The whisk's threads lengthened wildly, shooting into the swirling primal chaos energy above.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The primal chaos energy reversed, swirling towards the Heavenly Prison at the center.</p><p>“Faster! Faster! Faster!”</p><p>The activation of the Heavenly Prison had been prepared in advance, making the process swift.  But retrieving it was far more difficult.</p><p>The old Daoist sensed the terrifying pressure above, his eyes bloodshot, knuckles cracking as he gripped the whisk.</p><p>As the primal chaos energy contracted, the outline of the fragmented map gradually reformed.</p><p>Suddenly, the primal chaos energy froze, as if bound by an unseen force.</p><p>The old Daoist felt his connection to the fragmented map of the Twenty-Four Heavenly Prisons weaken, on the verge of losing control. He paled in shock.</p><p>He flicked his sleeve, and dozens of talismans shot out, exploding one after another as their power was unleashed, targeting the fragmented map.</p><p>He still struggled, attempting to wrestle the fragmented map from the Great Sage’s grasp, unwilling to lose the treasure.</p><p>In this critical moment, he even considered a desperate attempt to seize the Demon Calling Drum.</p><p>However, Grandmaster Ruoquan and the others had already grasped the situation.</p><p>Even at their peak, they wouldn’t dare face a Great Sage directly. Now, having severed their cultivation, reduced to the Hollow Profound realm, even the slightest ripple of the Great Sage’s power could obliterate them.</p><p>This was no longer a matter of self-sacrifice.</p><p>Even if everyone present sacrificed their lives, they couldn’t stop the Great Sage from seizing the map.</p><p>Even if the old Daoist managed to retrieve the fragmented map, he wouldn’t escape far. Death was inevitable.</p><p>Their only hope lay in a Grand Sovereign arriving in time to force the Great Sage to retreat.</p><p>“It’s a Great Sage! We can’t fight it! Run!”</p><p>Grandmaster Ruoquan shouted urgently.</p><p>The three Grandmasters poured their power into the Ritual Platform, changing its direction, leading their battle formation in a hasty retreat, abandoning all else.</p><p>The old Daoist finally came to his senses. He looked at the fragmented map with a complex expression, sighing heavily, then resolutely withdrew his horsetail whisk.</p><p>The old Daoist was the core of the battle formation.  With his decision made, their speed increased dramatically.</p><p>They had barely retreated when a blinding golden light flashed.  Looking up, they saw a massive golden hole appear above.</p><p>A dragon’s tail pierced through the illusions.</p><p>The White-Robed Demon King and the other demons had already gathered around the Demon Calling Drum, their faces alight with fanaticism and excitement as they gazed at the dragon’s tail.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The dragon's tail suddenly flicked, sending out a golden beam.</p><p>The primal chaos energy shattered, reverting to a small fragmented map, caught by the golden beam.</p><p>The dragon's tail swept up the map and the demons, ignoring the terrified Daoists, and swiftly retracted.</p><p>Though the Great Sage disdained to even glance at them, the golden beam still sent the Daoists reeling.</p><p>Fleeing with all their might, they couldn't escape the aftershocks of the golden light.  A powerful force slammed into them, sending them sprawling, coughing up blood.</p><p>The four Grandmasters, using all their power, could only protect the Daoist Grandmasters under their command.  The remaining forces inevitably suffered heavy casualties.</p><p>The dragon's tail retracted, but the golden hole remained.  The storm within the Ritual Platform raged on, intensifying.</p><p>Unlike the previous bursts of golden light, the Great Sage had truly shaken the foundation of the Ritual Platform, shattering the balance it had maintained for years.</p><p>Starting from the illusions pierced by the dragon's tail, the power of ancient divine abilities fueled the storm, spreading further, affecting more illusions, destabilizing the foundation, and causing greater chaos.</p><p>Tranquility was no more!</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Left Grandmaster snapped out of his daze, crying out in alarm.</p><p>Though he hadn't witnessed it directly, he could deduce what had happened from the signs.</p><p>The old Daoist and the others were now at the heart of the chaos.  If they couldn’t escape in time, their chances of survival were slim.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Left Grandmaster rushed to their aid without even pausing to call out to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't follow. He simply watched the depths of the Ritual Platform, his face grim.</p>
