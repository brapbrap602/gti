<h1>Chapter 283: Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace</h1><p>The ancient cultivator's cave, where the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace is located, is divided into two layers.</p><p>Because of the marketplace's fame, later generations habitually referred to the entire cave by the marketplace's name.</p><p>The outer layer is outside the protective formation, which is the actual Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace.</p><p>Due to the weakening of the restrictive spells over time, and for various other reasons, this outer layer was discovered first and developed into a marketplace by the cave's owner as a cover.</p><p>Later, the marketplace was destroyed by Cloud Beasts, and the area was reduced to ruins. The remaining restrictions were also completely destroyed by the Cloud Beasts, making restoration impossible. Thus, it was abandoned, exposed to the elements, and became a Cloud Beast nest.</p><p>Therefore, every time the protective formation weakened, and people gathered at the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace, they first had to join forces to clear out the Cloud Beasts inhabiting the area.</p><p>There isn't much to say about the protective formation itself. It contains the elements of earth, wind, water, and fire, incorporating the cycle of yin and yang. Each time one enters, the formations encountered are different.</p><p>Yu Kong only briefly described his previous encounter; it was unlikely they would encounter the same formations this time.</p><p>What Yu Kong focused on, and what everyone was most concerned about, were several treasure locations within the cave.</p><p>The original form of the cave was a towering mountain. Although vast, it had been thoroughly explored. Five locations were generally recognized as key areas containing treasures.</p><p>The first to be discovered, and the most valued by the cave's owner, was a place known as the Offering Hall.</p><p>There was no plaque on the Offering Hall. However, it was built on the summit, the highest point of the entire cave. Inside, a clay statue was enshrined, demonstrating the cave owner's reverence for it.</p><p>It was suspected that the clay statue might represent the cave owner's ancestor, leading some to call it the Ancestral Hall.</p><p>Due to its unique location, significance, and prominence, the Offering Hall was the primary target for intruders from the beginning.  Its restrictions were broken early on, and the treasures stored inside, all of high quality, were plundered.</p><p>Many continued to search the Offering Hall afterward, even lifting the clay statue, only to confirm it had been completely emptied.</p><p>Now, only a few individuals remained, hoping to find something overlooked.</p><p>Next was a unique location second only to the Offering Hall, called the Legacy Jade Wall, embedded in the cliff face of the rear mountain.</p><p>By meditating before the Legacy Jade Wall, there was a chance to inherit the cave owner's legacy.</p><p>It was said that a Golden Core cultivator once attempted to remove the jade wall, striking the cliff with their palm.  The wall remained unscathed, while the cultivator was injured by the restrictions, and the attempt was abandoned.</p><p>However, no one had figured out the conditions for receiving the inheritance.  More likely than not, one would gain nothing, sitting in vain until the protective formation strengthened, forcing them to leave empty-handed.</p><p>Therefore, very few people now attempted to comprehend the Legacy Jade Wall.</p><p>Besides these, there were seven locations scattered throughout the mountain, similar to treasure vaults. These seven locations were the primary targets for those entering the cave.</p><p>Talismans,丹药, and jade slips could be found within these treasure vaults. However, the treasures and restrictions varied considerably among them.</p><p>Sometimes, the amount gained depended not only on strength but also on luck.</p><p>Yu Kong didn't hide his intentions; his target was a treasure vault located in the rear mountain.</p><p>Firstly, because this vault was the furthest, with strong restrictions, fewer people would compete for it. Secondly, he had been there before and, with his prior experience, was confident in obtaining more treasures this time.</p><p>…</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu, another group has just hurried past. Perhaps there's a change at the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace. Shouldn't we increase our pace?"</p><p>Everyone watched as over a dozen streaks of light sped towards the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace in the distance. Elder Mu Teng seemed impatient and voiced his inquiry.</p><p>Elder Mu Teng's urgency was understandable. They had been overtaken by several groups in the past two days. It appeared that the protective formation of the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace might be undergoing new changes.</p><p>Yu Kong glanced around and said, "It seems everyone shares Fellow Daoist Mu Teng's thoughts. Let's move."</p><p>Countless Cloud Beasts occupied the mountain.</p><p>With the passage of time, the area had become a Cloud Beast nest, and no trace of the Autumn Wildgoose Marketplace remained.</p><p>In the center of the Cloud Beast horde was a broken mountain.</p><p>Its peak had collapsed due to some external force, revealing a jagged edge.  At the center of this edge was a bottomless, circular pit. Multicolored lights constantly erupted from the pit, interspersed with various phenomena like hurricanes and flames. </p><p>The Cloud Beasts were terrified of the light and dared not approach, a testament to its power.</p><p>The cavern served as the entrance to the hidden dwelling, originally concealed by a barrier that was destroyed during the Fall Market's devastation.</p><p>Leaping into the cavern would trigger the protective formation, which was currently at its peak strength.</p><p>During the waning period, the light would dim considerably, barely extending beyond the cavern. At that time, the formation's power would greatly diminish, making it the optimal time to enter.</p><p>By now, many cultivators had gathered on the distant peaks surrounding the Broken Mountains. Most traveled in groups; lone cultivators were rare.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yu Kong occupied a low peak, their gaze fixed on the cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang knew little about the protective formation and couldn't discern much. His eyes scanned the area, finally locating Ge Yuan and Wandering Scholar. The three exchanged glances before subtly looking away, feigning unfamiliarity.</p><p>"No wonder these old foxes are all here. The waning period will arrive in half a month at most!" </p><p>Yu Kong, after observing for a long time, reached this conclusion and then murmured, "It's time to deal with the Cloud Beasts."</p><p>Although the Cloud Beasts were numerous, the cultivators gathering here were increasing, and each one possessed considerable strength. Eliminating the Cloud Beasts would only take some time.</p><p>As if on cue, an elderly cultivator in the late Foundation Establishment stage flew up and announced, "Fellow Daoists of mid-Foundation Establishment stage and above, join me in targeting the Cloud Beast leaders. The rest of you, work together to encircle and eliminate the other Cloud Beasts.  The spoils belong to whoever makes the kill. The true treasures lie within the dwelling. Let's not squabble over petty gains."</p><p>This elder held considerable prestige, and his words were met with immediate agreement.</p><p>Yu Kong dared not disobey the elder's command. He turned and softly reminded his companions, "Stay together, cover each other, and be vigilant. There are too many Cloud Beasts, and once the fight begins, it will be chaotic.  Ambushes are not unheard of."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others had rehearsed this scenario. They quickly formed a defensive formation, led by the most powerful, Elder Mu Teng. The Xiu sisters, with their seamless coordination, took up the rear, leaving no opportunity for opportunistic attacks.</p><p>Yu Kong nodded, reassured.  Just as he was about to depart, a voice sneered from the left, "Old Fox Yu, you're truly a coward, gathering so many people. Have you chosen your scapegoats yet?"</p><p>A streak of light landed before them, revealing Sheng Yuanzi!</p>
