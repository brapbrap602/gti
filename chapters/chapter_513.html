<h1>Chapter 506: The Green Cicada Coin</h1><p>Chapter 506: The Green Cicada Coin</p><p>Based on Wu Shang's experience, simultaneously channeling earth煞 energy and heaven罡 energy to refine a golden elixir requires a golden elixir that has not lost its vitality to withstand such a terrifying impact.</p><p>Qin Sang obtained the golden elixir from Jiu Pao Dao Ren a year ago.  It has nine years left before it loses its vitality due to being away from its original body for too long.</p><p>If he wants to try Wu Shang's method, he must do so within these nine years; otherwise, he must find a new golden elixir or demon pill.</p><p>Dealing with Jiu Pao Dao Ren was already so difficult, let alone other golden elixir masters?</p><p>The next nine years might be his only chance. Once the Purple Micro Palace matter is settled and the spiritual tide subsides, the four golden elixir masters of the Qingyang Demon Sect will return to their mountain gate and will not easily leave.</p><p>Although Qin Sang uses the alchemy method left by Wu Shang, he doesn't want to become a living corpse, so a vital golden elixir and heaven罡 energy are indispensable.</p><p>Yun Youzi looked deeply at Qin Sang, "It seems you've thought this through... but have you considered that even if we prepare thoroughly and barely manage to deal with the remaining golden elixir cultivator, what about the Qingyang Demon Sect's protective mountain formation? This formation was personally created by the founding ancestor of the Qingyang Demon Sect, who spent decades meticulously setting it up. It has protected the Qingyang Demon Sect to this day. Although the Qingyang Demon Sect is now weakened, other demon sects have never had any designs on it, partly thanks to this formation."</p><p>Having been in Qingyang Market for so long, Qin Sang had long understood the details of the Qingyang Demon Sect and was well aware of its protective mountain formation.</p><p>Legend has it that when the last Yuan Ying cultivator of the Qingyang Demon Sect passed away, two Yuan Ying cultivators from other demon sects attacked, and the Qingyang Demon Sect was on the brink of collapse.</p><p>The successor, a late-stage golden elixir cultivator, did not seek help but simply activated the formation, firmly defending the mountain gate and sending the two Yuan Ying cultivators away empty-handed.</p><p>After the two Yuan Ying cultivators left, they remained tight-lipped about the battle.</p><p>Since then, the Qingyang Demon Sect's protective mountain formation became renowned.</p><p>Such a powerful formation—even Qin Sang and a hundred Yun Youzis couldn't forcefully break through it. This is why Yun Youzi asked this question.</p><p>The Qingyang Demon Sect's protective mountain formation is the biggest hurdle.</p><p>Without getting into the Qingyang Demon Sect, everything is futile.</p><p>"We need to figure out a way to get us both inside…"</p><p>Yun Youzi paced back and forth, racking his brains to help Qin Sang think, also finding it very difficult. "The situation in the Yun Cang Great Swamp has now stabilized.  The various sects are no longer as panicked as before, but they won't relax either. Especially after the Qingyang Demon Sect's sect master left, they'll be even more vigilant and won't easily let outsiders enter the mountain. Unless you know someone close to the Qingyang Demon Sect who can get us in. Once inside, we'll find a way to avoid their sight and infiltrate the inner sect…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Senior, don't worry, I have an idea, with a fair chance of sneaking into the Qingyang Demon Sect. If it fails, we'll think of other ways. And Senior doesn't need to infiltrate the Qingyang Demon Sect with me. I'd like to ask you to take a Green Cicada coin to Wuyaya Valley…"</p><p>Qin Sang took out two copper coins from his pouch.</p><p>These two copper coins are one large and one small, the smaller one fitting perfectly inside the larger one.</p><p>When the two coins are put together, one can see a large and a small Green Cicada insect engraved on them, a mother and a child, lifelike and exquisitely detailed.</p><p>The mother is on the outside, and the child is in the middle.</p><p>This Green Cicada coin is a special artifact made from the blood of Green Cicada insects.  The mother's blood is applied to the larger coin, and the child's blood to the smaller one.</p><p>Two cultivators, one holding the mother coin and one holding the child coin.</p><p>The person holding the child coin crushes it, activating the insect blood on the coin with spiritual energy.  The mother coin will then sense it and create a new child coin.</p><p>Of course, there's a limit to the distance between the two Green Cicada coins, but the range is quite far. Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, one in the Qingyang Demon Sect and the other in the Wuyaya Valley, can still sense each other.</p><p>The function of the Green Cicada coin is similar to the Heart-linked pendant Yun Youzi gave them when they were in Xihuang Town, though not as useful, unable to transmit messages. But it can bypass all kinds of restrictions and formations.</p><p>As long as it's within a certain range, crushing the child coin will activate the mother coin.</p><p>The advantage is that the Green Cicada coin has a longer range than the Heart-linked pendant. Unlike the pendant, which breaks upon use, the child coin can be repeatedly regenerated before the mother's blood is depleted, allowing for multiple uses.</p><p>(Exchange good books.

Although not as rare as fire jade centipedes, they are still quite rare and difficult to find.</p><p>This wasn't a coin Qin Sang crafted; he acquired it as spoils during a fierce battle with the Tianxing Alliance in the chaotic waters of the  Island Sea.  Its unusual effects prompted him to keep it.</p><p>The coin has been used several times, leaving little of the mother's blood. It can be used three or four more times.</p><p>Qin Sang gave the mother coin to Yun Youzi, keeping the child coin himself.  "The Qingyang Sect is quite close to the Wuyaya Valley. Most of their disciples are training there.  If I crush this coin, I'd like you to create a distraction for the Qingyang disciples, drawing their attention. If we could lure that Golden Core cultivator out of the mountain, that would be ideal.”</p><p>Qin Sang trusts Yun Youzi's abilities. His artifact, the Immaculate Pearl, is extraordinary. Qin Sang has noticed the pearl grows stronger as Yun Youzi's cultivation improves.  Back when Yun Youzi was only at the Core Formation mid-stage, the pearl was already quite remarkable; now, it must be exceptionally powerful.</p><p>Qin Sang senses this isn't the extent of Yun Youzi's strength.  His infiltration of Tianyao Hill without a scratch makes him even more enigmatic.  Qin Sang, even without using his Flying Night Fork, isn't entirely confident he could defeat Yun Youzi.</p><p>The Qingyang Sect's Core Formation disciples are certainly no match for Yun Youzi, making him the only suitable choice for this task.  Mu Yifeng, Brother Rong, and the others aren't up to it.</p><p>Qi Yuanshou would be the most reliable, but firstly, Qin Sang doesn't have the opportunity to ask him, and secondly, Qi Yuanshou would undoubtedly probe deeply and absolutely wouldn't allow Qin Sang to dabble in necromancy.</p><p>Yun Youzi took the coin, clearly disapproving of Qin Sang's plan, frowning and asking,  "Do you intend to cause a major disturbance at the Qingyang Sect? How will you escape then?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "I won't resort to force unless absolutely necessary.  Luring away the Golden Core cultivator is to buy as much time as possible."</p><p>Yun Youzi's expression softened slightly. He mused, "A feigned retreat… with the three Golden Core cultivators absent, the Qingyang Sect will be at its weakest, but also highly vigilant. If I simply attack the Sect's disciples, it will be too obvious, leaving a trail. They'll become more alert if they suspect someone is targeting them. Unless that Golden Core cultivator is a fool, they won't fall for it easily."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.  "If it can't be done, we shouldn't force it.  Even diverting their attention will suffice."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, then his eyes lit up. He mused, "Don't worry, Qin, I know how to handle this…"</p>
