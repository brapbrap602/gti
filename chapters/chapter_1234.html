<h1>Chapter 1226: Present and Future</h1><p>The secret technique, *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, doesn't mention refining the spirit fire before absorption. Instead, it advocates direct absorption of the spirit fire's essence to create the fire seed.</p><p>This is manageable with one or two spirit fires.</p><p>However, to advance further, cultivators must continuously absorb and refine various spirit fires, merging them into a single Fire Seed Lotus.</p><p>Different spirit fires might clash.  Accumulating chaotic energies destabilizes the foundation, making future refinement much harder.</p><p>Could this lead to the fire seed suddenly becoming uncontrollable?</p><p>The fire seed is rooted in the primordial spirit; caution is necessary.</p><p>Did the creator of *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* overlook this, or was this concern already addressed?</p><p>Qin Sang had considered this.  After all, all the Dao are interconnected.</p><p>The Netherworld Demon Fire, being artificially cultivated, also needs refinement to obtain a pure essence.</p><p>But firstly, the secret technique lacks relevant information.  Secondly, refining the Netherworld Demon Fire already pushed his limits; he lacks the ability to further refine it.</p><p>This technique from the Qingyang Demon Sect perfectly aligns with his thoughts!</p><p>Qin Sang silently immersed himself in studying the secret technique.</p><p>This technique relies on the Qingyang Demon Sect's cultivation methods and Qingyang Demon Fire; it cannot be directly applied to the Netherworld Demon Fire, but it provides a valuable reference point and direction.</p><p>"Should I trust *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, or follow my intuition?"</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought, weighing the pros and cons.</p><p>Trusting the technique and its creator, directly absorbing the Netherworld Demon Fire, would grant him a powerful abilityâ€”a tempting prospect.</p><p>Judging by the Netherworld Demon Fire's past performance, after refining all the demon fire sealed within the nineteen demon banners, he could become invincible at the Nascent Soul stage, dominating his generation.</p><p>Perhaps, he could even stand a chance against a Transcendence stage cultivator.</p><p>Refining the Netherworld Demon Fire first would reduce its power but build a solid foundation for the future.</p><p>With Transcendence cultivators hidden in this realm, Nascent Soul masters are the pinnacle. The first option seems reasonable.</p><p>But Qin Sang seeks more.</p><p>He desires longevity, free from decay and calamity!</p><p>After settling his affairs and reaching a certain level, he will leave Northern Star Region, travel far and wide, seeking opportunities for Transcendence or a way out of the Storm Belt, exploring the world's true secrets.</p><p>His sights are set beyond the Nascent Soul stage, beyond the Storm Belt!</p><p>He will not stop there.</p><p>Otherwise, the grand vow he made before the Princess would be a laughingstock.</p><p>Qin Sang needed no further deliberation; he chose the future.</p><p>"Thank you, Daoist Xiang, for sharing the technique."</p><p>Qin Sang sincerely expressed his gratitude, glanced at the Ancestor Saint Fire, then withdrew his gaze. "Before further attempts, I wish to close myself off for a while to study the technique."</p><p>Xiang Qing readily agreed and led Qin Sang down the mountain.</p><p>Bing Han smiled, "It seems Daoist Mingyue is confident. My presence is unnecessary. I won't disturb you both. I wish you both success."</p><p>"Why not stay a few more days?"</p><p>Xiang Qing pressed.</p><p>Bing Han insisted on leaving. "I have some matters to attend to in my sect.  Meeting Daoist Mingyue today was worthwhile.  Daoist Mingyue's reputation is well-deserved.  If you are free, I hope you will visit the Xu Ling Sect. I also wish to learn from you about fire control techniques."</p><p>She exchanged a meaningful glance with Xiang Qing.</p><p>"Certainly! Certainly!"</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>Xu Ling Sect is renowned not only in Lesser Cold Region but throughout the Northern Star Region, primarily for its superb craftsmanship.</p><p>Qin Sang's introduction to crafting stemmed from a Golden Core cultivator's notes from the Xu Ling Sect.</p><p>However, he lacked proper guidance and had to learn by himself.</p><p>Learning alchemy from scratch would be difficult due to the lack of resources but his interest in crafting will persist. Furthermore, crafting artifacts to control and subdue the Southern Ming Li Fire requires guidance from a master craftsman like Bing Han.</p><p>Meeting Bing Han proved truly worthwhile for Qin Sang.</p><p>He and Xiang Qing escorted Bing Han outside the mountain before returning to the cave Xiang Qing had prepared, focusing on studying the technique.</p><p>When the alliance ended, Sect Master Dong hadn't seen Qin Sang and returned to his sect with anxiety, regretting his actions.  His only recourse was to appease the Demon Flame Sect.</p><p>The news of an unknown ancestor of the Demon Flame Sect suddenly advancing to the Nascent Soul stage swept through Lesser Cold Region like a hurricane.</p><p>The Demon Flame Sect became instantly influential, attracting many visitors.</p><p>Even a Nascent Soul cultivator sent a message to Qing, seeking confirmation.</p><p>Upon learning that this newly ascended Nascent Soul cultivator was the Moonlight Demon King, they all dismissed it with a laugh.</p><p>In the past, they would have driven the Burning Flame Sect to the Sky Demon Ridge.  However, it was now inadvisable to antagonize the demon race, so they tolerated it for the time being.</p><p>Zhao Shanran, left in charge of the Burning Flame Sect, was initially puzzled.  After hearing the news, he stood there dumbfounded for a long time, finding it hard to believe. Only after Mei Gu sent back a message did he dare to believe it.</p><p>He was both surprised and delighted.  Seeing a once-unassailable Golden Core cultivator now on equal footing, addressing him as "fellow cultivator," felt like a dream.</p><p>But he waited a long time, and his ancestor did not return.</p><p>After his initial excitement subsided, Zhao Shanran remembered his ancestor's instructions before departure and diligently focused on sect affairs.</p><p>Countless factions extended goodwill to the Burning Flame Sect, and countless cultivators came to visit, hoping to become disciples of the Nascent Soul cultivator. The sect's affairs became incredibly complex, but he was tireless in his work.</p><p>He knew in his heart that the Burning Flame Sect was on the verge of prosperity!</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang remained at the Qingyang Demon Sect. He had already grasped the essence of the secret technique, achieving some insights, and decided to adapt it for use with the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>The core of this technique involved using spiritual sense and spiritual energy to weave unique restrictions, like water washing away impurities from the spiritual fire, leaving behind the purest spiritual fire essence.</p><p>He summoned the fire seed, without hesitation, dissipating the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire he had painstakingly refined before.</p><p>Then, he drew a wisp of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire from the demon banner. After countless failures, he finally purged the impurities and refined the purest demon fire.</p><p>After reconstituting the fire seed, Qin Sang contacted Qing and returned to Shen Gang Peak.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang guided a wisp of Ancestor Saint Fire into the fire seed, first refining the Ancestor Saint Fire with the secret technique, then proceeding with its refinement.  It was a success.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang refined the Ancestor Saint Fire bit by bit, like a skilled butcher dissecting an ox.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang was that refining the Ancestor Saint Fire and cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" went far more smoothly than anticipated.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang attributed the success to the Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>The ebony sword, infused with Soul-Nourishing Wood, constantly emitted soul light, nourishing his soul and refining his spiritual sense.</p><p>While others struggled to find a piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood to make a small charm, he had obtained a large section from Bai, mostly used for sword making.</p><p>After decades of nourishment, its effects finally manifested.</p><p>This was likely the benefit of refined spiritual sense!  With a refined spiritual sense, cultivation and the practice of related techniques became easier and faster.</p>
