<h1>Chapter 301: Gathering Spirit Medicine</h1><p>Chapter 301: Gathering Spirit Medicine</p><p>As they spoke, they have already engaged in a fierce battle with the human-headed Rukh.</p><p>With the addition of Qin Sang and Ge Yuan, the power of the Golden Ring Formation had grown tremendously. The early-stage Yaoling Period human-headed Rukh was heavily injured by them and could only hover in the distance. The other small demons did not dare to approach.</p><p>The human-headed Rukh attempted to distance itself and attack each of them separately, but Qin Sang and the others did not give it a chance. They relentlessly pursued it, and in the blink of an eye, they had circled around a large portion of the mountain slope.</p><p>Seizing an opportunity, they consecutively used copper rings to trap the human-headed Rukh’s wings and claws, and suppressed its ferociousness a little, barely managing to hold on.</p><p>This was a rare opportunity. Qin Sang and Shangguan Lifeng immediately retreated and separated to act.</p><p>Ge Yuan still resented the embarrassment he suffered earlier. He urged the yellow copper ring to attack the human-headed Rukh with all its might and hurriedly sent a mental message to Qin Sang, “Clear Wind Daoist, you must obtain the Blue Dewbud. I will be eternally grateful!”</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang also received a mental message from Yunyouzi, informing him of the location and type of several spirit medicines.</p><p>It was not all in vain. The Profound Yellow Qi really led to the Profound Veined Golden Essence!</p><p>Upon hearing that there was indeed Profound Veined Golden Essence, Qin Sang’s heart was filled with excitement. He patiently listened to Yunyouzi explaining how to break the spirit medicine’s restriction. Then, he immediately soared towards the Profound Veined Golden Essence.</p><p>The little demons saw this and surrounded him to attack. However, it was not a big problem. Qin Sang flew to an empty spot and directly unleashed his Ten Directions Yama Banner. The Soul Burning Threads attacked their souls, forcing these human-headed Rukh to retreat. His speed did not decrease, and he quickly saw the spirit medicine he had been longing for.</p><p>The Profound Veined Golden Essence was growing among some rocks. Its leaves were emerald green and as large as lotus leaves, forming a big patch.</p><p>A section of the rhizome emerged from the crack, and its color was exactly the same as the Profound Yellow Qi emitted by the Profound Veined Golden Essence. However, it was very inconspicuous, only as thick as a finger. Its surface was wrinkled, looking like a piece of withered tree root.</p><p>It did not emit any strong medicinal fragrance.</p><p>But this was the Profound Veined Golden Essence, the main ingredient of the Profound Veined Golden Harmony Pill!</p><p>Qin Sang’s breath quickened. He took a deep look at the Profound Veined Golden Essence, raised his head, and followed the glow to look into the depths of the mist.</p><p>Yunyouzi’s information and his own speculations confirmed each other, giving him a rough understanding of the patterns of the spirit medicine’s protective restriction.</p><p>This restriction was meticulously arranged. The mountain mist seemed harmless, but it was actually part of the restriction.</p><p>And in this yellow light, there was not only the Profound Yellow Qi emitted by the Profound Veined Golden Essence, but also another part of the restriction hidden within it. This was the reason why the spirit medicine’s aura was so concentrated. Those seemingly faint, thin rays of light had become like this because the spirit medicine was no longer here.</p><p>Once someone tried to pick the spirit medicine and touched its aura, the restriction would be triggered, and lightning would erupt. Yunyouzi guessed that the power of the lightning was probably related to the quality of the spirit medicine.</p><p>Qin Sang had already witnessed Ge Yuan’s experience when he was picking the Blue Dewbud. It was terrifying. It could kill cultivators of the late Foundation Establishment Period, or else it would have been swallowed by the human-headed Rukh long ago.</p><p>Because of this, he had to be very careful. Otherwise, he would be reduced to ashes by the lightning.</p><p>Standing still for a moment, Qin Sang extended his right hand. A small ball of spiritual energy condensed in his palm. With a flick of his finger, it flew towards the Profound Veined Golden Essence.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The spiritual energy was unable to harm the Profound Veined Golden Essence. After touching the surrounding Profound Yellow Qi, the glow fluctuated slightly and dispersed the spiritual energy.</p><p>Seeing that the restriction did not seem to change, Qin Sang stopped hesitating. He silently urged the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman in his Qi Sea. The Azure Dragon Essence materialized and flew to the side of the Profound Veined Golden Essence. He extended his hand to grab the spirit medicine.</p><p>Just like Ge Yuan’s encounter, as the spirit medicine was about to be obtained, the restriction was immediately triggered. A dazzling electric net suddenly jumped out.</p><p>At the same time, thunder roared from above. Qin Sang was about to suffer a heavenly tribulation by five thunderbolts.</p><p>The power of these lightning bolts was slightly stronger than the ones Ge Yuan encountered.</p><p>Qin Sang had expected this and immediately urged the Nine Dragons Heavenly Chariot Talisman. His figure retreated rapidly and only stopped after the lightning dissipated. Throughout this process, his gaze remained fixated on the area above where the spirit medicine’s aura and the mist met.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang heard the furious cries of the human-headed Rukh in the distance. He looked警惕地 toward the direction of the cries, just in case they could not suppress the human-headed Rukh.</p><p>Fortunately, the demon was firmly restricted by Yunyouzi and the others, so he could concentrate on breaking the restriction.</p><p>#888 Cash Red Envelope Lucky Draw# </p><p>Follow the official account [Book Friends Base Camp] on WeChat to enjoy popular masterpieces and win an 888 cash red envelope!</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his look and looked at the Yellow Spirit Herb again and started trying again.</p><p>He kept trying again and again, and Qin Sang looked rather embarrassed, but he gradually revealed a smile on his face. He finally found a hint of the forbidden technique.</p><p>Dodging the lightning for the last time, Qin Sang stood there to adjust and calm his spiritual power before lowering his gaze slightly.</p><p>Although he has discovered the key to the forbidden technique, there are still quite a few dangers to watch out for if he wants to break it.</p><p>However, he still has to give it a try even if there is great danger.</p><p>The essence of the dragon roared silently. Qin Sang surprisingly activated the power of the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman in advanced, and his Ebony Sword also floated in front of him, ready to attack at any time.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a sigh of relief, then appeared beside the Yellow Spirit Herb, immediately triggering the forbidden technique.</p><p>Facing silver lightning snakes dancing in a disorderly manner, Qin Sang surprisingly didn’t retreat this time, but pretended to retreat instead. When the lightning dispersed slightly, he charged straight at it!</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang’s figure was surrounded by lightning.</p><p>Currently, he discarded all thoughts in his mind. His eyes were fixed on the twisted silver snakes as he unhesitatingly used his fastest speed, leaving afterimages in his wake.</p><p>These afterimages were instantly shattered by the lightning, but Qin Sang himself unexpectedly passed through the gaps in the lightning and flew straight into the sky.</p><p>Those lightning bolts immediately turned around and chased him relentlessly, but all Qin Sang needed was this opportunity.</p><p>The Ebony Sword flew out and stabbed a certain point where the breath of the spirit medicine and the mist met. It actually let out a loud noise that could rival a big bell.</p><p>The light shook violently, seemingly without much change.</p><p>However, Qin Sang achieved his goal and immediately started fleeing. Once the lightning dissipated, he repeated the same tactic again.</p><p>He repeated this again and again, looking extremely dangerous, but Qin Sang was already able to handle it proficiently.</p><p>The forbidden technique isn’t unchanging, but Qin Sang grasped it firmly each time.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Hard work pays off. After another loud noise, the light actually weakened slightly, which inspired Qin Sang greatly.</p><p>However, the forbidden technique also started a new change at this time. The mist surged and actually started repairing itself automatically.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Qin Sang’s expression changed slightly. He took out a spirit pill and stuffed it into his mouth without stopping.</p><p>Finally, the Ebony Sword stabbed the key point of the forbidden technique again. The light pillar scattered with a ‘whoosh’, and the lightning behind it also became extremely dim, greatly reducing its power.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes suddenly lit up. He didn’t hesitate to turn around and charge down, taking the lightning head-on and grabbing the Yellow Spirit Herb!</p>
