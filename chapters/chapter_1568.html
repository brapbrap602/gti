<h1>Chapter 1559: Illusion Seed</h1><p>“Fellow Daoist Lu, could the Stone Toad have fled its lair due to external threats?”</p><p>Having searched for a long time without any results, Qin Sang couldn't help but voice his doubts.</p><p>The threat he spoke of was precisely the Corpse Flame Moth swarm.</p><p>After killing the swarm, they continued their search, discovering that many tunnels were eerily silent, devoid of even a single living creature.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, they must have been slaughtered by the Corpse Flame Moths.</p><p>The swarm, unchecked by any natural predators, had wreaked havoc, posing a deadly threat to the creatures in this area. Any insect or beast with sharp spiritual senses would have surely migrated away.</p><p>During their search, they had also taken great care to suppress their Nascent Soul auras.</p><p>Lu Zhang frowned. “The Corpse Flame Moths shouldn't have the ability to see through the Stone Toad's camouflage. As long as the environment here isn't drastically altered, the Stone Toad shouldn't have been startled. Though there's no explicit record of it, I suspect that the lair has an irreplaceable function for the Stone Toad before it reaches maturity.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Stone Toad?”</p><p>The grey-robed man in the distance rubbed his chin, pondering for a moment, unable to recall the Stone Toad's origins.</p><p>Seeing that the other party wouldn't leave anytime soon, the grey-robed man retreated underground, reporting the matter to the strange-faced man. “…One is an elder of the Unfettered Mountain Sect, the other is unfamiliar, but his cultivation is not weak. Both are at the mid-Nascent Soul stage. They are searching for the Stone Toad, I don’t know what kind of treasure it is.”</p><p>The strange-faced man remained silent.</p><p>The grey-robed man waited for a while, then tentatively said, “Master, these two have come from thousands of miles away. This treasure must be of extremely high value…”</p><p>He didn't care if he offended the Unfettered Mountain Sect.  At most, the Sect Leader of Unfettered Mountain was on par with his master.  If they snatched it, they snatched it. What could the Unfettered Mountain Sect do?</p><p>The strange-faced man remained noncommittal, pondering for a long time, then slowly said, “If it's that kind of spiritual creature, it would be excellent seed for a Gu beast, far surpassing your Five-Colored Venom Spider in potential…”</p><p>The grey-robed man was overjoyed upon hearing this.</p><p>The strange-faced man stood up, reached out and grabbed the Jade Armored Beetle in front of him, then with a flick of his sleeve, confined the remaining Corpse Flame Moths.  Then, he sealed the formation, concealing all traces, and walked out.</p><p>The grey-robed man hurriedly followed.</p><p>Unhurried, the strange-faced man first went to the place where Qin Sang and Lu Zhang had slaughtered the Corpse Flame Moths, glanced around, and then had the grey-robed man continue tracking their targets.</p><p>“They’re still searching!” the grey-robed man said joyfully.</p><p>The strange-faced man, however, showed no immediate intention to act. He leisurely followed his disciple, focusing on refining the Jade Armored Beetle, only instructing the grey-robed man to keep a close watch using the Five-Colored Venom Spider.</p><p>Seeing this, the grey-robed man understood his master's intent. It was best to seize the Stone Toad at the opportune moment; there was no need to kill. There was no benefit to engaging in a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>One opponent hailed from a renowned sect, and the other was certainly not weak either.  They were not easy prey.</p><p>Thinking of the imminent acquisition of a Gu beast with immense potential, the grey-robed man rubbed his hands together, concentrating on manipulating the Five-Colored Venom Spider.</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang and Lu Zhang had already searched over seventy percent of the area.  Nearly two months had passed since they entered the basin. Taking turns, they didn't feel fatigued.</p><p>They hadn't encountered any more large groups of Corpse Flame Moths and faced no life-threatening dangers.</p><p>However, having wasted so much time, if they ended up with nothing to show for it, it would inevitably be discouraging.</p><p>Lu Zhang was no longer entirely confident.</p><p>Within the dark tunnels, the two urged on the Treasured-Colored Bell, traversing the spiderweb-like passages, listening to the monotonous ringing as they silently advanced.</p><p>Another shift.</p><p>The Treasured-Colored Bell was passed to Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Ring, ring, ring…’</p><p>Trying to find amusement in hardship, Qin Sang felt like a peddler hawking goods along the street, ringing a bell as he darted about. He shared this thought with Lu Zhang, and both of them burst out laughing.</p><p>The laughter echoed in the tunnels.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's laughter ceased. He let out a soft gasp, his eyes sharp as lightning, fixed on a section of the stone wall. At the same time, his True Essence surged, pouring into the Treasured-Colored Bell with all his might.</p><p>‘Ring! Ring! Ring!’</p><p>The Treasured-Colored Bell vibrated frantically, the ringing sharp and piercing.</p><p>The treasured light suddenly intensified, surging out like a tide.</p><p>Under the illumination of the treasured light, every detail of the stone wall was revealed.</p><p>The stone wall was smooth and flat, seemingly empty. However, as the Treasured-Colored Bell's light enveloped it, the light in this area became strangely distorted.</p><p>Immediately afterward, rounded lines appeared on the greyish-black stone wall, faintly outlining a thumb-sized frog-like pattern.</p><p>The Stone Toad!</p><p>The moment it was revealed by the treasured light, the Stone Toad sensed danger.  Its hind legs twitched, and the pattern on the stone wall vanished with incredible speed.</p><p>The Stone Toad wasn't simply camouflaged as stone; it had merged its entire body with the stone wall and could freely traverse within it, mastering Earth遁 (Earth Evasion).</p><p>It was completely different from what Lu Zhang had described.</p><p>When fleeing, the Stone Toad was not slow at all!</p><p>Lu Zhang reacted swiftly.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang discovered the Stone Toad's trace, Lu Zhang darted out from behind him, a streak of azure light shooting from between his eyebrows, transforming into a small azure bell.</p><p>The azure bell expanded rapidly.</p><p>A thunderous boom resounded as the stone wall was shattered by the azure bell.</p><p>Not only were several nearby tunnels pierced, but the surrounding stone walls were completely leveled. The impact even reached the levels above and below, shattering all connected rock.</p><p>In an instant, a spherical cavern was created underground.</p><p>Qin Sang and Lu Zhang coordinated seamlessly.  As the stone wall was broken through, the Treasured-Colored Bell flew high, its treasured light radiating, illuminating the entire area.</p><p>Rubble flew.</p><p>Dust billowed.</p><p>Its escape route cut off, the Stone Toad was forced out from the rock.</p><p>On its back, a faint purple glow flickered.  It had already begun its transformation into a Purple-Striped Spirit Toad, but they had found it before the transformation was complete.</p><p>The Stone Toad flashed, merging with a piece of rubble, then rapidly hopping between the stones, fleeing downwards.</p><p>Unfortunately, it had been locked onto, and its illusion techniques were ineffective.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>Lu Zhang's azure bell, imbued with imposing momentum, pulverized countless fragments of rock, forcibly creating a wide passage.  The bell tilted slightly, aiming at the Stone Toad, and shot out a beam of ethereal azure light.</p><p>Just as the Stone Toad was about to be captured by the azure bell, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The dust below abruptly churned, a pale hand reaching out, grabbing the Stone Toad first.</p><p>The coveted treasure, so close at hand, was intercepted by an unexpected guest.</p><p>Lu Zhang was enraged. “Insolent!”</p><p>The azure bell vibrated violently, heavy as a thousand jun, smashing directly towards the hand.</p><p>The strange-faced man’s figure appeared close behind the hand. Looking at the azure bell, a sneer appeared on his lips. He opened his mouth and spat out a wooden bead, which flew towards the azure bell. Simultaneously, his hand grasped the Stone Toad, his fingers clenching tightly!</p><p>However, he didn't notice that, at this moment, the Treasured-Colored Bell’s light had dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing the unfavorable situation and unable to assist in time, had decisively withdrawn the treasure that could dispel illusions.</p><p>The next moment, the strange-faced man’s sneer froze. He looked down at his palm.</p><p>There was no Stone Toad in his grasp, but rather, an Illusion Flower.</p><p>The petals instantly withered, leaving behind only a single Illusion Seed.</p>
