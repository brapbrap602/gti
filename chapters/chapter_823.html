<h1>Chapter 815: Transformation</h1><p>Three days later.</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of Quheng Island.</p><p>He tossed the jade token in his hand and smiled faintly.</p><p>With spirit stones in hand, the young cultivator led him to meet the 'senior'.</p><p>The 'senior' was merely a cultivator in the early stage of Core Formation and couldn't see through his disguise.</p><p>This person was also greedy for money; seeing the spirit stones, he directly agreed to Qin Sang's request.</p><p>The so-called stewardship wasn't as impressive as the young cultivator described. The positions one could directly take were on impoverished small islands or in the patrol guard, a thankless task.</p><p>The 'senior' presented several locations for Qin Sang to choose from, and he immediately settled on a small island called Nandao Island.</p><p>There was only one mortal city on the island, and the only place suitable for a cave dwelling was a single mountain, but its advantage was its proximity to Liangqiu Island.</p><p>...</p><p>"We've arrived!"</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at Nandao Island, sensed his surroundings, and noted the spiritual energy was indeed not very abundant, but it was still much better than those deserted islands.  Around Quheng Island, any island with a spiritual vein had been claimed.</p><p>Soon, he appeared above the only city on the island. Looking up at the green mountain behind the city, his figure flickered, and he entered the mountain.</p><p>There was a protective spirit array in the mountain. When activated, it could shield the entire city from storms.</p><p>Currently, the spirit array only enveloped the mountain peak, surrounded by a thin mist. Qin Sang swept his divine sense and perceived the aura of cultivators within, then he channeled his true essence into the jade token.</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The jade token vibrated, and the protective spirit array reacted. The cultivators inside noticed the change and flew out of their cave dwellings to the entrance of the spirit array.</p><p>"Only one Core Formation mid-stage cultivator, the others are all Qi Refining..."</p><p>Qin Sang saw through their cultivation levels at a glance. He presented a jade slip and said proactively, "Greetings, fellow Daoists. This humble Daoist's Dharma name is Mingyue, and I have been ordered to guard Nandao Island.  Being new here, I hope you all will take care of me.  Which of you is Daoist Master Ma Yu...?"</p><p>The Core Formation mid-stage cultivator was a middle-aged man with a square face. Hearing Qin Sang's words, his expression darkened.  He took the jade slip with a sullen face, read it, and said stiffly, "I am Ma Yu. Since Daoist Master has been ordered here, what are your instructions?"</p><p>Sensing the inexplicable hostility, Qin Sang smiled faintly and said nonchalantly, "Fellow Daoist, you are too serious. This humble Daoist originally wanted to find a peaceful place to cultivate, but I was unfortunately dispatched here.  My words carry little weight, and I had no choice but to obey. Please continue to manage the island's affairs, Fellow Daoist. If there's anything I can do to assist, I will certainly cooperate."</p><p>Hearing this, Ma Yu took a deep look at Qin Sang, and his expression softened slightly. "Actually, there aren't many affairs on the island. There happens to be an empty cave dwelling. Fellow Daoist, please follow me..."</p><p>After Qin Sang expressed his desire to focus solely on cultivation, Ma Yu's attitude softened considerably.  They dismissed the others and walked while talking.</p><p>"I'm new here. I wonder if there are any powerful secluded cultivators or Daoists of extraordinary origins nearby that I should be mindful of?" Qin Sang inquired tentatively.</p><p>Ma Yu pointed southeast, beyond the island, and whispered, "The nearby islands are all occupied by rogue cultivators like us; there's no need to be overly cautious, but there is one exception. About a hundred miles from here, there's an island called Liangqiu Island. Although it's not large, it possesses a high-grade spiritual vein, occupied by a Senior Luo. Senior Luo is powerful and mysterious. It's best not to disturb him, lest we invite unforeseen trouble."</p><p>Qin Sang looked into the distance. Liangqiu Island was not visible from here.  He feigned surprise and asked Ma Yu about the related rumors.</p><p>The cave dwelling Ma Yu provided for Qin Sang was in the back of the mountain.</p><p>After entering the cave dwelling, he first took out some spirit stones and set up a spirit-gathering array, then he summoned the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly was now the size of a palm, and the skyeye patterns on its wings appeared increasingly real, as if two eyes were about to open.</p><p>As its wings flapped, faint electric arcs flickered, a manifestation of its lightning manipulation ability.</p><p>Because of the electric arcs, its wings looked much more rigid, like metal.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had noticed the Skyeye Butterfly's unusual activity on the road. Now, summoning it, he confirmed it had successfully reached the peak of its second transformation and was ready to evolve!</p><p>If not for the five-year slumber caused by the mutation, it would have transformed before entering the Seven Kill Palace.</p><p>A joyful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face. He played with the Skyeye Butterfly for a while, then took out a jade bottle and poured out a few drops of Redfire Liquid Gold.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly happily danced around his palm, feasting.</p><p>After consuming the Redfire Liquid Gold, the Skyeye Butterfly clung to his finger, drowsy, but showing no signs of transformation.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the Skyeye Butterfly wouldn't advance as easily as the Fat Silkworm. He still had more than half a bottle of Redfire Liquid Gold left, so he wasn't in a hurry and continued to feed it slowly.</p><p>From then on, Qin Sang settled down on Nandao Island.</p><p>Every night, without fail, he drew upon the power of the stars to temper his body. During the day, he often went out to wander, befriending cultivators on nearby islands and secretly inquiring about Luo Daotong.</p><p>Every ten days, he fed the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>Unknowingly, he had been on Nandao Island for half a year.</p><p>After continuous feeding of Redfire Liquid Gold, the Skyeye Butterfly finally showed signs of transformation, and the Redfire Liquid Gold in his hand was almost depleted.</p><p>On this day, after the Skyeye Butterfly consumed the spiritual liquid, its wings suddenly erupted with dazzling lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted quickly and set up a barrier.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly flew up and down in the air, the electric arcs becoming increasingly dense, and the patterns on its wings began to squirm. The eyes slowly opened a slit!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly flew back to Qin Sang's palm, its body trembling violently, emitting a weak whimper.</p><p>At this moment, the electric arcs were frantically impacting the 'eyes' on its wings. The mutation brought benefits, granting it the ability to control lightning, but it also caused it to endure unforeseen dangers during its evolution.</p><p>Qin Sang realized this was the final step of the Skyeye Butterfly's mutation. The previous changes were merely superficial. Only when its innate divine ability and lightning manipulation ability fused could it truly become a Lightning Butterfly.</p><p>If it failed, it would likely die, and Qin Sang's decades of effort would be wasted.</p><p>Sensing its pain, Qin Sang's heart was filled with anxiety. He immediately sat cross-legged, communicated with the Skyeye Butterfly's consciousness to soothe it, and devoted all his efforts to helping it overcome this tribulation.</p><p>Fortunately, the Skyeye Butterfly was his natal Gu insect.  With Qin Sang sparing no expense of true essence and blood essence to help it, it finally passed the most dangerous stage, and its condition gradually stabilized.</p><p>With its wings folded, the Skyeye Butterfly fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>Finally, the 'eyes' opened completely, resembling true Skyeyes, capable of peering into people's hearts. The electric arcs vanished, completely merging into the 'eyes.' The 'pupils' turned silver, adding to their divine aura.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't guess what the Skyeye Butterfly's divine ability would ultimately become, but he was certain that it would only become stronger, not weaker.</p><p>He observed for a while, sensing the Skyeye Butterfly's aura, and clearly felt that in the process of helping it through the tribulation, the Skyeye Butterfly had become closer to him.</p><p>This closeness came from the heart, different from the constraint of the contract.</p><p>The transformation would be completed in its slumber and would take some time.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew it into his dantian and continued with his own affairs.</p>
