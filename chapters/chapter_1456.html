<h1>Chapter 1448: The Winter Rune</h1><p>What secrets does the jade sword hold?</p><p>Is it related to the Pure Ocean Sect?</p><p>…</p><p>Although the jade sword was obtained in the Buddha Hall, it was held in the hand of a corpse, so it might not necessarily be a Buddhist treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the jade sword, these questions flashed quickly through his mind, and he thought of the seven-storied stupa of unknown use in his hand, wondering if there was any connection between these two magical artifacts.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had no intention of exchanging for the jade sword; instead, he began to speculate about the other party's intentions.</p><p>There was a fifty percent chance that the old demon Hunmo was in the bamboo building. He shouldn't lack usable magical artifacts, and he should value this kind of exotic treasure with hidden secrets even more, right?</p><p>Could it be that he wanted to lure out someone who truly knew the secrets?</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang leaned back leisurely against the back of his chair. Whether the old demon Hunmo wanted to fish him out or someone else, he wouldn't rashly interfere.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed that the surrounding discussions were noticeably quieter. The jade sword seemed truly unusual.</p><p>But it wasn't enough for them to pay the price of a top-grade magical artifact.</p><p>Some people tried to bid a few times, but seeing that the owner of the jade sword was persistent, they all lost interest.</p><p>In the end, the transaction failed, and Venerable Chongtai moved the next bamboo building over.</p><p>Inside the bamboo building.</p><p>The old demon Hunmo reached out and summoned the jade sword back. He held the jade sword in one hand and the Lingzhi Scepter  in the other, with a somewhat confused expression.</p><p>True Essence surged into it.</p><p>A faint white light sphere appeared inside the jade sword.</p><p>The Guanyin on the Lingzhi Scepter also lit up, its tightly closed eyes seemingly about to open at any moment.</p><p>If someone were to enter the bamboo building at this time, they would notice that the fluctuations emitted by these two magical artifacts were very similar. The fluctuations of the jade sword were slightly thin, merely an imitation.</p><p>However, unless the two magical artifacts were placed together, or one had seen them beforehand, ordinary people wouldn't realize the difference.</p><p>"The refining technique of the jade sword is similar to the Lingzhi Scepter. I spent two years carefully refining it, and the fluctuations can imitate it somewhat. The Profound Sky Palace should buy it to investigate. This way, that news can be confirmed without alerting the enemy. Why didn't they make a move? Could it be that I guessed wrong?"</p><p>The old demon Hunmo muttered to himself.</p><p>Seeming that something hadn't been verified, the old demon Hunmo looked back and forth at the Lingzhi Scepter in his hand, his eyes less certain.</p><p>He somewhat regretted that he hadn't bothered to develop his subordinates because he didn't want his cultivation to be disturbed by mundane affairs; otherwise, things would be much easier.</p><p>The Ten Thousand Demons Assembly is backed by the strongest forces in the Boundless Sea, mutually restraining each other. He can only promote some unimportant matters and cannot control them.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, the old demon Hunmo hung the jade sword up again.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering the old demon Hunmo's intentions when he saw the jade token in his hand light up. He triggered the restriction on the spirit token and was moved to Venerable Chongtai's side.</p><p>The *Seven Teachers Buddha Seal* and the spirit materials for refining the Gold Sink Sword  were all in hand. He only used one Nether Thorn, so he had much more to spare now.</p><p>"Yuan Yin Water , Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruit, Yin Nether Soil …"</p><p>Qin Sang began to inquire about these spiritual objects without deliberately concealing it.</p><p>Based on the information he had investigated earlier, Qin Sang believed that Valley Master Mu most likely hadn't fallen.</p><p>It would be better if Valley Master Mu were here so he could take the opportunity to re-establish contact.</p><p>Even if Valley Master Mu died at the hands of the old demon Hunmo, there was no need to worry. The old demon Hunmo didn't go straight to the medicine garden when he entered the Pure Ocean Sect, indicating that he hadn't performed a soul search, or that the soul search had failed.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang received a response.</p><p>The other party had two Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruits, but they weren't interested in any of the three spiritual medicines in Qin Sang's hand.</p><p>Until the final free exchange, after several rounds of trading, Qin Sang paid with two kinds of spiritual medicines and finally obtained two Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruits as he wished, and also got the second drop of Heaven Crown Heavy Liquid .</p><p>Each spirit ascension requires a complete Seven-Colored Ganoderma Fruit, so he can only prioritize satisfying the Fire Jade Centipede and the Skyeye Butterfly.</p><p>As for the Yuan Yin Water and Yin Nether Soil, they didn't appear at the trade fair from beginning to end.</p><p>Qin Sang changed his strategy and asked if anyone knew the news of these two spiritual items, but he still didn't gain anything. It seems that he must go to Hundred Flower Valley again.</p><p>The trade fair was nearing its end.</p><p>Qin Sang gently exhaled a breath, feeling a sense of fatigue. Waging wits and testing each other's bottom lines with these old fellows consumed as much energy as a great battle.</p><p>He turned his gaze and landed on the jade sword that hadn't been bought yet.</p><p>Throughout the trade fair, he had been paying attention to that bamboo building. The owner of the jade sword was stubborn and never lowered the conditions, even if no one asked about it.</p><p>"If it's the old demon Hunmo, why sell the jade sword separately?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, unable to guess the other party's intentions.</p><p>Before long, Venerable Chongtai announced the end of the trade fair. The formations on Lake Heart Island changed rapidly, the bamboo buildings shifted positions and were completely shuffled, and finally all the bamboo buildings were completely hidden in the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang got up and walked out of the room, gave the jade token and spirit stones to the puppet maid, and boarded the bridge of light to leave Lake Heart Island.</p><p>Soon, streaks of light frequently appeared in the sky above Ten Thousand Demons City, heading in all directions.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't go south directly, but changed directions several times, observing whether he was being followed.</p><p>…</p><p>On Lake Heart Island.</p><p>The old demon Hunmo put away the unsold jade sword, his expression unusually gloomy.</p><p>At this moment, his gaze suddenly froze, as if he had realized something. He hurriedly left the bamboo building, and then his figure flashed and disappeared out of thin air.</p><p>In a corner of Ten Thousand Demons City, in a low and ordinary courtyard.</p><p>The interior of the room was very simple, like an ordinary family in the mortal world, but at this time there were only two mysterious people wearing black robes, sitting cross-legged in the room, looking out of place.</p><p>These two people remained still for a long time, without the slightest fluctuation on their bodies, like two dead people.</p><p>Suspended between them was a black demon eye, opening and closing, extending several invisible threads that extended beyond the courtyard, not knowing where they ultimately led.</p><p>Suddenly, the two of them opened their eyes at the same time and looked towards the door.</p><p>A figure appeared at the door at some point, it was the old demon Hunmo.</p><p>"Greetings, Master!"</p><p>The two hurriedly got up and saluted together.</p><p>"The trade fair is over, but the Profound Sky Palace hasn't made a move yet?" the old demon Hunmo asked in a gloomy tone.</p><p>"The trade fair is over?"</p><p>The two were startled when they heard this, and immediately realized that something was wrong. They replied nervously, "The news from the juniors is that everything is normal. The three elders of the Profound Sky Palace should be waiting for news, and there is no movement yet…"</p><p>Before they could finish speaking, the old demon Hunmo cursed them as fools, no longer concealing himself, and turned into a stream of light and rushed towards a courtyard in the distance.</p><p>The two looked embarrassed and hurriedly followed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The small courtyard hid a secret restriction, and several strands of pale white chill shot towards the intruder.</p><p>The old demon Hunmo snorted coldly, heavily pointed out his black bamboo cane, directly dispersing the chill, and then rushed into the main hall. He took a look, and then flashed into the back hall.</p><p>What he saw were only three ice sculptures with auras identical to the real people!</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The old demon Hunmo laughed in anger, smashed the ice sculptures with a stick, and glared fiercely at his two disciples.</p><p>The two were dumbfounded. After receiving instructions, they locked onto the residence of the elders of the Profound Sky Palace, without alerting the enemy, and had been secretly monitoring them with secret techniques.</p>
