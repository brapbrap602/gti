<h1>Chapter 278 Western Desert Town</h1><p>Western Desert Town.</p><p>This town is completely exposed to the sunlight and windblown sand, and its grand formation is only activated when celestial phenomena strike.</p><p>The north wind howled, and yellow sand swirled.</p><p>Amidst the dim, sandy dust, a figure appeared faintly, slowly walking towards the town.</p><p>Despite the massive sandstorm, this person wasn't hurried at all, strolling leisurely as if in a courtyard.  Any mortal witnessing this would be astonished. But in Western Desert Town, this was perfectly normal.  Mortals could hardly reach such a remote place; only cultivators came and went here.</p><p>For cultivators, a sandstorm of this magnitude was no different from a tickle. What they truly feared were the celestial phenomena that followed.</p><p>The Daoist emerged from the sandstorm, yet his attire remained remarkably clean. His brand-new Daoist robe was without a single crease, and whenever sand landed on it, it was repelled by a faint green light.</p><p>The Daoist didn't appear old, but his demeanor was quite composed, suggesting his true age was likely older than his appearance suggested.</p><p>By this time, the people of Western Desert Town had become accustomed to unfamiliar visitors. They casually glanced at the Daoist before losing interest.</p><p>"The celestial phenomena are occurring more and more frequently."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped onto the town's stone-paved road, paused, and sighed inwardly, recalling what Yun Youzi had said about the approaching Spirit Tide.</p><p>Once the Spirit Tide arrived, neither immortal caves nor secret realms would be of any use to Qin Sang. His current strength wouldn't allow him to wander freely amidst the Spirit Tide.  The best course of action was to seclude himself outside the grand pass and cultivate diligently until the Spirit Tide subsided.</p><p>However, as the Spirit Tide drew nearer, influenced by its power, the environment of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield would become increasingly hostile and more challenging to navigate. This was a matter of vital importance to everyone.</p><p>Human effort had its limits.  Qin Sang couldn't do anything about it, only hoping that the Spirit Tide wouldn't arrive too soon.</p><p>Qin Sang brushed off non-existent dust from his robe and squinted at the desolate town.</p><p>He and Yun Youzi had parted ways a month ago. Yun Youzi had arrived in Western Desert Town ten days ahead of him and hadn't contacted him since.  Qin Sang wondered if he had successfully infiltrated the target group.</p><p>The scale of Western Desert Town exceeded Qin Sang's expectations. Both its size and population were the largest he had encountered in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>Despite the raging sandstorm, numerous figures could still be seen on the streets, most likely drawn by the Autumn Wild Goose Market.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't see Yun Youzi. Recalling Yun Youzi's instructions before their separation, his gaze shifted, settling on the northeast corner of the town.</p><p>There stood a wooden building with a high-hanging banner – a teahouse.</p><p>…</p><p>"You look unfamiliar, Daoist.  I don't believe we've met. May I inquire as to your Daoist title?"</p><p>The teahouse owner personally came to refill Qin Sang's tea, observing him discreetly.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze, which had been wandering the streets, returned. He looked up at the owner, cupped his hands in greeting, and said, "Greetings, fellow Daoist. You have a keen eye.  Indeed, this is my first time in Western Desert Town. My Daoist title is Qing Feng."</p><p>The owner was surprisingly also a Foundation Establishment cultivator. However, judging by his age, he had likely given up on pursuing immortality, choosing instead to spend his remaining years running a teahouse in this town.</p><p>"Daoist Qing Feng braved the sandstorm to come to Western Desert Town.  Are you here for the Autumn Wild Goose Market as well?" The owner asked directly.</p><p>"Most people are, I imagine."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and gestured towards the people hurrying along the streets.  Not only were there Foundation Establishment cultivators, but even Qi Refining cultivators.</p><p>Even Foundation Establishment cultivators faced certain risks entering the Autumn Wild Goose Market.  The dangers faced by Qi Refining cultivators were even greater. They might not even survive the journey to the market, let alone breach its formations.</p><p>But fortune favored the bold, and the world never lacked daring individuals.</p><p>The owner nodded. Seeing Qin Sang's willingness to converse, he sat down and began to chat as if making idle conversation. "How much do you know about the Autumn Wild Goose Market, Daoist Qing Feng? Coming here alone, without companions, you might need to find some help. Otherwise, it might be difficult for you to breach the market's protective formation by yourself."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Qin Sang set down his teacup, leaned forward slightly, and feigned confusion.  "I've heard along the way that one needs companions to breach the formation of the Autumn Wild Goose Market. Is it truly that dangerous?  The Autumn Wild Goose Market has been open for a while now, hasn't it?  Has no one found a safe path?  I am a rogue cultivator, with few friends. The help I find in such haste may be untrustworthy."</p><p>The owner smiled. "If Daoist Qing Feng stays in Western Desert Town for a couple of days and makes some inquiries, you'll find out."</p><p>The protective formation around Autumnfall Market isn't static. It cycles through earth, water, fire, and wind elements, interwoven with yin and yang transformations. There's no single safe path. However, people have figured out some patterns.  As long as you find allies to support each other, the danger significantly decreases. Everyone succeeds or fails together within the formation, so you don't need to worry about sabotage. If mutual trust isn't possible, everyone can simply go their separate ways once inside.</p><p>“Thank you for the guidance,” Qin Sang said, appearing suddenly enlightened. He cupped his hands in gratitude. “In that case, there must be people in the city recruiting companions? Do you happen to know anything about this? Could you offer me some pointers?”</p><p>“You’re right. Quite a few are recruiting. Some even claim a guaranteed passage through the formation for a spirit stone fee, essentially extorting money.  These people are a mixed bag; it's best not to trust them.  There are also a few highly cultivated seniors. Joining their teams would be the safest option, but…”  The teahouse owner stroked his beard, glancing at Qin Sang, his words trailing off.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head nonchalantly, asking frankly, “You needn't spare my feelings. I'm self-aware. Is it because my cultivation level is too low for them?”  He wanted to blend into a team, so he hadn't bothered concealing his cultivation level with the Spirit Concealment Technique.</p><p>The owner laughed heartily.</p><p>“You’re a straightforward man! We both know high cultivation doesn't necessarily equal great skill, but it's the most obvious indicator. You can't expect people to reveal all their trump cards, and it's reasonable for them to have such requirements. Besides them, there are other options that aren't as stringent about cultivation level. However, since you don't want to continue cooperating once inside the market, your choices are limited. You might not know this, but the easily accessible areas within Autumnfall Market have mostly been picked clean.  Lingering in those places rarely yields worthwhile treasures.  It's practically a wasted trip. The more valuable locations, however, require teamwork to access. That’s why many people are looking for more than just companions to navigate the formation. As for options that suit your requirements, I do know of one. If you trust me, I can make an introduction.”</p><p>This was it. Qin Sang's heart stirred. This was precisely why he'd come to this teahouse.  Cloud Wanderer and his companion had discovered that the teahouse owner had close ties to his target, Yu Kong.</p>
