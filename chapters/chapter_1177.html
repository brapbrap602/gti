<h1>Chapter 1169: Resolution</h1><p>Chapter 1169: Resolution</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, your spiritual sense is truly sharp. I was discovered as soon as I drew near.”</p><p>From the mountain peak, subtle ripples disturbed the air.  A figure gradually solidified from an ethereal state.</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p>A serpentine figure, half-human, half-snake – the Snake King, the same one he had parted ways with at the Feather King Palace!</p><p>Despite being discovered, the Snake King remained composed, even smiling.  He flickered, swiftly descending the mountain to stand before Qin Sang.</p><p>Pang Ji and Bai He's feathers bristled; they dared not breathe. The Snake King didn't conceal his cultivation; the pressure emanating from a mid-Transformation Stage Grand Yao sent the two birds trembling.</p><p>“So it's the Snake King gracing us with his presence!”</p><p>Qin Sang shielded the two birds from the Grand Yao's pressure, his tone sarcastic, expressing his displeasure.</p><p>“I believe this is our second meeting since the Feather King Palace, correct?”</p><p>“Indeed.” The Snake King nodded. “Though we first met at the Feather King Palace, I’d heard of Daoist Mingyue long before. I’d heard that Daoist Zhu had cultivated an extraordinary disciple.”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t fooled by the seemingly complimentary words. He said coldly, “Don’t flatter yourself! I've long admired the Snake King’s reputation.  What brings you here? Why not mention it at the Feather King Palace? Instead, you follow me secretly. Fortunately, my spiritual sense is keen! Were you planning to do something once we were far from Wan Yao City?”</p><p>“The Feather King Palace was crowded; certain matters are not suitable to discuss in front of others. As for Daoist Mingyue's concerns…”</p><p>The Snake King’s lips curled into a sneer. “My actions are merely emulating your past behavior, Daoist. If you can do it, why can't we?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed.</p><p>Shortly after leaving the city, the Sky-Eye Butterfly alerted him to the Snake King’s presence.  Although the Snake King was a mid-Transformation Stage cultivator, significantly stronger, it was almost impossible to track Qin Sang silently without being discovered.  Under the Sky-Eye divine ability, unless using the highest level concealment techniques, everything would be exposed.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm. After flying a distance and confirming the pursuer was the Snake King, he realized his theft from the Qian Ji Yao King’s cave might have been exposed. The Snake King was Qian Ji's father-in-law.  Beyond that connection, Qin Sang couldn't think of any other reason for the pursuit.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang decided to stop and confront the Snake King directly. This place wasn't far from Wan Yao City; the Grand Yaos hadn't left long, and the Feather Yao King was still in the city, so the Snake King would have to be cautious.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the Snake King.  During his seclusion at the Yuan Shen Gate, Qin Sang hadn't stopped cultivating the *Heavenly Yao Transformation*, and could now fully control the Azure Luan wings on his back, greatly improving his escape techniques. He would still be wary of the Feather Yao King, a renowned expert with a great legacy.  After all, using Thunder Escape still relied on the thunder power generated by the Azure Luan wings.</p><p>Qin Sang had tested his limits: his cultivation level restricted the amount of thunder power he could control. Once depleted, it would take time to recover, so he preferred to avoid such situations.</p><p>However, escaping the Snake King wouldn't be difficult. This karmic entanglement needed to be resolved sooner or later. A peaceful resolution would be best. Qin Sang didn't want to be constantly watched by this father-in-law and son-in-law duo. Every action would be fraught with worry, hindering his movement, and possibly endangering the other Yaos in the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea.</p><p>As Qin Sang expected, after finishing, the Snake King flicked his finger, sending a stream of light into the sky.  Moments later, a tearing sound echoed in the distance.  A figure arrived. Qin Sang sensed a familiar presence – Qian Ji Yao King. Behind him was a cloud of Yao, his subordinates.</p><p>At this sight, Qin Sang frowned, unsure of their intentions. Qian Ji Yao King had also come, but hadn't appeared in the Feather King Palace.  Had he been waiting outside the city to intercept him? But bringing only a few minor Yaos would only make it easier to be detected.</p><p>In a blink, Qian Ji Yao King arrived beside the Snake King, staring coldly at Qin Sang with hostile eyes.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue once visited my son-in-law's cave.  You wouldn't fail to recognize him, would you?"  the Snake King said, his tone deep with meaning.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious.  "When did you two discover me?"</p><p>"Though you made many attempts to conceal yourself – masking your cultivation, deliberately using human sword techniques…"</p><p>"But to subdue four mutated spirit insects and easily evade the Pursuit, isn't that beyond the capabilities of an ordinary person?"</p><p>The Serpent King shook his head.  "After obtaining the stone tablet, Pursuit even kept it from me. How could anyone else know? The one who fought with Pursuit for the tablet only saw it as a demonic treasure, without witnessing the Qingluan phantom. They could only explain it through bloodline abilities.  The other cultivators have been renowned for many years; I'm more or less familiar with their abilities and bloodlines.  Only Daoist Mingyue is a new face, a newly transformed cultivator, with unknown origins. I boldly guess that you must be a rare descendant of the Qingluan, capable of sensing the aura of the Qingluan phantom, am I right?"</p><p>"Correct, it's me."</p><p>Qin Sang readily admitted.  Since it was already exposed, there was no need for further concealment.  The Serpent King misunderstood the cause and effect. It wasn't that she possessed Qingluan bloodline, but that someone had already discovered the Qingluan phantom before the fight with Pursuit.  However, this misunderstanding wasn't detrimental to Qin Sang.</p><p>"You have the nerve to admit it! Why aren't you running away today?"</p><p>Pursuit's face was full of mockery.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression didn't change.  She glanced at the late-arriving demonic followers. "After all, I was at fault first.  Since you two have come looking for me, why should I continue hiding? Sooner or later, we will have a confrontation.  I wonder how you two intend to resolve this?  You've mobilized such a large force, thinking you can keep us here?"</p><p>Pursuit roared angrily, "You insolent dog! Do you think I can't kill you?"</p><p>The Serpent King restrained Pursuit, saying in a deep voice, "I know, Daoist Mingyue is a disciple of Daoist Zhu.  Your escape techniques surpass even Pursuit's. You have the confidence to say this. Even if you aren't afraid, what about the Thousand Mountain Bamboo Forest cultivators? Can you truly bear the consequences of war?  Daoist Zhu has been in seclusion for hundreds of years. There must be a reason, right? I've always advocated for peace, but my hands are never clean."</p><p>After the threat, he paused, his tone softening slightly.</p><p>"If we truly had ill intentions, Daoist Mingyue, wouldn't we be foolish to openly attack and choose a location near Wan Yao City, as if we were afraid that the Feather King and other cultivators wouldn't see?</p><p>"The tablet, while a treasure, we now know requires Qingluan bloodline to control. It seems to be in the right hands now.</p><p>"It was I who brought it up at the Feather King's palace, and everyone has reached a consensus to explore the Ziwei Palace together. As long as it's not a blood feud, everything can be resolved.</p><p>"The tablet is shattered, and the Qingluan power sealed within has been refined by you. It's a done deal; we can't ask you to give it back…"</p><p>Pursuit snorted, but did not stop the Serpent King.</p>
