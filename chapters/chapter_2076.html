<h1>Chapter 2067: The Tainted Lands</h1><p>Yuan Miao was slightly startled. Qin Sang had been entirely on the defensive until now, a perfectly normal reaction.  Faced with the relentless onslaught of the Zhuyan Clan, most could only barely parry the attacks. It wasn't that they didn't want to counterattack, but rather that they had no opportunity.</p><p>Unexpectedly, his opponent had been holding back all along!</p><p>The last word from Qin Sang's mouth seemed to echo right beside his ear.</p><p>Only then did Yuan Miao sense the imminent danger. A streak of azure lightning filled his vision, impossibly swift, as if piercing the void itself in an instant and closing in on him. He reacted instantly, thrusting his crimson demonic staff across his chest.  The next moment, a ferocious impact slammed into him like a mountain, shaking his body and plunging his world into darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang's spirit tablet, now like a massive stone slab, pressed down on him, held firmly in place by the crimson demonic staff.  The two spiritual treasures clashed violently, shaking the arena once more and bathing the battlefield in shimmering, otherworldly light.</p><p>Yuan Miao, with his rich combat experience and sharp spiritual senses, had reacted with almost instinctive speed, managing to block the blow just in time. Anyone else, though not necessarily defeated on the spot, would likely have lost the initiative in that instant.</p><p>He channeled his Qi and blood with all his might, his arms trembling as he forced the spirit tablet back slightly. He retreated rapidly, trying to gain some breathing room. But before he could steady himself, pressure descended from above.</p><p>Helpless, Yuan Miao could only raise his staff to block the blow.</p><p>With a resounding boom, Yuan Miao was slammed heavily to the ground. He managed to maintain his footing, but his feet sank deep into the arena floor.</p><p>The Zhuyan Clan valued their arena greatly. Constructed from incredibly durable spiritual materials and inscribed with restrictive formations, it was further reinforced by a powerful grand array.  Even the fierce battle between the two had failed to damage it, yet now two deep footprints marred its surface.</p><p>Yuan Miao was about to repeat his tactic, but the spirit tablet brushed against his staff and instantly retreated.  The next attack came from behind before he could even shift his feet.  He was forced to twist his demonic staff awkwardly to deflect the blow.</p><p>The ensuing scene gave Si Lu and the other spectators a sense of deja vu. They had just witnessed this, only with the roles reversed.</p><p>Now, it was Yuan Miao on the receiving end. Against Qin Sang's tempestuous assault, he seemed capable only of defense.  His feet trapped in the ground, he couldn't even pull them free. Qin Sang hammered him relentlessly, blow after blow, driving him deeper and deeper until his lower legs were almost buried.</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Miao felt an overwhelming sense of frustration. This was his preferred fighting style, yet his opponent was now using it against him.</p><p>Qin Sang’s combat prowess was far more versatile than he had anticipated.  Being skilled in遁术 (escape techniques) was one thing, but integrating it seamlessly into combat was another entirely.</p><p>Especially in a clash between two strength cultivators engaged in close-quarters combat, the slightest shift could change everything.  No matter how good one's escape techniques, they might not be of much use. Misused, they could lead to a loss of coordination, exposing weaknesses for the opponent to exploit. Yuan Miao had been waiting for such an opportunity.</p><p>However, judging by Qin Sang’s performance, he had no such concerns. He wasn’t even employing any particularly sophisticated divine abilities or combat techniques. Relying solely on his Thunder Escape Technique and that spirit tablet, he had Yuan Miao completely pinned down.</p><p>Yuan Miao had sensed Qin Sang channeling the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, but he hadn’t imagined its power could be so formidable.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>Yuan Miao felt himself sink another inch. He was like a wooden stake, and Qin Sang was the one driving it into the ground.</p><p>This situation had to change!</p><p>Unable to find an opening, Yuan Miao was forced to create one himself. His mind raced, and the blood flames enveloping him erupted violently.</p><p>He threw back his head, his hair standing on end, as if transforming into a raging inferno.</p><p>Points of blood-red light sparked within the flames, coalescing at his brow into a blossoming blood flower. The flower then underwent a bizarre transformation, ultimately condensing into a small, intricate blood seal that flashed into Yuan Miao’s forehead.</p><p>A low growl echoed across the battlefield, like the roar of a primeval demonic ape resounding through the ages.</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhuyan Clan expert felt their hearts pound in their chests, their own battle lust stirred by the sound. The Zhuyan Clan expert leaped up and squatted on his perch, scratching his ears and cheeks, gazing at the arena with an impatient fervor, itching to take Yuan Miao's place.</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn’t completely lost his senses. He glanced at Ji Hong, his eyes filled with a challenging glint, eager to test his strength.</p><p>Sensing danger, Ji Hong quickly hid under Si Lu’s collar.</p><p>Meanwhile, the battlefield had transformed. Yuan Miao’s eyes snapped open, their pupils crimson and radiating a ferocious aura, as if he had truly become a demonic ape.</p><p>He pointed his crimson demonic staff skyward.  A thread of bewitching crimson light surfaced on its surface, then melted away, instantly splitting into a thousand phantom images.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze hardened. In his eyes, the phantom images vanished, leaving only a single crimson demonic staff thrusting straight at his face.</p><p>This strike was profoundly mysterious.  Qin Sang couldn’t comprehend how Yuan Miao had done it. Had he predicted his landing spot in advance? Or was this attack unavoidable, regardless of where he appeared?</p><p>Regardless, the moment Qin Sang materialized, the crimson demonic staff was already upon him, leaving him no room to evade.</p><p>He made a decisive move, instantly breaking off his attack. With a powerful flap of his phoenix wings, he retreated from the battlefield.</p><p>A sharp gust of wind grazed his face. Yuan Miao hadn't landed a hit, but he had achieved his objective.  He launched himself from the ground, escaping the pit.  He flipped in midair, carrying his momentum into a counterattack.</p><p>Faced with the descending crimson demonic staff, Qin Sang chose to evade once more, but this time only to create distance between himself and Yuan Miao. Then, transforming into a streak of lightning, he closed in on Yuan Miao’s flank from an incredibly刁钻 (tricky/perilous) angle.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Their weapons clashed, and both figures shuddered from the impact. Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed slightly.  Yuan Miao was clearly more composed now. Before the power of that blood seal faded, it seemed unlikely he could suppress him as before.</p><p>As he pondered this, Qin Sang’s afterimage shattered under the demonic staff. He had already reappeared elsewhere, his spirit tablet flashing as he attacked once more.</p><p>With a series of resounding clashes, the two were locked in combat again. However, this time the fight wasn’t confined to a single spot. Their figures flickered across the entire arena. If not for the constraints of the spiritual array, they would likely have been battling in the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang still seemed to be focusing on evasion and relentless attacks, but his strategy had changed. He no longer sought to pin down his opponent, instead maximizing the advantage of his escape techniques, searching for weaknesses amidst the flurry of movements.</p><p>Yuan Miao responded in kind. He might not be able to catch Qin Sang, but Qin Sang would always attack.  As long as he responded perfectly in the moment of contact, Qin Sang wouldn’t be able to gain the upper hand.</p><p>On the northern side of the arena, there was a peak, slightly shorter than the one they fought on, with a smaller arena atop it.</p><p>At some point, the formations on this arena had also been activated, but there was no fight taking place, only a single figure.</p><p>This person, clad in white robes, with golden pupils hidden beneath, stood with his hands clasped behind his back, his gaze fixed on the opposite arena.</p><p>Even the grand array could not block his vision.  As he watched the fierce battle unfold, a strange light flickered in his golden eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yuan Miao seemed oblivious, their focus entirely on each other. After a furious exchange, neither had managed to gain the upper hand, but both were searching for an opportunity.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Another clash, equally matched as before, and their figures separated once again.</p><p>Just then, a glint flashed in Yuan Miao’s eyes.</p><p>An opportunity!</p><p>He had finally found it!</p><p>At the same moment, Qin Sang felt a strange premonition, a sense that something wasn’t right. He glanced at Yuan Miao, but his opponent, bathed in blood flames, appeared as before. Yet the unsettling feeling persisted.</p><p>He was certain that the blood flames had undergone some sort of change, but he couldn't understand why.</p><p>The next moment, his gaze sharpened in astonishment. Two new heads, identical to Yuan Miao's, had sprouted from his opponent’s back. Not only heads, but arms as well.  Even the crimson demonic staff had split into three.</p><p>“Three heads and six arms?”</p><p>Qin Sang immediately recognized this legendary technique.  He was finally witnessing it firsthand.</p><p>The newly formed limbs appeared somewhat illusory, not yet fully solidified, but Yuan Miao’s aura had undeniably reached a new level.</p><p>*Swish, swish, swish!*</p><p>Not giving Qin Sang a chance to analyze the technique, the three demonic staffs lashed out simultaneously.</p><p>Three streaks of crimson light tore through the void, their power enough to shatter mountains and split the earth.  Finally, they converged right in front of Qin Sang, merging into a single, earth-shattering demonic staff shadow.</p><p>In that instant, the shadow engulfed every corner of the arena. Beneath the demonic staff, all would be reduced to dust. Even with Qin Sang’s unparalleled escape techniques, there was nowhere to hide!</p><p>As the demonic staff slammed down, Qin Sang’s expression hardened.  He formed a hand seal, and a burst of golden light erupted skyward. A golden sun rose behind his head.</p><p>The Sun Wheel Seal was a secret transmission of the Buddhist Vajra lineage. The original purpose of this seal was to cultivate the physical body, but Qin Sang, cultivating both his Dharma and physical body, had elevated its power to another level.</p><p>Even without employing his Dharma Body, activating this seal with pure physical power unleashed formidable might.</p><p>The golden sun shone brightly, forcing back the surging blood Qi.</p><p>A sense of foreboding gripped Yuan Miao, but his attack was already in motion. There was no turning back.  It all came down to who was stronger!</p><p>The golden sun positioned itself directly in the path of the demonic staff. Two immense forces collided in a blinding flash.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A wave of dazzling golden light swept across the arena, engulfing Qin Sang, Yuan Miao, the golden sun, and the demonic staff.</p><p>The arena was bathed in resplendent gold.</p><p>The next moment, a crimson staff shadow emerged from the heart of the golden light, like a crack appearing on the surface of the sun.</p><p>Suddenly, both the golden sun and the staff shadow shattered.  The residual waves of energy, still immense, battered against the grand array.</p><p>Only a transparent barrier separated the viewing platform from the grand array.  Under the relentless assault of the aftershocks, the barrier trembled, seemingly on the verge of collapse, as if the golden waves would spill over at any moment.</p><p>Ji Hong retreated further into Si Lu’s collar, and the Zhuyan Clan expert shrank back, his battle lust completely extinguished.</p><p>The powerful aftershocks lingered, punctuated by the continued thud of impacts from within, indicating that the fight was far from over.</p><p>Yuan Miao’s three heads and six arms remained, wielding the demonic staff with impeccable defense, giving Qin Sang no openings. But he couldn’t overcome Qin Sang either.</p><p>After exchanging several more blows, Yuan Miao suddenly withdrew his divine ability. With a tap of his foot, he leaped out of the fray, exclaiming, “I concede! I concede!”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his spirit tablet shrinking back to the size of his palm.  His phoenix wings folded as he slowly descended to the ground.</p><p>“I can’t hurt you, but you might be able to hurt me!  I’ll give you this one! I concede!  I concede!”</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his hands repeatedly, a look of frustration on his face.</p><p>Indeed, even if they continued, neither might be able to defeat the other. But as he said, Qin Sang did have the potential to injure him, while he had yet to find a way to counter Qin Sang’s escape techniques.</p><p>In that sense, admitting he was slightly inferior wasn’t entirely unreasonable.</p><p>The Zhuyan Clan were warlike, but once they recognized the situation, they accepted defeat gracefully.  They wouldn’t stubbornly cling to a lost cause.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and said, “Fellow Daoist, you are too kind.”</p><p>He had concealed his true strength, but this certainly wasn’t the full extent of Yuan Miao's abilities either. Some techniques simply weren’t suitable for use in the arena, as this was not a fight to the death.</p><p>“I will find a way to counter your escape techniques sooner or later!” Yuan Miao grumbled stubbornly, glaring at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. He didn't dislike this kind of temperament. He cupped his hands and said, “I await your challenge, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>“Just you wait!”</p><p>Yuan Miao spat out a parting threat, then with a flick of his sleeve, deactivated the spiritual array.</p><p>Si Lu flew over, a look of awe in his eyes as he looked at Qin Sang.  He knew that Qin Sang’s greatest strength lay in his Dharma Body.  He hadn't expected him to defeat Yuan Miao with only strength-based divine abilities.</p><p>Ji Hong’s eyes shone even brighter, his small face filled with admiration.  “Qin Huwei, you’re so strong!”</p><p>“I keep my word. From now on, aside from a few forbidden areas of our clan, the three of you are free to come and go as you please. No one will give you any trouble…”</p><p>Yuan Miao flicked his sleeve, and three streaks of light shot out, transforming into three crimson jade tokens.</p><p>“Many thanks, Fellow Daoist Yuan.”</p><p>The three of them sensed Yuan Miao’s Qi on the crimson jade tokens.  They cupped their hands in thanks and each put away a token.</p><p>Yuan Miao glanced towards the mountains beyond.  “As we agreed, there are many dangerous places near our clan’s territory.  Even the tribes living nearby rarely venture close. If you wander in and die there, you can’t blame anyone but yourselves.”</p><p>“Thank you for the warning, Fellow Daoist. We understand the risks,” Si Lu replied, cupping his hands.</p><p>Judging by their expressions, Yuan Miao knew they hadn't taken his words to heart.  He snorted and said, “Don’t think I’m exaggerating. Our territory is unlike any other. To the east, there’s a place where tainted Qi converges.  Do not approach it.”</p><p>Ji Hong and Si Lu hadn’t reacted yet, but Qin Sang’s eyes flashed.  “Tainted Qi?”</p><p>Yuan Miao nodded. “The origin of this Qi is unknown, but it can taint all things, leaving nothing untouched.  It's extremely dangerous for cultivators like us.  Its intensity fluctuates. While it may appear calm during its ebb, once the tainted Qi surges, it consumes everything. Even a great power might not escape unscathed!”</p><p>Taints all things, leaving nothing untouched…</p><p>The more Qin Sang listened, the more he felt this tainted Qi resembled the Six Heavens Ancient Qi from the River of Misfortune.</p><p>He had been in the Great Thousand World for quite some time, traveling across several celestial provinces, but he had never heard any rumors of the River of Misfortune.</p><p>He suspected that the River of Misfortune might exist in another form, hidden from the mortal world, imperceptible to ordinary people, detectable only by great powers.</p><p>Could it be that a section of the River of Misfortune was manifesting here?</p><p>Qin Sang had always suspected that the Storm Realm’s Abyss might be situated above the River of Misfortune. If so, the emergence of the Storm Realm, expelled by the River of Misfortune and landing here, would make sense.</p><p>“I’ve said all I need to say. You’re free to go now!”</p><p>Yuan Miao waved his sleeve, making a gesture of dismissal.</p><p>Qin Sang and Si Lu exchanged a glance. They couldn’t very well press him further, so they cupped their hands and took their leave.</p><p>Once the three figures disappeared into the mountains, Yuan Miao withdrew his gaze and looked towards the neighboring peak.  His figure flickered, and he vanished, reappearing inside.  He asked, “When did Brother Yuan arrive?”</p>
