<h1>Chapter 1121: Imperial Flowing Liquid</h1><p>“No…”</p><p>Qin Sang, sparing no effort, used a secret technique and commanded the Sky-Eye Butterfly to fully activate its Sky-Eye ability.</p><p>She vaguely saw that as the final thunderbolt struck, golden lights suddenly appeared in the air alongside it.</p><p>These golden lights were extraordinary, soft as water, gently rippling and coalescing in the air like countless olives, with countless golden threads interwoven and hanging down.</p><p>Seeing this, Bai sighed softly, “So that’s it!”</p><p>“Imperial Flowing Liquid!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face was full of shock, “How could there be Imperial Flowing Liquid!”</p><p>Imperial Flowing Liquid is a divine substance born from heaven and earth when a demonic beast undergoes its transformation tribulation.</p><p>It resembles countless olives, with myriad golden threads intertwined and cascading down to the mortal world.</p><p>Legend has it that Imperial Flowing Liquid is an indispensable substance for a demonic beast's transformation, capable of enlightening ordinary beasts and directly awakening their intelligence.  It's something countless demonic beasts yearn for.</p><p>However, the sight above Spirit Island was far less spectacular than the legends described. The Imperial Flowing Liquid only fully forms after the tribulation, and this is just the beginning.</p><p>But Yun Youzi is clearly human, why is there Imperial Flowing Liquid?</p><p>While Qin Sang was puzzled, she noticed a bright white light rising beneath the bluish-green thunder.</p><p>At the center of the white light was a pearl.</p><p>The Immaculate Pearl!</p><p>All of Yun Youzi's treasures had been destroyed in the tribulation, and even the Three Lights Jade Liquid was exhausted, leaving only this pearl.</p><p>Under the thunder, Yun Youzi was covered in wounds.</p><p>His eyes, however, remained resolute.</p><p>Until the very end, he would not give up!</p><p>Within the Immaculate Pearl, there was a faint bamboo shadow.</p><p>The pearl floated before Yun Youzi's chest, inseparable from him. The pearl radiated light, directly confronting the thunder!</p><p>The next moment, the white light suddenly dissipated.</p><p>The Immaculate Pearl shattered under the thunder.</p><p>A remaining glimmer of light illuminated Yun Youzi’s face.</p><p>His expression was calm, without resentment.</p><p>The bluish-green thunder engulfed Yun Youzi. The lingering power of the tribulation fiercely struck the solitary peak!</p><p>The Imperial Flowing Liquid, which was in the process of forming, suddenly vanished, leaving only a strange sweet fragrance lingering in the air.</p><p>In an instant, the clouds dispersed.</p><p>After brewing the final thunderbolt, the tribulation clouds dissipated into thin air.  The overwhelming dark clouds also scattered with the wind, and rays of sunlight pierced through the clouds, bringing light.</p><p>The storm subsided, and the waters quickly returned to calm, as if nothing had ever happened.  The celestial phenomenon disappeared, returning to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang, already frantic with worry, immediately summoned her flying light and rushed towards Spirit Island.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the white crane into the Mixed Yuan Heart Ring, and Bai entered the Corpse Puppet Bag.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang seemed to sense something, her gaze rising as she glared at the lake water in the distance and shouted angrily, “Looking for death!”</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Three-colored遁光 appeared on her body.</p><p>Her cultivation base had improved significantly, and her escape technique had progressed further. Qin Sang transformed into a streak of light, as swift as lightning.  In a few flashes, she appeared on the other side of the water, then reversed her Ebony Sword, the sword light bursting forth as she fiercely stabbed into the water!</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Water splashed.</p><p>The Ebony Sword returned, and without looking back, Qin Sang turned and rushed towards Spirit Island.</p><p>Shortly after Qin Sang left, streams of blood suddenly bubbled up from the water.</p><p>The next moment, pieces of flesh floated to the surface, staining a large area of water red.</p><p>The smell of blood was pungent and nauseating.</p><p>This was a Ghostfish that had recently broken through to the Demon Core stage.  Under the might of the tribulation, it had been hiding at the bottom of the lake, trembling. Sensing the aura of the Imperial Flowing Liquid, it couldn't resist its greed and came out to spy, only to lose its life.</p><p>Qin Sang showed no mercy, without even seeing what it was, directly using the sword wheel to shred the Ghostfish into minced meat.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two people returned to the island one after the other.</p><p>Spirit Island was in ruins.</p><p>The solitary peak was riddled with holes, its top cut off, leaving a large crater.</p><p>Qin Sang was the first to reach the peak, her eyes filled with anxiety.  After a quick glance, she was relieved to find a figure in the crater—Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi sat on the ground, severely wounded, his breath extremely weak, but he was alive!</p><p>“Senior, you have passed the tribulation?”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and asked with concern.</p><p>After the thunder tribulation, there should be a heart demon tribulation to follow.</p><p>Yun Youzi's current expression and eyes didn’t seem to be affected by a heart demon.</p><p>It is said that when the heart demon tribulation arrives, the person undergoing the tribulation may feel that decades or even centuries have passed, but in reality, it's only a fleeting moment.</p><p>Given Yun Youzi's willpower, overcoming the heart demon tribulation should not be difficult.</p><p>So, it seems Yunyouzi likely survived the tribulation and successfully formed his Nascent Soul!</p><p>"Grandmaster!"</p><p>Li Yu-fu was overjoyed.</p><p>He had thought his Grandmaster had failed the tribulation.  Seeing him alive lifted his spirits immensely.</p><p>Upon seeing them, Yunyouzi’s eyes flickered.  He moved a finger, and a golden orb fell into his mouth and was swallowed.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the orb resembled the Emperor's Dew in color.</p><p>He looked around, but there was no sign of the Emperor's Dew.  Could it have been an illusion?</p><p>After swallowing the orb, Yunyouzi's breath steadied somewhat. He stood up and softly said, "Let's leave this place!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Yunyouzi's tribulation had been too spectacular; it might have alarmed powerful demons and cultivators nearby.</p><p>It was best to distance themselves from potential trouble.</p><p>Yunyouzi led the way, flying towards the north of the Spirit Island.</p><p>Qin Sang followed closely, protecting Yunyouzi.</p><p>He sensed that even after consuming the Emperor's Dew, Yunyouzi was still very weak.</p><p>For some reason, Qin Sang felt that Yunyouzi seemed strangely off, though he couldn't pinpoint why.</p><p>Yunyouzi remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang could only suppress his doubts.</p><p>"Junior Brother, do you still have the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid?  I haven't yet fulfilled my promise to refine the Fate-Defying Pill for you," Yunyouzi suddenly said.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  "Senior, the pill refinement can wait.  You can refine the Fate-Defying Pill after your injuries have healed."</p><p>His uneasy feeling intensified.</p><p>Li Yu-fu also sensed something was amiss; the joy on his face froze.</p><p>"Alas, I forcibly used the Emperor's Dew to stay alive. I'm afraid I won't live to see that day…" Yunyouzi sighed.</p><p>Before he finished, Yunyouzi suddenly changed direction, landing on a deserted island.  </p><p>Unbeknownst to Qin Sang, Yunyouzi had secretly established a cave dwelling there.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily caught up, exclaiming, "Senior, you…"</p><p>"I haven't much time left. I'll explain later, cough…"</p><p>Yunyouzi's breath faltered. Without further ado, he took the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid and other medicinal herbs, and said to Li Yu-fu, "Yu-fu, refining the Fate-Defying Pill demands extremely high skill from the alchemist, not unlike refining Nascent Soul-level elixirs; it will greatly benefit you. Your current skill is insufficient; memorize the process later… Follow me."</p><p>Li Yu-fu's eyes reddened slightly. He glanced at Qin Sang and silently followed Yunyouzi into the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang stood dumbfounded outside the cave.</p><p>He sensed something was wrong but didn't want to believe it.</p><p>Qin Sang waited outside the cave for a long time. There was still no sound from within. His mind was in turmoil, and he paced back and forth in front of the cave.</p>
