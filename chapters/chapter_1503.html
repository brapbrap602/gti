<h1>Chapter 1494: The Grand Elder's Scheme (4k)</h1><p>Chapter 1494: The Grand Elder's Scheme (4k)</p><p>“To cultivate Ice Soul Divine Light to such a level at the early Yuan Ying stage is unprecedented.  I never thought you could actually do it, Bing Yao has given me a great gift.”</p><p>Yin Changsheng looked at Liuli with glee and excitement, a sinister smile playing on his lips, as if looking at a rare and valuable treasure.  He made no attempt to hide his elation.</p><p>Whether he felt confident of victory and saw no need for pretense, or whether Tong Lingyu's words had struck true – he had succumbed to demonic influence and fallen into madness, unable to maintain composure.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang and Liuli exchanged a glance, understanding Yin Changsheng's intentions.  Simultaneously, they both thought of the same event.</p><p>During the wedding ceremony, Shang Lu, disregarding his status as a patriarch, staged a dramatic wedding snatching.</p><p>Everyone, including Qin Sang and Liuli, believed Shang Lu's goal was to test Qin Sang.  Little did they know, he used the Cleansing Pool as a mere pretext, his true aim being to force Liuli to act, testing her mastery of this divine ability.</p><p>Tong Lingyu, despite her elaborate preparations, had been utterly defeated. Yin Changsheng certainly had accomplices.</p><p>Shang Lu was one of them!</p><p>At the time, their focus was on concealing Qin Sang's strength. They hadn't anticipated Shang Lu's ulterior motives. His actions were incredibly deceptive; even Tong Lingyu hadn't seen through him, let alone them.</p><p>“And you!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng's gaze fell upon Qin Sang.  “Your spirit sense takes shape at the mid-Yuan Ying stage!  What's more, you are Dao companions! You two, a pair of inseparable souls, barely meet the requirements of the Yin-Slaughtering Blood Pool. Heaven has been kind to me, sending me two geniuses at the last moment, haha…”</p><p>Yin Changsheng burst into laughter, his echoing laughter reverberating through the cavern.  His goal was near, and he felt immense satisfaction.</p><p>But to Qin Sang, it sounded even more like madness.</p><p>Three ice platforms in the Yin-Slaughtering Blood Pool.</p><p>The final ice platform was intended to ensnare him and Liuli.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to tell Yin Changsheng that he and Liuli were a false couple, their bond forged through a forbidden cultivation technique, and thus might not meet the requirements. But he knew Yin Changsheng wouldn’t listen.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang and Liuli never imagined that a single transaction would leave behind a fateful curse, binding their destinies together for centuries, its repercussions still felt today.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's certainty implied he had long since discovered his identity.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't recall when he had been exposed.</p><p>During his confrontation with Shang Lu, Qin Sang had carefully concealed his powerful spiritual sense.</p><p>However, the Thousand Fox Mask was not an ultimate treasure. Shi Xue had warned him that a determined individual, using special abilities or artifacts, could potentially see through it.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang had ascended Lingxiao Peak, bringing him close to the Palace Mistress.</p><p>“I have a question,”</p><p>Qin Sang, his heart on high alert, maintained a calm demeanor as he interrupted Yin Changsheng's laughter.</p><p>“I only met the Grand Elder over a decade ago.  I had never set foot in the Hidden Sun Realm before, and I’ve never met you, Senior. My entry into the Sacred Land was a spur-of-the-moment decision. Could you possibly have foreseen this?”</p><p>This was a genuine question for Qin Sang.</p><p>Based on Yin Changsheng's tone, while Liuli's divine ability was perfected, her cultivation was insufficient to meet the requirements of the Yin-Slaughtering Blood Pool. His pairing with Liuli as Dao companions was purely accidental.</p><p>Yin Changsheng couldn't have possibly started planning this a decade ago.</p><p>Without him, he wouldn’t have been able to fill all three ice platforms; would Yin Changsheng's efforts have been in vain?</p><p>Could he have waited another three hundred years for the next suitable person?</p><p>However, Qin Sang's real purpose in asking was to buy time.</p><p>He analyzed the situation; the chances of killing Yin Changsheng were slim.  If he could escape the cavern, his prospects would improve considerably.</p><p>His investigation of the ancient prohibitions within the cavern, aided by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, had yielded some clues. The weakness seemed to lie in the cavern's ceiling, but the restrictions there were also incredibly strong, requiring sufficient time to overcome.</p><p>Once outside, he might be able to involve the Hunmo Elder and the Great Peng Saint.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang was silently observing the blood pool.</p><p>If escape was impossible, he would have to fight.</p><p>Hitting the Palace Mistress with the Solar God Tree would be difficult, but it could force her to act to save someone.</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng undoubtedly placed great importance on the blood pool and likely had protective measures in place, so he couldn’t act rashly.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, considering every possibility.</p><p>“Without you two, I could only settle for a second-best option, capturing Hunmo and making him the third blood servant.  However, Hunmo isn’t a direct disciple of Xuan Tian Palace, so the effect would be greatly diminished.”</p><p>Yin Changsheng chuckled, his tone casual when mentioning this formidable figure from the demonic path.</p><p>“I didn't expect this kid to cause such a commotion, but it's inconsequential; just a bunch of rabble. Once I achieve the Transformation God stage, I’ll clean up the Sacred Land.”</p><p>It was him!</p><p>The Demon Elder was lured in by Yin Changsheng!</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace Master is the traitor!</p><p>After learning the functions of the Blood Pool and the Ice Platform, Qin Sang had already suspected something.  Hearing Yin Changsheng confirm it, he was speechless.</p><p>He wanted to curse.</p><p>On this trip to the Sacred Land, he had already shielded two people from disaster.</p><p>Bing Yao was one thing.  He couldn't resist the temptation of the Cleansing Pool, he himself triggered the trap for Bing Yao, he couldn't blame anyone else.</p><p>But he and the Demon Elder not only had no connection, they were enemies.</p><p>Taking the brunt of a disaster for his enemy was truly unjust.</p><p>"I…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, he opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>Yin Changsheng suddenly sneered, "Are you trying to stall for time?"</p><p>Before the words left his mouth,</p><p>The temperature in the cavern plummeted, a bone-chilling coldness permeated everywhere, terrifyingly so. Qin Sang felt his body and true energy about to freeze.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The ice spikes embedded in the ground rose from the earth, shattering mid-air into a pale, cold mist, further intensifying the chill.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.</p><p>At the same time, using the Tianmu Butterfly's divine ability, Qin Sang saw through the mist, discovering thirteen ice mirrors materializing on the cavern ceiling.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had brought them here, he was certainly prepared.</p><p>He’d used some earlier to capture Tong Lingyu.</p><p>The thirteen ice mirrors were part of it.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>The thirteen ice mirrors subtly turned, all aimed at him and Liuli.</p><p>"Be careful, this is one of the Palace Master's most powerful divine abilities, the Falling Nether Divine Ban!"</p><p>Liuli's warning rang out.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know what the Falling Nether Divine Ban was, but he reacted instinctively, activating the Ruyi Treasure Pearl, its protective energy shield enveloping him, and simultaneously summoning the Demon Fire, ready for battle.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang clearly see the mirrors.</p><p>The ice mirrors weren't crystalline; each one shone with special runes, forming patterns, similar to forbidden diagrams, a feeling of familiarity washing over Qin Sang.</p><p>At that moment, Tong Lingyu's warning came from the Lu Yin Blood Pool.</p><p>"Daoist, you need not fear. His Falling Nether Divine Ban and my Cold Nether Nine Bans share the same origin. Your spiritual fire can withstand this divine ability! This person, hiding in the ice coffin, using evil arts, has become demonic, he cannot act recklessly, otherwise he will destroy himself. Daoist, as long as you persevere, you can win without fighting!"</p><p>After the All Demons Conference, Tong Lingyu and Qin Sang sparred.</p><p>Confirming Qin Sang could counter her Cold Nether Nine Bans further solidified her determination to win him over.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's cultivation far surpassed Tong Lingyu's; the Falling Nether Divine Ban's power was naturally incomparable to the Cold Nether Nine Bans.</p><p>However, the spiritual fire's counter to the Falling Nether Divine Ban significantly weakened its power. Qin Sang at least had a fighting chance; he wouldn't fall to the Divine Ban immediately.</p><p>Hearing Tong Lingyu's warning, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>His biggest fear was not understanding his opponent.</p><p>If he just needed to hold out for a while, until Yin Changsheng lost control, with the Solar God Tree, there might be a chance.</p><p>He just didn't know how long that time would be!</p><p>‘Ding ding…'</p><p>The ice mirrors vibrated, emitting a clear, melodious sound.</p><p>Before Tong Lingyu finished speaking, the forbidden diagrams within the mirrors shot out, materializing in mid-air. The surrounding cold mist was drawn to the diagrams, rushing towards them frantically.</p><p>In an instant, the forbidden diagrams manifested in reality, their power awe-inspiring.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as if he had fallen into a small icy world controlled by Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Though it was an illusion, the terrifying pressure was real, stronger than Tong Lingyu's Cold Nether Nine Bans.</p><p>Qin Sang's body stiffened, his jaw clenched, he exerted all his strength to activate the Demon Fire.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Demon Fire split into two, one half flying towards Liuli.</p><p>In this situation, Qin Sang still split half of his Demon Fire to protect Liuli.</p><p>Following Tong Lingyu’s advice meant a tough battle, helping his companion was helping himself.</p><p>Liuli understood this, allowing the Demon Fire to transform into a fiery armor on her body, activating her Ice Soul Divine Light, working together with Qin Sang to resist the Falling Nether Divine Ban.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The forbidden diagrams, like ice mountains, pressed down.</p><p>The cavern shook violently.</p><p>Blinding cold light instantly enveloped them, the divine ban exploded!</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were at the vortex's center, almost invisible. Their fiery armor dimmed, making one worry they had been swallowed by the divine ban.</p><p>However, the actual situation wasn't bad.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire truly had a counter effect on the Falling Nether Divine Ban; the Divine Ban's strongest sealing ability failed to take full effect on them.</p><p>If this stalemate continued, it suited Qin Sang perfectly.</p><p>Unfortunately, Yin Changsheng wouldn't let them have their way.</p><p>"Hmm? Interesting. It seems I underestimated you."</p><p>Seeing that the Falling Nether God Ban hadn't restrained the two, Yin Changsheng narrowed his eyes, sizing up their fire armor. He gestured towards the ground.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Four serpentine talismans soared into the air.</p><p>The serpents writhed, their silent roar filling the air with the potent aura of a powerful spiritual treasure, shaking the very soul!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>Earlier, seeing the four serpentine talismans discarded near the blood pool as if they were trash, Qin Sang had assumed Yin Changsheng couldn't control this spiritual treasure.</p><p>It was said that the four serpentine talismans had always been wielded by the Grand Elder of Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Spiritual treasures, unlike magical artifacts, couldn't be refined by just anyone. Without understanding the treasure's incantation, they were useless in one's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood why Tong Lingyu had lost so badly.</p><p>Your spiritual treasure is given to you by others, what do you have to win with?</p><p>Meanwhile, the ice platforms in the blood pool creaked, and the two platforms occupied by Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun slowly sank towards the bottom of the pool, blood-red threads weaving a net around their bodies.</p><p>Tong Lingyu strained every ounce of her strength, unable to stop the blood threads from crawling up her neck.</p><p>It was as if countless blood-sucking insects were crawling on her snowy neck.</p><p>While Qin Sang had been buying time, Yin Changsheng had been subtly cooperating, setting the stage for the complete subjugation of Tong Lingyu and Luo Yun.</p><p>The physical form of the four serpentine talismans disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang saw a familiar sight.</p><p>Above the cavern, cold flames raged, blotting out the sun. From within the flames came strange, eerie roars—the serpentine forms of the talismans.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.</p><p>The piercing roars rose and fell; there was clearly more than one serpent.</p><p>The same spiritual treasure, in the hands of Tong Lingyu and Yin Changsheng, felt completely different.</p><p>Without even needing to fight, Qin Sang was certain that even if he used all his strength, unleashing his magic banner and sword formation, he wouldn't stand a chance against Yin Changsheng's four serpentine talismans!</p><p>He had to use the Solar God Tree!</p><p>Qin Sang grew anxious. He had to conserve his spiritual energy to resist the Falling Nether God Ban; using it once was already his limit; his transformed self could only act twice more.</p><p>Three chances; he had to blast open an escape route, or shatter the blood pool!</p><p>The serpentine figures flickered in and out of the cold flames.</p><p>He could no longer hide.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang reached for his Qianjun Ring, intending to summon the Solar God Tree…</p><p>The blood in the pool churned, and Tong Lingyu, about to be sucked into the depths, used her last ounce of strength to shout, “Liuli, quickly use the treasure incantation I taught you!”</p><p>When fighting Yin Changsheng, Tong Lingyu had learned that the treasure's incantation was divided into upper and lower halves.</p><p>Yin Changsheng possessed the complete incantation, but only gave her the upper half.</p><p>The four serpentine talismans remained firmly in Yin Changsheng’s control.</p><p>As soon as she made her move, Tong Lingyu suffered a major setback.</p><p>However, Tong Lingyu wasn't entirely unaware.  Her hesitation to act stemmed from her suspicion that Yin Changsheng might have tampered with the spiritual treasure to counter her.</p><p>She understood better than anyone the terrifying power of a great cultivator wielding a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Having noticed the talismans' affinity for Liuli, Tong Lingyu secretly passed on the incantation.</p><p>Now, with her Ice Soul Divine Light cultivated to its peak, she had the qualifications to make the four serpentine talismans willingly submit!</p><p>Learning of Liuli’s mastery at the wedding ceremony filled Tong Lingyu with joy.  Giving the four serpentine talismans to Liuli for refinement had a high chance of gaining the treasure's acknowledgement.</p><p>However, once a spiritual treasure acknowledged its master, unless the master's mark was erased, others, even those who had practiced the incantation, would suffer a significant reduction in power if they forcibly used it – Tong Lingyu would lose her strongest weapon.</p><p>At the time, the Great Saint Tianpeng was leading the demon race to wreak havoc, and Tong Lingyu was overwhelmed; she needed the ability to deal with demon saints.</p><p>Liuli's cultivation was insufficient; her control over the treasure, and therefore its power, would be limited.  Moreover, gaining the treasure's acknowledgement wasn't instantaneous; it required time for refinement.</p><p>She had planned to wait until her return from the Sacred Land, when she would decide whether to use the four serpentine talismans against Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Now it was too late to regret.</p><p>The treasure hadn't yet chosen a master.</p><p>Even the most compatible person needed to refine it to gain its acknowledgement; it was impossible to simply seize it from someone else during a battle – otherwise, who would dare use a spiritual treasure?</p><p>Fortunately, Liuli had practiced the upper half of the incantation and refined the four serpentine talismans for a while, and the treasure had a strong affinity with her.  While she couldn't claim it immediately, she could still restrain Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Suppressing his abilities, restraining his treasure.</p><p>Hope flickered in Tong Lingyu's eyes.  Her preparations, though failing to kill Yin Changsheng, had proven crucial!</p><p>Her hope rested on Qin Sang and Liuli!</p><p>While Liuli didn't fully understand, upon hearing Tong Lingyu's instructions, she immediately executed the incantation!</p>
