<h1>Chapter 788: Enlightenment in Battle</h1><p>The two swordsmen's techniques were exquisite, but their power wasn't overwhelming. Qinsang defeated them without much effort. Unlike puppets, they didn't have any obvious weak points, and Qinsang treated them as living opponents.</p><p>However, as soon as these two fell, two more swordsmen leaped from the wall, giving Qinsang no time to recover.</p><p>With his retreat cut off, Qinsang understood he had to press forward relentlessly.</p><p>Sword light crisscrossed within the long corridor.</p><p>Qinsang's breathing grew heavy, but his eyes shone brighter.</p><p>Having fought over a dozen battles, Qinsang advanced step by step into the corridor, only able to move forward. The darkness at the end of his vision gradually receded, but he still couldn't see what lay ahead.</p><p>The swordsmen's strength increased with each encounter, at a steady pace. Sometimes their swordsmanship improved, sometimes their cultivation. Qinsang could only rely on his own sword skills and supernatural powers, as his magical treasures remained sealed.</p><p>He had a premonition that he wouldn't reach the end of the corridor before being defeated.</p><p>He didn't know what awaited him then.</p><p>He had tried everything, but the restrictions within the corridor remained impenetrable.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Two more swordsmen jumped down, wielding sword techniques unlike any he had seen before.</p><p>Each swordsman used only one technique, but each was incredibly refined. Any sword cultivator who walked this sword path would undoubtedly see a significant improvement in their skills.</p><p>These swordsmen were his opponents, yet also his teachers.</p><p>Qinsang could clearly feel his own understanding deepening through the battles. However, burdened by an unknown fate, he couldn't feel any joy.</p><p>"These two swordsmen fighting together are almost as strong as me!"</p><p>Sensing the power of their sword auras, Qinsang's heart sank. He knew he couldn't go much further.</p><p>Yet, his movements remained unaffected.</p><p>His Ebony Sword trembled slightly, emitting a clear ringing sound. Then, it transformed into a streak of lightning, erupting with extreme speed before the two swordsmen could combine their attack, closing in on one of them instantly.</p><p>These swordsmen were practically perfect cultivators of the sword. They knew no fear, their emotions unwavering, able to react optimally to any attack.</p><p>But against the Thunderclap Sword Art, this swordsman was still too slow.</p><p>His sword momentum had barely begun to build when the Ebony Sword, striking after him but arriving first, shattered it.</p><p>A lotus-shaped sword aura before the swordsman was pierced by a bolt of lightning. The Ebony Sword's momentum continued unabated, instantly piercing through the swordsman's chest. With a slight twist, it shot towards the other swordsman.</p><p>The mortally wounded swordsman froze, his sword aura dissipating. He sheathed his sword, bowed to Qinsang, and transformed into a ball of green light, vanishing silently.</p><p>The other swordsman didn't last much longer.</p><p>Immediately after, two more swordsmen leaped from the wall behind them.</p><p>As soon as they clashed, Qinsang's expression changed. They seemed to have anticipated his Thunderclap Sword Art. Before the Ebony Sword could strike, they joined forces, forming a defensive stance.</p><p>Their sword momentum was peculiar. Their spirit swords pointed together, and the surrounding sword aura resembled a tortoise shell, incredibly tight.</p><p>"This sword pathâ€¦"</p><p>Qinsang sighed helplessly. No matter what sword technique he used, the next enemy would inevitably counter it with a technique specifically designed to overcome his.</p><p>He hadn't expected even the Thunderclap Sword Art to be countered.</p><p>This time, Qinsang learned his lesson. He didn't rush to reveal his Sword Light Splitting technique. Instead, he employed the Thunderclap Sword Art, slowly maneuvering and wearing down the two opponents.</p><p>No matter how powerful a single sword technique was, it couldn't be without flaws.</p><p>From then on, he calmed his mind and engaged in protracted battles, patiently searching for ways to break through their defenses.</p><p>*Tap! Tap! Tap!*</p><p>Qinsang's footsteps echoed in the corridor. He walked slowly, but each step was firm.</p><p>During this process, Qinsang threw caution to the wind, completely forgetting everything else. His mind held only his sword, immersed in the way of the sword.  Unbeknownst to him, his swordsmanship was improving imperceptibly.</p><p>The sword techniques he had learned in the past were now merging, approaching a state of perfect harmony.</p><p>The Thunderclap Sword Art itself began to subtly evolve.</p><p>This pure sword duel was an experience unlike any Qinsang had ever had, and the gains were astonishing.</p><p>"No! Their strength has increased again!"</p><p>Qinsang's pupils constricted sharply.</p><p>The two newly appeared swordsmen also wielded the Thunderclap Sword Art, and they knew his weaknesses.</p><p>Having just defeated the previous two opponents, Qinsang hadn't even caught his breath when two flying swords, like lightning and thunder, attacked him from the left and right, leaving him momentarily unable to respond.</p><p>Helpless, Qinsang was forced to use his Sword Light Splitting technique.</p><p>He was already quite satisfied with having lasted this long.  Had he entered the corridor before these battles, he would have been defeated by the first few swordsmen.</p><p>The Ebony Sword split into two, but one of the sword lights didn't block the incoming flying sword. Instead, it launched a surprise attack on one of the opponents.</p><p>This tactic proved successful. Qinsang thrust both palms forward, his true essence vibrating as he used a Daoist art to block one sword. His Ebony Sword entangled the other flying sword, while the surprise attack succeeded, killing one of the swordsmen.</p><p>"Besides swordsmanship, any power of my own can be used: physical body, divine sense, Daoist arts... However, the power of Daoist arts is closely tied to true essence, making it difficult to surpass the limitations of cultivation. Perhaps divine sense and physical body could, but such secret techniques are extremely rare."</p><p>Qinsang gained another insight, although he hadn't specifically cultivated his physical body or divine sense.</p><p>Reaching this point, the pressure on Qinsang intensified dramatically, and the battles became even more arduous.</p><p>When the swordsmen began using the Sword Light Splitting technique, he was finally exhausted, his journey reaching its end.</p><p>Filled with frustration, Qinsang stared wide-eyed into the depths of the corridor. The darkness there had thinned, almost revealing what lay within, but he was about to face defeat.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A crescent-shaped sword aura flew towards his face.</p><p>Qinsang hurriedly raised his sword to block, but felt a sharp pain in his wrist as an immense force sent him flying, crashing against the wall.</p><p>Then, the swordsman appeared before Qinsang like a ghost, his attacks as fierce as a storm. Finally, gripping his sword with both hands, he poured all his strength into a devastating downward strike!</p><p>Death descended!</p><p>Qinsang's eyes widened in fury, letting out an inhuman roar. Throughout his cultivation journey, he had never given up, no matter the difficulty, and even in this desperate situation, he refused to yield.</p><p>He poured all his strength into raising his sword in defiance.</p><p>The next moment, a blinding sword light flashed before his eyes.</p><p>In that instant, Qinsang thought he was dead.</p><p>After a moment of disorientation, Qinsang felt no pain. Looking around, he found himself inexplicably transported back to the entrance of the corridor.</p><p>The swordsmen had vanished, and the corridor was peaceful, as if everything had been a dream.</p><p>Drenched in sweat, Qinsang quickly summoned his Ebony Sword to check it. Seeing it undamaged, he let out a sigh of relief, collapsing to the ground with a strained smile on his face.</p><p>After a brief period of recovery, Qinsang stood up, his expression calm once more. He gazed into the depths of the corridor, recalling his recent insights, then unhesitatingly stepped back inside.</p><p>He had to see what lay at the end of the corridor.</p><p>Moreover, Qinsang had a premonition that his swordsmanship was about to undergo a tremendous breakthrough.</p>
