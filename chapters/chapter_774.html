<h1>Chapter 766: Excitement</h1><p>This is the Great Rift Xiang Yi mentioned earlier, stretching across the path ahead, blocking the way.</p><p>The rift is extremely deep, its end unseen, the opposite shore invisible.  A constant stream of purple mist billows upward from below, creating an updraft; this is likely the source of the poisonous fog.</p><p>A wisp of Netherworld Demon Fire flickered in Qin Sang's palm, guiding them towards the heart of the rift.</p><p>Qin Sang crouched down and leaned forward slightly.</p><p>Immediately, a gust of air rushed towards him.  The impact caused Qin Sang's anti-venom armor to tremble.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and quickly retreated, looking at Fei Can with some worry.</p><p>This was only at the top of the rift, and the anti-venom armor was already trembling. To seek the Spirit Fire, they would have to descend along the cliff face, constantly facing the onslaught of the poisonous mist.</p><p>The poisonous mist below is even more terrifying.</p><p>If Fei Can couldn't withstand it, they might not even have a chance to escape.</p><p>Fortunately, Fei Can showed no signs of strain, opening its mouth to release a halo of light.  Qin Sang's anti-venom armor thickened by a layer, and he was safe.</p><p>"Be more careful next time!"</p><p>Qin Sang glared at Fei Can, relieved, and leaned forward again.</p><p>Fei Can blinked its small eyes, looking a little aggrieved.</p><p>This time, the purple mist's impact against the anti-venom armor was firmly blocked. Qin Sang leaned down, staring at the cliff below. He saw that the cliff face wasn't smooth, but rough and uneven, offering handholds. He nodded silently.</p><p>Carelessly plunging down into the rift's depths on a sword was certainly not feasible; a rapid descent would easily disturb the beasts.</p><p>The Purple Mist Wasteland is home to many beasts adapted to the poisonous fog; the rift certainly contains such creatures, and undoubtedly, the closer to the source of the poisonous fog, the stronger the beasts.</p><p>Xiang Yi mentioned that some speculated that a beast comparable to a transformed great demon lurked deep within the rift.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of the rift for a while, listening intently. Besides the whooshing sound of the surging poisonous mist, he heard no beastly roars; below was a profound silence.</p><p>He walked a distance to the left and right along the edge, finding that all areas were similar: the bottom was shrouded in chaos; descending from any point would be the same.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang had his two-headed… [missing character, assumed to be a creature] use the Unity Ring and cautiously began to descend into the rift.</p><p>The rocks on the cliff face were icy cold. Qin Sang used both hands and feet to climb down.</p><p>Few people ever came here, and there was no path; Qin Sang could only feel his way.</p><p>Initially, out of caution, Qin Sang slowed his pace, remaining vigilant.</p><p>After climbing a distance, seeing that there was no danger, and the rift being bottomless,  Qin Sang had to increase his speed as continuing at this rate would waste too much time.</p><p>"Almost a quarter of an hour, and still not at the bottom of the rift. The purple mist is getting thicker. At this point, I'm afraid Xiang Yi's bone lotus and the young man's jade bracelet wouldn't hold up, but Fei Can remains quite relaxed. What a pleasant surprise."</p><p>Qin Sang stepped on a rock, lifted his sleeve, and looked approvingly at Fei Can.</p><p>This experience had proven Fei Can's capabilities.  It's certain that a Poison Beast in the Yao Dan stage wouldn't be able to break through the anti-venom armor, but it remains unknown if it can withstand the intense poison of a transformed great demon.</p><p>Fei Can has just completed its third molting, and the anti-venom armor already has such power. If a suitable cultivation method can be found, there will surely be even greater surprises in the future.</p><p>After resting for a moment, Qin Sang continued to climb down.  After descending less than a few zhang, he suddenly stopped, looking in surprise at the lower right.</p><p>The purple mist surged, and a sturdy tree shadow was vaguely visible, growing horizontally on the cliff face.</p><p>This old tree seemed withered, without branches or leaves, only the trunk, but on its top, dozens of fruits hung, gently swaying in the poisonous mist.</p><p>"Are there spirit fruits growing in the Purple Mist Wasteland? Are they spirit fruits or poisonous fruits?"</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Fei Can.</p><p>In the Black Wind Valley underground palace, Fei Can was attracted to the Thousand-Handed Spider fruit and eagerly ate an unripe poisonous fruit, but now it showed no reaction.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, gazing at the old tree, carefully observing. It didn't seem to be guarded by any beast.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, silently approaching the tree.  Unexpectedly, as he moved sideways, he stopped abruptly, staring intently at the fruits on the treetop.</p><p>These weren't spirit fruits, but a type of ferocious bird.  Bat-like, they hung upside down from the branches, fast asleep!</p><p>Their wings were folded, their bodies round, rising and falling with the wind.  From a distance, they resembled spirit fruits, but were actually unknown ferocious birds, dozens of them.</p><p>Similar old trees seemed to be below.</p><p>Small size doesn't mean anything; Qin Sang didn't want to disturb these birds.</p><p>He held his breath, carefully retreated, and went around, discovering many more below, some hanging from trees, others from crevices in the rocks.</p><p>Cold sweat beaded on Qin Sang's forehead, and he became even more cautious.</p><p>Fortunately, such groups of monstrous beasts were rare.  After traveling a considerable distance, Qin Sang finally reached solid ground.</p><p>“Whew…”</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled, pricking up his ears. The surroundings remained eerily calm; the bottom of the chasm seemed even quieter than the top.</p><p>He tested the ground by pressing down; it was hard rock.</p><p>He summoned the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire again. The flames pointed clearly to the left front, flickering more excitedly than before – a stark contrast to its behavior on Cold Flame Island.</p><p>Confused, Qin Sang shook his head and put away the double-headed…[creature's name omitted, as it's unclear and potentially requires context]</p><p>Man and beast proceeded forward with utmost vigilance, silently.</p><p>The bottom of the chasm was far wider than he had imagined. Although Qin Sang was walking diagonally, he had covered a long distance and still hadn't reached the opposite cliff wall.</p><p>Guided by the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, Qin Sang moved cautiously through the toxic mist chasm, always paying close attention to Fei Can’s condition.</p><p>Fei Can was no longer at ease; it crouched on his sleeve, its expression grave, having already spat out several iridescent halos to reinforce its anti-toxin armor.</p><p>With each exhalation, Fei Can's eyes dimmed, seeming to approach its limit.</p><p>Suddenly, Fei Can hissed, scrambling from his sleeve onto Qin Sang's hand. It reared up, its eyes filled with urgent desire, its calls filled with longing.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised but quickly understood. Fei Can had sensed something beneficial nearby.</p><p>Something in the purple mist interested Fei Can?  Besides the Red Fire Gilded [item name or description needed for accuracy], the Thousand-Hand Spider Fruit and the妖兽毒丹 (monster venom pill) are all related to poison; it wasn't surprising that something in the purple mist wasteland would attract Fei Can.</p><p>Fei Can strained, pointing its plump body to the left, a different direction from Qin Sang's intended path.</p><p>Qin Sang looked left and right, pondering for a moment before deciding to find what Fei Can desired first.</p><p>Even if he found the spiritual fire, the chances of immediately subduing it were slim. At best, he could refine another fire pearl, a process requiring time and effort. However, finding something that could aid Fei Can's growth would yield immediate results.</p><p>Fei Can was already showing signs of strain.</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision, changing direction and quickening his pace. Fei Can immediately became excited.</p><p>Unhindered by monstrous beasts, Qin Sang's speed increased as he dashed across the open chasm. Fei Can’s body remained tense, working to maintain its anti-toxin armor—for Qin Sang, and for itself.</p>
