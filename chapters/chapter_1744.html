<h1>Chapter 1735: The White Chess Piece</h1><p>The group flew and talked.</p><p>True Person Bai Lu, along with the cultivators of the Lantou Sect, flew alongside them, the spirit fowl obediently following behind.</p><p>True Person Bai Lu still marveled, “Fellow Daoist Qin, your concealment technique is truly remarkable.  May I inquire as to which sect or school you hail from?”</p><p>Bao Zhengnan glanced at Qin Sang, seeing that he seemed lost in thought and showed no intention of deliberately hiding his identity, and so transmitted a message to True Person Bai Lu, offering a subtle warning.</p><p>He had a good relationship with True Person Bai Lu and didn't want to see him unknowingly speak carelessly and offend the True Monarch.  After all, Qin Sang would have to reveal himself upon reaching Tianxing Island.</p><p>A simple sentence, when transmitted to True Person Bai Lu, was like a clap of thunder.</p><p>True Person Bai Lu's face paled drastically.</p><p>The other Lantou Sect disciples were startled and suspicious upon seeing their usually composed Sect Master in such a state.</p><p>“This junior greets…”</p><p>As the leader of a sect, True Person Bai Lu quickly regained his composure and hurriedly offered a respectful greeting.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, preventing True Person Bai Lu from bowing, and said to the three, including Bao Zhengnan, “This humble Daoist has recalled a matter that requires a few days’ absence. I'm afraid I cannot continue traveling with you.”</p><p>Bao Xi asked in surprise, “What urgent matter does Fellow Daoist Qin have? Perhaps a disciple of the Four Saints Palace could assist you.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, “This is a personal matter of this humble Daoist’s and it’s inconvenient to trouble others. Rest assured, Fellow Daoist, I shall return shortly and won't delay the important event.”</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's resolve, the three, including Bao Zhengnan, said no more. They figured that with Qin Sang's cultivation level, he could travel freely anywhere within the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan glanced at True Person Bai Lu.  Recalling Qin Sang's strangely warm behavior upon meeting him, he had a vague inkling of the reason.</p><p>Sure enough, he then heard Qin Sang say to True Person Bai Lu, “Sect Master Bai Lu, this Qin wishes to visit Senior Official Yang.  Could you kindly introduce me?”</p><p>How could True Person Bai Lu refuse?</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly and departed with True Person Bai Lu, riding the wind.</p><p>…</p><p>Bidding farewell to the others, the two traveled northwest.</p><p>Without True Person Bai Lu’s guidance, Qin Sang still remembered the location of Lantou Island.</p><p>Seeing True Person Bai Lu’s nervous demeanor, Qin Sang took the initiative to start a conversation, learning about the changes that had occurred on Lantou Island over the years.</p><p>When the demonic races of the Demonic Sea invaded the Canglang Sea, they threw it into chaos. The combined forces of humans and witches, stationed on Tianxing Island, fought fiercely against the demonic races, desperately defending against the invaders.</p><p>The large islands in the eastern sea region were essentially all occupied by the demonic races, their landscapes utterly transformed, their cultivators displaced.</p><p>With the Lantou Sect guarding it, Lantou Island was able to resist the demonic incursions. The island’s terrain remained unchanged from Qin Sang’s last visit. However, after several centuries, the overall situation had drastically shifted.</p><p>Back then, Qin Sang had used the technique of the “Seed Embryo Demonic Fetus” to refine an avatar and almost joined a sect called the Smoke and Mist Pavilion, which now no longer existed.</p><p>It was said that the Smoke and Mist Pavilion suffered heavy casualties during a demonic incursion, unable even to maintain its mountain gate. The Lantou Sect intervened, merging the Smoke and Mist Pavilion with another similarly devastated sect, renaming it the Smoke and Cloud Lake.</p><p>He also learned of the whereabouts of an old acquaintance.</p><p>When his avatar joined the Lantou Sect, he befriended a female cultivator named Fang Ting.  This woman, possessing exceptional talent, lived up to expectations and had reached the Nascent Soul realm. Under her leadership, the Smoke and Cloud Lake flourished, but it did not revert its name back to the Smoke and Mist Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang did not fly directly to Lantou Island. First, he went to Dongming Island, near Lantou Island.</p><p>Half of the Star Platform had originally been stored within Dongming Island's Thunder Pool. Back then, during the Black Serpent Mountain cultivators' attack on Dongming Island, Qin Sang seized the opportunity to take the Star Platform.</p><p>The aftermath of that upheaval continued to this day. The Thunder Pool's Thunder Essence erupted, nearly destroying Dongming Island.</p><p>Since then, the island’s spiritual veins were severely damaged, and it could only be used as a medicinal field, cultivating low-grade spirit herbs.  Now, only a very small number of Lantou Sect disciples, having heard tales of the Dongming Island Dharma Assembly from their elders, knew that this inconspicuous small island was once a secret island jointly managed by various sects, holding a prominent position.</p><p>Qin Sang entered Dongming Island and effortlessly found a massive sinkhole, bottomless, appearing as if formed by the impact of underground fire veins.</p><p>All traces had been erased by the explosion.  Qin Sang swept his divine sense over it several times, finding no valuable information.</p><p>True Person Bai Lu, puzzled, cautiously asked, “What is True Monarch searching for?”</p><p>“There used to be a Thunder Pool on this island. Within the Thunder Pool was a stone platform.  Your sect should have obtained a secret technique from it, called the ‘Commanding Thunder Technique’…”</p><p>Qin Sang revealed the secrets of six hundred years ago, as if he had personally witnessed them.</p><p>His tone was calm, but True Person Bai Lu’s face changed several times, filled with astonishment and uncertainty. “How does True Monarch know so much about our sect's secrets?”</p><p>“That stone platform is now in this humble Daoist’s possession.”</p><p>Qin Sang admitted frankly, but did not explain the platform’s origins. He then asked, “Besides the ‘Commanding Thunder Technique’, did your sect obtain anything else from the Thunder Pool?”</p><p>Various conjectures flashed through True Person Bai Lu’s mind. He shook his head and replied, “Only this secret technique, which caused great calamity within our sect. Since True Monarch knows of the ‘Commanding Thunder Technique’, you should also know about the Douniu Peak incident from back then. The ‘Commanding Thunder Technique’ is still locked away in our sect. If True Monarch is interested, we will present it to you upon our return…”</p><p>As they spoke, they entered Lantou Island and flew directly towards the Lantou Sect’s mountain gate.</p><p>Familiar scenes came into view, evoking memories of the past.</p><p>True Person Bai Lu invited Qin Sang to sit in the main hall, instructing his disciples to serve tea, while he personally went to summon his junior brother, Yang.</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the spirit tea, took a sip, and sensed two auras approaching.  Then, True Person Bai Lu and a slender Daoist walked in.</p><p>“It really is him!”</p><p>Qin Sang recognized at a glance that the slender Daoist was the Daoist boy who had once been at Old Daoist Huayang’s side.  Time had passed, and this person was now a Nascent Soul cultivator, his temperament and physique drastically changed, though his facial features were still vaguely recognizable.</p><p>Senior Official Yang, having obviously been warned by True Person Bai Lu, behaved respectfully and quickly stepped forward to offer a greeting.</p><p>“Does True Monarch Qin know this junior?”</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, Senior Official Yang's face was full of confusion. He was certain he had never met this person.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, swept his hand across his face, and transformed into another youthful and tender face.  He sighed softly, “Senior Uncle Yang, do you still remember your disciple, Zhang Yue?”</p><p>Senior Official Yang's eyes widened, stunned.</p><p>“You… you… you…”</p><p>He lost his composure, pointing at Qin Sang, speechless.</p><p>Over the centuries, countless disciples had joined the Yin-Yang lineage, but Senior Official Yang always remembered this particular individual.  Zhang Yue, born with four spiritual roots, was seen by other cultivators as having no hope on the path of cultivation, yet he possessed exceptional talent in cultivating the “Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art,” and was thus accepted as a true disciple as an exception.</p><p>He personally presided over the initiation ceremony, and Zhang Yue was the first true disciple he had introduced to the sect.</p><p>After that great chaos, Zhang Yue disappeared, and he deeply lamented this loss. The sect suspected Zhang Yue and conducted a thorough investigation, which ultimately yielded no results.</p><p>Light flashed, and Qin Sang returned to his original appearance. He turned to the stunned True Person Bai Lu and said, “This humble Daoist has a matter to discuss with Senior Official Yang.”</p><p>True Person Bai Lu finally came to his senses and tactfully excused himself.  Before leaving, he handed Qin Sang a jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang's divine sense swept over it.  The jade slip contained the “Commanding Thunder Technique,” identical to the one he possessed.  That once formidable thunder technique had gradually become insufficient for his current level.</p><p>It seemed the Lantou Sect was unaware. To investigate the origins of the Star Platform, he could only go to the Wu God Continent.</p><p>Casually putting away the jade slip, Qin Sang gestured, taking the initiative, "Zhang Yue is me, but I am not Zhang Yue.  Senior Official Yang, you have shown me the grace of imparting the Dharma.”</p><p>Senior Official Yang sat down as instructed, his gaze fixed on Qin Sang. He had a vague understanding of what had transpired all those years ago, but it was truly difficult to accept that his old acquaintance had transformed into a Nascent Soul True Monarch!</p><p>Regardless of Senior Official Yang’s thoughts, Qin Sang retrieved an object, “Senior Official Yang, please examine this jade.”</p><p>He took out the crude jade he had obtained from the bell within the Lang Huan Blessed Land.</p><p>As soon as the crude jade appeared, Senior Official Yang felt a connection and his expression turned surprised.</p><p>“This humble Daoist obtained this jade by chance.  If it weren’t for the fact that I had condensed the Yin-Yang Armor, I would have missed it. Unfortunately, this jade holds no mystical properties in my hands.  Can Senior Official Yang discern anything different about it?”</p><p>As he spoke, he directly handed the crude jade to Senior Official Yang.</p><p>Senior Official Yang hesitated slightly, then took the jade, examining it in his hand.  He apologized and closed his eyes, silently circulating his cultivation technique.</p><p>In the next moment, Senior Official Yang's aura drastically changed, the Yin-Yang Qi within him flowing and transforming.</p><p>In Qin Sang’s eyes, Senior Official Yang, along with the area within a zhang's radius influenced by his aura, seemed to be divided into Yin and Yang, a rather wondrous sight.</p><p>Yin-Yang Qi converged in his palm, black and white distinct, supporting the crude jade, and seeping into it thread by thread.</p><p>Disappointingly, no matter how much Yin-Yang Qi was infused, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with the crude jade showing no reaction.</p><p>After a stick of incense burned.</p><p>Senior Official Yang ceased his cultivation and smiled wryly, “I can sense that this jade is deeply connected to our sect’s cultivation techniques, but I have exhausted all means and cannot perceive its mysteries. True Monarch should still remember that the ‘Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art’ originally only had the first level. Our ancestor, Daoist Yin-Yang, comprehended the Dao of Yin-Yang and supplemented the cultivation technique, thus establishing our Yin-Yang lineage. However, the parts supplemented by later generations, while not entirely diverging from the original intent, are certainly quite different.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>Senior Official Yang glanced at the crude jade with some reluctance.  "In my perception, it is only slightly clearer than True Monarch's.  The mystery should lie within the center of the crude jade. If one cultivates the true ‘Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art’, perhaps they could start from there and comprehend the mystical abilities of this jade.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and said, “Could Senior Official Yang allow this humble Daoist to examine the cultivation technique?”</p><p>To view another’s true inheritance was a somewhat excessive request.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Senior Official Yang agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Sang was taken aback.</p><p>Senior Official Yang flicked his finger, sending out a streak of light.  He looked at Qin Sang with an expectant expression, “Ancestor Daoist Yin-Yang was incredibly brilliant.  He deduced the fragmented scrolls and cultivated to the peak of the mid-Nascent Soul realm, yet he was ultimately stopped there, unable to break through in his entire life. Later generations have been unworthy, with no one achieving such accomplishments. The later realms are still blank. Moreover…”</p><p>Senior Official Yang’s face showed shame, “Our talents are inferior to our ancestor's. After forming our Nascent Soul, we felt numerous obstacles in our cultivation, even advancing to the mid-stage is extremely difficult.  This should be due to the flaws in the cultivation technique. However, deducing a cultivation technique is by no means easy.  I admit I lack such ability, and other Nascent Soul cultivators are unlikely to be able to do it either. True Monarch, with your profound Dharma power, perhaps you could…”</p><p>He looked at Qin Sang with anticipation. A Nascent Soul True Monarch was not easy to find, and it was rare that Qin Sang showed interest in this cultivation technique.</p><p>Qin Sang extended his divine sense into the streak of light, the complete “Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art” appearing in his mind.</p><p>Senior Official Yang continuously explained, helping him comprehend it.</p><p>In such a short time, even with Qin Sang's cultivation, it was difficult to thoroughly comprehend it. However, Qin Sang's path of cultivation was also vastly different from others, and he actually managed to discern something. He said in surprise, "This shouldn’t be a specialized Dharma cultivation technique, should it?"</p><p>Senior Official Yang's eyes lit up. He couldn't help but lean forward, his face filled with admiration. "True Monarch has discerning eyes. Our ancestor had the same thought back then, but unfortunately, he was unable to achieve it."</p><p>The first level of the “Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art” was complete.</p><p>Based on this, Daoist Yin-Yang deduced a Dharma cultivation technique that absorbed and released Yin-Yang Qi, refining Qi and comprehending the mysteries.</p><p>However, one must not forget that the first step of the “Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art” was to condense the Yin-Yang Armor within one’s Nascent Soul.</p><p>Qin Sang could barely be considered a cultivator of Essence, Qi, and Spirit.  He sensed the mysteries within it. The original cultivation technique was definitely not purely a Dharma cultivation path, but likely a path of dual cultivation of spirit and Dharma, with Yin and Yang complementing each other, or perhaps even more complex.</p><p>Ghost Mother had once said that cultivators in the world could be roughly divided into three categories based on Essence, Qi, and Spirit, but there were also those who did not belong to these three paths, or those who integrated them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to comment on the original cultivation technique, but he could see some of the principles in the part that Daoist Yin-Yang had comprehended, which was a pure path of Qi refinement.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang withdrew his divine sense and pointed out an area that needed improvement, which greatly delighted Senior Official Yang.</p><p>Looking at the joyful Senior Official Yang, Qin Sang suddenly said, “When Daoist Yin-Yang obtained the cultivation technique, were there any other objects nearby?”</p><p>Senior Official Yang's pupils constricted, and his smile faded.</p><p>Daoist Yin-Yang did not explicitly state how he obtained the "Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art", but he left behind a treasure related to the cultivation technique, mentioning that he relied heavily on this treasure to comprehend the later stages of the cultivation technique.  Unfortunately, he was unable to fully understand the mysteries of this treasure, and it only served as guidance before the Golden Core stage. The cultivation technique after the Nascent Soul stage was entirely deduced based on Daoist Yin-Yang's own talent.</p><p>This treasure was a white chess piece.</p><p>He was secretly shocked. Although he knew that Nascent Soul True Monarchs possessed vast supernatural powers, he did not expect Qin Sang to guess it based solely on the cultivation technique.</p><p>After hesitating, Senior Official Yang dared not conceal anything, “Yes!  But this object, like the crude jade, conceals its divine nature.  Successive generations of ancestors have been unable to explore its mysteries, and even Ancestor Daoist Yin-Yang only grasped a superficial understanding.”</p><p>He took out the white chess piece.</p><p>The chess piece was pure white with a warm luster, no different from ordinary chess pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang held it in his hand, feeling a slight coolness on his fingertips.  Following Senior Official Yang's instructions, he extended his divine sense into the white chess piece, activating a faint white light, but that was all. It did not display any further mystical properties in Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Senior Official Yang gritted his teeth, “If True Monarch can help our Yin-Yang lineage supplement the cultivation technique, I am willing to gift this treasure to True Monarch!”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him and shook his head slightly, “I can help you refine the existing parts, but supplementing the cultivation technique is extremely difficult.  Unless I switch to cultivating the ‘Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Art,’ it would require immense effort, and success is not guaranteed.”</p><p>He had so many other things to do and couldn't be distracted.</p><p>Senior Official Yang's face was filled with disappointment.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang’s tone changed, “You can comprehend it yourselves.  Senior Daoist Yin-Yang's choices were too extreme. Cultivating it will affect one’s Nascent Soul, which is one of the reasons why you feel so many obstacles. I will help you refine the cultivation technique and also gift you something. You should have the opportunity to break through further…”</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang took out a Soul Calming Incense stick and gave the formula along with it.</p><p>Even with the formula for a superior Soul Calming Incense, the Yin-Yang lineage lacked the ability to refine it, so this was better.</p><p>Of course, he intended to take the white chess piece.</p><p>Qin Sang held the white chess piece in his right hand and the Soul Calming Incense and its formula in his left.</p><p>Senior Official Yang smelled the Soul Calming Incense and immediately felt his mind clear, greatly surprised.  He looked left and right, weighing his options for a long time, and finally decided to accept the Soul Calming Incense and its formula.</p><p>With this formula, even if he couldn't do it, future generations would have great hope.</p><p>“Comprehending the cultivation technique will still require some time.  Senior Official Yang, why not accompany me to Tianxing Island and we can exchange insights and verify our understandings?”</p><p>Qin Sang suggested.</p><p>Senior Official Yang naturally had no objections.</p><p>Shortly after, the three flew out of Lantou Island.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
