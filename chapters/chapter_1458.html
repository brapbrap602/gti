<h1>Chapter 1450: Trapped in the Sword Formation</h1><p>Qin Sang's cultivation had vastly improved, and his understanding of sword formations was far deeper than during his early Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>The Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, the only sword formation in the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* cultivation technique, undoubtedly possessed the ability to challenge opponents beyond its level.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang wasn't wielding his natal spirit sword, the Yun You Sword, but rather the high-grade Jin Chen Sword, its power was still considerable.</p><p>More importantly, Qin Sang's spiritual sense had greatly increased, allowing him to control the sword formation with greater ease and expanding its range of influence.</p><p>This was why he was confident enough to employ a small trick to trap both opponents with one strike.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang's goal wasn't to kill these two cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>His opponents weren't newly advanced mid-Yuan Ying cultivators like him, but established powerhouses from prestigious sects, undoubtedly possessing protective treasures.</p><p>With the opponents stubbornly resisting, Qin Sang knew a prolonged fight was inevitable.</p><p>However, a prolonged battle would only worsen the situation, something he needed to avoid.</p><p>The imminent arrival of Xuan Tian Palace experts and the possibility of attracting the Hun Mo Elder posed significant threats.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang's objective remained unchanged—to capture the woman in green, escape immediately, clarify the situation, and then consider his next move.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Elder Lan and Elder Mei, seasoned veterans with extensive experience, sensed something amiss.  They decisively chose to flee in different directions, preventing their opponent from dealing with both simultaneously.</p><p>This ensured that even if one were trapped, the other could provide support or engage the opponent.</p><p>Despite their swift reaction, they miscalculated.</p><p>Qin Sang rapidly changed his sword techniques, unleashing the full power of the Jin Chen Sword which vanished momentarily before reappearing in the fully formed Seven Souls Slaughter Formation, instantly enveloping Elder Mei and Elder Lan.</p><p>Both showed a look of surprise, instantly sensing the alteration in their surroundings and the eerie fluctuations.  Their eyes rapidly scanned their environment.</p><p>They saw the void cloaked in a layer of dark gauze.</p><p>Combined with the lingering effects of the Winter Frost Talisman, it felt like being in the dead of night.</p><p>At that moment, the figures of their companion and opponent became blurry and illusory, making it difficult to distinguish reality from illusion. They felt isolated in a separate space, their connection to their companion severed.</p><p>Through the shadows, countless fine, barely visible sword threads appeared, immediately attacking them with silent tremors.</p><p>An eerie fluctuation spread out.</p><p>“A sword formation!”</p><p>Elder Mei exclaimed, her apprehension growing.</p><p>Transforming swords into thousands, creating a sword formation—only top-tier sword cultivators could achieve this.</p><p>No wonder the sacred artifact fell into this person's hands.  One could only blame that cursed being's bad luck, managing to steal the artifact only to provoke such a formidable opponent.</p><p>Since the opponent dared to bring the artifact to the Demon Gathering, it meant this person was unaware of the artifact's origins and the cursed being, or they wouldn't have been so careless.</p><p>That cursed being, having cultivated an Ice Demon body, had a solidified spirit body, making soul searching extremely difficult for most.</p><p>Understanding the situation, Elder Mei and Elder Lan immediately shouted in unison that it was a misunderstanding, attempting to de-escalate the situation.</p><p>Shi Xue had been swiftly defeated, using several treasures and leaving her with almost no spiritual energy, rendering her combat power almost nonexistent.</p><p>Such a powerful opponent was best not to antagonize unless there was a chance of instantly killing them. Xuan Tian Palace was immensely powerful, but the opponent was strong, fast, and elusive.  If they persisted in provoking Xuan Tian Palace, it would create significant problems.</p><p>A different approach was needed; it would be best to exchange other treasures for the sacred artifact.</p><p>They didn't believe that the vast resources of Xuan Tian Palace couldn't satisfy this person's desires!</p><p>There was no deep-seated hatred between them.  Moreover, the opponent had eliminated a traitor for Xuan Tian Palace. If handled properly, this could forge a beneficial alliance, gaining a powerful ally.</p><p>They had indeed considered this scenario and how to respond beforehand.</p><p>However, they hadn't anticipated that Qin Sang would strike so swiftly and decisively, giving Shi Xue no chance to speak.</p><p>Elder Mei and Elder Lan had their plans, but they were unaware of their opponent's intentions. Seeing his seemingly unforgiving demeanor, they didn't dare to stop fighting.</p><p>Elder Mei recognized the sword formation. A gray light flashed from her palm, revealing a hairpin-sized needle.</p><p>The needle, gray-white in color, seemed to be made from some kind of bone. The tip was carved into a complete skull; its empty eye sockets contained flickering ghost flames, and its mouth opened and closed, spitting out eerie, white flames.</p><p>This was one of Elder Mei's renowned treasures, the Bone-Piercing Needle.</p><p>If an opponent was struck by the Bone-Piercing Needle, the ghost fire would invade their body, inflicting the agony of ghost-soul devouring—one of the most painful tortures in existence.</p><p>The Bone-Piercing Needle was also exceptionally effective in breaking restrictions and formations, a unique treasure perfectly suited for resolving their current danger.</p><p>Elder Mei grabbed the bone-piercing needle.  Hearing ghostly cries, she was about to activate it when a sudden, intense headache overwhelmed her, causing her consciousness to waver.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Elder Mei was startled.  The sword formation could actually assault the soul!</p><p>She forcefully bit her tongue, using the sharp pain to regain clarity.  She thrust her hand downward; a drop of ice water reappeared, then vanished instantly, leaving her enveloped in a suit of玄冰 armor, completely protecting her, without a single flaw.</p><p>‘Clang! Clang! Clang…’</p><p>A series of explosive sounds echoed as countless sword threads relentlessly attacked, leaving visible marks on the ice armor.</p><p>Elder Mei’s heart pounded.  Fortunately, she reacted swiftly, maintaining her composure and protecting herself. Otherwise, she would have been injured!</p><p>Elder Lan faced a similar situation.  He possessed a secret technique to stabilize his soul.  Sensing the sword formation’s assault, he immediately activated the technique, his eyes blazing with intense light, steadying his mind.</p><p>Outside the sword formation…</p><p>Qin Sang, having successfully trapped the two elders, immediately shifted his gaze to his true target.  He had no intention of killing them, so he employed a straightforward strategy.  He decisively unleashed the full power of the sword formation, and while his opponents were overwhelmed, he moved like lightning, breaking through the formation and charging directly at Shi Xue!</p><p>Seeing this, Shi Xue understood Qin Sang's intention: he wouldn't let her go, even with the two elders present.  The crucial point was, he had the power to do it.  The two elders, trapped within the sword formation, were unable to escape immediately.</p><p>“This madman!”</p><p>Shi Xue, who had thought herself safe with the elders' arrival, felt a surge of fear, biting her lip.  She deeply regretted provoking such a powerful enemy.</p><p>She fled with all her might, but her speed couldn't match Qin Sang's.  She watched helplessly as he rapidly closed in, despair filling her eyes.</p><p>At that moment…</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression changed as he sensed another presence rapidly approaching— someone with power comparable to the woman in green, likely a peak early Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“More experts from Xuan Tian Palace are arriving…”</p><p>Qin Sang knew time was of the essence. Ignoring the newcomer, he focused his mind on the Ruyi Orb in his dantian, activating his protective energy shield, further increasing his speed!</p><p>As he was about to catch Shi Xue…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly felt an inexplicable sense of unease, as if a great danger was imminent.</p>
