<h1>Chapter 1349: A Lifelong Pursuit (4k, 2 Chapters Added)</h1><p>Under Ye Laomo's watchful gaze, Bai obediently activated the final restriction on the activation platform, then stepped back to make way.  Ye Laomo withdrew his gaze and took a step forward.</p><p>All eyes were on him as Ye Laomo ascended, walking towards the array at the storm's center.  Within the tempest, he walked with an unhurried air, his Yin-Yang halberd whirling around him, deflecting the storm as he climbed to the array's peak.</p><p>This seemingly effortless ascent was, in fact, extremely perilous.  Spatial turbulence had already reached this point. The storm's intensity grew terrifying, tearing everything apart in a chaotic scene of unimaginable power.</p><p>The array hung high, directly opposite the activation platform.  Its brilliant green light was dazzling, its outline becoming increasingly clear. Ye Laomo firmly stepped onto it, examining the array below.</p><p>The array was about the same size as the top of the activation platform. Its current form could no longer be considered a diagram; it was a square green platform.  The platform was covered with tadpole-like runes, each incredibly profound.  A single glance induced a dizzying sensation, forcing Ye Laomo to quickly look away.</p><p>The storm's power was even more violent here. Ye Laomo had to constantly activate the Yin-Yang halberd's protective power to maintain his footing on the green platform.</p><p>The moment he stepped onto the platform, Ye Laomo felt a faint connection emanating from beyond the void, from a distant, unknown place—the destination of the activation platform.</p><p>Ascension? Or teleportation? Ye Laomo wasn't sure. He remained wary of Yu Gu, who in turn guarded against his betrayal, having made a vow that everything would be revealed only after they successfully left this realm.</p><p>Therefore, Ye Laomo didn't know much. But he knew one thing: no matter what awaited him on the other side, no matter the danger, he had to leave.</p><p>He had explored every corner of the Northern Star Realm. He had ventured beyond it, traveling through the three realms of the North Sea, challenging their masters.  He ultimately discovered that these were merely larger cages.  The three realms were similarly surrounded by endless storms.  No matter which direction one tried to escape, the outcome was either exhaustion and death, or a shameful return.</p><p>Legend spoke of a path within the storms of the North Sea three realms, possibly leading to other realms.  But like becoming a Divine Transformation cultivator, this was mere legend, its truth unknown.  No matter one's exceptional talent or unmatched cultivation, they remained prisoners in their cage.</p><p>Ye Laomo refused to remain trapped here his entire life. Breaking through to the late Yuan Ying stage didn't bring him much joy, as he knew his chances of Divine Transformation were slim. He refused to be a fleeting insect. He would seize every opportunity to see, to experience, the wider world, even if the other side of the activation platform was a dragon's lair—he would have no regrets!</p><p>Ye sought the Dao. A lifelong pursuit. Unwavering.  No regrets in death!</p><p>Thinking this, Ye Laomo glanced at Bai, his eyes flickering.  Extracting information from Yu Gu was impossible. He would rather venture into the unknown alone, face the dangers head-on, than rescue Yu Gu or negotiate with him.</p><p>Bai, however, seemed to have a close relationship with Qin Sang and Qing Jun, his origins mysterious.  His intimate knowledge of the activation platform suggested he knew much, and might be a potential ally.</p><p>The green platform soared in the sky. Ye Laomo surveyed his surroundings, noticing that under the continued influence of the inner palace's phenomenon, the outer palace was also violently shaking and collapsing.</p><p>The Soul Infant array, used to unseal the activation platform, had dissipated the surrounding ghost mist, now becoming thinner without the influence of the evil array.  Through the thinning mist, Ye Laomo vaguely saw the phenomenon within the Ziwei Palace's inner palace.</p><p>The inner palace could now be called a celestial palace, completely severed from the outer palace, towering over it by at least a hundred meters and still rising.  Originally hidden deep in the cloud sea of the ancient fairy battlefield, the several recent premature appearances of the celestial palace were omens of its departure from this realm, finally breaking free of the cloud sea today.</p><p>Something beyond the void seemed to be calling to the Ziwei Palace. Initially slow, the speed increased. With every meter the palace ascended, the outer palace's shaking intensified.</p><p>The demon hole had completely disappeared.  The peaks and secret realms collapsed one after another, heading towards destruction as the Ziwei Palace departed.</p><p>As the celestial palace ascended, the void in the sky grew larger, space collapsing.  The Northern Star Realm's outer storms were insignificant compared to this spatial storm.  At the same time, the impact on Ye Laomo intensified, forcing him to fully activate the Yin-Yang halberd's protective power.</p><p>Within the inner palace, the newly restored fairyland was once again in ruins.</p><p>The peaks containing the Sword Path Grand Hall and the ancient teleportation array were shattered from the outside in by spatial turbulence, reduced to dust, with barely one-tenth remaining.</p><p>The ancient medicinal gardens and ancient prohibitions, once a whole jade-like expanse, now showed visible cracks.</p><p>At the summit of the Tian Shan mountain, the celestial palace shimmered, sometimes fading, sometimes solidifying, its celestial prohibitions flashing.  Ancient halls collapsed in swathes across the mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>Numerous secret realms and ancient prohibitions, seemingly struggling against the spatial turbulence, barely clung to existence.</p><p>In this cataclysm, the celestial palace suffered immense damage.  Continents fractured and were swept into the spatial storm, vanishing without a trace.  The secret realms and ancient treasures within were destroyed.  </p><p>Only the most deeply hidden, crucial areas of the celestial palace survived.</p><p>Even the ancient medicinal garden was not spared.  The ancient prohibitions couldn’t protect the life within. The glow of the spiritual herbs dimmed and they were crushed by the encroaching storm.  Occasionally, fleeing figures could be seen.</p><p>Some, gripped by greed, had not yet escaped the celestial palace.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>They fled in panic, filled with regret.</p><p>Two figures stood out among them.</p><p>One was Lu Boyuan. He had just emerged from the ancient medicinal garden, a frost lizard perched on his shoulder. Upon seeing the devastation outside, the look of joy on both their faces vanished, replaced by a gasp of horror.  Without hesitation, they fled towards the outer hall.</p><p>The other was the Feather Demon King.</p><p>He lagged behind Lu Boyuan, struggling to move within the ancient medicinal garden, forced to revert to his true form.</p><p>Given the Feather Demon King’s status, he should have known better, yet some miraculous herb captivated him.  Now, regret was useless.</p><p>He periodically looked up at the sky, his eyes filled with anxiety.</p><p>A massive rift tore through the heavens.</p><p>Spatial storms hung like dark clouds, wreaking havoc.  The Ziwei Palace was hurtling towards it inexorably!</p><p>The spatial storms were bad enough, but a collision with the celestial prohibitions within the inner hall was unimaginable. Those trapped inside had no hope of survival.</p><p>…</p><p>Outer Hall.</p><p>Blood-colored altar.</p><p>Under Qing Jun's control, the Heart Demon Puppet Seal covered Yu Gu's entire body.</p><p>But it was short-lived.</p><p>Yu Gu abandoned his skin and meridians, retreating into his bones.</p><p>The other cultivators’ treasures and spells bombarded Yu Gu relentlessly, yet they only damaged his skin, unable to even leave a mark on his bones.  Even the treasure unleashed by Zhen Daozhang was not significantly more effective.</p><p>This bone body was the result of an ancient cultivator’s tireless refinement over countless years, its hardness beyond the capabilities of Nascent Soul cultivators to easily destroy.</p><p>Qin Sang's Nine Netherworld Demon Fire might have some effect.</p><p>But he dared not bring the demon fire near Yu Gu, lest it be stolen and used against them.</p><p>Sadly, the Sun God Tree was still unstable. Otherwise, the use of the South Ming Li Fire would have kept Yu Gu from being so arrogant.</p><p>Yu Gu did not surrender, still struggling with Qing Jun for control. During the clash with the Heart Demon Puppet Seal, he glimpsed its secrets.</p><p>With Yu Gu's knowledge, he naturally had a countermeasure.</p><p>He immediately changed tactics, drawing back the purple light, making it murky and indistinct, transforming it into turtle-shell-like purple crystals covering his skeletal frame.</p><p>The Binding Demon Rope's lightning struck the purple crystals, sparking and shattering them.</p><p>The purple light replenished continuously.  New crystals formed constantly.  However, the purple light was diminishing.  Before it was completely exhausted, Yu Gu would likely break free.</p><p>The purple crystals clung tightly to the bones.</p><p>A strange energy emanated from them, penetrating the Heart Demon Puppet Seal.</p><p>Yu Gu, reduced to a skeleton, convulsed, his bones creaking.</p><p>Soon, a section of the puppet seal was nearly pierced by the purple light, showing signs of disintegration. Qing Jun, reacting swiftly, repaired the seal, preventing a breakthrough.</p><p>Yu Gu let out a wild laugh.  Once his weakness was found, the mere puppet seal and Binding Demon Rope could not restrain him; otherwise, his life would have been in vain.</p><p>A swarm of ants daring to threaten his life!</p><p>Seeing this, Qing Jun concentrated, fully activating the puppet seal.</p><p>Qin Sang not only controlled the Binding Demon Rope, but also commanded the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to observe Yu Gu's weaknesses, relaying them to Qing Jun.</p><p>The effects were immediate. Qing Jun saw through Yu Gu's plan and reacted swiftly, stabilizing the situation for the moment.</p><p>At that moment, Qing Jun's voice reached Qin Sang's ears, "Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, then understood her intentions.  He channeled his will into the Demon-Binding Rope and flew towards the storm.</p><p>Once inside, Bai took over the Demon-Binding Rope.  Its power was even greater in his hands. Together with Qing Jun, they flew towards Qingtai, carrying Yu Gu.</p><p>Qin Sang finally disengaged.</p><p>He let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>The clash with Yu Gu, though seemingly complex, had only lasted a moment.</p><p>Qin Sang examined himself. After two consecutive battles, his true energy was mostly depleted.  A little longer, and the Demon-Binding Rope would have drained him dry.</p><p>Yu Gu's strength left a deep impression on him.  Even with all his magic weapons and a Nascent Soul puppet, he could only defend and escape.  Without the Demon-Binding Rope and the Mind Demon Puppet Seal, no one could restrain Yu Gu!</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh…'</p><p>Numerous figures appeared beside Qin Sang, all gazing up at Qingtai.</p><p>Qingtai seemed to possess some magic, drawing everyone's attention.</p><p>Qingtai represented the unknown.</p><p>It represented the possibility of a greater Dao!</p><p>For cultivators, what could be more important than a broader path?</p><p>Even the slightest possibility was enough to drive one mad.</p><p>At this moment, the feud with Ye Laomo was insignificant. They even empathized with Ye Laomo, understanding why he would resort to any means to achieve his goals.</p><p>Time was of the essence; they hesitated no longer and threw themselves into the storm.</p><p>Of course, some hesitated.</p><p>Some had too many attachments in the mortal world – lovers, masters, and their schools.</p><p>They could not let go.</p><p>Some had endured countless hardships to finally form their Nascent Soul.  They had a bright future ahead, and didn't want to risk their lives for a slim chance.</p><p>The Ascension Platform was right there; there would be other opportunities.</p><p>They chose to give up, standing at the foot of the blood-red altar, quietly observing those who dared to go first.</p><p>Those who charged into the storm felt its full force and changed color.</p><p>Seeing Ye Laomo ascend easily, they thought the storm was manageable.</p><p>It proved not everyone could reach Qingtai.</p><p>Early-stage Nascent Soul cultivators hit a bottleneck first, unable to proceed further than halfway.</p><p>Reluctant, they unleashed their trump cards, forcing themselves a few steps further before sighing, shaking their heads, giving up, and retreating.</p><p>Few remained.</p><p>Bai and Qing Jun were in the lead.</p><p>They carried Yu Gu forward.</p><p>Qing Jun had the hardest time, simultaneously battling the demon within Yu Gu using the puppet seal and resisting the storm.</p><p>Bai only needed to maintain the Demon-Binding Rope.</p><p>Qing Jun's body trembled slightly, but her steps remained firm.</p><p>Bai glanced at her, nodded silently, and his corpse energy surged, mixed with the glow of bone curses, greatly increasing his power.  In the ghostly mist, he was even more at ease and was able to help Qing Jun share the burden.</p><p>Ye Laomo withdrew his gaze, briefly looking at them.</p><p>Bound by an oath, he couldn't help them against Yu Gu, but he could help them reach Qingtai.</p><p>As for the others, most had grudges against Ye Laomo; he wasn't so kind. Besides, the storm was intensifying, and Ye Laomo dared not be complacent.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Qing Jun and Bai successfully reached Qingtai.</p><p>Following close behind were Zhen Daochang, Cang Hong Zhenren, and Tongyou Mojun.</p><p>The rest eventually gave up.</p><p>After taking some pills and recovering some true energy, Qin Sang tried several times. Using demonic fire, he pushed further into the storm than others of his cultivation level, but even if he could reach Qingtai, he wouldn't be able to stand there.</p><p>He longed to break through the storm and enter a more brilliant world, to pursue a higher Dao.</p><p>But the timing was wrong, his cultivation was too weak.</p><p>This opportunity was not meant for him.</p><p>He gave up, landing on the ground and watching Bai and Qing Jun on Qingtai from afar, a hint of worry flashing in his eyes.</p><p>Bai's origins were mysterious; he couldn't stay with him forever, and Qin Sang had already prepared for their separation.  But he hadn't expected it to come so soon.</p><p>What dangers lay beyond the Ascension Platform?</p><p>Could they safely traverse the spatial turbulence?</p><p>Would he ever have the chance to go there?</p><p>Everything was unknown.</p><p>His two closest friends were about to leave him, leaving only his naive Nascent Soul puppet by his side.</p><p>This parting might be their final farewell.</p><p>Qing Jun's strength was among the best in the cultivation world; the Mind Demon Puppet Seal commanded respect.</p><p>She was also young, without the pressure of heavenly tribulation, and had a promising future.</p><p>But after learning the function of the Ascension Platform from Bai, she didn't hesitate to join him and venture into the wider world.</p><p>While not as ruthless as Ye Laomo, her pursuit of the Dao was unwavering.</p><p>Unburdened by worldly entanglements, she was alone and had nothing to lose.</p><p>Jing Yu tried a few times before giving up, landing beside Qin Sang.  Noticing Qin Sang's expression, she understood his worries and silently shook her head, unsure how to comfort him.</p><p>Everyone understood.</p><p>The cultivation world was full of uncertainties, especially the reckless pursuit of the Dao by Qing Jun and others, a desperate gamble with low odds of success.
