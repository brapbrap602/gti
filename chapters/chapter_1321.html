<h1>Chapter 1313: Arrangements</h1><p>"The rise of the Corpse Refining Sect was short-lived. It is said that they suddenly declined, and the reason has long been forgotten. As someone who practices corpse refining techniques, I once investigated the Corpse Refining Sect and learned a few things. The sect was infamous for turning living cultivators into refined corpses. The cruelty of their techniques was unparalleled, even among demonic sects, and it struck fear into the hearts of many. It’s no surprise that they were eventually eradicated by a coalition of other forces."</p><p>The Judge, eager to reclaim the Death Jade, spoke without holding anything back.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Corpse King he had found in the Immortal Tomb and roughly guessed the reason for the Corpse Refining Sect’s rapid decline.</p><p>The sect’s leader had once entered the Purple Micro Palace but, for reasons unknown, died unexpectedly inside. The Corpse King was likely his refined corpse, which had been trapped in the Immortal Tomb ever since, until Bai discovered it.</p><p>Apart from the sect leader, no one knew about the mysterious figure imprisoned in the Water Prison—or if they did, they had no way to contact him.</p><p>From then on, the Corpse Refining Sect was left leaderless, plagued by internal strife and external threats.</p><p>In the world of cultivation, sects like the Corpse Refining Sect, which rose and fell like ephemeral flowers, were countless. Only a few could endure for long, and those that did usually possessed some form of protective treasure passed down through generations.</p><p>For example, the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet of the Upper Yuan Pure Palace.</p><p>"Have you heard anything about the Corpse Refining Sect or its remnants in recent years?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>The Judge thought carefully for a moment before shaking his head. "I haven’t heard anything. If you’re looking for the descendants of the Corpse Refining Sect, I can send people to investigate. Cultivators who practice corpse refinement are unique. If they need to refine corpses, traces will inevitably be left behind."</p><p>The Judge volunteered his services.</p><p>This was exactly what Qin Sang wanted. "Good! I’ll leave this matter to you. Whether it’s the descendants of the Corpse Refining Sect or their techniques, I want them all. Also, remember to keep this quiet. We don’t want to alert anyone. Perhaps the person we’re looking for will reach out to you on their own."</p><p>The mysterious figure behind the Corpse Refining Sect, trapped in the Water Prison, had still managed to stir up trouble and establish the sect. He was clearly not one to sit idle.</p><p>The early emergence of the Purple Micro Palace, the schemes of Old Demon Ye, and the mysterious figure behind the Corpse Refining Sect…</p><p>The cultivation world appeared calm on the surface, but beneath it, turbulent undercurrents were stirring.</p><p>If this person wanted to rebuild the Corpse Refining Sect, the fastest way would be to recruit other demonic cultivators who practiced corpse refinement.</p><p>The Judge sensed the deeper implications in Qin Sang’s words and grew more cautious.</p><p>"The war between the three domains has settled, and you won’t have many opportunities for combat. I’ll keep the Death Jade with me for now. Don’t worry—I won’t tamper with it. Once you’ve gathered the materials I need or found the person I’m looking for, I’ll return it to you immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist and, in front of the Judge, placed a layer of restrictions on the Death Jade before storing it in his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>The Judge could only watch helplessly, sighing inwardly as he cupped his hands in farewell.</p><p>Once the Judge’s figure disappeared, Bai emerged from the Corpse Puppet Bag and looked in the direction the Judge had left. "He doesn’t seem to be hiding anything. That mysterious figure has been sealed for who knows how many years. He’s probably recovering from his injuries. We’ll have to wait for him to reveal himself… Let’s head to the Corpse Refining Sect’s main headquarters first."</p><p>Soon, the two entered the Water Prison.</p><p>After inspecting the seals in the Water Prison, Bai made a round through the sect’s main headquarters but found nothing of note.</p><p>Next, they returned to the branch of the Corpse Refining Sect they had first discovered. All signs indicated that Tan Hao had left and never returned.</p><p>Unable to uncover any useful information, Qin Sang informed his senior sister before leaving the Sin Abyss.</p><p>Although the three domains had reached a truce, Qin Sang had killed and injured several Nascent Soul cultivators, and many likely held a grudge against him. He decided not to visit anyone.</p><p>---</p><p>**Southern Foothills of the Skywalk Plateau.**</p><p>**First Tier, Myriad Night Mountain.**</p><p>Myriad Night Mountain towered high, its peak perpetually covered in snow. Below the snowline, however, the landscape was lush and vibrant, teeming with life.</p><p>The mountain was rich in spiritual energy and had once been home to a sect that was annihilated by the Sin Abyss. Later, the Sin Abyss took control of the area.</p><p>Now, Myriad Night Mountain was unclaimed, and Qin Sang had taken it as a temporary base for the Azure Sheep Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t plan to establish his sect here permanently, so he only set up a simple protective formation.</p><p>The mountain was close to the grasslands, where most of the resources Qin Sang had been allocated were located. Myriad Night Mountain would serve as a transit point, and disciples could rest here.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Two streaks of light—one green, one red—flew through the air. They were Li Yufu and Mei Gu.</p><p>As they approached Myriad Night Mountain, Li Yufu scanned the area and said, "It seems we’ve arrived early. Junior Brother Tan and the others aren’t here yet."</p><p>Mei Gu nodded. "Let’s wait at the foot of the mountain. Once everyone’s here, we’ll go pay our respects to Master."</p><p>"Agreed."</p><p>Li Yufu nodded and descended, landing on a large rock at the mountain’s base. He gazed out at the vast landscape, his heart filled with ambition.</p><p>He turned to look at Myriad Night Mountain, growing fonder of it by the minute. Though the area was somewhat small, the spiritual energy was abundant. It wouldn’t disgrace the Azure Sheep Temple as a sect base. He wondered what his master’s plans were.</p><p>Just then, the sound of rushing wind came from the distance. In the blink of an eye, four figures landed before them.</p><p>Fat Chicken, White Cat, Shangguan Lifeng, Tan Yien, and Bai Hanqiu.</p><p>During this time, Shangguan Lifeng had been fighting alongside Li Yufu, and the two had grown close. Li Yufu knew that Shangguan Lifeng was an old acquaintance of Qin Sang’s and treated him with respect.</p><p>After greeting Shangguan Lifeng, Li Yufu turned to Fat Chicken and White Cat. "Fellow Daoists, when will Senior Willow and Senior Spirit Monkey arrive?"</p><p>"They won’t be coming," Fat Chicken replied, a trace of worry in his eyes. "My mother entered seclusion a few days ago to attempt a breakthrough. The two seniors need to stay behind in the Thousand Bamboo Sea to guard against any disturbances."</p><p>Li Yufu noticed Fat Chicken’s unease and reassured him, "Don’t worry, Brother Thunderclap. Senior Jingyu is blessed by the heavens. She’ll surely succeed in her breakthrough!"</p><p>Jingyu’s heavenly tribulation was approaching. This breakthrough was a life-or-death matter, and the news couldn’t be leaked. Only Qin Sang and Fat Chicken knew about it. Fat Chicken could only bury his worries deep in his heart and nod silently.</p><p>On the other side, Bai Hanqiu, who had successfully reached the Foundation Establishment stage, stood behind Tan Yien.</p><p>Tan Yien, now at the False Core stage, walked over to Mei Gu and whispered a few words to her.</p><p>Mei Gu’s expression turned sorrowful.</p><p>With everyone present, the group made their way up the mountain, passing through dense forests until they reached a cave at the summit.</p><p>The area was blanketed in snow, pure and pristine.</p><p>Inside the cave was an icy door, emanating a chilling cold.</p><p>The door opened automatically, and the group stepped inside. Seeing Qin Sang, they all bowed in respect.</p><p>Upon learning that Jingyu had entered seclusion, Qin Sang knew there was little he could do. With the Corpse Flower Blood Amber, her chances of success were still high.</p><p>"Where is Zhao Shanran?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Mei Gu replied with a mournful tone, "Master, Junior Brother Zhao failed to form his Golden Core and passed away in his cave not long ago."</p><p>Even the Fiend Demon Pill couldn’t guarantee a successful Core Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Having witnessed countless deaths, his expression remained calm. "I had planned to have Zhao Shanran handle the sect’s affairs in the future. It’s unfortunate that he couldn’t cross this threshold. Until we find a suitable replacement, you’ll each need to take on a portion of the Azure Sheep Temple’s responsibilities."</p>
