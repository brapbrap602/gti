<h1>Chapter 1479: The Serpent Banner (4k)</h1><p>Shi Xue loudly agreed, "Indeed, there has never been a reason to separate a pair of Dao companions!"</p><p>Tong Lingyu lightly tapped the table with her finger and said indifferently, "Elder Shang has indeed acted somewhat rashly."</p><p>The Hall Master Yin and others exchanged glances, but they could not press the matter further.</p><p>Once cultivators reach the Nascent Soul stage and become Dao companions, practicing dual cultivation techniques or secret arts means their strength is inevitably intertwined. If they are separated, it is natural for their power to suffer greatly.</p><p>There truly is no reason to force Dao companions apart.</p><p>With the backing of the Listening Snow Pavilion and the Grand Elder, and with Shang Lu having initiated the challenge during the wedding ceremony, they could not push the matter too far.</p><p>If Shang Lu sought external help, involving unrelated individuals, it would be both unjust and unreasonable. Their earlier stance of advocating for "true feelings" would become a joke.</p><p>Since this Elder Qingfeng was willing to endure humiliation, they truly had no good way to proceed.</p><p>Hall Master Yin and the others looked at Shang Lu, only to see him frowning in silence. They wondered if he truly intended to face two opponents alone. Unless, of course, Shang Lu could somehow produce a Dao companion on the spot.</p><p>Under the astonished gazes of the crowd, Shang Lu did not hesitate. He stepped down from the cloud bed, flashed to the front of the cloud platform, and faced Qin Sang and Liu Li directly, nodding lightly. "Very well! Let it be as the Daoist suggests."</p><p>He intended to face two opponents alone!</p><p>This was something no one had anticipated.</p><p>Although Elder Qingfeng was making his first public appearance, he had already gained considerable fame within the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>The fact that he had infiltrated the demon nest alone, delivered intelligence, and helped the Profound Heaven Palace gain the upper hand, thereby preventing many unnecessary casualties, was undeniable proof of his extraordinary strength.</p><p>Liu Li, on the other hand, was the closed-door disciple of the previous Pavilion Master of the Listening Snow Pavilion and the junior sister of the current Pavilion Master. With no shortage of techniques and divine abilities, it was natural for her to possess the ability to challenge those above her level.</p><p>Shang Lu was essentially challenging two cultivators of the same level, and these two were Dao companions who shared a deep connection. Their combined strength was not merely additive.</p><p>An absurd thought crossed the minds of the onlookers: Could it be that this Pavilion Master Shang, who commanded an entire lineage, was truly so consumed by love that he proposed this duel merely to achieve a sense of clarity?</p><p>Or perhaps it was both—killing two birds with one stone.</p><p>Otherwise, why would he be so persistent?</p><p>If it was for the sake of the Cleansing Pool, Shang Lu facing two opponents alone, and without a life-and-death struggle, would make it impossible for him to probe Elder Qingfeng's true abilities. This duel would be meaningless.</p><p>Some glanced at the Yue cultivator who had arrived with Shang Lu.</p><p>They saw him sitting calmly on the cloud bed, holding a jade cup, exuding an air of confidence.</p><p>This raised doubts in their minds: Could it be that Shang Lu had anticipated this situation before proposing the duel and had prepared accordingly?</p><p>Given Shang Lu's intelligence, it was entirely possible.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He too had considered this possibility. Shang Lu's decisiveness suggested he had some hidden advantage.</p><p>Since the words had already been spoken, there was no backing out now.</p><p>In that case, there was no need to refuse. Qin Sang was also curious to witness the abilities of this Pavilion Master of the Heavenly Mountain lineage. Who was probing whom remained to be seen.</p><p>After a brief exchange with Liu Li, Qin Sang nodded to Shi Xue.</p><p>With both sides agreeing, the onlookers could no longer intervene.</p><p>Shi Xue gave Shang Lu a cold glance and waved her whisk. The cloud beds in the northern section floated southward, clearing space in the northern part of the cloud platform.</p><p>"Since this is a duel, let this cloud wall be the boundary. If anyone falls beyond it, they will be considered defeated."</p><p>Shi Xue waved her whisk again, conjuring a cloud wall that encircled a circular space in the void, large enough for the three to engage in combat.</p><p>Shang Lu furrowed his brow slightly but ultimately did not object. He was the first to step into the cloud wall and take his position.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liu Li also entered together, standing at the opposite end of the arena, facing Shang Lu from a distance.</p><p>On the cloud beds, the guests' eyes sparkled with excitement.</p><p>No one had expected that tonight, in addition to witnessing a grand wedding ceremony, they would also be treated to such a spectacle. The Pavilion Master of the Heavenly Mountain lineage, disregarding his status, had personally entered the arena. They all felt that their journey had been worthwhile.</p><p>They maneuvered their cloud beds to positions with good views, focusing intently on the duel.</p><p>Tong Lingyu turned to Hall Master Yin and said, "Hall Master Yin, let us move closer to the arena and keep a close watch. Today is a joyous occasion, and we must ensure that neither side becomes too heated, lest it harm the harmony within the sect."</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>Hall Master Yin urged his cloud bed closer to the cloud wall.</p><p>Tong Lingyu flew to the other side.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang, Shi Xue, and others also stood ready.</p><p>Inside the cloud wall, Shang Lu gave Liu Li a deep look and said solemnly, "Liu Li, I once said I did not wish to fight you. That remains true. For now, I will have to restrain you for a time."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Shang Lu lightly tapped the brocade pouch at his waist.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Three streaks of white light shot out.</p><p>Following them came a series of sharp, ear-piercing hisses.</p><p>The hisses were like demonic sounds. Lower-level cultivators who heard them immediately felt dizzy and nauseous, extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>"Heavenly Mountain Snow Serpents!"</p><p>Someone exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Everyone focused their gaze and saw the three streaks of white light rapidly expand in the wind, revealing their true forms in an instant—three giant serpents, each over a dozen zhang long.</p><p>These serpents looked similar, with pure white scales and crimson tongues flickering in their gaping mouths. Their eyes gleamed with ferocity, making them particularly terrifying.</p><p>They were nearly dragon-like, their aura comparable to the dragon that had pulled Qin Sang's carriage.</p><p>"Three Heavenly Mountain Snow Serpents, all at the late Core Formation stage! Snow Serpents are difficult to cultivate, and at such a high level, there probably aren't many more on the Heavenly Mountain. Pavilion Master Shang has truly gone all out. No wonder he dared to accept this challenge!"</p><p>Someone marveled.</p><p>Among the guests were many Nascent Soul ancestors. Three late Core Formation Snow Serpents, while rare, were not enough to intimidate them.</p><p>However, the Heavenly Mountain lineage possessed a Serpent Banner. When combined with the Snow Serpents' abilities, its power could pose a significant challenge even to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>No wonder Shang Lu was so confident!</p><p>Ignoring the gazes from outside the arena, Shang Lu, having released the Snow Serpents, immediately waved his sleeve, from which a ball of white light flew out, transforming into a Serpent Banner.</p><p>The banner depicted the image of a Heavenly Mountain Snow Serpent.</p><p>Amidst the hissing of the Snow Serpents, the banner flew above Shang Lu's head, its flag fluttering.</p><p>The Snow Serpents seemed to respond to some summoning, their bodies writhing violently as they shot toward the banner.</p><p>At that moment, something peculiar happened.</p><p>The bodies of the three Snow Serpents rapidly turned transparent, as if made of ice sculptures. Upon colliding with the banner, they did not knock it away but instead merged into the flag, disappearing completely.</p><p>In an instant, the Snow Serpent patterns on the banner came to life, now featuring three additional serpents.</p><p>Thick dark clouds had gathered above the arena at some point.</p><p>With each wave of the banner, a biting cold wind arose, and streams of icy air continuously emerged. The Snow Serpents swam freely on the banner, exhaling icy breath.</p><p>A pale, bone-chilling wind swept across the entire arena, obscuring the figures of the three combatants.</p><p>Without a word, Shang Lu pointed toward his opponents and commanded, "Go!"</p><p>The Serpent Banner spun rapidly, its momentum overwhelming as it pressed down from above!</p><p>On the other side, Qin Sang and Liu Li quickly exchanged information, gaining a rough understanding of the situation.</p><p>Given the difficulty of cultivating Snow Serpents, few had seen the Serpent Banner in action. In the past, cultivators of the Heavenly Mountain lineage had raised at most one Snow Serpent. Shang Lu had unleashed three at once.</p><p>Qin Sang would not underestimate any opponent, especially the leader of a Profound Heaven Palace lineage.</p><p>A flash of light appeared at his fingertips as the Golden Sunken Sword shot forth.</p><p>After being reforged, the Golden Sunken Sword's form was entirely different from before. Qin Sang now wielded the sword intent of the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture." Even if Elders Mei and Lan were watching from outside, they would not easily detect any flaws.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang awakened the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, searching for weaknesses in the Serpent Banner.</p><p>As the spiritual sword emerged, the Serpent Banner, accompanied by the icy wind, surged forward.</p><p>Qin Sang initially intended to use the sword to shield Liu Li, both to avoid being divided and conquered by Shang Lu and to create an opportunity for Liu Li to strike.</p><p>However, at that moment, he heard Liu Li's voice in his ear.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he abandoned the idea.</p><p>The Golden Sunken Sword's momentum shifted abruptly, radiating an extreme sharpness. A dazzling, earth-shattering sword light suddenly slashed out, incredibly brilliant and radiant.</p><p>This unyielding sword intent, so pure, moved the onlookers.</p><p>This was the sword path comprehended by Green Bamboo.</p><p>Having broken through to the Nascent Soul stage on his own, Green Bamboo had gradually freed himself from the constraints of the "Divine Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture," infusing it with his own personality. The final techniques of the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" represented the culmination of his insights.</p><p>What Qin Sang was now executing was one of those techniques.</p><p>Although the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture" could not match the power of the original sword array, it was undoubtedly a formidable sword art. It was a pity that Green Bamboo had died young, never reaching his peak.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Golden Sunken Sword cleaved through the void, its sword light like a cold moon, directly targeting the Serpent Banner.</p><p>The surging icy air could not hinder it in the slightest.</p><p>The Serpent Banner flapped violently, the Snow Serpents writhing restlessly on its surface, spewing icy breath.</p><p>The icy breath condensed into a jade-white mystical light.</p><p>'Thud!'</p><p>The sword light struck, merging into the jade-white light.</p><p>In the next moment, both the sword light and the jade-white light dissipated without any spectacular display, vanishing into nothingness, leaving only calm.</p><p>With this strike, Qin Sang had gained some understanding of the Serpent Banner's power.</p><p>At that moment, the Serpent Banner pressed on relentlessly. The jade-white light reappeared, flashing briefly before merging into the icy wind.</p><p>Instantly, countless Snow Serpent phantoms materialized in the void, lunging toward them with bared fangs and claws.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. Just as he was about to retract his sword to defend himself, his expression shifted. His sword technique changed again, and the Golden Sunken Sword reversed its trajectory, slashing diagonally downward.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A crisp sound rang out.</p><p>A jade ruler materialized from the void.</p><p>Simultaneously, the space rippled, and a figure was forced to reveal himself—it was Shang Lu.</p><p>Once the Serpent Banner was unleashed, it could be controlled by the Snow Serpents, allowing Shang Lu to focus on Qin Sang. He had stealthily approached with the jade ruler, only to be detected by Qin Sang.</p><p>Even without the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang's spiritual sense was more than capable of detecting the jade ruler.</p><p>After the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's breakthrough to the mid-fourth transformation, the power of its Heavenly Eye ability had increased further. Qin Sang had specifically tested this.</p><p>If the Heavenly Eye Butterfly had possessed its current level during their time in the Pure Sea Sect, it would have undoubtedly detected the Old Demon Hunmo before he could sense their presence.</p><p>Of course, the spiritual awareness of a Great Cultivator was extremely sharp. The Heavenly Eye Butterfly needed to maintain a certain distance and could not observe recklessly.</p><p>Shang Lu's spiritual sense was still far from that of a Great Cultivator. His movements had been detected as soon as he made them, though Qin Sang had deliberately delayed his response.</p><p>Forced to reveal himself, Shang Lu showed no sign of disappointment. Instead, a faint smile appeared on his lips.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. With a tap of his foot, he leaped into the air.</p><p>The moment he moved, lotus petals formed around him, each as sharp as a blade, swirling into a storm of icy blades.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, escaping just in time.</p><p>However, Shang Lu had achieved his goal of dividing his opponents.</p><p>The Serpent Banner had somehow appeared above them. The Snow Serpents extended their heads, and the jade-white light surged, forming a vortex in the void. Liu Li's figure flickered within, barely visible.</p><p>A phoenix-shaped sword hovered protectively around her.</p><p>The Snow Serpents extended their heads, and the jade-white light continued to pour forth. Sword beams slashed out one after another, but they could not break free from the Serpent Banner.</p><p>"Now we can focus on our duel," Shang Lu said with a smile, glancing at Liu Li, who was entangled by the banner.</p><p>"Pavilion Master Shang, impressive tactics," Qin Sang replied, his expression unreadable. Without another word, he swung his sword.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the Golden Sunken Sword unleashed three sword beams, each as powerful as the first.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The three sword beams formed a triangular formation, instantly appearing before Shang Lu.</p><p>Shang Lu turned his gaze back, his expression serious. "Excellent sword technique!" he remarked.</p><p>Then, he pointed at the jade ruler before him.</p><p>The jade ruler shot upward, rapidly expanding into a giant ruler, firmly blocking the three sword beams. It slammed down with the force of a thousand jun!</p><p>If this strike landed squarely, not only would the sword beams be dispersed, but the Golden Sunken Sword would also be damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in the void, his expression unchanged.</p><p>At that moment, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly focused its attention on the Serpent Banner, searching for its weaknesses.</p><p>Qin Sang himself engaged Shang Lu in a duel.</p><p>With a thought, the three sword beams suddenly merged.</p><p>Outside the arena, the onlookers instinctively narrowed their eyes. All they saw was a dazzling beam of light, as if it could pierce the heavens, unyielding as it clashed with the jade ruler.</p><p>Green Bamboo's path had never known retreat.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A thunderous roar echoed, deafening.</p><p>The cloud beds outside the arena shook, and the onlookers' hearts tightened as they anxiously awaited the outcome.</p><p>When the light faded, Qin Sang and Shang Lu remained standing, seemingly evenly matched.</p><p>However, the guests understood that this was merely the opening act. Both sides were still probing, holding back their most powerful techniques.</p><p>Qin Sang did not look at Shang Lu.</p><p>His gaze fell on the Golden Sunken Sword.</p><p>In the next moment, the sword vanished, and the void filled with starlight—countless sword beams, like a sea of swords.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand forward, and the sea of swords surged, thousands of blades moving as one, carrying a momentum that could destroy everything, shooting toward Shang Lu.</p><p>Seeing this, Shang Lu's eyes flickered.</p><p>He knew his opponent's sword skills were formidable and was eager to test them.</p><p>Glancing to the side to confirm that Liu Li would not break free from the Serpent Banner anytime soon, Shang Lu waved his hand, and the jade ruler also multiplied, engaging Qin Sang in a fierce exchange.</p><p>Sword beams and ruler shadows filled the space, clashing and consuming each other.</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang's sword techniques shifted rapidly, the Golden Sunken Sword ringing out as it clashed with the jade ruler countless times, neither side gaining the upper hand.</p><p>Shang Lu's expression grew more relaxed, a faint smile playing on his lips.</p><p>"Is this the limit of your sword skills?" he asked.</p><p>As soon as he spoke, a faint 'crack' sounded from the side.</p><p>The sound was almost imperceptible, but to Shang Lu, it was like a thunderclap.</p><p>His expression changed drastically, and he turned sharply to look at the Serpent Banner.</p>
