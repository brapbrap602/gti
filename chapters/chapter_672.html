<h1>Chapter 664: Pingbo Harbor</h1><p>Xingguo.</p><p>Pingbo Harbor, a small mortal nation controlled by a single power, is rich in resources, and its people live in peace and prosperity. Qin Sang settled the old witch doctor in a large city in Xingguo, allowing him to enjoy his old age, and sealed the old witch doctor's memories of him.</p><p>Qin Sang did not go straight to Pingbo Harbor. The black coffin on his back was too conspicuous; if he encountered a cultivator with higher cultivation than his, the coffin containing Du Han would easily be discovered.</p><p>He deliberately avoided other cultivators along the way, but this was impossible in Pingbo Harbor.  There were numerous Foundation Establishment cultivators in Pingbo Harbor, and it was said that a Nascent Soul master resided there.</p><p>He could have killed Du Han right then, but Qin Sang wasn't prepared to let him off so easily.</p><p>Although the first half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual* could only create corpse puppets from Foundation Establishment cultivators, Qin Sang still planned to try it on Du Han. If it truly didn't work, he would give up.</p><p>Creating corpse puppets required earth煞 qi (di sha zhi qi), and he only had a little left in his Shao Yin magnetic bottle – not enough to create a living corpse.</p><p>Earth煞 qi was uncommon; only in Pingbo Harbor could he find out more.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to first carve out a cave dwelling in the wilderness, put down the black coffin, and then enter the city to investigate.  Unexpectedly, the land outside Pingbo Harbor was extremely valuable; all the large and small spirit veins were occupied by individuals or sects.</p><p>Having no choice, Qin Sang had to move away from Pingbo Harbor, finding a hidden spirit vein in a desolate mountain range, barely enough to create a cave dwelling.</p><p>After setting down the black coffin and setting up restrictions and concealment formations, Qin Sang felt relieved. He put on a cloak and flew towards Pingbo Harbor.</p><p>Before entering Pingbo Harbor, he first saw an astonishing scene of numerous ships sailing, a thousand sails competing.</p><p>Countless ships covered the sea surface, stretching as far as the eye could see.  The large ones were extremely luxurious, with several-story-high ship buildings; a single ship was comparable to a mountain.</p><p>Beside these giant ships were some seemingly insignificant small boats, which were actually quite large, capable of withstanding ocean storms.</p><p>Qin Sang landed far away on top of a rocky mountain, gazing at the sea. A gentle sea breeze blew towards him, carrying a faint fishy smell.  In the distance, the sky and water blended seamlessly, and he could see cultivators occasionally flying on magical artifacts.</p><p>However, most of these cultivators either ascended from ships or came out of Pingbo Harbor and landed on a ship.</p><p>Cultivators of the Canglang Sea mainly traveled by boat, even the Foundation Establishment masters.  Unless in a hurry, they would not fly on magical artifacts for long periods over the sea.</p><p>Firstly, their true essence was difficult to sustain, and secondly, there were many hidden dangers in the uninhabited seas, such as hurricanes and sea beasts.</p><p>Once encountering danger, if their true essence was also excessively depleted, in the vast and desolate deep sea, it would truly be a desperate situation with no help in sight.</p><p>From Western Xinjiang to Pingbo Harbor, Qin Sang hadn't been continuously flying in the air the whole journey.  When he encountered areas rich in spiritual energy, he would land and rest for a while to recover his true essence.</p><p>Only Nascent Soul masters could continuously fly over the sea for months without stopping.</p><p>As ships entered the harbor, the port was exceptionally bustling and lively.</p><p>Although cultivators had pouches to store items, the space was limited, making them unable to handle large amounts of cargo. Countless goods flowed down from the ships, and the workers in the port were not only mortals, but also low-level cultivators, and even tamed wild and demonic beasts.</p><p>Matching the enormous port was a huge city on land.</p><p>The scale of this city was unprecedented in Qin Sang's life. From a distance, the houses stretched endlessly. In the west city, there was a faint, almost invisible mist that completely blocked the view.</p><p>It was early morning, and people came and went within the city, including cultivators and mortals.  Long queues were forming at the city gates.</p><p>Xiaohan Domain was divided among various powers, and there was no place that could gather so many people.  The Seven Great Passes were on the edge of the dangerous Ancient Immortal battlefield, with a limited mortal population, unable to form such a huge city.</p><p>Qin Sang watched from the mountaintop to his heart's content, before tightening his cloak, and using his body techniques to rush towards the Pingbo Harbor city gate.</p><p>Mortals and cultivators were clearly separated, entering the city through different gates. The gate for cultivators had guards who were Foundation Establishment cultivators, a mix of humans and witch-folk.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please wait."</p><p>When Qin Sang arrived at the city gate, he was stopped by the guards, who looked him up and down. They said gently, "Fellow Daoist, do you have an identity token? Or is this your first time in Pingbo Harbor?"</p><p>"This Daoist is indeed here for the first time. I wonder what an identity token is?" Qin Sang asked in confusion.</p><p>The guard patiently explained, "Fighting is forbidden within Pingbo Port.  Cultivators receive a token proving their identity. This token not only represents your status but also determines your permitted area of movement within the city…"</p><p>Qin Sang only understood after the guard's explanation that even within the seemingly prosperous Pingbo Port, a vast difference existed between ordinary people and cultivators. Even among cultivators, there was a clear hierarchy based on cultivation level.</p><p>Pingbo Port is roughly divided into four zones.</p><p>The largest is for ordinary people. Next is the area for Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment cultivators; the boundary between these two is not strictly defined.</p><p>The smallest zone, previously invisible to Qin Sang, is the West District, shrouded in mist. Only Golden Core cultivators and Nascent Soul masters are permitted entry. It's the core of Pingbo Port.</p><p>Those of insufficient cultivation must be accompanied by a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Security is tight, and it's remarkably peaceful.  More importantly, it consists of high-quality cave dwellings. Pingbo Port is built upon several massive spirit veins, and the West District sits atop the most spiritually rich location.</p><p>Naturally, the rent is exorbitant.</p><p>The final area is the cultivator trading district, located in the North City, adjacent to the harbor outside the city walls. It's a massive market, home to numerous guilds and auction houses.</p><p>Qin Sang revealed his cultivation.</p><p>The guard was slightly surprised, then bowed, saying, "Since you are a Golden Core cultivator, your token will be provided free of charge. You will not need to pay spirit stones to enter or leave Pingbo Port… Please wait a moment."</p><p>Shortly after, the guard delivered a token signifying Golden Core status. Qin Sang examined it, then hung it from his waist and entered the city.</p><p>The buns here, whatever meat they used, had a fishy taste and were quite unappetizing.</p><p>Disappointed, Qin Sang headed straight for the North City trading district.</p><p>Showing off one's abilities is forbidden within the city; walking is the only option.</p><p>With his token, Qin Sang passed through unimpeded and quickly arrived at the trading district.</p><p>The trading district streets are straight and intersect at right angles; the shops are uniformly designed.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his pace, observing as he walked.</p><p>Even seemingly unremarkable shops may belong to large guilds.  It's said that the most famous human guilds form a powerful alliance whose strength rivals that of top-tier sects.</p><p>"Four Seas Guild…"</p><p>Seeing a shop sign, Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>He had recently learned of several reputable guilds, and the Four Seas Guild was one of them.</p>
