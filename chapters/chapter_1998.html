<h1>Chapter 1989: Jitian Sect</h1><p>A crowd thronged the deck of the  cloud ship, admiring the magnificent scenery below.</p><p>North of the Fire Domain, there was still an endless expanse of magma.</p><p>Within the Fire Domain, one could still see mountain peaks and landmasses, like islands in a vast sea.  Here, however, the land was completely swallowed by magma.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there was only crimson.</p><p>Everywhere was a boundless sea of magma, a true ocean of molten rock, without a single place to set foot.  The Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship had been flying day and night for several days, yet it still hadn't flown out of the magma's reach.</p><p>Even cultivators of fire-based techniques from the Fire Domain wouldn't dare venture too deep.</p><p>For countless years, the magma had flowed here, the flames eternally burning. For most living beings, this place was a desolate wasteland of death.</p><p>“Look there! Look there! Is that a Phoenix Fang?”</p><p>A young woman pointed down below and shouted.</p><p>Everyone looked, and within the surging magma, a flickering crimson light could be seen.</p><p>This crimson light was deeper and more vibrant than the glow of the magma itself. However, the light was minuscule, bobbing up and down within the magma, easily overlooked.</p><p>Cultivators proficient in the Dao of Spiritual Sight circulated their True Essence and saw that the light contained a strangely shaped flower.</p><p>A flower that could bloom in magma must be a spiritual flower.  Cultivators familiar with pharmacopoeias recognized it as the rather rare spiritual flower the young woman had mentioned—the Phoenix Flower.</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>The Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship flew past the spiritual flower, and the young woman couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p>The Phoenix Fang was a medicinal herb she needed for her cultivation, and she had searched for it for a long time without success. She had hoped to find it at the Jitian Dharma Assembly, but unexpectedly, she encountered it here.</p><p>However, the Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship was flying too fast, and it was impossible for it to stop and wait for them.  She was about to miss it.</p><p>“Brother Liu, give me a hand. I'll go help Junior Sister retrieve the flower!”</p><p>A handsome young man stepped forward, took out a golden rope, and tossed it to his companion. At the same time, he leaped off the deck.</p><p>The companion caught the golden rope, flicked his wrist, and flung it downwards with force.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A golden light shot through the air, constantly trailing the young man.</p><p>The golden rope itself was less than ten feet long, but at this moment, it seemed endless, stretching infinitely as the young man shot towards the ground.</p><p>Estimating the distance, the young man executed a hand seal technique. With a single hand, he formed a seal, conjuring a giant hand in the air, reaching out to grab the spiritual flower.</p><p>At that moment, the young man suddenly sensed a faint aura within the magma, filled with滔天怒意furious rage. His heart skipped a beat, and he inwardly cried out, “Trouble!”</p><p>This flower had a guardian spirit beast!</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>The magma churned into a giant wave.  With an angry roar, a fiery red figure charged out.</p><p>Shaped like a serpent, it fiercely slammed into the conjured hand, shattering it instantly.</p><p>The spirit beast's momentum didn't stop. The young man could already see the beast's sharp fangs, his face paling slightly.</p><p>The people on the ship also noticed this scene. His companion pulled hard on the golden rope, shouting, "Danger! Brother Yin, come back quickly!"</p><p>In this critical moment, the young man snapped out of his trance. He grabbed the end of the rope, but instead of fleeing directly, he opened his mouth and spat out a beam of green light.</p><p>Within the green light was a jade ring, which suddenly expanded and then contracted, trapping the spirit beast. Like a binding hoop, it tightly restrained the creature.</p><p>*Roar!*</p><p>The spirit beast thrashed and struggled frantically. The jade ring couldn't bear the strain and immediately began to crack.</p><p>Seizing the fleeting opportunity, the young man flicked his sleeve, sending a flying sword whirling out.  The sword light swept up the spiritual flower, and at the same time, the golden rope recoiled, pulling him back towards the rapidly departing treasure ship.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The spirit beast shattered the jade ring.  Its enemy was now only a wisp of green light, disappearing within a few breaths.  It could only roar furiously in place.</p><p>Faintly hearing the mournful roars from behind, everyone on the ship felt a lingering fear as they looked at the spiritual flower in the young man’s hand.</p><p>“You truly are a hopeless romantic!”</p><p>His companion patted the young man on the shoulder.  “That Solitary Shadow Ring, I remember you were saving it as your trump card for the Dharma Assembly.  Was it worth it, just for a single Phoenix Fang?”</p><p>The young man grinned, handing the flower to the young woman.  Seeing her cradling the flower in her hands, her eyes downcast and her face flushed with shyness, it was clearly worth it.</p><p>“Look ahead!”</p><p>Shouts came from the bow, attracting everyone's attention.</p><p>The young man and woman walked side-by-side to the bow, immediately captivated by the spectacular sight before them.</p><p>Mist filled the void, thick and heavy, forming a wall of fog that stretched across the horizon.</p><p>By circulating their divine senses, they could see that this mist had boundaries, forming a long, continuous band.</p><p>They had reached the edge of the magma. Ahead lay a boundless expanse of water.</p><p>At the juncture, magma surged, and water flowed powerfully, clashing violently. Mist steamed upwards, and the earth displayed a magnificent spectacle of crimson and blue, separated by a long black line, as if marking the boundary between two distinct realms.</p><p>The Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship proudly pierced through the mist.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yunsou were enjoying tea and discussing the Dao in the quiet room.</p><p>Gu Yunsou glanced outside and said, “We’ve entered Yuanlan Lake. Fellow Daoist Yu’s estate is in the northern region of Yuanlan Lake.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed out, unable to see the boundaries. It was unexpectedly just a lake.</p><p>“Is Fellow Daoist Yu’s Ancient Grain Garden on an island in the center of the lake?” Qin Sang judged from the name that the Ancient Grain Garden’s heritage might be related to wood-type cultivation.</p><p>“You’ll see when we arrive, Daoist Master.”</p><p>Gu Yunsou smiled mysteriously, keeping him in suspense. Then, he said seriously, “We’re planning to enter the Small Thousand World. If we want to find allies, Fellow Daoist Yu’s Ancient Grain Garden is our best choice.”</p><p>“Oh?”  Qin Sang’s expression remained unchanged as he listened to Gu Yunsou’s explanation.</p><p>“In his youth, Fellow Daoist Yu was a brilliant young talent. He won the heart of a fairy from the Jitian Sect, and the two became Dao companions.  It was quite the story at the time.  Unfortunately, that fairy failed to break through to the Void Refinement stage and her lifespan came to an end.  However, because of this connection, Fellow Daoist Yu has some influence within the Jitian Sect.”</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang pondered and asked, “Was Fellow Daoist Yu’s Dao companion a descendant of one of the elders?”</p><p>This wasn’t a casual question.</p><p>While it was good that the Ancient Grain Garden had a connection to the Jitian Sect, too much of a good thing could be a bad thing.</p><p>If the Ancient Grain Garden was too powerful, they might try to take control, leaving Qingyang Temple with mere scraps.  And they wouldn't dare to complain.</p><p>“Back then, the Ancient Grain Garden wasn’t a renowned sect, and Fellow Daoist Yu’s Dao companion was just an ordinary disciple. After Fellow Daoist Yu broke through to Void Refinement, they received some attention, but still couldn’t compare to the descendants of the Jitian Sect elders,” Gu Yunsou explained, sensing Qin Sang's concerns.</p><p>The elders of the Jitian Sect were all Void Refinement cultivators, holding high positions, wielding great power, and possessing extraordinary cultivation.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Yu is precisely worried that the connection is fading.  This time, he brought his most promising disciple, hoping to arrange another marriage alliance at the Dharma Assembly,” Gu Yunsou said with a smile.</p><p>This showed that the relationship between the Ancient Grain Garden and the Jitian Sect wasn't particularly close.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, and asked, “Have you spoken with him?”</p><p>“Not yet,” Gu Yunsou shook his head.  “Of course, I need to discuss it with you, Daoist Master, first. This Fellow Daoist Yu is quite shrewd, and his appetite won't be small.”</p><p>“First, ask him to inquire about the information regarding that Small Cave World. We can discuss other matters later.  If we truly need to borrow the Ancient Grain Garden's influence, this poor Daoist won't be stingy,” Qin Sang declared decisively.</p><p>An innocent man is not guilty, but a valuable jade attracts thieves.</p><p>He never intended for Qingyang Temple to monopolize the Small Cave World. The legacy of the Soulfall Abyss was more than enough for Qingyang Temple.</p><p>After flying for several days, upon seeing the gates of the Ancient Grain Garden, Qin Sang understood why Gu Yunsou's tone had been so peculiar.</p><p>The gate of the Ancient Grain Garden was a colossal ancient tree.</p><p>The trunk of this ancient tree lay horizontally, floating on the water's surface, drifting with the current.</p><p>The trunk was several thousand zhang wide, and its enormous crown alone resembled a lush, green island.  The Ancient Grain Garden was built upon this trunk.</p><p>The ancient tree looked like an ordinary Spirit Locust, but a Spirit Locust of this size was definitely extraordinary.</p><p>As the Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship reached the Ancient Grain Garden, streams of light flew up from below, boarding the ship.</p><p>Qin Sang and Gu Yunsou went out to greet them together and met Sect Master Yu.</p><p>Sect Master Yu was dressed in a blue robe, with a fair complexion, resembling a middle-aged scholar. His eyes were bright and piercing, flashing with sharp intelligence.</p><p>Upon seeing Qin Sang, Sect Master Yu’s eyes lit up.  He stepped forward and bowed, “So this is Daoist Qingfeng, who eradicated that Corpse Demon.  I’ve long admired your name!”</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t about to be modest.  The more confident he appeared, the more others would be wary of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>“This poor Daoist has also long admired Sect Master Yu’s reputation,” Qin Sang returned the greeting.</p><p>“Heh heh, that Corpse Demon was a ferocious menace, acting with reckless abandon. He also once provoked me.  If I weren’t tied down by sect matters, I would have certainly settled the score with him that day.  Daoist Master’s act of slaying the demon and upholding righteousness was truly exhilarating!  However, that Corpse Demon had a few like-minded devilish companions who will also be attending the Jitian Dharma Assembly.  Daoist Master should be careful,” Sect Master Yu offered a seemingly well-intentioned warning.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he calmly replied, "Since ancient times, righteousness has always triumphed over evil.  It's simply a matter of meeting force with force, and water with earth."</p><p>After slaying Patriarch Ming Hu, he naturally investigated the demon's background.</p><p>The demon didn’t have any powerful backing, and his associates were mostly at the early Void Refinement stage, with no deeply connected strong figures.</p><p>Before, he might have been apprehensive.</p><p>The battle with Patriarch Ming Hu had proven his strength, and his cultivation had increased significantly since then. He didn't fear any cultivator of the same realm.</p><p>Moreover, those in the demonic path were cunning and deceitful, constantly wary of each other. They wouldn’t risk their lives to avenge Patriarch Ming Hu.</p><p>Sect Master Yu was secretly surprised. He had initially assumed that Qin Sang was a helper invited by Gu Yunsou, and that the elimination of Patriarch Ming Hu was due to Gu Yunsou's scheming.</p><p>Could it be that Gu Yunsou hadn't exaggerated earlier?</p><p>Sect Master Yu laughed heartily, "Daoist Master needn't worry. Those devils are selfish and won't act without benefit.  If anyone dares to step out of line, we won't allow them to run rampant!"</p><p>"This poor Daoist thanks both fellow Daoists in advance," Qin Sang smiled faintly and bowed in return.</p><p>"This isn't the place to talk. Sect Master Yu, why don't you join us in the quiet room for a chat?"</p><p>Gu Yunsou interjected at the opportune moment, instructing Yun Xi to accommodate the Ancient Grain Garden disciples.</p><p>The three of them walked towards the quiet room.</p><p>Sect Master Yu explained to Qin Sang, "My sect's flying artifact is no match for Cloud Firmament City’s Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship. Last time, outside the Jitian Sect, I was almost ridiculed.  I won't embarrass myself this time and will bask in Fellow Daoist Gu Yunsou’s glory."</p><p>Gu Yunsou chuckled, "Once you meet Fellow Daoist Ying, Sect Master Yu, you can decide whether the Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship or the Shangling Palace is more to your liking."</p><p>"Oh? Fellow Daoist Ying will also be traveling with us?" Sect Master Yu looked at Qin Sang and then at Gu Yunsou, his words laden with meaning. "Fellow Daoist, your ambitions are quite grand this time!"</p><p>After picking up the Ancient Grain Garden cultivators, the Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship continued north.</p><p>Flying out of Yuanlan Lake, they finally saw normal land, but it was vast stretches of jungle, devoid of human presence.</p><p>Along the way, the Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship occasionally changed course, visiting other fellow Daoists and making brief stops.</p><p>In this stop-and-go manner, they flew for three months.</p><p>Qin Sang was cultivating alone in the quiet room when he suddenly felt the restriction at the door being triggered. Gu Yunsou's voice came in.</p><p>"Daoist Master, are you awake? We've arrived at the Jitian Sect."</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. He pushed the door open and walked out, shoulder-to-shoulder with Gu Yunsou, ascending to the deck and gazing towards the horizon.</p><p>The vast earth, crisscrossed by rivers.</p><p>Above the layers of mountain shadows, azure light radiated in myriad beams, dazzling and brilliant, the sky pristine and clear.</p><p>The tangible azure light, smooth as silk, weaved into a gigantic banner floating in the sky, stretching for who knew how many thousands or tens of thousands of li.</p><p>It danced in the wind, rippling like clear waves.</p><p>Even before entering the Jitian Sect, such a magnificent spectacle unfolded. It truly lived up to its reputation as the number one sect in the Moon Ripple Bay!</p><p>The gate of the Jitian Sect was hidden within the azure light.</p><p>While admiring the beautiful scenery, Qin Sang glanced to the side of the Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship.  Above the clouds, a magnificent palace flew alongside them.</p><p>This palace was Fellow Daoist Ying’s Shangling Palace.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang noticed that from time to time, beams of light would merge into the azure radiance. These were various flying artifacts.</p><p>These flying artifacts were all exceptionally luxurious, showcasing the grandeur of major sects. Qin Sang couldn’t help but marvel at the sight.</p><p>The two flying artifacts soared over countless mountain ranges, reaching the edge of the azure light.  Not only did their speed not decrease, but their momentum intensified.</p><p>The Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship unfurled a giant sail, its brilliance complementing the azure light. Below the ship, azure waves appeared, billowing as if sailing from the sea towards the heavens.</p><p>The Shangling Palace transformed into a majestic divine palace, with the clouds below shifting and changing, resembling dragons and phoenixes, and even seeming to contain a myriad of common people living within, a scene of profound mystery.</p><p>*Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship entered the azure light.</p><p>In an instant, a fantastic and magnificent scene unfolded before their eyes.</p><p>Here, the green mountains were like dark jade, encompassing the spiritual essence of heaven and earth.  Immortal mountains rose in countless numbers.</p><p>Upon these green mountains, lush vegetation thrived, presenting a scene of pristine natural beauty.</p><p>Between the mountains, arched bridges connected them, arranged in a picturesque manner, with green and white intermingling, adorned with touches of pale pink, a sight of unparalleled beauty.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see that these arched bridges were actually vines, growing from one mountain to another, forming pathways between them.</p><p>Green tendrils hung down from the vines, resembling railings, and at the ends of these tendrils hung lantern-sized flowers.</p><p>Some were white, some pink, pure and elegant, blooming perennially.</p><p>“The Jitian Sect is deep within the azure light. This is the outer city, where the Jitian Dharma Assembly will be held.”</p><p>Gu Yunsou transmitted his explanation through sound.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but sigh.  How could this resemble a city?</p><p>The so-called city referred to these green mountains connected by vines, where people resided beneath the trees, traversing the vine bridges, completely integrated with nature.</p><p>Bursts of clamor reached their ears.</p><p>Crowds gathered on the mountain peaks, commenting on the incoming flying artifacts without any restraint.</p><p>Their mockery was especially loud.</p><p>“Hiss! Did you see that flying eagle? It’s refined from a Void Refinement stage demon corpse by Cold Jade Mountain! Don’t laugh! Don’t laugh!”</p><p>“Eh? That Cloudsoaring Treasure Ship, the markings on it… seem to be the one Cloud Firmament City recently acquired.”</p><p>“Isn’t that Shangling Academy’s Shangling Palace? They haven’t changed it in how many years?”</p><p>“Could it be they can’t afford a new flying artifact? Shangling Academy truly is declining with each generation.  It seems they’re destined for decay.”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways at the Shangling Palace and saw Sect Master Ying’s face darken slightly.  He hadn't expected that not replacing a flying artifact for many years would also be a cause for ridicule.</p>
