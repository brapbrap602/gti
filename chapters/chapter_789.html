<h1>Chapter 781: Transmission</h1><p>Fifth Floor…</p><p>Sixth Floor…</p><p>They advanced rapidly, reaching the sixth floor in one go.</p><p>Emerging from the teleportation array, everyone's expression turned grave.</p><p>If the Celestial Tower was a trial ground, this floor was designed for late-stage Core Formation cultivators. Although they didn't face the siege of puppets in the teleportation hall, they could encounter puppet ambushes at any time while searching for the teleportation array.</p><p>After their previous experiences, they had developed excellent teamwork.</p><p>The size of the ancient halls increased with each ascending floor. They fought off puppets while searching blindly in the darkness.</p><p>"Watch out below!" Yin suddenly shouted, sensing something.</p><p>The others reacted swiftly.</p><p>The old woman clasped her hands together. Her bronze mirror vibrated, emitting a flickering yellow light, and projecting a massive phantom that enveloped everyone in a yellow protective shield.</p><p>Simultaneously, the small shield orbiting them split into five.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…*</p><p>The small shields shot downwards, each perfectly protecting one person.</p><p>A double layer of defense was instantly established.</p><p>Qin Sang kept his eyes on the two magical treasures, making sure there were no gaps in their defense before looking away. He wouldn't entrust his life to others. If anything unexpected happened, he could summon his Twin-Headed Serpent Staff at any moment.</p><p>At the same time, Di abruptly flicked his sleeve, and a crimson glow shot out from it, striking downwards with lightning speed.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A series of muffled sounds erupted, and several shadowy figures appeared in the darkness.</p><p>These puppets all looked the same, resembling leopards with slender bodies, clearly indicating their agility. From their limbs to their heads, they were covered in black scales, forming a tight armor, even covering their eyes. When they closed their eyes, there were no visible weaknesses.</p><p>Qin Sang had seen similar scales on the puppets of the fifth floor.  They were extremely hard, and the scales on these Leopard Puppets were noticeably thicker and stronger.</p><p>The Leopard Puppets' claws were tipped with razor-sharp nails. Their most peculiar feature was a single horn on their heads, crafted from some kind of black crystal, extremely sharp and pointed.</p><p>These puppets were entirely black, allowing them to blend seamlessly into the darkness.</p><p>Moreover, their movements were completely silent. If Yin hadn't detected them in time, they wouldn't have known until the puppets were upon them.</p><p>The crimson glow forced the Leopard Puppets out of hiding but only momentarily halted their advance.</p><p>These puppets didn't understand pain. They lowered their heads and charged, combining their strength to scatter the crimson glow before silently pouncing on them.</p><p>There were six puppets in total.</p><p>The bronze mirror flickered, projecting a beam of yellow light, knocking one puppet away.</p><p>Wu controlled his shield, engaging one puppet.</p><p>Di and Qin Sang each faced two.</p><p>In an instant, magical treasures flashed, and streams of true essence flew everywhere.</p><p>Yin stared intently at the puppets, her eyes emitting a strange light as she activated a secret technique to search for their weaknesses.</p><p>"Something's not right!" Di said, his expression hardening slightly, seeming to have noticed something.</p><p>Just then, the Leopard Puppets abandoned their attack and retreated.</p><p>It was the first time they encountered such a situation.  While they were puzzled, the Leopard Puppets gathered together, their dark eyes fixated on them without a flicker, an eerie sight.</p><p>Then, they all pointed their horns at them.</p><p>*Crackle…*</p><p>The tips of the horns suddenly lit up, surging with lightning that gradually formed into lightning orbs.</p><p>Even more alarming, the six lightning orbs began to merge.</p><p>Even before the lightning orbs were unleashed, everyone felt a sense of danger.  Being hit by them wouldn't be pleasant.</p><p>"We absolutely cannot let those lightning orbs fuse!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed slightly. He shouted urgently and then, without hesitation, activated his Ebony Sword, unleashing Sword Qi Thunderclap towards a Leopard Puppet.  The others also realized the urgency and attacked with their magical treasures.</p><p>At that moment, Yin's eyes lit up. She had finally found something.  "The eyes are the weak point! And both eyes must be hit simultaneously!"</p><p>"No wonder previous attacks on the eyes were ineffective. So that's how it is…"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. At the last moment, he changed his target.</p><p>His sword light flashed like lightning, veering mid-air and thrusting straight at the Leopard Puppet's head.  Then, the sword light flickered and split into two, aiming directly for both eyes.</p><p>Sword Qi Thunderclap was incredibly fast. The Leopard Puppet didn't have time to close its scales. The Ebony Sword easily pierced both its eyes.</p><p>The next moment, the Leopard Puppet froze, the lightning orb on its horn silently dissipating. Then, its body seemed to weather away, turning into dust and scattering as the Ebony Sword stirred within it.</p><p>Finally having found the weakness, everyone's spirits lifted, and they worked together to create openings for Qin Sang.</p><p>Soon, all six Leopard Puppets were slain by Qin Sang's sword.</p><p>The old woman sighed, "On the sixth floor, each puppet has unique abilities, and their weaknesses are increasingly hidden. Their destructive power far surpasses that of the lower floors. If the teleportation hall and passage hadn't been destroyed, even with our combined strength, we would have struggled to break in and find the teleportation array."</p><p>Di said with a relaxed expression, "Thanks to Fellow Daoist Yin's mastery of puppetry and Fellow Daoist Qin's exceptional swordsmanship, perfectly suited for dealing with puppets, our partnership has proved fruitful.  Those who entered before us are probably not as far along. At our pace, we should be the first to reach the top."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Di, don't forget about those Nascent Soul Patriarchs! And your Wu Clan elders.  They invaded in force and have probably turned the Celestial Tower upside down. I just hope they don't take a liking to the treasures I seek."</p><p>The old woman poured cold water on their enthusiasm, her expression pessimistic.</p><p>Everyone's smiles faded, but they couldn't do anything about it.</p><p>Only Qin Sang remained relaxed. He didn't covet treasures. The more those Nascent Soul cultivators unearthed, the better. He could follow the clues and find what he was looking for.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Patriarchs loomed over them like a dark cloud.</p><p>Everyone fell silent and continued onward.</p><p>They encountered several more puppet ambushes, all of which they overcame.</p><p>After searching the sixth floor extensively, they finally found the teleportation array!</p><p>In an open area, a three-tiered platform floated gently, quite inconspicuous. The entire hall had crumbled, nowhere to be seen. Fortunately, the teleportation array on the platform remained intact.</p><p>"We finally found it!"</p><p>Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, gazing at the teleportation array with delight and flying towards it eagerly.</p><p>"Once we're up there, do you have any interest in continuing our partnership?" Yin suddenly asked.</p><p>To her disappointment, the old woman shook her head.  "I'd like to have help, but the place I'm going is special. It requires a specific token to enter, and I only have one. I'm afraid we can't continue together. Let's part ways here. Perhaps we'll have a chance to cooperate again in the future."</p><p>Qin Sang and the others echoed her sentiment.</p><p>*Whoosh, whoosh…*</p><p>Everyone flew towards the stone platform.</p><p>Unexpectedly,</p><p>Just as they reached the edge of the platform, the teleportation array lit up without warning, and a figure slowly materialized on the platform.</p>
