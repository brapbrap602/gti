<h1>Chapter 1497: The Godbird Shield</h1><p>Chapter 1497: The Godbird Shield</p><p>The oppressive aura emanating from Xuanjian Tower was no less intense than that of the four serpentine seals when they were unaffected by Liuli!</p><p>Such an aura could only be produced by a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace actually possesses two spiritual treasures!</p><p>Qin Sang gasped, then his expression shifted slightly, as if he sensed something.</p><p>“No, it seems different from the four serpentine seals…”</p><p>Qin Sang had this feeling, but couldn't pinpoint the difference between Xuanjian Tower and the four serpentine seals.</p><p>After all, he had seen very few spiritual treasures.</p><p>Xuanjian Tower didn't seem to be a true spiritual treasure.</p><p>Xuanjian Tower was clearly Yin Changsheng's life-bound treasure, not an inherited treasure of Xuan Tian Palace, but rather something Yin Changsheng had refined himself.</p><p>Refining a life-bound spiritual treasure at the Yuan Ying stage was simply astounding!</p><p>Regardless of whether Xuanjian Tower was a spiritual treasure or a magic treasure, the oppressive aura it emitted was undeniable, and its power was probably no weaker than the four serpentine seals initially!</p><p>The danger he faced would not lessen in the slightest.</p><p>This time, he had no Liuli to help contain his opponent.</p><p>“Forcing me to use my Xuanjian Tower, you have reason to be proud.”</p><p>Yin Changsheng spoke more than before.</p><p>His expression was even more distorted.</p><p>Years ago, Yin Changsheng had set his sights on the Hunmo Elder, planning to lure him into the sacred land and capture him alive. Many of his preparations were designed to counter the Elder's demonic arts.</p><p>Qin Sang rose to prominence ten years ago, and Liuli's divine abilities only became widely known six months ago. Yin Changsheng changed his target at the last minute, but didn't have time to make more thorough preparations.</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng believed that with the four serpentine seals, the Luoyou Divine Restriction, and numerous other abilities, subduing a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator should be a simple matter.</p><p>He hadn't expected Tong Lingyu's scheme to be so profound, meticulously finding ways to counter him.</p><p>Qin Sang's strength far surpassed those of his cultivation level, comparable to that of a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>If he hadn't been unable to subdue Qin Sang quickly, and hadn't been pushed to this point, Yin Changsheng wouldn't have used Xuanjian Tower.</p><p>As his life-bound treasure, Xuanjian Tower could help him stabilize his mind.  Its forced deployment against his enemy had an immediate effect, but Yin Changsheng's composure grew even more unstable, even showing on his face.</p><p>‘Ding-ling-ling…’</p><p>Xuanjian Tower floated before Yin Changsheng.</p><p>Nine inverted miniature swords moved without wind, gently swaying within the tower, emitting a continuous sound – not the roar of swords, but a clear, bell-like chime.</p><p>The sound was pleasant.</p><p>To Qin Sang, however, it sounded like the death knell!</p><p>The madness in Yin Changsheng's eyes intensified.  He stared intently at Qin Sang, his killing intent reaching the heavens, causing violent waves in the cold mist surrounding the ice coffin.</p><p>‘Ding-ling-ling! Ding-ling-ling!’</p><p>The miniature swords swayed violently.</p><p>Each sword was small, crystal clear.</p><p>The ancient characters on the swords glowed, shimmering with a kaleidoscope of colors.</p><p>An astonishing sight appeared: countless illusory sword energies appeared on each layer.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>These sword energies transformed into streaks of light, rapidly rotating around Xuanjian Tower, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>At this moment, the nine-story ice tower seemed to be surrounded by countless sword energies, transforming into a genuine sword tower, but lacking any corresponding sword intent.</p><p>Xuanjian Tower only had a name and appearance related to swords; it wasn't a true sword Dao treasure, but rather a sword-shaped artifact refined using special methods.</p><p>This was an ultimate offensive magic treasure; each illusory sword energy was a concentrated killing intent!</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>Yin Changsheng roared.</p><p>A buzzing sound constantly emanated from Xuanjian Tower. The ancient characters on the nine miniature swords shone even more brilliantly, and the illusory sword energies were swallowed by the light, transforming into a mass of colorful clouds.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>Xuanjian Tower suddenly appeared in mid-air, and a wave of colorful light shot out, fast as lightning!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang felt a sharp pain in his Baihui acupoint, his scalp tingling. He had no doubt that if he were struck by the light, he would be either killed or severely injured, completely unable to escape Yin Changsheng's grasp.</p><p>…</p><p>Liuli could feel the imminent danger, her expression showing despair. She had done everything she could, but still couldn't change the outcome.</p><p>She could influence Yin Changsheng, but couldn't seize the four serpentine seals from him.</p><p>She was too weak!</p><p>At this moment, Liuli felt an overwhelming sense of powerlessness.</p><p>In the end, she died with him.</p><p>Liuli's eyelids fluttered, and she opened her eyes to see Qin Sang's profile.  The scene from that night resurfaced, a memory she'd been trying to forget. Who could have imagined that one night of… entanglement would lead to so many connections between them?</p><p>Reflecting on her life, she realized her first half had been dedicated to selfless cultivation to save her master, and the second to painstakingly escaping the effects of a demonic power.  Her mind had been relentlessly tense, never at ease.</p><p>Liuli looked upwards, her gaze seeming to pierce the void, reaching her master whose fate was unknown.  Her expression was a blend of relief and regret.</p><p>"Master, I am so tired."</p><p>...</p><p>Unaware of Liuli's thoughts, Qin Sang keenly observed the change in Yin Changsheng's state.  His mind raced, and with a flick of his finger, a crimson flame shot out from his Qianjun ring.</p><p>This flame was even more dazzling than the rainbow light.  Inside the flame, a sacred tree slowly rotated, its trunk wreathed in eternal flames. Nine divine birds, heads held high and tails gracefully curved, were vividly etched upon it.</p><p>Qin Sang had actually unleashed the Sun God Tree!</p><p>The instant the flame appeared, Yin Changsheng's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>A fierce look flashed in Qin Sang's eyes as he roared, his true energy surging forth like a tidal wave.</p><p>The flames on the sacred tree surged, and the three uppermost birds came to life, their expressions suddenly more animated. They spread their wings, detached from the tree, and shot towards the rainbow light like arrows, unafraid.</p><p>Mid-flight, the three birds merged into one, indistinguishable from each other.</p><p>This was the culmination of Qin Sang's years of refinement, compressing the three birds.  While not directly increasing the explosive power, it concentrated the energy of the Nanming Li Fire.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>'Whizz!'</p><p>In an instant, the rainbow light and the divine bird collided.</p><p>Initially, there was no earth-shattering sound, only an eerie silence. The speed of the rainbow light slowed abruptly, the constantly flowing 'sword energy' becoming stagnant, while the Sun God bird vanished, absorbed into the rainbow light.</p><p>However, all three present could feel an incredibly terrifying energy brewing, poised to explode.</p><p>The explosion came swiftly.</p><p>The rainbow light swelled suddenly, like a rapidly expanding sphere, its surface cracking with crimson fissures, from which flames gushed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A light brighter than the sun illuminated the cavern.</p><p>Two attacks far exceeding the power of any magical artifact unleashed chaotic energy streams, forming an energy storm in mid-air. The thick ice layer covering the ground was completely obliterated, leaving only a blinding expanse.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed Liuli, and they swiftly moved to avoid the blast's aftershocks.  He’d used the Sun God bird as a shield, directly confronting the Xuanjian Building's rainbow light; there was no need to worry about a miss.</p>
