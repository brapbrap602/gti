<h1>Chapter 871: Landou Island</h1><p>Chapter 871: Landou Island</p><p>The shopkeeper was very likely a Wu tribe spy.</p><p>Unfortunately, he wasn't caught, and there's no evidence.</p><p>The shopkeeper was only a pre-Golden Core cultivator, and the strong demonic aura on him showed he used demonic pills to forcibly advance to the Golden Core stage.  He's unlikely to be much of a threat.</p><p>Someone like that daring to cause trouble is basically courting death.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the shopkeeper, but he was worried about other spies in Tianxing City, watching his cave abode.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang didn't act rashly. He took his external avatar and rented a new cave abode nearby under the identity of Daoist Qingfeng, to observe secretly.</p><p>Everything in the cave abode was as usual, the restrictions intact.</p><p>Back in Tianxing City, after getting close, Qin Sang could communicate with his external avatar telepathically.</p><p>His external avatar hadn't detected any signs of surveillance.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang frequently contacted old friends, gathering information through various channels.</p><p>Three days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang confirmed no one was lying in wait, and immediately moved his external avatar, while he himself continued to watch the original cave abode, planning to use it as bait.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. No suspicious individuals appeared.</p><p>The shopkeeper completely vanished.</p><p>The Black Serpent Mountain disciples and the Wu tribe spies probably realized how difficult it was to assassinate a human Golden Core cultivator in Tianxing City and retreated.</p><p>This removed a problem for Qin Sang, but the clues also disappeared.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang's information gathering wasn't going well; he couldn't confirm the origins of the mysterious people. They were extremely secretive and low-profile, virtually unknown.</p><p>“It seems that to find out the identities of these mysterious people, I'll have to return to that sea area and search for clues myself…”</p><p>Qin Sang sat in his new cave abode, pondering.</p><p>In truth, he knew very well that it was almost impossible to use this lead to trouble Black Serpent Mountain. They had already succeeded and likely erased all traces, escaping.</p><p>The reason he persisted in the investigation was his interest in that lightning control technique.</p><p>Qin Sang still vividly remembered being engulfed by the lightning. If he could master that technique, he could not only utilize the Star煞 energy but also gain a powerful new ability.</p><p>Revenge against Black Serpent Mountain was secondary.</p><p>In the two conflicts, he hadn't suffered any significant losses.  Black Serpent Mountain, on the other hand, had lost two Golden Core cultivators, suffering heavy casualties.  They should be the ones feeling angry.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wasn't one to wait for his enemies to come to him; he would definitely make Black Serpent Mountain pay. If he couldn't find the lightning control technique, he might be able to obtain it from Black Serpent Mountain cultivators.</p><p>However, the unrest in the Demon Sea hadn't subsided; he couldn't just invade the Wu God Continent.</p><p>“Before I go, I need to settle my external avatar.”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, glancing at his avatar who was in meditative cultivation.</p><p>With the help of the blood sacrifice, the external avatar's cultivation speed was astonishing.</p><p>After the Yuan Tai was formed, in just a few months, he had made consecutive breakthroughs and was now at the sixth level of Qi Condensation, one level higher than his original cultivation before death.</p><p>This was why Qin Sang had gone to such lengths to cultivate an external avatar.  Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the external avatar's strength would definitely meet the requirements before the next Seven Kills Hall opening.</p><p>The external avatar's Foundation Establishment required Qin Sang to perform a secret technique, a technique that could only be used when the external avatar cultivates to the thirteenth level of Qi Condensation, and the spiritual energy in his Qi Sea reaches its peak.</p><p>However, at this rate, as long as he has a stable place to cultivate, it won't take too long.</p><p>“Tianxing City is unstable. I'll take him to Landou Island. After returning from there, I will go to Landou Island to investigate the Landou Sect's stellar cultivation technique, which will probably take some time. Bringing the external avatar nearby allows me to easily provide blood sacrifices.  Landou Island also has a market; there are bound to be good cave abodes…”</p><p>Qin Sang made his decision.</p><p>The Wu tribe spy hadn't shown up, and he didn't want to wait any longer.  He went for a walk outside the city, confirming there were no trackers, before leaving with his external avatar.</p><p>Before leaving, in a bid to annoy Black Serpent Mountain, Qin Sang spread the news of the Wu tribe infiltration and the massacre of human cultivators. Whether it would have a significant impact, he didn't know.</p><p>…</p><p>The Landou Sect's mountain gate is located north of Tianxing Island.</p><p>The island where the Landou Sect is located is called Landou Island.  The name itself suggests that the Landou Sect is the undisputed overlord on the island.</p><p>However, Landou Island is vast; it's impossible for the Landou Sect to occupy it entirely. There are many other large and small sects and forces on the island, but they are not as powerful as the Landou Sect and can only live under their shadow.</p><p>As time went on, the situation gradually changed.</p><p>The Landou Sect was once very powerful, holding considerable sway. The sect even had more than one Nascent Soul ancestor.  For some reason, it gradually weakened, and now only two Nascent Soul cultivators support the sect, one of whom is the Landou Sect Master.</p><p>This Landou Sect Master, whose lifespan is nearing a thousand years, has still not broken through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  His next tribulation is approaching, and it's almost impossible for him to survive.</p><p>Another individual is shrouded in mystery.  Also elderly, news of a serious injury surfaced many years ago, after which they vanished without a trace, possibly deceased.</p><p>There is no strong leader among their successors.</p><p>Lan Dou Gate remains a dominant force, but its decline is almost certain.  Various sects on Lan Dou Island are stirring, with outside influences clearly at play.</p><p>Qin Sang, using a physical clone, traveled cautiously, taking a month and a half to reach Lan Dou Island.</p><p>En route, they disguised themselves as master and disciple, a convincing enough façade.</p><p>“Lan Dou Gate’s main gate is nestled within Lan Dou Island’s largest mountain range.  Near the gate is a large market, established by Lan Dou Gate.  I intend to acquire Lan Dou Gate’s cultivation techniques. While I won't resort to force, it's safer to store the clone a considerable distance away…”</p><p>After brief reflection, Qin Sang located a cultivator nearby, inquired about the island's geography, selected a location, and after half a day's flight with the clone, arrived at a rather picturesque mountain.</p><p>To avoid attention, Qin Sang used the *Dun Ling Jue* technique to suppress his cultivation to the late Foundation Establishment stage. Unless confronted by someone significantly stronger or possessing treasure-detecting artifacts, his true cultivation would remain hidden.</p><p>He retrieved his previous flying artifact, the You Luo Cloud, and, with the clone, flew to the mountain's vicinity before discreetly landing and ascending on foot.</p><p>Without needing the Sky-Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang instantly recognized the faint mist enshrouding the summit as an illusionary array.  A single path provided access.</p><p>The market's size was second only to Lan Dou Gate's, a joint venture of several island factions.</p><p>Qin Sang took a stroll, noting the market's relatively orderly nature, the cultivators behaving themselves and refraining from violence. He found this encouraging and rented a cave dwelling.</p><p>The dwelling's quality wasn't as good as those in Bao Gu Mountain, but the clone's low cultivation level didn't demand much spiritual energy; it was more than sufficient.</p>
