<h1>Chapter 1245: The Monster</h1><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The bottom of the Blood River had turned into a sea of flames.</p><p>The once-confused blood shadows, sensing the overwhelming danger emanating from the demonic flames, dared not approach.</p><p>Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo had unleashed their full might, clashing in countless exchanges. Dongyang Bo was desperate to escape, while Qin Sang was equally strained, exerting all his energy to control the demonic flames and trap Dongyang Bo. Not only was his mental energy severely depleted, but his true essence was also being rapidly drained by the eighteen demon banners.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dongyang Bo reacted too swiftly, making the best possible countermoves. Qin Sang had yet to fully encircle him with the demonic flames, or else the battle would have been somewhat easier.</p><p>Near the battlefield, the Nascent Soul puppet was trapped deep within the blood mist, relentlessly attacking a jade bottle, causing the spirit formation to tremble unsteadily.</p><p>Beneath the formation, the blood mist began to churn silently, as if something hidden beneath it had been awakened by the battle.</p><p>Soon, a small vortex appeared within the blood mist, generating a suction force that enveloped both the formation and the Nascent Soul puppet, threatening to drag them down.</p><p>At first, the suction was weak.</p><p>But as the vortex grew larger, both the Nascent Soul puppet and the jade bottle formation began to descend uncontrollably.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo were locked in fierce combat, oblivious to the strange phenomena unfolding around them.</p><p>The treasure lamp, its body destroyed, had only a limited time before its flame would extinguish.</p><p>Before the flame died out, Dongyang Bo had to escape, or the situation would become even more dire. Even if he managed to flee, seizing the puppet would be impossible.</p><p>After this prolonged struggle, Dongyang Bo had concluded that while Qin Sang was stronger than the Ghost Yin Patriarch, his control over the demonic flames was still limited.</p><p>With a grim resolve, Dongyang Bo suddenly let out a muffled groan, his face flushing red as he spat out a mouthful of vital blood onto the Diamond Ring. His vitality visibly waned.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang knew something was amiss.</p><p>The Diamond Ring erupted with countless rays of light, shining like a great sun.</p><p>In that instant, Dongyang Bo's figure vanished, as if he had merged with the Diamond Ring. The surrounding demonic flames, as if ensnared by the ring, began to stagnate.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and immediately poured all his remaining energy into driving the other demonic flames forward.</p><p>At that moment, eight identical light spheres emerged from the great sun, each containing a Dongyang Bo. Qin Sang quickly ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to scrutinize them, but the butterfly's vision was hindered by the intense light, making it difficult to discern the real one.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had heard rumors of Qin Sang's ability to see through illusions, so he had prepared for this.</p><p>Qin Sang soon realized that these eight Dongyang Bos were not mere illusions. The Diamond Ring rang out chaotically, each strike leaving trails of light in the void.</p><p>In the chaos, Qin Sang managed to destroy half of them with the demonic flames.</p><p>With a cold snort, the remaining four figures successfully broke free from the flames!</p><p>Qin Sang's face turned grim. Dongyang Bo had sacrificed his vital blood to activate his life-bound treasure, and even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly couldn't see through it. Moreover, his sole focus was on escape, and Qin Sang could no longer contain him.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang abandoned the demon banners and secretly formed a hand seal. Thunder rumbled within his body.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Dongyang Bo burst through the flames, ignoring Qin Sang as one of his figures lunged toward the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang nearly laughed in frustration.</p><p>Even at this critical moment, the old fox hadn't forgotten about the Nascent Soul puppet!</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A sudden thunderclap.</p><p>Dongyang Bo's heart skipped a beat, knowing he couldn't withstand this thunder.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The thunder technique struck directly.</p><p>The figure that took the brunt of the heavenly thunder didn't even struggle, instantly turning to dustâ€”it was an illusion.</p><p>At the same time, a giant hand emerged from another figure, reaching for the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>To make matters worse, as the thunder descended, the giant hand conjured by Dongyang Bo was pierced by a silver thread as fine as a hair, dissipating on the spot. The figure was then pierced by a sword.</p><p>In an instant, six figures were destroyed.</p><p>A sword beam shot through the air, aiming to kill the last two.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was stunned, realizing Qin Sang had summoned the Ebony Sword again. His hope of seizing the puppet was dashed.</p><p>Only two of his illusionary figures remained, and with his vital blood severely depleted, he feared he might not even escape with his life. He let out a sigh, lamenting the decline of his heroic days, his strength no longer matching his ambition.</p><p>The two figures split, one to the left and one to the right, diving into the Blood River and disappearing in rapid flashes.</p><p>Qin Sang, unable to stop them, frowned deeply.</p><p>At that moment, he heard the Nascent Soul puppet let out a strange cry, finally noticing its unusual state.</p><p>A vortex had appeared in the blood mist at some point, causing the jade bottle formation to tilt. The Nascent Soul puppet, unable to resist the suction, was being pulled in.</p><p>Sensing the vortex, Qin Sang felt a strange aura within, as if something had been awakened by their battle, sending a chill down his spine.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, glancing in the direction Dongyang Bo had fled.</p><p>Confident in his escape techniques, he could likely catch one of the figures, but it might not be Dongyang Bo's true body. These figures seemed capable of shifting between reality and illusion, a truly profound technique.</p><p>Even if he caught up, Dongyang Bo was now on high alert, making it nearly impossible to lure him into a trap again.</p><p>Moreover, lingering here too long might lead to unforeseen changes. At the very least, the Nascent Soul puppet would likely be devoured by the unknown entity below.</p><p>A Nascent Soul-level puppet was a rare treasure.</p><p>Though Qin Sang knew little about puppetry, he could entrust it to Qing Jun, potentially gaining a powerful ally in the future.</p><p>This hasty attempt to trap and kill Dongyang Bo had always been a long shot. As the leader of a sect and one who frequented the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, Dongyang Bo was far more formidable than the average mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Forcing Dongyang Bo to spit blood and destroy his own treasure, while also seizing the Nascent Soul puppet, was already a significant victory.</p><p>In the future, Qin Sang would only need to be wary of Dongyang Bo's retaliation. With Bai and the puppet's assistance, he had little to fear.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang decided to abandon the pursuit.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he recalled the Ebony Sword and the eighteen demon banners, summoning the demonic flames once more. He then flashed to the side of the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>The suction from the vortex grew stronger, nearly destabilizing Qin Sang.</p><p>He dared not delay, glancing at the jade bottle formation. Seeing it was only meant to trap the puppet, he ignored it.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang pointed, and the Nine Nether Demonic Flames surged toward the puppet.</p><p>The puppet sensed the danger but, trapped by the jade bottle formation, was unable to resist.</p><p>Unfamiliar with puppetry, Qin Sang didn't know how to subdue the puppet. With the monster below on the verge of awakening, he had no time to experiment. Instead, he enveloped both the formation and the Nascent Soul puppet in the demonic flames and shot upward through the Blood River.</p><p>As he ascended, Qin Sang remained vigilant, using a secret technique from the Witch Clan to enhance the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's vision while silently forming hand seals.</p><p>If Dongyang Bo dared to pursue, Qin Sang was prepared to abandon the puppet if necessary, but he would ensure Dongyang Bo met his end here!</p><p>However, even as Qin Sang emerged from the Blood River, there was no sign of Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced down, seeing the blood mist churning below, stirred by some unknown monster. A sense of foreboding gripped him, and he quickly left the perilous area.</p>
