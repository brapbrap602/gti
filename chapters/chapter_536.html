<h1>Chapter 529: A Leap Forward</h1><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the swirling vortex of wind and clouds, then turned and left.</p><p>He hadn't gone far when he felt a strange stirring within his body. Not daring to delay, he found a nearby secluded spot and sat down cross-legged.</p><p>Earlier, forced to borrow the power of the Ancestral Saint Fire to trap the two cultivators, he had to interrupt the crucial process of merging his罡 Qi and煞 Qi to form his Gold Core. This was a risky move, but Qin Sang had no other choice.</p><p>As expected, merely three breaths had passed since the fight began, and he could barely suppress the internal turmoil. He could sense his Gold Core nearing its limit.</p><p>Fortunately, his Gold Core retained its spiritual nature; otherwise, it wouldn't have lasted this long.</p><p>Trapped within the vortex, the two cultivators were beyond help, even if other Green Sun Demonic Sect members came to investigate. They could only watch anxiously.</p><p>Their rescue depended on the return of the Green Sun Demonic Sect's Gold Core cultivator, assuming they could even survive that long.</p><p>Qin Sang had to seize this opportunity to complete the final step!</p><p>He absorbed all the Green Sun Divine罡 fragments in his hand, then channeled his罡 Qi into his Qi Sea. His Qi Sea was currently empty, with only a small amount of Earthly煞 Qi remaining. This煞 Qi was comparable in strength to the罡 Qi, but it was enough.</p><p>Using his spiritual power as a conduit, he directed both energies towards his Gold Core!</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang exerted his last bit of spiritual power to activate the Ebony Sword. A surge of sword Qi enveloped the Gold Core.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The three forces collided, using the Gold Core as their battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang's Qi Sea trembled violently. A sweetness rose in his throat, but he suppressed the intense pain and swiftly completed the final hand seal. Then, he focused his inner vision on his Qi Sea, anxiously observing the changes in his Gold Core.</p><p>His Qi Sea was a vast emptiness, with only a single Gold Core suspended within, spinning rapidly. He watched as the last remaining area on the Gold Core was consumed by black Qi and cyan light, finally vanishing completely.</p><p>The Gold Core transformed into a strange, mottled pill of cyan and black!</p><p>Did it work?</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with uncertainty. According to the secret method for refining the Flying Night Fiend, the core formation process was now complete. This usually signified the successful creation of a Flying Night Fiend.</p><p>But Qin Sang hesitated, unsure whether he had succeeded or failed.</p><p>He didn't even know what to call the core within him.</p><p>A煞 Core? A罡煞 Core? Or should he follow the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture* and call it a Corpse Core?</p><p>He decided to call it a Corpse Core for now.</p><p>The good news was that, unlike the Flying Night Fiend, the Corpse Core didn't release a torrent of煞 Qi upon formation. With the Flying Night Fiend, this rampaging煞 Qi would surge through the meridians, tempering the body but also causing irreversible corpse transformation.</p><p>However, the Corpse Core remained quietly within Qin Sang's Qi Sea, completely inert, which he found even more unsettling!</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang tried to probe the Corpse Core with his divine sense.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment his divine sense touched the Corpse Core, it began to tremble violently.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, but he was powerless, as the Corpse Core was completely beyond his control.</p><p>He anxiously observed the Corpse Core and saw the distinct cyan and black colors begin to merge. They rapidly assimilated each other, eventually forming a uniformly cyan-black Corpse Core!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang felt a strange connection form between himself and the Corpse Core. The Core also quickly settled down.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's thoughts, a peculiar energy surged from the Corpse Core. He couldn't control it freely yet, but thankfully, this energy was gentle.</p><p>After a cultivator successfully forms their core, whether they are a demonic cultivator, evil cultivator, righteous cultivator, or follow some unorthodox path, the power within them transforms and is no longer simply spiritual power. It's collectively known as True Essence.</p><p>Qin Sang tentatively referred to the power emanating from the Corpse Core as True Essence, but he found it quite peculiar. It contained煞 Qi,罡 Qi, and even corpse Qi from the secret method, all fused together.</p><p>Wu Shang's concept of merging罡 Qi and煞 Qi had become a reality!</p><p>The originally violent Earthly煞 Qi and Heavenly罡 Qi, after restraining and merging with each other, had become strangely docile. They weren't rampaging within his body like in the Flying Night Fiend.</p><p>Carefully, he guided this True Essence into his meridians, circulating it according to the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture*.</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely nervous, fearing the True Essence would suddenly go berserk and damage his body. But after a complete cycle, the True Essence remained perfectly stable.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a great weight lift from his shoulders. He immersed his mind into the Corpse Core, savoring the sensation, completely enthralled.</p><p>He couldn't fully control the Corpse Core yet. He needed to familiarize himself with it to achieve perfect unity and wield it at will. But he could already sense the immense power contained within, far surpassing his previous cultivation level.</p><p>This wasn't a simple improvement; it was a qualitative change!</p><p>A leap forward!</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Qin Sang grinned, a surge of exhilaration coursing through him. He stood up abruptly.</p><p>This wasn't the place to familiarize himself with the Corpse Core. The Green Sun Demonic Sect's Gold Core cultivator had already been gone for two hours. With the disturbance at Divine罡 Peak, he would definitely return sooner.</p><p>With his Corpse Core newly formed, Qin Sang didn't dare to confront a true Gold Core expert. His priority was to leave the Green Sun Demonic Sect as soon as possible and find a secluded place to understand his Corpse Core.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang turned and headed down the mountain. Passing the wind and cloud vortex, he glanced at it but didn't linger, continuing his descent.</p><p>Reaching the foot of the mountain, Qin Sang detected the presence of numerous cultivators outside. They were clearly drawn by the phenomenon at Divine罡 Peak. Although Qin Sang hadn't fully mastered the Corpse Core, he could still use the True Essence to conceal his aura.</p><p>None of these cultivators were powerful, so Qin Sang wasn't worried about being discovered.</p><p>Without any trouble, he slipped away from Divine罡 Peak and headed straight for the Green Sun Demonic Sect's main gate, pondering how to escape unnoticed.</p><p>The Green Sun Demonic Sect was currently vulnerable. The few remaining experts had been lured away by the events at Divine罡 Peak. Qin Sang believed escaping wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p>But he knew he had to flee immediately after escaping, without lingering near the Green Sun Demonic Sect. As he walked, he connected his divine sense to the Corpse Core, racing against time to familiarize himself with its power and gain more control over the True Essence.</p><p>He was surprised to find that his progress was much faster than Yu Hua's. It had taken Yu Hua two full days to achieve unity with the Corpse Core and gain complete control.</p><p>Was it because he was actively familiarizing himself with the Corpse Core, unlike Yu Hua, who was separated by a layer of divine sense imprint? Or was it because the True Essence was gentler than煞 Qi and easier to control?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't understand and couldn't explain the reason, so he didn't dwell on it.</p><p>The Green Sun Demonic Sect's inner sect security was also lax at the moment. Qin Sang avoided a patrol and easily reached the outer sect. He then unleashed his movement technique, swiftly heading towards the main gate.</p><p>Crossing mountains and valleys, he finally arrived at the gate.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stopped, his expression darkening as he stared at the cloud-shrouded peaks.</p><p>The Green Sun Demonic Sect had sealed the main gate!</p><p>If the gate hadn't been sealed, he could have stealthily approached and burst through, catching them off guard. No one would have been able to stop him.</p><p>Now, he absolutely dared not force his way through.</p><p>Even a true Gold Core expert wouldn't escape unscathed from barging into a grand formation!</p>
