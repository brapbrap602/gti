<h1>Chapter 1917: Rank Seven Talismans</h1><p>The Five Thunder Envoy’s Inner Canon of Seals records that lightning talismans are divided into seven ranks.  While not explicitly stated, Qin Sang suspects this corresponds to Daoist cultivation levels.</p><p>The Yuqing Summoning Lightning Talisman, the Liu Jin Fire Bell Lightning Summoning Talisman, and the Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal Talisman, which harness the power of the High Shang Shenxiao, are ranked first, second, and third respectively, mirroring cultivation stages roughly equivalent to Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Transformation God, and Void Refinement.</p><p>Fourth-rank talismans can only be used by cultivators at the Unity stage.  Whether due to damage to the seal or deliberate erasure, the seal contains descriptions of fourth-rank talisman power but records none of the talismans themselves.  As for higher-ranked , only fragments of information exist.</p><p>Qin Sang is aware of one fourth-rank talisman, the Zi Xu Thunder Attractant, which harnesses the power of the High Shang Shenxiao’s fourth-rank spell, the Zi Xu Thunder Treasure Seal.  Unfortunately, even if he were to reach the Unity stage, he doesn't know where he would go to advance it.</p><p>Of course, even mastering the third-rank talismans in the seal would benefit Qin Sang immensely; fourth-rank talismans are currently beyond his reach.  The Rainbow Apparition Talisman the boy recently used was a second-rank talisman.</p><p>“Coincidence? Or is there really a Daoist Court inheritance here?”</p><p>Qin Sang had visited Cloud City Mountain several times and interacted with its cultivators, conducting thorough investigations without finding any trace of the Daoist Court.  Unexpectedly, he discovered something during his travels.  And it's a Thunder Department inheritance!</p><p>In the later stages of the Daoist Court, the War Department rose to prominence, while the Thunder Department declined, with the Thunder Jade Mansion becoming protectors of the Daoist Court.  The Court’s thunder techniques would likely become increasingly difficult to transmit externally. For years, there had been no news of the Daoist Court returning to Cloud City Mountain.</p><p>The presence of Daoist Court remnants here suggests this place might have been a former territory.  Could the Daoist Court's return to the Great Thousand World be close by?</p><p>Mulling this over, Qin Sang continued, "What other talismans did you learn?"</p><p>"Transporting Thunder Talisman, Executing Gang Talisman, Deep Pool Receiving Water Talisman, Great Prosperity Thunder Curse…"</p><p>The boy rattled off over a dozen talismans.  Qin Sang's expression grew serious. Half of them are recorded in the Five Thunder Academy; some, despite seeming unrelated to thunder techniques, are actually thunder talismans.  Most are first-rank, with the Great Prosperity Thunder Curse being second-rank.</p><p>Even within the same rank, talismans vary in complexity. The Great Prosperity Thunder Curse is more intricate than the Rainbow Apparition Talisman.  Given the boy's cultivation level, he couldn't have crafted the curse himself; otherwise, he wouldn't have fled.</p><p>One talisman might be a coincidence, but so many matching talismans strongly suggest a connection to the Daoist Court’s Thunder Department.</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was piqued.  His aimless journey now had a purpose: perhaps he could find a Thunder Department inheritance outside the Five Thunder Academy.</p><p>"Ji State…"</p><p>Qin Sang asked a few more questions, a rough map forming in his mind.  The boy, prostrate on the ground, trembled, his mouth opening to speak, only to be lifted by a force.</p><p>Inside the Daoist Temple:</p><p>Gao Ruoxu was interrogating the fox spirits when he sensed something and saw a streak of light shoot towards the temple gate.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>The ghosts and deities shouted.  The Wen and Wu judges rushed forward, sealing the main entrance. The Spirit Restraining Formation wasn't yet deactivated; the Yin officials retreated into the black mist, a chilling wind rising.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>Gao Ruoxu shouted, dismissing his attendants and rushing to the gate.  Seeing Qin Sang and the others, his expression tightened slightly. He bowed slightly. "Qingfeng Daoist, we meet again."  He had already seen the boy and his gaze sharpened.</p><p>"This Daoist is indeed following you all," Qin Sang said calmly, smiling. "Daoist Gao must have learned that those fox spirits were manipulated by someone else and therefore not deserving of death.  This person attempted to escape secretly, but this Daoist intercepted them and brought them to Daoist Gao."</p><p>Gao Ruoxu, unconcerned about being followed, nodded and gestured toward the boy. "Wen Judge, Wu Judge, seize this thief!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The Wen and Wu judges lunged forward, shackling the boy and sealing his cultivation. The boy, realizing escape was impossible, didn't resist; his face was filled with despair.  With so many cultivators dead at his hands, even if not executed, he would face a fate worse than death under the laws of the gods.</p><p>"Jijijijiji…"</p><p>Seeing this, the fox spirits pleaded for mercy, seemingly recounting their grievances and bowing repeatedly to Gao Ruoxu.</p><p>"Hmph! Though coerced, you don't deserve death, but sucking the life force of mortals wasn't likely this person's doing. Self-serving and harmful, your crimes are unforgivable! Take them away, investigate their crimes, and then mete out punishment!"</p><p>Gao Ruoxu waved his hand, then deeply bowed to Qin Sang. "Thank you, Daoist, for your righteous assistance in preventing the culprit's escape!"</p><p>"This Daoist merely happened upon it," Qin Sang replied, bowing. "I won't disturb Daoist Gao's interrogation.  I take my leave."  Qin Sang was about to depart.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu quickly stopped Qin Sang, “The Daoist helped us capture this major threat.  Please allow Gao to host a banquet to show our gratitude; otherwise, it would be impolite.  Furthermore, upon returning to the city, I will send a report to Fuzhou and the capital, to request merit for the Daoist!”</p><p>He naturally saw that Qin Sang captured the young man effortlessly, his strength unfathomable.</p><p>The city god wouldn’t mind befriending such a skilled person; it would be beneficial for them, without any drawbacks.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then said, “A banquet is unnecessary.  Daoist Gao, could you please write a travel pass for me? I intend to travel south and should pass through your city. I will personally visit the city god then.”</p><p>In some places, gods and spirits set up checkpoints, and cultivators need travel passes to pass through.</p><p>A travel pass, to a certain extent, also serves as a symbol of identity and origin, more formal than the city god’s warrant Gao Ruoxu gave earlier.  Qin Sang could claim to be from Beikuai County, Liuguo, allowing for better integration.</p><p>Qin Sang thought, if this place truly was an old site of the Daoist court, there must be more than one place with Lei Fa  inheritance. Asking the gods for help in gathering clues would be easier than searching alone.</p><p>“That’s no trouble at all!”</p><p>Gao Ruoxu readily agreed, instructed his subordinates to escort the prisoner, and returned to the county at top speed.</p><p>Shortly after, Gao Ruoxu personally escorted Qin Sang out of the city. Qin Sang now held a gold document imbued with divine power, inscribed with Liuguo, Tanzhou, Fuchun Prefecture, and Beikuai County, sealed with Gao Ruoxu’s city god’s seal.</p><p>Under the moonlight, the travel pass shimmered with golden light, like a magical artifact.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the travel pass and proceeded along the river at a leisurely pace, passing several counties without stopping.</p><p>The river gradually widened, eventually merging into a large river.</p><p>This river was the Fuchun River, flowing southward to Tanzhou city.</p><p>The river current was swift, with boats racing.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the Fuchun River at nightfall.</p><p>At the confluence of the river and the tributary, many river boats were moored, passenger boats coming and going.  Some large ships were adorned with lanterns, as magnificent as pleasure boats; others were simple covered boats, swaying precariously, causing one to worry about capsizing.</p><p>Qin Sang led his horse onto the dock and happened upon a pleasure boat casting off its moorings, about to depart.</p><p>The boat was brightly lit, with red silk hanging down.  The sounds of silk and bamboo, birdsong, and the chatter of women emanated from the cabin, with a faint scent of cosmetics carried by the river breeze.</p><p>Those waiting for boats on the dock kept their distance from this ship.  The reason was obvious: the fare must be very expensive.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't short of money; he led his horse forward, about to step onto the gangplank, when a steward rushed out from the boat, sizing him up.</p><p>“Daoist, what is your business?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the ship and questioned, “Does your ship not carry passengers? Or is it full?”</p><p>“We do carry passengers, and there are rooms available, but…”</p><p>The steward looked embarrassed, whispering, “This is a pleasure boat.  Do you know what a pleasure boat is for?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, “I’ve traveled the world and seen many things. I naturally know what a pleasure boat is.  Does the steward worry that I will advise the guests to forsake worldly desires and embrace monastic life?”</p><p>“Oh dear! I can’t explain it to you!”</p><p>The steward waved his hands repeatedly, “In short, this place isn’t suitable for someone like you, a person of the Dao. You wouldn’t care for these women, so please don’t make things difficult for me.”</p><p>He thought to himself: This person has a horse and a bird, and also a young girl; it doesn’t seem like he's here for pleasure, let alone that he’s a Daoist.</p><p>At that moment, someone shouted from the bow, “Cast off!”</p><p>“Quickly! Quickly!  Board the ship and raise the gangplank!”</p><p>The steward blocked Qin Sang, signaling the dockhands to board.  After the boat left the shore, he kept bowing to Qin Sang.</p><p>“I’m so sorry! I’m so sorry!”</p><p>The pleasure boat cut two white waves on the water’s surface; the sound of the water was roaring, with a faint sound of the qin  subtly mixed in.</p><p>On the third floor of the pleasure boat, in a large embroidered room…</p><p>A woman in a light green dress and light makeup was playing the qin, her eyes fixed on the river outside the window.</p><p>Her eyes were slightly swollen; she had just been crying.</p><p>The music flowed from her fingertips, filled with sorrow, but her expression remained unchanged, desolate.</p><p>A letter lay open beside the qin, with only two lines of writing.</p><p>As the pleasure boat sailed into the heart of the river, the wind picked up suddenly, and the letter was blown up.</p><p>The woman’s dull eyes moved slightly, mechanically following the letter, watching as it was blown out the window and into the river.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Someone knocked repeatedly on the door.</p><p>The old madam of the boat was anxious; several strong men stood behind her, but they did not dare to force the door open, fearing they might upset the woman inside.</p><p>Qing'er! Qing'er! Look on the bright side!”</p><p>“There are plenty of men in the world. With your looks and talent, Mama could find you any man you want. Why… why cling to that heartless wretch? Sigh!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Should I change my outfit?”</p><p>Qin Sang watched the departing pleasure boat, then looked at her Taoist robe, and chuckled wryly.</p><p>The sounds of music and shouting reached her ears.</p><p>Qin Sang had intended to board the boat with Xiao Wu to meet the woman and hear her story.</p><p>The world is full of all kinds of love.</p><p>Friendship, family love, gratitude – Xiao Wu has seen them all, even experienced them firsthand.</p><p>This quick glance wouldn't give Xiao Wu a true understanding, but at least it lets her know these things exist.</p><p>Unfortunately, they wouldn't even let her on board.</p><p>“Oh well, there are plenty of lovesick men and women in the world…”</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head and looked towards a small boat by the riverbank.</p><p>The boatman was a burly man with a full beard, sprawled carelessly at the bow, clutching a wineskin bigger than his head, taking occasional swigs, his eyes half-closed in a drunken haze.</p><p>The boat was dilapidated, the fare surely cheap, yet few dared to take it, largely due to the boatman's appearance.</p><p>The boatman, surprisingly perceptive, noticed Qin Sang’s gaze. He belched, then roared,</p><p>“Hey! Taoist, need a ride?”</p><p>“To Fucheng, chartered boat. How much silver?” Qin Sang led her horse closer.</p><p>This boat was smaller than Chen Ya'er’s; there wouldn’t be much room for the horse.</p><p>The boatman spread out his hand, fingers splayed. “Ten taels!”</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head. “Too expensive, eight taels is my limit!”</p><p>“Deal!”</p><p>The boatman didn’t even bother to stand, just shifted to one side, making room for Qin Sang to board.</p><p>As Qin Sang boarded, the people on the shore whispered amongst themselves, some casting her sympathetic glances.</p><p>Once Qin Sang was aboard, the boatman kicked hard against the dock. The small boat shot towards the river center like an arrow, the reins not even secured.</p><p>The small boat sailed into the heart of the river.</p><p>The boatman put his feet up, swinging his large feet and sipping his wine, yet the boat was both fast and steady, not slower than the pleasure boats ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding Xiao Wu, sat by the cabin, looking towards the bow. “I didn’t expect even the River God to work for a living on the river.”</p><p>The boatman chuckled. “I’m no River God, just a minor water deity of this stretch. Before the true River God, I can only bow down. Those mortals are stingy with the good wine offerings at the temple, so I have to earn my own.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; she’d heard from Gao Ruoxu that the Fuchun River stretched across multiple countries, the true River God far more powerful than even the City God.</p><p>The divine system was intricate and complex.</p><p>Powerful River Gods and Mountain Gods weren't under the City God's authority.</p><p>They accepted incense offerings, using the spiritual power to connect with the earth and water veins, aiding their cultivation, some even needing no offerings.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Ahead, a huge splash erupted beside the pleasure boat.  Screams erupted from the boat as people scrambled to the deck.</p><p>“No! Miss Qing’er jumped into the river!”</p><p>…</p><p>“What are you all looking at!  Go save her!”</p><p>The madam shrieked and jumped on the deck.</p><p>But the crowd hesitated.</p><p>Miss Qing’er was determined to die; she chose a section of the river known as the Ghost River, with its swift currents and numerous whirlpools. Even strong swimmers wouldn't survive being pulled under.</p><p>Qing’er was nowhere to be seen, likely already caught in a whirlpool.</p><p>Then, a figure surfaced beneath the river.</p><p>“There! Look!”</p><p>“She’s surfacing!”</p><p>“No whirlpool!  We can save her! Quick, quick!”</p><p>Several strong swimmers jumped in and pulled Miss Qing’er onto the boat.</p><p>“Cough! Cough!”</p><p>Qing’er was still conscious, coughed up some water, and took a breath, clutching her frail body, looking dazed, the suicidal look in her eyes significantly diminished.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed this, saying, “Fellow Daoist, you’ve saved many people over the years.  Truly worthy of the name Water God.”</p><p>The boatman swallowed some wine, nonchalantly saying, “Accidental falls, if I encounter them, I’ll save them.  Those who jump on purpose, if I save them once and they still want to die, I’ll leave them be.  What’s love, anyway… pfft!  It’s nothing!”</p><p>He then cocked his head, teasingly looking at Xiao Wu. “Little girl, don’t grow up to be like her.”</p><p>Xiao Wu said nothing.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned against the ship’s side, gazing at the faint moonlight on the horizon, silent for a long time.</p>
