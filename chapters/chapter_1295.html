<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1287: Breaking the Camp</p><p>"Now we're retreating from Twin Mirror Mountain and falling back directly to Yu City?"  </p><p>Fairy Qiuzhi frowned deeply, not expecting such an order.  </p><p>Before this, Elder Canghong had anticipated a shift in the situation.  </p><p>According to Elder Canghong's plan, if the Two Domains Alliance proved too formidable, they would consolidate their forces, with all the cultivators of the Sin Abyss retreating to the three main camps, holding their ground and waiting for the right opportunity.  </p><p>They weren't newcomers to the Celestial Plateau; they had been entrenched here for years, laying a solid foundation. By defending and waiting to counterattack, the Two Domains Alliance would have to pay a heavy price.  </p><p>Even if they were eventually forced to retreat, holding out for a single day would bring them a day's worth of benefits.  </p><p>Not to mention the various spirit mines and resources scattered across the grasslands and the Celestial Plateau.  </p><p>Now, they were close to advancing to the second tier of the Celestial Plateau. The sects on the southern slopes had already abandoned their bases and fled in disarray.  </p><p>The spiritual veins of these sects were also a valuable resource.  </p><p>Lower-level cultivators of the Sin Abyss could secure better cultivation caves.  </p><p>Some secret techniques that drained spiritual veins, which they had hesitated to use on their own sects, could now be employed without reservation on the Celestial Plateau.  </p><p>Even if they had to retreat, they shouldn't fall back this far.  </p><p>Wouldn't that be equivalent to handing over the fruits of two hundred years of warfare?  </p><p>"Even though we've lost a fellow Daoist, with this top-tier formation and our various preparations, holding Twin Mirror Mountain shouldn't be difficult! If the two of you assist me in breaking the Gale Formation, we can turn the tide!"  </p><p>Fairy Qiuzhi was unwilling to give up. Twin Mirror Mountain was practically her creation, and she didn't want to abandon it so easily.  </p><p>"What? A fellow Daoist has already fallen?"  </p><p>The two were shocked. They had just arrived at Twin Mirror Mountain and found the battle already underway. They had contacted the cultivators managing the formation and found Qin Sang, sneaking over without witnessing the moment Qin Sang slew Moon Scatterer.  </p><p>Elder Song sighed, "Elder Ye sent us here precisely because he was worried that our fellow Daoists might underestimate the enemy and fall into their trap. Especially Cold Cloud Heaven—Elder Ye seemed even more wary of him than Qin Sang. But it seems we were still a step too late."  </p><p>Upon learning that it was Moon Scatterer who had died, Elder Shan, who was aware of Moon Scatterer's vile deeds, felt his anger subside slightly. He thought Qin Sang had done a good deed and didn't press the matter further.  </p><p>"Elder Ye and Elder Canghong are stationed at the other two camps and have already begun preparing a retreat plan. If you don't make a decision soon, Fairy, you'll be surrounded on three sides by the Two Domains Alliance. There's no time to hesitate! Yu City was Elder Ye's contingency plan. He and Elder Canghong have selected several strategic points along the way suitable for the army to hold. They'll adapt as the situation unfolds, so we might not retreat that far."  </p><p>The two urged her repeatedly.  </p><p>"Fairy, don't forget that the reason Elder Ye and the others reached a consensus to launch this joint campaign wasn't to annihilate the Two Domains Alliance and dominate the North Star Realm. This outcome was actually expected. No matter how strong the Two Domains Alliance is, they can't break into the Sin Abyss. At most, it will be a continued stalemate. If we risk everything in a moment of pride, it would be a case of losing the greater for the lesser."  </p><p>Hearing this, Fairy Qiuzhi's expression shifted, and her resolve wavered.  </p><p>"But what about the resources stored in the mountain? If we retreat hastily, how will we handle them?"  </p><p>Twin Mirror Mountain was one of the Sin Abyss's resource depots, containing not only the spiritual stones and materials needed to sustain the war but also numerous treasures plundered from the Celestial Plateau. The quantity was immense.  </p><p>The storage capacity of a cultivator's spatial pouch was limited, and they could only take a small portion.  </p><p>They hadn't anticipated the Two Domains Alliance's sudden rise, with a top-tier expert emerging out of nowhere. They hadn't planned to transport the resources earlier, and now it was too late.  </p><p>"Take as much as we can, prioritizing the most precious treasures. The rest will have to be destroyed! Most of it was looted from the Two Domains Alliance anyway. Abandoning it all won't be too painful."  </p><p>Elder Shan declared resolutely.  </p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Fairy Qiuzhi finally accepted the proposal. "We'll need to discuss the specifics carefully. The situation is urgent, so I ask the two of you to help repel the enemy first."  </p><p>"Of course!"  </p><p>Elder Shan nodded readily. "I've been wanting to test his skills for a while now but never had the chance. Elder Song, follow me. If Qin doesn't show himself, we'll hunt down others. Let's see how long he can hold back!"  </p><p>The three immediately split into two groups.  </p><p>Fairy Qiuzhi returned to managing the formation.  </p><p>...  </p><p>The news of Qin Sang slaying an enemy Nascent Soul ancestor spread like a hurricane across the battlefield, greatly boosting the morale of the Two Domains Alliance.  </p><p>Meanwhile, the Sin Abyss forces were struck with fear. They had heard too many legends about Qin Sang, and now another Nascent Soul ancestor had fallen by his hand, leaving them deeply shaken.  </p><p>Some even began to regard Qin Sang as a god or demon, more terrifying than even Elder Zhenyi.  </p><p>Additionally, when Fairy Qiuzhi personally intercepted Qin Sang, she left the formation in the hands of another cultivator, whose cultivation and skills were inferior to Qing Jun's. Qing Jun seized the opportunity to launch a fierce assault.  </p><p>At this point, the situation was extremely favorable for the Two Domains Alliance.  </p><p>While Fairy Qiuzhi and the other two were deliberating, Qin Sang had already retreated to his own formation, relaying the news to Qing Jun and the others, urging them to remain vigilant.  </p><p>After confirming the identities of the reinforcements, Qing Jun didn't rush to press the advantage. Instead, she consolidated her forces, advancing steadily. When Elders Shan and Song joined the battle, they gained little ground.  </p><p>After a fierce skirmish, Qing Jun sounded the retreat, and the battle came to an abrupt end.  </p><p>After the battle, the Two Domains Alliance set up camp on the mountain, their forces poised to strike at the Twin Mirror Mountain camp. The sky lake atop Twin Mirror Mountain gradually restored its beauty, masking the bloodshed left by the battle.  </p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators approached Qin Sang to congratulate him on his latest achievement.  </p><p>Qin Sang modestly attributed it to luck.  </p><p>At this moment, they received a message from Qing Jun, summoning them to discuss the next phase of the war. Knowing Qin Sang's expertise in reconnaissance, Qing Jun ordered him to stay behind and keep watch over the Sin Abyss.  </p><p>After seeing off Jing Lin and the others, Qin Sang's figure flickered as he concealed himself in the shadows, activating his Heavenly Eye technique to observe the movements of the Sin Abyss cultivators, ensuring they wouldn't be caught off guard.  </p><p>While keeping watch, he reflected on the gains and losses from the recent battle.  </p><p>The process of slaying Moon Scatterer had gone as planned, with no surprises.  </p><p>However, his encounter with Fairy Qiuzhi had exposed his lack of cultivation. Against a Nascent Soul expert who was prepared, many of his techniques were ineffective.  </p><p>He had several treasures at his disposal, but the Seed of Fire, the sword formation, and others required time and effort to master—something he couldn't rush.  </p><p>To rapidly improve his cultivation, he would have to wait for the purification of the Corpse Flower Blood Amber.  </p><p>For now, the best option was to rely on external forces.  </p><p>He couldn't control when Bai would make a breakthrough, so focusing on the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet was the most viable choice. Although the puppet couldn't be revealed openly, it could serve as a hidden trump card.  </p><p>Over the past few days, he had frequently brought the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet to consult with his senior sister. Together, they had made some progress, with his senior sister contributing her insights into the art of puppetry.  </p><p>As Qin Sang pondered these matters, he suddenly noticed a commotion in the battle formation. Surprised, he stood up and saw Jing Lin flying toward him, his face filled with excitement.  </p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, we've just received news from Stone Song Mountain—Elder Zhenyi has achieved a great victory! The camp personally guarded by Elder Ye has been breached!"</p>
