<h1>Chapter 1925: Exorcising Demons</h1><p>Qin Sang explained the situation to Taiyi.</p><p>Taiyi had no objections, feeling reassured.  The more cautious the Master was, the more he cared.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang reviewed all the texts Taiyi had collected.</p><p>Unfortunately, they contained no record of the Thunder Altar master's dharma name or identity, only that he came from the Penglai Du Shui Si and was likely not the Master.</p><p>In the texts, Qin Sang also discovered some details Taiyi had overlooked, giving him new ideas.</p><p>He suspected these Thunder Altars might not be what he expected, their usefulness uncertain. The key was the main altar; he hoped it was still intact.</p><p>At this time, Xiao Wu and the others arrived. Taiyi settled them in the hall, treating them to mountain fruits, homemade flower wine, and dried fruits.</p><p>Taiyi, while secluded in the mountains, had honed these skills during his quiet time.  Xiao Wu and the others enjoyed the feast immensely.</p><p>In the quiet room.</p><p>Qin Sang and Taiyi sat cross-legged, facing each other.</p><p>At Qin Sang's request, Taiyi explained his understanding of the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't selected the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman or the Taiyi Thunder Gang Talisman for cultivation, so he needed to fully understand them before proceeding.</p><p>Taiyi was the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman incarnate; no one understood it better.</p><p>In a few brief words, he hit the key points.</p><p>Taiyi still regarded Qin Sang as a powerful cultivator, unable to imagine that the Master had never cultivated this talisman before. He assumed Qin Sang was using him to discern the differences between himself and an ordinary Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, ensuring perfection.</p><p>With Qin Sang's cultivation level, he quickly gained a deep understanding of the Taiyi Thunder Drill Talisman, laying the foundation for comprehending the Taiyi Thunder Gang Talisman.</p><p>After Taiyi finished, he quietly awaited Qin Sang's instructions.</p><p>The shapes of the two talismans appeared in Qin Sang's mind, repeatedly being disassembled and reassembled.</p><p>In fact, Taiyi was truly unique and could not be compared to ordinary Taiyi Thunder Drill Talismans.</p><p>Redrawing the talisman without damaging its essence, while transforming it, required more than just understanding the two talismans. The brushstrokes and the flow of energy needed careful consideration, posing a great challenge to Qin Sang.</p><p>After some time, Qin Sang stopped his deduction and said to Taiyi, "Follow me from now on."</p><p>The process required Taiyi's full cooperation. Qin Sang planned to take Taiyi with him, judging by his previous demeanor, he wouldn't refuse.</p><p>Taiyi was overjoyed but then hesitated, remembering something.</p><p>"Do you have any unfinished business?" Qin Sang saw through his thoughts.</p><p>"Reporting to Master, I have no relatives.  I should have nothing to hold me back. But I've cultivated here for many years, and I've made some friends.  I've received help from Master Su, and I've helped them fight demons when they attacked.  Shamefully, Master Su and the others regard me as a reclusive righteous cultivator.  Now demons are rampant, especially large demons in the west. I fear that after I leave, the demons will wreak havoc, and Master Su and the others will be overwhelmed.  And the mountain people..."</p><p>Taiyi's gaze passed through the cave, sweeping across the mountains, a touch of melancholy in his eyes.</p><p>Mountain people lived here.</p><p>Taiyi had awakened and cultivated here, developing a deep affection for this land and its people.</p><p>"That's no problem."</p><p>Qin Sang, having anticipated this, immediately summoned Luo Hou and Zhuque. "Have them go down the mountain with you and clear out the nearby demons. This will deter any mischief and ensure at least a hundred years of peace. As long as there's no major upheaval, the mountain gods and land gods can watch over the villagers. Go!"</p><p>With that, Qin Sang handed the earth boat to Luo Hou and waved his hand.</p><p>Luo Hou obeyed Qin Sang implicitly. Zhuque, rarely given a chance to roam free, was delighted and followed eagerly.</p><p>The three flew out of the mountains.</p><p>"Thank you, great demon generals, for your support."</p><p>Taiyi, knowing that the Master's demon generals were no ordinary beings, showed utmost respect.</p><p>Zhuque looked back, ensuring they were far from Qin Sang, then became arrogant. "Pfft! Who's a demon general! I am the ancient divine beast Zhuque! That Qin...Qingfeng Old Dao relied on me many times for his life! I'm only letting him support me because he has some potential.  You dare defy me, little one!"</p><p>Taiyi was stunned, never imagining anyone would dare disrespect the Master.  He didn't know if Zhuque's words were true or not and could only stammer.</p><p>"Hey!"</p><p>Zhuque extended a wing and patted Taiyi's shoulder carelessly.</p><p>"So you're a spirit-infused talisman, are you? I've never seen a talisman become a spirit before. Show me your true form!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird opened its beak, about to peck Taiyi's forehead.  Crimson fire flickered in its mouth, intending to force Taiyi to reveal his true form.</p><p>Taiyi was terrified.  The Vermilion Bird's aura was similar to his own, yet he felt an immense threat emanating from it.</p><p>Fortunately, Luo Hou intervened, "Tell us, how many powerful demons are nearby?  Don't keep my master waiting."</p><p>Taiyi felt a sense of relief, quickly moving to Luo Hou's other side, away from the unruly Vermilion Bird.</p><p>"My understanding of the mundane world is limited. Let's go to the Crane Control Pavilion, visit Master Su, and gather the righteous forces to destroy the demon nests in one fell swoop!"</p><p>With that, they flew north.</p><p>Upon arriving at the Crane Control Pavilion, Master Su welcomed them into the sect.  He was surprised by Taiyi's sudden visit, then listened to Taiyi's introduction.</p><p>"This is Daoist Friend Luo, a Transcendence Stage cultivator."</p><p>"What!"</p><p>Master Su, who was about to sit, abruptly stood up, utterly shocked. The Daoist's mount was a Transcendence Stage cultivator; what cultivation level was he himself?</p><p>"And me! And me!"</p><p>The Vermilion Bird hopped onto Taiyi's shoulder, eagerly awaiting its introduction, its gaze fixed on Master Su's face, anticipating his shocked expression.</p><p>Taiyi looked troubled. He knew he couldn't reveal the Vermilion Bird's identity to outsiders, so he simply said, "This is the Divine Bird."</p><p>Could it also be a Transcendence Stage cultivator?</p><p>No, Taiyi's address was even more respectful!</p><p>Master Su stared blankly at the Vermilion Bird, his mind reeling, utterly unable to comprehend.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird was satisfied, whistling triumphantly.</p><p>"Daoist Qingfeng travels the world, enjoying the mortal realm, and doesn't wish his identity to be known. Master Su, please remember this," Taiyi cautioned.</p><p>"I understand! I understand! I will keep it a secret!"</p><p>Master Su finally regained his composure, nodding repeatedly. "May I ask the reason for your visit today?"</p><p>"I will be following Daoist Qingfeng and leaving this place," Taiyi said.</p><p>"What?  Daoist Friend, you're leaving?"</p><p>Master Su was shocked again.</p><p>Demonic forces were encroaching on the Duzhi Kingdom, but Master Su had never felt anxious, precisely because Taiyi, a powerful expert, was there.</p><p>"That's right! Master Su, don't worry. I've already declared my intentions to Daoist Qingfeng. Before we leave, we will help you eliminate the demons. Daoist Qingfeng has granted permission and sent Daoist Friend Luo and the Divine Bird to assist.  Time is of the essence. Master Su, quickly contact the other Daoist friends, ascertain the location of the demon nests…"</p><p>Taiyi had previously been worried about exposing his background and was reluctant to act rashly.  Now, following Qin Sang, he no longer had such concerns.</p><p>Master Su, worthy of being the leader of a sect, had recovered from his shock and decisively said, "Please wait a moment, I will immediately send messages to all our Daoist friends, and we will work together to defeat the demons! As for the location of the demon nests, we have already sent out spies…"</p><p>Master Su was about to leave to send the messages.</p><p>He wasn't worried about defeating the demons.</p><p>In the past, the most powerful demons that caused trouble had never surpassed the Transcendence Stage. Perhaps the Transcendence Stage cultivators in the depths of the Mulu Mountains looked down on them and were unwilling to descend the mountain.</p><p>Luo Hou alone was enough to sweep away the demons!</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Luo Hou stopped him.  "We can't keep the master waiting too long. This time, only summon the top experts to kill the major demons.  You can figure out how to deal with the lesser demons yourselves."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Master Su received the order and sent messages far and wide.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they left the Crane Control Pavilion and flew west.</p><p>Along the way, Master Su briefed them on the current situation.</p><p>"The largest demon nests are mainly in three places—all national capitals!  The capitals of the Tangting and Miao kingdoms are primarily occupied by evil cultivators. They use the commoners of the surrounding kingdoms, instigating wars and mutual slaughter. There is no hatred between the warring parties; their purpose is to cause the commoners to kill each other, assisting their cultivation of evil magic. I personally infiltrated the battlefield; it was a horrific scene of corpses piled high, rivers stained with blood, platforms built of flesh, and countless human pyramids, a paradise for demons."</p><p>Master Su sighed, "The third one is the furthest away. It was originally called Zhuoguang Kingdom, but now it's called Wanling Kingdom. I think Wan Yao Kingdom would be more appropriate. Those demons seized the imperial court, put on a facade of civilization, enslaved the commoners, ate people, frequently consuming an entire city—another scene of immense suffering…"</p><p>He was speaking with righteous indignation when he suddenly remembered that the three people beside him were demons, and he froze.</p><p>Fortunately, the three demons showed no reaction.</p><p>Luo Hou inquired about the strength of both sides and mused, "There must be connections between the three demon nests. If we attack one, the other two will be alerted and flee, making it impossible to wipe them out and achieve a deterrent effect."</p><p>She was once a powerful general for the Gui Fang kingdom, skilled in military strategy. Compared to the large-scale wars between the Dao Court and Gui Fang, this was a minor skirmish, easily planned.</p><p>“Su Daoyou, Taiyi Daoyou, you each lead a force and launch surprise attacks on the capitals of the Tangting and Miao kingdoms. Do not be greedy for merit, focus on encirclement rather than killing, ensuring no one escapes!  Once I and the Vermilion Bird have dealt with the demons in Wanling, we will come to assist you…”</p><p>Arriving at the designated location, some were already there, and others gradually arrived—strong warriors and rulers from nearby kingdoms.</p><p>Luo Hou transformed into human form, publicly displaying her power, and all present readily agreed.</p><p>Speed was of the essence.  Immediately, the forces split into three, heading straight for the three demonic lairs.</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Hou stood on a mountain peak outside the capital of Wanling, the Vermilion Bird perched on her shoulder, behind them a group of human cultivators.</p><p>They looked down upon the city below.  Demonic energy soared from within, and various demonic beasts patrolled the walls.</p><p>“A rabble!”</p><p>A disdainful glint flashed in Luo Hou’s eyes.  These demon soldiers were poorly trained, their patrols haphazard, their demonic nature untamed. Compared to the Gui Fang soldiers, they were worlds apart.</p><p>The demon cultivators within the city seemed only interested in wielding power, never bothering to govern properly. The city was dilapidated, barely lit at night, and the human population nearly consumed.</p><p>Naturally, there was no trace of divine presence in such a place.</p><p>Glancing at the time, Luo Hou gave a low shout, “Attack!”</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The group plunged down from the mountaintop, a howling wind echoing through the city.</p><p>“Who dares?!”</p><p>A roar echoed from the palace, erupting in purple-gold light.</p><p>From the light, a tall, handsome man soared into the air, cradling two beautiful women.</p><p>He wore a purple-gold imperial crown and robes—the strongest demon in the city, a self-proclaimed Demon Emperor, a late-stage shapeshifter.</p><p>“Audacious! You dare attack my capital? Excellent, I'll capture you all!”</p><p>The Demon Emperor laughed wildly, smashing the heads of the women in his arms, their bodies exploding like watermelons.</p><p>Blood sprayed out like arrows, aimed at the attackers.</p><p>Simultaneously, figures of varying shapes and sizes—humanoid and beastly—took to the air from various parts of the city.</p><p>The Demon Emperor pointed ahead, bellowing, “Kill them!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Die, demons!”</p><p>The shouts of both sides filled the heavens.</p><p>Instantly, the city’s skies filled with spells and demonic energy, a dazzling display of light.</p><p>The Demon Emperor remained imposing, watching his underlings attack.  Purple mystic light rose from the palace, enveloping him.</p><p>Suddenly, the Demon Emperor frowned, a sense of foreboding washing over him.  He caught sight of a yellow light shooting from the ground, a small, pointed boat emerging, carrying a powerfully built woman.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Demon Emperor was shocked at his own lack of awareness. This woman was definitely a top expert!</p><p>Instantly deciding, the Demon Emperor abandoned his subordinates and fled into the palace, the sound of crashing waves following him.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Silver-white waves appeared in the void, massive and powerful, crashing down upon the palace’s purple light.  A striking red line—a streak of Vermilion Bird fire—cut through the water.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Water and fire clashed, filling the sky with earth-yellow, crimson, and silver, easily overwhelming the purple light.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>The palace shook violently. Luo Hou and the Vermilion Bird, riding the earth boat, shattered the purple mystic light.</p><p>The Demon Emperor was horrified at the palace’s fragility. He transformed into a purple-gold divine eagle, letting out a deafening screech, flapping his wings powerfully.</p><p>But the attack behind him was faster.</p><p>The waves coalesced into a massive silver hand, slamming down upon the divine eagle.</p><p>The purple-gold eagle plummeted as if struck by a mountain.</p><p>The Vermilion Bird seized the opportunity, transforming into a crimson light and striking the divine eagle’s head.</p><p>With Luo Hou and the Vermilion Bird working together, the Demon Emperor’s demise was only a matter of time.</p><p>At that moment, more figures fled from the palace.</p><p>Luo Hou snorted, the waves splitting into multiple streams, repeatedly striking, leaving behind a field of rubble.</p><p>But as another wave was about to crush a demonic beast, it froze.</p><p>The beast, a black demonic horse with cloud-like markings on its back, had been on the verge of death, but now seized the unexpected opportunity and fled.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Vermilion Bird turned.</p><p>Looking at the beast's back, Luo Hou hesitated, “It carries the bloodline of the Ghost Cloud Steed!”</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Happy New Year! Wishing everyone a happy and prosperous 2024 filled with joy and success!</p>
