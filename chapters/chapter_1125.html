<h1>Chapter 1117: Centenarian Friends</h1><p>“How is your Grand-Grandmaster?”</p><p>Qin Sang, concerned about Yunyouzi’s sudden retreat, asked anxiously.</p><p>“Master Uncle, rest assured. The Grand-Grandmaster wasn’t injured. It seems he’s had a breakthrough and needs to close himself off to comprehend it,”</p><p>Li Yu Fu replied.</p><p>The two flew back to their cave dwelling without stopping.</p><p>Tan Yi'en and Bai Hanqiu, who had been waiting, immediately greeted them.</p><p>Yunyouzi was already in seclusion.</p><p>While waiting, Qin Sang helped Li Yu Fu and the others solve their cultivation doubts.</p><p>Upon their first meeting, Li Yu Fu sensed that Qin Sang had only recently broken through to the mid-stage, but in just over a decade, Qin Sang had already reached the late-stage of Core Formation.</p><p>Unaware of the details, Li Yu Fu and the others greatly admired Qin Sang.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>Qin Sang was instructing Li Yu Fu in swordsmanship when he suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Qin, my old friend!”</p><p>An elderly man in a long robe emerged from the cave dwelling, pausing to look at Qin Sang.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood up abruptly.</p><p>The two exchanged glances, and simultaneously burst into laughter.</p><p>The sound shook the heavens!</p><p>After paying their respects to Yunyouzi, Li Yu Fu and the others quietly withdrew.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yunyouzi sat facing each other.</p><p>He studied his old friend.</p><p>Years had passed, but Yunyouzi still looked so old.</p><p>As Li Yu Fu had said, his cultivation had reached perfection, only one step away from Nascent Soul, surpassing even Qin Sang.</p><p>“I never imagined I’d have the chance to see you again, old friend!”</p><p>Yunyouzi exclaimed.</p><p>The cultivation world is unpredictable and fraught with danger. Every parting could be a final farewell, especially since Qin Sang had been harmed by a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>“When I left Purple Micro Palace, I didn't see you, and I knew something was wrong. Later, I hid near Mount Shao Hua, secretly investigating, and accidentally met Mu Yifeng. That's how I learned about what happened at the Black Pagoda. Although you escaped, your whereabouts remained unknown.  The Heavenly Mountains were sealed by a celestial barrier, and I was powerless to find you…”</p><p>“I luckily escaped with my life…and encountered some fortuitous opportunities. It was a blessing in disguise…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that day's events with a sigh.</p><p>Although a century had passed, they sensed that each other’s personalities hadn't changed much, both remaining true to their hearts, so there was no awkwardness between them.</p><p>“I didn't expect you to have such an experience, with numerous opportunities coming your way…to break through to the late-stage of Core Formation in just over a hundred years.”</p><p>Yunyouzi noticed Qin Sang’s cultivation, his eyes shining with wonder.</p><p>“Senior, you flatter me. From what Yu Fu said, you were already at the peak of Core Formation many years ago. I still have a long way to go,” Qin Sang humbly replied.</p><p>Yunyouzi waved his hand and said seriously, “I have to thank you, old friend, for helping me be reborn from the ashes…”</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently to the story.</p><p>After Qin Sang’s departure, Yunyouzi had plunged into the Southern Ming Li Fire, using the demonic fire to refine his soul.</p><p>Several times, Yunyouzi almost burned to ashes in the Southern Ming Li Fire, but with the Three Lights Jade Liquid and his strong will, he persevered, resolving the hidden dangers and being reborn.</p><p>Shortly after leaving Purple Micro Palace, Yunyouzi successfully formed his Core and his cultivation progressed rapidly.</p><p>“Senior, do you still have that green bronze piece?”</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to ask.</p><p>“It's on me. Do you need it, old friend?”</p><p>Yunyouzi took out the green bronze piece from his pouch, puzzled.  “It's a fragment of an ancient treasure, but its former power is gone, and it can't be reforged.”</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to ask Yunyouzi's opinion and explained, “I have an idea, I don't know if it's feasible. Since the Southern Ming Li Fire fears the green bronze piece, perhaps we can use its power to subdue the spirit fire and obtain an amazing divine ability.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Yunyouzi smiled, “I had a similar idea before, but after obtaining the green bronze piece, I found it almost impossible. If you have a good method, feel free to try it. This treasure was retrieved by you at great risk; it should rightfully belong to you.”</p><p>Without further ado, Yunyouzi handed the green bronze piece to Qin Sang and also gave him a jade slip.</p><p>It contained Yunyouzi’s insights.</p><p>“Then junior will accept your generosity.”</p><p>These insights were very helpful to Qin Sang, so he readily accepted both items.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang and Yunyouzi chatted about the major events that had occurred in the Little Cold Region over the past century.</p><p>As a Golden Core cultivator, Yunyouzi had a different perspective from Qing Jun.</p><p>“Old friend, you've taken on two disciples, do you intend to found your own sect?”</p><p>Yunyouzi changed the subject and asked.</p><p>Qin Sang explained, “They are descendants of old friends. When I first returned, I urgently needed an identity that allowed me to move freely in the cultivation world. Later, I met a senior, with whom I had some past connections.  I received their support and don't have to worry about my safety for now.  My focus is still on cultivation. Yu Fu said you also want to revive the Green Sheep Temple?”</p><p>“Not me, Yu Fu,”</p><p>Yunyouzi shook his head, “He has always been the heir of Green Sheep Temple. After you told me about Yu Fu’s talent, I had this idea, and intentionally kept him at a distance from the Taiyi Danzong.”</p><p>The younger brother also has deep roots with Qingyang Temple.  Since you wish to establish your own school of thought,  Jade Axe will follow you in your cultivation, carrying on the lineage of Qingyang Temple.”</p><p>“Reaching the Nascent Soul stage is incredibly difficult. I'm not even sure of my own chances of success; it's far too early to be talking about this.”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. He sensed something was off about the wandering cultivator’s tone; it felt like entrusting a child. “Senior, what do you mean? Are you planning a long journey?”</p><p>“My younger brother, with your five-elemental aptitude, to reach this point... I've witnessed it all with my own eyes. If you can't break through to Nascent Soul, I don't know who else could.”</p><p>The wandering cultivator seemed to have immense faith in Qin Sang.</p><p>“It's not a journey.  For years, I've been honing my cultivation while attending to external matters, resolving karmic ties – preparing for the Nascent Soul tribulation. I'd previously asked two old friends to look after Jade Axe, but since you've returned, there's no one more suitable.”</p><p>“Senior is preparing for the tribulation now?”</p><p>Qin Sang was both delighted and apprehensive.</p><p>His apprehension stemmed from the terrifying nature of the Nascent Soul tribulation. Unlike himself, who possessed the Jade Buddha and also practiced body refinement, the wandering cultivator would have to rely solely on himself to overcome the demonic tribulation.</p><p>However, given the wandering cultivator's disposition, he should be able to withstand the demonic tribulation.</p><p>“The Nascent Soul tribulation is difficult, but with Senior's cultivation and resolve, you will surely overcome any danger and pass easily.”</p><p>The wandering cultivator laughed heartily. “Thank you for your kind words, younger brother! I've made ample preparations. I still need to refine several elixirs; I estimate I'll be ready to find a place for the tribulation within three to five years. I hope you will come and protect me then.”</p><p>“Senior, rest assured, I will personally be there.”</p><p>Qin Sang understood that his mere Golden Core cultivation gave him no qualification to protect the wandering cultivator.  This was an opportunity for him to observe the tribulation, which would be immensely beneficial.</p><p>“The Three Lights Jade Liquid should help with your tribulation. Unfortunately, I've used it several times to escape danger over the years, and very little remains.”</p><p>Qin Sang brought out the jade bottle, showing the meager layer of liquid remaining, and apologized.</p><p>“I recall you had a Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid.  It still needs Three Lights Jade Liquid to fully ripen…”</p><p>The wandering cultivator hesitated.</p><p>Upon hearing that the elixir was ripe, his eyes lit up. He took the bottle without hesitation. “Thank you, younger brother.  With this divine liquid, I have a much better chance of success!”</p>
