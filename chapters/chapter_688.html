<h1>Chapter 680: The Godwood's Trial</h1><p>Everyone was enjoying themselves, and Elder Zou and the others wanted to hold a celebratory banquet, but Qin Sang politely declined.</p><p>After resting in the cave for a night, Qin Sang returned to the fire chamber the next day and had Ran Luo send over the accumulated spirit materials from the chamber of commerce. His skill in refining artifacts was clearly superior to the thin young man's; Ran Luo sent only top-tier materials, allowing Qin Sang to focus on crafting top-grade artifacts.</p><p>This arrangement was mutually beneficial: while assisting the chamber of commerce with refining, Qin Sang effortlessly obtained many rare spirit materials for practice, rapidly improving his refining skills.</p><p>While waiting for Ran Luo to deliver the materials in the fire chamber, Qin Sang summoned his ebony sword and took out a section of spirit wood from his pouch.</p><p>This was the heartwood of a Jianshan tree, a precious spirit wood comparable to cold gold, which Qin Sang had found in Du Han's pouch.</p><p>The ebony sword was only a low-grade magic weapon; according to the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, a low-grade magic weapon can only hold at most six killing talismans.</p><p>If he couldn't improve the quality of the ebony sword, it would hinder his breakthrough to the late Core Formation stage.</p><p>Upgrading the ebony sword from a low-grade to a mid-grade magic weapon would require an unknown amount of spirit materials.  Except for spirit woods of the Ten Great Godwoods caliber, other woods offered limited improvement, requiring gradual accumulation.</p><p>Qin Sang knew it was best to start as soon as possible, lest the ebony sword become a stumbling block.</p><p>However, while the ebony sword was absorbing spirit wood, it couldn't be used in combat.</p><p>After forming his Core in the Xiong Mountain region, Qin Sang planned to hunt demons deep in the Western Frontier.</p><p>He had been traveling continuously afterward, fearing accidents along the way.</p><p>Therefore, although Qin Sang had several pieces of good quality spirit wood, he hadn't had a chance to let the ebony sword absorb them.</p><p>Working for the Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce and staying on Duyan Island provided a safe environment. The Qiongyu Chamber of Commerce had accumulated a considerable number of demon corpses, meaning they would likely remain on the island for at least half a year, giving Qin Sang the opportunity to have the ebony sword absorb several pieces of spirit wood.</p><p>Under the guidance of his True Qi, the Jianshan heartwood floated before Qin Sang.</p><p>The wood was pure white, as pristine as snow.</p><p>Qin Sang moved his mind, and the ebony sword hung upside down above the Jianshan heartwood. Sword energy manifested, enveloping the heartwood.</p><p>With his current understanding of refining, Qin Sang easily grasped the characteristics of the Jianshan heartwood. The sword energy gently penetrated the heartwood, cutting away impurities.</p><p>In a short time, only the purest essence of the spirit wood remained.</p><p>A smile touched Qin Sang's lips. He lightly tapped the ebony sword, and a suction force erupted from the sword, drawing the essence of the spirit wood into the sword body without a trace being left behind.</p><p>Since the ebony sword was already a magic weapon, suppressing the spirit wood essence of the Jianshan heartwood was not difficult.</p><p>Qin Sang looked very relaxed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment the spirit wood essence was completely absorbed by the ebony sword, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>The spirit wood essence seemed to have touched something.  The originally snow-white essence, with hints of green, suddenly turned slightly bloody, spreading rapidly.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the spirit wood essence lost all its spirituality, becoming a useless lump!</p><p>The ebony sword returned to its original state!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed drastically, a feeling of foreboding washing over him.</p><p>This was clearly the defilement of the Infinite Blood Mulberry!</p><p>When the spirit wood essence came into contact with the ebony sword's essence, it was unable to resist the defilement of the Infinite Blood Mulberry due to its inferior quality, and was thus rendered useless.</p><p>This was something Qin Sang had not anticipated.</p><p>Before forming his Core, Qin Sang had attempted to have the ebony sword absorb spirit wood, and similar situations had occurred.</p><p>But at the time, he had thought it was due to his insufficient cultivation and inability to control the magic weapon's power, so he hadn't paid it much attention.  He hadn't expected this to still be happening after Core Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was extremely serious.  He connected his entire mind with the ebony sword and continued to take out spirit wood saplings, trying one after another, all without exception failing.</p><p>This seemed to be a conflict stemming from the spirit woods themselves, independent of Qin Sang's will.</p><p>Unable to withstand the defilement of the Infinite Blood Mulberry, the moment they made contact, the spirit wood essences lost their spirituality, let alone being absorbed.</p><p>When he had previously used the ebony sword to absorb the Infinite Blood Mulberry, the killing talismans on the sword had stabilized it and allowed it to resist the defilement. Now, the new spirit wood was simply no match for the Infinite Blood Mulberry.</p><p>To be integrated into the ebony sword, the spirit wood's quality had to be at least as good as the Infinite Blood Mulberry.</p><p>Whether it was due to the nature of the Infinite Blood Mulberry, or if other godwoods shared similar characteristics, Qin Sang had no way of knowing.</p><p>Could it be that I'll need to find one of the Ten Divine Trees, equivalent to the Blood Mulberry, to upgrade the Ebony Sword? Those legendary celestial trees are surely no less valuable than the Ten Divine Trees, but who knows if they even exist? They might be even rarer.</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his face grim.</p><p>Only upon reaching the Canglang Sea did he realize that even Xiaohan Region is a fertile land in the cultivation world, having only seen the emergence of the Ten Divine Trees three times in ten thousand years.</p><p>The Canglang Sea's area is countless times larger than Xiaohan Region, yet far less fertile. Where am I going to find a Divine Tree?</p><p>"Could it be that I must return to Xiaohan Region before reaching the late Core Formation stage?"</p><p>Wuya Valley in Xiaohan Region is the only place Qin Sang knows where a Ten Divine Tree might exist.</p><p>Back then, the entire Blood Mulberry was shattered, its fragments scattered throughout Wuya Valley.  The Wuji Sect Master and another searched extensively there with the help of the Abyss of Sin, so there might be some remnants left behind.</p><p>As for re-refining a natal spirit sword, Qin Sang dared not attempt it rashly.</p><p>Not to mention the extreme difficulty of re-refining a magical artifact, changing his natal spirit sword would mean abandoning the killing runes on it. Due to the nature of his cultivation technique, these runes are closely linked to his cultivation base. Qin Sang doesn't know what might happen, so he won't take the risk unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>"Fortunately, upgrading the Ebony Sword isn't an immediate concern. I still have plenty of time to find a solution before reaching the late Core Formation stage. Bottleneck, bottleneckâ€¦ so this is the bottleneck of the *Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter*!"</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly, realizing his previous assumptions were too naive.</p><p>The Ten Divine Trees are incredibly rare; a tangible bottleneck might not be easier than an intangible one.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>"Anything is possible. There might be more than one way to solve this. Perhaps I can find another path, a solution through refining techniques.  It seems my decision to pursue refining was the right one.  I need to dedicate more time to improving my skills."</p><p>He summoned the Ebony Sword into his palm.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at it for a long time without any leads, but he knew his refining skills were still rudimentary, and he wasn't discouraged.</p><p>At that moment, a knock sounded on the stone door of the refining chamber.</p><p>The Qiongyu Trading Company had delivered the materials.</p><p>Qin Sang stored the Ebony Sword in his Yuan Shen, suppressing his troubled thoughts, and began to focus on refining.</p><p>Time passed without notice in the fire chamber.</p><p>Unknowingly, half a year had passed since Qin Sang arrived on the island.</p><p>During those six months, he shuttled between his cave dwelling and the refining chamber, always busy, never venturing far from Duyan Island. One after another, top-grade magical artifacts emerged from his hands.</p>
