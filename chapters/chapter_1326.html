<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1318: Changes in the Forbidden Land</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the forbidden land, the Fire Jade Centipede began to stir. This kind of reaction had only occurred twice before. The first time was when he discovered Crimson Fire Gold in an ancient cultivator's ruins. The second time was in the Abyssal Ruins, where it was drawn to a mysterious white bronze. </p><p>Qin Sang raised his head, gazing toward the mountain peak. Whatever was attracting the Fire Jade Centipede was located deep within the mountain! What other secrets were hidden within the Void Spirit Sect's forbidden land, aside from the mountain within a mountain?</p><p>Suppressing his curiosity, Qin Sang placed a restriction on the Fire Jade Centipede to prevent Bing Han from detecting it and causing misunderstandings. While there might be rare treasures within the mountain, Qin Sang harbored no thoughts of claiming them for himself. His purpose in coming to the Void Spirit Sect was to establish a good relationship with Bing Han and seek her guidance in artifact refinement. He had no intention of stirring up trouble. No matter how rare a treasure might be, it couldn't compare to the value of the Southern Bright Flame.</p><p>After storing the Fire Jade Centipede back into his Corpse Puppet Bag, Qin Sang cleared his thoughts and took out a Demonic Banner. He activated the Fire Lotus Seed within his body and began cultivating the "Fire Seed Golden Lotus" technique to refine the demonic fire.</p><p>Not long after, the Flame Repelling Pavilion suddenly trembled. Qin Sang was jolted awake, his eyes flashing with a sharp light as he stood up and stared intently toward the mountain peak. That peculiar fluctuation had appeared again. Here, the sensation was even clearer—the entire forbidden land had shaken violently.</p><p>Qin Sang was certain that the source of the fluctuation was deep within the mountain. A look of surprise crossed his face. Based on his perception, the power of the fluctuation was incredibly strong, and its source must be even more intense. If he were inside the mountain at this moment, he would have to summon his treasures to defend himself.</p><p>"What exactly is happening inside? Could it be the treasure the Fire Jade Centipede sensed?" Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>One thing was certain: Bing Han was definitely not in seclusion right now. The fluctuation was undoubtedly related to her. Qin Sang noticed Yun Lan standing guard outside, quietly observing. Yun Lan's expression was calm, as if she was already accustomed to such fluctuations.</p><p>He began to suspect that he might be overthinking things. Shaking his head, he sat down cross-legged, put away the Demonic Banner, and summoned the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet. While subduing the puppet, Qin Sang also began to experience the soul shadow within it.</p><p>The Dao Manifestation Tree was truly extraordinary. As Qin Sang's consciousness merged with the soul shadow, he forgot about his own existence, as if he had become someone else entirely. This was a dangerous practice, as he could be devoured by the soul shadow and lose himself completely. Yet, Qin Sang showed no hesitation.</p><p>What Qin Sang gained was not the residual memories of the soul shadow, as he had imagined, but an indescribable insight into realms and the Heavenly Dao that the soul shadow had possessed in life. This insight had been preserved within the soul shadow and could be experienced by others.</p><p>Qin Sang's will was firm, and he would not be swayed by another's understanding of the Dao. However, this experience was still greatly beneficial to him, not in terms of speeding up his cultivation, but in helping him overcome bottlenecks. The Heavenly Dao was interconnected, and by assimilating the insights of others, his own path became clearer.</p><p>This process of integration was slow, but Qin Sang had plenty of time. Whenever he had a spare moment, he would summon the Talisman Puppet. Over time, his accumulation would lead to a breakthrough. By the time the Corpse Flower Blood Amber was fully purified, his cultivation would likely enter a period of rapid advancement.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang had been at the Void Spirit Sect for five days. During these five days, fluctuations occurred daily. Qin Sang had discerned a pattern: the fluctuations varied in strength, with only one being the strongest each day, while the others were faint. The forbidden land showed no reaction to the weaker fluctuations, but they couldn't escape Qin Sang's perception.</p><p>After the strongest fluctuation appeared, everything would calm down completely. Then, at the same time the next day, the fluctuation would reappear.</p><p>On the sixth day, in the Void Spirit Sect's forbidden land, a streak of light shot out from within the mountain, circled briefly, and then sped toward a palace. Qin Sang, who had been cultivating in the Flame Repelling Pavilion, immediately noticed this person's presence. His eyes flashed with surprise as he rushed out of the pavilion, ignoring Yun Lan, and flew into the air.</p><p>"Huh? Fellow Daoist Qin!" A familiar voice came from the streak of light, which suddenly halted. It was Xiang Qing.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Xiang, what's going on?" Qin Sang examined Xiang Qing, feeling a mix of surprise and suspicion.</p><p>Xiang Qing looked extremely disheveled, with scorch marks on his robe. His breathing was ragged, as if he had expended a great deal of energy.</p><p>"It's a long story," Xiang Qing shook his head. "Not long after the three regions reached a truce, I followed Fellow Daoist Bing Han back to the Void Spirit Sect. We've made several attempts, but all ended in failure. This time, I nearly suffered a backlash. I was just about to invite Fellow Daoist Qin, but it seems you've already arrived."</p><p>"I've been waiting for a while! What's happening in the mountain? Even with the two of you working together, you still failed?" Qin Sang asked, astonished.</p><p>Xiang Qing had the aura of the Ancestral Sacred Flame, indicating that he had refined a portion of it and had grown stronger than before.</p><p>Xiang Qing was taken aback. "Fellow Daoist Qin, you don't know the details? Then I'm afraid I can't say much. I made an oath to Fellow Daoist Bing Han not to reveal the Void Spirit Sect's secrets to anyone. If you want to know more, you'll have to ask Bing Han yourself. She should be coming out soon..."</p><p>"I'll explain everything to Fellow Daoist Qin myself. Fellow Daoist Xiang, go and rest. These fire toxins are no ordinary matter. Even with your Azure Sun Demonic Flame, you shouldn't let them accumulate for too long."</p><p>Before the words had fully faded, a woman in palace attire flew down from the mountain peak. It was Bing Han.</p><p>Xiang Qing cupped his hands toward Qin Sang and flew into the palace.</p><p>Bing Han's figure flickered, and she appeared before Qin Sang. Outwardly, she showed no signs of distress, but her weakened aura was impossible to hide. Like Xiang Qing, Bing Han's true essence had been severely depleted.</p><p>"I wonder if I've arrived at the right time. It seems there's an important secret related to your sect here," Qin Sang said, looking up at the mountain peak.</p><p>Bing Han smiled. "Fellow Daoist Qin, your timing is perfect! I can't hide anything from your sharp eyes. The secret within the mountain is indeed of great importance to the Void Spirit Sect, and we cannot afford any mistakes. If you wish to know more, please follow me."</p><p>With that, Bing Han gestured toward the mountain peak, preparing to fly up.</p><p>However, Qin Sang remained rooted to the spot, unmoving. "From what Fellow Daoist Xiang said, this matter is no small thing. Should I also make an oath before proceeding?"</p><p>Bing Han's expression turned serious. "If Fellow Daoist Qin doesn't mind, that would be for the best."</p><p>"In that case, what will I gain from this?" Qin Sang stared intently at Bing Han.</p><p>"What do you want?" Bing Han naturally understood that Qin Sang had come with his own agenda. Given the gravity of the situation, she didn't want to haggle and simply said, "The Void Spirit Sect will do everything in its power to meet your demands."</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated for a moment, feeling both amused and exasperated. He had originally come seeking help, but now, having stumbled upon Bing Han and Xiang Qing's plans, it seemed he was being asked to lend his strength instead. This wasn't a bad thing—it would make negotiating conditions easier later on.</p><p>Bing Han's goal wasn't an ancient secret realm, but judging from the state of the two of them, it was likely just as dangerous.</p><p>"I would like to borrow all of your sect's artifact refinement texts for study. If Fellow Daoist could personally guide me, that would be even better!" Qin Sang emphasized the word "all" deliberately.</p><p>"So Fellow Daoist Qin wishes to learn the art of artifact refinement," Bing Han said, unsurprised. Most cultivators who reached the Nascent Soul stage realized that artifacts they refined themselves were the most compatible with their own cultivation.</p><p>She let out a sigh of relief. "Fellow Daoist Qin, rest assured. Whether we succeed or not, I will grant you access to the texts. However, you will need to swear an oath not to disclose them to others. I trust you can understand this condition."</p>
