<h1>Chapter 1143: The Azure Bird</h1><p>Chapter 1143: The Azure Bird</p><p>Stunning the Yao King's Consort.</p><p>The Falcon Yao looked around, then closed its wings.  Lightning crackled silently, gathering in the air to form a silvery-white orb of thunder.  Inside the orb, countless thin strands of lightning danced constantly. The Falcon Yao muttered incantations.  It seemed to be activating some secret technique, for the thunder orb suddenly plunged downwards, pointing towards the ground.</p><p>"It's here!"</p><p>The Falcon Yao was overjoyed, boasting, "I sensed a disturbance in my bloodline's thunder power nearby. Who would have thought the treasure vault of the Qieji Yao King was hidden in his consort's chambers?"</p><p>The Falcon Yao searched carefully, but found nothing. Its spiritual sense detected no fluctuations or traces of restrictions.  Only with the orb's guidance did it locate an extremely hidden entrance.  The ground beneath a jade bed silently cracked open, revealing a staircase.</p><p>"That old demon was truly cunning, using mere mortal mechanisms!"</p><p>The Falcon Yao cursed under its breath and darted into the passage.  The passage was extremely deep, leading straight underground.  It wasn't dark; night pearls were embedded in the walls. The passage ended at a stone door.  Faint light emanated from the stone door, clearly a restriction left by the Qieji Yao King.  Time was short; a look of urgency flashed in the Falcon Yao's eyes as it hurried forward to concentrate on breaking the restriction.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>a cold voice came from behind, "Thank you for helping me find the treasure vault."</p><p>Instantly, all the Falcon Yao's feathers stood on end.</p><p>Someone had been lurking behind it without its knowledge!</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Terrified, the Falcon Yao, without thinking, unleashed a bolt of lightning as thick as an arm from its body, aimed at its back.  Then, it spun around, seeing a sight that filled it with despair.</p><p>A masked figure, with azure wings sprouting from its back, stood behind it.</p><p>Facing the Falcon Yao's attack, the masked figure didn't dodge. It simply raised a hand, its palm glowing with True Energy, gripping the lightning in its hand.  Its figure only swayed slightly.</p><p>Next, the Falcon Yao saw a flash of light â€“ a sword glow.</p><p>The next moment, a terrifying sword intent descended.  The Falcon Yao's spirit trembled. Before it could react, the surrounding space was sealed by a sword array.  Sword lights trembled in the void, their points aimed at the Falcon Yao.</p><p>Enveloped by the sword array, the Falcon Yao's eyes were filled with terror.  Though not a transformed Great Yao, the opponent was exceptionally strong.  The Falcon Yao had no doubt that any movement would result in its being pierced by a thousand swords.</p><p>"Sword Intent!  You're human?"</p><p>The Falcon Yao shrieked. It had heard that the most talented human sword cultivators could comprehend Sword Intent at the Nascent Soul stage, making them incredibly powerful.  Now it was confirmed, and it was completely helpless.</p><p>"Don't be rash, friend.  Considering you helped me find the treasure, I have no intention of harming you.  An accidental slip-up would be unfortunate."</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, sending out a beam of light to seal the Falcon Yao's cultivation.</p><p>The Falcon Yao was humiliated and angry. The opponent had repeated its words to the Yao King's consort.  Its eyes darted around; it had completely forgotten about the treasure, only thinking about how to escape this person.  The opponent claimed it wouldn't kill it, but the Falcon Yao knew that countless methods existed that were far more agonizing than death.</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the Falcon Yao's thoughts.</p><p>He suspected the Falcon Yao might be Pang Ji, but he didn't have time to ask. If it really was Pang Ji, it would certainly know the interior of the Wuyaya Valley very well. After finding out, he could search for the Wu Jian Blood Mulberry there later.</p><p>He wondered how this fellow had been doing and where its elders were.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that when Pang Ji had just hatched, it already possessed Yao Spirit Realm cultivation, beating him badly. Now, he'd easily captured it.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the restriction on the stone door. With the help of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he saw its weak points and, after some effort, finally broke the restriction and pushed the door open.</p><p>"Hah!"</p><p>Seeing the contents of the treasure vault, Qin Sang was also a little dazzled.  The most precious treasures were surely kept by the Qieji Yao King.  The vault mostly contained chests of spirit stones, all mid-grade.</p><p>In the back were rows of shelves holding various magic treasures.  Their light shimmered, though their grade wasn't necessarily high.  They were items the Qieji Yao King wouldn't use but couldn't bear to discard.  A Nascent Soul cultivator would consider them invaluable.  All these treasures were protected by restrictions placed by the Yao King.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't distracted by the wealth surrounding her.  Her eyes quickly scanned the area, finally settling on a square stone slab on a wooden rack.</p><p>It was exactly as Senior Sister Qing Jun had described!</p><p>"This is it!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart leaped with joy. She hurried to the rack and stared intently at the slab.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's target, the Thunder Hawk, its cultivation sealed, unable to move from the doorway, was astonished.  It muttered to itself, feeling extremely unlucky. It could sense that the slab was the source of the attraction.</p><p>The restrictions left by the Qieji Yao Wang on the slab were layered, clearly indicating the treasure's importance. Qin Sang examined it, found a weakness in the restrictions, and cautiously channeled her spiritual energy to attempt to break them.  She had to infuse spiritual energy to activate the Qingluan phantom within the slab.</p><p>Layer by layer, Qin Sang broke the restrictions.  Finally, the slab itself was revealed.</p><p>The mysterious slab's surface was uneven, grayish-white, and lay quietly on the rack. No Qingluan phantom appeared; it looked like an ordinary slab.</p><p>Having obtained it so easily, Qin Sang decided to take the slab and leave the Wan Snake Abyss first.  She wouldn't activate the Qingluan phantom there, to avoid any unforeseen accidents.</p><p>However, the moment her fingers touched the slab, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>A layer of azure light suddenly emanated from the slab.  This light, like a living thing, wrapped around Qin Sang's fingers and rapidly surged into her body.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang's face changed drastically.  She had no idea what the azure light was. She hadn't expected the mysterious slab to react on its own, and Qing Jun had never mentioned anything like this happening.</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>Qin Sang cried inwardly. Whether the azure light was good or bad, without knowing its nature, she couldn't let it enter her body.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, immediately pulling back her hand and frantically channeling her spiritual energy to stop the azure light's spread.</p><p>Suddenly, with a loud "boom," the slab exploded!</p><p>Stones flew everywhere.  Amidst the dust, a Qingluan phantom spread its wings and soared, an unprecedented and awe-inspiring aura surging forth.</p><p>The treasury now seemed cramped. The Qingluan phantom circled slightly, then lowered its head, looking down at Qin Sang.  They felt as if facing a true celestial demon, their hearts trembling, the hawk demon shivering in fear.</p><p>"Li!"</p><p>With a long cry, the Qingluan phantom instantly transformed into a beam of azure light and, without a word, entered Qin Sang's body.</p><p>In a daze, Qin Sang seemed to have arrived in a primeval wilderness. She saw a boundless expanse, a Qingluan flying through thunderclouds, seemingly unaffected by the terrifying lightning.</p>
