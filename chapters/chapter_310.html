<h1>CHAPTER 303: FOOLISH MEN (PART THREE)</h1><p>CHAPTER 303: FOOLISH MEN (PART THREE)</p><p>"Form the array!"</p><p>Yun Youzi dared not place all his hopes on the Spirit Bamboo Boat. The Human-Headed Bird was a mid Nascent Soul Stage demonfowl, and its speed was definitely not slower than the Spirit Bamboo Boat. Only thinking of escaping would lead them all to death!</p><p>After hurriedly getting prepared, he activated the Golden Hoop Array. However, they were shorthanded without Shangguan Lifeng and the strongest Luo Xingnan. Their strength had fallen drastically. It remained unknown if they could stop the Human-Headed Bird.</p><p>However, Luo Xingnan's situation was also very terrible.</p><p>The Human-Headed Bird's cry and the Hook Serpents' roars actually seemed to harmonise somewhat, giving the impression that these demonic beasts were communicating. The Human-Headed Bird was lodging a complaint to the Hook Serpents about the Cultivators' evil deed of stealing the spirit medicine.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, the Hook Serpents let out furious roars. Red Mist spread towards them at an astounding speed.</p><p>Luo Xingnan had never expected that the Hook Serpents would be alerted in advance. He was caught off guard and was directly blocked by a bunch of serpents. He was once again besieged by the Hook Serpents.</p><p>The Hook Serpents had killed and injured many Cultivators while besieging them earlier and suffered heavy losses themselves. Not many were still combat ready. The scene was not as terrifying as before. However, the two mid Nascent Soul Stage Hook Serpent Kings' injuries were not severe and they still had formidable fighting power. The situation was still extremely dangerous.</p><p>The Cultivators were split into two groups and could only fight their own battles.</p><p>However, Qin Sang and his group were still in the most dangerous position.</p><p>The moment they activated the Golden Hoop Array, their vision went black. The Human-Headed Bird had pounced towards them. The terrain was spacious, and the Human-Headed Bird's speed and strength were on full display.</p><p>It was faster than the Spirit Bamboo Boat.</p><p>Fortunately, Yun Youzi had been farsighted. Otherwise, they would have been overtaken by the Human-Headed Bird. Crammed onto the Spirit Bamboo Boat, they would not have had the time to activate the array and would have been killed by the demonfowl one by one!</p><p>"Bam!"</p><p>The copper hoops rattled and golden light illuminated everything. Countless copper hoop phantoms overlapped, collapsing at the sound of the Human-Headed Bird's sharp claws. The attack had been difficult to block.</p><p>However, because the array's power had fallen drastically, it was far less easy to deal with the Human-Headed Bird's attacks.</p><p>The four of them felt as though they had been struck by a heavy fist simultaneously. Their bodies shook, their complexions turned pale, and Spirit Qi flowed away like water, being swallowed by the Golden Hoop Array. In an instant, more than half of the Spirit Qi in their Dantian was consumed, barely sustaining the Golden Hoop Array.</p><p>However, the Human-Headed Bird attacked again before they had time to recover.</p><p>They were all shocked and hurriedly took out Spirit Stones and pills, trying their best to recover their Spirit Qi.</p><p>They all understood that if the array was broken, they would not be a match for the Human-Headed Bird.</p><p>The Human-Headed Bird seemed to have remembered being trapped earlier, and used its speed advantage to circle around them. It attacked and then left. However, each of its sneak attacks was a thunderous strike.</p><p>Yun Youzi was the main array activator, and the pressure on him was even greater. He did not have the opportunity to activate the Spirit Bamboo Boat at all.</p><p>The Golden Hoop Array was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>They were not far from the exit. However, based on the current situation, they would not be able to escape there. The Golden Hoop Array would be torn apart by the Human-Headed Bird.</p><p>In this situation, the best method was to put aside the grudges with Luo Xingnan and cooperate again!</p><p>However, one group was being firmly suppressed by the Human-Headed Bird, and the other group was besieged by Hook Serpents. It was not easy to link up, and they had to break out.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He had the Ten Yama Banner and the Ruyi Amulet Talisman available to him. Compared to them, the Ten Yama Array was more powerful.</p><p>If not for Yun Youzi being present, the others would not have known his true identity. They only regarded him as a casual cultivator, so it did not matter if he exposed himself. However, these two treasures had different emphases in their abilities. In this situation, the Ruyi Amulet Talisman was more suitable than the Ten Yama Array.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after Qin Sang and Yun Youzi and co. had a discussion and decided for them to buy him time, as he was just getting ready to activate the Ruyi Amulet Talisman, Ge Yuan suddenly made an unexpected move.</p><p>The Human-Headed Bird pounced towards them again.</p><p>They hurriedly gathered the Spirit Qi that they had just barely recovered and activated the Golden Hoop Array with all their might to block the attack. At this time, Ge Yuan suddenly threw the copper hoop in his hand and silently left the array.</p><p>He had obviously planned it long ago. The moment he got free, he transformed into an escape light and headed straight for the exit without looking back.</p><p>Using others to guard against the enemy!</p><p>They were all furious. No one had expected that Ge Yuan would do something like this, especially at such a critical moment.</p><p>Yun Youzi even cursed him.</p><p>"Fool!"</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The hurricane caused by the giant bird-like Garuda's wings was pressing down on them. No matter how furious they were, they couldn't do anything about it. Yunyouzi hastily changed the formation in a rush.</p><p>Only three people were left to maintain the formation. Its power had been greatly reduced. The Golden Ring Formation couldn't hold on for long before the Garuda tore a hole in it. Its sharp claws reached in and grabbed at their skulls.</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked and angry, but his movements were not slow. He had the Ruyi Symbol magic treasure ready. At this point, there was no other choice but to use the magic treasure to resolve the immediate crisis.</p><p>'Swish, swish...'</p><p>The magic treasure appeared, and thousands of jade Ruyi symbols bolted out.</p><p>The distance between them and the Garuda was only a few meters. Although it sensed danger, it couldn't dodge in time. The power of the magic treasure was not wasted at all. It all struck the Garuda.</p><p>Black feathers flew everywhere.</p><p>Although the Garuda's feathers were hard and its defense was strong, it still couldn't avoid getting hurt from being hit by the magic treasure from such a close distance. A hole was torn open in its chest. Blood and feather fragments splattered everywhere, giving off a terribly腥臭 smell.</p><p>The Garuda was in pain and flapped its wings in a hurry to escape back to the sky.</p><p>However, even though it seemed severely injured, the injury was far from fatal.</p><p>The Garuda let out a wild roar, and its ferocity was even worse than before.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly heard a scream ahead. It was Ge Yuan.</p><p>Qin Sang looked sideways and saw Ge Yuan almost approaching the abyss. He was about to cross the edge of the red fog.</p><p>A white light broke through the red fog without warning and shot out from inside. There seemed to be a vortex in the white light, creating a huge suction force that directly captured Ge Yuan.</p><p>The white light came from a compass-like magic weapon in Luo Xingnan's hand.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's condition seemed to be no better than theirs. His hair was disheveled, and his breathing was unusually chaotic.</p><p>At this point, a grim smile appeared on Luo Xingnan's face.</p><p>Ge Yuan was happy that he was about to escape, but he didn't expect Luo Xingnan to sneak an attack on him at all. He didn't have time to react and was directly sucked by the white light to approach Luo Xingnan.</p><p>Then, Luo Xingnan's figure flashed and appeared on Ge Yuan's left.</p><p>At the same time, the white light suddenly changed into black light, and the suction force also became a powerful repulsive force.</p><p>Ge Yuan was struggling with all his might to get out, but his figure was like a meteor that was sent flying. Under Luo Xingnan's manipulation, it accurately crashed into the snake mouth of the Hook Snake King.</p><p>Ge Yuan was shocked.</p><p>Yunyouzi and the White-robed Scholar seemed to have expected this. Their expressions didn't show much surprise.</p><p>Yunyouzi coldly repeated.</p><p>"Fool!"</p>
