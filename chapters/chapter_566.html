Chapter 559: Secrets of the Eight Sects


Dongyang Bo, Chongyi Daozhang, and Tieguanzi flew away from the Jade Ruyi, heading towards Chifa Laozuren and the others.  The Jade Ruyi, carrying the rest, flew into the cloud-shrouded mountain peak, deposited everyone, shrunk back to its original size, and disappeared, retrieved by Chongyi Daozhang.

Simple stone platforms, of varying sizes, had been carved into the mountainside. Most were already occupied.  Everyone chose a platform and waited. Qin Sang, seeing Yunyouzi nearby, jumped onto his platform and quietly inquired about the identities of the three individuals who had accompanied Chifa Laozuren.

Unsurprisingly, these three were all Nascent Soul masters from the Eight Righteous Sects.  The only woman among them, dressed in palace attire, was the Grandmaster of the Xuling Sect, Bing Han. She was reputed to possess not only high cultivation but also exceptional skill in refining artifacts in Xiaohan.

Although Chongyi Daozhang was the only Nascent Soul master of the Taiyi Danzong, his alchemy was inferior to some elders within the sect who dedicated themselves to it. Bing Han, however, was a true master of her craft, a woman whose abilities were in no way inferior to her male counterparts.

The other, appearing remarkably young, with handsome features and an elegant demeanor like a noble son, was Leng Yuntian, the current Sect Master of the Yuanshen Sect.

“So that’s what Leng Yuntian looks like,”

Qin Sang thought, glancing towards Jing Po.

Jing Po occupied a platform by herself, sitting with eyes closed, seemingly oblivious to her surroundings.  Knowing he would be cooperating with Jing Po against Leng Yuntian at the Ziwei Palace, Qin Sang didn't want her to fail; a setback for her would surely affect him. He wanted to learn more about Leng Yuntian, but Yunyouzi knew little about him, only knowing more about Leng Qian, Leng Yuntian's predecessor at the Yuanshen Sect.

It was said that Leng Yuntian was Leng Qian’s adopted son and disciple.  Leng Qian had been a formidable figure in his time, his cultivation comparable to Chifa Laozuren's, but his sudden death over a hundred years ago had caused quite a stir in the Xiaohan cultivation world.

Fortunately, Leng Yuntian proved capable, ensuring the Yuanshen Sect’s continued position among the Eight Righteous Sects.  Years ago, the Yuanshen Sect's Grand Elder, Zhangxing Laoren, and a fellow cultivator, Yu Shan Ting, had died on Zhitain Peak.

Afterwards, preoccupied with his own Golden Core advancement, Qin Sang only followed the Yuanshen Sect's activities sporadically. There were no widespread rumors of Leng Yuntian seeking revenge for his Grand Elder.

Such a significant loss would undoubtedly enrage Leng Yuntian. However, given his prior designs on Zhitain Peak, he likely wouldn't openly declare his intentions, resorting to covert investigations instead.

The last one, a middle-aged man in black attire, with a stern countenance and impressive bearing, was the Sect Master of the Wuji Sect.

Seeing the Wuji Sect Master again reminded Qin Sang of their encounter in Wuyagu, when he was accompanied by a mysterious Nascent Soul cultivator wielding a Xuan Gui Jia (玄龟甲 - mystical turtle shell).

They had entered Wuyagu secretly, their purposes unknown, only to encounter a Tunlei Falcon, engaging in a fierce battle that ended inconclusively.

“Senior, have you heard of any Nascent Soul cultivator whose treasure is a Xuan Gui Jia (玄龟甲)?”

Qin Sang transmitted his question.

Yunyouzi obviously remembered the incident.  Though he hadn't witnessed the battle against the Tunlei Falcon, recalling the sword techniques used to slay the Xingdu Frog, he looked at Qin Sang with surprise.

“You suspect…”

Qin Sang nodded slightly.

Yunyouzi pondered for a moment and shook his head.  “It certainly wasn’t any of our righteous sect’s Grandmasters!  There are some very secretive Nascent Soul cultivators among the independent cultivators of Yinshan Pass and the Demon cultivators. It was likely one of them.  Nascent Soul masters aren't bound by the so-called righteous-demon divide, friendships between them are not uncommon, I even have a few friends among the demon cultivators.”

Qin Sang was merely curious. Seeing that Yunyouzi didn't have any leads, he dropped the matter.  Then it struck him: including Tieguanzi, the Grandmaster of Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, only seven Nascent Soul Grandmasters of the Eight Righteous Sects had appeared, the Yu Ling Sect Master was missing.

When Qin Sang asked, Yunyouzi replied meaningfully: “During my trip to Tianyao Hill, I observed some peculiar signs suggesting a curious relationship between the Yu Ling Sect and Tianyao Hill.  This sect has never fallen from its position as a top-tier righteous sect since its establishment. What secrets are hidden here? Perhaps only Nascent Soul cultivators are aware.”

…

The red clouds kept the spiritual tide at bay.

After a brief conversation with Yunyouzi, Qin Sang returned to his platform to wait.  Bored, he silently sorted through the treasures in his iron ring. Under the watchful eyes of his sect's Grandmaster, he planned to use his Hanjin Sword and two talisman treasures from the late Jiupao Daoist's belongings for show; for a cultivator at the fake Golden Core stage, this was hardly meager.


His trump cards, the Sky Thunder and the Ebony Sword, were the least worrisome to reveal.  After all, his cultivation had improved, and acquiring such treasures through fortunate circumstances was believable.  Even Dongyang Bo, a powerful Yuan Ying cultivator, wouldn't find them particularly noteworthy.

As for his other possessions, it was best to keep them hidden.

The Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman was connected to the disappearance of Xuan Yu Daozhang from the Shangyuan Quiet Palace.

The Ten Directions Yama Banner was a matter of great consequence.

The Flying Night Rakshasa and the Corpse Pill were both related to the necromantic secret technique, the *Tian Yin Corpse Scripture*.  Since Dongyang Bo had condoned Chen Yan's use of the yin-yang coupling method to form her golden core, he was clearly not someone who abhorred evil.  Qin Sang decided discretion was the better part of valor.


Qin Sang silently reviewed his upcoming trip to the Ziwei Palace, realizing the sheer number of crucial tasks ahead, each demanding flawless execution. The weight of responsibility pressed heavily upon him.


He waited there for several hours, yet the Yuan Ying Grandmaster still hadn't announced their departure.

Just as impatience began to set in among the assembled cultivators,

a powerful aura suddenly appeared from the west.  Sensing it, everyone rose and looked towards the source, witnessing a swirling mass of multicolored mist hurtling towards them at incredible speed.

Demonic energy surged from the mist!

“Cultivators from Tianyao Hill are here!” someone shouted.

The mist billowed, obscuring the number of demon cultivators within, though shadowy, non-human forms of immense size could be vaguely discerned.  It seemed that not only were transformed demons present, but also a considerable number of demonic beasts at the Core Formation stage.


Large demons were rarely seen in Xiaohan Domain.

Most of the cultivators present found the sight remarkable, their first time witnessing such a large-scale deployment of demon cultivators.  Clearly empowered by the Emperor's Dew, they couldn't be treated as ordinary beasts. Their intelligence and abilities were comparable to human cultivators.


As discussions filled the air,  everyone simultaneously heard the Red-haired Ancestor's voice: "Tianyao Hill's friends have arrived. We depart now."

Immediately, a red cloud descended.

Everyone felt a tightening sensation, only realizing they were enveloped within the cloud after regaining their senses.

Several figures, the Red-haired Ancestor and his companions, had materialized at the edge of the red cloud.

Simultaneously, the multicolored demonic mist, black demonic energy, and golden palace converged on the red cloud.  The red cloud was the largest, followed by the demonic energy, while the golden palace remained the least prominent.

These diversely colored elements, pressed closely together, formed a four-colored cloud formation that shot towards the inner reaches of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.
