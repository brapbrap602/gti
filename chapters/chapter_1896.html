<h1>Chapter 1887:  The Ritual</h1><p>This spell is called 'Transformation'.</p><p>The caster connects their divine court through ritual practices, visualizing the celestial deities and their titles from the celestial scriptures. They meditate on transforming themselves into the deity, coordinating with the corresponding scriptures, incantations, and talismans to receive a response from the deity and its power.</p><p>The power of the deity can enhance both troops and the caster themselves.</p><p>This spell has limitations.  Receiving a response from a deity requires high levels of cultivation, moral character, and mastery of the spell.</p><p>It's not always better to summon higher-ranking deities. The higher the rank and number of deities, the greater the demand on the caster.</p><p>Most Daoist cultivators can only summon deities whose rank is similar to their own, or slightly higher, within the divine court corresponding to their practice.  Summoning their own protective deity is the easiest.</p><p>Summoning higher-ranking deities grants greater power, but the ritual becomes more complex.  An altar is essential, requiring meticulous talisman creation, along with precise incantations and ritual steps.  Summoning a deity of a higher rank might involve creating dozens or even hundreds of talismans.</p><p>Several Daoist cultivators performing the ritual together can also summon higher-ranking deities, but this requires extremely strict and elaborate Daoist ceremonies, known as grand rituals.</p><p>Most importantly, the deity must exist in order to respond.</p><p>While not every Daoist cultivator following Zhenren Ruokuang's spell succeeded, it was enough to uplift spirits!</p><p>Outside the city, demonic energy surged.</p><p>The city's protective array was activated, the void-trapping barrier covering hundreds of miles outside the city.  The demonic clouds pressing into the array's range were visibly suppressed.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Countless flying creatures and airborne beasts from the monstrous horde crashed to the ground.</p><p>The beast tide surged forward.</p><p>Countless beasts were crushed and trampled by their own kind, turning into a bloody paste.</p><p>The bloodshed further enraged the horde.</p><p>Even before the battle began, countless beasts died, but in the endless tide, these losses were negligible.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators, after undergoing the 'Transformation', felt the surge of power within them.  Overjoyed, as the beast tide drew closer, they couldn't contain themselves and unleashed their divine talismans towards the city's edge.</p><p>Most were cultivators practicing plague-related spells.</p><p>Streams of light exploded outside the city, unleashing vibrant, multicolored poisonous smoke.  The smoke coalesced, forming a vast poisonous fog.</p><p>A multicolored miasma instantly appeared outside the city.  Beasts entering it died immediately.</p><p>Some fell silently, others rotted completely, their flesh turning into poison, further corroding other beasts.</p><p>With this first strike, the Daoist cultivators noticed a difference.  The speed and power of their talismans far exceeded their usual capabilities.</p><p>Even some talismans that previously felt difficult or beyond their cultivation limit could now be used.</p><p>They also noticed increased energy consumption.  They might only be able to cast eight or fewer talismans now, instead of the ten they were used to. The deity's power couldn't be sustained indefinitely.</p><p>However, these were minor drawbacks, insignificant compared to the elation of receiving a response from the divine court.</p><p>Cheers erupted around them.</p><p>Within the city, countless altars rose into the air, and the sound of chanting filled the air, as cultivators desperately summoned the highest-ranking deities within their capabilities.</p><p>The city's brilliant divine light under the night sky stood in stark contrast to the ominous demonic clouds.</p><p>Those who didn't receive a response weren't discouraged.</p><p>As long as they survived this crisis, they would one day restore the divine court to its former glory!</p><p>“Protect our Dao!”</p><p>“Protect our Dao!”</p><p>…</p><p>The shouts rose again, wave after wave, less mournful than before, now with more passion.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Altar gates swung open one after another, as Daoist cultivators led their troops to the front lines.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>The earth and mountains trembled.</p><p>Demonic clouds blotted out the sun, and the beast tide stretched as far as the eye could see.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The beasts reached the city walls.</p><p>At the same time, frost, fire, and earth turned to lava and mire fell from the sky outside the city.</p><p>Each snowflake, each flame possessed terrifying power, relentlessly harvesting the lives of the beasts.</p><p>The city's protective array activated!</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>A furious roar erupted from the city walls.</p><p>Under the protection of the array, the Daoist cultivators launched a counter-attack.</p><p>The cultivators of the Dragon Tiger Altar, empowered by divine grace, were incredibly powerful, leading their troops into the fray.</p><p>Hidden within the formations were altars, with Daoist masters acting as the central axis, controlling the battle array.</p><p>Viewed from above, the entire Daoist army appeared as a colossal formation comprised of altars, troops, and cultivators.</p><p>On the city walls, numerous floating altars appeared, countless in number, rising tier upon tier towards the heavens.  Many cultivators, skilled in manipulating golden seals, stood upon them – experienced masters among them. Some coordinated their attacks to slay enemies, others deployed various divine talismans to aid their comrades.</p><p>Compared to the monstrous tide, the Daoist forces seemed numerically inferior, yet their actions were well-organized and measured.  They divided their troops into several groups, surging into the beast horde like relentless rivers, each contingent supporting the others in a devastating, back-and-forth assault.  Wherever their blades fell, blood flowed like a river!</p><p>Then, from within the celestial city, the gentle incantation of Ruquan Zhenren echoed.  Though soft, her voice reached every cultivator and soldier with perfect clarity:</p><p>“Jade streams flow, divine light descends,</p><p>Ride the wind, appear from the nine heavens.</p><p>Nine earthly peoples, fortune and life shall thrive.</p><p>Long life, eternal, never to grieve.</p><p>Swiftly, swiftly, as the law commands!”</p><p>Her voice was like a spring rain, soothing the souls of those who heard it.  Many of the demon soldiers and cultivators, consumed by the fervor of battle and near oblivion, regained a measure of clarity.</p><p>Above the celestial city, among the arrayed altars, one altar rose high into the air, others surrounding it in a protective formation.  Ruquan Zhenren stood at the center, bathed in divine light. Her expression was gentle, like a celestial mother descending to witness the suffering of the world, her jade hand gently raised, her Celestial Physician’s staff radiating brilliant light.</p><p>The light transformed into a divine talisman, solidifying in the void – a gigantic talisman that seemed capable of piercing the entire city.  Its inscribed characters blazed with light, the talisman waving like a banner before shattering with a resounding boom.</p><p>Myriad points of light streamed outward, descending upon the battling demon soldiers and cultivators. The demon soldiers felt the effect most strongly; they seemed infused with boundless vitality, their blood surging with unprecedented power.  Wounds began to mend, pain receding as flesh and muscle regenerated instantly.  Even critical injuries were significantly alleviated.  Further, the talismanic power lingered even after healing their wounds.</p><p>Exhausted by the spell, Ruquan Zhenren’s face turned pale.  Many of the cultivators assisting her on the surrounding altars swayed, barely able to maintain their footing without divine support.  She took a deep breath, retrieved a jade vial, drank its contents, and sat cross-legged on the altar.  The other cultivators also consumed restorative elixirs.</p><p>The divine talisman had been incredibly draining, but the effect was immediate and dramatic.  In an instant, the Daoist forces’ morale soared. Their battle cries thundered, and they pushed the beast tide back a hundred miles in a single, unstoppable wave.</p><p>This wasn’t limited to just one celestial city.  Similar scenes unfolded across all the celestial cities; some holding their ground, others charging into the horde.  Before long, the celestial cities along the northern and southern borders were surrounded.  Gushan Prefecture and Guifang Kingdom were not spared; both prefectures and their mountains had become isolated islands.  A sea of demonic clouds covered the north, while a raging storm ravaged the south.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Suddenly, a Daoist celestial city erupted in a golden light that shot into the heavens, visible for hundreds of miles.  It was a signal; other celestial cities followed suit, their golden lights echoing each other, illuminating the land.</p><p>Jizhen Jingxian City.</p><p>Ruquan Zhenren, feeling this resonance, gazed into the distance.  Across the northern border, a golden serpent stretched east to west, forming a continuous golden wall protecting the Daoist heartland.  For a moment, the Daoist situation greatly improved, with the beast tide stalled at the border.</p><p>However, the situation in Gushan Prefecture and Guifang Kingdom remained grim.  Gushan Prefecture fared slightly better.  On the human side, cultivators from the left and right Thunder prefectures mobilized the northern cultivators, using Xingdao Lake as a bulwark against the beast tide.  In the south, already sparsely populated, Yintian Palace cultivators and the Huangquan Daoist army formed defensive formations.</p><p>On the demon side, the various demon kingdoms united against their common enemy.  The cultivators and demon cultivators of Gushan Prefecture were merely caught in the crossfire, many looking lost and numbly fighting, unable to control their fate, only able to wait for the outcome of the battle between Guifang Kingdom and the Daoist Court.</p><p>As for Guifang Kingdom, it was ravaged.  The demon saint, in a desperate gamble, had dispatched its elite forces to protect the Demonic War Drum at Huangquan Dao and the Great Saint’s Mansion, weakening the outer defenses.  The Demonic War Drum was unable to control such a massive beast horde, only managing to guide the True Monarch-level monsters.  The horde swept into Gushan Prefecture, destroying cities and slaughtering countless beings, leaving a scene of unimaginable devastation.</p><p>The Dugong Seal could draw upon the power of the Divine Court to repel the ominous aura of the Six Heavens, but it could not independently expand outward.  The purpose of constructing Jing Altars, Du Altars, and branch altars was precisely this.  Only places where altars existed could receive the protection of the Dugong Seal and be incorporated into the prefecture.</p><p>The city crumbled, the altar destroyed.  The miasma of the Six Days immediately surged in, transforming the land, like Hegu Mountain's lost territory, back into a breeding ground of evil.  Even if the beast tide is driven back, rebuilding will be no easy task.</p><p>This is no longer a stalemate; the Great Sage of the Yao is fighting a desperate, all-out battle!</p><p>Great Sage's Mansion.</p><p>The drums thundered.</p><p>The Yao Kings, heartbroken by the destruction of their lands, understood their dire situation.  If the Daoist sect controlled the Divine Court, they could easily sever the connection between the Yao and the Divine Court.  Then, the Yao would have no choice but to submit, losing their freedom and becoming mere demonic soldiers under the Daoist cultivators' command, forever bound to servitude.</p><p>Generations would be trapped!</p><p>Compared to the Daoist sect, the Gui Fang Kingdom faced true life-or-death circumstances!</p><p>One Yao King transformed, revealing a great ape-like demon, its body covered in grey fur, a vertical pupil on its forehead.  Standing before the war drum, its three eyes widened, its arms wielding the mallets, pounding the drum relentlessly.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>…</p><p>One blow after another.  Each strike was incredibly draining. Even a Yao King struggled.</p><p>The grey ape's arms trembled, its vertical pupil filled with bloodshot veins, but it persevered, until, exhausted, it struck the final blow, its fur splitting, blood spraying from its mouth as it collapsed!</p><p>Another Yao King immediately took its place, no comfort or healing offered, seizing the mallets and continuing the drumming. The grey ape was caught by other cultivators and treated on the spot.</p><p>The drumbeats echoed to the heavens.</p><p>The giant Lingli beast licked its wounds, its eyes gleaming with ferocity, repeatedly trying to attack the sword shadow.</p><p>Heart-wrenching roars erupted from within the beast tide, each one more desperate than the last.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators knew their advantage was temporary.  The monstrous creatures' savagery would eventually overcome their reason, triggering a devastating assault.  Then, they would face not just the beast tide, but terrifying adversaries on par with True Immortals!</p><p>Zhongmao Zhi, Zhi Altar.</p><p>Two Grand Masters stationed at the Zhi Altar successfully erected the altar, seated in mid-air, speaking in unison.</p><p>“We summon the Shangqing Tianshu Yuan Seal!”</p><p>As their words faded, a beam of light shot from the Yuan, landing between the two Grand Masters—the seal Zhang Zhenjun had wielded.</p><p>It was jade, an inch and eight-tenths wide, an inch and nine-tenths long, with six characters arranged in two lines of overlapping seal script.  However, several areas showed color discrepancies, as if it had been repaired.</p><p>The two Grand Masters raised their arms, their palms facing each other across the void, the Shangqing Tianshu Yuan Seal suspended between them.</p><p>“By the True Immortal’s order, we command all altar masters…”</p><p>The two Grand Masters chanted in unison.</p><p>Far away, at Jingquan Temple, the Abbot, seated before the Zong Altar, opened their eyes, their gaze sharp, rising abruptly.</p><p>"Disciple obeys!"</p><p>The Abbot bowed to the Zong Altar, taking the Tianyi staff, gently tapping the ground.  With a swift movement, they pirouetted, their robes flowing like dancing butterflies.  Their use of the Bu Gang technique resembled a celestial dance, yet possessed a majestic and sacred air, inspiring awe and respect.</p><p>The disciples remaining at Jingquan Temple produced their Tianyi staffs, forming an array behind the Abbot, following the Abbot's steps, echoing the celestial rhythm.</p><p>Simultaneously, throughout the Daoist sect—at the Jing Altar, Du Altar, Zong Altar…</p><p>Daoist cultivators performed rituals before their altars, most wielding swords as if in a sword dance.  All performed the same Bu Gang technique, in perfect unison, chanting the same incantation.</p><p>The altars glowed, responding to the Zhi Altar.  This was the Daoist ritual, overseen by the two Grand Masters at the Zhi Altar. This grand ceremony, involving every altar in Zhongmao Zhi, aimed to summon a celestial god.  The scale of this ritual indicated no ordinary deity would be called upon!</p><p>As one Bu Gang technique concluded, the Zhi Altar issued the command to perform another, yet the purpose remained unspoken.</p><p>‘Hiss!’</p><p>The Lingli beast's ferocity consumed it entirely; it let out a roar and transformed into a grey lightning bolt, engulfing the sword shadow.</p><p>Instantly, a sword beam burst from the grey lightning, its aftermath easily cleaving several nearby peaks in two, the debris crashing into the beast tide.</p><p>The Lingli beast was sent flying back, a deep wound appearing on its shoulder.  But the strike had failed to kill it!</p><p>The Lingli beast shrieked in agony.</p><p>Seeing this, the other monstrous creatures finally lost their patience. A colossal wing blotted out the sun; it was the great beast that had fought alongside the Lingli beast.  Elsewhere, terrifying celestial phenomena and auras erupted.</p><p>Zhongmao Zhi, Zhi Altar.</p><p>The two Grand Masters opened their eyes.</p><p>Tian Yue Shangren had bought them precious time, finally locating a surviving True Immortal-level celestial god!</p><p></p>
