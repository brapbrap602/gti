<h1>Chapter 2267:  The Stone Pavilion Again</h1><p>“Senior, if we miss this chance, will the treasure never appear again?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, full of worry.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird declared.</p><p>“A little later… might not be… a bad thing. Perhaps… it’s our… opportunity!”</p><p>Qin Sang understood the mysterious Azure Bird’s meaning. The later the treasure appeared, the more time he had to cultivate, and the stronger he would become.  Then, not only could he better harness the Azure Bird’s even greater power, but he could also participate in the treasure’s acquisition on his own merit.</p><p>Their only deficiency was time.  Their last preparation was too hasty. The treasure’s delayed appearance gave them a chance.</p><p>As for why Qin Sang slept for eighty years before awakening, the mysterious Azure Bird speculated it was due to the influence of the treasure. Its emergence was forcibly interrupted, shaking Heaven and Earth.  Since they were closest to the treasure at the time, they bore the brunt of the impact, experiencing the deepest effects. Any strange occurrence was possible.</p><p>“But,” Qin Sang hesitated, “I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.  Since waking, the illusions are even more severe.  And I worry that this long sleep is related to my inner demons! Because in my perception, not much time has passed since Senior sent me there.  Moreover, my cultivation hasn't improved at all in these eighty years.”</p><p>“Illusions… is it that stone pavilion again?”</p><p>Hearing this, the mysterious Azure Bird grew concerned.</p><p>“Yes, that stone pavilion! It’s becoming increasingly real.  If this continues, the impact on my cultivation is secondary.  I fear that one day, I won’t be able to distinguish reality from illusion,” Qin Sang sighed, looking troubled.</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird fell silent. It didn't doubt Qin Sang, as this outcome was foreseeable. Last time, to accelerate Qin Sang's breakthrough, they hadn't resolved his inner demons, using external forces to suppress them, planting hidden dangers.  Qin Sang would inevitably suffer a greater backlash – the price of forcing growth.</p><p>At this point, apart from a few legendary treasures, few things in the world could help Qin Sang overcome this tribulation.  They had to address the issue from within, focusing on his mind and character.</p><p>No one knows where their inner demons lie.  The solution might be hidden in an unintentional, tiny opportunity. Until that opportunity is found, one can only act like a headless fly, making seemingly pointless attempts. Some actions might even seem like madness to outsiders.</p><p>Now, the mysterious Azure Bird seemed to only be able to help Qin Sang overcome his demons by tackling the illusions he was seeing; there was no better way.</p><p>“Then… let’s… try… again…”</p><p>The mysterious Azure Bird volunteered to use its power to help Qin Sang find the stone pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed and immediately agreed.</p><p>Eighty years was a long time, equivalent to a human lifetime.  He hoped this search would bear fruit.</p><p>However, Qin Sang’s condition was still stuck at the moment he shattered the treasure.  Maintaining the Sky-Awakening Thunder Garment consumed immense energy. He needed to recover before the Azure Bird could impart its power again.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to recover his qi, and the mysterious Azure Bird needed to contemplate whether this change signified anything.</p><p>“Eighty years have passed.  The Source Purity Mountain must have changed drastically. I wonder what the situation is on the battlefield. Master must have broken through his cultivation…”</p><p>Qin Sang pushed open the door, these thoughts swirling in his mind.</p><p>He had been in ‘closed cultivation’ for eighty years, and this would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the rapidly developing Source Purity Mountain.  Before his seclusion, Qin Sang had established some merit, but that would have long been exhausted. Without him to stand in front, Source Purity Mountain would face the full pressure from the Immortal City. However, as long as Master, the Transcendent Sage, successfully broke through, he should be able to support the sect's continued development.</p><p>The treasure wasn't located in an illusion, but in a strange place where reality and illusion intertwined.  Future acquisition of the treasure would rely not on his sect.</p><p>Even if the mysterious Azure Bird intervened, it could only send a few people in, losing the advantage of sheer numbers. And cultivating disciples capable of confronting the experts of the otherworldly race in the illusion was practically impossible, even for Qin Sang himself.</p><p>But a stronger sect was still beneficial; he could rest assured during his seclusion. Qin Sang wondered whether the environmental changes in his seclusion area during the eighty years he was caught in that other realm would have affected him.  Maintaining stability was always a good thing.</p><p>Qin Sang’s cave was located high up; from outside, he could clearly see the entire Jade Machine Mountain.</p><p>As expected, Qin Sang saw newly built pavilions in the mountain, and several subtle fluctuations of restrictions in the forest – likely the caves of Source Purity Mountain’s disciples.</p><p>However, there were fewer caves than Qin Sang expected.</p><p>“In all these years, only this many have passed the trials?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze shifted, towards the middle of the mountain. He saw a girl emerge from the mountain path.</p><p>A young woman, Qiu Yao, spotted Qin Sang, her expression shifting from surprise to overwhelming joy.  She quickly ascended the mountaintop and bowed deeply.  "Junior disciple Qiu Yao greets Master Uncle Qingfeng!"</p><p>"Which Master Sister is your teacher?" Qin Sang noted the young woman's late Gold Core cultivation, placing her among the top-ranking disciples of Yuan Jing Mountain.</p><p>"Master Frostfall instructed me to guard Master's cave dwelling, preventing any accidental intrusion and disturbing Master Uncle's cultivation," Qiu Yao's pretty face radiated excitement. "Master Uncle, you've finally left seclusion! I'll inform Master immediately; she's currently on the outer mountain!"</p><p>"Master Sister Frostfall is at Yuji Mountain?" Qin Sang glanced at the mountain's exterior, sensing significant changes beyond the protective array.</p><p>Qiu Yao nodded repeatedly. "Master has been stationed on the outer mountain!"</p><p>"The war hasn't ended, has it? Someone from the sect must be on the battlefield. Who's guarding the mountain gate? Has your Grandmaster emerged from seclusion?" Qin Sang inquired about Yuan Jing Mountain's situation.</p><p>Qiu Yao's expression suddenly darkened.  She said sadly, "Eighty years ago, shortly after Master Uncle entered seclusion, Grandmaster failed in a breakthrough attempt, suffering a backlash from his cultivation techniques and passed away. Our former mountain gate...was seized by others…"</p><p>"What? Grandmaster is gone?" Qin Sang was greatly surprised.</p><p>While no one could guarantee a successful breakthrough, the death of Grandmaster Tong Shen from a cultivation backlash was unexpected.  With Tong Shen's passing, his own long seclusion, and Yuan Jing Mountain's recent expansion attracting many enemies, the future looked bleak.  The two Master Sisters must have faced immense pressure.</p><p>Further questioning confirmed this.  During Qin Sang's time, Yuan Jing Mountain's aggressive expansion, seizing territory from Tian Jing Gate, and the resulting mix of disciples had created significant problems.  Qin Sang had subdued several Transformation Stage demonic cultivators, but since he was only publicly known as a Nascent Soul cultivator, this was kept secret. He intended to bring them back to the mountain later, but the appearance of a precious artifact delayed this. His Master Sisters only had a few transformed spirit beasts to rely on.</p><p>News of Grandmaster Tong Shen's death during seclusion caused an uproar.  Some claimed Yuan Jing Mountain's dual cultivation techniques were inherently flawed and unnatural, leading to internal suspicion and desertions.</p><p>Facing internal strife and external threats, plus pressure from the Immortal City, one of the two Master Sisters had to lead disciples to the battlefield.  Strained to their limits, they ultimately abandoned Qin Sang's strategic plan, making a difficult decision: abandoning the northern mountain gate. They chose trustworthy disciples and relocated the entire sect to Yuji Mountain.  They redirected a spirit vein and rebuilt the mountain gate outside Yuji Mountain, concealing the large array. Only a select few core disciples, like Qiu Yao, knew the truth.</p><p>Dong Liang Sect and surrounding forces suffered heavy losses in the war. Yuan Jing Mountain had no ambitions for expansion and maintained its alliance with Dong Liang Sect, gradually establishing itself there.</p><p>"Junior Brother!"</p><p>As they spoke, a gentle breeze carried the faint scent of orchids.</p><p>Frostfall appeared, her eyes filled with surprise and a hint of moisture. Eighty years apart, her cultivation had greatly improved, nearing the late Nascent Soul stage. Qin Sang secretly admired the power of the Yuji Mountain array.</p><p>"Disciple greets Master," Qiu Yao wisely stepped aside.</p><p>"Master Sister, it's been a long time!" Qin Sang smiled, sighing, "I didn't expect such changes in the outside world after my seclusion."</p><p>"Junior Brother's cultivation…"</p><p>Frostfall noticed that Qin Sang's cultivation hadn't changed at all since his seclusion. Publicly, his cultivation of the Water-Fire Harmony technique was only at the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly. "Eighty years wasted, no progress. I've disappointed you, Master Sister."</p><p>"A temporary setback is nothing. As long as you're safe, that's all that matters. With your talent, Junior Brother, you'll surely make a breakthrough later," Frostfall reassured him repeatedly. Since their Master's death, she and Qing Hong had worried most about Qin Sang, fearing he might follow in their Master's footsteps during his seclusion.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang unharmed, she felt relieved. Even though his cultivation had stagnated for eighty years, she remained confident in him.  Simultaneously, she felt an indescribable emotion. The previous Qin Sang possessed extraordinary talent, like the moon in the sky, making any woman feel inferior in his presence.</p><p>This breakthrough attempt failed, wasting eighty years.  Falling from the heavens brought them closer together!</p><p>Shuang Luo felt ashamed of her own thoughts, silently berating herself.  Her expression dimmed as she said, “It is we who disappointed our junior brother.  He must know of the sect's circumstances…”</p><p>Qin Sang said apologetically, "Back then, I was too complacent, underestimating the hardship of cultivation and the dangers of the immortal world. I implicated both senior sisters, causing you so much pressure. From now on, I will be grounded and won't have unrealistic expectations."</p><p>Shuang Luo said with relief, “It’s best that you think this way, junior brother!  These years, the one under the greatest pressure wasn't me, but Senior Sister Qing Hong. She's been guarding the front lines most of the time, while I only needed to oversee the mountain gate.  She’s still at the front. I’ve sent a message – she'll be overjoyed to hear of your emergence from seclusion.”</p><p>“Since seclusion won’t bring a breakthrough, I must find experience on the battlefield. I’ll go to the front lines to relieve Senior Sister Qing Hong and let her rest!”</p><p>For Qin Sang, Yuan Jing Mountain was no longer important, but the battlefield was a necessity.</p><p>The *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique is nearing its practical application. The next breakthrough probably won't be as easy. Qin Sang needs to prepare in advance, accumulating sufficient resources. Hunting powerful demons is undoubtedly the fastest way.</p><p>Additionally, he wants to use the demons to spy on the Shadow Demon's whereabouts.</p><p>As the senior sister and junior brother spoke, they flew out of the formation. The scenery outside was vastly different from before.  There used to be a small town near Yu Ji Mountain; now it’s incorporated into the mountain gate, restoring the sect's appearance.</p><p>Yuan Jing Mountain disciples call the true Yu Ji Mountain the "inner mountain" and the area outside the formation the "outer mountain."</p><p>After relocating the mountain gate, Yuan Jing Mountain's disciples decreased by 90%, but their resolve strengthened.  Their accumulated foundation remained. Now, allied with Dong Liang Sect, Yuan Jing Mountain is a major force in the region.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed at Yu Ji Mountain for a while, helping Shuang Luo and the sect solve some thorny problems, and utilizing the formation to comprehend the Yin and Yang Dao, aiming to quickly cultivate the Water-Fire Harmony chapter to the Nascent Soul stage for greater convenience.</p><p>Then Qin Sang bid farewell to Senior Sister Shuang Luo and rushed to the battlefield.</p><p>Back at the front lines, he didn't rush to see Qing Hong; his meeting with the mysterious Azure-lu was approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang found an uninhabited area to await the mysterious Azure-lu's response.</p><p>Several days later, he contacted the mysterious Azure-lu, preparing to transmit the divine ability.</p><p>“This time… you can… be bolder…”</p><p>said the mysterious Azure-lu.</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. His cultivation was vastly different; he no longer needed to be timid.</p><p>Having done it once, Qin Sang was now adept. He carefully visualized every detail of the stone pavilion.</p><p>Soon, that familiar feeling returned.</p><p>In the ethereal realm, Qin Sang soared through the stars, merging with the Milky Way. The earth seemed distant, earthly things minuscule, yet clearly visible.</p><p>Countless images flooded in. His vision wasn't wider than before, but many places had undergone drastic changes.</p><p>In an instant, countless images flowed before his eyes. Qin Sang felt a splitting headache, but it was much better than last time.</p><p>The world’s only ‘stone pavilion’ had been incorporated into Yuan Jing Mountain's gate.  Qin Sang awaited a second.</p><p>The next moment, all the images rapidly faded. Qin Sang trembled, pain flashing in his eyes, but more so, surprise.</p><p>He saw it!</p><p>Amongst a forest, a stone pavilion.</p><p>This pavilion was crudely built, far from the splendor of the Ning family's pavilion. But its shape and every carving perfectly matched his memory!</p><p>The pavilion was located…</p><p>Qin Sang looked north, took a moment to regain his composure, and immediately set off.</p><p>“You… found it?” asked the mysterious Azure-lu.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, "I seem to have seen a similar pavilion, but I don't know if it's the one I'm searching for."</p><p>He wasn't sure if he'd find Liuli this time, but he couldn't say he’d found nothing. Otherwise, it would be harder to ask the mysterious Azure-lu for help in the future, so Qin Sang spoke vaguely.</p><p>“Could it be?  Regardless… whether it is or not… go and look… ”</p><p>The mysterious Azure-lu still held little hope. However, if it could resolve Qin Sang's troubles, it wouldn't be in vain.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled day and night, crossing mountains and valleys, heading north.  The mysterious Azure-lu's power was indeed vast. When he reached the vicinity of the pavilion, he effortlessly found the scene he had seen 'in the heavens'!</p>
