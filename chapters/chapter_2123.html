<h1>Chapter 2113: Yuanxiang</h1><p>Many have been indoctrinated since beginning their cultivation journey with the idea that the Storm World is on the brink of collapse, viewing the Changyou tribe as their greatest enemy and personally fighting them on the battlefield. For disciples of the Green Sheep Temple and cultivators throughout the Storm World, this is an unprecedented time of peace.</p><p>Only a few, like Qin Sang, know how perilous and urgent the situation truly is. Fortunately, the Lu family army has yet to appear, and the Changyou tribe remains inactive.</p><p>As time passes, the situation gradually shifts in Qin Sang's favor.</p><p>Following her breakthrough, Zhuque quickly solidified her cultivation and rushed to the Western Lands to oversee the branch temple.</p><p>Qin Sang, now free, doesn’t return to the Green Sheep Temple.  His whereabouts are erratic; he appears sporadically throughout the Storm World, secretly making preparations.</p><p>…</p><p>A storm is brewing.</p><p>This calm feels like the eye of a hurricane.</p><p>On the Western border, gentle sea breezes push waves onto the shore, creating white foam that dances on the surface.</p><p>A flock of seabirds glides across the sky, tracing elegant arcs before disappearing into the clouds.</p><p>As the birds vanish, two streaks of light appear from nowhere, silent yet incredibly fast, instantly soaring above the Western Lands.</p><p>Within the light, two figures are faintly visible. One is Yuan Miao; the other is a white-haired old man, shorter than Yuan Miao, with a large round belly, a long beard almost dragging on the ground, cloudy eyes, and an air of intoxication.</p><p>He carries a cane – a smooth, luminous yellow wooden stick of unknown material – topped with a red gourd that sways gently in the breeze.</p><p>Entering the Western Lands, Yuan Miao moves his lips, about to introduce himself, but seeing the old man heading straight for the Great Compassion Temple, seemingly very familiar with the area, he closes his mouth, his eyes filled with question.</p><p>Yuan Miao suppresses his curiosity and silently follows the white-haired old man across the desert.</p><p>Along the way, Yuan Miao notices an increasing number of temples and altars built in the desert, realizing the scale of the array is far larger than he anticipated.</p><p>Previously, he thought Qin Sang was overreacting; the Changyou tribe would struggle to find allies capable of challenging Qin Sang.</p><p>Now he understands the prudence.  That fellow cultivator, Qu Lin of the Siyou tribe, has far more connections than he realized.</p><p>The old man also notices the altars, pausing above a temple but without forcing entry. He watches with amusement for a while before moving on.</p><p>The monks inside remain oblivious to his presence, but Zhuque, stationed at the Western Lands branch temple, feels her feathers ruffle!</p><p>After entering the Western Lands, neither Yuan Miao nor the old man conceals their presence.</p><p>As the array nears completion, the temple guardian can sense each altar and the energy fluctuations near them through the connections between them.</p><p>When Yuan Miao and the old man pass an altar, Zhuque perceives two powerful auras heading deeper into the Storm World.</p><p>Their approach is utterly brazen.  One aura is particularly immense, surpassing even Qin Sang's manifestation in strength; their realm is beyond doubt.</p><p>The arrival of such a powerful figure at this time is hardly auspicious.</p><p>Zhuque is unsure if the array is ready or how effective it will be, but she certainly can't intercept them herself!</p><p>She immediately activates the restrictions, triggering the altars to inform Qin Sang's manifestation at the main altar.</p><p>Yuan Miao and the old man remain unaware that a bird is terrified by their presence.</p><p>Leaving the temple, they continue eastward.</p><p>Approaching the Great Compassion Temple, the old man’s expression changes slightly. He suddenly stops, gazes into the distance, then uses a burst of speed, disappearing into the sky, leaving behind a single sentence:</p><p>“Little Monkey, I’ll go meet him first. You follow slowly.”</p><p>Yuan Miao’s face twitches, roaring inwardly, “Ancestor, I’ve grown up!”</p><p>‘Little Monkey’ is his childhood nickname, given because he resembled a monkey at birth by a certain ancestor.</p><p>Since his ascension to the Void Realm, almost nobody dares to use it.</p><p>But this… this one…</p><p>Yuan Miao deflates.</p><p>…</p><p>At the desert's edge, Qin Sang speeds through the air.</p><p>He holds an object: a three-story pagoda, crafted from crystal, exquisitely translucent.</p><p>It is the treasure refined by Si Lu, called the Void-Severing Spirit Pagoda. It can restrain the Siyou tribe's ability to transform, but requires precise timing to unleash its full potential and trap opponents; it is not easy to use.</p><p>Qin Sang was studying a treasure, hoping for inspiration to apply to his Thunder Altar.  He held the Broken Void Pagoda, his brow furrowed. He had been inspecting the inland region when he received news and rushed here.</p><p>According to Zhuque's report, two individuals arrived, one of whom is likely Yuan Miao.  Yuan Miao hadn't responded to his correspondence, and his unannounced arrival with a mysterious expert is perplexing.</p><p>Qin Sang believes Yuan Miao wouldn't attack without reason.  Protected by the Sky Eye Butterfly's mystical light, he came in person to avoid any discourtesy.</p><p>While flying, Qin Sang sensed an unfamiliar presence approaching.  He immediately stored the Broken Void Pagoda, slowed his flight, and grew wary.</p><p>Moments later, Qin Sang sharply turned towards a nearby forest, hearing a voice.</p><p>“You cultivate Buddhist powers yet built a Daoist altar. Are you a Buddhist disciple or a Daoist inheritor?”</p><p>From a large tree, a white-haired elder appeared, legs crossed on a branch, his long beard cascading down.</p><p>He took a red gourd, uncorked it, releasing a rich aroma.</p><p>The scent filled the forest, stirring the plants and animals, which appeared drunk, flushed, and swaying before falling asleep.</p><p>The elder took a satisfying swig, watching Qin Sang with amusement.</p><p>Qin Sang’s nostrils flared. This was no ordinary alcohol; its fragrance alone could enlighten many creatures, potentially altering their destinies.</p><p>“I am Qin Sang. May I ask your honorable name?”</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a nearby tree, bowing respectfully but not subserviently.  He was unsettled.</p><p>Neither Si Lu nor Yuan Miao had discerned the altar's origin, yet this person had. He clearly knew the human race well; his connection to them was unknown.</p><p>“A Daoist inheritor, indeed…”</p><p>The elder nodded. “Old man Yuan Xiang.”</p><p>Yuan Xiang!  The Zhu Yan clan's leader!</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. He hadn't expected this.</p><p>The Si You clan had sent spies, an attack was imminent.  The Zhu Yan clan, realizing Yuan Miao's lack of control, sent a higher-ranking individual – understandably.</p><p>To Qin Sang's astonishment, it was the clan leader!</p><p>Excluding those at the Saint and Ancestor levels in the Holy Lands, the leaders of the great clans are the pinnacle of the heterogenous races, few in number.  Their focus is typically on reaching the Saint level. Yuan Xiang, long retired, was rarely seen.</p><p>Yuan Xiang's presence, accompanying Yuan Miao, was undeniable.  A powerful figure like him wouldn't bother impersonating another.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression hardened. "I didn't know it was the Clan Leader.  My apologies for any inadequacy or disrespect. I beg your forgiveness."</p><p>“Daoist seniors live simply, unconcerned with formalities, a free and natural life, which I admire.”</p><p>Yuan Xiang wiped his mouth, dismissing it casually.</p><p>Qin Sang thought that applied more to the Dan Ding sect of Daoism; he knew the Fu Zhu sect's rules and etiquette were quite complex.</p><p>This confirmed Yuan Xiang’s familiarity with humankind; he might have left the Misty Sea and journeyed through the Great Zhou.</p><p>The small Storm Realm attracting the Clan Leader was unexpected. This unusual situation raised numerous questions for Qin Sang.</p><p>He sensed something more was at play.</p><p>Logically, the Storm Realm's ascension into Zhu Yan territory shouldn’t have gone unnoticed.</p><p>Qin Sang had considered how to interact with the Zhu Yan clan.  His investigations revealed strange circumstances:  the existence of the Qing Ling Qi treasure, the Long You clan's reasons for concealment, the Zhu Yan clan's leniency toward the Yu clan, and Yuan Miao's ignorance, led Qin Sang to believe these facts.</p><p>Yuan Xiang's sudden appearance suggested these were merely appearances.</p><p>This unexpected variable was both good and bad. Qin Sang's thoughts raced as Yuan Xiang continued, “Since you’re a Daoist inheritor, did the Glass Fairy’s master send you?”</p><p>He muttered, “They should be master and student by now.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed; a wave of shock ran through him.</p><p>It was all a facade. The Storm Realm’s undisturbed existence for nearly a millennium in the Misty Sea had a hidden reason!</p><p>The Glass Fairy Yuan Xiang mentioned clearly wasn't Bing Yao; they were already master and student, making “becoming master and student” illogical.</p><p>The ruins of the Ziwei Palace suggested Bing Yao was likely dead.</p><p>Liuli's new master's identity remains a complete mystery.  Tong Lingyu, Li Yufu, even Shi Xue – nobody in the Storm World knows anything!  Liuli's recent trip was likely a visit to this master.</p><p>Yuan Xiang's unusually solemn demeanor when mentioning this person suggests the master's cultivation and status are extremely high.</p><p>Could it be a long-since ascended elder?  Or perhaps a powerful human cultivator traveling through these lands?</p><p>However, Qin Sang's thoughts turned to the Storm World's many secrets – beyond the Ziwei Palace, there are beings even the First Sword Servant fears. Could there be more to the world's ascensions than meets the eye? Could I finally glimpse a corner of this iceberg?</p><p>"I don't know which individual the Clan Chief refers to, but it's certainly not someone I know," Qin Sang replied after a moment's thought.</p><p>"Indeed!  It seems you ascended from the Lower Realm to the Great Thousand World, later learning of this matter and coming here of your own accord, not guided by anyone.  The vastness of the Great Thousand World is immeasurable; your ability to find this place is truly remarkable."</p><p>Yuan Xiang took another gulp of wine, sighing deeply. "It's an unforeseen turn of events, leading to so many misunderstandings."</p><p>Qin Sang now had a vague idea and pressed further, "Clan Chief, what misunderstandings are you referring to?"</p><p>"Since you don't know the individual, I shouldn't reveal their identity…"</p><p>Yuan Xiang fell silent, seemingly considering what he could and couldn't reveal.</p><p>"Years ago, this person sought me out, asking me to look after you, to prevent your clan's extinction. However, the longstanding feud between your clan and the Changyou clan is deep-rooted. As the superior clan, I couldn't favor an outsider, forcefully preventing the Changyou clan's revenge.  So I made an agreement with them: I wouldn't interfere in your conflicts with the Changyou clan.  As long as you didn't initiate conflicts, no one would attack you, and no one would bully you.  They agreed.  They haven't appeared since, and I've never interfered. Your alliance with the Siyou clan has brought major trouble, and I can't interfere."</p><p>Qin Sang instantly understood.  Previous uncertainties were resolved.  The Storm World's survival in the Yi Ren territory was indeed due to protection, but only Liuli knew about it.</p><p>Qin Sang became even more curious about Liuli's master's identity.</p><p>For reasons unknown, this person never appeared, only asking Clan Chief Yuan Xiang for covert protection. Was it because this individual was unable to intervene directly, or was it a test for Liuli?</p><p>The "major trouble" Yuan Xiang spoke of was undoubtedly the Siyou clan's impending attack. It seems I unintentionally caused this major problem.</p><p>But if I hadn't returned, and Minzhuo's breakthrough didn't happen, the Storm World's situation would still be extremely precarious. I wonder if Clan Chief Yuan Xiang would have intervened.</p><p>"Clan Chief, is this 'major trouble' the Siyou clan's Lu family?" Qin Sang asked, feigning ignorance.</p><p>"It's not just the Hanjiang Lu family. The imperial clan is involved too. They claim the individual you allied with is a traitor from the Yanshan Si family, and imperial clan experts will join the attack.  You've become the Yanshan Si family's vassal clan; it's an internal Siyou clan matter. I can't intervene directly; at best, I can place some limitations on them and delay things for a while.  Whether you survive depends entirely on yourselves!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's calm demeanor, Yuan Xiang looked at him intently, "You don't seem panicked. It seems you have a plan."</p><p>"I've already secured a safe location and relocated some younger members; at worst, the clan's lineage will be preserved,"</p><p>Qin Sang said gravely.</p><p>Everything was unfolding as expected, even better than anticipated.</p><p>This is Zhuyan territory; the Siyou clan can't launch a full-scale attack.  If Clan Chief Yuan Xiang is willing, he can certainly propose reasonable restrictions on the Siyou clan's experts.  If he cooperates to buy us time until the Thunder Altar is complete, the outcome is uncertain!</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang wouldn't reveal his true thoughts, even though Clan Chief Yuan Xiang seemed friendly.</p><p>He urgently asked, "Clan Chief Yuan Xiang, can you contact Liuli's master, or tell me their location?  I wish to visit them personally."</p><p>"Mount Ziyun. Are you familiar with it?" Yuan Xiang countered.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, then shook his head slightly.</p><p>Legend speaks of many secluded human sects and experts beyond Kanzhou, in the East Sea. Qin Sang had heard some tales, but not of Mount Ziyun.</p><p>"That's it then,"</p><p>Yuan Xiang said, "That individual has always cultivated on Mount Ziyun. But I only know it's near the Misty Sea; I don't know its exact location and can't contact them. It's always Mount Ziyun that contacts our clan."</p>
