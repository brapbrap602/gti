第一千四百一十五章 ‘卍’ Character Seal

Oppressive heat.
It was like throwing oneself into a fiery furnace.
This was the most direct impression Qin Sang had after entering Pure Ocean Sect.
Even with his mid-Nascent Soul cultivation, he couldn't shield himself from the outside influence.
It was hard to imagine just how much Crimson Flame aura had accumulated within Pure Ocean Sect.
These Crimson Flame auras were suppressed here; what was inside the spiritual array was just the tip of the iceberg.
Qin Sang even suspected that Pure Ocean Sect could explode at any moment, turning the sect and anyone who dared to trespass into ashes.
He cautiously observed for a long time, confirming that there was indeed no one else in Pure Ocean Sect.
"Thanks to the Heaven's Eye Butterfly's ability. Also, the Fire Jade Centipede guided the way, allowing me to be one step ahead of Old Devil Hunmo, breaking through the formation first..."
Qin Sang roughly understood the reason, but he didn't relax because of it. "Old Devil Hunmo knows Pure Ocean Sect very well, his cultivation is stronger than mine, and he has helpers. They certainly won't be much slower than me. Golden Peak, Buddhist Pagoda... these places are probably important locations within Pure Ocean Sect, likely containing Buddhist treasures, but they are also sealed by powerful restrictions. I estimate I'll only be able to break through one place at most before Old Devil Hunmo comes in."
His mind racing with these thoughts, Qin Sang rapidly descended, while carefully examining the surrounding environment.
His vision was affected by the purple flowing fire, but he could roughly make out the outline of Pure Ocean Sect.
Then, Qin Sang looked up again, gazing at the sky.
Through the purple flowing fire, he could vaguely see the golden shield covering Pure Ocean Sect, and could imagine that the golden shield was a manifestation of the sect's protective grand array.
Just as he had previously expected.
The range of Pure Ocean Sect wasn't large, and neither was the spiritual array.
He had spent a full five days, but in reality, he had been moving back and forth in a small area. The boundless space of the spiritual array was just an illusion.
This was definitely not a good thing.
The narrower the place, the higher the chance of Qin Sang being discovered, and the less room he had to maneuver against his opponents.
Forcing his way through unfamiliar Buddhist restrictions would inevitably create unusual phenomena. As long as Qin Sang made any big movements, he wouldn't be able to hide it from Old Devil Hunmo's senses.
Qin Sang's expression was solemn.
He was isolated and without help, feeling somewhat tied down.
Having not seen Valley Master Mu and the others for a long time, Qin Sang suspected they had already met with misfortune. Being ambushed by a Great Cultivator and escaping unscathed was already a result worth celebrating.
The enemy was strong and he was weak.
Moreover, the enemy had helpers.
"Five days have passed, and I should be able to attract a few more Nascent Souls. I hope they haven't joined forces. The more chaotic the situation, the better, preferably with Old Devil Hunmo's mortal enemies, leading to a treasure-snatching battle, so I can fish in troubled waters..."
Qin Sang thought to himself, feeling a bit regretful.
He was new to this place and didn't know the intricate relationships between the Nascent Souls of the Boundless Sea, otherwise he could have used their grudges to actively create opportunities.
Contemplating his strategy, Qin Sang passed through the purple flowing fire and landed on a mountaintop.
The mountain rocks were scalding hot.
This place was once lush and vibrant, with birds singing and flowers blooming, but now it had become scorched earth, lifeless and silent.
"Let's not think about so much first. At least get one treasure first, then adapt to the situation later."
Qin Sang stood on solid ground, his gaze shifting.
Those insignificant Buddhist Sects aside, he had finally found the remains of a powerful Buddhist Sect, but the Jade Buddha remained silent, not giving any guidance, which made him somewhat disappointed.
Finally, Qin Sang locked onto two of the most conspicuous places.
One was the center where two mountain ranges intersected.
There, Crimson Flame aura gushed out, and the Golden Peak was built right next to it, on the summit of a nearby mountain, also the highest peak in the entire Pure Ocean Sect.
The second was a thirteen-story Buddhist Pagoda.
The Buddhist Pagoda was further away, built on a hillside, its Buddhist light slightly dimmer, not as magnificent as the Golden Peak, but still extraordinary.
The Golden Peak and the Buddhist Pagoda were clearly important locations within Pure Ocean Sect, and Qin Sang saw them as equally valuable.
But Qin Sang didn't move, because the Fire Jade Centipede pointed in another direction!
Not the Buddhist Pagoda, nor the Golden Peak, but behind him, almost at the end of the mountain range, in a valley!
Qin Sang strained his eyes to look, only seeing purple flowing fire.
His heart stirred slightly. "The Myriad Spirit Fruit is there, very likely the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree! Pure Ocean Sect's medicine garden has been preserved, probably with more than just the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree. Getting a few spirit herbs would make the trip worthwhile. The Golden Peak and Buddhist Pagoda are tempting, but their restrictions are also very strong. I might not be able to break through before Old Devil Hunmo comes in, and even if I do, I might not get treasures suitable for me. Spirit herbs are different, and the Myriad Spirit Fruit is related to the advancement of spirit insects..."
Without hesitation, Qin Sang immediately decided to go to the medicine garden first!
Just as he was about to act, he suddenly noticed something, abruptly turning his head back to stare at the place where Crimson Flame aura was gushing out, then looking up at the sky, his eyes flashing.
Only now did he notice.
In the mouth of the mountain where the Crimson Flame aura gushed out, there was a faint golden light flickering, actually a '卍' character, resembling a seal.
The '卍' character seal, the restrictions on the Golden Peak and the Buddhist Pagoda, and even the sect's protective grand array.
These forces seemed to be one entity!
"Could it be that the entire Pure Ocean Sect is a giant seal? What is being sealed inside the Crimson Flame aura? What consequences would breaking the seal cause?"
This thought suddenly appeared in Qin Sang's mind, his eyes slightly narrowed.
He discovered more details. The Golden Peak was fine, but the Buddhist Pagoda had a feeling of being on the verge of collapse.
Thoughts flashed through his mind, but Qin Sang's movements didn't stop at all.
He rapidly swept over one mountain peak after another, constantly paying attention to the changes in the spiritual array above.
The Fire Jade Centipede became more and more active, indicating that he was getting closer and closer to the Myriad Spirit Fruit.
Soon, Qin Sang arrived near that valley, looking down and discovering that this place was actually sealed by a layer of mist. Although it had been invaded by the flowing fire and turned purple, and had been damaged, the restrictions here were still preserved.
A look of joy flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He scanned around, left a Nascent Soul puppet hiding in the shadows to be on alert, and slipped into the mist.
'Hoo hoo...'
The mist churned.
The restrictions here were indeed affected, but they weren't as grand as the sect's protective grand array.
Qin Sang quickly found a flaw and entered it, first seeing a square piece of land in front of him.
"It really is a medicine garden!"
This piece of land had also become scorched earth, and the spirit herbs inside had long been reduced to ashes.
Qin Sang followed the Fire Jade Centipede's guidance, continuing to explore deeper into the mist.
One patch of scorched earth after another, causing regret.
Finally, Qin Sang stopped, the Fire Jade Centipede in his hand restless, eager to rush out.
The Myriad Spirit Fruit was right in front, but Qin Sang's vision didn't show any Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree, but dense purple mist, with nothing unusual.
"A blindfold?"
Qin Sang thought to himself.
Compared to the other medicine fields, Pure Ocean Sect clearly placed more importance on the Myriad Spirit Fruit Tree.
"Could it be that Pure Ocean Sect really has the method for refining Tranquilizing Incense?" (Alternate: Spirit Calming Incense)
While thinking about these things, Qin Sang summoned the Heaven's Eye Butterfly, using the Witch Clan secret technique to cooperate with it in displaying its divine ability, carefully observing for a long time, and finally discovered a clue.
"Go!"
Qin Sang shouted softly, soaring into the air on his sword, fiercely stabbing towards an empty space in the purple mist.
'Boom!'
The mist shook, and the sword light disappeared out of thin air.
At the same time, a point of golden light suddenly burst out from the mist, but it was fleeting, instantly dissipating into nothingness.
Qin Sang wasn't surprised, but delighted. Recalling the strange phenomenon just now, after a moment, he controlled his sword to stab again.
