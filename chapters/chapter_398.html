<h1>Chapter 391: Magical Treasure</h1><p>The Yellow Sand Banner enveloped the entire ice cave.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's control, over ninety percent of the banner's power surged towards Yu Hua, disrupting his senses, alarming the Flying Horned Dragonfish, and guiding them towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted swiftly, merely needing to steer the already agitated dragonfish, and they immediately located Yu Hua.</p><p>Yu Hua was once again assaulted by the dragonfish, but this time he was prepared.</p><p>Furthermore, the dragonfish, having endured a previous battle and the storm's impact, were considerably weakened, with many injured.  They could no longer fully restrain Yu Hua as before.</p><p>Qin Sang remained stationary, summoning a Corpse Puppet to shield him while simultaneously revealing the banner in his palm.  Rolling Yin energy surged as he raced against time to deploy the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation.</p><p>He had considered luring Yu Hua into the formation, hoping to utilize the Flying Night Devil to eliminate him. However, upon reflection, he realized the difficulty was too great. The Night Devil disregarded the puppets, not him.</p><p>Moreover, Yu Hua could sense his location through the Heart-Devouring Insects.</p><p>Using the puppet as a decoy while hiding himself wouldn't work either.</p><p>The Ten Yama Banner was potent, especially with the dragonfish assisting.  As long as he had the opportunity to deploy the formation, it would suffice.  There was no need to gamble everything unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A bolt of lightning tore through the yellow sand, hurtling towards him. Yu Hua, having sensed Qin Sang through the insects, repeated his previous tactic.</p><p>Qin Sang released the puppet precisely to counter Yu Hua's sneak attack. The puppet's strength was limited; sending it to engage Yu Hua would only lead to the same fate as the Soul-Binding Rope and the Black Dragon Stone.</p><p>The motionless puppet abruptly opened its eyes, seizing Qin Sang and swiftly dodging.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after this single attack, Yu Hua made no further moves.</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly surprised and uneasy, but his actions continued uninterrupted. The Ten Yama Banner spun rapidly around him, the formation gradually taking shape.</p><p>‘Whoosh… Whoosh…’</p><p>Sand and Yin energy mingled, creating a dim twilight as the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation finally materialized!</p><p>Ten ghostly banners stood firm, rotating slowly around Qin Sang, spectral threads drifting.</p><p>Exhausted, Qin Sang inwardly sighed in relief.  Without hesitation, he poured his energy into the formation. Black flames erupted on the spectral threads, forming a spear that pierced through the air.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the threads were abruptly halted mid-flight, unable to advance further.</p><p>The yellow sand dispersed.</p><p>Witnessing the scene before him, Qin Sang's heart plummeted.</p><p>Blocking the spectral threads were identical black flames!</p><p>Looking at Yu Hua, he saw him employing the same method to fend off the dragonfish's attacks, although the lightning barrier surrounding him was significantly thinner.</p><p>Around Yu Hua, Yin energy churned wildly, obscuring his figure.  Flickering within the energy, also rotating, were Ten Yama Banners!</p><p>A complete set of ten!</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't anticipated Yu Hua possessing the complete Ten Yama Encirclement Formation!</p><p>At the Yuanzhao Sect, based on certain details and conversations with Meng Ruhui and others, Qin Sang had speculated about Yu Hua's identity.  He likely wasn't a spy planted by the Kuiyin Sect, but a Yuanzhao Sect disciple who, having lost hope of achieving Foundation Establishment, was seduced by the demonic sect and became a willing collaborator in exchange for opportunities.</p><p>Such individuals wouldn't earn Yi Tiannie's trust before the completion of their schemes, and their status within the Kuiyin Sect wouldn't be high, possibly even lower than Zhao Yan's.</p><p>Through several encounters, Qin Sang observed that Yu Hua always consulted with Zhao Yan before making decisions, lacking the demeanor a Foundation Establishment cultivator would typically display towards a Qi Refining cultivator. This confirmed his suspicion.</p><p>Logically, he shouldn't have been granted so many Ten Yama Banners.  Yue Wu, despite diligently serving Yi Tiannie, only possessed four.</p><p>This situation completely exceeded Qin Sang's expectations, disrupting all his plans.</p><p>Noticing the formation around Qin Sang, Yu Hua spoke with surprise, “A complete Ten Yama Encirclement Formation?  Even in its prime, few in the Kuiyin Sect possessed such a thing.  No wonder that brat Zhao Yan couldn't defeat you!  Fortunately, I didn't underestimate you!”</p><p>Qin Sang ignored Yu Hua's words, offering no reply.  He exerted all his effort to control the formation, hoping to distract Yu Hua and create an opening for the dragonfish.</p><p>His spiritual energy depleted rapidly, yet the spectral threads couldn't advance, while the dragonfish remained unable to breach the lightning barrier.</p><p>Yu Hua fought against both, holding his ground but also struggling to break free.</p><p>However, if this continued, not only would he fail to defeat Yu Hua, but Qin Sang himself would exhaust his spiritual energy, unable to maintain the formation.</p><p>The situation was extremely perilous, yet Qin Sang remained remarkably calm.</p><p>Knowing the Ten Yama Banner alone wouldn't suffice, a decisive glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He abruptly struck his dantian, channeling all his spiritual energy into the formation without reservation.</p><p>Then, he tossed back a handful of pills and retrieved a talisman from his storage pouch – the Silver Knife Talisman Treasure obtained from Luo Xingnan's remains.</p><p>Empowered by Qin Sang's sacrifice, the spirits of the formation became invigorated, their power surging, enabling the formation to function autonomously.</p><p>Excruciating pain shot through Qin Sang's meridians, as if sliced by knives. Yet, enduring the agony, he refined the medicinal power, accumulating some spiritual energy which he immediately infused into the talisman.</p><p>“Faster! Faster!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were bloodshot as he stared intently at the talisman, watching its glow intensify, urging it on in his mind.</p><p>Time seemed to crawl to a standstill.</p><p>A single moment felt longer than an entire day.</p><p>Finally, the talisman trembled slightly, detaching from his hand.  With a 'crack', it shattered, transforming into a small silver knife.</p><p>Under these circumstances, Qin Sang couldn't conserve the talisman's power.  Without hesitation, he unleashed its full might.</p><p>The silver knife pointed towards Yu Hua, its tip quivering.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang prepared to launch the talisman, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Yu Hua's location was completely shrouded in Yin energy, obscuring what transpired within.  But as Qin Sang readied the talisman, ghostly wails emanated from within.</p><p>Qin Sang instantly recognized them as the cries of the Ten Yama Banner's spirits.</p><p>Their wails contained neither joy nor pain.</p><p>Only the involuntary roars of beings subjected to immense pressure would produce such sounds.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>Confusion filled Qin Sang's mind. He had used the Ten Yama Banner for so long and was intimately familiar with it. He had never heard such sounds before.</p><p>“Could it be that the Ten Yama Encirclement Formation has a transformation I'm unaware of?”</p><p>This thought had barely crossed his mind when a violent gust of Yin wind erupted from Yu Hua's location, the energy churning wildly.  Then, the ghostly figures of the ten spirits slowly emerged from the Yin energy.</p><p>Their appearance was bizarre, drastically different from anything Qin Sang had seen before.</p><p>The spirits were bathed in bloodlight, their translucent bodies filled with undigested blood, their forms riddled with blood vessels.</p><p>And upon their shoulders, they each carried an enormous banner!</p><p>Upon seeing this banner, Qin Sang's pupils contracted sharply.</p><p>The true Ten Yama Banner!</p><p>A Magical Treasure!</p>
