<h1>Chapter 1375: Fengyang Mountain</h1><p>A young man in armor, a Golden Core cultivator, landed before the hall, his遁光 (swift movement) fading.</p><p>He hurried into the hall and bowed to the three individuals inside.</p><p>“Have you found any trace of him?”</p><p>Before the armored youth could report, the elder in blue robes asked directly.</p><p>“Reporting to Master, upon receiving the order, I personally led a search across the islands. We searched for five days, covering almost every island, but found nothing unusual.”</p><p>The armored youth replied with a bow.</p><p>The elder in blue robes nodded slightly, not surprised.</p><p>From the man's actions, it was clear he was very cautious and would not leave any trace.</p><p>The elder’s concern lay elsewhere, “Has the news been spread?”</p><p>The armored youth nodded, “Messages have been sent to all islands and to all cultivators.  Orders were given to send word back to Fengyang Mountain. Fourth Brother must have already begun his actions…”</p><p>“Good! You may leave now. Avoid any further actions, lest you make a mistake.”</p><p>The elder dismissed the young man and turned to the two Yuan Ying cultivators, “That man is likely hiding somewhere recovering from his injuries. As soon as he leaves seclusion and contacts any cultivator, he will receive the message. Unless, of course, he has already left Fengyang Mountain.”</p><p>One of the Yuan Ying cultivators was a female cultivator, adorned in a phoenix crown and ornate robes, her appearance striking.  She glanced at the armored youth's retreating back, “Daoist Feng plans to invite that person to help deal with the Bifang?”</p><p>“Correct!”</p><p>The elder nodded, “To fight three great demon kings alone, especially with one being a Bifang, even I, Feng, cannot guarantee I would emerge unscathed.  The sudden appearance of such a powerful cultivator, already at odds with the Bifang, is a gift from Heaven. We must make every effort to secure his allegiance!”</p><p>The other Yuan Ying cultivator was a male cultivator.</p><p>He was handsome and elegant, dressed in black robes, a long sword at his waist, like a wandering swordsman.</p><p>The man in black chuckled lightly, “To be held in such high regard by Daoist Feng, this person must indeed have extraordinary abilities. However, a powerful cultivator like this, appearing out of nowhere in this sea region at this time…could there be a trap?  Have you investigated this person's background, Daoist Feng?”</p><p>The elder shook his head, “At the time, we only saw the man's遁光 from afar. We only know he excels at lightning escape techniques. Daoist Shen and I have racked our brains, but we can't think of anyone who fits the description. However, after he left, Daoist Shen and I followed the trail of the Bifang's pursuit and found a destroyed dragon ship. We don’t know if it’s connected to this person.”</p><p>“A dragon ship? Could this person have come from the Xingsha Islands?”</p><p>The female cultivator exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>“We don't know yet, but as long as he's not a demon, everything is fine. Whatever his plans, can he possibly hide them from our eyes?”</p><p>The elder said indifferently.</p><p>“Daoist Feng is right. He might have escaped using lightning escape techniques, his true strength may not be that great,” the man in black also looked relaxed.</p><p>…</p><p>Xuan Yue Realm.</p><p>An unnamed mountain.</p><p>Thick fog shrouded everything.</p><p>From time to time, figures using遁光 entered and exited the mist.</p><p>This was a trading hub for nearby cultivators. Of course, only low-level cultivators attended.</p><p>The fog rippled.</p><p>A figure emerged from within, Qin Sang, who had already reached Xuan Yue Island.</p><p>To avoid trouble, Qin Sang had taken a long and winding route to reach Xuan Yue Island.  His tense nerves finally relaxed, and he began to investigate the local situation.</p><p>Qin Sang stepped out of the fog, his figure flickering, and vanished into thin air.</p><p>Following this, another person emerged, rubbing his eyes vigorously, muttering "Damn it," before hurrying away.</p><p>“Fengyang Mountain…”</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop a mountain peak, gazing towards the direction of Yuejian.</p><p>According to the information he had gathered, Fengyang Mountain was the cultivation ground of a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>This person, revered as Feng Shangshi, was a mid-stage Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>All the large and small forces in the territory near Yuejian were respectful and subservient to Feng Shangshi.</p><p>He was the undisputed overlord, the strongest in the area, his influence extended beyond Fengyang Mountain. Even other Yuan Ying powers dared not show disrespect towards Feng Shangshi.</p><p>Fortunately, Feng Shangshi was not cruel, and Fengyang Mountain had a good reputation in the cultivation world and was considered righteous.</p><p>“I wonder if Feng Shangshi was one of the two who drove away the Bifang.”</p><p>Qin Sang had this thought, looking around.</p><p>The surrounding mountains stretched endlessly.</p><p>He had taken a very roundabout route.</p><p>This was no longer within Fengyang Mountain's sphere of influence, but the border region between Fengyang Mountain and another sect, Yin Yue Sect, filled with treacherous mountains and waters, unappealing to high-level cultivators.</p><p>The cultivators attending the trading event were of low cultivation, but there were those well-informed, and the news wasn't a secret.</p><p>Qin Sang learned that several months ago, all the large and small forces near Fengyang Mountain received orders to assemble at Fengyang Mountain.</p><p>The largest cultivator market is located in Fengyang Mountain. To investigate the entire Northern Sea Three Realms, a trip to Fengyang Mountain is necessary. Before that, however, I must recover my strength.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently.</p><p>He wasn't actually afraid of being drawn into turmoil.  With his current cultivation, only late-stage Yuan Ying cultivators posed a threat. He could withdraw at any time if he sensed danger; even Feng Shangshi couldn't stop him.</p><p>As a local power, Feng Shangshi undoubtedly knows many secrets.  Cultivating a relationship with him would greatly facilitate future actions.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang was curious whether Chen Yan, Gui Mu, and Dongyang Bo had crossed the storm and arrived in the Northern Sea Three Realms. If they had appeared here, Feng Shangshi should know something.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang flew towards a seemingly unremarkable mountain range.  His eyes flashed. He summoned his Golden Sinking Sword and struck the mountain with a powerful blow.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The mountains trembled. A protective barrier suddenly erupted from within the mountain, blocking the sword energy.  The scene beyond the barrier transformed dramatically; clear springs flowed, lush vegetation flourished—a veritable fairyland. Pavilions and towers were nestled amongst the trees, and figures flew out, their faces filled with panic, gazing upwards.</p><p>This was a small sect called Wanjian Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't used his full strength. After a single strike, he sheathed his sword and leisurely observed the Wanjian Sect disciples.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang was respectfully invited to the Wanjian Sect's main hall.</p><p>"Honorable senior," a cultivator trembled, addressing Qin Sang.  "All Wanjian Sect disciples are here. We obtained permission from Yin, the sect leader of YinYue Sect, to relocate here. We don't know how we have offended you, but we beg your forgiveness. I will immediately lead our disciples to leave."</p><p>The Wanjian Sect Master was only at the Golden Core stage and wasn't present. A Foundation Establishment cultivator, a woman, received Qin Sang, her body shaking as she struggled to finish her sentence.  The hearts of the Wanjian Sect disciples were filled with fear.</p><p>Qin Sang responded indifferently, "What do I want with your mountain gate? I need a place to recuperate, and this spiritual vein seems suitable. I'll borrow it for a while.  You may cultivate in the main hall; you are not permitted to leave without my permission."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang secretly released his Sky-Eyed Butterflies and walked into the sect leader's residence without looking back.</p>
