<h1>Chapter 1478: The Grand Wedding </h1><p>The cave abode.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged, facing his external incarnation. Between them floated the Solar Divine Tree, its divine birds raising their heads and tails high, with the aura of the Southern Brightness Fire occasionally surging forth. The flames illuminated their faces as both Qin Sang and his incarnation sat with their eyes closed.</p><p>They had maintained this posture for an entire month.</p><p>At this moment, the aura of the external incarnation had caught up to Qin Sang's, reaching the astonishing level of mid-Nascent Soul. Surprisingly, it had surpassed the strength of the talisman puppet, advancing rather than regressing.</p><p>The majority of this progress was due to Qin Sang's second primordial spirit refining the shadow souls within his body. Another part of the credit went to Liuli, from whom Qin Sang had borrowed some Ice Soul Essence Jade. After absorbing it, his strength rapidly rose to match his cultivation level.</p><p>Through this, Qin Sang learned that many years ago, despite failing to break through, Liuli had stubbornly resisted the influence of the demonic technique's imprint and successfully cultivated the Ice Soul Divine Light. These Ice Soul Essence Jades were no longer of much use to her, which was why Qin Sang had been able to borrow them so easily.</p><p>Back then, Bingyao had obtained a considerable amount of Ice Soul Essence Jade, but it was not as abundant as the Azure Sun Essence Jade in the Azure Sun Demon Sect, which filled the entire Divine Essence Peak and seemed inexhaustible. All the Ice Soul Essence Jade had been taken by Bingyao when she ascended, leaving only a small amount for Liuli. Once these were used up, they would have to search elsewhere for more.</p><p>Supporting Qin Sang was equivalent to supporting herself, so Liuli had handed over the remaining Ice Soul Essence Jade without hesitation.</p><p>A small portion of the shadow souls within the external incarnation remained unrefined. Qin Sang estimated that even if he refined all of them, there was little hope of breaking through to late Nascent Soul unless the Dao Manifestation Tree could bring him another unexpected surprise.</p><p>However, with his current cultivation, possessing a mid-Nascent Soul external incarnation was something others could hardly imagine. Moreover, he also had the profound ability to resurrect his main body. His current task was to assist the external incarnation in refining the Solar Divine Tree.</p><p>In Qin Sang's view, another major use of the external incarnation was to provide him with two opportunities to wield the Solar Divine Tree. The Solar Divine Tree could only be used as a Heaven-Shaking Thunder, not as a spiritual treasure. It did not require a master or a treasure-controlling technique, making its operation simple and crude—something even the external incarnation could manage.</p><p>However, from the moment the external incarnation was formed, they had embarked on two entirely different paths.</p><p>After creating the external incarnation, Qin Sang made a new discovery. The external incarnation did not necessarily have to cultivate the techniques attached to the "Cold Nether Return to Yin" scripture. To maintain the virtual Nascent Soul state of the external incarnation and reduce the risk of betrayal, the techniques were somewhat mediocre, allowing the incarnation to only refine cold energy and slowly improve its cultivation. This was a trade-off.</p><p>Qin Sang could have the external incarnation switch to other techniques, but the cost would be losing the virtual Nascent Soul state and converting it into a real Nascent Soul. Although this would not affect resurrection, it would further weaken the main body's control over the incarnation. This was a common flaw in techniques like external incarnations and second Nascent Souls.</p><p>With the help of the Jade Buddha, Qin Sang's control over the incarnation far surpassed that of others. He only needed to ensure that the incarnation's cultivation did not exceed the main body's by too much.</p><p>The external incarnation had to choose from techniques related to the path of ice and cold. The Profound Heaven Palace was not lacking in such techniques, but Qin Sang was unsure which one would suit it best. For now, he lacked the energy to carefully select one, so he maintained the status quo.</p><p>Their paths diverged.</p><p>Most of Qin Sang's treasures and secret techniques could not be fully utilized by the external incarnation, even if it tried. After careful consideration, apart from the Solar Divine Tree, the most suitable were the Golden Sinking Sword and the "Green Bamboo Sword Scripture."</p><p>The external incarnation still lacked a suitable treasure. The main body controlled fire, while the incarnation controlled the sword—a clear division of labor. Combined with the several divine abilities recorded in the "Cold Nether Return to Yin," the external incarnation already possessed considerable strength.</p><p>Time passed slowly.</p><p>After an unknown period, the tranquility of the cave was broken.</p><p>Someone outside triggered the restriction and respectfully said, "Senior, the auspicious time is approaching."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, stored away the incarnation and the Solar Divine Tree, and with a flash of light, changed into a new set of clothes. He then opened the formation.</p><p>...</p><p>The Listening Snow Pavilion.</p><p>Main Peak.</p><p>Outside, it was the depths of winter, with the earth blanketed in silver. Yet, the Listening Snow Pavilion was as warm as spring, adorned with festive red silks and bustling with activity.</p><p>Groups of disciples hurried back and forth between jade bridges and grand halls, all busy preparing for the upcoming ceremony.</p><p>Most of the disciples were beaming with joy, but some had dull eyes and blank expressions, including several female disciples.</p><p>This day had finally arrived.</p><p>Ancestor Liuli was about to hold a Dao Companion Ceremony with another man, and all the meticulous preparations for the ceremony had been done by their own hands.</p><p>As the sun set in the west, the peaks of the Listening Snow Pavilion were bathed in golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in his cave, watching the disciples of the Listening Snow Pavilion bustling outside the hall. His gaze turned to the sky, watching the gradually darkening horizon.</p><p>For a moment, he felt a sense of disorientation.</p><p>In his mortal days, marriage had been the most important event in a person's life. Now, it had become a transaction.</p><p>The rules of the Profound Heaven Palace were quite peculiar. The Dao Companion Ceremony was held at night, accompanied by the most important ritual—the Lantern Ceremony for blessings!</p><p>The peaks of the Listening Snow Pavilion were now adorned with countless red paper lanterns. Once lit, they would surely create a magnificent display of light.</p><p>The sky had not yet fully darkened, and the lantern wicks remained unlit. However, the disciples responsible for the lanterns were already in position, stationed at regular intervals. Their duty was to face the west, prepare the lanterns, arrange them according to the ritual, and ensure the flames burned brightly and steadily.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Listening Snow Pavilion was eerily silent. Countless eyes were fixed on the slowly setting sun, silently counting the time.</p><p>Night fell.</p><p>The stars and moon hung high in the sky. Originally, there was supposed to be rain and snow tonight, but the Listening Snow Pavilion had long since set up a grand formation to disperse the moisture, leaving behind a clear, starry sky.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>Suddenly, a bell toll broke the silence.</p><p>The disciples' hearts skipped a beat, and they all looked up toward the main peak, their faces filled with anticipation.</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>*Dong!*</p><p>...</p><p>The bell tolled steadily, nine times in total, its sound resonating through the heavens.</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all, a female Daoist in golden silk robes ascended from the main peak. She was Shi Xue, the head of the Listening Snow Pavilion, who had taken on the role of the high priest for this wedding ceremony.</p><p>Her steps were steady, as if walking on flat ground in the void. She stopped at a height of a hundred zhang, flicked her whisk, and clouds and mist rose, creating an ethereal atmosphere.</p><p>The clouds and mist gathered, forming a high altar.</p><p>At that moment, a group of disciples holding incense burners and jade trays flew into the air in an orderly manner, offering incense, flowers, lanterns, water, and fruit—the five offerings.</p><p>The incense was Heavenly Incense.</p><p>The flowers were the Harmony of Heaven and Earth Flowers.</p><p>The lanterns were the Red Luan Lanterns.</p><p>The water was Moonlight Nectar.</p><p>The fruit was the Immortal Peach of Ten Thousand Years.</p><p>The disciples arranged the offerings neatly and then gracefully returned.</p><p>Shi Xue walked to the altar, lit incense, and bowed. She chanted praises, performed the steps of the Big Dipper, and recited profound scriptures, appearing as if she were an immortal.</p><p>All eyes in the Listening Snow Pavilion were fixed on Shi Xue. Especially the disciples responsible for the lanterns, who were particularly solemn, not daring to slack off in the slightest.</p><p>After Shi Xue finished reciting the scriptures, she bowed again and burned more incense.</p><p>All the lantern attendants seemed to receive a signal, and in unison, they raised their hands, each holding a spiritual lantern. The flames ignited, shining brightly.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>A young female disciple, barely in her teens, nervously completed a hand seal with her other hand and gently pressed it against the lantern.</p><p>The flame of the lantern trembled and suddenly split into a hundred fiery snakes, scattering like celestial flowers in all directions, precisely landing in the lanterns and igniting their wicks.</p><p>The young disciple glanced around, relieved to see no mistakes, but then her expression turned serious again, as their duty was far from over.</p><p>In an instant, countless lanterns in the Listening Snow Pavilion lit up, their red light illuminating the sky!</p><p>Under the light of the lanterns, the dragon and phoenix patterns carved on their surfaces seemed to come alive. They broke free from the paper, their movements slightly stiff, revealing that they were made of paper cutouts.</p><p>The dragons and phoenixes did not stray far from the lanterns. Instead, they circled around them, their heads and tails connected, supporting the lanterns as they rose.</p><p>The lanterns only rose to a height of one zhang, but they grew even brighter.</p><p>The lanterns resembled fiery trees, with clouds and mist swirling around them, accompanied by celestial spirits.</p><p>The peaks of the Listening Snow Pavilion had transformed into a river of light.</p><p>The grandeur of the lanterns was immense, their merit profound.</p><p>They illuminated the heavens above and the earth below.</p><p>In all directions and through the nine nights, light was seen everywhere.</p><p>The Red Luan Lantern Ceremony!</p><p>The young disciple was mesmerized, staring at the unprecedented beauty before her, unable to tear her eyes away. She nearly forgot her important task, her eyes filled with irrepressible envy.</p><p>The Red Luan Lantern Ceremony was the highest-level ritual in the Listening Snow Pavilion, reserved for someone of Ancestor Liuli's status.</p><p>Even if she were to marry, at most, her master would serve as a witness, and she would have a wedding slightly more elaborate than a mortal's. It was impossible for the entire sect to celebrate for her.</p><p>At this moment, standing high above and looking down, the view was even more breathtaking.</p><p>Centered around the main peak of the Listening Snow Pavilion.</p><p>The Red Luan Lantern Ceremony was divided into eastern and western sections. The western section took the form of a phoenix, with each lantern resembling a fiery feather of the phoenix. As they swayed, it seemed as if the feathers were dancing, creating ripples of light.</p><p>The eastern section was long and winding, taking the form of a dragon, its scales glistening, its posture vigorous.</p><p>Shi Xue stood on the cloud altar, her steps illusory, her hand seals constantly changing. Suddenly, she pointed toward the main lantern on the altar, and a stream of light shot from her fingertip.</p><p>The main lantern lit up, as if activating the formation's core.</p><p>The main lantern gathered the light of countless lanterns, its flames shooting into the heavens!</p><p>At this moment, the stars in the sky seemed to tremble, with several stars shining brightly in response to the Red Luan Lantern Ceremony. Among them, one star stood out, its brightness surpassing even the moon, shining brilliantly in the sea of stars.</p><p>This was the Red Luan Star!</p><p>The movement of the Red Luan Star signified the union of husband and wife.</p><p>Of course, this was not truly the stars being moved, but rather an illusion created by the grand formation and the Red Luan Lantern Ceremony. Its influence was limited to the vicinity of the Listening Snow Pavilion; other regions of the North Sea could not see it.</p><p>The starlight poured down from the heavens, converging with the main lantern.</p><p>In an instant, countless illusions appeared in the night sky, including images of green birds and flying swords, as if the Red Luan Star Lord had descended to bestow blessings.</p><p>The starlight poured into the lanterns, affecting the entire Red Luan Lantern Ceremony. The light of the lanterns grew several times brighter, and the dragon and phoenix formed by the lanterns seemed on the verge of coming to life.</p><p>At this moment, even from a great distance outside the Listening Snow Pavilion, one could see the brilliant lanterns and dazzling starlight, leaving one in awe.</p><p>Shi Xue bowed again.</p><p>Suddenly, a auspicious cloud drifted over.</p><p>On the cloud stood two women, one of whom was Luo Wan.</p><p>The other was a young woman, likely her junior, with a cultivation level of only late Golden Core. Her brows carried a hint of spring, but she dared not act recklessly, restraining herself completely.</p><p>Luo Wan, however, was not so reserved. Her face still bore a seductive smile.</p><p>Some disciples of the Listening Snow Pavilion inadvertently looked up and saw Luo Wan. Their eyes immediately glazed over, unable to look away.</p><p>At that moment, several figures flew out from the peaks of the Listening Snow Pavilion, each exuding an aura no weaker than Luo Wan's. They were the Nascent Soul elders of the Listening Snow Pavilion, all returning to attend the ceremony.</p><p>They would now act as hosts for Qin Sang and Liuli, receiving the guests.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Luo, greetings."</p><p>One of them directly approached Luo Wan.</p><p>"On such a joyous day for Junior Sister Liuli, I had to come. I also wanted to see what kind of man could capture Junior Sister Liuli's heart."</p><p>Luo Wan said with a smile.</p><p>The man laughed heartily, "Fellow Daoist, please be patient. Why not enjoy some nectar and delicacies first? You'll surely get a good look later..."</p><p>As he spoke, the host and two guests flew toward Shi Xue.</p><p>Midway, more guests arrived.</p><p>In the distance, auspicious clouds gathered, with fragrant carriages and celestial birds, creating a dazzling spectacle.</p><p>Distinguished guests filled the doors, all here to celebrate the grand occasion.</p><p>Seeing this, the Nascent Soul elders of the Listening Snow Pavilion instructed the disciples to arrange seats for Luo Wan, apologized, and busied themselves.</p><p>Luo Wan flew to the front of the cloud altar.</p><p>The scenery here had already changed dramatically.</p><p>Fragrant incense swirled, and auspicious mist filled the air.</p><p>Disciples of the Listening Snow Pavilion bustled about, moving through the scene.</p><p>A guiding disciple quickly brought over a cloud bed, and immediately, a crane arrived with a jug in its beak, while flower spirits offered fruit.</p><p>The table was made of rosy clouds, and the stools were woven from mist.</p><p>A hundred delicacies and immortal fruits were laid out.</p><p>Luo Wan casually sat down, glanced at Shi Xue standing in front of the cloud altar, and transmitted a teasing message: "Old witch, I underestimated your courage. You actually dared to let Junior Sister Liuli cultivate that technique."</p><p>She mistakenly believed that Liuli had cultivated the "Goddess Heart Scripture."</p><p>Though not entirely accurate, she was not far off.</p><p>Shi Xue had no time to respond to her, as guests were arriving in droves.</p><p>Although no friends outside the Profound Heaven Palace had been invited, the Profound Heaven Palace's influence was vast. All branches, regardless of size, had to be treated equally, and no courtesy could be overlooked. Thus, there were many guests.</p><p>For a time, the skies above the Listening Snow Pavilion were filled with comings and goings, bustling with activity, and Nascent Soul elders were not uncommon.</p><p>Nascent Soul ancestors, rarely seen on ordinary days, arrived one after another.</p><p>One congratulated: "Great joy! Great joy!"</p><p>Another said: "Congratulations! Congratulations!"</p><p>Above the main peak, clouds gathered, each filled with guests.</p><p>There was no need to adhere to strict seating arrangements. Everyone sat casually, and if they encountered someone they knew, they simply joined their cloud beds together, chatting and laughing.</p><p>Everyone was beaming, creating a joyous atmosphere.</p><p>Suddenly, someone announced:</p><p>"The Grand Elder has arrived!"</p><p>Everyone fell silent and stood to welcome him.</p><p>The Grand Elder, along with several elders and the head of the Purple Mist Pavilion, arrived together, all wearing smiles.</p><p>Elder Jiang stepped forward to greet them.</p><p>Everyone exchanged greetings.</p><p>Tong Lingyu's beautiful eyes swept around as she asked with a smile, "Why haven't we seen the two newlyweds?"</p><p>Elder Jiang glanced at the sky: "The auspicious time has not yet arrived. Please, elders, take your seats and enjoy the Listening Snow Pavilion's rare Nine Splendid Immortal Peaches."</p><p>"We've long heard of the Listening Snow Pavilion's most precious treasure, said to only be brought out for the grandest ceremonies. My senior brother and I have never had the chance to taste them."</p><p>Two young men in Daoist robes walked over. One of them was handsome and quite young, yet he showed no timidity in the presence of these important figures of the Profound Heaven Palace.</p><p>Both were at the mid-Nascent Soul stage!</p><p>Elder Jiang's eyes flickered as he cupped his hands: "We have been remiss in our hospitality, Head Shang and Fellow Daoist Yue. I will have the disciples pick a basket and send it to the Heavenly Mountain."</p><p>"Elder Jiang, you are too kind. My junior brother was only joking..."</p><p>The speaker was none other than Shang Lu, the head of the Heavenly Mountain branch. His tone was gentle as he greeted everyone one by one, then led the young man surnamed Yue to a cloud bed.</p><p>The others watched their backs, some frowning, others deep in thought.</p><p>As time passed, fewer and fewer new guests arrived.</p><p>Shi Xue found a moment to approach Elder Jiang and cautiously transmitted a message: "Uncle, is that young man surnamed Yue the genius you mentioned?"</p><p>Elder Jiang sighed: "Indeed. I had high hopes for him when he first reached Nascent Soul. I never expected he would truly achieve this, breaking through to mid-Nascent Soul after just over a century of seclusion! Combined with Shang Lu's previous failure to secure the position, this is his last chance. He certainly won't miss it. With two from the Heavenly Mountain branch alone! The Heavenly Mountain branch is becoming increasingly prominent, its overall strength even surpassing that of the Profound Heaven branch. All it lacks is a pillar."</p><p>With the two from the Heavenly Mountain branch joining forces, Qin Sang would not only face an additional competitor but also the possibility of encountering them within the restrictions. Not only would he be suppressed by the restrictions, but he would also have to fight one against two!</p><p>"Shang Lu used a secret technique to forcibly increase his cultivation back then but failed to secure the position, damaging his foundation. I wonder if he has recovered. Brother-in-law's divine abilities are extraordinary; he should not fear them."</p><p>Shi Xue comforted, though she herself felt</p>
