<h1>Chapter 2209: Return to Heart Lake</h1><p>Qin Sang found himself enveloped in a silvery white expanse, surrounded by a dense shower of lightning.</p><p>These bolts were incredibly thin, as delicate as real rain, seeming to dissipate with the slightest breeze.  Qin Sang felt a cool sensation, devoid of the expected might of thunder.</p><p>Unless this lightning technique was unique, the caster's control must be incredibly refined, reaching the pinnacle of mastery.</p><p>'Whizz! Whizz! Whizz!'</p><p>The lightning grew denser, filling the entire misty sea.</p><p>Sensing something, Qin Sang looked up and saw ripples forming amidst the lightning, and within the waves, a faint green phantom slowly emerged.</p><p>As soon as the phantom appeared, it drew all the surrounding lightning towards it, its outline quickly becoming clear—it was a dragon's head.</p><p>After the head appeared, the body gradually formed, finally transforming into a lifelike green dragon, moving gracefully through the clouds.</p><p>The dragon was less than a zhang long, not as majestic as the dragons of legend, more like a young, endearing dragon.</p><p>It blinked, fixing its gaze on the Thunder Beast Guardian beside Qin Sang, then swished its tail and dived down.</p><p>Although the little green dragon didn't seem particularly powerful, Qin Sang didn't dare to be careless and quickly urged the Thunder Beast Guardian forward.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guardian charged forward, its left eye flashing brightly, emitting a silver aura from the [Name of Orb – left untranslated].</p><p>As the silver aura rapidly expanded, engulfing the void, the little dragon plunged into it.  Its body swayed slightly, causing the silver light to become unstable and the Thunder Beast Guardian to tremble violently.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed, just as he was about to defend against the impact, the little dragon suddenly froze in place, the shockwave disappearing.  Clearly, the powerful cultivator behind it had intervened!</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang’s mind calmed. This was precisely why he had asked a Saint Realm expert for help; they could completely control this lightning technique, preventing the technique from clashing with the [Name of Orb – left untranslated] and avoiding sudden backlash.  He could now fully focus on the sealing process.</p><p>The little dragon remained motionless like a statue, its scales shimmering.</p><p>After a moment's thought, Qin Sang, through the Thunder Beast Guardian, controlled the aura from the [Name of Orb – left untranslated] to contract inward.  Throughout this process, the little dragon remained perfectly still, allowing the Thunder Beast Guardian to place layer upon layer of ‘shackles’ upon it, gradually emboldening Qin Sang.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>Countless bolts of lightning surrounded the little dragon, encircling it like countless chains wrapped around its body.</p><p>Qin Sang moved faster and faster. Suddenly, the little dragon shuddered and was pulled by these ‘chains’ towards the deepest part of the aura, precisely into the left eye of the Thunder Beast Guardian!</p><p>The aura continued to contract, and the little dragon slowly descended, its body shrinking until it finally entered the Thunder Beast Guardian's eye socket.</p><p>The silver light dissipated, and the Thunder Beast Guardian's left eye shone brightly, with the faint image of a green dragon visible in its pupil.</p><p>But the seal wasn't yet complete. Qin Sang carefully checked it again and said gravely, "Senior, you may withdraw your essence."</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang let out a muffled groan as a terrifying wave of thunderous power surged from within the Thunder Beast Guardian.</p><p>The green dragon's image awoke at that moment. Its eyes, no longer gentle, were now ferocious, its head raised high, as if venting its pent-up rage.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Thunder Beast Guardian transformed into a mass of thunder, its armor becoming translucent, as an endless torrent of lightning surged towards its left eye.</p><p>Qin Sang used all his strength, pouring his consciousness and essence into the Thunder Beast Guardian, forcibly suppressing the wave of thunder, then seized the opportunity to subdue the image of the green dragon.</p><p>The green dragon's shadow thrashed its head, showing agitation and resentment, but its movements grew smaller and smaller, eventually becoming still.</p><p>"Whew..."</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled, feeling as though he had just battled a powerful being, and thankfully, he had won.</p><p>The thunder around the Thunder Beast Guardian dissipated, its breathing returning to normal as it stood beside Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Thunder Beast Guardian's left eye. A tiny image of the green dragon was still faintly visible in its pupil, but it wouldn't emit any unusual fluctuations, and wouldn't arouse suspicion.  The enemy would never guess how terrifying this dragon would be once unsealed.</p><p>Qin Sang now understood the power of this lightning technique and was very satisfied. With this technique, he would be much safer.</p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for bestowing this technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed deeply in gratitude towards the heavens.</p><p>The other party simply said, "You may go now."</p><p>"I'll take my leave!"</p><p>Qin Sang left the cloud sea, considering whether to visit Hong Tian, when he heard Hong Tian's voice summoning him.</p><p>He met Hong Tian in the cloud mountains.</p><p>Hong Tian got straight to the point, asking, "The Daoist disciples who entered with you have also been chosen.  Do you think they know more than you?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "Probably not! We met and cooperated once at the Heart Lake earlier. Everyone was eager to enter then; they weren't calm."</p><p>Pausing, Qin Sang asked, "Sir, are you certain about the place?"</p><p>"Absolutely certain!"</p><p>Hong Tian nodded.</p><p>Qin Sang knew what Hong Tian wanted to ask, so he said, "That place was once a battleground for various Daoist sects, but our sect wouldn't reveal the details to us younger disciples. We only know there are many opportunities there, and the sects would always battle there, but we don't know the full picture."</p><p>Hong Tian hummed, "Keep an eye on their actions."</p><p>Qin Sang replied, "Hasn't that realm been destroyed yet?"</p><p>"The changes aren't over; it's hard to say. If it still retains a connection to the original realm, you'll have a chance to gain an advantage," Hong Tian paused, "The upcoming conflict between the Water and Sky Divisions will also take place there. Prepare yourself."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of the cloud mountains, back to the battlefield, where everyone was resisting a beast tide.</p><p>The battlefield was different from before.  They no longer needed to charge recklessly; the power of the spirit array was enough to repel the beast tide.  Everyone was safely inside the array, killing the beasts from a distance.</p><p>There were exceptions, like Yuan Ren, who couldn't stand the quiet.</p><p>Wave after wave of powerful spells relentlessly harvested the beasts. Qin Sang informed Liuli and the others, then waited for the opportunity.</p><p>The spirit array continued to evolve, but they couldn't understand it anymore; they could only follow its flow.</p><p>The changes were positive, making it easier to withstand the beast tide.</p><p>Several days later, several figures descended from the sky. Two flew towards Qin Sang's group—Hong Yue and Ji Xia.</p><p>"Greetings, Master Qin," Hong Yue bowed, smiling, unlike his previous arrogance.  "We hope for your guidance."</p><p>"Don't mention it! You flatter me, Daoist Hong Yue!"</p><p>Qin Sang was struck by this. It seemed Hong Yue would also go with them. Ultimately, Hong Yue was the one Hong Tian trusted most.</p><p>Ji Xia landed beside the Yuanxiang clan leader, whispered something to him, then hopped onto Qin Sang's shoulder.  "I recommended you to the elder, but you've already been chosen by Hong Tian."</p><p>Qin Sang asked, "Did that senior choose the Yuanxiang clan leader?"</p><p>"Not necessarily," Ji Xia shook his head slightly, "It depends on their performance."</p><p>Qin Sang understood. He had wondered why no Saint Realm expert had chosen the Yuanxiang clan leader.  Among all the cultivators present, probably no one dared claim certain victory over him.</p><p>It seemed the Saint Realm experts were cautious, waiting until after the conflict between the Water and Sky Divisions to choose.</p><p>Suddenly, a majestic voice echoed from the sky.</p><p>"Everyone…"</p><p>The voice drew everyone's attention.  They knew it was a Saint Realm expert.</p><p>"Though the sacred land has changed, the trials cannot be abandoned…"</p><p>The Saint Realm expert calmly explained the situation. His words were similar to what Hong Tian had said.</p><p>Everyone listened silently. Upon learning the truth, there was an uproar; some rejoiced, some worried. The joyful were those who thought the trial was over, only to find it continued. The worried were those who knew the Saint Realm expert made it clear the trial would be even more dangerous.</p><p>Of course, they could choose not to participate, remaining to defend against the beast tide under the protection of the Saint Realm experts, but they'd miss out on the treasures.</p><p>The Saint Realm expert gave everyone time to consider. Most chose to participate; only a few, claiming insufficient strength or previous injuries, chose to stay.</p><p>'Swish swish…'</p><p>Heavenly fire rained down.</p><p>Qin Sang caught one; it was a burning-hot, dark red iron token.</p><p>"Wear these; they'll keep you clear-headed."</p><p>At the Saint Realm expert's command, everyone left the array, gathered at the edge of the Heart Lake, and then marched towards its depths.</p><p>Their goal was clear: the island where the Panlong Cave was located.  Even if there were dangers along the way, so many top experts could easily overcome them.</p><p>…</p><p>High above,</p><p>Hong Tian slowly opened his eyes, gazing down until the figures disappeared into the deep fog, as if shrouded in shadow, his perception becoming blurry.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression shifted. He looked up, his gaze profound, fixed on the heavens. There, the light was like a sea, incredibly brilliant—a beauty unseen anywhere else in the world.</p><p>Wow!</p><p>A colossal wave, seemingly containing a strange shadow, surged up within the radiant light.</p><p>"It's coming! Everyone, be careful!" Hong Tian transmitted a warning, composing himself to face the impending onslaught.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were oblivious to this.  They continued uninterrupted across the Heart Lake, reaching the island without incident.</p><p>"This is the place!"</p><p>A female cultivator from the Jiao Ren tribe, leading the group, raised her arm, signaling a halt.  This woman was a powerful queen among the Jiao Ren, reportedly a close confidante of the Jiao Ren Empress. With the Empress absent, she naturally assumed leadership of the Water Division.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Heaven Division was led by the prince of the Yu Ren King. The recent reappearance of long-vanished Yu Ren experts suggested the Yu Ren King had achieved Saint-level mastery.</p><p>This Sacred Land trial deviated from tradition; the Water and Heaven Divisions were not pitted against each other. However, years of conflict made it difficult to bridge the animosity between the two, and they remained distinctly separate, wary of one another.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Zhan Yan standing beside the Jiao Ren queen, apparently having joined her faction.</p><p>After a brief survey of the surroundings, the Jiao Ren queen conferred with Zhan Yan before leading the Water Division onto the island. The Heaven Division followed suit without hesitation.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren," Qin Sang heard a familiar voice through a mental transmission, from the Shao Shi.</p><p>"Has the Xian Tong been eliminated by you, Zhenren?"</p><p>Qin Sang's safe return fueled speculation, particularly among Shao Shi and Si Huang, who closely watched his every move.</p><p>"Why would you say such a thing, Daoist friend? I was merely fortunate to escape with my life. I must thank you for not joining forces with him to hunt me down," Qin Sang vehemently denied.</p><p>Shao Shi remained silent; this was precisely the dilemma plaguing him and Si Huang.</p><p>The Saint-level expert had revealed their next opponents would be the disciples of the ancient masters who had emerged from the Saint Realm. However, these disciples' masters were also their own ancestors, meaning they would have to oppose their own ancestral figures.</p><p>Even if they obtained treasures, would they live to enjoy them?</p><p>The Saint-level expert's explanation was that these disciples' true motives were self-serving, not genuine service to their ancestors; therefore, ancestral retribution needn't be a concern.</p><p>The crowd remained skeptical yet reluctant to abandon this opportunity, many adopting a wait-and-see attitude.</p><p>Si Huang and Shao Shi both acknowledged Qin Sang's strength, willing to renew their alliance, but the possibility of Xian Tong's survival created a difficult situation.</p><p>After waiting without a response from Shao Shi, Qin Sang understood they had abandoned the alliance. While more allies were always beneficial, Qin Sang didn't want others to overestimate his strength. Fortunately, there were no witnesses, so he wouldn't admit to anything.</p><p>Furthermore, he had numerous allies—the Yuan Xiang clan leader, Yuan Ren, and Ji Xia, all top-tier experts.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang subtly glanced towards Yuan Jian.  The man possessed remarkable audacity, not fearing retribution, daring to enter the trial.</p><p>Yuan Jian had been stirring up trouble behind the scenes. If given the chance, Qin Sang would not hesitate to eliminate him permanently!</p><p>However…</p><p>Qin Sang noticed Yuan Jian subtly aligning himself with the Yu Ren tribe. Could he have some secret advantage?</p><p>The group traversed towering mountains and deep valleys, finally reaching the sacred realm.</p><p>Perhaps guided by Zhan Yan, they arrived precisely where the disciples of the ancient masters had gathered.</p><p>Returning to this place, Qin Sang and Liuli gazed towards the sacred realm. The radiant light was far weaker than before, nearing extinction, yet the storm raged even fiercer, its howling winds a terrifying spectacle.</p><p>The disciples of the ancient masters were assembled before the sacred realm, poised to enter once the light vanished.</p><p>Sensing the approaching figures, they turned to see countless beams of light descending upon them, their expressions changing instantly.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Both sides halted simultaneously, facing each other from a distance.</p><p>"What are you lowlifes doing here! Return at once. If you disrupt the Grand Ancestor's affairs, can you bear the consequences?" a disciple of the ancient masters thundered.</p><p>This declaration caused several faces to darken; different origins seemed to create an insurmountable chasm between them, even among those of the same race.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, we meet again."</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the familiar mental transmission and followed the sound to locate Yu Zhen within the crowd.</p><p>Yu Zhen nodded. "Given the chance, Zhenren will see my sincerity."</p>
