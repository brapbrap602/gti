<h1>Chapter 824: Farewell</h1><p>The bluefin shark sank beneath the waves and vanished.</p><p>The survivors, clinging to life, took a while to believe the shark was truly gone and that they had actually lived through it.  They felt as if they were dreaming.</p><p>The two surviving cultivators were exhausted, including the middle-aged cultivator.</p><p>He had been utterly despairing, and this unexpected turn of events was almost unbelievable.</p><p>He had never heard of a demonic beast willingly abandoning prey so close at hand.</p><p>He rushed to the bow of the ship, scanning the ocean.  The shark was nowhere to be seen; there were no bubbles on the surface, and the demonic aura had completely dissipated.</p><p>Just as the middle-aged cultivator breathed a sigh of relief, he spotted several corpses drifting in the distance. His heart clenched.  He shouted to his companion, "Come with me!  We need to save them; there might still be survivors…"</p><p>The bluefin shark, having been sated by the giant sea beasts, had killed only for sport; it showed no interest in the corpses.</p><p>Fearing the shark’s return, the two cautiously descended from the ship, flying as quickly as possible toward the bodies to check for signs of life.</p><p>Of the three cultivators, they found only two corpses.  The third had been struck by the shark's water jet and shattered; there was no chance of survival.</p><p>"Senior, Zhang Yue isn't dead!"</p><p>Another cultivator shouted joyfully, holding a young boy.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator quickly flew over. The boy indeed showed faint signs of life, though he was unconscious.  Their risky decision to check the bodies had saved the boy’s life.</p><p>The two quickly searched the area. Besides Zhang Yue, only one crewman survived—he had fallen overboard during the ship's violent shaking.</p><p>After rescuing the two, they returned to the ship.</p><p>The ship's captain was distraught. They had not only lost many crew and sea beasts but also two cultivators; most of the ship's cargo had been lost during the chase.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator comforted the captain, ordering him to turn the ship back to the city. Then he hurried into the cabin to examine Zhang Yue's injuries.</p><p>"Senior Wang, I’ve given Zhang Yue the Huqi Dan as you instructed, but he still hasn't woken up,"</p><p>His companion, attending to Zhang Yue, anxiously explained as the middle-aged cultivator entered.</p><p>The middle-aged man placed his hand on Zhang Yue’s forehead, carefully examining him before saying thoughtfully, "His vital energy has stabilized, and his wounds have healed. He should have awakened by now.  It's possible his spirit is injured…"</p><p>"His spirit?"</p><p>His companion gasped.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator nodded and sighed, "Spirit injuries are the most difficult to treat. I don't have the right medicine. Let him rest here for a while.  When we return to the island, we'll ask the island's senior cultivators for help."</p><p>After further discussion, they gently closed the door and went out to deal with the aftermath.</p><p>Shortly after they left, a figure suddenly appeared in the room, solidifying from nothingness—Qin Sang.</p><p>He had boarded the ship with the two cultivators and remained hidden in the room; his cultivation was far beyond theirs, making detection impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang raised his hand, and Zhang Yue sat up straight. Qin Sang sat opposite him, activating the demonic seed within the boy to accelerate the cultivation of his nascent soul.</p><p>The fusion of the seed and the boy would take some time; initial fusion would allow him to ‘awaken’ and function normally.</p><p>Qin Sang had learned about the crew's origins; they were from a small island named Lu Island, where the highest cultivation level was Foundation Establishment. They could not possibly detect his disguise.</p><p>All the cultivators, including the boy, were independent practitioners who had stumbled upon the path of cultivation; they lacked the backing of powerful factions or sects.</p><p>This was why Qin Sang had stayed behind.</p><p>The boy's background was 'clean'; Qin Sang intended to preserve this identity, as it might prove useful later.</p><p>The ship turned back.</p><p>The dragon's head at the bow, shattered by the bluefin shark, made the ship look dilapidated.</p><p>The journey out had been filled with high spirits; the return was fraught with gloom.</p><p>After seven or eight days, they were nearing Lu Island.</p><p>That day, the middle-aged cultivator was surprised to find Zhang Yue awake, acting and speaking normally, his injuries completely healed.</p><p>"After we land, have the island's senior cultivators examine your spirit. Don't be careless,"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator examined him again, still uneasy, and gave him a careful warning.</p><p>Zhang Yue shook his head and said wryly, "I should be fine; there's no need for that. Besides, my magic tools were destroyed in the fight, and the spirit stones I have left only cover the cost of defensive tools. I can't possibly afford to ask those seniors for help."</p><p>"I see…"</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator understood the struggles of low-level cultivators; he felt empathy. He could only say, "Then be careful. If you notice anything unusual, seek medical attention."</p><p>As they spoke, the ship reached the shore. Zhang Yue bid farewell to his companions and flew home.</p><p>Qin Sang learned that Zhang Yue had family, elderly parents, and several siblings, but he alone possessed a spiritual root and became a cultivator.</p><p>Zhang Yue was only at the Qi Condensation stage during his lifetime, considered the lowest level in the cultivation world.  However, being a cultivator, protecting a few ordinary people was easy for him, and his family lived comfortably thanks to his support.</p><p>It's easy to imagine that after Zhang Yue's death, the Zhang family would quickly decline if there were no successors, but Qin Sang intervened.</p><p>Upon returning home, Zhang Yue was treated with a mixture of respect and awe by his family.</p><p>After dinner, Zhang Yue went to his parents' room, explaining his intention to seek immortality on Sheng Island.</p><p>Sheng Island, also known as Tianxing Island, is named after the Four Sacred Mountains on the island.  All humans, cultivators and ordinary people alike, have heard of Sheng Island's existence. Most ordinary people will never see it in their lifetime, as it seems to exist only in legends.</p><p>"This sea journey, escaping death, made me realize how insignificant I am. A small monster could easily kill me.  Being stuck here, I'll never achieve greatness, at most, I'll live a few decades longer than my brothers. I want to go to Sheng Island; there are immortals there, and I might be able to become a disciple…"</p><p>Zhang Yue stated his reasons.  He had told a middle-aged cultivator this, who guessed his change of heart stemmed from a great upheaval, and advised him to reconsider.</p><p>His parents, though reluctant, didn't know how to stop him and could only watch him leave with tears in their eyes.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Sang gave Zhang Yue some spirit stones for his parents' health, and left them some basic cultivation techniques, in case a descendant with a spiritual root appeared.</p><p>That night, Zhang Yue bid farewell to his parents and friends.</p><p>Qin Sang, with his external avatar, quietly left the island and began his journey home.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang practiced the secret technique from the *Seed of the Devil Embryo*, refining this body. Once the devil seed and the body fully merged, forming the primordial embryo, the next step, blood cultivation, could begin.</p><p>After a long journey, he finally returned to Tianxing Island.</p><p>The turmoil in the Liefeng Islands didn't seem to have affected this place.</p><p>Tianxing City remained unchanged.</p><p>Entering the city, Qin Sang left his external avatar in his cave dwelling, rested briefly, and headed towards the Xiang'an Auction House.</p>
