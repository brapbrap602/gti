Chapter 1329: The Soul Infant Grand Formation

The Jade Skeleton, fearless and unyielding, madly charged at the seal.

*Boom!*

The stone pillar cracked and shattered.

Ye Laomo decisively retreated backward.

The power of the seal became extremely chaotic, and the two soul flames in the Jade Skeleton's eyes flickered more violently.

*Boom!*

Finally, the Jade Skeleton forcibly broke through the seal!

"Hahaha..."

The Jade Skeleton let out a bone-chilling, maniacal laugh.

Ye Laomo looked up at the frenzied demon, his eyes flickering with uncertainty.

Just then, the Jade Skeleton's laughter suddenly ceased, replaced by a furious curse. It then collapsed heavily onto the stone path.

Only then did Ye Laomo notice that even the Jade Skeleton, as hard as jade, had its bones shattered inch by inch. The power of the seal was evident, and it was no wonder the demon had insisted on obtaining the Jade Skeleton.

*Crack... Crack...*

The Jade Skeleton's body twisted grotesquely, its skin gradually restoring itself, inflating like a balloon at a visible speed, slowly regaining a humanoid form.

The shattered bones reconnected one by one, and the Jade Skeleton twisted itself upright, standing up from the ground.

The demon's current state was peculiar, something even the well-traveled Ye Laomo had never seen before.

It had no flesh or blood, but its bones, skin, and meridians were intact.

Through its translucent skin, one could clearly see its skeletal frame and dried-up meridians.

What should have been a desiccated corpse had now come to life.

Soul flames flickered in its hollow eye sockets as the Jade Skeleton twisted its neck to face Ye Laomo.

Ye Laomo felt as if he were being watched, and he instinctively took a step back, remaining on guard.

"Hmph!"

The Jade Skeleton let out a cold snort, its tone filled with dissatisfaction. "If you had released me earlier, things wouldn't have come to this! Now, I don't have enough time to fully control this body, and my strength will inevitably be affected!"

Ye Laomo's expression remained unchanged. He stared at the Jade Skeleton, sensing its unfathomable depth, and his wariness grew.

Narrowing his eyes, he said calmly, "According to your earlier words, your current strength should be sufficient. Were you lying to me?"

The Jade Skeleton let out a strange laugh. "You're truly suspicious. Although you've offended me many times, it was also you who freed me from that endless seal. Compared to that, those offenses are trivial. Bringing you along is but a small effort for me, with no real impact. Why would I risk backlash by breaking my oath?"

Ye Laomo's eyes flickered. "Is that so? It's good that you understand my difficulties. The reason I've survived this long is because I'm cautious enough."

The Jade Skeleton laughed heartily. "Good! Good! People like you do tend to live longer! To have reached this point, even in my era, you would be considered a remarkable figure! Hand over the Soul Infant Grand Formation!"

The Soul Infant Grand Formation consisted of crystal orbs that sealed Nascent Souls. The Ghost Crystal Tower had long absorbed blood and evil spirits on the battlefield, fusing them with Nascent Souls to create an extremely sinister artifact.

Ye Laomo waved his hand, sending the Soul Infant Grand Formation toward the Jade Skeleton. He had personally refined the formation, so he wasn't worried about losing control over it.

*Whoosh!*

The Jade Skeleton formed a hand seal, and the Soul Infant Grand Formation began to spin rapidly before it, emitting a thick, bloody aura. Waves of blood energy spread from the crystal orbs, and in the blink of an eye, the entire formation turned into a cloud of blood, from which eerie ghostly wails echoed.

Within the blood cloud, the Nascent Souls flickered in and out of sight, completely corrupted like other evil spirits, assimilated by the blood energy.

The Jade Skeleton made no effort to hide its actions from Ye Laomo. In its hands, the Soul Infant Grand Formation exuded a sinister and malevolent aura.

It was refining the Soul Infant Grand Formation, completing the final step as per its agreement with Ye Laomo.

In the end, the two of them would join forces to fully refine the formation!

"Once the Soul Infant Grand Formation is complete, we'll need to activate it together. For now, I'll leave it with you..."

The Jade Skeleton returned the refined formation to Ye Laomo, then suddenly paused, looking into the distance. The soul flames in its eye sockets flickered. "The Immortal Gate is about to open. Let's go! If you don't want to miss this opportunity, you must follow my instructions from now on! If you ruin my plans, you know the consequences!"

Feeling the oppressive aura emanating from the Jade Skeleton, Ye Laomo showed no fear, meeting its gaze calmly. "You probably can't understand the suffering of cultivators in this era. Even if there's only a one in ten thousand chance, I'll choose to believe you this time. This is the only opportunity in my lifetime, and I know exactly what to do!"

The Jade Skeleton said indifferently, "Is it because every change in the Purple Palace has been predicted by me that you dare to trust me? But soon, you'll know that your choice was the right one!"

The two of them dashed out of the stone path.

As the Jade Skeleton reconnected its bones, it surveyed its surroundings.

It felt as if an eternity had passed!

Seeing clearly the prison that had confined it for countless years, the soul flames in its eyes flared brightly, radiating intense hatred.

But then, a thought struck it, and it fell into confusion. How many of its ancient enemies who had imprisoned it were still alive?

The Jade Skeleton noticed Ye Laomo busily moving through layers of ancient restrictions and guessed his intentions. It sneered, "Unnecessary."

But it didn't stop him.

...

The Abyssal Ruins, Sea of Mist.

The group stayed away from the vortex, their faces a mix of anticipation and vigilance as they stared into its depths.

The turbulent currents surged like tidal waves, and a deafening roar echoed. A strange fluctuation appeared.

Faintly, they saw the shadow of a massive gate, with overwhelming force tearing through countless chaotic currents, emerging from the vortex!

Qin Sang and the others were witnessing such a grand spectacle for the first time.

The towering gate, even more majestic than the remnants of the Purple Palace, bore a crimson character for "Sin" that exuded a terrifying killing intent, striking at their hearts and shaking their souls!

"Let's go!"

Canghong Zhenren took the lead, charging toward the Immortal Gate. The others quickly suppressed their awe and followed closely.

*Boom!*

The Immortal Gate trembled violently, opening a crack. The group didn't rush in immediately, instead forming a defensive formation outside the gate.

After a while, the gate's tremors grew more intense, and the crack widened, but there was no movement from within.

Exchanging glances, they filed in one by one.

What greeted them was a scene of ruins!

Confirming that Ye Laomo wasn't here, Qin Sang surveyed the surroundings.

Unlike the inner halls of the Purple Palace, this place was incredibly dark and oppressive.

Thick leaden clouds hung low in the sky, covering the entire field of vision, endless and suffocating.

Deep within the clouds, thin streaks of lightning occasionally flashed, providing the only faint light in this space.

Though the lightning appeared slender, the fluctuations it emitted were extraordinary.

One such streak appeared not far from them.

In that instant, Qin Sang's mind tensed, his hair standing on end, his body nearly trembling with a sense of insignificance.

If that lightning had been aimed at him, he would have been obliterated on the spot.

The others fared no better.

Even Jingyu, who was naturally adept at controlling lightning, turned pale, nearly revealing his true form.

The group was thrown into disarray.

Just stepping into the Palace of Sin had given them a harsh warning.

The Purple Palace had its share of dangerous ancient restrictions, but they were well-hidden. Unless provoked, they rarely revealed themselves.
