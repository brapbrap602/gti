<h1>Chapter 1648: Shifting Mountains, Changing Positions</h1><p>Chapter 1648: Shifting Mountains, Changing Positions</p><p>This token is the last of the Five Element Tokens—the Fire Token.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes took out the Fire Token and ascended the steps.  After traveling for some time, a mountain gate came into view.  It was a similarly tall jade gate, but the inscription read “Attaining Enlightenment Again.”</p><p>The female Daoist stared at the inscription, puzzled.  Why would Buddhist terminology be carved here?</p><p>“Di Shou Mountain holds the highest status within the Wu Xiang Sect. It began as the ancestral shrine, later evolving into various uses, mostly symbolic.  All things in the world change with time, and the heavens themselves are ever-shifting.  Of all the myriad practices, few in this age achieve the level of Divine Transformation.  It is said these jade gates commemorate ancestors of the Wu Xiang Sect who dared to explore new methods and diligently pursued cultivation.  Each possessed the potential to found their own school!  Having mastered these new methods and achieved Divine Transformation, they opened new paths for future generations, thus leaving behind a stairway and a jade gate on Di Shou Mountain…”</p><p>The Daoist in white robes examined the four characters, “Attaining Enlightenment Again.”</p><p>Undeniably, this commemorated an ancestor who cultivated Buddhist practices. However, “Enlightenment” held profound meaning in Buddhism; using it here was certainly an exaggeration, even presumptuous.</p><p>Of course, the Wu Xiang Sect didn't care about outsiders' criticism.</p><p>“Did this ancestor perhaps fall from Divine Transformation, or perhaps switch to Buddhist cultivation, and then re-attain Divine Transformation?”</p><p>The Daoist in white robes didn't dwell on it, focusing instead on the misty sea beyond the jade gate. He gestured for the female Daoist to approach and follow him through the gate.</p><p>They encountered the same situation as Qin Sang.</p><p>A wave of mist surged forth.  The Fire Token glowed red, enveloping them both, guiding them to a jade pavilion.</p><p>The pavilion was entirely made of a spiritual jade, without any runes or inscriptions, utterly pure.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes shook the Fire Token.  The pavilion remained unchanged, its door firmly shut. He looked at the token again.</p><p>The token had led them to the pavilion, yet had no effect.</p><p>The female Daoist was surprised.  “This isn't the key to open the pavilion?”</p><p>“Wu Xiang Sect masters activated a grand formation, sealing themselves within the mountain. These tokens were forged at that time, five in total, one for each element. Since it's not reacting, it’s likely that after ten thousand years, those Wu Xiang Sect masters have already passed away, and no one is there to receive us. However, this has its advantages.  The formation, without anyone to operate it, will only run according to its own inherent patterns. With the Fire Token, we needn't fear being destroyed by the formation; we can gradually decipher its patterns,” the Daoist in white robes stroked his beard, pondering as he examined the pavilion's door.</p><p>Then, he gestured for the female Daoist to retreat three meters, and with a flick of his wrist, his Chi Huo Sword flew out.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A crimson sword-shadow pierced directly toward the pavilion's door.</p><p>When the spiritual sword struck, there was no sound of impact, but a red aura erupted, instantly sweeping toward them.  The sound wasn’t loud, but the aura contained astonishing power.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes' expression turned serious. Without hesitation, he held the Fire Token before his chest.</p><p>*Pfft!*</p><p>Upon contact with the Fire Token, the aura silently dissipated.</p><p>Seeing this, the Daoist in white robes relaxed slightly and continued to strike the jade door, one sword strike after another.</p><p>Watching his actions, the female Daoist grew increasingly puzzled.  She knew her senior brother's skill; his swordsmanship shouldn't be so light and his strikes were getting slower and slower.</p><p>She didn't see that as he struck, the Daoist in white robes' eyes shone with a strange light as he seemed to be analyzing something.</p><p>After some time, the Daoist in white robes finally understood, let out a hearty laugh, retrieved the Chi Huo Sword, and ran his fingers along the blade, the entire length of it.</p><p>Where his fingers passed, a great red fire blazed, the sword singing.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The Daoist in white robes pointed at a specific spot on the pavilion's door.</p><p>The next moment, sword energy surged like a rainbow.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>An unprecedentedly brilliant aura suddenly erupted. While it was dispersed by the Fire Token before reaching them, the remaining ripples surged into the depths of the mist, stirring up a thousand waves.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes moved like lightning, Fire Token in hand, pressing it into the center of the erupting aura.  He met no resistance and pushed it right into the door!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The jade pavilion trembled slightly.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes retreated, and looked again at the pavilion.  A token was now visible on it, having moved itself to the lintel of the pavilion door.</p><p>The Fire Token merged with the pavilion, becoming one with it!</p><p>With a creak, the tightly shut pavilion door opened a tiny crack.</p><p>The two exchanged a look.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes used his sword to push open the door. He found no resistance and pushed it open effortlessly.  Unexpectedly, it revealed a pitch-black void beyond.</p><p>The grand formation was interconnected.</p><p>The female Daoist dared not move, watching the Daoist in white robes.</p><p>The Daoist in white robes took a step into the pavilion. The female Daoist quickly followed, but the Daoist in white robes suddenly froze, as if sensing something, his expression changing abruptly.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang had already entered the pavilion.</p><p>Like the Daoist in white robes, he was using the protective effects of the Wood Token to continuously probe the changes in the pavilion's prohibitions.</p><p>He didn't know the secret of Emperor-bestowed Mountain, but through the Wood token, he sensed the changes in the restriction.  Combined with his experience in restrictions and the assistance of the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he discovered the mystery.  Using the Wood token, he opened the Jade Pavilion's door, entering before the two disciples from Jade Terrace Sect.</p><p>However, the scene inside the Jade Pavilion greatly exceeded his expectations.</p><p>From the outside, the Jade Pavilion wasn't large.</p><p>But behind the door wasn't a hall, but a void space.</p><p>Qin Sang felt like he was drifting in the void; this space seemed boundless. The space was silent, devoid of sound and any substantial object.</p><p>The only thing he could sense was the entrance to the space, the Jade Pavilion door, which remained in one position.</p><p>Assured he could return anytime, Qin Sang boldly explored. Using the Jade Pavilion door as a landmark, he headed straight for the deepest part of the space, experiencing the spatial changes during his journey.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang gained some understanding.</p><p>He was certain this wasn't a real space, but one formed by an array. While he seemed to be moving within the space, he was actually being constantly shifted by the restriction, hence his inability to reach the exit.</p><p>The spirit array used this method to prevent people from entering Emperor-bestowed Mountain.</p><p>If someone guided him, he could easily find his way out. Now, he could only rely on himself to find the pattern.</p><p>But, once he found the key, he would have a way to break it.</p><p>For Qin Sang, this wasn't difficult, it would just take some time.</p><p>…</p><p>"Time flies."</p><p>Before a jade gate.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, Su Zi Nan, Mo Xing Dao, and Fan Lao Mo arrived, looking at the inscription on the jade gate. Su Zi Nan softly recited it, not understanding its meaning.</p><p>The phrase describes the alternation of day and night; its meaning here is unclear.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo hovered outside, making his own markings. Seeing the conspicuous white jade steps behind the jade gate leading directly into the mist, he grumbled, "Brother Zhu, it's clearly a clear path behind the gate. Are you exaggerating, trying to frighten us?"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao smiled, "Without the Five Tokens, the jade steps are real. With the Five Tokens, you'll know it's an illusion! Senior Brother, if you don't believe me, you can try going in."</p><p>Though suspicious, Fan Lao Mo wouldn't fall for it. He snorted, "In that case, let's not rush in.  I'll wait for my reinforcements to arrive before entering the mountain together."</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao sighed helplessly, "I haven't told a single lie.  Senior Brother, guiding them here is enough. Once we break the array, shift the mountain, and reveal the path, they will catch up quickly.  Senior Brother, don't forget, two groups are already ahead of us, including Old Daoist Zi Lei!"</p><p>A glint flashed in Su Zi Nan's eyes, feigning confusion, "We're already here; why the mystery, Elder Fan? I wonder who those two friends are. If they caused the anomaly at the Fire Phase Hall, it's unlikely they'll easily get away; we can't just wait here."</p><p>Fan Lao Mo's serious demeanor throughout the journey didn't seem fake.</p><p>Yet his reinforcements were late in arriving.</p><p>Su Zi Nan probed several times, eager to discover their identities.</p><p>"Hehe, once they arrive, Daoist Su will know. Rest assured, their cultivation is no less than ours; a mere damaged array can't trap them."</p><p>Fan Lao Mo knew Zhu Wu Dao had gathered many experts.</p><p>Among those who entered the mountain, besides Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao, there was also the Weeping Spirit Cave Master, meaning at least five grand cultivators were on Zhu Wu Dao's side.</p><p>The Daoist sect also had three grand cultivators.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo felt outnumbered and preferred to bring in the Poison King and Master Huai Yin to muddy the waters.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, mist surged from the west side of Emperor-bestowed Mountain, with spiritual light flashing.</p><p>Such phenomena were common on Emperor-bestowed Mountain. Su Zi Nan and the other two glanced casually without paying much attention. Only Zhu Wu Dao's expression changed; he muttered under his breath after making a calculation.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Su Zi Nan asked curiously.</p><p>"Someone else has entered the mountain, and they possess a Five Token!" Zhu Wu Dao's expression was grave, yet undetected was a flash of delight in his eyes.</p><p>"The Earth Token is with the Daoist sect, and the Weeping Spirit Cave Master has the Wood Token.  The Water and Fire Tokens haven't appeared yet," Su Zi Nan mused.</p><p>Only he knew that he possessed the Water Token!</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao shook his head, "It's not the Water Token! Judging by the array, it should correspond to the Fire Token!"</p><p>His understanding of Emperor-bestowed Mountain far surpassed others; he could deduce some of the array's patterns from outside.</p><p>"The Fire inheritor!"</p><p>Su Zi Nan and Mo Xing Dao exchanged glances, simultaneously thinking of the Fire Demon.</p><p>They had already suspected, and now they were certain.</p><p>Su Zi Nan wasn't sure whether the Fire Rhinoceros had been taken by the Fire inheritor or had fallen into the hands of Fan Lao Mo's reinforcements.</p><p>However, it was certain that the Ice Instrument Divine Disk was in the Fire Demon's possession!</p><p>"Senior Brother Fan, are you sure you want to wait any longer?" Zhu Wu Dao frowned at Fan Lao Mo.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo sneered inwardly. But seeing Zhu Wu Dao's genuine expression, he hesitated. Three groups had already entered the mountain, including descendants of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect; waiting any longer, the opportunity might be lost.</p><p>Seeing his hesitation, Su Zinan cursed the old demon inwardly for his indecisiveness, wondering why Zhu Wu Dao insisted on bringing him along.  He regretted not leaving them and acting alone.</p><p>Finally, Old Demon Fan nodded. The four of them entered in succession, arriving before the Jade Pavilions.</p><p>Three Jade Pavilions stood there, identical in appearance.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's approach differed from Qin Sang's.</p><p>He stood directly in front of a pavilion's entrance. Initially, he probed, but instead of merging his Golden Talisman with the pavilion, he explored it before ordering Su Zinan and the others to attack.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao controlled the Golden Talisman; others couldn't precisely sense the pavilion's formation changes, so they obeyed.</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao stood to Zhu Wu Dao's left, Old Demon Fan to his right.</p><p>The four unleashed their powers.</p><p>Guided by Zhu Wu Dao, their treasures and techniques bombarded the pavilion.  Strange lights flickered frequently.  At first, the pavilion remained unmoved, but under the continuous assault of the four powerful cultivators, its tremors intensified.</p><p>The Golden Talisman blocked the pavilion's aura, shielding them from backlash, allowing them to attack freely.</p><p>However, Su Zinan and the others were shrewd.  Seeing Zhu Wu Dao's relentless attacks, they grew suspicious of his motives.</p><p>"Junior Brother Zhu,"  Old Demon Fan said, his eyes narrowed, his magical weapon's power noticeably diminishing, "We four powerful cultivators can barely shake the pavilion.  Among the other groups, only the Daoists might be stronger; everyone else will likely be delayed.  Why worry about being overtaken?"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao remained impassive, raising the Golden Talisman.  "Indeed, Senior Brother, you've seen through me! There's another way.  The Five Talismans can open the pavilion, allowing us to explore the formations within and find the correct path. They're surely using this method. But we're behind.  Proceeding methodically will leave us lagging.  My way – destroying the pavilion – seems rash, but it eliminates many complications and allows direct access to the mountain!"</p><p>Su Zinan frowned. "Friend Zhu, Mount Di is where the Five Talismans converge, the master's legacy. We feel the power of the formations even from down here.  Are you sure we can destroy the pavilion by force?"</p><p>"Rest assured, friend. I wouldn't do this without certainty.  A million years ago, or if the formation were actively controlled, it would be impossible.  But the  Unseen Immortal Sect has been sealed for a millennium. The earth's energy has shifted, creating an opportunity. Furthermore, the more Five Talismans we gather, the better for us. You see, the pavilion is already weakening," Zhu Wu Dao said confidently.</p><p>As he spoke, the pavilion trembled violently.</p><p>Seeing this, they redoubled their efforts.</p><p>While they attacked the pavilion…</p><p>The Poison King, Master Huaiyin, and Qin Sang's incarnation arrived at Mount Di.</p><p>The incarnation found his master's mark and waited.</p><p>Knowing the dangers of the formation beyond the gate, the incarnation meditated, taking out the lotus platform and examining it. The Wish-Fulfilling Pearl was the perfect size, fitting snugly.</p><p>Whether the two were a set, however, only his master could determine.</p><p>"The Wish-Fulfilling Pearl is a defensive treasure.  Will combining it with the platform enhance the protective barrier?"</p><p>The incarnation mused, probing the platform with his divine sense, but found no spiritual energy. It wasn't a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The Poison King and Master Huaiyin were also blocked.</p><p>"Old Demon Fan told us to wait and cooperate to obtain the Nascent Soul opportunity. When did this old demon become so kind, sharing opportunities with outsiders? Is he being secretive, or has he encountered an opponent and wants to divert attention?" The Poison King found Old Demon Fan's mark and sneered.</p><p>Their agreement with Old Demon Fan had little binding power.</p><p>Master Huaiyin gazed at the sea of mist. "This place isn't to be taken lightly."</p><p>"Fine," the Poison King looked around.  He'd just subdued his poison, and was in a good mood. He decided to trust Old Demon Fan and wait.</p><p>He flicked his sleeve; a black light, tinged with faint red, shot out – quite eerie.</p><p>He pricked his finger, letting a drop of blood merge into the black light, instantly consumed.</p><p>The Poison King's face turned pale, as if he'd paid a heavy price.  Despite their beauty, they looked rather pitiful.</p><p>The black light writhed, then turned toward the mountain, emitting a hiss.</p><p>"That person's inside!"  The Poison King said coldly.</p>
