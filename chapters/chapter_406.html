Chapter 399:  The Xuan Frost Killing Wind


Reaching the ice wall, Qin Sang observed the outside.


As far as the eye could see, the gale whipped up swirling snow, forming a white blizzard that ravaged the land.  
Endless wind and snow never ceased.
The ice wall was battered by the snow, cracking and popping, yet remained unshaken.


The scene was strangely "calm,"  a calmness only a cultivator could perceive.  There were no signs of chaotic spiritual energy, no ancient prohibitions, no monstrous beasts…


On the surface, it didn't seem as dangerous as Yun Youzi had guessed.


After all, Yun Youzi's judgment was based on the flying night yaksha guarding the prohibition, but the flying night yaksha wasn't originally there; it was Wu Shang transformed.


Even the flying horned dragons might have migrated here later, making their home in the dark pool.


Originally, finding the right path should have allowed easy entry.


Qin Sang was curious about what lay beyond the ice wall. Wu Shang's letter mentioned the Nightfall Lily.


Legend said the Nightfall Lily originally grew here, discovered by an elder cultivator. The prohibitions and teleportation arrays in the ice palace were all left by that elder.


Wu Shang intended to guide future cultivators to harvest the Nightfall Lily, increasing their chances of completing the pill formation secret technique he left behind.


Qin Sang had the mystical jade Buddha; he didn't need the Nightfall Lily, and he wouldn't steal the herb Yun Youzi desperately needed.


He wondered if there were other herbs besides the Nightfall Lily inside.


After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang made his decision.  He suddenly summoned the Ten Directions Yama Formation, then grasped his magic weapon, prepared himself, and even summoned the Five Elements Breaking Spell Sword to break the prohibition on the ice wall.


If not for being forced in by Yu Hua, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't have taken the risk.


Now that he was inside, and especially with a magic weapon and boosted strength, as long as he was careful, taking a quick look shouldn't be a problem.


Qin Sang didn't necessarily need to obtain any treasure. Finding something would be fortunate, but not finding anything was fine too; if the path ahead proved truly dangerous, he could simply retreat.


He moved cautiously, slowly opening the prohibition and silently leaving the ice palace.


The blizzard instantly struck him.  Qin Sang, prepared as he was, used his spiritual energy to protect himself, but still couldn't help but shiver, his expression slightly changing.


This was no ordinary wind and snow.  It carried a chilling aura, far more terrifying than the blood miasma at the entrance of the Wuyaya Valley!


Qin Sang took out his jade pendant, activating the Qingyang Demon Fire within to dispel the chill.


Immediately receiving this harsh welcome, Qin Sang became extremely vigilant, observing his surroundings.


Once inside, Qin Sang discovered this wasn't a vast expanse of ice fields as he had imagined. It too was within an ice cave, only this cave was incredibly large.  He walked a considerable distance before he could barely see the opposite ice wall.


The ice palace he'd been in was in an inconspicuous corner beneath the ice wall, completely invisible from the outside. The prohibition on the ice wall not only resisted the blizzard but also served as a concealment.


A cold wind blew in constantly from the right.


The entrance to the ice cave seemed to be there.


But ahead, everything was shrouded in chaos; boundless white snow filled his vision, and even the spiritual energy in the distance seemed somewhat disordered.


Qin Sang retreated back to the ice wall behind him, carefully moving along it, like swimming upstream in a great river, feeling an immense resistance.


He moved slowly, concealing his aura, probing his way forward, ready to retreat at the slightest sign of anything unusual.


The gale howled, growing fiercer the further he went, swirling around Qin Sang's flickering Qingyang Demon Fire.


Qin Sang discovered another terrifying aspect of the cold wind: it not only carried a chill that could freeze a cultivator's body, but that chill could actually invade the cultivator's primordial spirit!


And the Qingyang Demon Fire was useless against this invasion.


This wind was definitely not naturally formed!


Qin Sang pondered, recalling something similar he’d read in an ancient text.


There was a divine wind called the Xuan Frost Killing Wind.


Wherever the Xuan Frost Killing Wind existed, it was a place of extreme cold and yin, an absolute death trap for cultivators. The most terrifying aspect of the Xuan Frost Killing Wind was its ability to directly invade a cultivator's primordial spirit; this attack was incredibly strange and difficult to withstand.


If one's cultivation was insufficient, and they lacked a protective artifact to resist the Xuan Frost Killing Wind, their body and primordial spirit would be frozen solid from the inside out, then blown to dust!


Qin Sang's primordial spirit was safe and sound, thanks to the protection of the jade Buddha.


However, Qin Sang wasn't facing the true Xuan Frost Killing Wind, only a cold wind affected by it.


Otherwise, even if the jade Buddha could protect his primordial spirit, the Qingyang Demon Fire would have been extinguished long ago, and his body wouldn't have been able to withstand the Xuan Frost Killing Wind's assault; he would have been frozen into an ice lump.


*Crack!*

A sharp sound echoed as the jade pendant shattered, dispersing the Qingyang demonic fire. The pendant was destroyed.

Qin Sang felt a chill run down her spine, quickly producing another jade pendant. This one lasted even less time.

Then, a sudden inspiration struck Qin Sang. She frantically searched her bag and pulled out an item—the red inner core she’d obtained after killing Kong Xin.

Yun Youzi had chosen the most valuable Blue Light Sword; the red inner core and other items went to Qin Sang.  The inner core was highly unstable, useless for refining tools.  It was essentially a larger version of a warming pearl, good only for warmth, and Qin Sang had put it away, forgetting about it.

Now, it proved useful.

The red inner core was the inner core of a Sky Flame Jiao, transformed and containing the demonic fire of a nascent-stage demonic beast. Its power far surpassed the Qingyang demonic fire sealed within the jade pendant.  The best jade pendants available were crafted by Qingyang Demon Sect Foundation Establishment cultivators, containing only a wisp of demonic fire—no comparison to the inner core.

Holding the red inner core, a warm feeling flowed into her body, effectively blocking the biting wind.

However, even the inner core couldn't stop the chilling invasion of her spirit.

Did Yun Youzi have a way to protect his spirit?

Qin Sang's expression turned serious.

Yun Youzi was still nowhere to be seen; he might be ahead. The closer they got to the true Xuan Frost Gale, the more terrifying the cold would become. Yun Youzi already had a hidden injury to his spirit; without protection, he could only endure it.

Even without other dangers, how far could he go?  Yun Youzi had entered earlier than her, and she'd had a battle and rested in the ice palace for a time.  After so long, with no sign of Yun Youzi returning...

Just as Qin Sang was about to speed up, a tremor shook the ground. The entire ice cave vibrated violently, like an earthquake.

A furious blizzard raged, accompanied by deafening roars echoing through the cave.

Qin Sang steadied herself, her face pale.

The tremors originated from ahead. Though brief, it was an ominous sign.

If some ancient beast blocked their path, Yun Youzi would face both the Xuan Frost Gale and the beast—two terrible foes!

Qin Sang summoned her ebony sword, secretly activating the Ten Directions Yama Formation.  She pushed off the ground, accelerating forward against the wind.
