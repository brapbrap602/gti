<h1>Chapter 1979:  Endless Corpse Walk</h1><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu was pierced by a sword and driven into the earth.</p><p>Qin Sang's Dharma body appeared gracefully above the lava, sensing the situation underground.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Old Ancestor Ming Hu couldn't be killed so easily with a single strike.</p><p>The Grey Sparrow Sword, having advanced to a spiritual treasure and wielded by a Nascent Soul cultivator, naturally possessed immense power.</p><p>It was unclear whether Old Ancestor Ming Hu used some treasure, but to onlookers, it seemed he merely used his bare hands to grip the blade, directly receiving the blow.</p><p>Even with the Everbright Lamp weakening the sword's momentum, it was still astonishing.</p><p>It was certain that Old Ancestor Ming Hu was also in the early Nascent Soul stage, a similar realm to Qin Sang.</p><p>However, Old Ancestor Ming Hu's Nascent Soul cultivation must have begun much earlier, resulting in a much deeper foundation.</p><p>Ancestor Ming Hu's cultivation path differed from the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*; he didn't cultivate a Dharma image, instead purely refining his physical body to this extent.</p><p>A true corpse path expert, demonstrating the might of the unyielding bones!</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, without hesitation immediately performing a sword formula, causing the wind and clouds to change color.</p><p>The world's spiritual energy went into chaos, a spiritual tide forming a visible hurricane.</p><p>In the void, countless grey wisps danced wildly, sweeping across the heavens and earth, sharp as swords, creating a terrifying scene.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>These wisps were strikingly similar to sword energy.</p><p>Qin Sang drew all the spiritual energy of this place into his control, transforming it into countless swords that crisscrossed the sky, a breathtaking spectacle.</p><p>The void seemed to be split into fragments by a rain of swords.</p><p>The ‘swords’ swept across the ground, shattering the earth, and the lava lake continued to expand outwards.</p><p>The lava in the lake, meanwhile, had already risen into towering waves.</p><p>Fortunately, the Three Corpse Demons of the Soul-Falling Abyss were clever enough to flee the battlefield.</p><p>Had they been caught in the sword rain, their bodies would likely have been shattered like the earth itself.</p><p>A fierce light flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The sword rain aimed at the earth.</p><p>Countless sword shadows stood in the void, forming a forest of swords. At the command of their master, ten thousand swords moved at once.</p><p>And Qin Sang, amidst ten thousand swords, was the master!</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>Swords rained down.</p><p>The sword shadows were almost invisible; only a black torrent could be seen pouring down from the heavens, its sharpness overwhelming, seemingly intent on piercing the earth.</p><p>Rock could not withstand it, let alone the thin layer of lava.</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu, who had been struck into the ground by the Grey Sparrow Sword, was still falling. His body relentlessly burrowed through the earth.</p><p>A strange crimson glow appeared in Old Ancestor Ming Hu's eyes, fierce and menacing.  As he felt the sword's momentum weakening and was preparing to counterattack, he suddenly felt a new sense of crisis.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Dozens of sword shadows pierced the earth's crust, arriving in an instant.</p><p>These sword shadows seemed to merge with the Grey Sparrow Sword, or perhaps be absorbed by it, amplifying its power.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu had no time to react, feeling a violent blow. His arm throbbed, his whole body shook, and his barely recovered breath became violently agitated again.</p><p>His body fell at an even faster speed, gouging a bottomless hole in the earth.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The sword shadows were like falling thunderbolts, striking Old Ancestor Ming Hu continuously.</p><p>These sword shadows were even more dangerous than thunderbolts.  They not only possessed terrifying power but each also carried an extremely sharp energy, attempting to pierce his flesh.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu kept falling, unable to stop his descent no matter what he tried.</p><p>Misjudging the situation and losing the initiative, he found himself in an extremely passive situation.</p><p>Old Ancestor Ming Hu's body stiffened. He could only maintain his grip on the sword blade, doing his utmost to resist the Grey Sparrow Sword.</p><p>The world's spiritual energy was inexhaustible, and the sword shadows seemed endless. His arms began to tremble.</p><p>The trembling grew increasingly violent.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>An explosive sound, like leather tearing, came from Old Ancestor Ming Hu's fingers, blood spurting out.</p><p>His skin had cracked open, revealing fresh red flesh.</p><p>Ancestor Ming Hu's flesh was no different from an ordinary person's; it did not resemble a corpse at all.</p><p>One crack in the skin immediately caused a series of explosive sounds.</p><p>Chunks of skin peeled away from his hand.</p><p>The old man's fingers quickly became mangled, the skin peeled away alive.  His expression was grim; every part of his body was meticulously refined, his skin tough as any armor. But this armor was broken, first his ten fingers, then his hands, wrists, and forearms – a horrifying sight. After the skin was removed, it was the flesh, layer upon layer of muscle and fascia torn apart, blood vessels flying everywhere.  Despite the gruesome scene, the old man showed no pain, his hands still gripping the Grey Sparrow Sword. Finally, the last bit of flesh was stripped from his fingers, revealing the bone. Surprisingly, his finger bones were a dark gold color, unlike human bone, more like incredibly hard metal.  Then, the entire skeletal structure of his hands was exposed, the same dark gold hue.  The bones, as it turned out, were indeed harder than the flesh and skin, and remained unbroken.</p><p>At that moment, the old man let out a furious roar.  The secret technique he'd been preparing was finally, painfully activated, his roar releasing his rage and savagery.  </p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The flesh on his arms exploded, falling away like petals scattered by a celestial maiden. From wrist to shoulder, both arms were reduced to bone.</p><p>*Crack crack!*</p><p>His ten finger bones clenched the Grey Sparrow Sword, joints popping.  The scattered pieces of flesh mingled together, forming a writhing, pulsating mass of blood, sickening to behold. This mass slammed into the Grey Sparrow Sword, like the vilest substance in the world, coating the blade. The sword's glow dimmed slightly.</p><p>At the cost of his arms, the old man bought himself a brief respite from the overwhelming attack. His eyes widened, and he opened his mouth wide.  His roar morphed into a piercing shriek, an unearthly sound that could pierce the earth, invade the mind, and shatter the soul.</p><p>Qin Sang, on the surface above, clearly heard the old man's shriek and his expression turned serious.  At the same time, he sensed something unusual, his gaze narrowing as he quickly scanned the ground.  Ordinary people would see nothing amiss, but Qin Sang saw a subtle, eerie change in this place. The boiling lava, the turbulent spiritual energy – what should have been a chaotic scene felt strangely desolate to him. The lava didn't seem as bright red, and its flow lacked its usual all-consuming force.</p><p>The feeling was indescribable. Although there were no living creatures around, Qin Sang felt as though everything had been drained of its 'vitality,' reduced to 'living corpses.' He glanced at the edge of the lava flow. Sand dunes were constantly being swallowed by the lava. He noticed the sand on the dunes was subtly tinged with a pale gray.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A hot wind blew, and a plume of smoke suddenly rose from a dune.  The sand had somehow disintegrated into dust. The smoke dissipated instantly, and the entire dune vanished as if it had never existed. The lava, the sand, even the geothermal activity on the lava's surface were 'fading'!</p><p>Below ground, the old man emitted a strange energy, silently seeping into the earth, the lava, and even the spiritual energy in the void.  Then, this energy, carrying various essences, returned, devoured by his body.  The corpse-demon body was consuming the spiritual energy of this place! Any living creatures on the battlefield would instantly be deprived of their life force. Sand and lava, though inanimate, were creations of the earth; the old man wouldn't let a single drop of essence go to waste, consuming everything!</p><p>The fiery red flames fluctuated less and less, becoming merely a shadow in the world. The wind blew across the land, scattering layers of lava and sand. The earth's crust, riddled with holes from Qin Sang's thousands of swords, finally could no longer hold, collapsing completely. The earth's collapse was silent, however, because it had already lost its weight, having been consumed by the old man.</p><p>After this battle, without a Nascent Soul cultivator to move mountains and fill the land, the desert would be left with an unfathomable chasm.  The chasm, centered on a lava lake, would cover the entire fissure. Many years later, the chasm would become a legend in the cultivation world, a tale told and retold.</p><p>Even Qin Sang felt that the Heaven and Earth energy, already under his control and transformed into a sword, was showing signs of being absorbed by Old Ancestor Minghu.</p><p>The Corpse Dao divine ability of the Transcending Void stage is indeed extraordinary!</p><p>Qin Sang was amazed, seeing Old Ancestor Minghu and sensing his rapidly rising aura.</p><p>Ancestor Minghu also looked up, his gaze passing over the Grey Warbler Sword, and landing on Qin Sang.  His eyes were no longer cloudy; his black pupils emitted a terrifying gaze, brimming with killing intent.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderclap erupted from the ground—the sound of bones breaking.</p><p>Ancestor Minghu suddenly changed his claws into fists, and struck out violently.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>This punch targeted the Grey Warbler Sword.  The fist was made of bare bone, its luster deep and restrained, yet it conveyed immense threat to Qin Sang.</p><p>The moment the fist was about to unleash its full force, Qin Sang's heart constricted. It felt as if this punch would drain the void, the fist itself being the heavens and earth.  The power of this punch was unimaginable.</p><p>The bone fist slammed into the blade.  Instantly, the Grey Warbler Sword also emitted a brilliant light, countless sword shadows converging on the blade.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The impact of fist and sword unleashed a terrifying shockwave.  A surging torrent of destructive energy rampaged within the sinkhole, easily expanding its diameter.</p><p>At this moment, to press the advantage and cleave Ancestor Minghu with a single strike was clearly impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang certainly wouldn't let Ancestor Minghu counterattack, reversing the excellent situation created by using the copper pillar as bait.  He instantly changed his sword technique.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>Within the chaotic sinkhole, the sound of sword singing was clearly audible.  Darkness, spreading from an unknown source, completely blotted out the sun, engulfing the sinkhole. This was not complete darkness; within it shone starlight.</p><p>Stars hung high, seemingly both distant and near. Qin Sang vanished into the star sea, becoming untraceable.  Simultaneously, Ancestor Minghu lost perception of the Grey Warbler Sword.</p><p>After the first punch, Ancestor Minghu immediately unleashed a second, but it missed its target. His expression shifted slightly as he found himself in a star sea.  Despite the power of his fists, in the boundless star sea, he felt at a loss.</p><p>“Sword array!”</p><p>Ancestor Minghu saw through the nature of the star sea. His opponent was a sword cultivator, certainly not that old geezer Gu Yun Sou!</p><p>The situation changed too rapidly. Ancestor Minghu had no time to think. From the moment he was ambushed to now, they had ravaged the place in a mere few breaths of time.</p><p>A sword array?  Smash it with one punch!</p><p>Ancestor Minghu was eager to turn the tables, to shift from passive to active.  Lingering in the sword array would only leave him at the enemy's mercy.</p><p>Having lost his target, Ancestor Minghu showed no intention of retracting his heavy punch. He didn't bother observing the shifting stars to break the array, instead, he struck violently at the void.  The endless expanse was merely an illusion created by the sword array, something Ancestor Minghu understood perfectly well.  Insufficient cultivation might mistake illusion for reality, but if his fist was strong enough, the array would inevitably reveal a weakness.</p><p>Overwhelming force breaks all techniques!</p><p>The array's master would certainly not remain idle. The starlight above flickered, and several star-swords descended, transforming into giant beams of starlight, slashing towards Ancestor Minghu.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Heavy blows shattered the starlight swords one after another. Ancestor Minghu stood beneath the starry sky, like a war god, facing his celestial attackers. His gaze was sharp, a cold smile playing on his lips.</p><p>As expected, once the enemy was eager to attack and was operating the sword array, he could discern some clues. He couldn’t immediately break the array, but it greatly aided in resolving the current situation.</p><p>“Limitless Corpse March!” Ancestor Minghu roared.</p><p>His body suddenly transformed into a wisp of ghostly wind, ethereal and intangible, causing the starlight swords to miss their target. The intangible wind, seemingly unbound by the sword array, swept through every corner of the star sea before reforming.  However, the reappeared Ancestor Minghu was not alone.</p><p>Beneath each star-sword in the starry sky, another Ancestor Minghu appeared, all looking up, delivering a heavy blow. There was no need to specifically target the main star.  The destruction of all star-swords would naturally break the array.</p><p>Seeing this bizarre sight, Qin Sang raised an eyebrow.  The undying bone cultivator was indeed formidable!  He had used the Seven Constellations Division Sword Array countless times, but this kind of head-on counter-breaking technique was a first. Qin Sang could tell that Ancestor Minghu was not bluffing; this divine ability was incredibly powerful.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang unleashed the final move of the Seven Constellations Division Sword Array.</p><p>Stars gather煞气, White Tiger roars through the heavens!</p><p>A ferocious tiger plunged, targeting one figure amongst the many—Ancestor Minghu's true form.  Overwhelming might bore down on him; he could clearly see the tiger's claws and teeth, intent on tearing him to shreds.</p><p>Ancestor Minghu snorted coldly, unafraid, charging forward, transforming his fist into a palm. With ghostly speed and movements, he struck the tiger's forehead.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Ancestor Minghu shuddered.  His entire body was covered in cracked skin and flesh, bleeding profusely, but he showed no concern. He thought the transformation into a煞虎 was the array’s final change, but as he clashed with the ferocious tiger, and was about to regroup, he found himself enveloped by an even more brilliant starry sky.</p><p>The enemy's attacks were relentless, giving him no time to breathe.  In the south of the original star sea, another expanse of stars appeared, more than doubling the original size. The southern starlight was somewhat hazy, with faint, flickering lights hinting at fire.</p>
