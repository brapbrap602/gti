<h1>### Chapter 1373: Crescent Moon Island</h1><p>Fei Can didn't let Qin Sang down.</p><p>It was a major realm weaker than the Toadfish.</p><p>But the magical power carefully refined by an early-stage Transformation Stage demon king still couldn't penetrate the Toxin-Repelling Armor and was firmly blocked outside.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Demonic fire rushed head-on.</p><p>Feeling the power of the demonic fire,</p><p>The Toadfish's scales all stood on end, its eyes filled with horror.</p><p>Qin Sang felt this wasn't enough. He slapped the Corpse Puppet Pouch, and a Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet shot out, attacking the Toadfish together with the demonic fire.</p><p>Having first passed through the storm belt and then fought fiercely with the three demons, the power of the puppet seal within the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet had also been greatly depleted. Puppets don't know fatigue, but they can't move perpetually.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The demonic fire was close at hand, about to engulf the Toadfish.</p><p>The Toadfish retreated violently, the layer of golden and green light on its body suddenly erupting, its momentum massive, suppressing back towards the demonic fire, instantly colliding with the demonic fire.</p><p>Black demonic fire, the shadow of the talisman puppet,</p><p>Golden and green light,</p><p>All kinds of strange phenomena converged and collided,</p><p>The void was a scene of chaos.</p><p>At the same time, a thunderous sound of air being torn apart came from afar.</p><p>A streak of blood light shot into the battlefield like lightning. It turned out that Bi Fang, seeing its companion in danger, had hastily taken action to help.</p><p>Seeing the rapidly approaching Bi Fang,</p><p>Qin Sang cursed inwardly. Ignoring the Toadfish's life or death, he immediately withdrew the demonic fire and the Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, flashing out of the range of the green light and continuing to flee.</p><p>If he had just a few more breaths of time, Qin Sang would have been confident in killing the Toadfish, but it wouldn't have helped much in escaping danger.</p><p>The greatest enemy was Bi Fang. No matter what, he couldn't be entangled by Bi Fang!</p><p>Inspecting his body, his true essence had been depleted by another ten percent. He swallowed a medicinal pill, grasped spirit stones, and raced against time to recover, but it was all a drop in the bucket.</p><p>'Swoosh!'</p><p>Bi Fang arrived.</p><p>A loud cry came from the battlefield.</p><p>The Toadfish was furious, jumping out from within.</p><p>A claw mark had appeared on its chest, nearly cutting it open.</p><p>The fish scales, which were harder than armor and magical treasures, were now charred black. Its body shook, and it turned into powder, falling down, revealing bright red flesh, causing great pain.</p><p>If not for the Little Fox and Bi Fang's help, it would have died on the spot!</p><p>Although it wasn't dead, the Toadfish's combat power had been greatly reduced, and it was impossible to continue pursuing Qin Sang.</p><p>The three demons looked at each other.</p><p>They hadn't expected that the three of them joining forces would not only fail to kill their weakened opponent but would instead leave one of them seriously injured and another over-exhausted.</p><p>"Quickly, chase! This person is already at the end of his rope. We must not let him escape!"</p><p>The Toadfish bared its fangs, shouting sharply, wishing it could swallow Qin Sang alive.</p><p>It was unwilling to admit it, but a trace of fear had arisen in its heart towards Qin Sang.</p><p>The power of the demonic fire was too terrifying.</p><p>The Little Fox's judgment was correct.</p><p>If they had encountered an opponent in their prime, it was likely they who would have fled in disarray!</p><p>The Little Fox arrived late at this time. Just now, in order not to burden Bi Fang, it had jumped off Bi Fang's back in advance.</p><p>Bi Fang nodded, "You all be careful and don't be seen by the human race."</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A strong wind rose.</p><p>Bi Fang pursued closely.</p><p>Leaving the Little Fox and the Toadfish looking at each other.</p><p>'Swoosh! Swoosh!'</p><p>Azure light and crimson radiance streaked across the sky, without the slightest attempt at concealment. The momentum of the escaping light could be sensed even outside of visual range.</p><p>Seeing that only Bi Fang was chasing, Qin Sang secretly thought that his attack just now hadn't been in vain. The fewer the opponents, the greater his chance of escape.</p><p>It was a pity he was too weak.</p><p>Otherwise, Qin Sang would dare to turn around now and fight Bi Fang.</p><p>"How much further until we reach the human territory?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the sea chart.</p><p>The markings on the sea chart were very crude, except for a clear route.</p><p>His destination was a land called Crescent Moon Island.</p><p>Crescent Moon Island was one of the Three Territories of the Northern Sea, a commonly used name; its more accurate name was Crescent Moon Territory.</p><p>Called an island, its territory was actually even wider than the Northern Chen Territory and was the largest of the Three Territories of the Northern Sea.</p><p>Crescent Moon Island had a peculiar shape, with a long, drawn-out terrain, pointed at both ends and bulging in the middle, shaped like a crescent moon, hence the name Crescent Moon.</p><p>Qin Sang was flying southwest, and he was now heading towards one of the moon tips of Crescent Moon Island.</p><p>The boat owner had said that demons dared not cause trouble near Crescent Moon Island, indicating that it should be a place controlled by the human race.</p><p>Qin Sang was turning these thoughts over in his mind when he suddenly noticed two light spots, one azure and one white, appearing in the distant sky.</p><p>The light spots were clearly the escaping light of cultivators, attracted by their pursuit.</p><p>Judging from the speed of the light spots, they were likely Nascent Soul cultivators or demon kings!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. Had he attracted another demon king?</p><p>His brow furrowed, cursing what kind of place this was. How could he easily encounter so many Nascent Soul-level experts, and all in groups of three or two, traveling together?</p><p>He vaguely guessed some clues.</p><p>Perhaps his timing was wrong, and he had likely stumbled upon something big.</p><p>The light spots flew closer and closer.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression eased slightly, confirming that the newcomers were human Nascent Souls, not demon kings.</p><p>Soon, the other party also saw the identities of the pursuer and the pursued. They paused slightly and then turned to fly towards Bi Fang behind.</p><p>When they saw the light spots, Bi Fang had hesitated. Confirming that the newcomers were enemies of the human race, even if unwilling, he could only give up the idea of ​​pursuing. The escaping light turned, and he turned away.</p><p>Seeing Bi Fang so decisively, the two flew for a distance, then stopped, turning their heads to look at Qin Sang on the other side.</p><p>Of these two, one was a white-clad scholar with a refined temperament, holding a folding fan, and possessing a graceful demeanor.</p><p>The other was an old man in a green robe, with a serious expression and unsmiling.</p><p>Having startled Bi Fang away, they wanted to greet Qin Sang, but Qin Sang had no intention of stopping at all. Without looking back, he flew away.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>The white-clad scholar was displeased, coldly scolding, "This person is so rude!"</p><p>The green-robed old man stared at the azure light, and after a moment, he said: "So that's how it is! This person seems to have an earth-shattering aura, but in reality, he is obviously in a weakened state. It seems that he is not a familiar fellow Daoist, so he is equally wary of us. However, when did such an expert appear nearby?"</p><p>The white-clad scholar's expression eased slightly.</p><p>If he encountered an unfamiliar cultivator in this state, his first thought would also be to stay away from the other party and wait to recover his strength.</p><p>"That guy is the Bi Fang demon king that Daoist Feng mentioned, right?"</p><p>The white-clad scholar glanced at the direction Bi Fang had flown away. The crimson radiance had already disappeared.</p><p>The green-robed old man nodded, "That's right, it's him! This demon presumptuously calls himself Bi Fang, and his ability is indeed not weak. This old man is not confident that he can defeat him. However, this demon has always been inseparable from a cunning fox. Why can only Bi Fang be seen at this time, and not the other demon kings?"</p><p>"Daoist Liu once sent a message that Bi Fang had also summoned a Toadfish. Now that those two demons are not here, could it be that this person escaped from the siege of three demon kings?"</p><p>The white-clad scholar's eyes were surprised, looking in the direction Qin Sang had fled.</p><p>"This person's escape technique is extremely rare. It's normal for him to shake off other demon kings. However, being able to break out from the siege of three demons shows his strength..."</p><p>The green-robed old man's eyes shone with different colors, and he whispered a few words to the white-clad scholar.</p>
