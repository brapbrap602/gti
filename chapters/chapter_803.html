<h1>Chapter 795: Body Cultivation</h1><p>Chapter 795: Body Cultivation</p><p>“The battle between the two clans' Yuan Ying cultivators has continued outside the Seven Killing Hall, and it hasn't stopped yet?”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't seen any Yuan Ying cultivators earlier, so he thought the matter had calmed down.</p><p>He had been affected by a Yuan Ying battle before and didn't want a repeat.</p><p>Unexpectedly, what he feared most happened.</p><p>Two figures, chasing each other, were heading straight for his location.</p><p>Qin Sang cursed under his breath and, without hesitation, activated his talisman and sword-energy thunder sounds, fleeing as fast as possible.</p><p>A brilliant light sped through the storm.</p><p>Even within the storm, the battle between the two Yuan Ying cultivators was fierce, and the commotion grew even more intense.</p><p>The hurricane howled.</p><p>The waves were monstrous.</p><p>Fortunately, this was the ocean; if it had been land, one could only imagine mountains being leveled by the storm. No living creature could survive here long.</p><p>Seeing the Yuan Ying battle drawing closer, Qin Sang was terrified. He struggled to dodge, drifting with the storm, finally escaping the battle zone.</p><p>‘Rumble… …’</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>Amidst the ceaseless roar of the storm, thunder echoed.</p><p>Two figures chased and fought. One wielded a sword; in front of the other, a black flute floated.</p><p>The flute played, but instead of music, earth-shattering thunder resounded. Illusory beast shadows flew out of the flute, ferocious and menacing, attacking the opponent.</p><p>The swordsman flicked their wrist; dozens of sword lights surrounded them, forming a sword array that transformed into a waterfall of starlight-like sword energy, descending like a silver river to tear the beast shadows apart and strike the flute.</p><p>The two seemed evenly matched, neither able to overpower the other.</p><p>Fighting continuously in the storm, they both seemed exhausted and moved towards the edge of the storm in a tacit understanding, sword energy and beast shadows flying everywhere as they fought.</p><p>Although Qin Sang reacted quickly, he was still affected. He felt a sharp pain in his back, stumbled, and was thrown into the sea by a huge wave created by a sword energy.</p><p>“Cough… cough…”</p><p>Qin Sang, pale, struggled out of the sea. Glancing around, he saw the two figures had left, and he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>He was worried that if the two clans' Yuan Ying cultivators didn't stop, the area outside the storm would become chaotic, possibly sparking a full-scale war between the clans.</p><p>At that moment, the unexpected happened.</p><p>The place where they fought was filled with radiant light; the two Yuan Ying cultivators attacked even more fiercely.</p><p>A green light struggled through the waves, speeding with all its might, finally avoiding the impact of the shockwaves and surviving until the two Yuan Ying cultivators left.</p><p>However, at the last moment, the swordsman unleashed an extremely powerful sword array; countless sword shadows blotted out the sun, striking the other.</p><p>The other cultivator showed no fear; the black flute suddenly expanded, and a creature resembling a qilin leaped out. The qilin protected them, blocking the attack.</p><p>Again, it was a stalemate; the two fought as they fled, disappearing into the depths of the storm.</p><p>But the impact of the sword array hadn't subsided. The green light, which had already avoided the battlefield, was struck by misfortune. First, it was blown away by the shockwave of the explosion; then, scattered sword shadows struck.</p><p>Within the green light was a young man with a thin face and a hooked nose.</p><p>His eyes were exceptionally sharp; he didn't panic in the face of the sword shadows. His eyes darted around, fixing on the direction where the two Yuan Ying cultivators disappeared, before letting out a long cry.</p><p>The cry was very sharp. Then, two green lights emerged from the young man’s back.</p><p>The green lights writhed, transforming into two enormous wings.</p><p>Although the wings were formed from green light, they looked real, covered in fine, intricate feathers, also green, forming magnificent wings.</p><p>With a ‘whoosh’, the wings opened and then swiftly closed, easily enveloping the hooked-nosed man completely.</p><p>Then, the sword shadows arrived.</p><p>‘Bang bang bang… …’</p><p>The wings were struck by the sword shadows, feathers flying everywhere, and many holes appeared in the wings, but they protected the hooked-nosed man well.</p><p>However, the tremendous force still sent the hooked-nosed man flying, his body like a ball, thrown far away by the sword shadows.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang, just emerging from the sea, saw this. From afar, he saw the man absorbing the impact and appearing from within the wings.  Unexpectedly meeting like this, Qin Sang narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Though the sword array was weakened, these two cultivators aren't as powerful as the Demon Lord and the Great Shaman, but their power shouldn't be underestimated.”</p><p>The man appeared unharmed, exactly as expected – a peak Nascent Soul cultivator!” Qin Sang concluded.</p><p>At that moment, the hooked-nose man noticed Qin Sang, turned, and frowned deeply. His first reaction was to retract his wings, but he realized it was too late, and murderous intent surged within him.</p><p>A great battle between other Yuan Ying stage cultivators might be happening nearby. Unaware of the hooked-nose man's killing intent, Qin Sang didn't want to linger and avoided contact.  He glanced at the man and turned to leave.</p><p>As long as the bone flute connection remained, he wasn't worried about losing track of him.</p><p>But Qin Sang hadn't gone far when his expression changed, turning grim. The man had silently followed, suddenly exploding with incredible speed, his overwhelming killing intent undisguised.</p><p>The distance between them rapidly closed.</p><p>Qin Sang spun around.</p><p>They stared at each other across the raging storm and waves.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the hooked-nose man's unwavering determination, feeling immense surprise.  He and the man had no quarrel; the man's previous lack of reaction suggested the bone flute hadn't been exposed. Why did seeing Qin Sang incite such furious hatred?</p><p>Even if it were a robbery, the expression was excessive.</p><p>Could it simply be because he had witnessed the man's defeat?</p><p>Suppressing his questions, Qin Sang felt a growing sense of danger. This man might be his strongest opponent since achieving Nascent Soul, and he immediately activated his talisman and flying sword, his speed suddenly erupting.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's incredible escape technique, the hooked-nose man showed surprise, but then smirked condescendingly. His wings had fully extended; with a slight flap, he became a streak of green lightning.</p><p>The wind and waves raged relentlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang fled desperately through the storm's gaps, the hooked-nose man relentlessly pursuing.</p><p>After a chase, Qin Sang's face grew even grimmer.</p><p>He had known the man's escape speed surpassed his own. However, the unpredictable nature of the storm made pursuit difficult.</p><p>Yet, in the heart of the storm, the gap widened.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered the man's cultivation wasn't as high as he'd imagined, but his physique was extraordinary; he was a body cultivator!</p><p>Facing the crashing waves, Qin Sang had to use his energy to protect himself, inevitably slowing his escape.  The other man, however, charged through wind and waves using only his body.</p><p>—</p><p>Went out, came back late.  Luckily it's the weekend, so I can sleep in.</p>
