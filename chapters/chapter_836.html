<h1>Chapter 828 Freedom</h1><p>Chapter 828 Freedom</p><p>Qin Sang had three remaining unripe fruits.  Their combined potency was enough for a breakthrough. Exchanging one Blood Domination Fruit for a late-stage demonic beast core was a good deal.</p><p>He was eighty percent confident in subduing the two-headed beast.</p><p>The Blood Domination Fruit was right in front of him, incredibly tempting.</p><p>Opportunities for breakthroughs were fleeting.  If he missed this one, he didn’t know when the next would come.  This chance was precious.</p><p>But an unexpected scene unfolded.</p><p>His attempt to subdue the two-headed beast failed again.</p><p>It lay motionless on the ground, slowly closing its eyes, allowing its demonic power to wane.  It hadn't swallowed the Blood Domination Fruit. It had resisted the temptation, preferring to forgo the breakthrough rather than submit.</p><p>“Freedom…?”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, momentarily stunned.</p><p>As a cultivator, Qin Sang was used to seeing beasts subdued by practitioners, especially those below the transformation stage, lacking the intelligence to consider their own desires.</p><p>Most cultivators have demonic beasts pledge allegiance as younglings, raising them from a young age.</p><p>Only those with exceptional strength or beast-controlling techniques could forcibly subdue adult beasts. Qin Sang didn't possess such techniques, relying on the two-headed beast’s willingness to submit.</p><p>After years of co-existence, Qin Sang knew the two-headed beast was intelligent, but it had never consumed Imperial Dew. He hadn't expected it to resist the instinctive urge for the sake of ‘freedom.’</p><p>Or perhaps, it was confident in its ability to break through on its own.</p><p>The Blood Domination Fruit's power gradually dissipated. The two-headed beast's breathing stabilized, showing extreme fatigue. It lay there listlessly, unwilling to move.</p><p>Clearly, it had failed.</p><p>The swelling on its neck hadn't completely disappeared. Though the breakthrough failed, the momentary epiphany brought significant benefits, a quantum leap in its strength.</p><p>Including its innate abilities.</p><p>Sensing the two-headed beast's aura, Qin Sang was surprised. The two-headed beast, already stronger than its cultivator counterparts, was now even more powerful. It could likely contend with an ordinary late-stage Golden Core cultivator without fear.</p><p>“Since you’ve made your decision, I won’t force you.  You can keep this Blood Domination Fruit for now.  It's still yours whenever you agree to my terms.”</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the fruit and said calmly.</p><p>If the two-headed beast remained unwilling, there was nothing more to say.  You can’t force someone to be happy.</p><p>After the failed breakthrough, Qin Sang certainly wouldn't easily let it go.</p><p>Such a talented beast, at its peak mid-stage, was the strongest beast controllable by the Primal Harmony Ring – incredibly rare to find, and even harder to subdue.</p><p>“It must remember my earlier promise – to release it after reaching the late-stage Golden Core… It was misled by my cultivation speed, overestimating my talent.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes were strange. Without finding the ten divine trees, his cultivation would soon stagnate. He could foresee that he wouldn't release the two-headed beast until at least the next Seven Killing Hall opening and finding the ancient teleportation array.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's words,</p><p>the two-headed beast snorted, untempted by the fruit.</p><p>“Fine. May you break through soon…”</p><p>Qin Sang put away the fruit, ignoring the two-headed beast, and returned to his own tasks.</p><p>It turned out breakthroughs weren't as easily obtained as he thought.</p><p>The two-headed beast wandered around his dwelling, even sneaking into Qin Sang's spirit gathering array. Six months passed with no progress.</p><p>It was practically driven mad, roaring at the moon and stars every night, seemingly questioning the heavens. Qin Sang, fed up, stored it in the Primal Harmony Ring to let it sleep.</p><p>Qin Sang's life was full.</p><p>Refining external avatars, cultivating, body refinement, feeding his spirit insects – he had almost no free time.</p><p>A month ago, the Xiang'an Auction House delivered the herbs Qin Sang had requested, for cultivating Sky-Eyed Butterflies. Some of the herbs were even more valuable than six-petal violet orchids. Luckily, he found them all.</p><p>Naturally, the price was incredibly high.</p><p>He had spent most of his savings acquiring materials to refine the Ten Directions Yan Luo Banner.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterflies' appetites were bottomless.  With such voracious consumers, Qin Sang was increasingly concerned about funds.</p><p>Thankfully, the fat silkworm fed itself at a slow pace, sleeping for a long time after each small bite. The purple crystals would easily last for decades.</p><p>“At this rate, it seems I'll have to resume my old profession – refining items to earn money.  Master Yi keeps inviting me to join the auction house, but I've never refined magic treasures.  Refining magic weapons only earns a meager living."</p><p>A high-grade spirit stone.  This allows me to attempt creating a spirit array to refine several Ten Directions Yama Banners.  My refinement skills will greatly improve once they are complete…”</p><p>Qin Sang conceived this idea, flipped his hand, and produced a high-grade spirit stone.</p><p>After a moment's reflection, Qin Sang cleaned up the clutter in his cave abode, then took out the materials for the array.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>A large pile of materials lay on the ground.</p><p>A variety of materials, all highly valuable.</p><p>Fortunately, a large portion consisted of various demon bones and beast hides. The requirements were strict; they had to conform to the five elements' generative and restrictive cycles.  Demon beast spirits were also needed.</p><p>These beast spirits, sealed within the banner poles, are key to later condensing spirit threads and weaving the soul banners.</p><p>Gathering these items in the Xiao Han region was no easy task.  Even Gui Yin Laozu, a Nascent Soul cultivator, had expended considerable effort in his day.</p><p>But in the Cang Lang Sea, they could be purchased with enough spirit stones.</p><p>The difficulty lay in the other materials. Qin Sang had commissioned the Xiang An Auction House, and it took a long time to gather them all.</p><p>After counting the materials and confirming nothing was missing, Qin Sang took out the Xuan Tie pillars, set them aside, categorized the various materials, and began his work.</p><p>The spirit array was incredibly complex; an ancient array Gui Yin Laozu had discovered after extensive research in ancient texts.</p><p>Qin Sang first refined the various materials, then arranged them in the array. After several hours of diligent work, the array began to take shape.</p><p>Three days later, the array was complete.</p><p>His cave abode was now filled with a five-colored array.</p><p>Once formed, the array appeared seamless, obscuring the original appearance of the materials.  It looked as if it were made of white jade, with empty spaces around the perimeter for inserting mid-grade spirit stones.</p><p>However, the center required a high-grade spirit stone; otherwise, it could not be activated.</p><p>Above the array, five-colored lights alternated, representing the five elemental energies emanating from the materials.  Once activated, these energies, following the array's rules, converge towards the center.</p><p>The Xuan Tie pillars would be placed there.</p><p>He intended to refine more Ten Directions Yama Banners than Gui Yin Laozu had.</p><p>The method used for ten banners might not unleash their full power.  A more suitable array should be found, requiring adjustments to the refinement process.</p><p>Since returning from the Seven Kills Hall, Qin Sang had been pondering this, and had a nascent idea.</p><p>However, that was something to consider later when weaving the soul banners. For now, he needed to focus on refining the banner poles.</p>
