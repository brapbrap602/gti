<h1>Chapter 949: Another Attempt</h1><p>Chapter 949: Another Attempt</p><p>Deep in the mountains and valleys.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, wondering if he had come to the wrong place.</p><p>The Ba Xue Fruit grew in the crevices of a cliff face, where the red-tailed cranes also nested.</p><p>The scene before him didn't match his memories.</p><p>A waterfall had appeared in the middle of the cliff, and the rock walls on either side were shattered and cracked, not looking naturally formed.  It resembled the claw marks of several monstrous beasts and the fissures left by a tremendous impact.</p><p>Had a great battle taken place here after he left?</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely guessed the reason.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall was never peaceful; the Ba Xue Fruit held immense attraction for ferocious beasts. The red-tailed cranes weren't strong enough to guard the fruit. If other beasts discovered it, a fierce battle was inevitable.</p><p>"Judging by this scene, the battle must have been incredibly brutal. The red-tailed cranes were likely driven away, and I wonder if the plant that bore the Ba Xue Fruit is even still there?"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, feeling his hopes diminish.</p><p>He hid in waist-high weeds, summoned his Sky Eye Butterfly, and observed the waterfall.  He found abnormalities – many small holes, dozens of them, inside the waterfall.</p><p>These didn't resemble red-tailed crane nests.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a corpse puppet and directed it towards the pool at the bottom of the waterfall.  The puppet pushed through the weeds, and as it neared the pool, a hostile shriek rang out from above.</p><p>'Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>Water splashed from the waterfall as a flock of snow-white, eagle-sized birds burst from the water. Their speed was astonishing, leaving trails in the air as they attacked the corpse puppet.</p><p>These adult white birds possessed the strength comparable to Golden Core cultivators. The corpse puppet was powerless to resist.  Before it could run far, the birds caught up and dismembered it in an instant.  If it weren't for the puppet's unusual scent, it would have been swallowed whole.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang approached the waterfall and examined the nests.  He found the remains of what looked like the plant in one nest.  The Ba Xue Fruit vine had once been lush and green, bearing clusters of unripe fruit, full of life. Now, only a withered, dry stump remained.</p><p>The stump had sprouted new buds, with two tiny green leaves, indicating it was still alive.  However, it would be a long time before it bore fruit again.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a pang of regret.</p><p>The Ba Xue Fruit was rare.  The Seven Killing Hall had one, only to have it destroyed in a monstrous beast battle.</p><p>Sensing the presence of a stranger, the birds flew into a rage, screaming as they charged towards Qin Sang.  A flash of escaping light enveloped him, as he burst forth with a speed far exceeding the birds'.  With a few leaps, he vanished into the deep mountains.</p><p>Qin Sang barely paused during his journey, heading straight for the Sky Tower.</p><p>The Sky Tower pierced the clouds, easily visible.</p><p>From a distant hill, Qin Sang observed the tower.</p><p>Unlike last time, the area around the tower was quiet, without a single soul in sight.  No Yuan Ying masters were guarding the entrance; it seemed anyone could enter freely.</p><p>However, Qin Sang didn't rush.</p><p>This time, the Witch Clan not only had the Grand Witch Priest but also the infamous Fang Lao Mo.  If things turned chaotic, it would be extremely dangerous, and he didn't want to get involved.</p><p>He still vividly remembered being caught in the crossfire between the Grand Witch Priest and the Demon Lord.</p><p>Bai emerged from the corpse puppet bag, standing beside Qin Sang, gazing up at the tower.</p><p>"Does this place seem familiar to you?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Bai frowned, silent for a moment.  "I don't remember. That part of my memory may be lost. I can't recall anything.  On the other hand, the jade slips you gave me have been helpful."</p><p>Qin Sang felt disappointed.  "Those jade slips only contain common knowledge about the present world, along with information on herbs and materials. They shouldn't be of much use to you, should they?"</p><p>Bai said coldly, "There were also those several techniques of corpse refinement… I've forgotten my previous cultivation methods. After taking over this body, I've only been able to improve myself through trial and error and have hit a bottleneck.  And the issue with the Heavenly Corpse Talisman remains unresolved; I'm quite lost. These corpse refinement techniques have given me inspiration, and perhaps I can use external forces to help me forcefully break through."</p><p>"Friend, are you planning to break through and become a Corpse King?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. "Friend, how confident are you?  What if, after becoming a Corpse King, you lose control and your life force is dissipated by the concentrated corpse energy?"</p><p>A Corpse King is a top-tier corpse comparable in power to a Yuan Ying cultivator. Naturally born Corpse Kings are bloodthirsty and cruel, with immense destructive power and bodies as hard as iron. Even Yuan Ying cultivators find them difficult to defeat, and their appearances always bring about disaster.</p><p>Records of Corpse Kings appearing in the Xiaohan Region and the Canglang Sea are extremely rare. Even those ancient corpse cultivation sects find it difficult to cultivate a Corpse King.</p><p>Bai had spent decades refining the body of a Flying Night Rakshasa, reaching the brink of breakthrough, but now he's encountered a bottleneck.</p><p>Qin Sang welcomes Bai's breakthrough; it would mean an additional Yuan Ying-level helper.</p><p>But if the advancement leads to the loss of his life force, Bai would have no choice but to become a ghost cultivator.  There would be no need to seek out the Heavenly Corpse Sect, and their previous agreement would be void.</p><p>Bai pondered for a moment. "So, caution is necessary. To regain my humanity, I absolutely cannot destroy my remaining life force.  I need to carefully study various spirit herbs and try repeatedly to find a way. I've spent many years as a wandering spirit, and I've gained considerable experience in ghost cultivation.  I'm about 20% confident in suppressing the corpse energy and protecting my life force after becoming a Corpse King.  However, if I were to advance further and become a Yin-Yang Heavenly Fiend, then there would truly be no hope of recovery."</p><p>"Yin-Yang Heavenly Fiend?  In this era, it only exists in legends.  But if you don't intend to regain your human form, you might actually advance to Yin-Yang Heavenly Fiend…"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>A Yin-Yang Heavenly Fiend is a Nascent Soul-level corpse, said to possess unparalleled Yin-Yang escape techniques, appearing and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>Bai glanced at the Heavenly Tower, losing interest. "I'll return to my corpse puppet bag to avoid being seen by others and causing trouble. Please, when you have time, write down all the spirit herbs and materials that can be found in this world…"</p><p>Qin Sang waited a little longer. Seeing no abnormalities near the Heavenly Tower, he cautiously approached it, lingered for a while, and then dashed inside.</p><p>The familiar scene greeted him; everything inside the Heavenly Tower was normal.</p><p>Qin Sang secretly breathed a sigh of relief.  He immediately spread his wings, but didn't rush to release his two-headed… creature.</p><p>The puppets on each floor of the Heavenly Tower no longer posed a threat to him; he could easily handle them alone.  His concern was the potential appearance of a Yuan Ying cultivator, their external avatars, and the two-headed… creature.</p><p>Returning to the Heavenly Tower, Qin Sang was familiar with the surroundings and quickly found the ancient hall containing the first-floor teleportation array.</p><p>His swordsmanship had improved, his perception more acute.  The sword intent contained within the ancient hall might share the same origin as the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen."</p><p>"This time, I will traverse the sword path and see what secrets the Heavenly Tower holds!"</p><p>Qin Sang silently sized up the ancient hall, used his sword wheel to slay the blocking puppets, and entered the teleportation array.</p><p>Before long, Qin Sang ascended the tower, reaching the fifth floor, proceeding smoothly without any obstacles.</p>
