<h1>Chapter 2014: Turning the Tide</h1><p>Gu Ya's thoughts coincided with Qin Sang's. He, too, was hoping to encounter predecessors from Storm Realm who had ascended at Abundant Jade Gate.</p><p>Past ascendants from Storm Realm were all exceptional talents.  Not to mention Tian Yue Shangren, Qin Sang knew of Xiao Xiangzi and Bao Gu, both undoubtedly individuals of great renown.</p><p>The Four Sages led the weak human race, overthrowing the Wu Clan, the original rulers of the Boundless Sea, and ushered in an era of prosperity for humankind in that region. Their contributions were etched into the memories of generations to come.  Bao Gu dedicated her heart and soul to humanity, leaving behind guidance for future generations even before embarking on her path to ascension.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi suppressed the Ancient Devil, leading to the establishment of the Profound Heaven Palace. He also strategically arranged defenses in the Northern Sea to prevent the Ancient Devil's resurgence, leaving behind artifacts such as Soul Calming Incense.</p><p>To a certain extent, Qin Sang inherited their legacy, paving the way for his current achievements.</p><p>Their talent and spirit were unparalleled. If they had ascended to the Greater Heavens, entering a vaster world, they would surely have attained remarkable achievements, barring unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>“With this thought, this junior embarked on the journey, proceeding cautiously. I encountered several dangers along the way, but thankfully, this junior was alert enough to escape each peril.</p><p>“This journey was undertaken as part of an employment. The employer claimed that Abundant Jade Gate was experiencing a period of great upheaval, and sought to find opportunities there, but was hampered by a lack of manpower, thus hiring experts as guards. This junior thought that traveling in a group would be safer than going alone, so I secured a position.</p><p>“The journey was smooth, but unexpectedly, pursuers attacked us as we neared Abundant Jade Gate. It was then we realized that the employer had concealed the true purpose of the expedition. Treasure hunting was merely a ruse to deceive others, which was unfortunately discovered by their enemies, who then pursued us.</p><p>“Such incidents are not uncommon. The enemies usually focus solely on the employer. As long as outside guards like us are not entangled and retreat decisively, we generally avoid being relentlessly pursued.  However, they unexpectedly targeted this junior's Jade Heart Blade.  Fortunately, I encountered Senior…”</p><p>Gu Ya glared hatefully at the two figures on the ground. Since Qin Sang had instructed her not to address him as "Sage" anymore, she switched to calling him "Senior."</p><p>Facts proved her intuition correct. Not only did she meet a predecessor from the lower realms who ascended at Abundant Jade Gate, but it was Qin Shengren, revered by the entire realm.</p><p>Qin Shengren also lived up to his reputation.  Not only did he escape the clutches of the demonic beings, but he had also broken through to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Storm Realm was saved!</p><p>At this thought, the joy of encountering Qin Sang instantly overshadowed the unpleasantness of being pursued. Gu Ya's eyes shone brightly.</p><p>“Senior, when are we going home?”</p><p>She believed that Qin Sang, who had selflessly lured away the demonic beings for the sake of the realm's inhabitants, must still hold the lower realm's beings close to his heart.</p><p>Finally, she could go home!</p><p>“Are you in such a hurry to return? Why not wait until the Jade Heart Blade fully transforms before departing? It would be much safer for you that way."</p><p>Qin Sang could see that the Jade Heart Blade was close to transforming.</p><p>Presumably, the Ethereal Spirit Sect or Gu Ya herself had encountered another opportunity. Otherwise, according to their previous arrangements, the Jade Heart Blade would only be tempered within the Mountain Within a Mountain and wouldn't have advanced so quickly.</p><p>If Gu Ya had been more patient and gathered spirit materials to refine the Jade Heart Blade into a spirit treasure, her strength would have greatly increased.</p><p>“What? Is the situation in Storm Realm dire?”</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the change in Gu Ya's expression, his eyes narrowing slightly, a guess already forming in his mind.</p><p>Gu Ya nodded, her expression grave, and said firmly, “Storm Realm has been in conflict with the Longyou Clan for many years.  Countless fellow Daoists and seniors have fallen on the battlefield. Even just for myself, this junior must return. Before being swept away by the Mistfall, this junior hadn't yet reached the Nascent Soul stage. Returning now, this junior can definitely contribute more and slay more enemies! Master died at the hands of the Longyou Clan. This junior even brought the sect's inherited Jade Heart Blade away. The sect suffered heavy losses and is now leaderless. This junior doesn't know how they are now…”</p><p>After Bing Han's death, Gu Ya assumed the position of Sect Master.  As the leader of a sect, how could she not worry about her sect? Gu Ya longed to sprout wings and return to the Mist Sea immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang was her only hope.</p><p>“What is the Longyou Clan’s strength like? Besides the Longyou Clan, are there any other enemies?” Qin Sang continued to ask.</p><p>Gu Ya's words were within Qin Sang's expectations.</p><p>Before ascending to the Greater Heavens, the peak combat power of Storm Realm was only at the late Nascent Soul stage. Even after passing the Gray Heaven Tribulation, their strength would increase rapidly for a short period, but it was ultimately limited.</p><p>Storm Realm's starting point was too low. Moreover, Storm Realm cultivators didn't understand the dangers of the Gray Heaven Tribulation, so they were initially unprepared and certainly lost a number of experts.</p><p>According to some records, the overall strength of the Otherfolk was inferior to that of the human race, yet they were still a prominent and established race that could maintain their foothold in a corner of the Greater Heavens. If Storm Realm had landed in the territory of the Otherfolk, even if the three races of Storm Realm - humans, Wu, and Yao - united, they wouldn't have the strength to contend with the Otherfolk. There wouldn't have been a war at all.</p><p>Similar to the Yao race, the Otherfolk was a collective term for many races. These races shared a common characteristic: a humanoid appearance.  It was said that their customs were also similar to humans, but they differed significantly from humans in certain physical traits, resembling the Yao race instead.</p><p>These traits could be facial features or found on any part of their bodies.  For example, the Longyou Clan had fur and four ears, while the Feathered Folk were all handsome, born with swan-like, pure white wings. Even ordinary Feathered Folk could soar through the sky like birds.</p><p>Some Otherfolk races not only had distinct characteristics but also possessed innate abilities, just like the Yao race.</p><p>It sounded like the Otherfolk were a hybrid bloodline of humans and Yao, but according to the descriptions in those records, the truth didn't seem to be so.  The offspring of human-Yao unions were different in the Greater Heavens.  They were called Half-Yao, while the Otherfolk were given the name "Otherfolk."</p><p>According to records, the Merfolk and the Feathered Folk were the dominant races among the Otherfolk, one patrolling the skies, the other guarding the seas.</p><p>The Otherfolk primarily lived in the Mist Sea, a region teeming with countless races and nations. Humans knew little about it, and there were no detailed descriptions in the records.</p><p>The environment of the Mist Sea was unique, but it couldn't isolate and protect the Otherfolk forever.  For the Otherfolk to have survived to this day in the dog-eat-dog world of the Greater Heavens, powerful strength was indispensable.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know whether the Merfolk or the Feathered Folk had Grand Ascension cultivators, but there were undoubtedly quite a few Body Integration cultivators.</p><p>If the Otherfolk targeted Storm Realm, they could annihilate it with a flick of their wrist, unless the enemies of Storm Realm were only one or two small tribes among the Otherfolk.</p><p>"The Longyou Clan alone has inflicted heavy losses on us, not to mention the Mist Sea, which, aside from the natural disaster of the Mistfall, also harbors bizarre Mist Beasts that appear and disappear without a trace. In order to consolidate our strength and resist the Longyou Clan, we were forced to abandon the Yao Sea and the Boundless Sea, relocating the three races' cultivators from those regions to the Central Continent. Although we tried our best to relocate the mortals before the Longyou Clan reacted, we still suffered heavy losses," Gu Ya sighed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the dwelling places that the Four Sages had fought so hard to gain for future generations were ultimately not preserved.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind flashed with images of Tian Xing Island and Four Sages Mountain, then to Wu God Continent. Ya Gu's homeland was also occupied by the Otherfolk.</p><p>The Central Continent and the Western Lands were part of the same landmass, with a vast expanse between them. Previously, due to storms tearing apart the earth and rampant magma flows, it was unsuitable for habitation.</p><p>Now that the storms had subsided and the land had returned to normal, it would undoubtedly be a vast and empty area.  Relocating all the inhabitants of Storm Realm there would be more than sufficient.</p><p>"What about the Four Regions of the Northern Sea?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked gravely. Had the Four Regions of the Northern Sea also fallen?</p><p>The Great Sui, the Small Cold Domain, Mount Shaohua, the Thousand Mountains Bamboo Sea, the North Star Region, the Crescent Moon Region, the Hidden Sun Region…</p><p>Too many places held precious memories.</p><p>“After the storms between the Central Continent and the Western Lands disappeared, the earth returned to tranquility.  Unexpectedly, an ancient Great Teleportation Formation was discovered there, connecting to the Northern Sea.  With this Great Teleportation Formation, if enemies attack, the Central Continent can provide timely support. Otherwise, we might have to consider abandoning our homeland," Gu Ya said thankfully.  "Fairy Liu Li, uniting various forces and leading the Storm Realm cultivators, is using the former Western Lands, the Central Continent, and the Northern Sea as a three-pronged defense against the Longyou Clan…”</p><p>Hearing that the Northern Sea had held on, Qin Sang's expression eased slightly. The places he had walked, the marks he had left, had not been completely erased.</p><p>The Longyou Clan's strength shouldn't be too formidable. Their highest combat power was probably only at the Nascent Soul stage, but for the fledgling Storm Realm, they were undoubtedly dangerous enemies.</p><p>From Gu Ya's tone, it was evident that Liu Li had played a crucial role in the war between Storm Realm and the Longyou Clan.</p><p>Earlier, when Gu Ya mentioned "Fairy Liu Li," Qin Sang felt a sense of relief, but he had refrained from asking until now.</p><p>"Fairy Liu Li is said to be the first Nascent Soul cultivator of Storm Realm after it merged with the Greater Heavens, and possibly the only one at that time. In times of crisis, thankfully, Fairy Liu Li stepped forward in time, rallying various forces and uniting the people's hearts.  Only then were all races and regions able to work together and overcome the most difficult period…"</p><p>Gu Ya peeked at Qin Sang as she spoke.</p><p>It was rumored that Fairy Liu Li was Qin Shengren’s Dao Companion. Cultivators of the Profound Heaven Palace swore that they had held a Dao Companion Ceremony, witnessed by the entire sect.</p><p>Of course, the previous narrative was that Fairy Liu Li was Qin Shengren's widow, and the reason various factions were persuaded by Fairy Liu Li to unite so readily was also due to this relationship.</p><p>Even though Fairy Liu Li dedicated her heart and soul to Storm Realm and repeatedly teetered on the brink of life and death, there were still those with malicious intent who speculated that Fairy Liu Li erected a statue of Qin Shengren out of selfish motives.  It wasn’t until they personally witnessed the sacred mountain brought by the Wu Clan of the Boundless Sea, and saw the terrifying marks left by demonic attacks on the broken mountain, that those people shut their mouths.</p><p>Gu Ya clearly remembered the day she went to the holy ground to pay her respects to the statue.  She happened to encounter Fairy Liu Li, who stood quietly before the statue for a long time.  She regretted not having the courage to speak to Fairy Liu Li at that time.</p><p>From Fairy Liu Li, Gu Ya sensed an aloof aura, unsure whether it was her nature or due to the grief of losing her Dao Companion.</p><p>That solitary figure, Gu Ya still remembered vividly, those delicate shoulders bearing an unimaginable burden.</p><p>Therefore, she leaned towards the latter explanation. Otherwise, Fairy Liu Li could have abandoned Storm Realm at any time, taking only those close to her. Why would she disregard her own safety and fight desperately to gain a sliver of hope for Storm Realm, turning the tide?  Presumably, she didn't want Qin Sang’s efforts to be in vain.  Erecting the statue was also to have a place to commemorate her Dao Companion, and besides, it was what Qin Sang deserved.</p><p>Such deep love between a married couple!  Gu Ya didn't envy Fairy Liu Li for having a Dao Companion like Qin Sang, but she envied that sincere affection.  Fortunately, Heaven had eyes.  Qin Sang was not dead, and they could reunite.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. It seemed that even Liu Li believed he had perished.</p><p>Indeed, at that time, the First Sword Attendant, in order to prevent his teleportation, forcibly attacked and broke the realm barrier, which inevitably created a tremendous commotion.  Fang Laomo and other Wu Clan cultivators were nearby and witnessed it firsthand.</p><p>Logically, under such an attack, he had no chance of survival.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't expected Liu Li to go to such lengths, especially during the period when Storm Realm's strength hadn't yet improved. Qin Sang could imagine how arduous and challenging every step must have been.</p><p>Seeing the fervor in Gu Ya's eyes, Qin Sang knew she desperately hoped he would take her back immediately.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang also wanted to return to Storm Realm as soon as possible.</p><p>Besides the anticipation of reuniting with old friends, Qin Sang had another thought.  He had been preparing to establish an altar to comprehend the Grand Ascension Killing Dao, but he hadn't yet found a suitable location.</p><p>Wasn’t Storm Realm the perfect place for his altar?</p><p>Unlike the mortal world ruled by the Green Ram Temple, Storm Realm revered him as a Sage.  There was no need for him to do anything more.  Their reverence for him was genuine, which provided him with an advantage in comprehending the Grand Ascension Killing Dao that he couldn't find elsewhere.</p><p>With him there, he could certainly alleviate Storm Realm's precarious situation.</p><p>He used the word "alleviate" instead of "resolve" because he didn't understand the situation in the Mist Sea or the other Otherfolk races' attitudes towards Storm Realm.</p><p>Since the other Otherfolk hadn't taken action to eliminate the alien Storm Realm, perhaps they weren't exclusionary, and Storm Realm had a chance to establish itself.</p><p>Even if they faced rejection from the Otherfolk, he could find another way out for Storm Realm.</p><p>“The Mist Sea is far away in the Eastern Sea. It's not a place one can reach just by saying so.  Also, do you know the exact location of Storm Realm within the Mist Sea?” Qin Sang asked Gu Ya.</p><p>Gu Ya was taken aback, then shook her head, calming down.</p><p>She only knew some information about the vicinity of Storm Realm but not its precise location.</p><p>If Storm Realm had landed deep within the Mist Sea, they would have to pass through the territories of various Otherfolk races to reach it. This journey would likely be fraught with difficulties. They needed to plan carefully and at least first find out where the Longyou Clan was located.</p><p>What Qin Sang didn't say was that he faced an even more difficult dilemma, making it hard for him to leave.</p><p>This trip to Abundant Jade Gate concerned the Earth Slaughter Sword fragment and the *Purple Star Sword Canon*. The First Sword Attendant and Tian Yue Shangren had spared no effort, using the Purple Star Palace as bait, to create this opportunity for him to obtain the sword fragment.  How could he just walk away?</p><p>Fortunately, according to Gu Ya's description, before she was swept away by the Mistfall, Storm Realm, relying on the Northern Sea, the Western Lands, and the Central Continent, was no longer so vulnerable against the Longyou Clan's attacks.</p><p>Moreover, Storm Realm's strength would continue to grow. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, they should be able to defend themselves.  Several centuries had already passed; a little more time wouldn't make a difference.  If a catastrophic event occurred in the meantime that destroyed Storm Realm, Qin Sang rushing back would be futile.</p><p>The news brought by Gu Ya caught Qin Sang somewhat off guard.  He would have to modify his subsequent plans.</p><p>He only hoped that Tian Yue Shangren would arrive soon.  But if his identity were exposed and he returned directly, wouldn't he bring disaster upon Storm Realm? Qin Sang furrowed his brow.  He needed to make proper arrangements.</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang was about to speak when his gaze suddenly flickered, and he turned towards the depths of the wind and sand.</p><p>Several auras were rapidly approaching, likely companions of the two on the ground.</p>
