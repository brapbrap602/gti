<h1>Chapter 2157: Mirror Divine Technique</h1><p>The two split the spoils and stealthily approached the lair of the Great Fiend.</p><p>The traces left by the Great Fiend’s passage were extremely obvious; the deathly aura swirling there could be sensed from afar.  They didn't need to risk getting close; they could follow the trail to find the lair.</p><p>The area was mountainous, with rivers flowing incessantly.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi didn't approach the lair rashly, instead landing on a distant peak to observe from afar.</p><p>Even from a great distance, they could see the gray miasma emanating an aura of decay and corruption. This miasma must have lingered there for a long time; even if the Great Fiend had left, it wouldn't dissipate quickly.</p><p>Great Fiends often leave similar phenomena at their lairs, allowing cultivators to avoid them from a distance.</p><p>“This Great Fiend…”</p><p>Shaoshi’s eyes flashed upon seeing the gray fog, seemingly remembering something, and fell into contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang kept a close watch on the direction the Great Fiend had gone. The Great Fiend was no longer visible, and its oppressive presence was undetectable, but it could return to its lair at any moment, so they still needed to be cautious.</p><p>They paused here not only to observe the Great Fiend's movements but also to see if any competitors would help scout the way.</p><p>After much deliberation, Shaoshi shook his head slightly and said, "This Great Fiend's previous lair shouldn't be here. Someone saw a similar phenomenon in the Sacred Land, but unfortunately, there's no detailed information.  I wonder if it's the same one."</p><p>After waiting for a long time without incident, the two decided not to wait any longer and set off immediately, planning a quick in-and-out mission.</p><p>Leaving the mountain, they quietly approached the lair.  Halfway there, Shaoshi summoned the Unfixed Eight Poles Diagram.</p><p>The treasure slowly unfolded, and wisps of Xuanhuang energy seeped into the earth. A subtle fluctuation spread through the surrounding mountains before quickly returning to normal.  Having preemptively deployed the Diagram as a precaution, the two continued toward the Great Fiend's lair.</p><p>As they drew near the gray miasma, a putrid stench hit them.  Within the miasma were black, dead mountains, and at their foot lay fetid, decaying swamps.  No signs of life could be found.</p><p>They stopped at the edge of the miasma, their eyes scanning the area.  The fog obstructed their vision and perception.  Spotting a fractured mountain peak amongst the hills, they flashed into the mist.</p><p>Surrounded by the gray fog, they immediately sensed something strange and exchanged a look, both circulating their true essence to defend themselves.</p><p>The moment they contacted the fog, it seemed to come alive, attempting to invade their bodies. The mist wasn't composed of dust or water droplets; instead, it felt like countless extremely fine filaments, searching for fertile ground to take root and sprout.</p><p>The miasma possessed powerful invasive and corrosive power. Once it entered a body and gained the upper hand, it would seize everything from the host, turning them into monstrous creatures covered in filaments, until they died and decayed.</p><p>“It’s not a living thing.”</p><p>Shaoshi transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded; he too saw that these filaments were not living things, or even truly existent entities.  When they tried to grab them, they found nothing. This was a power unlike any they had ever encountered, and the filaments were its manifestation.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang summoned the Gray Warbler Sword and silently unleashed a sword light, cleaving a gap in the gray fog, which instantly sealed shut again.</p><p>He sensed filaments being annihilated by the sword light, but the effect wasn't as good as expected; this was, after all, only the lingering power of a Great Fiend at the Unity stage.</p><p>With their strength, completely clearing the gray fog here was difficult, and they didn't have the time to spend on it.  They could only focus on defense. However, this meant that, due to constantly having to resist the miasma's assault, they couldn't perfectly conceal their presence as before.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no other cultivators around. Qin Sang and Shaoshi both deployed protective techniques; Qin Sang even summoned the Bright Mountain Armor.</p><p>They continued forward. The miasma's power increased, as expected, but it couldn't stop them.</p><p>The scene around the broken mountain gradually became clear, though Qin Sang had already seen it beforehand using his Celestial Eye technique.</p><p>Deeper into the broken mountain, the ground was in disarray; everywhere were signs of collapsed peaks.  The swamp was filled with rubble; one could imagine a great cataclysm had occurred here.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shaoshi deduced that this was likely not yet the Great Fiend’s lair.  They continued deeper, and the sight that greeted them at the heart of the area made their hearts tighten.</p><p>It was a vast expanse of black mud swamp; there were no peaks inside, perhaps obliterated by the Great Fiend, though some traces were impossible for the swamp to conceal.</p><p>They discovered a deep pit beneath the mire, its bottom crisscrossed by fathomless ravines that tore through the earth.  All signs pointed to the lair of the monstrous beast being nearby, though undoubtedly ravaged and unrecognizable; the pit and ravines were new.</p><p>"This must be the source of the shimmering light," Shao Shi deduced, basing his inference on Ji Qiong's description.  He gazed around, exclaiming, "It looks like a battlefield!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded in agreement.</p><p>He found something unusual about the ground under the mire – a profusion of turtle-back stones, spirit objects that, when forming veins, become incredibly hard.  It was likely that several mountains of these stones once existed here, their hardness unimaginable – even Nascent Soul cultivators would struggle to destroy them.</p><p>"We can only detect the beast's aura here," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Shao Shi nodded.  "Unless the beast suddenly went mad, there's another possibility: it fought an enemy that no longer exists."</p><p>This conjecture was rather unbelievable. Shao Shi explained, "Unreasonable things often happen in the Sacred Land, defying all logic; it's all part of the trial. If those shimmering lights are part of this trial, we must be careful."</p><p>The shimmering light had driven the beast from its lair; they dared not be complacent.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shao Shi thoroughly searched the mire and its surroundings, but found nothing unusual.  All signs pointed to the beast suddenly going berserk, destroying its lair, and migrating elsewhere.</p><p>"The shimmering light left no trace, nor is its source known," Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>"If it relates to the secrets of the trial, it won't be easily deciphered by us. To understand the truth, we'd likely need to find the beast, maybe even kill it, and see if it carried away something special."</p><p>Shao Shi said, acknowledging the impossibility. His tone shifted. "There's another possibility: a hidden passage leading out of the Sacred Land, but the time hasn't come for it to appear."</p><p>Their search yielded nothing, leading to various conjectures, all unverified.  After discussion, they decided to follow the beast's trail, hoping to find other clues; otherwise, they would have to give up.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shao Shi left the mire, following the tracks, soon reaching the edge of the gray fog.</p><p>Just as they were about to fly out of the fog, Qin Sang sensed something, his expression shifting slightly. He suddenly looked towards a mountain peak, simultaneously transmitting a warning: "Ambush!"</p><p>Shao Shi also detected the anomaly, but a step slower than Qin Sang. Had Qin Sang not warned him, he might have approached the mountain peak before discovering it.</p><p>The two abruptly halted, then heard a silvery laugh.</p><p>"Your senses are quite sharp!"</p><p>The next moment, the void above the mountain peak distorted, revealing an oval mirror made of water; a constant flow of clear water cascaded down its surface, like a water curtain cave.</p><p>Shao Shi said gravely, "Mirror magic! It's the Jao people!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened; he hadn't expected to encounter a Jao master so soon after entering the Sacred Land.</p><p>During their time in Yuanjiao City, he had gained a clearer understanding of the power of the Feather people, and the Jao, as the rulers of the waters, were comparable in strength!</p><p>This mirror magic was quite mysterious; only when they drew closer did Tianmu Butterfly detect the anomaly.</p><p>Behind the water curtain, blurry shadows appeared. A slender hand parted the curtain, revealing a person with a fishtail, elegantly swimming out from behind, graceful and refined, as if welcoming guests.</p><p>The Jao people revered women; men were merely dependents, their status low.  Legend attributed this custom to the fact that the Jao's innate abilities were more suited to women, making them the stronger members of the tribe.</p><p>The being before them was indeed a Jao woman.  Her lower body was a long, slender fishtail, its blue scales reflecting shimmering light.  Her upper body was indistinguishable from a human woman, but her skin was exceptionally white, her face stunningly beautiful, with blue hair and blue eyes; her gaze, like gentle ripples, shifted between alluring charm and delicate vulnerability.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shao Shi, possessing strong wills, remained unmoved by her appearance, and both felt a warning in their hearts the moment she appeared.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>Qin Sang, never letting his guard down, immediately activated his sword technique, a sword glow appearing before him.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang and Shao Shi felt the surrounding atmosphere change dramatically; the world turned a brilliant blue.</p><p>In a blink, the void transformed into a body of water; they found themselves unknowingly on the ocean floor.  The seawater, however, was strange – its undulations resembled swirling blue flames.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, beware! This is the Jao's Longming Fire!  It's said to be inextinguishable for ten thousand years; once touched, it becomes an incurable affliction, burning through the marrow."</p><p>Shao Shi urgently transmitted a voice message, simultaneously throwing out a silver light.  The light divided into small silver circles, each containing a powerful but distinct aura.</p><p>These auras came from his companion beasts, clearly a skillful application of their powers.</p><p>A swirling vortex encircled the Shaoshi, its waves repelling the blue flames and protecting him.</p><p>Qin Sang, noting the seriousness of Shaoshi's tone, abandoned the idea of trapping the mermaid with his sword formation.  His Grey Warbler sword flashed, unleashing a brilliant beam of light.</p><p>The sword light, a dazzling arc, forced back the ever-burning flames.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his advantage, his sword light cutting towards the mermaid.  Shaoshi reacted swiftly, releasing four beastly shadows from his silver rings; they roared like thunder and charged towards the mountain peak.</p><p>* * * * *</p><p>The mermaid allowed the sword light to pierce her; her body dispersed like a burst of water.</p><p>Immediately, a peal of laughter echoed from a nearby mountain.  A mass of water coalesced, reforming into the mermaid's shape.</p><p>She smiled, her beautiful eyes fixed on Qin Sang.  "Are you a human cultivator?" she asked in surprise.</p><p>Then, she chided Shaoshi in a sweet yet sharp tone:  "You are the Shaoshi serving the Imperial Seat, aren't you?  How dare you bring an outsider into the sacred grounds!  What is your crime?"</p><p>Shaoshi scoffed, refusing to argue.  "Which princess of the Mermaid Clan dares to ambush this old man?" he growled.</p><p>The Mermaid Clan has an Empress, the supreme ruler.  Talented offspring, recognized by the Empress, are granted the title of Princess.  After passing the Empress's trials, a Princess receives a fiefdom and the title of King.</p><p>Shaoshi knew the names of all the current Mermaid Kings. This mermaid was not well-known, yet she was a late-stage powerhouse, her strength comparable to, if not exceeding, that of the Kings – certainly a Princess.</p><p>The mermaid sneered, "Do we need a reason to ambush your Celestial Department?  Unfortunately, I underestimated you. Leave behind what you found inside, and I’ll let you go. Otherwise, don't think that bringing an adept at the mid-Nascent Soul stage makes you my match!"</p><p>While Shaoshi and the mermaid exchanged words, Qin Sang remained tense.</p><p>He sensed a strange energy locked onto him, searching for an opportunity; another expert was hidden near the mermaid!</p><p>This person's aura was erratic, even the Sky-Eye Butterfly couldn’t pinpoint them precisely. Qin Sang suspected they too used a mirror technique, but more cautiously.</p><p>"I believe we should not engage them further, Qin Xiong. What are your thoughts?" Shaoshi transmitted.</p><p>Retreat without a fight would be embarrassing, but pride was secondary. Continued engagement was not in their best interest.</p><p>They had expected a great opportunity here, but their search had yielded nothing.  A prolonged fight with the mermaid would be difficult, making it even harder to find anything, and they lacked confidence in a guaranteed victory.  The Imperial Seat's affairs were more important; they couldn't waste time here.</p><p>Leaving the dangerous nest was a shame, but both Qin Sang and Shaoshi felt further searching was unlikely to yield anything, and only risked wasted energy.</p><p>The advantages and disadvantages were clear; a decision was easily made.  In fact, even without the mermaid’s interference, they would have given up after further fruitless searching.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to speak, a glint flashed in his eyes, and he looked beyond the battlefield.</p><p>A crimson plume of smoke, vibrant and unusual, was rising on the distant horizon, moving towards them.</p><p>Where the smoke passed, large and small red mushrooms sprouted across the land; the largest were as big as small mountains, the smallest like tiny ants, covering the ground in a dense, countless multitude.</p><p>Shaoshi's expression changed.  "It's the Fungus People!"</p><p>The Fungus People, one of the upper tribes of the Water Department, were said to be even smaller than the Jiaojiao tribe, a tiny people with unique abilities.  Their presence is often marked only by the mushrooms, not their true forms.</p><p>The red smoke accelerated, and the ground seemed to be covered by a carpet of fungi, spreading rapidly towards them.  Only countless red mushrooms were visible; the Fungus People’s location remained unknown.</p><p>They had unexpectedly encountered three waves of Water Department experts, but not a single Celestial Department expert – there was no longer any reason to stay.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the nest's location and the direction the great beast had gone, then immediately joined forces with Shaoshi. Beastly shadows and sword light surged forward.</p><p>The ever-burning flames surged, then countered with even greater force.</p><p>The mermaid, seeing the arrival of the Fungus People, felt she had a superior force and tried to hold Shaoshi and Qin Sang.  But the two worked together seamlessly, never giving the hidden expert a chance to attack, fighting and retreating, until they reached the vicinity of the Unstable Eight Extremes Diagram.</p>
