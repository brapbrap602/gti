<h1>Chapter 1308: The Demon-Hunting War</h1><p>"Cang Hong, it seems you haven't taken the Withered Essence Pill. What a pity, what a pity..."</p><p>Elder Zhenyi, who commanded the Heavenly Alliance, had been at odds with the Abyss of Sin for many years. Cang Hong Zhenren was his long-time rival, and their enmity ran deep. Seeing the Abyss of Sin fall into such a state, Elder Zhenyi couldn't help but gloat and mock, "You all prided yourselves on your unparalleled wisdom, yet you were played like fools by Old Demon Ye, nearly losing everything in the process. When this spreads, the entire world will laugh at you."</p><p>"Old ox-nose, if an opportunity for a breakthrough were placed before you, I don't believe you wouldn't be tempted," Cang Hong Zhenren retorted with a cold laugh.</p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at Qu Huan, knowing full well that the secret must have been leaked by this traitor. Due to Qu Huan's betrayal, the Abyss of Sin could no longer conceal its predicament, and their situation had worsened. Negotiations would now be far more difficult.</p><p>Qu Huan stood beside Elder Zhenyi, a faint smile on his lips as he nodded in greeting, utterly unbothered. Having dared to betray the Abyss of Sin, he had no fear of offending anyone.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren's eyes flashed with disdain, but he chose not to engage.</p><p>Elder Zhenyi's expression stiffened at the words.</p><p>Old Demon Ye's schemes were deep and his plans long in the making. Even they might have fallen into his trap.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren had been cautious enough, testing the pill's effects on juniors and enduring for so long without taking the Withered Essence Pill himself. Otherwise, the Abyss of Sin might have been completely wiped out by Old Demon Ye this time.</p><p>"I'm quite curious," Qin Sang suddenly interjected. "What exactly happened during the demon-hunting expedition at the Sin God Palace back then? Why did so many of you fall into the trap without realizing it? Could you enlighten us, Zhenren?"</p><p>If it was Old Demon Ye's scheme, was the demon truly dead or merely feigning death? The Sin God Palace sealed the demon, and the aura of the Nether Crystal Tower was similar to that of the Demon Lord. Connecting these dots gave Qin Sang a bad premonition, and he knew he had to be cautious. He had no desire to face the Demon Lord again.</p><p>Qu Huan didn't know the details, but Cang Hong Zhenren had been there personally. Perhaps they could glean something from his account.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren didn't hold back and nodded to Qin Sang. "Since Fellow Daoist Qin wishes to know, I will recount the events in full. After all, there's no need to keep these secrets any longer."</p><p>"Thank you, Zhenren," Qin Sang said, cupping his hands in a respectful bow.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun and the others were also intrigued.</p><p>For a moment, it seemed everyone had forgotten about the negotiations.</p><p>The battle raged on, the sounds of killing shaking the heavens.</p><p>The earth trembled, and the golden barrier flickered unsteadily.</p><p>In the east, the sky was painted with clouds, and the golden light of the rising sun spilled onto the platform.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren's face took on a reminiscing expression as he pondered for a moment before speaking. "Even after all these years, I remember it vividly. The Sin God Palace is similar to the Blood Lake—both are places where great demons and fiends were sealed and suppressed. In ancient times, they were likely part of the same entity. Thus, the scenery within the Sin God Palace is entirely different from that of the Purple Palace, with numerous sealed areas scattered throughout. Over the years, we've broken many of these seals, and the demons within had all perished—except for one. That demon was an exception. A fellow Daoist discovered the sealed demon's location and nearly broke the seal. Fortunately, he sensed something amiss at the last moment and sent out a warning before the demon could devour him. The demon had been tortured for who knows how many years, losing its sanity and becoming bloodthirsty and frenzied. We gathered at the sealed location and engaged in a fierce battle with the demon."</p><p>At this point, Cang Hong Zhenren sighed deeply, a flicker of regret crossing his face. "Old Demon Ye wasn't present at the time. The demon was incredibly powerful, and we were no match for it. We had no choice but to call in Old Demon Ye and others for assistance. When we performed a soul search on the demon, to prevent Old Demon Ye from tampering with it, Fellow Daoist Tianzheng and I personally conducted the search.</p><p>"All of you should know that the higher the cultivation level of the target, the more difficult it is to perform a soul search. They always have some means of defense.</p><p>"Fortunately, the demon had been tortured to the point of losing its sanity. With the help of a secret treasure from the Star Constellation Sect, we managed to extract some fragments from the demon's shattered soul.</p><p>"This was also why we never suspected Old Demon Ye.</p><p>"The Withered Essence Pill was obtained from the soul search, but the method to refine the Nether Crystal Tower was actually discovered by a fellow Daoist from the Star Constellation Sect while exploring another secret realm. Who could have guessed that both were part of Old Demon Ye's scheme?</p><p>"As for whether Old Demon Ye had long been in cahoots with the demon, or if the demon was merely a pawn in his hands, we cannot say for certain."</p><p>After listening to Cang Hong Zhenren's account, Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances. They knew Cang Hong Zhenren must have concealed some secrets, but the events he described were likely true.</p><p>Qin Sang then asked Cang Hong Zhenren about the demon's methods of attack.</p><p>Qin Sang's questions were detailed, and though Cang Hong Zhenren didn't understand his intentions, he carefully recalled the events. In truth, the demon had been utterly frenzied at the time, and there was no discernible pattern to its attacks.</p><p>After the questioning, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>From Cang Hong Zhenren's description, the demon had never used any soul attacks similar to the Soul-Splitting Slash.</p><p>"Are you certain that demon was completely destroyed?" Tongyou Mojun asked with a frown.</p><p>"The demon's soul was shattered before my very eyes. We were always vigilant against Old Demon Ye, so he had no opportunity to tamper with it. There couldn't have been any remnants of the demon's soul! In front of so many people, the demon couldn't have easily controlled Old Demon Ye. If his personality had drastically changed, it would have been difficult to hide. We can be certain that from start to finish, it was all Old Demon Ye's scheme. The important question is what role Old Demon Ye played behind the scenes," Cang Hong Zhenren explained.</p><p>"So, you suffered a great loss and still don't understand Old Demon Ye's intentions?" Elder Zhenyi sneered, then shifted the topic back to the negotiations. "Since you wish to negotiate, why not show some sincerity first? Hand over the method to refine the Nether Crystal Tower."</p><p>The Nether Crystal Tower was undoubtedly a devastating weapon on the battlefield.</p><p>The Abyss of Sin's monopoly over the Nether Crystal Tower had always been a threat.</p><p>Only by relinquishing the Nether Crystal Tower could they ensure they weren't releasing a tiger back into the mountains.</p><p>"Fine!"</p><p>To everyone's surprise, Cang Hong Zhenren agreed without hesitation. He immediately took out a jade slip and placed it between the two sides.</p><p>"This contains the refinement method."</p><p>The five members of the Two Domains Alliance were astonished but quickly realized there must be a catch.</p><p>Over the years, the Two Domains Alliance's Nether Crystal Towers had remained the same in number, with no new additions.</p><p>The intact Nether Crystal Towers had been destroyed by Old Demon Ye.</p><p>It was likely that something crucial was missing, making it impossible to refine new Nether Crystal Towers!</p><p>"Does refining the Nether Crystal Tower require some extremely苛刻的条件?" Qu Huan asked, puzzled. Though he held some status in the Abyss of Sin, he had never been privy to the core secrets.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren didn't answer immediately. After a slight pause, he said, "In addition to the Nether Crystal Tower, there's another condition you cannot refuse. The Abyss of Sin is willing to open the Sin God Palace to the Two Domains. From now on, you can enter the Purple Palace through the Sin God Palace without expending vast resources to set up protective formations and bypass the Purple Palace's guardian immortal array."</p><p>This condition was indeed highly enticing.</p><p>Doing so would cause no loss to the Abyss of Sin, as the Sin God Palace was far inferior to the Purple Palace. Everything easily accessible had already been explored, and the focus of future contention would be the treasures within the Purple Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others weren't fools. They quickly sensed that Cang Hong Zhenren's offer to invite them into the Sin God Palace must have an ulterior motive. Qin Sang exclaimed in shock, "Has Old Demon Ye fled into the Sin God Palace?"</p>
