<h1>Chapter 2156: Another Battle</h1><p>“Unexpected things happen…,”</p><p>The Lesser Master trailed off, chuckling nervously. He glanced at Ji Qiong and the other fleeing cultivator. “Compared to them, we’re lucky. Those two are the unlucky ones; they’ve probably stumbled into the path of that powerful beast, hence the panic.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the source of the oppressive aura, then at Ji Qiong and the other cultivator, noticing something unusual. “They don’t seem to be the beast’s target…”</p><p>As they spoke, the two cultivators stealthily retreated, carefully concealing themselves.</p><p>They weren't sure of the exact strength of a Unity Stage beast, but they knew that if this beast set its sights on them, their chances of survival would be slim.</p><p>They dared not make any sudden moves, fearing they would attract the beast’s attention.</p><p>“They don't even qualify to be hunted by such a beast!”</p><p>The Lesser Master stated firmly, “One strike from that beast, and we would have to retreat, let alone those two!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. The Lesser Master was right; if Ji Qiong and the other cultivator provoked the beast, they wouldn’t even have a chance to escape.</p><p>Considering this, Qin Sang mused, “Right now, there aren’t many teams in the Sacred Land that could confidently defeat both of us, and even if three or five people teamed up, they wouldn't dare provoke the beast. Time is short; our fellow experts won't be able to assemble quickly. Organizing multiple experts to hunt the beast is also impossible. So, who angered the beast?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Lesser Master’s expression shifted.  “Unless someone was unfortunate enough to stumble into the beast’s lair, or foolish enough to enter it on their own, this beast might not have been angered! The first two scenarios are almost impossible. Could there have been an unknown event that caused the beast to leave its lair?”</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal.</p><p>They continued to retreat swiftly, both keeping a close watch on the beast’s movements.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the distant east, a gray fog was rapidly spreading across the land.  Wherever the fog passed, death followed.  Flowers, trees, and plants withered instantly, sprouting gray fuzz that consumed their life, reducing them to mush in the blink of an eye – no plant, sacred or otherwise, was spared.</p><p>Beasts dwelling in the path of the fog suffered greatly; some, still asleep in their lairs, were unaware of the approaching death and perished without a struggle.</p><p>Their bodies grew covered in the gray fuzz, rapidly decaying into skeletons, transforming the area into a desolate graveyard.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A deafening roar echoed from within the fog.  On the surface of a large lake, countless decaying skeletons floated, the skeletal frames immense, suggesting the creatures had once been huge and powerful.</p><p>Among the bones, a beast, only half the size of the skeletons but with a similar structure, still lived. It was the sole survivor in the area, its aura comparable to that of a Void Refinement cultivator, possibly the reason for its survival.</p><p>However, this beast trembled violently, its eyes filled with terror and agony. Fear seemed to override its ferocious instincts.  It leaped ashore and fled wildly, but the fog's power relentlessly corroded it. Gray fuzz sprouted on its body, suppressed by its own strength, only to reappear elsewhere, causing it to stumble erratically.</p><p>Suddenly, a colossal shadow appeared above the fog, obscuring the sky.</p><p>From the shadow, an enormous bird claw descended.</p><p>The claw had three toes, its skin rough as vines, like a celestial pillar plunging from the heavens, landing directly in the path of the fleeing beast.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Several mountain peaks were crushed, shattering into pieces, leaving three long trenches and a deep claw mark in the earth. The claw lifted, and silence reigned. The beast lay lifeless, without even a semblance of resistance, crushed in an instant.</p><p>This seemingly accidental strike seemed to be just that – accidental. The bird's owner never appeared, showing no pause, and the shadowy fog sped away.</p><p>…</p><p>In the distance,</p><p>Qin Sang and the Lesser Master, having confirmed the beast wasn't targeting them, finally relaxed slightly.</p><p>"Qin Zhenren, what do you think happened in the beast's lair?" the Lesser Master pondered.</p><p>"Surely not another beast attacking," Qin Sang said.</p><p>The Lesser Master replied, "These powerful beasts have their territories, generally avoiding others' domains. But something extraordinary must have happened to drive the beast away, perhaps something beneficial is hidden within."</p><p>Pausing, the Shaoshi looked in the direction Ji Qiong and the other had fled, saying, "A change at the lair of the great beast must have had signs.  They may have seen something."</p><p>"Daoist Si wants to capture them?"</p><p>Qin Sang also looked up. To avoid the great beast, they had retreated a considerable distance, and Ji Qiong and his companion had vanished from sight.</p><p>However, knowing the direction of Ji Qiong's escape, finding them again wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>"Isn't that person an old enemy of Realperson Qin?  Realperson Qin won't stop this old man, will they?"</p><p>Shaoshi glanced at Qin Sang.  "If Realperson Qin lets them off, they won't appreciate it. The struggle for the sacred lands ultimately boils down to a fight between the Celestial and Water Departments.  Realperson Qin entered using our Siyou clan's mirage tower, meaning they bear the mark of the Celestial Department.  If a Water Department expert encounters Realperson Qin, unless a greater benefit entices them into a temporary alliance, they will show no mercy."</p><p>Qin Sang already understood this; he didn't need Shaoshi to explain.  The so-called sacred land trials ultimately revolved around the struggle between the Celestial and Water Departments.</p><p>But Qin Sang only had a superficial understanding, to avoid inadvertently breaking a taboo; he had no intention of participating.</p><p>This didn't concern him, an outsider.  Regardless of how precious the treasures were, they might not suit an outsider cultivator.  Even if he managed to obtain them, it would be difficult to leave with them under everyone's watchful eyes.</p><p>His identity, masked by the power of spirit pills, would be exposed upon engaging in combat.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose in entering the sacred land was clear: reunite with Liuli as soon as possible. If things went smoothly, he could remain on the sidelines, waiting for an opportunity that suited him before acting.</p><p>His concern was that attacking Ji Qiong now would attract the great beast, and perhaps something even more terrifying behind it.</p><p>Shaoshi knew what Qin Sang was worried about. "Let's secretly follow them. We can strike once we reach a safe area.  There won't be many cultivators in the same region, so we don't have to worry about others beating us to it."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, and the two immediately changed direction, secretly following.</p><p>…</p><p>In a mountain valley, Ji Qiong and another Quanfeng cultivator were both shaken. Ji Qiong stared intently outside the valley, his companion concentrating on sensing.</p><p>"What's the situation?" Ji Qiong couldn't help but ask. His cultivation was slightly lower, and his spiritual perception less keen than his companion's.</p><p>"That oppressive aura has moved far away," his companion said softly, opening his eyes.</p><p>Ji Qiong felt relieved, but couldn't help grumbling, "Thank goodness it wasn't coming for us! What bad luck we have, encountering a great beast, possibly a Saint-level one, right after entering the sacred lands!"</p><p>His companion sighed, "I wonder why that great beast left its lair. We were just caught in the crossfire! We left too many traces while escaping. That great beast might return. We shouldn't stay here long; let's leave quickly."</p><p>"Good!" Ji Qiong nodded repeatedly.  "The sooner we meet up with Elder Quan, the better!"</p><p>His companion looked at him. "Aren't you going to get the Elephant Soul Sand? Refining it should allow you to break through to the mid-stage, making our travels in the sacred lands safer."</p><p>"Let's confirm our location first. If it's on the way, we'll try to get the Elephant Soul Sand. Otherwise, we'll meet up with Elder Quan and ask for his help," Ji Qiong said. The great beast had taught him a lesson—only beside Elder Quan did he feel safe.</p><p>"Elder Quan truly values you!"</p><p>A flash of envy crossed his companion's eyes.  He vanished in a flash, escaping towards the valley entrance. Ji Qiong also used his movement technique to follow, but as soon as he flew out of the valley, the surroundings suddenly darkened. The sacred lands had a clear day and night cycle, just like the outside world, and it was daytime; now it had suddenly become night.</p><p>The earth and mountains disappeared into thin air, and he was pulled into a boundless starry sky, surrounded by brilliant starlight and countless stars.</p><p>The familiar scene made Ji Qiong pause, triggering unpleasant memories, and then he felt utterly baffled.</p><p>"How is this possible! That person is either human or a demon beast; how could they be here? Could it be...?"</p><p>In an instant, countless thoughts raced through his mind.</p><p>However, Ji Qiong's reaction wasn't affected. The moment he fell into the sword array, he threw out a black seed. It was almost a repeat of history; Ji Qiong had almost died trying to break the sword array with this treasure.</p><p>Vines took root and sprouted, sending out branches; before they resembled snakes, now they were like giant pythons, far more powerful than before.  This time, he didn't let the vines occupy the sword array but surrounded himself, layer upon layer, forming a solid barrier for self-preservation.</p><p>However, Ji Qiong quickly noticed something was wrong.</p><p>The previous sword formation only showed stars in the west and south. Now, the east also shines brightly, only the north remains a chaotic nebula.</p><p>This means the enemy is growing stronger!</p><p>Even more shocking to Ji Qiong was his inability to sense his companion despite fully activating his spiritual hearing. Before entering the sacred ground, he and his companion had jointly refined a treasure, controlled by his companion. Even if he was trapped, his companion could contact him through this treasure, and they could work together to break through.</p><p>Now, there's no response from his companion. Did his companion not even have a chance to use the treasure, or were they trapped and killed?</p><p>The enemy certainly came in pairs. The other person is likely a master from the Siyou tribe. If his companion wasn't a match for them…</p><p>Ji Qiong felt increasingly terrified, recalling past events. If he had already broken through to the mid-stage, he might have a fighting chance, but now he had no confidence in defeating Qin Sang.</p><p>Those who cultivate to this level rarely hesitate. Besides, Ji Qiong had suffered a significant loss at the hands of Qin Sang.</p><p>A bad feeling rose in his heart. Ji Qiong hesitated no longer. Before the full power of the sword formation could be unleashed, his blood surged. His skin turned blood-red, blood oozed from his pores, and his body became like a bloody gourd.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>With a loud explosion, Ji Qiong's physical body burst apart, his flesh and organs scattering.</p><p>Qin Sang had destroyed one of his bodies before, but that was passive; this was a deliberate self-destruction.  With his cultivation, regaining his body would cost him dearly.  Last time, he benefited from Elder Quan's gift, but this self-destruction might severely impact his breakthrough.</p><p>But some things take priority. As long as he could escape and obtain the Elephant Soul Sand, he would eventually break through.</p><p>Therefore, Ji Qiong decisively self-destructed. His blood and flesh contained tremendous power, exploding like a blood cloud across the stars, staining the starlight crimson. The vines transformed into countless blood pythons, savagely attacking the stars.</p><p>As the blood cloud crashed into the sword formation, a white light flashed where Ji Qiong had been, revealing a naked figure.</p><p>Ji Qiong instantly materialized his astral body, making no attempt to break through the sword formation. He stood motionless, opening his mouth and tilting his head skyward, letting out a long howl.</p><p>The shrill cry, containing strange power, created invisible ripples in the void, spreading rapidly.  The stars had just been struck by the blood cloud, and the howl seized the opportunity to break through the sword formation's blockade.</p><p>Qin Sang observed Ji Qiong's every move, understanding his intent.  He secretly admired the man's ruthlessness and decisiveness. He realized the danger; the self-destruction was a desperate gamble, attempting to attract the great beast.</p><p>If Ji Qiong succeeded, he and Shaoshi would have to abandon their mission, giving Ji Qiong a chance to survive.</p><p>Even if they couldn't escape, dying together with the enemy wasn't a total loss.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ji Qiong didn't know what kind of enemy they faced.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Ji Qiong coldly, making no move. Just as the howl was about to break through the blockade and echo through the heavens, a cold snort sounded.</p><p>"Quite the character!"</p><p>A furry hand, like a bear's paw, large as a mountain, appeared in the sky and struck down mercilessly. It shattered the ripples caused by the howl and, to Ji Qiong's horror, reached for him.</p><p>Ji Qiong's fate was sealed.</p><p>Qin Sang looked away, toward the outside of the formation.</p><p>He and Shaoshi had divided their tasks for a swift victory, targeting Ji Qiong for capture, leading to this entire ordeal. Shaoshi had brought the Undecided Eight Extremes Diagram, trapping the other person within.  Despite being damaged during the battle with the Lu King, the Diagram remained a priceless treasure.</p><p>No longer paying attention to the battle, Qin Sang retracted the sword formation and dashed into the diagram.</p><p>Before long, the two quietly left the valley, fleeing without looking back until they could barely sense the great beast's pressure.</p><p>Shaoshi successfully captured Ji Qiong and took him aside for interrogation.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang heard Shaoshi say, "We were right.  Something happened at the great beast's lair. This man saw a brilliant light erupting from where the beast came, confirming it wasn't another beast chasing it."</p><p>"Does Daoist Si wish to investigate?" Qin Sang asked gravely.</p><p>He had left his name in the Tai Xu Golden Book and needed to fully assist the Si Emperor, avoiding complications.  But Shaoshi was the Si Emperor's confidant, and even he wasn't worried; Qin Sang wasn't concerned about delaying the important task.</p><p>"Master Qin, aren't you curious what could drive away the great beast? Based on past experience, it could be a newly appeared hidden realm or a future exit from the sacred ground. Either way, it's an opportunity not to be missed. If we're afraid to even take a look, what are we even doing here?" Shaoshi countered.</p>
