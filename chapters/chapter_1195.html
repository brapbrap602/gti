<h1>Chapter 1187: A Great Victory</h1><p>"Ah!"</p><p>Jing Lin's primordial spirit was struck with excruciating pain. His face turned deathly pale, and he clutched his head, letting out a piercing scream of agony. His entire body trembled violently.</p><p>The divine light of the Wind-Summoning Bracelet dimmed.</p><p>The same scene unfolded before Qin Sang.</p><p>With the Jade Buddha protecting him, Qin Sang had no fear of even the Soul-Splitting Slash, let alone a mere Soul-Devouring Spike. However, the recent discovery forced him to reconsider.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of revealing his ability to resist soul attacks at this moment. But if he were to feign injury, he would no longer be able to control the Twelve Demon Banners, and the hard-won opportunity to strike would be lost, allowing the Demon Lord Pei to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang, ever decisive, immediately changed his strategy upon realizing the complexity of the Soul-Devouring Spike. He altered his incantation, and the sound of heavenly thunder resonated within his body.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The round shield shattered.</p><p>The Soul-Devouring Spike pierced Qin Sang's brow, but as expected, it was blocked by the Jade Buddha.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's performance was even more pitiful than Jing Lin's. He let out a series of agonized screams, blood streaming from his seven orifices, and staggered, nearly collapsing to the ground.</p><p>Over the years, such acts of deception had become second nature to him, executed flawlessly without the slightest hint of a flaw.</p><p>The Twelve Demon Banners' formation crumbled without resistance. The banners tilted, and the demonic flames scattered, revealing gaps.</p><p>Demon Lord Pei saw a glimmer of hope.</p><p>But before he could even show a hint of joy, a sudden thunderclap on a clear day plunged him into utter despair.</p><p>A blinding flash of lightning.</p><p>Divine thunder descended from the heavens.</p><p>The demonic flames dispersed, and the Obsidian Tower shook violently.</p><p>In a desperate bid for survival, Demon Lord Pei had sacrificed himself to activate the Obsidian Tower, severely depleting his vitality. Before the Thunder Commanding Art, he was like a lamb to the slaughter, utterly defenseless.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Under the watchful eyes of all, Demon Lord Pei was struck directly by the heavenly thunder. His body turned charred, and his corpse plummeted to the ground.</p><p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Zen Ling and Demon Lord Tan, intending to rescue him, had not even managed to break through the Frost Bell Formation when they witnessed Demon Lord Pei being struck by lightning. Not even his nascent soul escaped; he was utterly annihilated!</p><p>The two were filled with shock and fury.</p><p>Their opponents were clearly three early-stage Nascent Soul level experts, weaker than themselves.</p><p>Yet, in a three-on-three battle, they had managed to kill Demon Lord Pei right before their eyes.</p><p>Demon Lord Pei had sacrificed himself, yet still failed to survive.</p><p>Zen Ling was enraged, unsure of how to explain this upon his return.</p><p>Demon Lord Tan rushed towards the Obsidian Tower to prevent Qin Sang and his allies from destroying the formation, while Zen Ling gave chase.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Jing Lin, slightly recovered, saw Qin Sang use thunder magic to kill Demon Lord Pei. Overjoyed, he was also deeply concerned.</p><p>Both of them had suffered soul injuries. If they were intercepted by Zen Ling and Demon Lord Tan, the outcome would be uncertain.</p><p>Suppressing his injuries, Jing Lin quickly retrieved the Wind-Summoning Bracelet and transformed into a gust of green wind, escaping back into the Frost Bell Formation from another direction. Skilled in wind manipulation, he had grasped the basics of Wind Evasion, making his escape speed naturally fast.</p><p>Qin Sang, unharmed, was not afraid of Zen Ling, but he also did not want to reveal that he was uninjured. After all, he had used his two strongest trump cards to kill Demon Lord Pei.</p><p>Of course, he did not forget to take his spoils of war.</p><p>Qin Sang collected the demon banners and Demon Lord Pei's corpse. Without time to destroy the Obsidian Tower's formation, he transformed into a bolt of lightning and sped away.</p><p>Zen Ling and Demon Lord Tan attempted to intercept, but were fiercely entangled by Si Di. In the end, they could only watch helplessly as Qin Sang and Jing Lin escaped into the Frost Bell Formation, leaving them fuming with rage.</p><p>"These are Jade Dew Pills, capable of healing soul injuries. Fellow Daoists, take them quickly!"</p><p>Si Di flicked his fingers, sending two pills flying towards them.</p><p>The pills were crystal clear, resembling two drops of jade dew.</p><p>"I've long heard that Jade Dew Pills are miraculous healing pills, far surpassing those crafted by the Two Realms Alliance. The spiritual materials required are incredibly rare. Now, I finally see them in person."</p><p>Jing Lin swallowed the pill, unable to hide his excitement. He turned to Qin Sang, no longer looking down on him. "This time, it was all thanks to Fellow Daoist Mingyue! I thought we would return empty-handed."</p><p>Jing Lin was still shaken.</p><p>When the Soul-Devouring Spike struck him, he knew killing Demon Lord Pei was impossible. Yet, the result far exceeded his expectations.</p><p>"Indeed! With Fellow Daoist Mingyue's abilities, if not for the Soul-Devouring Spike, you could have taken on Zen Ling alone. Demon Lord Pei, who had been rampant for years, fell at your hands. Who would have thought you had just advanced to the Nascent Soul stage!"</p><p>Si Di was full of admiration.</p><p>From a distance, he had seen everything clearly.</p><p>The process of assassinating Demon Lord Pei was full of twists and turns. Qin Sang first summoned the Twelve Fire Banners, then called down heavenly thunder at the critical moment. Each move was a top-tier divine ability.</p><p>He silently warned himself never to make an enemy of this man.</p><p>It was a pity such a figure was not from the human race.</p><p>"I dare not take all the credit. Without the cooperation of you two, even with all my abilities, I could not have succeeded. Now is not the time to talk. Zen Ling is not to be underestimated. Be careful, I will return to take charge of the Frost Bell Formation."</p><p>Qin Sang grasped the Jade Dew Pill and spoke solemnly.</p><p>"Right! Right!"</p><p>Jing Lin nodded repeatedly, already deferring to Qin Sang. He sneered, "With one Nascent Soul dead, their morale is in disarray. Let's see how long they can hold out. We brothers will go and face Zen Ling!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and flew back into the formation.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang leave, Jing Lin and Si Di exchanged a glance, a hint of awe in their eyes.</p><p>What followed was straightforward.</p><p>After Demon Lord Pei's death, the morale of the Sin Abyss forces crumbled, and they had no will to fight.</p><p>In contrast, the Two Realms Alliance's morale soared.</p><p>Qin Sang took control of the formation device, presiding over the Frost Bell Formation and orchestrating various changes to provide reinforcements.</p><p>For a time, the Two Realms Alliance was unstoppable, forcing the Sin Abyss forces to flee in disarray. Even though Demon Lord Tan reclaimed the Obsidian Tower and Zen Ling remained, they could not turn the tide.</p><p>More importantly, Zen Ling no longer had the desire to continue fighting.</p><p>Demon Lord Pei's death sent shivers down Zen Ling's spine.</p><p>At the same time, he secretly rejoiced that it was Demon Lord Pei who had tested the waters, not himself.</p><p>He harbored deep apprehension towards that unfamiliar demon king, vowing to keep a close eye on him in the future.</p><p>Zen Ling suspected that his exposure might also be the work of the demon king. He needed to thoroughly review this battle to understand where they had gone wrong.</p><p>If this demon king truly was his nemesis, he would have another formidable foe to avoid in the future.</p><p>Leaving behind a field of corpses, Zen Ling hastily withdrew his troops from the Triple Pass.</p><p>The battle ended abruptly.</p><p>The enemy's Obsidian Tower still stood, and they had two Nascent Soul level combatants. Jing Lin and Si Di, knowing when to stop, did not pursue far and soon called for a retreat.</p><p>Although there were inevitable casualties, this was undoubtedly a great victory. It had been a long time since the Two Realms Alliance had managed to kill a Nascent Soul ancestor of the Sin Abyss.</p><p>The low-level cultivators cheered with excitement, as they too would benefit, earning a considerable amount of battle merits.</p><p>Si Di and Jing Lin arranged for the cleanup of the battlefield and made various preparations to prevent a counterattack from the Sin Abyss. Then, they eagerly flew towards the high tower.</p><p>Qin Sang did not participate in the pursuit.</p><p>He sat there, head slightly lowered, deep in thought.</p><p>Sensing the approach of Jing Lin and Si Di, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he turned to look outside.</p>
