<h1>Chapter 1171: The Gap</h1><p>The Serpent King glanced around and pointed to two distant peaks, drawing a circle in the air with his finger. "The battlefield is confined to the open area between these two mountains. Whoever flies beyond this boundary will be considered defeated."</p><p>Qin Sang and the Chain Mechanism Demon King both nodded in agreement, accepting the rules.</p><p>With the rules set, the Serpent King flashed to a nearby peak to observe the battle, while Qin Sang and the Chain Mechanism Demon King flew into the designated battlefield.</p><p>Between the two mountains lay a vast, open space, resembling an arena.</p><p>They stood at opposite ends of the battlefield, gazing at each other from afar.</p><p>The auras of the most powerful beings in the cultivation world radiated outward, their terrifying pressure causing the birds and beasts in the surrounding mountains to flee in panic.</p><p>Qin Sang's Ebony Sword had not yet fully formed, so he had no choice but to use another spiritual sword as a substitute.</p><p>At this moment, he had already activated the Heavenly Demon Transformation, and with his other hand, he secretly formed a hand seal, ready to summon his Demon Banner at any moment.</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King had come prepared, and Qin Sang knew he had to give it his all.</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King's eyes were like those of a serpentâ€”vertical pupils that exuded a cold, piercing gaze. Without any overt expression, his stare alone was enough to send chills down the spine of anyone who met it.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Qin Sang sent a streak of sword light flying from his fingertips.</p><p>The spiritual sword circled around Qin Sang, emitting sharp, ear-piercing whistles. The air around him shimmered with countless real and illusory sword lights, intertwining and overlapping.</p><p>For a moment, Qin Sang's figure was completely obscured by the dazzling sword lights, making it difficult to discern his true position with the naked eye.</p><p>This was the first time Qin Sang was truly facing an opponent at the Nascent Soul level. He was extremely cautious and chose not to take the initiative. Instead, he decided to gauge his opponent's strength by reacting to their moves.</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King had long known of Qin Sang's mastery of sword techniques, so he showed no surprise at this display.</p><p>With a cold glance at Qin Sang, the Chain Mechanism Demon King's face suddenly darkened as a layer of black mist began to spread across his features. He then opened his mouth wide and exhaled several thick clouds of black fog.</p><p>The black fog was unusually dense and rapidly expanded the moment it appeared.</p><p>The fog wasn't directly aimed at Qin Sang. Instead, it quickly spread in all directions before converging, soon enveloping the entire battlefield.</p><p>In an instant, the battlefield was plunged into complete darkness, so thick that one couldn't see their own hand in front of their face.</p><p>The black fog closed in around Qin Sang, surrounding him completely.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang caught a faint whiff of a sweet fragrance. His expression changed slightly, and he immediately sealed his mouth and nose, circulating his true essence to block any contact with the black fog.</p><p>He attempted to disperse the fog, but it continued to replenish itself endlessly.</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King was a serpent demon, and this black fog was likely a divine ability he had cultivated over many years, containing a potent venom that couldn't be underestimated.</p><p>If only the Fat Silkworm were awake, Qin Sang thought. The toxicity of this fog, no matter how fierce, couldn't compare to the three great poison zones of the Seven Slaughter Hall. With his Poison-Resistant Armor, he wouldn't have to worry at all.</p><p>After breaking through to the Nascent Soul stage, Qin Sang had tried multiple times to communicate with Ya Gu and the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>But he had received no response.</p><p>Ya Gu was "asleep" even more deeply than before.</p><p>In the past, the Fat Silkworm had served as an anchor, allowing Qin Sang to sense fluctuations in Ya Gu's soul. But now that the anchor was also dormant, Ya Gu's body was completely lifeless.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the Soul-Nurturing Wood; otherwise, he wouldn't know if Ya Gu could hold on much longer.</p><p>Though Qin Sang was worried about Ya Gu, there was little he could do for now. Bai hadn't yet finished refining the Corpse Soul Pearl, so Qin Sang could only follow the clues left by Tan Hao to investigate the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>*Sizzle...*</p><p>The black fog began to corrode Qin Sang's spiritual armor.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly to himself. The damage was still within acceptable limits and wouldn't be too much of a burden in the short term.</p><p>Although the black fog obstructed his vision, it couldn't block his Heavenly Eye technique.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around and realized that the entire battlefield was enveloped in the black fog. He thought to himself that the Chain Mechanism Demon King had clearly come prepared, and even the boundaries of the battlefield had been calculated in advance.</p><p>Going to such lengths, it was unlikely that the Chain Mechanism Demon King's goal was simply to drain Qin Sang's true essence. The black fog likely had other, unknown purposes.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang's expression hardened as he noticed the Chain Mechanism Demon King moving.</p><p>A figure silently closed in on him.</p><p>Within the black fog, the Chain Mechanism Demon King concealed himself perfectly, leaving no trace of his presence.</p><p>Unfortunately, under the Heavenly Eye technique, his efforts were in vain.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The sound of a sword's hum echoed loudly as a streak of sword light slashed deep into the black fog.</p><p>The fog rippled, and a shadowy figure flickered in and out of sight.</p><p>At this moment, the Chain Mechanism Demon King was still some distance away from Qin Sang. Seeing that his stealth had been compromised, a ferocious expression flashed across his face, and he let out a low growl before surging forward with incredible speed, like a great eagle swooping down on its prey.</p><p>The speed the Chain Mechanism Demon King displayed now surprised even Qin Sang.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered and vanished from his original position.</p><p>A bolt of lightning pierced through the black fog as Qin Sang's first instinct was to use his Thunder Evasion technique to avoid the direct confrontation.</p><p>However, his suspicions were soon confirmed. Flying through the black fog felt strangely restrictive, as if some unseen force was slowing him down.</p><p>In contrast, the Chain Mechanism Demon King moved with several times more agility than before.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang moved, the Chain Mechanism Demon King immediately discerned his direction and gave chase.</p><p>At the same time, the black fog around Qin Sang seemed to come alive, twisting into indescribable shapes that entangled him. Although Qin Sang quickly shattered them, they still managed to hinder him to some extent.</p><p>Amid the rolling black fog, the two began a fierce chase.</p><p>In truth, the Chain Mechanism Demon King's evasion techniques were inferior to Qin Sang's. But within the black fog, he moved like a fish in water, incredibly nimble.</p><p>The battlefield was limited in size, and Qin Sang couldn't fully utilize his Thunder Evasion technique. Moreover, the black fog further restricted him. As a result, he found himself unable to shake off the Chain Mechanism Demon King.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that dragging this out would only work to the Chain Mechanism Demon King's advantage.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang suddenly came to an abrupt halt and turned to face the Chain Mechanism Demon King, who was hot on his heels. A cold glint flashed in his eyes as he chose not to wield his spiritual sword but instead charged straight at his opponent.</p><p>Qin Sang closed the distance in a flash, his fist hurtling toward the Chain Mechanism Demon King's face like a thunderbolt.</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King's expression shifted slightly, but then a cold smile spread across his face. He reached out with his right hand, and the surrounding black fog surged toward his arm.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, his arm transformed into a black serpent, twisting and coiling unnaturally as it clamped down on Qin Sang's fist.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The collision was not particularly loud, but it was direct and unadorned.</p><p>The two figures recoiled from the impact, each flying back several feet.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist, feeling a strange, insidious force spreading through his body. A tingling numbness traveled from his fingers to his shoulder, and he quickly circulated his true essence to dispel it.</p><p>He hadn't gained any advantage; in fact, he had suffered a minor setback.</p><p>The Demon King's physical body was indeed formidable.</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King was especially skilled in close-quarters combat.</p><p>In comparison, Qin Sang had relied primarily on sword techniques and magical treasures throughout his cultivation journey. He had rarely engaged in pure physical combat, and this encounter highlighted the gap between them.</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King shook his arm and looked at Qin Sang with a mocking smile, having already discerned that Qin Sang's combat skills were lacking.</p><p>*Condense!*</p><p>The Chain Mechanism Demon King muttered under his breath, and the demonic fog gathered around him once more, forming a set of black armor. He then crossed his arms and lunged at Qin Sang with lightning speed.</p><p>In that moment, all Qin Sang could see were two serpentine shadows, each containing countless variations!</p>
