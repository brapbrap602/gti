<h1>Chapter 1105: An Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>Chapter 1105: An Unexpected Encounter</p><p>The world of cultivation is unpredictable.</p><p>Before leaving, he left Mei Gu with limited resources; for a sect, it was a drop in the ocean.</p><p>Such a weak sect, located in the Demon Path territory, had somehow survived.</p><p>A century-long war saw the decline and fall of countless top sects and powers.  Many were completely annihilated.</p><p>Among them, the once dominant Pure Yang Sect in Xiao Han Region gradually faded after the death of the Red-haired Ancestor.</p><p>Meanwhile, Shao Hua Mountain and Dong Yang Bo's influence grew.</p><p>The rise and fall of sects is common.  It’s surprising that the Demon Flame Sect managed to survive.</p><p>“So you are a disciple of the Demon Flame Sect.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, speaking kindly. “Many years ago, I met a cultivator named Mei Gu. She was from the Demon Flame Sect, and I heard she was the sect leader.”</p><p>“Senior knows the Sect Master?”</p><p>The young man exclaimed, “I was rude and blind. Please forgive my offense, Senior.”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively, continuing, “Is Mei still the sect leader? When we met, she was only at the Foundation Establishment stage. After all these years, she should have reached the Core Formation stage, right?”</p><p>The young man nodded repeatedly. “The Sect Master reached Core Formation many years ago. My current cultivation is thanks to her guidance.”</p><p>“I remember Mei Gu was very worried about the Demon Flame Sect.  For her to lead the sect to this day and achieve Core Formation herself is truly remarkable.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, genuinely impressed.</p><p>He reflected on his own arduous journey to Core Formation, unable to spare any attention on other matters.</p><p>Qin Sang had almost forgotten Mei Gu and the Demon Flame Sect. It was unexpected that they had survived the cutthroat world of cultivation.</p><p>The young man’s eyes shifted, saying, “The Sect Master said the sect's survival is not just her achievement, but also due to the protection of our ancestor.”</p><p>“The Demon Flame Sect ancestor…Mei Gu mentioned her once. But I heard that this senior has been away for a long time and hasn't appeared for ages?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered slightly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s familiarity with the Demon Flame Sect ancestor, the young man's suspicions eased. He hesitated, then said,  “I haven’t seen the ancestor myself, but the Sect Master has mentioned them many times.  Due to special circumstances, the ancestor cannot appear, but they have been secretly protecting the sect.”</p><p>Qin Sang saw through it.</p><p>The young man didn’t believe his own words.  An ancestor who hadn’t appeared in so long was likely already deceased.</p><p>However, whether Mei Gu was using a bluff or for other reasons, she at least hadn’t forgotten their ancestor.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and asked a few more questions.</p><p>At this point, even a fool could sense something was off about Qin Sang.</p><p>Outside, the sky was in turmoil.</p><p>In the large shelter, all the cultivators were silent, secretly observing Qin Sang and the young man.</p><p>Less than an hour later, the celestial phenomenon subsided.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside, stood up, and walked out.</p><p>“Senior!”</p><p>The young man quickly followed, bowing. “May I ask your Daoist name, Senior? I will report this to the Sect Master.  Hearing news of an old friend will surely make her very happy.”</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly, saying calmly, “I am Qing Feng. If I have the time, I will personally visit.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang vanished in a flash amidst the storm.</p><p>The young man stood there, frowning at the direction where Qin Sang disappeared, muttering the name ‘Qing Feng’.</p><p>Then, his three companions also came out.</p><p>Qin Sang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The alluring woman asked in surprise, “Huo Mo, was that really a Core Formation stage senior?  No wonder my charm techniques had no effect on him…”</p><p>The young man looked at the woman and warned, “You should restrain yourself.  We are currently the top dogs here, but we might encounter stronger opponents at any moment.  Fortunately, that senior was magnanimous.”</p><p>The alluring woman was still shaken, nodding repeatedly.</p><p>Another cultivator asked, “Why did that senior approach you? Do you have some connection?”</p><p>The young man shook his head. “From what the senior said, they knew the Sect Master and recognized my cultivation of the Seven Suns Scripture.  Fellow Daoists, I need to return to the pass to inform the Sect Master.  I can't go with you this time…”</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving the shelter, Qin Sang went straight to Yin Mountain Pass.</p><p>He fell into deep thought.</p><p>The unexpected news about the Demon Flame Sect gave Qin Sang some new ideas.</p><p>Shao Hua Mountain was flourishing, but he couldn’t reveal his true identity until he was strong enough to face Dong Yang Bo.</p><p>However, his cultivation was hard to conceal.</p><p>With the two regions’ alliance facing the Abyss of Sin, if the situation became tense again, no force or individual could stay out of it.</p><p>Not even solitary cultivators.</p><p>Unless he continuously hides in his secluded cultivation cave and successfully achieves Nascent Soul stage, he will quickly return to the late stage of Core Formation.  With such cultivation, as soon as he appears, he will certainly be targeted by the Two Regions Alliance.  When the nest is overturned, no eggs remain intact.  The other side will use righteousness to pressure him; if he refuses, he will become a public enemy of the two regions. Before that, he needs to prepare for the future, preparing a suitable identity.</p><p>The ancestor of the Demonflame Sect is a good choice. However, the Demonflame Sect was practically single-handedly built by Mei Gu, so this action would be akin to stealing the fruits of her labor. Qin Sang doesn't believe the Demonflame Sect would truly appreciate this ancestor. If possible, the Demonflame Sect would be a good foundation to develop his own power, allowing him to stand on equal footing with Dongyang Bo after reaching Nascent Soul.  Suppressing others with power is not advisable; it will only lead to disloyalty and estrangement. He needs to give a proper explanation to Mei Gu and everyone in the Demonflame Sect. This matter can be planned slowly.</p><p>In the evening, Qin Sang arrived at a large market outside Yinshan Pass and found the black market.  He found ways to disguise his identity and avoid scrutiny. Disguised as a cultivator, he smoothly entered the city.  Instead of leaving immediately, Qin Sang frequently contacted various trading houses, buying the necessary spiritual materials while gathering information.  He finally understood the current situation of the cultivation world.</p><p>One thing surprised Qin Sang. After leaving Ziwei Palace, Mount Shao Hua never issued a warrant for his arrest.  He wondered if the invasion of the Abyss of Sin had completely occupied Dongyang Bo's attention, causing him to forget the matter, or if there was another reason.  Unlike Canglang Sea, he hunted demons in the Demon Sea, accumulating demon pills and bones, which are highly valuable and rare treasures in Xiaohan Region.</p><p>To avoid suspicion, Qin Sang only exchanged a small portion for the spiritual materials he needed. He didn't use any of the Demonic pills.  Since he planned to take over the Demonflame Sect and build his own forces, he needed to carefully consider how to use these demonic pills.</p><p>Qin Sang made a decision. After leaving the city, he found a secluded place to inscribe new killing talismans, reverting his cultivation to the mid-stage of Core Formation. Then, he set off again, flying directly out of the swamp's edge toward the Ten Thousand Mountains. After a while, Qin Sang arrived at a desolate snowy mountain.  Tan Hao's former cave was here.</p>
