Chapter 451 A Beam of Light


The scene, though distant, was terrifying, filling everyone with apprehension and palpable tension.  Only Golden Core cultivators could unleash such devastating power.

Qin Sang looked up, his mind racing.  He glanced at the battle formation; luckily, their squad was positioned in the rear left flank, allowing for a quick retreat if necessary.  With Mu Yifeng at his side and other sect members nearby, he wasn't worried about a sudden, unexpected death.  However, desertion was punishable by immediate execution, unless the entire army routed.

Given Xiao Han Domain's current strength, they weren't intimidated by the Tianxing League; a complete collapse was unlikely.  This battle was far from over.

Qin Sang expertly summoned his magical weapons: the Hanjin Sword circled him, while his Yin-Yang Compass and a chain-like artifact were at the ready.  He'd gone through several sets of magical weapons over countless battles, but the Yin-Yang Compass and Hanjin Sword remained his favorites.  The Hanjin Sword, however, was vastly different from three years ago.  Qin Sang had repeatedly refined it with suitable spiritual materials, and its power had skyrocketed, easily placing it among the top-tier of high-grade artifacts.

Mu Yifeng, a newcomer to such large-scale battles, felt uneasy.  He sent a voice transmission: "Junior Brother Qin, you're experienced.  Could you offer some guidance?  What should we do?"

Qin Sang reassured him: "Senior Brother Mu, with your cultivation, there's no need for excessive worry.  Above all, stay calm!  Remember, never be reckless or greedy for merit and stray from the formation…"

Qin Sang gave the same instructions to the other members of their squad. This was the secret to his continued survival.

Mu Yifeng let out a slow breath, resolving himself.  "I'll stick close to Junior Brother…"

In a blink, the battlefield drew nearer.  Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng fell silent, their gazes fixed on the distant storm clouds, bracing for impact.

Within the clouds, it was impossible to discern which side held the advantage. Only figures like demonic gods were visible. Each clash of magical weapons produced a rainbow flash, the mere aftershocks raising monstrous waves across the waters.

Qin Sang had witnessed Golden Core cultivator battles before, but each time, the spectacle remained equally awe-inspiring and aspirational.  This battle, however, was more intense than any he'd ever seen.  All Golden Core cultivators from both sides had been deployed. Deputy Island Master Xiao had given hasty instructions before transforming into a rainbow-like streak of light to join the fray.

A murmur rippled through the ranks.  Maintaining his composure amidst the chaos, Qin Sang scanned the storm clouds, searching for the Tianxing League's Foundation Establishment cultivators.  Had they not arrived yet?

Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. He noticed something unusual within the clouds.

Mu Yifeng, beside him, also spotted it, and pointed it out.  "Junior Brother Qin, look at that light!"

The light emanated from deep within the storm clouds. Even the heavy clouds couldn't completely obscure it.  The beam wasn't bright, unlike the surrounding lightning, but gentle, like moonlight, yet clearly visible from this distance.  It pierced the clouds like a sword, connecting the starry sky and the waters below.

The light within the beam pulsed rhythmically, carrying a strange, potent energy.  Qin Sang craned his neck, only to see it disappear into the distant stars, its source hidden. He lowered his gaze to the vast expanse of water, searching for its origin.

The beam struck the water. The area, already battered by the battle's tumult, was in turmoil.  Yet, at the point of contact with the beam, a small section of water shimmered like mercury, eerily calm. Waves, no matter how large, were silently absorbed as they approached.

"This is…"

Qin Sang noted that the beam's impact point was the very center of the battlefield.  A thought struck him.  He stared at the reflective surface, murmuring, "Is the Finger of Heaven Peak within this mirror?"

Then, he sensed faint fluctuations of a restriction within the reflective surface; unlike anything he'd ever encountered.  Like the light beam itself, it was impenetrable.  He could only guess, based on his experience, that this mirror-like restriction might harness the power of the stars—undeniably extraordinary.

More and more people noticed the beam, their astonishment evident.  But their wonder quickly faded.

From the south, a massive wave of light, composed of countless figures, emerged, matching their own army in scale—their opponents had finally arrived.


Enemies meeting, eyes blazing with hatred.

Both sides, with unspoken agreement, changed direction, avoiding the battlefield of the Nascent Soul stage cultivators.

The distance between them narrowed. Under the starry sky, the ferocious expressions of their opponents were clearly visible.

“Form the array!”

Qin Sang bellowed.

Within the battle array, numerous array nodes were manned by renowned experts like Qin Sang and Senior Brother Rong. Each controlled a section, combining the power of those around them to fight the enemy.

Though Qin Sang's cultivation was somewhat lower, his reputation with the Shadowless Sword was impeccable. He had never missed a major battle and was undeniably the most qualified.

The others were silent; only these experts communicated through sound transmission.

The time had come. They issued their commands simultaneously.

With Qin Sang's order, all the cultivators around him roared in unison, jointly channeling their spiritual energy, pouring it from their bodies, converging on Qin Sang as the center.

Qin Sang raised his hands high. The spiritual energy of everyone merged in his palms, forming a dazzling orb of light. To those around, it was as bright as the moon in the sky.

A ceaseless flood of spiritual energy surged in.  Controlling it was already extremely taxing; Qin Sang's veins bulged, his body trembling slightly.

Their power combined, but even a powerful battle formation had limits; its strength couldn't be infinitely superimposed. Otherwise, Qin Sang would have exploded.

They had reached their limit.

Mu Yifeng and the others guarded Qin Sang, preventing any accidents.

“Condense!”

When the light orb reached its peak density, Qin Sang gritted his teeth and quickly formed incredibly intricate hand seals. As the seals changed, the light orb rapidly transformed, gradually taking the shape of a qi blade.

The qi blade was only a little over a foot long, slender and bright as jade, with a sharp point upward. It appeared delicate and refined.

But forged from the combined strength of so many Foundation Establishment experts, no one dared underestimate it.

The blade shone with a chilling light; looking at it directly gave the illusion of being sliced.

Simultaneously with Qin Sang, Senior Brother Rong and the others performed the same actions.

One after another, similarly shaped qi blades formed above the battle array, and under the control of Qin Sang and the others, they flew towards the front of the array.

A line of qi blades pointed towards the Tianxing Alliance’s battle formation.

At the same time, their opponents weren't to be outdone. They had formed a wind array.

A hurricane swept in, carrying countless terrifying wind blades.
