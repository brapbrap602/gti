<h1>Chapter 1720: A Salutation to a Fellow Daoist</h1><p>Fujiang Estuary.</p><p>On a rocky outcrop, several figures stood with hands at their sides, gazing east.</p><p>Suddenly, a dark shadow appeared on the sea, a figure riding a lion approaching.</p><p>“Greetings, Master.”</p><p>The members of the Mingyue Guard bowed, but then noticed something unusual.  The black lion was a powerful demon saint.</p><p>The black lion was their master's mount; they had not yet been granted permission to join the Qingyang Temple, and their status was not high, nor were their cultivations comparable to the black lion.</p><p>The Mingyue Guard dared not show the slightest disrespect and bowed again to the black lion.</p><p>The black lion snorted, raising its head arrogantly.</p><p>“How goes the investigation?”</p><p>Qin Sang, riding the black lion, landed on the rocks and asked.</p><p>One of the Mingyue Guard immediately stepped forward, presenting a jade slip. “Reporting to Master, we have followed your orders and made thorough preparations.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body was currently in the East Sea; it was his external avatar giving orders.</p><p>His external avatar was busy with other matters in Central State and could not make it in time.</p><p>After examining the jade slip, Qin Sang looked towards the Central Plains.</p><p>The Saint King Palace's collapse and the disappearance of the Qinghu Saint King indirectly confirmed that the two Nascent Soul cultivators were deeply affected by the Heavenly Dao's demonic sounds; even if they had not ascended, they were still trapped.</p><p>While he stirred up unrest among the demons in the East Sea, his external avatar was also busy secretly investigating the Three Sects Alliance, attempting to find some clues.</p><p>Now, he could only pay a personal visit to these two fellow Daoists.</p><p>“You go ahead and make preparations.”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, dismissing the Mingyue Guard.</p><p>“Yes, Master!”</p><p>The Mingyue Guard left.</p><p>Qin Sang, riding his black lion, set off for the Ganlu Zen Temple.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Instead of directly visiting the Ganlu Zen Temple, Qin Sang appeared in the back mountains, standing on a mountain peak, overlooking the mist-shrouded peaks.</p><p>“What a magnificent temple!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>His external avatar had entered and exited the Ganlu Zen Temple many times, but this was the first time Qin Sang's true body had 'seen' the temple's grandeur firsthand.</p><p>The top sects of the Central State truly enjoyed unparalleled advantages.</p><p>The Bunan Mountain was inferior in comparison.</p><p>Years ago, the Nanman region, where the Wuxiang Immortal Sect was located, should have been even better than the Central State, but it was unfortunately destroyed by the demonic calamity.</p><p>“Master intends to seize this Daoist grounds?” the black lion rumbled beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the black lion. This beast clearly knew the Ganlu Zen Temple was protected by a Saint, yet it pretended to be stupid to win favor. No wonder it had cultivated to the late stage of transformation; even as a mount, it was top-notch.</p><p>He strained his eyes, looking towards one particular peak.</p><p>The Buddhist Saint's Daoist grounds—Xiaofangcun Mountain.</p><p>Although the mountains were real, they appeared indistinct, their view obscured by an invisible force.</p><p>Here, Qin Sang could not sense demonic energy or the aura of Nascent Soul cultivators.  He secretly investigated using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly divine ability for a while, then sat cross-legged.</p><p>A month later.</p><p>Dozens of golden lights suddenly soared from the Ganlu Zen Temple, circling the mountain before heading southwest.</p><p>These lights were all disciples of the temple, led by a fat monk with a bulging belly, a wine gourd hanging from his waist, and a perpetually smiling face, like the statue of Maitreya Buddha in a temple.</p><p>The fat monk possessed unfathomable depth.  He didn't use any flying artifacts; he simply walked in the air.  His steps were slow, but his speed was astonishing. The young monks behind him struggled to keep up.</p><p>Compared to the fat monk, these young monks seemed frail, their faces flushed as they used various artifacts, desperately trying to catch up. Only a few looked calm.</p><p>In terms of cultivation, apart from the fat monk, only two young monks were at the Golden Core stage; the rest were only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>The fat monk led the group, flying through the air.  Whenever they encountered cultivators along the way, they stopped to pay their respects, their manner respectful. Those familiar with him would greet him with, "The disciples are on a training journey this time, and Venerable Jingding is personally providing protection."</p><p>The fat monk opened his wine gourd and took a swig, sighing, "This poor monk is always busy."</p><p>The person observed the disciples behind him, nodding, “They are all excellent materials.”</p><p>To care for his disciples, the fat monk stopped several times, traversing countless mountains and rivers until they reached a remote mountain range, hundreds of miles away from any human settlement.</p><p>Outsiders would not have noticed anything unusual about this mountain.</p><p>The fat monk picked up his wine gourd and poured it downwards.  A stream of clear water flew out, transforming into a torrential downpour upon hitting the mountain, rumbling down.</p><p>After the rain, the peaks were refreshed, the vegetation lush, with a faint scent of wine lingering in the air.</p><p>Looking at the central peak, the scenery was drastically different, as if some seal had been broken, revealing its true form.</p><p>A fissure split the peak, emitting a constant stream of dark red smoke.  At the summit, some force halted its ascent, causing it to coalesce into a crimson cloud, radiating a strange mixture of intense heat and chilling cold.</p><p>The disciples behind watched the cloud with a mixture of anticipation and curiosity.</p><p>A portly monk jiggled his wine gourd, a look of slight regret crossing his face.  "You know the rules of this trial better than I do, my old bones remember them well.  You've risen above many of your brothers and sisters. Remember that this opportunity is precious, don't treat it lightly. Go!"</p><p>With that, the fat monk settled comfortably onto a flat rock in the mountainside.  The rock was smooth, like a stone bed. He lay down, legs crossed, one hand supporting his head, the other raising his gourd to his lips for a long swig.  He closed his eyes contentedly.</p><p>"Master, the Abbot says your resolve is lacking, that it's hindering your progress; that you should take vows."  Two young monks spoke from beside the rock. One was stern-faced and frowned.</p><p>"I was born with wisdom, I need no vows," the fat monk mumbled, shaking his head.</p><p>The two exchanged a look of helpless resignation and ushered the disciples forward, into the smoke-filled chasm.</p><p>The deeper they went, the denser the smoke became, obscuring their vision, though their spiritual senses remained largely unaffected.  The novices felt the space expand around them as they descended, it was unclear how far down they had gone. The two leading monks stopped on a platform.  "We'll wait for you here.  This Crimson Cloud site holds both opportunity and peril. If you encounter danger, crush the jade amulet, we will rescue you. But you will forfeit your chance to continue. Consider carefully."</p><p>With a flick of their sleeves, the two monks sent the novices spinning, scattering them to unknown locations.</p><p>The details of their individual trials are for another time.</p><p>The fat monk lay on his rock, not chanting, occasionally taking a drink and gazing at the sky, perfectly at ease.  This trial was expected to last at least ten days.  The monk was not drinking ordinary wine.  He closed his eyes, silently cultivating his inner energy, his breathing even, seemingly falling asleep.</p><p>Suddenly, the stone bed beneath him violently shook. He opened his eyes, realizing it was not the bed that moved, but the entire mountain!</p><p>"What's happening?" He was perplexed. The Crimson Cloud site had served as a trial ground for over a millennium without incident.</p><p>His mind raced. He recalled that before it became a trial site, the Crimson Cloud site was a forbidden zone of the monastery, its depths concealing not only strange red smoke but also the remnants of an ancient, powerful formation.  It had taken many years and the efforts of the monastery's most skilled practitioners to make it safe.</p><p>"Could something be stirring within the remnants of that formation?"</p><p>He didn't delay. He summoned his iron-wood staff and sprang into the chasm, swiftly moving towards the platform. Sensing no sign of his disciples, his expression grew serious. He raised his staff and smashed it downward.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The staff pierced the air, emitting a golden light, transforming into a larger, golden staff, penetrating the smoke and plunging downwards.</p><p>The staff cleared a path.</p><p>The fat monk rapidly descended.</p><p>However, not long after, a tremendous rumbling sound erupted from below, like a mountain collapse.</p><p>The monk's heart leaped.  He saw a surge of thick, inky black smoke rising, unlike the red smoke. Within the black smoke, wisps of something resembling silk, inscribed with flickering runes, floated like fragments.</p><p>He knew what it was; he was responsible for guarding this Crimson Cloud site.</p><p>"No, the ancient formation is unstable!"</p><p>The black smoke was aggressive, the silk-like strands coiling around like venomous snakes.</p><p>The monk was startled. He instantly crushed a wooden token at his waist, bringing his staff down hard, while summoning a jade mirror, scattering white light.</p><p>The black smoke overwhelmed the light, instantly swallowing both monk and staff.</p><p>The instant the token shattered...</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles from the Crimson Cloud site...</p><p>An old monk, leaning on a bamboo staff, was collecting alms in the mortal realm.  He suddenly looked west, his figure vanishing in an instant. The homeowner, just bringing out some food, thought they had seen a ghost, rubbed their eyes, and exclaimed about a divine being.</p><p>Shortly afterward...</p><p>The old monk appeared above the Crimson Cloud site, overlooking it.  He could faintly see dark energy swirling within the red smoke.</p><p>He glanced around, frowning slightly. His grip tightened on the alms bowl in his hand. The wooden bowl emitted a purple glow, transforming into a purple-gold bowl. He inverted it, sending a purple beam like a sharp arrow, piercing the red smoke.</p><p>Sensing the presence of the fat monk, he moved subtly, appearing instantly on the mountain peak.  The fat monk was wielding his staff, rapidly shifting through various hand seals, charging forward with all his might.  Things had gone wrong here; his disciples were likely in grave danger, but he bore the responsibility for their safety and couldn't leave them.</p><p>He couldn't see, however, at the source of the black smoke, within the ancient, ruined formation, several figures were seated, performing incantations.  Beside them, a majestic black lion stood guard.</p><p>Suddenly, the black lion opened its eyes, its paws trembled, and it charged outwards.</p><p>By this time, the old monk had also burst into the black smoke, nearing the fat monk.  More perceptive than the fat monk, he sensed something amiss and roared, “What fiend dares cause trouble in the Central Plains!”</p><p>He spun his alms bowl; inside, it was somehow filled with water to the brim.  Even held upright, not a drop spilled; the surface was like a mirror, reflecting the illusory form of a black lion.</p><p>In the midst of the chaos, he didn’t forget to send a secret signal to his sect for help.</p><p>The moment the black lion was revealed, a vicious gust of wind attacked from the side.</p><p>The black lion, ferocious and malevolent, raised its massive paw and struck at the old monk.  Its claws, sharp as blades, gleamed with cold light, tearing through the monk’s protective energy. The attack was a killing blow.</p><p>The old monk snorted coldly. The rosary around his neck suddenly broke apart, individual yellow wooden beads shooting towards the black lion.  These beads transformed, each carving into a lifelike Buddha statue, each with a different posture.</p><p>The light of the Buddhas blazed.</p><p>Before the black lion, countless Buddha images appeared, all glaring at it angrily.</p><p>A sense of divine power seemed to reach the black lion’s ears. The Buddha statues solidified, their movements generating thunderous power.  They struck the black lion with overwhelming might.</p><p>The black lion roared, its neck twisting, and suddenly sprouted more than a dozen heads, each aiming at a Buddha, opening their gaping maws, spewing black energy to repel the Buddhas.  Simultaneously, its front paw lunged even faster at the old monk’s chest.</p><p>There was a clang.</p><p>A golden alms bowl appeared before the old monk’s chest, blocking the black lion’s claw. The monk’s body trembled as he flew back several dozen meters, staring at the black lion in astonishment.  “Black Lion Daoist friend, is that you?”</p><p>“You humans are full of malicious intent, daring to harm the Sacred King! Prepare to die!” The black lion fabricated a reason, scattering the wooden Buddhas and attacking.</p><p>The old monk was inexplicably surprised. “How could you…?”</p><p>Before he could finish, he suddenly realized that the fox demon likely hadn’t revealed the full truth to its subordinates.  The black lion’s unwavering loyalty was quite lamentable!</p><p>Ignoring his explanations, the black lion fought to the death.</p><p>The old monk evaded, about to speak again when a chill ran down his spine. He saw a familiar figure and exclaimed in disbelief, “Qingfeng Daoist?”</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, stood at the edge of the mountain crevice, having sealed off the battlefield, trapping the old monk regardless of his abilities.</p><p>He didn't interfere, instead looking towards Ganlu Monastery. The old monk’s warning had already reached its destination.</p><p>Ganlu Monastery.</p><p>Master Xingji was discussing matters with a senior monk.</p><p>Suddenly, a monastic attendant reported, “Brother Jingding sent a warning; trouble at the Red Cloud Dharma Ground.”</p><p>“Red Cloud Dharma Ground?”</p><p>Master Xingji and the senior monk exchanged glances.</p><p>The senior monk said, “Today is the day for the monastery’s disciples’ trials… The threats in that forbidden area have long been eliminated. How could something happen?  Jingding can't handle it?”</p><p>Master Xingji rose, saying, “Brother, come with me…”</p><p>His expression softened slightly. He smiled, “Brother Xingren is traveling the world and is near the Red Cloud Dharma Ground. He has already arrived.”</p><p>“With Brother Xingren there, it should be fine.”</p><p>The senior monk nodded.</p><p>Master Xingji gave orders, then sat down again.</p><p>Brother Xingren possessed late Yuan Ying stage cultivation, second only to himself. If not for his devotion to Buddhism, repeatedly descending to the mortal world, his longest stay lasting nearly a century, delaying his cultivation, he might have reached the nascent soul stage sooner.</p><p>Thinking of this, Master Xingji suddenly felt heavy-hearted. What was the point of discussing the Nascent Soul stage now?</p><p>Dismissing his thoughts, Master Xingji was about to speak when his face changed drastically.  He said in a deep voice, “Brother Xingren is in danger!”</p><p>As he spoke, the two were already outside the monastery gates.  Simultaneously, a bell tolled within the monastery, followed by a series of whooshing sounds as figures shot out.</p><p>Master Xingji and the other high-cultivation monks moved first, the others following.</p><p>In the past, Master Xingji would have considered all possibilities, such as an old enemy causing trouble.  Now, however, the threat of the Nascent Soul stage didn't matter as much.</p><p>The Red Cloud Dharma Ground wasn’t far from Ganlu Monastery.</p><p>Master Xingji and the others quickly saw the mountain peak shrouded in thick smoke.  Instead of red clouds, billowing black smoke poured out, the inner energy chaotic.  Clearly, a battle was underway.</p><p>Judging by the atmosphere, Brother Xingren was on the defensive and in grave danger!</p><p>The monks summoned their treasures and rushed into the Dharma Ground, before they could assess the situation...</p><p>They heard a sigh from behind.</p><p>“Daoist Huiguang is no longer in this world?”</p><p>Master Xingji spun around, startled, to see a Daoist standing behind them.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes held a touch of loneliness.</p><p>With a senior cultivator of their sect in trouble and unable to escape, as a matter of principle and sentiment, a Nascent Soul cultivator should intervene.</p><p>(End)</p>
