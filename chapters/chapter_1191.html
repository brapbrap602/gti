<h1>Chapter 1183: Luring</h1><p>Chapter 1183: Luring</p><p>*BOOM BOOM BOOM…*</p><p>A deafening roar echoed through the mountains and fields.  The protective barrier flickered, its brightness fluctuating.  Breaches and cracks appeared in several places. Cultivators nearby suffered casualties; some spat blood and stumbled back, only to be replaced by fresh squads working frantically to repair the barrier. The battle formation remained remarkably disciplined.</p><p>The first wave of attacks from the two domains failed to breach the defenses of the Abyss.  Unwilling to be outdone, the Abyss surged forward during a lull, launching a fierce counterattack. After several exchanges, the distance between the two sides steadily decreased, the protective barrier trembling precariously.</p><p>Within the cold fog, a contingent of cultivators simultaneously deployed shield-like artifacts.  These shields, wider at the top than the bottom, blazed with light upon activation, projecting immense, ethereal duplicates of themselves. These projections soared into the air, overlapping and merging to form a sharply defined energy shield above their squads.</p><p>For generations, faced with limited resources and threats from two sides, the Skywalk League had researched and refined these uniformly shaped artifacts.  They proved highly effective on the battlefield and were quickly adopted by the combined forces of the two domains.</p><p>In addition to the shields, another group of cultivators within each squad unleashed standardized Xuan iron heavy swords and axes. The instant the shields formed, a wave of sword and axe energy surged from the formation, incredibly synchronized, row upon row, flashing with cold light, a devastating onslaught against the enemy.</p><p>In contrast, the Abyss’s actions were more enigmatic.  Some squads formed circles, their members shaking black bells while chanting incantations, seemingly performing some strange magic. Soon, dark energy coalesced above the center of each circle.</p><p>This black energy twisted and deformed before everyone’s eyes, resembling thick, viscous sludge, morphing into grotesque shapes that were nauseating to behold. Upon contact with the black rays emitted by the幽晶塔 (Yu Jing Tower), they seemed to come alive, extending tentacles before developing bodies and limbs.</p><p>These black energy forms varied greatly, including birds, beasts, and even humanoids.  However, their forms were unstable, with dark fluid constantly flowing across their surfaces.  They emitted piercing, earsplitting howls.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Jing Lin stealthily withdrew from the Cold Bell Formation, slowly creeping towards the Yu Jing Tower.  Qin Sang clearly saw that Pei Lao Mo, the one manipulating the Yu Jing Tower, wasn’t positioned between the three towers, but rather concealed beside one of them.  Pei Lao Mo believed himself safe under the tower's protection, but Qin Sang had seen through his ruse.</p><p>“What are those things?” Qin Sang, distracted by the monstrous creations of the Abyss cultivators, frowned at the bizarre sight.</p><p>Jing Lin replied, “From what I understand, they’re a type of mimetic incantation, used in conjunction with those peculiar bells, but the core lies with the Yu Jing Tower. These monsters are difficult to kill, but they aren't invincible…”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the nearest monster, unable to decipher its nature.</p><p>At that moment, Tan Lao Mo, witnessing the incoming onslaught of swords and axes, snorted coldly and issued an order.  With a chorus of roars, the monsters rapidly floated to the front of the battle formation, fearlessly facing the incredibly sharp attacks and charging forward relentlessly.</p><p>*Rip!*</p><p>The sound of tearing fabric echoed repeatedly.  The front ranks of monsters were dismembered, limbs flying, but they didn't die, their mutilated bodies continuing their attacks, tearing and tangling with the sword and axe energy. Rows of monsters were cut to pieces, but the sword and axe energy was rapidly depleting.</p><p>Both sides clearly understood each other's tactics. Before the monsters and the sword and axe energy could achieve a decisive outcome, they launched a second wave of attacks.  Under Tan Lao Mo's command, the Abyss cultivators pressed their advance relentlessly, finally reaching the edge of the cold fog. Without hesitation, they charged into the formation!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent wind erupted.  A blizzard of heavy snow engulfed the area, countless snowflakes falling from the sky, whipped by a hurricane towards the Abyss.</p><p>At this point, the energy shield bestowed upon the Abyss cultivators by the Yu Jing Tower proved effective; the snowflakes melted silently upon contact.</p><p>As if realizing the attack was ineffective, the Cold Bell Formation chimed, its operators altering the formation.  The blizzard changed to a moderate snowfall, the wind coalescing into snow walls to impede the Abyss’s advance. The cultivators of the Xiao Han Domain seized the opportunity to launch a full-scale attack.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Pei Lao Mo, operating the Yu Jing Tower in the rear, snorted coldly, changing his incantations.  The crystal spheres atop the Yu Jing Towers fired countless black rays, directly striking the snow walls and forcibly tearing open passageways.</p><p>During the clash, cultivators from both sides engaged in fierce combat. The protective barriers on the battlefields were severely damaged and on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The protective barrier on the Zuiyuan side shattered first, resulting in a surge of casualties. Blood stained the ground.</p><p>Tan Laomo, his face contorted with rage, immediately ordered the release of all monsters.  These fearless creatures, charging through waves of attacks, finally tore apart the protective barrier above the cultivators from the two realms.</p><p>Si Di, his expression grim, stared intently at Tan Laomo.  He showed no emotion at this sight.  </p><p>Stationed within the large formation, they held a geographical advantage; the defense shouldn't have broken so quickly. Si Di had deliberately weakened it.  A prolonged direct confrontation between the Yuan Ying stage cultivators was undesirable. He feared that if the battle dragged on too long, the Golden Core cultivators controlling the Hanling formation would falter and expose a weakness, jeopardizing the plan to ambush Pei Laomo.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A golden light swirled around Si Di—his renowned treasure, the Yuejinjian.  No bigger than a palm, its center held a mirror-like surface of unknown material.  The rest of the Yuejinjian was rough, covered in numerous small gold lumps.</p><p>The Yuejinjian spun faster and faster, appearing as streaks of golden light to the naked eye.</p><p>Simultaneously, Tan Laomo, grinning fiercely, met Si Di's gaze without flinching. The fire rope on his arm vibrated slightly, emitting intense flames that warped the surrounding air.</p><p>The two Yuan Ying masters had already locked onto each other!</p><p>Zuiyuan advanced rapidly.</p><p>Cultivators in both formations were tense, holding their breath, bracing for the impending bloody battle.</p><p>One hundred zhang!</p><p>Fifty zhang!</p><p>Ten zhang!</p><p>…</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>In an instant, earth-shattering roars erupted simultaneously.  The two formations collided violently, plunging the battlefield into chaos.  The cries of battle shook the heavens.</p><p>The chaos didn't last long.  Seasoned veterans, both sides regrouped into smaller units, gradually stabilizing their positions and engaging the enemy in close combat.</p><p>From above, the two sides spread out, resembling streams of water merging, intertwining, and separating—a scene of bloody slaughter.</p><p>Si Di and Tan Laomo, each with their own hidden agenda, ignored everyone else and flew directly towards each other, their treasures colliding first.</p><p>——</p><p>——</p><p>Thank you to Nanwang JF for the generous contribution.</p><p>I still owe a chapter.</p><p>I've been affected by the recent epidemic.  Since most residents in my community are elderly, and there aren't many young people, I've been helping out and haven't had time to catch up on writing.</p><p>However, the epidemic is almost over, and things are returning to normal soon.</p>
