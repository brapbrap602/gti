<h1>Chapter 1508: Linglong (4k)</h1><p>Tianpeng the Great Saint soared into the air, wings fluttering gently.</p><p>His golden-winged bird body shimmered with light.  With each beat of his wings, golden waves rippled outwards, showering down a cascade of golden light.</p><p>His two talons were as large as parasols, their tips gleaming with a cold light, far sharper than any blade.</p><p>The imposing aura of a Great Saint of the demon race was unmistakable.</p><p>Across the circular platform, the Hunmo Elder sensed his presence and looked up.</p><p>Though his vision was obscured by flames, he could perceive Tianpeng's rapidly ascending energy, a look of intense apprehension clouding his eyes.</p><p>Without hesitation, he raised a hand and lightly patted the back of his head.</p><p>The light behind him twisted, growing dim.</p><p>Then, a shadowy figure emerged from the Hunmo Elder's shoulder – the ghost spirit he kept.</p><p>The ghost spirit rolled its white eyes, staring intently at the center of the platform.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder's lips moved slightly, either chanting an incantation or communicating with the spirit.</p><p>Suddenly, the ghost spirit let out a shrill laugh, its body spinning rapidly, transforming into a wisp of pale ghostly energy, darting like a serpent towards the Hunmo Elder's head.  It plunged into his body through his Baihui acupoint.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder trembled, his face paling, his breath instantly chilling, as if he had just emerged from the underworld, his body filled with ghostly energy.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>A chilling wind howled around them.</p><p>A strange sight unfolded.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder’s body grew darker, as if the surrounding light was being drawn away, enveloped by a shadow of unknown origin.</p><p>The shadow intensified and took shape, becoming increasingly clear, until it formed a human-like figure standing behind the Hunmo Elder, pressed tightly against his back.</p><p>At this moment, the Hunmo Elder became almost invisible, all eyes drawn to the shadow.</p><p>The shadow's features were seven parts Hunmo Elder, three parts ghost spirit, its expression grim and ghostly, an unsettling and bizarre combination.</p><p>The shadow bent down, reaching for the chain.</p><p>Simultaneously, Tianpeng the Great Saint swooped down, extending his talons to firmly grasp the chain.</p><p>Both were assisted by several demon henchmen.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The Hunmo Elder and Tianpeng the Great Saint exerted their strength together.</p><p>The chain tautened at both ends.</p><p>Other demons, having been alerted, unleashed their skills, precisely targeting their attacks, working in perfect harmony.</p><p>The ancient prohibition within the platform was constantly under attack; the seal was far weaker than at the beginning, and this was the perfect opportunity to strike.</p><p>Tianpeng the Great Saint gripped the chain, his wings beating wildly, his feathers bristling, emitting piercing cries that tore through the air.</p><p>The Hunmo Elder wasn't to be outdone; the dark shadow behind him twisted, nearly collapsing, yet his arms grew thicker, like two black pythons, tightly wrapped around the chain.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack! Crack…’</p><p>The chain was being forcibly lifted, link by link.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The flames surged.</p><p>In an instant, a fiery pillar shot into the sky, its brightness blinding, forcing everyone to squint.</p><p>However, the joy on everyone's faces deepened, their movements relentless.</p><p>The fire raged, threatening to break through the opening.</p><p>Deep within the platform, the flames danced wildly, the power of the seal becoming increasingly chaotic.</p><p>At the base of the flames, at the end of the chain, a shadow gradually emerged. As the chain was pulled inch by inch, the outline of the shadow became clearer, revealing a colossal object with sharp angles, as imposing as a tower!</p><p>Through the swirling flames, they glimpsed the outline of the object below. The Hunmo Elder's eyes narrowed, and a sudden realization caused his face to change dramatically.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Whether it was some mechanism being triggered, or the seal reaching its breaking point, the Hunmo Elder and Tianpeng the Great Saint felt the chain suddenly lighten.</p><p>A muffled sound echoed from the depths of the opening.</p><p>The sound was like thunder; the ground shook.</p><p>The platform swayed violently.</p><p>Without further pulling from them,</p><p>amidst the flames, a great noise arose as the chain broke. A seven-colored beam of light burst forth from the hole, like a rainbow, incredibly brilliant and dazzling.</p><p>Before they could admire the rainbow, everyone's faces turned pale.</p><p>A brilliant rainbow burst forth, unleashing a torrent of flames that soared into the sky, instantly piercing the thick clouds.</p><p>A wave of fire swept across the land!</p><p>The change was sudden.</p><p>They were too close to the void, and bore the brunt of the fiery blast.</p><p>Though the demons all had hidden trump cards and various methods prepared for seizing the treasure, the flames from the void had accumulated energy for countless years, and now unleashed their full power, creating a terrifying spectacle.</p><p>The flames possessed the power to incinerate the heavens.</p><p>The terrifying shockwave approached in an instant.</p><p>Everyone knew that without dodging, they would be reduced to ashes.</p><p>Even the venerable Hun Mo and the Great Saint Tian Peng dared not withstand the fiery blast to seize the treasure, immediately retreating.</p><p>There were continuous ‘bangs’.</p><p>The circular platform suddenly became a sea of fire, amidst which strange lights flashed repeatedly as the demons used their various abilities to withstand the fiery blast. They could only protect themselves and keep retreating.</p><p>In the heart of the fire, the rainbow streaked across the sky like a shooting star.</p><p>Only when two chains were stretched taut, forcibly pulling it back, did it stop. The rainbow light flickered, revealing the treasure within.</p><p>It was a delicate pagoda!</p><p>…</p><p>Midway down the deep valley.</p><p>After eliminating the weasel, Qin Sang became even more cautious.</p><p>However, no further spying or traps were encountered.</p><p>With the weasel's death, Huang Mei the demon king would know of the change at the valley entrance. The demons would surely be on guard, making their task more difficult.</p><p>But having come this far, there was no turning back. Qin Sang and Liuli did not hesitate, and decided to press on.</p><p>The deep valley was indeed filled with restrictions and dangers at every step.</p><p>Even with the guidance of the Yang Kui crystal, locking onto the demons' locations, their speed was still slow.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A strong wind struck them.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged. With a slight movement of his mind, the Jin Chen sword hanging above his head trembled, and ‘swish, swish, swish’, instantly releasing more than a dozen sword beams.</p><p>With a ‘bang’, the attacker was struck by the sword beams, flying several meters away, revealing its true form—another monster formed from bones.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang notice that eight stone pillars had risen from the ground around them at some point. Three were destroyed, the remaining five intact.</p><p>Each pillar originally had a ferocious bone-carved demonic creature perched on it.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang and Liuli continuously encountered various bone formations. Each formation’s monsters were different—dragons, beasts, yakshas, a chaotic array, unlike anything they had ever seen.</p><p>Each bone formation was extremely mysterious, opening Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>These formations were not all intact; some were badly damaged like the one before them. Qin Sang also discovered many new traces, indicating that the formations were not indestructible.</p><p>However, those demons were not so kind as to clear them away. Leaving the obstacles would hinder later arrivals.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli could now skillfully deal with the monsters' attacks, but they had to reveal the monsters' true forms to escape, otherwise they would be surrounded by endless monsters.</p><p>The first monster’s sneak attack failed.</p><p>Four gray shadows immediately appeared beside Qin Sang and Liuli, attacking wildly.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Jin Chen sword trembled, transforming into thousands of blades.</p><p>At the same time, Liuli's phoenix-shaped sword turned into a blue light, swiftly weaving between the Jin Chen sword's beams, cooperating to slay the monsters.</p><p>Without needing to communicate, their swordsmanship complemented each other perfectly; the monsters couldn't get close.</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>A thunderous sound came from deep within the clouds, and the ground shook violently. The monster that had been sent flying, having just gotten back to its feet, stumbled and nearly fell.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli's expressions changed, exchanging a serious look.</p><p>“What did those demons do in there? Has the treasure already appeared?”</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang no longer held back, the surrounding sword light dimming as he created a sword formation.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang and Liuli felt a simultaneous intuition, both looking up to the sky.</p><p>The clouds were swirling, obscuring the sun.</p><p>Their vision should have been a blank white.</p><p>But at that moment, a long rainbow appeared, its light shining brilliantly.</p><p>From their position, it seemed a little blurry, but they could still see it.</p><p>Inside the rainbow light, the outline of a delicate pagoda was visible.</p><p>Liuli's expression remained unchanged at the sight of the pagoda, but Qin Sang felt an inexplicable familiarity, suddenly remembering something, and his face was filled with surprise.</p><p>He immediately probed his Qian Jun ring, locating the object.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Two beams of light shot out, revealing two exquisitely crafted miniature towers.  These were the Seven-Story Pagoda and the Seven-Story Tower, treasures Qin Sang had respectively obtained from the Jinghai Sect and the Xuantian Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang's actions caught Liuli's attention. Seeing the two small towers hovering before him, Liuli was momentarily stunned.  She subconsciously glanced up at the magnificent tower suspended in mid-air.</p><p>Both were seven-storied, both radiated brilliant light, breathtakingly beautiful! Though only their outlines were visible, it was clear the three towers were nearly identical. Qin Sang's two towers seemed like miniature versions of the large one.</p><p>No one would believe there was no connection between the three towers.  However, the large tower had been hidden here for a long time. The demons had been doing something inside it before its reappearance.  How could Qin Sang possess treasures related to it?</p><p>Liuli's gaze shifted to Qin Sang's face, only to find him equally surprised and perplexed.</p><p>They were somehow connected to the stone tablet space!</p><p>The Seven-Story Tower being kept in the Xuantian Palace treasury was plausible.  But the Seven-Story Pagoda, obtained from the Jinghai Sect, also had a connection to the Xuantian Palace's sacred site?</p><p>Previously, no matter how Qin Sang tried, the two small towers remained unchanged. They had lain quietly inside his storage ring, showing no abnormalities.</p><p>But the moment he took them out, Qin Sang immediately sensed something was wrong. Without any action from him, the two towers floated up on their own, their light intensifying, emitting a strange, unprecedented energy fluctuation, seemingly resonating with the large tower in the air.</p><p>The two towers also attracted each other, slowly drawing closer, then spinning rapidly around each other.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The monsters continued their frenzied assault on the sword formation.  Qin Sang had no time for them, his attention fixed on the two towers, a sense of caution in his heart.</p><p>Their rotation accelerated, forming a vortex of light in the void.</p><p>The next moment, the light vortex dissipated, and the two small towers merged before them into a single pagoda, a jewel atop its spire emitting a soft, seven-colored halo, identical to that of the large tower.</p><p>The pagoda trembled slightly, as if attempting to break free and fly towards the larger one.</p><p>Qin Sang, quick as a flash, grabbed the pagoda, even though he didn't understand the reason for this transformation.  He felt a cool sensation in his palm.</p><p>A surprising event unfolded.  As he held the pagoda and the seven-colored halo enveloped him and Liuli, the monsters attacking the sword formation suddenly stilled, their hostility gone. They returned to their stone pillars, falling into a deathly silence.  The pillars sank into the ground, the beast bone formation vanishing.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the pagoda in his hand, then at the large tower in the sky.  He had a growing understanding.  Without hesitation, he shouted, "Go!"</p><p>Liuli reacted swiftly, sheathing her sword and fleeing.  Their figures, swift as lightning, vanished into the depths of the mist.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two beams of light streaked through the valley.  Though extensive, the valley was nothing to Yuan Ying cultivators, especially since they had already covered almost half the distance.  If not for the ancient restrictions and the beast bone formation, they would have already reached the platform and encountered the demons.</p><p>Now, under the pagoda's protection, they encountered no further obstacles.  Holding the pagoda, Qin Sang seemed to have become the valley's master.  Every ancient restriction they encountered along the way silently dissolved at the touch of the seven-colored halo, as if nonexistent. The ground remained eerily calm, not a single beast bone formation appearing.</p><p>However, Qin Sang could only passively accept the pagoda's protection; he didn't know how to use it further, and time didn't allow for exploration.</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang and Liuli rapidly approached the platform.</p><p>As Qin Sang was experimenting with the pagoda's other functions, he sensed the explosive force of a wave of flames, diverting his attention to look ahead.  Using the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's ability, he finally saw the platform and its surroundings.</p><p>The mist around the platform had dissipated, the vast area transformed into a sea of fire. Two thick chains extended from the platform, securing the base of the large tower.  From this vantage point, it was even clearer: the large tower and his pagoda were identical, down to the smallest detail on their surfaces!</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the area, noticing the demons scattered and disheveled. He could guess what had happened.</p><p>He also came into contact with the escaping flames.  This heat, touching the halo, flowed to either side, avoiding them completely, causing no harm or obstruction whatsoever.</p><p>The two moved as if through empty space.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli's astonishment deepened.</p><p>"A chance!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the entrance to the large tower. This thought suddenly struck him.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>The next chapter will be a little late. Please don't stay up late; read it tomorrow morning.</p>
