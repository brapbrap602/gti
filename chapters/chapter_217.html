<h1>Chapter 210 Soul Reaping</h1><p>Chapter 210 Soul Reaping</p><p>Devilish energy veiled the surroundings, obscuring its contents. A thoughtful expression painted Qin Sang's face; he refrained from rushing in recklessly and instead accessed his Corpse Puppet Pouch, releasing the Corpse Fiend.</p><p>Within the devilish energy, one's divine consciousness could only cover a small radius around oneself. Even when encountering other companions, one would not have to worry about the Corpse Fiend being discovered as long as they maintained a safe distance. Thus, it was perfect to use the Corpse Fiend as a scout.</p><p>"Get in there!"</p><p>Following Qin Sang's order, the Corpse Fiend charged into the devilish energy without hesitation. The energy failed to intimidate the Corpse Fiend as it sped forward. Having covered a certain distance, it abruptly encountered an uninvited guest blocking its path - a dark figure.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Corpse Fiend threw an unerring punch at the figure.</p><p>A piercing shriek reverberated through the tunnel, filled with intense agony and madness, as if a demon's wail was drilling into one's brain. The dark figure seemed to be shaped by black smoke and was shattered by the Corpse Fiend's punch. However, it immediately reassembled into a gigantic ghost head. It opened its maw with a shriek, its malevolent gaze fixed on the Corpse Fiend before it fiercely lunged forward.</p><p>The ghost head's strength was inferior to the Corpse Fiend; the latter could shatter it with a single blow. Yet, the ghost head repeatedly rose from its death, as though it were immortal, which began to annoy the Corpse Fiend. Furthermore, an increasing number of malicious spirits sensed the Corpse Fiend's presence and rushed towards it in an endless stream.</p><p>These malicious spirits were not limited to ghost heads; they were grotesque and sinister. The sight was akin to a hundred demons rampaging through the night.</p><p>Through the soul imprint on the Corpse Fiend, Qin Sang could perceive its situation.</p><p>"This is... an artificially refined Malignant Spirit?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, his eyebrows furrowed as he wondered why Malignant Spirits would appear in this place.</p><p>Cloud Beasts did exist in countless forms, but they were fundamentally different from Malignant Spirits. The most common Malignant Spirits were malicious spirits that Demonic Cultivators collected and refined into Demonic Artifacts. They were akin to the primary soul of the Ten Yama Banner, artificially crafted.</p><p>Have Demonic Cultivators infiltrated this place?</p><p>The Corpse Fiend had caused such a commotion, yet why had no one come to investigate?</p><p>Qin Sang secretly wondered if he had wronged Yin Xingge, but since only Malignant Spirits existed within the devilish energy, dealing with them posed no difficulty. Moreover, he had to save those two people. If there truly were Demonic Cultivators here, he could escape with the rescued duo before his presence was detected.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang retracted the Ebonywood Sword and opened his palm. Six Ten Yama Banners floated out and swiftly revolved around him, rapidly forming a formation.</p><p>The primary souls of the Ten Yama Banners emerged faintly on the banners. Pitting ghost against ghost, he feared not those Malignant Spirits.</p><p>With the banner formation encircling him, Qin Sang felt somewhat reassured, but he dared not relax and remained vigilant as he stepped into the devilish energy, catching up with the Corpse Fiend.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>With a flick of Qin Sang's wrist, the six banners promptly surrounded the Corpse Fiend, trapping the Malignant Spirits that were besieging it within the formation. The Nether Spirit Threads flickered with an azure glow as the Demonic Artifact primary souls slithered out from the banners.</p><p>Qin Sang had expected a fierce battle to ensue, but what transpired astounded him.</p><p>Upon laying eyes on these Malignant Spirits, the primary souls of the Yama Banners erupted with jubilation, an emotion that Qin Sang could clearly sense.</p><p>It was akin to them encountering a delectable dish, the embodiment of primal delight.</p><p>"Roar! Roar!"</p><p>These Demonic Artifact primary souls let out resounding roars and eerie cackles alike, and without waiting for Qin Sang's orders, they eagerly pounced on the Malignant Spirits.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, the Malignant Spirits exhibited intense fear towards the Yama Banner primary souls, as if they had encountered their natural enemy. Their previous arrogance vanished, and they scattered in disarray.</p><p>'Whoosh...'</p><p>The Yama Banners billowed, unleashing their full might. The Nether Spirit Threads tightly bound the Malignant Spirits within the formation, while the primary souls reveled in the abundance of delectable sustenance.</p><p>The location reverberated with the sounds of wailing spirits.</p><p>As the primary souls devoured more Malignant Spirits, their strength surged, gradually enhancing the Ten Yama Banners' quality. The Malignant Spirits, meanwhile, became utterly helpless.</p><p>"What is happening?"</p><p>Qin Sang was utterly bewildered by this turn of events. Such a scenario could only result from two possibilities.</p><p>One, these Malignant Spirits were ownerless. Two, the controller of the Malignant Spirits was far inferior to Qin Sang in cultivation.</p><p>Magical cultivators use magical artifact such as soul refining that can actually forcefully devour opponent's malicious ghost control, but such things only happen when the gap between the two sides is huge and the opponent has no resistance.</p><p>Judging from the strength of these malicious ghosts, the person in control of them must be quite deep in cultivation, but to be so easily devoured by the Ten Directions閻羅幡, it seems like the opponent doesn't know what's going on here and didn't do anything to counter it.</p><p>Qin Sang was mystified, but it couldn't be a bad thing.</p><p>After getting the Ten Directions閻羅幡 from Sun De, Qin Sang didn't commit murder and refine soul which led to the Ten Directions閻羅幡's quality stagnating.</p><p>Sun De was careful and didn't dare to slaughter Shaohua Mountain, none of the six閻羅幡 reached perfection, not sure how many malicious ghosts there are in the demonic energy, how much they can improve the Ten Directions閻羅幡?</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the Ten Directions閻羅幡 to devour ghosts, let the evil corpse continue scouting the path in front.</p><p>As a dead creature, as long as the evil corpse avoids malicious ghosts and doesn't attack first, it could actually get past the malicious ghosts' perception.</p><p>Before long, all the malicious ghosts in the great formation were devoured, Qin Sang raised his hand and recalled the Ten Directions閻羅幡, noticing that the glow of the Ten Directions閻羅幡 was brighter than before, the pattern on the flag was more lively, if there were enough malicious ghosts here, maybe all six Ten Directions閻羅幡 could all reach perfection.</p><p>His toe lightly tapped the ground, Qin Sang started moving again, and very quickly at that, because the evil corpse had discovered those two people.</p><p>In a dent of a passageway, the two cultivators had their backs against the stone wall, defending with the help of the terrain, one of them was still okay, the other one was pale, injured.</p><p>They jointly urged a circular artifact, opening up a golden light shield. Numerous malicious ghost are crowding outside, slamming into the light shield savagely, causing the light shield to dim and flicker, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Their faces were filled with anxiety, they all the way here, nearly exhausted, numerous malicious ghosts completely blocking their path, with something even more terrifying than malicious ghosts.</p><p>If there's still no one coming to rescue them, there's only death for them!</p><p>Qin Sang rushed here, noticing the two people surrounded by numerous malicious ghost, find a secluded place to deploy the Ten Directions閻羅Formation, then intentionally showed up in the formation, shouting clearly, “Ahead is that Ning and Chai daoist friends, don't make a sound, remember to find a chance to escape.”</p><p>The voice caused a stir, those malicious ghosts were alarmed by Qin Sang, turning to attack Qin Sang. The two people under siege instantly felt a lot less pressure, immediately identifying the opportunity to fully activate the artifact, breaking out of the encirclement.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang coming to assist, the two gratefully bowed, “Thank you senior Qin for saving our lives!”</p><p>“Let's not chat……”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly informed them of the situation, “Go up and help daoist friend Yun quickly, I'll cover the rear.”</p>
