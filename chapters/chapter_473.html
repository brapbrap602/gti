<h1>Chapter 466: Sanctuary</h1><p>Grandmother Jing seemed oblivious to Qin Sang's warning, her gaze fixed on the depths of the canyon. Her eyes were unusually bright, holding a chaotic, profound, and mysterious depth, as if she were employing some kind of ocular mystic art.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, concealing his aura as best he could as he silently traversed the black mist.</p><p>As he drew closer to the other presence, Qin Sang finally sensed a faint aura. A flicker of joy crossed his face as he stopped and couldn't help but transmit another warning to Grandmother Jing.</p><p>"Senior, I don't believe it's one of our Cold Region companions. It's someone from the Heavenly Ascent Alliance…"</p><p>All those who had entered from the Cold Region this time were familiar faces. Based on their aura, Qin Sang could basically determine their identity, similar to the Wei cultivator from the Ancient Intent Sect whom they had encountered earlier.</p><p>The aura of the person ahead was unfamiliar. Qin Sang had dealt with the Heavenly Ascent Alliance for three years, crossing paths with most of their experts. He had also encountered a few he wasn't as familiar with.</p><p>This was the second person they had encountered since entering Dire Peak. Having traveled such a distance with Grandmother Jing and only encountering two people showed just how vast Dire Peak was.</p><p>This person was an opponent of the Heavenly Ascent Alliance, and Qin Sang naturally didn't want to miss this opportunity. However, it depended on Grandmother Jing's will.</p><p>Qin Sang pointed ahead and looked at Grandmother Jing inquiringly.</p><p>He found that Grandmother Jing was still staring into the deep valley, not even glancing in the direction Qin Sang indicated, and declared decisively, "Go around."</p><p>This was different from last time.</p><p>Last time, the Wei cultivator was from the Cold Region, and Grandmother Jing was unwilling to kill her own kind.</p><p>This time, the reason was clearly different.</p><p>Serving different masters, Grandmother Jing wouldn't have the slightest pity for a Heavenly Ascent Alliance cultivator.  She simply didn't want to waste time on this person.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the reason, sighing inwardly, and obeyed.</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>After taking a few steps, Qin Sang's expression suddenly shifted, a hesitant look appearing on his face. "Forgive my boldness, Senior, but… how far are we from our destination?"</p><p>Grandmother Jing finally deigned to withdraw her gaze, looking deeply at Qin Sang. After a moment's thought, she said succinctly, "Soon!"</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly thought, "As I suspected," and immediately pursued the matter with a sincere tone. "I have a small request… When we encounter restrictions later, could you please help me conceal my spiritual power fluctuations so that he doesn't discover my presence?"</p><p>Grandmother Jing was unwilling to intervene, but Qin Sang didn't want to give up this rare opportunity.</p><p>Within Dire Peak, he didn't have to worry about attracting the attention of powerful beings. He could use both the Ebony Sword and the Ten Yama Banners without restraint, coupled with the combat experience he had accumulated over the past three years.</p><p>Even without Grandmother Jing's help, Qin Sang was 90% confident in taking down his opponent.</p><p>Once they reached their destination, he could withdraw; he wouldn't be needed for what followed.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to return alone, so it was best not to let the opponent discover his presence, lest it raise their guard, or even prompt them to leave.</p><p>This place was riddled with restrictions, some of which were terrifyingly powerful. Even with Grandmother Jing's guidance, Qin Sang had to concentrate fully, making it difficult to avoid detection. He could only rely on Grandmother Jing to help conceal his spiritual power fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang had merely asked tentatively, but unexpectedly, Grandmother Jing readily agreed.</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. Putting aside distracting thoughts, he focused on navigating the canyon according to Grandmother Jing's instructions.</p><p>With Grandmother Jing's help in concealment, the Heavenly Ascent Alliance cultivator remained unaware.  He even passed by Qin Sang, still focused on collecting Star Essence Stones.</p><p>Bypassing the cultivator, urged on by Grandmother Jing, Qin Sang quickened his pace.</p><p>Grandmother Jing was no longer stingy with her assistance. When they encountered powerful restriction fragments blocking their path, she would help Qin Sang break through them.</p><p>The further they went, the denser and more dangerous the restrictions became, making it almost impossible to move. Without Grandmother Jing, Qin Sang would never have been able to reach this point alone.</p><p>As he walked, Qin Sang memorized the route, fearing he wouldn't be able to find his way back otherwise.</p><p>Grandmother Jing's objective was very clear, proceeding in a straight line.</p><p>Deeper into the canyon, the chill intensified. The black mist thinned somewhat, yet paradoxically, it became even darker. Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he could barely see far with his naked eyes.</p><p>While breaking through the restrictions, Qin Sang observed his surroundings with his peripheral vision.</p><p>Along the way, countless rocks and black weeds had proliferated, leading him to believe it was a desolate, secluded valley.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just now, a stone path paved with flagstones appeared beneath their feet. Although the path was almost unrecognizable due to the shattered flagstones, it was still clear that it was man-made.</p><p>Grandmother Jing instructed Qin Sang to follow the stone path. Her destination seemed to be at its end.</p><p>What lay ahead?</p><p>Curiosity stirred within Qin Sang, but his expression remained unchanged. He obediently followed Grandmother Jing's instructions.</p><p>Meanwhile, within his spiritual space, a storm brewed. He secretly mobilized his divine sense, while the Ebony Sword quietly left his spiritual space, its blade trembling slightly, poised to strike.</p><p>He wouldn't, and dared not, initiate an attack on Grandmother Jing.</p><p>Given Grandmother Jing's character, she likely wouldn't go back on her word and turn on him.</p><p>However, caution was necessary. If Grandmother Jing had been feigning all along, he could only accept his fate, but he wouldn't surrender without a fight, resisting to the death.</p><p>He believed the Ebony Sword would definitely leave a lasting impression on her!</p><p>The stone path was incredibly long.</p><p>Finally, two broken stone pillars appeared ahead, standing on either side of the path.</p><p>The pillars were immensely thick, like two colossal pillars supporting the heavens.  One could imagine how tall they must have been when intact, perhaps even reaching beyond the canyon, touching the sky.</p><p>Unfortunately, now they were almost entirely broken, leaving only remnants.</p><p>Numerous large stones were piled haphazardly around the pillars. Beyond them, the view was unclear, appearing to be a plaza paved with stones.</p><p>Qin Sang paused slightly. Not hearing any further instructions from Grandmother Jing, he continued walking, soon reaching the two stone pillars.  A vast plaza came into view.</p><p>It was hard to imagine such a large space existing at the bottom of the canyon, complete with the ruins of a magnificent plaza.</p><p>Standing at the edge of the plaza, Qin Sang felt incredibly small.</p><p>The circular plaza was composed of countless identical, enormous stone blocks, each measuring tens of meters in length and width.  These stones were arranged in concentric circles, forming a peculiar shape.</p><p>The outer edge was high, while the center was low, creating a funnel-like structure.</p><p>If it were reversed, with the center high and the outer edge low, it would resemble an altar for celestial sacrifices.</p><p>With such a bizarre shape, Qin Sang couldn't discern the plaza's true purpose.</p><p>Several similar stone pillars stood at the outermost edge of the plaza, all broken at their bases.  The plaza was littered with large and small stone blocks, the remnants of those pillars.</p><p>The debris that had crashed into the plaza had caused considerable damage, creating a scene of decay.</p><p>Even more peculiar, Qin Sang noticed that there wasn't a single restriction fragment within the plaza.</p><p>The entire canyon was riddled with restrictions, posing danger at every turn, yet this place was an exception.</p><p>The plaza seemed to be the only sanctuary within the canyon.</p>
