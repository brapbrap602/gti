<h1>Chapter 1278: Counterattack</h1><p>"The human race? It seems there’s still a chance to encounter them on the battlefield," Old Demon Ye sneered coldly.</p><p>"It is said that this person relies on a set of Flame Control Demon Banners, with most of his abilities tied to them. Without the banners, he’s merely a troublesome opponent. The Flame Control Demon Banners are external tools, not his life-bound treasure. If we seize them, we can use them ourselves. Why not devise a plan to kill him and take the treasure? Not only would we eliminate a major enemy, but we’d also gain a powerful tool," Canghong Zhenren’s eyes gleamed with a cold light, clearly having plotted this for some time.</p><p>He had never met Qin Sang, and most of his knowledge about him came from hearsay. The Old Demon Ye before him had clashed with Qin Sang twice—once allowing Qin Sang to escape unscathed, and the other time losing a clone. No one likely understood Qin Sang better than him.</p><p>Old Demon Ye shook his head, warning Canghong Zhenren not to underestimate the enemy. "During the battle at the Abyssal Ruins, he couldn’t control so many demon banners, yet he still displayed remarkable swordsmanship. He’s also proficient in Thunder Evasion, with astonishing speed, which allowed him to escape. I initially thought it was his innate ability, so I didn’t suspect his identity as a demon. Additionally, he’s highly skilled in the art of formations, able to move freely through the ancient restrictions at the core of the Abyssal Ruins. Even without the banners, he’s not an easy opponent..."</p><p>"So, in the future, even I’ll have to avoid him?" Canghong Zhenren frowned deeply, only now realizing how formidable Qin Sang was.</p><p>"With the lesson from Chi Fa, Zhenyi Laodao will definitely not let him be isolated and fall into our schemes. However, there’s no need to deliberately avoid him either..." Old Demon Ye snorted. "The battle at the Blood Pool was an accident. I had to focus all my efforts on seizing and protecting the Jade Bone, forcing me to sacrifice a clone to block him. During the fight, I noticed that while he could control demonic flames, he hadn’t fully tamed them, likely due to limitations in his cultivation. There are many flaws. If we encounter him again, as long as we wish to leave, he won’t be able to stop us. And such flaws can sometimes be fatal!"</p><p>"But other fellow Daoists can’t withstand such terrifying demonic flames and would be slaughtered at will!"</p><p>Canghong Zhenren’s expression grew restless as he paced back and forth, his tone dissatisfied. "We’ve paid such a price, even causing setbacks in the war, only to bring back a dead Jade Bone. Judging by the results, we shouldn’t have been so cautious!"</p><p>Old Demon Ye’s eyes shifted, fixing on Canghong Zhenren. "Are you blaming me for acting too late? Don’t forget, this decision was agreed upon by you and Tianzheng Daoyou. Back then, the demon in the Sin God Palace was reduced to a wisp of a remnant soul, yet it nearly wiped us out. Do you remember how perilous that was? The Blood Lake’s seal is far weaker than the Sin God Palace’s. This person’s body was intact, and he had the strength to break the seal at any time. He was imprisoned in the Purple Palace precisely because of his overwhelming killing intent. If we had failed to suppress him, we would have become accomplices in releasing a demon. At that point, I might have lost more than just a clone—who in the entire North Star Realm could have subdued him?"</p><p>Canghong Zhenren had no retort and sighed, "I’m not blaming you, Daoyou, just lamenting. The Purple Palace is extremely mysterious, and all other secret realms are intricately connected to it. This was a chance to glimpse ancient secrets, perhaps the only one in our lifetimes, and we missed it."</p><p>Old Demon Ye shared Canghong Zhenren’s sentiment and softened his tone. "That Jade Bone is quite peculiar. Not only is it incredibly hard, but it also seems to retain a strange energy. There might be information or secret techniques left behind by the person before their death. If we can decipher the bone, we might uncover something."</p><p>Canghong Zhenren nodded slightly, his interest waning. "Let’s hope so. But what’s urgent now is the war. The number of top experts in the Two Realms Alliance has surpassed ours. I’m afraid we’ve lost our chance to take down the Heavenly Path Alliance."</p><p>Old Demon Ye walked over to the snowy mountain in the hall and suddenly made a startling move—he raised his hand and struck it with a palm strike, hitting the mountain directly.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>In an instant, the snowy mountain shattered into pieces.</p><p>The hall was now empty, the ancient restrictions dissipated, and the fragments of the mountain vanished completely, as if they had never existed.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>"It seems you’ve been too immersed in the battlefield, Daoyou, swayed by the desire for victory and forgetting our original purpose. Or do you truly have ambitions of domination? I can lend my full support if so."</p><p>Turning around, Old Demon Ye gave Canghong Zhenren a deep look.</p><p>Hearing this, Canghong Zhenren was startled. He lowered his head in thought for a while, and when he looked up again, his expression had returned to calm. "What do you mean, Daoyou?"</p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p>Old Demon Ye declared decisively, his finger tracing a curve in the air. "I’ve already ordered people to fortify the defenses at Yu City, the northern entrance to the Sin Abyss. We’ll retreat all the way there and rely on the spirit formations and the Obsidian Towers for defense. No matter how many experts the Two Realms Alliance has, unless they’re willing to pay any price, they won’t be able to break through easily. The Two Realms Alliance endured humiliation for a century—why can’t we bide our time? As long as it doesn’t affect our plans, let them have their moment of triumph."</p><p>"This retreat will span over thirty thousand miles, undoing a century of effort!"</p><p>Canghong Zhenren sighed deeply but ultimately agreed with Old Demon Ye’s plan. "With the Two Realms now so powerful, there will inevitably be casualties during the retreat. We must avoid any mutiny at all costs. Ah, I nearly forgot!"</p><p>Suddenly, Canghong Zhenren exclaimed softly and whispered a secret to Old Demon Ye—a secret about Qin Sang.</p><p>"Qin Sang and Dongyang Bo are at odds. Qin Sang was originally a disciple of Shaohua Mountain but for some reason defected. After forming his Nascent Soul, he disguised himself as a demon, unwilling to show his true face, likely out of fear of Dongyang Bo. Their hatred runs deep, like fire and water!"</p><p>Hearing this, Old Demon Ye’s eyes lit up. "You’ve got quite the means, Daoyou, to uncover such a secret! However, Dongyang Bo, though cunning, isn’t foolish enough to help us scheme against an ally at this time. It won’t be easy to persuade him."</p><p>"How will we know if we don’t try? It depends on how deep their hatred runs. Even if he refuses now, he might not in the future."</p><p>Canghong Zhenren didn’t seem concerned, treating it as a casual remark.</p><p>As they were about to discuss other matters, someone rushed in to report that the front-line camp had been attacked. This time, the Two Realms Alliance’s assault was fierce and unprecedented.</p><p>"They’ve come so quickly!"</p><p>The two were inwardly alarmed and quickly made arrangements.</p><p>...</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance had divided into three forces, sounding the horn of their counterattack.</p><p>When the Blood Lake opened, Zhenyi Laodao had dispatched troops to take the initiative, clashing with Canghong Zhenren several times. Without the help of demon kings, they were at a disadvantage and concentrated their forces at the two main camps: Stone Bend Mountain and Wangdong City.</p><p>Now, Zhenyi Laodao and Tongyou Mojun were leading the armies at these two camps.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun were in the center, commanding the newly gathered forces under the various patriarchs. They had just made a name for themselves, with shallow foundations, and their forces were the weakest of the three. However, they were also the most flexible, ready to support either flank at any time.</p><p>Zhenyi Laodao, worried that Qin Sang and Qing Jun lacked battlefield experience and might fall into an ambush, had deliberately arranged it this way.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>This is from yesterday.</p>
