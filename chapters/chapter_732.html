<h1>Chapter 724 Shame</h1><p>Chapter 724 Shame</p><p>“Back then, the Daoist Master sacrificed himself to draw the bandits away.  After separating from him, we rushed to the island to seek help.  Senior Ran Luo led people out to rescue the Daoist Master, but to no avail…”</p><p>In the quiet room, Qin Sang sat with the Wang sisters, listening to their account of the events of that year.</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat startled.  No wonder the Wang sisters were so excited to see him.  They saw Qin Sang single-handedly intercept the enemy, allowing them to escape instead of using them as bait; therefore, they regarded Qin Sang as their savior, remembering him to this day.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't actually thought that much about it.  Urging them to leave quickly was because he felt their cultivation was too low, that they wouldn't be of any help and would only be a hindrance.  An unintentional act, yet it held extraordinary significance for others.</p><p>However, they were right about one thing.  Qin Sang truly hadn't considered using them as bait to distract the enemy while he escaped.</p><p>“Congratulations, Daoist Friend, on achieving the Golden Core stage. Your younger sister must be close to a breakthrough as well?  How are the other three Daoist friends doing?”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled at the two.</p><p>The elder Wang sister blushed.</p><p>“My breakthrough was thanks to the Daoist Master.  During the years I followed the Daoist Master, witnessing his profound cultivation and his unwavering dedication to his practice, it was a great encouragement to us.</p><p>“The precious spiritual materials the Daoist Master gave us allowed my sister and me to accumulate enough resources for cultivation, to buy high-quality Demon Slayer Pills.  My sister gave her pill to me, which allowed me to finally break through.  Now I am helping my sister gather resources for her Demon Slayer Pill. Given her aptitude, she should successfully form her Golden Core without incident.</p><p>“The other three Daoist friends have returned to the Inner Sea.</p><p>“After returning, both seniors tried again, but unfortunately, both failed to form their Golden Cores. They frankly stated that they had given up on forming a Golden Core, taking their years of savings and returning home to raise their only sons.</p><p>“Daoist Friend Peng also sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough, but his cultivation method is unique, requiring the support of a master during the breakthrough, so he had to return to his sect. He left not long ago; I don't know if he has successfully formed his Golden Core.</p><p>“Before leaving, all three Daoist friends urged me to find the Daoist Master.”</p><p>Just then, Ran Luo entered from outside.  Seeing Qin Sang, she was also overjoyed.</p><p>When asked about his experiences over the years, Qin Sang simply offered the explanation he had prepared, claiming that the enemy had been too powerful to contend with back then, and he had been chased into the depths of the Demon Sea and lost his way.  Later, fearing that those people would remain near Duyan Island, he didn't dare return for a long time, and had to struggle to survive in the Demon Sea. He only dared to return after learning that the great battle had ended.</p><p>The three women had no doubts, all sighing with emotion.</p><p>“It's the same hard cultivation wherever you are, it's nothing… However, I have just become a guest elder of the Chamber of Commerce, and before I could do any work, I was gone for twenty years. I've let Daoist Friend Ran down…”</p><p>Qin Sang said apologetically.</p><p>Ran Luo waved her hand.  “It's fortunate that the Daoist Master escaped safely. Compared to the Daoist Master's safety, the Chamber of Commerce's affairs are insignificant.  We should blame those who caused the great chaos and those Wu tribe bandits.  Daoist Master, why don't you rest for a few days? I'll send word to Elder Zou, and we'll hold a welcoming banquet for you in a few days.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to make such a fuss, and quickly dissuaded Ran Luo.  “Daoist Friend Ran, you don't know, when I first entered the Demon Sea, I heard about a certain spiritual herb on Tianwu Island, which I happen to need, and I intended to go and collect it fifteen years ago. However, I was trapped in the Demon Sea, wasting time until now. The herb is already ripe, and if I delay any longer, I fear it will be taken by a demonic beast. Time is pressing, so let's not bother.  Daoist Friend, please get the materials, I will fulfill my duties as a guest elder, refine the artifact, and then set off.”</p><p>Ran Luo quickly asked, “Does that herb grow near a demonic beast's lair?  If it's dangerous, Daoist Master, you should pick a few helpers from the Chamber of Commerce to go with you.”</p><p>“It's fine. If it were fifteen years ago, I wouldn't have been entirely confident.  As the saying goes, misfortune may be the beginning of good fortune. Being trapped in the Demon Sea, I also gained much, and my strength is incomparable to what it was then.”</p><p>Qin Sang was confident and continued, “I have one small matter I would like to ask Daoist Friend for help with.”</p><p>Ran Luo said solemnly, “Daoist Master, please speak.”</p><p>At this time, the Wang sisters wisely took their leave.</p><p>Leaving the quiet room and closing the door, the elder Wang sister saw that Qin Sang only nodded slightly at them without inviting them to stay.  Her expression was somewhat downcast.</p><p>“Sister…”</p><p>The younger sister took her sister's arm, looking into her eyes, hesitant to speak.</p><p>Her sister shook her head, as if speaking to herself, as if admonishing herself, “The Daoist Master is a dedicated cultivator.”</p><p>Her younger sister sighed softly and hugged her sister tightly.</p><p>The two sisters, leaning on each other, walked away slowly.</p><p>In the quiet room, Ran Luo watched the Wang sisters leave, then suddenly chuckled.  "Perhaps the Daoist doesn't know," she said, "that the Wang sisters, deeply impressed by your character, have been tirelessly searching for you since the Duoyan Island reopened. They've even been secretly investigating your attackers.  Truly remarkable loyalty."</p><p>"I am deeply honored, but I hardly deserve such praise…"</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, changing the subject. "Daoist Ran, I intend to try my luck at the Seven Killing Hall. I'd appreciate it if the Chamber of Commerce could keep an eye out and let me know which faction will likely lead the next opening.  The Chamber operates mainly in the Inner Sea, so gathering such information shouldn't be difficult, should it?"</p><p>He had been in the Canglang Sea for nearly twenty-five years.</p><p>Historically, factions interested in the Seven Killing Hall would start hinting at their intentions well in advance.</p><p>The resources needed to prepare and break the celestial array are staggering. Even the wealthiest factions struggle to bear the cost, so they typically begin selling access permits decades ahead of time to recoup some of the investment.</p><p>He had expected the Two-Clan War to impact the Seven Killing Hall's opening, but now that the conflict is over, things are returning to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang was determined to secure access to the Seven Killing Hall.  He needed that permit to feel safe.</p><p>He was perfectly aware, however, that even if he found the ancient teleportation array, he might not be able to return home.</p><p>While the Seven Killing Hall can be artificially opened, the Ziwei Palace on the other side cannot.  Anyone teleporting there would be trapped and face unknown dangers.</p><p>He had to wait for the Seven Killing Hall to open naturally to return to Xiao Han Domain.</p><p>But finding the ancient teleportation array would not be easy.  If he waited until the next natural opening, it would be another two hundred years, far too long. This attempt was imperative.</p><p>Ran Luo was surprised.  "Daoist, when did you decide to go to the Seven Killing Hall? How much do you know about it? Don't rely on hearsay! The easily obtainable treasures have long been looted. What remains are extremely dangerous areas, many beyond the capabilities of even Nascent Soul masters. Those who enter now either possess exceptional strength or are desperate and facing a dead end. You've only recently formed your Golden Core, your lifespan is long, and your future is bright. Why risk it?"</p>
