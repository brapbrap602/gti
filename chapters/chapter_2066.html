<h1>Chapter 2057: The Man in the Ear</h1><p>“This person must be the mysterious expert mentioned by the Siyou tribesman…”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was serious. He hadn't expected that arresting two Siyou tribesmen would require not only numerous Transcending Void experts but also a Transcending Void late-stage expert!</p><p>This showed that the two Siyou tribesmen were definitely not ordinary individuals.</p><p>Now wasn't the time to delve into this. Even if the opponent was such a powerful expert, since the fight had already begun, there was no turning back.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced. Although the mysterious expert had released his oppressive aura, attacking from a distance, judging by his escape techniques, it was impossible for him to instantly cross the vast expanse of sea between them.  This was his chance.</p><p>As long as Su Nu and the Siyou tribesman could reach safety before the expert arrived, he could use his lightning escape technique to flee.</p><p>Before that, however, Qin Sang had to ensure he wasn't entangled by his two current opponents. If he were to fall into a three-person encirclement, even with his mastery of escape techniques, he wouldn't have any room to maneuver.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gust of wind interrupted Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>The arrow's sound seemed to be right beside his ear. A silver light shot towards his face. Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, acutely aware that this arrow was different from the previous ones.</p><p>Que Li also sensed Quan Lao's presence and changed his strategy accordingly.</p><p>He hadn't tried to stop Su Nu earlier because, on one hand, Qin Sang's strength was truly astonishing, and on the other, he was waiting for this opportunity. If he couldn't stop the Siyou clan's young master, he would trap Qin Sang, forcing him to seek help from his accomplices!</p><p>Que Li, who had been steadily retreating, suddenly stopped and stamped his foot on the sea below.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>Waves rose, and amidst the spray, the seawater transformed into a blue-scaled dragon, majestic and awe-inspiring, rising from the sea.</p><p>The blue dragon roared, flying to Que Li's feet, allowing him to stand on its head before transforming into a blue light and soaring into the sky.</p><p>Simultaneously, Que Li had somehow switched to a larger, more exquisite blue bow. Riding the dragon, he surveyed the scene from above, his bowstring twanging incessantly, arrows raining down like a storm.  Some were aimed at Qin Sang, while others flew past, exploding in mid-air.</p><p>The fragments of the spirit arrows didn't dissipate as usual but drifted like willow catkins in the wind.</p><p>Qin Sang, surrounded by them, instinctively felt something was amiss. Then, a heavy pressure bore down on him from all sides, causing his breath to catch.</p><p>If someone were to look down from above, they would see a vast expanse of blue, a huge sphere of water seemingly appearing out of nowhere, enclosing Qin Sang.</p><p>Within the water sphere, silver lights darted constantly. Que Li's shooting speed had increased; each draw of his bow unleashed ten or even dozens of silver lights.</p><p>These lights pierced the water sphere, instantly transforming into silver arrowfish, their slender heads as sharp as arrowheads, frantically attacking Qin Sang.</p><p>They were formed from the purest water elemental energy, inexhaustible in this location.  Within the water sphere, they seemed to receive some kind of enhancement, swarming in great numbers, their power formidable. Qin Sang was overwhelmed, dispersing one group only to have more arrowfish immediately replace them, all while enduring the ever-increasing pressure, like a lone ship in a storm.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the sword array.</p><p>Ji Qiong was unaware of the situation outside but calculated that Quan Lao should be arriving soon, alerted by the warning.</p><p>Using his divine hearing ability, he had already perceived some subtle fluctuations imperceptible to ordinary people, but he didn't rush to counterattack. Gently rubbing his right ear, rings of gray ripples spread out.</p><p>These ripples were unaffected by the sword stars, expanding endlessly in the starry sky, centered on him.  The sword light could not erase them.</p><p>Then Ji Qiong flicked his sleeve, throwing out a black seed.  The seed, about the size of a fingernail and shaped like a melon seed, was of unknown origin. Upon contact with the ripples, it instantly took root and sprouted in the void, sending out slender tendrils.</p><p>These tendrils swayed and writhed, as agile as snakes, actively exploring in all directions, growing at a visible speed.  After merging with the ripples, they spread outwards even faster, filling a vast expanse of the starry sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A sword star was enveloped by the tendrils and instantly dimmed, its starlight completely concealed within the dense network.</p><p>Sword light rained down, constantly striking, but the tendrils grew faster, showing no signs of stopping. At this rate, it seemed the entire starry sky would become a sea of tendrils, and the sword stars would be completely surrounded.</p><p>Ji Qiong smiled confidently, his figure disappearing silently, concealed by the tendrils as he moved towards a fluctuation he had sensed with his divine hearing.</p><p>His plan and Que Li's coincided perfectly;  he aimed not only to break the formation but also to have the vines take root in the stars, sealing the sword array and trapping Qin Sang's spirit sword, rendering it unrecoverable!  </p><p>If Qin Sang tried to escape, he'd have to abandon his spirit sword—equivalent to losing an arm for a sword cultivator!</p><p>Just as Ji Qiong felt he'd succeeded, he sensed an unfamiliar energy shift, and the sword array's formation instantly changed.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang had seen through his ploy and was counterattacking, Ji Qiong couldn't give him a chance. He immediately pushed his spiritual hearing ability to its limit. The vines seemed poised to engulf the entire starry sky.</p><p>However, the formation's change far exceeded Ji Qiong's expectations.  Brilliant starlight pierced through the gaps in the vines, immediately suppressing and halting their rampant growth.</p><p>The number of sword stars doubled.  Ji Qiong's eyes narrowed, a sense of danger gripping him.  Then came the roar of a tiger and the cry of a phoenix; a brilliant light flooded the heavens, showering down boundless starlight.</p><p>Countless vines shattered. Within the starlight, something appeared—a terrifying beast, or perhaps an unparalleled sword light, cleaving the heavens.</p><p>Overwhelmed by the power, Ji Qiong felt his blood freeze.  His mind reeled in shock.</p><p>The sword's power far surpassed his expectations. Gone was his composure. Desperate, he abandoned his entanglement with Qin Sang, frantically changing his hand seals.</p><p>"Swish, swish, swish!"</p><p>The vines surged wildly.</p><p>Waves of grey surged above Ji Qiong, layer upon layer of woven vines forming a defensive barrier against the ferocious sword light.</p><p>Suddenly, a deafening roar of a monstrous beast echoed from the horizon.</p><p>幽幽寒光  appeared at the four corners of the heavens.  In an instant, a biting cold wind swept across the land.</p><p>Four pillars appeared at the four corners of the heavens—four enormous serpents, their gaping maws spewing icy breath into the sky.</p><p>A blizzard descended, creating a realm of extreme cold.</p><p>"Crack, crack, crack…"</p><p>Ice rapidly spread along the vines.  The once agile vines became slow and stiff, until encased in a layer of hard ice, completely frozen.</p><p>In a moment, the world was blanketed in white; the frozen vines lay rigid.</p><p>Ji Qiong's plan to use the vines to block the sword light was thwarted.</p><p>Trapped within the sword array, isolated from the outside, he didn't see Qin Sang summon a Dharma image, unaware of the situation outside.  He believed Qin Sang was fighting two opponents of comparable cultivation, and that Que Li's strength would certainly restrain Qin Sang. Qin Sang's earlier actions of only trapping him with the sword array without further attack seemed to confirm this.</p><p>Logically, Qin Sang shouldn't have been able to counter his attack, yet the reality defied belief.</p><p>The situation took a sudden turn, shocking Ji Qiong.  In his haste, he activated a protective treasure.</p><p>A sharp cracking sound followed. The treasure withstood the sword light for only an instant before shattering!</p><p>Frantically, Ji Qiong threw out various treasures, all to no avail.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, Qin Sang was using the layered formation technique.  After his battle with the two Palace Masters of Li Yu Palace, Qin Sang identified his own weaknesses and, after diligent cultivation, had perfected this technique, its power incomparable to before, far beyond ordinary means to resist.</p><p>The sword light, unstoppable, cut through every obstacle, approaching within inches!</p><p>No, this wasn't merely sword light; it was the Hui Ying sword, channeling the power of the sword array, aiming for Ji Qiong's death!</p><p>Ji Qiong's eyes widened.  There was no barrier left before him; death was imminent.</p><p>At the last moment, Ji Qiong struggled to cast a spell, but the ethereal light it formed was instantly pierced.</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>A terrifying shockwave erupted in the void.</p><p>Que Li, who had been fiercely attacking Qin Sang, turned her head, witnessing a scene that filled her with horror.</p><p>The void enveloped by the sword array, once filled with obscure energy, had now condensed into a single sword.</p><p>Ji Qiong appeared beneath the sword's point, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p>"Brother Ji!"</p><p>Que Li cried out, swiftly turning her longbow towards the Hui Ying sword, but it was too late.</p><p>From afar, on the sea, Quan Lao, rushing at full speed, witnessed this and was instantly enraged.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>The roar shook the heavens, a furious rage.  Qin Sang ignored it.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Huiying sword plunged from the top of Ji Qiong’s head, passing clean through. Ji Qiong appeared unchanged, but his eyes glazed over, his body stiffening.</p><p>Then, a trickle of blood seeped from his brow, a crimson line perfectly bisecting his forehead. His body swayed slightly, splitting in two, spraying blood and innards.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>Even Qin Sang was slightly surprised.  He hadn’t expected to kill his opponent with a single strike.  The power of the layered formations exceeded his expectations.</p><p>Que Li’s pupils constricted, her grip on the blue bow trembling slightly. Fear welled up in her heart.  Her opponent was clearly of comparable strength, yet he had defeated two of them, killing Ji Qiong. This power was simply shocking.</p><p>Now it was one against one…</p><p>Quan Lao, watching from afar, witnessed Ji Qiong’s death, unable to intervene.  He remained outwardly calm, his eyes devoid of emotion, only the bulging veins in his tightly clenched hands betraying his inner fury.</p><p>Suddenly, Quan Lao paused, his normally distinct black and white eyes turning completely white.</p><p>Within the white eyes, only a pinprick of black remained, staring coldly at Qin Sang.  His lips moved slightly, silently chanting an incantation.  A deeper weariness settled upon Quan Lao; he visibly aged, clearly paying a heavy price.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable sense of danger, and looked up.</p><p>The sun blazed in a clear blue sky.</p><p>The next moment, a long fissure ripped across the heavens, revealing a chaotic scene within. A stone tablet tumbled from the rift.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a tremendous threat from the tablet, but before he could examine it, an unexpected event unfolded.</p><p>A grey ripple appeared in the void beside the battlefield, spreading outwards in concentric circles.  A strange energy emanated from its center.</p><p>The ripples gradually formed an ear-like shape, then with a flash of white light, a tiny figure leaped out. The creature was no bigger than a pea, naked and unclothed, but with fully formed features and limbs.</p><p>The tiny figure, terrified and apprehensive, didn't even dare to look behind, darting away at incredible speed, shouting.</p><p>“Daoist Que Li, buy me some time!”</p><p>“Brother Ji?” Que Li’s fear turned to joy.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the miniature figure in astonishment. Its energy was distinctly different from Ji Qiong’s, yet there was an undeniable connection between them, suggesting a singular entity of some sort.</p><p>Clearly, Ji Qiong wasn’t dead. This was likely some life-saving technique of the Quanfeng clan.</p><p>Qin Sang wouldn't let him escape so easily. His astral body immediately raised the Huiying sword and attacked.</p><p>Que Li, having just attempted to rescue Ji Qiong, had slowed her attack. Qin Sang’s main body seized the opening, ignoring both Que Li and the heavenly tablet, and charged towards the tiny figure.</p><p>Que Li couldn’t allow Ji Qiong to die before her eyes.  Regardless of the friendship between their clans, she needed to join forces with Ji Qiong to stand a chance against Qin Sang.</p><p>She propelled herself forward, the blue dragon transforming into a blue streak towards the tiny figure.  Simultaneously, she nocked an arrow, aiming for Qin Sang's vital points.</p><p>The tiny figure fled without looking back, its aura steadily increasing. Then its expression froze; it no longer felt the immense pressure from the Huiying sword. A thought struck it, and it cried out, “Ambush!”</p><p>By this time, the blue dragon’s light had formed a protective barrier around the tiny figure.</p><p>The Huiying sword struck, causing only a ripple in the barrier. It failed to pierce it.</p><p>Que Li paused, realizing what was happening. She saw, from the corner of her eye, a five-colored light shoot from the sleeve of Qin Sang’s astral body, seemingly originating from a crown.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang’s main body, holding nothing back, swatted away all the arrows, the recoil from the blue bow causing her arm to tremble.</p><p>The seamless coordination of Qin Sang's main body and astral body left a fleeting moment of opportunity. The five-colored light struck.</p><p>The Zheng Wu-xing Jinjue Shen Guang  main restriction, having been directed towards the tiny figure's protection, left Que Li unable to react. She froze in place, her consciousness intact, yet finding herself unable to use any of her treasures.  Panic seized her as another five-colored light approached.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>This five-colored light, however, felt utterly different. A profound sense of danger filled Que Li's heart.</p><p>A struggle flashed in her eyes, a desperate roar escaping her throat as she was forced to use her clan’s strongest life-saving technique.  She channeled her life force, her body cracking and breaking out in dense silvery scales.</p><p>The silver scales, stained with blood, shimmered with an eerie glow, impossibly smooth, forcibly lifting her body to deflect the blow from her head. The reversed Five Elements Annihilation Divine Light deflected slightly upon striking the scales.</p><p>Alas, Que Li couldn’t fully evade the attack.  The reversed Five Elements Divine Light struck her chest.</p><p>In an instant, silver scales flew, a gaping wound appearing on her chest! </p>
