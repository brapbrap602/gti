<h1>Chapter 163: Corpse Sect in Sky</h1><p>Although Liu Jiang had a sense of spiritual induction, he couldn't determine an accurate direction because the stone path was winding. The two could only continue to walk downward while ensuring they were heading in the right direction.</p><p>After they zigzagged forward for a long time, they entered a stone path not long after, but then they suddenly heard a series of sounds of a fight coming from the end of it.</p><p>Among the growling sounds of Corpse Beasts, there were also the occasional sounds of human voices. They seemed a little familiar.</p><p>After they heard the sounds from ahead, the two exchanged a glance, then immediately sped up to rush forward. In all the time they had been in the cave, the only living things they had seen were the zombies. The only people who could be fighting the Corpse Beasts were their companions.</p><p>If he had been alone, Qin Sang would have hidden himself and quietly approached to take a look, without being afraid of being discovered. However, he had Liu Jiang beside him, so he gave up that idea and used all of his strength to rush forward rapidly, wondering who was fighting with the Corpse Beasts up ahead.</p><p>"Who is it!?"</p><p>Before the two could reach the end of the stone path, they suddenly heard a thunderous roar from up ahead as the other party had already discovered their tracks.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly as he recognized the voice. It was Bai Yun Mountain Man!</p><p>"Senior Bai Yun!"</p><p>Liu Jiang was even more overjoyed and increased his speed, rushing out to the end of the stone path. He saw another great hall up ahead, which was similar to the one that Qin Sang had seen before. An iron gate was tightly shut, and the great hall was messy, with a dozen or more beheaded zombies strewn about. There were two people currently fighting Corpse Beasts.</p><p>One of them was Bai Yun Mountain Man, while the other was Wu Yue Sheng.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Bai Yun, Senior Brother Wu..."</p><p>Upon seeing Wu Yue Sheng, Qin Sang's pupils shrank, but he put on an indifferent expression and greeted them while observing the situation in the hall.</p><p>Those two Corpse Beasts were extremely powerful, even more so than the one he and Liu Jiang had encountered. Bai Yun Mountain Man and Wu Yue Sheng had to use quite a bit of effort to deal with them.</p><p>However, they didn't join hands to fight together. Instead, one was on the left and the other was on the right, maintaining a great distance between them.</p><p>When he saw that the people who had arrived were Liu Jiang and Qin Sang, the alert expression on Bai Yun Mountain Man's face eased slightly. "Liu Jiang, Fellow Daoist Qin, so you two bumped into each other."</p><p>Liu Jiang turned to look at Qin Sang and immediately said, "Thanks to Senior Qin's assistance, I was able to escape from the hands of the Corpse Beast. Otherwise, I would have already lost my life to it."</p><p>"Many thanks to Fellow Daoist Qin for looking after Liu Jiang." Bai Yun Mountain Man was slightly moved as he nodded amiably at Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, Wu Yue Sheng suddenly shouted, "Fellow Daoists, now is not the time to chat. Let's finish off these two Corpse Beasts first. Junior Brother Qin, quickly come and help me."</p><p>Liu Jiang hurriedly used his Iron Lotus to help Bai Yun Mountain Man attack the Corpse Beast. Qin Sang restrained his gaze slightly and calmly rushed to the other end of the hall. Using the Five Elements Sword of Law Destruction, he cooperated with Wu Yue Sheng to fight the enemy, but he kept three-tenths of his strength in reserve.</p><p>Wu Yue Sheng pretended as if nothing had happened, so he didn't expose him.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang didn't expose Wu Yue Sheng on the spot was because Wu Yue Sheng had only been hiding in the shadows at the time, and had not made a sneak attack. There was nothing to prove it, and he had no evidence. Furthermore, if he and Wu Yue Sheng became hostile, it was unknown which side Bai Yun Mountain Man would take. It was more likely that he would sit on the sidelines and reap the benefits of their struggle.</p><p>Since he already knew that Wu Yue Sheng had ulterior motives, Qin Sang was not necessarily afraid of him, as he could be on guard.</p><p>With Qin Sang and Liu Jiang joining the fight, the two Corpse Beasts lost their arrogance and were killed one after another, turning into two piles of ashes.</p><p>"Whew!"</p><p>Wu Yue Sheng sighed with relief, walked over, and bowed to the three to show his thanks. "Thankfully, you three Fellow Daoists came in time. There was originally only one Corpse Beast in the hall, but another one suddenly appeared from somewhere. I almost ended up in a difficult situation."</p><p>After some pleasantries, Qin Sang learned that Bai Yun Mountain Man and Wu Yue Sheng had just met up as well. They had been forced to fight the Corpse Beasts and hadn't had time to catch up yet. It was always a good thing to meet companions in an unknown, dangerous place. After hearing that Liu Jiang could sense the location of Liu Shan and Qing Ting, everyone immediately decided to hurry over and meet up with them according to Qin Sang's plan.</p><p>While breaking the enchantment on the iron gate, Bai Yun Mountain Man looked at the three and pondered. "Fellow Daoists, what have you discovered during your journey? Have you figured out what this place is?"</p><p>Liu Jiang smiled wryly. "I was thinking only about saving my life. How would I have dared to look at anything else? Did Senior Bai Yun notice anything?"</p><p>"The treasures in the cave should have already been looted away, and only bones and zombies were left. I'm the same as Fellow Daoist Liu, and I didn't find anything either. I can only guess that it might be the former stronghold of a demonic sect that specializes in Corpse Refining Techniques."</p><p>Qin Sang agreed with him, then casually turned his head to ask Wu Yue Sheng.</p><p>“Brother Wu, what’s up?”</p><p>Wu Yuesheng gave an awkward laugh and hesitated before saying: “I’ve made a minor discovery, but it’s something else entirely. I just happened to be gutsy enough to pause or even turn back for observation while running for my life. I noticed that the invasion speed of the Deadly Earth Qi has slowed down quite a bit compared to when it first started. My guess is that the Deadly Earth Qi had been accumulating in the lair for untold years, sealed up as it was by the restriction. When the restriction was undone, it was released all at once, making for such a frightening display. Most of the Deadly Earth Qi has already rushed out of the lair and will soon be dispersed, only a small fraction actually flowing into the cavern. If we just hold out a bit longer, the crisis will resolve itself. Plus, since there’s only so much Deadly Earth Qi left, its speed of consuming mana will keep slowing down. We don’t necessarily have to hurry in, why don’t we walk-and-search, see if we can figure out where this place is exactly, then this trip wouldn’t be a total waste.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, Wu Yuesheng’s guess was largely similar to what he had been thinking, but he hasn’t turned back for observation or confirmation. If he had accidentally been swallowed by the Deadly Earth Qi, that would have been the end of him.</p><p>Bai Yunsan also nodded slightly, “Fellow Daoist Wu is right, I had similar suspicions, I just didn’t have the guts to confirm it as he did. In addition, I found something…These people’s belongings have indeed been plundered, and all the rooms were empty, but one may sometimes miss what lies before one’s eyes, I found an iron token in the corner of a room, it was stamped with the word ‘Heavenly Corpse Sect’. I wonder if fellow Daoists have heard of this demonic sect?”</p><p>As he said that, Bai Yunsan fished out a blackish iron token, showing it to them.</p><p>The token was covered in rust spots, clearly an ancient item. It was about the size of a palm, depicting an ancient corpse on its front, identical to the pattern on the bronze gate. ‘Heavenly Corpse Sect’ was written in calligraphic strokes on its back.</p><p>This token was very likely an identification token worn by disciples of the Heavenly Corpse Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to recall the texts he had read and legends he had heard. He could think of quite a few famous demonic sects good at refining corpses, but none were called Heavenly Corpse Sect. Wu Yuesheng and Liu Jiang were also puzzled, clearly they had never heard of it either.</p><p>Wu Yuesheng pondered for a moment, found no clue, and said: “Fellow Daoist Bai, you sound rather confident, you must have come across this demonic sect, stop holding back and tell us what you know.”</p>
