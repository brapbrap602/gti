<h1>Chapter 1147: The Phoenix Butterfly</h1><p>“A Heavenly Tribulation!”</p><p>Qin Sang was shocked.  Tianmu Butterfly was undergoing a tribulation. Could it be advancing to its fourth stage?</p><p>Generally, spirit insects require a long period of slumber for metamorphosis.  The two previous advancements were no exception; Tianmu Butterfly had become a cocoon.</p><p>On Hongye Island in the Demon Sea, Tianmu Butterfly absorbed the power of lightning, gaining the ability to control thunder, and it slept for a long time to digest that power.</p><p>This time, there was no intermediate slumber. After forming a cocoon, it immediately broke free and then summoned a heavenly tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed it was related to the Qingluan power it absorbed.  It was likely more than just a simple metamorphosis; she wondered what changes would occur.</p><p>“What kind of tribulation do spirit insects face?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the tribulation clouds, her eyes full of worry.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly was undergoing the tribulation hastily; it mustn’t encounter any accidents.</p><p>He had planned to wait until he formed his Nascent Soul before seeking opportunities to help Tianmu Butterfly advance, but unexpectedly, it broke through even sooner than him.  Completely unfamiliar with spirit insect tribulations, Qin Sang didn’t know what to do.</p><p>Cultivators face the Three Calamities and the Heart Demon Tribulation.</p><p>Spirit insects, however, summon a lightning tribulation upon advancement, with unknown variables that may follow.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly is his lifebound spirit insect, connected by blood; could he help it withstand the tribulation lightning?</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, afraid that rash intervention might cause the tribulation to change.  Yun Youzi’s failed tribulation left a shadow on Qin Sang, making him wary of any heavenly tribulation.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A fissure tore open.</p><p>Intense blue light burst forth.</p><p>‘Rip!’</p><p>The light cocoon was completely torn apart.  Within the blue light, a butterfly with its wings folded, appearing languid, slowly spread its wings before Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing Tianmu Butterfly’s current appearance, Qin Sang was stunned, utterly surprised.</p><p>If not for the clear feeling of bloodline connection and familiar intimacy, he would have doubted whether this butterfly was his Tianmu Butterfly.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly’s appearance had drastically changed!</p><p>During its third stage advancement, although Tianmu Butterfly possessed the ability to control thunder, its appearance didn't change much, only the Tianmu patterns becoming more realistic; its body remained light, giving the impression of a frail ordinary butterfly.</p><p>After this transformation, except for the Tianmu on its wings, almost no trace of its former self remained. Even the Tianmu patterns were completely different!</p><p>Its size had increased several times; its wings, when spread, were over a foot wide.</p><p>Even more astonishing, its wings were no longer thin butterfly wings; they were strikingly similar to the wings of a Qingluan, transformed into a true phoenix butterfly!</p><p>The patterns on its blue wings formed a series of phoenix feather-like designs, closely connected, with flowing halos, making it almost indistinguishable from the real thing.</p><p>The only difference was the Tianmu pattern in the center of the wings, which had become long and narrow, its pupils flashing with lightning, appearing more realistic and vivid.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly circled Qin Sang, conveying excitement and affection.</p><p>Its phoenix wings fluttered, its slender tail trailing behind, gracefully unfolding as it danced, like the tail feathers of a Qingluan.</p><p>The tip of its tail curled slightly, shining with blue light, flowing in the night, scattering specks of light.</p><p>The sight was breathtakingly beautiful, beyond compare!</p><p>“It’s so beautiful!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed in wonder, almost failing to recognize his own lifebound insect.  Such a drastic change couldn't be explained by simple metamorphosis; the metamorphosis and mutation were probably simultaneous.</p><p>‘Rumble… rumble…’</p><p>The tribulation clouds were powerful.</p><p>In the distance, the Qieji Demon King suddenly stopped pursuing, gazing at the tribulation clouds, his expression grim.</p><p>After a while, the snake demon concubine and other powerful demons caught up, landing beside the Demon King, panting, “Husband, why did you stop?”</p><p>The Qieji Demon King coldly snorted, “If I go there now and trigger a change in the tribulation, wouldn’t I be taking the brunt of it for him?!”</p><p>“That is… a tribulation cloud?”</p><p>The concubine exclaimed, finally noticing the abnormality of the dark clouds in the sky.</p><p>The aura of the tribulation lightning was vastly different from ordinary thunder; as the demon king's daughter and wife, the concubine naturally knew these secrets.</p><p>“To dare undergo a tribulation in front of me!”</p><p>The Qieji Demon King showed annoyance, angrily saying, “Even if it miraculously survives the tribulation, the thief will certainly be severely weakened… a suicidal fool!”</p><p>“Husband, have you recognized the thief’s identity? He could silently infiltrate the Wan Snake Abyss; his escape and sword techniques are exceptional. He certainly isn’t an unknown figure.”</p><p>The concubine dared not act rashly. Even from this distance, the aura of the tribulation still made her tremble, fear flashing in her eyes, mixed with a hint of envy.  She was only at the mid-stage of her妖丹, the transformation still a distant prospect.</p><p>Lord Qīanji's brow furrowed. "I initially thought it was a young妖族 thief with Qingluan bloodline, but after the chase, I'm uncertain.  Even among the Yuan Ying masters of the two realms, few have grasped the sword intent. This person is only now undergoing tribulation. Could it be a human prodigy?"</p><p>"My lord, why worry? Whether cultivator or妖族, won't we know once we see the tribulation thunder?"</p><p>The concubine gazed at the tribulation clouds.  Human and妖族 tribulations have different thunders.</p><p>Suddenly, Lord Qīanji made a questioning sound. He'd felt something amiss; his concubine's words made him realize the problem.</p><p>"Why is the first strike the tribulation thunder?"</p><p>Lord Qīanji's expression changed, his gaze fixed on the tribulation clouds, his demeanor growing serious.  "No! The aura of the tribulation cloud is abnormal!"</p><p>The concubine was startled. "Why?"</p><p>"The tribulation cloud is fully formed, but its power is far weaker than mine was!"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the tribulation clouds underwent another dramatic change, violently converging towards the center. The clouds retracted, condensing into a single mass, lightning flashing within.</p><p>Instantly, all the tribulation thunder power accumulated within the clouds was unleashed!</p><p>The vast tribulation clouds dispersed after only one thunder strike.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>A deafening roar.</p><p>The earth shook.</p><p>A silver lightning bolt descended from the heavens, striking a mountain peak.  The night sky lit up like day, the void filled with an aura of destruction.  Creatures in the mountains trembled in terror, birds and beasts fleeing in panic.</p><p>"Silver tribulation thunder!"</p><p>Seeing this, the Lord and concubine exclaimed simultaneously, exchanging incredulous glances.</p><p>"Silver tribulation thunder... silver tribulation thunder..."</p><p>The Lord furrowed his brow, struggling to recall something.  After a moment, his eyes widened in shock.</p><p>"Silver tribulation thunder!  A spirit insect! A spirit insect is undergoing its fourth transformation!"</p><p>"A fourth-stage spirit insect... so that's it..."</p><p>The concubine was lost in thought.</p><p>In the current cultivation world, a fourth-stage spirit insect is far rarer than a transformed妖 and a Yuan Ying master.  妖族 bloodlines are fragmented, their inheritance incomplete, making cultivation harder than for humans; yet, compared to spirit insects, they are exceptionally favored by heaven. Spirit insects face extreme difficulties in cultivation, but their tribulation thunders are said to be less fearsome, and silver in color.</p>
