<h1></h1><p>Venerable Chengyuan's cultivation was already at the peak of Mid-Nascent Soul, merely a step away from Late-Nascent Soul.</p><p>At this moment, he astonishingly possessed formidable strength comparable to a Grand Cultivator!</p><p>This secret technique was actually a double-edged sword; once the technique's duration ended, Venerable Chengyuan would have to meditate in seclusion for several decades to replenish his depleted essence.</p><p>But he still employed this technique without hesitation.</p><p>The opposing side had two cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>Reinforcements couldn't arrive in time.</p><p>The protective temple formation's primary function was to defend against external enemies. Since the opponent had already succeeded, they would undoubtedly focus solely on escaping, significantly reducing the formation's restrictive power.</p><p>The śarīra relic was formed from Patriarch Hongyi's failed breakthrough, making it easy to infer this treasure's purpose.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan had been trapped at the Late-Nascent Soul bottleneck for many years, unable to glimpse the path forward. The śarīra relic's significance to him was self-evident; it could not be lost.</p><p>Even at a tremendous cost, he would spare no effort!</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan was an enlightened eminent monk. Decades of silent meditation in the Chan hall were commonplace. His unwavering determination was among the best in the world, with few external things able to ripple his thoughts.</p><p>Yet now, Venerable Chengyuan's face was filled with killing intent, his gaze sharp as a blade.</p><p>The śarīra relic was a matter of contention on the path to the Great Dao.</p><p>If missed, he might be forever stalled at this stage.</p><p>When a cultivator encountered such an opportunity, they would undoubtedly fight for it with everything they had!</p><p>Qin Sang's attention shifted from the śarīra relic to Venerable Chengyuan. Sensing the change in Chengyuan's aura, his gaze darkened slightly, knowing he had encountered a formidable foe.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>With a rapid flap of phoenix wings, Qin Sang's movements flowed like clouds and water, transforming into a streak of lightning as he flew out of the Pagoda Forest, escaping towards the temple's exterior.</p><p>Although his escape speed was fast, it was not as fast as Venerable Chengyuan's translocation within the formation.</p><p>Having just crossed the vast bamboo forest behind Zhulan Temple's rear mountain, Qin Sang saw the void ahead ripple. Venerable Chengyuan's figure materialized out of thin air, appearing before him as if by teleportation.</p><p>Before Chengyuan's figure fully solidified, a flash of blade light suddenly erupted.</p><p>The blade light originated from Venerable Chengyuan's heart.</p><p>The blade was only four fingers long, shaped like a bird's feather, thin and light as gauze.</p><p>This was the Precept Blade!</p><p>It was also Venerable Chengyuan's natal magic treasure.</p><p>The Precept Blade.</p><p>The blade of precepts.</p><p>In Venerable Chengyuan's hands, however, it was an out-and-out instrument of slaughter.</p><p>Since entering meditative zen on the cliff face, Venerable Chengyuan's hands had long been free of bloodshed. The Precept Blade, sheathed, was like a caged tiger. Yet its killing nature remained.  All of Chengyuan's killing intent fused into the blade's intent, constantly nurtured over the years.</p><p>Once unsheathed, its light split the sun.</p><p>Killing Qi filled the air, a mournful wind swept through the path!</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was completely dominated by this Precept Blade, as if the sun itself had been cleaved in two.</p><p>It was already late autumn.</p><p>Influenced by the blade intent, the surroundings became even colder, as if entering the depths of winter.</p><p>"Not a pseudo-spiritual treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, his expression calm.</p><p>Sensing the aura of the Precept Blade, he judged it to be a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>He wasn't sure if it was a special advantage of Buddhist cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang had noticed that many Buddhist cultivators in the Western Desert possessed stronger divine senses than cultivators of the same rank.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Venerable Chengyuan's divine sense had reached the Nascent Form realm, allowing him to cultivate the *Ritual of Primal Offering*, but the Precept Blade's power remained within the realm of magic treasures.</p><p>This indicated that secret techniques like the *Ritual of Primal Offering*, used to nurture pseudo-spiritual treasures, were not commonplace even in the Central Continent, at least not widely known in the Western Desert.</p><p>After his last encounter with the Eight Scenery View cultivator, Qin Sang had assumed that, aside from the Sun God Tree, his other magic treasures wouldn't hold much of an advantage in the Central Continent. Therefore, he'd deliberately overestimated Venerable Chengyuan's strength and refrained from acting rashly.</p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Venerable Chengyuan, focused on his breakthrough, was unwilling to be distracted by external matters. Cultivating the *Ritual of Primal Offering* required considerable mental effort.</p><p>For a cultivator, realm was paramount. This time could be better spent searching for opportunities for advancement.</p><p>In any case, without a pseudo-spiritual treasure, even if Venerable Chengyuan was a true Grand Cultivator, Qin Sang wouldn't fear him, let alone one whose strength was forcibly elevated.</p><p>"Good blade technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted, the demonic banner before him flapping in the wind.</p><p>As the blade light shot towards him, Qin Sang was locked onto by the Precept Blade.</p><p>Although it was only a top-grade magic treasure, Venerable Chengyuan had nurtured its blade intent for countless years.  The Precept Blade's first unsheathing held unparalleled might, not to be underestimated.</p><p>If it were any other Mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, a moment of carelessness could result in their physical body being cleaved in two.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain in his forehead, a sensation of being split in half.</p><p>His expression remained unfazed.  Halting his escape light abruptly, he unleashed Demonic Fire!</p><p>The black Demonic Fire transformed into a dark cloud, incinerating the surrounding rocks and bamboo into ashes wherever it spread.  The Demonic Fire suddenly contracted inwards, forming a fiery dragon that soared towards the heavens, lunging directly at the Precept Blade!</p><p>Decades spent traversing the Storm Belt, almost entirely dedicated to cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*, had greatly enhanced Qin Sang's divine sense.  The fire lotus refined more Demonic Fire, naturally increasing the quantity and power of the Demonic Fire he could control through the fire lotus.</p><p>Sensing the momentum of the Demonic Fire dragon, Venerable Chengyuan's heart trembled.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The blade light slashed into the Demonic Fire dragon, cleaving it from head to abdomen.</p><p>The thin Precept Blade was incomparably sharp.</p><p>The upper half of the Demonic Fire dragon was severed, its tail still connected, transforming it into a two-headed black serpent.</p><p>However, after cleaving the Demonic Fire, the blade intent was mostly dissipated.  With a flap of his wings and simultaneously forming the Lotus Heart Seal, Qin Sang dodged to the side.</p><p>"Pseudo-spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan exclaimed, his fingers moving like a wheel as he rapidly formed a hand seal.</p><p>Instantly, the mountain summit was engulfed in swirling winds and clouds.</p><p>The protective temple formation descended, radiating myriad golden rays.</p><p>As the saying went, speed was the essence of war.</p><p>If the Zhulan Temple monks could form a formation in time and manipulate the protective temple formation together, reinforcing Venerable Chengyuan, the pressure Qin Sang faced would increase dramatically.</p><p>However, from the moment Qin Sang and Liuli made their move, mere moments had passed. The Zhulan Temple monks were still scattered throughout the temple, each going about their own business.  Even if well-trained, how could they match the speed of Nascent Soul cultivators?</p><p>The disciples responsible for guarding the formation could only maintain its basic defensive capabilities, forming a golden light barrier over Zhulan Temple. The speed at which they could alter the formation's configuration was far too slow to keep up with the battle.</p><p>Aware of the critical situation, the monks, faces filled with anger, rushed towards the rear mountain.</p><p>For the time being, Venerable Chengyuan had to split his attention, personally controlling the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced upwards.  His eyes met with dazzling golden light, a rain of golden light descending, prickling his back. He quickly urged the Ruyi Pearl within him, activating a protective罡罩.</p><p>Simultaneously, his hand seals changed, the Demonic Fire rising into the air, transforming into a dark cloud to shield him from above.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The golden light rained down like arrows, filling the sky.</p><p>Flames flickered within the black cloud, appearing somewhat dispersed.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan pressed his attack relentlessly, the Precept Blade trembling, preparing to strike again. Suddenly, he heard two strange "hum-ha" sounds, his nascent soul shaken.</p><p>"Trivial tricks!"</p><p>A flush of color surged into Venerable Chengyuan's sallow face. He roared in anger, the sound of bells resonating from within him.  A bell's shadow flickered around him, albeit much smaller than before, covering only his head, swaying continuously.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang's divine sense was powerful, a formidable foe rarely seen in his lifetime. Naturally, he had to guard against such nascent soul attacks.</p><p>This bronze bell was a supreme defensive treasure. Not only could it protect the body, but its chime also possessed special power to protect the nascent soul.</p><p>The bell's chime dispelled the hum-ha sounds, greatly weakening the Soul-Seizing Mantra's power. Moreover, Venerable Chengyuan's divine sense was inherently strong, suffering only minimal damage.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't expected to severely injure Venerable Chengyuan with the *Soul-Seizing Mantra*.</p><p>His purpose was to create an opportunity for Liuli!</p><p>While Venerable Chengyuan's nascent soul was under attack, Liuli had already arrived. Employing the same tactic, the Ice Soul Divine Light silently spread beneath Chengyuan's feet, erupting suddenly.</p><p>Unfortunately, the opponent was also a seasoned, top-tier expert.  The same trick was difficult to pull off twice.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan had been aware of Liuli's movements.  Breaking free from the *Soul-Seizing Mantra*, he immediately translocated, the Ice Soul Divine Light hitting empty space.</p><p>A glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>His years of studying Zhulan Temple's protective formation hadn't been in vain.</p><p>Utilizing his Heavenly Eye divine ability, he sensed the changes in the formation's Qi flow, judging the approximate area where Chengyuan had translocated. He immediately directed the Demonic Fire, changing its direction, and lunging towards a seemingly empty patch of void.</p><p>The opportunity was fleeting, and such judgments were prone to error. Moreover, with the Demonic Fire dispersed, its power was somewhat diminished.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan reappeared at the edge of the Demonic Fire's reach, the Precept Blade flashing around him in a rapid series of slashes. Blade Qi bloomed like a lotus, repelling the approaching Demonic Fire.</p><p>Simultaneously, Venerable Chengyuan chanted a Buddhist verse, forming the Single Hand Earth Touching Seal. A golden ring abruptly rose from the ground.</p><p>The golden ring appeared directly beneath Qin Sang.</p><p>This was Venerable Chengyuan's only remaining strategy to secure the śarīra relic after witnessing Qin Sang's strength. He had secretly concentrated most of the protective formation's power here, setting a trap.</p><p>Once ensnared by the golden ring, Qin Sang would be trapped within a cage.  Escaping would require considerable effort. By then, reinforcements would have arrived, and the combined might of the various temples' experts would trap the two thieves within Zhulan Temple, like fish in a barrel.</p><p>The golden ring soared upwards, swift as lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared helpless, his brow furrowed deeply.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan tilted the Precept Blade slightly, aiming it at Liuli, preventing the Daoist nun from rescuing Qin Sang while he focused on activating the formation to imprison Qin Sang.</p><p>Just then, a chilling light erupted from where Liuli stood.</p><p>In his peripheral vision, Venerable Chengyuan glimpsed a small, strangely shaped seal.  His heart skipped a beat.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The cold sun hung high, the Frost Serpent revived.</p><p>The roar echoed throughout the oasis. The devoutly prostrating mortals, hearing the roar, looked up at the sky in terror. They saw a terrifying monster appear in the heavens, its teeth and claws bared, tearing through the golden glow, a ferocious and menacing sight.</p><p>The Buddha within the golden glow vanished, seemingly swallowed whole by the monster.</p><p>Tears streamed down everyone's faces as they wailed in grief.</p><p>The Four-Paramita Frost Serpent Seal, given to Liuli, had recognized her as its master after years of refinement.</p><p>Liuli's cultivation was inferior to Tong Lingyu's, but in her hands, the spiritual treasure seemed even more powerful. Furthermore, Liuli didn't appear strained.</p><p>This was the greatest difference between a spiritual treasure recognizing its master and the *Comprehension of Treasures Technique*.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Frost Serpent swooped downwards.</p><p>"A true spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's composure finally shattered. His mind reeling, he cried out in astonishment.</p><p>True spiritual treasures were exceedingly rare, even in the Central Continent.</p><p>This was because refining spiritual treasures was incredibly difficult.  Even if someone painstakingly refined their natal magic treasure to the level of a spiritual treasure, upon their death, the spiritual treasure's sentience would dissipate, reverting back to a magic treasure, unable to be passed down.</p><p>From where did these two harbingers of doom originate?</p><p>One wielded mystical divine abilities and commanded a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The other possessed escape techniques and divine sense comparable to a Grand Cultivator, wielding a pseudo-spiritual treasure.</p><p>Such individuals were rare even within the top sects of the Central Continent.  When had such top-tier experts emerged in the cultivation world?</p><p>The Frost Serpent, menacing and ferocious, its chilling flames washing over him.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan could no longer concern himself with Qin Sang, hastily translocating to evade its sharp edge.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Frost Serpent abruptly changed direction, not to rescue Qin Sang, but to join forces with the Demonic Fire.  Under countless shocked gazes, they charged towards the light barrier enveloping the sky above.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Golden light erupted skyward.</p><p>The surrounding mountains seemed to tremble.</p><p>The oasis' great lake was stirred into unprecedented, towering waves.</p><p>Chilling flames and Demonic Fire filled the sky, a boundless conflagration, indistinguishable from one another.</p><p>The monks controlling the formation were still following Venerable Chengyuan's will, focused on manipulating the golden ring to imprison Qin Sang, completely unprepared.</p><p>They could only watch helplessly as the protective temple formation was ripped open, a crack appearing within.</p><p>Simultaneously, the golden ring, affected by the formation's tremors, dissipated, revealing a weakness.</p><p>Qin Sang seized the opportunity to escape.</p><p>Suddenly, a shout came from outside the temple.</p><p>"Senior Brother Chengyuan, Kongyu has come to assist you!"</p><p>The voice rolled in, drawing closer.</p><p>Venerable Kongyu.</p><p>An eminent monk of Luoluo Temple, one of the Seven Stars of the Vast Sea, a Mid-Nascent Soul expert.</p><p>The name Luoluo Temple was somewhat peculiar, derived from the Luoluo tree, a unique spiritual tree of the Vast Sea.</p><p>Zhulan Temple was located in the eastern part of this oasis, with Luoluo Temple to its east, neighboring Zhulan Temple and the closest of the six great temples.</p><p>As expected, Venerable Kongyu was the first to arrive.</p><p>His voice, amplified by true essence, boomed like thunder.</p><p>In the next moment, an old monk clad in kasaya appeared above Zhulan Temple.</p><p>Venerable Kongyu held a purple-gold alms bowl in his left hand, his gaze sharp as lightning.  He immediately noticed the crack in the light barrier, and with a flick of his wrist, was about to use the alms bowl to seal the breach.</p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind shot from the side – the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>From the very beginning, Qin Sang's avatar had remained outside the temple, firstly to intercept reinforcements, preventing them from arriving too quickly, and secondly, to be ready to coordinate from within and without, assisting in breaking the formation.</p><p>The treasure-snatching process had gone more smoothly than anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't even needed to use the Sun God Tree.</p><p>There was another one outside!</p><p>The Zhulan Temple monks, seeing Venerable Kongyu arrive as reinforcement, had their newly kindled hope extinguished.</p><p>Venerable Chengyuan's anger turned into a bitter laugh.</p><p>Three Mid-Nascent Soul experts creating such a commotion around little Zhulan Temple – he didn't know whether to be enraged or consider it an honor.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Sword Qi approached.</p><p>Venerable Kongyu hadn't expected another powerful foe lurking outside the temple.  Startled, he quickly turned the alms bowl, its opening facing the sword Qi, erupting with purple-gold mystical light.</p><p>With a *dong*, the sword light was swallowed by the purple-gold mystical light. The Golden Sinking Sword's momentum was checked, and Venerable Kongyu's figure trembled, shifting several hundred zhang.</p><p>Although unharmed, he was now unable to block the enemies within Zhulan Temple.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Two figures flashed out from the crack.</p><p>…</p><p>Beyond the oasis.</p><p>In the vast sand sea.</p><p>Several Bodhi trees stood solitary amidst the yellow sand, offering a sliver of shade to passing monks.</p><p>At this moment, a figure sat meditating beneath the Bodhi trees.</p><p>This person wore a bamboo hat, obscuring their face, but was dressed in celestial robes and adorned with璎珞, resembling a living Bodhisattva. This was the renowned Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>Monks surrounded them.</p><p>Seeing the Moonlight Bodhisattva's audacious attire, the younger monks' eyes burned with fury.</p><p>Venerables Chengzhen and Guanhui, however, remained indifferent, spitting words of wisdom, engrossed in their debate on scriptures.</p><p>At the height of their heated discussion, Venerable Chengzhen suddenly fell silent, looking down in surprise.  The jade pendant at his waist clattered, splitting in two.  The monks, hearing the sound, changed color, falling silent.</p><p>Something had happened at the temple!</p><p>"What's this? Are the venerable monks about to concede? Then please leave behind the scriptures from your temple's Scripture Pavilion."</p><p>Unaware of the situation, the Moonlight Bodhisattva chuckled softly, their voice ethereal.</p>
