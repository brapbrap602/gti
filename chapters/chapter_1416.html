<h1>Chapter 1408 Nine-Precept Ring</h1><p>"They've already gone in,"</p><p>True Master Holding Precepts said in a low voice.</p><p>He lightly rotated the 'Nine-Precept' ring on his other hand, concealing the unease and excitement in his heart.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo and True Master Holding Precepts appeared before the Buddha Lotus.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame aura and the Buddha Lotus did not yield to each other, creating extreme chaos. Qin Sang and the others could not possibly leave any contingency plans here, so they were not worried.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Among the Nascent Souls who had appeared in the Emptiness Sea, other than Qin Sang's group of four, only the two of them remained.</p><p>Of course, there might be other Nascent Souls secretly rushing over, not revealing themselves, having deceived both the Skyeye Butterfly and Old Demon Hunmo's spiritual sense.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo remained silent.</p><p>He stared at the center of the pillar of light.</p><p>In his turbid eyes, a strange blackness spread from his pupils, instantly transforming into black demonic eyes.</p><p>The locations of his pupils were now two tiny vortices, seemingly capable of sucking in light, inside reflecting the shadows beyond the gate, incomparably profound.</p><p>After a moment.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo's eyes returned to normal. He coughed lightly and asked, "Are you certain the 'Nine-Precept' can guide us through the Pure Sea Sect's Protecting Sect Formation?"</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>True Master Holding Precepts hesitated, not daring to guarantee, "If there are no unforeseen events… this ring was obtained by my master from the corpse of a Pure Sea Sect Buddhist cultivator, and it is likely a token of a Pure Sea Sect elder."</p><p>"Unforeseen events?" Old Demon Hunmo sneered, "If there were no unforeseen events, the Nine-Precept ring would have found the Pure Sea Sect long ago. Why wait until now?"</p><p>True Master Holding Precepts dared not argue.</p><p>What Old Demon Hunmo said was true.</p><p>Back then, his master, Nine-Precept, obtained very limited information.</p><p>At least, they were completely unaware of the Buddha Lotus formation outside the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>"Let's go in first,"</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo tapped his black bamboo staff.</p><p>An invisible and colorless power erupted, enveloping the two of them.</p><p>True Master Holding Precepts initially wanted to unleash his protective magic treasure, but seeing this, he switched to a silver halberd, closely following behind Old Demon Hunmo.</p><p>They passed through a gap in a Buddha Lotus, entering the pillar of light.</p><p>Anomalies impacted their protective power.</p><p>The black bamboo staff in Old Demon Hunmo's hand trembled slightly, occasionally flashing a streak of emerald light, but the protective power around them remained impregnable.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo walked step by step toward the entrance.</p><p>His pace was steady.</p><p>A stark contrast to Qin Sang and the others before him.</p><p>Seeing this scene, True Master Holding Precepts' awe for Old Demon Hunmo increased by another degree. He gripped the silver halberd tightly, constantly prepared for sudden changes.</p><p>Soon, they arrived before the gate.</p><p>After observing for a moment, they stepped inside as well.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The moment they entered, a scorching gale slammed into them.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo raised an eyebrow and pointed forward with his bamboo staff, instantly condensing a thin layer of light in front of him, blocking the gale.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the light barrier only lasted for less than three breaths before something seemed to corrode it, creating a tiny pinhole.</p><p>In an instant, countless golden lights pierced through the light barrier, shooting toward them like golden needles.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo gave a light 'oh' in surprise. Without panicking, he flicked his sleeve, and a token flew out from inside. It looked the same as the Hunmo token that True Master Holding Precepts had destroyed earlier.</p><p>However, this Hunmo token was clearly much thicker and heavier than the previous one.</p><p>The Hunmo token expanded in the wind, instantly becoming the size of a door panel, completely protecting them behind it.</p><p>'Ding ding...'</p><p>A dense and crisp sound rang out.</p><p>The Hunmo token and the two men retreated again and again, and the evil wind was finally blocked.</p><p>The two men were unharmed.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo turned the Hunmo token around to look at it, and it was covered with patches of golden liquid, but before Old Demon Hunmo could take it away, it dissipated on the spot, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>"What is this? It can treat true essence as if it were nothing? If there were more, wouldn't that be terrible?"</p><p>Even with Old Demon Hunmo's knowledge, he couldn't figure out what the liquid was.</p><p>Most of the Northern Sea's Buddhist cultivators are in the relatively stable Crescent Moon Realm, and they are not significant. Old Demon Hunmo's understanding of Buddhism is only superficial.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, unable to figure out the origin of these things. He turned his head and ordered True Master Holding Precepts, "Take out the Nine-Precept ring."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>True Master Holding Precepts put away the silver halberd and took off the ring on his hand.</p><p>With Old Demon Hunmo's protection, there was no need to worry about his safety. True Master Holding Precepts sat in the lotus position, closed his eyes, and held the ring in both hands.</p><p>In an instant, True Master Holding Precepts' aura changed drastically, and he even gained a bit of solemnity, which made Old Demon Hunmo couldn't help but take another look.</p><p>"Buddhist cultivation method?"</p><p>The thought flashed through Old Demon Hunmo's mind. He moved the Hunmo token next to True Master Holding Precepts, looked around, and sized up the environment here.</p><p>It was obvious that they had now broken into the Pure Sea Sect's Protecting Sect Formation, or some kind of guarding restriction.</p><p>The moment they came in, the gate disappeared.</p><p>Being in the formation, they couldn't tell where they were.</p><p>The sky and the ground were chaotic scenes.</p><p>They were suspended in the void, with nothing above and nothing below.</p><p>The evil wind was just the beginning.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo could feel that other attacks were about to come.</p><p>Even in the gaps between attacks, the extremely rich Scarlet Flame aura around them was not to be trifled with.</p><p>The protective power surrounding them was being continuously consumed by the Scarlet Flame aura.</p><p>The conventional method was to force their way through, analyze the changes in the formation again and again, find the rules, and then break the formation. The formation was ownerless, and its operation would be slow, so the possibility of success was high, but it was too slow.</p><p>True Master Holding Precepts held the ring flowing out of the Pure Sea Sect, which might be able to guide them and easily get out of the formation.</p><p>However.</p><p>The more Old Demon Hunmo looked around, the more solemn his expression became.</p><p>These Scarlet Flame auras should not have belonged here originally, but now they were everywhere, and had even become the dominant force!</p><p>Back then, no one knew what happened to the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>The Scarlet Flame aura and the Protecting Sect Formation could coexist and maintain themselves for countless years. Under the subtle influence, no one could say what kind of changes had taken place in the middle, or whether it was still the original formation?</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo's mind raced, and he looked at True Master Holding Precepts.</p><p>He saw that True Master Holding Precepts' whole body seemed to be covered with a layer of gold leaf. He looked like an Arhat, and his true essence was continuously poured into the 'Nine-Precept' ring.</p><p>'Buzz buzz...'</p><p>The Nine-Precept ring vibrated gently, and the characters on it emitted Buddha light, which was sometimes bright and sometimes dim, as if calling for something.</p><p>At this moment, True Master Holding Precepts suddenly woke up, his body trembled, and the ring almost fell from his hand. He grabbed it quickly.</p><p>Before Old Demon Hunmo could ask, True Master Holding Precepts continued to try.</p><p>After several times in a row, the cold sweat on his face was about to come down.</p><p>"This treasure can guide me to sense the changes in the formation, but it is very difficult. I suspect that it may only be effective outside the periphery of the Protecting Sect Formation. The formation here... seems to have been changed."</p><p>True Master Holding Precepts said bitterly.</p><p>This situation was beyond his expectations.</p><p>He was right about what Old Demon Hunmo said!</p><p>The Nine-Precept ring probably wouldn't give them much of an advantage.</p><p>Old Demon Hunmo was not surprised. His eyes narrowed slightly, and a cold light flashed across them, "They must still be on the periphery. Can you find their location? It seems... we must act as soon as possible!"</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Thank you, fellow cultivator Tong Lingyu, for the Alliance Master reward!</p>
