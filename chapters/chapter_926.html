<h1>Chapter 918: Night Shadow Insect</h1><p>Chapter 918: Night Shadow Insect</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Two streaks of light flew from Poison Island, and after a short burst of speed, landed on a deserted island in the distance.  It was Bai Zhongqiu and his wife.</p><p>They both looked back at Poison Island, their eyes filled with reluctance and worry.</p><p>“Senior Brother, Ying’er…”</p><p>Bai Hong couldn't help shedding tears at the thought of her daughter possibly being used in a sacrificial ritual.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Junior Sister.  The cultivation technique the senior gave Ying’er is a genuine Water-elemental method from the orthodox Xuanmen sect, perfectly suited for her cultivation.  It's not some demonic furnace-cultivation technique.  While the senior’s methods are harsh, he doesn’t seem like a villain who harms innocents.  If he were, after occupying Poison Island for so long, he would have a notorious reputation, but nearby cultivators don't even know he exists. He’s probably an ascetic cultivator; Ying’er might even benefit from this…”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu could only use these words to comfort his wife and himself, finally sighing, “It's a pity that I wanted to ask the senior to accept Ying’er as a disciple, but he flatly refused.”</p><p>“Senior Brother, your judgment is always excellent. Since you say he's an ascetic cultivator, why would he easily take on a disciple? That cultivation technique was probably just payment for us. As for the promised煞妖丹 (Sha Yao Dan), I wouldn't dare to hope for it.”</p><p>Bai Hong wiped away her tears and softly spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang, having cultivated for many years and encountered numerous powerful enemies, had acquired many cultivation techniques, mostly of the Five Elements. Any one of them would be far superior to those the Bai couple had collected for their daughter.</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu nodded, revealing some objects in his palm, “Even without the Sha Yao Dan, the senior hasn't treated us badly. He not only refined our shuttle, but also gave us these噬元锥 (Shi Yuan Cones). As long as we don't provoke enemies at the mid-Core Formation stage or above, we'll have some ability to protect ourselves.”</p><p>In Bai Zhongqiu's palm were over a dozen Shi Yuan Cones, the same ones he originally made for his clone.</p><p>Besides that, there was a shuttle, their original artifact.</p><p>It was only a mid-range artifact among high-grade ones.</p><p>Qin Sang took the shuttle and spent two days refining it using the techniques he’d learned from the Xuan Tie Zhu and adding some spiritual materials.</p><p>After the refinement, the shuttle, when used by the couple together, could reach the speed comparable to that of an early Core Formation cultivator. If Bai Zhongqiu and his wife weren't only Foundation Establishment cultivators, enhancing the shuttle to a treasure wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>Bai Hong also nodded gently, “I didn't expect the senior to be proficient in artifact refinement as well. With this treasure, we'll be much safer. After all, the Wind-Splitting Archipelago isn't a peaceful place. Moreover, the senior didn't ask us to risk our lives, only to collect useful spiritual materials and information, significantly reducing the danger…”</p><p>“That's right,” Bai Zhongqiu nodded, giving half of the Shi Yuan Cones to Bai Hong, “Spiritual materials are easy to get, we can buy them from various shops and trading houses. The senior actually asked us to find out where the jade pendant for entering the Seven Killing Hall is being auctioned. Legend says the Seven Killing Hall is extremely dangerous, countless powerful cultivators have perished within. Does the senior intend to go there?”</p><p>Clearly, Bai Zhongqiu had also heard of the Seven Killing Hall's fearsome reputation.</p><p>To enter the Seven Killing Hall, one needed a jade pendant that could withstand the immortal formation.</p><p>After the last incident, Qin Sang didn't want to get mixed up with the East Pole Alliance again.</p><p>He’d heard that there were many powerful and mysterious cultivators in the Wind-Splitting Archipelago.  Before the last opening of the Seven Killing Hall, jade pendants had been auctioned.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn’t sure when such an auction would happen, so he asked the couple to keep an eye out and report back immediately.</p><p>“Also, the senior asked us to find out about the necromancer cultivators in the Wind-Splitting Archipelago who are most skilled in corpse refinement techniques. This…”</p><p>Bai Hong frowned.</p><p>Their worries stemmed mainly from this.</p><p>“Forget it, there's no point in overthinking. Let's not try to guess the senior's intentions. He asked us to report back every so often, and we can check on Ying’er then. As long as Ying’er is safe, whatever his purpose, it doesn't concern us. We just need to do our best.”</p><p>Bai Zhongqiu took his wife's hand, and they soared into the sky, quickly disappearing into the vast ocean.</p><p>On Poison Island.</p><p>Bai Ying’er watched her parents leave, then returned to her cave, feeling uneasy.  Seeing that no one paid her any attention, she gradually felt less afraid.  Remembering the days when she followed her parents, constantly worried and on the run, she even felt that being able to cultivate peacefully and undisturbed was quite good.</p><p>Poison Island was far from picturesque; it was a land of poisonous miasma, ugly monsters, and foul odors. She could only move around within her cave and a large valley in front of it.</p><p>Bai Ying’er didn't dare disturb Qin Sang, but she often saw the two-headed… something.</p><p>At first, she was afraid of the two-headed beast.  Later, she discovered it wasn't aggressive, and far more intelligent than any other demonic beast she'd encountered. She even managed to befriend it.</p><p>The two-headed beast, having regained its freedom, became restless.  Unable to shake its anxiety, it would howl at the sun and moon daily.  Only now did it understand the rarity of this chance encounter.</p><p>Initially, the beast was annoyed and ignored the girl.  But perhaps out of boredom, it gradually warmed up to her. After all, she would groom its fur, unlike its former master who only used it as a shield.</p><p>This is a story for another time.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in her cave, examining the spoils from the extermination of the Si Mo Cave. She took out a pouch – the demonic cultivator's spirit beast bag.</p><p>The cultivator was skilled in insect control, and the bag contained seven or eight different kinds of insects.</p><p>“The night shadow insect was used by the old demon to send messages. The other insects are similar, only useful for support. They aren't rare, nor are there any unique insects; they lack fighting power, but have special abilities. That’s why I didn't see him using them in battle. It seems the old demon knew that breeding unique insects requires vast resources and effort.  If it weren't for the  Red Fire Gilded, I wouldn't dare take the Sky Eye Butterfly as my soul insect...”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew her spiritual sense from the pouch.</p><p>These insects were carefully selected and cultivated by the Si Mo Cave master for countless years.  They might prove effective in specific situations.</p><p>Of course, they weren't as powerful as the fat silkworm, which could neutralize any potent poison.</p><p>“Keeping these insects won’t hurt. The old demon’s insect control strategy was quite good, and raising them won't cost much spirit stones. They might actually come in handy.  The old demon's insect control differs from the Imperial Spirit Sect's; he could leave a mark on the insects to force them to obey, but it damages their potential and requires superior cultivation to control…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, noting the spirit beast bag was superior to her insect cage, and moved the fat silkworm into it.</p><p>For the next few days, she monitored the island's perimeter.  Seeing that the Si Mo Cave incident hadn't caused wider unrest, she sealed her cave and returned to her cultivation.</p><p>Over the following months and years, Bai Zhongqiu and his wife would return to the island, bringing news or the spirit materials Qin Sang needed.  Seeing their daughter safe, her cultivation steadily improving, and befriending the island master's beast, they were finally at ease.</p><p>And so, over a decade passed quickly.</p>
