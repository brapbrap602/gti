<h1>Chapter 2007: The Five Elements Alliance</h1><p>“Outer Realm Demons…”</p><p>According to Qin Sang's observations and knowledge, cultivators in the Great Thousand World don't consider the Lesser Thousand Worlds as "Outer Realms."</p><p>In the common understanding of the Great Thousand World, the Lesser Thousand Worlds are derived from the Great Thousand World and are a part of it.  Like saplings growing in the shade of a large tree, they sprout from the roots of the great tree, essentially being the same plant.</p><p>There's even a theory that the Great Thousand World will one day perish, and the Lesser Thousand Worlds are the continuation of its life force. One or more Lesser Thousand Worlds will rise when the Great Thousand World declines, allowing the ruins to be reborn, bringing a way out for all living beings and marking the beginning of a new cycle.</p><p>The only possibility for demons to be considered Outer Realm beings is if they come from another Great Thousand World!</p><p>“Did my senior sister and Bai ascend to another Great Thousand World?”</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>If it were a normal Great Thousand World that had interactions with this one, there would be a possibility of meeting again in the future.  But the Outer Realm Demons are considered invaders by this world, mortal enemies. The boundary between worlds was once sealed by the Jade Emperor, making it an insurmountable barrier.</p><p>To meet again would be as difficult as ascending to heaven!</p><p>Regarding news of Liuyin and Gui Mu, there are some leads beyond Fengju Yumen.</p><p>Without the Heavenly Dao Demon Sound's interference,  Liuli has a chance of achieving apotheosis and ascension, and potentially meeting in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Unexpectedly, my senior sister and Bai, who ascended first, are the ones who are most difficult to reunite with.</p><p>“Why aren't the Dao Court and Purple Micro Palace mentioned here? Did they rise to prominence during later upheavals?”</p><p>Since Elder Tianyue could entrust the sword servant with so many secrets and ask him to wait here for himself, Qin Sang no longer needed to hide his questions.  He asked directly whatever came to mind.</p><p>After asking this, Qin Sang noticed the sword servant's surprise, the latter looking at him with a strange expression.</p><p>The sword servant cleared his throat and said, "I... I have some questions I wanted to ask the Immortal."</p><p>Qin Sang immediately understood.  The sword servant probably thought he had a deep connection with the Purple Micro Palace, perhaps even being a descendant of some powerful figure, hence Elder Tianyue’s attention to him.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the sword servant, Qin Sang did indeed receive a legacy, yet he was a clueless inheritor.</p><p>“You followed Senior Tianyue for many years, yet he never told you these secrets. I know no more than you.  Furthermore, even with my current cultivation, what am I in the Great Thousand World? What difference does knowing this make?” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>These words were Qin Sang’s genuine thoughts.</p><p>While a Nascent Soul cultivator could be a local overlord, in the whole Great Thousand World, they were just a slightly larger pawn.  Thinking of the great karmic entanglements on him, Qin Sang felt helpless.</p><p>The sword servant echoed the sentiment, then recounted the information he'd found.</p><p>“Whether it's intentional erasure or other reasons, there are few records of the Dao Court and Sword Pavilion in public texts. I only found some scattered accounts in those ancient books.</p><p>“After the Jade Emperor’s creation of the world, the human race prospered, and various Dao's flourished, with Daoism standing out the most. The Dan Ding sect, needless to say, had a profound influence. The Fu Zhu school is recognized as the beginning of human divine arts. Some trace the Great and Lesser Vehicle dispute back to that era, believing that the Great Vehicle Dao originated from it.</p><p>“However, records mention the Fu Zhu school but not the Dao Court.</p><p>“Later, sword cultivators flourished in the Great Zhou Dynasty. Every reform, every emergence of a powerful figure, was accompanied by great chaos and catastrophe! Times of great strife inevitably involved various races of the Great Thousand World and the Outer Realm Demons.</p><p>“At that time, sword rainbows blotted out the sun, countless sword cultivators rode the south wind, ascended the clouds, crossed mountains and seas, and flew on swords to the ninth heaven. Before the world barrier, they established the Sword Pavilion, the Border Pass, to slay the outer demons.  There are even rumors that sword light surged like a tide, invading the demon world, relentlessly killing in all directions, and terrifying countless demons!</p><p>“But there are also rumors that the sword cultivators acted arbitrarily, lacking forbearance, and proactively blasted open the world barrier seal. That's why they could invade the demon realm, but ultimately, their sword edge was blocked, bringing a great calamity to the Great Thousand World. Some even say that sword cultivators colluded with the outer demons, causing chaos in the Great Thousand World…</p><p>“These true and false accounts are mixed together, confusing people and completely concealing the truth.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Qin Sang immediately realized something was wrong, his expression becoming serious.</p><p>According to the Dao he understood from the *Purple Micro Sword Canon*, the Purple Micro Sword Venerable cultivated the Great Vehicle killing Dao.  Therefore, guarding the world barrier and slaying outer demons to protect the Great Thousand World was indeed his action.</p><p>However, why did a guardian of the Great Thousand World end up with the Sword Pavilion collapsing, its inheritance severed, and everyone calling for its destruction?</p><p>The First Sword Servant even spoke of being enemies with the entire world.</p><p>Even if they were enemies with the entire world, it should have been because of the Outer Realm Demons, not everyone else!</p><p>Qin Sang considered various possibilities, countless conspiracies flashing through his mind.</p><p>Could it be that while the Purple Micro Sword Venerable led the Purple Micro Palace in battle at the world barrier, he was betrayed from behind by someone with ulterior motives?</p><p>After a devastating battle with the demons at Purple Palace, leaving them significantly weakened, enemies took advantage of the situation, stealing their achievements and besmirching their reputation.  Alternatively, perhaps the sword cultivator's exceptional prowess had made them a target, leading to a concerted effort to suppress them.  The human race wasn't united, and there were also the witches and demons to consider.</p><p>Suddenly, an idea struck Qin Sang, causing a slight tightening in his chest.</p><p>What if everything was a lie?  Only the Dao is truly real and immutable, but what if the Dao he had comprehended from the *Purple Palace Sword Scripture* was false? After all, he only possessed the first twelve levels of the cultivation techniques; the later stages, the Unity and Mahayana realms, were missing.</p><p>What if the Mahayana Killing Dao was merely a path of the twelfth level?  What if after breaking through to the Unity and Mahayana realms, the Purple Palace Sword Saint abandoned the Mahayana Killing Dao and changed his ways? It wasn't impossible.  Looking at the first twelve levels of the *Purple Palace Sword Scripture*, the Sword Saint's Dao was never constant, always evolving.  If he abandoned the protective heart of the Mahayana Killing Dao and charged into the Demon Realm, maybe it was simply for the thrill of the kill.</p><p>Countless thoughts tangled in Qin Sang's mind, growing more chaotic.  Conclusions drawn from limited information would inevitably differ greatly from the truth. Qin Sang had only speculated on several possibilities; none were credible without concrete evidence.</p><p>This made Qin Sang even more eager to obtain the fragments of the killing sword and the subsequent cultivation techniques, to see what the Purple Palace Sword Saint's true Dao was.  Perhaps it was the very path he sought, eliminating the need to change his fundamental cultivation method.</p><p>As for changing allegiances, Qin Sang hadn't considered it.  His karmic ties to Purple Palace weren't easily severed.  At least, for now, he was the biggest beneficiary of this karmic connection.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang lost in thought, the Sword Servant sat quietly without disturbing him.</p><p>"Did Senior Tianyue say anything about where I should wait for him after retrieving the spirit sword?" Qin Sang wanted to know what the First Sword Attendant and Senior Tianyue had planned for him.  If he could be under their protection, finding a secluded paradise to cultivate peacefully for thousands or tens of thousands of years, he would be happy.</p><p>"The Master instructed the Real Person to act as they see fit," the Sword Servant shook their head, indicating there were no specific instructions.</p><p>*Is Senior Tianyue unable to meet me? He must know the dangers ahead*, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  "Can we contact Senior Tianyue to meet first? Perhaps there's a better solution…"</p><p>"The Master said, 'A sharp sword is forged through sharpening,'  That is his Dao!" the Sword Servant said solemnly.</p><p>There was no room for negotiation.</p><p>Qin Sang, while admiring this resolve, leaned back slightly, forced to consider his escape route.</p><p>The sword retrieval process was fine if it went smoothly, but if his identity was exposed, he would have no refuge in the Eight Great Heavenly States, or indeed anywhere within human territory.</p><p>He had learned from the Sword Servant that the ancient battlefield where the Fengju Jade Gate was located was vast. While it lay between the human and witch territories, entering from the human side was significantly less dangerous than the witch side.  It was far more difficult for witches to enter their sacred mountain. Purple Palace was closer to the human side, essentially within human territory, so they only needed to consider human adversaries at the Fengju Jade Gate.</p><p>Fleeing to the witch territory, to see Liuyin and the Ghost Mother, was an option, but bypassing the Fengju Jade Gate was problematic and might not be safe.  A major legacy like Purple Palace would surely interest the witches.</p><p>Heading north would lead to the Endless Wilderness. After the destruction of the Yao Court, the demons were driven into the Wilderness.  After countless years, it was unknown what it had become.</p><p>Qin Sang knew nothing of the Wilderness's situation, only that the human race could only defend the Eight Great Heavenly States, while Buddhism had expanded beyond them.</p><p>Furthermore, the human population of the Eight Great Heavenly States did not represent all of humankind.  Countless places like Yue Du Bay existed, beyond the jurisdiction of the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>Between the two races lay a boundless chaotic region, where various races mingled, creating a perilous environment even more dangerous than the South Sea.  To reach the Wilderness, one had to first traverse these lands.</p><p>After much deliberation, his options were limited; he could only proceed cautiously during the sword retrieval.</p><p>Qin Sang could only take things one step at a time.  "When do we leave?"</p><p>The Sword Servant would accompany him to Du State, then part ways.  The Sword Servant would then contact Senior Tianyue as agreed, while Qin Sang would hide his identity and proceed to the Fengju Jade Gate alone, awaiting the opportunity.</p><p>Since a special method was used for communication, the Sword Servant couldn't see Senior Tianyue either, making Qin Sang's wish to meet him a vain hope.</p><p>"Before departure, I must first ask for leave from the Zhou Wang Palace, make arrangements.  At least a month," the Sword Servant said.</p><p>The Zhou Wang's elite guards protected the Zhou Wang Palace.</p><p>As the saying goes, "The cicada knows the wind before it moves". Any shift in the situation would be quickly detected. Unless absolutely necessary, this identity should not be abandoned.</p><p>"Good! I'll take a good look at this so-called sacred land of the Great Qian human race," Qin Sang nodded. "Do you know if there are any powerful forces in Da Zhou renowned for their skill in crafting magical artifacts? I consider myself somewhat proficient in the art of crafting, and obtaining recognition from a certain force and securing a guest elder position would serve as a good disguise on my westward journey. Those established sects are likely to be very strict and difficult to approach; it would be best if it were a merchant guild or an alliance."</p><p>Qin Sang's actions were also for his own sake.</p><p>He had initially believed himself to be quite wealthy among cultivators of his level, but he soon learned how difficult the journey would be.</p><p>After a few trips across the Eight Great Heavens, his collection would be depleted, and he would have to rely on his skills to "earn a living" in the future.</p><p>He remembered that in the Talisman Realm, whenever he was short on funds, he would go hunting fierce beasts, which also allowed him to comprehend the Dao of Slaughter – how pleasant that was.</p><p>"There are a few forces known for their artifact crafting. The most famous is the Celestial Tower. Legend says that the high-ranking members of the Celestial Tower are enlightened spirit treasures – innate and acquired spirit treasures that have, for various reasons, escaped their owners' control – who consider themselves a spirit race.  However, their numbers are few, and when people speak of other races, they rarely mention the spirit race. In all my years in Baiyu Jing, I've never heard of a single member of the Celestial Tower appearing; they are incredibly mysterious," the sword servant mused.</p><p>"Oh? Spirit treasures forming their own race?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. These spirit beings were similar to Xiao Wu, but Qin Sang wouldn't dare let Xiao Wu come into contact with them.</p><p>The fact that spirit treasures formed their own race showed their independent nature and unwillingness to become anyone's subordinate. It would be bad if they were to take Xiao Wu away.</p><p>"Different races, different hearts. The Celestial Tower would probably be difficult to join," Qin Sang shook his head.</p><p>Once he joined a major force, unless absolutely necessary, he intended to stay for a long time. Later, he could leverage his position to gain resources for himself, without aiming for a high position.</p><p>During King Zhou's reign, whether it was deserved or not, it was clear that powerful humans favored the existence of rules.</p><p>Since he was operating within the rules, he had to abide by them.</p><p>"Aside from the Celestial Tower and those sects, the most famous is the Five Elements Alliance," the sword servant said. "It is said to be an alliance formed by like-minded artifact crafters. Since all things in the world belong to one of the five elements, and the art of artifact crafting involves seeking materials from all things, it was thus named the Five Elements Alliance. The Five Elements Alliance gradually grew and is now spread across the Eight Great Heavens, having absorbed countless artifact crafters. They don't care about background; even independent cultivators can join.  There are also some more… unusual ones…"</p><p>Five Elements Alliance, Five Elements Crown – quite fitting.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. No need to choose, it's the Five Elements Alliance!</p><p>However, he was also curious about these unusual ones, and asked the sword servant to continue.</p><p>After hearing what they were, he became intrigued.</p><p>Rumor has it that some forces can help people fuse their souls with spirit treasures, discarding their physical bodies to take shelter within the treasure and endure the tribulation to become true spirit treasures, existing as a spirit treasure and cultivating the Dao of Spirit Treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was possible; Xiao Wu's birth process had some similarities.</p><p>However, their claim of being able to help the dying regain their lives was questionable. Since the price was extremely high, nobody would easily attempt it.</p><p>Their conversation significantly broadened Qin Sang's knowledge.</p><p>After talking for a while, they finalized their plans. The sword servant left Qin Sang a jade talisman for the courtyard formation before returning to King Zhou's palace.</p><p>After seeing the sword servant off, Qin Sang sat quietly in the courtyard, analyzing the information he had gathered.</p><p>His peaceful cultivation days were finally over.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, got up, and walked out of the courtyard.  He strolled through the streets of Baiyu Jing, calmly making his way toward the Five Elements Alliance.</p><p>Unlike the mysterious Celestial Tower, the Five Elements Alliance's headquarters were located in Baiyu Jing, on the thirtieth heaven.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not intend to go directly to the headquarters.</p><p>The Five Elements Alliance did business openly, like guilds in the mortal world, showing they were approachable. They established branches every five heavens for the convenience of cultivators.</p><p>Da Zhou had no explicit regulations regarding the thirty-three heavens, but over the years, some generally accepted rules had developed.</p><p>For instance, King Zhou's palace occupied the thirty-third heaven, and low-level cultivators generally did not venture into the higher heavens alone.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang decided to go to the branch on the twentieth heaven.</p>
