<h1>Chapter 390: The Price</h1><p>Thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed.  Above the dark pool, Yu Hua hovered, besieged by a swarm of Horned Flying Fish-Dragons. Clearly, he didn't have the Intoxicating Dragon Saliva concocted by Yun Youzi and had disturbed these ancient beasts upon entering.</p><p>Beneath Yu Hua, a large, hemispherical, pale blue shield of light flickered, warding off the attacks of the Horned Flying Fish-Dragons.  Enraged, the creatures shrieked, their horns emitting continuous bolts of lightning that bombarded the shield. The shield's surface, now layered with accumulated lightning resembling plasma, looked precarious.</p><p>Despite his cultivation level, Yu Hua was entangled by the Horned Flying Fish-Dragons and unable to break free for the moment. This demonstrated the terrifying power of the beasts' magic. He was thankful for the Intoxicating Dragon Saliva.  Had he and Yun Youzi startled the Horned Flying Fish-Dragons without it, they would have been in grave danger.</p><p>“Did Zhao Yan fall at your hands?”</p><p>Recognizing Qin Sang, Yu Hua instantly grasped the situation and connected the dots. His expression darkened as he said coldly, “That waste! Controlling the Heart-Devouring Insects and still killed by you. Truly unexpected. No wonder I haven't been able to find him for so many years.”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>“So… the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid is in your possession!”</p><p>Ecstasy suddenly flooded Yu Hua's face. He knew about the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, killing intent flashing in his eyes. He stared coldly at Yu Hua without a word and suddenly waved his hand, unleashing a golden light.</p><p>The Soul-Binding Rope, like a dragon emerging from water, shot towards Yu Hua, about to bind him.  At this moment, Qin Sang was effectively allied with the Horned Flying Fish-Dragons. Even if Yu Hua was at the False Core Realm, there was a chance they could subdue him together—a rare opportunity Qin Sang wouldn't miss.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Hua didn't dodge. Instead, a sneer appeared on his lips.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The light shield pulsed, the plasma vibrating and sending out a wave. A surge of lightning was ejected from the shield, transforming into several incredibly violent bolts that struck the Soul-Binding Rope with extreme speed and precision.</p><p>Caught off guard, Qin Sang couldn't retract the rope in time.</p><p>With a boom, the Soul-Binding Rope was engulfed by lightning.  Its spiritual light was instantly dispersed by the powerful bolts, its form dimming as it fell to the ground, covered in cracks and seemingly useless.</p><p>Qin Sang's face paled. Fortunately, he reacted quickly and withdrew his divine sense from the Soul-Binding Rope in time, avoiding harm. But a high-quality, supreme-grade magical artifact, a highly useful tool for capturing enemies, had been easily destroyed, causing him immense pain.</p><p>So that was how the lightning that had attacked him earlier was generated. Although trapped, Yu Hua could still borrow the power of the plasma to counterattack.</p><p>Launching a sneak attack on Yu Hua would be difficult. No wonder Yu Hua was so confident.</p><p>However, Qin Sang hadn't expected the Soul-Binding Rope to truly bind Yu Hua.</p><p>The moment the rope was destroyed, a faint sword shadow slowly materialized near Yu Hua.</p><p>When forced out of hiding by Yu Hua, Qin Sang had already divided his attention to release the Ebony Sword, setting up the trap in advance and silently maneuvering it closer. The Soul-Binding Rope was just a decoy to attract Yu Hua's attention and conceal the Ebony Sword's approach.  The price, however, was steep, with the rope completely destroyed.</p><p>Fortunately, the Ebony Sword had successfully reached Yu Hua.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The moment Yu Hua vibrated the light shield, the Ebony Sword seized the opportunity to get closer.  Further approach would risk discovery and ruin the element of surprise, so Qin Sang chose this moment to fully activate the sword.</p><p>Sword Qi erupted, stabbing at Yu Hua!</p><p>By the time Yu Hua noticed the Ebony Sword, it was too late to avoid it. Sensing the exceptionally sharp aura, he immediately realized this was no ordinary spirit sword.</p><p>The sneer on his face vanished, replaced by a cold glare at Qin Sang. He suddenly struck out with his palm, sending two black orbs flying.</p><p>The Profound Yin Thunder! Qin Sang recognized them instantly.</p><p>Although powerful, the Ebony Sword was no longer what it once was.  While it might suffer some damage from the Profound Yin Thunder, it wouldn't be severe, requiring only a longer period of nurturing.</p><p>Compared to killing Yu Hua, this price was negligible.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang hardened his resolve. Instead of dodging, the Ebony Sword accelerated.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yu Hua didn't aim the Profound Yin Thunder directly at the sword but at the light shield.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang felt puzzled, a loud boom echoed as the Profound Yin Thunder exploded before the shield.  The shield, locked in a stalemate with the plasma, had its balance shattered by the explosion.</p><p>As the shield fragmented, Yu Hua roared, his hand seals changing. The shards transformed into a swirling vortex, drawing in a portion of the lightning plasma and hurtling towards the Ebony Sword.</p><p>This vortex wasn't simply the Profound Yin Thunder, but a terrifying fusion of its power, the Horned Flying Fish-Dragons' energy, and the might of a False Core Realm cultivator.</p><p>If the Ebony Sword continued its pursuit, it would be struck head-on by this furious energy!</p><p>Qin Sang's face drastically changed.  The Ebony Sword was his lifebound spirit sword, and the Killing Sigils on it were intricately linked to his cultivation techniques. It couldn't be destroyed.</p><p>Forgetting about pursuing Yu Hua, Qin Sang urgently recalled the Ebony Sword. But now, it was Yu Hua who relentlessly controlled the vortex, twisting its trajectory to continue the chase.</p><p>Although fast, the Ebony Sword was slower than the vortex.  Seeing his lifebound sword about to be consumed, Qin Sang's eyes widened in fury.  With a roar, he slammed his palm forward, sending a black stone flying.</p><p>The Black Dragon Stone rapidly expanded, intersecting with the Ebony Sword just in time to shield it from the vortex.</p><p>His vision was filled with blinding white light.</p><p>A sharp pain shot through Qin Sang's chest as a powerful impact slammed into him. He grunted, crashing into the ice wall behind him in agonizing pain.</p><p>When the white light dissipated, the passage before him, including the Black Dragon Stone, had vanished, replaced by a gaping chasm.</p><p>‘Splash…’</p><p>River water poured in, expanding the dark pool dozens of times over.</p><p>Clutching his chest, Qin Sang's face was pale.  Fortunately, the Black Dragon Stone had detonated the vortex; he had only been hit by the residual force.  Otherwise, the consequences would have been dire.</p><p>But the price he paid was heavy: the Soul-Binding Rope and the Black Dragon Stone, two supreme-grade magical artifacts, were destroyed in exchange for only two of Yu Hua’s Profound Yin Thunder, without even injuring him.</p><p>Instead, Yu Hua had decisively detonated his precious Profound Yin Thunder to escape his predicament.</p><p>No matter how he calculated it, Qin Sang had lost.</p><p>Was this the power of the False Core Realm?</p><p>Qin Sang was filled with dread.  His eyes narrowed as he noticed a gray shadow flash across his vision, rushing towards him.</p><p>The Horned Flying Fish-Dragons in the pool, also affected by the explosion, were disoriented.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily swept his hand over his Mustard Seed Bag, planting a large banner on the ground.</p><p>Endless yellow sand instantly filled the ice cavern.</p>
