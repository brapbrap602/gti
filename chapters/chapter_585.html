Chapter 578: The Latecomers


Qin Sang relentlessly ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to attack the ferocious tiger.
Yun Youzi didn't watch the fight, his gaze sweeping the surroundings.
Before them lay a dry riverbed, filled with smooth pebbles worn by the water.  Across the river was a broken mountain, its collapsed rocks partially blocking the riverbed.
Beyond the mountain was endless darkness.
Yun Youzi warned Qin Sang not to let the Flying Night Rakshasa leave the riverbed, even if the tiger escaped to the other side.
Qin Sang obeyed.
Soon, Yun Youzi's eyes lit up. He focused on a pebble with green markings, raised his hand, formed a hand seal, and struck it.
At that moment, the tiger's roars intensified, its movements frantic and erratic, clearly targeting Yun Youzi.
Qin Sang knew Yun Youzi had found something crucial.  He stared at the pebble, and after a while, he too noticed something unusual.
‘Poof!’
The hand seal landed on the speckled pebble, erupting in a green light.
The tiger, which had been battling the Flying Night Rakshasa, suddenly froze, whimpered, and vanished without a trace. The world around them shattered again.
To be precise, only the world on this side of the riverbed shattered.
A faint pressure they had felt also disappeared.
Seizing the opportunity, they leaped across the riverbank. Looking back, they saw the familiar riverbank.
"This is the real ancient medicinal garden. However, the ancient restrictions are extremely chaotic and ubiquitous; you encounter a layer of restrictions every few steps, sealing off sections of space. We can only see at most two layers of the restricted space at a time. We must follow the route and break through the layers one by one."
Yun Youzi explained, "Without the Flying Night Rakshasa, we would only be able to break the restrictions from the edge, evading the tiger's pursuit, gradually weakening its strength by breaking the restrictions, and slowly searching for the core. Now, we can directly find and break the core of the restriction, achieving the same result with half the effort."
The Flying Night Rakshasa, being a living corpse, was more agile than ordinary animated corpses.
Qin Sang didn't need to expend much mental energy controlling it.
He wanted to help Yun Youzi, but found the ancient restrictions extremely complex. His mastery of restriction techniques was not yet sufficient to be of much help.
However, Qin Sang didn't give up. He followed Yun Youzi, studying independently, incorporating his accumulated knowledge, and making rapid progress.
‘Whoosh whoosh…’
They stopped halfway up the mountain slope.
The mountain had collapsed at this point, and their view extended beyond the broken mountain to the next layer of the restricted space.
On the other side of the mountain, the left was a sheer cliff, straight up and down, with a few dry vines hanging precariously, looking like they might snap at the slightest touch. Below was a pitch-black abyss.
The right, however, was a ridge.
Clearly, these two paths were blocked by different ancient restrictions, requiring a choice.
The number of forks in the road would undoubtedly increase. Without knowing the correct path, wandering aimlessly would make finding the  Jiangyun Purple Fruit impossible before the Ziwei Palace sealed itself.
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi reached the cliff top.
The Flying Night Rakshasa suddenly threw a punch.  The force of the punch created ripples in space, revealing a very weak barrier.
The punch blasted a hole straight through the barrier.
Before the hole could close, they jumped through it and fell towards the bottom of the cliff.
This layer of restriction was broken very easily.  There was no tiger pursuit, and there was no need to search for the core; brute force was enough.
This indicated that this layer of restriction was very weak. It might disappear in a few hundred years, connecting the surrounding spaces.
This situation wasn't uncommon. The restrictions in the ancient medicinal garden were not uniform; each had different strengths and sizes.
Powerful restrictions could even stump Yuan Ying cultivators.
Fortunately, on the path to picking the Jiangyun Purple Fruit, except for a few difficult spots, the power of the restrictions was within the Flying Night Rakshasa's capabilities. Otherwise, the cultivators at the Yao Dan stage wouldn't be able to gather the herbs.
As for those difficult spots, they were tests and trials for them.
The moment they entered the cliff, a powerful suction force suddenly came from the bottom of the cliff.
Then, a gust of yin wind blew from above. The combined effect caused Qin Sang and the others to plummet rapidly.
The shadow at the bottom of the cliff was like a gaping maw, waiting for its prey to fall into its trap.
Qin Sang and Yun Youzi exchanged a look and shouted in unison, their spiritual energy surging as they resisted the yin wind and the suction force.


The next moment, countless bony claws erupted from the darkness at the cliff bottom.  A forest of white, skeletal claws clawed and scratched, as if countless living skeletons were rapidly climbing upwards from the earth.

A ghostly wind howled overhead, sending a chill down their spines.

Without Yun Youzi needing to urge her, Qin Sang forcefully broke free from the suction, flying upwards. She ordered the Flying Night Rakshasa to descend, and as it neared the claws, her corpse energy suddenly exploded.

The corpse energy formed a massive circular wave, sweeping outwards. A shattering sound echoed as the claws were pulverized.

Countless fragments of bone flew everywhere, creating a blinding white haze.

But the claws were inexhaustible; as soon as one batch was destroyed, a new one surged forth, relentlessly climbing upwards.  The Flying Night Rakshasa fought endlessly, but the space above them was shrinking.

Then, Yun Youzi moved.

He opened his palm, and the flawless pearl spun gently. A white light shot downwards, transforming into a flying sword that pierced the depths of the bone forest, slipping through the gaps between the claws.

A non-human shriek pierced the air.

The suction and the chilling wind vanished instantly.  Simultaneously, all the bony claws disappeared without a trace, the entire scene seeming like a dream.

They finally saw the cliff bottom.

Nestled against the cliff base was a semi-circular, icy pool containing water. Deep and emanating an intense chill, the pool was hidden from view by the claws until the barrier was broken, revealing it to be the next layer's barrier.

“This icy pool is bottomless,” Yun Youzi said softly, beside the pool. “A Yuan Ying cultivator once spent time exploring it and unearthed a Heavenly Cold Herb!”

The Heavenly Cold Herb was far more valuable than the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit, even improving the true essence of Yuan Ying cultivators.

Qin Sang couldn’t help but envy the Yuan Ying cultivator's luck.

The barrier near the pool was not strong. Yun Youzi quickly located its core and had the Flying Night Rakshasa break it.

But just as the Flying Night Rakshasa was about to strike, Yun Youzi's expression changed. He abruptly stopped Qin Sang, gazing upwards at the cliff, saying gravely, “Someone’s following us!  They’re taking the same path!”

Qin Sang was startled.

“So fast?”

Those following them were likely cultivators from the Heavenly Demon Hill.

Unexpectedly, they had encountered them so soon after entering the Ancient Medicine Garden.
