<h1>Chapter 505 My Own Path</h1><p>By the river stood a grand mansion.</p><p>Extravagantly luxurious, it sprawled over a thousand acres.</p><p>It was the Gongsun estate.</p><p>Unknown to many, the Gongsun family was divided into inner and outer circles.</p><p>The outer circle consisted of ordinary people, while the inner circle was the true Gongsun clan, a family of cultivators affiliated with Lesser Huashan Mountain, serving as its guardians.</p><p>The Gongsun clan's strength was relatively weak. The current head, Gongsun Li, was two hundred and fifty-three years old and only at the middle stage of Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Today, the Gongsun estate was draped in white, a scene of mourning.</p><p>Dressed in burial clothes, Gongsun Li sat in a grand armchair, awaiting his end.</p><p>Before him, a young man in white knelt on the ground.</p><p>They were the only two in the room.</p><p>With an unreadable expression, Gongsun Li stared blankly at the clear blue sky outside, murmuring to himself.</p><p>“I had the potential to reach Core Formation, but in my youth, I indulged in worldly pleasures, wasting my prime years, and only managed to barely establish my foundation at fifty-eight.</p><p>“After gaining another hundred years of life, I continued my frivolous ways. My mansion was filled with wives and concubines, and I indulged in countless delicacies and fine wines. By the time I reached one hundred and fifty, my cultivation had barely progressed.</p><p>“Only then did I suddenly realize that time was running out, and I broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“I wanted to mend my ways, but it was too late. I exhausted all my efforts and barely broke through to the middle stage at two hundred. Then my vital energy declined, and further progress became impossible.</p><p>“Now, facing my end, I realize that the past was like a dream or an illusion.</p><p>“Thinking back, I regret it! I regret it so much!”</p><p>The young man listened to Gongsun Li with a bewildered expression. Seeing Gongsun Li beckoning him, he hurried closer.</p><p>“Dong’er!”</p><p>Gongsun Li tightly gripped the young man’s hand, suddenly gasped violently, his eyes wide open, and with difficulty, uttered his last words, “Your talent is no less than mine. After joining Lesser Huashan, you must cultivate diligently and not be disturbed by external things, lest your Dao heart be eroded, and you follow in my footsteps!”</p><p>With that, Gongsun Li’s head suddenly tilted to the side, and he passed away.</p><p>In a corner of the room, a shadowy figure flickered and vanished, unnoticed by anyone in the mansion.</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving the Gongsun estate, Qin Sang ascended on a cloud. After determining his direction, he flew towards the small island.</p><p>A full month had passed since he left Soaring Dragon Mountain.</p><p>For the past month,</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't been diligently cultivating in his cave. Instead, he sometimes disguised himself as a mortal, sometimes concealed his presence, traveling through the various countries near Lesser Huashan, observing the world.</p><p>He saw many people.</p><p>Among them were beggars, commoners, nobles, those seeking immortality, rogue cultivators, and cultivation families like the Gongsun clan…</p><p>Qin Sang did heed Qi Yuanhu’s advice and immerse himself in the mortal world.</p><p>However, what he witnessed, he sought out deliberately, were all scenes of death and parting.</p><p>He wondered if Qi Yuanhu would cough up blood if he knew.</p><p>Qin Sang’s Dao heart was firm. He had long determined his path and wouldn't be swayed by external factors. Therefore, he only observed, watching the unwillingness of mortals clinging to their attachments before death, and the regret of cultivators as their end approached.</p><p>Back on the island,</p><p>Cloud Wanderer was already waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression relaxed as he descended from the cloud.</p><p>“I’ve kept you waiting, Senior.”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer shook his head, looked Qin Sang over, and asked, “You've been immersed in the mortal world for a month, observing all sorts of things. What are your thoughts?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. “Others’ paths are not my path. I was merely an observer. I walk my own path.”</p><p>“Gaining clarity of heart amidst the myriad aspects of human life is also a kind of harvest.”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer stroked his beard and smiled, no longer pursuing the matter. He changed the subject and asked, “You said you had something you needed my help with. What is it?”</p><p>Qin Sang paused and said, “I want to ask you to help me steal the Azure Sun罡 Essence from the Azure Sun Demonic Sect.”</p><p>These words startled even Cloud Wanderer.  He said in a deep voice, “I remember, when you asked me where the Heaven罡 Essence had fallen, I advised you not to mess around. Didn't you listen?”</p><p>“I remember every word you've said, Senior, and I dare not forget,” Qin Sang remained unmoved. “But I have compelling reasons. The Heaven罡 Essence is related to my path to Core Formation. I can't take the essence from the Pure Yang Sect Leader's cave, so I can only target the Azure Sun Demonic Sect.”</p><p>“Related to your path to Core Formation?”</p><p>Cloud Wanderer’s expression turned serious.</p><p>As a cultivator, dedicated to the Dao, he naturally understood the significance of the path to Core Formation. If it were him, he would face any hardship or danger to pursue it.</p><p>“Do you know what the Azure Sun罡 Essence means to the Azure Sun Demonic Sect? They will never let you take it.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “I understand that the Azure Sun Demonic Sect will never agree, so I have no choice but to steal it.”</p><p>The Azure Sun罡 Essence was the foundation of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect.</p><p>Their core cultivation method relied on the Azure Sun罡 Essence to generate Demonic Fire.</p><p>Back then, the founding ancestor of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect discovered the Azure Sun罡 Essence on Divine罡 Peak, which led to his rise to fame and the growth of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect into a major demonic sect that dominated the Lesser Cold Region.</p><p>However, the Azure Sun罡 Essence was finite.</p><p>Countless years ago, Heaven罡 Qi descended from the heavens and landed on Divine罡 Peak, undergoing countless transformations and evolving into the罡 Essence.</p><p>Afterward, even if more Heaven罡 Qi descended, it was unlikely to fall on Divine罡 Peak so coincidentally, and even if it did, it might not evolve into the罡 Essence again.</p><p>Since the establishment of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect, the Azure Sun罡 Essence had only been consumed, not replenished.</p><p>Once the Azure Sun罡 Essence was depleted, and no alternative could be found, it would be equivalent to the severing of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect’s foundation, rendering them effectively extinct.</p><p>Qin Sang had been undercover in the Azure Sun Market for many years, conducting investigations and inquiries, and had learned a great deal. He knew that the amount of Azure Sun罡 Essence on Divine罡 Peak was not optimistic.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the Azure Sun Demonic Sect would never allow anyone else to touch the Azure Sun罡 Essence, even in exchange for magical treasures.</p><p>Moreover, the Azure Sun Demonic Sect possessed ancestral legacies and had no shortage of magical treasures.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang said that he couldn't trade for it, only steal it.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer stopped trying to dissuade Qin Sang and instead helped him consider the feasibility of the plan. “Steal the Azure Sun罡 Essence? Although the Azure Sun Demonic Sect has declined, there are still four Golden Core cultivators within the sect. The sect leader is even a late Golden Core expert. Although he's nearing the end of his lifespan and far from Nascent Soul, with his ancestral legacies, his strength must be terrifying… Besides me, who else have you recruited? How many Golden Core experts?”</p><p>“None at all.”</p><p>[Read books and get red envelopes] Follow the official account [Book Friends Base Camp] Read books and draw up to 888 cash red envelopes!</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head sheepishly.</p><p>“The only helper I've found is you, Senior.</p><p>“However, not all four Golden Core cultivators of the Azure Sun Demonic Sect are currently within the sect. As far as I know, one has been dispatched to the Chaotic Islands to fight against the Heavenly Alliance, and he won't be able to leave until the war is over.</p><p>“Another is representing the Azure Sun Demonic Sect in defending Azure Sun City against the Spirit Tide, and won't return until the tide recedes.</p><p>“Currently, only the sect leader and a newly ascended Golden Core cultivator are in the sect. The Violet Firmament Palace is about to open, and the Azure Sun Demonic Sect leader will certainly not miss it.
