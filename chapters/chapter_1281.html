<h1>Chapter 1273: Unexpected Gains</h1><p>Chapter 1273: Unexpected Gains</p><p>The Soul Tablet was shattered.</p><p>Master Chongyi sacrificed himself.</p><p>Everyone silently sealed the Blood Lake.</p><p>"My condolences to both of you,"</p><p>said those who knew Si Di and Yao Jing, offering comfort.</p><p>Both were Yuan Ying cultivators. Though deeply grieved, they remained composed, merely nodding.</p><p>Everyone was moved by Master Chongyi’s sacrifice and promised to attend his memorial service at Taiyi Danzong.</p><p>“The Master has ascended, while we must continue to struggle in the mortal realm,”</p><p>said the Lord Tongyou, sighing. “The Abyss of Sin remains a grave threat.  Though we failed to obtain the Jade Bone, we first beheaded Ye Lao Mo’s avatar and then severely wounded Tian Zheng Lao Gui.  Our achievements are significant, making this the ideal time for a counter-offensive. I shall proceed to Tianxing Plateau to discuss this matter with Daoist Zhen.”</p><p>Lord Tongyou looked at Qin Sang and Qing Jun as he spoke.</p><p>Qin Sang and Qing Jun exchanged glances and nodded.  “We have the same intention!”</p><p>The chaos in Beichen Realm had lasted too long, hindering cultivation and the development of their sects.</p><p>Lord Tongyou was overjoyed, repeatedly praising their decision.  “Unless you have urgent matters, please make your arrangements and assemble quickly.  This is a decisive battle; we must utterly extinguish the Abyss of Sin's arrogance!”</p><p>Everyone agreed.</p><p>The Blood Lake remained stable after its sealing, with no monsters attempting to breach it.</p><p>“There’s no immediate danger of monsters breaking out, but we must remain vigilant.  Each sect should send disciples to guard the valley in rotation as a precaution. What do you all think?”</p><p>Someone proposed, and everyone agreed.  They quickly established a system. The surviving Golden Core cultivators were all core disciples of major sects, and two were selected to guard the area.</p><p>Lord Tongyou departed for Tianxing Plateau.</p><p>The others dispersed to prepare for war at their respective sects.</p><p>Dongyang Bo accompanied Lord Tongyou.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang knew there wouldn't be another chance to act against Dongyang Bo soon and stopped focusing on that, but he maintained his guard.</p><p>As they parted, the other Yuan Ying cultivators made a point of saying farewell to Qin Sang and Qing Jun, who responded accordingly.</p><p>Bing Han and Xiang Qing lingered.</p><p>"Cold Daoist is always enigmatic; I'm not surprised, but I didn't expect Daoist Qin to be so formidable! Such masterful disguise.  Daoist Xiang and I spent several days with you at Shen Gang Peak, and I never suspected a thing!"</p><p>Bing Han's beautiful eyes sparkled, playfully reproaching him. "I recall you mentioned visiting the Xu Ling Sect. I've been anticipating your visit, but you haven't come. Was it a jest?"</p><p>Qin Sang quickly replied, “How dare I jest? I've been busy refining the spirit fire and haven't had the time. Once this war is over, I will definitely pay a visit.”</p><p>Refining the burnt wood to nurture Yun Youzi’s spirit, and crafting a treasure to collect the Nanming Li Fire, required exceptional skills in refinement.</p><p>Self-learning had its limits, and Qin Sang had long coveted Xu Ling Sect's refining techniques, pondering how to obtain them from Bing Han.</p><p>Bing Han nodded with satisfaction.  “Then I shall prepare fine wine and await your arrival.”</p><p>Then, Xiang Qing exchanged a few pleasantries before leaving with Bing Han.</p><p>Watching them depart, Qin Sang used voice transmission to ask Qing Jun, “Senior Sister, how much do you know about Bing Han and Xiang Qing?”</p><p>“The Xu Ling Sect profited greatly from the Three Realms War, second only to the Taiyi Danzong. Bing Han is adept at keeping a low profile and maintaining good relations, so she doesn't attract attention. However, this woman is not simple. She seems to be secretly plotting something; her words just now were suggestive. You and Xiang Qing both excel in fire-based techniques; perhaps that's why she's befriending you.”</p><p>Qing Jun, a keen observer, saw through Bing Han’s motives.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't concerned about Bing Han's schemes; her having needs provided a basis for exchange.</p><p>At this moment, Jing Yu suggested visiting their old cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang persuaded Jing Yu to go with them to Yuan Shen Gate first; it was safe, and she could refine the Corpse Flower Amber there to seek a breakthrough.</p><p>Qing Jun said, “I wish to meditate.  Go ahead; I'll find a nearby cave and wait for you.”</p><p>Jing Yu and her child went off.</p><p>Qin Sang stayed to protect Qing Jun.</p><p>Outside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang paced back and forth, occasionally glancing at the cave, his brow furrowed.</p><p>He wondered if Qing Jun's excessive energy consumption during the battle with Ye Lao Mo, or a severe injury, was causing her to need immediate meditation, before even leaving Wuyaya Valley.</p><p>The chaos earlier had prevented him from noticing anything unusual about her.</p><p>Reflecting back, since leaving the blood pool, the mysterious aura surrounding Qing Jun seemed to have lessened.</p><p>This feeling was ethereal, indescribable.  Even Qin Sang wasn't sure if it was a hallucination.</p><p>"Could it be that Qingluan's severe injury is backfiring?"</p><p>Qin Sang had witnessed the destruction of a Qingluan puppet before.  At that time, Qing Jun, using the alias Jing Po Po, had effortlessly summoned another.  She'd assumed Qingluan's injury wouldn't significantly impact her.</p><p>However, the current Qingluan puppet was comparable in strength to a transformed妖兽. It must have taken her immense effort and some secret technique to refine it.  It was certainly not comparable to the previous puppet.</p><p>"Like father, like daughter,"</p><p>Qin Sang thought, remembering how Elder Qingzhu had persevered despite being critically injured.</p><p>Not long after, Jing Yu and Fat Chicken returned. Qin Sang had already released Fat Chicken from its restraints. The mother and child seemed to have endless things to talk about.</p><p>After another two hours,</p><p>Qing Jun emerged from seclusion.  Meeting Qin Sang's gaze, she understood his concern.  "I'm fine," she said, "but Qingluan is severely damaged and can't be summoned for battle in the near future. We'll have to rely on the Five Directions Pagoda."</p><p>…</p><p>The two humans and two妖 flew directly out of Wuyaya Valley and back to Yuan Shen Gate.</p><p>Bai was still in seclusion, it was unknown when he would comprehend the Bone Curse and the Corpse Soul Pearl to advance to Corpse King.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't disturb Bai.</p><p>He chose a cave dwelling, settled Jing Yu and her child, and then returned to his own cave.</p><p>On the way back, Qin Sang asked Qing Jun about puppetry, and gained much.</p><p>Qing Jun taught him several techniques for controlling puppets.</p><p>She also shared what she knew about the Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace and the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet, though stressing the information was uncertain and needed verification.</p><p>The Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet possessed the strength to fight a mid-Yuan Ying cultivator, but even the successive ancestors of Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace had been unable to subdue it, only managing to suppress it within the sect.</p><p>Qing Jun advised Qin Sang not to have high expectations for the Talisman Puppet.  Her mastery of puppetry might not surpass the ancestors of Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace, so finding a way to subdue it would be difficult, and she could only do her best.</p><p>The best-case scenario, she said, would be similar to Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace; keeping it within the sect as a guardian puppet.</p><p>However, after discovering a more extraordinary use for the Yuan Ying Talisman Puppet, Qin Sang’s focus had shifted.</p><p>When he investigated the puppet and tried to sense the soul shadow within, he was surprised to find he could experience a trace of the cultivator's mindset.</p><p>Among the ancestors of Shang Yuan Qing Jing Palace, there were many mid-Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>Could there be a mid-Yuan Ying soul shadow inside the puppet?</p>
