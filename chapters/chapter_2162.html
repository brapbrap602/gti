<h1>Chapter 2152: The Envoy</h1><p>Streams of figures flew from the light, these people from different tribes, their appearances incredibly varied.  Li Yu Fu and Yu Nu watched in amazement.  Among the strange races they had seen, the most unusual were the few from the Jiao Jiao tribe, though small of stature, their features and limbs similar to humans; yet many here were stranger still.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the archipelago, fixing on a distant island.  The most people flew from there; many were winged, and their aura was the strongest, unrestrained and openly displayed.</p><p>Under the influence of this aura, dark clouds gathered in the high heavens, the celestial phenomena dramatically shifting.  Upon the eruption of their power, the surrounding tribes immediately weakened, none daring to contend. From that aura, Qin Sang faintly sensed a subtle energy, seemingly not inferior to the Yuan Xiang tribe leader, and not just one!</p><p>“The masters of the Feather People have arrived!”</p><p>The Yuan Xiang tribe leader said solemnly, turning to Qin Sang and the others.  “Next, we will re-establish the great array, restore the sea market. You may choose any spirit island to settle on.”</p><p>Saying this, he nodded to Wei Yin and Yuan Jian, leading the three tribes' masters towards the dark clouds.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu exchanged a glance, found a nearby small island, set up a chessboard to play, waiting for the upcoming spectacle.</p><p>The shifting palace shone frequently, more and more masters of different races arriving. In a short time, two or three hundred strong masters of the Celestial Department gathered around the Feather People, and more continued to join. Ordinarily, it would be nearly impossible to see so many experts at the Transcending Void level gathered in one place.</p><p>Qin Sang saw Si Lu and Shao Shi in the crowd; they surrounded a sovereign.  This person had inky black hair, bound with a jade crown, eyebrows like distant mountains, eyes like stars.  Standing with hands behind his back, his demeanor was calm, yet full of majesty, impossible to ignore even amongst so many masters.</p><p>“This person must be the Si Sovereign…”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  The Si Sovereign noticed his gaze, turned his eyes, a faint smile playing on his lips as he nodded in acknowledgement.</p><p>Now was not the time for conversation, Qin Sang only nodded in return, then looked towards the other side of the archipelago.</p><p>On the far horizon, at the edge of sight, another group gathered, their aura no weaker than the Celestial Department—presumably the Water Department masters. They were clearly distinct, their auras showing signs of confrontation.</p><p>In addition, there were some scattered auras, neither close to the Water Department nor particularly friendly to the Celestial Department, maintaining a respectful distance.</p><p>The masters of various departments gathered, seemingly in discussion or awaiting a certain moment, remaining inactive.</p><p>The foul air receded, allowing the discernment of day and night by sunlight. After waiting for three full days and nights, they finally moved.</p><p>By now, the foul air had retreated further, revealing more islands, the outline of the great array largely visible.</p><p>“It begins…”</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu lifted their gaze from the chessboard, as they saw everyone disperse, flying in an orderly manner towards various positions in the great array; the Water Department masters on the other side did the same.</p><p>A rumbling thunder echoed around, the sea waves growing more violent.</p><p>Suddenly, a faint mist appeared in the void, first emerging from the edges of the archipelago. As the mist rose, more and more islands were enveloped in the light fog.</p><p>In a short time, Qin Sang and Su Nu were surrounded by a white expanse.</p><p>If someone were standing outside the archipelago at this moment, they would see a huge cloud of mist floating above the sea. The mist constantly shifted, expanding, lengthening, eventually transforming into a white dragon. Only its head was visible, its tail unseen, its length immeasurable, thousands upon thousands of miles long; countless islands lay within the dragon's belly.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>A sudden roar, earth-shattering.</p><p>The dragon raised its head, its tail like a long whip; a casual flick caused the wind and clouds to change, the sea to rise in tumultuous waves, a bottomless chasm torn open on the surface.</p><p>The River of Filth seemed to tremble, the foul air momentarily stagnating, then shattering with a resounding crash. The powerful black tide was dispersed by the shockwave.</p><p>The dragon, seizing the momentum, soared through the clouds, straight towards the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, towards the high heavens, discovering a strange wave spreading. All the islands were lifted upwards by the mist, speeding at incredible velocity, seemingly about to break through some kind of constraint, shattering this world.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Thunder struck the heavens.</p><p>Everyone's hearts trembled as they witnessed the shocking sight.</p><p>The dragon had punched a hole in the heavens, seemingly about to escape into the void. A white ring formed at the opening, then spread at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The swirling clouds passed, smoothing the chaotic forces scattered in the void.  The lingering miasma dissipated, its murky tide receding to near silence.</p><p>Peace, serenity, brightness, and cleanliness—scenes previously alien to the Nether River—now unfolded before them.</p><p>White clouds drifted lazily.</p><p>A gentle rain began to fall, softly blanketing each island, silently nourishing the land.</p><p>The rain brought life.  New sprouts emerged from the island soil. Qin Sang looked down; a hint of green appeared in a crack in the stone, a tender shoot pushing upwards, twisting and turning, quickly developing leaves and branches, finally blossoming into a delicate pink flower beside the chessboard, swaying gently in the breeze, emitting a faint fragrance.</p><p>In a short time, red flowers and green trees sprang up around them, a small stream meandering at their feet.  The other islands had also transformed. Some boasted cascading waterfalls, white ribbons tumbling from the sky; others extended vines connecting to neighboring islands; still others boasted towering trees, continuing to grow as if to support the heavens; some remained shrouded in mist…</p><p>Each island displayed a unique and wondrous spectacle.</p><p>The rain lessened.</p><p>The surroundings instantly brightened.  Beams of light pierced through gaps in the clouds, dispelling the gloom and chaos.</p><p>The clouds gradually thinned but did not completely dissipate.  Patches of mist and swirling smoke created a scene of ethereal beauty, culminating in a rainbow bridge arching across the islands, a dreamlike sight.</p><p>Qin Sang, captivated by the scenery, didn't notice the strange look that crossed Su Nu's eyes, as if she sensed something amiss.</p><p>She glanced at Qin Sang, her expression unchanged, lightly manipulating her chess pieces, appearing to be deeply engrossed in the game.</p><p>Except for a few special islands, all were unclaimed, free for anyone to choose.</p><p>The Yuanjiao Fair typically lasted about six months, the most important event for the Yi people. During this time, countless cultivators came and went, some intending to stay for a while and build homes.</p><p>Intending to arrive at the fair's end, Qin Sang decided to build a palace on this island.  He wasn't concerned with extravagance.  After a quick survey, he selected a geomantically auspicious site nearby and channeled the earth's energy.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>Stone pillars and walls sprang from the earth, and several ancient stone halls were instantly constructed as his dwelling.</p><p>Li Yu and Yu Nu bowed and withdrew, retiring to the halls to rest.  Though the journey hadn't been long, they had endured repeated shocks, and despite Qin Sang's protection, they felt utterly exhausted.</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Nu continued their game, quietly observing the ever-changing scene.  As the array gradually improved, the transformation continued, resembling a fairyland, lacking only spiritual beasts and birds.</p><p>As the game neared its end, Qin Sang, slightly ahead, looked towards the horizon.  Yuan Miao arrived, calling out to Qin Zhenren.</p><p>"There will be some trade fairs shortly.  Since most haven't arrived yet, and the attendees will mainly be high-ranking members of the upper clans, there should be many good things.  Qin Zhenren, would you like to join?"</p><p>"Where is the Yuanxiang clan leader?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"The clan leader has accepted the Feather King's invitation to a banquet.  The invitees are mostly clan leaders or grand elders from the major upper clans, at least late-stage cultivators. Even if Qin Zhenren possesses the combat strength of a late-stage cultivator, lacking the actual cultivation and being an outsider, he wouldn't be eligible," Yuan Miao stated frankly.</p><p>Qin Sang inwardly lamented.  Such a high-level exchange between top-tier cultivators would undoubtedly contain countless treasures; even a glimpse would have been worthwhile.</p><p>"Qin Brother wins this game."</p><p>Su Nu conceded defeat.  "I'll join you."</p><p>The three immediately set off, Yuan Miao leading them towards one of the spirit islands—the one with the colossal tree.</p><p>The tree was still growing, albeit slowly.  Its crown resembled a canopy, its layered branches like a pagoda, standing out from the others, visible from anywhere in the archipelago.</p><p>This island, home to the giant tree, was one of the largest, situated in the center of the archipelago, bordered by the Celestial and Water sections.</p><p>Approaching the tree, Qin Sang noticed the bustling activity but also an invisible boundary separating the Celestial and Water sections, preventing anyone from crossing.</p><p>"Can we go to the other side?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"It's best to wait for more people. There's no actual restriction; it's just a mental barrier.  With more people, it will be easier to cross. However, since Qin Zhenren is an outsider, the Water section shouldn't be too opposed," Yuan Miao replied.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looked up, and saw numerous bright red fruits hanging amongst the green leaves.  The fruits were round like melons, but completely scentless.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang noticed someone sending a burst of spiritual energy towards the tree.  A new fruit immediately grew, initially splitting into three lobes like a gaping maw before swallowing the energy and closing tightly.</p><p>"The trading fair is still some time away.  Actually, this is where everyone really trades. Some call it the Treasure Tree.  If you want to sell something, you hang your treasure on the tree, and if you find the right buyer, you can trade here. You can use your spiritual sense to examine them; each fruit contains a treasure. If you find something you like, you can contact the seller through the tree…"</p><p>Yuan Miao explained, eagerly checking the fruits.</p><p>Qin Sang sent out several strands of spiritual sense towards several fruits. Upon contact, he immediately knew what each contained.  Some held only a single treasure, others included detailed descriptions and conditions from the seller.</p><p>"Wow! A huge clump of Thousand-Feather Silk!"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised by this early find. Thousand-Feather Silk is an essential spiritual material for constructing Daoist altars. The supply he'd received from the Five Elements League had been used up building his own, leaving him with very little.</p><p>This clump was even larger than what he'd received from the League; the seller called it Nine-Colored Silk.  The seller's conditions were quite broad, meaning there was room for negotiation.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately probed the fruit with his spiritual sense.  Building his altar had nearly drained his resources; after absorbing the Lu family's assets, he'd recovered, and now possessed considerable wealth.  Better to be safe than sorry, he decided to continue collecting materials, planning to make significant purchases at this Yuanjiao Sea Market.</p><p>As soon as his spiritual sense entered the fruit, he sensed a response.  "Which clan are you from, friend?"</p><p>"I have a piece of Blue Ripple Gold, and I wish to trade for your Nine-Colored Silk," Qin Sang replied.</p><p>Seeing that, the other party didn't press further. "Size? Quality?"</p><p>"Top quality…"</p><p>Qin Sang used his spiritual sense to create a visual representation of the Blue Ripple Gold.</p><p>The other party was silent for a moment. "It's a little small. It's only the first day of the market; perhaps you could get a better exchange later."</p><p>"I can offer more."</p><p>As if expecting this, Qin Sang projected various spiritual items one after another.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The other party suddenly called out. "That Jade Soul Pearl, along with the Blue Ripple Gold, will suffice!"</p><p>"Agreed!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately accepted.  He had already selected the useful treasures from the Lu family's vault; the rest were for trading.</p><p>"Friend, send both treasures towards the Treasure Tree fruit.  Once I've confirmed them, I'll release the restriction…"</p><p>Qin Sang took out the Jade Soul Pearl and the Blue Ripple Gold, enveloping them in true energy and sending them towards the fruit.</p><p>The fruit seemed to react; a new bud sprouted from the stem, growing a new fruit next to the old one, swallowing both items.</p><p>A moment later, the original fruit swayed, opening to release the Thousand-Feather Silk.  Qin Sang received the silk; the fruit rapidly withered, leaving only the new, green fruit—a sign the trade was complete and the seller could collect their payment.</p><p>The treasures were safe here; the Merfolk and Featherfolk clans kept a close watch, and the tree itself was no ordinary thing.</p><p>However, this trading method had its limitations; deception was possible, and trades involving valuable items demanded caution. Some transactions were too sensitive for public display and could only occur privately.</p><p>Putting away the silk, Qin Sang continued, scanning the fruits and quickly acquiring three more spiritual materials.  He was pleased with his success.</p><p>Yuan Miao and Su Nu also made gains.</p><p>When the time arrived, Yuan Miao called for them to attend the trading fair, but Su Nu refused.  "I won't be going.  I was fortunate enough to obtain a treasure I've sought for years; I must refine it immediately."</p><p>Qin Sang and Yuan Miao didn't suspect anything.</p><p>Yuan Miao said, "There will be many more trading fairs. Missing one isn't a problem."</p><p>The three parted ways.</p><p>Su Nu returned to her cave dwelling, waited a while, and then quietly left.  She had carefully disguised herself and flew towards the edge of the islands, arriving at a secluded islet.</p><p>The island was covered with slender, emerald green trees, their leaves like bamboo. A gentle breeze rustled through them.</p><p>Entering the dense woods, Su Nu found a simple, unadorned hut, seemingly hastily constructed.  The door was closed.</p><p>Su Nu approached and sent a voice transmission.  "Which emissary has arrived?"</p><p>The hut remained silent.</p><p>Su Nu frowned, waited a moment, and again called out.  "Is it Lord Commander?"</p>
