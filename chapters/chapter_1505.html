<h1>Chapter 1496: Suspended Sword Pavilion </h1><p>'Boom! Boom! Boom!'</p><p>The Treading Snake's ferocious flames soared to the heavens.</p><p>Frigid flames rained down, a scene of ultimate splendor.</p><p>The battle between Qin Sang and Yin Changsheng created a far greater commotion than Tong Lingyu's. Apart from the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool, the stone cavern was now utterly unrecognizable.</p><p>The Treading Snake frequently lashed its long tail. Each strike was like a bolt of blue lightning, its astonishing destructive power threatening to bring the Seven Souls Killing Formation to the brink of collapse time and again.</p><p>Frigid flames danced wildly in the void.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were like fragile primitives struggling to survive in a bitter, harsh winter, facing the world's most terrifying beast. They clung to each other for survival, on the verge of death at any moment, their bodies destined to become a meal for the monstrous beast.</p><p>Liuli completely entrusted herself to Qin Sang, focusing all her mental energy on contending with Yin Changsheng for the Spiritual Treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang held Liuli close, blood streaming from his seven orifices. He appeared incredibly wretched, retreating again and again.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation, truly the only sword formation recorded in the *Nurturing Sword Chapter of the Primordial Spirit*, held firm against the Spiritual Treasure. Time and again, it neared collapse, only to be reborn from the ashes at the last moment.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had initially believed he could easily capture Qin Sang this time, but alas, things did not go as planned.</p><p>Qin Sang was clearly severely injured, on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Yet, each time he seemed about to fall, it was as if he activated some secret technique to stimulate his latent potential. He would suddenly surge with newfound strength, gaining a moment of divine prowess to overcome the danger.</p><p>By now, how could Yin Changsheng not understand? He had been tricked!</p><p>However, Yin Changsheng could never have imagined that his divine sense attacks had not harmed Qin Sang in the slightest. He could only assume that Qin Sang possessed some method of protecting his primordial spirit, and that his injuries were not as severe as they appeared.</p><p>Yin Changsheng was furious.</p><p>The Treading Snake's attacks grew increasingly ferocious, mirroring its master's mental state.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Yin Changsheng's prolonged, unsuccessful assault had clearly made him more impatient than before. The influence of the evil technique was deepening imperceptibly. Perhaps Tong Lingyu's scheme might actually succeed.</p><p>However, Qin Sang consistently felt that this approach was unwise.</p><p>It was tantamount to placing his hopes on his opponent.</p><p>If any variables arose, such as his opponent possessing an unexpected trump card, everything would be in vain.</p><p>He possessed the Sun Divine Tree.</p><p>Could the esteemed Palace Master of Profound Sky Palace truly have only these few methods?</p><p>Looking back on his path of cultivation, Qin Sang had never been one to sit idly by and await death. Opportunities were always actively seized, which was why he had repeatedly turned danger into opportunity.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>Yin Changsheng repeated his previous tactic.</p><p>The Treading Snake opened its massive maw, its body once again merging with the frigid flames.</p><p>The frigid flames resembled a cold sun, radiating a ghostly glow. The underground cavern had completely transformed into an ice cave. If a low-level cultivator were to enter, they would likely be frozen to death instantly.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The frigid flames shot out.</p><p>They crashed down like meteors, their speed reaching the extreme.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grim. Although he could resolve the crisis time and again, he had only been able to protect himself so far. He couldn't find any opportunity to counterattack, akin to walking on the edge of a cliff. His mental energy was being consumed at an alarming rate.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword trembled, emitting a clear sword cry. Once again, it transformed into a sword formation, diligently guarding its master.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Brilliant streams of fire pierced through the dim sword formation, the surging momentum crushing countless sword threads.</p><p>Unsurprisingly.</p><p>The sword formation was pierced once more.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this. He tightened his arm slightly, carrying Liuli and shifting several dozen feet away. From the beginning of the battle, he had been circling the edge of the underground cavern, his mind always locked onto the blood pool. He was gradually making new discoveries.</p><p>The vital energy connected to the Slaughtering Yin Blood Pool seemed not to be Yin Changsheng himself, but the ice coffin!</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang landed, but before he could steady himself, he suddenly sensed something unusual above him, a premonition of danger rising in his heart.</p><p>In the air above them, cold mist swirled, and a white hand had appeared without his knowledge.</p><p>The hand's five fingers spread wide, like an eagle's claw, swiftly grasping at Liuli.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had predicted Qin Sang's landing position. The hand moved extremely fast, giving them no time to dodge further.</p><p>It was somewhat similar to the secret technique used by the cultivator surnamed Yue during the Body Cleansing Pool trial.</p><p>However, this white hand was smaller than Yue's, but it was more condensed. Both its speed and power were far beyond what Yue could achieve.</p><p>"Another top-tier secret technique!"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Profound Sky Palace surely possessed countless secret techniques. Yin Changsheng, the master of this sect, was truly not in his position for nothing. Top-tier secret techniques emerged one after another, and he could only struggle to cope.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The hand was as fast as lightning.</p><p>At this critical moment, a trace of determination flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>Then, a silver-white thread of lightning shot out from Qin Sang's Dantian, arriving first despite its later start, striking the center of the hand.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The hand froze, collapsing on the spot and disappearing at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were unharmed.</p><p>The seemingly delicate and weak thread of lightning had easily broken through this divine ability.</p><p>Qin Sang could no longer conceal it. He had to reveal another trump card, using the Heavenly Eye Divine Light to resolve the crisis. After the Heavenly Eye Butterfly's advancement, the Heavenly Eye Divine Light had also improved slightly, and his grasp of timing was more precise. Just now was the best opportunity.</p><p>In the midst of battle, such opportunities were rare, so it was not a waste.</p><p>However, for Qin Sang, this was not a good sign. Each trump card used was one less. The next time, Yin Changsheng would definitely be on guard, making it difficult to achieve the same effect.</p><p>The secret technique was inexplicably broken.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had not anticipated this situation at all. His expression froze.</p><p>His eyes stared straight at Qin Sang's Dantian. The Heavenly Eye Divine Light had appeared too suddenly; he hadn't clearly seen whether it was a magic treasure or something else.</p><p>For a moment, the underground cavern fell into a brief pause.</p><p>"Hah! Hah!"</p><p>Qin Sang carried Liuli and flashed to the other side, gasping for breath. He quickly stuffed several spirit pills into his mouth, a small measure of comfort.</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword silently flew back.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the ice coffin, his heart filled with vigilance. Yin Changsheng's sudden halt in the attack was abnormal; there must be a catch.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>"Very good!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's sinister voice came from inside the ice coffin.</p><p>Not only was it hoarse, but it carried an even stronger sense of madness, along with a clear tone of anger, making it extremely strange. He was already incredibly weary and enraged by Qin Sang's tireless resistance.</p><p>"I didn't expect that there would still be someone in this world who could force me to use my Suspended Sword Pavilion!"</p><p>Yin Changsheng's tone suddenly turned cold.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, a sense of foreboding rising in his heart. Tong Lingyu still didn't understand her own Palace Master well enough!</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The cold mist inside the ice coffin suddenly churned violently. Yin Changsheng's figure flickered in and out of view, as if he was standing up from within the ice coffin.</p><p>At the same time, a white light slowly rose from inside the ice coffin.</p><p>Within the white light was an extremely ornate, nine-story pavilion. It was Yin Changsheng's life-bound magic treasureâ€”the Suspended Sword Pavilion!</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion was crystal clear, as if carved from a single piece of profound ice. Every detail of its ornamentation was exquisitely crafted. All nine stories were hollow, without even walls, supported only by four pillars.</p><p>In the center of each story of the pavilion hung a sword.</p><p>The sword blades, like the Suspended Sword Pavilion, were also carved from profound ice, similar in size and shape. However, each sword was engraved with different patterns and characters, ancient scripts rarely recognized.</p><p>Nine stories, nine suspended swords.</p><p>The Suspended Sword Pavilion was thus named.</p><p>The moment he saw the Suspended Sword Pavilion, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He truly felt a threat to his life.</p><p>Another Spiritual Treasure?</p>
