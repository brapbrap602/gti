<h1>Chapter 1551: Death</h1><p>The heavily armored warrior possessed the bloodline of a Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle.</p><p>A phantom turtle emerged on the black armor on his back, surrounded by swirling black energy, like dark currents flowing ceaselessly around him.</p><p>This was a powerful ability of the armored warrior.  The seemingly thin currents were incredibly tough, infused with the power of turtle shell, comparable to ordinary protective artifacts.</p><p>Among the assembled demon kings, even the late-stage transformed Jiao Dragon King might not surpass the armored warrior in defense.</p><p>Yet in this place, the armored warrior dared not be careless, immediately using this powerful ability, proceeding cautiously through the spatial rifts.</p><p>The mountain was high, but spatial rifts and a fog resembling miasma filled the surroundings, limiting visibility.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, a vast swamp lay below, with shrubs surprisingly growing within it, though even the leaves were black.</p><p>Looking down, the swamp was unusually calm, devoid of monstrous beasts, yet emitting an even more sinister and oppressive atmosphere.</p><p>Compared to the swamp, the mountain felt somewhat better.</p><p>The entire mountain was a barren rock, offering an unobstructed view.</p><p>A collapsed ancient temple stood on the mountain, with only ruined walls and scattered rubble remaining. Besides this, two places pulsed with strange light, indicating the presence of ancient restrictions.</p><p>One was halfway up the mountain, conveniently located in their downhill direction, and the surrounding space seemed relatively stable.</p><p>The armored warrior deliberately approached the ancient restriction.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King frowned but didn't intervene.</p><p>To avoid the spatial rifts, they had to wind their way around, proceeding slowly and stopping frequently, taking a long time to reach the ancient restriction.</p><p>Just then, the armored warrior at the front suddenly changed expression and retreated hastily.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The armored warrior warned, his tone urgent.</p><p>The demon kings didn't know what had happened, but immediately retreated without hesitation.</p><p>“The strange light contained a spatial rift, probably torn open by a rift, the two intertwining and clashing. Had I been a moment later, I might have upset the balance…”</p><p>The armored warrior's face was pale.</p><p>The demon kings felt a chill hearing this. A restriction eruption or spatial tremor would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>“The humans didn’t dare to explore further, there must be a reason. We shouldn't act rashly.  Brother Hei, you’ve worked hard. I’ve recovered; I’ll take the lead from here.”</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King stepped forward.</p><p>Having learned their lesson, when approaching the ruined temple, the Jiao Dragon King deliberately avoided it. Finally, all the demon kings reached the foot of the mountain unharmed, albeit after a considerable amount of time.  It was a relatively smooth journey.</p><p>A stone path, clearly of artificial construction, was at the foot of the mountain, but submerged in the swamp, only a short section visible.</p><p>The swamp was deathly silent, filled with a foul odor.</p><p>The demon kings cautiously observed, finding no unusual signs. After a brief discussion, they proceeded according to their plan, taking turns to scout ahead.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>“No good!”</p><p>“Brother Lu, be careful, it's a top-tier monstrous beast!”</p><p>By this time, the demon kings had crossed most of the swamp, their journey smooth. Only once did they encounter a drifting spatial rift, a somewhat dangerous incident.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as they felt the swamp was safe, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The scout was a tall and slender demon king, whose original form was a deer demon. He broke through the bushes, just passing over a patch of mud when the mud beneath him suddenly exploded.</p><p>Mud splattered, and a foul stench filled the air.</p><p>A slender figure burst from the mud, fast as lightning, its gaping maw full of fangs, biting fiercely at the deer demon king—a monstrous beast resembling a giant serpent.</p><p>Before the beast's attack, they hadn't sensed anything unusual.</p><p>Under attack, the deer demon king remained calm, nine-colored light flashing as he instantly leaped several meters, narrowly avoiding the beast's jaws.</p><p>The beast roared, its slender body twisting suddenly, attacking again.</p><p>The deer demon king responded more easily, dodging with a sideways movement.</p><p>Support from the other demon kings arrived.</p><p>Phoenix shadow, green spear, turtle shell…</p><p>Several attacks converged, orderly and precise.</p><p>The beast was restrained by the phoenix shadow, and the turtle shell followed, smashing heavily onto the beast's head.</p><p>The beast, enraged by the pain, was then pierced through its gaping maw by the following green dragon spear, its fangs shattering, blood spurting. The beast was impaled, clearly near death.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the deer demon king suddenly cried out.</p><p>The mud quaked, splattering wildly, and instantly three identical beasts soared into the air, like three giant pillars, completely surrounding the deer demon king.</p><p>“There were three more! All top-tier monstrous beasts!”</p><p>The demon kings were shocked.</p><p>So many apex beasts were hidden in one place.</p><p>Three beasts, ignoring their dying companion, all targeted the Deer King, spewing blood-cloud-like breaths, and pounced simultaneously.</p><p>Fortunately, the Deer King was no ordinary being.  He remained vigilant, immediately summoning a treasure forged from his antlers, slicing through the blood clouds, and seizing an opening to dash through.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Deer King successfully broke through.</p><p>Strangely, the three beasts stopped, abandoning the chase.</p><p>Then, a horrifying sight unfolded.</p><p>An almost invisible silver light flashed from the Deer King's body. A diagonal crack appeared on his head, and he was split in two, his severed body continuing to fly forward.</p><p>The Deer King's eyes still moved, before finally losing their luster. He tumbled into the mud, lifeless.</p><p>"Spatial rift!"</p><p>the Jiao Dragon King exclaimed.</p><p>All the Kings felt a chilling dread. The Deer King, whose strength was mid-range among them, had died so easily.</p><p>They hadn't even found the True Dragon's bones yet, and already they had lost a member.</p><p>"Deer Brother!"</p><p>the Turtle-shelled Warrior's eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>These beasts weren't completely consumed by savagery; they were highly intelligent, aware of the hidden spatial rift and had set a trap, luring their prey into it.</p><p>The situation was urgent. The surrounding area was open; the Deer King hadn't anticipated a spatial rift and was completely unprepared.</p><p>'Gurgle gurgle...'</p><p>The mud bubbled, the stench of blood filled the air, the white brain matter and blood particularly striking.</p><p>"Don't be impulsive!"</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King restrained the enraged Turtle-shelled Warrior, his gaze sweeping across the scene.  He said gravely, "Something's not right, here…"</p><p>Mid-sentence, the fog in the depths suddenly erupted into chaos.</p><p>Several roars echoed around them, beasts drawn by the battle and blood. A powerful aura rapidly approached from behind, one even the Jiao Dragon King found daunting.</p><p>"No good! Run!"</p><p>The Kings' faces changed drastically; they dared not linger.</p><p>Returning the way they came was too far, so they pressed onward.</p><p>This swamp alone harbored so many top-tier beasts!</p><p>Only now did they truly grasp the danger of the Inner Palace. No wonder the humans, occupying the Seven Kills Hall for so many years, had explored so little.</p><p>The Kings used their various abilities, consecutively slaying several apex beasts, finally breaking free from the swamp before being surrounded.  Looking at each other, all were battered and weary, forcing out a wry smile.</p>
