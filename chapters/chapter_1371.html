<h1>Chapter 1363: Double Happiness</h1><p>The cave dwelling was quiet.  During Qin Sang's lectures at Qingyang Temple, he had been systematically refining his own Daoist path, making ample preparations for this seclusion!</p><p>Qin Sang was single-minded, focused on cultivation. While refining medicinal power, he would pause periodically to experience his soul shadow.  The Corpse Flower Amber and the Nascent Soul puppet complemented each other perfectly. Even when encountering bottlenecks, he wasn't significantly hampered.</p><p>Qin Sang's progress was rapid.</p><p>Thirty-five years passed in a flash.  The Northern Star Realm's cultivation world enjoyed an unusually long period of stability. Xiaohan Region, Tianyao Hill, Tianxing Alliance, the Abyss, and the Desert all recognized the Northern Star Alliance.  Even minor conflicts between factions were easily resolved through the Northern Star Alliance's mediation.</p><p>The most important reason was that many Nascent Soul cultivators had witnessed ascension firsthand. Their sights were no longer limited to their small corner of the Northern Star Realm; their gaze extended beyond the storm, towards a wider world!</p><p>Compared to this, their past ambitions and conflicts of interest seemed laughably insignificant.</p><p>The key to ascension lay in the Ascension Platform! All the Nascent Soul masters were busy. Some, like Qin Sang, were immersed in cultivation. After all, even finding the Ascension Platform would be futile without sufficient cultivation.</p><p>Some believed that unforeseen circumstances couldn't be ignored. Finding the Ascension Platform might offer even more advantageous conditions than the Ziwei Palace ascension; the requirements for the cultivator's level might be lower.</p><p>They jointly explored the realm's forbidden areas and secret realms, unearthed ancient texts from their sect's archives, and studied notes left by their predecessors, along with widely circulated legends.  They tirelessly verified even the most tenuous leads.</p><p>In this process, truly hidden secret realms were discovered, yielding significant gains for the cultivators who explored them. Unfortunately, none were related to an Ascension Platform.</p><p>The most noteworthy were the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and the Abyssal Ruins.  Grandmaster Cang Hong led people in exploring the Abyssal Ruins for decades.  Whether they were concealing something or had truly found nothing, the news they released was disappointing.</p><p>The Ancient Immortal Battlefield was paramount.  It was discussed at every Northern Star Alliance meeting.  From time to time, several Nascent Soul cultivators would venture deep into the battlefield together.  Qin Sang received several invitations, all of which were politely declined by Jingyu and Li Yu Fu.</p><p>The spiritual tide continued unabated, with new secret realms occasionally emerging, but none compared to the Ziwei Palace.  However, they did manage some gains, and even without finding the Ascension Platform, they wouldn't return empty-handed.</p><p>After the grand opening ceremony of the sect.</p><p>Though Qin Sang remained low-key, his status and that of Qingyang Temple had increased.  Shaohua Mountain and Shangyuan Quiet Palace followed Qin Sang’s lead, supporting Qingyang Temple.  The entire northern bank of Yun Cang Great Marsh had practically become Qingyang Temple's territory.</p><p>Ironically, Qingyang Temple's closest ally was the Xuling Sect. Jiang Xue frequently visited with the Han family head, demonstrating their close relationship.  The Taiyi Dan Sect and the Chi Tan Sect were hesitant to pressure them further, allowing Jiang Xue to consolidate his position.</p><p>Tianyao Hill, with its Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea, was closely allied with Qingyang Temple.  The Demon Dao proactively sought friendly relations. Among the independent cultivators, due to Qing Jun's relationship, the Yin Mountain Pass City Lord personally attended the ceremony and expressed goodwill towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang's prestige within the Tianxing Alliance was unquestionable.  The Yuan Shen Gate had relocated to the Tianxing Plateau and thrived.  No one dared to encroach on their interests in the grasslands.</p><p>In the desert, Qin Sang had saved Lu Boyuan's life.  Only relations with the Abyss were strained.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Qingyang Temple were now a formidable force in the Northern Star Realm, holding immense influence!</p><p>Tan Yi'en, appointed as the head administrator, dedicated himself entirely to the sect. Shangguan Lifeng, Li Yu Fu, Mei Gu, and other key disciples diligently cultivated, each making significant progress.</p><p>Qingyang Temple flourished.  Within just a few decades, it had established itself as a major sect.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang remained unconcerned by all this.</p><p>For thirty-five years, he had not left Peach Blossom Valley, not even appearing when Nascent Soul peers visited. Only Li Yu Fu and Jingyu had each entered once during this time.</p><p>That evening.</p><p>Peach Blossom Valley, unusually, opened its protective formations.</p><p>Before Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Tan Yi'en seemed to be in a great hurry.  As the renowned head administrator of Qingyang Temple, Tan Yi'en possessed an easy composure, capable of remaining unfazed even before Nascent Soul masters. Yet now he was restless, pacing back and forth.</p><p>He repeatedly glanced at Peach Blossom Valley, his expression anxious, but dared not enter without Qin Sang's permission.</p><p>A white cat stood before Tan Yi'en, head slightly tilted, its eyes alert.  It was afraid that Tan Yi'en might, in his excitement, disturb its master.</p><p>"How much longer will Master be in seclusion?"</p><p>Tan Yi'en had already asked several times.</p><p>The white cat gave the same answer, with a delicate snort: "Six months ago, Master ordered that nothing should disturb him."</p><p>“Even if the sky falls, you can't go in!”</p><p>Tan Yi'en's face fell.  "This was a direct order from Master…"</p><p>But seeing the cat's unwavering stance, Tan Yi'en gave up, sighing and sitting down cross-legged on a rock.</p><p>The white cat remained at the valley entrance.</p><p>Two months passed in a blink.</p><p>A ripple suddenly disturbed the mist of Peach Blossom Valley, and a figure emerged – Qin Sang!</p><p>Qin Sang, still in his Daoist robe, appeared calm and serene.</p><p>"Master…"</p><p>The white cat was the first to spot Qin Sang, leaping up and pointing at Tan Yi'en,  "He…"</p><p>"I know."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, looking at Tan Yi'en who hastily rose to pay his respects.  "What happened outside to cause such alarm?"</p><p>Tan Yi'en sensed Qin Sang's displeasure.  His heart pounded; he regretted his years of cultivating composure. Taking a deep breath, he said,  "Master Uncle, Senior Brother Li and the others were traveling in the desert. After years of searching, they've finally made a discovery! They sent a message not long ago – it concerns my father!"</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>A faint smile played on Qin Sang's lips. "Unexpectedly, double the good news. Where is Li Yu Fu?"</p><p>He had sent Li Yu Fu and the others to the desert to search for the Diamond Fruit, never expecting this unexpected find – Tan Hao first.</p><p>Qin Sang was very curious about Tan Hao and the mysterious person's activities.  He had asked Lu Boyuan to keep an eye out, but nothing similar had been discovered.</p><p>Tan Yi'en quickly produced a message talisman, respectfully saying, "It is said that Mei Gu was the first to discover the clues. Senior Brother Li was on the Skywalk Plateau at the time and rushed over immediately after receiving the news."</p><p>Qin Sang took the talisman and scanned it with his spiritual sense, somewhat surprised.</p><p>The place where Mei Gu discovered the clues was at the southernmost tip of the Northern Star Desert, the southernmost point of the Northern Star region – an island in the sea!</p><p>She suspected that Tan Hao had been there.</p><p>But Qin Sang had previously instructed caution, so Mei Gu dared not investigate further. Upon discovering the trace, she immediately sent a message back, seeking Qin Sang's decision.</p><p>"There?!"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment. "Let's return to the sect and take a look."</p><p>With that, he vanished in a flash, flying ahead.</p><p>Tan Yi'en recovered, about to follow, suddenly remembered Qin Sang's earlier words, showing a puzzled expression.  "Double the good news? What other good news?"</p><p>Before he could finish…</p><p>Tan Yi'en's face froze. He exchanged a look with the white cat, both faces alight with ecstatic joy, their eyes filled with fervor and reverence.</p>
