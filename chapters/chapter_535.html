<h1>Chapter 528: Using Another's Hand to Kill</h1><p>Two figures approached. Qin Sang sensed their low cultivation and knew he could escape using the ebony sword.  However, this was the crucial moment of his Dan breakthrough. Using the sword would be too draining, potentially disrupting the three forces and ruining everything.</p><p>Countless thoughts raced through his mind.  He wasn't foolish enough to still be unaware that the strange phenomenon stemmed from the Qingyang Gangying he possessed.  There were definitely secrets hidden on Shen Gang Peak that he didn't know!  Such a violent ancestral sacred fire, constrained atop Shen Gang Peak, was likely related to these jade-like Qingyang Gangying.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the thread-like stream of fire slowly drifting towards him.  After his initial shock, he calmed down, realizing it wasn't the main body of the ancestral sacred fire but merely some escaping energy, a manifestation of its power. The formation sealing the ancestral sacred fire wasn't easily damaged; the main body remained firmly bound to the peak.</p><p>That was good.  While still powerful, it offered a degree of maneuverability!  An idea struck him. He made a decision, pressed his palm to the ground, and grabbed the remaining Qingyang Gangying.</p><p>Only a small piece remained, which shattered with a crisp sound when he gripped it.  Threads of incredibly dense Gang Qi surged from his fingertips and were rapidly absorbed.</p><p>The two Qingyang Demon Sect disciples heard the sound of the Gangying shattering and their faces changed.</p><p>"Impudent!"</p><p>"How dare you!"</p><p>Furious, they charged, only to see a person, back to them in a crevice, ignoring their warnings and continuing to absorb the Gangying.  Even without seeing their face, they knew this wasn't one of their sect members.  Someone was stealing Qingyang Gangying!</p><p>"Who are you?" they demanded, shocked. They never expected an outsider to infiltrate the sacred Shen Gang Peak! If not for the destruction of the Gangying and the resulting phenomenon, the entire sect would remain oblivious.</p><p>But the person seemed to ignore them, continuing to absorb the Qingyang Shen Gang. The Gang Qi around their fingers thickened.</p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p>They roared, exchanged a look, and unleashed their Qingyang Demon Fire. Two streams of fire transformed into spears, like two azure dragons, stabbing towards Qin Sang's back.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The spears were incredibly fast.  Qin Sang was completely undefended.  Just as they were about to pierce him, he moved.</p><p>The crevice was in a massive black stone, split in two but not fallen apart, creating a winding passage wide enough for three people. The Qingyang Gangying was embedded in the ground within.</p><p>Before absorbing all the Gang Qi, Qin Sang, holding the fragment, sprang forward, maintaining a seated position, his body like a frog, *whooshing* ahead, even faster than the spears.</p><p>He easily evaded the spears, disappearing into the depths of the crevice.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>The two pursued relentlessly.  However, as they passed Qin Sang's former position, they heard a piercing sword cry and saw a flash of sword light from the crevice's depths.</p><p>The sword light struck, reaching them instantly.</p><p>The disciples were terrified.</p><p>"A magic weapon!"</p><p>They panicked, throwing their Qingyang Demon Fire to block the sword, then retreated.  They hadn’t sensed any overwhelmingly powerful aura from Qin Sang.  They never expected he could wield a magic weapon.  With their cultivation, they wouldn't dare to clash directly with one.</p><p>Then, they saw something astonishing.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The flying sword collided with their Qingyang Demon Fire.  With a *clang*, the flying sword was struck back, defenseless, falling to the ground before rising again, wobbly, and flying back.</p><p>They thought their eyes were deceiving them.  Then they realized the flying sword was a weakling, all show and no substance!</p><p>Only the material of the flying sword lived up to the reputation of a magic weapon; its body remained unscathed after enduring two blasts of the Green Sun Devilfire.</p><p>Seeing this, their faces flickered between green and white in furious frustration.</p><p>Suddenly, they sensed something amiss.  They quickly looked up, their expressions freezing.</p><p>The vortex of wind and clouds above was rapidly descending. Their current location, directly beneath the spot where the jade had been, was now in the vortex's path, with its center aimed directly at them!</p><p>The fiery torrent from the vortex's depths had dissipated at some point.</p><p>The vortex was filled with intense green light, fluctuating wildly along with the chaotic wind, clouds, and lightning.  It looked like dancing green flames.</p><p>The green light and the vortex descended with terrifying power, instantly tearing and pulverizing the black rocks on either side of the crevice.</p><p>In an instant, terrifying pressure bore down on them.  Their bodies tensed, and they found themselves trapped, unable to move.</p><p>“No good!  Quickly raise the Fire Banner!” one of them shouted urgently.</p><p>The other, jolted awake, hastily pulled a man-high triangular green banner from his pouch. They planted it between them and, working together, poured their remaining Green Sun Devilfire into it.</p><p>The banner depicted flame-like patterns, and as the real Green Sun Devilfire infused it, the painted flames came to life.</p><p>At this point, they no longer cared about Qin Sang; saving their own lives was paramount.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The banner blazed, suddenly unleashing a fiery shield that enveloped them.</p><p>The green light descended, instantly obliterating the surrounding terrain; its power was evident.</p><p>Only a massive, constantly rotating vortex remained, swirling debris of all sizes. The scene was chaotic, making it impossible to see what lay at the vortex's center.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of the wind and cloud vortex.</p><p>The aftereffects of the Ancestor Saint Flame, manifested as green light, had caused such devastation!</p><p>Qin Sang was now certain that the Ancestor Saint Flame and the Green Sun Devilfire were of the same origin.  Those two had saved their lives with the Fire Banner.</p><p>Qin Sang did not possess Green Sun Devilfire, so couldn't force their way through the green light. Otherwise, provoking the Ancestor Saint Flame would backfire.</p><p>However, as long as the green light persisted, they wouldn’t be able to escape or send a message.</p>
