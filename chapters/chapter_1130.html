<h1>Chapter 1122: The Elixir is Complete </h1><p>---</p><p>Time passed, though no one knew how long.</p><p>Suddenly, the cave abode opened.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he quickly stepped forward.</p><p>He saw Li Yufu walking out of the cave, his eyes bloodshot and his expression dazed. In his hands, he held three items.</p><p>One was a jade slip.</p><p>Another was a jade vial containing a spirit pill the size of a longan fruit.</p><p>The pill was pure white, as pristine as the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid.</p><p>A wisp of spiritual mist perpetually swirled around the pill.</p><p>It was none other than the Calamity Transcendence Pill!</p><p>Additionally, there was a charred piece of wood, blackened throughout and about the thickness of a finger.</p><p>"Uncle-Master," Li Yufu said, his eyes regaining a faint glimmer of life as he saw Qin Sang. His voice was wooden as he spoke, "These are all left for you by our Grandmaster."</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, struggling to speak. "Your Grandmaster, he…"</p><p>Li Yufu nodded, tears welling up in his tiger-like eyes, his voice filled with profound grief. "Grandmaster failed his tribulation. When his Nascent Soul was on the verge of dispersing, he used the Emperor's Nectar to cling to a last breath, refining the Calamity Transcendence Pill before… before…"</p><p>Though Qin Sang had introduced him to the Immortal Sect, it was Grandmaster Wandering Cloud who had guided him from the Qi Refining stage to the Core Formation stage. Even his alchemy skills had been honed under Wandering Cloud's unreserved tutelage, allowing him to reach where he was today.</p><p>To Li Yufu, Wandering Cloud was family.</p><p>Now, his family had fallen, separated by the boundary of life and death. How could he not grieve?</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang closed his eyes and let out a long sigh toward the heavens.</p><p>No wonder he had sensed something strange about Wandering Cloud's aura.</p><p>Having failed his tribulation, Wandering Cloud should have perished, body and soul. Yet, he had consumed the Emperor's Nectar and used some unknown method to prolong his life, persisting just long enough to refine the Calamity Transcendence Pill for him.</p><p>"What virtue or ability do I possess…" Qin Sang murmured, his eyes hollow.</p><p>After a long while, Qin Sang finally regained his composure.</p><p>He took the three items from Li Yufu's hands, knowing that the jade slip likely contained Wandering Cloud's final words to him. Without delay, he activated his divine sense and probed into the jade slip.</p><p>This jade slip was different from others; it wasn't merely a recording.</p><p>As his divine sense entered the slip, it felt as though he had stepped into an unknown space.</p><p>Within this space, a figure stood with its back to him.</p><p>Dressed in Daoist robes, with white hair and beard, exuding an immortal aura—it was Wandering Cloud.</p><p>"Senior?" Qin Sang tentatively called out.</p><p>Wandering Cloud turned around, his figure slightly translucent.</p><p>"Brother Qin!" Wandering Cloud smiled, though a trace of melancholy flickered in his eyes. He sighed, "Seeing you here means my true self has failed the tribulation."</p><p>"Are you a thought sealed within this jade slip by a restriction, Senior?" Qin Sang asked in surprise.</p><p>Wandering Cloud nodded. "You must have many questions, Brother Qin. I exist to answer them. Once I finish, it will be time for me to dissipate. Allow me to clarify everything for you. Additionally, there is one last matter I must entrust to you."</p><p>"Senior, please speak. This junior will spare no effort!" Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>Wandering Cloud had failed his tribulation, yet he had not forgotten his promise to refine the Calamity Transcendence Pill for Qin Sang. Such a great kindness left Qin Sang with no way to repay him.</p><p>How could he refuse any request Wandering Cloud had?</p><p>"I know you are a man of honor, Brother Qin, true to your word. During the years you were missing, I sought out several others to entrust with this matter, but none compared to you. Seeing you safe and sound brings me immense joy…" Wandering Cloud said with a look of deep satisfaction.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang couldn't help but ask, "Did you have a premonition about this tribulation, Senior?"</p><p>"Do you remember what I once told you? In my life, I faced two great calamities. Due to the disharmony in my soul, with your help, I obtained the Three Lights Jade Liquid and the Green Copper Fragment, and I threw myself into the demonic flames. That was the first calamity. The second calamity was this Nascent Soul tribulation…" Wandering Cloud paused, then sighed. "Its origin is tied to my true nature."</p><p>"Your true nature?" Qin Sang's heart stirred as he recalled the Emperor's Nectar. He focused intently, eager to hear more.</p><p>"I was originally a spirit bamboo from the Hanging Garden Palace of the Purple Star Palace, which gained sentience and achieved enlightenment. At the time of my emergence, I encountered cultivators and great demons hunting me. I narrowly escaped and thereafter concealed my true origins, cultivating in the Thousand Bamboo Seas of the demon realm…" Wandering Cloud recounted his past experiences.</p><p>The Hanging Garden Palace, spirit bamboo, Thousand Bamboo Seas…</p><p>A flash of realization struck Qin Sang, and he was utterly shocked. "Senior, could it be that you are…"</p><p>"Indeed, the Cold Domain has seen three occasions where the Ten Divine Trees emerged. One of them was the Pure Fortune Bamboo. The Pure Fortune Bamboo gained sentience and, after emerging, managed to escape right under the noses of Nascent Soul cultivators and great demons. That was me!" Wandering Cloud's eyes gleamed with a hint of pride.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely stunned.</p><p>Wandering Cloud's true form was the Pure Fortune Bamboo!</p><p>He had imagined countless possibilities, but he had never expected that Wandering Cloud was a spirit bamboo that had achieved enlightenment—and not just any spirit bamboo, but one of the Ten Divine Trees, the Pure Fortune Bamboo!</p><p>"But that can't be, Senior. You clearly have a human form?" Qin Sang asked, his face filled with confusion.</p><p>He had interacted with Wandering Cloud for so long, from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to the Boundless Valley, and even to the Purple Star Palace. They had faced numerous dangers together. If Wandering Cloud had been a demonic being, it would have been impossible for him to hide it so perfectly, without Qin Sang ever noticing.</p><p>Wandering Cloud's smile faded as he sighed softly. "I was indeed a spirit bamboo, but by a twist of fate, I took on a human form."</p><p>"Back then, I was severely injured and was recuperating near the Great Sui Dynasty. To make matters worse, before my injuries could heal, a heavenly tribulation descended. I was forced to find a desolate mountain to undergo the tribulation.</p><p>"During the tribulation, a wandering Daoist named Wandering Cloud happened to pass by, gathering herbs in the mountains. Seeing the strange celestial phenomena, he thought an immortal had descended and rushed over, seeking immortality. Before he could get close, he was struck unconscious by the tribulation lightning.</p><p>"At the moment his soul was about to dissipate, I also failed my tribulation. My true form was destroyed by the heavenly lightning, and my soul was on the verge of scattering.</p><p>"In that hazy state, a wisp of my remnant soul accidentally entered his body.</p><p>"Whether it was due to the lingering power of the tribulation lightning disrupting the Heavenly Dao or some other reason, our two remnant souls merged, giving us a new lease on life.</p><p>"However, all my divine abilities and treasures were destroyed, and I was left without a trace of true essence, becoming a seventy-year-old mortal. Moreover, my soul was left with lingering flaws.</p><p>"From that point on, even to this day, I cannot say for certain whether I am the Pure Fortune Bamboo or Wandering Cloud.</p><p>"Perhaps due to my previous cultivation, the consciousness of the spirit bamboo predominated.</p><p>"Since I now had a human form, I took on the name Wandering Cloud, and thus our paths crossed. It was truly the will of Heaven.</p><p>"At the time, I was old and frail, and the remnant soul of the spirit bamboo offered no assistance. I had only a few years left to live. But I did not want to fade into obscurity as a mortal. Fortunately, my memories remained intact, and I had once done a favor for Piao Ya of the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect. The Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect excelled in alchemy, making it the most suitable place for me. Perhaps there was a slim chance for me to re-enter the path of immortality.</p><p>"Thus, under the identity of Wandering Cloud, I joined the Supreme Unity Alchemy Sect, becoming Piao Ya's alchemy apprentice…</p><p>"As I cultivated, I gradually realized that the forced fusion of the two souls had left a rift in my spirit. The two consciousnesses were still at odds, not fully integrated, which posed a significant obstacle to my cultivation. From then on, I began searching for a solution."</p><p>Wandering Cloud slowly unveiled this secret chapter of his past.</p><p>He paused briefly, then continued, "The true resolution of this flaw was partly due to those rare treasures, but it was also inspired by you, Brother Qin."</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>Feeling like stopping at the previous chapter would earn me some angry letters, I decided to write this additional chapter. Sorry for the long delay in repaying the debt to the big boss. Even with overtime, I managed to write it out.</p><p>So tired.</p><p>Time for breakfast.</p><p>Please vote.</p>
