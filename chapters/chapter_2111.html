<h1>Chapter 2101: Setting the Record Straight</h1><p>Chapter 2102: Setting the Record Straight</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Within the temple, green mountains resembled dark brows, rivers flowed like silk ribbons, the whole scene resembling a blessed land of immortals, with no trace of the devastation that had once befallen it.</p><p>On this day, the mountain gates were flung wide open. Auspicious clouds resembled brocade, and guests filled the temple grounds.</p><p>Chanting drifted in from the west.  In the distance, a group of monks could be seen, treading upon the void itself. Some wore patched robes, their bodies thin and their faces sallow, clearly ascetic monks.  The rest were also weathered and bore the marks of hardship, clearly no ordinary monks.</p><p>They journeyed not by flying ships but on foot, yet their speed was not slow. With each stride, they crossed several mountain peaks, arriving at the mountain gates in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Soon, the sound of bells and chimes echoed from within Qingyang Temple. Li Yufu, the Temple Master, unexpectedly emerged to personally greet them.</p><p>With a flick of his horsetail whisk, Li Yufu bowed in greeting.  “This humble Daoist greets Sage Huaiyin and all the honored monks.”</p><p>This group of monks had indeed come from the Western Lands, led by Sage Huaiyin.</p><p>"Greetings, Temple Master Li."</p><p>Sage Huaiyin and the monks returned the greeting, their expressions varying as they gazed upon Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Over a month had passed since the North Sea conflict. The Changyou Clan had suffered a crushing defeat that day, fleeing in disarray and leaving behind countless corpses, including many first-stage Void Realm experts and Changyou elders. The North Sea had achieved a decisive victory.</p><p>At the same time, the Changyou armies stationed in the Western Wilderness and patrolling the Southern Sea had also retreated in panic. Since then, not a single Changyou soldier remained near the Central Continent.</p><p>After multiple reconnaissance missions, the Western Wilderness finally dared to confirm that the formidable enemy that had threatened the Central Continent for centuries had completely withdrawn!</p><p>Just as various factions were reeling in astonishment, a rumor began to spread: Patriarch Qin Zhenjun of Qingyang Temple had returned, not only having survived but also having greatly advanced his cultivation, now a Void Refinement expert.</p><p>Another piece of news, far more chilling and alarming, spread alongside it: the Changyou Clan Leader had broken through to the second stage of the Void Realm and had begun massacring demon cultivators in the Canglang Sea. Fortunately, Qin Zhenjun had arrived in time to force the Changyou Clan Leader to retreat; otherwise, the demon army might have been completely annihilated.</p><p>As for why the demons of the Demon Sea had appeared in the Canglang Sea at that time, it also sparked much discussion, but compared to the previous two rumors, it attracted less attention.</p><p>With the situation in turmoil and rumors swirling, no one could determine what was true and what was false. Qingyang Temple subsequently announced its closure, and the Northern Sea's Xuantian Palace and other factions remained silent.</p><p>While everyone was apprehensive, some time ago, every influential faction in the Storm Realm received an invitation from Qingyang Temple, announcing the temple's re-establishment and the holding of a grand ceremony to worship heaven and earth and inform their ancestors, inviting fellow Daoists from all sides to attend.</p><p>The key lay in this invitation, which bore not only Li Yufu's Temple Master seal but also a faint aura.</p><p>Sensing this aura, those powerful overlords were filled with trepidation.</p><p>The Western Lands Buddhist Sect also received the invitation. With the external enemy retreated, the pressure on the Western Lands was greatly reduced. As a sign of respect, Sage Huaiyin and the eminent monks of various temples came to attend the ceremony.</p><p>For reasons unknown, they didn't use the Teleportation Formation to reach the Central Continent, but instead physically traversed the continent, arriving later than the Northern Sea factions, covered in the dust of their journey.</p><p>At this moment, Qingyang Temple was filled with distinguished guests. The Western Lands monks were among the last to arrive.</p><p>"We apologize for our late arrival. We hope we haven't disrupted the ceremony," Sage Huaiyin said apologetically.</p><p>"Honored Monk, you are too kind. The ceremony has not yet begun. Please, come in!"</p><p>Li Yufu gestured invitingly and led the monks into Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Immortal mist swirled, and rosy clouds billowed, creating a scene resembling a縹緲 fairyland.  While the monks admired the scenery, what truly captured their attention was Qingyang Temple's protective formation.</p><p>They secretly probed it, finding it unfathomable. The profoundness of the formation exceeded their expectations, and they couldn't help but feel a sense of awe.</p><p>The monks entered the mountain gates and walked among the clouds. They were surprised to discover that with each step, a lotus flower bloomed beneath their feet, delicate and vibrant.</p><p>The lotus flowers were real, as a closer look would reveal.  White filaments, the tendrils of some kind of spiritual plant, were distributed throughout the cloud qi.</p><p>This plant was called the One-Breath Lotus, a rare spiritual plant gifted to Qingyang Temple by Ji Hong.  As its name suggested, the lotus bloomed for a single breath before wilting, but in that short span, it brought forth the most beautiful sight, and over time, it also improved the spiritual veins.</p><p>As the monks walked, lotuses bloomed with each step. Even those who had witnessed this wondrous sight before couldn't help but marvel, bowing to the monks in greeting.</p><p>Ji Hong's gifts weren't limited to the One-Breath Lotus.  At this grand ceremony, there were no Daoist boys or servant girls. The peaks were adorned with beautiful flowers. Whenever the cups on the jade tables emptied, flower buds resembling ox horns would immediately bloom, pouring forth nectar-like jade liquid.</p><p>These spiritual flowers were called Burning Wine Flowers, with a single purpose: to enhance the quality of wine. Their roots, when immersed in wine, could transform even ordinary wine into a superior brew.</p><p>Ji Hong had presented several similar spiritual plants as congratulatory gifts, adding significantly to the grandeur of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>"Honored Monks, please be seated."</p><p>Li Yufu settled the Western Lands monks and glanced over the peaks, seeing that almost everyone had arrived. He then summoned clouds beneath his feet and flew toward the main peak.</p><p>Everyone noticed his action, and the murmur of conversation immediately subsided.</p><p>Not long after, a bell tolled, silencing the last vestiges of sound.  The entire Qingyang Temple fell silent, only the lingering echoes of the bell remaining.</p><p>The precious bell tolled nine times, and the doors of the main hall swung open with a resounding boom.</p><p>Li Yufu, holding his horsetail whisk and dressed in immortal robes and a ceremonial帔, walked out of the hall under the watchful gaze of the crowd. He stood before the hall and announced the commencement of the ceremony.  He declared that henceforth, this would be the main hall of Qingyang Temple, and today, they would open the altar to worship heaven and earth and inform their ancestors.</p><p>Finally, Li Yufu flicked his whisk.  The main peak trembled slightly, emitting a brilliant golden light, and an altar rose from the summit.</p><p>However, he didn't personally conduct the worship. Instead, he looked up at the sky with reverence.  Seeing his actions, everyone realized something and held their breath.</p><p>A moment later, a long cry resonated, and a stream of fire descended from the heavens!</p><p>The sound was clear and resonant, followed by an immense aura that shook everyone's hearts.  They gazed intently and saw that the stream of fire was actually a magnificent firebird.</p><p>It resembled a phoenix reborn from fire, yet it was purer, as if it were the master of all celestial flames.</p><p>Such a divine bird, however, was merely a mount. On its back sat a figure with an otherworldly demeanor.</p><p>"Greetings, Martial Uncle!"</p><p>Li Yufu knelt and cried out.</p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor!"</p><p>The disciples of Qingyang Temple followed suit, their faces filled with fervent adoration.</p><p>As Qin Sang rode the divine bird, a disharmonious voice rang in his ears.  "This Vermillion Bird is a divine beast, inherently noble, not a mount!"</p><p>"I'm merely borrowing your majestic presence. Other spirit beasts can't compare to the Vermillion Bird bloodline, they don't have this kind of effect," Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>These words pleased the Vermillion Bird somewhat, and it grumbled, "You'd better hatch that stupid Qilin soon! And don't forget your promise to help me with my tribulation!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.  The Vermillion Bird had been in seclusion refining the Qilin Source Seed essence, making remarkable progress.  Presumably, it wouldn't be long before he had another powerful ally by his side.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The Vermillion Bird descended from the sky, coordinating with Qin Sang to create a dramatic entrance.  It landed before the altar, prostrating itself so Qin Sang could dismount.</p><p>Standing on the altar, Qin Sang looked at the memorial tablets placed there, a myriad of emotions swirling within him.</p><p>These were the tablets of past Qingyang Temple ancestors, not for worshipping the deceased.  His name was also among them.</p><p>At the very top was naturally Yun Youzi, followed by Daoist Jixin. Beside them stood a separate tablet for Senior Qingzhu. Qin Sang only needed to pay respects to these three predecessors.</p><p>Holding incense sticks, Qin Sang performed each ritual with a solemn and meticulous demeanor.  He first worshipped heaven and earth, then each ancestor in turn.</p><p>After the ceremony, Qin Sang slowly turned, his gaze sweeping over Li Yufu and the Qingyang Temple disciples.</p><p>Unknowingly, Qingyang Temple had grown from a dilapidated Daoist temple on Cuiping Mountain to its current stature, holding a place of significance in the Great Thousand World.</p><p>Li Yufu, Shen Chen, and the others were like seeds he had sown, without careful nurturing.</p><p>Qin Sang was arguably one of the most irresponsible ancestors, embarking on the path of the Great Vehicle due to the compulsion of his cultivation method. Yet, so many people had gathered around him.  They revered him as their ancestor, offering him their unwavering respect, adoration, and trust, viewing him as their role model and reliance, his most steadfast supporters.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, anyone would be moved, let alone those who had truly embarked on the path of the Great Vehicle.</p><p>So many attachments, could they sever them? Could they bear to sever them?  But if they didn't, how could they pursue the Immortal Dao, seek transcendence?</p><p>This was Qin Sang's greatest perplexity regarding the Great Vehicle.</p><p>His gaze shifted outwards, towards the guests, who had already risen from their seats.</p><p>"Greetings, Qin Zhenjun!"</p><p>Someone called out first.</p><p>The next moment, the greetings surged like a tidal wave.  Everyone, regardless of their thoughts, bowed deeply.</p><p>"Greetings, Qin Zhenjun!"</p><p>Humans, demons, witches, the three races; Daoists, Buddhists, demons, rogue cultivators; various sects and schools, aristocratic families – they represented the entire Storm Realm, bowing before Qin Sang!</p><p>"Greetings to all fellow Daoists."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, chuckling. "In the Great Thousand World, within the human Daoist sects, Zhenjun is a title reserved for those of the Integration Stage.  Others are addressed as Zhenren.  Someone like myself at most deserves a 'Great' before Zhenren. This greeting is truly undeserved."</p><p>These words left everyone speechless.</p><p>Daoist Hegao and other high-ranking Daoists were embarrassed.  If Qin Sang didn't dare claim the title of Zhenjun, what were they?</p><p>Others also appeared awkward. Titles like Buddhist Sage and Demon Saint King were equivalent to Zhenjun. Since Zhenjun was presumptuous, they certainly wouldn't dare use their titles anymore.</p><p>At the same time, some astute individuals gleaned key information from these words.  This Qin Zhenjun had indeed returned from the outside, having traveled the Great Thousand World and interacted with human Daoists.</p><p>Qin Sang set the record straight with a single sentence, ignoring their thoughts, and continued, "This humble Daoist was pursued and nearly killed years ago, narrowly escaping with my life and ascending to the Great Thousand World. I thought I would never return to the lower realm.  Unexpectedly, fate is fickle. I met Gu Ya by chance and learned that the Storm Realm had ascended as a whole..."</p><p>He didn't need to explain anything to them, simply outlining the events.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked towards a peak in the north. Some recognized Gu Ya and knew she had been swept away by the Mist Waterfall years ago. They hadn't expected her not only to survive but also to encounter Qin Zhenjun.</p><p>Learning this, some cultivators who also had relatives swept away by the Mist Waterfall became agitated. Their loved ones might still be alive, a silver lining in the midst of misfortune.</p><p>"Learning that the Storm Realm had experienced such calamities, and that all fellow Daoists, including those who tragically perished, were able to set aside past grievances, work together to assist Fairy Liu Li in resisting the foreign enemy, and overcome countless difficulties with painstaking efforts, writing a moving epic with blood and tears, gradually gaining the strength to confront the enemy, this warms my heart!  Back then, while searching for a way to counter the Heavenly Dao's Demonic Sound, I had considered uniting the strength of all, and in fact, this has proven to be correct."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone carried sincere appreciation, acknowledging everyone's efforts.  The atmosphere immediately lightened, and everyone wore relaxed smiles.</p><p>"However..."</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's expression changed, his tone turning cold.  "But upon my return, what I saw was a series of heartbreaking scenes!  During the North Sea crisis, while Fairy Liu Li was severely injured and recovering, some colluded with the enemy, some abandoned their neighbors, some harbored ulterior motives, some exploited the situation..."</p><p>Each sentence was like a sharp, icy wind, sweeping across the peaks, piercing everyone's hearts and bones!</p>
