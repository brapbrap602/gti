<h1>Chapter 2029:  Difficult Situation</h1><p>Who would have thought that, after waiting so long,  Pei Gongfeng would lose his patience and act out here?</p><p>Third Elder's eyes were bloodshot, his gaze burning with hatred toward Pei Gongfeng.  After a furious roar, the pupils in the illusory eyes behind him suddenly dilated.</p><p>His pupils almost filled his entire eyes, turning them black and radiating an eerie glow.  Wherever his gaze fell,  dark specks suddenly appeared in the mist.</p><p>These dark specks, initially tiny, rapidly expanded, writhing in the void like countless maggots.  These "maggots" even consumed the surrounding mist,  a dark mass hurtling toward Pei Gongfeng.</p><p>Third Elder aimed to attack Pei Gongfeng's physical form while he was dealing with Mingling.</p><p>The maggots swarmed, and Pei Gongfeng's Yuan Yang Wuji Formation seemed unable to stop them. They easily pierced the thick fog and reached Pei Gongfeng.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng's face showed surprise, not because of the maggots' power, but because Third Elder dared to attack him, a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>While some family members might share in each other's success and failure, many more tend to flee when disaster strikes. Thanks to the prestige of the previous patriarch and Xin Shaozu's dedicated efforts, the Xin family remained united, but this unity hadn't been tested by a major catastrophe.</p><p>If the Xin family's Grand Elder and the Luo Steward were here, Pei Gongfeng wouldn't be so surprised. Third Elder wasn't even a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator; his courage was commendable, at best.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng merely glanced at Third Elder, his disdain and unconcern leaving the elder flushed with humiliation.</p><p>Faced with the attack of the black maggots, Pei Gongfeng remained motionless. The mist around him rippled, forming a wave that halted the advancing maggots. The foremost rank was immediately thrown back.</p><p>Their mist-consuming ability failed; the fog effortlessly overwhelmed the black maggots. With a series of popping sounds, the maggots burst, leaving behind wisps of black energy that were instantly dispelled by the mist.</p><p>Third Elder was stunned, realizing the immense gap between himself and a Void Refinement cultivator.</p><p>As Third Elder attacked, Xin Shaozu opened his mouth, intending to explain, but it was too late to stop him. Third Elder's attack pushed the situation beyond redemption.</p><p>Of course, even without Third Elder's intervention, Pei Gongfeng wouldn't have shown mercy. Mingling was already engulfed by a sea of fire rings.</p><p>The fog was dyed red by the flames. Countless fire rings flew about, leaving fiery trails. The heat was terrifying; the three were as if in a sea of magma.</p><p>Mingling shielded Xin Shaozu and Third Elder, its body swelling to become a colossal black giant.</p><p>The giant's feet seemed to tread on the ocean, its head touching the heavens, looking down on Pei Gongfeng in majestic power. And it continued to grow, as if intending to burst through the formation, through this very world!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>As Mingling grew, endless spiritual energy poured into it.  Exceeding the size of mountains, Mingling clenched its fists and roared to the heavens.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>The roar was thunderous, deafening, yet it didn't reach outside the formation.</p><p>With a slight movement, Mingling prepared to strike, but not at Pei Gongfeng. As Third Elder suggested, it aimed to strike the formation.  Breaking through the formation's barrier and letting the battle's energy ripple out could potentially attract reinforcements.</p><p>Unfortunately, Pei Gongfeng had the upper hand, prepared for just such a move.  As Mingling swelled, countless fire rings surrounded it, then smashed down relentlessly.</p><p>Compared to Mingling's massive body, these fire rings were like bracelets, but they contained terrible power.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>'Bang bang bang bang…'</p><p>The fire rings fell like rain, overwhelming and inescapable.</p><p>Xin Shaozu had intended for Mingling to withstand the fire rings and focus on breaking the formation, but their power was beyond expectation.  Each impact created a burst of fire, quickly turning Mingling's surroundings into a fiery inferno.</p><p>Under the relentless barrage, Mingling's body swayed, its growth halting.  It was forced to shrink, its momentum broken.</p><p>Xin Shaozu sensed danger and hastily commanded Mingling to swing its left hand.</p><p>'Splat!'</p><p>Numerous fire rings were shattered by the force of the blow, but more continued to fill the void.</p><p>Young Master Xin and the Third Elder knew this couldn't last.  This stalemate played right into Pei's hands, severely disadvantaging them.  Furthermore, Young Master Xin keenly observed that the shattered fire rings hadn't completely dissipated.</p><p>Mingling's limbs, neck, and waist were somehow encircled by a faint red glow.  As more broken fire rings appeared, the glow intensified, resembling shackles binding Mingling, causing its movements to subtly lag.</p><p>If the shackles fully formed, the consequences would be dire. Pei's words weren't empty; the Yuan Yang Wuji Formation truly could suppress Mingling!</p><p>Young Master Xin, aghast, ordered Mingling to attack.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Mingling swung its right arm, unleashing a powerful punch that churned the formation into a maelstrom of clouds and mist, turning the heavens upside down.  But as expected, it failed to break the Yuan Yang Wuji Formation.</p><p>Seeing this, Young Master Xin altered the hand seals. Mingling rapidly shrank to the height of two or three people.</p><p>Though Mingling lost its imposing aura after shrinking, its form became denser.  With a sudden tremor, a plume of smoke erupted, dimming the shackles.</p><p>This eased the situation somewhat, but the crisis remained.</p><p>Young Master Xin and the Third Elder instantly entered Mingling's body. She seated herself within Mingling's abdomen, quickly regaining composure, her expression calm and serene. Her mind merged with Mingling, becoming one.</p><p>Mingling then fell strangely silent, slowly raising its head to face Pei.</p><p>Weirdly, Mingling's face was smooth as a mirror, devoid of features.  The moment it faced Pei, its face began to ripple and undulate, gradually forming features.</p><p>Initially, these were crude, merely hinting at eyes, nose, and mouth—uncoordinated, lopsided, and utterly grotesque. But the features quickly refined, eventually bearing a slight resemblance to Pei.</p><p>Staring intently at Pei, Mingling's features continued to transform, becoming increasingly similar. Ignoring the size difference, one might easily mistake it for Pei's brother.</p><p>Pei, sensing danger, remained within his spirit body.  He noticed an anomaly in his physical body, his expression turning grave. He recognized this as another of Mingling's bizarre abilities, but remained unfazed, coldly smiling as he swiftly formed a hand seal and pressed his palm downwards.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The fire rings ceased their assault and exploded simultaneously.</p><p>Crimson fire descended, transforming the ground beneath them into a fiery abyss.  The flames then coalesced into nine massive fireballs, resembling nine suns, but instead of hanging in the sky, they sank into the abyss.</p><p>Nine suns appeared, arranged in a peculiar formation.</p><p>Then, an incredibly powerful and intense suction force erupted from the abyss's depths.</p><p>Caught off guard, Mingling plummeted a hundred meters in an instant, stretching and distorting its body, on the verge of being consumed by the flames.</p><p>Young Master Xin urgently maneuvered Mingling to counterattack.  Its right foot stomped heavily, unleashing a black light that solidified into a long blade.</p><p>The blade cleaved through the air, unstoppable, striking towards the abyss!</p><p>The attack lessened the suction, but at the cost of Mingling's now-clear features becoming distorted once more.</p><p>Young Master Xin fought for time, striving to complete the secret technique, but a bizarre event unfolded.  As the blade struck the abyss, the lower flames dissipated, the nine suns vanished, and scorching heat enveloped them from above.</p><p>The same suction force erupted, this time originating from above.</p><p>In an instant, the world inverted, and the nine suns hung high in the sky.</p><p>Mingling, still unstable, was violently sucked upwards, forcing a change in tactics and interrupting Young Master Xin's secret technique again.</p><p>The nine suns continued shifting positions, Pei appearing and disappearing unpredictably, as if he controlled the very fabric of space and time, flipping his hand to command the heavens and the earth!</p><p>Such simple tactics, yet they consistently disrupted Mingling's techniques, steadily strengthening the shackles in the process.</p><p>Young Master Xin's blood essence was severely depleted; her exhaustion was undeniable, and Mingling's counterattacks grew weaker.</p><p>Time was running out.  Unless Young Master Xin possessed another trump card, they would soon be at Pei's mercy.</p><p>The Third Elder was frantic. Pei was too powerful; they were completely outmaneuvered.  If Pei hadn't intended to capture them alive, their situation would be far worse.  A stalemate was impossible; they feared defeat before Zhong Liang Sanren's arrival, resulting in a net loss.</p><p>By now, the shackles on Mingling were clearly visible—six chains binding its body.</p><p>Young Master Xin had repeatedly tried various secret techniques, all of which were countered by the attendant Pei.  However, she didn't beg for mercy, instead gritting her teeth and persevering.</p><p>At that moment, the void suddenly trembled slightly.  The tremor was so subtle that the combatants barely noticed it.  Yet, at the edge of the battlefield, a figure suddenly materialized from the void.</p><p>The figure revealed itself to be the elder who had previously appeared at the tomb entrance.  The elder looked astonished, clearly not expecting his sudden exposure.  He considered himself well-hidden, intending to wait patiently for a better opportunity to strike a decisive blow and claim victory.</p><p>His exposure was unexpected, leaving him no time to conceal himself again.  Without time to think about why the void had trembled and betrayed his position, he reacted swiftly. With a flick of his sleeve, a golden light flared.</p><p>A dagger-sized golden sword, its hilt inlaid with colorful gemstones, appeared—a work of exquisite artistry.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The instant the golden sword appeared, it unleashed terrifying killing intent and incredible speed, transforming into a golden lightning bolt. The sword light, like a golden dragon, fiercely tore through the mist, aiming straight for attendant Pei's heart.</p><p>If pierced by the golden sword, even a Nascent Soul cultivator's spirit body would shatter instantly, let alone attendant Pei's true form hidden within. This was the elder's prepared killing move, one he had intended to use at a more opportune moment.</p><p>"Zhong Liang!"</p><p>A roar of furious rage erupted from the mist, the voice belonging to attendant Pei.</p><p>The newcomer was indeed Zhong Liang, a wandering cultivator. After the death of the Xin family patriarch, he had coveted the Xin family's assets.  Possessing mid-Nascent Soul cultivation, he was even stronger than attendant Pei.  Only the combined forces of the Xin family and attendant Pei could stand against him.</p><p>Zhong Liang's sudden appearance completely caught attendant Pei off guard. Just as victory seemed imminent, a complication arose, infuriating attendant Pei.  He and Zhong Liang had been rivals for years, and he was acutely aware of the man's strength.  At that moment, he felt immense relief that he had been devoting significant energy to defending against Elder Qin while dealing with the vengeful spirits.  Unexpectedly, instead of Elder Qin, it was Zhong Liang who appeared.</p><p>As the golden sword flew towards her, a fiery banner rose slowly from attendant Pei's spirit body.  The banner unfurled, flapping in the wind.  As it billowed, a massive torrent of flames erupted, engulfing the golden sword with a *plop*.</p><p>A river of fire stretched behind attendant Pei.  The golden sword, persistent in its attack, could be seen flickering within the flames.</p><p>Zhong Liang's sneak attack was undeniably fierce, but attendant Pei's reaction was equally swift. Even if the golden sword ultimately pierced the river of fire, the banner's obstruction bought her precious time.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>Zhong Liang's laughter echoed through the battlefield.</p><p>The Third Elder's heart leaped with joy, though he concealed his feelings, his gaze fleetingly resting on Young Master Xin's silhouette.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A fissure opened in the mist, revealing Zhong Liang entering the fray.  A nine-story pagoda hovered before him—the very artifact that had breached the formation. Knowing the golden sword wouldn't kill attendant Pei, he took advantage of the distraction and attacked the vengeful spirits.</p><p>"Little girl, now you see how treacherous and cunning old Pei is?  Collaborating with him is like playing with fire; the Xin family will be left with nothing!"</p><p>As he spoke, Zhong Liang and the Third Elder exchanged a glance.  The Third Elder hesitated. While he had sided with Zhong Liang, he hadn't betrayed the Xin family. He believed that the Xin family's current situation was unsustainable and that aligning with a stronger power was the better option. He had practically watched Young Master Xin grow up; even if he harbored ambitions, he couldn't bring himself to act against her.  But the situation left him no choice.</p><p>Then, the Third Elder saw Young Master Xin raise her head, her expression remarkably calm.  For some reason, a chilling premonition washed over him.</p><p>"Senior Zhong Liang, Senior Pei,"</p><p>Young Master Xin's voice was as calm as her expression, as if unaware of her precarious situation.</p><p>"To manipulate you both here… it wasn't easy.  After all, this was my only chance."</p><p>Her words caused Zhong Liang and attendant Pei to exchange sharp glances, their attention fixed on the seemingly frail young woman.  Without the vengeful spirits, they could crush Young Master Xin with one hand.  Despite her weakened state from blood loss and the spirits' diminished power, they felt a growing sense of unease.</p><p>"I must also thank Third Elder for luring Senior Zhong Liang here," Young Master Xin turned to the Third Elder, offering her sincere thanks.</p><p>"Xin Sheng, you…"</p><p>Suddenly, the Third Elder saw Young Master Xin crush something, her figure becoming translucent.  At that moment, the entire external array, the countless islands and mountains, trembled violently.</p><p>"Seize her!"</p><p>Zhong Liang and attendant Pei roared in unison.</p>
