<h1>Chapter 1691: Escape Route</h1><p>Having previously hidden within the Earth Palace, earning some respite, the good times didn't last.  Before long, Qin Sang was forced to move again, having switched between countless sword peaks during this period.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang realized the demons had changed their tactics.</p><p>The sword formation he relied on for maneuvering was called the Xuanji Sword Formation, a rare and superior illusionary sword formation of the Golden Phase Hall.  If it were one of those sword formations known for their brute force, he couldn't have hidden for so long.</p><p>The Golden Phase Hall was built upon a foundation of earth-attributed energy arrays, incorporating numerous superior sword formations, including the Xuanji Sword Formation, to form a grand sword peak array imbued with the essence of sword cultivation.</p><p>However, even though the Golden Phase Hall combined these formations flawlessly, differences in their energy flows and manifested phenomena could still be discerned at the junctions.</p><p>The Demon Kings must have noticed this, deploying demon formations in mid-air, guarding all crucial junctures, encircling the Xuanji Sword Formation, striving to trap Qin Sang within this area, and then devising ways to breach the formation, searching inch by inch.</p><p>The demons' offensive was relentless, and the places to hide dwindled.</p><p>Qin Sang knew the danger was rapidly approaching, but he couldn't afford to worry about it, racing against time to heal his true body.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang had the resolve to make a painful sacrifice.  Escaping today would come at a cost.  He hadn't sent his avatar away because he still clung to a sliver of hope, hoping to save his true body.</p><p>When that familiar fluctuation transmitted in an extremely subtle manner, touching the protective restrictions of his hiding place and alerting him, Qin Sang's joy was immense.</p><p>Ice Soul Divine Light!</p><p>Liuli was here too!</p><p>This was truly unexpected.</p><p>Since parting in the Western Desert, Liuli had been without news for years. Qin Sang assumed she had severed her ties with the mortal world, retreating to some Buddhist sect in the Western Desert to comprehend Buddhist scriptures and cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>Unexpectedly, she was in the Southern Continent, and had also been drawn into the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately realized that Liuli had always made saving her master her mission. As long as she knew of the relationship between the Formless Immortal Sect and the Immortal Palace, she would definitely rush over immediately. It was just that they had been separated for too long, and Qin Sang hadn't considered this possibility.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't sense Liuli and didn't know her current cultivation level.</p><p>Clearly, Liuli was still some distance away, utilizing the concealing properties of the Ice Soul Divine Light to communicate through divine ability.</p><p>The joy of reunion with an old friend didn't cloud Qin Sang's judgment.</p><p>Liuli's offer of assistance was a boon, but the enemy was too powerful. If she acted rashly and was dragged into danger, it wasn't something Qin Sang wanted to see.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang acted swiftly, unhesitatingly opening the secret hall's restrictions. A divine light drifted in.</p><p>In the next moment, the divine light transformed into a map before Qin Sang.</p><p>Looking closely, Qin Sang recognized the map depicted a small part of the Formless Immortal Sect's legacy, roughly the area extending northeast from the Golden Phase Hall.</p><p>It was a topographical map, but very simplified, lacking detailed markings of buildings and terrain.</p><p>A white line on the map connected the Golden Phase Hall and the other end.</p><p>At the other end of the white line, the divine light projected an illusory image of a secluded庵堂 nestled in the mountains, within which lay a hidden teleportation formation!</p><p>It clearly pointed him towards an escape route, even considering all the dangers along the way. He only needed to follow the route.</p><p>To Qin Sang's great delight, the distance from the Golden Phase Hall to the teleportation formation was far shorter than escaping through the main gate.</p><p>And this was precisely the greatest difficulty Qin Sang faced.</p><p>He could perhaps repel the Demon Kings temporarily, and could also create some distance with his exceptional escape techniques, but it would be difficult to truly shake off his pursuers. He had originally planned to leverage the ubiquitous ancient restrictions within the Formless Immortal Sect, using his avatar as a decoy to create an escape opportunity for his true body.</p><p>With Liuli's guidance, as long as he could reach the庵堂 safely, he could escape!</p><p>“The Formless Immortal Sect truly has other passages.”</p><p>Qin Sang had considered this possibility but suffered from a lack of knowledge about the Formless Immortal Sect.  He hadn't expected Liuli to provide such crucial assistance.</p><p>Truly, Heaven never seals off all exits!</p><p>“Do you still have strength remaining?”</p><p>The illusory image dissipated, leaving this question behind.</p><p>Liuli had managed to sneak the Ice Soul Divine Light in under the demons' surveillance, which was no easy feat. The divine sense maintaining the Ice Soul Divine Light was at its limit.  They only had time for a brief exchange before the connection was severed.</p><p>As the Ice Soul Divine Light dispersed, Qin Sang's tense mind relaxed considerably. Liuli had planned ahead and hadn't acted recklessly.  His greatest worry hadn't come to pass.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang understood that Liuli's ability to recognize him at the Myriad Demons Assembly years ago wasn't due to his sword intent as she had claimed, but definitely related to that demonic cultivation technique.</p><p>With internal and external communication established and a plan set, the subsequent actions had a method.</p><p>Qin Sang ceased attempting to heal and instead employed all means to forcibly stabilize his true body's injuries, striving to control his true essence, cast spells, and command his flying sword, even if it meant worsening the aftereffects and making future recovery more difficult.</p><p>Outside the Xuanji Sword Formation.</p><p>Liuli finished channeling her energy and sensed the old nun looking at her.  "We'll go to Yu Yang Peak first," Liuli said.  "My fellow disciples have already entered the secret passage within this mountain.  The Abbess only needs to meet them at the entrance."</p><p>The old nun didn't move. She had been silently observing Liuli.  Seeing Liuli seemingly determined to rescue someone, she couldn't help but remind her, "That spiritual fire capable of extinguishing a Nascent Soul avatar must have consumed a great deal of energy. How much true essence does he have left? If he's defeated and captured, the Demon Kings will certainly turn to find you.  I'm afraid you won't have time to retreat and will be caught as well."</p><p>Liuli calmly replied, "Don't worry, Abbess. His escape techniques are excellent."</p><p>The old nun's expression turned hesitant upon hearing this.</p><p>She chose to stay, firstly out of camaraderie, and secondly because Qin Sang's obliteration of the three Nascent Soul avatars had left a deep impression on her. If this person could escape this calamity, his future was limitless.</p><p>Forming a connection with such a figure was undoubtedly a good thing.</p><p>But this was going against Nascent Soul demons. The old nun couldn't help but have numerous concerns, and what she could do was limited.</p><p>Since they had met, Liuli had never lied. At this critical juncture of life and death, she certainly wouldn't speak carelessly. They had witnessed the demons revealing their true forms and arriving with lightning speed.</p><p>If Liuli dared to say so, it meant this person's escape techniques definitely surpassed those of the Demon Kings.</p><p>Thus, there was a glimmer of hope!</p><p>Liuli circled around to the side of the Xuanji Sword Formation closer to the core of the Golden Phase Hall, selected a sword peak at the formation's edge, concealed her presence, and quietly entered the mountain.</p><p>Atop the sword peak, clear ripples shimmered. A fish demon in its true form floated in mid-air, monitoring the surrounding peaks.</p><p>Liuli didn't dare infiltrate the Xuanji Sword Formation. Its energy flow was already sealed by the demon formations and watchful eyes. Entering physically would definitely expose her. She stopped at the edge of the sword formation and entered a rather elegant courtyard.</p><p>Since this peak had been visited by the nuns of Hidden Moon庵堂, Liuli had chosen this location when formulating her plan.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when passing Yu Yang Peak, the old nun didn't stop and accompanied Liuli to this point.</p><p>She surveyed the peak.  The original owner had connected several courtyards within the mountain with a formation, not particularly sophisticated but easy to grasp, and they could quickly master it.  Its power was decent.</p><p>"I'll manipulate this formation from below to prevent distractions for you," the old nun unexpectedly chose to stay.</p><p>Of course, she hid in the shadows, without needing to put herself in danger.  If anything unexpected happened, the demons would target Liuli first. Even if she couldn't rescue Liuli, she could escape in the chaos.</p><p>Liuli knew the old nun taking this step was already a significant risk and expressed her gratitude.</p><p>The old nun waved her dust whisk, leaving behind the words, "Be careful."</p><p>Watching the old nun leave, Liuli paused for a moment before vanishing.</p><p>…</p><p>The suspended lake in the sky.</p><p>The Golden Phase Hall on the ground.</p><p>The two battlefields became the focal points.</p><p>The continuous turbulence of the suspended lake was terrifying.</p><p>The numerous demonic shadows above the Golden Phase Hall also attracted much attention. Everyone was curious whether that formidable figure still had strength remaining and could bring them more surprises.</p><p>Such a figure had appeared among the human race, yet was being pursued by demons on human territory.  Some couldn't help but feel sorrow, a sense of shared misfortune, but since Sage Huiguang hadn't spoken, what dared others do?</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>…</p><p>Layers of azure light rose from the Xuanji Sword Formation. The azure light was like mist. The appearance of this phenomenon indicated that the formation's power had weakened considerably.</p><p>The demonic eyes in the sky rotated incessantly.</p><p>Within the formation, the space for Qin Sang to maneuver was rapidly shrinking.</p><p>All the sword peaks enveloped by the Xuanji Sword Formation shook violently, as if about to crumble.</p><p>Just as the formation's power grew increasingly chaotic, unusual fluctuations suddenly appeared on a sword peak at the formation's edge, as if something was impacting the demon formation, and it didn't resemble the fluctuations of the Xuanji Sword Formation.</p><p>Bai Xiao didn't move.</p><p>The demon formation remained undisturbed.</p><p>The four-winged blood serpent coiled around him suddenly glared, its crimson eyes flashing with a demonic light, transforming into a streak of blood-colored light and darting towards that sword peak.</p><p>Simultaneously, the fish demon guarding this peak flicked its tail, striking downwards fiercely. The surrounding azure light abruptly condensed into a waterfall, crashing down on a courtyard within the mountain with the force of a landslide.</p><p>This strike wasn't solely its own power, but utilized the demon formation. Even if other Demon Kings didn't move, they could provide support.</p><p>Instantly, countless pavilions and halls collapsed, rubble flew, and a deep crater was smashed into the courtyard.</p><p>Then, the fish demon and the four-winged blood serpent swooped down from left and right.</p><p>Unexpectedly, white mist suddenly surged from the ruins, like an icy mist formed from countless tiny ice crystals, incredibly frigid. This scene was identical to the avatar's previous attack.</p><p>The attacker was indeed Liuli, deliberately imitating the avatar. Although their cultivated divine abilities weren't the same, these demons weren't familiar with the Ice Soul Divine Light. In such haste, they couldn't easily discern the difference.</p><p>The ice mist surged outwards at an astonishing speed.</p><p>The fish demon and the four-winged blood serpent knew it was a cornered beast fighting back and had been somewhat cautious. Sensing the icy煞 energy, their expressions changed, and their escaping lights arced, hastily detouring.</p><p>‘Swoosh!’</p><p>A white shadow flickered, shooting towards the sword peak.</p><p>As soon as the divine light appeared, Bai Xiao reacted!</p><p>However, the demon formation remained unchanged.</p><p>They knew both Qin Sang's true body and avatar were trapped. Using the avatar as bait to divert attention wasn't a difficult tactic to imagine.  At times like these, they couldn't afford to lose their composure and give the opponent an opportunity.</p><p>Of course, Bai Xiao would be happy to capture the avatar and cripple Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A beam of light, like a sharp arrow, shot from the demonic eye in the sky.</p><p>Upon impact, the ice mist immediately churned.</p><p>Bai Xiao vaguely saw a shadowy figure within the mist. While remaining vigilant of other directions, he extended an arm. The nails on his slender five fingers grew rapidly, resembling five thin swords, incredibly sharp.</p><p>At this moment, Bai Xiao inexplicably felt a sense of foreboding. The next instant, he felt a bone-chilling coldness as the surrounding void froze at a visible pace.</p><p>This was the true Ice Soul Divine Light!</p><p>In an instant, a shrill cry echoed through the heavens.</p><p>Bai Xiao, after all, was a Great Saint of the demon race and had been on guard. His counterattack was swift and fierce. The beam of light from the demonic eye immediately shifted onto himself. White smoke billowed wildly around him as he desperately tried to suppress the spreading ice, his figure soaring upwards.</p><p>Unexpectedly, another change occurred.  A violent wind suddenly swept through the nearly ruined courtyard.  The spiritual formation was activated, instantly forming a grey whirlwind. The spiritual wind formed rings of grey, and an immense suction force enveloped the surrounding space.</p><p>Even in this critical moment, Bai Xiao didn't call for help.</p><p>Just as the demons were shaken, a figure suddenly flashed in the northeast direction, assaulting the demon formation.</p><p>"Here… Caw!"</p><p>The Bone Bird was stationed at this peak.</p><p>Seeing the figure, the Bone Bird let out a warning cry and flapped its wings downwards.  Two Demon Kings on either side immediately closed in. Just as they were about to intercept, they suddenly saw a mass of crimson fire rushing towards them, looking very familiar. The Bone Bird's cry immediately became distorted.</p><p>The Southern Bright Emberfire reappeared!</p><p>However, this time, only three birds appeared, and it was the avatar who attacked.</p><p>But in the Bone Bird's view, this was the terrifying flame that had extinguished the Saint King's three avatars. The three avatars had been crushed without any resistance, and even the Five Elements Divine Restriction had been breached. What were they compared to that?</p><p>The Bone Bird had no time to discern the difference in strength.</p><p>Moreover, the power of the three divine birds was terrifying enough.</p><p>"This guy still has strength left!"</p><p>This was the only thought left in the Bone Bird's mind, filled with terror. Like a drowning person, it frantically flapped its two bony wings, shedding most of its remaining yellow feathers.</p><p>The other two Demon Kings didn't care about the Bone Bird and fled without looking back.</p><p>The demon formation was thrown into chaos. The power of the other Demon Kings formed a grey tide, converging and then abruptly dispersing, all drawn to the Bone Bird to defend against the Southern Bright Emberfire.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The crimson flames exploded in the sky once more, shaking everyone again.</p><p>Although it was less powerful than the previous two explosions, it was mixed with grey energy.</p><p>A lightning-fast streak of light took advantage of the chaos and shot out of the Golden Phase Hall, faster than thunder, streaking towards the northeast under countless shocked gazes, vanishing into the sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know whether the Bone Bird was dead or alive, nor did he care. His true body recklessly mobilized his true essence, utilizing both Thunder Escape and Sword Escape, leaving the Demon Kings behind.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>Bai Xiao flew into a rage, breaking free from the Ice Soul Divine Light and wind rings, giving chase.</p><p>Only a few streaks of light could be seen streaking across the sky.</p><p>To everyone's confusion, the figure wasn't fleeing outwards, but towards the depths of the legacy.</p><p>With his exceptional escape techniques, Qin Sang managed to leave his pursuers behind, but this wasn't enough to ensure his escape.</p><p>Before reaching the庵堂, Qin Sang's injuries flared up again, this time beyond suppression.  His avatar took over, carrying his true body and continuing to flee.</p><p>This distance seemed incredibly long to Qin Sang.</p><p>Finally, the mountain peak and the庵堂 appeared before him.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The avatar, carrying Qin Sang’s true body, descended from the sky, rushing directly into the庵堂.</p><p>Bai Xiao arrived close behind. Just as he was about to enter, he saw a wave of white, icy air surging out.</p><p>By the time he suppressed the Ice Soul Divine Light and blasted the庵堂 into pieces, all he saw was a teleportation formation destroyed from the other side, devoid of any figures.</p>
