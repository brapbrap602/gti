<h1>Chapter 598: Three Lights Jade Liquid</h1><p>Chapter 598: Three Lights Jade Liquid</p><p>The platform above was clear of debris, and no mechanisms were visible.</p><p>The most striking features were the several jade pillars, all damaged to varying degrees.  The broken ends were clearly visible, and many of the dragon and phoenix carvings were missing half their bodies.</p><p>The Gathering Spirit Hall clearly witnessed a devastating battle.</p><p>The platform itself suffered the most severe damage, bearing the marks of a terrible impact. Several large cracks crisscrossed its surface, and many sections were shattered.</p><p>The platform hadn't disintegrated completely only because of the protective barrier.</p><p>However, this barrier was now extremely weak and severely damaged; its power was barely perceptible.</p><p>It was unclear whether the barrier was already in this state after the battle,</p><p>or whether the battle weakened it to the point it could no longer sustain itself, gradually fading over countless years until it reached this state.</p><p>If it was due to the passage of time, the platform would likely collapse on its own in a few thousand years. Then, anyone entering the Gathering Spirit Hall could easily find the platform, without this much effort.</p><p>As Qin Sang asked this, her gaze swept across the pillars, finding nothing unusual.  Her eyes then fell on a recess in the platform, where she sensed a strange fluctuation.</p><p>It originated from within the platform!</p><p>Yun Youzi, like Qin Sang, looked at the same spot and felt it too.</p><p>With their cultivation levels, they wouldn't have noticed it if the barrier's power had been intact. But now, with the barrier on the verge of collapse and incredibly fragile, the internal fluctuation was impossible to conceal.</p><p>They exchanged a glance and moved simultaneously.</p><p>Qin Sang activated her corpse pill, soaring above the platform on her sword.  The ebony sword, like a lightning bolt, descended toward the platform.</p><p>Sword energy branched into thousands of strands, resembling flowing tassels.</p><p>With Qin Sang using the Heavenly Gang Step to reveal the barrier, its weaknesses were exposed. Though they couldn't break the barrier, finding a few flaws wasn't difficult.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The barrier flickered, sparked by the sword energy, and the platform trembled.</p><p>Qin Sang, calm and with piercing eyes, instantly identified the locations.  She gathered the sword energy into several beams, accurately striking the weak points.</p><p>‘Pff! Pff!’</p><p>The sword energy penetrated the barrier.</p><p>Suddenly, the Gathering Spirit Hall was filled with brilliant light, the barrier violently shaking. A vast wave of spiritual energy erupted, shooting skyward towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Even in its weakened state, the barrier’s counterattack was extremely fierce.</p><p>Qin Sang’s face changed slightly. Without hesitation, she used her Sword Qi Thunder Sound ability, transforming into a lightning bolt to evade the attack.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The wave of spiritual energy narrowly missed Qin Sang.</p><p>Yun Youzi, having waited for the opportune moment, launched his attack. He and Qin Sang worked in perfect coordination. As the wave appeared, he rushed towards the recess, gathering spiritual energy in his palm to destroy a nearby restriction.</p><p>He then immediately retreated.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The platform shook even more violently, followed by faint ‘crackling’ sounds from within.</p><p>After a moment, the recess slowly rose, revealing a jade pillar embedded beneath it, virtually identical to the others.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at the moment the pillar almost fully emerged, a hidden compartment appeared beneath it, containing a tipped-over jade bottle.</p><p>A flash of green light appeared.</p><p>With a ‘click’, the bottle tumbled out of the compartment, instantly capturing Qin Sang and Yun Youzi’s attention.</p><p>The bottle wasn't large, easily held in one hand, transparent, and contained a small amount of bright green liquid, staining the bottle green.  It seemed to hold about a dozen drops.</p><p>The moment the bottle appeared, Qin Sang felt an exceptionally strong life force and abundant spiritual energy. She inhaled deeply, feeling utterly refreshed.</p><p>Even the surrounding plants tilted towards the bottle, as if dancing.</p><p>What incredible liquid!</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed in amazement.</p><p>“Three Lights Jade Liquid! It’s really Three Lights Jade Liquid!”</p><p>Yun Youzi murmured, his excitement palpable.</p><p>“Senior, let's split this Three Lights Jade Liquid evenly.”</p><p>Qin Sang, suppressing her excitement, suggested a fair share.</p><p>She wasn’t greedy. The bottle held a considerable amount of liquid; even half would be enough to transform the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid, with some left over for emergencies.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yun Youzi shook his head in refusal.  “Three drops are enough for this old man. More isn't necessarily better.  Taking more wouldn't help, it might even breed complacency and weaken my fighting spirit, causing harm! My younger brother, take the liquid. If I need it later, I'll ask you for some, and you won't refuse, will you?”</p><p>Yun Youzi chuckled, looking at her.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, "Senior, feel free to use it whenever you need it.  Besides the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid, the other spirit herbs brought from Xuanpu Palace were divided among the Yuan Ying cultivators.  I wouldn't have any left.  Even the Three Lights Jade Liquid, precious as it is, is just a healing medicine; it's not much more valuable than ten-thousand-year spirit milk."</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded. Xuanpu Palace had been completely ransacked; the Three Lights Jade Liquid's greatest use was no longer relevant. He drew the jade bottle into his palm, took another bottle from his pouch, poured out three drops, and then handed the jade bottle back to Qin Sang.</p><p>A wave of coolness emanated from the jade bottle.</p><p>With a gentle shake, the jade liquid within vibrated, its life force even more intense. Qin Sang couldn't resist taking a few sniffs.</p><p>After Yun Youzi took three drops, about ten drops remained.</p><p>Qin Sang capped the bottle, still uneasy.  She sealed it with a restriction to prevent the life force from leaking out, then stored it in her storage ring.</p><p>After putting away the Three Lights Jade Liquid, they searched the Immortal Terrace thoroughly. Seeing that the Gathering Spirit Bowl wasn't there, they gave up.</p><p>...</p><p>Above the Linhai forest.</p><p>Two figures, who had vanished a short while ago, reappeared abruptly, only to disappear again in a flash.  Hidden in the treetops, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi cautiously surveyed their surroundings, ensuring no one was watching before daring to move.</p><p>Such caution was necessary.</p><p>Those who entered the Ziwei Palace were all Golden Core and Yuan Ying masters.  They were at the bottom of the food chain; one slip-up, and they could face utter ruin.</p><p>Leaving the treetops, they changed direction, Qin Sang swiftly following Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi's destination was not far from the Ancient Medicine Garden. He mentioned it might be an ancient alchemical site, containing something that could help him recover.</p><p>"We're here!"</p><p>They traveled at top speed, arriving at a mountain before long.</p><p>Yun Youzi put away his spirit bamboo flying boat and pointed towards the summit. "It's up there."</p><p>The mountain was extremely steep, shrouded in mist.  Faint outlines of palace structures were visible, mostly resembling the Gathering Spirit Hall – heavily damaged and reduced to ruins.</p><p>Most astonishing was the eastern side of the mountain. From peak to base ran a chasm like a single line in the sky, its far side tilted outwards, threatening to collapse.  Clearly, it wasn't naturally formed, but a sword mark!</p><p>A single sword strike had cleaved a mountain.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu had done something similar, but this sword mark still retained terrifying sword energy – something even Senior Qingzhu couldn't achieve.</p>
