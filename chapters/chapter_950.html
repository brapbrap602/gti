<h1>Chapter 942: Banner Completed</h1><p>This treasure is a damaged relic. Its original rank is unknown, but in its current state, it can only be used to conceal one's presence.  The young man surnamed Fang relied on the Red Veil to move freely within human territory.</p><p>After hearing Qin Sang explain the Red Veil's function, Bai's face lit up with joy. "Good! With this treasure's help, we should be able to succeed. Fellow Daoist, let's begin…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>The ground of the cavern and the walls of the canyon were of similar material, gleaming with a metallic sheen and incredibly hard. According to Bai, this was due to the presence of the demonic seals.  These seals pervaded the Ghost Lands, completely enveloping them, sealing the souls of the deceased, and eternally suppressing this place.</p><p>It was because of the altar that Bai was able to slumber within the cavern.  Elsewhere, if Bai dared to approach the demonic seals, he would immediately suffer backlash. Earlier, when observing the Nascent Soul cultivator at the valley entrance, he could only stand far back.</p><p>Bai led Qin Sang to the altar's perimeter. After explaining the key points of breaking the seals, he sat down in the center of the altar, waiting for Qin Sang to collect the Demonic Fire so he could activate the altar and provide assistance. He clenched his hands, his eyes unable to conceal his nervousness.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the altar several times, contemplated for a moment, then sat cross-legged near the altar. From his spatial ring, he retrieved a demonic banner.  He closed his eyes slightly, recalling Old Ancestor Kui Yin's refining techniques.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this wasn't refining, but rather capturing the Nine Nether Demonic Fire and sealing it within the dark iron pillar using its existing restrictions and Soul Threads.  In this process, he not only had to suppress the Demonic Fire's resistance but also face the backlash from the demonic seals.</p><p>Capturing the Demonic Fire that had appeared at the canyon entrance might have been easier, but firstly, the Nascent Soul cultivator was watching from outside, and secondly, that wouldn't weaken the demonic seals.  Fortunately, Bai could draw upon the altar's power to help him resist the seals at the crucial moment.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Qin Sang mentally reviewed the process several times.  Once he was sure nothing had been overlooked, he opened his eyes and nodded at Bai. "Let's begin!"</p><p>Bai took a deep breath, his expression grave, as he surveyed the eight pillars on the altar. The pillars, made of an unknown material, had weathered over time into the appearance of unremarkable, grey stone pillars.</p><p>Bai's lips moved slightly as he recited an incantation etched deep within his soul, activating the altar that had slumbered for countless years. Qin Sang gripped the demonic banner, ready to deploy his secret technique to capture the Demonic Fire, his eyes fixed on Bai's actions. Bai's chanting grew faster, but the altar remained motionless.</p><p>Suddenly, the altar trembled, causing the entire cavern to shake.  The next moment, a 'creaking' sound came from one of the pillars at the altar's edge.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted towards the sound.</p><p>A faint light shone from within the pillar, illuminating it from the inside out. The pillar's appearance transformed dramatically, as if shedding a stone shell, revealing a jade-like interior. Alarmingly, under the faint light, countless spiderweb-like cracks were visible throughout the pillar.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened at this sight. Noticing Bai seemed to have paused his incantation, he quickly asked, "Were those cracks already there?"</p><p>The demonic seals' power was waning, and the altar's condition didn't seem optimistic either.  Qin Sang worried that the pillars might shatter midway, causing their efforts to fail. If that happened, he would truly be trapped in the Ghost Lands for decades.</p><p>Bai's expression was also somewhat serious.  He stared at the pillar for a long moment. "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. The cracks are caused by the altar's weakening under the demonic seals' corrosion. However, I believe I personally refined this object in my previous life. It's not as fragile as it appears.  Besides, the current power of the demonic seals is a far cry from what it once was. The pillar can hold until we break the seals and release the souls."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression relaxed. "In that case, I'm relieved. I've prepared the secret technique. Fellow Daoist, please directly assault the demonic seals and force the Demonic Fire to appear."</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Bai nodded and pointed at the pillar. His finger moved like a spinning wheel, rapidly shooting beams of spiritual light into the pillar.  Then, amidst a nerve-wracking creaking sound, a burst of intense light erupted from the pillar, illuminating the entire chamber. Countless profound runes appeared where the pillar connected to the altar.</p><p>Bathed in the light, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable sense of peace upon seeing the runes, yet his mind remained clear.  He wasn't sure if this was due to the Jade Buddha or if the altar's power didn't affect the living.</p><p>With the runes' appearance, a sudden change occurred.  A strange light shimmered on the ground, and then dense black lines emerged, forming a large net that enveloped the altar.  From these black lines, Qin Sang sensed a familiar aura—the Nine Nether Demonic Fire!</p><p>The moment the black lines appeared, the pillar's light dimmed abruptly. The runes swirled and were forced back into the altar, the pillar's light growing even weaker.</p><p>"Open!" Bai's eyes widened, and he roared, slamming his hand down. The runes on the altar exploded, coalescing into a ball of spiritual light that slammed into a section of the black net in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>After the violent tremor, Qin Sang, using the Skyeye Butterfly's power, observed the changes.  The black net rose from the ground, revealing its true form: countless strange runes writhing, enveloping and devouring the altar's spiritual light.  Sensing Bai's presence, they surged madly towards the altar.</p><p>Bai's face changed, and he hastily channeled the altar's power to block the runes' assault, looking at Qin Sang with anticipation.</p><p>Qin Sang stared intently at the point where the black net had erupted.  The power of the demonic seals, forced out by the altar, had manifested. Carrying the runes of the demonic seals were streams of Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  Originally, the Demonic Fire should have been seamlessly integrated with the runes. However, due to the vulnerability that had appeared, an opportunity arose.</p><p>Seeing his chance, Qin Sang didn't hesitate. He immediately waved the demonic banner towards the spot.  The banner slowly descended towards the Demonic Fire, black light flickering.  Suddenly, a suction force emerged, drawing out a stream of Nine Nether Demonic Fire.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang deployed his secret technique, activating the banner to seal the Demonic Fire.</p><p>A surprising scene unfolded. The aggressive Demonic Fire struggled fiercely within the banner's black light, yet it couldn't break free. Gradually, the Demonic Fire subsided, flashing once before disappearing into the banner.</p><p>At the same time, the strange runes shattered, and the black net's aura weakened.</p><p>Overjoyed, Bai urged, "Fellow Daoist, quickly gather the Demonic Fire! Once we succeed, we'll immediately move to the other locations. We must destroy those key restrictions before the demonic seals recover!"</p><p>Knowing time was of the essence, Qin Sang didn't hesitate.  Unconcerned about the increased consumption of his true essence, he accelerated his movements. Strands of Nine Nether Demonic Fire were sealed within the banner.</p><p>Under Bai's anxious gaze, a brand new demonic banner was completely refined!</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the banner into his palm, a smile appearing on his face. Old Ancestor Kui Yin would never have imagined that the Ten Yama Banner, created with such immense effort, would reappear in his hands and shine with such brilliance!</p>
