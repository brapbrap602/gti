<h1>Chapter 2101: Bound Hand and Foot</h1><p>North Sea.</p><p>In the jungle of a deserted island, a small fox peered cautiously around, its eyes filled with alertness.</p><p>The sea was calm and peaceful, the sea breeze gentle, the waves lapping softly against the shore.</p><p>After a moment, the fox ducked its head, hopped and skipped, nimbly weaving through the jungle until it reached a towering ancient tree, and then it bumped its head against the tree.</p><p>Strangely, the ancient tree remained motionless, and the fox disappeared into thin air.</p><p>It turned out that there was a hollow at the base of the tree, concealed by a magical barrier. The fox appeared inside the hollow, which was dry and airy. Two meditation cushions were placed side by side, and Qin Li was sitting cross-legged on one, eyes closed in meditation.</p><p>His face was pale, his lips chapped, clearly showing signs of injury, but his breathing had stabilized.</p><p>Qin Li and the fox had been hiding here for several days.</p><p>After the second line of defense was breached, they retreated with the main army, and experienced several more defeats.  However, their superiors were methodical, always retreating before the situation deteriorated, allowing junior disciples like them to escape first, while the experts stayed behind to cover their retreat, skillfully avoiding the enemy's advance while maintaining order.</p><p>Although this demoralized the troops, there were no major casualties.</p><p>However, accidents were inevitable.  Qin Li's squad was ambushed by a large Changyou army during one retreat, and a fierce battle ensued. He and the fox became separated from the others in the fighting, and Qin Li was injured.</p><p>By the time they shook off their pursuers, they had completely lost track of the others, leaving only the man and the fox adrift at sea.</p><p>Unsure whether they had repelled the enemy or were in full retreat and being pursued, they dared not follow their planned route to rejoin the others.</p><p>Furthermore, with the Changyou invasion, the entire sea area was in chaos. The strongholds they remembered might already be occupied by the enemy, and there was nowhere that was absolutely safe.</p><p>Lacking any intelligence, they were lost and confused, unsure where to go. Qin Li's injuries only compounded their problems, yet they dared not stop to heal.</p><p>Finally, the fox decided to abandon the search for the main army and head to Beichen Territory.  Firstly, Beichen Territory was the ancestral temple of the Qingyang Daoist Sect; secondly, their continuous retreat towards Xuan Yue Territory had led to repeated ambushes and attacks, suggesting that the enemy's main target was likely Xuan Yue Territory, since it housed the crucial ancient teleportation array.</p><p>The fox led Qin Li northeast, cautiously making their way to Beichen Territory. Their journey proved surprisingly uneventful, confirming their choice was correct.</p><p>Some time ago, Qin Li's injuries suddenly worsened, and medication alone was insufficient to control them. They had to risk stopping to allow him to heal.</p><p>Fortunately, after rest and meditation, Qin Li's condition gradually improved.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes, licked his chapped lips, and saw the fox squatting before him, watching him.</p><p>"How are you feeling?" the fox asked.</p><p>"Much better," Qin Li paused, a look of apology on his face. "I'm a burden to you."</p><p>Qin Li understood that they were not safe, and the fox had taken great risks for him.</p><p>The fox snorted, stretched, "We shouldn't stay here long. We should leave. I just went out to scout, and the surroundings are safe."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Qin Li took out a jade bottle and swallowed all the pills inside, without even refining them.  After erasing their tracks, he and the fox left the hollow, activated a concealment artifact, and continued towards Beichen Territory.</p><p>They were extremely cautious.  The clever fox could keenly detect traces even in the water, allowing them to judge danger and repeatedly helping them avoid the enemy.</p><p>Qin Li concentrated on controlling the artifact, while the fox kept watch.  They safely passed another two days.</p><p>As they drew closer to Beichen Territory, crisis struck unexpectedly!</p><p>It was evening.  There was no storm, but the sky was obscured by thick clouds, and the sunset glow could only barely penetrate.  The clouds moved and shifted ceaselessly in the sky.</p><p>A wisp of cloud drifted among the clouds, inconspicuous and unnoticed even by the vigilant fox.</p><p>Above the cloud, seated or standing, were Changyou experts.</p><p>Following the clan leader's orders, General Minshan shifted their target from Xuan Yue Territory to Beichen Territory.  A deceptive strategy was employed to divert the attention of the Storm Realm forces, while the main force secretly advanced towards Beichen Territory.</p><p>The strategy succeeded.  The Changyou experts responsible for the deception immediately came to join the main force. Passing this way, they discovered Qin Li and the fox.</p><p>Two junior cultivators were initially ignored by the powerful figures high above in the clouds.  One of them casually tilted a jade cup, spilling a few drops of wine.</p><p>The wine instantly transformed into a ferocious storm.  Qin Li and the little fox only then realized the danger, but it was too late.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Torrential rain poured down, the air thick with the scent of wine.  The terrifying pressure caused the little fox and Qin Li to tremble, unable to even contemplate resistance.  Despair washed over them; their careful journey had ultimately failed to avoid this calamity.</p><p>As they were about to be engulfed, a brilliant ray of light pierced the clouds and descended from the heavens.</p><p>The Changyou clan experts above paled, the one who had held the jade cup abruptly rising and inverting the cup, throwing it downwards.</p><p>The cup's mouth rapidly expanded, emitting an immensely powerful suction force, attempting to draw in the little fox and Qin Li. However, the light was faster, instantly appearing above them, revealing a seemingly ethereal sword image.</p><p>Wherever the sword shadow passed, raindrops dissolved, and the storm abruptly ceased.  Then, the sword tip subtly flicked, and a sword energy suddenly slashed towards the jade cup.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A sharp sound echoed as a crack appeared on the jade cup.  With a series of clinking sounds, the cup shattered into several pieces, falling into the sea.</p><p>The little fox and Qin Li clung to each other, believing their end had come, only to find themselves miraculously spared.</p><p>They stared blankly at the spirit sword before them, finding it somewhat familiar, yet its power differed greatly from what they remembered.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Having cleaved the jade cup, the spirit sword immediately struck towards the clouds above.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The clouds surged, suddenly unleashing several powerful auras. The little fox's newly kindled hope flickered and died.</p><p>These auras were even more terrifying than those of Golden Core stage cultivators – several Changyou clan experts at the Yuan Realm level four, their power comparable to Nascent Soul Ancestors.  Any single hair from them could crush the little fox and Qin Li.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the spirit sword pressed forward relentlessly, like a rainbow piercing the sun, directly striking the clouds.  The figures above scattered in disarray, none daring to block the strike, instead choosing to evade its sharp edge.</p><p>Seeing this, the little fox was momentarily stunned, then suddenly saw a familiar figure – Jian Yi, their long-lost friend.</p><p>That Jian Yi could force back several Nascent Soul experts with a single strike? Was this still the person they knew?</p><p>The overwhelming joy of reunion with an old friend, coupled with the shock of that single strike, deeply impacted the little fox and Qin Li.</p><p>Qin Li was still dazed, but the quick-witted little fox reacted instantly, prostrating himself and shouting, "Senior Jian, save us!"</p><p>Jian Yi nodded, his tone as always, "Go."</p><p>The little fox tugged Qin Li's clothes and silently retreated, watching as Jian Yi became one with his sword, soaring into the sky to face his multiple opponents fearlessly.</p><p>Even from a considerable distance, they could still feel the astonishing power behind them, as well as the enraged shouts of the Changyou clan experts.</p><p>The little fox was secretly alarmed, whispering, "The enemy likely has experts comparable to late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators." They had witnessed the strength of late-stage Nascent Soul cultivators on the battlefield.</p><p>"Jian…" Qin Li almost called him "Jian Xiong" (Brother Jian), quickly correcting himself, "Will Senior Jian be alright?"</p><p>"What's to worry? Senior Jian is clearly a powerful cultivator who interacts casually with the mortal world, and we've encountered him! Thankfully, we didn't bully him in the past because of his seemingly lower cultivation…"</p><p>The little fox looked fearful, yet also curious. "What do you think Senior Jian's real identity is? What powerful sword cultivators are there in Beihai?"</p><p>"Sword cultivators?"</p><p>Qin Li subconsciously thought of someone, exchanging a look with the little fox, clearly thinking of the same person.</p><p>"If it's him, we're set! This celestial fox is good friends with the head of the Qingyang Temple lineage, so who dares bully me anymore!"</p><p>The little fox's eyes gleamed with excitement, its furry tail wagging furiously.</p><p>As they envisioned their bright future, several booming sounds echoed from behind, followed by an unsettling silence.</p><p>Finally, Jian Yi returned alone, unharmed, leaving the fate of his enemies to be imagined.  His sword light enveloped the fox and Qin Li, swiftly fleeing north.</p><p>By this time, the Changyou clan's invasion of Beichen territory had already begun.</p><p>The battle hadn't lasted long before Minshan and the other elders sensed something was wrong. The counterattack from Beichen was far fiercer than anticipated, especially the number of Nascent Soul stage experts; far exceeding their estimates.</p><p>Their plan had relied on the Xuan Yue forces being at the city gates, forcing the Zhongzhou reinforcements to remain on the defensive to prevent any accidents with the ancient relocation array.  Even if they had suspicions, they wouldn't dare send all their forces to Beichen.</p><p>However, reality differed from their expectations. The Storm Realm seemed to have accurately predicted their movements.  The appearance of Li Yu Fu, Tong Ling Yu, Bao Zheng Nan, and others confirmed their suspicions.</p><p>Minshan was both shocked and furious, wondering where the leak had occurred.  All signs pointed to the various factions in Zhongzhou having their own agendas. The reinforcements hadn't arrived, and relying only on Beihai and its allies, how could they dare gamble so boldly?</p><p>At this point, retreat was impossible; they had to fight on.</p><p>West of Beichen, the two armies clashed. Dark clouds filled the sky, strange lights frequently erupted on the sea, and the cries of battle shook the heavens.</p><p>Min Zhuo knew the inside story, so the Changyou tribe didn't deploy their entire force, but even with the strength of the various Beihai sects, stopping the Changyou army was no easy task.</p><p>…</p><p>“Senior Jian Nu!”</p><p>Huan Hen returned, his true form restored.  His demeanor was still sharp and unmatched, but he had undergone a profound change.</p><p>Jian Nu showed approval, soaring into the air on his sword. “Come, let's fight!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Two sword lights, one after the other, charged towards the heart of the battle.  Most of the Storm Realm's Nascent Soul cultivators and the Changyou tribe's Sky Realm level one experts were engaged in a brutal fight here.</p><p>This was a battle of the strong; everyone else retreated, leaving a large expanse of sea empty around them.</p><p>Li Yu Fu knew that in a one-on-one fight, their side would be at a disadvantage.  He and Tong Ling Yu and the others stayed close together, supporting each other, barely holding their ground against the enemy's onslaught.  His eyes flickered, scanning the battlefield, seemingly waiting for a specific moment.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword light tore through the air, its incredibly sharp sword intent drawing everyone's attention.</p><p>Seeing the newcomer's aura, Minshan and the others were shocked.  When did the Storm Realm acquire another late Nascent Soul stage expert?</p><p>Jian Nu didn't speak, his sword intent locked onto a Changyou elder, charging forward relentlessly!</p><p>At the same time, Li Yu Fu's eyes flashed, shouting, “Activate the array!”</p><p>The booming voice echoed across the battlefield.  Numerous spirit flags were raised. This was an array Qin Sang had specially refined, modeled after the Heavenly River Reverse Killing Array; its power was beyond question.</p><p>Core disciples from Qingyang Temple and Xuantian Palace held the flags, spread across the battlefield.  Upon receiving the Grand Master's order, they raised the flags. Other cultivators simply followed orders, assisting them.  The array formed in an instant.</p><p>The battlefield, stretching for thousands of miles, was immediately shrouded in darkness, like a giant black dragon. Then, bright lights, like countless stars, appeared on the dragon's body.</p><p>Even in Beichen, it was visible. The west was plunged into eternal night, and stars rose from the horizon one by one.</p><p>The next moment, the stars trembled, bursting forth with bright starlight.  A meteor fell into the sea, followed by countless meteors forming a meteor shower, raining down from the sky.</p><p>The people of Beichen saw a beautiful meteor shower; the Changyou soldiers experienced a nightmare.</p><p>In the heart of the battle, Minshan and the others fell into chaos. The array's power disrupted their formations, and they also had to face the terrifying Jian Nu. Within moments, two elders were killed, pierced through by Jian Nu's sword.</p><p>Huan Hen, following Jian Nu, also killed a Changyou expert. His eyes shone brighter, feeling that this experience had been worthwhile. He finally saw a more beautiful scene, sensing his bottleneck beginning to loosen.</p><p>Then, he heard a sigh from Jian Nu.</p><p>Jian Nu was also pursuing a higher realm, but these enemies were too weak to hone his sword intent.</p><p>Unseen by those on the battlefield, two figures were facing each other in the high sky.</p><p>"Friend, if you don't make your move soon, the Changyou tribe will be defeated," Su Nu kindly reminded the other party.</p><p>The other person, wearing a hat that concealed their face, said indifferently, "I'm only responsible for stopping those of my level. Their incompetence is not my concern."</p><p>Su Nu's eyes flickered. "So, you are not an ally of the Changyou tribe, yet you intervene on their behalf. I wonder why?"</p><p>Seeing the other party remain silent, Su Nu's beautiful eyes scanned the area, and she suddenly smiled. "I found it! You wouldn't be hindering me for these people, would you?"</p><p>She flicked her finger, sending several subtle wisps of energy towards the edge of the battlefield.</p><p>Someone was watching the battle there, including a man surnamed Hong, the cultivator who had secretly defected to the Jiao Long King.  He had been instructed by the Jiao Long King to secretly collude with the Changyou tribe.</p><p>Hong and his men had arrived after receiving the news. The outcome of this battle determined whether they could obtain the Green Spirit Qi from the Changyou tribe.</p><p>Seeing the starlight continuously decimating the Changyou army, several people looked grave. Someone anxiously said, "The Changyou tribe is useless!"</p><p>"The array's power is too strong!"</p><p>Hong slowly shook his head, feeling something was wrong. Where had Beihai obtained these flags?</p><p>Their attention fixed on the battle, they didn't notice chain-like black markings appearing on their ankles.  They spread up their legs, covering their entire bodies.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>By the time they realized the danger, they were bound.</p>
