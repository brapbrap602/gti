<h1>Chapter 770: Ghost Land</h1><p>Chapter 770: Ghost Land</p><p>After the initial excitement, Qin Sang calmed down and fell into deep thought.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner wasn't something that could be refined just like that, at least not now.</p><p>Refining this treasure required three steps.</p><p>First, the Xuan Tie pillar needed to be smelted into the banner pole.</p><p>This process required a very complex spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang learned how to set up the array from Yi Tiannie.  Besides various spirit materials, there was an extremely demanding condition:  it required a high-grade spirit stone or a top-grade spirit stone to activate the array.</p><p>He dared not dream of a top-grade spirit stone, but high-grade spirit stones were also extremely rare. He only had two, which he needed to save for using the ancient teleportation array.</p><p>He always had to ensure he had two high-grade spirit stones on hand.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's decades of experience, high-grade spirit stones were even rarer in the Canglang Sea than in the Xiao Han region.</p><p>The higher the quality of the spirit stone, the greater its effect, and major factions never had enough.</p><p>In the Xiao Han region, when ancient cultivators' estates emerged from the ancient fairy battlefield, the first cultivators to enter might find several if they were lucky, with a small portion making their way out into circulation.  With diligent searching, there was still a chance to buy them.</p><p>High-grade spirit stones in the Canglang Sea were basically mined from spirit stone mines.  The few spirit stone mines were already occupied by major factions;  anything unearthed was immediately collected and treasured, almost impossible to get hold of.</p><p>Secondly, the banner flags needed to be refined.</p><p>Initially, the Kui Yin ancestor searched far and wide for secret methods, finally devising a cruel scheme:  imprisoning countless souls to condense the purest soul energy, refining it into threads, and weaving them into the banner flags!</p><p>To do this, the Kui Yin ancestor harmed countless people.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner Qin Sang planned to refine would be even larger than the Kui Yin ancestor's. If he followed the same method, he would truly become a notorious mass murderer.</p><p>He couldn't bring himself to kill countless innocent people, most of whom were commoners, without any reason.</p><p>Only after the complete Ten Directions Yama Banner was refined could he begin to subdue the Nine Nether Demon Fire and imprison it within the treasure.</p><p>The process of refining the banner pole was extremely complex and demanded a very high level of the refiner. Even if he had all the materials now, he couldn't refine it here.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire was right before him.</p><p>But the Ten Directions Yama Banner remained a mirage, just out of reach.</p><p>Even if he found high-grade spirit stones and soul threads to refine the treasure, he would still need to wait for the next opening of the Seven Killing Hall to come in and subdue the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched the Xuan Tie pillar in his hand, storing it in his Qianjun Ring, his expression returning to calm.</p><p>Although he couldn't obtain this powerful banner array now, at least he saw a glimmer of hope.</p><p>His cultivation wasn't weak in the cultivation world; with decades to search for high-grade spirit stones, he didn't believe he couldn't find any.  Soul threads were the most troublesome, but there might be other ways besides killing.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered his next steps.  He would definitely have to look for the ancient teleportation array and return to the Xiao Han region; this didn't conflict with refining the Ten Directions Yama Banner.</p><p>With the ancient teleportation array, he could travel freely between the two places.</p><p>Returning to the Xiao Han region would make gathering materials easier.</p><p>"This is a top-grade treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but sigh softly.</p><p>After decades of cultivation, the strongest treasure he had seen was only a mid-grade one. He had never even seen a high-grade treasure. It was said that top-grade treasures were also considered precious treasures even among Yuan Ying Masters.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how terrifying the power of a top-grade treasure would be and how much it would improve him.</p><p>Regardless, he had to refine this banner array!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang had placed the Ten Directions Yama Banner and the Nine Illusion Heavenly Orchid on equal footing as must-have items.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Nine Nether Demon Fire.</p><p>He was curious how this demon fire was born and why it remained in such a small crevice.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that the Nine Nether Demon Fire floated in the canyon, with layers of ancient restrictions on both sides of the cliffs and above, clearly not to be trifled with. He wondered if these ancient restrictions were what confined the demon fire.</p><p>When the Kui Yin ancestor saw the Nine Nether Demon Fire, he also found a Xuan Tie pillar that had broken into two pieces.</p><p>Qin Sang searched carefully but didn't see any similar treasure.</p><p>But an anomaly caught Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>Pressing his body against one side of the cliff, he discovered that there seemed to be a large space behind the Nine Nether Demon Fire, and strangely, instead of purple mist, there was greyish-white mist floating in that space, looking extremely eerie.</p><p>"This mistâ€¦"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.</p><p>Then, he cautiously took a step forward, attempting to pass through the Nine Nether Demon Fire and enter the space behind it.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire was suspended, its body didn't fill the entire canyon, seemingly leaving space to pass through. But these spaces were filled with the aura of the demon fire, extremely dangerous.</p><p>The Nine Nether Infernal Fire assaults the soul.  Approaching it, even Yuan Ying Masters wouldn't dare, risking instant annihilation.  Any disturbance could result in utter destruction.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, studying it intently.</p><p>Protected by his jade Buddha, his soul remained stable.  More importantly, he possessed a rudimentary understanding of the Nine Nether Infernal Fire, allowing him to manipulate a protective layer, shielding himself and masking his presence.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang believed he had a good chance of passing through and decided to risk it.</p><p>His determination stemmed from a familiarity with the greyish-white mist, resembling the ghostly fog encountered within the Celestial Tombs at the Ziwei Palace.  However, this mist was significantly thinner.</p><p>Areas shrouded in such fog often harbor vengeful spirits and ghosts. Refining these could provide the soul threads needed to complete his project, solving a major obstacle. These trapped creatures, existing for countless years in a haze of oblivion, have largely lost their sentience.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banner requires an immense quantity of soul threads; finding such a concentration of ghosts in the outside world is nearly impossible.  Such a ghostly realm only forms under specific conditions.</p><p>Pressing close to the rock face, Qin Sang observed for a considerable time. The space beyond the Nine Nether Infernal Fire appeared calm, the greyish-white mist flowing gently. Only by venturing inside could he determine if ghostly entities resided within.</p><p>Instead of rushing in, he summoned his Flying Night Rakshasa to scout ahead.  While the Nine Nether Infernal Fire didn't appear to be a seal, caution was warranted.  He wasn't certain if powerful ghost kings or similar entities might be lurking there.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa, a reanimated corpse, was ideally suited for this task, being of similar nature to the ghosts inside.</p><p>Serving as a shield for Qin Sang, the Flying Night Rakshasa had suffered significantly, riddled with holes from the Ziyou Pearl.</p><p>Qin Sang directed the Rakshasa to absorb earth-sha energy to aid its recovery, a task often postponed due to pressing circumstances.</p><p>Having summoned the Rakshasa, Qin Sang sat, retrieved his Shao Yin magnetic vial, and channeled his True Essence into the Rakshasa to accelerate its healing.</p><p>Complete recovery in such a short time was impossible.  Once the Rakshasa had healed to about 70%, Qin Sang stopped.  Its physical wounds were almost invisible, its corpse energy flowing freely, sufficient for most situations.</p>
