<h1>Chapter 1729: Demonic Eye</h1><p>The Poison Pearl successively devoured the Gu King and the poisonous smoke of the Myriad Poison Mountain's sacred artifact.</p><p>The two venomous energies fused within the Poison Pearl, recreating the primordial poison of the Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit. This infusion brought about a transformation, making the Poison Pearl far more potent than before.</p><p>After Qin Sang's refinement, the pearl's seven-colored radiance possessed two inherent powers: poison warding and poison application. Naturally, with this transformation, their potency greatly increased.</p><p>The venomous light's power was comparable to the abilities of a fifth-transformation Bloodthirsty Miasma Spirit during its life, potent enough to threaten even Nascent Soul-level ferocious beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang only unleashed the venomous light, not the Heaven Sundering Soul Needle.</p><p>The Heaven Sundering Soul Needle was originally a supreme poison technique. Cultivated with the venomous light, its power would surely be extraordinary.</p><p>Unfortunately, this divine ability was yet to be fully mastered. Qin Sang had too much on his plate, his energy divided amongst various pursuits. He could only prioritize his tasks and cultivate them gradually.</p><p>However, against an opponent like the Thunder Turtle, the venomous light might not be inferior to the Heaven Sundering Soul Needle.</p><p>The Heaven Sundering Soul Needle brought certain death or crippling injury. If the Thunder Turtle sensed a fatal threat, it would inevitably unleash its primal ferocity, either retaliating or evading. Such a situation was unpredictable. It was better to be subtle, like the venomous light, which worked silently.</p><p>Within the sword formation:</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered elusively, streams of incantations flowing continuously into the formation.</p><p>No matter where the Thunder Turtle charged, the starry sky revolved around it as if it were the center of the universe. However, this was no blessing.</p><p>The myriad sword stars flickered, their brilliance waxing and waning. Each time the starlight surged, beams of starlight descended.</p><p>In a flash, the starlight converged into a single, unified sword that pierced towards the Thunder Turtle!</p><p>Crackling sounds erupted from within the sword formation.</p><p>The light radiating from the Thunder Turtle was no less brilliant than the starlight. Bathed in thunder, its shell sometimes shrunk, returning to its back, and sometimes expanded dramatically, as if attempting to transform half the heavens into a sea of lightning.</p><p>Like a colossal beast bearing the weight of a thunder mountain, the Thunder Turtle rose in fury.</p><p>As its shell collided, the momentum of the light swords faltered, shattering into shimmering dust in the earth-shattering impact. The beast's ferocious savagery was on full display.</p><p>Such direct collisions couldn't leave the Thunder Turtle unaffected. Even if it could remain unscathed at its peak, its old wounds were inevitably torn open, oozing fresh blood.</p><p>This pain was nothing to the beast, its ferocity unwavering. But it failed to notice the venom seeping into its wounds.</p><p>Qin Sang used the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation to keep the Thunder Turtle occupied, gradually "delivering" the venomous light into its body. The Thunder Turtle's high cultivation and robust physique meant small amounts of venom had minimal effect, requiring a gradual approach.</p><p>The venom flowed through the Thunder Turtle's blood essence, silently infiltrating its internal organs. The more ferociously it retaliated, the more potent the venom would become when it finally took hold!</p><p>Unfortunately, the Thunder Turtle lacked the patience to be manipulated by Qin Sang.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang became increasingly adept, skillfully manipulating the sword formation, preparing to repeat his tactic, he suddenly sensed something amiss with the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>The creature raised its head high, its slender upper body taut, glaring at the starry river. A rustling sound emerged as its scales, previously unseen, stood on end and then detached from its body. Countless points of light shot out, not towards its prey, but towards its own shell.</p><p>The points of light seemed both real and illusory, like fist-sized thunder pearls. Carrying the Thunder Turtle's blood essence, they merged with its shell, emitting continuous crackling sounds.</p><p>After exploding, the points of light transformed into swirling mists of light, completely merging with the shell, causing visible changes.</p><p>The shell shrunk, the silvery-white thunder light tinged with crimson. A monstrous, terrifying power emanated from it as it swiftly transformed into a thunder disc.</p><p>The disc spun at high speed, shooting towards the starry river.</p><p>It left a striking trail of lightning across the night sky. The disc's residual waves formed bolts of lightning, scattering like fissures in space, or like a celestial scar splitting the starry river in two!</p><p>Even without the power to shatter the void, the thunder disc was an unparalleled divine ability, a fusion of the Thunder Turtle's blood essence and thunder power, not to be underestimated.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. He unhesitatingly stopped his incantations. Light and shadow flickered in his dantian, revealing the illusory form of the Mani Pearl. Without fully materializing, a mass of black flame detached from the pearl, reforming into a fire lotus before Qin Sang.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts commanded.</p><p>With astonishing speed, the fire lotus appeared before the thunder disc. Under the thunder's glow, the lotus seemed even more profound. The partially bloomed lotus slowly rotated, colliding head-on with the disc.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A dazzling flower bloomed within the vast starry river.</p><p>Half black, half silver.</p><p>Even the starlight couldn't obscure this extraordinary flower. The instant it appeared, it exploded, unleashing raging thunder from its silver half and an endless torrent of black fire from the other.</p><p>In an instant, the starry river trembled.</p><p>Half the sky turned inky black, engulfed in flames, while the other half shone like daylight, with thunder serpents dancing wildly.</p><p>The celestial thunder and black fire possessed a seemingly world-destroying power, devouring the sword stars. The myriad stars dimmed, flickering precariously, unable to resist.</p><p>Below, the Thunder Turtle recoiled, flung back by the impact of the collision. On the other side, Qin Sang was equally disheveled, his sword formation nearly collapsing.</p><p>Swords hummed.</p><p>A slender sword shadow materialized from the depths of the starry river – Qin Sang's Gray Warbler Sword. It too trembled, its true form forced out by the collision.</p><p>Qin Sang took a deep breath, quickly changing his incantations, reshaping the Seven Lunar Mansions. Suddenly, he heard a sharp shriek. The Thunder Turtle, truly formidable, stabilized itself and charged towards Qin Sang.</p><p>All that was visible was a blinding ball of lightning, but Qin Sang could sense within it a pair of ferocious, frenzied eyes, fixated on him, eager to devour.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm. With a flick of his finger, the Gray Warbler Sword vanished again. Points of starlight appeared around him, sword stars either reforming or being drawn from afar.</p><p>Though the Thunder Turtle drew closer, sword stars materialized between them. Without moving, Qin Sang seemed to infinitely increase the distance.</p><p>If his opponent were a Nascent Soul cultivator, they would struggle to even graze his robes. However, the Thunder Turtle's cultivation surpassed Qin Sang's. Like a rainbow, it pierced through the void with unstoppable momentum, overcoming skill with brute force.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>When the Thunder Turtle collided, it shattered another sword star and one of Qin Sang's sword spirit clones. Then it was once again enveloped by the starry river, its frustration and rage only expressible through roars.</p><p>Qin Sang steadfastly adhered to his strategy.</p><p>He certainly had other methods, such as summoning the Sun God Tree to counter the thunder disc. Six birds unleashed simultaneously would have been more effective than the fire lotus.</p><p>But the Sun God Tree consumed too much energy. Even at Nascent Soul, he could only unleash a few attacks.  In the turbulent Storm Belt, it was wiser to conserve his strength.</p><p>The battle seemed to have returned to its starting point.</p><p>Qin Sang moved continuously within the Seven Lunar Mansions, constantly utilizing the formation's power to manifest light swords and attack the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>The incessant harassment drove the Thunder Turtle into greater frenzy, making it less aware of the changes within its body.</p><p>Roars echoed like thunder.</p><p>Completely enraged, the Thunder Turtle became one with the lightning, transformed into a true thunderous beast, its ferocious aura unparalleled as it chased Qin Sang within the sword formation.</p><p>Wherever it passed, sword stars scattered, leaving clear trails across the starry river.</p><p>Yet, its aura was noticeably weaker than at the beginning, gradually depleted during the fight.</p><p>Qin Sang's energy was also dwindling, but he retained the initiative. Unnoticed, the poison within the Thunder Turtle had accumulated to a critical point!</p><p>Gazing at the rampaging Thunder Turtle within the formation, Qin Sang's eyes flashed. He reached towards the void, a sword materializing in his palm.</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword was in his hand.</p><p>The starry river suddenly dissipated, the sword stars extinguishing simultaneously.</p><p>The howling of the storm returned.</p><p>This wasn't land, making it difficult to discern how far they had traveled during the fight. But after reappearing, they were not far apart, facing each other directly!</p><p>The previous starry river seemed like an illusion. The Thunder Turtle shook its head, fixated on its prey, its eyes burning with extreme ferocity. Transforming into a massive ball of lightning, it charged fiercely.</p><p>A chill flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He made no attempt to dodge. The Gray Warbler Sword flickered, disappearing. Simultaneously, light and shadow flickered around the Thunder Turtle. Seven Qin Sangs appeared, each wielding a sword.</p><p>The swords pointed at the Thunder Turtle, then transformed into seven beams of sword light, intersecting above the creature's head.</p><p>Sensing the boundless killing intent and sword intent, the Thunder Turtle's ferocity surged, preparing to retaliate. Suddenly, something went wrong within its body.</p><p>While deploying the Seven Souls Killing Formation, Qin Sang silently activated the Poison Pearl, triggering the accumulated venomous light within the Thunder Turtle. The venom and the Seven Souls Killing Formation erupted simultaneously, one from within, one from without.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle's roar distorted, filled with pain.</p><p>Even its robust physique struggled against the potent venom. The thunder light surrounding it dimmed, its shell appearing thinner.</p><p>At that precise moment, the seven sword beams converged, slashing down!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Tiny cracks, almost invisible to the naked eye, appeared on the shell, then it shattered.</p><p>The sword light pierced through the shell, deep into the Thunder Turtle's body!</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>The Thunder Turtle let out a shriek of agony, its body drenched in blood.  Not only were there external sword wounds, but rampant sword energy also ravaged its insides. Still alive, it trembled violently, plunging into the sea.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Blood sprayed into the air, instantly swept away by the storm.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle thrashed in the sea, fear appearing in its frenzied eyes for the first time. It fled without looking back.</p><p>However, before it could escape far, blue light blocked its path. Two azure serpents coiled and danced, lunging towards the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>Having broken through to late Nascent Soul, Qin Sang's  Avatar, after years of refining the Azure Serpent Seal, could now control two serpents, though it still felt somewhat strenuous, unlike Yin Changsheng in his prime.</p><p>After surveying the surroundings, the Avatar confirmed there were no other ferocious beasts nearby, then came to assist.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body showed no intention of stopping either. The fire lotus arrived almost simultaneously with the azure serpents, descending from above. Flames instantly engulfed the sea, surrounding the Thunder Turtle.</p><p>The serpents spewed cold flames, complementing the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Avatar appeared, one in front, one behind, watching the Thunder Turtle below. One wielded the Gray Warbler Sword, controlling the demonic fire, the other with the Azure Serpent Seal above his head, his hands forming incantations.</p><p>The main body was the primary force, while the Avatar seized opportunities and hampered the Thunder Turtle's movements.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle's cries grew increasingly shrill, its massive body rolling within the flames, yet resembling nothing more than a death throe. Old wounds compounded by new ones, its body ravaged by poison and sword energy, it was no match for Qin Sang.</p><p>If Qin Sang hadn't intended to capture it alive, he would have already slain it!</p><p>Trapped between a wolf and a tiger, the Thunder Turtle had no chance of escape.</p><p>Qin Sang and his Avatar cooperated seamlessly, unleashing a barrage of divine abilities, continuously draining the Thunder Turtle's strength.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Gray Warbler Sword slashed through the air.</p><p>The Thunder Turtle desperately dodged, but couldn't evade the flanking azure serpents. With a 'boom,' its body stiffened, coated in a layer of ice.</p><p>Simultaneously, a figure flickered above. The Avatar unleashed a wave of icy煞energy. Ice Soul Divine Light swept across the Thunder Turtle, freezing it solid.</p><p>'Crack…'</p><p>Cracks spread across the profound ice.</p><p>Even weakened to this state, the Thunder Turtle remained incredibly fierce. The Avatar alone couldn't contain it.</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly. His main body seized the opportunity, beckoning with his hand. The demonic fire converged, transforming into a black rope that bound the Thunder Turtle tightly.  The demonic fire seeped into its wounds, attacking its vital points.</p><p>Then, with its sword energy soaring, the Gray Warbler Sword spun and slammed against the Thunder Turtle's head, knocking it unconscious. Qin Sang flashed over, his fingers like pincers, gripping the black rope and tightening it.</p><p>The Avatar withdrew its divine abilities and the Second Nascent Soul returned to the main body.</p><p>Dragging the Thunder Turtle, Qin Sang flew away, disappearing into the depths of the storm.</p><p>Unaware of whether other ferocious beasts lurked nearby, Qin Sang knew that some beasts in the Abyssal Ruins possessed strange and dangerous abilities, capable of sensing fluctuations from great distances. His true essence was greatly depleted, and he needed to leave the battlefield quickly.</p><p>…</p><p>As Qin Sang flew away, contemplating how to deal with the Thunder Turtle, he was entirely oblivious to the consequences of this battle within the Storm Belt.</p><p>After his departure, the blood-stained seawater was immediately swept away by the storm, returning to the impenetrable tempest and towering waves. The fierce battle left no trace.</p><p>Yet, as time passed, an unknown change began to occur within this area of the sea.</p><p>The change was incredibly slow, imperceptible even to someone continuously present. Only after a significant period would one suddenly realize the surroundings had transformed.</p><p>An unknown amount of time later, the seawater became faintly tinged with red. The color persisted despite the passing storms, indicating the change wasn't originating from the water itself.</p><p>Looking at the sky, a faint red glow had appeared, as if a red veil had been drawn across it. Even the hurricanes passing through were dyed crimson.</p><p>The eerie red glow gradually intensified, though still at an exceptionally slow pace, spanning months or even years.</p><p>A long, long time passed.</p><p>The area truly transformed into a sea of blood.</p><p>Finally, the source of the transformation became apparent. The red glow emanated from the vast heights above, a power that could penetrate even the storms.</p><p>Where the red light shone, the storm was suppressed. The hurricanes gained an unusual gentleness, their howling seemingly less harsh. But the Heavenly Dao's demonic whispers in this region became even more shrill and frenzied, as if infecting the very heavens and earth.</p><p>The red glow was most intense in the sky above.</p><p>If someone were standing on the sea surface now, looking up, they could clearly see the source of the red light, unobscured by the layers of hurricanes.</p><p>Like a faintly visible red moon hanging in the sky.</p><p>Or like a slowly opening demonic eye!</p><p></p>
