<h1>Chapter 754: Treacherous Situation</h1><p>Chapter 754: Treacherous Situation</p><p>“He was waiting for me!”</p><p>From the moment Qin Sang met Cui Ji and began traveling with him, he had been secretly on guard. Regardless of Cui Ji's intentions, he wouldn't give him any opportunity.  Surrounded by a throng of demonic creatures, escape was uncertain. Cui Ji's madness in instigating an internal conflict at this moment was unexpected.</p><p>Even stranger was how the Bone Lotus ended up in Cui Ji's hands.</p><p>Xiang Yi could be considered the strongest among the eight present. Qin Sang knew he wasn't a match for him, but even facing that subterranean beast, he shouldn't have died so quickly and lost his treasure, unless there was something else going on!</p><p>Suspicion filled Qin Sang's heart, and he suddenly felt a surge of unease.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish!’</p><p>A deluge of purple light filled Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>The purple light radiating from the Ziyou Pearl, capable of both softness and strength, had previously formed a cage, easily trapping the flying yaksha.  Now, it was like a sword's edge, intensely fierce.</p><p>The purple light was like a torrent; if struck, Qin Sang had no doubt his body would be riddled like a hornet's nest.</p><p>Cui Ji had been planning this, and Qin Sang was almost completely unprepared.  Especially since they were so close, and Qin Sang was surrounded by the Purple Star Eagles, Cui Ji's attack was perfectly timed, leaving no room to dodge.</p><p>Qin Sang's face hardened. His first reaction was to open the Corpse Puppet bag.</p><p>The flying yaksha had just leaped out when the purple light arrived.  Thick corpse energy gathered before the flying yaksha's chest. It positioned itself in front of Qin Sang, shielding him, its fierce eyes wide, fearless in death.</p><p>Unfortunately, the time given to the flying yaksha was too short. The corpse energy couldn't form a shield; it was pathetically thin and was instantly shattered by the purple light.</p><p>Only its body remained!</p><p>The flying yaksha's body was strong, but it had its limits. Cui Ji was at the peak of the mid-stage, stronger than twenty years ago, and the Ziyou Pearl's power was incomparable to what it was then.</p><p>‘Pff…'</p><p>The flying yaksha, using its body to withstand the purple light, instantly suffered several large holes, pierced by the light, a gruesome sight.</p><p>At the critical moment, although Qin Sang tried his best to get the flying yaksha to avoid vital areas, the situation was too dangerous; he couldn't, and didn't, pay attention to the flying yaksha's condition.</p><p>The flying yaksha blocked some of the purple light, buying Qin Sang precious time.</p><p>He frantically poured his true energy into the Golden Light Armor, his body glowing brightly as a thick armor solidified around him, like a warrior god.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang received a heavy blow, his face instantly turning pale, and he was sent flying, crashing hard into a Purple Star Eagle.</p><p>This Purple Star Eagle was the worst off; first injured by Qin Sang's impact, it was then pierced through the heart by a beam of purple light, instantly dying.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang was covered by the purple light along with several Purple Star Eagles.</p><p>‘Clang! Clang!’</p><p>The sharp sound of metal clashing suddenly rang out.</p><p>In the midst of the purple light, Qin Sang fell to the ground, groaning, his chest enveloped in purple light.  His face was devoid of color, his robe torn, revealing the Golden Light Armor beneath.</p><p>A deep dent was clearly visible on the chest of the Golden Light Armor, surrounded by numerous fine cracks radiating outwards.</p><p>Two beams of purple light had pierced the armor, striking the same spot.</p><p>The Golden Light Armor itself was damaged!</p><p>Without the Golden Light Armor, Qin Sang would be in serious trouble.</p><p>Cui Ji's sneak attack was too insidious. If Qin Sang hadn't reacted in time, the damage would have been far worse than just a dent and cracks.  This Golden Light Armor, whose material rivaled a mid-grade magic treasure, might have been destroyed.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Qin Sang forcibly suppressed the turmoil in his body, preparing to rise and regroup when, behind the purple light, a white light suddenly appeared—a flying dagger.</p><p>The white light was the blade's glow. The dagger, like autumn water, was faster than the purple light, striking towards Qin Sang's neck like lightning.</p><p>The dagger's lines were long and slender; the terrifying upward curve at the tip made it a truly deadly weapon!</p><p>Twenty years ago, Cui Ji didn't possess this treasure. It was a recent acquisition.</p><p>A flying dagger after the purple light!</p><p>This was the real killing blow, and it was extremely vicious; taking advantage of the moment when Qin Sang had just blocked the purple light and his mind was relaxed, it came with lightning speed, arriving in an instant!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. The appearance of the purple light was still within his control, so he hadn't released the two-headed… (The sentence cuts off)</p><p>It was too late to retreat!</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>A sword sang out, a wild, whistling sound.  A darkwood sword appeared, accompanied by a thunderclap.  Simultaneously, a dragon's spirit coiled around Qin Sang, radiating a brilliant red light.</p><p>He remained sprawled on the ground, unable even to rise, yet simultaneously activated his sword escape technique and the Nine Dragon Celestial Chariot talisman, unleashing incredible speed.</p><p>A flying dagger sliced towards his neck.</p><p>In that heart-stopping moment, Qin Sang sprang up. He’d felt the chilling touch of the blade, its icy edge grazing his skin.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang narrowly avoided a fatal blow, but still couldn't evade the dagger completely. He was wounded.</p><p>A searing pain shot through his shoulder as blood gushed forth. The dagger had sliced deep, severing flesh and nearly cleaving his arm at the shoulder, exposing bone.  The blade was crimson with blood.</p><p>Qin Sang's arm went limp.  His internal energy surged violently, flinging the spent dagger away.</p><p>Pain contorted Qin Sang's face. He gritted his teeth, glaring fiercely at Cui Ji.</p><p>Cui Ji was astonished. He knew Qin Sang possessed considerable speed, comparable to Xiang Yi, but he never imagined Qin Sang could unleash such explosive velocity – faster than ever before, enough to evade a killing blow.</p><p>Such an injury, while gruesome, wasn't critically serious for a cultivator.  Removing the lingering blade energy would allow for a swift recovery.</p><p>Yet Cui Ji smiled confidently, utterly composed.</p><p>Escape techniques couldn't change anything!</p><p>This was the Purple Mist Wasteland, unlike any other place.  Endless poisonous mist surrounded them.  That strike had not only severed Qin Sang's arm but also shattered his protective aura.</p><p>The poison mist, laced with blade energy, had already infiltrated Qin Sang's body.</p><p>Adding insult to injury!</p><p>The poison, deep within, was incurable.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang immediately cultivated his energy, suppressing the blade energy and forcefully expelling the poison.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither the Purple Star Eagle nor Cui Ji would grant him that opportunity.</p><p>Cui Ji retracted his dagger with a flick of his wrist.  It was a precious magical artifact, obtained at great cost, and he feared Qin Sang might contaminate it with some uncanny method.</p><p>"Demon, today is your death day!"</p><p>Cui Ji's expression was frenzied, unrestrained in his malice.</p><p>He held the Purple Gloom Orb, launching another fierce attack, allowing Qin Sang no respite.  He didn't need to kill with his own hands; all he had to do was keep the fight going, and Qin Sang would succumb to the poison.</p><p>Being forced into such a perilous situation by a cultivator of the same realm was a rare experience. After achieving the Golden Core stage, Qin Sang, using various methods, had generally dominated opponents of similar strength.</p><p>Even Qin Sang had to admire Cui Ji's cunning planning, impeccable timing, and the devastating power of his killing blow, which had shattered his defenses.</p>
