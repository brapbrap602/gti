<h1>Chapter 2026: A Difficult Situation</h1><p>Dark clouds loomed overhead, and everyone hastily fled as lightning repeatedly struck.</p><p>Upon crossing a certain boundary, the clouds and lightning vanished behind them.  The sky remained gloomy, but the sea was calm, and the danger seemed to have passed.</p><p>However, just as everyone breathed a sigh of relief and prepared to continue, the sky ahead grew darker, the void trembled, and ripples appeared on the sea's surface.  The front suddenly plunged into complete darkness.</p><p>"Rumble…"</p><p>Darkness descended.</p><p>Everyone stared intently, only to see black water blotting out the sky and sun, surging like a tide, rushing towards them.</p><p>Without a moment to spare, everyone hastily engaged in battle.</p><p>Qin Sang, wielding the Grey Warbler Sword held inverted before him, kept his attention on the Young Master Xin.  He saw the Young Master Xin give an order, gathering the Xin family cultivators around her.</p><p>Then, a shadowy figure, vaguely human-shaped, emerged from behind the Young Master Xin. Its legs were at her feet, and the upper part of its body rested against the back of a Xin family cultivator beside her. It mimicked the Young Master Xin's posture, moving with her steps, but this shadow was alive.</p><p>"Is this the Shadow Spirit?"</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly astonished. In his perception, the Shadow Spirit's body wasn't solid, yet it wasn't like a typical spirit body.  An uninformed person might mistake it for a real shadow.</p><p>This shadow, called the Shadow Spirit, possessed powerful abilities. It was unclear whether it was inherently a shadow or a unique being able to merge with the Young Master Xin's silhouette.</p><p>Some believe that humans are born with shadows, more than just simple light and shade.  In some legends, shadows are imbued with various mystical powers, leading to concepts such as a Shadow God.</p><p>The black tide surged, and the Shadow Spirit raised an arm, using its hand like a blade to cleave downwards at the black tide!</p><p>"Splash!"</p><p>A gap was cleaved open in the black tide. The Xin family cultivators, working together to control a flying artifact, rushed through the opening before it could close.</p><p>Whenever they were about to be swallowed by the black tide, the Shadow Spirit would strike with its arm, using only simple slashing techniques to guide everyone through the waves, without displaying any further abilities.</p><p>Beyond the black tide, further trials awaited, one after another, relentlessly, giving no respite. Fortunately, these crises, while difficult, were no more powerful than the previous crescent moon lightning.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng, Qin Sang, and the Xin family's Shadow Spirit—effectively three Nascent Soul cultivators working together—safely navigated the numerous challenges and finally saw a different scene in the next space.</p><p>All the spaces, regardless of their dangers, had been uniformly black seas.  The same was true ahead, but in the boundless black sea, shadows rose from the surface, undulating – islands.</p><p>The islands were numerous, hundreds visible within sight alone, with countless more beyond. The islands were barren, devoid of buildings or even a single plant – just bare, rocky islands.</p><p>The rocky islands stood densely, varying in size, the largest no bigger than a mountain.</p><p>Facing this "archipelago," everyone, having just overcome numerous obstacles, became wary. After some time, they discovered that the islands simply stood quietly before them.</p><p>Desolate, lonely!</p><p>Confirming the absence of immediate danger, everyone carefully observed the archipelago.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang felt an inexplicable, strange sensation, as if the archipelago was alive, ready to spring to life, transforming into stone figures and rushing towards them.</p><p>This feeling didn't originate from a single island, but from the archipelago as a whole. The islands seemed to form an array.</p><p>He was certain these islands were unusual and should not be entered recklessly, but some things remained uncertain. He couldn't sense any spiritual array fluctuations from the islands, nor had he ever seen such an array.</p><p>Qin Sang clasped his hands behind his back, remaining composed, gently stroking his Qianjun Ring with his left hand.</p><p>Just now, the Qianjun Ring's fluctuations had suddenly intensified. Qin Sang clearly sensed that the source of the disturbance lay deep within the archipelago.</p><p>"If it's just a simple illusionary array, relying on the Qianjun Ring's fluctuations should be enough to find my way…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused, glancing at Young Master Xin and Pei Gongfeng.</p><p>If he were to leave the group and act alone, he would need a plausible excuse.  Moreover, the dangers within remained unknown; it was best to remain calm for now.</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his curiosity, then saw Young Master Xin fly forward, looking somewhat anxious.</p><p>"Is it here?" Pei Gongfeng's eyes flashed as he pursued and asked.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded slightly, took a deep breath, and said, "This should be the place my father spoke of. We've finally found it! But we still need to verify…"</p><p>Speaking, Young Master Xin surveyed the islands, silently calculating before settling on one.</p><p>"Whoosh! Whoosh!"</p><p>Everyone flew to the island.</p><p>This island is one of the outermost, its terrain treacherous, like a drawn sword pointing to the heavens.</p><p>Young Master Xin gazed at the island, his eyes gleaming.  He was about to fly towards the back of the mountain when he suddenly remembered something.  Turning to Qin Sang and Elder Pei, he said confidently, "This is the place! I'm sure of it!"</p><p>He produced a scroll, slowly unfurling it to reveal a painting.  The painting, clearly remounted, was on an unknown animal hide—clearly not a modern work.</p><p>The painting was masterfully simple, using only basic lines, difficult for the average person to understand.  However, in one corner, a few strokes depicted a mountain remarkably similar to the one before them.</p><p>After careful comparison, Qin Sang noticed a slight difference. The painting likely showed the back of the mountain.</p><p>Young Master Xin was about to verify this at the rear of the mountain.  He said solemnly, "Once we cross this point, things might change. Elder Pei, Elder Qin, if we encounter danger, I will rely on your assistance!"</p><p>"Leave it to us," Qin Sang and Elder Pei replied readily, summoning their spiritual treasures to protect the Xin family cultivators.</p><p>Young Master Xin nodded and flew towards the back of the mountain, followed by the others.</p><p>As expected, as they flew over the island, the weather turned violently.</p><p>In an instant, a howling wind obscured the sky and earth, thunder rumbled, and the sea churned.  Not only did the environment change dramatically, but the surrounding islands also became blurry.</p><p>A feeling of unease settled over the group. An invisible pressure bore down on them, forcing them to lower their altitude and fly close to the sea.  They realized their spiritual senses and vision were also limited.</p><p>The farther away they looked, the harder it was to see the islands clearly.  They appeared to shift and change, making the environment increasingly mysterious and unpredictable.</p><p>Fortunately, the formation did not attack them.  After landing behind the mountain, they compared the landscape to the painting, and every detail matched.</p><p>Looking at the surroundings and then at the painting, a completely different perspective emerged.  The chaotic lines all found their counterparts, revealing that the "treasure map" was actually a formation chart.</p><p>But Elder Pei quickly noticed a flaw, frowning. "This map seems incomplete."</p><p>Indeed, the depicted area did not extend much beyond their current field of vision. Yet, from what they had seen, the archipelago was far larger. This map alone wouldn't lead them to the center.</p><p>Unless the core of the archipelago wasn’t in the center, there must be other maps; this was just one piece.</p><p>"Don't worry, Elder Pei! Father said we'll find a way once we reach this point."</p><p>Young Master Xin pointed to a location on the map, determined the route, and immediately set off. The others followed, navigating between islands against wind and waves.</p><p>Contrary to their expectations, the journey wasn't fraught with peril.  They traveled for a considerable time without encountering any danger, seemingly navigating only a complex illusionary formation.  Guided by the map, they understood the formation's shifts and were not concerned about getting lost.</p><p>Their destination grew closer.</p><p>As they passed between two islands, Young Master Xin's brow furrowed. Qin Sang and Elder Pei also sensed something, and immediately ordered a halt.  The Grey Warbler Sword and the Jade Ruyi flew out simultaneously, their combined light striking a point in the void.</p><p>"Bang!"</p><p>The void twisted, a dull thud like flesh being struck echoed out, and then a greyish figure tumbled down.</p><p>The figure, resembling a tiger-leopard hybrid, was clearly injured, crashing onto a mountainside. It rolled clumsily, but without a sound, immediately attempting to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang and Elder Pei wouldn’t let it get away. The Grey Warbler Sword sent out four beams of light, trapping it. The Jade Ruyi descended, firmly imprisoning the creature.</p><p>Then, something bizarre occurred. The creature, struggling in vain, suddenly burst like a bubble, leaving only a thumbnail-sized jade fragment held within the Jade Ruyi. Everyone stared at each other in bewilderment.</p><p>"What is this thing?" Elder Pei frowned, examining the fragment.</p><p>"It doesn't seem like a living creature," Qin Sang mused, recalling the creature's behavior.</p><p>The jade fragment, slightly cloudy, emitted an ancient aura. It seemed to be a shard from an ancient jade piece, yet this fragment could transform into a living being—a truly strange occurrence.</p><p>Young Master Xin took the fragment, her brow furrowed deeply. She clearly knew something but offered no explanation, only increasing their speed.</p><p>No further obstacles were encountered, and they reached their destination without incident.</p><p>Before them lay an island-mountain, split in two, forming a deep gorge.  </p><p>Carefully, the group flew into the canyon, encountering vegetation for the first time.</p><p>A stream flowed through the gorge, black water gushing from its source into the sea.  On either side grew strange spirit trees.</p><p>These trees were only a little taller than a man, yet their trunks were incredibly thick, like round wooden stumps.  Thin branches sprouted from the top, bearing black leaves the size of a palm, their veins a golden color, like inlaid gold threads.</p><p>"Elder Qin, please have a look,"  Xin Shaozu beckoned Qin Sang forward.</p><p>Qin Sang had been staring at the trees since entering the gorge.  "In the jade scroll, the unnamed spirit wood used to build the ship... is this it?"</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>Xin Shaozu nodded.  "These trees only grow here. Elder Qin, please gather materials and craft the boat here."</p><p>"Does Shaozu mean that a boat made from this wood will allow us to reach the center of the archipelago?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>He gazed across the gorge; beyond a narrow opening, the shadows of several islands were visible.</p><p>Inside the formation, the Qianjun Ring reacted even more strongly. He could pass through the maze without any boat, but he wasn't sure if the ring pointed to the archipelago's center.</p><p>"It should be so…"</p><p>Xin Shaozu frowned, looking towards the source of the black spring.</p><p>The water gurgled from the spring's eye. She darted to the edge, her spiritual energy forming a large hand to probe the spring, but she only pulled out sand and stones.</p><p>Unsatisfied, she tried several more times before sighing, "As I feared!"</p><p>"What's going on!"  Pei Gongfeng demanded.</p><p>Xin Shaozu produced a jade fragment. "My father said this place not only grows the wood for the ship but also held a jade disc.  By incorporating the disc into the ship during construction, we could freely traverse this formation and reach our destination.  But the disc is gone…"</p><p>At these words, everyone looked at the jade fragment in Xin Shaozu's hand.</p><p>Clearly, the disc had shattered and undergone a strange transformation, becoming those eerie jade spirits.</p><p>"So, we need to find all those jade fragments to build the boat?" Pei Gongfeng and Qin Sang exchanged glances, both looking troubled.</p><p>The disc was shattered into countless pieces; they had only encountered one jade spirit so far.</p><p>Furthermore, they only possessed a portion of the formation map.  If the jade spirits wandered elsewhere, they couldn't recklessly explore, and without the fragments, they couldn't build the boat, creating a deadlock.</p><p>"It's our only option."</p><p>Xin Shaozu said helplessly.  "Hopefully, finding some fragments will allow us to create a rudimentary boat, granting some power.  We can then use it to hunt more jade spirits until we collect all the pieces of the disc.  Elder Qin, focus on building the hull here; we'll go look for the fragments."</p><p>Pei Gongfeng disagreed with Xin Shaozu's plan. He said calmly, "In my opinion, this place is full of strange things, and it's related to the Witch Clan. There might be hidden dangers. It's better not to split up. Elder Qin, let's hunt jade spirits together first, then you can craft the boat later."</p><p>"I fear we don't have much time."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, pointing to the spirit trees by the spring. "Didn't Pei Gongfeng notice? The leaves of these trees are withering; their spiritual essence is fading."</p><p>Everyone was startled. They looked closely and, as Qin Sang said, the leaves had lost a subtle amount of their luster.</p><p>"Why are they withering now of all times?" Pei Gongfeng's sharp gaze swept over Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang simply stated the facts, "Perhaps our intrusion triggered some mechanism. The formation has begun to operate, though we haven't noticed it yet."</p><p>They didn't know what changes would occur after the trees withered completely.</p><p>Xin Shaozu didn't dare delay. "The trees are withering!  Please, seniors, gather the materials quickly. I don't understand crafting; I'll take people to hunt the jade spirits."</p><p>Pei Gongfeng frowned at Xin Shaozu's retreating back and suddenly called out, "Wait! Elder Qin alone is sufficient.  Two people can protect him; I'll go with you."</p><p>"Thank you, Senior Pei," Xin Shaozu rejoiced.</p><p>Seeing the joy on Xin Shaozu's face, Pei Gongfeng's gaze shifted between Qin Sang and Xin Shaozu.</p><p>Xin Shaozu left alone, yet Qin Sang remained silent.</p><p>Pei Gongfeng's doubts deepened; he found himself at a loss for what to do.</p>
