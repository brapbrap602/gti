<h1>Chapter 1519: The Shelter</h1><p>The Tip of Heaven.</p><p>Where Tianyue Daoist erected his sword.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the sword, gazing at the storm belt.  He addressed Tan Hao beside him, “The demon race has lost many powerful figures. They likely won’t dare to stir up trouble outside the Demon Realm for a while. You find a nearby island to consolidate your cultivation. I’ll go in and look for the shelter.”</p><p>After his breakthrough, Tan Hao took only a short rest before eagerly following Qin Sang here.  They detoured north through the Crescent Moon Realm, following the Star Sand Archipelago to the Tip of Heaven.  Along the way, they surprisingly didn’t encounter a single demon soldier, a stark contrast to Qin Sang’s last visit.</p><p>On their journey, Qin Sang visited several cultivator friends he knew, revealing his true identity. He received a warm welcome, especially from the cultivators of the Star Sand Archipelago, who had been severely oppressed by the demon race. They were immensely grateful to him.</p><p>“I still can’t believe that in just a few years, Brother Qin has accomplished such great deeds…” Tan Hao shook his head and chuckled wryly.  He couldn’t describe the shock he felt upon learning the truth.  He was stunned for a long time, the excitement and pride of his breakthrough completely gone.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, summoning the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Shuttle. It transformed into a green light and entered the storm belt.  The treasure truly was extraordinary; Qin Sang’s spiritual energy consumption was much slower than last time. Seated within the shuttle, regardless of the ferocity of the storm outside, his body remained steady as a rock. If he’d had the shuttle last time, he wouldn’t have been chased by Bi Fang for thousands of miles.</p><p>Guided by the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn, Qin Sang steered the shuttle through the storm, alternating with the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to observe their surroundings.  Logically, finding the first shelter after leaving the Tip of Heaven shouldn’t be difficult. However, despite possessing so many treasures and having perused the Xuan Tian Palace's collection of texts, Qin Sang searched for a long time without success.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the shelter might have been deliberately destroyed or sealed by Tianyue Daoist.  However, Tianyue Daoist’s aim was to protect the North Star Realm and prevent the North Sea cultivators from becoming too powerful and launching a large-scale invasion. He wouldn't likely cut off the escape route of his homeland.</p><p>So he took Tan Hao back to the North Star Realm.  Instead of rushing back to Green Sheep Temple, he visited Lu Boyuan to gather information, cross-referencing texts from both realms. Then, after countless journeys back and forth, relying on the Moon Gazing Rhinoceros Horn and the shuttle, he finally made a discovery!</p><p>He didn't know how many shelters originally existed along the ancient road, but Qin Sang only found one.</p><p>A stone hall floating on the sea.</p><p>Built from massive stones, it was rough and heavy, yet as light as a feather, rising and falling with the waves. It wasn't fixed in one place, but moved randomly within a radius of a hundred miles.  Some unknown force constrained the stone hall, preventing it from exceeding this range. When it reached the edge, it was as if it encountered an invisible wall and bounced back.</p><p>With the stone hall as a resting place, Tan Hao could travel between the two realms.  Taking disciples would be somewhat difficult, and even taking late Golden Core disciples couldn't guarantee their safety.</p><p>Inside the stone hall.</p><p>It was empty, with four pillars in each corner providing the only support.  There were no walls, offering an unobstructed view of the outside scenery.  Enormous waves crashed against the stone hall incessantly from all sides.  The hurricane and waves were terrifying, as if they could tear apart everything in the world.  The stone hall swayed precariously, yet remained incredibly sturdy, an invisible barrier isolating it from the impact and the noise, creating an unusual tranquility.</p><p>The monotonous storm was really nothing to look at.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao rested in the stone hall, and after discussion, decided to search for a while longer. For Qin Sang, it wasn't a waste of time. As he searched for the shelter, he became increasingly proficient, attempting to multitask—controlling the shuttle while cultivating the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus* and refining the demonic fire. This was something he planned to do on his journey to the Central State.</p><p>The spiritual energy in the storm belt was chaotic, making it impossible to cultivate while traveling. Fortunately, refining the demonic fire wasn't affected by external factors. If he could refine all the demonic fire in the demon banner, he could not only create a powerful, completely unique divine ability, but his spiritual sense would also greatly increase.</p><p>Having adjusted their state, Qin Sang and Tan Hao once again flew out of the stone hall, beginning their long search.  In the dim storm belt, on the turbulent sea, a single green light darted like a fish, appearing and disappearing.</p><p>Suddenly, the green light stopped.  Three figures emerged from it—Qin Sang, Tan Hao, and his avatar.  The avatar had been controlling the shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang lowered his head, sweeping his gaze downward, fixing on a spot on the sea.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A grey hurricane had just blown past, leaving a deep chasm in the sea.  The water walls on both sides closed in, creating monstrous waves and an astonishing pressure.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly swooped down, plunging into the water wall.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly, somehow perched on his shoulder, spread its wings. Its eyes, focused on the depths of the chasm, detected an anomaly invisible to others.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A sword beam shot out like lightning.</p><p>The beam, which should have pierced the chasm, was suddenly obstructed mid-flight.</p><p>Crimson light blazed forth from above, like a volcanic eruption, engulfing the sword light.</p><p>A look of intense surprise appeared on Tan Hao's face. Only with the crimson light's eruption did he realize the existence of a shelter there.</p><p>"What a well-hidden ancient barrier!"</p><p>Dodging another gust of wind, Qin Sang let out a soft breath, sighing with relief.  Without the Tianmu Butterfly, he would have certainly overlooked this place.</p><p>Two days later.</p><p>Qin Sang and Tan Hao opened the ancient barrier and entered. They found an underwater islet, its edges severely eroded, only the core area protected by the barrier remaining.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and nodded silently. With this stone hall and islet, Tan Hao could barely manage the comings and goings of the Golden Core disciples, preventing the two Qingyang Observatories from becoming too isolated.</p><p>Four years had passed since his initial entry into the storm zone.</p><p>Less than three years remained until Liuli's tribulation.</p><p>There was no time to search for a third shelter; the remaining tasks needed to be expedited.</p><p>Qin Sang drew a sea chart, giving it to Tan Hao. The two then left the storm zone, crossed the desert and the Tianxing League, heading straight for Xiaohan Territory.</p><p>Though much had happened in the North Sea, Qin Sang had only been gone about twenty years.</p><p>A short time for a cultivator.</p><p>However, much had transpired in the Beichen Realm recently.</p><p>The most shocking event was the fall of Grandmaster Canghong at the Abyss Ruins.</p><p>As time went on, the Abyss Ruins, having lost the Sin God Palace, became increasingly unstable and dangerous. Grandmaster Canghong frequently entered the ruins, narrowly escaping several times, but ultimately succumbed.</p><p>The Demon Lord Tongyou had also been in seclusion for many years, with no news. Rumours suggested he was attempting a life-or-death seclusion, a final, desperate gamble.</p><p>The prominent figures of the previous generation in the Beichen Realm, had either ascended or perished, becoming a part of history.</p><p>Qingyang Observatory.</p><p>Before the Sword Qi Cliff.</p><p>Newly initiated disciples, their faces still youthful, looked up with reverence at the inscriptions Qin Sang had carved with sword qi.</p><p>Tan Yi'en, humbling himself, personally explained them.</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>I used two days of annual leave and am currently on my way back. I'm writing a chapter in the car.</p><p>It turns out that as one grows older, vacations become the most tiring.</p><p>I haven't been home since the New Year. My parents' health hasn't been good, and I didn't have time for a check-up when I visited during the Mid-Autumn Festival. This time, everything's crammed together.  Plus, there's so much work and socializing to catch up on; these few days have been incredibly rushed.</p><p>Updates haven't been consistent. Several times, I've gotten up in the middle of the night to finish writing.</p><p>I'm not yet middle-aged or married; I can hardly imagine what the most difficult times of life will be like.</p><p>Last night, I couldn't hold on any longer and slept until I got on the car today.</p><p>Tomorrow, I'll get back on track and do my best to catch up. Thank you for your understanding, readers.</p>
