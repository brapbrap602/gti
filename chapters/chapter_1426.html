<h1></h1><p>This differed from Qin Sang's previous judgment.</p><p>Wasn't Ghost Mother an old monster from the ancient era?</p><p>Such an expert couldn't be unknown; why were there no legends of her in the North Sea?</p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded, just about to say something, when he suddenly remembered something.</p><p>Reuniting with an old friend, in his surprise, he almost forgot the most important thing, and hurriedly asked, "Brother Qin, how did you get in?"</p><p>Qin Sang raised his head and pointed to the sky, "Naturally, I broke through the array. Didn't you?"</p><p>Tan Hao smiled wryly and said repeatedly, "That's terrible! Brother Qin, you don't know, this Pure Sea Sect is itself a huge seal. According to my predecessor, the submarine lava veins within a thousand miles of the surrounding area were moved here by an ancient great power using great magical powers, gathering a shocking amount of Scarlet Flame aura, which could erupt at any time. Now the seal is on the verge of collapsing, and Senior Ghost Mother hesitated for a long time, coming up with an unconventional method to minimize the damage to the seal as much as possible before daring to enter. With the sect-protecting grand array broken, I'm afraid…"</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang wasn't surprised.</p><p>The various signs he had discovered after entering the Pure Sea Sect had already led him to a similar guess.</p><p>"I'm not the only one who came in; there's also Old Demon Hunmo and others, who are probably already searching for treasures everywhere. How long can the Pure Sea Sect's seal last?"</p><p>"Old Demon Hunmo, he's here too!"</p><p>Tan Hao obviously knew Old Demon Hunmo's reputation and was shocked when he heard this, "The seal is already extremely fragile and tottering. The restrictions in the Buddhist Pagoda, Golden Peak, and Medicine Garden are all part of the seal, like weak pillars. Destroying any one of them will damage the seal and make matters worse. That's why Senior only took away a portion of the treasures; the rest were intended to be taken by me after I formed my Nascent Soul, as a form of tempering. Just now, Brother Qin, you were probably picking spiritual herbs, right? I thought it was a tremor caused by the Scarlet Flame impact on the seal; I didn't expect it had already been exposed."</p><p>The most precious treasures in the Pure Sea Sect had already been taken away by Ghost Mother.</p><p>The spiritual herbs, such as the Spirit Lamp Flower, left for Tan Hao, which Ghost Mother didn't consider worth her attention, were still enough to make Nascent Soul cultivators envious.</p><p>Ghost Mother's strength was evident.</p><p>Qin Sang was thoughtful.</p><p>No wonder Qi Wang and the other two suddenly found the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Calculating the time, the anomaly was caused when Tan Hao and Ghost Mother entered. However, the anomaly lasted for too short a time, and the situation in the Pure Sea Sect was complicated, so they ignored it.</p><p>"Senior Ghost Mother isn't here? I also want to ask her to save someone."</p><p>Qin Sang looked around and explained his intention.</p><p>He wasn't so interested in the treasures in the Pure Sea Sect; he was eager to see Ghost Mother and ask if Dumb Girl could be saved. Judging from Tan Hao's tone, Ghost Mother not only kept her promise but was also very kind to him, so her nature must be good.</p><p>Dumb Girl's situation was similar to Tan Jie's.</p><p>They were both implanted with Celestial Corpse Talismans during the Qi Refining stage and had long exceeded their lifespan.</p><p>Whether the result was good or bad, there had to be an end.</p><p>"You too…"</p><p>Tan Hao was stunned and looked at Tan Jie's grave with pity, regretting, "Brother Qin, you're one step late. Senior has already left the North Sea."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned and hurriedly asked, "Did she go to the Beiming Territory?"</p><p>"No," Tan Hao shook his head and hesitated for a moment before saying, "Senior said she was going to a place called Central Province; I don't know where it is either. After returning to the North Sea, she was constantly looking for a sea chart, even infiltrating the Xuantian Sect and causing a great disturbance. Breaking into the Pure Sea Sect was also for this purpose. After successfully obtaining the sea chart, she immediately set off. Leaving me in the Pure Sea Sect was because it's hidden enough, and the Pure Sea Sect is extremely strange; the sounds of morning bells and evening drums ring out every day, which can purify the spirit and benefit my breakthrough…"</p><p>Central Province.</p><p>Ghost Mother caused a great disturbance in Xuantian Palace.</p><p>Tan Hao's words contained a great deal of information.</p><p>Qin Sang had questioned the name of the North Sea when he learned of it. What was the 'North' in relation to?</p><p>It seemed that Central Province was another cultivation world.</p><p>He wondered what kind of world it was, whether it was a similar cage or had a different scenery.</p><p>The Pure Sea Sect actually had a sea chart leading to Central Province!</p><p>Its origins were not simple.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced, and he asked Tan Hao, learning that he hadn't seen the sea chart.</p><p>It was indeed a pity; he was one step late, not only missing the opportunity to save Dumb Girl but also missing the sea chart.</p><p>However, Ghost Mother's initial target was Xuantian Palace. Could it be that Xuantian Palace also treasured a sea chart leading to Central Province?</p><p>The Xuantian Palace dominated a territory and had been prosperous for a long time, so the possibility was high.</p><p>Wait…</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered the mysterious ice chest in the Qianjun Ring. Could that white-clothed man have stolen it from there during the chaos in Xuantian Palace?</p><p>He hadn't expected that his experiences in the North Sea could be connected through Ghost Mother.</p><p>"I'm a little confused; what exactly are Senior Ghost Mother's origins?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly.</p><p>Tan Hao hesitated for a moment and decided to tell Qin Sang everything. Although the resurrection of Tan Jie had failed, it couldn't erase Qin Sang's kindness to them.</p><p>He was never an ungrateful person.</p><p>Ghost Mother hadn't forbidden him from revealing it.</p><p>Knowing that Old Demon Hunmo had appeared in the Pure Sea Sect, Tan Hao was well aware that those treasures no longer belonged to him.</p><p>"I heard Senior mention that she's not a cultivator of this era; she used to slumber here."</p><p>Tan Hao looked down at his feet.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, it seemed his guess was correct.</p><p>Tan Hao continued, "In addition, there's also a demon sealed here. The Pure Sea Sect was the guardian of the seal."</p><p>Another demon!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. He thought to himself that he was really cursed by ancient demons. Others couldn't see one in their entire lives, but he had already encountered three!</p><p>"Back then, an accident occurred with the seal. The Pure Sea Sect did everything in its power to stabilize the seal, and the entire sect perished. Senior Ghost Mother also awakened because of that incident. After awakening, she was constantly looking for someone. After regaining some of her strength, she went to the Beiming Territory to search, but unexpectedly encountered Celestial Lord Tianyue, fought a great battle, and was sealed into the Abyss Ruins by Celestial Lord Tianyue."</p><p>The content Tan Hao spoke of was Ghost Mother's experiences before being trapped in the water prison, and then he explained, "When we returned to the North Sea, Senior first went to Xuantian Palace, unwilling to break into the Pure Sea Sect, also because she was worried that the demon was not dead and would cause a great mistake. Fortunately, the demon didn't appear… Hmm! At least, there's no longer any aura of the demon in the seal."</p><p>Celestial Lord Tianyue.</p><p>That fierce man who fought all over the North Sea and erected a sword in the corner of the sky!</p><p>Even ancient cultivators were not his opponents.</p><p>Celestial Lord Tianyue probably regarded Ghost Mother as an intruder who was breaking the rules.</p><p>Qin Sang silently mourned for Ghost Mother in his heart.</p><p>"Who is Ghost Mother looking for?"</p><p>Qin Sang interrupted Tan Hao and asked.</p><p>Could it be that there are other old monsters lurking in the cultivation world, who usually don't show their faces?</p><p>Thinking of Bai, thinking of the Jade Bone Demon, thinking of Ghost Mother, Qin Sang thought the possibility was high.</p><p>This world held too many secrets.</p><p>"Senior said she was looking for descendants of the Wu Clan, but the North Sea and Beiming Territory are both dominated by humans."</p><p>As Tan Hao spoke, a confused and doubtful expression appeared on his face.</p><p>He only knew the what, not the why. It was from Ghost Mother that he first learned about the Wu Clan.</p>
