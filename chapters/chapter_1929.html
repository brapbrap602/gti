<h1>Chapter 1920: Altar Formation</h1><p>Qin Sang stood at the entrance of the stone grotto, sensing the ancient aura emanating from within.</p><p>Before him was an ancient altar.</p><p>The three-tiered altar was constructed from a special material, meticulously refined stone, its surface etched with intricate thunder patterns, imbued with an archaic charm.</p><p>This altar wasn't as grand as the ones Qin Sang had seen in the Left and Right Mansions of Thunder, but it was still the size of a house.</p><p>Only the bottom tier of the three-tiered altar remained relatively intact. The upper two tiers were severely damaged, the third reduced to a few broken stones.</p><p>Because of this, the altar's power was completely gone.</p><p>On the altar were some incongruous stone slabs, also inscribed with dense runes, but clearly much cruder and shallower.</p><p>It seemed the Leixiao Sect had attempted to repair the altar, but had clearly failed.</p><p>After all, Qin Sang could only understand the meaning of many of the runes within the altar because he had seen the Five Thunders Emissary's Seal.  The inheritance obtained by the Leixiao Sect wasn't sufficient for them to comprehend the profound mysteries within.</p><p>Qin Sang took two steps forward, gazing intently at the altar. His eyes swept slowly and meticulously over each stone slab, each rune, before finally closing his eyes in contemplation.</p><p>This altar was different from the ones in the Left and Right Mansions of Thunder.</p><p>Perhaps it didn't belong to one of the Jurisdictions Qin Sang had envisioned. Or perhaps, as the Celestial Court had evolved over time, the altars had changed as well, defying conventional understanding.</p><p>However, one thing was certain.</p><p>The cultivator who built this altar possessed a cultivation base no less than his own!</p><p>Even with the scriptures from the Five Thunders Emissary's Seal, Qin Sang found it somewhat challenging to comprehend the runes within the altar, unable to quickly grasp the purpose of this altar.</p><p>Even his true body wouldn't be able to repair this altar directly.</p><p>Based on the Leixiao Sect's inheritance, Qin Sang had overestimated the altar's origins, yet he had underestimated it nonetheless.</p><p>This left Qin Sang both startled and filled with even greater anticipation and doubt: "Such an altar hidden in the mortal realm suggests that a powerful Daoist expert once resided here. Why was the Cloud Capital Mountain cultivation world unaffected by the Celestial Court?"</p><p>The Celestial Court's expansion often involved Daoists leaving the Court, choosing a location with auspicious feng shui, constructing an altar, and establishing a sect to preach the Dao and accept disciples.</p><p>As their influence gradually grew, forming the beginnings of a Jurisdiction, they would begin to condense the Merit Seal. Once the Merit Seal was complete, they could be elevated to a True Jurisdiction, recognized as a core force of the Celestial Court and incorporated into its territory.</p><p>Before this, they were called Lower Jurisdiction, Auxiliary Jurisdiction, Roaming Jurisdiction, Separate Jurisdiction, and so on, depending on their specific circumstances.</p><p>Lower and Auxiliary Jurisdictions were mostly found around the Celestial Court's existing forces, developing under the wing of a True Jurisdiction.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's investigation, there didn't seem to be a True Jurisdiction of the Celestial Court near Cloud Capital Mountain.</p><p>A Roaming Jurisdiction, as its name implied, roamed freely.</p><p>The Daoists who dared to establish Roaming Jurisdictions were all exceptionally powerful and enlightened experts.</p><p>After all, a Roaming Jurisdiction was far from the core territory of the Celestial Court and wouldn't receive timely reinforcements in times of danger.</p><p>There were three possibilities for this altar.</p><p>First, a Daoist had established a cave dwelling here for cultivation.</p><p>Second, a Daoist had encountered a powerful enemy, erected the altar for a ritual, and abandoned it after the battle.</p><p>Third, this was a Roaming Jurisdiction, and a Daoist had left behind their legacy here.</p><p>Qin Sang believed the third possibility was the most likely, with the Leixiao Sect's inheritance serving as evidence.</p><p>However, to explore the altar's true purpose, he must first comprehend the runes upon it and restore it.</p><p>Runes flashed continuously through Qin Sang's mind, forming various complex patterns, dispersing and converging. Some weren't present on the Five Thunders Emissary's Seal, but with the Five Thunders Court's thunder techniques as a reference, comprehending them wouldn't be difficult, just time-consuming.</p><p>"A Roaming Jurisdiction would be ideal."</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>If it were a Roaming Jurisdiction, finding the Jurisdiction Altar might allow him to connect with the Divine Court. He could not only borrow the Divine Court's power, but most importantly, re-establish contact with the Celestial Court.</p><p>……</p><p>While Qin Sang was examining the altar in the stone grotto, the collapse of the secret realm intensified.</p><p>Cultivators from various sects rushed into the secret realm, leading out those who had entered earlier.</p><p>Several sect masters had agreed on a course of action, ordering their disciples to escort the young boy out and surround the jade pavilion.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The jade pavilion shook violently, rainbow light flashing erratically as the cracks on its surface grew denser.</p><p>Everyone urgently employed secret techniques, attempting to decipher the jade pavilion's restrictions and find a safe method to break them.</p><p>Their gazes towards the jade pavilion were filled with fervor.</p><p>A woman in palace attire licked her lips, giggling, "Sect Master Ruan's proposal is excellent. Once we obtain the inheritance, we'll study it together. Today's commotion can't be hidden.  Who knows how many covet the Leixiao inheritance. Only by forming an offensive and defensive alliance can we deter others from harboring any designs on it."</p><p>The elderly man beside her said gently, "We are all descendants of the Leixiao Sect. There are no deep-seated grudges between us. Perhaps, as we comprehend the scriptures, our relationship will deepen, and we can revive the Leixiao Sect's glory."</p><p>The elder, a clan patriarch, truly hoped for the sects to merge, but the others didn't share his sentiment.</p><p>The Golden Torrent Mountain Sect Master chuckled, "We are already allies, otherwise, how could there be a Leixiao Assembly? Not good! The mountain is collapsing! Quickly take the jade pavilion up to avoid being affected!"</p><p>"Alright!"</p><p>Everyone responded, exerting their full strength to lift the jade pavilion and fly into the sky.  Soon, they heard earth-shattering rumbles from below.</p><p>Smoke and dust billowed as the mountain peaks continuously collapsed, leaving the secret realm in ruins.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, the collapse of the mountain beneath them was merely an illusion. Qin Sang used formations to stabilize the mountain and conceal it, casting a spell to deceive everyone.</p><p>The various sects' experts remained unaware, focusing on breaking the jade pavilion's restrictions. Finally, they broke through the gate, obtaining the Leixiao Sect's true inheritance and various profound cultivation techniques and secret arts. Everyone rejoiced.</p><p>Unfortunately, the secret realm was no longer what it once was. The mountain range returned to the mortal world, but it had been completely reduced to rubble.</p><p>The various sects later searched meticulously multiple times, finding nothing, confirming there were no omissions. Gradually, people left.</p><p>No one knew that there was still an unknown mountain peak, standing silently in that place.</p><p>These are stories for another time.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally taken Xiao Wu down the mountain to travel.  Unexpectedly, life was unpredictable. Not long after leaving, he returned to the mountain, staying for fifteen years. This inadvertently aligned with his mindset of going with the flow.</p><p>Qin Sang needed to comprehend the altar and was also concerned about Xiao Wu traveling down the mountain alone. He could only build a thatched hut near the stone grotto with Xiao Wu.</p><p>Away from Qin Sang, both Luo Hou and Zhu Que were somewhat afraid of Xiao Wu, even though Xiao Wu had changed since first coming down the mountain.</p><p>Zhu Que was a little better, though still somewhat timid, while Luo Hou kept a respectful distance, preferring to be a quiet azure horse.</p><p>Qin Sang set up a simple restriction at the foot of the mountain. If any small beasts lingered nearby, they might be drawn in. He hoped Xiao Wu could have more companions.</p><p>Fifteen years after the Leixiao Assembly.</p><p>One day.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from the thatched hut and saw Xiao Wu sitting on a stone stool in the small courtyard, with a fox sitting opposite her.</p><p>The fox was completely snow-white with smooth, glossy fur. It stuck out its tongue, continuously licking the cup in front of it.</p><p>The cup contained only clear water, but the fox drank it with relish, its eyes narrowed to slits.</p><p>Xiao Wu rested her chin in her hands, quietly watching the fox. Sensing Qin Sang's emergence, she stood up and trotted over.</p><p>The fox, however, was startled. It darted under the table, accidentally knocking over the cup.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The clear water in the cup spilled onto the ground, emitting a faint medicinal fragrance.</p><p>The sound of the cup hitting the ground startled the fox again, causing it to bolt without looking back, rushing into the forest to hide.</p><p>Qin Sang had gathered nearby spiritual herbs and casually refined some pills to feed Xiao Wu's spirit beasts. This cup of water contained one such pill.</p><p>"That little fox is quite clever, knowing there are benefits here, coming over frequently," Qin Sang said thoughtfully, watching the fox's retreating figure. "This fox has a similar aura to that group of fox demons. They must be related.  What a coincidence."</p><p>That group of fox demons might have been subdued and brought to Beikuo County from Ji Country. It was normal for some descendants to remain nearby.</p><p>Back then, that group of fox demons was captured by Gao Ruoxu, and all were punished according to the law and imprisoned.</p><p>The underworld laws were relatively fair, judging only by crimes, without bias towards whether the offender was human or demon.  Those fox demons were coerced and only absorbed yang qi from mortals without taking lives, so their crimes weren't punishable by death.</p><p>He wondered if they had been released yet.</p><p>"Are you bored? The world below is much more vibrant and colorful. Don't worry, we'll be going down the mountain soon."</p><p>Qin Sang ruffled Xiao Wu's hair. He had just used a technique to connect with his true body, informing it of the situation here.</p><p>Xiao Wu gently shook her head.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>In the Fire Domain, within the Daoist Sanctuary.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body awakened from meditation, gazing southward, murmuring, "The altar…"</p><p>His figure flickered, vanishing into the fire chamber.</p><p>Inside the fire chamber, treasures like the Grey Warbler Sword were being tempered by the flames.</p><p>He sat cross-legged atop the copper pillar, contemplating for a moment.  Extending his hand, the surrounding flames transformed into docile fire dragons, obediently circling above his palm.</p><p>Then, he retrieved various spiritual materials from the Thousand Jun Ring, his hand seals changing rapidly. He tempered them with fire, meticulously inscribing various runes, refining a ten-foot-long stone slab.</p><p>The slab's shape was identical to the ones on the altar, its surface covered with intricate thunder patterns, the result of his avatar's ten years of deduction.</p><p>His movements became swift, stone slabs continuously taking shape beside him.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Gui Hou, who was training the demon soldiers, twitched its ears and immediately flew to Qin Sang's cave. A voice came from within, "Go down the mountain immediately and deliver these to Ji Country."</p><p>The cave opened, and a ball of spiritual light flew out, containing the stone slabs and various spiritual materials.</p><p>While his avatar could barely refine the slabs to repair, rather than rebuild, the altar, it lacked sufficient spiritual materials, forcing him to request aid from his true body.</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>Gui Hou collected the items, bowed towards the cave, transformed into a gust of demonic wind, and descended the mountain.</p><p>It was also curious about the vast world, but it was more afraid of incurring Qin Sang's displeasure. It understood that if Qin Sang dared to let it descend, he wasn't afraid of it running away.  It didn't dare to linger, reaching Ji Country with the utmost speed, delivering the items. After exchanging a few words with Luo Hou, it hurried back.</p><p>Qin Sang took the stone slabs and entered the stone grotto.</p><p>He already had a plan in mind and quickly repaired the altar.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A thunderous sound erupted from within the stone grotto, emitting dazzling lightning that illuminated half the mountain peak.</p><p>The small beasts in the mountain panicked, the fox scurrying blindly, cowering and trembling in the grass.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang sat cross-legged on the altar, which was now fully restored.</p><p>He channeled his true essence into the altar.</p><p>The altar displayed various phenomena, dragon-like lightning bolts dancing within and around it. The entire altar seemed to be composed of lightning, radiating a formidable thunderous aura.</p><p>"Something's not right…"</p><p>After carefully sensing for a moment, Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even after restoring the altar, he hadn't obtained the information he sought.</p><p>"This is a branch altar!"</p><p>Qin Sang immediately understood.</p><p>Daoist altars had various wondrous uses.  Multiple altars could be arranged in a formation, acting as sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy, creating an Altar Formation with boundless power!</p><p>The arrangement of the Jurisdiction Altar, Pacification Altar, Capital Altar, and branch altars also formed an Altar Formation. The two True Monarchs had summoned the Thunder Ancestor and Gouchen Great Emperor using the power of these altars.</p><p>Altar Formations could have countless variations. Different numbers and arrangements would produce vast differences.</p><p>Not only were there primary and secondary distinctions, but there were also auxiliary altars with singular functions, serving only as support, and so on. The slightest difference could lead to vastly different outcomes.</p><p>Naturally, a single branch altar couldn't reveal the whole picture.</p><p>"A single branch altar is already this profound. Just how high was the cultivation of the one who established this altar?"</p><p>These discoveries startled Qin Sang. Perhaps this time he could truly obtain unexpected benefits.</p><p>The premise was that the altars in other locations hadn't been destroyed, or at least, like this branch altar, some remnants remained.</p><p>After countless years, with the world constantly changing, no one could say for sure what might have happened.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't optimistic about this, otherwise, there wouldn't be only one Leixiao Sect.</p><p>He calmed his mind and entered meditation, attempting to sense other branch altars and the main altar through this one.</p><p>As expected, no matter what he did, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. The other altars had also been destroyed.</p><p>Having his true body send the spiritual materials had indeed been a wise decision, saving him the trouble of going back and forth later.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to his senses, lost in thought.</p><p>In this case, he could only use this branch altar as a reference and deduce on his own, at most determining a general location.</p><p>However, once he found the second branch altar, the following would become increasingly easier.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that after restoring three branch altars, he would be able to discern the pattern of the Altar Formation and thereby determine the location of the main altar.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang entered meditation once more, devoting himself to calculations.</p><p>This calculation took a full month. Qin Sang determined three general areas, none of which could be ruled out.  He would have to verify each one.</p><p>That day, Qin Sang emerged from the stone grotto and announced his departure down the mountain.</p><p>"Finally going on another journey down the mountain! I'm bored to death on the mountain!"</p><p>Zhu Que was incredibly excited, not wanting to stay a moment longer, urging Qin Sang and Xiao Wu, "Hurry! Hurry!"</p><p>Qin Sang and Xiao Wu mounted the azure horse and rode down the mountain.  As they left, Qin Sang cast a spell to move the small beasts in the mountain out, releasing them after they were far from the Leixiao Sect.</p><p>Most of the small beasts had low intelligence and scattered in all directions.</p><p>Only the fox, hiding in the grass ahead, peeked out hesitantly, unwilling to leave.</p><p>It looked at Xiao Wu on the horse, whimpering, seemingly reluctant to part, wanting to approach yet not daring to.</p><p>The azure horse walked slowly, stopping beside the grass.</p><p>The fox abruptly retracted its head.  A moment later, it timidly poked its nose out a little, its body trembling.</p><p>Xiao Wu also looked at the fox.</p><p>The girl and the fox faced each other. After a while, Xiao Wu slightly raised her head.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded.</p><p>Xiao Wu jumped off the horse, took out the remaining pills, and placed them in front of the fox.</p><p>‘Clip-clop! Clip-clop!’</p><p>The two people and one horse, bathed in the setting sun, headed towards the distant mountains.</p><p>The fox in the grass carefully held the pills in its embrace, its eyes narrowed, and only after the figures in the distance disappeared did it quietly retreat into the grass.</p><p>(Couldn't post last night, it showed a system or code error.)</p>
