<h1>Chapter 1216: A Plea for Help</h1><p>Qin Sang had been running, too preoccupied to fully consider the implications of Blood Lake.</p><p>Elder Ye's absence from the front lines, his clandestine presence at Blood Lake, surely indicated a hidden agenda.</p><p>During the clash with Elder Ye and his associates, Qin Sang sensed an intense desire on the part of Jiang Chenzi and the others to capture them all, leaving no one to escape.</p><p>Upon Qin Sang's appearance, their side revealed three experts comparable in strength to mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivators, with Han Lizard being only slightly weaker.  The Lizard and the Lu cultivator were skilled in combined attack techniques.</p><p>The Zu Yuan forces, though equally numerous, lacked notable power aside from the inscrutable Elder Ye. Their only significant advantage was three treasured flags.</p><p>Even with the malevolent spirits on their side, completely trapping the four of them would be unrealistic.</p><p>Unless they were trying to conceal some secret.</p><p>Considering this, Blood Lake was undoubtedly unusual.</p><p>What Qin Sang didn't expect was a connection between Blood Lake and the Boundless Valley.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang recalled the blood miasma surrounding Boundless Valley, blocking its entrance.</p><p>The miasma was fraught with peril.  When he and Yun Youzi entered Boundless Valley, both possessing Foundation Establishment cultivation, they still needed a guide, and the journey was extremely perilous.</p><p>Could the blood miasma be related to Blood Lake?</p><p>Qin Sang summoned Fat Chicken and gestured for it to continue.</p><p>"Blood Lake is in the deepest part of the third layer of Boundless Valley.  After my mother transformed, she moved her cave dwelling to Boundless Valley and became very familiar with the area.  Even so, she remained cautious about going to Blood Lake. I heard my mother say…"</p><p>Fat Chicken hesitated, then said cautiously, "The peerless Blood Mulberry originated from Blood Lake."</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled, glancing at Fat Chicken.  He had been the one to take the treasure from Fat Chicken, not the other way around.  There was no need for such fear.</p><p>The peerless Blood Mulberry originated from Blood Lake.  It seemed Blood Lake was a treasure trove, but it was unclear whether Elder Ye was simply seeking treasure or had other motives.</p><p>"Are you suspecting a connection between the Blood Lake in Boundless Valley and the Blood Lake in Abyssal Ruins? Did your mother ever describe what Blood Lake is like?"</p><p>Qin Sang questioned.</p><p>Fat Chicken recalled, "The aura of this Blood Lake is identical to that of Boundless Valley, indicating a profound connection. But my cultivation was too low back then, and my mother didn't tell me much about Blood Lake."</p><p>After a pause, Fat Chicken looked hesitant, gritting its teeth.  "Master, I would like to ask you a favor…"</p><p>"Is it related to your mother?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly.</p><p>"Master, you already knew?" Fat Chicken was stunned.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Hehehe, I've been waiting to see how long you could hold it in."</p><p>Fat Chicken, as the offspring of a transformed demon king, a genuine "demon royalty," with a demon king mother protecting it, could essentially act with impunity in the cultivation world. Human cultivators wouldn't want to provoke a creature of such lineage.</p><p>It also had excellent natural talent, nearing a breakthrough to late-stage Demon Core, with transformation within reach.</p><p>Such background and talent should have cultivated a disposition vastly different from Fat Chicken's obsequious, sly, shameless nature.</p><p>Fat Chicken seemed more like someone who had struggled and suffered greatly in the harsh cultivation world.</p><p>Qin Sang had long suspected that something had happened to the Thunder Swallowing Hawk Demon King; otherwise, why would Fat Chicken be reduced to this state?  Or perhaps the Thunder Swallowing Hawk Demon King was simply ruthless, abandoning Fat Chicken to fend for itself.</p><p>But this wasn't his concern; it likely involved some secret, and since Fat Chicken wasn't volunteering information, Qin Sang wouldn't press the matter.</p><p>Fat Chicken said sheepishly, "My mother disappeared shortly after I hatched. Fortunately, she left me several treasures before leaving, allowing me to successfully form my core and achieve my current cultivation. I planned to follow you, Master, earn merit, and then boldly ask for your assistance.  I never expected to encounter Blood Lake here…"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  "Your mother disappeared at Blood Lake?"</p><p>"Years ago, my mother suddenly told me that an ancient restriction at Blood Lake had loosened, showing signs of abnormality, and she decided to investigate. I waited for a long time at the cave dwelling, but she never returned. After forming my core, I went to Blood Lake once, but found it impossible to break the ancient restriction. I don't know how she is doing now…"</p><p>Fat Chicken nodded, eyes filled with intense sadness and longing; rarely did it show such seriousness.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. "Your mother could contend with two Nascent Soul cultivators back then, yet she was trapped in Blood Lake.  I'm afraid I'd fare no better."</p><p>Fat Chicken hurriedly said, "I understand Blood Lake is extremely dangerous, and I wouldn't dare let you risk venturing in alone. However, if Blood Lake is connected to the Abyssal Ruins, wouldn't the Two Realms Alliance decide to open Blood Lake and disrupt the Abyssal Ruins' schemes? With so many people, the danger should be significantly reduced."</p><p>I know my mother's chances are slim, but I beg you, sir, to let me go in and search for her.  Dead or alive, I need closure. I'll gladly serve you, sir, body and soul…"</p><p>Pang Ji, desperate to save his mother, readily agreed to become Qin Sang's mount.  His mother had been missing for two hundred years, and this was possibly their only chance.</p><p>Qin Sang fell into contemplation.</p><p>If this news were sent back, the Two Realms Alliance would undoubtedly send people to investigate Blood Lake in the Wuyaya Valley. Whether they would enter Blood Lake and contend with the Abyss, however, remained uncertain.  They needed to first ascertain Ye Lao Mo's intentions.</p><p>The demonic cultivators of Xiaohan, particularly the Qingyang Demon Sect located outside Wuyaya Valley, should know some secrets of Blood Lake.</p><p>The Two Realms Alliance would certainly need to clarify the details before making any deductions, so I need to consider how to explain it. I should consult with Senior Sister Qing Jun upon my return.</p><p>If the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon妖王 is still alive and I could rescue her, that would be wonderful.</p><p>Whether Pang Ji pledges allegiance is inconsequential; Qin Sang wasn't short of spirit beasts at the Yao Dan stage.  What mattered most was saving his mother, and gaining another Yao Wang ally would be invaluable in dealing with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Perhaps I could even persuade the Thunder-Swallowing Falcon妖王 to stay in Qianshan Bamboo Sea, eliminating my worries when I travel.</p><p>My travels to search for fragments of the Killing Sword are inevitable; I can't stay in Xiaohan indefinitely.</p><p>Establishing a sect and protecting Qianshan Bamboo Sea are mostly to fulfill Senior Yunyouzi's wishes – I shouldn't trouble Senior Sister Qing Jun with this.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang waved his hand, "We'll discuss this upon our return. Tell me everything you know…"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Pang Ji, overjoyed that Qin Sang hadn't refused, beamed.</p><p>…</p><p>The return journey was uneventful.</p><p>Reaching the desert and exiting the Abyss territory, Qin Sang flew towards their designated meeting point.</p><p>Far from the Abyss.</p><p>Deep in the desert, amidst a ruined city of towering boulders.</p><p>Some boulders were a few dozen feet high, others were hundreds of feet tall.  This was once a human settlement, now completely deserted and silent.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected it was the work of cultivators; ordinary people couldn't have carved thousands of boulders in the desert.</p><p>Standing on a sand dune, he surveyed the ruins, ensuring there were no abnormalities. Then, he crushed a bone tooth, and a fragment transformed into the snake king's ethereal image.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang unharmed, the Snake King breathed a sigh of relief. He had witnessed Ye Lao Mo pursuing Qin Sang firsthand.</p><p>"I knew you, Mingyue, would escape!"</p>
