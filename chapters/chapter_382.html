Chapter 375: The Ambush

Faced with a two-pronged attack, the cultivator surnamed Bao was quickly overwhelmed.  He attempted to escape but was eventually captured alive before he could take his own life.


Kong Xin, eyes gleaming with a predatory light, lunged forward like a wolf.  He bit into Bao’s neck, a gruesome sound echoing as warm blood flowed from the victim's mouth, staining the ground crimson.


The blood was shocking.


Bao’s eyes widened before losing all light as Kong Xin drained his life force, leaving behind a desiccated corpse.


The black-robed cultivator watched Kong Xin’s frenzied blood-sucking, a look of horror and apprehension crossing his face.


Kong Xin lifted his head, licked the blood from his lips with a lingering expression, and the murderous look in his eyes faded. His pale complexion regained some color. He touched his brow, his demonic aura receding, leaving him appearing harmless again.


The black-robed cultivator clicked his tongue in admiration.  "Kong, you certainly keep your secrets well! I've been in the Unyielding Valley for years, and I always heard of your excellent reputation as a guide.  If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I'd never have guessed you practiced such a demonic blood-sucking technique."


“Hmph! I usually only feed on the blood of beasts.  If I hadn’t been severely injured and desperately needed the life essence of a Foundation Establishment cultivator to heal, I wouldn't be consorting with a fiend like you!” Kong Xin scoffed.


The black-robed cultivator sneered, “I only kill a few people. How can that compare to you consuming someone's life essence alive?  If anyone saw you drinking blood like that, they'd think I was the less demonic one! Since we are both of the demonic path, why don't we continue to cooperate and do more business together?”


“Impossible!”


Kong Xin shook his head resolutely. “This situation was unique.  I was injured and needed blood, and then I discovered the cold-iron vein. It was a perfect opportunity.  I took the risk of damaging my reputation and used these loose cultivators as scapegoats!  This incident happened at a time when Unyielding Valley is still recovering from chaos, making it seem like an accident. But if I do this often, it won't always be seen as an accident; those old foxes in the trading guilds will catch on. This was a one-time thing, never again!”


The black-robed cultivator shrugged.  “With your abilities, Kong, why bother appeasing those old geezers?  So what if it gets exposed?  We can just flee to the depths of Unyielding Valley and become true demons! Wouldn’t that be more fun?”


“You don’t understand a thing!”


Kong Xin expressed disdain, kicked the corpse, and retrieved the storage pouch, tossing it to the black-robed cultivator without a second glance. Then he burned all remaining evidence with a burst of flame.


“According to our agreement, the next storage pouch is mine,” Kong Xin looked around.  “Let's go! We need to destroy the Tiger-Winged Roc's nest and lure it away before those two Daoists arrive. The woman is alone; we can deal with her later. Those two Daoists aren't easy to handle. If we miss our chance, we may not be able to get them unscathed.”


The black-robed cultivator held onto the pouch, his eyes assessing Kong Xin. “I suddenly think the agreement we made was a bit too hasty.”


Kong Xin’s face darkened.  “What do you mean?”


“If what you said is true, that Clear Wind Daoist's flying sword is extraordinary. It’s probably worth more than two or three top-grade magical artifacts.


We originally agreed that everyone's possessions were roughly the same, so even if I lost a little, I wouldn't mind.


But who would have thought a mere cultivator could possess such a treasure?


I risked my life to lure the leader of the evil spirits in the cave, although it wasn't needed in the end.  Even if I didn't achieve anything great, I still put in the work.


You took the best treasure, and if what's left doesn't even compare to that flying sword, I'd still have to share the rest with you.  Wouldn't that be a terrible loss for me?”


The black-robed cultivator pleaded his case, finally stating, “We’ll still give you seven-tenths of the cold-iron ore.  But the rest will be split equally. Otherwise, I might lose my temper during the fight and fail to leave anyone alive for you to feed on, and then don’t blame me.”


Kong Xin glared, but the black-robed cultivator remained unmoved.


“Good!”

Kong Xin gritted his teeth.  “As you say!”

The cloaked figure laughed heartily, opened the storage pouch of the Bao cultivator, poured its contents onto the ground, and generously offered, “Fellow Daoist, choose first!”

Kong Xin coldly snorted, glanced at the items, selected a lump of cold-gold ore, and swiftly departed on his flying sword.

The cloaked figure didn't take offense at Kong Xin's attitude, gathered the remaining items, and followed closely behind.

…

The land was cracked, barren, devoid of vegetation.  Towering stone mountains lined the desolate plain, from whose depths came echoing howls, like tiger roars, carrying an oppressive aura.

Deep within the mountains, dozens of giant birds circled the peaks.  With their wings spread, these angry birds measured over forty feet in length, their plumage bearing markings strikingly similar to tiger stripes.

These howls, unlike any bird call, emanated from the creatures themselves:  Tiger-winged Griffins.

The cloaked figure and Kong Xin arrived quietly, their eyes fixed on the griffin nest and the mountain behind it, shrouded in shadow.  The Huanglong Grass grew there.

"Good, I led them the long way. Those two Daoists haven't arrived yet. Let's find somewhere to lie low…"

Kong Xin searched the area, finding nothing amiss around the nest or on the mountain, and relaxed slightly.

However, before he could finish speaking, a voice echoed from behind them.

"Daoist Kong, were you looking for us?"

…

Only Qin Sang and Yun Youzi could be lying in wait here.

The Wuyaya Valley was a labyrinth, the number of pursuers unknown, and they might have attracted the attention of a powerful demonic sect.  They didn't want to get involved, but they were also wary of being attacked.

After parting ways with Kong Xin, the two discussed their options and decided to lie in wait near the Tiger-winged Griffin nest.

Firstly, the path ahead was fraught with danger, offering few opportunities for rest;  they needed to regain peak condition.

Secondly, they wanted to observe the situation.

If the others weren't after them, peace would be best.  If they were being targeted, there was no escaping; regardless of who they were or how strong, they had to be eliminated!

Although gathering the Huanglong Grass wasn't their primary goal, this location was not far from the second level, and the others might well guess their intentions.

If they were ambushed while passing through the ancient barrier, it would be a major disaster.

Therefore, after losing sight of Kong Xin and the others, Yun Youzi produced a spirit bamboo flying boat, and the two sped towards the Tiger-winged Griffin nest, far exceeding Kong Xin's expectations, arriving well in advance.
