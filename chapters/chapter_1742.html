<h1>Chapter 1733: The Legacy of a Transcendent Being</h1><p>In several major regions, the Canglang Sea and the Yao Sea are closest to the Gui Xu. They were the first to discover ferocious beasts prowling the storm belt, and the frequency of beast appearances was higher there than in other regions, causing considerable panic.</p><p>Canglang Sea cultivators discovered that the Yao Sea was not far from them and also related to the beasts.</p><p>At that time, cultivators in the Yao Sea captured a descendant of the Golden Toad Clan. This descendant held a high position within the clan, and many secrets were extracted through interrogation.</p><p>One piece of information, initially overlooked, was that a group of Golden Toad Clan masters encountered a ferocious beast outside the Yao Sea, nearly suffering complete annihilation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, soon after, news came from the Canglang Sea—the same beast was sighted nearby.</p><p>At that time, everyone basically concluded that the beasts wouldn't actively approach the cultivation world. Before they could breathe a sigh of relief, they realized the imminent threat from the Yao Clan.</p><p>Hundreds of years have passed, and the presence of ferocious beasts in the storm belt has gradually diminished, but the threat persists, proving fatal to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Even powerful cultivators like Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming dared only to cautiously explore outwards. Qin Sang's solo flight across the vast storm, traversing several major regions, was unimaginable to them—his courage was simply astounding.</p><p>Qin Sang was still pondering the matter of the several immortal palaces.</p><p>He had always wondered about the connection between the palaces and the major cultivation regions.</p><p>Before the palaces descended, the world was already like this. Were the shelters unrelated to the palaces?</p><p>Or, was it that when the world was about to be destroyed by the storm, the palaces sensed it, activating an invisible barrier to form shelters, protecting the world's creatures?</p><p>Even worse, perhaps the storm itself was brought by the palaces when they descended!</p><p>The news that the Qisha Palace has been protecting the Yao Sea and the Canglang Sea was the first piece of evidence Qin Sang found, and also the one he least wanted to see.</p><p>If the power protecting the cultivation world originated from the immortal palaces, and the palaces ascended, how long could the storm-resistant barrier last?</p><p>A mere few hundred years is insignificant in the cultivation world. Aside from the disappearance of the invisible barrier between the Canglang Sea and the Yao Sea, no significant changes have been felt yet.</p><p>But what about a thousand, ten thousand years later…</p><p>Will annihilation by the storm be the ultimate fate of this Lesser Thousand World?</p><p>Lost in thought, Qin Sang seemed to be jolted back to reality by Zhuo Ming's question. Looking up, he saw the Bao siblings staring at him with curiosity.  He smiled faintly, took a jade box from his Qianjun Ring, and opened it to reveal a demon core.</p><p>The three were captivated by the demon core in Qin Sang's palm.</p><p>The Canglang Sea didn't lack demon cores.</p><p>Countless demonic beasts had died at their hands, including many transformed demons.</p><p>However, in their perception, none of the demon cores they had ever seen could compare to this one.  It was a difference in essence, even though its luster seemed somewhat murky, lacking clarity.</p><p>“This is…?”</p><p>Before Bao Xi could realize it, Zhuo Ming and Bao Zhengnan's faces suddenly changed.</p><p>‘Clap!’</p><p>Qin Sang placed the jade box on the table, pushing it squarely before them.  “It was a stroke of luck. When I encountered it in the storm belt, it had fought other ferocious beasts and had old injuries…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The three abruptly rose to their feet.</p><p>The demon core before them, and the aura of power Qin Sang suddenly exuded, struck their minds like a heavy hammer, leaving them stunned.</p><p>…</p><p>The three were still seated before Qin Sang.</p><p>Bao Xi's eyes still held a touch of bewilderment and disbelief.</p><p>She clearly remembered that back on Yi Tian Peak, Qin Sang's cultivation was at most comparable to theirs.</p><p>Their siblings had achieved their current accomplishments, especially her brother.  Anyone in the cultivation world who mentioned him would praise his strategic brilliance and talent in cultivation.</p><p>Upon their reunion, they were still lingering in the Nascent Soul stage, while their old friend had already crossed that most difficult threshold, far surpassing them!</p><p>Zhuo Ming's posture was the most upright, subtly conveying a sense of restraint.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan, having held a high position for a long time and seen much of the world, and having known Qin Sang, didn't know how to act towards him for a moment, shaking his head repeatedly.  “Qin Daoist, you've kept this from us for a long time!”</p><p>Then, he bowed to Qin Sang. “Congratulations, Daoist friend, on achieving transcendence; the immortal path awaits you!”</p><p>Bao Xi and Zhuo Ming also offered their congratulations.</p><p>For the cultivators of this world, transcendence is worthy of the term “逍遥” (xiāoyáo – a state of carefree freedom).</p><p>“Transcendence?”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled wryly to himself, then his expression turned serious. “My arrival is not for boasting; I have other important matters to discuss.”</p><p>The three exchanged glances subtly.</p><p>With their wisdom, they quickly recovered from the shock Qin Sang had brought, involuntarily considering the pros and cons.</p><p>If Qin Sang were only at the late Nascent Soul stage, they would be pleased to see their old friend's strength.</p><p>But Qin Sang was too strong, unbeatable; whether this was good or bad for the Canglang Sea remained unknown.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang is of human origin. If he were willing to protect the human race and appear on the battlefield, all difficulties would be easily overcome. However, they don't understand Qin Sang's temperament, and as outsiders, they may not care about the lives of the Canglang Sea humans.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan hesitated, "What important matter? Please speak freely. Others may not dare to say, but the Four Saints Palace will do its best to cooperate."</p><p>Qin Sang said, "I came because of the celestial change..."</p><p>His purpose in coming was to unite the cultivators of this world. He didn't hide anything, recounting the events that occurred in Central Plains, starting from the ascension of the Immortal Palace and leading to the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>The three gradually became captivated by the flourishing immortal cultivation world of Central Plains, its abundance of talented individuals, and lamented the death of the Purple Thunder True Person.  Only then did they realize what was happening and were all stunned.</p><p>Regardless of their reactions, Qin Sang explained everything he knew.</p><p>Silence fell upon the hall for a long time.</p><p>What Qin Sang described was truly unbelievable.</p><p>However, his account was clear and coherent, not like a fabrication.</p><p>"I wonder if you are familiar with the concept of a karmic oath. I am willing to set up an altar and swear that every word I speak is true," Qin Sang added, then said solemnly, "My purpose in coming here is twofold. First, to unite the cultivators of this world, whether human, demon, or witch, to prevent internal strife, and to work together to find the Ascension Platform! Second, to ask cultivators from all regions to help find the source of the Heavenly Demon's Sound, especially any related treasures from the Immortal Palace..."</p><p>...</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>The core forbidden area of the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang proactively requested to set up an altar and made a karmic oath before Bao Zhengnan and the others, to allay their suspicions.</p><p>During those three days, Qin Sang did not disturb Bao Zhengnan, giving them time to process the information.</p><p>He believed Bao Zhengnan would make the right choice.</p><p>Having entered the path of cultivation, who wouldn't yearn for immortality?  After enduring countless hardships to reach their current level, would they only seek violence and conflict?</p><p>The oath completed.</p><p>The few returned to the quiet room.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan, a decisive man, had already considered and decided, "Tomorrow I will personally draft an official notice and have it sent to all sects and factions, inviting them to Tianxing Island to discuss important matters. The conflict between the two regions and three races is incessant, resulting in heavy losses for the human race, with many elders of this palace also suffering casualties. Elders Wu and Xiao were severely injured by the demon king and are recovering in the palace. All factions are exhausted, and surely they have long hoped for someone to mediate.  What does True Person plan to do about the witch and demon races?"</p><p>The hatred between the demons and humans runs deep and is almost impossible to resolve.</p><p>Even if humans want to cease hostilities, the demons will not agree, it depends on Qin Sang's methods.</p><p>Humans and witches are allies, but there are also many disagreements.  Unless they agree to jointly resist the demons, it will be difficult to unite.</p><p>Qin Sang already knew that the current Grand Shaman of the witch tribe is Fang Laomo, a formidable figure, but he can only barely hold on against the tide of events.</p><p>Qin Sang showed a look of relief and said; "We are old friends, let's address each other as daoist friends. I will personally visit the Demon Sea and Witch God Mountain. I believe the demon and witch tribes will give me some face."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan sighed, "The resentment between the two regions has grown deeper and deeper, and no one can escape. If Daoist friend can prevent this war, it would be a great merit. These are the palace's accumulated scriptures over the years, please examine them."</p><p>Saying so, Bao Zhengnan took out two spatial pouches.</p><p>One was filled with various jade slips and scrolls.</p><p>The other contained some treasures.</p><p>"Over the years, a considerable number of treasures have been taken from the Seven Killing Hall, but most were refined into pills and magical treasures, or destroyed in battles, leaving not many. I don't know if there are any clues to the Heavenly Demon's Sound inside."</p><p>His willingness to cooperate stemmed from Qin Sang's earlier gift of the superior Spirit-Calming Incense formula.</p><p>Qin Sang received it as a treasure.  He scanned the treasures with his spiritual sense and focused on examining the contents of the jade slips.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan sat aside, patiently waiting.</p><p>Qin Sang examined them one by one, repeatedly shaking his head in disappointment.</p><p>After putting down the last bamboo scroll, Qin Sang sighed softly, "Forgive my audacity, but did the four saints leave anything behind in the palace back then?"</p><p>The Four Saints were the first to discover the Seven Killing Hall, obtaining a heaven-defying opportunity, soaring in strength, and leading the human race, once enslaved by the witches, to become the masters of the Canglang Sea. No one understands the Seven Killing Hall better than they do.</p><p>The Western Land's Immortal Palace has not yet appeared, and the Ziwei Palace remains hidden.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall, like the Central Plains Immortal Palace, truly emerged and was thoroughly explored by people. However, the Central Plains Immortal Palace changed hands several times, and with ascenders leaving, many treasures were taken away.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall has been secretly controlled by the Four Saints Palace, with only one ascender emerging. Anything left by the Four Saints is extraordinary!</p><p>Qin Sang's question directly addressed the core secrets of the Four Saints Palace.  Under normal circumstances, it would indeed be extremely presumptuous.</p><p>He stared at Bao Zhengnan, knowing his superior spirit-calming incense recipe wasn't easily obtained.  This concerned the path to ascension, and he didn't want the Four Saints Palace to withhold information.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan's eyes flickered, seemingly anticipating Qin Sang's question.</p><p>Did the Four Saints Palace ancestors leave behind any relics?</p><p>Of course!</p><p>Years ago, the Four Saints inadvertently released a fragment of the Demon Lord's soul, paying the price of three severely injured and deceased members to seal the demon.  Bao Gu was the sole survivor and the only one to ascend.</p><p>Before her ascension, Bao Gu left behind ancestral instructions, stating that she left something for future generations in her cave.  Within the Four Saints Palace, it's known as the Ancestral Legacy.</p><p>However, before leaving, Bao Gu set up a powerful formation to seal the cave.</p><p>The ancestral instructions stated that only a Nascent Soul cultivator could open it.</p><p>The Four Saints had broad minds; Bao Gu's instructions weren't solely for the Four Saints Palace descendants, but for all humankind.  Any Nascent Soul cultivator of good character could be invited to open the legacy.</p><p>Whether future generations would abide by the instructions and relinquish their ancestors' legacy was another matter.</p><p>After Bao Gu's departure, the Four Saints Palace declined, with none achieving Nascent Soul cultivation.  The Ancestral Legacy remained unopened.</p><p>For three days, Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming deliberated.</p><p>Regardless of the clearly stated ancestral instructions, even if they seized the Ancestral Legacy, they lacked the ability to open it—a useless possession.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan, highly self-regarding and ambitious for Nascent Soul cultivation, received a blow from Qin Sang's news. With the immortal path potentially severed, what was the point of guarding the Ancestral Legacy?</p><p>The Four Saints Palace had various speculations about the Ancestral Legacy. The most widely accepted belief was that it was related to ascension, with potential difficulties in the ascension process; otherwise, the ancestor wouldn't have set a Nascent Soul-level seal.</p><p>After discussion, they decided to inform Qin Sang.  The Ancestral Legacy's time had come.</p><p>Of course, Bao Zhengnan had conditions.  If the treasures were related to breakthroughs, Qin Sang couldn't take them.  If related to ascension, they would be shared with the Four Saints Palace, relying solely on Qin Sang's oath.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan slowly explained the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang, after listening, showed surprise but readily agreed to Bao Zhengnan's conditions, swearing an oath, and eagerly asked, "Where is the senior's cave now?"</p><p>"This way, friend."</p><p>Bao Zhengnan led Qin Sang out of the quiet room; Zhuo Ming and Bao Xi were already waiting outside.</p><p>The four flew out of the palace complex to a verdant hillside.</p><p>Before entering the mountain, a refreshing herbal fragrance filled the air—a medicinal garden.</p><p>The disciples guarding the garden had been dismissed.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan landed atop the slope, pointing to a stone tablet at the summit. "Qin Daoist, it's here."</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's eyes gleam as he focused on the tablet, Bao Zhengnan fell silent and stood aside.</p><p>The tablet was only half a person's height, without any inscriptions, only some complex, enigmatic patterns, standing alone in the earth, weathered and aged.</p><p>Cultivators of insufficient strength wouldn't sense anything here, as was the case for Bao Zhengnan and Zhuo Ming.  But in Qin Sang's eyes, the patterns on the tablet held mystical significance.</p><p>"Such a refined formation!" Qin Sang exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>Bao Gu left the treasures for future generations to open; breaking the seal here wasn't difficult, especially with Qin Sang's Heavenly Eye Butterfly assisting him.  He quickly found the key. He was marveling at Bao Gu's profound mastery of formations.</p><p>Watched by the three, Qin Sang extended his right hand, placing it in the center of the tablet.  His palm emitted true energy, flowing along the tablet's patterns, following a certain order.</p><p>In an instant, the patterns shone faintly, and the tablet became transparent and eventually vanished.</p><p>Before Bao Zhengnan and the others could see the runes appearing within the tablet, a sudden dizziness overcame them.  When they regained their senses, they found themselves transported from the hillside to a hall.</p><p>The hall wasn't large, with a landscape screen in the center.</p><p>To the right were cushions and an incense burner, now empty.  Presumably, this was Bao Gu's place of meditation.</p><p>To the left were a seat and cups, likely a place for guests.</p><p>The furnishings were simple yet not austere, refined and elegant.</p><p>This cave's time seemed frozen for millennia.  Standing here, one could still sense the lingering presence of its inhabitant.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan and the others scanned the cave, drawn to a jade slip on the table.</p><p>Bao Zhengnan's expression shifted slightly; he hesitated before acting, glancing at Qin Sang, who was intently staring at the screen. Following his gaze, they noticed he was looking at a moon depicted in the landscape painting.</p><p>Only then did Bao Zhengnan notice the anomaly.  The moon wasn't part of the landscape painting; it seemed like a light cluster embedded within it, its moonlight constantly flowing, suggesting something else within.</p><p>"Qin Daoist?" Bao Zhengnan couldn't help but ask.</p><p>Qin Sang walked to the table, opening the jade slip. He read: "The path to ascension is arduous, the mysteries unknown.  Those who open this cave shall receive my gift, and inherit my will, opening the path forward for humankind!"</p><p>(End)</p>
