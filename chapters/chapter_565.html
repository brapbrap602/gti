Chapter 558:  A Gathering of Heroes


Dongyang Bo readily agreed and led everyone towards the other end of the Jade Ruyi.
Once everyone was settled, Daoist Chongyi activated the Jade Ruyi.  The white Jade Ruyi was instantly enveloped in a thick green light, which continued to expand until it enclosed everyone within.
Immediately, the Jade Ruyi trembled slightly and shot towards the barrier.
Daoist Chongyi shouted, "Open!"
A crack appeared in the barrier, and chaotic spiritual energy surged in.  Without hesitation, Daoist Chongyi steered the Jade Ruyi directly into the spiritual tide.
Boom!
A monstrous wave crashed against them.
The Jade Ruyi dodged with remarkable agility, only being grazed by the wave's edge.  Even so, it shuddered violently, and the green light dimmed slightly. Qin Sang and the others were also affected, swaying wildly.
"Steady!"
Daoist Chongyi and Dongyang Bo acted together, finally stabilizing the wavering Jade Ruyi.
Then, the Jade Ruyi, with a flick of its tail, easily avoided another spiritual wave, and its speed suddenly increased as it plunged into the depths of the tide.
The wind howled, the waves crashed.
The Jade Ruyi was like a lone boat in a hurricane, seeming incredibly fragile, on the verge of capsizing.
Everyone's faces turned pale, shocked and terrified by the awesome power of nature.
This wasn't even the most violent part of the spiritual tide, yet even with two Yuan Ying masters present, they all looked serious, not daring to be the slightest bit careless.
Qin Sang knew that leaving the protection of the Jade Ruyi would mean certain death, so he sat quietly, not daring to move.
He was surrounded by Qiu Mu Bai and others, the five of them forming a circle in the center.
Chen Yan, Tie Guanzi, Feng Ming, and the others stood on the outer edge, forming a protective formation. Dongyang Bo stood alone at the tail of the Jade Ruyi, remaining perfectly still no matter how it swayed.
Chen Yan sat quietly not far from Qin Sang, with no fluctuations of true energy emanating from her. Even Daoist Chongyi couldn't discern her true cultivation level.
Qin Sang remembered what Granny Jing had said: Chen Yan had already overcome the Yuan Ying tribulation and was a true Yuan Ying master, but she was deliberately concealing her identity, likely with ulterior motives.
After traveling a distance, the Jade Ruyi became more stable, the green light steadily protecting them. Everyone gradually relaxed, some even finding time to look at their surroundings, including Qin Sang.
As far as the eye could see, the world was filled with extremely violent spiritual tides.  These chaotic energies gathered in clumps, some shaped like giant pythons, roaming recklessly.
Some were as large as giant whales, while others were boundless, their full extent impossible to see.
They were extremely restless, changing shape constantly, gathering and dispersing unpredictably, and incredibly fast, capable of traversing hundreds of feet in the blink of an eye.  It was impossible to perfectly dodge them.
There was little room to maneuver, and even with two Yuan Ying masters controlling the Jade Ruyi, they inevitably suffered the impact of the spiritual tide. Fortunately, the Jade Ruyi was very sturdy, and they escaped unscathed.
"Look! Over there!"
Someone exclaimed, pointing to the distance.
Following their gaze, everyone saw a brilliant red light rising into the sky in the far northeast. The red pillar of light, like a sword piercing the heavens, remained clearly visible amidst the chaotic spiritual tide.
"A secret realm!"
Everyone's spirits were lifted.
The only possible explanation for a light pillar appearing out of nowhere was that a secret realm's barrier had been triggered by the spiritual tide.
After a quick exchange between the major sects' cultivators, it was discovered that this area didn't belong to any single sect. It was highly likely that a new secret realm had just emerged!
Unfortunately, the secret realm seemed very far away, and the two Yuan Ying masters didn't dare to travel casually through the spiritual tide.  Furthermore, the Ziwei Palace was their primary objective, making it impossible to change course.
Those who took note of the secret realm's location agreed to explore it upon their return from Ziwei Palace.  The unusual light pillar indicated that this secret realm would surely be extraordinary, possibly containing valuable treasures.
Unexpectedly, before they could finalize their plan, the light pillar rippled and then collapsed with a thunderous roar.
In an instant, the red light dissipated, and the strange phenomenon vanished.
"Alas!"
Everyone was disappointed, sighing repeatedly.
There was a ninety percent chance that the secret realm's protective barrier couldn't withstand the spiritual tide and had been breached.
Even if the secret realm hadn't been completely destroyed, few treasures would remain.
This wasn't uncommon in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, and they could only accept it.
However, this incident alerted Qin Sang. He stopped meditating, widening his eyes to search back and forth, hoping to encounter another such secret realm.
After achieving the Golden Core stage, he had begun a new journey, and if he could find one or two unexplored secret realms, he would surely reap significant rewards.
Yuan Ying masters might not care for them, but he certainly did.


Even between the surges of spiritual energy,  they dared not travel at full speed, constantly needing to detour and evade.  Even a Yuan Ying cultivator's speed was still astonishing.

Qin Sang, as told by Jing Po, needed to reach the rendezvous point to join the others.  The deeper they went into the Ancient Immortal battlefield, the stronger the spiritual energy surges became. Only by combining forces could the Yuan Ying cultivators dare to penetrate the inner layers of the Ancient Immortal battlefield and reach the Zi Wei Palace.

The sky of the Ancient Immortal battlefield was brightly lit by the surges of spiritual energy, making it impossible to distinguish day from night.  They had been flying for an unknown amount of time.  Even with the Jade Ruyi's relentless speed, even the Yuan Ying cultivators showed signs of fatigue.

They escaped another surge of spiritual energy.

A gigantic dark shadow suddenly appeared ahead.

The shadow stretched from east to west, disappearing beyond sight at both ends, blocking their view like a giant dragon lying on the ground.  Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a towering mountain range, a natural barrier.

More strangely, three peaks shone with different colored lights.

The easternmost peak billowed with black demonic energy, obscuring everything within.

The central peak held a magnificent palace, with figures faintly visible moving inside.

The western peak was covered by a red cloud, entirely concealing the summit.

The three peaks formed a character resembling the Chinese character for "product" (ÂìÅ), clearly distinct yet mutually supportive, collectively resisting the impact of the spiritual energy surges. The demonic energy and the red cloud were the most imposing, while the golden light was relatively subdued.

The Jade Ruyi had just reached the mountains.

Four figures suddenly flew out of the red cloud. Leading them was the Pure Yang Sect's Sect Master, Chifa Laozu.

"Haha, fellow Daoists, you've finally arrived! You've kept us waiting!"

Chifa Laozu's booming laughter echoed from afar.

On the Jade Ruyi, Dongyang Bo and Chongyi Daozhang exchanged a glance and said loudly, "We encountered several delays along the way. We apologize for keeping you waiting. Have the other Daoists already arrived?"

Chifa Laozu replied, "Indeed, the members of the Demon Sect and the independent cultivators from Yin Mountain Pass have all arrived.  We're just waiting to rendezvous with the Daoists from Tian Yao Hill, and then send a message to those old fogeys from the Tian Xing League!"

Dongyang Bo's eyes narrowed slightly.  "Fellow Daoists, after searching for so long, haven't you found the location of the Tian Xing League's ancient teleportation array?"

"No!"

Chifa Laozu retorted impatiently, "That old geezer is extremely cautious. He only uses it when the Zi Wei Palace opens, making it impossible to locate."
