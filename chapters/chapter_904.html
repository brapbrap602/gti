<h1>Chapter 896: Senior Uncle</h1><p>Chapter 896: Senior Uncle</p><p>After their figures disappeared,</p><p>Zhao Songqiao's eyes narrowed, revealing a hint of mockery. He thought to himself, "It's better that they didn't follow. It saves me the trouble of eliminating them."</p><p>He moved, flitting through the shadows, circling around to the side of the low mountain.</p><p>Tian Mudie's wings vibrated slightly, easily keeping pace with him.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Hua Shen and Fang Ting hadn't gone far when they heard a low shout. Looking up, they saw a green rainbow shooting down from the mountaintop, landing before them in an instant, revealing a lean Daoist figure.</p><p>"Greetings, Junior Uncle! We are disciples, sent by Senior Uncle Jin Yan to collect Dark Thunderwood and other spiritual materials."</p><p>Hua Shen and Fang Ting hurriedly bowed and explained, presenting the token.</p><p>"It's indeed Senior Brother Jin Yan's token."</p><p>After examining it, the Daoist returned the token to Hua Shen and looked at Fang Ting. "You were brought by Junior Brother Yang. Who is this woman? I seem to remember her being a disciple of Yanmiao Pavilion."</p><p>He had seen Fang Ting when they entered Dongming Island.</p><p>"Junior Uncle is perceptive. Fang Ting is indeed a disciple of Senior Chen of Yanmiao Pavilion, and a friend of mine. Hearing that I was coming here to collect herbs, she wanted to see it for herself," Hua Shen used the same tactic again.</p><p>"Senior Chen?"</p><p>The Daoist's expression softened.  "If she's Senior Chen's disciple, it's alright. However, I have cultivated several precious herbs in the mountain. You mustn't wander around, lest you damage the herb garden. Take the materials and leave quickly."</p><p>Seeing the Daoist turn to leave, Hua Shen quickly stopped him.</p><p>"With all due respect, Junior Uncle, Senior Jin Yan instructed me to dig up six hundred-year-old Green Hate Fruit roots. I'm not very skilled, and I'm afraid of accidentally harming the trees. Could you guide me, Junior Uncle?"</p><p>The Green Hate Fruit tree bears fruits that can be used to refine pills for restoring spiritual energy.</p><p>Roots over a hundred years old, rich in wood spirit energy, are excellent materials for refining artifacts.</p><p>"I just took some last time, and now six more? Does Jin Yan think these trees are inexhaustible?"</p><p>The Daoist didn't suspect anything, muttering a complaint, but readily agreed. "I'll take you.  Green Hate Fruit trees are quite delicate.  Improperly harvesting the roots can damage the tree, greatly reducing the medicinal power of future fruits, and in severe cases, even causing the tree to die. I wouldn't trust you to do it yourself."</p><p>Hua Shen and Fang Ting followed the Daoist, flying a short distance to a herb garden.</p><p>The place had clearly been tended to recently. The spirit trees were exceptionally vibrant, their leaves jade-green and lush, recently nourished, and the fruits had been harvested.</p><p>The Daoist landed before the largest trees, carefully observing them before selecting one.  He channeled his spiritual energy, performing some unknown technique, gently touching the tree. A green light fell onto the tree's spirit.</p><p>The tree trembled slightly, its vitality exceptionally strong. The Daoist channeled his spiritual energy into a blade of light, carefully cutting off a hundred-year-old root.</p><p>He repeated the process, cutting six roots and handing them to Hua Shen. "Remember, when taking similar items, don't act rashly."</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>Hua Shen bid farewell to the Daoist and flew with Fang Ting towards the back of the mountain.</p><p>Only when the Daoist was out of sight did Fang Ting dare to transmit her voice. "Senior Brother Zhang, should Senior Brother Zhao be approaching now?"</p><p>Hua Shen's expression was grave, causing her to pause.</p><p>Hua Shen moved to a high point, where he could see a large expanse of black shadows in the distance—the Dark Thunderwood forest.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he took Fang Ting to a secluded spot near the exit and said gravely, "Wait here. Don't go anywhere. If anything happens, run."</p><p>"Senior Brother, what are you talking about? What could happen? Aren't you coming with me?"</p><p>Fang Ting was frightened by Hua Shen's words.</p><p>"I can't explain it, but I have a bad feeling about Senior Brother Zhao. Just in case. I have a way to escape, I'll be fine, but you be smart, you might need to help cover for me later…"</p><p>Hua Shen looked deeply at Fang Ting before leaving alone.</p><p>Fang Ting's expression was agitated. For some reason, the moment Senior Brother Zhang disappeared from her sight, she felt a sudden emptiness in her heart. She pressed a hand to her chest, her other hand reaching out unconsciously, grasping at nothing.</p><p>Hua Shen stealthily followed a faint connection with Tian Mudie, tracking him towards the Dark Thunderwood forest.</p><p>Soon, a dark, deathly forest appeared in his sight.</p><p>Among the Dark Thunderwood trees, faint dark thunder power drifted, making it impossible for ordinary plants to survive, except for some special herbs.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao slipped into the deepest part of the dark forest, unaware of the Tianmu butterfly shadowing him.</p><p>Reaching the area with the densest Yinlei, Zhao Songqiao stopped, surveyed his surroundings, and then suddenly spat out a white pill.</p><p>The pill seemed coated in a waxy substance.</p><p>The moment the pill appeared, the swirling Yinlei energy acted as if it had encountered a monstrous beast, being rapidly devoured.  In an instant, the surrounding Yinlei energy vanished.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao retreated, watching this unfold.</p><p>Next, the nearby Dark Thunder Trees began to wither and die. This place was becoming a true death zone.</p><p>Yinlei energy from further away was drawn in, forming a cone-shaped vortex centered on the pill.</p><p>All this happened silently.</p><p>After absorbing an unknown amount of Yinlei energy, with a ‘pop’, the pill cracked open, and a dragonfly-like spirit insect emerged.</p><p>Meanwhile, hidden in the distance, the incarnation, witnessing this through the Tianmu butterfly, was filled with shock.</p><p>Witchcraft insect control differs greatly from human methods, and he was exceptionally skilled in both.</p><p>“A Gu insect!”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Dongming Island.</p><p>Three figures streaked across the sea, heading directly for the island's entrance.</p><p>These three didn't conceal their powerful auras. Their swift movement tore through the water, creating large waves, their imposing manner suggesting not a visit to a Dharma assembly, but rather a punitive expedition.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect disciples guarding the entrance were all taken aback.</p><p>“Three Foundation Establishment masters! Who are they?”</p><p>Uncertainty hung in the air. They exchanged glances, unable to identify the newcomers.</p><p>“They seem hostile, beyond our ability to stop. Quickly report to Master Lu!”</p><p>An elder, his voice calm and experienced, hastily sent a burst of light speeding into Dongming Island.</p><p>Before the light disappeared into the mist, the three were upon them, their speed unrelenting.</p><p>The disciples bowed, blocking their path.  “We are Lan Dou Sect disciples, guarding Dongming Island on Master Lu’s orders.  May we ask your identities and purpose, so we can report to him?”</p><p>“I'm your senior uncle!  You blind fools, you dare stop me!”</p><p>The leading man, his eyes blazing with fury, shouted, throwing a dark iron token into the elder’s arms, and attempted to force his way inside.</p>
