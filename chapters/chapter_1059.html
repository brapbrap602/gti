<h1>Chapter 151: A Life Lost</h1><p>The heavily armored warrior possessed the bloodline of the Nine-Lived Black Tortoise.  A spectral image of a divine turtle, wreathed in black energy that flowed like dark water, materialized on his back shell. This was one of his most powerful abilities. The seemingly thin streams of energy were incredibly resilient, imbued with the power of his shell, no less potent than ordinary protective talismans.  Among the assembled Demon Kings, even the Serpent King, in the late stages of transformation, likely wouldn't surpass him in defense. Despite this, the warrior dared not show any carelessness in this perilous place, cautiously navigating the spatial rifts with his most potent ability activated.</p><p>The mountain was high, but the surrounding spatial rifts and miasma-like fog severely limited visibility. In the distance, they could faintly discern a vast swamp below, where even the shrubs and their leaves were a stark black. The swamp appeared deceptively calm, devoid of monstrous beasts, yet its stillness amplified the sense of foreboding and oppression.  Compared to the swamp, the mountain felt marginally safer. It was a bare, rocky peak offering a wide, unobstructed view.  Atop the mountain lay the ruins of an ancient temple, reduced to rubble and broken walls.  Two other locations pulsed with strange light, indicating the presence of ancient barriers. One of these was halfway down the mountain, conveniently placed along their descent, and the surrounding space seemed relatively stable.</p><p>The armored warrior deliberately steered towards this ancient barrier.  The Serpent King frowned but didn't intervene.</p><p>To avoid the spatial rifts, they were forced to weave a circuitous path, stopping and starting repeatedly. It took considerable time to reach the vicinity of the ancient barrier.</p><p>Suddenly, the armored warrior's expression shifted, and he retreated hastily.  "Back!" he urgently warned.  The other Demon Kings, unaware of the danger, immediately followed suit without hesitation.</p><p>"A spatial rift is concealed within the strange light," the warrior explained, his face pale. "It seems the rift tore through the barrier, and the two are now locked in a struggle.  Had I been a moment slower, I might have disrupted the balance..."</p><p>The Demon Kings felt a chill run down their spines. Triggering the barrier's explosion or a spatial tremor would be catastrophic.</p><p>"The humans wouldn't dare venture deeper for a reason," the Serpent King declared, stepping forward. "It's best we avoid reckless actions.  Thank you for your efforts. I've recovered, so I'll take the lead from here."</p><p>Chastened by their close call, the Serpent King carefully avoided the ruined temple as they descended.  Eventually, the Demon Kings reached the foot of the mountain unscathed. Though the journey had been arduous, it was thankfully uneventful.</p><p>A stone path, clearly of human construction, lay partially submerged in the swamp, only a short section visible. The swamp was deathly silent, filled with the stench of decay.</p><p>The Demon Kings cautiously surveyed the area.  Finding no unusual signs, they briefly conferred and decided to proceed with their original plan, taking turns scouting ahead.</p><p>...</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>"Trouble!"</p><p>"Deer King, watch out! It's a high-level beast!"</p><p>By now, the Demon Kings had traversed most of the swamp without incident, save for one close encounter with a drifting spatial rift.  Just when they began to think the swamp was relatively safe, disaster struck.</p><p>The Deer King, a tall, slender demon whose true form was a stag, was scouting ahead. As he cleared some shrubs and leaped over a patch of mire, the mud below abruptly exploded. Mud and a foul odor erupted.  A slender figure, fast as lightning, shot out of the mire, its maw filled with fangs, lunging at the Deer King. It was a monstrous beast resembling a giant python.</p><p>They hadn't detected the slightest sign of the beast before its ambush.</p><p>Caught off guard, the Deer King remained composed.  Nine-colored light flashed around him as he lunged forward several meters, narrowly avoiding the beast's jaws.</p><p>The beast roared, its slender body twisting as it attacked again.  The Deer King, now more prepared, sidestepped the attack with ease.  The other Demon Kings arrived to assist.</p><p>A phoenix shadow, a green spear, a tortoise shell... Several attacks landed in quick succession.  The beast was trapped by the phoenix shadow, then struck on the head by the tortoise shell.  Enraged, the beast thrashed, only to be impaled through the mouth by the green spear. Fangs shattered, blood sprayed, and the beast, now pierced through, seemed near death.</p><p>Suddenly, the Deer King cried out. The mire trembled, mud spraying everywhere as three identical beasts burst forth, like giant pillars, surrounding the Deer King.</p><p>"Three more! All high-level beasts!"  The Demon Kings were shocked.  So many powerful beasts lurking in one place!</p><p>Ignoring their dying companion, the three beasts focused on the Deer King. They spewed blood-red clouds of breath as they lunged.  Fortunately, the Deer King was no weakling. He had remained vigilant and immediately summoned a treasure crafted from his antlers.  He sliced through the blood clouds and, spotting an opening, darted through.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The Deer King broke free. Strangely, the three beasts paused, abandoning their pursuit.</p><p>Then, a horrifying scene unfolded.  A barely visible silver flash appeared on the Deer King. A diagonal crack appeared on his head, splitting him in two.  His two halves continued to fly forward, his eyes still moving before finally dimming as he collapsed into the mire, lifeless.</p><p>"A spatial rift!" the Serpent King exclaimed.</p><p>A wave of terror washed over the Demon Kings. The Deer King, whose power ranked among the middle of their group, had been killed so easily. They had lost a comrade before even finding the True Dragon's remains.</p><p>"Deer King!"  The armored warrior roared in grief.</p><p>These beasts weren't entirely driven by instinct. They were intelligent. They knew about the invisible spatial rift and had used it as a trap, forcing their prey into it. The situation was dire.  The area was wide open, and the Deer King, caught completely off guard, hadn't anticipated the hidden rift.</p><p>*Gurgle...*</p><p>The mire bubbled, the stench of blood filling the air.  The white matter of the Deer King's brain and his blood were a gruesome sight.</p><p>"Don't be rash!" the Serpent King restrained the enraged armored warrior.  His gaze swept the area. "Something's not right here..."</p><p>He trailed off as the depths of the fog stirred.  Several roars echoed from the surroundings, drawn by the battle and the scent of blood.  A powerful aura approached from behind, so strong that even the Serpent King felt threatened.</p><p>"Retreat! Now!"  The Demon Kings' faces paled.  They dared not linger.</p><p>Returning the way they came would take too long.  Their only option was to press forward.  So many powerful beasts concealed in a single swamp!  Only now did they truly grasp the dangers of the inner temple. No wonder the humans, despite occupying the Seven Kills Temple for so many years, had only explored a small portion.</p><p>The Demon Kings unleashed their abilities, slaying several high-level beasts as they fought their way out of the swamp.  Finally breaking free, they exchanged glances, their battered appearances drawing wry smiles.</p>
