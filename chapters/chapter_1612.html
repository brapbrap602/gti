<h1></h1><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Qin Sang followed Jiang You into the back hall of the station and saw a wooden frame, two men tall, placed on the ground.  A bronze gong hung from the frame's crossbeam.</p><p>This kind of gong had three faces.</p><p>Without anyone touching it, the gong swayed on its own, emitting a faint yellow halo.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, sensing the presence of a spirit array nearby, a portion of which converged on the gong.</p><p>“This treasure is called the Seven-Tone Gong. It's a special Buddhist artifact. The Hall Master purchased it at a great price after the incident at the last Treasure Exchange.”</p><p>Jiang You drew a ‘�d’ character in the air, flicked it toward the gong, and it vanished into the yellow light. The gong hummed, suddenly becoming still, its light receding, but its connection to the spirit array became more subtle.</p><p>“Deploy corresponding formations in the vicinity. This treasure is extremely sensitive to spiritual fluctuations. It prevents those with malicious intent from acting during the auction and the Treasure Exchange. It's particularly sensitive to demonic energy.”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly understood, inwardly chuckling at the Six Continents Hall being once bitten by a snake and now fearing well ropes for ten years.</p><p>The last time demonic beings infiltrated the Treasure Exchange, the Six Continents Hall lost face and became a laughingstock.  If it happened again, they would truly become the butt of every joke.</p><p>The mundane affairs of the hall weren't Qin Sang's responsibility. He only needed to make an appearance at the auction and the Treasure Exchange.</p><p>After seeing Jiang You off, Qin Sang lingered in his cave dwelling for a while before leaving the Six Continents Hall branch and wandering aimlessly through Hong City.</p><p>The first Grand Auction was to be held the day after tomorrow morning, divided into Golden Core and Nascent Soul sessions.  Auctions specifically for lower-level cultivators had been held in the south city for days, with no limit on the number of sessions.</p><p>All Nascent Soul cultivators entering Hong City received invitations, and Qin Sang was no exception.</p><p>No list of treasures had been released yet, but the grand pronouncements of the Golden Jade Gate had everyone in great anticipation.</p><p>Hong City was overflowing with people.</p><p>Qin Sang unknowingly arrived at the main peak.</p><p>Nascent Soul Patriarchs, rarely seen on ordinary days, were encountered by Qin Sang several times shortly after he ascended the main peak. There were also a few with concealed auras, suspected to be cultivators above mid-Nascent Soul realm.</p><p>Hong City concealed dragons and crouching tigers.  Rashly using divine sense to pry could easily lead to misunderstandings.</p><p>Qin Sang treated it as sightseeing, avoiding contact with others, walking slowly, and ascending to the summit of the main peak, where he leaned against the railing and looked out.</p><p>The main peak was the center of all the peaks north of the river, with myriad mountains to the west and a vast ocean to the east, commanding a view of all the lesser peaks.</p><p>A nine-story building stood atop the main peak, constructed of gold and jade, standing out like a crane among chickens, the epitome of luxury. It was called the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the Golden Jade Tower was a property of the Golden Jade Gate, and the Grand Auction the day after tomorrow would be held there.</p><p>Qin Sang had little contact with the Golden Jade Gate, but judging from past rumors and his current firsthand impressions, it didn't feel like an Immortal Dao sect, appearing even more ostentatious than the Six Continents Hall, a merchant association.</p><p>Perhaps the Golden Jade Gate had a unique heritage.</p><p>Cultivation methods could alter a cultivator's temperament, subsequently influencing the atmosphere of an entire sect.</p><p>Qin Sang passed by the Golden Jade Tower, glancing at it without any intention of entering. Just as he was about to head in another direction, his brow furrowed almost imperceptibly.</p><p>He seemed to have felt a scrutinizing gaze fall upon him.</p><p>With his greatly enhanced divine sense and sharp spiritual perception, Qin Sang knew it was definitely not an illusion. This gaze was different from others. The other party was very focused on him!</p><p>He quickly took in the surroundings of the Golden Jade Tower.</p><p>To the right of the Golden Jade Tower...</p><p>A Nascent Soul female cultivator, arm in arm with a handsome young man, walked towards him.</p><p>The young man was only at the mid-Golden Core realm and seemed unaware of the female cultivator's true cultivation. His behavior was frivolous and casual, and the female cultivator played along, acting charming and coquettish, gazing at the young man with apparent admiration.</p><p>Qin Sang could see the profound indifference deep within the female cultivator's eyes. Recalling some rumors about the Demonic Sect's Subjugation Heaven Valley, if the young man didn't wake up in time, his fate wouldn't be pleasant.</p><p>A Daoist priest emerged from the Golden Jade Tower. Judging by his attire, he was a master from the Quiet Zen Mountain Manor. He glanced at the female cultivator without interfering, then, with uncanny footwork, melted into the crowd and disappeared.</p><p>Two levels of stairs down, a Nascent Soul Daoist couple whispered sweet nothings to each other.</p><p>...</p><p>The images of each cultivator flashed through Qin Sang's mind, eliminated one by one.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly also silently used its divine abilities.</p><p>Everything seemed normal, nothing unusual!</p><p>“An illusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe his spiritual perception had failed him, but the person had indeed disappeared, or their disguise technique was so masterful that even he couldn't see through it.</p><p>Maintaining his pace, he walked past the Golden Jade Tower without revealing anything. He strolled around the other peaks, finally returning to the Six Continents Hall station as night fell. That feeling hadn't reappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped dwelling on it and organized his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Only one Soul Calming Incense stick remained.  The two Crocodile Demon skeletons should fetch a good price. The Soul Calming Incense formula could also be sold, but good steel should be used on a sharp blade.</p><p>As far as he had observed, even in the prosperous Middle Continent, gathering all the spiritual ingredients for the Soul Calming Incense was extremely difficult.</p><p>Those who could afford it and had the ability to refine it were few and far between.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to wait until he had the time and energy to collect the rarest spiritual ingredients before considering selling the formula.</p><p>Moonlight draped like gauze.</p><p>Qin Sang looked out the window at the quiet courtyard, pondering to himself.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a gong shattered the silence!</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The three faces of the gong resonated simultaneously.</p><p>The gong's sound was crisp and clear, audible throughout the entire station.</p><p>The Seven-Tone Gong!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He abruptly stood up and appeared above the courtyard in the next instant.</p><p>At the same time, figures rushed out from various locations. The Six Continents Hall experts were all awakened, and everyone's gaze was fixed on the back hall.</p><p>That was where the Six Continents Hall treasury was located, personally guarded by Vice Hall Master Jiang You!</p><p>Yellow light soared from the back hall, the gong's tones rapid.</p><p>A white figure flashed silently within the yellow light, graceful as a swan, like a phantom.</p><p>A thunderous roar suddenly came from Vice Hall Master Jiang You in the back hall, “Stop him!”</p><p>At the same time, panicked shouts erupted from within.</p><p>“Not good! The Heaven Vault has been opened!”</p><p>“The restrictions have been breached…”</p><p>…</p><p>The Heaven Vault, the Six Continents Hall's number one treasury, had been silently infiltrated.  The thief's actions weren't discovered until the Seven-Tone Gong sounded the alarm.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The white figure's movement technique was exceptionally profound, flashing away into the void beyond the mountain.</p><p>Jiang You finally rushed out of the back hall at this point.  Transparent threads hung from his body, his Daoist robe was tattered, and his figure was disheveled, clearly having been delayed by the other party's divine ability.</p><p>Jiang You, enraged and humiliated, saw the white figure escaping and hurriedly looked towards Qin Sang's cave dwelling. Seeing it empty, he was relieved and quickly said, “Quickly pursue! Go assist Elder Qin!”</p><p>Leaving Jiang Mu and most of the remaining personnel to guard the treasury, Jiang You led the others in hot pursuit.</p><p>The commotion alerted the cultivators on the nearby peaks.  Some curious individuals followed secretly.</p><p>The Golden Jade Gate's patrolling cultivators also noticed the anomaly and quickly activated their jade talismans to contact sect experts, urging their spirit beasts to gather here.</p><p>At the forefront...</p><p>Although the white figure's escape technique was ingenious, shaking off Qin Sang was nothing short of a fool's errand.  Not long after they rushed out of Hong City, Qin Sang caught up.</p><p>“Where do you think you're going!”</p><p>Qin Sang roared.</p><p>A sword arc leaped from the Thousand Jun Ring.  The Golden Sink Sword, swift as a meteor, suddenly erupted with a thousand-zhang sword light. A river of sword energy tore through the void, descending directly.</p><p>The white figure seemed to glance back at Qin Sang. Facing the descending sword light, they flicked their sleeve.  Without seemingly using any magical treasure, a fierce wind erupted in the void.  Streams of visible gray wind energy converged, instantly transforming into a murky, strange wind that filled the sky.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The river of sword energy pierced into the strange wind without hesitation, like a red-hot iron, unstoppable, its brilliant sword light shining within the strange wind.  The strange wind boiled as streams of gray wind energy frantically rushed towards the sword light, becoming tangible shackles, wrapping around it layer after layer.</p><p>“Late Nascent Soul!”</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed slightly. Only then could he determine the other party's cultivation.</p><p>Although the Six Continents Hall's treasury held many treasures, it was impossible for supreme treasures that could tempt a Grand Cultivator to be stored there.</p><p>For a Grand Cultivator to lower themselves to personally steal these trifling treasures and even be caught red-handed seemed somewhat absurd.</p><p>“The treasures I brought to Hong City were meant for auction.  If fellow Daoist has any need, you only need to ask.  I would gladly gift them to you for free. Why go through all this trouble!”</p><p>Qin Sang declared loudly.</p><p>A few mere treasures in exchange for befriending a Grand Cultivator – he believed Hall Master Mu would have the courage to make such a decision.</p><p>“The things I want, I always take directly!”</p><p>The white figure scoffed.</p><p>The last part of their laughter was somewhat distorted because Qin Sang, seeing the sword light failing to stop the white figure, changed his sword art.  The Golden Sink Sword vanished into thin air. The void turned dim, engulfing the strange wind.</p><p>With the Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation activated, the strange wind lost its target, flailing around like a headless fly within the sword formation, collapsing under the onslaught of sword threads, dissipating piece by piece.</p><p>The sword threads flashed brightly, instantly shredding the last wisp of strange wind.  Before the white figure could escape, the formation enveloped the space, narrowly trapping them within.</p><p>Qin Sang stole a glance behind him.</p><p>This commotion was getting a bit out of hand.</p><p>In addition to Jiang You and the others, many streaks of light were flying towards them, illuminating the night sky outside Hong City, but they were far behind.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed several golden streaks of light among them, moving at a considerable speed. It was the Golden Jade Gate's unique escape technique.  He nodded inwardly; this was what he had been waiting for.</p><p>Someone was causing trouble in Hong City, and the Golden Jade Gate was duty-bound to act.</p><p>Qin Sang's intervention was simply fulfilling his duty as a guest elder. He didn't want to fight a Grand Cultivator to the death for the Six Continents Hall. Delaying them and waiting for reinforcements to arrive was already the extent of his obligation.</p><p>Furthermore, Qin Sang recalled the feeling of being watched during the day.</p><p>That same night, a Grand Cultivator infiltrated the Six Continents Hall.</p><p>Was it a coincidence?</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to secretly monitor the surroundings, but it hadn't found anything unusual yet.</p><p>“Not a bad sword formation, but you wield it poorly!  Your swordsmanship is amateurish!”</p><p>Trapped within the sword formation, the white figure wasn't panicked at all. Instead, they let out a sneer, mocking him.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could respond...</p><p>Whistling sounds filled the sword formation as transparent threads shot out from the white figure, identical to the ones that had entangled Jiang You.</p><p>The white figure clearly hadn't used their full strength against Jiang You.</p><p>The threads wove a spectacle around the white figure.  Countless threads intertwined, unexpectedly forming a lake suspended in mid-air.</p><p>The water of the lake was clear, just like a real lake.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>The water surface bulged as a giant, formed entirely of water, climbed out of the lake. Its empty eyes stared at the myriad sword threads and it roared at the sky, raising its arm.  Its body twisted sharply as it slammed its heavy fist into the sword formation!</p><p>The force of the punch was like thunder.</p><p>In an instant, the sword formation trembled, chaos erupting within.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew serious. He quickly formed hand seals, the sword threads frantically contracting inwards, compressing the power of the sword formation, mending the breach created by the punch.</p><p>The white figure, however, had already seized the opportunity, suddenly appearing above the water giant, rushing upwards.  Facing the converging sword threads, they calmly pointed a finger at another spot within the sword formation and said indifferently, “This formation shall be mine!”</p><p>That was the exact location struck by the water giant, where the power of the sword formation hadn't yet recovered, the sword threads in disarray.</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken...</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified to discover that the sword threads had completely slipped from his control, their connection severed. Though not the entirety of the formation, but only that specific area, it was a fatal flaw.</p><p>Even more astonishingly, as the white figure hooked their finger, those very sword threads were brought under their control, turning against their ‘companions.’</p><p>The Seven Souls Slaughtering Formation was torn from within as sword threads clashed against each other.</p><p>The white figure remained composed.</p><p>“Full of flaws!”</p><p>The white figure's sneer reached Qin Sang's ears.</p><p>Qin Sang was speechless, unable to retort.</p><p>After the sword formation reached completion, enemies trapped within had always only been able to defend. This was the first time it had been broken using such a bizarre method.</p><p>The water giant was understandable, but Qin Sang couldn't comprehend the divine ability the white figure had used in the end.</p><p>Unheard of!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The white figure escaped the sword formation, completely unharmed.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they didn't choose to continue fleeing, turning instead to face Qin Sang, standing in the void and staring at him.</p><p>Qin Sang was initially startled, then sensed something amiss.  He thought, "Not good!"  The Phoenix Wings on his back flapped urgently as he transformed into a bolt of lightning, instantly shifting a thousand zhang away.</p><p>As soon as he moved, the white figure appeared in his former position.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this once during his fight with the Green-Furred Rat Demon, but the white figure's movements were more concealed and effortless, making them difficult to defend against.</p><p>‘Roar!’</p><p>The water giant roared.</p><p>Punch after punch, it smashed through the sword threads with astonishing power.</p><p>The white figure could only control the sword threads for a short time.</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully regained control of the sword formation, trapping the water giant, then focused on dealing with the white figure.  The black lotus on his forehead shimmered as the Demonic Fire Dragon reappeared, charging directly towards the void to Qin Sang's left.</p><p>A booming sound echoed.</p><p>Subtle ripples appeared in the void as the white figure's silhouette materialized.  Struck by the demonic fire, their entire body shattered like a mirror, then was completely engulfed and extinguished by the demonic fire.</p><p>The white figure had tried to repeat their trick, but Qin Sang had used it against them.</p><p>However, there was no joy on Qin Sang's face. The white figure's divine abilities were strange and unpredictable, and it was impossible for them to be killed so easily.</p><p>He scanned the surroundings with vigilance.</p><p>In the next moment, the small mountain below trembled violently as a giant footprint appeared out of nowhere.  The white figure materialized above the footprint, their form flickering slightly before drifting back over ten zhang, landing steadily with their robes fluttering.</p><p>They had somehow used a divine ability to dissipate the impact of the demonic fire.</p><p>The small mountain suffered. The stones on its summit were crushed by the footprint, and the entire mountaintop cracked, centered around the footprint, the fissure reaching down to the bottom, and spring water gushed upwards.</p><p>Their two exchanges had occurred in mere instants.</p><p>While it seemed neither had managed to harm the other, Qin Sang was deeply aware of the other party's terrifying power. He had been forced to use the demonic fire but could only maintain a defensive stance. He couldn't help but consider retreating.</p><p>The white figure stood firm, glancing back.</p><p>The pursuers were approaching.</p><p>They seemed unwilling to continue their entanglement with Qin Sang.  Ceaselessly attacking, they raised a hand and formed a hand seal.  The water giant, still struggling against the sword formation, stiffened, its limbs turning rigid, before melting into a puddle of water.</p><p>Then, the light and shadow on the white figure's face shifted, their features gradually becoming clear, revealing a beautiful woman in palace attire.</p><p>The beautiful woman looked Qin Sang up and down, her gaze lingering on the jade pendant at his waist.</p><p>“Somewhat capable. No wonder you were able to cross the storm and come from the North Sea.”</p>
