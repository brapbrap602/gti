<h1>Chapter 1628: Boiling Snow Pill</h1><p>Correction: My brain short-circuited yesterday; I mistakenly wrote "ice phase" instead of "water phase," causing a misunderstanding. While typing, my input method automatically suggested "refrigerator lineage," which I found odd at the time and didn't immediately realize.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Leaving this kind of last will and testament suggests a cultivator from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, likely a rearguard action.</p><p>Is this their legacy for future generations?</p><p>Hua Shen silently scanned the tokens and other items, guessing that this person likely died with hopes for the revival of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>He bowed to the bones.</p><p>Of course, I need to thank this person. Otherwise, the treasures in the vault, while considerable, fell short of expectations.</p><p>After paying respects.</p><p>Hua Shen beckoned with a gesture, drawing several jade slips into his hand.</p><p>"Taiyi Hidden Water."</p><p>This is the only cultivation technique among the jade slips, unsurprisingly belonging to the Water Dao. Its profundity surpasses even the Xuan Tian Palace's "Qingwei Records."</p><p>"Lightless Shield," "Eternal Stillness Divine Wheel," "Smoke Wave Shadowless Phantom Body"...</p><p>Each is a superior divine ability.</p><p>Some are profoundly esoteric, requiring diligent study. Others are more like methods for manipulating true essence, providing inspiration to those with sufficient cultivation.</p><p>For example, "Lightless Shield."</p><p>Hua Shen read through it once, pondered for a moment, and then swiped his hand in front of him.  True essence surged, then gradually weakened, forming an invisible shield. Its power was underwhelming.</p><p>Hua Shen noticed something – he found it easier to use this divine ability than expected, suspecting it was related to the cold煞 (sha) he absorbed after refining the ice disk.</p><p>He didn't waste too much time on it.</p><p>Hua Shen examined each jade slip. The last one captivated his attention most; it contained the water phase lineage's treasured pill recipes!</p><p>Hua Shen was overjoyed. He quickly scanned the jade slip and finally found a spirit pill called Boiling Snow Pill among the last three ancient recipes. Its description matched the characteristics of the spirit pill he obtained from the supposed tomb of the Water Phase Master.</p><p>Boiling Snow Pill.</p><p>Li Shen Flower, Tian Ning Fragrance, three Li Shu Seeds...</p><p>A note was added: Best refined by a cultivator who practices "Taiyi Hidden Water" and has reached the late Yuan Ying stage, using Taiyi Golden Liquid to nurture the pill. This increases the success rate by over 10%.</p><p>Even Qin Sang was astounded by the list of spirit herbs. Regardless of their rarity, several were unheard of to him.</p><p>Perhaps due to the passage of time, the names of the herbs have changed, and Qin Sang knew little about alchemy; however, the difficulty of refining this pill is evident.</p><p>Its effects are truly astonishing.</p><p>A cultivator who takes a Boiling Snow Pill immediately receives a massive replenishment of true essence, quickly filling even depleted reserves. This is effective even for late Yuan Ying stage cultivators.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Qin Sang immediately recalled the Three Lights Jade Liquid he'd obtained.  After the Three Lights Jade Liquid, he'd never seen a spirit pill with such efficacy.</p><p>However, the Three Lights Jade Liquid's effects are gentle. Cultivators experience no adverse effects, their bodies are nourished, and Qin Sang even used it for limb regeneration.</p><p>The Boiling Snow Pill, on the other hand, is far more violent. After ingestion, its power transforms into true essence, surging like an avalanche. The cultivator inevitably suffers impact; a single pill imposes a heavy burden. After escaping danger, they must quickly find a place to recover, or they risk damaging their foundation!</p><p>Despite this, the pill's value is undeniable.</p><p>In a crisis, it's like having an extra life!</p><p>The other two recipes found with the Boiling Snow Pill have different effects, each with its own merits. They share one thing in common: their extremely high difficulty in refinement.</p><p>Many other recipes of nearly equal value are present, including spirit pills beneficial to cultivation that could greatly benefit both Hua Shen and his main body.</p><p>Since he doesn't know alchemy and hasn't cultivated relationships with alchemy masters in Zhongzhou, gathering the herbs would be troublesome.  He temporarily put the recipes away for future planning.</p><p>The jade slips contain numerous writings on alchemy, all masterpieces, likely the crystallized wisdom of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's alchemists across generations.</p><p>Much of the content is profound and obscure, some apparently from a Hua Shen-level cultivator. Qin Sang skimmed through them, feeling dizzy and confused, as if reading a heavenly scripture.</p><p>He understood the value of this content.  This single jade slip alone could nurture a master alchemist, but he still needed to consider whether he would dedicate himself to alchemy in the future.</p><p>Judging by alchemy alone, this represents the foundation of a top-tier sect.</p><p>Unknown to Qin Sang, the five lineages of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect were independent yet each had its own strengths.  The Water Phase Palace was renowned for its alchemy, even surpassing the Fire Phase Palace in fame.</p><p>He surmised that these recipes were the entire collection of the Water Phase lineage. However, the Water Phase lineage's cultivation techniques and divine abilities certainly extend beyond these jade slips.</p><p>The water-based techniques left by Baigu were more refined, lacking the power of ice-based cultivation methods.</p><p>"Was the other part of the inheritance taken by the tomb's owner?"</p><p>He recalled the jade box taken by Yan Shan Laoren, perhaps it was inside.</p><p>Next were the magical artifacts, all quite powerful, but none were spiritual treasures.  One damaged artifact, a broken blade, seemed to have been a pseudo-spiritual treasure when intact.</p><p>Huasheng put them away, turning to the last item: a set of tokens neatly arranged together.</p><p>These tokens were strangely shaped, made of a material similar to black iron, red on top and white on the bottom, seven in total.</p><p>The upper half had an uneven edge, like a swirling mass of crimson flame, while the lower half was perfectly regular, resembling a piece of clear, dark ice.</p><p>"Ice and Fire Tokens?"</p><p>Huasheng picked one up. It felt pleasantly cool, neither hot nor cold.  After examining them for a while, he gave them a name;  he hadn't seen any mention of such tokens in the jade slips.</p><p>Perhaps Baigu ran out of time to record them, or perhaps he intentionally concealed this information.</p><p>He scanned the token with his spiritual sense and probed it with true energy.  It wasn't a magical artifact, but its crafting technique was quite ingenious, resembling an array component.</p><p>Unfortunately, Baigu hadn't left behind any spiritual arrays.</p><p>However, Huasheng sensed a peculiar and familiar energy from the token, causing him to look at the mysterious ice disk.  Putting them together yielded no reaction.</p><p>He had a hunch that the two artifacts were connected!</p><p>Unable to determine the reason for now, Huasheng passed Baigu's remains, noticing a path ahead leading deeper into the secret passage.</p><p>Shortly after, he found a hidden chamber.</p><p>Before entering, Huasheng felt an immediate sense of pressure, confirming that the chamber was the source of the ethereal blue light.</p><p>If he guessed correctly, this was the eye of the Bingyi Palace formation!</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>He easily pushed open the door.</p><p>The sight inside the chamber revealed an extremely complex flag array.</p><p>The array was damaged.</p><p>The spiritual array had eighty-one nodes, with magical flags erected between them.  An intact array would have been incredibly powerful, but now most of it was missing.</p><p>The remaining flags were also severely damaged.</p><p>A rough count revealed only three or five flags were relatively intact. The remaining flags supported the fragmented array, drawing from the spirit veins and running on their own, barely maintaining the ethereal blue light outside.</p><p>The most striking feature was the center of the array, where an ice platform stood, bearing a circular recess, matching the size and shape of the mysterious ice disk!</p><p>However, there was no place for the Ice and Fire Tokens.</p><p>"The ice disk is indeed the treasure suppressing the array's eye!"</p><p>As soon as Huasheng had this thought, a bone-chilling cold wind swept towards him.</p><p>Within the array, streams of cold energy flowed constantly, sensing the presence of an outsider and launching a counterattack.</p><p>Huasheng remained calm, using the mysterious ice disk as a shield.</p><p>As expected, the cold energy dissipated upon contact with the ice disk.</p><p>Using the ice disk to clear the way, Huasheng easily reached the ice platform.  After carefully observing the array and pondering for a moment, he attempted to place the mysterious ice disk into the recess.</p><p>'Click!'</p><p>The disk fit perfectly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the array didn't activate as he anticipated. Instead, it rapidly absorbed energy from the spirit veins, directing this energy not to support the array itself, but towards the central ice platform.</p><p>The ice platform glowed again.</p><p>Huasheng could clearly see a beam of tangible cold light inside the platform, revolving around the ice disk and undergoing strange changes.</p><p>This unprecedented sight piqued his curiosity.</p><p>After staring for a long time, he suddenly understood.</p><p>"So this is the array's purpose!  The ice disk doesn't suppress the array's eye; the array is used to nurture the ice disk, accumulating its power…"</p><p>The ice disk only contained cold煞 energy.</p><p>During cultivation, he sensed that for every bit of cold煞 energy absorbed, a corresponding amount was lost from the ice disk.</p><p>The ice disk could regenerate, otherwise it wouldn't be able to continuously support the Water Aspect Master's arrangements above the tomb, but this process was undoubtedly extremely slow.</p><p>The Bingyi Palace formation could accelerate the recovery of the cold煞 energy!</p><p>"No, it's not that simple. The ice disk also suppresses the array's eye and can in turn nourish the array.  The two complement each other, a truly ingenious mechanism!"</p><p>Huasheng placed his hand above the ice disk. Through it, he immediately felt a connection with the magical flags within the array.</p><p>Simultaneously, Huasheng made an unexpected discovery.</p><p>Beside the array, concealed by it, was another secret space!</p><p>"The Bingyi Palace's layout is so complex…"</p><p>Huasheng muttered to himself, glancing down, curious about what else was hidden there.  He had found the array's eye, even obtained the inheritance of the Water Aspect lineage, yet it wasn't the end.</p><p>He calmed himself and began to explore the spirit formation.  While he could sense the treasure banners through the ice disc, this was only possible with the few intact ones.  Maintaining the formation for so long was already quite difficult; the damaged banners were on the verge of collapse, a minor fluctuation could cause them to crumble.</p><p>A careless mistake could even cause the entire Ice Instrument Palace to collapse.</p><p>His avatar carefully touched the ice disc, activating the formation.  With utmost caution, he finally heard a 'click-click' sound, and saw the adjacent stone wall slowly slide open, revealing a dark space.</p><p>This space was clearly much larger.  He hadn't realized it before, but upon seeing this mysterious space, his avatar realized that this was the true center of the Ice Instrument Palace, not the hall where the spirit formation was located.</p><p>His avatar paused, leaving the ice disc on the ice platform, and stepped inside.</p><p>"嘶, such intricate restrictions…"</p><p>Seeing the layout of the space, his avatar was secretly startled.  The restrictions on the walls were dense and overwhelming.</p><p>In the center of the space was another spirit formation, even more complex than the one outside.  However, it was currently dormant, not in operation.</p><p>His avatar glanced at it and immediately understood that it lacked the treasures to support it. The formation was shaped like a Tai Chi shaped altar. While the altar's surroundings were empty, the ground was filled with countless grooves. Upon seeing the grooves, his avatar retrieved the Water-Fire Tokens, and sure enough, they fit perfectly!</p><p>The Water-Fire Tokens were meant to be part of the grooves. However, he only had seven, while there were forty-nine grooves on the ground!</p><p>Furthermore, his avatar discovered that the Tai Chi altar had a place for meditation, with two recesses, one at the Yang and one at the Yin position.  The Yin position was identical to the ice platform outside and was clearly meant for the ice disc. The Yang position was sized for a jade pendant.</p><p>"Such a complex formation, requiring both the ice disc and another treasure of no less importance… it must have an extraordinary purpose. I wonder what it's used for…"</p><p>His avatar pondered. To know, he had to try. But he only had the ice disc, and was far short of the needed Water-Fire Tokens.</p><p>After some thought, he decided to try anyway. He lifted the ice disc from the ice platform, returned to the Tai Chi altar, inserted the seven Water-Fire Tokens at intervals, then sat cross-legged on the altar, tentatively placing the ice disc in the Yin position.</p><p>Lacking one treasure, the formation wouldn't be complete, even if an accident occurred, he could still escape.</p><p>The altar showed no unusual activity. But the moment the ice disc was in place, the restrictions on all four walls lit up.</p><p>‘呼…’</p><p>Suddenly, his avatar saw with horror that formless flames were floating in the space.</p><p>"Yin Fire!"</p><p>His avatar's voice was hoarse, his hair standing on end. Qin Sang had gone through the three calamities after reaching Yuan Ying, how could he not recognize Yin Fire? However, the Yin Fire of the Yuan Ying tribulation was nothing compared to this; only the legendary transformation tribulation would be this terrifying!</p><p>His avatar was about to flee in panic, when he realized that the Yin Fire wasn't real, but an illusion projected by the wall restrictions. When he saw the scene within the illusion, his avatar sat frozen.</p><p>In the illusion:</p><p>Yin Fire filled the sky. Inside the Yin Fire, a Daoist, their face blurry, seemed to be undergoing a tribulation.  Beneath the Daoist was this Tai Chi altar!  However, the Tai Chi altar was complete with treasures, with all forty-nine Water-Fire Tokens in place, the ice disc in the Yin position and a crimson immortal pendant in the Yang position!</p><p>The ice disc and immortal pendant both shone brightly.  A chilling aura shot up, forming an ice pillar. The pendant emitted a pillar of fire, its body seeming to melt. The forty-nine Water-Fire Tokens and the two treasures' auras connected, rising together to circle the Daoist.</p><p>At that moment, the extreme Yin and extreme Yang energy, after passing through the altar and Water-Fire Tokens, didn't clash, but converged into a strange force, flowing around the altar and the Daoist. As this energy approached, the Daoist's trembling lessened considerably. The power of the formless Yin Fire was greatly reduced!</p><p>"This is the tribulation scene of a Wu Xiang Immortal Sect ancestor!  A tribulation formation! And it's a transformation tribulation!"</p><p>His avatar's eyes widened. He never imagined that the ice disc was a tribulation treasure.</p><p>"Can it only overcome the first calamity, or all of them?"</p><p>Holding his breath, his avatar watched closely.  Unfortunately, the image was too blurry to see the details of the Daoist's tribulation, but he still gained many insights.</p><p>Finally, the Daoist successfully passed the Yin Fire calamity. The next calamity was about to arrive, but the Daoist hadn't closed the altar, and the power of the formation grew even stronger.</p><p>Just then, his avatar was startled by a sound. Looking down, he saw that the Water-Fire Tokens on the ground were nearing destruction. The treasures were incomplete, the Yin and Yang were unbalanced.  And with the insufficient number of Water-Fire Tokens, they couldn't hold on much longer.</p><p>He quickly put away the ice disc. In an instant, the illusion dissipated, the restrictions on the four walls fell silent, but the images from the illusion were deeply imprinted in his mind.</p>
