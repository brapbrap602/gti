<h1>Chapter 1859: The Sea-Swallowing Clam</h1><p>An unexpected attack proved ineffective.  Ling You Wang, no longer concealing himself, repeatedly attempted to draw upon the water essence within the nearby illusions, but each attempt was thwarted by other illusions.</p><p>Having learned her lesson, Qin Sang deliberately kept his distance from any illusion that Ling You Wang might exploit, expending significantly more time than anticipated.</p><p>Now deeply wary of the Demon King, Qin Sang abandoned any thoughts of counterattack and ceased using illusions to hinder Ling You Wang, focusing solely on escaping towards the jungle region.</p><p>“I still have a long way to go…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Cultivating both his body and his Dao, possessing spiritual treasures and powerful divine abilities, his current strength was undoubtedly formidable amongst his peers; his battle with Ding Xiang Hou had been exhilarating.  </p><p>Yet, facing a self-diminished Demon King, he felt consistently outmatched.  Ling You Wang’s divine abilities, their immense power and unpredictable transformations, left Qin Sang awestruck.</p><p>He wondered if any prodigies existed who could contend with a Demon King at the Nascent Soul stage.  At least, Qin Sang couldn't, even though he had nearly slain Ding Xiang Hou.</p><p>Perhaps upon reaching the peak of both the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang* and *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, he might stand a chance against Ling You Wang.</p><p>This chase left Qin Sang thoroughly battered, yet also profoundly insightful. He felt he had gained much, though he lacked the opportunity to calmly reflect upon his experiences, instead imprinting every move of Ling You Wang upon his memory.</p><p>Ling You Wang, particularly in the Dao of Divine Abilities, was a masterful teacher.  Nascent Soul demon cultivators lacked the profound understanding of divine abilities possessed by Demon Kings.</p><p>Observing a true battle between Demon Kings might be overwhelming, limited by one's cultivation and perception. A Demon King who had self-diminished their power—a rare occurrence once every ten thousand years—was undoubtedly the best instructor.</p><p>This thought brought a wave of regret.  He had encountered Ling You Wang too soon.  A few centuries later, with further advancement and true ability to rival the Demon King, and with his superior knowledge of the terrain, Qin Sang might have had a chance to defeat, even kill him.</p><p>Such a battle could very well lead to complete mastery of the eleventh layer of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, greatly assisting his breakthrough to the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>His mind raced.</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang remained focused, his attention locked on Ling You Wang, tracking his every move.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ling You Wang kept his gaze fixed on the thunderbolt that was Qin Sang, the dark eyes of his black fish divine form flashing strangely.</p><p>A Demon King's perception was naturally exceptional. Even with Qin Sang’s best efforts at concealment, subtle clues inevitably betrayed him, observed by Ling You Wang.</p><p>The fact that Qin Sang had previously avoided the illusions containing water essence suggested special abilities. His unfailing ability to avoid illusions imbued with water essence, hindering the Demon King's divine abilities, was no coincidence; he must possess intimate knowledge of the layout of the illusions here.</p><p>This made the situation very intriguing.</p><p>“Does this youth truly have no recourse, until he is hunted to exhaustion and captured?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Ling You Wang’s mind, sharpening his expression.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sudden chill.  Knowing he could not indefinitely deceive Ling You Wang's perception, he looked ahead, deciding the time had come, and abandoned his disguise.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The thunderbolt tore through the sky, flying straight ahead, crossing the illusions, and heading directly for the jungle region!</p><p>Ling You Wang snorted coldly. The long tail of the black fish divine form lashed out, striking heavily against the dark waves.</p><p>*Splash!*</p><p>Waves surged skyward as the fish leapt.  Simultaneously, the black fish divine form raised its head high, its mouth gaping open in a silent roar.  A gray mist erupted from its throat.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The gray mist filled the air, a faint outline appearing in the dim void, like an open book.  As it became clearer, it resolved into two clam shells.</p><p>Their interior was jade-like, studded with numerous glittering points, like pearls embedded in the shells. The outer shell was dull gray, unremarkable.</p><p>The clam shells were half-open, the flesh inside hollowed out, clearly not alive, but a refined magical treasure.</p><p>This treasure was known as the Sea-Swallowing Clam, the oldest spiritual treasure in Ling You Wang's possession.</p><p>The clam shells appeared within the gray mist, aimed at the distant thunderbolt, the inner points radiating a brilliant light.  Strangely, the light brightened intensely, then became incredibly dim in an instant.</p><p>Simultaneously, this area, including the space around Qin Sang, suddenly darkened, as if twilight had descended.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The black fish divine form swept its tail, raising a wave that washed over the clam shells.</p><p>The exterior of the clam shells grew even darker, almost black, accompanied by faint clicking sounds. The two shells began to close, and as they did, the Sea-Swallowing Clam itself gradually became translucent, and then vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang witnessed a horrifying scene.</p><p>Their current illusory landscape lacked a discernible sky or earth; they were adrift in a boundless void, where wisps of white, like swirling snow, filled every corner.</p><p>As the Swallowing Sea Clam closed, the surrounding area grew darker, even Qin Sang's escape light seemed suppressed and dimmed.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang noticed the white wisps ahead compressing into a massive white roller, hurtling towards him, drawing in all the surrounding wisps in its path.  Although the wisps were as light as catkins, and the roller seemingly not overly heavy, it exerted an immense sense of oppression.</p><p>Upon recognizing the true source of the anomaly, Qin Sang's face paled, and he abruptly halted his escape.  What was rolling down wasn't mere wisps; it was the void itself!</p><p>The void seemed to be warped by a terrifying force. The white roller thundered down, making Qin Sang look minuscule and utterly vulnerable to being crushed.  Worse, the void ahead was folding in on itself; regardless of his speed, there was no escape.</p><p>Retreat was impossible; Ling You Wang waited behind, watching intently.</p><p>In reality, the void wasn't altered; cultivators at the Transcendence stage lacked the ability to manipulate it.  Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he could sense the abnormality, guessing it stemmed from the clam's power. The void's folding was an illusion, but its power was real, as was the danger.</p><p>Even understanding this, Qin Sang couldn't find a weakness quickly.  His only recourse was to meet force with force!</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>The white roller reached him. Qin Sang felt a crushing pressure, a suffocating sense of being compressed by the void itself.</p><p>Just then, the Sky Eye Butterfly issued another warning.</p><p>From behind.</p><p>After unleashing the Swallowing Sea Clam, the Black Fish Dharma Form's long tail thrashed, its mouth opening to release a burst of white light.</p><p>Within the light was a jade-white pearl.</p><p>The pearl slowly rotated above the Dharma Form's head, and a white line extended from it, growing longer as the pearl shrunk, eventually forming a several-zhang-long white string.</p><p>The taut string emitted a gentle white light, appearing harmless but concealing its nature as a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The Black Fish Dharma Form moved its head; two long, dragon-like whiskers sprang forth, catching the string.</p><p>The light intensified, the string twisted, merging into the whiskers, changing their texture to match the string's.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’ ‘Whizz!’</p><p>The fish-form twisted its body, its tail raised, its body arched, as the two whiskers shot towards the tail.  The whiskers intertwined, wrapping around the tail end, the Black Fish Dharma Form's body suddenly stretching.</p><p>‘Twang!’</p><p>A resonant bowstring sound echoed, lingering in the air.  The Black Fish Dharma Form transformed into a longbow; without an archer, the bowstring drew back, aimed at Qin Sang, a full moon.</p><p>A blinding white light gathered at the bowstring.</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart pounded, a sharp pain spreading through his body, a sense of inescapable doom.  The void folded ahead, and a spiritual arrow locked onto him behind.</p><p>In desperation, Qin Sang flung out his sleeve, unleashing five-colored light accompanied by a crown.  Qin Sang finally dared not hold back.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown hovered before Qin Sang, radiating five-colored light, beautiful and regal, strangely extraordinary.  As if alive, its light pulsed rhythmically, like the breath of a living being.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Seeing the Five Elements Crown, the Black Fish Dharma Form's eyes gleamed, instantly recognizing the treasure's power, a sense of foreboding rising within it.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Turbulent waves surged again, transforming into mist in mid-air and dissipating.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The white roller crashed into Qin Sang, the void folding over itself.  Qin Sang remained unmoved; the Five Elements Crown blazed, its five-colored light weaving into a mighty Five Elements Banishing Divine Light.</p><p>Compared to the Swallowing Sea Clam's spectacle, this light seemed insignificant.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Five Elements Banishing Divine Light pierced the white roller.  A large section of the roller where it struck was emptied, the white wisps vanished.  Then the light shot into the void, as if hitting an invisible wall, creating a deafening roar.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the entire space tremble; cracks appeared where the light struck, filled with five-colored radiance.</p><p>A fissure in the void suddenly collapsed, revealing a large hole. Bright light poured from the opening, revealing the true nature of the illusion.</p><p>This divine light was the Reversed Five Elements Banishing Light, a single, decisive strike!</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed slightly. He had confidence in the power of the Five Elements Crown, but the effectiveness of even the finest treasures varied depending on their wielder. Even an ordinary treasure wielded by a demon king should not be underestimated.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang grabbed the Five Elements Crown and appeared at the edge of the hole.</p><p>Ling You Wang witnessed everything, a rare flicker of annoyance crossing the dark fish-like features of his avatar.  If it were a Daoist Grandmaster, such tenacity wouldn't be surprising. But this person, clearly an unknown, possessed endless magical abilities and treasures, even escaping the Sea Swallowing Clam.</p><p>Another reason: Ling You Wang learned from Ding Xiang Hou that this person possessed methods to control unclean treasures. He dared not let the Sea Swallowing Clam get too close, thus diminishing its power.  Even so, being countered with a single blow was beyond his expectation.</p><p>His eyes fixed on the Five Elements Crown, as if trying to penetrate its secrets. Simultaneously, his long whiskers tensed, the white glow stretching out to form a light arrow.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The bowstring vibrated.</p><p>The arrow flew.</p><p>The light arrow's speed surpassed even thunder, striking just as Qin Sang appeared at the opening. In a flash, the arrowhead was less than an inch from his neck.</p><p>In mortal danger, Qin Sang neither turned nor dodged.  To evade now, and risk the hole closing, would leave him unable to unleash a second Reversed Five Elements Banishing Light.</p><p>His blood surged like thunder. The Ming Shan Armor shone brilliantly, its light gathering at the back of the neck. Waves rippled as the armor plates transformed into a sheet of flowing water.</p><p>The white light blazed, waves shimmering as the ten-zhang long arrow plunged deep into the water. The fragment of the true treasure, as hoped, was not pierced, blocking the fatal blow.</p><p>But the next moment, Qin Sang sensed something amiss.  A quick thought clarified the situation. Startled, he immediately activated the Ming Shan Armor, redistributing the power of the true treasure fragment throughout the armor plates.</p><p>Simultaneously, the light arrow exploded, countless sharp fragments engulfing Qin Sang. Had he been slower, he would have been torn apart.</p><p>"Indeed, cunning old fox!" Qin Sang coldly snorted. Ling You Wang must have recognized the Ming Shan Armor's transformation from their previous fight. Luckily, his reaction was swift enough.</p><p>‘Plop plop plop…’</p><p>The arrow fragments covered his body, all blocked by the armor plates.  Though unharmed, Qin Sang felt a tremendous force hit his back, as if struck by a mountain. His face paled, his internal organs felt displaced, but thanks to his cultivated Diamond Glass Body, the internal injuries were minor.</p><p>Using the force, he lunged forward, the thunderous light dimming and then brightening again.</p><p>‘Whoosh…’</p><p>The lingering power of the Dark Fish avatar reached the opening – too late. Two long whiskers detached from its tail, the Sea Swallowing Clam rising from below, suspended in the dark waves, slowly opening and closing.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's escape, Ling You Wang looked thoughtful.  If before he wanted to reclaim the Diamond Reality, now his interest in Qin Sang himself had grown stronger.</p><p>Ling You Wang wasn't unwilling to continue pursuing Qin Sang, it simply wasn't as effortless as it seemed.  Though he possessed a demon king's insight and solid cultivation at the Cave Profound Realm, using his avatar and divine abilities, even controlling treasures, was extremely taxing.</p><p>But giving up was impossible.  A Cave Profound cultivator with so many skills was extraordinary; Ling You Wang didn't believe he possessed anything stronger than the crown.</p><p>He had to observe what other resources the other party relied on before deciding what to do.  Furthermore, Ling You Wang judged that controlling the crown wasn't easy for Qin Sang; otherwise, he wouldn't have risked taking that arrow.</p><p>This was true.  Since the fight with Ding Xiang Hou began, Qin Sang hadn't had a moment to recover. Still at the Divine Transformation mid-stage, his true essence was depleted, forcing him to take the risk.  He needed to reach the forest domain as quickly as possible to draw upon the spiritual wood's energy to resist the demon king and recover his true essence.</p><p>Ling You Wang didn't retract his treasures; the dark waves propelled the Sea Swallowing Clam forward.</p><p>They chased across countless illusions, traversing a vast distance. Finally, a familiar sight greeted Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>A green canopy stretched ahead, green winds piled into thick walls, remarkably distinct amidst the other illusions.</p><p>"Finally!" Qin Sang let out a long breath, glancing back to see a dark tide surging behind him.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang crashed into the wall, feeling himself enveloped by abundant and pure spiritual wood energy, absorbed rapidly by his spiritual wood body, swiftly restoring him.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Qin Sang plunged into the forest, sending up a shower of leaves. Near his landing spot, several ancient trees moved rhythmically, a dozen banners rising from the crowns, forming an array in the blink of an eye. (End)</p>
