<h1>Chapter 1678: Appearance</h1><p>Within the mountain.</p><p>Amidst a brilliant golden light, a golden-armored giant stood tall, his form somewhat ethereal, yet his every move possessed unparalleled might.  The golden armor worn by Zhu Wu Dao was a treasure meticulously crafted over many years by the Qu Yang Mountain lineage, inscribed with countless arrays and defensive enchantments.</p><p>The Demon Lord was sealed deep within the Tian Tong Palace; Zhu Wu Dao needed to pass through the outer celestial barriers to reach him. The armor and the Spirit-Subduing Incense were prepared for this very purpose, their power undeniable.  Now, Zhu Wu Dao was activating all the arrays on the armor, regardless of the cost, even if it meant destroying the armor itself. His aim was to eliminate external interference and buy himself time.</p><p>The Demon Child had just been unsealed and was at its weakest. Missing this opportunity meant losing the best chance. Once the Demon Child regained its strength, Zhu Wu Dao would be forced to submit, an outcome he desperately wanted to avoid.</p><p>The golden-armored giant detached from Zhu Wu Dao's body, taking a step upward. The boundless golden light instantly transformed into a golden wheel, rotating around the giant as its center.  Within the wheel, countless runes formed incredibly complex arrays, creating numerous smaller golden wheels that layered upon each other, creating an immensely thick defense.  Zhu Wu Dao hid beneath the golden wheel.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The sounds of metal clashing rang out repeatedly. Golden rays burst from the wheel, enveloping the golden-armored giant in dazzling light, as if burning with golden flames.</p><p>Fan Laomo and He Gao Zhenren noticed the commotion below.  Though unsure of the situation, they instinctively sensed an opportunity and unleashed their treasures, attacking the giant.</p><p>At that moment, a figure descended from the sky.</p><p>It was the Poison King.</p><p>Qin Sang's Gu King held immense significance for the Poison King, but was unfortunately entangled with Qin Sang's incarnation.  The incarnation, wielding a spiritual treasure and the chilling Ice Soul Light, kept the Poison King at bay.</p><p>Knowing he wouldn't gain an advantage against Qin Sang here, the Poison King, after learning of the change in the mountain from He Gao Zhenren, didn't hesitate long before dealing with the most pressing threat.</p><p>Wan Du Mountain had closer ties with Gan Lu Temple. While there were disagreements with the Daoist sect, there was no deep-seated hatred.  Zi Lei Zhenren's ascension to the Transcendence Realm merely solidified the Daoist sect's dominant position.  The cultivation world's structure wouldn't drastically change, and Wan Du Mountain, located far in Manzhou, would be even less affected.  The Poison King was pleased to resolve this immediate problem.</p><p>The Poison King knew the severity of the Demon Calamity. Wan Du Mountain, bordering Nan Zhou, would be among the first top sects to suffer if the calamity struck again.</p><p>Fan Laomo glanced around, letting out a light chuckle.  Tian Hao Tower and the Daoist and Buddhist sects were constantly in conflict, and he had no real connection with He Gao Zhenren and the Poison King, even harboring some resentment, yet now they were joining forces.  After learning of the current situation from He Gao Zhenren, the Poison King immediately took action.</p><p>Three grand cultivators attacked together.</p><p>A dense golden glow nearly erupted from Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>Under the relentless assault, the golden-armored giant, despite its powerful defense, couldn’t withstand it. It was forced to its knees, its form gradually shrinking.</p><p>At this very moment…</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao had already extracted and absorbed the Demon Child's essence!</p><p>The instant the essence entered his body, Zhu Wu Dao paused.  Within the essence was a demonic shadow, the remnant will of the Demon Child.  As he absorbed it, he met the shadow’s gaze – the expected furious rage was there.</p><p>The shadow's mouth opened wide, as if roaring, but Zi Lei Zhenren's tribulation was imminent, and Zhu Wu Dao wouldn't allow the Demon Child to sway him.</p><p>The Demon Child's essence entered his body.  Zhu Wu Dao was momentarily stunned. Amidst the rage, there seemed to be a hint of mockery?</p><p>He couldn't dwell on it; the impact of the Demon Child's essence was already like a tidal wave, threatening to shatter his primordial spirit instantly.</p><p>He was currently using an ancient demonic technique, a brutal method to merge the other's essence and strengthen himself—a form of absorption. This was a gamble, but Zhu Wu Dao believed he had a high chance of winning. The situation didn't allow for thorough preparation; the opportunity was fleeting, so he seized it.</p><p>At this time, the Spirit-Subduing Incense's effects became apparent.</p><p>The incense ignited.</p><p>There was no scent, only a wisp of green smoke that drifted towards Zhu Wu Dao's nose, entering his body and nourishing his primordial spirit.  This wisp of incense ensured that even amidst the Demon Child's stubborn counterattack, Zhu Wu Dao maintained a degree of clarity, protecting his foundation and sustaining the secret technique.</p><p>Soon, Zhu Wu Dao's essence and the demon's essence merged. He could feel the demon's will slipping into chaos.  His own consciousness was also blurring, his body swaying, but the absorption proceeded smoothly, relentlessly.</p><p>The demon's resistance was far weaker than Zhu Wu Dao anticipated, clearly weakened by the seal. His desperate attempt to break free had likely left him vulnerable.</p><p>His strategy of using the purple lightning to exhaust the demon proved correct.</p><p>The golden giant, repeatedly struck, its golden wheel shattered, was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>Just as Zi Lei Zhen Ren faced his heart demon tribulation, the three attacking the golden giant sensed the change above and their faces fell.</p><p>A crane’s shadow soared, its cry piercing.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo and Du Wang exchanged a look, utterly astonished that Zi Lei Zhen Ren would falter in his tribulation.</p><p>Below the golden giant, a similar tragedy unfolded.</p><p>As the secret technique neared completion, and Zhu Wu Dao merged with the demon's essence, his cultivation began to surge, but the Heavenly Demon Sound, channeled through the demon's essence, invaded his mind palace, shattering his hopes of ascension!</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>A shrill scream tore through the air.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao suddenly awoke, blood streaming from his seven orifices.</p><p>His eyes were wide, bloodshot, his face contorted in agony.</p><p>While the calming incense had stabilized his mind, its power was ultimately limited. It could barely withstand the demon's influence, let alone the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>He finally understood the mockery in the demon's eyes.</p><p>Heaven… had changed!</p><p>In fact, the demon had been enduring the torment of the Heavenly Demon Sound.  The change in Heaven's will affected them all equally.</p><p>Years ago, the demon’s corruption of the Five Elements Crown had been interrupted by the sudden appearance of the Heavenly Demon Sound.  By the time he had regained his composure to continue, it was too late; the demon spirit had already taken root.</p><p>Facing the relentless pressure of the seal, the demon spirit ever-present, his situation was worse than that of Hui Guang Shengzhe and Qing Hu Sheng Wang imprisoned in Wu Wang Palace.  The Heavenly Demon Sound inflicted far greater damage.</p><p>To break free, the demon had risked everything, frantically assaulting the seal while simultaneously enduring the horrifying assault of the Heavenly Demon Sound.</p><p>Surrounded by enemies, he couldn't reveal his weakness, lest Zhu Wu Dao, his ancient demon follower, turn against him.</p><p>Yet, despite showing no sign of weakness, Zhu Wu Dao, audacious to a fault, dared to attack.  Simultaneously beset by the seal, the Heavenly Demon Sound, external enemies, and Zhu Wu Dao, he was finally caught off guard.</p><p>At the crucial moment of fusion, Zhu Wu Dao's Dao heart shattered. He let out a non-human roar, his features contorted, black demonic energy erupting from his seven orifices, staining his blood black, tearing his skin, enveloping his body.</p><p>In moments, Zhu Wu Dao was barely recognizable, more a demonic husk consumed by dark energy, his roar deforming, becoming eerily similar to the demon's voice.</p><p>Then, another upheaval.</p><p>The seal suddenly sank, and a five-colored crown emerged from the depression.</p><p>The crown radiated a brilliant, untainted light.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The golden wheel shattered, the golden giant's body disintegrated into several pieces, reverting to its golden armor form, its luster dulled, its power gone, flung away.</p><p>Fan Lao Mo and Du Wang descended, witnessing the demonic body sinking with the seal.</p><p>The five-colored crown descended upon the demonic body, an immense force pressing it down, until it was swallowed by the seal!</p><p>As they say, experience is the best teacher.</p><p>After two failed schemes, the demon spirit finally understood the value of patience.</p><p>Feigning severe defilement, it diligently cleansed itself of the foul sand, observing until the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>It had long coveted the demon, its creator!</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The Five Elements Crown was placed firmly upon the demonic body.</p><p>The crown vibrated slightly, its five-colored light cascading down, instantly suppressing the demonic energy.  Then, a faint luminescence flickered, penetrating the demonic body's brow.</p><p>Meanwhile, within Zhu Wu Dao's Purple Mansion, his primordial spirit had almost completely merged with the demonic shadow, becoming a demon soul.</p><p>Zhuge Wudao's consciousness is almost entirely lost, his demonic soul dominated by the demonic child. However, the demonic child was ambushed by Zhuge Wudao, his essence stripped away, leaving him virtually defenseless. In this weakened state, he was assaulted by the Heavenly Demon's Sound, its madness infecting him. He needs to stabilize his Dao heart first.</p><p>If the demonic child can withstand the Heavenly Demon's Sound and survive, he can be reborn in Zhuge Wudao's body.</p><p>At this crucial moment, the Demonic Spirit arrived.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The demonic soul was struck by an invisible force, originating from the light speck that drifted in.</p><p>The demonic soul became more agonizing, more twisted, emitting a silent scream. Its consciousness flickered between confusion and brief moments of lucidity, seemingly muttering something.  It was likely observing Zhuge Wudao's fate.</p><p>But the Demonic Spirit remained unmoved.  This was an unparalleled opportunity for her.</p><p>The outside world's strongest opponent had failed their tribulation.  By seizing the demonic child's true essence, she would be unmatched, free to devour cultivators at will.</p><p>Within Zhuge Wudao's Purple Mansion, a luminous glow formed a tiny phantom, resembling a female cultivator from the Yutai Sect, though reduced to an infinitesimal size.  With icy eyes, she observed the demonic soul.</p><p>Her small hands moved repeatedly, invisible shocks pounding the demonic soul.</p><p>With each action of the Demonic Spirit, the demonic soul grew more ethereal, its lucid moments shorter, its expression dominated by madness and confusion—signs of imminent assimilation by the Heavenly Demon's Sound.</p><p>Until the demonic child's consciousness became muddled.</p><p>'Whizz!'</p><p>The Demonic Spirit plunged directly into the demonic soul.</p><p>A piercing shriek echoed through the mountain's depths.</p><p>Above and below, changes surged.  Elder Fan and the Poison King, still unsure of the cause, watched the seal as the submerged demonic body suddenly burst forth.</p><p>The demonic body was identical, yet its aura was radically different.  It wore a Five Elements Crown, seemingly integrated with the treasure, and the power of the seal was drawn to it, five-colored radiance swirling around it like a radiant robe.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The demonic body opened its eyes, one pupil blood-red, the other black, its gaze filled with uncontrollable chaos and madness, fixed on the two figures above.</p><p>Then, the demonic body's eyes blazed with bloodthirsty desire!</p><p>As a being akin to a spirit weapon, it too was affected by the Heavenly Demon's Sound. Fortunately, the demonic child's true essence no longer guarded against it. However, it craved the life essence of cultivators, urgently needing to devour them to strengthen itself and hasten the absorption of the true essence, thus better resisting the Heavenly Demon's Sound!</p><p>Unlike before, now back in its original form, its power was incomparable.</p><p>Upon seeing the demonic body's murderous gaze, Elder Fan muttered, "Not good!", and shot upwards without hesitation.  Simultaneously, the petals of his Myriad Illusion Nether Lotus snapped shut, countless lotus shadows and illusionary demons returning to him, forming layers of protective illusions.</p><p>At the same time, the demonic body raised an arm and pointed upwards.</p><p>The Five Elements Crown's light blazed, five differently colored beams of light soaring skyward.  Not only did they wield the power of the treasure, but they also channeled the power of the seal, shattering the illusionary demons with devastating force, striking directly at Elder Fan's true form.</p><p>The five-colored beams seemed to possess a binding power, instantly forming a cage to imprison Elder Fan.</p><p>The next moment, an unexpected sight unfolded. The figure within the cage suddenly transformed, becoming one of the illusionary demons that had guarded Elder Fan.  There was only one such demon, constantly at Elder Fan's side.  Now, the illusionary demon shielded its master.</p><p>Elder Fan's true body appeared outside the cage, his face ashen. His Myriad Illusion Nether Lotus seemed somewhat fainter. He didn't hesitate, fleeing towards the mountain's edge.</p><p>While Elder Fan was attacked, the Poison King also suffered the same fate.</p><p>The Demonic Spirit fought two at once, another five-colored beam striking the Poison King.</p><p>The Poison King lacked Elder Fan's ability to shift between forms. Although he held his sacred artifact, the demonic body's attack was too swift; the artifact had no chance to activate its powers.</p><p>Before the sacred artifact could poison the demonic body, it was imprisoned by the five-colored beam!</p><p>In this critical moment, the Poison King decisively pierced his palm, forcing out his lifeblood and feeding it to the sacred artifact.</p><p>Immediately, the sacred artifact emitted a piercing shriek, spewing poisonous smoke.  Similar to the previous Annihilation Smoke, yet different, the smoke was denser and didn't drift towards the opponent, but instead swirled around the Poison King.</p><p>In an instant, thick poisonous smoke completely enveloped the Poison King, resembling a grey cocoon.</p><p>The five-colored beam arrived swiftly, intending to imprison the Poison King, yet it was met by the cocoon, the light penetrating but being repelled.</p><p>This wasn't the Poison King surrendering.  As the change occurred, he sensed a familiar, powerful aura approaching the mountain peak.</p><p>The Hui Guang Saint!</p><p>...</p><p>Outside the mountain.</p><p>The Hui Guang Saint watched silently as the Zi Lei True Person perished in the Demon Tribulation.</p><p>The situation was more severe than anticipated.</p><p>Zi Lei True Person vividly demonstrated the combined power of the Heavenly Demon's Sound and the Demon Tribulation, confirming their previous assessment.</p><p>Even a Buddhist monk, the abbot of the Ganlu Chan Monastery, would not possess a stronger Dao heart than Zi Lei True Person.</p><p>It could be concluded that this world would no longer produce Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>They could find no more allies.</p><p>While contemplating this, the Hui Guang Saint suddenly looked down, gazing at Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>Within the mountain's depths, an incredibly powerful demonic intent was brewing.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King, who had arrived later, also sensed this, immediately leaving his followers and rushing towards the mountain.</p>
