<h1>Chapter 375 The Counter-Ambush</h1><p>Facing the two-pronged attack, the cultivator surnamed Bao, alone and outnumbered, quickly faltered.  With escape impossible, he attempted suicide, but it was too late. He was captured alive.</p><p>Kong Xin, eyes gleaming, lunged forward like a ravenous wolf.  As Bao watched in terror, Kong Xin bit into his neck.  A strange gurgling sound emanated from Bao's throat as warm blood flowed from the corner of Kong Xin's mouth, staining the ground crimson.</p><p>The blood was a shocking, bright red.</p><p>Bao's pupils dilated, then lost their light. His life essence drained by Kong Xin, his body withered into a husk.</p><p>Witnessing Kong Xin's frenzied bloodsucking, the black-robed figure felt a shiver of apprehension and a growing wariness.</p><p>Kong Xin raised his head, his scarlet tongue lapping clean the blood around his mouth. He wore an expression of unfulfilled desire. The ferocity in his eyes faded, and his pale face regained some color.</p><p>Touching his forehead, he retracted his demonic aura, once again appearing harmless.</p><p>The black-robed figure clicked his tongue in admiration. "Fellow Daoist Kong, you hide your true nature well! I've been in the Boundless Valley for many years, and I only knew of your excellent reputation as the most trustworthy guide. Everyone sings your praises. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would never have imagined that you cultivated such a demonic art."</p><p>"Hmph! I usually only require the blood of妖兽. If I hadn't been injured and in dire need of a Foundation Establishment cultivator's essence to heal, would I have joined forces with a fiend like you?" Kong Xin scoffed.</p><p>The black-robed figure retorted sarcastically, "I merely killed a few people. How dare I compare myself to Fellow Daoist Kong, who devours living essence? If anyone had witnessed your blood-drinking just now, they'd hardly consider me the greater demon. Since you are also one of us, why don't we continue our partnership and conduct more business together?"</p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p>Kong Xin shook his head decisively. "This was a special circumstance. I was injured and needed essence, and I also discovered the Coldgold vein. It was killing two birds with one stone. I took the risk of ruining my reputation and chose a few rogue cultivators as scapegoats! With the recent unrest in the Boundless Valley, an accident can be explained away.  But doing this too often will raise suspicions. It won't fool the old foxes in the merchant guilds. This is a one-time thing, never again!"</p><p>The black-robed figure said dismissively, "With your abilities, why bother currying favor with those old geezers? So what if you're exposed? You could join me in the depths of the Boundless Valley and become a true demon. Wouldn't that be more enjoyable?"</p><p>"You know nothing!"</p><p>Kong Xin looked at him with disdain. He kicked the dried corpse, retrieved the storage pouch, and tossed it to the black-robed figure without a second glance.</p><p>Then, he conjured a spiritual fire, incinerating all traces of their deed.</p><p>"According to our agreement, the next pouch is mine," Kong Xin said, glancing around. "Let's go! We must destroy the Tigerwing Eagles' nest and lure them away before the two Daoists arrive. The woman is alone; she can wait. Those two Daoists are not to be trifled with. If we miss our opportunity, it will be difficult to take them down without a fight."</p><p>The black-robed figure clutched the storage pouch, a calculating look in his eyes.  "I'm suddenly having second thoughts about our agreement."</p><p>Kong Xin's face darkened. "What do you mean?"</p><p>"If you're telling the truth, that Qingfeng Daoist's flying sword is extraordinary. It's probably worth more than two or three top-grade artifacts.</p><p>"I was willing to accept a small loss, assuming everyone's possessions were of similar value.</p><p>"Who would have thought a mere rogue cultivator would possess such a treasure?</p><p>"I risked my life venturing into the caverns to lure the Ghost Leader. Even if it didn't prove necessary, I still put in the effort.</p><p>"You're taking the best prize. What if the remaining items are nowhere near as valuable as that sword?  I'd be losing out if we split everything equally."</p><p>The black-robed figure laid out his reasoning, concluding, "You still get seventy percent of the Coldgold. But we split the rest equally.  Otherwise, I might 'accidentally' fail to leave any survivors for you to drain."</p><p>Kong Xin glared, but the black-robed figure remained unmoved.</p><p>"Fine!"</p><p>Kong Xin gritted his teeth. "As you say!"</p><p>The black-robed figure laughed, opened Bao's storage pouch, and emptied its contents onto the ground. "Take your pick, Fellow Daoist!"</p><p>Kong Xin snorted, casually glanced at the items, took the Coldgold, and flew off without another word.</p><p>Unfazed by Kong Xin's attitude, the black-robed figure gathered the remaining items and followed closely behind.</p><p>…</p><p>The parched earth, barren and lifeless, stretched across the desolate landscape.</p><p>Towering stone peaks rose from the wasteland, and the depths of the wilderness echoed with a series of roars, like those of tigers, carrying an aura of dominance.</p><p>Deep within the mountains, dozens of enormous birds circled a peak.  Their wingspans reached several dozen feet, and the patterns on their feathers resembled tiger stripes.</p><p>The roars, not bird calls, came from them:  the monstrous Tigerwing Eagles!</p><p>The black-robed figure and Kong Xin arrived stealthily, their eyes fixed on the eagles' nest and the shadowy mountain behind it, where the Yellow Dragon Grass grew.</p><p>"Good, they took the long way. The Daoists aren't here yet. Let's find a place to hide..."</p><p>Kong Xin scanned the area.  Seeing no sign of activity near the nest or on the mountain, he relaxed slightly.</p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, a voice sounded behind them.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Kong, were you looking for us?"</p><p>…</p><p>The only ones who could be lying in wait here at this time were Qin Sang and Yun Youzi.</p><p>The Boundless Valley was a labyrinth, and they didn't know how many were tracking them. They might attract the attention of powerful demonic sects, and they didn't want to get involved in unnecessary conflicts. But they were also worried about being targeted.</p><p>After parting ways with Kong Xin, they decided to lie in ambush near the Tigerwing Eagles' nest.</p><p>First, the path ahead was fraught with peril, with few opportunities to rest. They needed to be at their peak condition.</p><p>Second, they wanted to observe the situation.</p><p>If they weren't the target, they preferred to avoid conflict.</p><p>But if they were, they would eliminate the threat, regardless of who or how powerful they were.</p><p>While the Yellow Dragon Grass wasn't their true objective, this location was close to the second level, and their pursuers might deduce their intentions.</p><p>An ambush while they were passing through the ancient restrictions would be disastrous.</p><p>Therefore, after losing Kong Xin, Yun Youzi took out his Spirit Bamboo flying boat. They traveled at a speed far exceeding Kong Xin's expectations, arriving near the Tigerwing Eagles' nest well in advance.</p>
