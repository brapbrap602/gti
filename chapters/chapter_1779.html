<h1>Chapter 1770: Azure鸞 Dharma Form</h1><p>The valley fell silent.</p><p>Starlight no longer converged on a single point, scattering instead and flowing within Star Valley, though noticeably thinner than before.</p><p>A long time passed like this.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in meditation, showing no outward movement.</p><p>His vital energy receded, yet his body remained in turmoil, seemingly unable to control the newfound power surging within.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was focused inward, meticulously examining the transformations brought about by his physical breakthrough.</p><p>It was an unprecedented sensation. Even before the breakthrough, he could clearly perceive every pulse of his flesh, blood, and even marrow. Now, these pulses had harmonized into a singular, unique rhythm, merging into a potent vital essence.</p><p>This vital essence was incredibly robust, brimming with boundless life force. It flowed throughout his body, seamlessly integrated, forging a solid foundation.</p><p>With this foundation, he was impervious to evil techniques, a cornerstone upon which his existence in this world could stand.</p><p>He stood firm in this realm. Even if a cultivator of the same level invoked the might of heaven and earth, they would be unable to shake him.</p><p>Let the winds blow from all directions, he remained unyielding!</p><p>Simultaneously, the acupoints on his body were 'breathing.'  Within each acupoint, it was as if a celestial rainbow bridge had been erected, connecting the rhythm of his vital essence to the external world. This allowed him to directly absorb and replenish his vital essence with the surrounding spiritual energy.</p><p>As long as this vital essence remained, his body could rapidly regenerate from even grievous injuries, barring damage to certain vital points.</p><p>It could be said that Qin Sang's physical body had attained a partial form of immortality.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, sharp beams of light flashing within. His five senses had become even more acute.</p><p>Through three metamorphoses of his Nascent Soul, cultivation base, and physical body, his spiritual awareness had been honed to an extraordinary degree, rarely matched among his peers.</p><p>He raised his right arm, gazing down at his hand with contemplation. He mused that if he were to shatter this hand now, even reducing it to dust, he could effortlessly regenerate it.</p><p>Though certain of this, Qin Sang wouldn't engage in such pointless self-harm. He continued to introspect, gleaning further insights.</p><p>He then looked at his right hand, clenched into a fist.</p><p>Outwardly, the fist appeared unremarkable. Only Qin Sang knew that he was meticulously channeling his vital essence, converging it at the tip of his fist. If an enemy stood before him at this moment, a single punch could unleash all his power at that focal point, erupting with terrifying force!</p><p>If he willed it, he could adapt this technique to his fists, feet, elbows, shoulders, or any other part of his body. This was merely a rudimentary application he had just conceived.  With deeper understanding, its potential was limitless.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang collected his thoughts, shifting his focus from his body to the Dharma Form above him.</p><p>The Azure 鸞 Dharma Form!</p><p>The Dharma Form still appeared somewhat ethereal, yet noticeably more substantial than before his breakthrough.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form with a thoughtful expression.</p><p>If before the breakthrough, the Dharma Form was merely a shadow, now it was transforming into something real.</p><p>What changes this transformation would bring, Qin Sang didn't yet know. However, he acutely perceived another change connected to the Dharma Form.</p><p>His Phoenix Wings!</p><p>Years ago, when Qin Sang absorbed the remnant soul of the Azure 鸞 from the stone tablet, not possessing a demonic body, the Azure 鸞’s inherent thunder power had remained dormant within his Phoenix Wings.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense this formidable power. In terms of its inherent nature, the Azure 鸞's thunder power was arguably no less potent than his Southern Brightflame or Heavenly Phoenix Truefire.</p><p>He had tried various methods to access it, but the Azure 鸞’s thunder power remained immovable, like an insurmountable mountain.</p><p>He recalled Zhu Que's assessment – the Azure 鸞’s thunder power had subtly merged with his own energy, becoming part of his power, though he had yet to find a way to wield it.</p><p>With the transformation of his Dharma Form, a path finally emerged. The key to controlling the Azure 鸞’s thunder power lay within the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form!</p><p>His mind delved into his Phoenix Wings. As usual, he could clearly sense the violent aura emanating from the Azure 鸞’s thunder power. But now, Qin Sang felt a subtle connection to that power, a kinship established through the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form.</p><p>He deduced that as the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form solidified, he would eventually gain control over this power.</p><p>However…</p><p>Qin Sang frowned slightly. He was not a descendant of the Azure 鸞, after all.  He likely could only utilize the most basic and direct methods, which felt like a waste of its potential.</p><p>Perhaps he could find a way to integrate it into his Phoenix Wings, further enhancing his escape technique?</p><p>He had long understood the immense benefits of a top-tier escape technique.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang shook his head. It was too early to contemplate these matters. It would be more productive to consider how to solidify his Dharma Form.</p><p>With this thought, Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly as he recalled the bone flute.</p><p>However, he didn't immediately retrieve the treasure. Bei Gong Nandou’s talisman creation had caused too much commotion, making this location unsuitable for a prolonged stay.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up. Without any visible movement, he left behind a lingering afterimage that slowly dissipated.</p><p>Standing atop the mountain, he deactivated the spirit array and surveyed his surroundings, heading towards another cave dwelling as planned.</p><p>At a desolate mountain…</p><p>Qin Sang entered the cave and eagerly retrieved the bone flute from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>With a brief inspection, his expression changed subtly. The bone flute had indeed transformed.</p><p>The *Demonic Refinement Scripture* only revealed its first four layers; the subsequent layers were obscured by mist.</p><p>The situation remained the same now, but the bone flute conveyed a certain guidance. Qin Sang summoned his Azure 鸞 Dharma Form and, following its instruction, gently tossed the flute upwards.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The bone flute merged into the Dharma Form, hovering within as it emitted a brilliant light that illuminated the entire cave.</p><p>Qin Sang divided his attention, observing the bone flute while sensing his Dharma Form.</p><p>The Azure 鸞 Dharma Form seemed unchanged, except for a wisp of energy absorbed by the bone flute.</p><p>The flute quickly dimmed, falling from above.</p><p>*Clack!*</p><p>Qin Sang caught it, his mind probing within once more. He saw that the mist obscuring the scripture had thinned, revealing the fifth layer of the *Demonic Refinement Scripture*!</p><p>Skimming through the contents, Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>Although the later layers remained hidden, this layer alone was sufficient for him to cultivate to a level equivalent to the peak of Nascent Soul.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang realized something was amiss. He focused his entire mind on the bone flute, meticulously examining the scripture.</p><p>Gradually, a strange expression flickered across his face.</p><p>The fifth layer of the *Demonic Refinement Scripture*, like the previous four, was divided into early, middle, and late stages, allowing for further refinement and strengthening of bloodline abilities.</p><p>Naturally, Qin Sang couldn't cultivate these aspects, limited to the physical cultivation techniques.</p><p>However, upon reaching the fifth layer, the *Demonic Refinement Scripture* introduced a new function – solidifying the Dharma Form!</p><p>Specifically, solidifying the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form!</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood why he hadn't been able to access the fifth layer before.</p><p>Only after his breakthrough, when the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form began its transformation into a tangible form, could the bone flute absorb its essence, determine his chosen path, and reveal the corresponding cultivation techniques.</p><p>This realization startled Qin Sang. Could the bone flute adapt its contents to the bloodline of the cultivator?</p><p>There were countless demon races in the world, each with unique bloodlines. Could the bone flute encompass them all?</p><p>What kind of treasure was this?!</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the bone flute in his hand. He had underestimated it. It wasn't simply a vessel for recording cultivation techniques.</p><p>After examining it for a while longer, Qin Sang couldn't discern anything further, so he stored it away.</p><p>The scripture was now imprinted in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully studied it, gaining some initial understanding before attempting cultivation.</p><p>Pure starlight enveloped him.</p><p>Obscure, ethereal Star Sha and Star Essence seeped into his body.</p><p>With his increased cultivation, the influx of Star Essence intensified, bringing with it greater danger.  For Qin Sang, however, it made no difference.</p><p>The Star Sha couldn't penetrate his Nascent Soul, repelled by the Buddhist light surrounding it.</p><p>After ten days, Qin Sang roused himself.</p><p>Thanks to the exceptionally beneficial environment, despite the short duration of his cultivation, his progress was remarkable.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's expression didn't reveal much joy.</p><p>He was primarily focused on the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form, finding its solidification to be exceptionally slow, with minimal change over this period.</p><p>It was clear that solidifying the Dharma Form would be a long-term endeavor.  Controlling the Azure 鸞's inherent thunder power would have to wait.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected his cultivation base also played a role. When he reached the middle and later stages of the *Demonic Refinement Scripture*'s fifth layer, the rate of solidification should increase.</p><p>Besides this, solidifying the Dharma Form offered other benefits, but most related to bloodline abilities.  Not being a descendant of the Azure 鸞, Qin Sang could only hope the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form would continue to enhance his thunder escape technique.</p><p>As for the inherent abilities of the Azure 鸞 Dharma Form itself, he would need to explore them gradually.</p><p>Familiarizing himself with the scripture and consolidating his cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang devoted the next six months to these two tasks.</p><p>Half a year later, Qin Sang ceased his cultivation, deciding to return to Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Although this world was beneficial for physical cultivators, he couldn't achieve another breakthrough in the short term.</p><p>It was time to seriously consider his tribulation and the matter of the oath.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the aura of the Heavenly Tribulation once more. The feeling of trepidation had significantly diminished.</p><p>He pondered inwardly. The *Postnatal Wooden Man Stele* and the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal* were both superior physical cultivation techniques. Relying on these two, he should be able to overcome this tribulation.</p><p>If he could refine an Imperial Bell Talisman, his success would be assured.</p><p>He had considered the Imperial Bell Talisman before, intending to rely on it during the tribulation if his breakthrough failed.</p><p>He had made some preparations, but with his focus divided, he hadn't yet managed to refine one.</p><p>The Imperial Bell Talisman required special talisman paper and cinnabar, both precious treasures.</p><p>Furthermore, he wasn't a master of talisman crafting; he lacked the time to learn from scratch and would need to enlist the help of a talisman master.</p><p>"For now, I should focus on comprehending these two techniques…" Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>After his breakthrough, his perspective had broadened.  Looking at these two techniques anew, as expected, he gained new insights.</p><p>Many previous uncertainties were now clear. After a period of secluded cultivation, he was certain his mastery of both techniques would greatly improve.</p><p>"I'll return to Crane Cry Mountain and make arrangements.  I'll work on both matters concurrently. Refining an Imperial Bell Talisman would be ideal."</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind and prepared to return.</p><p>However, before that, there was one more thing to do.</p><p>Qin Sang flew north, following the path he took to the Ghost Fang Kingdom, reaching the vicinity of the demon kingdoms.  He opened his spirit beast pouch and released the狈 demon.</p><p>"Although these demon kingdoms are vassals of the Ghost Fang Kingdom, their rules are less strict, with many loopholes. With your abilities, it shouldn't be difficult to rise within them," Qin Sang said.</p><p>The 狈 demon prostrated itself. "Thank you, Immortal, for your mercy. I will never forget your kindness in sparing my life."</p><p>It hadn't expected Qin Sang to truly release it, having prepared for continued servitude.</p><p>"If you have any commands, Immortal, I will do my utmost to fulfill them," the 狈 demon offered.</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. "What could someone of your meager strength do for me? Wait until you regain your Demon Marquis cultivation and then we'll talk."</p><p>"Yes, Immortal!"</p><p>The 狈 demon performed a deep bow before summoning a demonic wind, quickly disappearing from sight.</p><p>He wondered about the snake demon, its current situation, and whether it had infiltrated the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>Having sent these two demons into the demon kingdoms, Qin Sang didn't expect much from them. Their cultivation was too low to significantly impact the Ghost Fang Kingdom.</p><p>It would be ideal if he could control a Demon Marquis.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind as he turned back towards Crane Cry Mountain.</p><p>Upon returning to the Immortal City, Qin Sang summoned Shi Xuan and the others, instructing them to gather information on the whereabouts of the materials needed for the Imperial Bell Talisman.</p><p>He then proceeded alone to the courtyard to visit Real Master Gu Zhou.</p><p>Nearly twenty years had passed, but the courtyard remained unchanged, appearing as a private residence from the outside, with no signboard.</p><p>Upon meeting Real Master Gu Zhou again, he found the man's cultivation still at the middle stage of Nascent Soul.</p><p>"I've come to ask you to deliver a message to Fellow Daoist Zhi Jian. If all goes well, I plan to visit in four years." Qin Sang produced a personally written letter.</p><p>Real Master Gu Zhou subtly observed Qin Sang, understanding the situation.  As a cultivator approached their tribulation, the aura of the impending Heavenly Tribulation became increasingly difficult to conceal.</p><p>Judging by Qin Sang's appearance, his tribulation was likely within the next few years.  It was best to avoid travel before then, to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>"Rest assured, Real Master, I will deliver your letter!" Real Master Gu Zhou solemnly assured him.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, then revealed his true purpose. "I wish to refine a certain treasure, but I'm having difficulty procuring the necessary materials.  I wonder if you have any channels?"</p><p>He had previously considered that if his breakthrough failed and he couldn't refine the talisman himself, he would call upon Zhi Jian to refine it for him as a favor.</p><p>Since he had successfully broken through, the talisman wasn't urgently needed, and he could gather the materials gradually.</p><p>Real Master Gu Zhou didn't hesitate. After inquiring about Qin Sang's requirements, he promised to gather information.</p><p>Bidding farewell to Real Master Gu Zhou, Qin Sang stepped out of the courtyard, glancing back with narrowed eyes.</p><p>He hadn't deliberately inquired about their background, but judging from various clues, the power behind them was not insignificant.</p><p>Becoming involved with such a force, he couldn't tell whether it was fortunate or unfortunate.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>In the following period, Qin Sang remained within his cave dwelling, devoting himself to comprehending the two techniques. His efforts yielded significant gains, and his strength grew considerably.</p><p>Notably, while studying the seventh seal of the *Seven Masters Buddha Seal*, the Vajra Great Freedom Seal, Qin Sang discovered its profundity surpassed his expectations, with new insights emerging every time he contemplated it.</p><p>As for the *Postnatal Wooden Man Stele*, Qin Sang continued cultivating diligently, awaiting its completion.</p><p>During his seclusion, Shi Xuan and Gu Zhou periodically delivered news and some of the required materials.</p><p>However, they were still far from gathering everything, with no concrete leads on the crucial Kun Earth Blood Sand.</p><p>With this in mind, Qin Sang put the matter aside.</p><p>One day…</p><p>Without alerting anyone, Qin Sang left the Immortal City and arrived at his chosen tribulation site. He gazed up at the heavens.</p><p>The aura of the tribulation lightning was converging upon this area.</p><p>Qin Sang had gathered information on cultivators undergoing tribulations in this world. The descriptions were similar to those in the Storm Realm.</p><p>He wondered what changes his arrival from another realm would bring about.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
