<h1>Chapter 746: Grand Yin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light</h1><p>The bone flute bloomed with light, crystalline as ice.</p><p>The light pulsed, pointing in a direction.</p><p>Previously, near Hutian Island, when he encountered the second bone flute segment, this hadn't happened. This sudden anomaly must have a reason.</p><p>If there really was another bone flute segment nearby, the implication was clear!</p><p>“Could I really gather all the bone flute fragments? And obtain the complete ancient treasure?”</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement.</p><p>After learning that the two bone flute fragments were in different locations, Qin Sang had given up hope. He never expected to find a third one in the Canglang Sea!</p><p>“Someone carrying a bone flute fragment is near me. I don't know if the flute on their person is reacting, but judging by the last time, it's unlikely.”</p><p>Qin Sang widened his eyes, peering through the blood-red light. His vision was filled with emptiness. Aside from the figures of his companions, he couldn't see anything else.</p><p>He tried to struggle and move to the left, unsure of the range of the bone flute's感应, hoping to get closer to the cultivator holding the flute.</p><p>But then a tremendous impact struck, halting Qin Sang and the others. Qin Sang watched helplessly as the light on the bone flute began to dim, disappearing moments later.</p><p>……</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>On a boundless wasteland, several red figures plummeted from the sky. Only after they landed did the red light slowly dissipate.</p><p>Qin Sang landed, stumbling slightly before quickly regaining his balance. He looked around. Xiang Yi and the others had also landed nearby. All eight of them were present, not one missing.</p><p>“So this is the Seven Kills Palace.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up. The sky was a dull gray.</p><p>The immortal formation seemed non-existent, allowing them to easily see the hurricane raging outside.</p><p>He tapped his foot and floated up again, gazing into the distance. He discovered that this place, like the inner palace of the Purple Star Palace, was an incredibly vast space, stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Distant sky trees were interspersed with multicolored clouds and mist, many bearing the signs of secret realms.</p><p>Within his field of vision, there were ancient jungles and towering trees, strange sounds echoing from within, quite unsettling. Clearly, the Seven Kills Palace was very different from the Purple Star Palace. There were living things here.</p><p>There were also towering mountains, like crouching dragons, with ancient restrictions drifting around them and immortal halls nestled within.</p><p>It was a scene of boundless desolation!</p><p>It seemed that the Seven Kills Palace didn't have a central location as obvious as Heavenly Mountain in the Purple Star Palace, but the dangers here were certainly no less.</p><p>“The Heavenly Tower…”</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept across the landscape, settling on the area behind the mountains.</p><p>There, the peaks soared high, and a sea of clouds stretched endlessly.</p><p>The Heavenly Tower was in that direction, rumored to be even taller than the highest peak in the Seven Kills Palace, but it was obscured by the clouds, invisible from here.</p><p>At this moment, streaks of light were appearing all across the wasteland, heading in various directions.</p><p>To Qin Sang's disappointment, the bone flute remained silent even here.</p><p>This meant that the cultivator with the bone flute fragment might have entered before them and already left the wasteland.</p><p>The bone flute's sensing range wasn't large. Whether he could encounter that person again was uncertain. If that person perished in the Seven Kills Palace or vanished after leaving, he would likely never complete the bone flute.</p><p>This treasure remained elusive.</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent.</p><p>After completing the Merchant Alliance's mission, his priority would be the ancient teleportation formation. He couldn't go searching for this person everywhere unless the teleportation formation was easy to find.</p><p>His priorities were clear.</p><p>He could only put the bone flute out of his mind for now.</p><p>“Fellow Daoists, is everyone alright?”</p><p>Xiang Yi looked at each of them, his voice filled with concern.</p><p>The young man with the sword and Cui Ji seemed to have encountered some trouble. Their auras were somewhat disordered, and they were sitting cross-legged on the ground, regulating their breathing. The others were in relatively good condition.</p><p>Although they had been firmly protected by the blood-red light from the jade pendant, everyone was still shaken.</p><p>The Liu couple complained, “My husband and I consulted a friend who had been to the Seven Kills Palace before. He told us that the immortal formations they encountered at the periphery were nowhere near as terrifying as this time. The protective blood light around us nearly shattered several times. We thought we were going to perish here.”</p><p>Xiang Yi chuckled lightly, “I wonder when your friend entered. Perhaps it was when the Seven Kills Palace emerged on its own, or during a low tide in the immortal formation. It's certainly different this time.  We're still a long way from the next low tide. Forcing our way through the formation now, this outcome is already quite fortunate. It's said the Wu Clan not only dispatched their Grand Shaman but also paid a hefty price for this.”</p><p>“Perhaps that's why our human race agreed to let the Wu Clan's Nascent Soul cultivators enter the Seven Kills Palace?”</p><p>The stout man, dressed in ornate robes now wrinkled and disheveled from the constant impacts of the immortal formation, didn't have the energy to tidy himself up. Like Qin Sang, he was eagerly surveying the Seven Kills Palace.</p><p>He landed from the sky and asked in confusion, “Did the Wu Clan receive some information? Is there a treasure in the Seven Kills Palace that's crucial to them?  Why would they go to such lengths with their entire clan?”</p><p>“I haven't heard anything,” Xiang Yi replied. “Perhaps only the Wu Clan themselves know. Has anyone seen which direction the Grand Shaman went? We might be able to glean some clues.”</p><p>Everyone shook their heads.</p><p>Not only the Grand Shaman, but other Nascent Soul cultivators had already entered.</p><p>The stout man chuckled self-deprecatingly, “I don’t even know what the Grand Shaman looks like.”</p><p>Just then, Madam Liu’s expression suddenly shifted. She pointed to the edge of the wasteland and cried out, “What’s that?”</p><p>Everyone focused their gaze and saw a strange light that had appeared there at some point, moving with astonishing speed. It swiftly flew out of the wasteland and vanished into the depths of the mountains.</p><p>What was alarming was that when they saw this strange light, it seemed to contain countless ferocious and malevolent ghosts that, sensing their gazes, stared back with blood-red eyes.</p><p>Instantly, everyone except Qin Sang felt their minds tremble, experiencing a sense of dizziness.</p><p>Startled, they quickly averted their gaze, only then breaking free from the influence.</p><p>From such a distance, a single glance had nearly overwhelmed their minds. Moreover, the ghostly figures each person saw seemed to be different.</p><p>Everyone was astonished.</p><p>“The Grand Yin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light!”</p><p>Xiang Yi's face darkened as he identified the strange light.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The stout man exclaimed, “That’s the renowned Grand Yin Heavenly Ghost Divine Light, the Demon Lord's ultimate divine ability, the most powerful divine light in the Canglang Sea?  It’s said that only the Demon Lord’s disciples on Jizhen Island can cultivate this divine ability.”</p><p>“That was no mere disciple! A fleeting glimpse nearly shattered our minds. Only the Demon Lord himself could possess such power!”</p><p>Xiang Yi's face was grim. “The Demon Lord, like the Grand Shaman, is a late-Nascent Soul cultivator. As one of the few Grand Cultivators of the human race, it's said he only appeared when the Seven Kills Palace emerged on its own.  This time, he has entered along with the Grand Shaman… Have you two recovered? We should proceed quickly!”</p>
