<h1>Chapter 1526: Ferocious Beast </h1><p>Black mist, like a living entity, churned and advanced within the storm. Unlike the calm shadows surrounding the Moon Boat, this black mist appeared erratic, yet it emanated a ferocious aura, immensely savage, charging recklessly and wrestling with the tempest.</p><p>'Hua!'</p><p>Two colossal waves surged from the seabed, forming a deep trench. Only after the black mist had passed did the seawater, swept up by the hurricane, refill the trench, a spectacular sight.</p><p>Within the black mist, there clearly lurked a monstrous creature of enormous size. The occasional glimpse of a scale or claw emerging from the mist was enough to conjure a terrifying image in one's mind.</p><p>'Hou!'</p><p>The monster roared again. The black mist surged wildly.</p><p>The roar overwhelmed the storm. In the vast, unobstructed sea, it was like the song of a whale, but devoid of any ethereal quality. Instead, it brought a shocking pressure, chilling all who heard it to the bone.</p><p>Within the wall of wind, Qin Sang and Liuli, hearing this sound again, felt their very souls tremble.</p><p>At this moment, they were struggling to traverse the wind wall.</p><p>It was Qin Sang and Liuli's first encounter with such a situation. Hearing the sound, they realized the monster within the storm was approaching them, and they clearly understood that their upcoming predicament would be extremely perilous.</p><p>Within the storm belt, there was nothing to rely on.</p><p>The Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle was as conspicuous as a bright lamp in the dark night. Turning back would only attract the monster's attention, inviting disaster.</p><p>A monster capable of surviving in the storm belt, it went without saying, must possess terrifying power.</p><p>Their only option was to hide in the refuge, using the wind wall and the refuge for cover, hoping the monster was merely passing by.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had explored several times without finding any unusual traces. This place should not be the monster's lair.</p><p>If the monster sensed that its lair had been intruded upon, its roar should have been filled with fury, but what Qin Sang felt from it was madness!</p><p>The second roar confirmed their judgment.</p><p>Although the monster was approaching in this direction, it wasn't directly charging towards them and the refuge. It was more like it was passing by and they had the misfortune of running into it.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli were secretly relieved. Their choice had been correct.</p><p>This roar was far clearer than the first. The monster's speed was incredibly fast, and it seemed unafraid of the storm's impact, advancing in a perfectly straight line.</p><p>At such speed.</p><p>If they hadn't decisively entered the wind wall, but had chosen to flee in panic, they would likely have been targeted by the monster, and the outcome would probably not have been favorable.</p><p>Hearing the roar again.</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang. This madness felt somewhat familiar.</p><p>He couldn't help but recall the Ferocious Beasts he had encountered in the inner hall of the Seven Killings Palace.</p><p>The current situation didn't allow Qin Sang to think carefully.</p><p>He and Liuli had hastily rushed into the wind wall, with no time to choose the opportune moment. The surroundings were utterly chaotic, and Qin Sang had to do everything in his power to find a way to survive.</p><p>Liuli handed control of the Divine Shuttle to Qin Sang.</p><p>The Divine Shuttle was pushed to its limit. Qin Sang dared not pause for even a moment, flashing rapidly between the ever-changing hurricanes, doing his utmost to charge towards the refuge at the center.</p><p>'Sou!'</p><p>Everything around them was a hazy gray.</p><p>The Divine Shuttle was surrounded by hurricanes.</p><p>Just as it passed through a gap, the hurricanes immediately closed in, the aftershocks of their collision almost chasing the tail of the green light. The slightest carelessness would result in being swept in, swallowed by the wind wall.</p><p>The word 'perilous' was insufficient to describe the current danger.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had scouted the path beforehand and was already familiar with the patterns within the wind wall. Though he appeared to be fleeing blindly, he invariably made the most correct choices, advancing towards the core refuge with close calls but without major incidents.</p><p>The third roar arrived.</p><p>It was even closer!</p><p>The monster's speed was even faster than they had anticipated!</p><p>If they couldn't reach the refuge before the monster got close, the Divine Shuttle's fluctuations might also be detected by it.</p><p>Liuli summoned the Four-Coiled Serpent Seal, a faint blue light appearing in her pupils, ready for battle.</p><p>Her External Body Incarnation was also prepared to act.</p><p>If it truly came to a point of no return, they would have to test the monster's strength. The only thing to be thankful for was that they had encountered the monster near the refuge. Encountering it halfway would have been a much bigger problem.</p><p>'Shua!'</p><p>Qin Sang's face was as calm as water, his mind focused. He piloted the Divine Shuttle through layer after layer of wind walls, and the Heavenly Eye Butterfly finally saw the scene at the core of the wind wall.</p><p>It was a small island.</p><p>The island was only about a hundred zhang in circumference, its scenery completely visible at a glance; it could even be called a reef.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it was a scene of deathly stillness, devoid of any life.</p><p>At least it proved that this place was not the monster's lair.</p><p>However, the island was not entirely barren. A patch of forest had survived, but the vegetation had already withered and turned to fossils.</p><p>This fossilized forest had formed an unknown number of years ago. It was located within the storm belt, yet it was completely unharmed, its branches and leaves perfectly preserved.</p><p>Qin Sang had always had a question.</p><p>Were these bizarre refuges discovered by Senior Xiaoxiang Zi and other Nascent Soul stage cultivators during their travels in the storm belt, or were they created by them?</p><p>Now it seemed that, at least, this small island was an ancient ruin.</p><p>'Hou!'</p><p>Just then, the fourth roar came.</p><p>It was deafening, as if it were right next to their ears.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He spotted a gap in the final layer of the wind wall and flashed through.</p><p>However, at the instant he crossed the wind wall, a sudden alarm rose in Qin Sang's heart. His back tensed, sensing an unknown danger rapidly approaching!</p><p>Outside the wind wall.</p><p>The black mist churned, its target clearly not the refuge.</p><p>But as it was about to brush past, a sudden change occurred!</p><p>Perhaps it was angered by the hurricanes near the refuge, which were far denser than elsewhere, or perhaps the unusual phenomenon of the wind wall around the refuge had alerted the monster.</p><p>In the midst of the roar.</p><p>The black mist suddenly expanded.</p><p>Following that, a long tail tore through the black mist, breaking through the sea trench.</p><p>The tail was as fast as black lightning, disappearing in an instant, leaving behind a long afterimage in the void. With a 'shua', it swept away the hurricanes in the nearby void, and the afterimage slammed fiercely against the wind wall.</p><p>'Cila!'</p><p>The afterimage pierced the wind wall, its momentum astonishing, as if it would completely tear the wind wall apart.</p><p>However, this was the confluence of hurricanes, where a vast amount of energy had accumulated, making it not so fragile.</p><p>The two forces collided, and the fragile balance barely maintained within the wind wall was disrupted by the afterimage, but it was not torn apart.</p><p>It was just a hardship for those inside.</p><p>Inside the wind wall.</p><p>Qin Sang reacted extremely quickly. Noticing the anomaly in the wind wall, he spared no effort in charging towards the small island.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was still half a beat too slow.</p><p>Behind them, the shockwave formed by the collision transformed into a gray wave of wind. It didn't appear more violent than before, but it sent chills down Qin Sang's spine.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang made an astonishing move. He suddenly withdrew his true essence, relinquishing control of the Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle and transferring it to Liuli.</p><p>The next moment, two figures were exposed: Qin Sang and his incarnation.</p><p>The wave of wind was close at hand, and it would only take a moment to engulf them.</p><p>The Ten Directions Earth-Splitting Divine Shuttle was their lifeline for traversing the storm belt. It absolutely could not be destroyed here.</p><p>Moreover, unlike the Moon Boat, a restrictive barrier existed around the small island, and they needed to find the entrance first.</p><p>For this reason, Qin Sang did not hesitate to reveal himself, personally blocking the wave of wind.</p><p>At the same time, the External Body Incarnation pushed out its palm, and the Serpent Banner flew out.</p><p>On the banner's surface, the Snow Serpent's expression was ferocious, roaring wildly.</p><p>After Qin Sang had subdued the Snow Serpent, he hadn't had time to cultivate a bond with it. He relied entirely on his strength to force the Snow Serpent into submission.</p><p>At this critical moment, the Snow Serpent naturally wouldn't willingly risk its life for him. But the difference in cultivation realms was too great. The Snow Serpent's struggles were futile, it couldn't break free from control at all, and even its cries couldn't be heard.</p><p>'Huala!'</p><p>The Serpent Banner silently expanded, becoming like a wall, blocking the wave.</p><p>But this wall was too fragile. The cold mist was quickly swept away by the wave, and the Snow Serpent and the Serpent Banner vanished together within the wave, silently. Qin Sang didn't even have time to retrieve it.</p><p>Having tested the power of the wave, Qin Sang's heart sank, but he did not retreat.</p><p>Following closely behind the Serpent Banner was an ice mirror.</p><p>The External Body Incarnation activated a defensive divine ability, constructing a second barrier.</p><p>'Hong!'</p><p>'Kaka...'</p><p>The ice mirror instantly became covered in cracks, then shattered with a sound.</p><p>Before the wave struck.</p><p>The External Body Incarnation raced against time to execute another divine ability. A chilling aura permeated in front of it, condensing into a full body of ice armor. Then, it felt as if it had been struck by a heavy force.</p><p>'Peng!'</p><p>A series of explosions erupted from the External Body Incarnation's body. The ice armor shattered, and it was sent flying on the spot.</p><p>However, this was all part of Qin Sang's plan.</p><p>He grabbed the External Body Incarnation.</p><p>The second Nascent Soul returned to the main body, appearing somewhat scattered.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the incarnation's physical body. A light flashed on his body, revealing the protective barrier of the Wish-Fulfilling Pearl. But from beginning to end, he did not use the Sun God Tree, the Demonic Fire, or the sword array.</p><p>He hadn't seen what had happened outside, but he knew very well that it was definitely caused by that monster.</p><p>All his actions just now were for defense.</p><p>The monster was nearby. If he attacked with all his might, creating too much commotion, it would be more dangerous if he were detected.</p><p>For this reason, Qin Sang didn't hesitate to sacrifice the Serpent Banner and heavily injure his incarnation to buy time.</p><p>At worst, he would have to recuperate in the refuge for a few years. Delaying his arrival in the Central Plains a little wouldn't have a significant impact.</p><p>'Pa!'</p><p>This was the next sound Qin Sang heard.</p><p>At the same time he caught the External Body Incarnation, the wave struck the protective barrier.</p><p>The Wish-Fulfilling Pearl was, after all, an extraordinary treasure of the Buddhist Sect. The barrier lasted a little longer than the ice mirror, but ultimately it could not avoid the fate of shattering.</p><p>Although Qin Sang was under the protection of the barrier, he was still inevitably impacted. Fortunately, he also cultivated body refinement. His body trembled, but he quickly stabilized. At the same time, he flapped his Thunder Wings rapidly, rushing towards the small island without looking back.</p><p>Taking advantage of the time Qin Sang had bought, Liuli followed the directions on the sea chart and successfully found the entrance to the island's restrictive barrier. Then, without hesitation, she turned and unleashed the Ice Soul Divine Light to provide cover for Qin Sang.</p><p>'Kaka...'</p><p>The leading edge of the wave was silently frozen.</p><p>Although the time was short, it was enough for Qin Sang to escape.</p><p>'Sou! Sou!'</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli entered the small island almost side by side.</p><p>The instant they escaped inside, the wave slammed down fiercely. The terrifying energy collided with the restrictive barrier, creating a breathtakingly astonishing scene.</p><p>The small island, however, remained steadfast.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli stepped onto the ground, their faces tense. Seeing this scene, they exchanged a glance, both feeling as if they had narrowly escaped death.</p><p>'Honglonglong!'</p><p>The hurricane roared.</p><p>The afterimage whipped out by the monster was finally swallowed by the wind wall.</p><p>As the aftershocks subsided, a brief gap was created where the wind wall had been impacted. Through the gap, they vaguely saw a mass of black mist sweeping through the storm.</p><p>Within the black mist.</p><p>A long, gigantic tail submerged into the sea trench. It resembled a dragon or a serpent, yet also an alligator's tail, covered in pitch-black scales. Along its spine grew a row of triangular bone plates, like sharp swords.</p><p>The largest bone plate was comparable to a wall.</p><p>It was hard to imagine how large the monster's main body was!</p><p>The next moment, the tail and the black mist swiftly passed, and the wind wall closed.</p><p>It was a fleeting glimpse, but it left a deep impression on Qin Sang and Liuli, leaving them silent for a long time.</p><p>They had anticipated that unknown creatures might exist in the storm belt.</p><p>The world was vast and full of wonders.</p><p>If cultivators could cultivate in places where the Heaven and Earth Yuan Qi was stable, then there must be creatures capable of adapting to the storm belt, roaming freely in this vast expanse.</p><p>The facts had proven them right.</p><p>But they hadn't expected that their very first encounter would be such a humbling experience, one they would never forget.</p><p>The wind wall closed.</p><p>The Heavenly Eye Butterfly could no longer see the black mist and the monster outside.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, continued to stare in that direction, motionless.</p><p>"A Ferocious Beast?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, recalling his experiences in the Seven Killings Palace.</p><p>Back then, after entering the inner hall, he had relied primarily on Senior Qingzhu's incarnation, Ning Wuhui.</p><p>He hadn't had the opportunity to enter the deepest part of the Seven Killings Palace. The Ferocious Beasts he had encountered had a far less oppressive aura than this mysterious monster that had yet to reveal itself, but the madness they exhibited was something Qin Sang remembered vividly.</p><p>This monster was somewhat similar.</p><p>Unfortunately, they didn't dare approach the monster, so they couldn't observe it closely.</p><p>What was the origin of this monster?</p><p>What did its full appearance look like?</p><p>They had entered the storm belt ten years ago, and this was the first time they had encountered it. How many similar monsters were there in the storm belt?</p><p>In the storm belt, cultivation worlds were even more conspicuous than refuges. Didn't these monsters attack cultivation worlds? Why hadn't they seen any records of this?</p><p>One question after another popped up in Qin Sang's mind.</p><p>These unsolved mysteries were thought-provoking.</p><p>The wind wall gradually returned to calm. It was believed that it would soon establish a new balance. The monster had not attacked again, and it was likely that it had already departed far away.</p><p>The attack just now seemed to be a casual blow, triggered by the monster's whim.</p><p>Seeing that they were safe, Qin Sang slowly exhaled, sat down cross-legged, summoned his second Nascent Soul, observed it for a while, and said with a wry smile, "We might have to stay here for a few years."</p><p>Liuli glanced at Qin Sang's severely injured second Nascent Soul, remained silent for a moment, and asked doubtfully, "Could its lair be nearby?"</p><p>"That's my biggest concern. If this monster is constantly roaming nearby, neither path is safe. I intend to take advantage of the healing time to investigate thoroughly," Qin Sang said thoughtfully.</p><p>As he spoke, he took out the sea chart. If such a powerful monster was nearby, Xiaoxiang Zi couldn't possibly have failed to mark it.</p><p>Either the monster had migrated here later, or it was just passing by.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze followed the refuges on the sea chart one by one. The previous ten years had been slow but very smooth, making them a little too optimistic.</p><p>They didn't know how many more storms they would have to weather on the remaining journey.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang and Liuli hid on the island to heal and cultivate, without taking a single step outside.</p><p>For a year, the monster did not return.</p><p>A year later, Qin Sang tentatively left the small island and patrolled the vicinity. He did not find the monster's lair, but he was not in a hurry to set off, and still returned to the island to lie low.</p><p>Thus, they stayed on the island for a full five years.</p><p>The External Body Incarnation's injuries had fully recovered, and they had thoroughly investigated the area around the refuge.</p><p>The monster was indeed not nearby.</p><p>On this day, the Divine Shuttle flew out of the small island, embarking on the next leg of their journey.</p>
