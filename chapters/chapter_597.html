<h1>Chapter 590: The Bone Flute</h1><p>Chapter 590: The Bone Flute</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa is undergoing a transformation and cannot act for now, leaving Qin Sang to handle things alone.</p><p>However, breaking the seal isn't like combat; it won't consume much energy. His Corpse Pill can easily sustain him, so Qin Sang readily agrees.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang notices a hesitant look on Yun Youzi's face.</p><p>Confused, he hears Yun Youzi ask, "Brother Qin, have you heard anything about the Three Lights Jade Liquid from Yi Tiannie?"</p><p>Yun Youzi has helped him so much; there's no need to hide anything.</p><p>Besides, it's difficult for him to obtain the Three Lights Jade Liquid alone; he needs Yun Youzi's assistance.</p><p>The tasks assigned by Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan weigh heavily on him, preventing him from acting freely.</p><p>The jade bracelet can only suppress the mark for a limited time.</p><p>Their journey through the Ancient Medicine Garden was swift, taking little time.  Without the two unexpected battles, they would have had plenty of time.</p><p>Now, however, every second counts. He still needs to visit the place where Elder Qingzhu disappeared to search for the remaining cultivation techniques.</p><p>The follow-up techniques to the "Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuanshen" and the Nine Illusory Sky Orchid – one is the foundation of his immortal path, the other his future hope for Nascent Soul stage; Qin Sang cannot decide which is more important.</p><p>He wants both, but time is not on his side. The location of the Three Lights Jade Liquid is not easily accessible; even with Yi Tiannie's memories, it will take considerable effort.</p><p>He cannot accomplish this alone within the timeframe; he needs Yun Youzi's help.</p><p>Realizing this, Qin Sang wastes no time, saying to Yun Youzi, "Senior, I have indeed learned that an ancient ruin may contain the Three Lights Jade Liquid. Time is of the essence; let's talk as we go."</p><p>He puts the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit into a jade box and puts it away. Refining the spiritual fruit takes time, and forming the Golden Core requires thorough preparation; he has no time for such things now.</p><p>Yun Youzi understands the urgency and readily agrees, setting off with Qin Sang.</p><p>Just as they are about to leave, Qin Sang remembers something, taking out the jade Yi Tiannie left behind and examining it in his palm.</p><p>The crescent-shaped jade is not clear and pure, but somewhat cloudy, milky white in color.</p><p>Holding it, he feels a warm sensation flowing into his body.</p><p>It's a warming jade.</p><p>This warmth is unique; upon entering his body, it extends to his Yuanshen space, warming his Yuanshen and nourishing it.</p><p>"This should be a Soul-Warming Jade,"</p><p>Yun Youzi identifies the jade.</p><p>"If a soul leaves the body, and is too weak or unable to return for a long time, its intelligence will gradually dissipate, eventually lost completely, becoming a wandering ghost, forever lost.</p><p>"Yi Tiannie, though he cultivated the ghost path, was secretly murdered, leaving only a remnant soul, also suffering this worry.</p><p>"This warming jade nourishes the soul and maintains the vitality of the body. Yi Tiannie hid within this jade, maintaining his remnant soul.</p><p>"It's somewhat similar in effect to the Soul-Nourishing Wood, one of the Ten Divine Trees.</p><p>"However, the Soul-Nourishing Wood is far stronger than this jade; it not only houses remnant souls but also nourishes cultivators' Yuanshen and strengthens their spiritual sense, a rare treasure indeed.</p><p>"If I were lucky enough to obtain a piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood, I wouldn't have to go through all this trouble.</p><p>"While not as good as Soul-Nourishing Wood, this is still a treasure. Keep it well, Brother Qin.  It might fetch a good price if you encounter someone who needs it."</p><p>It seems similar to the crystal coffin given to the Tan brothers, but far more powerful.</p><p>Qin Sang hums in agreement, putting away the jade, but thinking about the Soul-Nourishing Wood.</p><p>Smelting a piece of Seamless Blood Mulberry brought incredible benefits, enough to last Qin Sang a lifetime. Other divine trees must possess equally potent effects.</p><p>The Soul-Nourishing Wood, Yun Youzi mentioned, is one such tree.</p><p>It is said that even mortal souls, housed within the Soul-Nourishing Wood, can maintain their essence and consciousness, quite amazing.</p><p>The ebony sword already resides within his Yuanshen. If he could refine a piece of Soul-Nourishing Wood and integrate it into the sword, he could constantly nourish and strengthen his Yuanshen.</p><p>Over time, his spiritual sense would far surpass other cultivators of the same realm.</p><p>Qin Sang has long coveted the Ten Divine Trees, but only dreams of obtaining one.</p><p>The Ten Divine Trees are incredibly rare; the Soul-Nourishing Wood exists only in legends, with no record of its appearance in the cultivation world.</p><p>Putting away the crescent-shaped warming jade, Qin Sang sends out a strand of spiritual energy, supporting the weakened Yun Youzi as they move towards the stone hall's exit.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>As Qin Sang flew out of the stone hall, he caught a glint of gold in the crevices of the lake shore. He paused, his gaze drawn to it.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>With a gesture, Qin Sang drew a curved gold bar from the rocks. He was puzzled; it hadn't been there on his way in.</p><p>Seeing the whole bar, Qin Sang remembered the gold collar around the neck of the panther he'd fought earlier.  He'd been wary of it, assuming it to be some magical artifact, but had dismissed it when he realized it wasn't.</p><p>The explosion of the Sky Shattering Thunder had struck the panther's upper body, blasting off its front left leg and exposing its bones; the collar, it seemed, hadn't survived.</p><p>The Shadow Panther, having barely escaped with its life and terrified, had fled without retrieving the remains of its collar.</p><p>A mid-stage Core Transformation Shadow Panther carrying this… could it be a treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the gold bar. As he examined it, something white and bone-like fell out. The bar was hollow; the metal itself was unremarkable, strong but ordinary, serving only to conceal the bone fragment.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it carefully.</p><p>The bone fragment was small, about the size of a human finger bone. Though white, it wasn't a stark white; it had a smooth, oily sheen, almost like jade.  It hardly looked like bone at all.</p><p>Unlike a human finger bone, which is wider at the ends, this fragment was uniformly sized and hollow in the middle.  Except for the lack of small holes, it strongly resembled a bone flute.</p><p>Qin Sang studied it from all angles, but couldn't discern its purpose.  He wondered why the Shadow Panther had worn it around its neck instead of storing it in a storage pouch.  He couldn't believe a mid-stage Core Transformation demon beast wouldn't possess such an item.</p><p>At that moment, Yun Youzi, nearby, murmured, "Brother Qin, let me have a look at that."</p><p>Qin Sang handed it over.</p><p>Yun Youzi examined it for a moment, then asked, "Brother Qin, do you sense a power emanating from this bone flute?  Does it remind you of anything?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  "Senior, do you mean a Star Origin Stone?" He'd felt a connection, but hadn't been sure.</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded. "This bone flute seems subtly linked to the cosmos. It might be an artifact capable of communicating with the celestial bodies. Whether it's a magical artifact or holds some other secret, however, remains unknown."</p>
