<h1></h1><p>'Snap!'</p><p>The sound rang out, and the sword talisman shattered, its core breaking apart.</p><p>The talisman's light, however, condensed without dispersing.</p><p>Looking closely, one could see a verdant talisman within the green light, as if imprinted upon the void. It resembled a single green eye, gazing at Qinsang.</p><p>"Eight Views Pavilion?"</p><p>Qinsang's mind swiftly recalled the contents of Xiaoxiang Zi's jade slip.</p><p>Xiaoxiang Zi's missive was written freely, not intentionally documenting the powers of the Central Province. He only mentioned them when they were connected to anecdotes.</p><p>The jade slip made no mention of the Eight Views Pavilion.</p><p>The green talisman locked onto Qinsang, making no attempt to conceal its threat.</p><p>Judging by this posture, if Qinsang dared to cross the line, he would surely suffer calamity.</p><p>"Clearing the field, huh..."</p><p>Qinsang chuckled inwardly, yet a deep sense of confusion arose.</p><p>Since the other party had found him, they must have sensed the ferocious beast's strength. Seeing the beast and still daring to appear nearby, issuing a warning with a sword talisman, their cultivation was certainly not weak.</p><p>The Eight Views Pavilion was likely quite famous in the Central Province.</p><p>Could it be that the other party intentionally lured the beast away to save someone?</p><p>If they were saving someone, why use a sword talisman to warn him?</p><p>Was it because he inadvertently led the ferocious beast to collide with the other party's cave dwelling, forcing them to act, hence the unfriendly attitude, or...</p><p>"Could it be..."</p><p>A possibility suddenly occurred to Qinsang, and he found it rather incredible.</p><p>At this moment, the ferocious beast's roar suddenly became even more shrill.</p><p>Following this, Qinsang saw blood-light surging to the heavens from deep within the storm.</p><p>Having failed to hunt its first prey, the ferocious beast was clearly impatient. It pursued the long-bearded Daoist. Seeing the man flee swiftly, its fierce eyes glared, the piercing blood-light almost connecting between its four eyes, as if splitting into a giant maw of blood.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>A pillar of blood-colored light pierced through the void.</p><p>This was precisely the scene Qinsang had witnessed earlier.</p><p>Only this time, the target had become the long-bearded Daoist, and Qinsang had become a spectator.</p><p>To avoid the ferocious beast, Qinsang had continuously fled, and combined with resisting the beast's attacks, his Essence had been greatly depleted. However, he was unwilling to leave just like that.</p><p>He glanced at the green talisman, hesitated slightly, but refrained from acting rashly. He remained in place, ordering the Heavenly Eye Butterfly to fully activate its Heavenly Eye Divine Ability to observe the distant battlefield.</p><p>At this moment, the figure of the long-bearded Daoist had disappeared, replaced by a white crane, its wings snowy white.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the crane was the long-bearded Daoist's transformation.</p><p>The crane spread its bright wings, gently flapping them, and instantly appeared at the edge of the void. With a few flickers, it escaped into the depths of the storm belt, using a highly profound evasion technique.</p><p>Although not as fast as Qinsang's thunder evasion, it was not far behind.</p><p>However, even Qinsang had failed to avoid the ferocious beast's attack, so the crane naturally could not escape.</p><p>The blood-light approached.</p><p>The crane's figure came to an abrupt halt. Its wings suddenly folded, and the white feathers became almost transparent. Then, a white smoke rose from the ground, and it reverted to the long-bearded Daoist's true form.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist, seeing the ferocious beast's attack from afar, understood that the power of the blood-light was not as simple and crude as it appeared. There were strange variations within, and the previous person had nearly been caught off guard.</p><p>He couldn't be careless; striking first was the right course of action!</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist snorted coldly, and with a flick of his sleeve, a cloud of light mist flew out.</p><p>The mist seemed weightless, as if it would dissipate with a wave. Only upon close inspection could one discover that this was not true smoke, but a fine net.</p><p>A net as delicate as smoke, how much power could it possess?</p><p>In truth, this was the long-bearded Daoist's signature magical treasure, with a rather refined name: Jade Mist Flying Cascade!</p><p>Still as jade mist, moving like a raging torrent.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist grasped and released his palm. The Jade Mist Flying Cascade contracted inward, transforming from absolute stillness to motion, shooting out.</p><p>At this moment, the previous lightness completely vanished. Wherever it passed, it left a white trace in the void, truly resembling a rushing river, its momentum overwhelming.</p><p>Before the long-bearded Daoist could be engulfed by the blood-light, the Jade Mist Flying Cascade intercepted it. A large net suddenly spread open, each thread transparent as jade, fine as hair.</p><p>Radiant and illusory, vast as the sea.</p><p>A violent roar erupted.</p><p>The blood-light did not pause for a moment, completely submerging into the radiant light of the Jade Mist Flying Cascade.</p><p>Space twisted, and the blood-light, like a sword piercing a hall, exploded in the center of the radiance. Its ferocious momentum caused the radiance to constantly fluctuate.</p><p>The Jade Mist Flying Cascade tightened, emitting a ringing sound like the twang of a sword.</p><p>The giant net connected heaven and earth, firmly catching the blood-light, unexpectedly halting its momentum.</p><p>However, the long-bearded Daoist's expression showed no sign of ease, because the ferocious beast's true killing move had not yet arrived.</p><p>Just as he expected.</p><p>A blood-colored vortex appeared in front of the giant net. The killing move hidden within the blood-light finally appeared. However, this time, the blood-colored vortex had only just taken shape when its form changed, transforming into a crimson horn, piercing the radiance, and on the verge of penetrating the Jade Mist Flying Cascade.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist's expression changed drastically. He formed a seal with one hand, striking it towards the Jade Mist Flying Cascade in mid-air.</p><p>This treasure could be both soft and hard!</p><p>The radiance shattered into countless fragments.</p><p>The giant net, however, flashed with spiritual light, its form disappearing.</p><p>In an instant, clouds and mist filled the sky, locking down the void, heavy and immense, completely different from its previous form.</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>The horn plunged into the cloud.</p><p>A muffled boom, like thunder, and immediately half of the cloud was dyed blood-red, showing signs of collapsing.</p><p>A roar sounded, and a streak of light burst out of the clouds. It was the Jade Mist Flying Cascade, rolled into a ball.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist, however, was pale, as if he had suffered a heavy blow. He was thrown backward, his feathered crown askew, nearly swept away by the hurricane. Forcing himself to stabilize, he gasped for breath, grabbed the Jade Mist Flying Cascade, and without looking back, fled at full speed.</p><p>This person appeared to be in a sorry state, but in reality, both he and his magical treasure were unharmed, and he had neutralized the ferocious beast's distant strike.</p><p>Far away.</p><p>Qinsang had been staring intently at this side, witnessing all sorts of strange phenomena.</p><p>"The aura of the clouds... a Pseudo-Numinous Treasure!"</p><p>Qinsang's expression became solemn.</p><p>Without a doubt, the person clashing with the ferocious beast was definitely a Grand Cultivator.</p><p>No wonder he dared to issue a warning with a sword talisman; he indeed possessed the authority to have his words become law.</p><p>Before even entering the Central Province, he had encountered a Grand Cultivator who had already refined his Intrinsic Magical Treasure to the level of a Pseudo-Numinous Treasure.</p><p>Qinsang realized that the "Sacrificial Essence Technique," or similar secret arts, might not be a secret in the Central Province.</p><p>After obtaining the "Sacrificial Essence Technique," Qinsang had tried many times to use this secret art to refine the Cloud Wanderer Sword, accelerating the process of nurturing its true spirit. However, he always failed at the final step.</p><p>His divine sense already met the requirements of the secret art; the gap lay in his Dao attainment.</p><p>After all, he had only recently entered the mid-Nascent Soul stage. He had received some medicinal pills at the Profound Sky Palace, and his cultivation had improved after refining them, but he hadn't had time for secluded cultivation.</p><p>Upon finding the Buddhist bone relic, Qinsang decided to find a place to stay in the Central Province and enter secluded cultivation until he broke through to the late stage.</p><p>As for a cave dwelling, Qinsang had no clear goal yet. He planned to try to find one using the secret information Xiaoxiang Zi had mentioned after understanding the general situation of the Central Province.</p><p>As these thoughts raced through his mind, the ferocious beast roared wildly, chasing after the long-bearded Daoist and gradually disappearing into the distance.</p><p>That Eight Views Pavilion cultivator was definitely no match for the ferocious beast.</p><p>However, the direction he chose to flee was not towards the cultivation world; he seemed in no hurry to escape.</p><p>Something was amiss!</p><p>Qinsang hesitated for a moment, glanced at the green talisman, and refrained from acting rashly. However, he was unwilling to leave just like that. Following the ferocious beast's roars, he made a wide detour.</p><p>He dared not get too close, only able to observe from afar.</p><p>Combining the various actions of the Eight Views Pavilion cultivator.</p><p>Qinsang suspected that the other party was luring the ferocious beast away, likely intending to hunt it!</p><p>Hunting a Deva-stage ferocious beast was shocking.</p><p>Just after arriving in the Central Province, the cultivators here had taught Qinsang a lesson. Xiaoxiang Zi's praise for the Central Province was indeed not exaggerated in the slightest.</p><p>Qinsang dared not approach the ferocious beast, only able to judge its Deva-stage strength through its attacks.</p><p>However, what if it was mid-Deva stage, or even late-Deva stage?</p><p>Since the other party dared to hunt it, they had certainly made thorough preparations. There wouldn't be only one person taking action.</p><p>Qinsang even suspected that there might be Deva-stage cultivators waiting ahead!</p><p>Thinking of the opportunity to witness a Deva-stage battle, even the usually cautious Qinsang couldn't help but feel somewhat excited. After weighing the pros and cons, he decided to stay and watch.</p><p>He understood the taboos of the cultivation world and didn't want to provoke either side. He wouldn't approach the battlefield, and would be satisfied with sensing the momentum of the Deva-stage battle from afar, leaving before the outcome was decided.</p><p>With this thought in mind, Qinsang slowed down.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>Qinsang didn't have to wait long before the shrill cry of the ferocious beast came from deep within the storm. The sound was distorted by rage, unlike thunder, but it was immediately followed by real thunder, earth-shattering!</p><p>From such a distance, Qinsang still felt his mind tremble, and he became even more vigilant and cautious.</p><p>Not long after, Qinsang saw the sky deep within the storm dyed red by blood-light from afar, able to sense the fluctuations of the battle. He then stopped.</p><p>At this time.</p><p>At the place where the Eight Views Pavilion cultivator had set an ambush, an intense battle was taking place.</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist lured the ferocious beast, and the purple-robed elder immediately activated the Sword Jade Thunder Sound Array.</p><p>The cultivators activated the grand array.</p><p>The golden swords, like heavenly pillars, stabilized the eight extremes.</p><p>The purple lightning, like rain, could destroy heaven and earth.</p><p>Unexpectedly, although the ferocious beast was mad, its instinct for danger was very keen. At the last moment, it reacted extremely quickly and was not trapped by the grand array.</p><p>The ferocious beast showed no intention of retreating, brazenly launching an attack.</p><p>The blood-light was thick to the extreme.</p><p>There were no other colors around except for purple and blood.</p><p>Being constantly bombarded by purple lightning, the blood-light not only showed no signs of dissipating, but it actually surged against the trend, as if it was about to swallow the purple lightning.</p><p>For a time, the surrounding golden swords shook violently, and the grand array became unstable, causing the cultivators to be terrified.</p><p>"Not good! Quickly form the Vajra Subduing Demon Array!"</p><p>The purple-robed elder's expression changed drastically. He forcefully threw the golden bead in his left hand out.</p><p>With a flash of golden light, the golden bead hovered above the ferocious beast, spinning rapidly.</p><p>At the same time, in eight directions around the golden bead, the void twisted, and golden light also flickered, transforming into identical golden beads, extremely solid.</p><p>All the golden beads were connected by their Qi, and the cultivators raised their palms, facing the golden beads, assisting the purple-robed elder.</p><p>The grand array felt as if a Vajra were present.</p><p>Buddhist chants sounded, the holy sound of subduing demons.</p><p>Each golden bead trembled constantly, emitting golden light, shooting out golden rings. With a flash, thunderous power struck the ferocious beast one after another.</p><p>Each golden ring that fell would leave a golden halo on the ferocious beast's body.</p><p>...</p><p>Qinsang was watching the battle from a very far distance, only able to judge by the phenomena and his senses.</p><p>"No Deva-stage cultivators?"</p><p>Qinsang narrowed his eyes slightly, somewhat disappointed.</p><p>The Eight Views Pavilion side was most likely using a Spirit Array or similar means. Although powerful, without a Deva-stage cultivator overseeing it, it was probably difficult to trap and kill the ferocious beast.</p><p>Moreover, this was the storm belt, where heavenly secrets were chaotic, which was inherently disadvantageous to cultivators.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qinsang felt even more pessimistic about the Eight Views Pavilion.</p><p>He waited for a while longer, but there was still no sign of a Deva-stage cultivator taking action. Qinsang hesitated for a moment, then slowly retreated. He didn't want the ferocious beast to come looking for him again.</p><p>At this time.</p><p>The ferocious beast's body was already covered in a layer of golden light, forming a large golden halo, swaying like water waves.</p><p>Seeing that the timing was right, the purple-robed elder shouted, "Retract!"</p><p>The originally illusory halo suddenly solidified, becoming a huge golden ring, firmly箍住 the ferocious beast, and rapidly tightening.</p><p>At the same time, the Sword Jade Thunder Sound Array was also driven to its limit by them, with purple lightning descending from the sky, targeting the ferocious beast's four eyes.</p><p>After the fierce battle, they had discovered that the eyes might be the ferocious beast's weak point!</p><p>The ferocious beast let out a shrill cry, attempting to dodge, but it was confined by the golden ring. It went berserk. Strange undulations appeared on its slippery, slimy skin. Then, its skin suddenly shriveled, revealing the bony structure beneath.</p><p>A sword-like bone spur was exposed on its back, separating from the ferocious beast's body, its tip striking the center of the golden ring.</p><p>A bloody hole appeared on the ferocious beast's body. The pain made its roar even more frantic, filled with terrifying killing intent.</p><p>The purple-robed elder had a bad premonition and wanted to activate the Vajra Subduing Demon Array, but it was too late.</p><p>A sound of metal clashing rang out, and blood halos erupted from the bone spur. This was a strange fluctuation they had never seen before. The Subduing Demon Golden Ring unexpectedly snapped.</p><p>The bone spur's momentum did not diminish, piercing through the void, heading straight for the Sword Jade Thunder Sound Array.</p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>The purple-robed elder shouted.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A golden sword was unable to dodge in time and was struck head-on by the bone spur. A horizontal crack immediately appeared on the blade, nearly breaking it.</p><p>A muffled groan was heard, and a figure fell from above the golden sword. It was the female Daoist priest, her face pale and bloodless, seemingly suffering from serious injuries.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the purple-robed elder took a sharp breath, "Retreat!"</p><p>He raised his hand and forcefully threw the purple kerchief he had been holding. It spread open in mid-air, and the cultivators, with tacit understanding, quickly gathered around the purple-robed elder.</p><p>In just this short time, three golden swords had been damaged. It seemed that the Sword Jade Thunder Sound Array could no longer be maintained.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Thunderous light erupted, engulfing everyone.</p><p>At the last moment, they did their best to retrieve the array artifacts.</p><p>When the thunderous light dissipated, everyone had disappeared from their original location, leaving only the ferocious beast's shrill cries.</p><p>Having lost its target, the ferocious beast was enraged to the extreme. It wreaked havoc in the vicinity, wantonly destroying everything it saw. If it weren't in the deserted storm belt, it would have caused a disaster.</p><p>In the end, the ferocious beast was still unable to find its enemies. After venting its anger, it left dejectedly.</p><p>On the small island.</p><p>The restrictive spell was closed, and it was pitch black.</p><p>The cultivators of the Eight Views Pavilion held their breath, not daring to make a sound. Only when the ferocious beast's roars gradually faded away did they breathe a sigh of relief, exchanging glances, terrified.</p><p>"This ferocious beast is even more terrifying than the previous one!"</p><p>The female Daoist priest's voice was weak, filled with lingering fear.</p><p>"Indeed, this ferocious beast's physical body is clearly stronger. We used the Vajra Subduing Demon Array, and although its power is not as great as that of a true Buddhist cultivator, it was broken so quickly, which is somewhat unexpected," the purple-robed elder sighed, looking at the long-bearded Daoist. "Did you record the process of the battle just now?"</p><p>The long-bearded Daoist nodded, revealing a crystal stone, in which light and shadows changed, showing the scene of the fierce battle.</p><p>Only then did they realize that, having lost half of the Sword Jade Thunder Sound Array and several people being injured, suffering such heavy losses, they had not even seen the ferocious beast's full appearance.</p>
