<h1>Chapter 2056: Interception</h1><p>Amidst the green mountains and clear waters, a cool breeze rustled through the bamboo grove, creating a gentle whisper.  By the lakeshore sat a young woman, clad in elegant white robes. Her features were delicate, yet a lingering melancholy clouded her expression as she gazed at her reflection in the water, a picture of self-pity.</p><p>A white ferret nestled lazily in her lap.  Stroking its fur, she murmured wistfully, "Senior Brother Zhan has been gone for more than ten days now.  Little Ferret, do you think he'll come see me first when he returns, or will he go to Third Senior Sister?"</p><p>The ferret, not quite asleep, twitched its tail slightly.</p><p>The young woman, unsure if the ferret understood her words and not expecting an answer from a creature of limited sentience, continued to herself, "If Senior Brother Zhan doesn't come see me first, I'll ignore him for ten days... no! A whole month!  I won't even accept his gifts!"</p><p>She wrinkled her delicate nose and gave a small huff, firming her resolve.</p><p>The ferret rolled its eyes, then, as if sensing something, lifted its head and suddenly darted away.</p><p>Caught off guard, the young woman gasped as a white flash streaked into the bamboo grove, vanishing in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"Little Ferret!"</p><p>"Little Ferret, where are you? Come back..."</p><p>Panicked, the young woman summoned a white silk ribbon and gave chase.  Soaring above the bamboo grove, she scanned the area, but the ferret was nowhere to be found.  All she could do was call out repeatedly.</p><p>Hundreds of miles away, in a mountain hollow far from the young woman's Immortal Sect, the white ferret reappeared.</p><p>Alone and unseen, the ferret stood on its hind legs.  Moments later, its body began to grow and transform, eventually taking on a human form – that of the Si You Clan's Young Lord.</p><p>Staggering slightly, the Si You Clan's Young Lord steadied himself and glanced towards the battlefield, tears slowly trickling down his cheeks.  He knew that from now on, he was alone.</p><p>Wiping away his tears, the Si You Clan's Young Lord's expression hardened. He knew he had to escape this perilous place quickly, lest Attendant Xia's sacrifice be in vain.</p><p>They had anticipated the worst and made preparations. The Si You Clan's Young Lord looked around, quickly choosing a direction.  Just as he was about to flee, a premonition of danger washed over him.</p><p>He looked up sharply.  Without warning, the sky above churned violently as a storm descended.  Two terrifying auras simultaneously enveloped the area, placing him at the storm's epicenter.</p><p>The Si You Clan's Young Lord recognized these auras all too well.  Including this encounter, he had clashed with Ji Liang's two accomplices twice already.</p><p>But these two were clearly still at the other location, besieging them alongside Ji Liang. How could they appear here in an instant?</p><p>Could it be...?</p><p>A terrifying possibility struck the Si You Clan's Young Lord.  What they had seen before might have been mere illusory projections, not their true forms.  Their auras could have been easily imitated.</p><p>He and Attendant Xia, at a severe disadvantage and desperate to escape, hadn't considered this possibility or had the chance to verify their identities.</p><p>Moreover, they hadn't anticipated that their plan had already been discovered.</p><p>During their previous confrontation with Ji Liang and the others, their opponents had clearly been unfamiliar with the Si You Clan's secret techniques. How had they been exposed?</p><p>Unless a new, powerful enemy, intimately familiar with the Si You Clan, had emerged!</p><p>Countless thoughts raced through the Si You Clan's Young Lord's mind.  His limbs turned icy as despair consumed him.  Even without considering the unknown enemy lurking in the shadows, the two opponents before him were more than he could handle in his gravely injured state.</p><p>…</p><p>High above, a jeweled banner unfurled, creating a closed-off space within. While completely sealed from the outside, those manipulating the banner could still perceive external changes.</p><p>The space within the banner was small, making it somewhat cramped for the two figures seated inside.  Had the Si You Clan's Young Lord and Attendant Xia been present, they would have recognized these two as the very figures who had participated in their siege.  Their true bodies had remained hidden here all along.</p><p>The banner hung suspended in the air, its occupants firmly locked onto the island below, sensing any unusual fluctuations in spiritual energy.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman looked up, her gaze fixed on the distant sea, her expression unreadable.</p><p>"Que Li, what is it?" Ji Qiong asked, sensing her shift in attention.</p><p>He wasn't the banner's master, so his spiritual perception was somewhat limited, unable to reach too far.</p><p>However, he knew that Ji Liang had already initiated their attack.  The Si You Clan's Shifting Technique had distance limitations and wasn't actually that close.  Moreover, a grand formation shielded the area, concealing spiritual fluctuations.  For Que Li to have sensed something, something unexpected must have occurred.</p><p>Unless the intensity of the battle had exceeded the formation's ability to conceal it!</p><p>Que Li parted her lips, about to speak, when her gaze suddenly sharpened, falling upon a specific island.</p><p>At the same time, Ji Qiong also sensed it.</p><p>The moment the Si You Clan's Young Lord used the Shifting Technique, they detected him.</p><p>"Only one came?" Ji Qiong said in surprise.</p><p>"Xia Changshi must have fought desperately. This is good. As long as we can capture the young one, whether the old one lives or dies is irrelevant," Que Li said, her face alight with excitement.  Without hesitation, she shot out of the banner's space.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The banner unfurled, its multi-colored radiance churning the surrounding spiritual energy, instantly conjuring a storm that enveloped the area.  Darkness descended upon the world as two streaks of light, swift as falling stars, hurtled towards the spot where the Si You Clan's Young Lord had appeared.</p><p>…</p><p>In the mountain hollow, the Si You Clan's Young Lord realized the danger, but it was too late. He could feel the two powerful enemies' auras locking onto him.  His last companion beast had already dispersed.</p><p>Knowing escape was impossible, and even a desperate fight offered no hope, a resolute glint flashed in the Si You Clan's Young Lord's eyes.  He would never allow himself to be captured alive!</p><p>It wasn't that he didn't value his life, but he knew full well that capture by the Water Ministry would mean only humiliation and a fate worse than death.</p><p>Just then, a look of surprise crossed his face.</p><p>A strange figure materialized in the sky above, intercepting the two powerful enemies.</p><p>The next moment, a chill swept over the Si You Clan's Young Lord, followed by a wisp of black energy that drifted before him.  It swirled, revealing a strange young woman.</p><p>This woman was breathtakingly beautiful, a smile playing on her lips.  Yet, for some reason, meeting her gaze sent a shiver down the Si You Clan's Young Lord's spine.  He felt a sense of impending danger.</p><p>He instinctively stepped back.  "Who are you?"</p><p>"I am Su Nu," the woman replied, studying him with a smile.  "We're here to save you."</p><p>"Save me?"</p><p>The Si You Clan's Young Lord was stunned, glancing up at the sky.  He had thought he was facing certain doom, only for this unexpected turn of events.  Unfortunately, these newcomers were two strangers with unclear intentions, and they appeared to be human cultivators.</p><p>Logic dictated that he should use them to escape, regardless of their motives.  Still, he couldn't help but ask, "Why?"</p><p>Su Nu considered for a moment, then answered frankly, "Because you are valuable."</p><p>The Si You Clan's Young Lord faltered. "How do I know you're not using me for your own ends?"</p><p>"Of course, we intend to use you.  Why else would we risk saving you?"</p><p>Su Nu looked at him strangely, glancing towards the sky. "Coming with us is certainly better than becoming their captive. For now, there is no enmity between us.  Why not gamble on it?"</p><p>The Si You Clan's Young Lord fell silent, then finally nodded decisively. "Fine! I'll go with you."</p><p>Su Nu smiled sweetly.  Seeing the Si You Clan's Young Lord's weakened state, she asked, "Can you walk on your own?"</p><p>The Si You Clan's Young Lord gave a wry smile.  "I should be able to manage for a while."</p><p>His injuries were far from healed, and the forced use of the Shifting Technique, coupled with the shockwave from Attendant Xia's self-destruction, had further weakened him. Even using escape techniques was now a struggle.</p><p>Su Nu shook her head, flicking her sleeve. The silk wrapped around the Si You Clan's Young Lord, and they quietly slipped away from the mountain hollow.</p><p>Before taking action, Qin Sang had discussed their plan with her.</p><p>Qin Sang could handle the two above on his own.  If there were other powerful enemies, Su Nu and the Si You Clan's Young Lord would only hinder him, whereas alone, Qin Sang could fight without restraint.</p><p>Suddenly, the Si You Clan's Young Lord remembered something and spoke urgently, "There are other enemies elsewhere, one comparable to your human Nascent Soul Middle Stage cultivators. Attendant Xia's self-destruction might not have killed him.  There's also potentially another powerful enemy lurking in the shadows, someone intimately familiar with our Si You Clan's royal secret techniques.  He's no ordinary foe.  Please warn your companion to be extremely careful…"</p><p>Su Nu's expression turned serious.  She immediately relayed the information to Qin Sang through voice transmission, then continued to flee without looking back.</p><p>…</p><p>High above, Qin Sang stood with his hands clasped behind his back, unmoved by the raging storm, calmly watching the two streaks of light.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The light converged as Ji Qiong and Que Li materialized in the distance, their expressions wary. "Who are you, and why do you block our path?"</p><p>"You dare to wreak havoc within my academy and conceal your activities with a formation? Your audacity is astounding!" Qin Sang declared in a deep voice.</p><p>Hearing Qin Sang's 'self-introduction,' their expressions stiffened. This situation was becoming far more complicated than they had anticipated.</p><p>They had believed their actions were flawless, never imagining they had been exposed. They had no idea where they had slipped up.</p><p>"This fellow Daoist misunderstands..." Ji Qiong attempted to defuse the situation with words.</p><p>However, Que Li noticed the anomaly in the mountain hollow. "This person is definitely not from the Haitang Academy! Brother Ji, act quickly! Don't let them take the Si You Clan's Young Lord!" she transmitted furiously.</p><p>Ji Qiong instantly understood the gravity of the situation. Whether the opponent was from the Haitang Academy or not, he couldn't acknowledge it now.</p><p>Their mission was to capture the Si You Clan's Young Lord.  Elder Quan would handle the rest.</p><p>Moreover, this situation was full of inconsistencies.  If the Haitang Academy had known all along, why send only one… no, two Nascent Soul Initial Stage cultivators?</p><p>"Vile scoundrel, how dare you impersonate a Haitang Academy master! Get out of our way!"</p><p>Ji Qiong roared, shattering a jade talisman within his sleeve.  He and Que Li then charged towards the mountain hollow.</p><p>This jade talisman was a warning signal given to them by Elder Quan.</p><p>To capture the Si You Clan's Young Lord alive, Elder Quan had condescended to personally oversee this operation, positioning himself between the two locations.  This way, no matter which side encountered trouble, Elder Quan could swiftly provide reinforcements.</p><p>…</p><p>On a small, isolated reef sat a figure cloaked in black.</p><p>Like the white-robed figures, the black robe concealed this person's face.  However, their hunched back and aura of decline revealed them to be an elderly person – Elder Quan.</p><p>The moment the jade talisman shattered, Elder Quan abruptly looked up.  A wizened face emerged from beneath the black hood as an immense aura erupted from his body, scattering the clouds above and causing the surrounding sea level to drop by hundreds of feet.</p><p>He transformed into a furious gale and swept away.</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing Ji Qiong and Que Li's decisive action, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  It seemed a peaceful resolution was impossible today.</p><p>However, he had anticipated this. The Gray Warbler Sword instantly transformed into a streak of sword light, slashing outward.</p><p>The sound of the sword's cry sent a chill down Ji Qiong and Que Li's spines as they felt the sword intent wash over them.  They reacted instantly, diverging their trajectories so that Qin Sang could only intercept one of them.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly, splitting into a Dharma Body.  The sword light flashed, and as if teleporting, he appeared before Ji Qiong in the next instant. Simultaneously, the aura of his Dharma Idol erupted from within, his cultivation rapidly rising as he summoned the Azure Phoenix Dharma Idol and wielded the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.  He then transformed into a streak of azure light, charging towards Que Li.</p><p>Ji Qiong's vision blurred as the sword shadow approached.  He hastily raised his defensive treasure, but the sword didn't strike directly.  Instead, it pulled him into a dim, ethereal realm.</p><p>This realm was illuminated by starlight, and sword energy permeated every inch of space.</p><p>"A Sword Formation!"</p><p>Ji Qiong instantly recognized his predicament, but instead of panic, he felt a sense of relief.</p><p>Of all sword paths, sword formations were the easiest for him to counter, compared to ferocious killing swords or extreme swords.</p><p>As the sword stars shifted, beams of starlight rained down. Ji Qiong knew he wouldn't be able to escape easily.  He could only hope Que Li would succeed.  He activated his defensive treasure, adopting a purely defensive stance, his ears twitching slightly as if listening for something within the void.</p><p>The Quan Feng Clan's Divine Ear technique was renowned for its various applications.  As long as a formation had an escape route, they could potentially 'hear' it.</p><p>Outside the sword formation, Qin Sang's true body and Que Li clashed, engaging in a fierce battle.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's ferocious aura, Que Li was secretly alarmed.  She abandoned the idea of stopping Su Nu and retreated, drawing a silver longbow.</p><p>With bow but no arrow, Que Li aimed at Qin Sang, her fingers drawing the bowstring taut.  A spectral arrow materialized out of thin air.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The spectral arrow flew straight towards Qin Sang's forehead.</p><p>Then, Que Li witnessed an astonishing sight.  Facing the incoming arrow, Qin Sang didn't dodge.  With a low growl, he reached out with both hands.</p><p>*Crack! Crack!*</p><p>One hand grabbed the arrow's shaft, the other its tail.  His arm muscles bulged, emitting a series of cracking sounds as he twisted with force.</p><p>Merely three inches from Qin Sang's forehead, the spectral arrow shattered, dissolving into nothingness.  Qin Sang didn't even blink, his gaze fixed on Que Li with ferocious intensity.  He then charged forward with even greater speed.</p><p>Que Li's eyelids twitched.  She dared not let Qin Sang get close, retreating further and firing arrow after arrow.</p><p>Beams of silver light continuously bombarded Qin Sang, exploding before him.  Yet, his advance remained unwavering, forcing Que Li into a constant retreat, leaving her no time to concern herself with Su Nu and the Si You Clan's Young Lord.</p><p>With Dharma Body and Dharma Idol deployed, he single-handedly battled two powerful foes, preventing them from advancing a single step, ensuring no one obstructed Su Nu and the Si You Clan's Young Lord!</p><p>In the midst of the fierce battle, Qin Sang suddenly felt a surge of alarm, his expression shifting slightly.  Both his Dharma Body and true body looked towards the horizon.</p><p>An overwhelmingly powerful aura was rapidly approaching!</p><p>()</p>
