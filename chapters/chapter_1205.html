<h1>Chapter 1197: Investigation</h1><p>Chapter 1197: Investigation</p><p>To use the teleportation array, one needs to pay a certain amount of spirit stones and present an identity token.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was not afraid of the fragments of the forbidden formations within the Heavenly Scar.</p><p>On his shoulder, the Sky Eye Butterfly vibrated its wings, observing the surroundings, searching for gaps in the formations.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flashed, silently entering the thick fog.</p><p>After entering the Abyss of Sin, Qin Sang had kept the Sky Eye Butterfly outside to act as a lookout.</p><p>Passing through the gaps between the forbidden formation fragments was a piece of cake for the Sky Eye Butterfly.  Qin Sang did not encounter a single formation and easily crossed the Heavenly Scar to the other side.</p><p>He unfolded his topographic map, clarified his direction, and flew towards Near Scar Mountain.</p><p>One day later.</p><p>Qin Sang stood in a mountain forest, looking up at the majestic mountain range in the clouds.</p><p>That was Near Scar Mountain!</p><p>Qin Sang roughly observed Near Scar Mountain, finding two marketplaces nearby.  The layout of the Abyss of Sin was peculiar; it didn't shy away from mortals, and the marketplaces were built close to the mortal realm.</p><p>Currently, entry and exit to the marketplaces were strictly controlled.  As an outsider, it would be difficult for Qin Sang to sneak in unnoticed.</p><p>“It seems I have no choice but to use the same trick again.”</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, pondered for a moment, and his figure vanished from the spot.</p><p>…</p><p>In the desolate mountains and forests.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew through the woods.  A young man in white, his cultivation at only the Qi Condensation stage, but with an outstanding temperament, moved gracefully through the forest.</p><p>He seemed carefree, but a deep anxiety was etched on his face, constantly glancing behind him.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Emerging from the forest, there was still no sign of anything unusual behind him.</p><p>The young man's expression relaxed, then suddenly a voice rang out in his ear.</p><p>“Kid, your Wind-Riding Technique isn't bad, keep running! Let's see how far you can go!”</p><p>The voice shifted from left to right, laced with a playful mockery, like a cat toying with a mouse.</p><p>The young man's face changed drastically. He hastily activated the willow-leaf sword in his hand, slashing fiercely to the left. At the same time, he released a spirit talisman hidden in his palm.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A ball of intense yellow light suddenly erupted from the ground, instantly forming a layer of ochre-colored protective barrier.</p><p>The sword only managed to cut a crack in the barrier.</p><p>But then, the talisman followed, transforming into a streak of blue light.  Intense water-elemental spiritual energy erupted, instantly condensing over a dozen crystal-clear ice cones that struck the barrier without fail.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The protective barrier finally couldn't hold and collapsed.</p><p>As the young man was about to show relief, he found nothing beneath the collapsed barrier.</p><p>That bone-chilling laughter rang out again, "Still a greenhorn, a simple spell tricked you into revealing your Thousand Cone Talisman! What other tricks do you have? If not, this old man will have to make a move!”</p><p>Before the words were finished, the young man felt a cold wind strike from behind.</p><p>He hastily swung his sword backward, but struck nothing again.</p><p>A clang was heard, an iron ring firmly trapping the sword. The young man's face turned pale, hastily reaching for his pouch to retrieve another artifact, but felt a chill in his back.  He looked down to see a blood-stained sword tip.</p><p>The light in his eyes gradually faded.</p><p>After the young man died, a figure clad in black robes and wearing a straw hat appeared behind him.</p><p>This person tossed the young man's body aside, skillfully reaching for the young man's pouch. After a moment, he snorted, “Another pauper! Since those famous sects closed their mountains and the Foundation Establishment experts were sent to the front lines, I don't have to be as careful as before, but it's been a long time since I've done a big deal.”</p><p>As he spoke, he was about to dispose of the body and clear the scene when he suddenly noticed a figure appear behind him, causing his hair to stand on end.</p><p>“Who’s there!”</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the incoming flying sword, smiling at the black-robed man, “I’ll borrow your body for a while.”</p><p>The black-robed man's face was filled with fear, and he turned to flee, only to instantly lose consciousness.</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand, taking the unconscious black-robed man away. He decided to use the "Seed of the Yuan Devil Embryo" to cultivate an external incarnation, using his identity to gather information.</p><p>Because he couldn't use the sword soul to cultivate the devil seed, Qin Sang could only use the original devilish technique, planting the devil seed on a living person.</p><p>Near Scar Mountain was closed off, making it difficult to find disciples of Near Scar Mountain for now.</p><p>Qin Sang could only start with loose cultivators. He knew that there were many evil cultivators who craved ill-gotten gains around the marketplaces, and sure enough, he found one.</p><p>As for the young man, although the Abyss of Sin invasion wasn't the fault of a lowly Qi Condensation cultivator, he was still an enemy to Qin Sang. If the young man could have escaped the evil cultivator, Qin Sang wouldn't have held a grudge, but since he couldn't, he could only blame his own lack of strength.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed this person, casually carved out a cave dwelling in the desolate mountains and wilderness, tossed him aside, and released the fat chicken.</p><p>Go a little further away from Near Scar Mountain, find the corpse of a Foundation Establishment cultivator with an unfamiliar face, and discreetly inquire about the presence of earth-煞 energy in the area... Remember to be low-key and avoid alerting nearby factions.  If you run into a Nascent Soul cultivator, I can't save you.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>If normal methods fail to uncover information on the Corpse Ghost Immortal, he would have to refine a corpse puppet and send his external avatar to flaunt it publicly as bait.</p><p>A corpse puppet refined using unique earth-煞 energy might attract attention.</p><p>Fat Chicken obeyed and left.</p><p>Qin Sang busied himself in his cave abode.</p><p>His cultivation had improved significantly.  Using the *Seed of Demon Fetus* technique was much easier than during his Golden Core stage.  Furthermore, this was merely a tool, so there was no need to cultivate him to the Golden Core or even Nascent Soul stage; meticulousness wasn't necessary.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's perspective had changed. He could now ascertain that this external avatar technique was not a top-tier secret art, it had flaws.  Cultivating the external avatar to the Nascent Soul stage using normal methods was impossible; a waste of energy.</p><p>Unless, like Senior Qingzhu, he could find an unorthodox Nascent Soul cultivation method.</p><p>Within a few days, Qin Sang refined a barely usable demonic seed, implanted it into the cultivator's body, and successfully created an external avatar.</p><p>The external avatar was a short, timid-looking middle-aged cultivator. He rose shakily, looked at Qin Sang with a dazed expression, his eyes gradually clearing before he nodded at Qin Sang and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Qin Sang, without reservation, overdrew the avatar's potential, continuously using the blood-feeding technique to forcibly enhance his cultivation.</p><p>During this time, Fat Chicken returned with a corpse and information about the earth-煞 energy.</p><p>"Master, over a thousand li south of Near Scar Mountain, within the Sky Scar, there's a large accumulation of earth-煞 energy, even bigger than the Earth Sink Cave you mentioned.  Every Foundation Establishment cultivator knows about it; I just asked this fellow and he told me."</p><p>Fat Chicken pointed at the corpse. "However, he'd never heard of the Corpse Ghost Immortal.  Master's orders were strict; I didn't dare to seize too many people."</p><p>"Could this be why the Corpse Ghost Immortal came to Near Scar Mountain? Did he only obtain the corpse refinement techniques after reaching the Golden Core stage?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>This was tricky.  Investigating the Corpse Ghost Immortal's origins and how he obtained the Heavenly Corpse Sect's inheritance would be difficult.</p><p>Leaving Fat Chicken and the external avatar in the cave abode, Qin Sang took the corpse and flew towards the location Fat Chicken had described.</p>
