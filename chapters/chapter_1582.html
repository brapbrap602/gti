<h1>Chapter 1573: Nethermoon Mark</h1><p>‘Crack… Crack… Crack…’</p><p>The sound of cracking ice echoed within the ice cave.</p><p>The pink lightning failed to penetrate the protective罡, dissolving into countless electrical threads that spread out, snaking towards Qin Sang's feet and seeping into the ice.</p><p>The lightning possessed a terrifying corrosive power.</p><p>A large hole was instantly etched beneath Qin Sang.  Wherever the stray electrical threads touched, the ice silently melted away, the effect rippling outwards to a considerable distance.</p><p>A large section of the ice floor collapsed.</p><p>The ice cave was a nexus of Cold煞 energy.</p><p>The Profound Ice here was imbued with Cold煞 energy.</p><p>This free-flowing Cold煞 energy differed from that contained within the Cold Crystals. Qin Sang speculated that the Cold煞 energy within the Cold Crystals had been refined through a spirit array, making it directly absorbable by cultivators.</p><p>However, even this impure Cold煞 energy made the Profound Ice incredibly hard, far surpassing ordinary ice.</p><p>If struck by the pink lightning, the consequences would be dire.</p><p>This demonic woman, striking so ruthlessly with the clear intent to kill, ignited fury within both Qin Sang and Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways at Elder Yanshan.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had specifically inquired whether there were any powerful factions near the snowy plains.</p><p>Elder Yanshan had replied with absolute certainty that there were none.</p><p>In his numerous hunts for Snow Foxes, Elder Yanshan had thoroughly explored the snowy plains.  No matter how much commotion they caused, no one would arrive for quite some time.</p><p>This was why they felt confident breaking the ice walls and pursuing the Snow Fox.</p><p>Yet, now a strange demonic woman had appeared, and her cultivation was incredibly high, also at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had mentally labeled her a "demonic woman," not solely to vent his anger.</p><p>Despite her ruthless actions, Qin Sang had to admit that her every frown and smile exuded an alluring charm.  Moreover, Qin Sang was certain this wasn't a charm technique.  There was no pretense; it was an innate allure, capable of toppling kingdoms.</p><p>“Hmph! Quick to hide, aren't you?”</p><p>Moon Concubine, her attack failing, let out a cold laugh.  Her figure flickered, retreating to a corner of the ice cave, where she stood motionless, seemingly wary of a counterattack.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to ask Elder Yanshan about the woman's identity when his gaze swept across her. He immediately sensed something amiss, a premonition of danger. He fiercely swung his Snow-Treading Divine Saber.</p><p>Saber energy surged like a tide, slashing towards the empty space beside the Cold Crystal ice pillar.</p><p>He was a step too late.</p><p>The ice on the ground bulged slightly. An ice pillar erupted from it, a perfect replica of Moon Concubine frozen in ice.</p><p>The ice sculpture's eyelashes trembled slightly, transforming from ice into real flesh and blood.  Moon Concubine, using some unknown secret technique, had approached the Cold Crystal right under their noses.</p><p>Moon Concubine, ignoring the saber energy behind her, reached for the ice pillar, a pearl concealed in her palm.</p><p>The pink lightning originated from this pearl.</p><p>Crackling sounds filled the air.</p><p>Countless tiny electrical threads, contained within the confines of her palm, shot towards the ice pillar, attempting to shatter it and retrieve the Cold Crystal within.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the lightning bombarded the ice pillar to no effect.</p><p>Moon Concubine was stunned. Then she noticed the spirit array beneath her glowing brightly. A blue light burst from within the ice pillar, resembling a sharp sword, thrusting directly at her face.</p><p>An ice sword before her, a divine saber behind.</p><p>Moon Concubine's expression shifted rapidly. Realizing she couldn't forcibly take the Cold Crystal, she remained calm under pressure.  She tossed her light veil into the air, transforming it into a colorful cloud, intending to use this magical treasure to defend against both attacks simultaneously.</p><p>‘Thud! Thud!’</p><p>The ice sword and the Snow-Treading Divine Saber struck in succession.</p><p>The colorful cloud first entangled the ice sword.  Just as the cloud qi began to churn and crush the ice sword, the Snow-Treading Divine Saber, close behind, struck the cloud's most vulnerable point.</p><p>The light veil couldn't withstand this blow. The colorful cloud collapsed with a ripping sound, countless fragments fluttering down like snowflakes. A superb defensive magical treasure was thus destroyed.</p><p>Moon Concubine seized the opportunity to retreat, escaping this calamity at the cost of a magical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang observed clearly, sudden realization dawning upon him.  The demonic woman's fundamental Dao, like his Avatar's, was the Ice Dao. No wonder she coveted the Cold Crystal as well.</p><p>“So, a thief!”</p><p>Elder Yanshan hadn't had time to react. He'd been startled seeing Moon Concubine approach the Cold Crystal, but thankfully, the pillar had a protective restriction.</p><p>The opponent clearly wasn't aware of this restriction.</p><p>After this sudden turn of events, Elder Yanshan was enraged.  He immediately flung the thin rope in his hand, aiming directly at Moon Concubine's forehead.</p><p>Qin Sang was also irritated.</p><p>This demonic woman, clearly not the master of this place, dared to initiate an attack.  She was truly courting death!</p><p>“Who are you, demonic woman? State your name!” Elder Yanshan roared.</p><p>The thin rope, agile as a serpent, seemed to be aimed at Moon Concubine's forehead.  However, as Moon Concubine moved to defend, its attack changed abruptly, emitting concentric ripples.</p><p>These ripples possessed a binding power, which Elder Yanshan had used earlier to capture the Snow Fox.</p><p>Moon Concubine ignored Elder Yanshan, her gaze fixated on the Cold Crystal, evidently still unwilling to give up.</p><p>Only when she sensed the ripples approaching did she shift her attention.  She quickly removed a silver bracelet from her wrist and flicked it with a finger.  The silver bracelet vibrated, shattering the ripples and blocking the thin rope, engaging in a fierce struggle.</p><p>Elder Yanshan abandoned his dismissive attitude.  “This woman possesses quite a few treasures.  She must have some background.  I wonder if she has accomplices. Fellow Daoist, act quickly!”</p><p>Qin Sang, however, didn't follow Elder Yanshan's urging.  He said in a deep voice, “Fellow Daoist should be able to keep her occupied, correct? This humble Daoist believes he has some skill in array formations, and this pupil technique of mine is helpful for breaking arrays. I hope Fellow Daoist can buy me some time.  After this is over, we'll divide the Cold Crystal equally.”</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang observed Elder Yanshan.</p><p>He had just found the Cold Crystal, and a demonic woman had appeared inexplicably. Was it merely a coincidence?</p><p>Qin Sang became suspicious of Elder Yanshan.</p><p>He had come for the Cold Crystal, so retrieving the treasure was his top priority.</p><p>He could decide how to deal with the demonic woman after obtaining the Cold Crystal.</p><p>His main body was outside. If other experts approached, he would sense them in advance.  He didn't need to worry about that for now.</p><p>Elder Yanshan was slightly taken aback. He turned and met Qin Sang's gaze, nodding in agreement.  “Alright! As Fellow Daoist says! This poor Daoist's abilities are limited.  I fear I may not be a match for this demonic woman.  Fellow Daoist, please don't hold back!”</p><p>With that, Elder Yanshan tapped his foot, flashing towards Moon Concubine, wielding his three-headed dragon shield as a weapon.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>The three-headed dragon shield transformed into three streaks of black light, flitting around Moon Concubine in a dizzying display.</p><p>Qin Sang wondered if he was overthinking things.  Dismissing his distracting thoughts, he flashed to the ice pillar and, with the aid of his Heaven's Eye Butterfly, began to decipher the spirit array on the ice surface.</p><p>Initially, the dense runes made him feel dizzy.</p><p>But Qin Sang soon made an encouraging discovery.</p><p>The person who set up the array possessed exceptional skill in the Ice Dao. The array was infused with Cold煞 energy.  Since his Avatar had previously refined a Cold Crystal, he could use this as a starting point to break the array.</p><p>Elder Yanshan and the demonic woman were both at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.  Even if he couldn't defeat her, Elder Yanshan should be able to keep her occupied.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang didn't forget to dedicate a portion of his attention to guarding against unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>Gradually, he began to unravel the complexities of the array.  He clenched his hand, the Snow-Treading Divine Saber shrinking to the size of a dagger, its blade light restrained.  He lowered it to the ground and began to carve within the array.</p><p>Wherever the tip of the blade passed, it left behind white marks, the saber energy lingering, forming runes and severing the connections between the internal qi flows of the spirit array.</p><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly, pausing only occasionally to ponder.  He was on the verge of breaking the array.</p><p>Suddenly, a cry of surprise startled him.</p><p>He glanced over and saw that the two had stopped fighting at some point. Elder Yanshan stared at Moon Concubine's forehead, his face filled with shock.  “Nethermoon Mark! You're a Nethermoon Guard of Deerfield?”</p><p>Elder Yanshan's attack with the thin rope towards Moon Concubine's forehead had forced out a blood-red moon mark.</p><p>Nethermoon Mark.</p><p>Deerfield.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang's eyelids twitched. Which Deerfield?</p><p>Following Elder Yanshan's gaze, Qin Sang also saw the blood moon on the demonic woman's forehead.</p><p>Elder Yanshan's voice transmission arrived.</p><p>“The cultivation world has always used two symbols to identify demonic cultivators from Deerfield: one is the Dragon-Slaying Demonic Strength, and the other is the Nethermoon Mark on their foreheads, designating them as Nethermoon Guards. However, Old Demon Lu has been silent for centuries, and the Nethermoon Guards haven't been seen in a long time. I recall the number of Nethermoon Guards dwindling…”</p><p>Qin Sang understood, but his mind became even more tense.</p><p>This demonic woman had such a significant background!</p><p>What a coincidence.  He had just entered the ice cave, and a Nethermoon Guard had appeared.  Could the legendary Deerfield be nearby?  An even more terrifying possibility arose:  could the ice cave’s spirit array and the Cold Crystal be the work of Old Demon Lu?</p><p>Both Qin Sang's Avatar and main body were present, but even he wouldn't dare challenge a Deity Transformation cultivator.</p><p>Moon Concubine snorted delicately, “Since you know my identity, why don't you scram!”</p><p>Elder Yanshan's face flickered between pale and green. Then he seemed to recall something. The shock on his face subsided, and he sneered.  “Outsiders fear Old Demon Lu, not you Nethermoon Guards!  You're nothing but disposable blood slaves, yet you dare to address yourself as 'Concubine'!  Old Demon Lu never indulges in women.  Moreover, centuries ago, he went alone to Central Plains to meet with Deity Transformation cultivators of the righteous path, then vanished without a trace.  It's said that the Eight Sceneries Pavilion and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery hold the secrets of ascension.  Whenever a Deity Transformation cultivator appears in the outer realms, they are invited to Central Plains.  Most, like Old Demon Lu, disappear afterwards, rumored to have ascended.  Old Demon Lu hasn't been seen for centuries.  Even if he hasn't ascended, he must be in seclusion, wholeheartedly preparing for ascension…”</p><p>The seductive smile on Moon Concubine's lips faded.</p><p>Growing more animated, Elder Yanshan looked at Moon Concubine with disdain, his eyes filled with scorn. “After a demonic cultivator reaches Deity Transformation, their Nethermoon Mark transforms into a full moon. The mark within you couldn’t possibly be Old Demon Lu’s handiwork!  Old Demon Lu has an adopted son, rumored to be a lecherous fellow who collects beautiful women.  Judging by your cultivation and appearance, you must be quite favored.  However, he hasn’t even bothered to remove your Nethermoon Mark. Heh… In the end, you’re just a plaything!”</p><p>Qin Sang was still processing the information in Elder Yanshan's words.</p><p>Presumably, no cultivator didn't yearn for ascension.  But the “ascension” Elder Yanshan spoke of was clearly different from the ascension of ancient times.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi had left an eight-character箴言:  "After Deity Transformation, one knows the destination."</p><p>Qin Sang had been pondering the meaning of this箴言.  After arriving in Central State, he had been inquiring about the whereabouts of Deity Transformation cultivators but had only obtained vague legends.</p><p>Deity Transformation cultivators were elusive, seemingly vanishing without a trace.  He hadn't heard of any who had perished in heavenly tribulation or from the exhaustion of their lifespan.</p><p>There's always a way.</p><p>With Xiao Xiangzi's eight-character箴言 and these discoveries, Qin Sang stopped pondering the path after Deity Transformation, focusing instead on improving his cultivation and strength.</p><p>Was the place of ascension the same as the "destination" in the箴言?</p><p>Deity Transformation cultivators could “ascend,” and the Eight Sceneries Pavilion and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery knew the secrets of ascension.</p><p>It seemed that these two becoming the leading sects of Daoism and Buddhism, firmly holding their positions as dominant forces, wasn't simply a matter of having numerous Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>Elder Yanshan actually knew so many secrets.</p><p>What was his identity?</p><p>Qin Sang had assumed Elder Yanshan was a detached cultivator with few desires.</p><p>It was normal for him, with his daoist abode in the Northern Wilderness where Deerfield was rumored to be located, to know about Old Demon Lu’s adopted son.  But the other secrets seemed beyond the reach of an ordinary detached cultivator.</p><p>“You’re courting death!”</p><p>A furious roar interrupted Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>Moon Concubine, having been struck at her sore spot, was enraged.  She waved her jade hand, the pink pearl shooting towards the space above Elder Yanshan’s head.</p><p>‘Crackle!’</p><p>Thunder roared.</p><p>The pearl emitted streaks of lightning that intertwined in mid-air, forming a net of lightning that descended upon him.</p><p>This demonic woman, despite her alluring appearance, attacked with increasing ferocity.</p><p>Elder Yanshan didn't dare to be careless. He pointed at his shield with a finger.</p><p>With a whistling sound, the three-headed dragon shield flew upwards.  The tails connected, forming a peculiar triangular shield.  The three dragon mouths simultaneously spewed streams of water, creating a thick water barrier.</p><p>‘Splash! Splash! Splash!’</p><p>The lightning net flashed, plunging into the water barrier.</p><p>The water barrier instantly turned pink, resisting for a moment before being completely corroded.</p><p>Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, Elder Yanshan quickly changed his hand seals.</p><p>The dragon shield expanded rapidly, completely shielding Elder Yanshan, using its main body to withstand the lightning net.</p><p>A loud ‘bang’ resounded.</p><p>The dragon shield vibrated.</p><p>Moon Concubine pressed her attack. The pearl continuously shot out lightning, a rain of thunderous light bombarding the dragon shield relentlessly.</p><p>At the same time, Moon Concubine rubbed her fingers together.</p><p>The ice beneath Elder Yanshan exploded.  A roar like a dragon’s cry erupted from below, and an ice dragon burst forth from the shattered ice.</p><p>The ice dragon had a slender body, entirely formed of ice.  Its horns, claws, and scales were all identical to those of a legendary true dragon. It exuded a majestic aura, and its movements were incredibly lifelike.</p><p>The ice dragon opened its massive maw, lunging to bite Elder Yanshan’s legs.</p><p>Moon Concubine’s every move was a killing blow.</p><p>Elder Yanshan's expression shifted slightly. He twisted his palm, and a silver drop of water slipped down, exploding beneath him into a cloud of silver mist.</p><p>The ethereal mist seemed as heavy as a thousand mountains.  The ice dragon collided with it, a metallic clang echoing. Its momentum was drastically reduced.</p><p>Elder Yanshan seized the opportunity to flash to the side, avoiding the dragon's bite.</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s words had enraged the demonic woman.  Though he was prepared, he was still startled. He transmitted his voice urgently, “This demonic woman definitely isn’t here on Old Demon Lu’s orders.  Fellow Daoist, don’t be intimidated! The Nethermoon Guards are actually Old Demon Lu’s slaves.  Countless Nethermoon slaves have died outside, and no one has ever heard of Old Demon Lu avenging them.  However, the Nethermoon Guards have quite a few experts.  If we delay too long, and this demonic woman summons reinforcements, it will be even more troublesome. Fellow Daoist, quickly retrieve the Cold Crystal and leave this place!”</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced.</p><p>The matter had reached this point; there was no turning back.</p><p>Elder Yanshan’s words made sense.  As long as Old Demon Lu didn't personally intervene, Qin Sang wasn’t afraid of the so-called adopted son and the Nethermoon Guards.</p><p>The one who truly coveted the Cold Crystal was clearly the demonic woman.</p><p>He would quickly take the Cold Crystal and leave.  Would Old Demon Lu really leave his seclusion for his adopted son's concubine?</p><p>It seemed unlikely.</p><p>Currently, Central State had only four known Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p>True Monarch Dan Yu, Holy One Hui Guang, and the Demon Race Saint King had all disappeared.</p><p>Old Demon Lu had vanished even earlier.  Could he be the exception, living in peace and quiet?</p>
