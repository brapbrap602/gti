<h1>Chapter 1193 Near Hen Mountain</h1><p>Chapter 1193 Near Hen Mountain</p><p>Qin Sang was very familiar with Che Yutao.</p><p>When he was at Shao Hua Mountain, Che Yutao was already a Golden Core cultivator.</p><p>Years ago, Che Yutao became a peak Golden Core cultivator, reportedly the one with the highest chance of advancing to the Nascent Soul stage among Shao Hua Mountain's cultivators of his generation.</p><p>Qiu Mu Bai was the most valued disciple of Dongyang Bo and had also broken through to the late Golden Core stage.</p><p>Mu Yifeng was only at the mid Golden Core stage.</p><p>But the others, including Mu Yifeng, were all exceptionally talented.</p><p>Dongyang Bo was clearly protecting his gifted disciples, hoping that someone would advance to the Nascent Soul stage to continue the lineage, preventing them from falling on the battlefield.</p><p>This coincided with Qingzhu's assessment of him.</p><p>Having confirmed Mu Yifeng's safety, Qin Sang felt relieved and didn't need to rush to see him.</p><p>As a disciple of Shao Hua Mountain, Mu Yifeng would likely not lack support in the form of pills. At most, Qin Sang would give Mu Yifeng a few protective treasures and share his insights on forming a Nascent Soul, offering him another perspective.</p><p>As for cultivation techniques and secret arts, most of what Qin Sang cultivated were unorthodox methods, entirely reliant on the Jade Buddha, making them impossible for others to replicate.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the tall building.</p><p>Qin Sang had been cultivating for many days, and the seventh sword soul finally showed signs of merging with his primordial spirit!</p><p>Undisturbed.</p><p>Three more days passed.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes wide, his eyes like lightning, with sword shadows seemingly appearing in his pupils.</p><p>Then, he pointed at the void before him.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword shot out and abruptly stopped in the center of the quiet room.</p><p>Dazzling golden light filled the entire room, then suddenly dimmed, and the Seven Souls Killing Formation silently materialized.</p><p>In an instant, the quiet room became dark and unclear.</p><p>Previously, when Qin Sang used the sword formation, each sword beam was bright and clearly visible.</p><p>Now, within the Seven Souls Killing Formation, all sword shadows seemed unusually illusory, appearing and disappearing, making it difficult to even see the formation's outline, but the entire formation appeared dark, profound, and mysterious.</p><p>"From now on, when fighting opponents, it will be much harder for them to find weaknesses,"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently.</p><p>However, the surprises didn't end there.</p><p>Qin Sang changed the sword formula, and the sword formation underwent countless changes, appearing even more mysterious. As each sword light struck, a previously unseen, peculiar aura appeared.</p><p>After sensing it slightly, Qin Sang's eyes gleamed, "No wonder it's called the Seven Souls Killing Formation! It can actually harm the opponent's primordial spirit. Once I achieve a certain level of mastery over the Seven Souls Killing Formation, I'll have the chance to use the formation's power to capture the opponent's Nascent Soul. Although the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire can also cause the opponent's consciousness to be dazed, it's not my own, and I haven't truly subdued and controlled it. Using the demon banner to unleash it will inevitably have limitations. It's very effective against low-level cultivators, but not very effective against Nascent Soul cultivators with strong wills."</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators are very difficult to kill.</p><p>Even if defeated, at the very least, they can escape with their Nascent Soul.</p><p>Unless there's a huge difference in strength, leaving no chance for the Nascent Soul to escape.</p><p>Therefore, between Nascent Soul cultivators, unless they're certain they can capture the opponent's Nascent Soul, they don't want to create a life-or-death enemy, often resorting to duels, exchanges, etc., to resolve conflicts.</p><p>"Hmm! The Seven Souls Killing Formation is indeed outstanding, but to unleash its full power, I need to further improve my swordsmanship, and it's also related to my cultivation and the grade of my spiritual sword."</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the Seven Souls Killing Formation, experiencing its various changes, hoping to master it as soon as possible.</p><p>After a while, he put away the sword formation and summoned the Ebony Sword.</p><p>The Ebony Sword had been nurtured by his primordial spirit, absorbing the Soul-Nurturing Wood.</p><p>The absorption was not yet complete, and the spiritual sword was still in its embryonic form.</p><p>Just as he was about to carefully examine how much longer it would take, he suddenly felt the quiet room's restriction being activated. A sweep of his divine sense revealed that Fat Chicken and Tan Yi'en were back.</p><p>"I thought the Abyss had captured you!"</p><p>Qin Sang opened the door and looked at the man and the demon, letting out a cold snort.</p><p>These two had gone out to find someone, but unexpectedly stayed away for so long, only returning now.</p><p>Fat Chicken grinned and ran over to take credit, "Master, you are wise! When the Abyss first attacked, we were indeed almost caught up in it. Fortunately, your humble servant was quick-witted and, seeing the danger, immediately hid with young master Tan. Otherwise, we wouldn't have seen you, Master! On the way, I heard about Master's reputation for slaying a Nascent Soul cultivator, Master's martial arts are unparalleled, and you will surely unify Xiao Han Domain! No! Unify Bei Chen Region! And wipe out the demon race!"</p><p>Qin Sang ignored Fat Chicken's rambling and looked at Tan Yi'en.</p><p>Tan Yi'en was much more well-behaved.</p><p>"Reporting to Master Uncle, it didn't take long for me to find my father's two old friends, but the information they revealed led to another person. After discussing with them, we decided not to disturb Master Uncle, and we'll report to you after we find that person and obtain concrete information."</p><p>Qin Sang was very pleased.  The younger generation was clever and efficient.</p><p>"That person is also a Golden Core cultivator, surnamed Tong.  Elder Tong isn't from either of the two realms, but from a desert oasis. After a Sin Abyss attack, he was forced to flee with his family to the Skywalk Alliance. After many difficulties, we finally met Elder Tong. From him, we learned some news about my father. However, we can't determine its truthfulness. Elder Tong also wishes to report to Master Uncle in person, and is waiting outside the formation…"  Tan Yi'en said.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, understanding the man's intentions.  "This isn't a secret. Bring him in. Tell him that if his information is valuable, I won't be stingy with rewards."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Tan Yi'en left, and soon returned with a middle-aged cultivator in formal robes.</p><p>"Junior Tong Jinshan, pays his respects to the Demon King!"</p><p>Facing a renowned great demon, Tong Jinshan felt some fear, but as a Golden Core cultivator himself, he managed to maintain his composure.</p><p>"What is your relationship with Tan Hao? Do you know his whereabouts?" Qin Sang went straight to the point.</p><p>"My home was destroyed by the Sin Abyss, and I harbor deep hatred for it. I fought alongside Daoist Friend Tan on the battlefield, sharing hardship together. Daoist Friend Tan is incredibly righteous, and I received his help."</p><p>Tong Jinshan hesitated, glancing at Tan Yi'en.  "If others asked about Daoist Friend Tan, I would never easily tell them. Since it's nephew Yi'en searching for his father, I assume you wouldn't harm Daoist Friend Tan. Moreover, Daoist Friend Tan went deep into the Sin Abyss and never returned, missing for a hundred years. I am also very worried…"</p><p>"He really went to the Sin Abyss!" Qin Sang's gaze sharpened.</p><p>Tong Jinshan continued without reservation, "We once joined forces to kill a Sin Abyss Golden Core cultivator. This person was a necromancer, and his corpses were quite strange. His strongest flying night rakshasa wasn't powered by Yin energy, but Earthly煞 energy. For some reason, when Daoist Friend Tan saw this person, it was as if he encountered a mortal enemy. He didn't hesitate to spend all his wealth to ask us for help, determined to capture this person. Unfortunately, this person was quite powerful, aided by the flying night rakshasa. The battlefield was chaotic, and he almost escaped. We only managed to kill him. Finally, we learned from other captives that this person was a lone cultivator, previously active near the Jinhen Mountain in the Sin Abyss…"</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Thanks to Wang Duoyu from Qidian for the generous donation!</p><p>I owe three chapters.
