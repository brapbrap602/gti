<h1>Chapter 1978: Two Against One</h1><p>A streak of light shot out from Soul-Severing Abyss, incredibly swift.  It crossed the wasteland, entered Duskfall Mountain, and headed east.</p><p>The light was like a grey wave, tearing across the sky, vast and powerful.</p><p>‘Rumble… Rumble…’</p><p>The sound of it breaking the air was like heavenly thunder, earth-shattering, bringing unprecedented shock to the wasteland and Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>Countless cultivators awoke from their meditative trances, their faces filled with horror.</p><p>Before they even heard the thunder, they felt an overwhelmingly terrifying pressure permeating the heavens and earth.</p><p>It felt as if the sky was about to collapse!</p><p>Instinctive fear caused countless people to tremble, cowering in their caves, shivering.</p><p>The end of the world, the earth shattering, nowhere to escape.</p><p>The thought of resistance didn't even cross their minds; the pressure seemed to represent the will of heaven and earth.</p><p>Born between heaven and earth, who would dare to oppose the will of heaven and earth?</p><p>…</p><p>In a valley, greenery stretched like an ocean, ancient trees towering.</p><p>‘Chirp… Chirp…’</p><p>Joyful sounds echoed through the woods.</p><p>Through the gaps in the leaves, a group of white-furred, long-armed spirit monkeys could be seen chasing and playing.</p><p>These monkeys leaped from branch to branch, as if walking on level ground, incredibly agile.</p><p>Their movements had a strange rhythm, like a unique, natural martial art.</p><p>The monkeys were completely unaware.</p><p>On a nearby tree, a faint human figure stood, watching the monkeys with interest, his fingers moving slightly, seemingly mimicking their movements.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed.  He flickered, pressing himself against the tree trunk, his body flowing like water, merging into the bark of the ancient tree.</p><p>The tree bark twisted, revealing a terrified human face.</p><p>The monkeys sensed something amiss, let out sharp cries, and scattered.</p><p>Even hidden within the tree, the person felt uneasy. He fled from the trunk into the earth, using secret techniques to hide within the roots.</p><p>The next moment, the streak of light flew overhead.</p><p>Underground, a figure the size of a cicada huddled in the tree roots, trembling uncontrollably, too afraid to return to the surface for a long time.</p><p>…</p><p>A peculiar peak in Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>The scenery was beautiful, the spiritual energy abundant.</p><p>Here resided a sect called the Eight Cauldrons Sect, neither entirely righteous nor entirely evil, quite famous throughout Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>The Eight Cauldrons Sect's founder was a Yuan Ying cultivator.  Successive sect masters failed to surpass him.  The current sect master, however, discovered flaws in their cultivation techniques, reformed them, and broke through to the Nascent Soul stage, a true prodigy.</p><p>Because of the current sect master's achievement, the Eight Cauldrons Sect's reputation spread throughout Duskfall Mountain.</p><p>However, this sect master was very level-headed. He didn't rush to expand the sect, instead focusing on steady growth and restraining his disciples from arrogance.</p><p>One day, the mountain gate's tranquility was shattered by urgent bell tolls.</p><p>The Xuan bell's ringing signified that the Eight Cauldrons Sect faced life or death.</p><p>Accompanying the bell tolls was the sect master's roar, "Activate the mountain protection formation immediately!"</p><p>The Eight Cauldrons Sect disciples were terrified. They had never seen their sect master so urgent and panicked.</p><p>The moment the formation activated, the terrifying pressure swept over them.</p><p>Even the mountain protection formation couldn't completely block that pressure.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>The Eight Cauldrons Sect disciples trembled, involuntarily kneeling on the ground.</p><p>In front of the sect master's hall, the Eight Cauldrons Sect master stared fixedly at the streak of light in the sky, using immense willpower to steady his mind.</p><p>His eyes were filled with awe, horror, and deep anticipation!</p><p>…</p><p>The river flowed endlessly.</p><p>The river ran between two mountains, the terrain dangerous, the current swift.</p><p>White waves constantly splashed on the surface.</p><p>From time to time, river fish leaped out of the water.  As they fell, a slender black shadow would rise from beneath the surface, revealing a sharp mouth full of fangs, swallowing the fish in one gulp.</p><p>When the pressure arrived.</p><p>In an instant, the wind howled, the waves grew violent, and the water from the riverbed seemed to be churned up.</p><p>The streak of light flew past, disappearing into the sky in a blink.</p><p>The river gradually calmed down. A monster, neither fully snake nor fish, floated to the surface, belly up, lifeless.</p><p>It was the fish-eating beast.</p><p>It had been so frightened that it died on the spot!</p><p>…</p><p>The higher one's cultivation, the more they sensed the immense power of the being behind that streak of light.</p><p>They had finally witnessed a legendary Void Refinement cultivator, one who could control the heavens and earth; but such an impact was not something everyone could bear.</p><p>Old Ancestor Minghu seemed very urgent, speeding through the air, making no effort to hide his tracks.</p><p>He couldn't afford to be slow. The蟠龙天柱  was discovered by the Nine Immortals of Yun City. Only two people were present at Soul-Severing Abyss; they were powerless to stop the Nine Immortals of Yun City.</p><p>A moment's delay, and Yun City might seize the opportunity.</p><p>Concealing his aura was pointless; in the vicinity, only Gu Yunshou possessed the qualifications to contend for the Panlong Heavenly Pillar.</p><p>With the Panlong Heavenly Pillar’s emergence, even Gu Yunshou couldn't remain idle and would surely descend the mountain.</p><p>The value of a single Panlong Heavenly Pillar surpasses all other relics combined.  The gentlemen's agreement between the two sects did not include it!</p><p>Gu Yunshou’s manifested body traveled, though not as spectacular as the arrival of the ancestor of the冥鹘 , still creating quite a stir in the Yun Du mountains, its speed unimpeded.</p><p>...</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang, unknown to anyone, exited seclusion, leaving the subterranean dwelling and rising into the sky, his gaze fixed on the north.</p><p>"He's already descended the mountain?"</p><p>A cultivator at the Transcendent Void realm moving, shaking the world.</p><p>Qin Sang murmured to himself, quite surprised.</p><p>His actions in the Fire Domain, intervening in human affairs, were all part of a plan to lure two Transcendent Void cultivators out.</p><p>His wish was granted today, but it was unexpectedly swift.</p><p>Too fast, too easy.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the true value of the Red Fire Copper Pillar.</p><p>Relying solely on it to alarm two Transcendent Void cultivators was a possibility, but Qin Sang hadn't held high hopes.</p><p>As long as it could incite conflict between the two sects and deepen their animosity, it would serve its purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang had prepared for two scenarios: intervening in human affairs while placing his pieces, gradually dragging the two sects into a quagmire.</p><p>It had succeeded so easily, rendering his subsequent plans unnecessary.</p><p>This indicated the Red Fire Copper Pillar’s value far exceeded his estimations.</p><p>Losing such a treasure didn’t bother Qin Sang in the least, as it wasn't important.</p><p>Instead, he felt a surge of excitement, eager to act.</p><p>Excellent!</p><p>His ideas were finally going to be tested!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, and he looked down at Qingyang Temple below.</p><p>At the foot of the mountain, smoke curled from chimneys.</p><p>Yu Lang had achieved great success, his school becoming a sacred place in the hearts of Yan Kingdom’s people, with countless scholars coming to pay homage.</p><p>Qipai Village benefited from this, expanding constantly and growing prosperous, now resembling a small town.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed his palm downward.</p><p>An invisible barrier enveloped the land, shielding the mortals’ sight and concealing all fluctuations.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mountain peak where Qingyang Temple stood suddenly cracked.</p><p>The fissure ran through the mountain, precisely cutting through the temple, splitting the main hall in two.</p><p>The mountain slowly tilted, poised on the brink of collapse.</p><p>The mountain’s interior was exposed, revealing flashing lightning, and the main altar appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged high above, directly over the main altar, eyes closed in meditation, forming lightning seals.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A muffled roar, as if from the depths of the earth, echoed across the land.</p><p>The mortals below heard nothing, continuing their lives normally.</p><p>Even the cultivators near Jinyang County remained oblivious.</p><p>Qin Sang deliberately suppressed all unusual phenomena, but his actions did not stop; his hand seals changed, faster and faster.</p><p>With each seal, a lightning talisman flew out, sinking into the main altar.</p><p>The altar then produced lightning that shot towards the heavens, divine thunder filling the sky.</p><p>In an instant, a vast sea of thunder formed between heaven and earth.</p><p>Qin Sang basked in the sea of lightning; beneath him, the lightning coalesced into an enormous lightning altar.</p><p>This altar connected heaven and earth, brewing divine power, yet remaining dormant.</p><p>The next moment, the altar below reacted again, emitting a blinding silver light, even surpassing the thunder above.</p><p>A silver “sheet” materialized within the main altar, radiating an extraordinarily mysterious aura.</p><p>The surface of the silver sheet was covered with writing.</p><p>The writing constantly changed.</p><p>These characters were exceptionally profound, embodying the ultimate principles of heaven and earth; a single character seemed to contain infinite knowledge.</p><p>Mortals who merely glanced at it risked mental collapse, their brains bursting!</p><p>The silver sheet fluctuated, threatening to leave the altar and shoot into the sky, but Qin Sang held it back.</p><p>This was his initiation of the altar; it wasn’t yet activated, only gathering power.</p><p>With the main altar’s appearance, the entire array came to life.</p><p>In the four cardinal directions, Taiyi, Luohou, Lingshi, and Guihou—the four Transcendent Spirits—sat cross-legged on the subsidiary altars, their faces solemn.</p><p>They held their positions at the four subsidiary altars, acting as the pillars of the array, stabilizing the four cardinal points and protecting the main altar!</p><p>Qin Sang’s will, transmitted through the main altar, flowed through the array; the subsidiary altars beneath the four Transcendent Spirits blazed with lightning.</p><p>Besides the four subsidiary altars, other altars also had masters present.</p><p>These masters included fire spirits and demons; almost no humans, and all had assumed their true forms.</p><p>Over the years, they were assigned to the four Transcendent Spirits, studying lightning techniques and achieving a degree of mastery.</p><p>Now, these demonic beings sat cross-legged, imitating the posture of humans, following the unseen commands to cast spells, with blazing lightning fires burning beneath them.</p><p>The altars seemed to be ablaze.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't demand high intelligence from them; they only needed to wield thunder magic,  guard the branch temples, and stabilize the temple array.</p><p>Four powerful cultivators received Qin Sang's guidance, and the branch temple masters obeyed the four.</p><p>Branch temples and the main temple—all temple masters were interconnected, forming a vast temple array covering the land!</p><p>Qin Sang was the master of the main temple, the controller of the array.</p><p>He initiated the array for the first time, feeling the entire structure, a strange expression on his face.</p><p>At that moment, he recalled scenes from the talisman world.</p><p>Remnants of the Daoist court, relying on temple altars, gathered the power of Dao, and Grand Master Zhang used an altar to summon a deity, breaking through and destroying the Great Vehicle cultivator in one fell swoop.</p><p>The astonishing power was awe-inspiring.</p><p>Qin Sang finally experienced the power of a temple altar firsthand, truly living up to its reputation!</p><p>However, the altar beneath him was certainly not among the top ones in the Daoist court.</p><p>The path to immortality was long; he still had a long way to go.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, slowly opened his eyes, and stood on the thunder altar.</p><p>Looking around, Qin Sang took a step to his left, leaving an exact copy of himself behind.</p><p>Two Qin Sangs stood side-by-side, one the original, the other a Dharma body.</p><p>This was a true Dharma body, not the incarnations from his past lives.</p><p>The Dharma body raised its hands, palms down; a flash of sword light appeared, a sword shadow emerged, the blade hanging upside down, slowly rotating.</p><p>This sword was the Grey Sparrow Sword.</p><p>Moreover, it was the Grey Sparrow Sword, transformed into a spiritual treasure, having nurtured a spiritual embryo!</p><p>‘嗡！嗡！’</p><p>The Grey Sparrow Sword seemed to sense its master's thoughts, emitting a sharp, resonant hum, full of spirit.</p><p>The spiritual sword burst forth with killing intent, its blade ready to follow its master's will, cutting down all enemies!</p><p>“嘎嘎！”</p><p>Along with the sword's hum came a strange bird call.</p><p>A ring of fire swirled around the Grey Sparrow Sword, the Vermillion Bird.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird, seemingly pent-up for too long, lacked any saintly demeanor, its call filled with excitement, urging Qin Sang: “Faster! Faster! Faster! I, the Vermillion Bird, can't wait! First place is mine!”</p><p>This foolish bird was incredibly bold and reckless.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head silently.</p><p>The Vermillion Bird knew what they were about to do but showed no fear or worry.</p><p>The Dharma body flicked its sleeve, storing the Grey Sparrow Sword and Vermillion Bird within.</p><p>Simultaneously, a green light appeared behind Qin Sang's original body. The pure green light accompanied a phoenix cry as the Azure Dragon Dharma form was summoned!</p><p>The Azure Dragon spread its wings, its feathered wings obscuring the sky.</p><p>The Azure Dragon Dharma form stretched its body, soared into the sky, and dove down, transforming into a green ray that entered Qin Sang's head.</p><p>The Dharma form and physical body merged, Qin Sang's aura instantly changing.</p><p>At the same time, five-colored light flashed, and Xiao Wu appeared.</p><p>Returning to the mountain, Xiao Wu seemed to have forgotten the mundane world, her appearance refined.</p><p>She stood beside Qin Sang with her eyes closed, serene and innocent.</p><p>The original body took Xiao Wu's hand, nodded to the Dharma body, and headed northeast.</p><p>…</p><p>Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou left the mountain gate, traveling alone westward.</p><p>His escape technique was quite unique; he pointed his purple bamboo staff forward, its tip touching the void, releasing a purple glow.</p><p>The purple glow, like lightning, instantly traversed mountain ranges. When the glow weakened, Gu Yun Sou would reappear within it.</p><p>The purple lightning continuously leaped, gradually reaching the edge of Yun Du Mountain.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou held his staff in one hand, the other hand calculating something, his expression uneasy.</p><p>“That corpse demon, I wonder if its powers have reached their peak. If so, it will be difficult to deal with…”</p><p>While pondering, Gu Yun Sou suddenly felt something, his expression changing drastically. He pressed his purple bamboo staff heavily into the void, stopping the purple lightning.</p><p>In front of him, on a mountaintop, stood a strange Daoist, looking back with his hands behind his back.</p><p>“Which Daoist friend, why are you blocking this old man’s path!”</p><p>Gu Yun Sou shouted sharply, not making a rash move.</p><p>He sensed the aura of a Dharma form from the Daoist.</p><p>Although some exceptionally talented demon cultivators could comprehend Dharma forms at the Transformation God stage, it was impossible to possess such powerful and concentrated Dharma power!</p><p>Something was amiss.</p><p>He had never met this Daoist, yet he was blocking his path; was he a henchman summoned by the corpse demon?</p><p>“This Daoist is Qingfeng. I have long admired Daoist friend Gu Yun Sou's reputation and have come to pay my respects.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed from afar, stepping aside to reveal what was behind him: a stone table carved into a chessboard, two stone stools, and black and white chess pieces.</p><p>The chessboard and pieces were carved from ordinary stone, locally sourced.</p><p>“I hear that you are skilled in the art of Go. I would like to invite you to a game, what do you say?” Qin Sang invited with a raised hand.</p><p>Gu Yun Sou narrowed his eyes, examining Qin Sang for a moment, then looking at the chessboard, seemingly pondering.</p><p>After a short while, he actually flew forward, landing beside the chessboard, gently tapping the ground with his purple bamboo staff.</p><p>Qin Sang lifted his Daoist robe, sat down, and instructed, "Xiao Wu, serve tea!"</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Xiao Wu approached with a tea tray.</p><p>Like a well-behaved young Daoist boy, she knelt down properly beside them, arranging the teapot and teacups, meticulously brewing the tea.</p>
