<h1>Chapter 1340: Sacred Flame</h1><p>The ghostly mist had thickened to its extreme, resembling a turbid, murky river swirling around the blood-red altar. From all directions, countless malevolent spirits and vengeful ghosts emerged, exuding an aura of deep-seated resentment. They revealed their true forms—grotesque and incomplete, their bodies fragmented as they were swept along by the river toward the blood-red altar. Struggling desperately in the water, they let out helpless and agonized screams. The scene was reminiscent of the legendary Yellow Springs.</p><p>As the ghosts approached the altar, they were assimilated by the ancient blood-red restrictions, vanishing into nothingness and becoming part of the altar itself. Countless ghosts were devoured by the altar, causing its bloody glow to grow increasingly intense. Above the altar, a crimson cloud materialized, radiating a thick, metallic scent of blood. Its bloody light shot straight into the heavens.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The crimson cloud churned violently, accompanied by howling yin winds and tremors in the void. The spectacle was no less awe-inspiring than the five-colored immortal winds within the inner palace. A strange ripple spread through the void above the altar, as though something was brewing.</p><p>Old Demon Ye and Jade Bone hovered in mid-air, their figures appearing fragile and isolated amidst the chaos. Countless malevolent spirits surrounded them, filled with hatred yet unable to approach. Old Demon Ye raised his head, his gaze piercing through the crimson cloud to fixate on the top of the altar. His eyes burned with fervor, showing no interest in Jade Bone's words. Jade Bone, too, fell silent, neither of them paying any heed to Qin Sang.</p><p>From the palms of Jade Bone and Old Demon Ye, thin crimson threads extended, drifting through the ghostly mist.</p><p>After some time had passed, Old Demon Ye occasionally glanced at the altar, licking his lips before asking in a hoarse voice, "How many more souls must be devoured before the seal is broken? Our enemies are growing in number. The Soul Infant Array, which commands ten thousand souls, is nearing its limit and won't be able to hold them much longer. If they break free and destroy too many Blood Infant Crystals, it will jeopardize our plans."</p><p>The Nascent Souls fused with the crystal spheres were what Old Demon Ye referred to as Blood Infant Crystals. These Nascent Souls had long since lost their consciousness, transformed into ferocious Blood Infants under their control, forming the Soul Infant Array.</p><p>"If you had known this would happen, why didn't you act sooner?" Jade Bone sneered. "If you had opened the seal earlier and gathered enough souls outside, we wouldn't have needed to cause such a commotion..."</p><p>Mid-sentence, Jade Bone suddenly paused, turning his head to look in Qin Sang's direction. A soft exclamation escaped his lips.</p><p>"Sacred Flame?"</p><p>His tone carried a mix of surprise and delight.</p><p>Old Demon Ye, puzzled, turned to look at Jade Bone.</p><p>...</p><p>Within the ghostly mist, Daoist Zhenyi and the others were surrounded by swirling crimson clouds and countless vengeful spirits. The ghosts, their eyes blood-red, radiated palpable malice, as though controlled by some force, appearing both sinister and frenzied as they attacked the group.</p><p>Noticing a streak of light speeding toward them, Daoist Zhenyi's expression first turned wary, but upon recognizing the light, it quickly shifted to joy. "Fellow Daoist Qin!"</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A streak of sword energy, like a silken ribbon, shot ahead of Qin Sang, piercing through the ghostly mist and striking a crimson cloud. The cloud burst apart upon impact, but in the next instant, the scattered fragments coalesced once more, restoring it to its original state. Despite the impressive display, the sword strike had done no real damage to the cloud.</p><p>Qin Sang, following closely behind, came to an abrupt halt, his expression grave as he observed the crimson cloud.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, be careful! Do not let the crimson cloud get close to you. It is a soul-refining evil entity that can corrupt both the body and true essence. If it invades your body, the consequences will be dire!" Daoist Zhenyi shouted in warning.</p><p>As soon as Daoist Zhenyi spoke, two crimson clouds shifted their focus, lunging toward Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his Ebony Wood Sword, frowning as he glanced at the clouds. With a swift movement, he retreated, leaving behind a shadowy figure—his Nascent Soul Puppet. As a puppet, it should be immune to these malevolent entities.</p><p>Eager to uncover the truth of the situation and concerned for Qing Jun and Bai's safety, Qin Sang decided not to conceal the Nascent Soul Puppet any longer.</p><p>In the next moment, the Nascent Soul Puppet threw a punch at the crimson cloud!</p><p>The puppet's body shimmered with runes, faintly revealing the outline of its control seal, along with a faint blue glow. As it struck, a black light erupted from its fist, forming a shadowy fist that shattered the crimson cloud into fragments.</p><p>The fragments drifted toward the Nascent Soul Puppet. Qin Sang ordered the puppet not to evade, and as he had anticipated, the fragments merely clung to its exterior, unable to penetrate.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's expression relaxed slightly. He commanded the Nascent Soul Puppet to clear the path, following closely behind it with his sword at the ready.</p><p>The duo charged forward, the surrounding crimson clouds and vengeful spirits lunging at them madly. The Ebony Wood Sword slashed through the ghosts, while the Nascent Soul Puppet dispersed the crimson clouds. Each had their role, and together they advanced swiftly.</p><p>Seeing this, Daoist Zhenyi quickly rallied the others to provide support.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A shadowy figure burst out from a crimson cloud, appearing before them. Even with Daoist Zhenyi's cultivation, he couldn't help but feel a chill upon meeting the figure's murderous gaze. Glancing at the Nascent Soul Puppet, Daoist Zhenyi recognized it as Qin Sang's puppet. Suppressing his astonishment, he waved his horsetail whisk, sending out streaks of white light to help Qin Sang alleviate the pressure.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Qin Sang broke through the encirclement, nodding to the others in greeting before seamlessly joining the battle, fighting alongside them.</p><p>The Nascent Soul Puppet and Qin Sang fought side by side. The others couldn't help but glance at the puppet from time to time, their expressions varying but all filled with shock. Qin Sang's reputation had even begun to surpass that of some seasoned experts, despite having formed his Nascent Soul only a few decades ago. Such achievements were already astonishing.</p><p>Who could have imagined that, just twenty years after the great battle, he had somehow acquired a Nascent Soul-level puppet? Judging by its performance, it seemed slightly stronger than an early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. How could they not be shocked?</p><p>Daoist Zhenyi, recalling Qin Sang's relationship with Qing Jun, found it surprising but not entirely inexplicable. He chose not to pry and instead addressed the matter at hand. "Fellow Daoist Qin, did you just come from the inner palace?"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. "Indeed! I ventured into a secret realm, only to find that the ancient restrictions within it blocked my communication talismans. When I saw the message, I rushed over, but none of you were here... What exactly happened?"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, there's no need to worry. When we separated, I saw Fellow Daoist Leng and Fellow Daoist Jingyu together. They should be safe," Daoist Zhenyi reassured him, understanding Qin Sang's true concern. After calming him, he continued, "We searched the inner palace but found no trace of Old Demon Ye. The anomalies in the inner palace grew increasingly violent, and the power of the ancient restrictions in the secret realms made us hesitant to proceed. With the appearance of the five-colored immortal winds, the inner palace became even more dangerous, so we considered retreating to observe the situation. Just then, the blood-red altar emitted a towering blood light, revealing Old Demon Ye's location. We returned to the outer palace, intending to capture him first, as he might know the cause of the anomalies in the Purple Micro Palace. Aside from you, Feather King, and Fellow Daoist Lu, most of the top experts have gathered here..."</p><p></p>
