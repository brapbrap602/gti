<h1>Chapter 1777: A Deadly Situation</h1><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>Despite Qin Sang's best efforts to dodge, he was grazed by the rosy light.</p><p>He was flung away like a rag doll, his back searing with pain. Blood flowed freely from the torn flesh, and the scent of burning skin filled the air.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he sprang up before even hitting the ground and fled once more.</p><p>This wasn't the first time Qin Sang had been hunted by a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Just like when he faced Mo Qingzhu, he was utterly powerless to fight back.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Just as Qin Sang had sprung up, a streak of light slammed into the ground, blasting a deep crater.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King watched Qin Sang's desperate struggle with cold eyes, advancing leisurely as if she were herding him towards the edge of the Spirit Locking Domain.</p><p>Qin Sang knew he couldn't let that happen.</p><p>Outside the domain, he would face the combined might of all the demon kings. Any one of them could crush him like an ant.  That would be true despair.</p><p>What to do?</p><p>His mind raced, desperately searching for a solution.</p><p>Bai was also trying to find a way out, but without the protection of the grey mist, he couldn't leave Qin Sang's side.</p><p>Having used the Star Conch, Bai had no stronger means left.</p><p>The Demon Lord and Lingzhuzi's followers were nowhere to be found. Such a commotion hadn't alerted them; they were likely on the other side of Yitian Peak.</p><p>Old Devil Mou had deliberately chosen a path to avoid them, unknowingly walking into an even greater danger.</p><p>Shifting the blame wouldn't work now.</p><p>It seemed his only option was to stall for time, gambling that the Nine Phoenix King's long feathers had limited power and couldn't be used indefinitely.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A boulder shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang dodged sideways, narrowly avoiding another attack. The Nine Phoenix King's assault was too fierce. Feeling its terrifying power, Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Just then, as he passed through a thicket, he caught a glimpse of something shimmering in the depths. To his surprise, it was a lake.</p><p>“Poison Pool!”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered. Ning Wu Hui had mentioned it before. The poisonous nature of the secluded valley stemmed from several locations within called Poison Pools.</p><p>These pools contained incredibly toxic water, dreaded even by Nascent Soul ancestors. They were the source.</p><p>The inner valley was desolate.</p><p>This was the first body of water Qin Sang had seen since entering. It could only be a Poison Pool!</p><p>“A chance!”</p><p>His eyes lit up.</p><p>But then, he hesitated.</p><p>The valley's poison was already comparable to the core region of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>If the airborne toxins were so potent, how deadly would the source itself be?</p><p>Could the Fat Silkworm withstand it?</p><p>But with no other options, Qin Sang hardened his resolve. He changed direction and ran straight towards the Poison Pool.</p><p>He swallowed all the Snow Toad Pills Ning Wu Hui had given him and activated all his poison-repelling treasures. At the same time, he ordered the Fat Silkworm to condense its protective shell.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's move, the Nine Phoenix King's eyebrows shot up. Qin Sang was too close to the pool. It was too late to intercept him with her Heavenly Phoenix True Feather.</p><p>Covered in layers of protective barriers, Qin Sang reached the edge of the Poison Pool, closed his eyes, and jumped in.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The moment he entered the pool, a poison-repelling jade pendant shattered.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He hastily reinforced his protective barrier, merging it with the Fat Silkworm's shell, to resist the toxic water, and then quickly sank.</p><p>Inside the Poison Pool, spiritual sense couldn't be extended. According to Ning Wu Hui, the Poison Pools were interconnected, forming a complex network. As long as he could escape the Nine Phoenix King's sight, he had a chance to get away.</p><p>As he descended, he kept a close eye on the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>One by one, his poison-repelling treasures burst.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm crawled out from Qin Sang's inner armor and perched on his shoulder, its body tense and arched, spewing colorful halos to strengthen the protective shell. Its breathing was rapid and labored.</p><p>Fortunately, the Fat Silkworm seemed to be holding on.</p><p>Qin Sang's anxiety eased slightly.</p><p>Above the Poison Pool, the Nine Phoenix King arrived, staring intently into the depths.</p><p>She didn't know the pool's origin, but she instinctively sensed danger, recognizing its connection to the valley's toxins.  However, she wasn't skilled in poison resistance. Previously, she had relied on the Dragon King's protection.</p><p>Even Nascent Soul cultivators wouldn't dare stay in such a Poison Pool for long. How long could a mere Core Formation cultivator last?</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King snorted, condensing a fiery protective shield around herself and jumping into the Poison Pool after Qin Sang.</p><p>‘Sizzle!’</p><p>As she entered the pool, the toxic water boiled, and her shield immediately began to burn fiercely.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King frowned. The poison was more potent than she had imagined.  She had to catch that man quickly!</p><p>Deep within the Poison Pool, Qin Sang was filled with anxiety. He didn't know how much longer the Fat Silkworm could hold out, and that madwoman was still relentlessly pursuing him.</p><p>Finally, he reached the bottom and spotted a large underground river. Ahead lay darkness, its destination unknown.</p><p>He entered the river, and the Nine Phoenix King followed without hesitation.</p><p>Not long after entering the underground river, something unexpected happened.</p><p>Qin Sang was checking on the Fat Silkworm, about to take out various tonics to help it recover, when he suddenly felt a tightening sensation. He had inadvertently fallen into a powerful undercurrent, his body pulled uncontrollably deeper into the river.</p><p>When he tried to circulate his true essence to stabilize himself and escape the current, he realized it wasn't an undercurrent at all, but a strange, immense suction force.</p><p>Even with his cultivation, he couldn't break free!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart sank.</p><p>The Poison Pool had been calm. Why was there this sudden, strange suction?</p><p>He struggled frantically, but it was useless. The force was too strong, like an invisible shackle, dragging him relentlessly forward.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King, following behind, was also caught in the suction-created current.</p><p>At first, she paid it no mind, but when she realized she couldn't break free either, her expression changed.</p><p>She didn't know where the river led or how deep it was.</p><p>This strange suction filled her with a sense of dread.</p><p>Moreover, trapped in the current, if she couldn't resist the poison, she would dissolve into nothing, her bones left behind to accompany Qin Sang in death.</p><p>She wanted to capture Qin Sang and seize his treasures, not throw her own life away.</p><p>The Nine Phoenix King made a swift decision and unleashed the full power of her Heavenly Phoenix True Feather.</p><p>The feather erupted, finally breaking free from the suction.</p><p>Without pausing, she swam upstream and out of the Poison Pool, only to find that the water level had dropped significantly in a short time and was still rapidly decreasing.</p><p>By the time she reached the shore, the Poison Pool had completely dried up!</p><p>This bizarre scene left the Nine Phoenix King bewildered. She didn't know if this was a normal occurrence for the Poison Pool.</p><p>She glanced at the dry bottom, her eyebrows furrowed. That小子, dragged down below, had almost no chance of survival. She had expended the power of her Heavenly Phoenix True Feather, only to come up empty-handed.</p><p>The suction grew stronger.</p><p>Without a treasure like the Heavenly Phoenix True Feather, Qin Sang and Bai struggled desperately but were powerless against the current. They were swept through a series of channels, dragged to an unknown destination.</p><p>Along the way, they repeatedly crashed against rocks and walls.  Fortunately, Qin Sang's physique was robust enough to endure.</p><p>The dire situation was this: the Fat Silkworm's colorful halos were fading, and it could no longer maintain its protective shell!</p>
