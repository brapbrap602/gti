<h1>Chapter 367: Entering the Valley</h1><p>After introducing both parties, the shopkeeper excused himself. "Fellow Daoist Kong is very familiar with the Boundless Valley. If you have any requests, feel free to ask him. I won't disturb you three any longer."</p><p>The three of them entered the wooden hut.</p><p>There was no one else inside.</p><p>Kong Xin didn't bother with small talk and asked directly, "Please have a seat, Fellow Daoists. Just now, Senior sent a message asking if I knew where the Golden Iris Grass grows. So, you two intend to enter the valley to gather it. Do you have any other objectives?"</p><p>Yun Youzi hummed in agreement and asked in return, "Fellow Daoist Kong, do you really know where the Golden Iris Grass grows?"</p><p>Kong Xin replied frankly, "Indeed, I do know of a place where it grows.</p><p>"However, I must warn you that it's not a safe place. It was already quite dangerous, but after the beast tide, a flock of Tiger-Winged Eagles appeared and made a nearby stone mountain their nest.</p><p>"Among these eagles, there are more than ten Spirit Severing stage Great Demons. They are very restless and territorial. What's more frightening is their demonic eyes, which can see through invisibility. Ordinary cultivators can hardly hide from their gaze.</p><p>"Gathering the Golden Iris Grass means facing the risk of being discovered by these eagles.</p><p>"I earn my living through hard work and don't want to risk my life. I can only lead you to a safe place in the heart of the Boundless Valley, and you'll have to proceed on your own from there. If you're unwilling, I won't force you.</p><p>"You can inquire around; other guides do the same."</p><p>Yun Youzi frowned. "It doesn't matter if you're unwilling to guide us all the way, but you should at least tell us about the terrain and how to get there."</p><p>Sun Xin nodded. "That's only fair."</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi were only using the Golden Iris Grass as an excuse and didn't care whether they could actually find it. After confirming that the location wasn't far from the second level, they agreed to join Sun Xin's group.</p><p>Sun Xin, having secured two more clients, couldn't help but smile.</p><p>Unfortunately, his face was abnormally pale, and the smile made it appear even more eerie.</p><p>"There are three other Fellow Daoists arriving tomorrow morning. You two might as well rest here and prepare yourselves. We'll depart tomorrow. Also, entering the Boundless Valley requires some auxiliary items. I'll give you a list; please prepare everything to avoid any setbacks."</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had no objections.</p><p>Sun Xin, having spent years in the Boundless Valley, was more familiar with the conditions inside than Yun Youzi. The items on the list were exceptionally detailed, with their uses clearly marked.</p><p>The total cost wasn't much, and they purchased everything to be prepared.</p><p>Just as they were about to return to the wooden hut, Yun Youzi suddenly transmitted his voice, "Brother Qin, what do you think of that Sun Xin?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, glancing at Yun Youzi. "What do you mean, Senior?"</p><p>"His complexion is abnormally pale; it must be due to his cultivation technique."</p><p>Yun Youzi pondered. "I don't sense any demonic or bloody aura from him. I can't tell what kind of technique he cultivates.  For it to have such a noticeable effect on his physical body, it's likely some kind of demonic art."</p><p>"This is the Boundless Valley; it's normal for Sun Xin to be a demonic cultivator. He seems clear-headed and without any bloody煞energy. Since Senior mentioned that the Heavenly Wind Pavilion has a good reputation, and its shopkeeper vouches for him, it means that he's at least not a reckless fiend on the surface..."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled his own Spirit Concealment Technique and thought for a moment. "It's also possible that he's disguising himself very well. We just need to keep an eye on his every move. If anything seems amiss, we'll strike first. We don't need to fear him."</p><p>Yun Youzi hummed in agreement. "You're right, Brother Qin. It's best if he guides us honestly and nothing happens. If he tries anything funny, we'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget!"</p><p>They waited another night in the market.</p><p>The next morning, everyone assembled.</p><p>Besides Qin Sang, Yun Youzi, and Sun Xin, there were four others: three men and one woman.</p><p>The first to arrive was the woman. She wore a red dress and a veil, obscuring her face, but she had an excellent figure and a cold demeanor.</p><p>The second was a refined middle-aged man who introduced himself as Bao upon meeting the group.</p><p>Both of them were Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>The last two were a master and disciple pair, an old man and a young man. The old man was at the early Foundation Establishment stage, while his disciple was only at the Qi Refining stage.</p><p>Except for Bao, the others showed no desire to get acquainted. They were simply brought together by Sun Xin and would part ways upon reaching their destination.</p><p>Sun Xin stood up. "Since all Fellow Daoists are here, let's depart."</p><p>The woman in red, who had been impatiently waiting, glared at the master and disciple pair and asked sharply, "Why is there a Qi Refining cultivator among us? What if his low cultivation invites trouble, and we have to clean up his mess?"</p><p>The disciple's face flushed red.</p><p>The old man placed a hand on his disciple's shoulder and said with a smile, "Rest assured, Fellow Daoist. We're only here to find a medicinal herb for an ailment. We don't intend to venture deep into the Boundless Valley and won't be a burden."</p><p>The woman in red snorted and said no more.</p><p>Relieved, Sun Xin urged them to set off.</p><p>The market wasn't far from the Boundless Valley. Riding their flying artifacts, they reached the edge of the valley within an hour.</p><p>A crimson wall stood before them. The blood mist was incredibly dense, rippling like flowing water.</p><p>Stopping before the blood mist, Qin Sang immediately smelled a pungent, bloody odor that made him slightly dizzy. The mist's toxicity was evident. He quickly circulated his spiritual energy to isolate it from his body.</p><p>Just as potent as the toxicity was the bone-chilling cold emanating from the mist.</p><p>The disciple's face, now almost as pale as Sun Xin's from the cold, shivered as he huddled close to his master.</p><p>Sun Xin glanced at the disciple and said, "Fellow Daoists, you can now take out your protective artifacts. Once we enter the blood mist, do not stop channeling energy into them."</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi both took out jade pendants and held them in their palms.</p><p>Upon channeling their spiritual energy, the Azure Sun Demonic Fire within the pendants surged out, quickly forming a layer of azure flame around them.</p><p>With a sizzling sound, the blood mist was burned away by the demonic fire, and the chill vanished.</p><p>Despite being a demonic fire, it possessed a righteous and pure aura, causing others to marvel.</p><p>This aura likely originated from the Azure Sun Divine罡.</p><p>The others also employed their own methods.</p><p>The woman in red unfurled a red cloth, which emitted a red glow enveloping her body.</p><p>Bao and the master-disciple pair also used artifacts containing the Azure Sun Demonic Fire, but their quality was inferior to Qin Sang's jade pendants.</p><p>Sun Xin's method was the most peculiar.</p><p>He held a longan-sized pill in his palm. The pill was crimson and burned with an unyielding flame, as if it would never extinguish.</p><p>A strong demonic aura emanated from the pill.</p>
