<h1>Chapter 2104: Preparing for War</h1><p>The Storm Realm, bordered by the Tainted Lands on one side and besieged by the Otherfolk on the others, had previously been trapped with no escape.  The news Qin Sang brought held immense significance for them. Even if they were defeated and perished, as long as their lineage survived, they would face their ancestors in the underworld without shame.</p><p>Naturally, another wave of gratitude swept through the crowd. Some began to contemplate which disciples to send. The sanctuary's capacity was limited, and each sect received only a few slots.  Whether to select those with the highest aptitude or those with proven experience required careful consideration.</p><p>Qin Sang observed their expressions, nodding inwardly.  Their gratitude seemed genuine.  Before, their attitude towards him had been primarily fear, but now, it was a mixture of awe and reverence.</p><p>“Once you have chosen your disciples, send them to Green Ram Temple. I will personally escort them to the sanctuary…”</p><p>Qin Sang did not disclose the sanctuary's location, which everyone understood.  If the situation became irredeemable, that place would be the Storm Realm's last hope.  The more concealed, the better.</p><p>Next, instead of discussing the cultivation methods and mystical arts that were uppermost in everyone's minds, Qin Sang turned to Yuan Zhu, Bao Zhengnan, and Elder Devil Fang. "The Zhangyou Tribe has withdrawn from the Demon Sea and the Boundless Sea. Which of you is willing to return?"</p><p>Someone asked in surprise, "Is it not too hasty to reclaim the Demon Sea and the Boundless Sea now?"</p><p>The Central Continent was vast enough that there was no immediate concern of overcrowding.  The three races fought amongst themselves for cultivation resources. Now, facing the threat of the Zhangyou Tribe, they should unite their forces. The Storm Realm needed to become a single fist, not disperse its strength.</p><p>“My strategy requires guardians for the Demon Sea and the Boundless Sea.  Moreover, occupying these territories will be advantageous for future contention over Azure Spirit Energy," Qin Sang explained, his gaze settling on Yuan Zhu.</p><p>Yuan Zhu knew that the Demon Sea's denizens had made a grave mistake. Aside from submitting to Qin Sang's will, they had no other choice.  Anyone else, even if they didn't annihilate the Demon Sea's妖族, would certainly scatter them, reducing all demon cultivators to mere demon soldiers to prevent a repeat of the past.</p><p>Qin Sang allowed them to retain their tribes and ancestral lands, continuing their lineage. Even the Jiao Dragon Clan, the primary instigators, were not exterminated, and the weaker members of the clan remained largely unaffected.</p><p>Yuan Zhu became the new patriarch of the Jiao Dragon Clan and the leader of the Demon Sea. Firstly, because few powerful figures remained in the Demon Sea, and secondly, because of Qin Sang's backing. He wasn't naive enough to believe that in such a crucial matter, a bit of past camaraderie from a millennium ago would allow him to bargain with Qin Sang. Qin Sang might give the Demon Sea a chance to redeem themselves, but there would be no second opportunity.</p><p>"My clan is willing to guard the Demon Sea for Grandmaster," Yuan Zhu rose and declared, cupping his hands.</p><p>Everyone looked at Yuan Zhu, their expressions varied.  This turmoil was largely due to the Demon Sea's attempt to go it alone and reclaim their ancestral lands. They could return now, but not in the way they had envisioned.  Yuan Zhu's words signified their complete submission.  The Demon Sea now belonged to Qin Sang, not to the demon race.</p><p>And perhaps, not just the Demon Sea!  Some wore thoughtful expressions. Before Qin Sang's return, the Storm Realm had never seen a single individual's will reign supreme.  Even Fairy Liu Li, in her time, had sought the support of various races and sects, balancing the interests of all parties.  They realized now that they needed to carefully consider how to handle their future relationship with Green Ram Temple.</p><p>"Our Four Saints Palace is willing to guard the Boundless Sea," Bao Zhengnan declared, his voice resounding, interrupting their thoughts.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. He wouldn't remain here forever and needed to plan for the long term. The Demon Sea and the Boundless Sea were remote.  He needed someone to keep watch over the demon race, and the Four Saints Palace was the perfect choice.  In the future, Green Ram Temple would establish a branch there, and with the Four Saints Palace's assistance, the demon race wouldn't be able to cause any trouble.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to Elder Devil Fang, who was leaning back in his chair, his cicada wings trembling slightly. "Our sacred mountain has already been moved to the Central Continent. Aside from the sacred mountain, there is nothing else we yearn for. Moreover, our clan is inherently weak.  Establishing our current territory has nearly exhausted our resources. We are unable to support another migration. We beseech Grandmaster to permit us to remain in the Central Continent."</p><p>For the Wu Clan, returning to the Boundless Sea would only place them between the humans and the demons.  They were better off in the Central Continent.  Although under the watchful eyes of the humans, their every move scrutinized, the Central Continent was vast, and they would be more at ease. Elder Devil Fang only wished for the Wu Clan to recuperate and had no other ambitions. Being watched by the humans was of no concern.</p><p>With the situation of the Demon Sea and the Boundless Sea settled, Qin Sang turned to the patriarchs of the Eastern Sea clans.</p><p>"Black Lion," Qin Sang called.</p><p>"This humble demon is here. Please instruct me, Grandmaster," Black Lion said with a fawning expression.</p><p>"Dragon Whale and his followers have been demoted to demon soldiers, but there are still several factions remaining. I task you with integrating them."</p><p>"This humble one obeys!" Black Lion was overjoyed. This clearly meant he was to replace Dragon Whale and become the king of the Eastern Sea.</p><p>Furthermore, the Triad Alliance of the Central Continent had dissolved. Qin Sang didn't interfere much. As long as no new "Triad Alliance" emerged, he was happy to see the various sects and schools compete amongst themselves.</p><p>The Western Lands and the Northern Sea remained largely unchanged.</p><p>Thus, the Storm Realm's structure generally aligned with Qin Sang's vision.  In the future, with altars spread throughout the land and Green Ram Temple branches established in each region, the rudimentary form of his envisioned Daoist domain would take shape.</p><p>With the Storm Realm's structure settled, Qin Sang finally addressed the main issue. He retrieved a jade slip, his divine sense activating its contents, displaying them for all to see.  This was the method for constructing altars. In the future, each race and sect could construct altars according to this method, but they would only be branch altars.  The core of the Thunder Altar remained firmly in Qin Sang's control. Even if it fell into enemy hands, these methods alone would not reveal the Thunder Altar's complete secrets.</p><p>"During my travels through the Great Thousand Worlds, I acquired this altar formation method and witnessed its power firsthand.  To this day, I still find it awe-inspiring.  By following this method to construct altars and activating them together, you can assist me in deterring external enemies and protecting the entire Storm Realm!"</p><p>To prevent leaks, Qin Sang didn't elaborate on the altar's full capabilities.  They only needed to obey his instructions.  Even so, from the altar construction method, they could sense that these altars were extraordinary.  Once altars were spread throughout the Storm Realm, they would undoubtedly possess astonishing power.</p><p>Their concern was that the spiritual materials required for altar construction were too precious. Smaller sects simply couldn't afford them, especially since some were completely unknown to them.</p><p>"Do not worry. I have prepared all the rare and precious spiritual materials before coming here. However, Green Ram Temple lacks manpower, and I have other matters to attend to.  I require your assistance in constructing the altars and assigning guardians. Each altar is crucial and must be strategically located as instructed. Do not take this lightly."</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Li Yufu and others distributed the spiritual materials, issuing warnings along the way.</p><p>Upon receiving the materials, everyone's doubts were dispelled.</p><p>Next, they discussed a few more matters before Qin Sang dismissed them.</p><p>The dreadful day was finally over!</p><p>Stepping out of the hall, everyone felt a sense of relief.</p><p>Elder Devil Fang was about to fly out of the hall when Qin Sang called out to him.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Fang, wait."</p><p>Elder Devil Fang was taken aback, unsure why Qin Sang had singled him out.  Reflecting that the Wu Clan hadn't done anything wrong, he calmed himself and waited for the others to leave before asking, "May I ask what important matter Grandmaster has for me?"</p><p>"Are you not curious about the Wu Clan of the Great Thousand Worlds?" Qin Sang asked with a smile.</p><p>Elder Devil Fang was naturally curious, but for various reasons, he had refrained from asking Qin Sang. Now that Qin Sang had brought it up, he no longer needed to hesitate. "Has Grandmaster visited the Wu Clan's territory?  What is their situation?"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly. "I intended to travel to the Wu Clan's territory, but unfortunately, the Wu Clan and the human race are not on good terms. They were enemies in ancient times and engaged in great wars, the impact of which lingers to this day."</p><p>"Enemies…"</p><p>Elder Devil Fang fell silent, sighing inwardly.  He had long suspected that since the three races fought so fiercely in the small Storm Realm, peace in the Great Thousand Worlds was unlikely.</p><p>His voice heavy, he asked, "How does Grandmaster intend to deal with my clan?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled. "Fellow Daoist Fang, you misunderstand. The grudges and enmities of the Great Thousand Worlds have nothing to do with us.  To be frank, once the situation in the Storm Realm stabilizes, I intend to visit the Wu Clan. I plan to bring a few Wu Clan fellow Daoists, disguised as clansmen scattered from outside. However…"</p><p>Learning of the potential return to his ancestral clan, Elder Devil Fang was initially overjoyed, but Qin Sang's change in tone indicated that things wouldn't be so simple. He listened attentively.</p><p>"The Storm Realm holds too many secrets.  As a precaution, I need individuals who know only of your Wu Clan, not of the Storm Realm, and are completely ignorant of all its secrets," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Elder Devil Fang immediately guessed the reason and tentatively asked, "Does this relate to those Immortal Palaces that ascended to the Upper Realm?"</p><p>Qin Sang neither confirmed nor denied.</p><p>"I understand," Elder Devil Fang wisely refrained from further questions.  "I will carefully select a group of infants and personally instruct them before entrusting them to Grandmaster."</p><p>"There is no rush. The turmoil will not subside overnight.  I will make thorough preparations before setting out," Qin Sang said.</p><p>Elder Devil Fang let out a bitter laugh. "Unfortunately, I cannot wait that long."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, scrutinizing Elder Devil Fang. "Fellow Daoist Fang, you…"</p><p>"I fused my soul with the body of a Spiritual Cicada, defying the Heavenly Dao. My soul and body are incompatible. I've tried everything, but I cannot truly reconcile them.  Reaching the Nascent Soul stage was already a stroke of luck, and the price I paid was my lifespan. I have less than fifty years remaining. With my talent, it is impossible to break through to the Soul Formation stage in such a short time.  However, I have no regrets dying after witnessing Grandmaster's return.  From now on, the Wu Clan will follow Grandmaster's lead without question. I only hope Grandmaster will look after them."</p><p>These words were heartfelt, a rarity from Elder Devil Fang.</p><p>Qin Sang was helpless in this matter.  Elder Devil Fang's issue wasn't simply a lack of vital energy. It would require someone capable of defying fate.</p><p>Elder Devil Fang seemed to accept his fate calmly, discussing his views on life and death with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't agree with some of his viewpoints, but there was no need to argue.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang asked, "I haven't inquired before. Are there clan distinctions within your Wu Clan?"</p><p>"Ancient records mention that the ancient Wu Clan was indeed divided into different clans, each with its own unique heritage. To maintain bloodline purity, intermarriage between different clans was restricted. But we have long since become a tangled mess…"</p><p>Elder Devil Fang sighed. "Our heritage has been severed.  Since recorded history began, our clan's cultivation has been based on human cultivation methods, and our customs have become similar to those of humans. Apart from retaining the position of Grand Witch Doctor, we only have sect distinctions. The concept of clans has long since vanished."</p><p>Elder Devil Fang's account generally aligned with Qin Sang's understanding of Wu Clan history.  Although the Boundless Sea and the Demon Sea were adjacent, the demon race had their ancestral lands, while the Wu Clan had lost their heritage from the very beginning and ultimately fell under the dominance of the human race.</p><p>What exactly transpired between the three races in the Storm Realm during ancient times remained shrouded in mystery.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, have you ever heard of the Hao Bo Clan?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Elder Devil Fang pondered for a moment. "Never."</p><p>"The Hao Bo Clan was a major clan of the ancient Wu Clan. I once stumbled upon an ancient ruin left by the Hao Bo Clan and gained some insights, although I haven't had time to organize them.  When I have time, I will send someone to your residence with the Hao Bo Clan's legacy.  You can try cultivating it and claim to be descendants of the Hao Bo Clan…"</p><p>Qin Sang, possessing the Small Cave Heaven, had practically emptied that ruin. Although he didn't obtain the complete Hao Bo Clan heritage, it was enough for them to study for a long time.  Once the Wu Clan achieved a certain level of accomplishment, Qin Sang would arrange for them to cultivate sacrificial insects.</p><p>Elder Devil Fang was overjoyed. "On behalf of the entire clan, I thank Grandmaster. This kindness will never be forgotten!"</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand dismissively.  He didn't believe any gratitude could withstand the erosion of time. As long as the Wu Clan obeyed and proved useful to him, that was enough.</p><p>After a stick of incense, Elder Devil Fang took his leave, leaving Qin Sang alone in the hall.</p><p>He pondered for a moment before flying out of the hall and heading towards the northern part of Green Ram Temple.</p><p>The mountains here had been moved, creating a vast plain and lake.  Demonic Qi filled the air as demon soldiers were escorted to this location.</p><p>The demon soldiers were led by Dragon Whale and Phoenix King, commanding the beasts and aquatic creatures respectively.</p><p>However, Qin Sang knew they harbored resentment, so the true commanders were the two Demon Marquises.</p><p>"Greetings, Grandmaster!"</p><p>Marquis Gui and Marquis Luo hurried forward to greet Qin Sang upon his arrival.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his gaze sweeping over the assembled demon soldiers.  Including the two Demon Marquises, they represented a considerable force.</p><p>But for a Soul Formation mid-stage Five Thunders Institute Emissary, they were still too weak. A cultivator specializing in the Warbeast Altar from a righteous Daoist lineage, if they had advanced normally, would now have at least a Soul Formation early-stage Demon General under their command, along with countless demon soldiers.</p><p>This was the terrifying aspect of Warbeast Altar cultivators.  Of course, nurturing so many demon soldiers was extremely challenging for them.</p><p>"Continue training. Do not teach them the 'Celestial Demon Refining Form' yet," Qin Sang instructed.</p><p>The Dharma should not be imparted lightly.</p><p>These demon soldiers were subdued, not truly subservient. Even if they didn't dare to openly rebel, their passive resistance on the battlefield could hinder progress.  There would be rewards and punishments within the ranks of demon soldiers in the future. Marquis Gui and Marquis Luo were both experienced in this, so Qin Sang didn't need to worry.</p><p>At this time, the observers hadn't left yet. Not daring to disturb Qin Sang, they visited Li Yufu and the others, keeping Green Ram Temple brightly lit and bustling with activity.</p><p>Qin Sang admonished the demon soldiers and ordered the two Demon Marquises to lead them to the Boundless Sea and the Demon Sea to assist Bao Zhengnan and Yuan Zhu in constructing altars.</p><p>Afterwards, he soared into the sky, entering Deer Wilds and arriving before Si Lu's cave dwelling.</p><p>The cave dwelling's entrance opened.</p><p>Si Lu personally came out to greet him, glancing down below and asking, "Has Brother Qin made all the arrangements? When shall we contact the Zhu Yan Clan?" (End of Chapter)</p>
