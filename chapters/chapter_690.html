<h1>Chapter 682: Hunting the Sea Serpent</h1><p>Chapter 682: Hunting the Sea Serpent</p><p>The elderly couple warned that danger lurked everywhere beyond Duyan Island.</p><p>Deep in the Demon Sea, besides the ever-present threat of demonic beasts, one must also beware of other unknown cultivators.  In this chaotic place, anyone could turn into a murderous fiend, seizing treasures without hesitation.</p><p>The elderly couple had spent decades in the Demon Sea and had narrowly avoided such dangers more than once, relying on their vigilance.</p><p>They had assembled this hunting party of five, a team forged through numerous trials, their mutual trust carefully built over time.</p><p>The couple was frank with Qin Sang, admitting that they wouldn't normally accept a stranger at the Golden Core stage for hire.  However, due to the guarantee from the Qiongyu Trading Company and Ran Luo, and the extremely generous compensation offered by Qin Sang and the company, they agreed to the task.</p><p>Days of travel led them further from Duyan Island.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed that once they left the patrol area of Duyan Island's cultivators, everyone grew noticeably more cautious.</p><p>Later, when encountering other cultivators, they would spot each other from a great distance. Without knowing each other's strength, they would tacitly avoid any contact, maintaining a peaceful distance.  This seemed to be an unspoken rule in the Demon Sea.</p><p>The elderly couple's familiarity with this region proved invaluable; their chosen route avoided powerful demonic beasts. Their journey was smooth, and after ten days, they finally reached their destination.</p><p>“The trench is ahead.”</p><p>The group landed on a deserted island, carefully concealing themselves. The old man pointed towards the sea, addressing Qin Sang.</p><p>Perhaps it was just his imagination, but Qin Sang felt the sea's color was deeper in that area, the seabed concealing untold dangers.</p><p>“Daoist Master, we previously discovered a peak-level Spirit Transformation Stage blue serpent's lair three days east from here. It should still be there. Should we head there now?”</p><p>The old woman quietly asked Qin Sang for his opinion.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the old woman. “Since you knew the serpent’s lair’s location for a long time, why haven't you hunted it? With the five of you, killing a peak Spirit Transformation Stage blue serpent shouldn't be difficult, should it?”</p><p>The old woman replied, “Normally, hunting this serpent wouldn't be hard.  But first, there's more than one serpent in the lair. The others aren't as powerful, but they're still formidable. Second, the Demon Sea is teeming with demonic beasts, especially in the deeper parts of the trench. If we can't kill the serpent quickly and retreat, we risk attracting others.  A siege would leave us little chance of survival.  Even for us five, we haven’t hunted many peak Spirit Transformation Stage great demons. We only dare to act after making thorough preparations.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “Since it's so dangerous, I can't be careless.  We should have someone on lookout, monitoring the surrounding waters during the hunt. Who among you is skilled in detection?”</p><p>The elderly couple exchanged glances.</p><p>The old man said, “Daoist Master, my wife and Miss Wang possess various techniques to detect demonic beast movements in advance.”</p><p>“Very well,” Qin Sang nodded. “Once we encounter the serpent group, let them two stand guard. The three of you will come with me to hunt the serpent. I'll deal with the peak Spirit Transformation Stage blue serpent; you will take care of the others.  Afterward, we'll divide the spoils as agreed.  Except for the main serpent, the others are yours.”</p><p>The five showed delighted expressions and immediately agreed.</p><p>With Qin Sang taking care of the leader, the other serpents would be much easier to deal with. The value of the serpent’s body was immense—a significant windfall for them.</p><p>After agreeing on the plan, they set off immediately.</p><p>Entering the trench, Qin Sang discarded his relaxed demeanor. He actively expanded his spiritual sense, exploring the surrounding waters.</p><p>On the evening of the third day, six figures appeared in a desolate expanse of ocean. The water here was unusually calm, showing no signs of serpent activity.</p><p>“This is the place. Every full moon, these serpents leave the trench, gathering in groups to wreak havoc. That's the best time to hunt them,”</p><p>the old man whispered, then led the group in a curve to a small reef for concealment.</p><p>Qin Sang calculated that the full moon would be in two days, so they had to wait patiently.</p><p>Before they knew it, two days had passed.</p><p>As night fell, a bright moon hung in the sky, its light like silver, its ethereal glow as gentle as water.</p><p>The moon, reflected in the water, swayed gently with the waves.  The full moon shone, yet the sea remained remarkably calm.  Six figures on the islet held their breath, their eyes wide, watching the surface intently for the slightest change.</p><p>As night deepened and the moon climbed high, there was still no sign of the dragons.  Then, the elder suddenly whispered,</p><p>"They're here!"</p><p>Qin Sang followed the elder's gaze.  A faint mist had risen near the edge of the water, initially mistaken for sea spray. Such occurrences were common on the vast ocean, but this felt different.</p><p>"These blue dragons always create mist to conceal themselves…"</p><p>As the elder's voice echoed in her ears, Qin Sang saw the mist begin to drift across the water, growing larger and larger, until a wide area was shrouded in its ethereal veil.  Within the mist, long, slender shapes flickered in and out of view.</p><p>The dragons had arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly slipped away from the islet, approaching the mist until she was a safe distance away. The blue dragons, completely unaware of the approaching danger, playfully frolicked within the mist.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang confirmed her intelligence: the most powerful among them was only at the peak of the Yao Ling stage.  She decided to strike.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Her ebony sword shot from her forehead, its energy surging.  Without pause, a dazzling sword beam slashed down into the heart of the mist.</p><p>The five remaining figures on the islet immediately flew towards the action.</p><p>"Two of you, guard the flanks. The rest, come with me to hunt the dragons!"</p><p>The elder quickly assigned roles.  Before his words had even finished, Qin Sang, sword in hand, charged into the mist. The roars of the enraged dragons filled the air.</p><p>"Quickly!"</p><p>The elder urged, using all his strength to rush into the mist.  The three remaining hunters followed, their individual skills on full display.  Inside, the blue dragons were in disarray. They quickly formed a battle line to fight back, only to see a figure standing in the air, a gigantic hand of true energy gripping a blue dragon.  The dragon was bleeding profusely, near death, utterly helpless in the giant hand's grasp.</p>
