<h1>Chapter 1747: The White Dragon Lord</h1><p>Waves crashed against the reefs, spraying white foam.</p><p>A thousand-foot-high cliff stood like a wall, barring the sea, preventing even the strongest waves from passing.</p><p>"A treacherous place…"</p><p>Qin Sang reached the clifftop, gazing ahead, muttering to himself.</p><p>He had crossed the sea, easily finding the landmass that Tian Mudie had seen.</p><p>The view from afar was vastly different from up close.</p><p>From this height, countless towering mountains stretched to the horizon, their peaks jagged and shrouded in mist. The terrain was as perilous as the southernmost provinces of Zhongzhou.</p><p>"There must be numerous spirits and monsters here, unsuitable for ordinary humans. I wonder if the inhabitants of this realm are as weak as those in the Storm Realm…"</p><p>Unsure of what lay ahead, Qin Sang deliberately suppressed his aura.  His true energy was suppressed, making it inconvenient to use his spiritual sense. He woke Tian Mudie to observe the mountain's atmosphere.</p><p>Most monsters, before gaining sentience, lack the innate ability to conceal their presence.  Among monsters, strength is paramount; they not only don't hide, but the stronger they are, the more they flaunt it.</p><p>One can discern a lot from observing the clouds in the mountains.</p><p>However, what he saw surprised Qin Sang.</p><p>Although the mountains were shrouded in mist, it was merely condensation, and the air was surprisingly clear.</p><p>On the island where he lived for over ten years, hundreds of spirits dwelled in a single forest. Here, almost no demonic energy was present. The difference between the two places was astonishing.</p><p>This could only mean either a powerful monster held sway, driving away all others, or a demon slayer had purged the mountains.</p><p>Tian Mudie, with her exceptional eyesight, could see far into the distance.  The mountains stretched endlessly in every direction.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger on the clifftop. He leaped down, descending like a tiger, silently moving through the forest.</p><p>He moved at incredible speed, traversing the deep mountain forests without a sound, his figure like a phantom, his aura even fainter than before, relying solely on his physical body.</p><p>Tian Mudie perched on his left shoulder, vigilant. This caution was to prevent encountering powerful monsters.</p><p>After crossing dozens of mountain ranges, he still saw no monsters or signs of human habitation.  An eerie stillness pervaded the mountains, causing Qin Sang to frown slightly. He stopped at a mountaintop, sniffing the air, then focused on the left front, his eyes narrowing.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Qin Sang subtly altered his course, heading straight towards that spot. He slowed down as he approached, forming a hand seal, his blood energy surging slightly, his skin gleaming with a faint golden light.</p><p>This was the sixth seal of the Seven Buddhas Seal, the Golden Armor Heavenly Vestiment Seal, a powerful defensive technique.</p><p>Having entered the mid-stage of the fourth layer of *Tian Yao Lian Xing*, Qin Sang gradually mastered this seal.</p><p>He hadn't yet fully grasped the seventh seal, the Vajra Great Freedom Seal, due to his recent breakthrough.</p><p>With this seal active, his figure became noticeably more imposing. He moved forward, soon discovering two boulders facing each other, leaving a narrow passage between them, which seemed to lead to a larger space.</p><p>He leaped into the crevice, quickly moving forward.  He found himself in a valley.</p><p>This valley was nestled between three mountains, their curved walls naturally forming an elliptical sinkhole. A stream flowed from the peaks, creating a pool.</p><p>Seeing the bottom of the sinkhole, Qin Sang's pupils constricted.</p><p>The sinkhole was filled with countless corpses. The water was polluted, the bones piled high in layers, the lower ones soaked in foul water, the upper ones exposed to the sun, revealing ghastly white bone fragments.</p><p>It was clearly a sacrificial site!</p><p>The sinkhole was deathly silent. Under the high sun, it was inexplicably icy cold.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned a bone fragment, examining it, murmuring, "Demonic bone!"</p><p>All the bones in the sinkhole belonged to various monsters!</p><p>However, these bones were useless for refining treasures; their essence had been completely drained.  Many corpses had been disemboweled, their internal organs missing.</p><p>Qin Sang finally understood why there were no monsters around: they had all been slaughtered.</p><p>Only the bodies of demonic beasts remained.  The spirits of the plant demons were devoured, leaving them indistinguishable from ordinary withered plants; there was no need to dispose of them here.</p><p>This wasn't the work of demon hunters; it looked more like inter-demon predation. The perpetrator was quite intelligent.</p><p>Qin Sang discarded the bones, leaped out of the sinkhole, and headed towards the interior. He didn't find any other demonic beasts along the way.</p><p>Continuing onward, after crossing countless mountain ranges, the terrain finally began to level off. After traveling for a while longer, Qin Sang ascended to a high point to survey the area.  His expression shifted slightly as his gaze fell upon the right side, where he seemed to see houses and pavilions.</p><p>He immediately changed course, speeding towards them. He confirmed it was indeed a city.</p><p>Midway there, Qin Sang encountered the people of this world for the first time.</p><p>An old man and a young boy were walking in the mountains.  They were ordinary people, with limbs, features, and orifices identical to those of the human race in the Storm World.</p><p>The elder had a long beard, walked with a firm gait, and possessed a vigorous spirit.</p><p>The boy, around twelve or thirteen years old, followed behind, carrying a satchel. He recited some scriptures, occasionally asking the elder questions.</p><p>Qin Sang listened for a while, then sent out a wisp of his spiritual sense to examine the contents of the boy's satchel. After reading several books, a surprised look crossed his face.</p><p>The writing of this world was surprisingly consistent with that of the Storm World. He could understand the content of the books without resorting to any spells!</p><p>This was quite unexpected.  It made sense that different regions within the Storm World, being part of the same realm, used the same script. But these different small worlds... could they all originate from the same lineage?</p><p>Qin Sang descended from the clouds, transforming into the appearance of a wandering Taoist priest, and emerged from the forest.</p><p>The old man and boy were startled. The old man immediately shielded the boy behind him.</p><p>"Greetings, old sir,"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, imitating their tone.</p><p>Seeing a Taoist priest, the old man's apprehension dissipated. He hurriedly returned the greeting, repeatedly saying he didn't dare to be disrespectful.</p><p>*Do Taoist priests hold high status here?* Qin Sang mused, then continued, "This humble priest is traveling here and unfortunately lost my way in the mountains.  I'm relieved to have finally encountered people.  I would be grateful if you could tell me the name of this place."</p><p>Hearing that he was a wandering Taoist priest, the elder became even more respectful. "Honorable Daoist, a ferry crossing is about ten miles ahead. A short boat ride will take you to White Dragon Ferry.  From there, you can follow the river down to Floating Dragon City..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, pondering that while these two were sturdier than the ordinary people of the Storm World, they were no match for demonic beasts.  Their ability to survive here must mean the city had cultivator protection.</p><p>He thought for a moment and asked, "Where are you two headed? Might I accompany you?"</p><p>"Honorable Daoist," the elder replied meekly, not daring to refuse Qin Sang's request, "My relative in White Dragon Ferry passed away, and we are going to attend the funeral…"</p><p>The three walked along the dirt road. The elder was restrained in his manner, while the boy was full of curiosity. The elder hesitated, ultimately unable to scold the boy in front of Qin Sang. His face was filled with worry, fearing the boy might say something inappropriate and offend the Daoist priest.</p><p>Qin Sang used a minor spell to put them at ease, and they revealed everything they knew.</p><p>Through their conversation, he learned that this land was called the Nine Dragon Kingdom, with most places having "Dragon" in their name, and the city ahead was called Floating Dragon City.</p><p>As he had suspected, Taoist priests held a high status in Nine Dragon Kingdom, receiving royal patronage and great respect, even for wandering priests.</p><p>The elder mentioned that this was the case in several neighboring countries as well. Taoist priests could travel freely between countries without needing permits; officials would even come to greet them personally.</p><p>As they spoke, the ferry came into view.</p><p>"Old sir, you live outside the city. Aren't you afraid of the mountain demons?" Qin Sang asked the elder.</p><p>The creatures, plants, and trees in this world easily cultivated spiritual power; even ordinary people would frequently encounter them.</p><p>Before the elder could answer, the boy chirped, "The City God and the White Dragon Lord protect us! Demons don't dare to cross the line!"</p><p>The boy's face was filled with reverence as he spoke of the City God and the White Dragon Lord.</p><p>Qin Sang also learned that the City God referred to a deity enshrined in a City God temple in Floating Dragon City. The White Dragon Lord was the river god of the river before them.</p><p>Nine Dragon Kingdom revered Taoism and the gods. This was true throughout the entire nation. Floating Dragon City held annual ceremonies honoring the City God and the River God; even the villagers living outside the city participated annually.  There were even imperial decrees mandating worship, punishing non-compliance severely.</p><p>Such situations were not uncommon in the mortal world of the Storm World.</p><p>However, deities were often false, mostly used for enriching oneself. Even if a deity truly protected a region, it was usually a cultivator disguising themselves as one.</p><p>Although Nine Dragon Kingdom revered gods, the good thing was that the ceremonies were led by the government, and the people did not need to offer expensive tributes.  Therefore, the worship was sincere.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, *The deities may not be real, but there must be something that deters demons and protects the land.  Their reverence for the gods isn't entirely unfounded.*</p><p>Two individuals, despite having heard tales of divine miracles, lacked firsthand experience.  Qin Sang was unable to determine the origins of the City God and the White Dragon Lord.</p><p>At this point, the elder stroked the boy's head, adding, "As long as you stay out of the deep mountains, there's nothing to fear.  We villagers have never seen a monster dare enter the village, but it's a different story in the mountains.  Many herbalists and woodcutters have mysteriously disappeared there. Our village is not far from the mountains, and sometimes we're awakened by strange sounds from the mountains in our sleep. Lately, though, it's been much quieter. It must be the City God and White Dragon Lord sending divine soldiers on another expedition..."</p><p>Could divine soldiers truly be so brutal as to devour a monster's innards and vital essence?</p><p>They had reached the ferry.</p><p>A covered boat was moored at the wooden dock. Several villagers were already aboard, and the ferryman was about to push off when he saw more arriving. He hastily urged them to hurry.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's Taoist robes, the villagers showed reverence, making room for him. The ferryman, equally respectful, refused payment.</p><p>The small boat drifted downriver.</p><p>Ignoring the others, Qin Sang contemplated his next move. He'd envisioned various scenarios, even suspecting this might be a demonic realm, devoid of humans.  He never anticipated this.</p><p>Where there are humans, there must be cultivators, and therefore solutions!</p><p>"Let's go into the city and see who the White Dragon Lord and the City God really are."</p><p>As he thought this, the boat rounded a bend, revealing a straight stretch of river with White Dragon Ferry at its end.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to rise and examine the view from the bow, the celestial butterfly hidden on his shoulder fluttered its wings.</p><p>His eyes flickered. Casually glancing at a solitary peak on the riverbank and then at White Dragon Ferry, he remained seated.</p><p>The river was calm, and the boat swift.  They soon reached White Dragon Ferry.</p><p>Qin Sang acted like an ordinary person, disembarking with the old man and boy.</p><p>Amidst the ferry's clamor, the sound of gongs and drums approached. A procession was coming.</p><p>Leading the procession was a Taoist priest in a light yellow robe, carrying a ghost-binding staff in one hand and a golden bell in the other.</p><p>Behind him, people were arranged in two lines.  Those in front carried offerings and soul-calling banners; further back were official rank insignia, followed by two men carrying large gongs, and then a band of musicians.</p><p>Behind the musicians, men carried a black-topped soul-returning palanquin, accompanied by paper lanterns, incense burners, and flower stands, each with matching embroidered parasols—a vibrant spectacle.</p><p>Behind them was a coffin, carried by thirty-two pallbearers, followed by a long line of mourners in white, with even more paper effigies than mourners.</p><p>The Taoist priest, chanting rhythmically, walked with measured steps, his head bobbing. To outsiders, it looked rather like a shamanistic dance.</p><p>Gongs, drums, and bells played in unison as the procession moved towards the river.</p><p>Seeing the procession, the old man sighed, "Why are they so early today?"</p><p>He grabbed the boy, about to approach.</p><p>Qin Sang, after a keen look at the coffin, stopped them. "I wish to buy some food to thank you for your help. Please don't refuse."</p><p>The old man and boy, normally eager to attend the funeral, seemed strangely diverted, following Qin Sang into a tavern.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered food.</p><p>Oblivious to their purpose, the pair devoured the meal.</p><p>Qin Sang, sipping his wine, watched through the window as the procession continued along the riverbank to a stone shrine.</p><p>The shrine was only half a person's height, containing no deity, only a spirit tablet – presumably that of the White Dragon Lord.</p><p>The Taoist priest instructed the placing of incense and offerings, setting the soul-calling banner before it. He then performed a ritual, chanting incantations.</p><p>The gongs and drums fell silent, and the mourners ceased their weeping. Only the sound of bells echoed over the river.</p><p>Qin Sang understood the chant—a repentance ritual for the deceased, seeking the White Dragon Lord's presence and intercession.</p><p>The priest's ritual was flawless, enough to deceive ordinary people.</p><p>Yet, after a long time, Qin Sang felt no disturbance in the river or the shrine.</p><p>Suddenly, a commotion erupted within the procession.</p><p>The Taoist priest, turning, frowned. Before he could scold, a knocking sound began.</p><p>"Crack!"</p><p>A nail flew from the coffin lid.</p><p>The priest's face paled. He fled, the others screaming in terror, "A corpse! It's rising!"</p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>The coffin exploded.</p><p>Wood splintered, a dark figure lunged toward the nearest person. It appeared human but with green hair covering its face.</p><p>Uproar filled White Dragon Ferry.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand holding his wine cup paused. His gaze, previously focused on the opposite shore and a patch of grass beyond White Dragon Ferry, shifted to the shrine's spirit tablet.</p><p>(End)</p>
