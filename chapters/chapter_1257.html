<h1>Chapter 1249: Impartial Dao</h1><p>Let's not dwell on how Ye Laomo and the others broke in.</p><p>Qin Sang met up with Si Di.  After following Si Di a short distance to the left, they encountered someone else—the Yuan Ying cultivator from the demonic path who had originally taken him to the Zhǐtiān Peak to refine stellar energy, along with Qing Jun and Jiu Gu.</p><p>This person was a trusted confidant of Tōng Yōu Mojun, known as Zang Qing, a name that hardly sounds like a demonic cultivator.</p><p>Rumor has it he wielded a pair of Wu hooks with unparalleled skill.</p><p>When Qin Sang had gone to Zhǐtiān Peak, Zang Qing hadn't made things difficult for him, so Qin Sang had a good impression of him.</p><p>It turned out that although the Blood Soul attack scattered Qing Jun and the others, they weren't entirely defenseless. To avoid anyone being isolated and endangered, they dispersed in pairs or small groups, trying to stay together.</p><p>Si Di and Zang Qing were closest to each other, and escaped in the same direction.</p><p>The Blood Souls were too troublesome; to completely shake them off, they split up again. Si Di was on his way to rejoin Zang Qing when he ran into Qin Sang.</p><p>In Xiaohan Domain, conflicts between righteous and demonic cultivators were frequent, but in recent years, they'd united against Zuìyuān, greatly easing their previous tensions.  They were much more united than before—a blessing in disguise.</p><p>The three quickened their pace to meet up with the others.</p><p>“I was delayed by an unexpected incident,” Qin Sang said as they walked.  “I only learned that everyone had already left after seeing the note on the mountaintop. I imagine the others have almost all arrived by now…”</p><p>Zang Qing shook his head.  “Dongyang Bo hasn't arrived yet.  Tōng Yōu intended to wait a little longer for him, but then discovered an unusual occurrence and had to leave immediately.”</p><p>“Dongyang Bo?” Qin Sang feigned surprise.  “He hasn't joined up with us yet?”</p><p>He mused inwardly.</p><p>Dongyang Bo had only suffered a temporary setback; he couldn't be so afraid that he wouldn't dare show his face.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang was arrogant, he wouldn't dare attack in front of Qing Jun, Tōng Yōu Mojun, and the others.</p><p>Although Dongyang Bo's plot against Gongliang Yu was despicable, and Qin Sang had witnessed it, the Yuan Ying talisman puppet was now in Qin Sang's hands. If they argued, it would be hard to say who was right.</p><p>Unless Qin Sang could resist the temptation of a Yuan Ying-level puppet and publicly return it to the Shangyuan Qingjing Palace, the best choice was to remain silent.</p><p>When Dongyang Bo escaped, he split into eight seemingly real figures, even deceiving the Tianmu butterflies.  It was unclear what secret technique or treasure he'd used.  Could it be that he had to pay a significant price and needed to find a place to recuperate, neglecting this matter?</p><p>That was good news.</p><p>Qin Sang had been worried about Dongyang Bo's supernatural ability.</p><p>Now it seemed that it came at a great cost, meaning Dongyang Bo shouldn't be able to use it freely.</p><p>Si Di snorted. “We didn't see that old ghost before we were scattered by the Blood Souls.  Although there are forbidden areas everywhere, with Dongyang Bo's cultivation, he shouldn't be delayed this long. Unless he forgot about the important matter, or he knew something and deliberately entered a forbidden area, and was trapped there.”</p><p>Zang Qing smiled, “That's only human nature.  More than just Dongyang Bo would have such thoughts. Even if there was a small mishap, it couldn't hold him for long. Perhaps he's already arrived.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled in agreement, but his mind was racing.</p><p>Blood Souls roamed the path, all of which were slain by them.</p><p>After walking an unknown distance, they finally reached the meeting point.</p><p>“Mingyue is here!”</p><p>As Qin Sang walked behind Zang Qing and Si Di, he appeared and heard Tōng Yōu Mojun's voice, full of surprise.  The others also looked pleased.</p><p>He bowed, glancing around. He saw his senior sister, Chong Yi, Xiang Qing, and the others, but Dongyang Bo was missing. He guessed why they were so happy to see him.</p><p>"If I hadn't mastered escape techniques, I would have almost lost my life at the hands of Ye Laomo," Qin Sang casually said, "I would have repaid him for his actions...fortunately, I haven't been late."</p><p>Everyone was overjoyed, repeatedly saying he wasn't late.</p><p>Qin Sang greeted everyone, then went to Qing Jun's side, noticing her questioning look.  Before they left, he had mentioned the matter of the fat chicken searching for its family.</p><p>“I haven’t found it yet,” Qin Sang responded through voice transmission. “If the Thunder Swallowing Falcon Demon King is still alive, it’s most likely trapped somewhere in the basin. After this is over, I still need to take it to look around…” Then, he briefly mentioned his previous encounter and battle with Dongyang Bo.</p><p>Qing Jun’s eyes widened in surprise. She looked Qin Sang up and down for a while, making him feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to fight him here,” Qin Sang sighed. “Unfortunately, we’re short a helper.  I wonder if anything will go wrong this time against Zuìyuān.”</p><p>“I know you have extraordinary abilities, but I never expected you to be able to force Dongyang Bo back alone and nearly capture him. We know very little about Ye Laomo's plans. We’ve investigated for years without getting accurate information, and we can only do our best and leave the rest to fate.  If it weren’t for Tōng Yōu’s restraints, many fellow cultivators would have scattered to search for the Wújiàn Blood Mulberry. If we fail because of this, it’s fate, not your fault…” Qing Jun reassured him.</p><p>Qing Jun looked at Qin Sang and continued, "I've dedicated myself to the art of puppetry, collecting secret techniques and learning about Yuan Ying spirit puppets.  A spirit puppet infused with a spirit talisman is a formidable weapon, impossible to subdue. Dong Yang Bo's ruthless attack on Gong Liang Yu to seize the puppet wasn't necessarily for himself. He values Shao Hua Mountain greatly, yet has no disciples who have achieved Yuan Ying stage.  He likely intended to leave the puppet to Shao Hua Mountain, bolstering its strength. Even without Yuan Ying disciples in the future, the mountain would have this powerful guardian."</p><p>Qing Jun, with her sharp mind, pieced together the clues and instantly grasped Dong Yang Bo's plan.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. "Sister, what do you mean?"</p><p>"I've long suspected Dong Yang Bo was acting strangely.  Not long after leaving Zi Wei Palace, he suddenly broke through to the mid-stage, experiencing a rapid surge in cultivation and forcing his way through the Heavenly Tribulation. But since then, his cultivation has stagnated, only his magical treasure showing significant improvement. I thought he prioritized refining his treasure over cultivation. Now, it seems there was another reason.  His next Heavenly Tribulation...,"</p><p>Qing Jun trailed off, her words heavy with meaning.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang, lost in thought, Qing Jun exclaimed, "Below Yuan Ying, whether mortal or cultivator, all are bound by lifespan.  Beyond Yuan Ying, there's the daunting Four Nine Heavenly Tribulation, and the even greater challenge of a severed path. These trials relentlessly press, pushing one forward or towards death! The Dao is ruthless. You're one of us, haven't you understood yet?"</p><p>The Dao is ruthless!</p><p>The Dao is ruthless!</p><p>These words resonated like a bell, shaking Qin Sang to his core.</p><p>If Qing Jun was right, Dong Yang Bo used forbidden techniques to forcibly break through, leading to his stagnant cultivation. He likely knows he won't survive the next Heavenly Tribulation and is preparing for his demise.</p><p>In a hundred years, his enemies would perish in the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>Compared to the Heavenly Tribulation, this petty revenge meant nothing.</p><p>Since being manipulated by Dong Yang Bo and forced to flee to Cang Lang Sea, Qin Sang, while outwardly silent, had carried the burden of this incident like a heavy stone on his heart.</p><p>Even after achieving Yuan Ying, he carefully concealed his identity, consumed by revenge.</p><p>Revenge is acceptable, but it shouldn't cloud one's judgment and obstruct the path of cultivation!</p>
