<h1>Chapter 1337 Control</h1><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Someone disturbed the earth spirits guarding the place.</p><p>After a series of deafening roars, the peace of the cavern was shattered.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The formation trembled, and strange fluctuations appeared in the black mist.</p><p>From the chaos of the black mist, tall figures rose from the ground.</p><p>Their auras were violent, they roared loudly, and in their fury, charged at the invaders.  Shadows flickered in the black mist; the number of earth spirits was immense, seemingly everywhere.</p><p>The more people there were, the more earth spirits were attracted.</p><p>Xue Fu cursed under his breath, then said coldly, “You all see it, only four Soul Cleansing Liquids.  It's not enough to go around. Forget about alliances, it's every man for himself! Attack!”</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A bloody light flashed behind Xue Fu, revealing a blood bat phantom.</p><p>Its wings beat, creating a strong wind carrying a heavy stench of blood, as it pounced on the earth spirits.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A earth spirit was torn apart by Xue Fu, but immediately, others swarmed in.</p><p>The other demonic cultivators exchanged glances and charged into the army of earth spirits, rushing towards the protective barrier in the center.</p><p>For a moment, chaos reigned in the cavern.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang and Ming Wei had entered the cavern.</p><p>Qin Sang wielded his ebony sword, cutting down the earth spirits in front of him, secretly communicating with Ming Wei through voice transmission, “There are only four Soul Cleansing Liquids. Our original plan will likely be difficult to achieve.”</p><p>Bai was also interested in the Soul Cleansing Liquids.</p><p>Qin Sang was confident in securing one bottle for himself.</p><p>However, the three of them taking three bottles would certainly anger everyone.</p><p>If there were more Soul Cleansing Liquids, they might have been able to fish in troubled waters.  Now, every bottle had countless eyes on it, making the situation quite tricky for Qin Sang.</p><p>Facing so many opponents, his only reliance was his escape technique, far superior to cultivators of his level.</p><p>But if he were surrounded and his escape technique restricted, his situation would be extremely dangerous. The cultivators here were all the best of the best from various sects; Qin Sang wasn't sure he could escape safely.</p><p>“If it doesn't work out, I’ll give up.  It was just a guess that it might help me. As long as you can find the Sky Corpse Sect and remove the Sky Corpse Talisman, having the Soul Cleansing Liquid or not makes little difference.”</p><p>Bai, aware of the danger, communicated secretly with Qin Sang, preparing to give up.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then voice-transmitted, “Let's see how the situation unfolds. If there's a chance, we definitely can't give up. If you can advance to Corpse King, our actions will be much easier when we return to Xiao Han Domain.  Xiao Han Domain has seen the shadow of ancient demons and is unstable, and I also have enemies there.”</p><p>Bai hummed in agreement, saying nothing more, trusting Qin Sang's judgment.</p><p>Ming Wei’s expression wasn't good. She forced a laugh, “Qin Daoist, you wouldn't be planning to break our alliance, act alone, and leave us to our fates, would you?”</p><p>Although she had the Life Talisman, seeing this situation, she understood her hopes were slim.</p><p>As she learned more about Qin Sang along the way, she felt increasingly that he was unfathomable.  If she cooperated with him, there might be a chance.</p><p>She now regretted being overconfident when making the oath and not binding herself tightly to Qin Sang, creating her own predicament.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a long time, also hesitant.</p><p>The Life Talisman in Ming Wei's hands could produce miraculous effects, but allying with her meant each additional bottle of Soul Cleansing Liquid increased the risk considerably.  It was a tough decision.</p><p>In another direction…</p><p>Elder Ye suppressed his cultivation, only using a portion of his strength, quietly approaching the protective barrier.</p><p>Su Nu and the others stood back-to-back, keeping a distance behind Elder Ye, prioritizing self-preservation and waiting for the right moment.</p><p>The three long-bearded elders were extremely nervous, suppressing their excitement, occasionally glancing at the Soul Cleansing Liquids, eager to claim them.</p><p>Only Su Nu wasn't so eager for the Soul Cleansing Liquid.</p><p>Her beautiful eyes scanned the other cultivators in the cavern.</p><p>The black mist swirled, cultivators and earth spirits battling.</p><p>At that moment, Su Nu's gaze sharpened, fixed on a figure.  Although she couldn't see clearly, she was sure it was the person she was looking for.</p><p>Her heart stirred. Her attack with her magic blade slowed slightly, allowing the earth spirits to force her back.  The earth spirits' attack intensified, and Su Nu was about to be in danger.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A blade of light flew from behind Su Nu, slaying the earth spirits.</p><p>Su Nu steadied herself, relieved.  “Thank you, senior brother, for your help.”</p><p>The strong man continued to slash away at the earth spirits with his blade, relieving the pressure on Su Nu, and concernedly asked, “Junior sister, how are you? Is your spirit unstable? Don't use your true essence anymore, come to the middle to rest and recover, lest your mind falters!”</p><p>Even here, the influence of the confusing cavern not only persisted but intensified.</p><p>Fortunately, they were all top experts, each with methods to protect their spirits, leaving them with enough strength to fight the earth spirits.</p><p>Su Nu took a breath and shook her head.  "My cultivation technique happens to have the effect of stabilizing the mind, so I'm not greatly affected. However, we're too close together. My escape techniques are useless here. Senior Brother, perhaps we should spread out a bit. As long as we're not too far apart, there shouldn't be any danger."</p><p>The alluring woman chimed in, "Junior Sister is right, being huddled together is hindering us! We can regroup closer to form a formation when Master needs to make a move."</p><p>The elder with the long beard sighed, "I was worried you'd be affected by the Soul-Trapping Cavern... Since both Junior Sisters think this is best, let's form a battle array, taking up positions on all four sides. We can watch each other's backs."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>The four spread out, each taking a position.</p><p>The situation quickly stabilized.</p><p>The elder and the others focused on dealing with the earth spirits, failing to notice Su Nu's subtle movements.</p><p>Su Nu kept her eyes fixed on that figure; she could see Master Ye's back in her peripheral vision, and her heart was pounding. She used her magic wings, wielding her blade to slay earth spirits, while her other hand, hidden in her sleeve, secretly performed hand seals.</p><p>Master Ye moved quickly, getting closer and closer to the seal.</p><p>Distance widened.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Su Nu cut down an earth spirit.</p><p>But before the earth spirit fell, her other hand shot out, pressing against its forehead, then she slashed it far away with her blade.</p><p>That earth spirit didn't merge into the ground; its body swayed, then it stood up, controlled by Su Nu.</p><p>Hollow eyes glowed with an eerie light. The earth spirit shook its head, turning to look at a figure battling earth spirits in the distance.</p><p>Then, it stamped its foot and dashed off.</p><p>The earth spirits seemed endless, and the closer they got to the seal, the stronger they became. Everyone was surrounded, submerged in the army of earth spirits, inching forward.</p><p>The strongest few were already attacking the seal.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't rush forward; he was discussing a plan with Ming Wei.</p><p>"Friend Daoist…"</p><p>Qin Sang's voice trailed off mid-transmission, his sword technique abruptly changing.</p><p>The ebony sword, which had been cutting a swathe through the earth spirit army, suddenly sheathed its glow, hovering before an earth spirit.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to look.</p><p>He'd sensed something unusual; this earth spirit seemed…off.</p><p>"Friend Daoist, it's me!"</p><p>A familiar voice came from within the earth spirit.</p>
