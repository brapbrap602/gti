<h1>Chapter 1308: The Demon Hunt</h1><p>“Changhong, it seems you didn’t take the Withering Essence Pill. What a pity…”</p><p>Zhenyi Daozhang, leading the Heavenly Path Alliance, had clashed with the Abyss of Sin for many years. He and Changhong Zhenren were old rivals with long-standing grudges.  Thinking of the Abyss of Sin's current plight, Zhenyi couldn’t help but gloat, sneering, “You prided yourselves on your unmatched wit, yet were played like puppets by Ye Laomo, nearly losing everything. This will be the laughingstock of the world!”</p><p>“Old geezer, if a breakthrough opportunity were presented to you, I don't believe you wouldn't be tempted,”</p><p>Changhong Zhenren sneered back.</p><p>He glanced at Qu Huan, knowing the secret was leaked by this traitor.  Because of Qu Huan’s betrayal, the Abyss of Sin’s situation worsened, making negotiations far more difficult.</p><p>Qu Huan stood beside Zhenyi Daozhang, smiling faintly and nodding in greeting, completely unfazed.  Having dared to betray the Abyss of Sin, he didn't fear offending anyone.</p><p>Changhong Zhenren’s eyes flashed with disdain, ignoring him.</p><p>Zhenyi Daozhang's expression faltered.</p><p>Ye Laomo's planning was so deep, his schemes so long-laid, that even they would have fallen for it.</p><p>Changhong Zhenren had been cautious, using younger cultivators to test the pill’s efficacy. He endured for a long time without taking the Withering Essence Pill, otherwise, the Abyss of Sin would have been completely wiped out by Ye Laomo.</p><p>“Qin, I’m curious about what happened when you and your fellow cultivators hunted demons in the Sin God Palace. Why did so many fall prey to the trap without realizing it?  Could the Zhenren enlighten me?”</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly asked.</p><p>Since it was a trap set by Ye Laomo, was the demon truly dead or merely feigning it?  The Sin God Palace sealing the demon, the aura of the幽晶塔 (Youjing Tower) being close to the Demon Lord – these things, when considered together, gave Qin Sang a bad feeling. He couldn't afford to be careless. He didn't want to face the Demon Lord again.</p><p>Qu Huan didn't know the details. Changhong Zhenren was a firsthand witness; perhaps he could glean something from his account.</p><p>Changhong Zhenren didn’t keep them in suspense, nodding to Qin Sang. “Since Daoist Qin wishes to know, I’ll tell you everything that happened. After all, there’s no need to hide it anymore.”</p><p>“Thank you, Zhenren.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>Tongyou Mojun and the others were also intrigued.</p><p>For a moment, everyone seemed to forget about the negotiations.</p><p>The battle raged, shouts of killing echoing.</p><p>The ground trembled, the golden protective barrier flickering.</p><p>Crimson clouds filled the eastern sky, the golden rays of the rising sun illuminating the cloud platform.</p><p>Changhong Zhenren’s face bore a look of reminiscence. After a moment's contemplation, he said,  “Even after all these years, I still remember it vividly.  The Sin God Palace is similar to Blood Lake—both places sealed and suppressed powerful demons; they should have been one in the ancient times. Therefore, the Sin God Palace’s scenery was completely different from the Ziwei Palace, with numerous sealed locations. Over the years, we’ve broken many seals, and the demons have perished, but there was one exception—that demon. A fellow cultivator discovered the demon’s seal and nearly opened it, but he noticed something strange at the last moment and sent out a message before being devoured.  The demon, tormented for countless years, had lost its sanity, becoming bloodthirsty and frenzied. We gathered at the seal, and battled the demon.”</p><p>Here, Changhong Zhenren sighed, a hint of regret flashing in his eyes.  “Ye Laomo wasn’t there at the time. The demon was incredibly powerful, and we were no match for it, so we called upon Ye Laomo and others for help.  When soul-searching the demon to prevent Ye Laomo from tampering, Tianzheng Daoist and I did it ourselves.</p><p>“You should know that the higher the opponent’s cultivation, the more difficult soul-searching becomes.  They usually have some defensive measures.</p><p>“Luckily, the demon had lost its sanity due to torture. We used a legacy treasure from the Xing Heng Sect to extract fragmented memories from the demon's remnant soul.</p><p>“That's why we never suspected Ye Laomo.</p><p>“The Withering Essence Pill was obtained through soul-searching, but the method for refining the Youjing Tower was found by a cultivator from the Xing Heng Sect when exploring another secret realm.  Who could have imagined it was all part of Ye Laomo's scheme?</p><p>“Whether Ye Laomo colluded with the demon beforehand, or if the demon was merely a pawn in his hands, remains unknown.”</p><p>After listening to Changhong Zhenren’s account,</p><p>Qin Sang and the others exchanged glances, knowing that Changhong Zhenren had certainly concealed some secrets. But these experiences were likely true.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang asked Changhong Zhenren about the demon's attack methods.  He asked in detail, and despite not understanding Qin Sang’s intentions, Changhong Zhenren carefully recalled the events. In truth, the demon had been incredibly frenzied at the time, showing no pattern whatsoever.</p><p>Afterward, Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>Based on the description by Cang Hong Zhenren, the demon did not use any soul-based attacks similar to the "Splitting Yuan God Slash."</p><p>"Are you certain that the demon is truly dead?"</p><p>Tong You Mojun asked, frowning.</p><p>"The demon's soul was scattered before my very eyes.  Someone was always vigilant against Ye Laomo; he had no chance to interfere. There are no remaining demonic spirits!  In front of so many people, the demon couldn't easily control Ye Laomo. If his personality had changed, it would be hard to disguise without flaws. We can be fairly certain that it was all a plot set up by Ye Laomo from beginning to end. The important question is, what role did Ye Laomo play behind the scenes?"</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren said.</p><p>"So, you suffered a great loss and still don't understand Ye Laomo's intentions?"</p><p>Zhen Yi Daochang added sarcastically, before changing his tone to return to the main topic. "Since you wish to negotiate, you should first show some sincerity. Hand over the method for refining the Youjing Tower."</p><p>The Youjing Tower is undoubtedly a powerful weapon on the battlefield.</p><p>Zui Yuan's sole possession of the Youjing Tower is a constant threat.</p><p>Handing over the Youjing Tower would eliminate their concerns about letting a tiger return to the mountain.</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>Unexpectedly, Cang Hong Zhenren readily agreed, immediately producing a jade slip and placing it between them.</p><p>"This contains the refining method."</p><p>The five members of the Two Realms Alliance were very surprised, quickly realizing that there must be a trick to it.</p><p>For many years, the Two Realms Alliance has only had this many Youjing Towers; there haven't been any new ones.</p><p>The intact Youjing Tower was destroyed by Ye Laomo.</p><p>It's likely that something essential is missing, making it impossible to refine new Youjing Towers!</p><p>"Does refining the Youjing Tower require some stringent conditions?" Qu Huan asked dubiously.  He held some status in Zui Yuan, but he didn't have access to its core secrets.</p><p>Cang Hong Zhenren didn't answer, pausing slightly before continuing.  "Besides the Youjing Tower, there's another condition you can't refuse. Zui Yuan will open the Zui Shen Palace to the Two Realms. From now on, you can pass through the Zui Shen Palace to enter the Zi Wei Palace, eliminating the need to expend massive resources on defensive arrays to pass through the Zi Wei Palace's protective formations."</p><p>This condition was indeed very tempting.</p><p>It wouldn't hurt Zui Yuan, as the Zui Shen Palace is far inferior to the Zi Wei Palace; anything easily obtainable has already been explored.  The focus of future conflicts will be the treasures within the Zi Wei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others weren't fools. They keenly sensed that Cang Hong Zhenren's initiative to invite them into the Zui Shen Palace must have a reason, exclaiming, "Did Ye Laomo escape into the Zui Shen Palace?"</p>
