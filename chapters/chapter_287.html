<h1>Chapter 280: Guiyuan Formation</h1><p>Qin Sang's purpose was to gain Yu Kong's trust, and to do so, the first thing he had to do was display his worth and demonstrate some of his strength, ideally attracting Yu Kong to approach him主动.</p><p>The other purpose was to let Yu Kong and the others know that he was not to be messed with, so that he could avoid being used as a cannon fodder when danger strikes.</p><p>This plan was made by Qin Sang long ago, for if it were up to him, he would never draw this much attention to himself.</p><p>He showed his strength, but not excessively.</p><p>The乌木剑, along with the1000 Machine Sword Formation, was enough to deter them.</p><p>Materials like the Ten Directions阎罗Banner, Jade如意符, and Nine Dragons天辇符 could not be exposed.</p><p>The乌木剑 forced Yan Wu back and flew back with a 'swoosh'. With a flicker, it was immediately recalled into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>The round Sword Formation was still circling in the air, and the sword energy was not dispelled until the next moment. However, the sharp sword intent still lingered and filled the air, staying there for a long time.</p><p>Their expressions varied.</p><p>At the moment the乌木剑 appeared, Shangguan Lifeng's eyes lit up and his gaze locked onto it. When Qin Sang recalled it, he shifted his gaze onto Qin Sang, and the thick and strong battle intent in his eyes appeared before it was suppressed.</p><p>"What a great sword!"</p><p>The Xiu sisters shared a glance. Out of respect for the strong, whether it was Xiu Zhiying's indifference or Xiu Zhirui's charming demeanor, both of them subdued a little. They cupped their hands towards Qin Sang.</p><p>"Priest Qingfeng's swordsmanship is divine. I am impressed."</p><p>Only Yan Wu was embarrassed by Qin Sang and had a livid face.</p><p>If he had faced him head-on, Yan Wu might not have been so embarrassed.</p><p>He wanted to salvage his pride, but deep down, he was sure that since this priest dared expose his lifebound soul sword, he likely had means that surpassed soul swords.</p><p>If he rashly went up again, he would be humiliating himself.</p><p>Yan Wu glared at Qin Sang with gloomy eyes and coldly snorted. Without saying anything, he turned and entered his room. After a thud, his door was slammed shut.</p><p>Following that, the Xiu sisters and Shangguan Lifeng also returned to their rooms. After all, they did not really know each other, so there was no need to exchange words.</p><p>Faced with Yan Wu's hatred, Qin Sang's expression remained normal. Yu Kong also acted as if he did not see Yan Wu's action. He cupped his hands and praised, "Priest, what a great sword of yours! And what great swordsmanship! With the assistance of a priest and fellow friends, I have no reason to worry about the big event failing."</p><p>"Priest, do settle down in your room first. Simply remove the seal in your room and you will not be disturbed. You can cultivate in peace." Yu Kong led Qin Sang into an empty room and gave instructions on how to control the seal in the room.</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the room and realised that it was narrow and the furnishings were extremely plain. It was especially small, only a quarter the size of a normal room, and there was only a straw cushion.</p><p>Yu Kong explained, "The cave dwelling of the West Wilderness Town is extremely expensive. With the assets of this Yu, I can only afford this small courtyard. The largest room has been given to the Xiu sisters and the others are somewhat cramped, so I hope the priest will not mind."</p><p>"For us cultivators, any place can be a shelter."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head to show that he did not mind. Following that, he asked with some doubt, "Fellow Friend Yu, I heard from the old shopkeeper that you are proficient in an array formation that gives us a more than 90% chance of passing the defensive formation and entering Qiuhong Market Town. I wonder what the name of this array formation is? When can we begin to practice?"</p><p>Yu Kong lightly slapped his forehead and shook his head, chuckling. "If the priest had not mentioned it, I would have nearly forgotten this matter! It must have been because when I saw the priest's high strength, it made this Yu so excited to have the priest's assistance, and this most important matter was almost forgotten by me..."</p><p>Although it was clear that Yu Kong was just acting, an ordinary person would have been complacent, even if they could control themselves.</p><p>This person was really good at winning people over.</p><p>Qin Sang was vigilant and immediately said that he did not dare, "My skills are basic and are far inferior to Fellow Friend Yu's. As long as Fellow Friend Yu does not mind my low strength, I will do my utmost to maintain the array formation and will follow Fellow Friend Yu..."</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly.</p><p>"It may not be clear to the priest, but the old shopkeeper had exaggerated his words somewhat. The array formation of this Yu is called Guiyuan Formation. Its power is not as strong as the old shopkeeper had described, but because this Yu had once entered Qiuhong Market Town, I have some understanding of the defensive formation there, so the chances of success are indeed not little. In addition, this formation requires at least nine people to fully unleash its power. Including the priest, we have six people now. Priest, do not worry. Once we recruit three more people, we can begin to practice."</p><p>Just like the Nine Brilliance Galaxy Formation and the Guiyuan Formation, it required nine people to form the array.</p><p>However, the number 'nine' is extreme, which is normal, Qin Sang nodded, not asking more.</p><p>Yu Kong seemed to be very interested in Qin Sang and didn't rush to leave. Instead, he beat around the bush about Qin Sang's background.</p><p>"I've been active outside Xuanguan Pass all along. Later I heard that an ancient herb garden was found in this place and there were divine pills, so I hurried to get here. I didn't expect there to be so many tricks in Qiuhong Market. If I had known earlier, I would have invited two or three friends to join me to avoid such embarrassment..."</p><p>Qin Sang said, looking regretful.</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed, "I didn't expect the rumor to have spread to Xuanguan Pass?"</p><p>"Fellow Yu also says it's a rumor?"</p><p>Qin Sang feigned surprise and asked urgently, "There really are no divine pills in Qiuhong Market?"</p><p>Yu Kong's eyes flickered, and he looked at Qin Sang expressionlessly, saying very determinedly, "It's indeed a rumor. And it happens every time a secret place like Qiuhong Market appears. This time, however, it has spread widely, causing many people to be tricked like you, my friend. If people had said there were a few divine pills in a pagoda or an ancient building in Qiuhong Market, it would have been possible. But the rumor is that there is an undiscovered herb garden, which is impossible to believe for anyone who has entered Qiuhong Market. I don't know what the intentions of the rat spreading this rumor are."</p><p>Nothing could be heard from what Yu Kong said. After he had entered Xihua Town, he had made many inquiries, and most people's answers were similar to what Yu Kong had told him.</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He didn't forget to deal with Yu Kong. He frowned tightly, not saying anything.</p><p>Yu Kong comforted him, "My friend, you don't have to worry. Even if the herb garden is a rumor, there are still many places that hold treasures in Qiuhong Market, including divine pills. I happen to know one or two. If you are interested, we can continue cooperating after entering Qiuhong Market. As for any treasures we find, we can each take what we need and share them fairly. What do you think?"</p><p>"This..."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't expect the effect of the Ebony Sword to be so good that Yu Kong had invited him on the very first day.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to agree, but it would have been inconsistent with the cautious character he had created in front of the old owner, so he had to give up this opportunity. He hesitated on his face.</p><p>"You don't have to rush to give me an answer."</p><p>Yu Kong lifted his foot to go out, saying while walking, "We will still spend a lot of time together. By then, you will know what kind of character I have."</p><p>Qin Sang was greatly relieved and nodded.</p><p>Chapter 280: The Convergence Formation</p><p>Qin Sang's goal was to gain Yu Kong's trust.  First, he needed to demonstrate his value and showcase a certain level of strength, ideally enough to entice Yu Kong to approach him.</p><p>His other objective was to let Yu Kong and the others know he wasn't someone to be trifled with, preventing them from using him as a pawn in dangerous situations.</p><p>This was a plan Qin Sang had formulated beforehand.  Left to his own devices, he would have avoided drawing attention to himself.</p><p>He needed to display strength, but not excessively.</p><p>The Ebony Sword and the Thousand Mechanisms Sword Formation were sufficient to deter them.</p><p>The Ten Yama King Banner, the Jade Ruyi Talisman, and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman – none of these could be revealed.</p><p>Having repelled Yan Wu, the Ebony Sword whistled as it flew back, flashing once before disappearing into Qin Sang's body.</p><p>The circular sword formation still hovered in the air. A moment later, the sword energies dissipated, but the sharp sword intent lingered in everyone's minds, refusing to disperse.</p><p>The onlookers wore various expressions.</p><p>The moment the Ebony Sword appeared, Shangguan Lifeng's eyes had lit up, fixated on the weapon.  After Qin Sang withdrew the sword, his gaze shifted to Qin Sang himself, a strong battle intent flickering in his eyes before quickly subsiding.</p><p>―――――</p><p>"What a sword!"</p><p>The Xiu sisters exchanged glances. Out of respect for a powerful cultivator, both Xiu Zhiying's coldness and Xiu Zhirui's charm diminished somewhat. They bowed to Qin Sang.</p><p>"Master Qingfeng's swordsmanship is divine. We are impressed."</p><p>Only Yan Wu, whose pride had been wounded, remained grim-faced.</p><p>In a direct confrontation, Yan Wu might not have been so easily repelled.</p><p>He wanted to regain face but knew that since the Daoist dared to reveal his natal flying sword, he likely possessed even stronger methods.</p><p>To challenge him rashly would be to invite humiliation.</p><p>Yan Wu glared at Qin Sang, snorted coldly, and without a word, turned and stormed into his room, slamming the door shut.</p><p>The Xiu sisters and Shangguan Lifeng also returned to their rooms.  Being strangers, they had no desire for idle chatter.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed by Yan Wu's animosity. Yu Kong also seemed oblivious to Yan Wu's behavior. He cupped his hands and praised, "Master, what a magnificent sword! What superb swordsmanship! With your and the other fellow Daoists' help, how can we fail in our great endeavor?"</p><p>"Master, please settle into your room. Simply activate the restrictions, and you needn't worry about being disturbed. You can cultivate in peace." Yu Kong led Qin Sang to an empty room and instructed him on how to manipulate the restrictions within.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around. The room was cramped and sparsely furnished, only about a quarter the size of a typical room, with just a single meditation cushion inside.</p><p>Yu Kong explained, "Cave dwellings in West Desolation Town are exorbitantly expensive. My meager funds could only afford this small courtyard. I gave the largest room to the Xiu sisters; the others are indeed rather cramped. I hope you won't mind, Master."</p><p>"As cultivators, we require only a place to rest."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, indicating he didn't mind. Then, with a hint of curiosity, he asked, "Fellow Daoist Yu, I heard from the innkeeper that you are proficient in a formation that can ensure safe passage through the protective formation and into Autumn Wilds Market with over ninety percent certainty.  May I inquire as to the name of this formation? And when do we begin practicing it?"</p><p>Yu Kong lightly patted his forehead, shaking his head and chuckling. "If you hadn't mentioned it, Master, I would have nearly forgotten! I suppose seeing your impressive strength, and with such a powerful ally, I became overly excited and put this most crucial matter out of my mind..."</p><p>Although Qin Sang understood Yu Kong's flattery, such sincere-sounding compliments would inevitably please most people.</p><p>This man is skilled at winning people over.</p><p>Qin Sang remained wary, modestly replying, "My meager skills are far inferior to yours, Fellow Daoist Yu.  As long as you do not find my strength lacking, I will do my utmost to maintain the formation and follow your lead..."</p><p>Yu Kong nodded slightly.</p><p>"To be honest, Master, the innkeeper exaggerated somewhat.  My formation is called the Convergence Formation. Its power isn't as great as he claimed, but because I've entered Autumn Wilds Market once before and have some understanding of the protective formation, I am indeed quite confident.  Furthermore, this formation requires at least nine people to reach its full potential.  Including you, we now have six. Please be patient, Master.  We just need to recruit three more, and then we can begin practicing the formation."</p><p>Like the Nine Radiance Star River Formation, the Convergence Formation also required nine participants.</p><p>"Nine" is indeed an extreme number, but it's quite normal. Qin Sang nodded, not asking further.</p><p>Yu Kong seemed very interested in Qin Sang. He didn't leave immediately, but instead subtly inquired about Qin Sang's origins.</p><p>"I've been active beyond Skull Ridge. Later, I heard that an ancient herb garden was discovered here, with spirit herbs appearing, so I hurried over. I didn't expect Autumn Fair to be so intricate. Had I known, I would have invited a few friends along, and wouldn't be in such a difficult situation..." Qin Sang said, feigning frustration.</p><p>Yu Kong shook his head and sighed. "I can't believe the rumor has already spread to Skull Ridge."</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Yu also thinks it's a rumor?" Qin Sang feigned astonishment, his voice urgent. "Are there really no spirit herbs in Autumn Fair?"</p><p>Yu Kong's eyes flickered. He glanced at Qin Sang discreetly and said with unusual certainty, "It is indeed a rumor. Every time a secret realm like Autumn Fair appears, similar rumors circulate. This time, it has spread particularly widely, misleading many fellow Daoists, just like yourself. If the rumor said a few spirit herbs were hidden in a pagoda or ancient building within Autumn Fair, it might be plausible. But the rumor claims there's an undiscovered herb garden. Anyone who's been to Autumn Fair wouldn't believe that. I wonder what the intentions are of the scoundrels spreading such rumors."</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't glean anything from Yu Kong's words. Since entering West Wasteland Town, he had made several inquiries, and the information he received was similar to what Yu Kong had said.</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He didn't forget to interact with Yu Kong, his brow furrowed in silence.</p><p>Yu Kong consoled him, "Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. Even if the herb garden is a rumor, there are many places in Autumn Fair where treasures are hidden, including spirit herbs and immortal pills. I happen to know a thing or two. If you're interested, after we enter Autumn Fair, we could cooperate. We can divide the obtained treasures fairly, each taking what they need. What do you think?"</p><p>"This..."  Qin Sang hadn't expected the Ebony Sword's effect to be so potent. It was only the first day, and Yu Kong had already extended an invitation.</p><p>Qin Sang was inclined to accept, but it didn't fit the cautious persona he had presented to the old shopkeeper. He had to forgo this opportunity, a look of hesitation appearing on his face.</p><p>"Don't rush to answer, Fellow Daoist."  Yu Kong walked towards the exit, saying as he went, "We still have a long time to spend together. By then, you'll know my character."</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief and nodded vigorously.</p>
