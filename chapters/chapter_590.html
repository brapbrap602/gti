Chapter 583: It Was Him!

“Dodge!”
Yun Youzi also noticed something amiss with the Night Fiend and urgently warned Qin Sang.
But he was too far away, and in order to trap the Shadow Leopard, he had not only exhausted the power of the Blood Curse and the Immaculate Pearl, but also overdrawn his own spiritual energy. He was willing but unable to help.
How could the Night Fiend betray him?
Qin Sang was shocked. He could clearly sense that his soul mark was still within the Night Fiend's body, undamaged and perfectly intact.
Yu Hua's consciousness had long been erased during the corpse refinement process.
Logically, the Night Fiend absolutely could not betray him. Otherwise, it would have started to rebel the moment it was refined.
The Night Fiend's sudden betrayal came without any warning.
Moreover, to avoid the aftereffects of the Void Thunder, Qin Sang had actively moved back. The distance between the two wasn't far. The Night Fiend's sudden attack caught Qin Sang off guard. By the time he noticed the anomaly, it was already close at hand.
Caught completely unprepared, Qin Sang's first reaction was to activate the soul mark and forcibly control the Night Fiend to stop it.
The Night Fiend's movements abruptly halted, and it let out a strange roar.
Its green-faced, fanged face, which was originally lifeless and expressionless, now showed pain and struggle, twisted and distorted, like a living person.
It was resisting Qin Sang's control!
At the same time, Qin Sang felt an unprecedented power within the Night Fiend, forcibly assaulting his soul mark.
This power had been hidden very deeply.
Before this, Qin Sang had always controlled the Night Fiend, but he had never detected this power. It was incredibly foreign and peculiar, carrying a sinister aura, yet distinct from the Night Fiend's deathly energy.
This was definitely not the Night Fiend's own power!
After this brief pause, the Night Fiend lunged at him again with a ferocious expression.
Its figure was like a ghost, deathly energy washing over Qin Sang.
Qin Sang realized that his soul mark was being suppressed by that unknown power; the Night Fiend was completely out of his control!
But Qin Sang didn't panic.
This brief moment was enough.  Although he no longer had the Void Thunder, he still had his Corpse Core.
As he retreated, the Corpse Core in his dantian finally unleashed.  Vigorous true essence instantly circulated through his body, and a dazzling sword light flashed between him and the Night Fiend.
Sword energy arced like a rainbow, accompanied by rumbling thunder.
The Ebony Sword finally displayed its power once again!
The Night Fiend's betrayal was inexplicable to Qin Sang, so he didn't hold back. The Ebony Sword went straight for the Night Fiend's vital point between its eyebrows.
Having refined the Night Fiend himself, Qin Sang knew its weaknesses very well.  Its biggest weakness was its nascent soul. As long as he shattered the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and destroyed its nascent soul, he could kill it.
Unexpectedly, although the Ebony Sword was fast, the Night Fiend's reaction was just as quick. With a strange cry, it managed to raise its ghost claws in front of its face at the very last moment.
Both its palms were severely injured by the Ebony Sword, but it had protected its vital point, escaping death.
Immediately afterward, the Night Fiend retreated rapidly.  A startled cry came from within its body: "Corpse Core?"
Hearing this cry, Qin Sang's face darkened.
He had already suspected that the Night Fiend couldn't have betrayed him for no reason, unless a stray soul had concealed itself from his senses and entered the Night Fiend's body, taking control.
Thinking back, there was only one possibility—the Earth Sinkhole!
From the time he captured Yu Hua until he refined him into the Night Fiend, Qin Sang had kept him by his side. It was impossible for anyone to invade the Night Fiend's body without his notice.
Only during the period when the Night Fiend was severely injured after killing Priest Jiu Pao and was recovering in the Earth Sinkhole, a time when Qin Sang wasn't by its side, was there a possibility of it being taken advantage of.
This scream confirmed his suspicion.
For some reason, Qin Sang felt the voice was familiar, as if he had heard it before.
The situation didn't allow Qin Sang to think too much.
Having failed its sneak attack, the Night Fiend turned and lunged towards the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit Tree.  A green light flashed on its chest as it burst forth with astonishing speed, even faster than the Ebony Sword empowered by Sword Energy Thunder Sound.
Yun Youzi was exhausted and unable to stop it.
Caught off guard, Qin Sang was also too late to intercept.
In the blink of an eye, the Night Fiend flew across the lake and landed in front of the Crimson Cloud Violet Fruit Tree.  Its palms faced the tree, deathly energy coiling around the trunk and the ripened fruit.
It turned around, its black eyes gleaming coldly at Qin Sang.
"Make a move, and I'll destroy it immediately!"
Landing on the water, Qin Sang's face was livid. He now remembered where he had heard this voice and the identity of its owner.
"Yi Tiannie! You're still alive!"
Yi Tiannie, the Sect Master of the Ghost Yin Sect.
Years ago, it was Yi Tiannie who had planted the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu in Qin Sang's nascent soul, forcing him to infiltrate the Yuan Zhao Sect as a spy, leading to a series of calamities.
He was the first ruthless fiend Qin Sang encountered, against whom he was powerless to resist, only able to be manipulated.
Yi Tiannie was already nearing the end of his lifespan back then. In a desperate gamble, he stole the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid, a treasure of the Yuan Zhao Sect, but was killed by the Sect Master who detonated a great formation. It was said that nothing remained of his body.
Qin Sang had thought he was long dead, yet he had survived to this day, seizing the Night Fiend and ambushing him.
The Night Fiend's face shifted and transformed into Yi Tiannie's.
Qin Sang would recognize that face even if it were turned to ash!
"Daring to refine yourself into a corpse, achieving a Corpse Core as an external elixir, how ruthless!"
Yi Tiannie cackled, suddenly sighing with admiration:  "My Ghost Yin Sect actually produced such a character! Even I can misjudge someone. The boy I personally declared a waste back then turned out to be a ruthless one. Hiding within the righteous path, cultivating demonic arts, turning around to annihilate my entire Ghost Yin Sect, using corpse refinement techniques on himself, disrupting my plans. There’s no other like him in the cultivation world. No wonder you've come this far!"
There was a hint of appreciation in Yi Tiannie's tone.
Qin Sang didn't feel honored.  His chest was filled with rage, like a volcano about to erupt. "Your nascent soul has been hiding inside Yu Hua's body all this time?"
Discovering that it was Yi Tiannie occupying the Night Fiend's body, everything suddenly clicked into place for Qin Sang.  Many previous doubts were now explained.
He recalled his encounters with Yu Hua.
In the Bottomless Valley, Yu Hua had tracked him down through the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu.
But at that time, Qin Sang was already using the Void Essence Seal to suppress the Gu's fluctuations, controlling them within a certain range.  Others could only sense him within this range.
Only Yi Tiannie, the master of the Heart-Devouring Insect Gu, was an exception.
The one who sensed him back then was likely not Yu Hua, but Yi Tiannie!
Furthermore, Yu Hua's knowledge of the remaining Ghost Yin Sect members far exceeded what a Foundation Establishment disciple should possess. He not only knew their whereabouts, but also the details and hiding place of Priest Jiu Pao.
