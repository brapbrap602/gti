<h1>Chapter 999: Reunion</h1><p>“Friend, have you made any progress on how to overcome the Corpse King?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked with some joy upon hearing this.</p><p>Bai shook his head. “Without resolving the issue of inherent vitality, I wouldn't even dare attempt a breakthrough, let alone have a plan.  I've also had difficulty finding useful information from other corpse-path secret techniques.”</p><p>…</p><p>The two had a long private discussion in the cave dwelling, then secretly left the market town and flew towards the天道宗 sect.</p><p>Amidst a landscape of bluish-green and ochre-red, a faint white path snaked upward.</p><p>This inconspicuous mountain path led directly to the天道宗 gate.</p><p>At that moment, a figure was walking along the mountain path.</p><p>Qin Sang was alone.</p><p>His steps, seemingly slow but actually swift, allowed him to cover more than ten zhang with each stride, quickly reaching the vicinity of the mountaintop, where he saw an ancient stele inscribed with the words "天道".</p><p>It seemed this was the gate of the天道宗.</p><p>It looked rather shabby.</p><p>But the ancient天道 stele was imbued with Daoist intent, showcasing its extraordinary nature.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back at the mountain below, then took another step forward.</p><p>The scenery suddenly shifted. Before Qin Sang, two young men and women appeared, their cultivation only at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>“Junior Zhang Yi and Xia You, stationed here to guard the mountain gate, respectfully ask for the senior's Daoist name and purpose of visit?”</p><p>The two bowed to Qin Sang, their attitude respectful.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't deliberately conceal his cultivation, which was evident; the two naturally did not dare to be the slightest bit negligent.</p><p>“My Daoist name is Qin. I am visiting your sect today to see an old friend.”</p><p>Qin Sang said with a pleasant expression.</p><p>Since he was paying a visit, it was not good to be secretive; Qin Sang used his true appearance.</p><p>With his identity, he had offended the Black Serpent Mountain faction of the Witch Clan.</p><p>Later, Qin Sang had investigated thoroughly. The Lan Dou Gate hadn't issued a large-scale manhunt for him, indicating that the incident hadn't affected him, so he didn't have to worry about anything in human territory.</p><p>Upon hearing this, the two relaxed. Xia You, the woman, said, “May we ask which senior uncle the old friend is, senior? We will convey the message for you immediately.”</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. “I don’t know much about this old friend. I had the chance to meet him many years ago, and then lost contact. I happened to pass by the天道宗, remembered this old acquaintance, and decided to pay a visit. I only know that this old friend’s surname is Ning, and he claimed to be from the sword cultivator lineage…”</p><p>The information he gave was vague.</p><p>The two looked troubled and asked, “May we ask what cultivation level this old friend of yours is, senior?”</p><p>“That's hard to say. Many years ago, he was already at the Golden Core stage. Given his aptitude, he should have a great chance of reaching the Nascent Soul stage…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and said.</p><p>The two showed deep respect, not daring to be negligent. After exchanging a few voice transmissions, Xia You respectfully said, “We can’t be certain of the identity of your old friend, senior. If you have nothing urgent, why not wait with us at the welcoming peak? We will report to our senior uncle and help you find your friend.”</p><p>“Very well…”</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed and followed Xia You into the天道宗.</p><p>Peaks rose majestically, rivers crisscrossed.</p><p>The天道宗 truly deserved its title as the largest righteous sect in the Canglang Sea. What Qin Sang saw was just the tip of the iceberg, but the scenery was already as magnificent as Mount Shao Hua.</p><p>That's normal.</p><p>Mount Shao Hua only had one Nascent Soul ancestor, Dongyang Bo.  Similar sects were not uncommon in the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Compared to the Canglang Sea, the Xiaohan Domain was much smaller, even inferior to the Witch God Continent, let alone the entire vast sea area.</p><p>They soon arrived at the Welcoming Peak. Xia You settled Qin Sang in an exquisite guest house, had someone serve tea and spirit fruits, and then hurried away.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of drinking tea. He looked at the scenery outside, his mind filled with speculation.</p><p>Comparing the Pure Yang Sect to the天道宗 should be accurate.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu asked me to find someone here, there must be a reason, and probably already made arrangements, but what is that person’s identity?</p><p>Soon, there was a sudden sound of footsteps downstairs.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to look.</p><p>Xia You returned, followed by a young man.</p><p>Seeing the young man, Qin Sang's heart stirred. This person's cultivation was unfathomable, seemingly not weaker than his own.</p><p>“Uncle, this is the senior who is looking for an old friend surnamed Ning.”</p><p>Xia You introduced them. “Senior Qin, this is Uncle Pei…”</p><p>The young man surnamed Pei had a low voice, “You may leave now. I will receive Daoist Qin myself.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xia You bowed and left.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's gaze, the young man surnamed Pei sat calmly opposite him, personally pouring tea. “Xia You didn't give you enough details. Could you describe your old friend's characteristics in more detail?”</p><p>As he spoke, the young man presented a jade cup with both hands.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the jade cup. The rising steam transformed into countless shapes, with a strange sharpness, emitting a faint tea fragrance, refreshing and invigorating.</p><p>At this moment, his natal spirit sword stirred.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly. He reached out to take the jade cup, and the moment his fingertips touched it, they trembled slightly.</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang's fingers moved like a spirit sword, unleashing a burst of sword energy.</p><p>The energy was invisible.</p><p>The tea mist swirled even faster, initially forming images of birds, fish, insects, and flowers.  Then,  it morphed into fantastical creatures and finally into breathtaking celestial phenomena, stars and lightning, filling the small space.</p><p>The surge of sword intent was swift, appearing and disappearing as quickly as it came.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>In an instant, the tea mist dissipated without a trace.</p><p>The room remained unchanged, ordinary objects untouched.  Only the tea in the cup remained, its surface undisturbed.  The jade cup was intact.</p><p>Qin Sang drained the cup. The tea was warm and fragrant.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang set down the jade cup, gazing at the young man.  "Should I call you Daoist Pei, or Daoist Ning?"</p><p>Their brief exchange, confined to the tea mist, was over.  Victory or defeat was inconsequential.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed a familiar sword technique, identical to that of Elder Qingzhu.</p><p>"The 'Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen', you've actually cultivated this technique to such a high level!"</p><p>The young man exclaimed, bowing deeply. "Pei Yi Ke, Ning Yi Ke. When we're alone, please call me Daoist Ning. I am Ning Wu Hui!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  This man knew about the 'Chapter on Cultivating Swords with the Yuan Shen', clearly indicating a deep connection to Elder Qingzhu.  She had found her target.</p><p>It had been unexpectedly easy.</p><p>He was on Yingke Peak, responsible for this matter.  It was clearly prearranged.  No wonder Elder Qingzhu had been so confident.</p><p>"This place is too public. Daoist Ning, please come with me to my cave dwelling..."</p><p>Ning Wu Hui rose.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed and followed Ning Wu Hui out of the elegant house.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui's cave dwelling was behind Yingke Peak, nestled within a bamboo grove.</p><p>Once inside the grove, Ning Wu Hui transmitted his voice, "You've cultivated this technique to the late Foundation Establishment stage, so there should be no problem.  However, I've never met Daoist Qin before."</p><p>Qin Sang responded carefully, "I don't know of any agreement between Elder Qingzhu and Daoist Ning.  I had no prior interaction with Elder Qingzhu.  Our meeting was purely coincidental. After receiving guidance from Elder Qingzhu, I came to visit Daoist Ning."</p><p>—</p><p>—</p><p>Finally finished!</p>
