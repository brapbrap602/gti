<h1>Chapter 1569: Han Ling and the Snow Fox</h1><p>The snow scene vanished.</p><p>The sky remained overcast, but the snow had stopped.  No more snowflakes fell.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself amidst raging wind and waves, tossed about mercilessly.  The sights and sounds were indistinguishable from a real ocean. Whether or not the Yan Shan elder was personally skilled in illusionary techniques, the protective mountain formation was undoubtedly top-notch.</p><p>At least, with only Qin Sang's spirit sense, it would be difficult to find any flaws in it in a short time.</p><p>The ability to break this illusion was crucial to capturing the snow fox.</p><p>Qin Sang could understand why the Yan Shan elder was so uninterested.</p><p>In a flash of thought, Qin Sang haphazardly formed a hand seal, pressing it to his forehead. He closed and opened his eyes; a faint green light flickered in his pupils, his gaze sharp as he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>The green light in his pupils was, of course, a disguise.</p><p>The true power came from the Celestial Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's actions, the Yan Shan elder assumed Qin Sang was prepared. He subtly altered the formation, and the waves crashing towards Qin Sang instantly intensified several times.</p><p>*Boom…*</p><p>A wave crashed down.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared and disappeared within the churning water.</p><p>Within a ten-foot radius around him, the snow formed from his blade energy was not dispersed by the waves; instead, it swirled faster and became denser.</p><p>When the waves touched the snow, they froze instantly, then shattered into countless ice shards under the force of the blade energy.</p><p>The ice fragments fell into the water.</p><p>Countless pieces of ice floated on the surface, bobbing up and down, only to be swept up by new waves. Each change looked so real, flawless.</p><p>Even Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel.</p><p>Wave after wave.  </p><p>The waves were relentless.</p><p>The Yan Shan elder seemed to have run out of tricks; he only used this one attack.</p><p>Within a few breaths, Qin Sang had slashed hundreds of times. Not a single drop of water could penetrate the barrier of blade energy, leaving Qin Sang completely unharmed.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Another wave crashed down.</p><p>Qin Sang instinctively used the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade to defend, but he noticed clusters of white water spheres appearing out of nowhere in the depths of the waves, drifting with the current.</p><p>Seeing these seemingly light water spheres, Qin Sang sensed danger.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, his blade technique shifting. He slashed rapidly, circling his body.</p><p>The instant Qin Sang made his move, the water spheres suddenly leaped from the water's surface, shooting towards Qin Sang without pause, fast as lightning.</p><p>These were no mere water spheres, but water-elemental thunderbolts!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang was engulfed in the thunderbolts.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>…</p><p>All the thunderbolts exploded simultaneously, deafeningly loud.</p><p>Qin Sang disappeared, replaced by a cloud of white mist, with lightning flashing within it. The destructive aura emanated from the explosion's center.</p><p>While powerful, this level of attack wasn't enough to injure Qin Sang.</p><p>At this moment, the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade hung above Qin Sang's head, its body trembling rapidly, its blade energy surrounding him, resisting the thunderbolts. He knew this was clearly a diversionary tactic by the Yan Shan elder.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>The moment the thunderbolts exploded, a pale blue shadow silently appeared behind Qin Sang, raising a palm to strike his back.</p><p>The shadow's movements were extremely subtle, its form blending into the thunder, making it hard to distinguish, but its actions couldn't escape the Celestial Eye Butterfly's sight.</p><p>Qin Sang turned abruptly. The Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade let out a long cry; its blade energy surged, fast as a shooting star, instantly descending upon the shadow's head.</p><p>Upon being discovered, the shadow immediately abandoned its attack; its palm hadn't even fully raised before the Stepping-on-Snow Divine Blade cleaved it in two.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The illusion dissipated. The waves, thunderbolts, and shadow vanished simultaneously.</p><p>The Yan Shan elder materialized opposite Qin Sang, his eyes shining with admiration.  “My Flickering Shadow technique, even without the aid of this formation, is a decent concealment technique.  To be discovered so easily, before I even had a chance to strike…I believe in your abilities now.”</p><p>The show must go on.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed his blade, the green light in his eyes gradually fading.  “Your Flickering Shadow technique is indeed remarkable.  I was able to detect it because I was prepared beforehand; otherwise, it would have been difficult to avoid that strike.”</p><p>The Yan Shan elder chuckled. “You needn't be so modest. I know my own limits. As we agreed, I'll accompany you.”</p><p>Qin Sang was overjoyed. “When do you plan to leave?”</p><p>Shaking his head slightly, the Yan Shan elder replied, "The snow fox's territory is some distance from here, and the snowfall is too heavy to easily determine its range.  Besides, I need to make some preparations."</p><p>A cultivator, let's call him Yan Shan, confided in Qin Sang, "I've been longing to capture the snow fox.  Such a strange creature must have a reason for existing.  And of course, I expect a share of the treasures we find."</p><p>This frank declaration, surprisingly, eased Qin Sang's mind.  A partnership was formed. Qin Sang wouldn't need to haggle over payment; Yan Shan would work diligently.  Qin Sang only desired more cold crystals; any other treasures were freely Yan Shan's.</p><p>Looking at the heavy clouds, Qin Sang asked, "When will this snowstorm end?"</p><p>Yan Shan chuckled, "These snowstorms can last thirty to fifty years.  You wouldn't wait that long, I imagine.  I estimate the snow will be weakest in six months. Let's leave then…"</p><p>As they descended the mountain, Qin Sang noticed Yan Shan lived completely alone. He had no disciples, no servants, not even a spirit beast.  No wonder there wasn't even anyone to offer tea.</p><p>Yan Shan led Qin Sang to a cave, saying, "My humble abode.  I hope you'll be comfortable for a few days."</p><p>"Not at all. It's my pleasure," Qin Sang replied, using his energy to carve out a comfortable space with simple stone furniture.</p><p>They spent several days in easy companionship, discussing their cultivation. Qin Sang discovered Yan Shan had profound mastery of water-based techniques, extending expertly to ice-based arts. Qin Sang benefitted greatly.</p><p>Qin Sang's knowledge originated from Xuan Tian Palace.  Central Plains lacked a similar lineage. Even though Qin Sang hid his deepest secrets, Yan Shan was visibly impressed, constantly exclaiming in admiration.</p><p>The initial formality faded. When Yan Shan departed, he addressed Qin Sang as "fellow cultivator."</p><p>After Yan Shan left, Qin Sang closed the cave, sat in meditation, deep in thought.</p><p>Outside Yan Shan's cave, Yan Shan’s true form resided in a much more austere cave, already in deep meditation.</p><p>Yan Shan's cave was on the eastern side of the mountain.  Returning to his cave, he sealed the entrance. The cave was simple, but old, with only a silk cushion and an incense burner—the picture of an ascetic.</p><p>Sitting on the cushion, Yan Shan was lost in thought.  He tapped the ground with a finger. A moment later, he flicked out a strand of energy, igniting the incense.  Staring at the smoke, he produced a small, round mirror.  The mirror was almost transparent, like crystal, with simple markings.  The surface rippled like water.</p><p>Yan Shan’s reflection distorted. He touched the surface, restoring his image. Gazing at his reflection, he murmured, "It's a little early.  But, a useful assistant…"</p><p>Six months passed quickly.  During that time, Qin Sang remained on Yan Shan, only occasionally emerging to observe the snow.  More peaks were buried under snow.  It was hard to imagine the depth of the snow once the blizzard finally ended, followed by the inevitable floods; this area was one of the headwaters of the Flying Cloud River.  It was the polar opposite of the deepest part of the Western Desert.</p><p>Qin Sang learned from Yan Shan that traveling directly west would lead to the western storm zone across the land.  Central Plains had only the North, East, and South Seas. There was no West Sea. The storm zone stretched from the Western Desert to the Northern Wastes, connecting the South and North Seas.  The extreme environments along this line were likely shaped by the storm zone.  The storm zone continued far to the west, beyond what Yan Shan explored before exhaustion forced him to turn back. He did not know the boundaries of the land before the storms, likely a vast continent.  </p><p>Yan Shan claimed the deeper areas were torn apart by storms, a terrifying apocalyptic landscape.</p><p>The appointed time arrived. Qin Sang emerged, observing the lessened snowfall, though still a blizzard by common standards. He looked toward Yan Shan's cave.  Yan Shan hadn't appeared for six months, seemingly having forgotten Qin Sang's presence.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached, the barrier flickered, and Yan Shan opened the door.</p><p>"Impatient, are we?"</p><p>Yan Shan smiled, observing the sky. "The snow is manageable for now.  Let's go."</p><p>"I've been waiting for you to say that."</p><p>Qin Sang laughed. He had nothing to prepare, and immediately followed the Yan Shan elder.</p><p>The two flew away from Yan Shan.</p><p>Before leaving, the Yan Shan elder glanced back at the training grounds where he had spent many years, then turned and left.</p><p>Shortly after their departure,</p><p>a figure appeared near Yan Shan. It was the main body (Ben Zun).</p><p>Ben Zun paused slightly, then followed at a normal pace, a wisp of demonic fire swirling around his fingertips—he didn't forget to cultivate even in this situation.</p><p>The two flew side-by-side.</p><p>They soon flew beyond the mountain range.</p><p>The Yan Shan elder showed no sign of stopping, slightly adjusting their direction to travel southwest.</p><p>The Yan Shan elder explained that although the Northern Wasteland was barren and poor, it was slightly better than the depths of the Western Desert; many hermits who preferred tranquility and seclusion lived in this area.</p><p>To avoid attracting attention and complications, the two suppressed their auras and flew close to the snow surface.</p><p>Because they deliberately slowed their pace, it took them three days to reach their destination.</p><p>When the Yan Shan elder pointed it out, Qin Sang saw an unusually vast expanse of snowfield.</p><p>The entire snowfield was incredibly flat.</p><p>There seemed to be no high peaks; any low mountains were buried under the deep snow.</p><p>In such a place, without landmarks, one could only use their divine sense to search through the snow layer, inch by inch.  This inevitably risked alarming nearby cultivators or beasts.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang frown slightly, the Yan Shan elder delivered more bad news: "This entire snowfield is the territory of that snow fox."</p><p>"In that case, what difference does the snowfall make?  Senior Brother should have a way to narrow down the search area, right?" Qin Sang asked calmly.</p><p>"You have a sharp eye, Daoist Brother."</p><p>The Yan Shan elder looked around, chose a direction, and flashed his figure dozens of miles, hovering above the snow.  He formed his hand into a claw and reached down.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A claw-shaped shadow pierced the snow layer.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, who had followed closely, heard a squeaking sound.  Following the sound, he saw that the claw had unearthed a monster shaped like a mouse.</p><p>This "mouse" had a transparent body, clearly not made of flesh and blood.</p><p>The Yan Shan elder held the "mouse" in his hand, gave it to Qin Sang, and pointed below, saying, "The area beneath the snow isn't completely flat; almost half of it is filled with countless deep ravines, crisscrossing in all directions.  A cold wind blows through these ravines year-round. Although the snow covers the surface, it doesn't block the wind—it's hollow underneath.  Over the years, a special type of frost spirit, whose body is entirely composed of cold air, has been born in these winds…"</p><p>Qin Sang took it, his mind stirred. He had seen similar things during the final trial in the Seven Killing Hall's competition for the Soul-Washing Liquid.</p><p>He had encountered earth spirits, and heard there were also water and fire spirits.</p><p>These frost spirits were also naturally occurring spiritual beings, with low intelligence and driven by instinct.</p><p>But unlike the earth spirits in the Seven Killing Hall, the frost spirits were gentle and not vicious or bloodthirsty; their instincts only made them fear him, trembling in his hand.</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that the earth spirits in the Seven Killing Hall were so ferocious because they were influenced by the Hall's environment.</p><p>"The key to finding the snow fox lies with the frost spirits,"</p><p>the Yan Shan elder explained. "The snow fox has an aura that the frost spirits covet.  Especially the frost spirit leaders, who have keen senses, gather in areas where the snow fox frequently appears.  Finding the frost spirit leader can help pinpoint the snow fox. However, heavy snow is also favorable for frost spirits. When the snowfall is heaviest, the frost spirit leaders mostly emerge from the snow to play. At such times, this method cannot be used to judge location. Now the snowfall isn't heavy, so the frost spirit leaders aren't interested and should be gathering near the snow fox…"</p><p>Qin Sang understood.  "Senior Brother has gone to great lengths."</p><p>He squeezed the frost spirit in his hand. "This one isn't a leader, is it?"</p><p>The Yan Shan elder replied, "Frost spirits have all kinds of forms.  You can tell by their foreheads. Frost spirit leaders have a blue line on their forehead; the longer the line, the higher their rank."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and released the frost spirit.</p><p>He secretly summoned the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, pushing his divine ability to its limits, and looked toward the depths of the snowfield.</p><p>Night had fallen.</p><p>Across the vast snowfield, a biting wind howled and snow danced wildly.</p><p>Among the swirling snow.</p><p>Numerous illusory shadows, some leaping high, some hopping on the snow, some burrowing through it—were frost spirits of various shapes.</p><p>They danced with the snow, carefree, like sprites of the snowy night.</p>
