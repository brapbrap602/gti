<h1>Chapter 893 Reunion</h1><p>The Cloudmist Skiff came to a sudden halt, and the people ahead flew up to greet them.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qi, Fellow Daoist Hu…"</p><p>Headmaster Lu returned their greetings one by one, treating everyone equally, regardless of their cultivation level or sect's influence, including those from smaller sects.  He showed no arrogance.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Moyu has also arrived early…"</p><p>Headmaster Lu cupped his hands towards a scholar, then looked at the person beside him, asking with some confusion, "And this fellow Daoist is?"</p><p>"I am known as Mingyue. I am not a cultivator from Orchid Island, but I happened to be passing through. I heard Fellow Daoist Moyu mention the grand Dharma Assembly on Brightsight Island, and my heart yearned to attend. I have come specifically to observe. Surely, Fellow Daoist Lu won't turn me away…"</p><p>This person was Qin Sang in disguise. He knew his mask wouldn't fool the Golden Core cultivators present, but he maintained a perfectly natural demeanor.</p><p>He had sent his avatar to infiltrate the Orchid Sect while his true body searched for an opportunity.  Finally, not long ago, he befriended a Daoist companion who had a good relationship with Orchid Island: Moyu, the Mountain Lord of Inkcloud Mountain.</p><p>He interacted with Moyu sincerely, without rushing to probe for secrets.</p><p>Fellow Daoist Moyu's cultivation was similar to his own, but Qin Sang not only came from another realm, but his experiences were also vastly richer than Moyu's, who had spent his life cultivating within his sect. After a discourse on the Dao, Moyu was deeply impressed.</p><p>The two conversed with great delight.</p><p>When Qin Sang heard about the Brightsight Island Dharma Assembly, he knew it was the perfect opportunity to contact the Golden Core cultivators of the Orchid Sect, so he asked Moyu to bring him along as an observer.  Moyu readily agreed.</p><p>Qin Sang, seemingly oblivious to his avatar on the Cloudmist Skiff behind him, slightly cupped his hands and addressed Headmaster Lu with a smile.</p><p>Headmaster Lu laughed heartily. "It is our honor to have you attend, Fellow Daoist. How could we possibly refuse?"</p><p>Qin Sang revealed his true cultivation level.</p><p>A mid-stage Golden Core expert was indeed worthy of Headmaster Lu's respect.  Like the others, he seemed not to notice the mask on Qin Sang's face and made no mention of it.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled in gratitude.</p><p>"After we land, I will properly host Fellow Daoist Mingyue. Please wait a moment while we join forces to open the Brightsight Island Spirit Array," Headmaster Lu said, his expression shifting.</p><p>"Please proceed, Fellow Daoist," Qin Sang said, moving aside to make room.</p><p>The Cloudmist Skiff and other flying treasures carried the disciples of various sects to the side.</p><p>On the Cloudmist Skiff, the avatar sensed a gaze upon him. Turning his head, he saw Fang Ting and Zhao Songqiao standing on the Smokewater Pavilion's bamboo raft. He nodded slightly in acknowledgment.</p><p>Headmaster Lu hovered in midair and took out a circular disc, saying in a deep voice, "Fellow Daoists, assist me in opening the array!"</p><p>Old Daoist Huayang and the others flew to Headmaster Lu's side.</p><p>Headmaster Lu tossed the disc above them.  The cultivators from Smokewater Pavilion and other sects each took out an identical blue crystal and tossed them as well.  The crystals seamlessly embedded themselves into the recesses on the disc.</p><p>The disc then flashed with light and trembled slightly in the air.  Without needing Headmaster Lu's prompting, the others immediately channeled their True Essence, which transformed into streams of energy flowing into the disc.</p><p>Bathed in True Essence, the disc suddenly burst with brilliant light. A muffled thunderous roar echoed from afar, and towering waves surged dozens of miles to their north.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Headmaster Lu took the lead, with the others close behind.</p><p>Qin Sang followed to observe.</p><p>According to Moyu, the Brightsight Island Spirit Array was extremely intricate. Only with the complete disc and by locating the constantly shifting 'gate of life' could one open the array and reveal the island.</p><p>Headmaster Lu flew to the center of the waves and threw the now dazzling disc downwards.  Then, everyone shouted in unison, urging their True Essence with all their might.</p><p>In the next moment, the surrounding void began to distort. A shadowy form materialized on the previously empty sea surface – a small island shrouded in mist.</p><p>"What an exquisite Spirit Array!" Qin Sang couldn't help but marvel.  It was indeed a grand formation, laid down by the former Orchid Sect Master, a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mingyue, please," Moyu flew to Qin Sang's side and invited him onto the island.</p><p>The others had already flown straight towards the island.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly urged his light and arrived at Brightsight Island shortly after. He saw the dense mist part at one point, revealing a narrow valley.</p><p>The mist was likely a manifestation of the Spirit Array's power. Qin Sang felt a sense of awe and respectfully followed Moyu.</p><p>Headmaster Lu then selected a few disciples from the Cloudmist Skiff. "You will guard this place. No cultivators without Dharma Assembly tokens are allowed to enter the island."</p><p>"We obey!"</p><p>Those disciples flew to both sides of the valley, while the others passed directly through.</p><p>Soon, a cliff appeared below them, and ahead lay a deep pit, far lower than the outside world!</p><p>A thin mist shrouded the pit, obscuring the view. The terrain within was uneven, with rolling hills, but none were particularly tall.  At the very center, a single tall mountain stood prominently.</p><p>This landscape reminded Qin Sang of a meteor crater.</p><p>"That mountain must be Rising Star Mountain," Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Not far from the valley, a low mountain appeared before them.</p><p>Several elegant bamboo houses stood on the mountain, their green roofs visible through the mist, but they seemed to have been deserted for a long time.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, follow me to the Bamboo Pavilion to rest for a while.  After the others arrive, the Brightsight Island Dharma Assembly will begin at noon, with the disciples competing," Headmaster Lu said, stopping his light and turning around.</p><p>Qin Sang caught a glimpse of his avatar and the other disciples disembarking the Cloudmist Skiff, bypassing this mountain, and continuing to fly forward, quickly disappearing into the mist. He discreetly withdrew his gaze and flew into the Bamboo Pavilion.</p><p>Meanwhile, the avatar followed the Dao Child and the others, flying over several mountain peaks.</p><p>The occasional flicker of restrictive formations on these mountains indicated territories claimed by various sects. The Orchid Sect's territory was the largest, occupying almost half of Brightsight Island.</p><p>Soon, the Foundation Establishment cultivator in front paused, took out a wooden token, and waved it at a mountain peak ahead. After ripples appeared, he flew straight towards a row of stone houses on the mountain.</p><p>The houses on the mountain looked rather simple, but they wouldn't be staying there for long.</p><p>"The Dharma Assembly will begin at noon. The spiritual energy here is abundant, especially suitable for those of you cultivating the Wood Bending Scripture.  Quickly adjust your states and strive for a good ranking. It will be beneficial for you…" The cultivator landed in front of the stone houses and turned to address the others.</p><p>"Senior Brother Ruan, you participated in the last Dharma Assembly. Tell us about your experience so we can be prepared." someone called out.</p><p>The cultivator shook his head, joking, "You want to gain knowledge without sharing the spoils with me. You're always trying to boss me around.  Fine, whoever wants to listen, come in…"</p><p>He pushed open the door to a stone room and walked inside.</p><p>The Dao Child, eager for the Brightsight Island Dharma Assembly, immediately followed.</p><p>The avatar hurriedly stepped forward and whispered, "Uncle Yang, before we left, Uncle Jinyan asked me to gather some spirit materials on the island.  I need to…"</p><p>The Dao Child waved his hand impatiently, "Your cultivation is too low.  Senior Brother Ruan's experience won't be of much use to you. Go!"</p>
