<h1>Chapter 1210:  All Means Exhausted</h1><p>Chapter 1210:  All Means Exhausted</p><p>Qin Sang, fearing discovery, launched a surprise attack before even approaching the battlefield.  Therefore, none of the numerous cultivators present noticed her arrival.</p><p>In a mere instant,  Qin Sang, using her exceptional escape technique, burst onto the battlefield.</p><p>The Serpent King, the Lu cultivator, and the Ice Lizard, seasoned veterans with established teamwork, reacted instantly upon seeing Qin Sang.</p><p>The Ice Lizard summoned the snow pearl again, joining forces with the Lu cultivator to counter the evil spirit.</p><p>Just then, the evil spirit's long tail swept across.</p><p>The snow pearl spun rapidly, creating swirling snow and biting winds.</p><p>A chilling sound of cracking ice echoed…</p><p>The evil spirit's tail visibly frosted over, its movement momentarily slowed.</p><p>Simultaneously, without looking at the evil spirit, the Serpent King turned his black blade and struck at Jiang Chenzi and his companion.</p><p>Having experienced the black blade's power, Jiang Chenzi and his companion didn't dare to be negligent. They jointly activated the treasure banner before them, conjuring a blood-red sword to block the blade's might.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang silently praised them.  True top-tier experts, their timing impeccable. The Lu cultivator and Ice Lizard's attack perfectly drew the evil spirit's attention, giving her a better opportunity to strike.</p><p>Of course, their true aim was to escape quickly.  They welcomed Qin Sang's absorption of the evil spirit's attention.</p><p>Even the Serpent King didn't believe Qin Sang could easily obtain the treasure from within the evil spirit.  To seize the treasure, they had to significantly weaken the evil spirit and drive away the Zu Yuan Ying.</p><p>With Qin Sang's addition, their combined strength increased, but it still wouldn't be enough in the short term. The Lu cultivator was severely injured and was only suppressing his wounds, desperately needing a safe place to recover.</p><p>And Jiang Chenzi and his allies had undoubtedly contacted reinforcements.  If they waited any longer, other Yuan Ying from the Abyssal Ruins would arrive, and escape would become impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed these distracting thoughts.</p><p>The evil spirit was close at hand.  Facing its massive form and terrifying aura, Qin Sang felt immense pressure, a sense of suffocating dread.</p><p>Her expression remained calm, her face devoid of fear.  She coldly stared at the evil spirit, revealing her killing intent only upon arriving.</p><p>“Seven Souls Killing Array!”</p><p>A whoosh!  The spirit sword pierced the air, aimed at the evil spirit!</p><p>At this point, the battlefield was divided into three sections.</p><p>The Zu Yuan Ying, reacting belatedly after emerging from the shadows, appeared isolated and out of position.</p><p>The Serpent King faced Jiang Chenzi and his companion alone, their black blade and blood-red sword clashing.</p><p>The Ice Lizard shielded the Lu cultivator behind him, fully focusing on using the snow pearl to entangle the evil spirit's tail. Qin Sang appeared on the evil spirit's other side, her spirit sword released.</p><p>Instantly, all eyes were drawn to the sword light, a dazzling spectacle that captivated their hearts.</p><p>“Supreme-grade treasure!”</p><p>Sensing the aura emanating from the ebony sword, this thought resonated in everyone's minds, causing varied reactions.</p><p>The Serpent King was particularly astonished.</p><p>He knew Qin Sang possessed an array banner comparable in power to a supreme-grade treasure, and now she had produced a supreme-grade flying sword; a true treasure trove.</p><p>Could a newly ascended demon king possess such wealth?</p><p>He had spent years, countless effort, to refine the black blade to the level of a supreme-grade treasure.</p><p>“The Thousand Mountain Bamboo Sea has such deep foundations!”</p><p>The Serpent King pondered, attributing it to the enigmatic bamboo demon, the master of the Bright Moon Demon King.</p><p>The evil spirit sensed the hostility directed at it. Its massive head turned, fixating on Qin Sang, the instigator. Its eyes blazed with ferocious intent, radiating boundless killing aura.</p><p>It hated the Serpent King and the others, but that didn't mean it wouldn't retaliate against other attacks; otherwise, Jiang Chenzi and his companion wouldn't have been so cautious.</p><p>A roar!</p><p>Enraged, the evil spirit's attention was captivated by Qin Sang, deciding to obliterate this audacious ant from existence.</p><p>Its head lunged forward, fangs bared, completely ignoring the ebony sword.  A green light flashed in its throat; one strike would end Qin Sang's life.</p><p>Having witnessed this move's power during her observation, Qin Sang was prepared. Knowing she couldn't allow the evil spirit to land a blow, she instantly altered her sword technique, causing the ebony sword to split into countless sword lights.</p><p>The sword light flowed like water.</p><p>In an instant, the sword array materialized.</p><p>In that moment, the blood-red light cast a shadow across the space.</p><p>A gray mist enveloped the evil spirit, as if night had fallen, shrouded in a gray veil.</p><p>The light was incredibly dim.  All sword lights vanished from sight, even the ebony sword itself merging into the sword array, making it invisible and exceptionally mysterious, inscrutable.</p><p>A closer look reveals countless fine, grey threads crisscrossing within the sword formation, constantly shifting and changing.  Sensory perception causes a slight stinging sensation.</p><p>The evil spirit is enveloped by the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang, using the Seven Souls Killing Formation at full power, leaves nothing back.</p><p>This is a one-time opportunity. Though lacking intelligence, the evil spirit retains instinct. Having learned from a previous encounter, it now evades and counterattacks, making it much harder to lure it into the formation again.</p><p>Against this spirit, the Seven Souls Killing Formation is far more effective than the methods of Han Lixu and the others.</p><p>The pain causes the evil spirit to rage, momentarily dimming the nascent green light in its mouth, interrupting its attack for a split second.</p><p>That split second is enough!</p><p>Qin Sang rejoices inwardly.  With a flap of his wings, he swiftly approaches the evil spirit.  He then throws out his sleeve, unleashing twelve prepared demonic banners that rapidly spin and embed themselves deep within the evil spirit.</p><p>'Whoosh... whoosh...'</p><p>A torrent of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire erupts from the banners.  Before coalescing, the fire resembles black tentacles piercing the evil spirit's form.</p><p>This Netherworld fire is effective against such spiritual entities.</p><p>Qin Sang's daring attack relies on the Seven Souls Killing Formation and the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire. Otherwise, prioritizing his own safety, he would have either continued observing, waiting for another opportunity, or given up entirely.</p><p>At most, out of loyalty to the Serpent King, he might have restrained a couple of Abyss Nascent Souls, creating a chance for escape, but he wouldn't dare engage the evil spirit directly.</p><p>This is the Abyssal Ruins, deep within the Abyss; several Nascent Souls could appear at any moment and trap them here.</p><p>'Hiss... hiss...'</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, clinging like a parasite, ‘burns through’ the evil spirit's body in the astonished gaze of the onlookers, reaching its core and engulfing the piece of white bronze.</p><p>"He's really taking the treasure from within the evil spirit!"</p><p>The onlookers are stunned.</p><p>The next moment, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, having enveloped the white bronze, retreats like a receding wave. The white bronze shows no reaction, carried by the fire towards the Serpent King's body.</p><p>Although the stone axe and blood jade are nearby, Qin Sang hesitates not at all before retracting the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, seemingly ignoring them completely.</p><p>A pure spiritual light erupts from the evil spirit's body, rapidly healing its wounds.  The remaining Netherworld Fire within is consumed by this light, struggling to escape, finally managing to bring the white bronze out just before being extinguished.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang wasn't greedy, or even the white bronze would have been lost.</p>
