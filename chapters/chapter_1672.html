<h1>Chapter 1663: The Reappearance of the Spirit Pill</h1><p>Their divine senses brushed, and Venom King, understanding what had transpired, revealed a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p>A demonic wind surged, forming a swirling vortex.  Gu insects, like serpents swimming through the void, swayed their lithe bodies and changed direction.  Simultaneously, the demonic wind darkened, and a black droplet seeped out, instantly exploding into a small cloud of black smoke. It grazed past Master Huaiyin and fiercely assaulted Kundao.</p><p>The rolling smoke, with astonishing speed, surged forward with a whistling sound.</p><p>With Venom King's protection, Master Huaiyin, free from immediate worries, swiftly retreated from the battlefield.</p><p>Kundao, at some point, opened his eyes, fixated on Master Huaiyin's retreating figure. He saw that Master Huaiyin's helper had arrived, and although Master Huaiyin's breath was ragged, he still appeared vigorous and full of life.</p><p>Not only did the internal injuries not erupt, but flesh buds grew at a visible rate at the wound sites, as if they were about to heal completely.</p><p>Kundao took one last deep look at Master Huaiyin before closing his eyes once more.</p><p>Su Zinan and Qin Sang cursed inwardly.</p><p>The smoke seemed to be directed at Kundao, but who could guarantee Venom King wouldn't have ulterior motives? They were approaching Kundao and were also within the smoke's attack range.</p><p>This cloud of smoke had no peculiar odor, appearing ordinary. However, considering Venom King's notoriety, they knew it couldn't be simple; it must be a type of poisonous smoke.</p><p>Qin Sang, with the Celestial Eye Butterfly's assistance, still had the capacity to observe his surroundings. He saw that the smoke originated from a spirit insect within the demonic wind.</p><p>The spirit insect had a slender body, covered in绒毛(fine hairs), a caterpillar.</p><p>This appearance was far too common.</p><p>Qin Sang could instantly think of dozens of similar spirit insects, but he couldn't determine its species in such a short time. Moreover, Venomous Mire Mountain specialized in Gu cultivation, making the spirit insects even harder to identify after being subjected to Gu refinement techniques.</p><p>However, seeing the spirit insect's fine hairs, Qin Sang suddenly felt a sense of familiarity. They were very similar to the fine hairs Venomous Mire Mountain had given him before, but also somewhat different. The spirit insect's fine hairs were more delicate and less lustrous.</p><p>According to the Seven Fragrance Pavilion's Pavilion Master, the fine hairs were taken from Venomous Mire Mountain's sacred artifact. This spirit insect must be closely related to that artifact.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man had been afflicted by the Venomous Mire Mountain sacred artifact's poison for over a century without being able to purge the residual poison, showing just how potent it was. Venom King's Gu insects were likely not much different.</p><p>Not daring to be careless, Qin Sang diverted a sliver of his divine sense to activate the Poison Pearl, coating his body with a layer of poison-repelling armor. With a flick of his wrist, three divine birds flapped their wings, taking flight from the tree trunk and merging into one.</p><p>The aura of Southern Bright Ember Fire clashed with the Nine Abyss Earth Magnetism.</p><p>Magnetic light and spiritual fire collided, yet also intermingled, forming a sky-reaching blaze around the Sun Divine Bird. It was a wondrous spectacle, its power even more astonishing.</p><p>Although no visible actions could be seen from Su Zinan, his robes billowed, revealing another layer of faint blood-red light.  He stared at Kundao, his lips moving slightly, muttering incantations.</p><p>As he cast the incantations, the death seal on Kundao's chest grew increasingly crimson, sinking little by little, as if it was about to be imprinted directly onto Kundao's internal organs.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang and Su Zinan saw Kundao close his eyes, as if he had given up struggling.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Wherever the Sun Divine Bird passed, flames surged, its might unparalleled.</p><p>Just as Kundao was about to be engulfed by the flames, Qin Sang's expression abruptly changed. He saw the fissures around Kundao expand wildly, instantly transforming into a black hole. It seemed to possess an infinite suction force, pulling Kundao's figure down!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black hole was just the beginning. The Nine Abyss Earth Magnetism went haywire, and an astonishingly violent force rapidly spread, shattering the void!</p><p>In an instant, magnetic light formed a storm, and countless fissures were born within it. Like giant serpents and pythons, they charged in all directions. Qin Sang and Su Zinan felt their bodies tighten, realizing they were already enveloped by the magnetic storm.</p><p>Kundao, by shattering the divine restriction, had escaped, causing the Nine Abyss Earth Magnetism to go berserk.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly. Kundao could do far too much within the Five Elements Divine Restriction, even escaping a desperate situation with this method. Knowing it was futile, Qin Sang withdrew the divine sense controlling the Sun Divine Bird.</p><p>The Sun Divine Bird immediately exploded, spiritual fire soaring into the sky, quickly swallowed by the chaotic magnetic storm. Also dispersed was Venom King's poisonous smoke.</p><p>Su Zinan also felt the death seal slip from his control and could only withdraw his incantations.</p><p>Qin Sang was at the center of the magnetic storm, surrounded by fissures. Although it was perilous, escaping wasn't difficult. By going with the flow and choosing a fissure, he could leave the divine restriction.</p><p>At this moment, he felt an inexplicable suction force trying to pull him into one of the fissures.</p><p>Whether it was Kundao's doing or a change within the divine restriction itself, Qin Sang couldn't let it happen. He controlled the Mani Pearl with a sliver of his divine sense, vibrating the罡火罩(True Fire Shield) to resist the suction.</p><p>Glancing around, his Celestial Eye penetrated the darkness, vaguely discerning the scene outside the fissures.</p><p>The scenes were all different: some were blue stone steps, some were cliff faces, and some were sections of walls. The perspective was consistent, clearly the interior of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, enveloped by the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Different fissures led to different locations.</p><p>The Five Elements Divine Restriction wasn't a true void restriction, so these locations shouldn't be too far apart.</p><p>Old fissures merged into larger ones, and new fissures constantly appeared.  The corresponding locations were not fixed, shifting and changing like fleeting images.</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced, but he didn't rush to escape. He struggled to maneuver within the magnetic storm, shifting his gaze upwards.</p><p>The treasures that had been blasted away by Master Huaiyin were also scattered. Having already been battered repeatedly, they now suffered the impact of the magnetic storm. The small jade sword burst with a dazzling white light.</p><p>Within the white light, the jade sword broke into two, its power exhausted, turning to dust.</p><p>Of the two long swords, one was swept away by the magnetic storm, its location unknown. The other hadn't flown far, but it was the female cultivator's sword, most likely her natal spirit sword.</p><p>Qin Sang focused on another small sword, a golden sword. It was more durable than the jade sword, but the light on its blade flickered unsteadily, clearly unable to last much longer.</p><p>The magnetic storm intensified, making maneuvering even more difficult. Qin Sang no longer hesitated, flashing towards the golden sword.</p><p>‘Bang, bang, bang…’</p><p>The True Fire Shield vibrated violently.</p><p>Qin Sang increased his speed, moving like a phantom, brushing past fissures.  As he neared the golden sword, he was about to snatch it.</p><p>At that moment, a black light suddenly leaped from a fissure. It was the female cultivator's other relic—the black jade box.</p><p>The black jade box had fallen into a fissure, but the chaotic magnetic force had shaken it out.</p><p>The restrictions on the box were severely damaged, and the lid slightly ajar. A milky white light spilled out, revealing a spirit pill, still intact under the protection of the remaining restrictions!</p><p>It was a Boiling Snow Pill!</p><p>This pill was useless to Kundao, so she hadn't swallowed it. She had intended to use it as bait if the spirit swords weren't enticing enough, though now it was unnecessary.</p><p>The spirit pill appeared.</p><p>However, it wasn't just Qin Sang who saw it. Su Zinan also saw it, and he was closer!</p><p>Su Zinan had just retrieved a sword and was about to take the female cultivator's sword as well. Seeing the pill, he changed his target without hesitation. Blood light erupted from his palm, transforming into a giant blood-red hand, clawing at the pill.</p><p>Just as the blood hand was about to grasp the spirit pill, a strange ‘hum-ha’ sound suddenly echoed in Su Zinan's mind.  His nascent soul stung, and the blood hand involuntarily paused.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a heavenly thunder heavily struck the spirit pill, shattering it instantly.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>Su Zinan's eyes widened in fury, watching helplessly as the Boiling Snow Pill turned to ash.</p><p>Qin Sang, ignoring Su Zinan's rage, retrieved the golden sword and escaped into a fissure. It was better to destroy the Boiling Snow Pill than to let Su Zinan obtain it!</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the magnetic storm, Master Huaiyin and Venom King retreated continuously.</p><p>Master Huaiyin was resolute. Neither the alluring treasures of the female cultivator nor Kundao, with whom he had a mortal enmity, could change his decision.</p><p>He charged outwards without looking back, avoiding being caught in the magnetic storm.</p><p>Master Huaiyin knew his own limitations. Although he could escape through the fissures of the divine restriction, being sent into the Five Elements Divine Restriction's interior would be extremely detrimental to his current state.</p><p>Venom King recalled his Gu insects, protecting Master Huaiyin's flanks.</p><p>The two retreated further and further.</p><p>The interior of the magnetic storm was completely invisible, yet Venom King continued to stare at it, lost in thought.</p><p>“This humble monk overestimated himself, nearly losing his life here.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin pressed his palms together and bowed to Venom King, expressing his gratitude.</p><p>Venom King withdrew his gaze, accepting the bow, and inquired about the situation.  Learning of Master Huaiyin's decision to leave, he hesitated for a moment, then said, “I will escort you down the mountain.”</p><p>By now, Master Huaiyin's wounds had mostly recovered, with only a small area of exposed flesh. Bone fragments and blood vessels were no longer visible.</p><p>The flesh buds at the wound continued to grow, quickly covering the injured area. Golden light flowed, completing the healing.</p><p>A miraculous skill!</p><p>Venom King watched, stunned by Master Huaiyin's powerful regenerative ability.  However, he also understood that the wounds were merely superficial; the underlying damage wouldn't heal so easily.</p><p>There was no such miraculous technique in the world, and even if there were, it would come at a tremendous cost.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's aura was waning. The secret technique must have a time limit; otherwise, he wouldn't have readily retreated.</p><p>After some consideration, Venom King decided to personally escort Master Huaiyin down the mountain, offering a favor. He had already grasped the workings of the sword formation, and a round trip wouldn't take long.</p><p>In this operation to corner the Strange-Faced Man, it was with Master Huaiyin's assistance that Venom King had dared to claim certain victory.  Now, with their powerful ally severely injured, they would have to reconsider their plans.</p><p>With this favor, the relationship between them would no longer be purely transactional.</p><p>If the Strange-Faced Man escaped, could Master Huaiyin refuse another request for assistance?</p><p>Furthermore, Venom King had been inspired by Kundao.</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain was a chaotic mix of righteous and demonic cultivators, a battlefield between opposing forces. Perhaps this could be exploited; he could sit back and watch the tigers fight, waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p><p>Retreating now was, in fact, a strategic withdrawal.</p><p>Waiting for chaos to erupt on the mountain before returning to reap the rewards was a clever plan.</p><p>“Thank you, fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin expressed his shame but didn't decline the offer.</p><p>Although the magnetic storm had disrupted the area, they could determine the way out by judging the strength of the Nine Abyss Earth Magnetism.  The two identified their direction and set off.</p><p>As they flew, Master Huaiyin recounted the details of the encounter, “That Su Zinan and the Fire Devil are formidable opponents. The Fire Devil's protective true fire shield was brimming with demonic energy, yet strangely infused with Buddhist intent, reminding this humble monk of the Shamanic Divine Ability, the Golden Bell Shield. Truly bizarre. Although Su Zinan deliberately concealed it, this humble monk detected a discordant aura from within him, unsure of its origin…”</p><p>Even in dire straits, Master Huaiyin remained observant.</p><p>He spoke of Kundao again, this time in even greater detail, warning Venom King of her ruthlessness and urging him to be extremely cautious.</p><p>Venom King nodded and asked a few questions in return, focusing on Qin Sang.</p><p>In the heat of the moment, the information he had obtained was limited, and Master Huaiyin couldn't offer much more.</p><p>Under the protection of Venom King and his Gu insects, the female cultivator didn't reappear, and the two successfully escaped the Nine Abyss Earth Magnetism, reaching the outer Five Elements Restriction.</p><p>Venom King dutifully escorted Master Huaiyin all the way out of the Mist Tide Formation.</p><p>Stepping out of the jade gate,</p><p>The two looked outwards in unison.</p><p>To the east of Emperor Bestowal Mountain, according to Su Zinan, were the Metal Phase Hall and Earth Phase Hall. Restrictive formations fluctuated there, indicating that someone was breaking the formations in search of treasures.</p><p>An even greater commotion was coming from the southwest of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>From afar, they could see streaks of escaping light flashing between the mountains. A large number of cultivators had entered the legacy realm and were heading towards them, the fastest already more than halfway there.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please return. Don't delay your important matters.”</p><p>Master Huaiyin stopped.</p><p>Venom King was worried about Kundao's return.</p><p>Master Huaiyin shook his head, standing tall and composed, saying calmly, “That woman's abilities are mediocre, relying entirely on the Five Elements Divine Restriction to bolster her power. If she dares to pursue us outside the mountain, this humble monk will ensure she doesn't return!”</p><p>“Cultivators from the Formless Immortal Sect and various other sects are gathering.  Master, perhaps you should find a safe place here to heal your injuries…”</p><p>Seeing his confidence, Venom King didn't insist, cupping his hands in farewell.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, however, noticed Venom King's preoccupation along the way and spoke frankly, "Fellow Daoist, if you have something on your mind, please speak freely."</p><p>Venom King hesitated for a moment, then asked, “Master, do you believe Su Zinan and the Fire Devil have the ability to eliminate that scoundrel and Old Ghost Qiling?”</p><p>Master Huaiyin paused, lost in thought.</p><p>“This King also finds it far-fetched,” Venom King shook his head.  “That scoundrel and Old Ghost Qiling are birds of a feather.  At the very least, they wouldn't have perished here. But having entered the mountain for so long, there's still no trace of them. That scoundrel claims to be a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect, but he only stumbled upon a few scriptures. Could he be faster than Purple Thunder Old Daoist and the other old devils, true descendants who are ignoring the vulnerable Metal Phase Divine Restriction?"</p><p>Bright stars appeared in the sword formation. If the Strange-Faced Man were inside, he couldn't miss them.</p><p>“If… fellow Daoist suspects someone, who is it?”</p><p>Master Huaiyin asked in return.</p><p>“That female cultivator is elusive and has the advantage of terrain.  Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao are working together, both are possibilities. However, this King believes the Fire Devil also deserves attention.”</p><p>Venom King beckoned the Gu insect hovering above, stroking it gently. “Just now, to assist Master, I prompted it to expel a puff of Soul Extinguishing Smoke.  Later, the poisonous smoke was dispersed by the magnetic storm, greatly diminishing its potency. Even Su Zinan had to avoid it slightly, but the Fire Devil seemed rather unfazed…  One must know that scoundrel's foundation was built in Venomous Mire Mountain, his divine abilities mostly based on poison techniques. If the Fire Devil has a method to counter poison techniques, it would be equivalent to crippling him by half. According to Su Zinan, that scoundrel and Old Ghost Qiling acted separately. If he provoked the Fire Devil alone, one can imagine his fate.”</p><p>Connecting the various clues, Venom King was getting closer to the truth.</p><p>Master Huaiyin shook his head after listening. "These are merely speculations, fellow Daoist."</p><p>“Indeed, they are this King’s speculations, but not baseless.  They can be verified later.”</p><p>Venom King withdrew his Gu insect, bid farewell to Master Huaiyin, and returned to the mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang and Su Zinan were thrown out of the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p><p>Venom King and Master Huaiyin descended the mountain.</p><p>Only Mo Xingdao remained within the Nine Abyss Earth Magnetism.</p><p>He waited outside, soon sensing the raging magnetic storm; a great battle must have taken place inside.</p><p>Mo Xingdao didn't intend to get involved and retreated continuously.</p><p>After waiting for some time, the magnetic storm peaked and began to subside. Still, Su Zinan didn't emerge. Mo Xingdao noticed the fissures within the storm and guessed Su Zinan wasn't so easily killed and might have entered one.</p><p>He pondered briefly, then returned to the Seven Constellations Domain Sword Formation, found its core, and passed through the Five Elements Divine Restriction.</p>
