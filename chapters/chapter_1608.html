<h1>Chapter 1599: Natural Talent</h1><p>The Sky-Pupil Butterfly overcame its fear, gently vibrating its wings, and landed on the ground in front of Qin Sang, reverting to its original form.</p><p>From a small, delicate butterfly, it instantly transformed into a large swallowtail. The beautiful patterns on its wings, resembling phoenix plumes, were breathtakingly beautiful.  Qin Sang felt a sense of wonder every time he saw it.</p><p>Its long tail-like appendages touched the ground, extending all the way to the door.  The cave dwelling could barely contain it.</p><p>The Sky-Pupil Butterfly's wings slowly opened and closed. Its sky-pupils emitted a strange light, converging in the void and forming a ring of light, encasing the strand of energy.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped cultivating and focused on the Sky-Pupil Butterfly's transformation.</p><p>The ring of light was unstable, carrying the energy as it stumbled back to the Sky-Pupil Butterfly.</p><p>The butterfly had already raised its wings, and the energy was precisely sandwiched between its two sky-pupils.  Then, astonishingly, the energy was devoured bit by bit by the sky-pupils.</p><p>During the devouring process, the Sky-Pupil Butterfly trembled all over, clearly not finding it easy.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense that the Sky-Pupil Butterfly had not yet absorbed this energy.</p><p>Although the Sky-Pupil Butterfly was a spirit insect, it couldn't directly absorb the energy. It could only rely on its sky-pupils' natural counter to the Immortal Amber Dragon-Bee to seal the energy within its sky-pupils, and then undergo a refining process.</p><p>This process might be even slower than his own.</p><p>Understanding the situation, Qin Sang chuckled softly.  Fortunately, he didn't need to refine the Near-Dragon Saliva immediately, so he could meet the Sky-Pupil Butterfly's time requirements.</p><p>"By absorbing the energy of a Fifth Transformation spirit insect, the Sky-Pupil Butterfly should undergo some welcome changes, right?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Sky-Pupil Butterfly with great anticipation.</p><p>The Sky-Pupil Butterfly was a constant worry for him.</p><p>Based on his experience, before reaching the peak of late Nascent Soul and attempting to break through to Deity Transformation, he needed to cultivate his essence, energy, and spirit, as well as the Sky-Pupil Butterfly, to their peak states.</p><p>His divine sense would definitely be the fastest to meet the requirements.</p><p>For body refinement, he had the *Celestial Demon Body Tempering Art*. As long as he put in the time, he would eventually improve.</p><p>The most troublesome was the Sky-Pupil Butterfly. Its cultivation speed was too slow, always lukewarm. If he hadn't learned the Spirit Ascension Ritual Secret Art in the Hundred Flowers Valley, it might still be stuck in the early stages of the Fourth Transformation.</p><p>Finally, an opportunity had arrived!</p><p>Man and insect faced each other.</p><p>In the cave dwelling, they each busied themselves with their own affairs, without disturbing each other.</p><p>……</p><p>Qin Sang seemed to have forgotten about the Meteorite Divine Whip.</p><p>Once he began cultivating, he completely lost track of time.</p><p>A month after the Treasure Exchange Conference, Jiang Mu sent a message talisman. He later sent people twice more.  Seeing that the message talismans were still trapped by the restrictions at the cave entrance, he stopped disturbing Qin Sang.</p><p>Ten years passed in a flash.</p><p>The cave restrictions, silent for ten years, suddenly fluctuated. A figure slowly walked out.</p><p>Ten years of arduous cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang had completely mastered the Thousand-Knot Divine Net, and made significant progress in the *Fire Seed Golden Lotus*. He was ready to begin refining the Demonic Fire Origin. The chances of success were high, and the future was promising.</p><p>The Sky-Pupil Butterfly's cultivation was also steadily improving as it absorbed the Near-Dragon Saliva.</p><p>Everything was developing in a positive direction.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of his avatar and decided to return to the Clear Void Illusion Realm to check on its progress.  Feeling refreshed, he walked out of the cave dwelling and saw the restriction's shimmering light barrier.</p><p>Dozens of various message talismans were trapped by the light barrier, hovering motionless.</p><p>Qin Sang stretched out his hand, and the light barrier vanished. The message talismans vibrated slightly and flew into his palm.</p><p>Most of them contained useless information.</p><p>Some were sent by cultivators he had befriended at Flying Cloud Ferry, inviting him to discuss the Dao or to explore secret realms and search for treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang skimmed through them, picking out the ones sent by Jiang Mu. After reading them, he quickly walked towards the Section B area.</p><p>Section B was the area where merchant guilds gathered, and the Six Provinces Hall was no exception.</p><p>The Six Provinces Hall was bustling with activity.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal himself. As soon as he reached the front of the Six Provinces Hall, he saw Jiang Mu hurriedly walking out, with a wry smile on his face. He bowed slightly and said, "Fellow Daoist Qin, you've kept me in the dark!"</p><p>They had become acquainted at Smokewater Market, and Qin Sang hadn't revealed his true cultivation level.</p><p>Jiang Mu had held Qin Sang in high regard, thinking he was at most mid-Nascent Soul. He never expected that he was an unknown grand cultivator.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist never asked, so it wasn't a deliberate concealment," Qin Sang replied with a smile, returning the bow.</p><p>Jiang Mu shook his head repeatedly, gesturing for Qin Sang to enter the Six Provinces Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang initially thought Jiang Mu would subtly inquire about his identity.  Grand cultivators in the world all had names and reputations. The sudden appearance of an unknown one would certainly arouse curiosity.</p><p>After the Treasure Exchange Conference, he had killed the Crocodile Demon, using a rarely seen divine ability.</p><p>The Six Provinces Hall should have some conjectures.</p><p>Jiang Mu, however, was tactful and didn't mention it. Instead, he took the initiative to ask about the Meteorite Divine Whip. "Ten years ago, this junior, following Fellow Daoist Qin's instructions, purchased the Meteorite Divine Whip. It's been kept here with me.  Fellow Daoist Qin is here to retrieve it, correct?"</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>Qin Sang was also straightforward. "Has your esteemed Hall investigated the origins of the Meteorite Divine Whip?"</p><p>Jiang Mu sighed. "Fellow Daoist, this request has put us in a difficult position… Please follow me, and you'll understand."</p><p>Dismissing everyone else, Jiang Mu led Qin Sang into the back hall. They passed through several pavilions and corridors and entered a secluded courtyard.  He knocked on the door of a quiet chamber.</p><p>"What's with the knocking! If I don't let you in, can you still not enter?" A shouting voice came from inside the quiet chamber, clearly displeased.</p><p>Jiang Mu smiled faintly and pushed the door open. "This old man was worried about disturbing your cultivation, young friend."</p><p>Qin Sang followed him inside.</p><p>The quiet chamber wasn't large, and everything was visible at a glance.</p><p>It was a fire chamber for refining tools. Since Flying Cloud Ferry was suspended above the lake, it didn't use underground fire veins but a special spiritual fire specifically for tool refining.</p><p>The fire seed was a dim yellow flame, advantageous for its gentle nature and ease of control.</p><p>On the shelves against the wall were jade slips, ancient books, and tool refining materials.</p><p>There was only one long-haired young man in the quiet chamber.  He was at mid-Gold Core realm, considered a master in Zhong Zhou, but he was unkempt, holding an ancient book and sitting carelessly on the floor.</p><p>When they entered, the young man didn't even look up.  He spoke to Jiang Mu without any politeness, sneering and saying sarcastically, "Senior Jiang has taken the trouble.  This is indeed a good place for quiet cultivation! This young master has been imprisoned by you for ten years. Senior Jiang has finally remembered me.  Have you figured out how to deal with me yet?"</p><p>He still couldn't understand how he had offended the Six Provinces Hall.</p><p>Knowing escape was hopeless and that he couldn't fight against the Six Provinces Hall alone, he decided to indulge in some verbal sparring.</p><p>Jiang Mu wasn't annoyed, smiling at the young man.  "For these ten years, we not only provided young friend with numerous tool refining secret manuals, but also various spiritual materials for practice, and purchased the finished products at a high price. That's not mistreating you, is it?"</p><p>The young man threw the ancient book down, furious. "Ten years of imprisonment, for no reason! If it were Senior Jiang, could you bear it so readily? The world says the Six Provinces Hall trades with integrity and righteousness, but who knows they're all hypocrites, bullying this young master because I'm a rogue cultivator with no backing!"</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, this young friend Shen Chen is the owner of the Meteorite Divine Whip, and he personally refined it."</p><p>Jiang Mu ushered Qin Sang in.</p><p>Knowing Qin Sang was a grand cultivator, the Six Provinces Hall didn't dare to be negligent.  After weighing their options and analyzing the situation, they concluded that Qin Sang's goal was likely the treasure and wouldn't escalate things beyond control.</p><p>Paying a small price to befriend a grand cultivator was worthwhile.</p><p>They secretly sent people to find the owner of the Meteorite Divine Whip and invited him to Flying Cloud Ferry.</p><p>The young man was startled, looking at Qin Sang with uncertainty. Only then did he realize that it wasn't the Six Provinces Hall dealing with him, but this mysterious person.</p><p>The Six Provinces Hall actually acted on this person's orders. Just who was he?</p><p>Qin Sang was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Because the young man's realm was lower than he expected, having just recently broken through to mid-Gold Core.  When he refined the Meteorite Divine Whip, his cultivation might have been even lower.</p><p>He had initially thought the person who refined the Meteorite Divine Whip was at least late Gold Core!</p><p>Unless he had exceptional talent, a tool refiner's ability was also closely related to their cultivation.</p><p>The Demon Binding Rope was something that could suppress Jade Bone Demons.</p><p>Although the Meteorite Divine Whip only borrowed part of the power of the Demon Binding Rope fragments and didn't involve the core spiritual formation, the young man being able to refine a complete and usable magical treasure was quite impressive.</p><p>"Where did you obtain the meteorite fragments on the Meteorite Divine Whip?" Qin Sang didn't avoid Jiang Mu and directly asked Shen Chen.</p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Mu stood to the side.</p><p>He was also very curious about what kind of treasure the meteorite was that almost caused the grand cultivator to lose his composure.</p><p>After the Treasure Exchange Conference, the Hall Master and others held a trial, examining the Meteorite Divine Whip over and over. They could only determine that the meteorite fragments were extraordinary and not a contemporary treasure, but couldn't figure out anything else.</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was gentle.</p><p>Shen Chen, however, felt an inexplicable fear towards him.  Knowing his life and death were in this person's hands, he didn't dare to be as unrestrained as before, honestly answering, "In Southern Man Zhou, inside a sinkhole."</p><p>Jiang Mu interjected, "We sent people to Man Zhou. The sinkhole's location isn't far from the South Sea. We didn't find other fragments near the sinkhole, but after analysis, the sinkhole doesn't seem to be naturally formed."</p><p>He observed Qin Sang's expression as he spoke.</p><p>"There are two speculations. First, it might truly be a meteorite from the heavens, creating the sinkhole upon impact. Second, there might have been a battle between powerful beings nearby, altering the terrain. The meteorite might be fragments of some unique treasure that shattered. We lean towards the second possibility. There's always been a legend that a world-shaking battle took place in Southern Man and Nan Zhou, which is why they're now riddled with scars…"</p><p>Southern Man and Nan Zhou again!</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred upon hearing this.</p><p>The Demon Binding Rope fragments landed in Man Zhou.</p><p>The Gu God Cult spread its doctrines in Southern Man and Nan Zhou, and the scriptures described the South Sea Immortal Palace as a Pure Land.</p><p>Southern Man and Nan Zhou held many secrets!</p><p>His avatar still had the Gu God Token given by the Gu God Cult.</p><p>Previously, first, his main body was at a crucial juncture in its breakthrough, and later, his avatar was in closed-door cultivation, practicing the *Ice Soul Divine Light*, and he couldn't spare the time. He hadn't contacted the Gu God Cult.  Should he take the initiative to contact them?</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind.  Without revealing anything, he raised his left hand, his fingers imbued with spiritual light, drawing runes in the void, forming the outline of a spiritual formation.</p><p>This was something his senior sister and Bai had comprehended, a spiritual formation used in conjunction with activating the Demon Binding Rope.  Qin Sang only revealed a small part.</p><p>"Recognize this?" Qin Sang asked the young man.</p><p>Shen Chen raised his head, staring at the spiritual formation for a moment.  His mouth opened wider and wider, unable to tear his eyes away, a look of enchantment on his face, forgetting to answer.</p><p>Jiang Mu wanted to wake him up, but Qin Sang waved his hand to stop him.</p><p>After a stick of incense burned.</p><p>Shen Chen suddenly cried out in pain, clutching his head, his cries filled with agony.</p><p>"This formation far surpasses your current realm. You can comprehend it, but it's best not to try to visualize the runes with your divine sense and arrange the formation within your Purple Mansion," Qin Sang saw what was happening and offered a warning.</p><p>The pain subsided, and Shen Chen was still shaken. He thanked him in a low voice, "Thank you, Senior, for the warning."</p><p>After a pause, he couldn't help but ask, "Is this formation…from the same source as the meteorite fragments?"</p><p>"You haven't seen it before?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed slightly.</p><p>If this kid hadn't seen the spiritual formation before and could discern the connection between the two in such a short time, he truly had remarkable talent, no wonder he could refine the Meteorite Divine Whip.</p><p>Shen Chen shook his head. "This junior only found a few fragments back then, and didn't discover anything else."</p><p>Qin Sang carefully inquired again, confirming that this was all the young man knew. He exchanged a glance with Jiang Mu, tossed a bag of spirit stones to Shen Chen, and was about to leave when he suddenly stopped.</p><p>"You said earlier, you're a rogue cultivator?" Qin Sang looked Shen Chen up and down.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's gaze, Shen Chen felt uncomfortable all over.  He didn't dare to hide anything, explaining everything, "This junior had a master when I was young, from a small sect.  Because my master offended a powerful figure within the sect, we were both expelled.  My master later met with an accident and died from serious injuries. This junior, by chance, learned the art of tool refining, making a living by refining magical tools for others. Bit by bit, I managed to become self-sufficient.  Unwilling to be bound, I haven't joined another sect…"</p><p>Jiang Mu saw Qin Sang's intention and added, "Young Friend Shen's talent in tool refining is evident to us all. This Jiang has always had the thought, after this matter is settled, to invite Young Friend Shen to join the Six Provinces Hall.  It's a pity Fellow Daoist Qin has beaten me to it!"</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>Happy New Year everyone, wishing you all the best!</p>
