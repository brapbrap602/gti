Chapter 209: Ghostly Hand


‘Hiss…hiss…’
The Centipede moved back and forth, its antennae touching the ground, when suddenly it stopped at a spot. Its mouth opened wide, tearing at the rock and burrowing into the ground.
Yin Xingge was prepared and immediately cast a spiritual power spell to seal off the Centipede. Checking it, he noticed that the Star Disk's power there was already very thin, so he had to use his own cloud tool to cover up the area, then sacrifice a spiritual sword and cut into the ground.
The ground was extremely hard, and with Yin Xingge's cultivation, the cutting speed was also very slow. After digging for a while, he only found a piece of dry yang quartz and nothing else.
Yin Xingge released the Centipede, and the Centipede tried to burrow into the ground again.
Gradually, a crevice several dozen meters deep was dug out of the ground, and still nothing was found. Yin Xingge began to get a little impatient and frowned. After thinking for a moment, he reached into his mustard seed bag and sent out several rays of light, all of which were various kinds of spiritual swords.
Under Yin Xingge's control, the spiritual swords moved together, their sword energy like a wheel, and they quickly began to cut into the ground.
The crevice got deeper and deeper, and the soil and rocks below became increasingly dark, as if they could devour the light, appearing somewhat sinister and strange. For some reason, Yin Xingge suddenly felt a sense of unease in his heart.
Yin Xingge's brows were slightly furrowed, and he looked around cautiously. The surroundings were eerily quiet, and he found nothing unusual. He could not help but smile at himself in self-deprecation.
However, before the smile could disappear from Yin Xingge's face, a strange ‘kaka’ sound suddenly came from underground.
Yin Xingge was startled, and he suddenly lowered his head, staring at the ground.
He saw that the extremely hard soil and rocks were beginning to ripple like water, and then there were countless convex imprints, as if countless strange hands had been awakened and were about to break the seal from the inside out, which was extremely strange.
‘Boom!’
The soil and rocks suddenly exploded, and rubble flew everywhere.
In an instant, a thick demonic energy spread out, and there seemed to be countless ghostly shadows within the demonic energy.
Yin Xingge was shocked, his spiritual power flashed, and his figure became blurry. Just as he was about to vanish on the spot, a withered hand suddenly protruded from the demonic energy, grabbed Yin Xingge's ankle, and abruptly yanked him out of the illusion.
The ghostly hand was ice-cold!
...
‘Bang!’
A jade Buddha suddenly cracked a fissure.
The three of them fixed their eyes on it and realized that it was the one that belonged to Yin Xingge. Their expressions changed at once.
Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng looked at each other, both somewhat hesitant. According to the information they had gathered, Yin Xingge at most wanted to swallow the Dry Yang Crystal alone, so they only needed to passively benefit from it. What did he do down there?
"Senior Brother Yin has encountered something..."
Disciple of the Azure Clouds' voice trembled a little. Yin Xingge was the only one of the ten who was a mid-Foundation Establishment stage expert. If he encountered a danger that even he could not resolve, none of them would be able to escape!
Before the words were finished, there were suddenly three consecutive crisp sounds, and three more jade Buddhas shattered in response, sending out a plea for help.
So many people were in danger at the same time!
"Save them!"
Qin Sang gave a loud shout and stood up abruptly.
The Disciple of the Azure Clouds was flustered and hurriedly stood up, "Right! Save them, quickly save Senior Brother Yin..."
Mu Yifeng grabbed the Disciple of the Azure Clouds, "Friend Azure Clouds, stay here and activate the Star Disk without regard to the consequences. Do not be detected by the cloud beasts outside, or we will have no way out. Junior Brother Qin and I will go down to save them, but we cannot save Friend Yin first..."
The Disciple of the Azure Clouds was stunned, "What do you mean? Why don't you save Senior Brother Yin first? His strength..."
"Friend Yin did not tell Friend Azure Clouds the truth, right? It seems that Friend Azure Clouds does not know why Friend Yin came this time."
Divine consciousness collided, and the exchange of information was extremely fast. Mu Yifeng instantly informed the Disciple of the Azure Clouds of the ins and outs of the matter, causing the Disciple of the Azure Clouds to fall into a daze.
Qin Sang also quickly made a decision and said in a deep voice: "No matter what happened below, it must have been caused by Friend Yin. The most dangerous place is by Friend Yin's side. The others are too weak, and once they encounter a crisis, they will not be able to hold on for long. This Star Disk cloud tool is very special, similar to a forbidden tool. It is not that the stronger the manipulating ability, the greater the power it can exert. It also requires enough manpower. If the other six friends all die here, even if we save Friend Yin, with only the four of us activating the Star Disk, we will not be able to escape the detection of the cloud beasts and will inevitably be trapped here to death. Moreover, by gathering the strength of everyone, the possibility of saving Friend Yin will be even greater.

The exchange was surprisingly efficient despite the complexity. Qin Sang and Mu Yifeng persuaded Yun Qiong to spare no expense and activate the star disk completely, then split up to rescue the others from either side.
The priority was to save as many as possible and secure an escape route.
As for Yin Xingge, they'd let him fight for his own life for now.
He was strong enough to avoid such peril, and if he still lost his life here, he only had himself to blame.
Qin Sang had no idea what was happening below, and if it was too dangerous for even Yin Xingge to handle, he didn't dare go near.
Qin Sang pushed the Jade Talismans to their limits. The auras remaining on them could direct him, and he soon felt another cultivator ahead.
Everything seemed under control; he had just killed a cloud beast that had not fully transformed. He was surprised to see Qin Sang, "Senior Qin, what's going on..."
"A few fellow daoists have encountered danger. Fellow Daoist Wei, help support Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong and stabilize the star disk..."
Qin Sang hurriedly gave an order and sped off in other directions without looking back. The passages below formed a connected network.
Cultivator Wei was secretly alarmed. Qin Sang's sudden appearance and quick departure left him uneasy. However, he understood that he could only hold Qin Sang back. He quickly followed Qin Sang's instructions, put away his magic weapon and the dry sunstone, and returned to help Yun Qiong.
Qin Sang had two Jade Talismans. Another one had just shattered, which indicated that another cultivator was in danger, making him increasingly anxious. He could only hope they managed to hang on a little longer. Qin Sang realized that they were close together and were likely grouped up, which increased their survival odds.
Using the Jade Talismans, Qin Sang found his way without too many detours. He summoned Ebony ahead of time. Still feeling uneasy, he also concealed several items in his palm, such as talisman treasures and the Profound Yin Lightning.
When he approached a passage, Qin Sang came to an abrupt stop and looked ahead in surprise. The passage was filled with thick, black demonic energy spilling into the surrounding area.
The demonic energy not only blocked his vision but also his divine sense. Judging by the aura of the Jade Talismans, the other two were trapped.
