<h1>Chapter 2002  Pear</h1><p>The bronze drum flew steadily north, nearly reaching the edge of the sea area where the Extreme Sky Peak was located.  No islands were visible around them, and Mr. Hong showed no signs of stopping.</p><p>Continuing north, uninhabited islands appeared frequently.  Reaching a vast expanse of ocean, the bronze drum slowed abruptly. Mr. Hong tapped the drumhead with his toe.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>A soft drum sound echoed. The void trembled, rippling, and a blurry shadow appeared on the sea ahead, resembling a small island.</p><p>The shadow gradually sharpened, revealing an island previously hidden by a spirit array, now reappearing before everyone.</p><p>The island wasn't large, only ten or so li in diameter, without any buildings, yet it wasn't quite deserted.</p><p>The island was shaped like a saddle, with hillsides on either side covered in flowers.  They weren't rare varieties, but each was beautiful. Countless butterflies danced among the blossoms, a riot of color, a breathtaking scene.</p><p>In the heart of the flower sea, the saddle's center, lay a single patch of grass, soft as a carpet.  One couldn't help but imagine the pleasantness of lying there, basking in the sun.</p><p>The island was uninhabited. Qin Sang looked at Mr. Hong's back, wondering if he maintained this place.</p><p>The bronze drum landed on the shore. Qin Sang immediately inhaled the refreshing floral fragrance.</p><p>The butterflies here were unafraid of people; several, attracted by the drum's radiant glow, landed on them.</p><p>This reminded Qin Sang of the vibrant flower valley where he'd trapped the Sky-Eye Butterflies.  Unbeknownst to him, they'd followed him for over a thousand years.</p><p>"Everyone, please be careful not to step on the grass; someone might get upset," Mr. Hong chuckled.</p><p>Presumably, that was the attendant from Canjin City.  They would need their assistance later, so they couldn't afford to offend them.</p><p>Qin Sang stood at the edge of the grass. Huai Ting approached him, while only the person in the straw hat went to a rock by the shore, sitting cross-legged.</p><p>"I wonder what kind of person this attendant from Canjin City is.  Wouldn't they be a late-stage Transcendence expert?"</p><p>Huai Ting was full of anticipation.</p><p>"We should see them soon."</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the north of the island; the endless sea met the sky, with no sign of anyone.</p><p>Mr. Hong offered no explanation, entering the flower sea, transforming once more into a farmer.</p><p>From morning until noon, the sun blazed overhead.</p><p>A cloud drifted from somewhere, obscuring the intense sunlight and bringing a touch of coolness.</p><p>A cool breeze blew from the north, starting as a gentle zephyr, gradually strengthening. Waves crashed against the rocks, spraying white foam.</p><p>The sea's weather was unpredictable. The north suddenly turned dark and stormy, with distant thunder rumbling.</p><p>A storm was approaching!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang's expression shifted; he noticed Mr. Hong also rose from the flower sea, gazing north.</p><p>Suddenly, wind and clouds gathered, lightning flashed, thunder roared. Amidst the raging wind and waves, a boat appeared.</p><p>It was a small, covered boat, typically used on rivers, yet it was here at sea, and unmanned.</p><p>The covered boat drifted alone on the ocean, tossed about by the wind and rain, precariously balancing on the waves, ready to capsize at any moment, being pushed towards the island.</p><p>Qin Sang and Huai Ting stared intently at the boat, finally exchanging a glance, their expressions unusual.</p><p>As the boat neared the island, a silvery, bell-like laughter rang out.</p><p>"Wow! This is the flower island Sister Xing'er talked about! So many pretty flowers!"</p><p>A childishly innocent voice, full of delight, yet the boat remained empty; the sound seemed to emanate from the boat itself.</p><p>Then, a startling sight occurred.  The covered boat emitted cracking sounds, its hull abruptly disintegrating, yet not completely breaking apart. Instead, it shattered into pieces of varying sizes.</p><p>These fragments were irregularly shaped but neatly formed, clearly crafted by hand.</p><p>Then, these pieces, as if alive, began to align themselves, with a series of 'click-clack' sounds, interlocking mechanisms. After a dazzling transformation, the boat morphed into a white tiger.</p><p>It was indistinguishable from a real white tiger, with lifelike fur, paws, and muzzle.  There was no flaw, its eyes were lively and bright, lacking only the ferocity of a tiger, instead having a girl's gentle clumsiness.</p><p>Upon closer examination, Qin Sang discerned that no part of the tiger was true flesh and blood.</p><p>Its black and white stripes; the white fur was a type of spiritual metal called Swallow Marrow, the black fur was made of Sunset Gold, both drawn into thin strands to create the softest fur.</p><p>Its eyes were like two crystalline ghost pupils, naturally formed into the shape of eyeballs.</p><p>Its teeth were made of celestial snow silver.</p><p>The pads revealed on its four hooves weren't actual flesh and blood, but a kind of blood copper, which should have been as hard as steel, but somehow, after some unknown refinement, had become soft like flesh.</p><p>Its entire body was like this, with many materials that Qin Sang couldn't identify at a glance.</p><p>This wasn't a white tiger, it was clearly a steel behemoth!</p><p>A puppet?</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself. This steel behemoth was clearly different from his senior sister's puppetry, calling it a mechanical beast would be more appropriate.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang had seen some mechanical beasts, but they were mostly used as tools within the sect, lifeless things with significant limitations.</p><p>Each part of the white tiger was made of different materials, individually refined, then connected with intricate mechanisms. Although reinforced with符文禁制 (runic seals), the seals on each part were independent, purely mechanical.</p><p>Yet it possessed a soul. The girl's voice wasn't a disguise; she possessed human-like intelligence. Qin Sang sensed the presence of a primordial spirit, seemingly implanted into the steel behemoth using some method—a living mechanical beast.</p><p>Qin Sang could also craft puppets using spirit cores of妖兽 (demons beasts), but he didn't know how to fuse a primordial spirit with a purely mechanical creation, knowing there were mysteries he hadn't uncovered.</p><p>"How beautiful!"</p><p>The white tiger leaped into the air, landed on the island, and rolled around contentedly on the grass, letting out a satisfied sigh.</p><p>"What's your name? What about Xing'er?" Mr. Hong asked.</p><p>"Oh! You are Mr. Hong, aren't you? Li'er has met Mr. Hong!"</p><p>The white tiger sat up, politely bowed, then a human-like sadness appeared on its face. "Sister Xing'er failed to receive the Xuanhu's approval and her primordial spirit has depleted, and she has passed away."</p><p>Every move was perfectly natural, without flaw.</p><p>Mr. Hong sighed lightly, "I hope you, Li'er, will succeed. What kind of flowers do you like?"</p><p>"Li'er likes red flowers," Li'er's eyes were full of anticipation.</p><p>Sensing the girl's innocence, Mr. Hong couldn't help but say, "Qing'er, Cai'er, Xing'er... this old man has watched one girl after another wither and die. Your Canjin City's iron and gold mechanical beasts are wonderfully crafted, but they are too inhumane."</p><p>Li'er dared not criticize her own city, only listening silently with her head bowed, then she spat out a jade bracelet.</p><p>Mr. Hong took the bracelet, nodded, and gave Li'er a bracelet as well, pointing to Qin Sang and the others. "These three Daoists are our honored guests this time, and they are all going to Da Zhou."</p><p>"Li'er will certainly take good care of them."</p><p>Li'er nodded heavily, leaped forward, and landed before Qin Sang and the others, her large eyes rolling around.</p><p>Her gaze was like that of an innocent child, reflecting a pure and unblemished heart.</p><p>The white tiger spat out a jade slip, saying crisply, "Honored guests, my name is Li'er. I am the twenty-ninth executive of Canjin City's branch. You will enter my body; you can consider me a ship that will carry you across the ocean to Lan Tan Prefecture in Genzhou."</p><p>As she spoke, the white tiger's mechanisms clicked, its body growing taller and longer, transforming into a giant tiger. A door appeared in its abdomen, separating the interior into three chambers.</p><p>At this point, it was no longer a normal creature.</p><p>"Oops, I forgot!"</p><p>Li'er stuck out her tongue, showing a shy expression, then spat out another jade slip. "This lists the fare.  Guests can pay with any of the items listed, or something of equivalent value."</p><p>The three took turns examining it, seeing various spirit objects listed, in varying quantities but of roughly equal value.</p><p>"Can't we use spirit stones?" Huai Ting hesitated and asked.</p><p>Li'er tilted her large head. "Within Genzhou, spirit stones can be used for short distances, but Li'er doesn't accept them."</p><p>Qin Sang, having been warned by Master Yue, was prepared. He took out three snake-skin spirit fruits, the size of eggs.</p><p>"Three Ma Dan fruits. May I ask your Daoist names?" Li'er beamed.</p><p>"I am Qingfeng," Qin Sang withdrew his hand, the fruits floating into Li'er's mouth and being swallowed.</p><p>Seeing this, Huai Ting and the person in the straw hat also produced their payment.</p><p>"When will we depart?"</p><p>The person in the straw hat, identifying himself as Wen Sheng, asked an additional question when paying.</p><p>"Li'er will remain here for ten days. During that time, other Daoists will arrive from elsewhere," Mr. Hong, tending to his flowers, answered for Li'er.</p><p>"How long until we reach Genzhou?" Huai Ting pressed further.</p><p>Li'er explained, "Elder told me this place isn't really remote.  It's just that human forces are weak in the South Sea, and my speed limits us. For safety, we need to take detours, which adds to the journey. It'll take about ten years."</p><p>"Safety? Can you protect us along the way?" Huaiting's eyes were scrutinizing.</p><p>Like Qin Sang, he had never seen such a mechanical beast before and couldn't judge Li'er's abilities from its appearance.  </p><p>Canjin City trusted Li'er enough not to send a Transcendent cultivator along.  However, Li'er's soul felt like a naive fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl, which was hard to trust.</p><p>Li'er said seriously, "I will do my best to protect you. If we encounter danger, I will share life and death with you. But if your enemies come looking for revenge, I won't interfere."</p><p>Mr. Hong added, "Li'er represents Canjin City.  Canjin City's name carries weight on this route."</p><p>Hearing this, Huaiting said nothing more.</p><p>Qin Sang had been listening quietly and then asked, "Where is Lantan Prefecture located in Genzhou? Can you give us a map of Genzhou?"</p><p>"Lantan Prefecture is in southwest Genzhou, bordering the South Sea. I will take you to the prefecture's capital city, but you can also disembark along the way.  I have a map, but it's a very simplified one. If you want a more detailed one, you can buy it from various trading companies in Lantan Prefecture."</p><p>As Li'er spoke, she produced a scroll.</p><p>Huaiting leaned in to look.  The markings were indeed simple, only outlining the locations of the different prefectures in Genzhou with lines.  Lantan Prefecture was at the far corner of Genzhou, far from the capital.</p><p>"Daoist, where are you heading? If you don't have a destination, perhaps we could travel together after reaching Lantan Prefecture for mutual support? I don't have a specific plan either; I intend to travel around," Huaiting invited.</p><p>Qin Sang shook her head slightly.  "I'll decide my destination once I arrive in Genzhou, but it's unlikely our paths will coincide."</p><p>"In that case, perhaps we'll meet again someday," Huaiting said, sensing Qin Sang's coolness, he bowed and boarded the beast first.</p><p>Qin Sang entered Li'er's interior and chose a quiet room. The room was small.  She wouldn't mind; she expected to spend the ten years in cultivation.  </p><p>A thoughtfully placed small window, made of a special spirit metal, allowed her to see outside. There were no restrictions between the rooms.</p><p>Qin Sang took out several small flags and placed them around the room, completely sealing it off, preventing Li'er from observing inside.  Opening a small gap in the spirit array, Qin Sang called out, "Li'er."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>Li'er's voice was always crisp, lively, and full of energy.</p><p>"When we reach Lantan Prefecture and need to travel to another prefecture, do we need to hire you again?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>"Other stewards will take care of you then. Besides Canjin City, other forces offer such services.  Of course, where there are small teleportation arrays, those are the fastest."</p><p>"Are there many places that small teleportation arrays can't reach?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.  The Great Zhou Dynasty claimed to be a unified nation, and the teleportation arrays connecting all corners were undoubtedly the most efficient means of travel.</p><p>"Elder told me that the world is unpredictable, full of hidden dangers.  Sometimes changes in spiritual energy, battles between powerful cultivators, or even unintentional leakage of energy from powerful cultivators can disrupt space.  If a teleportation array isn't stable enough and is affected, you might be sent to another place in the vast world and might even survive. But being flung into spatial turbulence is extremely dangerous," Li'er's voice revealed fear.  After a pause, she continued, "So, even if someone sets up a teleportation array, without the backing of a major power, no one dares to use it. And teleportation arrays aren't easy to set up; the cost is too high.  Short distances are pointless, hence the business of Canjin City.  I heard that the large teleportation array connecting Genzhou to Baiyu City is the only one ever built; no one can build a second one…"</p><p>Li'er was quite talkative, readily answering questions as long as they didn't involve Canjin City secrets.</p><p>After their conversation, Qin Sang had a general idea, but she needed to see things for herself to truly understand the cultivation world of Great Zhou.</p><p>On the third day, a streak of light arrived from afar.  It seemed to know Mr. Hong; they talked for a while before boarding. Li'er created another room.</p><p>Over the next ten days, more people arrived, eventually totaling over ten, causing Li'er's body to stretch several times longer.</p><p>Qin Sang only observed through the window and didn't socialize.  These people also went into their own rooms without seeking companionship. They were merely fellow travelers, not interfering with each other.</p><p>On the tenth evening, Li'er leaped forward, heading towards the sea.</p>
