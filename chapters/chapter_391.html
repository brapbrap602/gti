<h1>Chapter 384: Yaksha</h1><p>Chapter 384: Yaksha</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi held their breath, waiting in place for a moment.  Once certain that the group of flying fish-dragons hadn't detected them, they proceeded to delve deeper into the icy cavern.</p><p>Having heard Yun Youzi's account of the strange being ahead, Qin Sang felt a mixture of tension and anticipation.  His primary purpose in accompanying Yun Youzi was to fulfill his promise and help him obtain the spiritual herb.  Secondly, if the strange being was truly a self-acting animated corpse, its creator wouldn't leave such a powerful creature unattended unless something unforeseen occurred.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that the creator might have perished here, allowing the animated corpse to roam freely.  In such a cold, remote location, rarely visited by anyone, with an animated corpse as guardian, the creator's remains might still be here!</p><p>As he walked, Qin Sang pondered how to find the person's body and retrieve their belongings without being detected by the animated corpse.  The treasures within were secondary; Qin Sang was most eager to obtain the second half of the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual," especially the secret techniques for elevating a living corpse to a flying Yaksha.</p><p>The ice cavern had many branching paths.  Yun Youzi, having been there before, knew the way.  After a dizzying journey through the passages, Yun Youzi whispered, "Brother Qin, it's just ahead..."</p><p>At the end of the straight passage was a massive ice hall.</p><p>Faint blue light illuminated the hall, barely allowing them to discern its features.  The hall wasn't square or rectangular, unlike anything man-made. It was empty except for several doors on either side, leading to other chambers.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the ice hall; nothing seemed amiss from a distance. It was eerily quiet, and the strange being was nowhere to be seen.  The bluish light emanated from the ice itself.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang's gaze shifted to a chamber on the right side of the hall. He asked, "Is the strange being in that chamber?"</p><p>"Correct!"</p><p>Yun Youzi nodded, pointing to another chamber on the opposite side. "I'm going to that chamber.  Any movement on my part will surely alert the creature. This person's escape technique is superb, unpredictable, and incredibly powerful.  Brother Qin, you must buy me at least fifteen breaths' time."</p><p>Fifteen breaths.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent for a moment, then said gravely, "We'll find out by trying."</p><p>Fifteen breaths, for cultivators, could mean life or death. However, he was prepared. If it was truly an animated corpse, he might stand a chance.  But without seeing the strange being's true form, Qin Sang couldn't be certain.</p><p>Yun Youzi summoned his spiritual bamboo boat. "I've tested it before, for some reason, that strange being won't stray far from the hall. After chasing it a short distance, it will return on its own. However, given its uncanny escape technique, that distance is like a chasm.  Those who entered the hall with me before all perished at its hands. Once inside, Brother Qin, test the waters, then immediately board the boat once the being appears..."</p><p>Yun Youzi's detailed instructions and cautious demeanor were evident. Qin Sang listened carefully, taking no chances. He immediately summoned his ebony sword and prepared to activate the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman. If things went south, exposing the talisman was a small price to pay for escape.</p><p>Both were ready.  After exchanging a glance, they no longer concealed their presence, flying on their swords straight into the ice hall.  In an instant, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi stood in the center.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly scanned the hall, memorizing his surroundings, pushing his spiritual awareness to its limits, his senses sweeping every corner.  He was extremely tense.</p><p>However, nothing changed after they entered.  There was nothing unusual.</p><p>Suddenly, Yun Youzi's face changed. He roared,</p><p>"Behind!"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened. Without turning, he unleashed a burst of energy from his ebony sword, thrusting it backward.</p><p>Simultaneously, Yun Youzi twisted his upper body into a grotesque posture, his hands gripping his blue light sword, unleashing a several-zhang-long sword energy, cleaving downwards!</p><p>Two sword energies erupted simultaneously, the light reflecting off the ice, dazzling the eyes.</p><p>Because they were prepared, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi were not flustered. Everything went according to plan.</p><p>The two swords intertwined in mid-air, striking a point in the void.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>A deafening roar.</p><p>The sword energies shattered.</p><p>The swords flew back!</p><p>A figure materialized in mid-air.</p><p>The man clenched his fists, his stance like thunder, meeting two sword energies with unmatched force.  Facing the combined attack, he remained unmoved, shattering the sword energy with a single punch.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi, on the other hand, were violently shaken, feeling a terrifying impact.  They groaned, falling back in disarray.</p><p>*Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang and Yun Youzi crashed into the ice palace walls. Their combined efforts couldn't withstand the stranger's single blow.</p><p>Qin Sang, his blood churning, ignored the pain, barely stabilizing himself.  He glanced at the stranger's appearance.  The man was thin, looking like a middle-aged scholar. His clothes were ragged, revealing skin of a strange bluish-black hue, even on his face. His expressionless face and dark eyes held a disturbing quality, making Qin Sang uneasy.</p><p>Suddenly, the stranger vanished.  Yun Youzi's warning proved true; after the disappearance, Qin Sang felt nothing.</p><p>"Qin!"</p><p>Yun Youzi, having summoned his spirit bamboo airship, called out urgently.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sudden warning, and quickly boarded the airship.  Yun Youzi shouted, and the airship, glowing brightly, shot forward.</p><p>However, as the airship neared the exit, a bluish-black hand eerily emerged from thin air.  Sharp, black fingernails, carrying a nauseating corpse-like aura, darted towards them.</p><p>Just as the ghostly hand was about to pierce the airship's barrier, gutting the two men, Qin Sang, instead of dodging, stared intently at the hand, his eyes flashing strangely.</p><p>What followed surprised them. The hand inexplicably paused.  Seizing this brief moment, the spirit bamboo airship darted out of the hall, escaping.</p><p>On the airship, Yun Youzi looked at Qin Sang with relief.  Qin Sang let out a breath and nodded.</p><p>The exchange had lasted less than a second, yet they had faced mortal danger. Despite the brevity, Qin Sang had sensed the stranger's unique aura.  Yun Youzi was right; the stranger was indeed a living corpse created using the Heavenly Corpse Talisman!</p><p>And not just any corpse, but a Flying Night Rakshasa!</p>
