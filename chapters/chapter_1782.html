<h1>Chapter 1773: Hu Zhong City</h1><p>After learning about the proposal from Tao Hengshan, Qin Sang didn't immediately respond, saying he needed time to consider.</p><p>Tao Zhenren expressed understanding, stating that choosing a cultivation path is the most serious matter in a cultivator's life, and caution is never excessive.</p><p>Leaving the academy, the two returned to the main hall, where Tao Zhenren offered further incentives, increasing the stakes.</p><p>After staying in the mountains for several days, Qin Sang decided to leave.  Tao Zhenren, unable to persuade him to stay, personally escorted Qin Sang out of the mountains.</p><p>Watching Qin Sang's departing back, Tao Zhenren knew his chances of recruiting him were slim, and he sighed, shaking his head.</p><p>Leaving Tao Hengshan, Qin Sang returned directly to Yunfeng City without stopping, then took a teleportation array north.</p><p>After several transfers, he finally arrived at a celestial city built on water, called Youdai Pass.</p><p>Stone pillars, hundreds of meters high, were sunk into the lakebed, with streets and houses built between them, forming the city.</p><p>Each pillar was engraved with runes, protecting it from erosion.  In case of an enemy invasion, the pillars would instantly transform into the foundation of a protective formation—an ingenious design.</p><p>Walking along the streets, Qin Sang looked down at the river, paying close attention to the pillars.</p><p>After a while, he looked up.</p><p>The city had no walls.  Standing at the edge, Qin Sang could see beyond the city limits.</p><p>In the distance, he saw a great river, like a jade belt, its wide surface shimmering with ripples. The vast river flowed from the southwest, passing under the city.</p><p>This was the Sanyuan River, the same one that flowed past the mountains of Xuanji Gate.</p><p>The river flowed through Baishi Prefecture, absorbing countless tributaries, eventually merging into Xingdao Lake from the west. The confluence was only ten miles or so from the city.</p><p>It was said that another river, comparable to the Sanyuan River, flowed into Xingdao Lake from the east.</p><p>Xingdao Lake was immense, with countless rivers flowing into it.  These two rivers were the largest, resembling two ribbons flowing into the lake.</p><p>This city was located precisely at the confluence, hence the name Youdai Pass.  There was a corresponding city to the east, Zuodai Pass.</p><p>Because of their location, these two passes were only second in fame to Hu Zhong City.</p><p>Hu Zhong City, located in the center of Xingdao Lake, was the second most important celestial city in Jushan Prefecture, after Heming Mountain, and considered the most important by the cultivators of Jushan Prefecture.</p><p>This city was also one of Qin Sang's destinations.</p><p>Upon arriving at Youdai Pass, there were no further teleportation arrays. Qin Sang had to fly into Xingdao Lake.</p><p>He understood that it would take about ten days of flight to reach a teleportation array that could transport him to the heart of Xingdao Lake. Even then, he would still have to fly a distance to reach Hu Zhong City.</p><p>The layout of Xingdao Lake seemed to be artificially divided into layers, a measure likely taken for defense. In case of an emergency, this would allow for the immediate cutting off of external access and the implementation of layered defenses.</p><p>After leaving the city, Qin Sang followed the Sanyuan River to its mouth, enjoying the beautiful scenery of the confluence before taking flight into the lake.</p><p>Xingdao Lake was vast, like an ocean to ordinary people.</p><p>After flying for a while, Qin Sang exclaimed, "The name Xingdao truly lives up to its meaning."</p><p>It was his first time seeing such a densely packed archipelago.  Islands of all sizes were scattered throughout the lake, and many showed signs of cultivator activity.</p><p>Xingdao Lake and Heming Mountain, north and south respectively, had completely different atmospheres.  People here had relaxed smiles, a rare sight in the tense and lethal atmosphere of Heming Mountain.</p><p>In Jushan Prefecture, such peace and tranquility were hard to find.</p><p>A gentle breeze blew.</p><p>Sails dotted the lake like flags. Qin Sang noticed treasure ships passing by.</p><p>After considering, Qin Sang descended, landing on the deck of a ship, and after negotiations with the crew, entered the cabin.</p><p>More than a month passed.</p><p>The ship shuddered.</p><p>"Reporting to the Immortal, we have arrived at Du Family Island,"</p><p>a respectful voice called from outside the cabin.</p><p>Qin Sang disembarked and stepped onto the island.  Its size and function were similar to a celestial city; it housed a teleportation array. Cultivators in the area wishing to travel to the heart of Xingdao Lake had to pass through Du Family Island.</p><p>…</p><p>"I'm almost there…"</p><p>In the heart of Xingdao Lake, Qin Sang flew slowly at a hundred meters above the water's surface.</p><p>Looking ahead, Qin Sang's mind flashed with the map of Xingdao Lake. Hu Zhong City was just ahead.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang glanced north.</p><p>The dojo of the Sword Heart Immortal was called Sword Heart Island, located north of Hu Zhong City. Qin Sang decided to explore Hu Zhong City first before visiting the Sword Heart Immortal.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the water. Hu Zhong City was right in front of him.</p><p>Some called Hu Zhong City Hu Zhong Island, because the city was an island in itself.</p><p>Wooden walkways extended from the shore, serving as docks and access points to the city.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the celestial city. The island’s terrain was uneven, with rolling hills and vast forests, yet pavilions and towers dotted the mountains and woods, some clustered, others scattered.</p><p>This Hub City is probably larger than Crane Song Mountain, Qin Sang mused, stepping onto the wooden path.  He paid the entrance fee to the guards and entered the city.</p><p>His first goal was the city’s auction house or trading hall.</p><p>Qin Sang easily learned that the city’s largest auction house was owned by the Ju Shan Guild, a peculiar organization named after the mountain itself.</p><p>The Ju Shan Guild situated its auction house atop Hub City’s highest peak, the city’s most bustling area.  A massive nine-story wooden building stood prominently there.</p><p>Qin Sang approached the building, glanced upward, entered, and released a wisp of his aura.</p><p>“Greetings, honored immortal…”</p><p>A young man greeted him with a bright smile.</p><p>Qin Sang asked directly, “When does the auction begin?”</p><p>The young man hesitated, his smile unwavering.  “Your timing is excellent, sir; an auction is about to commence, although…”</p><p>Before the young man could finish, Qin Sang said, “Lead the way.”</p><p>The young man, knowing some cultivators had eccentric personalities, dared not be negligent. He bowed and led the way, quickly explaining the auction rules.  He secretly worried; the aura the other man had displayed suggested a Sheng Xuan True Person. This auction was for Cave God-level items, likely beneath the True Person’s notice.</p><p>Qin Sang, however, remained unmoved, following the young man to a hall on the third floor and finding a seat in the back.</p><p>Soon, the hall was filled with cultivators. Qin Sang glanced around, noticing a majority were Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Shortly, a middle-aged man took the stage.</p><p>The proceedings were similar to other auctions he’d attended, yet Qin Sang remained interested, watching unfamiliar treasures being sold.</p><p>“Yu Liu Jin, a fabric of unique properties, usable in forging various high-grade talismans. Its fame precedes it, and many of you will have heard of it.  Cultivators whose talismans are compatible, don’t miss it! The starting bid is 500,000 low-grade spirit stones…”</p><p>The middle-aged man spoke with fervor, dramatically unveiling a goose-yellow, silk-like object from under a red cloth, its texture like flowing water.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned forward slightly, examining the Yu Liu Jin carefully.</p><p>This world’s cultivators also used spirit stones for transactions.</p><p>The Yu Liu Jin had the highest starting price yet, and Qin Sang understood why. In this realm, materials that could be used to create stable and powerful talismans were highly sought after.</p><p>As expected, many cultivators’ eyes lit up.</p><p>“550,000!”</p><p>“600,000!”</p><p>…</p><p>The price quickly reached an astonishing level. The buyer beamed, though clearly feeling the pinch.</p><p>After observing for a while, Qin Sang got up to leave.</p><p>The young man was waiting outside, quickly approaching and smiling obsequiously. “Were these treasures not to your liking, sir? I apologize for my poor judgment.  In six months, there will be an auction for True Persons; might you be interested?”</p><p>He offered Qin Sang an invitation.</p><p>Qin Sang opened it to find it listed some items with brief descriptions.</p><p>The young man promptly added, “This auction mainly uses bartering or Dao Court merit for transactions. If you attend, please prepare accordingly.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Like in the Storm World, transactions above Yuan Ying level rarely involved spirit stones.  This world, however, had a substitute.</p><p>The items listed were merely decent in the eyes of a Nascent Soul cultivator, but Qin Sang decided to accept the invitation to broaden his horizons.</p><p>After further inquiry, he was somewhat disappointed.</p><p>This was already the Ju Shan Guild's top auction; the next level was a massive auction held only once every few decades, still over a decade away.</p><p>The so-called “True Person level” referred to Sheng Xuan True Persons, and Qin Sang aspired to participate in transactions among Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>“There can’t be many Nascent Soul cultivators outside the Daoist sect…”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  The Daoist sect controlled high-level talismans and wouldn't allow too many strong cultivators to emerge outside its ranks.  These Nascent Soul cultivators rarely made public appearances, conducting transactions only among themselves. He was still an outsider and needed a referral.</p><p>His desire to attend such an auction stemmed from his current limitations. He wanted to acquire defensive treasures, ideally a pseudo-spiritual or spiritual treasure suitable for a strength-based cultivator.</p><p>If possible, he would trade his Four-fold Serpent Seal.</p><p>Since obtaining this spiritual treasure, his avatar had mainly used it. Although Qin Sang’s main body mastered the Tongbao Technique, he couldn’t unleash its full potential. With his avatar lost, it was better to exchange it for a more suitable treasure.</p><p>However, finding a suitable trade wasn't easy.</p><p>Qin Sang considered his own situation. He possessed several items of uncertain origin, such as three damaged treasures he obtained from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>The Chengying Sword, a broken drum, and a scroll!</p><p>The Wuxiang Immortal Sect didn't understand the nature of these three treasures and stored them in their treasury.</p><p>Qin Sang, despite years of studying the art of refining, was unable to do anything with them.</p><p>However, the cultivators in this realm possessed far greater skill and knowledge than those in the Storm World. Perhaps a master refiner could uncover their secrets and restore them.</p><p>Mulling these matters over, Qin Sang left the Jushan Meeting. He rented a secluded cave on the island and began gathering information on the sects of the Xingdao Immortal Lake, particularly those that offered instruction to outsiders.</p><p>He had already collected some information at Heming Mountain, but he expected a more complete collection here, allowing for cross-referencing.</p><p>Several months later.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in his cave, several jade slips arranged on the ground, with another one in his hand.</p><p>The jade slip in his hand contained information he had meticulously selected and verified from a large amount of data, ensuring its accuracy.</p><p>The jade slip listed several sects he deemed suitable and likely to offer instruction.</p><p>The first sect was the Zhuyan Palace.</p><p>Zhuyan Palace was a sect within Xingdao Immortal Lake, offering the Seven-Star Zhuyan Art, a fire-attribute technique Qin Sang sought.</p><p>Zhuyan Palace offered external instruction, and Qin Sang had already investigated the admission requirements, which he had listed.</p><p>One condition was particularly difficult: only subordinate sects of Zhuyan Palace were eligible for instruction, unless one was a descendant of someone who had rendered great service to the Zhuyan Palace.</p><p>To obtain the Seven-Star Zhuyan Art, he might have to infiltrate a subordinate sect.</p><p>This wasn't Qin Sang's first time doing something like this, so it didn't faze him. However, it meant a potentially lengthy stay at Zhuyan Palace.</p><p>After a moment's thought, he turned to the second sect he had chosen – the Thunder Left Manor.</p><p>And the third sect – the Thunder Right Manor.</p><p>Qin Sang was initially surprised to learn of these two sects.</p><p>Not only were their names similar, but they were both located in Xingdao Immortal Lake.</p><p>Although Qin Sang lacked definitive proof, various signs suggested that these two sects were once part of a single sect, splitting into Left and Right Manors for unknown reasons.</p><p>Now, the Thunder Left and Right Manors were situated in the east and west of Xingdao Immortal Lake respectively, with little harmony between them; their disciples frequently clashed.</p><p>Both the Thunder Left and Right Manors possessed their own altars and taught a technique with the same name – the High Supreme Divine Thunder Art.</p><p>Qin Sang was unsure if there were any differences between the two Manors’ techniques.</p><p>The High Supreme Divine Thunder Art was a thunder-attribute technique, one of the reasons Qin Sang had chosen them.</p><p>Both Manors offered external instruction, unlike Zhuyan Palace's restriction to subordinate sects, but the requirements were said to be extremely stringent and difficult to meet.</p><p>All three sects were top-tier forces in Xingdao Immortal Lake. While the strength of a technique couldn't be simply measured by power, this was nonetheless significant.</p><p>Several other sects were on his reserve list, but if possible, Qin Sang preferred to learn from these three.</p><p>The choice between the three sects required careful consideration.</p><p>Choosing the Thunder Left or Right Manor would eliminate the need for disguise, potentially making things easier.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't sure when he could control the Azure Bird Primordial Thunder Power. If he couldn't control it even at the late Nascent Soul stage, it would be problematic.</p><p>Using the Thunder Turtle妖丹 to forge an altar would likely only support his cultivation to the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Zhuyan Palace had the advantage of offering a fire-attribute technique; Qin Sang possessed various spirit flames, and the awakened Suzaku Youngling could also help him.</p><p>Regardless of his choice, Qin Sang had to consider one more factor: these three top-tier sects in Xingdao Immortal Lake likely had Nascent Soul-level experts.</p><p>Instruction was conducted at the sect's altar. If he were to attend with suppressed cultivation, he risked exposure.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered, the restriction outside his cave was suddenly triggered.</p><p>A servant girl's voice came from outside, "Reporting to the immortal, Master Qi's disciple has opened the cave's restriction. It seems Master Qi has finished refining and just emerged from seclusion."</p><p>"Understood," Qin Sang replied gravely, putting away the jade slips, and walked out, deciding to visit this Master Qi first.</p><p>Master Qi was a renowned refiner in Huchong City who had been in seclusion for a long time.</p><p></p>
