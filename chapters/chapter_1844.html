<h1>Chapter 1835: Unexpected Encounter</h1><p>The thunderclouds dissipated, the person was gone.</p><p>The tribulation left behind only ruins.</p><p>Qi Daoshi's disciples flew to the site of the tribulation, kneeling and weeping. Qin Sang also sighed deeply.</p><p>After the memorial service, Qin Sang took out a token and gave it to Qi Daoshi's eldest disciple, "If you encounter difficulties in the future, use this token to seek help from Jianxin Island. If your opponent is too powerful, remember to endure temporarily, I will see to it for you all."</p><p>Before the tribulation, Qi Daoshi asked Qin Sang to look after his descendants. Qin Sang agreed.</p><p>For ordinary disputes, the Sword Servant is sufficient.</p><p>If Qi Daoshi's successor incurs a great karmic debt, the  Zhijue Zhenren cannot be involved.  Qin Sang will personally handle it upon his return.</p><p>"Thank you, senior, for your care."</p><p>The disciples knelt down and expressed their gratitude.</p><p>"Qi Daoshi was renowned, and you, inheriting his mantle, must be diligent and self-disciplined."</p><p>Qin Sang left gracefully, his voice faint.</p><p>Returning to Jianxin Island, Qin Sang entrusted the matter to the Sword Servant, entered his cave, and summoned the Mingshan Armor to examine it carefully.</p><p>This armor embodies Qi Daoshi's life's work.</p><p>It doesn't possess extraordinary power; its focus is on ultimate defense.  Its strength lies in the integration of fragments of true treasures into its body.</p><p>The armor is perfectly integrated, and every part benefits from the true treasure fragments, merging their power. While it cannot compare to the true treasure fragments themselves, it is exceptionally strong.</p><p>Most importantly, Qin Sang can, at will, re-form a true treasure fragment at any point on the armor to protect a vital area.</p><p>The armor's name is no exaggeration!</p><p>…</p><p>Niel Yuan.</p><p>Two figures, one tall and one short, were flying through the mountains.</p><p>The taller one wore purple armor, matching his purple hair and eyes, which emitted an eerie purple glow.</p><p>The shorter one was only up to the purple-armored person's waist, his back hunched, appearing weak, with a scorpion-like tail trailing behind him, its hook gleaming coldly.</p><p>In appearance, this person seemed more like the purple-armored person's subordinate. However, the purple-armored person consistently lagged half a step behind him.</p><p>As they flew, the shorter person looked around, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>The purple-armored person, however, kept his gaze fixed ahead, his purple eyes exceptionally bright, the purple light growing stronger.</p><p>Through the purple light, one could faintly see the purple-armored person's pupils, seemingly containing a world.</p><p>Within, shadows of mountains and trees appeared as real.</p><p>A closer look revealed that the mountain in the center of the pupil was the mountain range beneath them—the world in the purple eye was a reflection of the real world.</p><p>Clearly, the purple-armored person was using some kind of divine ability, encompassing the surrounding world within his pupils, with every plant and tree clearly visible.</p><p>Using this unusual technique, nothing escaped the purple-armored person's eyes, not even the slightest change in energy.</p><p>The shorter person occasionally used his own detection abilities, but his role was more focused on vigilance, constantly guarding against hidden dangers.</p><p>"Friend, you've used the Purple Heaven Eye to search for so long without any response. It seems it's not in this direction. This great accomplishment is not meant for us…"</p><p>The shorter person's expression relaxed, he smacked his lips, his tone somewhat listless.</p><p>The purple-armored person remained silent and unmoved by the shorter person's words, continuing his diligent search.</p><p>The shorter person, well aware of the purple-armored person's nature, didn't take offense and continued his rambling.</p><p>As he was speaking, the purple-armored person suddenly stopped, a dark gleam flashed in his eyes as he fixed his gaze on the northern mountains.</p><p>Seeing his action, the shorter person immediately understood, his face darkening as he shouted, "Who's there! Show yourself!"</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>To the north of the two demons, in a mountain cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his brow furrowed.</p><p>After settling Qi Daoshi's affairs, Qin Sang returned from Jushan Zhi, choosing a route closer to the Daoist Court for safety.</p><p>While in Jushan Zhi, he had roughly inquired about the situation and learned that the Daoist Court and Gui Fang Kingdom had been experiencing constant friction, but only minor skirmishes.</p><p>For instance, a few years ago, the Daoist Court launched a swift attack, eliminating demon temples around Zhongmao Zhi and Baishi Zhi.  The demon gods in the northern part of Jushan Zhi were terrified, abandoning their followers and temples, and fleeing back to Gui Fang Kingdom.</p><p>However, the Daoist Court did not pursue the victory, it seemed like a warning, quickly withdrawing its forces and not stationing troops.</p><p>However, after this lesson, a clear boundary evolved in Niel Yuan, where demon gods were once dominant. Even if some demon gods infiltrated, they didn't dare to be as blatant as before.</p><p>The route Qin Sang chose was on the western side of the border. He encountered no danger until he neared the Jushan Zhi altar, when he sensed something was wrong.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly spotted two powerful demonic auras approaching.  Qin Sang, unsure of their intentions, remained hidden.</p><p>After a shout.</p><p>The two demonic auras rapidly closed in.  Qin Sang's hopes vanished—his presence was discovered!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened.  How his presence was revealed was irrelevant; demonic cultivators often possessed uncanny abilities.  His concern was the upheaval at the Evil Source and why two Demon Lords dared to blatantly cross borders with such impunity.</p><p>The snake demon and the wolf demon had sent no warning.  Qin Sang hadn't noticed anything unusual on the way, suggesting a sudden event.</p><p>The others drew closer.  Qin Sang thought quickly, decisively summoning his Phoenix Wings, a flash of lightning illuminating his back.  The wings unfolded, their green light bathing the chamber.</p><p>Qin Sang opened the stone door and stepped out, looking up at the two streaks of light hurtling towards him.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>A surprised sound came from the streaks of light.  The two demons landed on the mountain peaks to his left and right, surrounding him. One was a mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, the other a purple-armored early-stage Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Concealing the icy glint in his eyes, Qin Sang feigned confusion, bowing slightly. "Were you two calling for me?"</p><p>The demons sized him up, their gazes lingering on his Phoenix Wings before exchanging a look.  His demonic aura was pure, the wings genuine, proving his demonic lineage. However, many demons served the Celestial Court, fighting against Guifang.</p><p>The shorter demon demanded gruffly, "Who are you? What are you doing here?"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, brushing his sleeve aside.  "You forced me from my dwelling without cause. Shouldn't you introduce yourselves first?"</p><p>The shorter demon's eyes flashed.  Qin Sang met his gaze without flinching.</p><p>After a moment, the shorter demon produced an object.  "We serve the Lingyue King. We have urgent business and need answers. If there's nothing amiss, we won't trouble you."</p><p>Qin Sang immediately adopted a subservient expression.  "My apologies, esteemed envoys. I am Qin Sang, Grand Tutor of Qingyuan, and was clearly mistaken. Please forgive my oversight."  He produced a large seal, flashing it before them.</p><p>The Grand Tutor seal and identity were, of course, fabricated. Qin Sang had traveled frequently between the capital and Jushan, knowing that one is bound to encounter trouble, so he’d used the snake demon to bribe his way through, gathering intelligence on the various Demon Kings' power and rivalries, preparing various strategies.</p><p>The Lingyue King’s territory lay in the far north of the Ganshangu region, on the northern border of Guifang. He was known for his low profile, and his Demon Lords were mostly unknown for their avoidance of worldly affairs.</p><p>This identity was perfect for this situation.</p><p>The disguise wouldn't fool everyone, but reducing their hostility increased his chances of escape.</p><p>The shorter demon studied Qin Sang, surprised by his strength and apparent willingness to languish in the demon realm.  Such things weren't unheard of; some powerful figures chose to avoid conflict and live quietly within demonic territories.</p><p>"What are you doing here?"  The shorter demon's eyes were sharp.</p><p>"I often hunt beasts in the Evil Source. I was chasing a particularly ferocious one and lost track of it. I was returning to the capital when I encountered you. My apologies," Qin Sang improvised.</p><p>The demons relaxed slightly, but remained wary.  The shorter demon glanced at the purple-armored one, who shook his head after a moment of scrutiny.</p><p>After a pause, the shorter demon said, "Then this doesn't concern you. However, we must report this. Come with us. You'll meet Lord Fu, verify your identity, and then be released."</p><p>"And who is this Lord Fu?" Qin Sang asked, his brow furrowed with feigned apprehension.</p><p>"Don't you know the Lingyue King's top expert? Lord Fu acts on the King's orders and wouldn't kill an innocent. Relax," the shorter demon scoffed at Qin Sang's apparent fear.</p><p>"Of course, the renowned Lord Fu. I trust him completely."</p><p>Qin Sang visibly relaxed, joining them in the air.  The demons led the way, the tension dissipating.</p><p>After flying for some time, Qin Sang noticed they were seemingly searching for something, not heading anywhere in particular.  "How much further to Lord Fu's?" he asked.</p><p>A short figure didn't look back.  "Don't worry, Daoist Fu is to the south. We'll take you there after searching this area."</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  Throughout their journey, he subtly tried to extract information, but the two demons were tight-lipped, revealing nothing about the unfolding events.</p><p>However, after several inquiries, he gleaned some details.  For instance, there were more than three demon lords nearby;  the elite forces under the Lingyue King had almost completely deployed, fanning out to search for something.</p><p>If all the demon lords were here, where was the Lingyue King himself?</p><p>This thought sent a chill down Qin Sang's spine. He had to escape quickly; he absolutely couldn't be taken to meet Lord Fu!</p><p>His disguise could only fool them temporarily; it wouldn't withstand scrutiny. If taken before the demon king, he would be exposed.</p><p>But the two demons were relentless; getting rid of them wouldn't be easy.</p><p>Murderous intent flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. He made his calculations, his tone remaining calm. "I wonder what the two Daoists are searching for. I'm not boasting, but I possess some abilities that might be of assistance."</p><p>This statement intrigued the armored figure. It was constantly using its Purple Heaven Eye, a highly draining technique. Having someone share the burden, taking turns searching, would be much easier.  Unfortunately, although the stranger's aura was completely different from their target, his identity remained unknown, making him untrustworthy.</p><p>The armored figure opened its mouth to speak, but its expression suddenly changed.</p><p>Without warning, an extremely terrifying aura erupted from behind them. This aura contained an overwhelming celestial pressure, even more fearsome than the one they felt when facing Lord Fu!</p><p>The celestial pressure descended, sending a shock through the two demons.</p><p>They hadn't entirely trusted Qin Sang, remaining wary, but they never imagined he possessed such a terrifying aura.</p><p>Qin Sang had already merged with his Dharma form; now, it exploded outwards. Even a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator like Xia Hou would be stunned, let alone these two demons.</p><p>As the celestial pressure enveloped the two demons, a gust of icy wind surged from Qin Sang's sleeve. Then, his body, almost one with the wind, shot forward.</p><p>The icy wind headed straight for the armored figure.</p><p>Despite the distance between Qin Sang and the demons, it was negligible.</p><p>Four venomous snakes, teeth bared, instantly surrounded the armored figure, spewing icy flames.  The terrible cold seemed to freeze the void, with black flames rising as well.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang brushed past the armored figure, moving with astonishing speed toward the smaller demon.</p><p>Then, he saw the demon's arched back swell with a black orb.  The orb exploded, transforming into a screen of grey mist, engulfing Qin Sang.</p><p>A flash of lightning appeared before Qin Sang, the scorpion's tail approaching in an instant, its barb radiating a dangerous gleam.</p><p>They wouldn't have brought Qin Sang along without taking precautions, but they hadn't anticipated such a sudden and ferocious attack.</p><p>Faced with the scorpion's tail inches away, Qin Sang didn't even look. His Dharma form and the power of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal activated simultaneously.  Wearing the Ming Shan armor, he deployed all his defenses without reservation.</p><p>With a 'bang', the barb struck the side of Qin Sang's neck, but failed to pierce the armor, flying back immediately.</p><p>Qin Sang merely swayed, his forward momentum unbroken. A blood thorn appeared in his palm as he struck the encroaching grey mist.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A large hole was ripped through the grey mist.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to break through.</p><p>At this moment, the smaller demon was utterly terrified. Its two divine abilities not only failed to harm Qin Sang, but couldn't even hinder him for a moment.</p><p>In its terror, the smaller demon frantically tried to shatter the jade bracelet on its right wrist.</p><p>But as this thought occurred, sword light crisscrossed and descended from the heavens, an overwhelming murderous intent assaulting its spirit.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, his forward momentum increasing threefold. He grabbed the scorpion tail, pulling it back, unleashing the full force of his blood essence imprint.</p><p>He had previously noticed the jade bracelet's flashing, and its connection to the demon's slowing speed.  He suspected it was a communication artifact, and had planned accordingly to prevent the demon from destroying it.</p><p>From Qin Sang's attack to this moment, only an instant had passed.</p><p>The two demons never imagined that they, outnumbered two to one, would be completely overwhelmed and rendered helpless.</p><p>By the time the smaller demon realized the danger and attempted to shatter the bracelet to signal for help, it was too late!</p><p>'Pfft!'</p><p>Qin Sang's palm landed on the smaller demon's nape.</p><p>The blood thorn pierced a hole in its body.</p><p>This strike contained the full power of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, instantly causing the smaller demon to spurt blood as its spine shattered.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the killing sword descended, striking the demon's head, killing it instantly.</p><p>Qin Sang's hand, like lightning, seized the trembling jade bracelet, about to seal it, when his expression changed drastically. He stared intently at the corpse of the smaller demon.</p><p>As the demon expired, a strange ripple spread through the air, dissolving into nothingness.</p>
