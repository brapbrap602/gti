<h1>Chapter 1261: The Star River Atlas</h1><p>The four of them activated their magical treasures simultaneously, directing their attacks toward the ancient restriction.</p><p>The Yin Thunder Gourd spewed forth countless bolts of yin thunder, which then merged together, forming a dark, ominous cloud that shimmered with faint, ghostly lightning. Yet, within this darkness, there was a subtle hint of yang energy. This treasure had been crafted by the Netherdark Demon Lord, who had gathered the most yin-heavy earth-fiend energy and refined it with demonic techniques, infusing it with heavenly thunder. Over time, through continuous refinement, it had transformed into yin thunder. Apart from his life-bound treasure, this was the artifact the Netherdark Demon Lord had invested the most effort into.</p><p>Qin Sang, as usual, relied on his demonic flames as his primary means of attack. He summoned all eighteen demon banners, preparing for any unexpected situations that might arise after entering the ancient restriction. However, he held back slightly in their activation, making it seem as though he was only using twelve banners, much like before. Even so, the power of the demonic flames was enough to draw attention. The Netherdark Demon Lord couldn’t help but glance at them a few more times.</p><p>Jing Yu, on the other hand, had already transformed into her demonic form, standing ready for battle. The Thunder Bead hovered in front of her as she exhaled streams of vital energy, which landed on the bead. The Thunder Bead began to glow brightly, and within its depths, a small shadow of a Thunder Falcon took shape. Like an arrow released from a bow, it shot toward the ancient restriction.</p><p>The attacks of the three arrived almost simultaneously, striking in unison.</p><p>The Five Directions Pagoda of Qing Jun was the fastest. The essence of the Five Directions Pagoda lay in the word "suppress." It was a treasure of suppression, capable of dominating all directions and even repelling attacks directed at its wielder. This ability could also be applied to the ancient restriction. The pagoda itself was no larger than a palm, emitting a faint black light, and it didn’t radiate the imposing aura of a top-tier treasure. However, as it flew above the ancient restriction, it suddenly halted, and a massive shadow of the pagoda materialized in the void, identical to the original. The moment the shadow appeared, the surrounding blood mist ceased its flow. The fluctuations from the collision of the grand formation were also blocked by an invisible barrier.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The shadow of the pagoda descended directly onto the ancient restriction, suppressing its fluctuations. At the same time, the attacks of Qin Sang and the others followed closely, piercing through the shadow.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The demonic flames, yin thunder, and demonic shadow merged perfectly, striking the weakest point of the ancient restriction. The restriction, already crisscrossed with cracks, was unable to retaliate in time. Under the force of the combined attack, the cracks rapidly spread, and the ancient restriction shattered into fragments, scattering in all directions.</p><p>The shockwave from the destruction of the ancient restriction formed a terrifying hurricane. However, thanks to the suppression of the Five Directions Pagoda, its power had been significantly weakened. By the time it reached Qin Sang and the others, they were able to barely withstand it by activating their treasures.</p><p>At the same time, the ancient restriction began to glow brightly, its energy surging toward the damaged areas. Although they had managed to break through the restriction by exploiting its existing weaknesses, their strength was insufficient to deal a fatal blow to its core. The restriction would eventually repair itself. The Five Directions Pagoda continued to tremble, its shadow stubbornly suppressing the restriction and slowing its recovery.</p><p>The Netherdark Demon Lord, with the Yin Thunder Gourd hovering above his head, led the charge, using the yin thunder to clear the way as he swiftly entered the ancient restriction. Qin Sang and Jing Yu followed closely behind, while Qing Jun retrieved the Five Directions Pagoda and brought up the rear.</p><p>Meanwhile, as they attacked the ancient restriction, the figures within the blood pool had already sensed their presence.</p><p>...</p><p>Above the blood pool, Elder Ye, the Blood Demon Avatar, and Elder Tianzheng were fully focused on breaking the seal. Elder Tianzheng, concerned about the ongoing battle, occasionally glanced toward the entrance of the blood pool. Seeing that the banner formation remained stable, firmly blocking the intruders, he felt reassured.</p><p>The three figures were performing the same secret technique, rapidly inscribing runes into the blood pool. Some of the runes merged into the blood, while others floated toward the black chains. Under their relentless efforts, the seal on the blood pool was on the verge of being broken. The blood within the pool could no longer remain calm, waves surging and pulling at the chains, creating a cacophony of clattering sounds.</p><p>At that moment, Elder Tianzheng suddenly sensed the fluctuations from the ancient restriction. His expression changed drastically, and he immediately realized what had happened. With a cry of alarm, he darted toward the source of the disturbance.</p><p>Elder Ye and the Blood Demon Avatar, however, paid no attention to the outside world, ignoring Elder Tianzheng's actions. Instead, they increased the speed of their spellcasting, racing against time to break the seal!</p><p>Elder Tianzheng's face darkened. It seemed that their opponents were just as knowledgeable about the blood lake as they were. Not only had they quickly located the core of the Black Tower Formation and tracked them down, but they also knew exactly where the ancient restriction was weakest. They had only obtained this information after extracting memories from the ancient demon. How had their opponents come to know it?</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through Elder Tianzheng's mind, he saw a crack appear in the ancient restriction ahead, from which a familiar yin thunder aura emanated.</p><p>"Netherdark Demon Lord!" Elder Tianzheng snorted coldly. He had clashed with the Netherdark Demon Lord several times before and immediately recognized his presence. He didn’t know how many others were following behind the demon lord.</p><p>Elder Tianzheng knew he couldn’t allow them to break through and disrupt Elder Ye's efforts to break the seal. With a wave of his sleeve, a streak of starlight shot through the blood mist. Within the starlight was a scroll, which slowly unfurled to reveal an endless expanse of deep space. Stars began to appear, forming a vast galaxy—it was the Star River Atlas.</p><p>Though it appeared to be a mere painting, the starry sky depicted on it seemed to be real, with the stars constantly shifting. As the Star River Atlas fully unfolded, the scroll suddenly vanished, and with it, the ever-present blood mist disappeared. The space around them transformed into the starry sea depicted on the atlas, sealed off by the treasure.</p><p>The Netherdark Demon Lord had just passed through the ancient restriction when he found himself in a chaotic void, different from what Jing Yu had described. Ahead, an enormous star, trailing a long comet tail, hurtled toward him with terrifying momentum!</p><p>In the face of the star, the Netherdark Demon Lord felt as insignificant as an ant. Just as the star was about to crush him into dust, he showed no fear and coldly said, "The Star River Atlas! Elder Tianzheng, so you're here too!"</p><p>As he spoke, the Yin Thunder Gourd above his head trembled, releasing countless bolts of yin thunder that surged toward the star. The imposing star, upon being struck by the yin thunder, shattered like an illusion pierced by a needle, disintegrating into nothingness.</p><p>The Netherdark Demon Lord emerged unscathed, and Elder Tianzheng's voice echoed in his ears, filled with menace. "Netherdark Demon Lord, I underestimated you to have tracked us here! But do you know what lies sealed beneath this place? Ignorant fool, beware of perishing here!"</p><p>The Netherdark Demon Lord laughed coldly and retorted sharply, "It’s nothing more than an ancient cultivator sealed here, enduring endless torment and isolation! Even if they haven’t turned into a demon, they must have gone mad by now! By recklessly breaking the blood pool’s seal and releasing this demon, have you considered the billions of lives in the Northern Star Realm?"</p><p>Hearing this, Elder Tianzheng’s heart trembled. The Netherdark Demon Lord clearly knew a great deal about this place, understanding both the blood pool’s seal and the ancient cultivator. Elder Tianzheng’s thoughts raced. Unlike the Sin Abyss, which had only learned of the blood lake after extracting memories from the ancient demon, the Frost Domain had known of its existence for a long time. Could they have visited the blood pool before?</p>
