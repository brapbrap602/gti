<h1>Chapter 721: A Feint to the East, an Attack to the West</h1><p>After losing sight of the man in black armor and flying for some time to ensure he wasn’t being followed, Qin Sang suddenly stopped.  He turned towards Han Yan Island, a hesitant expression on his face. After a moment's contemplation, he looked around, landed on a nearby small island, and set up a concealed spirit array, hiding himself there. He had a sudden idea, but he wasn't sure if it was feasible.</p><p>He deployed the Ten Directions Yama Banner, activating the Nine Nether Magic Fire. The magic fire gathered into a ball, and at a gesture from Qin Sang, obediently settled into his palm. Qin Sang stared at the Nine Nether Magic Fire, sensing its aura, and fell into thought.</p><p>Undeniably, the power displayed by the Nine Nether Magic Fire was only equivalent to that of a mid-grade magic treasure, vastly inferior to the Han Yan Flame. Even a tiny wisp of the Han Yan Flame was far more terrifying.</p><p>However, this wasn't the true form of the Nine Nether Magic Fire. Its true form was sealed within the Ten Directions Yama Banner, suppressed by the Xuan Tie pillar that formed the banner's pole, and the power it displayed was merely the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Both Qin Sang and the former Kui Yin Patriarch could only manipulate the Nine Nether Magic Fire by using the magic banner. The Xuan Tie pillar was extremely mysterious, its restrictions intricate and causing the Nine Nether Magic Fire to be fearful.</p><p>As his alchemy skills rapidly improved, Qin Sang’s understanding of the Xuan Tie pillar deepened. He had previously considered using it to forge other magic treasures, but now he dared not even think about it.</p><p>The Jade Robe Daoist tried to use the Xuan Tie pillar to forge a lifebound treasure. The insights he left behind were merely wishful thinking. Had the Jade Robe Daoist not been killed and successfully achieved reincarnation through body snatching, and had the opportunity to attempt it, he would surely have suffered a bitter failure, wasting high-grade spirit stones in vain.</p><p>The restrictions within the Xuan Tie pillar were exceptionally profound and seamlessly integrated; even the powerful Kui Yin Patriarch couldn't reshape it. It was only because the Xuan Tie pillar was damaged for some reason that a slight flaw was found, allowing for a clever separation without harming the treasure’s essence.</p><p>Without the Xuan Tie pillar, the Nine Nether Magic Fire, like the Han Yan Flame, would be impossible for anyone to subdue.</p><p>So, could there be strengths, weaknesses, and rankings among different types of spirit flames and magic fires?  Qin Sang kept pondering this thought. Having come into close contact with the Dong Ming Han Yan Flame and compared it to the Nine Nether Magic Fire sealed in the Ten Directions Yama Banner, he felt the Nine Nether Magic Fire should be stronger.</p><p>This was evident from observing the Kui Yin Patriarch and Dong Ming Shangren. Dong Ming Shangren failed to break through to the late Yuan Ying stage, while the Kui Yin Patriarch could use the Ten Directions Yama Array to suppress the small Han Yan domain – and that was only a fraction of the Nine Nether Magic Fire's power.</p><p>He naturally didn't dare to covet the undivided Dong Ming Han Yan Flame. The power of spirit flames is also related to their quantity. Compared to such a large mass of Han Yan Flame, the Nine Nether Magic Fire sealed within the three Ten Directions Yama Banners was too little; it might even be swallowed up.</p><p>However, there might be a chance with the divided Dong Ming Han Yan Flame. Qin Sang's cultivation was insignificant compared to the Hun Tian Island Master, but he possessed something the Yuan Ying Patriarch did not.  </p><p>Being fellow spirit flames, could he, using the Ten Directions Yama Banner and the Nine Nether Magic Fire, suppress the Dong Ming Han Yan Flame's volatility and take it away?  Qin Sang knew very little about celestial spirit flames; this was merely a conjecture.</p><p>If he could take away a wisp of the Dong Ming Han Yan Flame, even if he couldn't subdue it in the end, he could at least use it as a weapon against enemies, employing a surprise attack. At the very least, late-stage Foundation Establishment experts would only have the option of fleeing when faced with the Dong Ming Han Yan Flame.</p><p>This risk was worth taking! Even offending the Hun Tian Island Master and Mu Lao Mo wouldn't be a problem; the Inner and Outer Seas were vast and boundless. He was a lone wolf; he could just hide for a while and keep a low profile afterward.</p><p>What could they do to him?  Reaching this point, Qin Sang made up his mind to try. The only obstacle was the man in black armor; retrieving the Dong Ming Han Yan Flame would take time, and he needed to lure him away first.</p><p>Qin Sang patiently waited on the island for five full days. At noon on the sixth day, under the bright sun, he quietly left the island to carry out his "fire-theft" operation.</p><p>After leaving the island, Qin Sang released his two-headed flying beast, concealed his aura, and whispered a few words. After hearing this, the two heads of the beast shook rapidly, refusing outright.</p><p>Qin Sang used both coercion and enticement, finally bringing the two-headed beast around. This plan would have failed if not for the two-headed beast's unique characteristics.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, and said, "Help me steal the Dong Ming Han Yan Flame, and I promise that once I break through to the late Foundation Establishment stage, I'll set you free immediately!"</p><p>The two-headed beast raised its head, staring at Qin Sang with suspicion.</p><p>"I swear on my inner demons...Will that do?"</p><p>Protected by the jade Buddha, Qin Sang wasn't afraid of his inner demons, but he wouldn't deceive a beast.  Once he broke through to late Jindan stage, he could just replace the two-headed beast.  It wasn't a big deal.</p><p>The two-headed beast let out a low growl, seemingly warning Qin Sang not to break his word. Then, it silently spread its wings and flew north, planning to approach Cold Flame Island from behind in a wide arc to draw the attention of the black-armored man.</p><p>The black-armored man was stationed there by order and would be alerted to any unusual beast activity.</p><p>Although the two-headed beast was a level below, it possessed the Shadow Splitting technique, a powerful life-saving ability.  It didn't need to engage the black-armored man in close combat; a little maneuvering should be enough.</p><p>However, Qin Sang couldn't predict how long the two-headed beast would last and prepared himself for failure.</p><p>Releasing the two-headed beast, Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. He then summoned his scroll, vanished on the spot, and silently approached Cold Flame Island.</p><p>He had already tested the black-armored man's range of perception.  He stopped at the edge of that range, quietly submerged himself beneath the water, and remained motionless.</p><p>At the same time, he released the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly, hidden from sight, continued flying forward to scout for Qin Sang.</p><p>The black-armored man's cultivation was too high, so Qin Sang didn't dare let the butterfly get too close.  Being able to see the man's movements was enough.</p><p>Ripples disturbed the sea's surface.</p><p>The Sky Eye Butterfly perched discreetly on a wave crest, rising and falling with the waves.  After a while, a sea breeze sprang up from the east, gradually intensifying the waves – a common occurrence in the Demon Sea.</p><p>The black-armored man was alerted and surfaced.</p><p>Everything around seemed normal.  The black-armored man frowned slightly, then his gaze sharpened as he fixed on a point in the eastern sky.  A black spear appeared in his palm, and he hurled it with force.</p><p>The spear shot like lightning.  The sharp sound of it breaking the air had barely begun when the spear arrived.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Under the spear's powerful impact, a crooked figure was forced out of the void, appearing quite disheveled.</p><p>The two-headed beast landed on the sea surface, steadied itself, bared its fangs at the black-armored man, and let out a ferocious growl.</p><p>"Beast!"</p><p>The black-armored man's expression turned serious.</p><p>He didn't rush to attack the two-headed beast.  Secretly, he flipped his other hand, revealing a jade talisman that looked similar to a message talisman but had far more intricate and complex runes.  He held the talisman upside down.  His gaze remained locked on the two-headed beast, while his peripheral vision carefully scanned the surroundings for other beasts.</p>
