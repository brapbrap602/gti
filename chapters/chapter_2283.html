<h1>Chapter 2272: Another Five Years</h1><p>Soul contracts, bound to the soul, cannot be broken unless the person who made it chooses to release it.  Even if the other party possesses incredible power, they can't undo it.  It's the same as with the immortal emperor, Little Yellow Chicken.  Even though he was only a God King before, and the other was an Emperor, he couldn't resolve such an agreement. To prevent this guy from changing his mind and causing a backlash, the Master Continent specifically stipulated that even if someone transcends the Heavenly Dao records, they cannot escape the soul contract!</p><p>“Soul contracts indeed can't be severed from the consciousness sea, but I've integrated a special energy that can dissolve even the Heavenly Dao.  Dissolving this contract isn't difficult...  With enough power, bombarding the location of the contract will do the trick!”</p><p>the ruthless person said.</p><p>Soul contracts are based on the Heavenly Dao; special energy can even dissolve the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm, so dissolving a soul contract, if handled properly, is nothing difficult.</p><p>“So that's how it is…” Zhang Xuan's eyes flickered.</p><p>“I've explained all this as a thank you for bringing me to the God Realm!”</p><p>After the explanation, the ruthless person didn't say more. Their aura grew more ancient and distant, and the black hole behind them grew larger, clearly having absorbed an unknown amount of power during the conversation, strengthening themselves.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, the more the black hole absorbs, the stronger he gets…”</p><p>Luo Ruoxi also noticed something was wrong and hurriedly transmitted a message.</p><p>“Prepare to fight!” With his doubts resolved, Zhang Xuan took a deep breath, raised his sword, and said, “If so, let's settle this with our skills!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The most powerful sword intent was unleashed again.</p><p>To live, to return; to die, to yearn forever!</p><p>Life and death hold no fear; what can stop me?</p><p>This sword technique, although not at the level of an Emperor's understanding, contained all his convictions, pushing the Tian Ru You Qing technique to its limit.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>One sword cleaved the ruthless person's attack in half.</p><p>At the same time, Luo Ruoxi also made her move, her jade hand swirling, her sword light like snow.</p><p>Her swordsmanship was somewhat similar to the young man from Sword God Heaven, possessing an unstoppable momentum and the effortless grace of the Dao.</p><p>“Your skills are impressive, but compared to me, they're still lacking…”</p><p>With a light smile, the ruthless person reached down again.</p><p>In an instant, the hand obscured the sky and sun, engulfing the heavens and earth, shattering space, and seemingly about to crush the stars and sun.</p><p>*Puff!* *Puff!*</p><p>Zhang Xuan and Luo Ruoxi were both sent flying, spraying blood in the air.</p><p>Even with their strength, they couldn't withstand it!</p><p>What level of cultivation has this guy reached?</p><p>“Audacious!”  The clone strode forward; with each step, lotuses bloomed, and the sound of flowing water echoed through the void.</p><p>From afar, it looked incredibly impressive.</p><p>Having refined the Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus, his cultivation was no less than Zhang Xuan’s.</p><p>He raised a fist, and his power soared to the heavens.</p><p>Clashing with the ruthless person, he too was sent flying, unable to withstand a single blow.</p><p>Zhang Xuan clutched his forehead.</p><p>Even after becoming an Emperor, the clone still couldn't help but show off…</p><p>That flashy display was less effective than concentrating his power for a greater impact!</p><p>“Attack together, or they’ll die, and we'll all die…”</p><p>Little Yellow Chicken roared, crimson flames burning, igniting the sky.</p><p>The remaining six Emperors also unleashed their powers.</p><p>Seven Emperors united, their power capable of destroying heaven and earth; even the world itself couldn't withstand them. But their opponent was the ruthless person, who had absorbed special power. When their attack arrived, the black hole suddenly expanded, swallowing their power in the blink of an eye, and then counterattacked.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>The seven Emperors, like Zhang Xuan and the others, were sent flying.</p><p>Ten Emperors combined, and they still couldn't withstand a single blow from their opponent!</p><p>How could this person be so strong?</p><p>“You may all die now…”</p><p>Having shattered everyone's attacks, the ruthless person stepped forward, flipped their wrist, and struck again.</p><p>“You dare!”</p><p>With a roar, the elder from Sword God Heaven suddenly appeared, blocking the attack, his sword transforming into a silver river.</p><p>“An Emperor? He's also an Emperor?”</p><p>Zhang Xuan's pupils constricted.</p><p>This elder had followed the young man, and he'd assumed he was merely a follower, at most a titled God King. Only after witnessing his power did he realize he was also an Emperor!</p><p>If he was an Emperor, what was the young man?</p><p>“He's an Emperor of Sword God Heaven…” Luo Ruoxi, struggling to stand, gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Then…the young man who taught me swordsmanship?” Zhang Xuan couldn't help but ask.</p><p>“He is…”  Luo Ruoxi was about to answer, when space distorted, and they saw the Sword God Heaven Emperor also sent flying, crashing into the ground and creating a huge crater.</p><p>Zhang Xuan, with his current strength and understanding of the sword Dao, far surpassed the elder, yet still couldn't win. Even with his strong cultivation and superb swordsmanship, he was still no match.</p><p>"Haha, Emperor!  They're nothing but a pack of weaklings! Today, I will destroy the Nine Heavens, annihilate this divine realm, and crush all its rules!"</p><p>The fierce warrior laughed maniacally after defeating the Emperor of Jian Shen Tian.  The surrounding space continuously collapsed, making him appear demonic and monstrous.</p><p>"What do we do?" Zhang Xuan clenched his fists.</p><p>He and his clone had unleashed their full power, and even Luo Ruoxi had used her strongest technique, yet they couldn't withstand a single blow…</p><p>Could it be that no one in the divine realm could stop him?</p><p>Allow him to destroy the world?</p><p>"The only way… is to return the flawed Heavenly Dao fragment to its whole, allowing the Heavenly Dao to suppress him…" Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists, her eyes reddening.</p><p>"Return it to its whole?" Zhang Xuan understood what she meant.</p><p>The library in his mind was a part of the Heavenly Dao. Once it returned, the Heavenly Dao would be complete, perhaps repairing the flaw and expelling the warrior.</p><p>Like a human immune system.</p><p>A complete immune system easily repels viruses; a damaged one can't resist viral invasion, causing even the strongest person to die.</p><p>But…</p><p>"He's too powerful. Even if the Heavenly Dao is restored, it might not be able to suppress him!" Zhang Xuan shook his head.</p><p>The immune system can kill viruses, but… a tiger?</p><p>What can even the strongest immune system do?</p><p>This warrior, merely a common God King, even with a title, could easily be killed by the Heavenly Dao. Yet, he's stronger than the Emperor… beyond the Heavenly Dao's ability to counter.</p><p>"This…" Luo Ruoxi paused, a look of despair crossing her fair face. "Yes… we can't suppress him.  But with the Heavenly Dao complete, he can awaken, and killing this warrior won't be difficult!"</p><p>"He?" Zhang Xuan frowned.</p><p>"I'll take you to him, in Zi Zai Tian…" Taking a deep breath, Luo Ruoxi gritted her teeth and flew forward.</p><p>"Trying to escape?" The fierce warrior sneered, and pressed down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Luo Ruoxi fell from the sky.</p><p>"You…" Zhang Xuan unleashed his swordsmanship again, his sword intent brilliant.</p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p>He was blocked again.</p><p>"Go! I'll hold him off…"</p><p>Knowing they needed to find another way to save the divine realm, not escape, the clone and the Immortal Emperor shouted, standing in front. Luo Qiqi transformed back into her Jing Kong Pearl form.</p><p>Space solidified around them.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Seeing everyone selflessly standing in front, unafraid of death, Zhang Xuan's eyes reddened. However, he knew this wasn't the time to talk.  He grabbed Luo Ruoxi, his body flickered, ripping through space, and in an instant, they arrived in the vicinity of Zi Zai Tian.</p><p>Zi Zai Tian was no longer tranquil. The divine realm was collapsing, chaos everywhere.</p><p>"Where's the person you mentioned?"</p><p>Having no time to observe the plight of the common people, Zhang Xuan looked at the girl in his arms.</p><p>If this person could truly save the divine realm, what did his own sacrifice matter!</p><p>"He's my father. The blood in your pendant is his. The Immortal Emperor was once his pet…" Luo Ruoxi caught her breath, explaining.</p><p>"Father?"</p><p>Zhang Xuan suddenly understood.</p><p>No wonder he always felt the blood in the pendant was similar to Luo Ruoxi's yet different. It belonged to her father.</p><p>This also explained why the Immortal Emperor's remaining consciousness immediately acknowledged him as its master after seeing the pendant.</p><p>"Your father is also an Emperor? Or possesses power exceeding that of an Emperor?"</p><p>He couldn't help but ask.</p><p>The library's chaos was resolved by the blood in the pendant, restoring his clarity.  Could it be that not only was she the daughter of an Emperor, but her father was one too, perhaps even stronger?</p><p>If so, why was he unconscious?</p><p>Why was a flawed Heavenly Dao needed to awaken him?</p><p>"He isn't an Emperor, but… the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi clenched her fists.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao? Your father… is the Heavenly Dao?" Zhang Xuan was shocked, disbelieving.</p><p>"Yes! Fifty years ago, Father couldn't withstand that attack, falling into a coma. The Heavenly Dao shattered into three parts: the Ordered Heavenly Dao, the Flawed Heavenly Dao, and the Natural Heavenly Dao. The latter two entered spatial currents. I took over the Natural Heavenly Dao to maintain the balance of the divine realm. To restore him, we need to gather the scattered fragments… That's why I'm so determined, why I can't fail! That's why I specifically went to the Master's Continent, studied the Spring and Autumn Annals, and tried to defeat Kong Shi!  The favor I asked of Kong Shi was also related to this."</p><p>Luo Ruoxi explained.</p><p>Zhang Xuan understood.</p><p>They had met on the Master's Continent not long ago, and she had already told him her story – saving a loved one.  He didn't understand then, but now it was clear.</p><p>It was her father, and he was the Heavenly Dao of the divine realm!</p><p>Could the Heavenly Dao truly take human form and have children?</p><p>"Controlling the Natural Heavenly Dao… you don't have a Heavenly Dao fragment within you?"  Suddenly realizing the inconsistency in her words, Zhang Xuan looked at her.</p><p>Controlling someone else and merging with them are two entirely different concepts.</p><p>"I merely control it; I'm not a part of the Heavenly Dao..." Luo Ruoxi said.</p><p>Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>This meant he only needed to separate the Heavenly Dao flaw from her, without needing her to die.  He didn't want her to be hurt, even though he wasn't happy about this turn of events.</p><p>"If I separate the Heavenly Dao flaw from within me, your father will live, and we can even defeat the Ruthless One, right?" Zhang Xuan asked.</p><p>"That... I'm not sure..."</p><p>Looking up at the shattered God Realm, Luo Ruoxi hesitated.  The God Realm was her father's foundation. Even if he regained consciousness, could he really defeat such a powerful opponent with their foundation in ruins? It was hard to say.</p><p>"It seems you're not certain either.  If that's the case, we'll rely on ourselves! We have to find our own way!" Zhang Xuan gritted his teeth. "You, me, my clone, along with the Nine Heavens Nine Emperors, and if we can also get Master Kong, we might stand a chance!"</p><p>"Master Kong? He..." Luo Ruoxi frowned.</p><p>"Master Kong is dead, you say!  He's not truly dead. If I'm not mistaken, his supposed death at your hands was just a way to escape the Heavenly Dao's control...  He should be, like Wei Changfeng, a 'Primordial Soul Body'!"</p><p>Zhang Xuan stated.</p><p>Seeing Wei Changfeng clarified things. Master Kong's ability to retain his consciousness was likely due to being a Primordial Soul Body, capable of remaining lucid even before birth.  With the preparations he'd made beforehand, his resurrection was only a matter of time.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was stunned; she hadn't expected this.</p><p>"Let's go take a look. If I'm right, he should have already recovered. Otherwise, his students wouldn't have stayed away from the Tidal Sea..." Zhang Xuan said.</p><p>Master Kong's students, like Zi Yuan Gu Sheng and others, were all incredibly strong. Even without the Emperors' help, they would have found a way to enter the Tidal Sea, yet none of them had.  There must have been something more important, something they were waiting to do while all the Emperors were preoccupied at the Tidal Sea!  And that important task was clearly Master Kong's recovery.</p><p>"This..." Luo Ruoxi was shaken, suddenly understanding.</p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p>Without further explanation, with a flick of his hand, Zhang Xuan reappeared at Master Kong's residence.  There, they saw an old man levitating cross-legged in the air, who smiled faintly upon seeing them.  "You've come."</p><p>It was none other than Master Kong!  This master of ages hadn't disappointed!  Just as he'd guessed, he'd resurrected while everyone's attention was focused on the Tidal Sea.</p><p>"You..." Luo Ruoxi trembled.</p><p>She knew Emperors could be resurrected; even the Immortal Emperors had been revived, but... she hadn't expected it to be so fast!</p><p>"I concealed it from the Heavenly Dao; I had a contingency plan in place. The nameless giant in the Ghost Pool was my creation. When you killed it, I used the opportunity to break free from the Heavenly Dao's constraints, and I've just recently reconstituted my physical form," Master Kong smiled gently.</p><p>He was adept at manipulating time. While it seemed only a day or two had passed in the God Realm, he'd actually spent an unknown amount of time recovering his strength, perhaps decades.</p><p>"The three of us are very strong, but defeating the Ruthless One won't be easy..."</p><p>Seeing Master Kong's recovery, Luo Ruoxi still shook her head.  It wasn't about diminishing their own courage or bolstering the enemy's; it was simply the truth.  Even with so many combined forces just now, they hadn't been able to stop the opponent. Even with Master Kong, what difference would it make?  It wouldn't change the situation!</p><p>"Individually, or even combined, we are no match for the opponent. But... what if we merged everyone's power into a single person?"</p><p>Master Kong looked at them, a smile on his face.</p><p>"Merge into one person?"</p><p>This time, not only Luo Ruoxi frowned, but Zhang Xuan was also puzzled.</p><p>"That hand could tear apart the God Realm and shatter the Heavenly Dao itself. The strength is undeniable. The Ruthless One absorbed all that power, and consumed fifty years' worth of the God Realm's spiritual energy. In terms of individual strength, even if we take out ten or more Emperors, they wouldn't be a match..."</p><p>Master Kong said, "But if we combine our power, concentrating it on one person... it might be different."</p><p>"How do we concentrate it?"</p><p>Luo Ruoxi looked at him.</p><p>It was easier said than done.  The Emperors were already at the peak of the God Realm; if absorbing others' power were so easy, she wouldn't have been stagnant for so many years.</p><p>"It's simple... we concentrate our power on Zhang Xuan.  If he can break through the Emperor's shackles, he can save the God Realm!"</p><p>Master Kong stated.</p><p>“Me?” Zhang Xuan was startled.  “Why me?”</p><p>“Lingxi Di Zun’s cultivation is about freedom and transcendence! But with the constraints of his father and Heaven's Dao, and with loved ones, he can never truly transcend! If I’m not mistaken, during our fight, you also gave up, intending to be killed by me!”  Kong Shi said.</p><p>Luo Ruoxi was speechless.</p><p>During the battle, she had indeed considered this, so their initial exchange was more like sparring than a life-or-death struggle.</p><p>“Inability to transcend naturally means you can't unleash your full power. Even with more true energy, you can't break through to the highest realm! As for me…”</p><p>Kong Shi nodded. “I care for all beings, wanting to save the world, yet unwilling to let others sacrifice for me. Too much compassion is a flaw! If I had been ruthless, exterminating the Yiling, we wouldn’t be in this situation…”</p><p>If he had killed all the Yiling back then, the ruthless one wouldn’t have resurrected, and this wouldn't be happening.</p><p>“So, I’m not suitable either! But Zhang Xuan, his cultivation method is perfectly suited to him, without flaws. He values living authentically; even if he dies, as long as he lives without regret, his heart is at peace.  Such a person has greater tolerance and potential for growth. Only then can he go higher and further!”</p><p>Kong Shi continued.  Life returns, death brings longing remembrance!</p><p>Someone who doesn’t fear death won’t be bound by other things.</p><p>“This…” Zhang Xuan frowned, about to speak, when he saw Kong Shi’s intense gaze.  “Don’t refuse. Even if we had time to train others, I don’t think anyone could do better. While Lingxi Di Zun doesn’t have a Heaven’s Dao fragment, he has long controlled Heaven’s Dao and has his own understanding of it; I control Heaven’s Dao orderly. If we infuse our power into you, you will possess the complete power of Heaven’s Dao! Combined with your clone’s Nine Heavens Chaos Golden Lotus, you can definitely stabilize the nine heavens, control the universe, battle the nine skies, and destroy all things!”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Seeing that the decision was made, Zhang Xuan nodded, knowing further explanation was useless.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He sat cross-legged, and in the blink of an eye, two powerful forces surged from both sides.</p><p>Zhang Xuan’s body stiffened; he felt like he instantly became Heaven’s Dao, soaring through the nine heavens.</p><p>His soul, body, and true energy were instantly cleansed, growing stronger and more powerful.</p><p>…</p><p>“You want to stop me too? Fine, I’ll kill you first, then Zhang Xuan…”</p><p>After sending Luo Qiqi and his clone flying, the ruthless one sneered coldly.</p><p>The combined power of the clone and the many emperors was indeed powerful, but still weaker than him.</p><p>The Tide Sea had absorbed almost all the spiritual energy outside the city in the God Realm, now this power was his sustenance, his every move possessed the power to destroy the world.  These emperors and god kings, though representing the pinnacle of the God Realm, were no match.</p><p>The ruthless one seemed to represent the entire God Realm, unstoppable.</p><p>“The God Realm is destroyed, our lives are meaningless. I, Yun Chi, will die with you…”</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi transformed into his true form—a gigantic five-clawed golden dragon—and lunged at him.</p><p>“You?  Not worthy!”</p><p>The ruthless one pinched his hand, and the golden dragon was trapped in his palm, unable to escape.</p><p>“Old friend, wait for me!”</p><p>Fu Meng Di Jun roared, transforming into his white tiger form and leaping into the air.</p><p>Bu Si Di Jun’s不死火凤  true form appeared, its flames illuminating the sky.</p><p>Xuan Ming Dadi’s true form was a giant tortoise, seeming to support the heavens.</p><p>The four divine beasts, guarding the four corners of the God Realm, transformed simultaneously, slowing the collapse of the God Realm.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>With four consecutive strikes, the ruthless one subdued the four beasts, a fierce killing intent flashing in his eyes: “Since you seek death, I’ll grant it…”</p><p>As he was about to kill them, he felt his raised arm tighten, stopping mid-air.</p><p>“Want to kill them? Ask me first…”</p><p>To everyone’s astonishment, a figure slowly descended from the sky.</p><p>It was Zhang Xuan!</p><p>The young man now radiated immense power, ten times stronger than before, descending from the heavens like a world unto himself.</p><p>“Quite the improvement…”</p><p>The ruthless one paused, his gaze serious.</p><p>He couldn’t understand how his opponent’s strength had increased so dramatically in mere minutes.</p><p>“But what difference does it make? Even the God Realm at its peak couldn’t withstand me. I don’t believe you can stop me…”</p><p>With a cold snort, the ruthless one attacked again.</p><p>Zhang Xuan raised his sword and met the attack.</p><p>Their battle tore space apart, sending shockwaves in every direction.</p><p>Could Zhang Xuan win?</p><p>Luo Ruoxi, stationed at Kong Shi's base, watched with worry.</p><p>She and Kong Shi had transferred their power to Zhang Xuan, reducing their own cultivation to the level of a God King, far less glorious than before.  However, their level remained, and as long as their power was sufficient, they would eventually recover.</p><p>"With his current strength, winning is… difficult! Unless… he can grasp power beyond that of an Emperor!" Kong Shi said after a moment of silence.</p><p>Even a dozen Emperors working together couldn't defeat the Ruthless One. Even if they transferred all their power, victory wouldn't be easy.  They did this because… only by concentrating power in one person was there a chance to reach the peak, to truly surpass limits and break through!</p><p>"Power beyond an Emperor?" Luo Ruoxi's gaze drifted.</p><p>Her father, when he was still lucid, had spoken of the same thing, but… she couldn't do it. Could the man she loved?</p><p>"He will… He has an unyielding spirit! And pride in this world."  Kong Shi smiled, seeing her unspoken question.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After several blows, Zhang Xuan's knuckles cracked, and a huge, gruesome wound appeared on his chest. As Kong Shi said, even with their combined power, even with a complete Heavenly Dao within him, he was no match.</p><p>"Haha, I thought you were powerful. You're nothing!" the Ruthless One sneered.</p><p>"I'm no match for you anyway; I'll be killed sooner or later.  Since that's the case, I want to die from your strongest attack…"  Taking a deep breath, Zhang Xuan stopped attacking and looked at the Ruthless One.</p><p>"Fine. I'll grant you that, my strongest attack…"</p><p>Hearing this, the Ruthless One paused, then snorted coldly, raising a hand.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A green light appeared in his palm and slammed down.</p><p>It was indeed his strongest attack. The entire divine realm rumbled, as if it couldn't bear the force, and another huge crater was punched into the ground.</p><p>Eyes closed, Zhang Xuan didn't dodge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His head exploded, his soul scattering.</p><p>"Zhang Xuan…"  Everyone’s faces paled at the sight.</p><p>Luo Qiqì seemed to go mad.</p><p>Yun Chi the Great Emperor and others stared wide-eyed, trembling uncontrollably.</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi were also stunned.</p><p>Their intention was to let him break through his shackles and aim for a realm beyond the Emperor, so why didn't he resist? Why did he willingly accept death?  Wasn't this a waste of their kindness?</p><p>"No, it's the Immortal Emperor's immortal method…"</p><p>Just as they were puzzled, Kong Shi suddenly spoke.</p><p>Everyone then saw that Zhang Xuan, whose head had exploded and whose soul had shattered, had his chest pendant suddenly burst. A drop of blood hovered, ignited, forming a searing flame.  From within the flame, a perfectly unharmed figure slowly emerged.</p><p>"He… used the opponent's power and the blood in the pendant to separate the flawed Heavenly Dao and his soul?" Luo Ruoxi's pupils constricted.</p><p>Zhang Xuan, reborn from the flames, no longer had the Heavenly Dao Library within him, free from the Heavenly Dao's interference!</p><p>"How did he do that?" Kong Shi was equally incredulous.</p><p>The Heavenly Dao and soul were fused together, inseparable. To break free, he had to shatter his soul and use the Nether Soul Pool to re-form it. This man, after a single strike, had completely escaped. How?</p><p>"I know… He used the Ruthless One's method of escaping the soul contract…" Luo Ruoxi realized.</p><p>A soul contract binds master and servant; unless the master releases it, the servant remains bound… The Heavenly Dao Library was similar, a kind of enhanced contract. Bound to the soul, one wouldn't be free until death.</p><p>But… the Ruthless One used a special power to break the soul contract. Zhang Xuan had asked him about the specific method before; he must have had this plan then.</p><p>That's why he deliberately fought to the death, allowing the Ruthless One to unleash his strongest attack. Using this power, he was reborn from the flames, and it was a resounding success!</p><p>"So that's it. That's the way to surpass the Emperor…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan, emerging from the flames, smiled faintly, as if he had understood something.  With a wave of his hand, one of his clones instantly transformed back into a lotus and flew towards him.</p><p>In an instant, it merged perfectly with him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone felt that Zhang Xuan had become the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Heavens were him.</p><p>He lightly stepped on the ground.</p><p>The chaotic Nine Heavens immediately stabilized.</p><p>The Nine Heavens Primordial Golden Lotus, born at the dawn of the Nine Heavens, stabilized the realm.  Zhang Xuan’s avatar and true self achieved perfect fusion, becoming one. He now wielded this power completely.</p><p>Moreover, his already peak cultivation, enhanced by the Lotus, showed signs of a breakthrough, seemingly imminent.</p><p>“Master-servant bond, brotherhood, teacher-student bond, familial love, romantic love…  merged together, they are all things in the world. This… this is humanity!”</p><p>A smile played on Zhang Xuan’s lips as he murmured to himself.</p><p>The moment the Heavenly Dao Library separated from his soul, he understood.</p><p>Did humanity create the world, or did the world precede humanity?  Was it the wind that moved, or the heart?</p><p>This question had plagued countless people throughout eternity.  But now… it didn't matter!</p><p>Without life, without emotion, what meaning did the world have, even if it existed?</p><p>Thus, after transcending romantic love, he reached the love of all beings—the interwoven emotions of the world.  All things possess emotion; emotion creates the world; emotion sustains life.</p><p>Love is emotion.</p><p>Hate is emotion.</p><p>Joy is emotion.</p><p>Suffering is emotion.</p><p>Parting is emotion.</p><p>Reunion is emotion!</p><p>“All emotions, I command them…”</p><p>With a low cry, the shackles on Zhang Xuan's cultivation shattered.  He broke free of the Emperor's restraints!</p><p>In an instant, he touched a new world, a new door.  His soul was rapidly nourished.</p><p>Countless chaotic energies surged toward him, rapidly enhancing his physical body.  Before, he only progressed by absorbing spiritual energy. Now, spatial currents, chaotic energies, even the opponent's green light—all became his, seamlessly integrated.</p><p>“You…” Hen Ren, unable to believe that her all-out attack hadn't killed him but instead empowered him, raged, "Wah wah!"  She roared and attacked again.</p><p>“Your resentment towards the aloof Emperors for not saving you in the spatial currents, that’s emotion;  your feelings of humiliation and anger as my former servant, that’s emotion; your desire to destroy the divine realm to vent your fury, that’s emotion; your desire for greater power, that’s also emotion… Emotion controls you. How can you possibly defeat me, someone who controls emotion?”</p><p>Smiling faintly, Zhang Xuan’s voice grew faster, louder.  With a gentle grasp of his hand, he bound the once invincible Hen Ren with countless threads of emotion, rendering her immobile.</p><p>All who felt emotion were subject to him, controlled by him.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Terror filled Hen Ren's eyes.  “Master Zhang, I am your servant, please don't kill me… I will offer my soul as a sacrifice…”</p><p>“It’s too late for that…” Zhang Xuan smiled faintly and shook his head.  Commanding the emotions of the world rendered the status of a servant meaningless.  After killing so many gods, hurting his girlfriend, Luo Qiqi, and so many friends, how could he forgive her today?</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Sensing his resolve, Hen Ren's pupils constricted.  Before she could finish speaking, intense pain wracked her body.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In an instant, she exploded, transforming into countless spiritual energies that flooded the divine realm.  The energy previously absorbed by the Tidal Sea surged back, revitalizing the desolate wasteland.</p><p>“What…?”</p><p>“She’s… dead?”</p><p>Yun Chi Dadi, the Immortal Emperor, Linglong Xianzi, and others stared wide-eyed, incredulous.  They had fought Hen Ren and knew her terrifying power.  To effortlessly obliterate such a strong opponent… what level of power had Zhang Xuan reached?  Could there be realms beyond the Emperor?</p><p>“He succeeded…”</p><p>Kong Shi and Luo Ruoxi unclenched their fists.</p><p>“This is a fragment of the Heavenly Dao.  Now I return it…”</p><p>Seeing the “Imperfect Heavenly Dao,” separated from his body, still suspended in mid-air, Zhang Xuan smiled softly and flicked his finger.</p><p>Whum!</p><p>The library, his companion since his rebirth, seamlessly integrated into the heavens of the divine realm.  A bell-like resonance echoed.  The crumbling divine realm visibly began to heal, the chaotic currents coalescing.</p><p>The collapse ceased.  The depleted spiritual energy slowly revived with Hen Ren’s death.</p><p>“It seems the divine realm is entering a new era of spiritual recovery…” Zhang Xuan smiled.  The hole in the Tidal Sea, with the Heavenly Dao restored, would heal in time, returning the divine realm to its former glory.</p><p>“Zhang Xuan, come here…”</p><p>A voice echoed in his mind.  Zhang Xuan paused, then took a step.  The distance was immeasurable.  He found a young man standing before him – the one who had taught him swordsmanship.</p><p>“Senior, you…”</p><p>Zhang Xuan stared, surprised.</p><p>I had sensed his unfathomable depth before, but only now do I realize he's just a hair's breadth away from my own level, having reached the absolute peak of a Divine Sovereign. He surpasses Luo Ruoxi by an immeasurable degree.</p><p>"Just call me by my name. I'm... Nie Tong!"  The young man, radiating an indomitable sword intent, said calmly.</p><p>"Nie Tong?" Zhang Xuan frowned.  This was the first time he had heard this name.</p><p>"Come with me. I'll take you to see my brother!"  The young man, Nie Tong, smiled gently and strode forward.</p><p>Zhang Xuan followed closely behind, unsure how far they flew, until they stopped before a mountain peak.  Then he saw another young man.</p><p>His appearance wasn't much different from Nie Tong's; his eyebrows were slightly raised, giving him a profound and unreadable air.</p><p>"His strength…" Zhang Xuan trembled.  This young man's power was even greater than his own; he too had broken through the Divine Sovereign barrier, his cultivation even deeper and more substantial!</p><p>"I am Nie Yun," the young man smiled faintly, turning his gaze to Zhang Xuan. "And… I am Nie Lingxi's father, the father you know as Luo Ruoxi."</p><p>"Ruoxi's father?" Zhang Xuan was shocked. "You… are the Heavenly Dao of the God Realm?"  Luo Ruoxi had mentioned her father was the Heavenly Dao. He never imagined it would be such a young man.</p><p>"I transformed into three through one breath, with one part of my soul becoming the Heavenly Dao! Besides, I created this world, so calling me the Heavenly Dao isn't inaccurate," Nie Yun smiled calmly.</p><p>Zhang Xuan couldn't believe it.  This man created the God Realm?  How powerful must he be?</p><p>"But if you created the God Realm and you are the Heavenly Dao, why did you allow such powerful individuals to wreak havoc without intervening...?" Zhang Xuan asked, his gaze sharp.  If he hadn't broken through, the God Realm might have completely collapsed. Why did this man remain unconcerned?  Did he even care about his daughter's life or death?</p><p>Without answering his question, Nie Yun calmly responded, "Do you believe… that there are even stronger beings above the God Realm?"</p><p>"That…" Zhang Xuan hesitated. "Probably…"  He'd never seen any, but since he could reach this level, perhaps others could, even stronger ones.  Like the one before him.</p><p>"I once suspected that more powerful beings existed above the God Realm, so I used all my strength to probe, ultimately drawing the backlash of a higher world… a hand descended from the heavens!" Nie Yun explained. "If I'd dodged, the entire God Realm might have been erased, leaving not a single life… so I blocked that attack, but as a result, the Heavenly Dao aspect of myself was split."</p><p>"Restoring myself is merely a matter of thought, but… I understand that to truly transcend the God Realm's constraints, to explore the origin of that hand and what lies beyond the God Realm… it's difficult to achieve alone. Therefore, I wanted to see if any lifeforms could break through the Divine Sovereign barrier and reach a level equal to my own!"</p><p>"So, I sent the scattered Heavenly Dao fragments to the lowest world… bestowing them upon souls native to this world, and one soul not of this world. And you, you didn't disappoint me!" Nie Yun chuckled.</p><p>"Not of this world… so my arrival here was because of you?" Zhang Xuan was shaken.  So his transmigration was orchestrated by this man.</p><p>"Hehe," Nie Yun chuckled lightly. "Those native to this world possess a natural reverence for their world, making it much harder for them to break free. It was a fleeting thought, and I didn't expect you to actually succeed…"</p><p>"I…" Zhang Xuan blushed slightly. "Without Kong Shi's selfless dedication, I wouldn't have achieved this level." Without Kong Shi's sacrifice, he wouldn't have reached this realm.</p><p>"I gave him the chance, but he didn't seize it.  His battle with Lingxi was his best chance to break through; unfortunately, he chose to retreat, thinking he had a backup plan to ensure his survival. In reality, he lost his aggressive spirit. When facing those who transcend us, without that spirit, how can one contend?" Nie Yun stated.</p><p>Zhang Xuan remained silent.  He witnessed their battle; Kong Shi truly lacked decisiveness. Or perhaps he didn't want to kill Luo Ruoxi.  This hesitation cost him the chance to advance.</p><p>"If Kong Shi had won, Ruoxi would have died…"  After a moment, Zhang Xuan looked up, his brows furrowed.  Did this man not even care about his daughter's life?</p><p>"With me here, she wouldn't have died," Nie Yun smiled calmly. "Your strength is now almost equal to mine. Do you think the two of you, in a life-or-death situation, could save someone?"</p><p>"That…" Zhang Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p>The Emperor's breakthrough and the Emperor himself are two different concepts. If he were truly willing to intervene, he could certainly save the person at the last moment, ensuring they wouldn't suffer a single scratch.</p><p>"Lingxi is my other wife, Luo Qingcheng's daughter, so her assumed name is Luo… To make her believe, and to avoid emotional entanglement, she has been led to believe I remain in a coma…"</p><p>Nie Yun gave a wry smile: "I guess I've played the role of a ruthless father…  However, you should explain this to her.  Her affections have clearly shifted to you, and I'm sure she's forgotten all about her old father... Haha, I'll disappear for a while. Otherwise, I'm afraid she'll cause a terrible commotion…"</p><p>Zhang Xuan's face twitched at his unreliable father.  He could only agree: "Alright…"</p><p>He had no choice; after all, he had taken his daughter.</p><p>"The Heavenly Dao Library is a manifestation of my will, both my foundation and my constraint.  Your ability to overcome this constraint demonstrates your potential and skill. You have a bright future. As her father, I’m relieved she's with you."</p><p></p>
