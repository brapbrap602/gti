Chapter 1906: Closed Seclusion


Magma churned, and muffled thunder echoed from the depths of the earth.  At the heart of the lake, molten rock surged upwards.  Qin Sang levitated the remnants of the formation, supporting the stone peak that had fallen into the magma lake.  Having passed through Qin Sang's hands, the remnant formation was no longer exactly as it was, now better able to connect with the mountain-protecting grand formation.


Part of the stone peak remained submerged beneath the magma, linked to the remnant formation, standing tall amidst the molten rock. It became a solitary peak at the lake's center, henceforth Qin Sang's cultivation ground.


Qin Sang surveyed his surroundings, making a few minor adjustments before retrieving various spirit materials from the Thousand Jun Ring.  Using his palm as a furnace, he directly refined the spirit materials. In a short time, he crafted a triangular spirit banner and continued until he had a total of nineteen.  These banners could form a spirit formation known as the Blazing Fire Formation, recorded in the *Profound Mysteries Compendium*.  It could connect with the earth's fire veins, gather flames to form a furnace, and also integrate with the mountain-protecting grand formation.  It was perfectly suited for this location.


Among the nineteen banners, one larger banner served as the main banner. With a flick of his wrist, Qin Sang sent the main banner flying. Its surface fluttered, radiating a brilliant light like a raging fire, and landed on the stone peak in the lake's center.  The main banner planted itself atop the peak, its light receding and vanishing.


The remaining eighteen banners also took flight, each landing in a specific location around the lake according to a predetermined pattern.  For a time, flames roared to the heavens.


Violent chaos spread in all directions, the earth shaking and mountains shifting.  Beneath the surface, unseen transformations continued to unfold.


At this point, Qin Sang activated the Four Jia Serpent Seal, commanding the serpent to cease exhaling its chilling breath.  The obstructing ice mountains finally melted. The long-accumulated magma burst its restraints, like a wild horse freed from its reins, surging across the land and flowing into the magma lake.


For several hours, the magma raged before showing signs of receding, returning to its channels.  This region seemed to have undergone a complete transformation.  Across the land, countless magma rivers crisscrossed, like a vast fiery net spreading out from the magma lake.  Beneath the surface, even more dramatic changes had taken place.


As the spirit banners submerged into the magma, the Blazing Fire Formation was completed. The turbulent waves on the lake's surface abruptly calmed.  The stone peak in the center vanished without a trace, along with all signs of spiritual energy fluctuations.


Any outsider arriving here would only perceive an eruption of fire veins colliding with each other, creating this scene. Even if they entered the magma lake, they would detect nothing unusual.


Qin Sang recalled the Four Jia Serpent Seal and the Grey Warbler Sword.  The surrounding light returned to normal. The restraints on the fire spirits vanished, and they awoke, bewildered by the unfamiliar world.  Those with lesser intelligence quickly forgot their worries and began to explore.  The more intelligent fire spirits were gathered by Qin Sang into the magma lake, permitted to dwell within and add a touch of life to his secluded abode.


Gazing at the cultivation ground he had personally crafted, Qin Sang revealed a satisfied expression and stepped into the lake.  A subtle ripple appeared in the void, and Qin Sang's figure vanished in a flash.  Only the raging flames and the churning magma remained.


Qin Sang landed on the mountain peak and summoned the altar. The altar's gate opened, and three streams of light flew out.  The two demons, Gui Hou and Luo Hou, landed and knelt before Qin Sang.


Qin Sang gestured towards the mountain below. "From now on, you will cultivate within this mountain, choosing a location as you see fit."


The two demons, quick-witted, immediately understood that Qin Sang had found his true cultivation ground.  They knew their place and respectfully replied, "We shall diligently perform our duties and never allow any outsiders to intrude upon the mountain and disturb Master's cultivation."


Qin Sang nodded. "Go."


The two demons immediately obeyed, descending to the foot of the mountain and establishing their respective caves on the eastern and western slopes.


*Swish!*


A red streak continuously circled Qin Sang.  Qin Sang raised his hand, allowing the Fire Jade Centipede to land in his palm. "You go too."


The Fire Jade Centipede nuzzled Qin Sang's finger before transforming into a streak of crimson lightning, diving into the magma lake.


He still remembered their first encounter within a magma pool. Now, the Fire Jade Centipede's cultivation remained stagnant at the peak of the Fourth Transformation.  While Qin Sang possessed methods to force a breakthrough, such a burning of potential was less desirable than allowing it to achieve the breakthrough naturally, which might offer a glimmer of hope.


The Fire Jade Centipede's cultivation had fallen far behind.  Whether it was at the Fourth or Fifth Transformation made little difference to Qin Sang.  He did not restrict the centipede's movements and allowed it to cultivate within the Copper Pillar space, leaving its fate to its own efforts.


A red streak circled the stone peak before gradually sinking into the depths.


The cave Qin Sang had prepared for himself was located at the mountain's peak. It was a simple, almost crude stone chamber, nameless and unmarked.


He first went to the remnant formation at the base and placed Zhu Que on the copper pillar.  Zhu Que's small wings twitched, a contented expression on its face as it slept. Its small head nestled into its wings, curling into a ball.


Qin Sang did not wake it, returning instead to his own cave.  Inside were two stone beds.


Qin Sang summoned the Five Elements Crown's spirit and placed it on the opposite bed.  He then took out a Translucent Flower Pill and fed it to the Heavenly Eye Butterfly before sitting down in meditation.


His breath gradually calmed, and the cave fell silent.


After several cycles of cultivation, the cultivation method surfaced in his mind. Qin Sang silently contemplated it, starting from the late stage of Nascent Soul, mending the deficiencies of his past.


…


"Quick! Catch it!"  A crisp shout echoed from upstream along a magma river.


Then, a bright firelight flashed upstream. Within the light, a small, completely crimson deer sprinted across the magma.


*Pitter-patter!*


The deer's hooves pounded the magma like raindrops, yet the searing heat could not harm it.  Upon closer observation, one could see that the deer's body was not physical but a fire spirit born from the earth's fire veins.


The deer, panicked and desperate, its eyes filled with terror, seemed to be pursued by a powerful enemy.


Before it could flee far, a crimson rainbow shot from the horizon behind it.  The rainbow, swift as lightning, revealed a golden-backed centipede within its light.  Its thousand legs churned as it rode the fire, appearing ferocious.


On the golden-backed centipede's back stood a small, crimson-feathered bird, shaped like a fire crow, pointing a wing forward.  The crimson-feathered bird, unremarkable in appearance, commanded the golden-backed centipede with an air of authority.


The distance between them quickly closed.


The golden-backed centipede opened its mouth to spew a burst of flames.


*Slap!*


The crimson-feathered bird slapped the golden-backed centipede with its wing, scolding, "Idiot! Did you forget what this Zhu Que taught you?"


The flames in the centipede's mouth dispersed, nearly causing it to tumble into the magma. It quickly stabilized itself. If it were to throw the bird off its back, it would surely be beaten even more severely.


Whining, the golden-backed centipede churned its thousand legs.  The tip of each leg flickered with crimson light, emitting fine fire threads that shot towards the deer.  The fire threads filled the sky.


The deer desperately dodged but could not escape the barrage, finally being entangled by a single thread.


*Snap!*


The entangled leg burst into flames, returning to its origin.  The deer thought it had escaped the fire threads, but as the spiritual fire reformed its leg, the thread remained tightly wrapped around it.  With a tug, the deer nearly stumbled.


For a moment, the deer panicked, while the remaining fire threads shot towards it.  These threads did not directly entangle the deer but instead connected and intertwined around it, forming an intricate cage of fire.


Each side, each opening, each angle of the cage had to be uniform.  The firelight on the golden-backed centipede flickered erratically, seemingly strained. A mistake earned it another slap from the bird.


The fire cage dispersed, and the deer regained its freedom.


The golden-backed centipede dared not resist and continued its pursuit. Growing with each beating, it finally met the crimson-feathered bird's demands, trapping the deer within the fire cage.


The deer thrashed within the confines of the cage.


The crimson-feathered bird flew above the cage.  The deer, seemingly sensing something, suddenly ceased its struggles, lying down and trembling.


"This fire spirit is not bad. Take it back and raise it, let those two guys train it…" the crimson-feathered bird muttered to itself, raising a claw and making a grasping motion in the air.


The deer reverted to its original form, transforming into a ball of fire. A crimson pearl flew from the flames and was caught by the crimson-feathered bird.


The golden-backed centipede also flew over, staring longingly at the crimson pearl but daring not act without the bird's permission.


"Not bad! Not bad!  You're still somewhat useful, you oversized earthworm. Here, take this for your contribution!"  The crimson-feathered bird scraped a small fragment from the pearl and swallowed the rest, letting out a satisfied burp.


The golden-backed centipede, only receiving a few crumbs, remained unsatisfied.  It had always been like this, with any found treasures ending up in the crimson-feathered bird's belly.  It dared not express its anger or discontent.


Then, the crimson-feathered bird, in a human-like manner, counted on its claws.  "Hmm, time to go back. If we're late, those two annoying fellows will start their clamor again."


Saying this, the crimson-feathered bird settled on the golden-backed centipede's back and feigned sleep.


The golden-backed centipede, carrying the small deer, flew back dutifully.


After flying for an unknown distance, a large magma lake appeared ahead. Such a massive magma lake was a rare sight even here.


As the golden-backed centipede reached the shore, a calm voice echoed from above, "Out treasure hunting again?"


A flash of azure light materialized in the void, revealing a figure, Qin Sang.


The golden-backed centipede and the crimson-feathered bird were, in fact, the Fire Jade Centipede and Zhu Que.


Seeing its master, the golden-backed centipede was overjoyed, as if finally freed from its torment.


A figure suddenly leaped from the magma river behind it.  It was Gui Hou, hastily kneeling before Qin Sang.


"This subordinate failed in his duty to keep watch. Please, Master, punish me."


Qin Sang said, "You secretly protected their safety. What crime have you committed? Go."


"Yes!" Gui Hou grabbed the small deer and flew back to the cultivation ground.


At this moment, the crimson-feathered bird's feathers trembled, and it leisurely awoke.


"You're out of seclusion."


In front of Qin Sang, Zhu Que remained casual, greeting him nonchalantly before viciously slapping the Fire Jade Centipede.  "This idiot!  This Zhu Que has taught it so much, yet it still can't break through!"


The Fire Jade Centipede flew to Qin Sang's side, hanging its head dejectedly.


"Haven't you been unable to break through to Nascent Soul either? Come to my cave. I have something to ask you…"


With that, Qin Sang vanished.


"Trying to tattle again! I'll deal with you later!"  Zhu Que glared at the Fire Jade Centipede, kicking it into the lake before flying into the Blazing Fire Formation. There, it saw numerous fire spirits arrayed before the mountain, with Luo Hou leading their training.


With time to spare, the two demons had selected promising fire spirits and trained them into demon soldiers. They had once been lords themselves, commanding countless troops, and were experts in this field.  Now, they commanded a considerable force.


Seeing Zhu Que, Luo Hou bowed from afar.  Although they were unaware of Zhu Que's origins, observing its attitude towards their master, they could guess it was no ordinary creature. Every time Zhu Que ventured out, Gui Hou would secretly protect it, fearing any mishap.


Zhu Que held its head high, accepting the salute without a thought of returning it, and flew towards the mountain peak with an air of importance.


Inside the cave, Qin Sang slowly opened his eyes, his gaze piercing through the stone door and sweeping across the vast landscape.


"Two hundred years…"  Qin Sang sighed softly.


Two hundred years, added to the hundred years at the Smoke and Water Pavilion, he had been in the Great Thousand World for over three hundred years.  A mortal kingdom might not last three hundred years.  But in this fiery domain, time seemed to stand still.  This monotonous scenery would not change even in a thousand, ten thousand years.


For these two hundred years, apart from retrieving Translucent Flower Pills from Cloud Cauldron City, Qin Sang had remained almost entirely within his secluded abode, immersed in cultivation, yet aware of everything happening within and beyond his cultivation ground.


During these two hundred years, numerous cultivators had passed by the magma lake, but none could imagine that a Void Refinement expert was cultivating here.


The two demons treated the cultivation ground as a training field.


Zhu Que had also awakened after its long slumber.  It had "grown" in its sleep, awakening at the peak of the Transformation stage, equivalent to the peak of Nascent Soul for human cultivators.


Unexpectedly, Zhu Que's cultivation stagnated afterward, just like the Fire Jade Centipede, stuck before Nascent Soul.


Imbuing Zhu Que with a spirit had consumed two spiritual feathers, a Vermillion Bird True Feather and a Heavenly Phoenix True Feather. If anyone could fully refine either of these feathers, they would surely gain power beyond that of Nascent Soul.


There was only one explanation: all that energy had been used in the process of spirit imbuement.  With Qin Sang's current realm, he could not comprehend the true difficulty of imbuing a spirit, especially one belonging to a Vermillion Bird.


Of course, it was also possible that Zhu Que was up to something, deliberately stalling its progress. The creature was cunning and often thought itself clever.


Qin Sang always felt that Zhu Que's potential was greater than this.


He had asked Zhu Que, but the bird showed no concern.  It did not continue its slumber, nor did it seek Qin Sang's aid for cultivation. Instead, it often ventured out with the Fire Jade Centipede to search for treasures, appearing carefree and unconcerned, and so Qin Sang ceased to bother with it.


As for the Fire Jade Centipede, having entered the Great Thousand World and residing in such an environment, it had also undergone considerable change in these two hundred years. Despite being bullied relentlessly, it also received personal guidance from Zhu Que, a rare opportunity.  Its inability to break through was partly due to Zhu Que deliberately suppressing its cultivation, which ultimately benefited it.


As for Qin Sang's changes, they were even more significant.


Qin Sang examined his inner self.


Two hundred years was not a long time for a Nascent Soul cultivator.


Without that unforeseen incident, he would have needed several decades to reach the peak of Nascent Soul, then harmonize the five elements, comprehend the unity of heaven and man through the Dao of the Five Elements, gradually refining himself, and searching for the opportunity to break through.


This process could take even longer than his entire Nascent Soul cultivation, and two hundred years might not be sufficient.


Having already taken that step, looking back and retrospectively understanding the path was much easier.  If it were just comprehending the cultivation method, organizing his cultivation, and perfecting his Dao path, it would not have taken so long. But being forcibly elevated in realm had damaged his foundation, and repairing it was a painstaking process.


Qin Sang harbored ambitions of immortality and possessed sufficient patience, unwilling to leave any hidden dangers.


For these two hundred years, Qin Sang had patiently refrained from cultivating the twelfth level of the *Nurturing Sword with Primordial Spirit*.  Now, his foundation still needed some time to nurture, but Qin Sang was confident of success and began to consider his future cultivation.


In a flash of thought, Qin Sang sensed Zhu Que approaching and opened the stone door.


"Come in."
