<h1>Chapter 1760: The Sword Cultivator</h1><p>The river flowed on, a mighty current.</p><p>A lone figure traveled along the riverbank, propelled by the wind.</p><p>“Xinggu should be just ahead…”</p><p>Qin Sang consulted his map, surveyed the surrounding terrain, and flew up a mountain to observe before making his judgment.</p><p>Leaving the riverbank and heading north for over a hundred miles, Qin Sang stopped before a dense bamboo forest.</p><p>From above, the forest stretched for a thousand miles in every direction. Purple bamboo, unusually thick, grew densely. Some stalks were as large as ancient trees, a sight rarely seen elsewhere.</p><p>The night wind rustled the bamboo leaves.</p><p>There was no moon tonight.</p><p>In the darkness of the bamboo sea, faint glows could be seen flickering intermittently.  Qin Sang sensed through his Qi that these were the spirits born within the bamboo forest.</p><p>After pausing briefly, Qin Sang darted towards the center of the bamboo sea, stopping and falling rapidly at a certain point.</p><p>‘Swish… swish…’</p><p>Breaking through layers of branches and leaves, Qin Sang felt softness beneath his feet – the accumulated decay of countless years.</p><p>He didn't slow, plunging straight through the decaying matter until he felt a sudden openness – a subterranean valley lay below.</p><p>He could see crisscrossing dead bamboo forming a skeletal framework, supporting the thick layer of decaying leaves that concealed the valley.</p><p>Such places were common within the bamboo sea. The land here was originally hilly, not a plain, but now completely covered by the lush bamboo forest and thick layer of leaf litter.</p><p>Due to its remoteness and the extreme thickness of the leaf layer, one needed to deliberately scan this bamboo sea with spiritual sense to discover this valley; therefore, few knew of its existence.</p><p>Suspended above the valley, Qin Sang saw not darkness, but a faint light flickering within.</p><p>This was very familiar to him – the glimmering points of light were Star Yuan Stones!</p><p>In the Storm World, outside of Zhiting Peak, Star Yuan Stones were extremely rare. Only places like Zhiting Peak, where star energy converged, could gradually generate Star Yuan Stones within the concentrated star energy.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Qin Sang immediately took out his Star Spirit Net, a gift from his senior sister , used for collecting Star Yuan Stones.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled that the Yuan Shen Sect had several formations and restrictions that could be activated using Star Yuan Stones.</p><p>He didn't rush to collect them. Instead, he flew from one end of the valley to the other, pondering for a moment before descending deeper into its depths.</p><p>After a short time, Qin Sang stopped, his expression showing some disappointment.</p><p>The concentration and quantity of star energy in this valley were far inferior to Zhiting Peak.</p><p>He could make a rough judgment even without having reached the summit of Zhiting Peak. Even returning to Zhiting Peak might only barely aid his breakthrough; this was definitely insufficient.</p><p>Having come this far, Qin Sang used the Star Spirit Net to collect Star Yuan Stones, gradually reaching the valley's deepest part. Suddenly, he let out a soft exclamation, unexpectedly discovering a hole in the valley floor, seemingly leading to the depths below.</p><p>Star energy flowed from within the hole.</p><p>Qin Sang examined it for a few moments, put away the Star Spirit Net, and darted into the hole.</p><p>The entrance was narrow, but the passage opened up gradually. The terrain was extremely uneven, rising and falling, twisting and turning, but it was clear the cave extended deep underground.</p><p>After traveling for some time, Qin Sang noticed that the star energy wasn't getting stronger as he'd expected.  After reaching a certain point, it gradually thinned out.</p><p>Not yet reaching the end of the cave, Qin Sang was reluctant to leave and continued descending, simultaneously trying various methods to find the cause of the valley's formation.</p><p>‘Whoosh… whoosh…’</p><p>The sound of flowing water echoed faintly ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted. “An underground river?”</p><p>He quickened his pace, traveling for another ten miles or so.  The underground passage suddenly widened, revealing a subterranean river several miles wide. The rock walls glittered with tiny lights, the result of some special mineral.</p><p>By now, the star energy was extremely thin. Disappointed, Qin Sang was about to investigate and leave when he felt a sudden chill, a sharp warning!</p><p>“Danger!”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened.</p><p>Simultaneously, his Sky Eye Butterfly gave a warning.</p><p>From the river!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed with sharp light.  As soon as he sensed the danger, he quickly formed a hand seal, and a faint golden light, like golden armor, appeared on his body.</p><p>The Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal!</p><p>Almost the instant the seal was completed, the dark river's surface exploded. Amid the spray, a dazzling sword light, like a lightning bolt, shot towards Qin Sang, aiming straight for his face!</p><p>“A Sword Cultivator!”</p><p>Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly.</p><p>Since arriving in this world, this was the first time he had encountered a Daoist sword cultivator.</p><p>The Daoist sect's three main schools – the Dragon Tiger, Golden Seal, and Military – had distinct characteristics. Even those who used swords rarely were purely sword cultivators; their spirit swords were often spell swords, used as aids in spellcasting.</p><p>This opponent was different.  His swordsmanship was incredibly refined, showing profound mastery. Qin Sang, himself a swordsman, knew his senses weren't deceiving him.</p><p>A swordsman who had integrated talismanic techniques—what other methods might he possess?  Qin Sang didn't have time to ponder. This attack was a threat, demanding immediate action.</p><p>His expression hardening, Qin Sang coldly snorted and instantly formed four hand seals: the Auspicious Seal, the Lotus Seal, the Altar-Turning Seal, and the Demon-Crushing Seal.  Of the six seals he had mastered, only the Great Wisdom Vajra Seal remained unlearned.</p><p>This seal, the fifth of the Seven Master Buddha Seals, was unlike the others. While the others visibly altered the user, this seal's effect was internal, fostering mental clarity and stillness amidst battle, impervious to external distractions.</p><p>For most, this seal was as important as the Vajra Heavenly Armor Seal, but for Qin Sang, it was less useful.</p><p>Five seals unleashed. The sword light was now less than three feet from his brow.</p><p>At the critical moment, Qin Sang's body shuddered; his qi and blood surged like a dragon's roar and tiger's growl.  A brilliant golden light erupted before him, materializing a strange golden Buddha seal that perfectly intercepted the sword light, pressing down upon it.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The earth trembled violently; huge waves surged.  The golden light shattered, its fragments scattering through the air.  Within the golden light, the Buddha seal stubbornly resisted the sword light, preventing its advance, while the two powerful forces continued to clash.</p><p>Now visible within the sword light was a three-foot-long green blade, its body slender and radiant, obviously exceptional.</p><p>"A pseudo-spiritual treasure!"</p><p>Qin Sang's face changed.  Given the opponent's swordsmanship and the quality of his sword, this person's strength must be far greater than shown.</p><p>Qin Sang reckoned that he would need to fully master the seventh seal, the Great Freedom Vajra Seal, before he could overcome his opponent without resorting to other means.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Qin Sang tapped his foot, retreating instead of advancing.  As expected, the sword light paused slightly, then with a resounding boom, pierced the Buddha seal. Had Qin Sang advanced instead of retreating, his situation would have been dire.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang retreated rapidly, smashing through sections of the stone walls, his eyes fixed on the approaching sword light as he shouted, "Who are you? I have no quarrel with you, why attack me?"</p><p>There was no reply from the dark river. The sword light relentlessly pursued him, its speed increased by a third.</p><p>His opponent was a swordsman, and the complex underground terrain, with its star-infused stone that hardened with increasing depth, made escape difficult for Qin Sang.</p><p>His eyes flashed with fierce intent. Instead of confronting his opponent with the Gray Warbler Sword, he decided to try the power of the Post Heaven Wooden Man Stele.</p><p>With a thought, a green light filled with vibrant life energy, vaguely resembling a tree, burst from Qin Sang.  The Dao-Evolving Tree was extraordinary; Qin Sang, unlike the Strange-Faced Man, carefully concealed its nature as a spirit medium tree. After refining the Dao-Evolving Tree, it took root within Qin Sang, rejuvenated.</p><p>Qin Sang silently formed a hand seal, and the green light retracted, the tree-like image disappearing underground.  Simultaneously, Qin Sang landed heavily, creating a resounding thud that echoed through the subterranean space.</p><p>Upon landing, Qin Sang underwent a dramatic transformation. His body and limbs elongated, his skin grew dry and bark-like; his arms and fingers resembled branches, like a tree spirit taking form.  Most strikingly, his aura now seemed intertwined with the earth itself.</p><p>Qin Sang felt the vibrant life energy around him, an unprecedented sense of ease washing over him.  This subterranean location, surrounded by the boundless Purple Bamboo Sea, proved the ideal battleground for this technique.</p><p>Qin Sang's perception extended with the technique; the surrounding purple bamboo responded, the bamboo forest rustling, leaves swaying towards Star Valley from all directions. The spirits within the bamboo sea sensed the change, especially the plant-transformed creatures, instinctively feeling fear, driving them to flee as far as possible.</p><p>A continuous flow of wood spirit energy surged forth; at this moment, Qin Sang felt he possessed inexhaustible power!</p><p>The underground space now felt cramped as a tree-man.  Standing erect, he nearly touched the ceiling.  His eyes shone brightly, glaring at the sword light.  His right arm formed a hand seal, and he struck out violently!</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>His fist struck the sword light squarely.  Wood chips seemed to fly through the air; golden light flickered across his rough skin.</p><p>Using the Seven Master Buddha Seals in his wood form greatly enhanced their power.  With a clang, Qin Sang's blow shattered the sword light, directly confronting the sword's edge. The Altar-Turning Seal was innately capable of suppressing magical treasures.</p><p>A direct hit dimmed the glow of the spirit sword, instantly halting its advance.</p><p>The postnatal Wooden Man Stele, cultivated using the Dao of Performance Tree, truly possesses extraordinary power!</p><p>Furthermore, ancient texts mention that absorbing wood spirit energy places a heavy burden on oneself, requiring vigilance.  Qin Sang, however, did not experience such severe effects, undoubtedly thanks to the Dao of Performance Tree.</p><p>This strike greatly boosted Qin Sang's confidence. He had only integrated the Dao of Performance Tree into his body for three years, and many of his abilities were still undeveloped. Yet, he was already able to withstand a sword cultivator's attack, even utilizing the surrounding vegetation for movement!</p><p>Qin Sang let out a hearty laugh, thrusting his arm forward, his hand transforming into a claw, attempting to seize the spirit sword directly.</p><p>However, a sword cultivator's blade is not so easily taken.</p><p>The spirit sword vibrated, emitting a resonant hum. In a flash, it vanished into thin air.</p><p>The next moment, a sword beam appeared from the side, slashing down with incredible speed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't flinch, using a powerful punch to shatter the beam.</p><p>But then, more sword beams appeared from various directions, one after another, seemingly endless, forcing Qin Sang to remain on high alert.</p><p>Other opponents might have been exhausted by this tactic.</p><p>But Qin Sang, rooted to the earth, with the surrounding plants as his source of power, feared no such depletion.</p><p>One by one, the sword beams shattered before him.</p><p>Yet Qin Sang's attention remained fixed on the river's center.</p><p>Even now, his opponent remained unseen.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly, piercing the riverbed with its vision, did not see the opponent but detected an anomaly in the riverbed's soil and rocks.</p><p>Locating his opponent's position, Qin Sang shattered a sword beam, then sprinted at full speed, reaching the riverbank in an instant.</p><p>At that moment, the spirit sword reappeared above the river's surface, its blade pointed at Qin Sang, unleashing a white streak of light!</p><p>At this moment, the space above the river seemed locked by the sword beam, leaving no room for escape.</p><p>Qin Sang activated the Destroyer Seal, pushing it forward.  The golden seal collided with the sword beam. A thunderous roar echoed, and Qin Sang, his body trembling slightly, stopped his charge, standing firm on the riverbank.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The river parted, and a man in green robes flew out.</p><p>This man, tall and slender, appeared to be in his thirties, with sharp eyebrows, bright eyes, and a piercing gaze. He retrieved his spirit sword, looking at Qin Sang with a surprised expression.</p><p>"Huh? A monster? No! What kind of talisman is that?"</p><p>Seeing the man, Qin Sang's pupils constricted slightly. He didn't attack further, instead asking in a low voice, "Who are you?"</p><p>"You don't recognize me?" The man paused, studying him.  "You're not from Lingdu Mountain?"</p><p>"Lingdu Mountain?" Qin Sang couldn't recall such a faction and shook his head slightly.</p><p>The man's face showed embarrassment. He waved his hand.  "A misunderstanding! A misunderstanding! I thought a great enemy was pursuing me. I didn't expect another person to be here."</p><p>"A misunderstanding?"</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. He had been ambushed. If not for his abilities, he might have been killed. Could a simple misunderstanding explain that?</p><p>The man sheathed his sword and bowed deeply, his movements precise and formal. "I apologize for the offense. Please forgive me, Daoist friend."</p><p>Qin Sang didn't retract his wooden body, but neither did he attack, simply gazing at the other man with a bland expression.</p><p>The apology might be a pretense, given the man's difficulty in dealing with him, or it might be genuine.</p><p>But it didn't matter. Qin Sang sensed a dangerous aura from the man.</p><p>His strength was likely far greater than he showed!</p><p>Though Qin Sang's spiritual sense was limited, his spiritual perception surpassed that of ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators, yet he couldn't fully discern the man.</p><p>Could the other man also be a Transformation Realm cultivator?</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang felt a pang of anxiety. His power was not fully restored; he would be at a disadvantage against a cultivator of equal rank, with slim chances of victory.</p><p>Secretly observing the man, Qin Sang remained uncertain but felt a palpable threat, increasing his vigilance.</p><p>He also realized that the man possessed the power to do more but had not used it, possibly due to some unspoken difficulty, similar to his own situation.</p><p>It seemed his opponent was also powerful, perhaps wounded in a battle or facing some restriction.</p><p>"I'm in the midst of refining a treasure, my attention heavily focused on it, afraid that my enemy will interrupt, so I had to act first. I hope you understand," the man said vaguely, seeing that Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>So that was it.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded silently. The man's inability to use his full power was likely related to the treasure.</p><p>"Since it was a misunderstanding, I wish to apologize. If you won't trouble me further, I will do one thing for you in the future, or if you require any treasure, within my ability," the man bowed again.</p><p>"Aren't you afraid I'll inform your enemy after I leave?" Qin Sang's tone was indifferent.</p><p>The man sighed helplessly. "To be honest, I wanted to keep you for a while, but it's not suitable to make enemies now. And I feel rather uneasy facing you. You must have ways to threaten me."</p><p></p>
