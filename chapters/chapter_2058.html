<h1>Chapter 2049:  Meritorious Deeds</h1><p>“I think there’s something hidden within that aura you mentioned, something only it can see,”</p><p>Zhuque raised its wing, pointing at the qilin egg.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered. Zhuque was likely right.  Logically, the world is ever-changing. Even if there was a special marker in that scene, after countless years, the landscape would have been altered beyond recognition, making it almost impossible to find.</p><p>The qilin wouldn't have done something pointless; there must be a deeper meaning.</p><p>With the qilin’s abilities, whatever secret it hid was beyond Qin Sang and Zhuque's current ability to discern.  Opening it might require a key, perhaps the qilin's own bloodline, or some specific trigger.</p><p>This gave Qin Sang another idea.</p><p>A qilin’s essence wouldn't be carelessly left anywhere.  Too many things could go wrong: discovery by enemies, others getting there first, or the essence dissipating. To prevent these, it would certainly be sealed.</p><p>Qin Sang touched the aura again, seeing the same scene, unchanged.  But after hundreds of careful examinations, scrutinizing every detail, he made a discovery.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered. He noticed that at the moment the falling fire plunged into the mountains and exploded, a subtle fluctuation seemed to flash within the flames before vanishing.</p><p>This might have been due to the aura changing over time, or it could be the fluctuation of the qilin essence's seal.</p><p>“How did the qilin plan to have its reborn self receive the essence? If its true form arrived, their auras would connect and merge instantly. It only needs to leave a directional mark within its true spirit or this aura. Why leave this specific scene?  Could the secret to unlocking the seal be hidden within the image?”</p><p>Qin Sang considered various hypotheses, but they could only be verified after the qilin hatched.</p><p>There was a further difficulty. If his guess was correct, should he return the aura to the qilin? And when?</p><p>If the aura contained some kind of trap, the hundreds of years of planning by him and Zhuque would be wasted.</p><p>“Why overthink it? Let's hatch it first! This Zhuque doesn't believe it can turn the tables.  Worst comes to worst, we'll kill it again! What's so great about a qilin? In my prime, I probably devoured several!”</p><p>Zhuque looked ferocious.  Anyone who dared to stop it from obtaining the qilin essence would be annihilated!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't think of a better solution, so he sealed the aura to prevent the qilin’s true spirit from touching it. After the qilin hatched, he'd observe its actions before deciding what to do.</p><p>Seizing the qilin essence couldn’t be rushed.</p><p>The next problem was how to hatch the qilin quickly. Qin Sang sensed the life force within the egg. For an ordinary creature, this life force was exceptionally strong. But according to Zhuque, qilin are born divine beasts, favored by Heaven and Earth; this was a sign of inherent deficiency.</p><p>Forced cultivation might create problems, and Qin Sang didn’t want a crippled divine beast mount.</p><p>Ideally, it should be placed in a place rich in spiritual energy to absorb it naturally and hatch organically.  But Qin Sang was currently unsettled and didn't dare let the qilin egg stray far.</p><p>“So, we need to go to the Storm Realm soon. Find a place with a spiritual spring, create a cave dwelling, and raise the qilin egg there…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, silently activating the lotus platform. The light in the cave dimmed, the platform disappearing into his body. He then put away Zhuque and left the cave.</p><p>“Greetings, Master!”</p><p>His two brothers, sensing the fluctuations in the restrictions, bowed respectfully.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, enveloped them in his light, and sped off like a rainbow.</p><p>Returning the same way, they arrived back at Xuwei City. Qin Sang sent his brothers to their cave dwelling, inquired about events from the sword servant, and then went directly to the Five Elements League to visit Elder You.</p><p>Having been manipulated by Elder You once, Qin Sang showed no change in expression upon seeing him again, smiling and bowing.</p><p>“Elder Qin, did your trip go smoothly?” Elder You also appeared calm, smiling pleasantly.</p><p>“Thanks to Daoist Friend's good fortune, I didn't encounter any danger.  Unfortunately, Grandmaster Luo Hua's plan was too difficult. Though we tried our best, we ultimately failed,” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>“Oh? Elder Qin has been gone so long and still couldn’t succeed? That’s a shame!”</p><p>Elder You showed a look of regret. “But Elder Qin, rest assured, we agreed beforehand that regardless of success or failure, those two treasures are yours.”</p><p>“Thank you, Elder You.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed again, then got straight to the point. “I wonder if you have any news on the other spiritual materials?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Elder You, clearly prepared, immediately took out a jade slip.  “After Elder Qin left, I haven’t been idle. I’ve done my best to find information for you, and I’m pleased to report that I’ve located three more. As for other common spiritual materials, the Alliance has also gathered most of them for you, and they will be sent to Xuwu City soon.”</p><p>Qin Sang quickly used his spiritual sense to examine it.  It was as Elder You had said.  Just as he was about to speak, Elder You continued, “For those treasures that can be exchanged for other spiritual materials, the Alliance will handle the exchange and determine a price. Elder Qin just needs to provide equivalent treasures in exchange. However, if the owner of a treasure has other requests, you will have to make the trip yourself.”</p><p>Things went more smoothly than Qin Sang expected. Elder You had indeed put in the effort.  It was unclear whether the Alliance was trying to win him over, or if Elder You was trying to smooth things over between them.</p><p>It seemed the Luo Hua Guan commission was a kind of test, but the Five Elements Alliance hadn’t anticipated Luo Hua Zhenren’s own calculations. This trip was actually quite safe.</p><p>With such benefits before him, Qin Sang wouldn’t dwell on the past. He thanked Elder You repeatedly.</p><p>“Thank you for your efforts, Elder You! If the treasure owners have requests, I will personally visit them. I wouldn’t dare trouble the Alliance further.”</p><p>Elder You replied, “Good. Then I’ll have the Alliance contact those cultivators. Elder Qin, please await good news!”</p><p>Over the next three years, Qin Sang traveled frequently between his cave abode and the Five Elements Alliance.  He occasionally left Xuwu City, traveling far and wide to acquire treasures.</p><p>The items Qin Sang needed were all extremely rare and precious celestial materials.  To gather them quickly, he would do whatever the owners asked, no matter the request.</p><p>He was prepared to go the extra mile, and it proved to be manageable.  He had helped people refine artifacts, assist in exploration, and even helped someone deal with their enemies…</p><p>During this time, Su Nu, accompanied by Gu Ya, had been investigating in Wumian City and Lansha Prefecture, as well as planning for their journey to the Mist Sea.</p><p>They exchanged letters occasionally, but out of caution, their correspondence avoided sensitive information, so Qin Sang didn't know the extent of their progress.</p><p>One day, Qin Sang made a special trip to the Five Elements Alliance to bid farewell to Elder You.  Then, he summoned Jian Nu and the brothers QIng Jia and Qing Yi, setting off eastward.</p><p>After several stops, they arrived at a celestial city. However, instead of continuing east to Wumian City, Qin Sang left the city, soared into the clouds, and flew north.</p><p>During the flight, Qin Sang checked his small heavenly realm.  Seeing the neatly arranged jade boxes, a satisfied yet thoughtful smile spread across his face.</p><p>Azure Mark Essence, Thousand Feather Silk, Golden Mountain Jade, Golden-Veined Grass Seeds, Ethereal Wind, Dragon Gall Iron…</p><p>After five years in Kanzhou, combined with previous acquisitions, he had finally gathered the most important materials!</p><p>The construction of the Thunder Altar could indeed drain a sect's resources, it wasn't an exaggeration!</p><p>Qin Sang's personal wealth was already considerable, adding to the gains from the Falling Soul Abyss, the Chen family’s secret treasury, Bi Shui Village, and Pei Gongfu's cave abode.  While he hadn't been completely impoverished for these treasures, it was a significant undertaking.</p><p>Thankfully, with the help of the Five Elements Alliance, he had managed to gather them relatively easily; otherwise, there would have been many more difficulties.</p><p>His purpose for this trip was to obtain a spiritual material called Nine Reed Earth. This wasn't as rare as Azure Mark Essence, but Qin Sang made the journey specifically for the owner.</p><p>This person was known as Master Songfeng, a Nascent Soul cultivator.  He might not be famous in Kanzhou, but his sect was extremely renowned: the Thousand-Tiered Divine Palace!</p><p>During this time, Qin Sang had learned about the customs of Kanzhou and discovered its differences from other regions.</p><p>In Kanzhou, except for Xuwu City, almost all celestial cities were built on islands with slightly weaker spiritual energy. The richest islands, with the most abundant spiritual energy, were all occupied by major immortal sects.</p><p>These sects were the true rulers of Kanzhou. Kanzhou cultivators might not recognize the Great Zhou Dynasty, but they all held these sects in awe and obeyed their commands.</p><p>The celestial cities had little influence. Those who stayed in celestial cities were either independent cultivators or small sects that lacked the strength to protect themselves.  At least, the celestial cities offered a safe place to live, which explained why Luo Hua Guan readily agreed to refine the jade ruler in Yanling City.</p><p>In Kanzhou, celestial cities functioned more like waystations attached to powerful sects.  Of course, Qin Sang only saw the surface; he hadn't yet touched upon the deeper aspects.</p><p>Qin Sang was headed to Qiandie Divine Palace, one of the most powerful sects in Kanzhou.  Legend had it that even the eastern Kanzhou sects deferred to Qiandie Divine Palace, and its influence extended as far as Lansha Prefecture.</p><p>It was certain that the Palace had Nascent Soul cultivators, but the exact number, and whether they had any Ascension stage cultivators, remained a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang had long noticed a pattern: not only in Kanzhou, but also in several other prefectures he had visited, rumors of Ascension cultivators were incredibly scarce, even unsubstantiated whispers were rare.</p><p>The situation was similar with the Transformation stage cultivators in the Storm World's Central Prefecture, but at least there, the number of cultivators, their titles, and sects were known.</p><p>Whether the number of human Ascension cultivators was truly small, or if their abilities were so great they remained hidden from the world, even severing karmic ties, remained unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned towards the latter explanation.  After all, even Void Refinement cultivators could perform feats previously thought only possible by immortals—excluding immortality itself— making the abilities of Ascension cultivators truly beyond imagination.</p><p>Given the opportunity to interact with Qiandie Divine Palace, Qin Sang wouldn't pass it up.  Building rapport there could prove beneficial in his dealings within Lansha Prefecture.</p><p>Rumor had it that the sect's name, "Qiandie," referred to a characteristic of their cultivation techniques and abilities, namely their overwhelming wave-like attacks.  In battle, Qiandie Divine Palace cultivators attacked relentlessly, like an endless tide.  Initially, their attacks might seem manageable, but their power increased with each successive wave, culminating in a devastating simultaneous eruption that was impossible to withstand. The timing was unpredictable, requiring constant vigilance from opponents, making them exceptionally difficult to fight.</p><p>Lost in thought about Qiandie Divine Palace, Qin Sang felt a subtle vibration in his sleeve. With a gentle shake, a jade bead flew out.</p><p>This bead was a token from Master Songfeng.</p><p>Seeing the bead's light pulsating like a breath, Qin Sang released the seal, and the bead instantly transformed into a streak of light, shooting off into the distance.  He quickly rose to follow.</p><p>Following the bead's flight, Qin Sang noticed the spiritual energy growing denser, and the number of islands and cultivators steadily increasing.  Soon, he saw a spiritual island in the distance, with towering peaks covered in pines. The jade bead vanished into the pine forest.</p><p>"Master Songfeng's secluded residence must be here," he thought.</p><p>However, Qin Sang was somewhat disappointed. He had hoped to be invited to Qiandie Divine Palace to witness the grandeur of the sect.</p><p>He looked towards the distant horizon, where boundless clouds and continuous landmasses seemed to turn a vast expanse of ocean into an inland lake – surely the location of Qiandie Divine Palace's main gate.</p><p>"Haha..."</p><p>A hearty laugh echoed from the pine forest.  "It must be Elder Qin!"</p><p>A figure emerged from beneath a pine tree.  This person had an unusual appearance, a tall and slender frame, dressed in flowing robes, exuding a carefree aura.</p><p>"Master Songfeng, I presume?  My greetings, sir," Qin Sang landed, bowing slightly.</p><p>"Indeed, Elder Qin, please come quickly!  Let's not be seen by our fellow disciples," Master Songfeng looked around nervously.</p><p>Qin Sang raised an eyebrow. "What is it you're refining, Master, that requires such secrecy from your fellow disciples?"</p><p>"I'm refining a spirit array.  The array is complete, but it lacks a crucial stabilizing treasure.  One person can't complete it, so I needed outside help. But I boasted about it beforehand, and my senior and junior brothers will surely mock me if they find out.  Therefore, utmost secrecy is vital! Elder Qin, you must keep this a secret!"</p><p>Master Songfeng's face was serious as he led Qin Sang into his secluded residence.  His expression then softened into a smile. "Boy, bring some immortal tea!"</p><p>A moment passed without a response.  Master Songfeng slapped his forehead. "Ah!  I almost forgot! The boy and the younger disciples went out to sea hunting demons! Sadly, brewing our sect's spirit tea is quite complex. Otherwise, it would greatly diminish its flavour, and I'm too lazy to learn, so I'm afraid Elder Qin will have to settle for some plain water."</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a jade cup appeared, filled with clear spring water.</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang took the cup.  "Does your sect condone its disciples hunting demons?"</p><p>"Why wouldn't we hunt those of different races?"</p><p>Master Songfeng countered, "Not only do we condone it, but we even reward those who bring in a large number.  However, don't quote me on that outside these doors."</p><p>"Why is that?" Qin Sang inquired curiously.</p><p>Master Songfeng chuckled.  "The Eastern Sea's aquatic denizens are relatively docile.  We can't openly declare war on them, can we? If they were like the demons in Qianzhou, we wouldn't have such reservations."</p><p>"Qianzhou?" Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>In the Eight Trigrams, Qian and Kun represent Heaven and Earth respectively.  Qianzhou and Kunzhou are located to the north and south of Dazhou respectively, placing Qianzhou closest to the northern wilderness.</p><p>Master Songfeng continued, his mood light, "Elder Qin, have you never been to Qianzhou?  I haven't either, but I've heard that demons run rampant there. Qianzhou cultivators can gain merit by hunting demons. With enough merit, they can set up an altar anywhere in Qianzhou and offer sacrifices to obtain any desired treasure, which will instantly appear on the altar. It's quite miraculous…"</p><p>Thank you to the hardworking administration for the double chapter push.
