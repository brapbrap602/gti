<h1>Chapter 2101: Setting Things Right</h1><p>Chapter 2102: Setting Things Right</p><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The temple was nestled amidst verdant mountains and flowing rivers, a tranquil paradise, showing no signs of the recent devastation.  On this day, the temple gates swung open, auspicious clouds gathered, and guests arrived in throngs.</p><p>From the west, the sound of chanting drifted. A group of monks, seemingly walking on air, approached. Some were ascetics, clad in patched robes, gaunt and pale; others, though weathered, were clearly no ordinary monks.</p><p>They journeyed on foot, without flying chariots, yet their speed was astonishing – each step carrying them across multiple mountain peaks, reaching the temple gates in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Soon, the sound of bells and chimes echoed from within Qingyang Temple. Li Yu Fu, the temple master, personally descended the mountain to greet them.</p><p>Li Yu Fu bowed, his whisk in hand, "This humble cultivator greets Saint Huaiyin and the esteemed monks."</p><p>This group of monks had indeed arrived from the West, led by Saint Huaiyin.</p><p>"Greetings, Master Li."</p><p>Saint Huaiyin and the other monks returned the greeting, their gazes sweeping across Qingyang Temple, their expressions varied.</p><p>More than a month had passed since the Northern Sea conflict. The Changyou clan had suffered a crushing defeat, fleeing in disarray, leaving countless corpses behind, including several high-ranking experts and elders.  The Northern Sea forces had won a decisive victory.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Changyou armies stationed in the Western Wasteland and patrolling the South China Sea retreated in panic.  No Changyou soldiers remained near the Central Plains.</p><p>After repeated investigations, the Western Wasteland confirmed that the great enemy that had threatened the Central Plains for centuries had finally withdrawn!</p><p>As various factions expressed their astonishment, a rumor spread:  Grandmaster Qin, the ancestor of Qingyang Temple, had returned, not only alive but with significantly enhanced cultivation, having reached the Refinement Void stage.</p><p>Another, more terrifying piece of news accompanied this rumor: the Changyou clan leader had broken through to the second level of the Void Realm and had slaughtered countless demonic cultivators in the Canglang Sea. Only Grandmaster Qin's timely intervention had forced the Changyou leader to retreat, preventing the potential annihilation of the demonic army.</p><p>The sudden appearance of the demonic cultivators from the Demon Sea in the Canglang Sea also sparked much speculation, but it paled in comparison to the previous two sensational rumors.</p><p>The situation was turbulent, rumors rampant. No one could verify the truth. Qingyang Temple subsequently announced its closure, and forces like the Xuan Tian Palace of the Northern Sea remained silent.</p><p>Then, recently, influential factions across the Storm World received invitations from Qingyang Temple, announcing the temple's reopening and a grand ceremony to honor Heaven and Earth, and their ancestors, inviting various factions to witness the event.</p><p>The key was the invitation itself.  Besides Master Li Yu Fu's seal, it bore a faint but potent aura.</p><p>Sensing this aura, the powerful overlords of the land were filled with awe and apprehension.</p><p>The Western Buddhist sect also received the invitation. With the external threat diminished, the pressure on the West had lessened considerably. As a sign of respect, Saint Huaiyin and high-ranking monks from various temples came to the ceremony.</p><p>For reasons unknown, they did not utilize teleportation formations to reach the Central Plains, choosing instead to travel across the land, arriving later than the Northern Sea forces.</p><p>Now, Qingyang Temple was filled with distinguished guests, the Western monks being among the last to arrive.</p><p>"We apologize for our lateness, hoping it hasn't disrupted the proceedings," Saint Huaiyin said apologetically.</p><p>"Saint Huaiyin, you flatter us. The celebration hasn't begun yet. Please, come in!"</p><p>Li Yu Fu gestured, leading the monks into Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Misty clouds and vibrant霞光 enveloped them, a scene resembling a celestial realm. While the monks marveled at the sight, their attention was drawn most to the temple's protective array.</p><p>They secretly investigated it, finding it impenetrable, its complexity exceeding their imagination, leaving them awestruck.</p><p>As the monks entered the temple and ascended to the clouds, they found themselves above the cloud sea, numerous mountain peaks emerging from the clouds like islands, the highest and central peak being Qingyang Temple's main peak.</p><p>Jade altars and celestial fruits were arranged on these "islands," most already claimed by the arriving factions.</p><p>Saint Huaiyin surveyed the scene, noticing the numerous guests on most islands.  Almost every notable figure from the Storm World was present.</p><p>Masters from the three races, various sect leaders and grand elders, renowned cultivators, and representatives from large and small sects – countless individuals.</p><p>Saint Huaiyin understood their motivations, sharing similar concerns.  Their purpose was twofold:</p><p>First, to ascertain the truth about Qingyang Temple, confirming whether Grandmaster Qin had indeed returned and reached the Refinement Void stage.</p><p>Second, if the rumors were true, the situation was poised for dramatic change. Understanding Qingyang Temple's intentions would be crucial for their own strategic decisions.</p><p>Part 3: Though the foreign enemies have retreated, the threat remains.  It is unknown how Qin Zhenjun plans to deal with the Changyou tribe and the internal affairs of Storm Realm. This not only concerns the rise and fall of the Storm Realm, but also the survival of every cultivator and faction.</p><p>Master Huaiyin surveyed the assembled guests.  He understood their arrangement: surrounding the main peak of Qingyang Temple, various factions were positioned roughly according to their locations in the mortal world.</p><p>Northern forces, led by Xuantian Palace, were stationed in the north.  Eastern forces, primarily comprised of the Central Plains human factions led by the Three Teach Alliance, including sects like the Northern Wasteland Demon Sect, Wan Du Mountain, Qiongying Gate, Bunian Mountain, and the Seven Islands of Water Mirror, were all present.</p><p>The Eastern Sea demon race, led by Dragon Whale Sage, maintained a distance from the Central Plains human forces, occupying the southeast. Adjacent to them, in the south, were the demons of the Demon Sea.</p><p>Master Huaiyin couldn't help but glance again.  He noticed that Yuanzhu was seated in the prominent position among the Demon Sea demons, with the Phoenix King and other demon kings flanking him.  However, the Jiao Dragon King, the Golden Toad King, and several other demon kings were absent.</p><p>This unusual seating arrangement drew many curious glances, but Yuanzhu sat stiffly, and the Phoenix King and other demons maintained tense expressions, revealing nothing.</p><p>The Witch tribe and the Canglang Sea human forces, led by the Four Saints Palace, were settled in the southwest peaks, encroaching slightly upon Western Lands territory.  However, due to years of war in the Western Lands, smaller temples and monasteries had mostly merged into larger ones, resulting in fewer attendees, leaving ample space for them.</p><p>The observing guests were positioned on the outer perimeter. Qingyang Temple disciples, led by Shen Chen, Yu Nu, Huan Hen, and others, formed an array around the main peak, their spirits high.</p><p>Master Huaiyin looked out across the peaks.  A golden glow filled the sky, the atmosphere solemn and reverent, yet Qin Zhenjun was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Li Yu Fu led the way, the monks walking on clouds.  Astonishingly, with each step, a lotus blossom bloomed beneath their feet, vibrant and dewy.</p><p>The lotuses were real. Upon closer inspection, fine white threads, the tendrils of a certain spirit plant, were visible amongst the clouds. These were called One-Breath Lotuses, a rare plant given to Qingyang Temple by Ji Hong.  As the name suggests, each lotus blooms for only a single breath before withering, yet in that fleeting moment, it offers the world the most exquisite beauty, and over time, enhances the spiritual veins.</p><p>As the monks walked, lotuses bloomed with every step. Even those who had witnessed this spectacle before couldn't help but marvel, paying their respects to the monks.</p><p>Ji Hong provided more than just One-Breath Lotuses.  This grand ceremony lacked acolytes and maidservants.  The peaks were adorned with flowers.  As soon as a cup on the altar emptied, a flower bud, shaped like a bull's horn, would bloom, spilling forth a celestial liquor.</p><p>This spirit flower was called the Burning Wine Flower, serving a single purpose: improving the quality of alcohol. Its roots submerged in wine, even the most ordinary liquor would be transformed into a superior drink.</p><p>Ji Hong offered several other similar spirit plants as gifts, adding significantly to the grandeur of Qingyang Temple.</p><p>“Please be seated, holy monks.”</p><p>Li Yu Fu, having settled the Western Lands monks, surveyed the peaks, noting that most had arrived.  He then rose on clouds towards the main peak.</p><p>Everyone noticed his action, and the murmurs immediately subsided.</p><p>Shortly after, a bell tolled, silencing any remaining noise. Qingyang Temple fell silent, save for the gentle ringing of the bell.</p><p>The sacred bell rang nine times, and the doors of the main hall swung open.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, holding a whisk and dressed in a celestial brown robe, emerged from the hall before the expectant crowd, standing before the hall and announcing.  He declared that this would henceforth be the main hall of Qingyang Temple, and that a ceremony would be held to worship Heaven and Earth, and to honor their ancestors.</p><p>Finally, Li Yu Fu flicked his whisk. The main peak trembled slightly, erupting in a brilliant golden light.  A sacrificial altar rose on the summit.</p><p>However, instead of performing the sacrifice himself, he looked up at the sky, his face full of reverence. Seeing this, the onlookers understood, and held their breath.</p><p>After a moment, a long cry echoed, and a fiery meteor streaked from the heavens!</p><p>The sound was clear and resonant, accompanied by an immense power that shocked everyone. Gazing upwards, they saw that the meteor was a magnificent firebird.</p><p>Resembling a phoenix reborn from flames, yet purer, more like the very embodiment of celestial fire.</p><p>Such a divine bird was merely a mount.  A person of ethereal grace sat upon its back.</p><p>“Greetings, Master Uncle!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu knelt and cried out.</p><p>“Greetings, Grandmaster!”</p><p>The Qingyang Temple disciples followed suit, their faces filled with fervent adoration.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived on the mythical bird, but a discordant cry pierced the air.  "I am a Vermillion Bird, a divine beast of inherent nobility! I am no mount!"</p><p>"I merely borrowed your majesty to enhance the ceremony's impact.  Other spirit beasts lack the Vermillion Bird's bloodline, and thus, the effect wouldn't be as potent," Qin Sang chuckled.</p><p>This flattery seemed to please the Vermillion Bird, who muttered, "Hurry and hatch that clumsy Qilin! And don't forget your promise to help me through my tribulation!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. The Vermillion Bird was in seclusion, refining the Qilin's essence. It was proving effective, and soon, he would have a powerful ally.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Vermillion Bird descended from the heavens, assisting Qin Sang in creating a grand spectacle. It landed before the altar, its upper body prostrate, allowing Qin Sang to dismount.</p><p>Qin Sang stood on the altar, gazing at the memorial tablets, a mix of emotions washing over him.  These were the tablets of the Qingyang Temple's ancestors, not for the dead alone; his own name was among them.</p><p>On the topmost level were Yunyouzi and Jixin Daoren, alongside a separate tablet for Elder Qingzhu. Qin Sang only needed to pay respects to these three.</p><p>Qin Sang held incense sticks, his expression solemn. He performed each ritual meticulously, first to Heaven and Earth, then to each ancestor individually.</p><p>The ceremony concluded, Qin Sang turned, his gaze sweeping across Li Yu Fu, the Qingyang Temple disciples, and the assembled crowd.</p><p>Unbeknownst to many, the Qingyang Temple had transformed from a dilapidated temple on Cui Ping Mountain into a significant force, holding a respected position in the wider world.</p><p>Li Yu Fu, Shen Chen, and the others were like seeds he had scattered, without much tending.</p><p>Qin Sang could be considered one of the least responsible ancestors. His ascension to the Mahayana path was a matter of circumstance, yet he'd inexplicably gathered so many followers. They revered him as their ancestor, offering their unwavering respect, admiration, and trust, seeing him as their exemplar and protector, their staunchest supporters.</p><p>Anyone witnessing this scene would surely be moved, especially those who had themselves attained the Mahayana path.</p><p>With so many attachments, could they sever them? Would they even want to?  But without severing these bonds, how could they pursue the immortal path, seek transcendence?</p><p>This was Qin Sang's greatest dilemma concerning the Mahayana path.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the guests, who had risen from their seats.</p><p>"Greetings, Grandmaster Qin!"</p><p>A voice boomed, and the cry swelled into a roar.  Regardless of their inner thoughts, everyone bowed.</p><p>"Greetings, Grandmaster Qin!"</p><p>Humans, demons, spirits, and cultivators from various sects, clans, and powerful families – they represented the entirety of the Storm Realm, bowing before Qin Sang!</p><p>"My esteemed friends," Qin Sang returned a slight bow, chuckling softly.  "In the wider world, among the human cultivators, 'Grandmaster' is a title reserved for those at the Unity Stage. Others are called Masters. For someone of my caliber, at most, a 'Great' is added before Master. I am truly unworthy of such a grand title."</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>Grandmaster Hegao and other Daoist masters looked embarrassed. If even Qin Sang didn't dare claim the title of Grandmaster, what were they?</p><p>Others felt equally uncomfortable. The Buddhist Saints and the Yaozu (Demonic Tribe) Kings held equivalent titles, and if the title of Grandmaster was inappropriate, these titles would be avoided as well.</p><p>The clever amongst them also grasped the underlying meaning: Grandmaster Qin had clearly returned from the wider world, having travelled extensively and interacted with humanity.</p><p>Ignoring their thoughts, Qin Sang continued, "Years ago, I was hunted and barely escaped with my life.  I ascended, believing I'd never return.  Fate, however, intervened. I unexpectedly reunited with Gu Ya, learning of the Storm Realm's ascension..."</p><p>He offered no further explanation, keeping his account brief.</p><p>The crowd gazed towards a peak in the north. Some recognized Gu Ya and knew of her disappearance in the Mist Waterfall. Few expected her survival, let alone her encounter with Grandmaster Qin.</p><p>Learning this, cultivators who had lost loved ones in the Mist Waterfall showed signs of intense emotion. Their relatives might still be alive—a stroke of unexpected luck.</p><p>"Knowing the Storm Realm endured such hardship, and that despite the loss of many, you set aside your differences, united to aid the Immortal Lady Liuli against external threats, persevering through immeasurable difficulties, writing a moving epic with your blood and tears, step by step building the strength to oppose your enemies, fills my heart with comfort! I once sought a method to unite forces to combat the Heavenly Devil's Song, and this proves that such unity is the correct approach."</p><p>Qin Sang's words carried genuine admiration, acknowledging their efforts; the atmosphere relaxed and smiles spread.</p><p>"But…"</p><p>Qin Sang's demeanor shifted, his tone turning cold. "But upon my return, I witnessed scenes that fill me with sorrow! During the crisis in the North Sea, when Immortal Lady Liuli was still recovering from her injuries, some colluded with the enemy, others acted selfishly, some harbored sinister intentions, and others profited from the chaos…"</p><p>Each sentence felt like a biting wind, sweeping through the peaks and piercing the hearts and minds of everyone present.</p>
