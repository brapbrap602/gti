<h1>Chapter 1765: Pursuit and Escape</h1><p>Deep beneath the Rosy Butterfly Mountains.</p><p>A yellow boulder, the size of a millstone.</p><p>The Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower was currently concealed within this stone.</p><p>This type of spiritual herb couldn't be simply defined as a plant. At this moment, in Qin Sang's perception, it was merely a piece of rock.</p><p>This was Qin Sang's first encounter with a spiritual herb possessing such peculiar properties, and he proceeded with extreme caution.</p><p>Quietly, a strange power seeped from Qin Sang's palm into the earth, slowly approaching the yellow boulder.</p><p>This power masked its fluctuations perfectly, moving as silently as falling dew, penetrating layers of rock, and infiltrating the area around the yellow boulder. It resembled a pair of invisible hands, soundlessly closing in.</p><p>Inside the yellow boulder, the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower was quietly rooted, absorbing the earth's energy, completely oblivious to the approaching danger.</p><p>Simultaneously, deep within the earth veins of the Rosy Butterfly Mountains, around each of the flower's seeds, a restrictive spell materialized, as if cradled by a calyx.</p><p>When the moment was right, Qin Sang swiftly closed his net. The power surrounding the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower and the 'calyxes' of all the seeds closed simultaneously.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly sensed something, his expression drastically changing.</p><p>He had left his Sky-Eye Butterfly outside to monitor the mountain's exterior while he harvested the spiritual herb.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to make his move, the Sky-Eye Butterfly suddenly sent a warning: a sudden change had occurred at the Demon Commander's Estate!</p><p>At the two ends of the Rosy Butterfly Mountain Range.</p><p>Two Demon Commander Estates were located there.</p><p>A Demon Commander's Estate could be considered the demonic equivalent of a human Immortal City. Countless well-trained demon soldiers were stationed there, guarding the Demon Commander's cave dwelling.</p><p>During Qin Sang's previous reconnaissance, these demon soldiers trained and patrolled regularly, appearing formidable. But everything followed a pattern.</p><p>He had observed them for a period and grasped their routines, believing these demon soldiers posed little threat to him unless he was surrounded.</p><p>Everything had been normal these past few days.</p><p>Yet today, war drums suddenly thundered from the Demon Commander's Estate, their sound reverberating throughout the Rosy Butterfly Mountains.</p><p>In an instant, squads of grotesque demon soldiers soared into the sky, their killing intent palpable, demonic energy surging.</p><p>The clear sky became overcast with dark clouds, and fierce winds howled.</p><p>Flying birds, running beasts, wood spirits, and stone monsters—within the small confines of the Demon Commander's Estate, all manner of demons could be seen, a veritable pandemonium.</p><p>However, most of these demons possessed low intelligence. Even when barely formed into ranks, they appeared disorganized.</p><p>The true elite were the Demon Commander's personal guards.</p><p>The Crimson Tail Demon Commander was a fire crow that had attained enlightenment. His personal guards were mostly flying creatures, naturally proficient in flight.</p><p>The Gloomlight Demon Commander was a shadow wolf that had taken human form. His subordinates were mostly beasts, but they too knew the art of riding clouds and mist. Combining their demonic arts, they conjured gusts of eerie wind.</p><p>Qin Sang was currently deep within the Rosy Butterfly Mountain Range, closer to the Crimson Tail Demon Commander's Estate. After receiving the Sky-Eye Butterfly's warning, he also faintly sensed the fluctuations in the world's energy.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but be startled, filled with deep perplexity.</p><p>He hadn't actually harvested the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower yet, the earth veins hadn't been disturbed. How had he alerted the Demon Commander's Estate?</p><p>Could they possess some special method for monitoring the surrounding earth veins?</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered, his movements freezing.</p><p>Harvesting the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower couldn't be accomplished instantly, but the current situation couldn't tolerate any delay.</p><p>While Qin Sang didn't believe the two Demon Commanders could threaten him, he had to be wary of the Demon Marquis.</p><p>If he insisted on harvesting the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower and was surrounded by the two Demon Commanders' forces, by the time the Demon Marquis arrived, he might face utter destruction!</p><p>But now that he had alerted the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower, if he retreated, the spiritual flower, once freed, would definitely flee this place, rendering his efforts futile.</p><p>He didn't know how many years he would have to wait to find another opportunity like this.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was caught in this dilemma, the two Demon Commanders appeared amidst their respective troops.</p><p>'Roar... Roar...'</p><p>The demon soldiers guarding their Commanders roared excitedly.</p><p>The Crimson Tail Demon Commander had transformed into a crimson-haired demoness, flames seemingly burning within her crimson pupils. With a single command, a gust of crimson demonic wind swept up her elite subordinates, sending them hurtling towards the sky.</p><p>A similar scene unfolded at the Gloomlight Demon Commander's Estate.</p><p>Confirming that the two Demon Commanders were actually leading their troops away from the mountain, not targeting him, Qin Sang felt a slight relief, yet remained deeply puzzled.</p><p>The two Demon Commanders leaving the mountain simultaneously indicated a significant event.</p><p>Was it an order from the Marquis' Estate, or had some incident occurred nearby?</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know the details, but he had an ominous premonition.</p><p>This was the Demon Marquis's territory, the heart of the Ghostfang Kingdom, enemies everywhere. Getting involved in any conflict would be extremely disadvantageous for him. He had to leave as soon as possible!</p><p>The two Demon Commanders' sudden departure also presented an advantage. Qin Sang no longer needed to worry about exposure.</p><p>He hesitated no longer, fully activating his secret technique, racing against time.</p><p>Curved lines crawled across the surface of the yellow boulder concealing the spiritual flower. Qin Sang's actions startled the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower.</p><p>Instinctively, the spiritual flower attempted to transfer itself to its other seeds, fleeing the danger, but its connection to the seeds had been completely severed!</p><p>At this moment, all the seeds were enveloped by calyxes, isolated from the outside world.</p><p>Confined within the small space, the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower thrashed about inside the yellow boulder but couldn't break through the restrictive spell.</p><p>Having completed the blockade, Qin Sang immediately proceeded to the next step.</p><p>Simultaneously, all the restrictive spells he had cast were activated, and the 'calyxes' encasing the seeds slowly rose.</p><p>A faint image of the spiritual flower first appeared on the surface of the yellow boulder, then gradually solidified, revealing the true form of the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower, its four petals trembling slightly.</p><p>Just then, a faint rumbling emanated from beneath the Rosy Butterfly Mountains, like a minor earthquake.</p><p>This was the result of separating the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower from the earth veins, disturbing the earth's energy, and causing this phenomenon.</p><p>However, the tremors were very slight when they reached the surface. With the Demon Commanders absent, even if the demon soldiers guarding the estate noticed, they wouldn't suspect anything.</p><p>'Whoosh... Whoosh... Whoosh...'</p><p>Points of light continuously flew out from the ground beneath Qin Sang's feet.</p><p>Each point of light represented a seed, until finally, the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower 'grew' beside his feet.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the vibrant spiritual flower. This was the most troublesome spiritual herb he had ever harvested.</p><p>All the seeds trembled simultaneously and merged into the main body.</p><p>The seeds also contained a portion of the medicinal properties. Only by collecting the main plant and all its seeds could it be considered a complete harvest.</p><p>'Snap!'</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved a prepared jade box and stored the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower inside, then ascended to a higher vantage point.</p><p>The Sky-Eye Butterfly landed on his shoulder.</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the Marquis's Estate. The territory was vast, and it was difficult to discern what was happening there based solely on the celestial phenomena. He had no interest in investigating either.</p><p>Having obtained the Dream-Shifting Four Seasons Flower, his objective was achieved. He was eager to return to Crane Cry Mountain immediately, to cultivate peacefully until his breakthrough.</p><p>With a tap of his foot, Qin Sang swept down the mountain and flew westward.</p><p>After leaving the Rosy Butterfly Mountains, Qin Sang felt increasingly uneasy, his expression growing more serious.</p><p>He hadn't traveled far before encountering two groups of demon soldiers, each led by a Demon Commander under the Marquis's command, marching rapidly.</p><p>Qin Sang suspected that all the Demon Commanders under the Marquis's command had been mobilized!</p><p>The ominous premonition in his heart grew stronger. He maintained his speed, continuing forward, and as expected, encountered more demon troops.</p><p>Beside a nameless river, Qin Sang concealed himself within the tree canopy, coldly watching a company of demon soldiers disappear into the distance.</p><p>He pondered silently.</p><p>During this time, he had discerned some patterns.</p><p>The two Demon Commanders from the Rosy Butterfly Mountains were heading towards the Marquis's Estate in the east, while the Demon Commanders he encountered later were not. They were almost all rushing northwest, as if encircling and intercepting someone.</p><p>"Could it be that someone is causing trouble at the Marquis's Estate at this very moment?"</p><p>Given the circumstances, Qin Sang couldn't help but think so.</p><p>He cursed his luck inwardly, considering his current predicament.</p><p>Westward was the shortest route out of the Ghostfang Kingdom, but judging by the demon soldiers' movements, continuing west might lead him into the midst of a fierce battle. North was even less feasible, and returning meant facing the Marquis's Estate.</p><p>To avoid being caught in the crossfire, he could only divert south.</p><p>The one being besieged might be a human cultivator, but Qin Sang had no intention of rescuing them, nor did his strength permit him to do so.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind and immediately changed direction.</p><p>Though eager to escape, Qin Sang dared not utilize his fastest technique, Thunder Escape. This area was teeming with demons, and Thunder Escape was too conspicuous.  If he used it, he would inevitably become a target.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't without other options.  Leaping down from the tree canopy, he transformed, shifting into his Spiritwood Form.</p><p>He deliberately controlled his size, keeping it similar to his original body. While this limited his physical combat abilities, it offered greater agility.</p><p>The instant his feet touched the ground, Qin Sang vanished.</p><p>In the next moment, a tree-man emerged from an ancient tree deep within the forest, then silently disappeared again.</p><p>Qin Sang utilized the Spiritwood Form's ability to move between plants.</p><p>His aura blended seamlessly with the surrounding vegetation, easily deceiving the demon soldiers.</p><p>Despite its seemingly cumbersome appearance, the Spiritwood Form was surprisingly swift.</p><p>While Qin Sang continued south, True Man Cui Wei was being pursued by two Demon Marquises, his situation perilous.</p><p>His exposure had been accidental, and he was completely unprepared.</p><p>Discovering that two Demon Marquises were closing in on him, True Man Cui Wei realized that the Marquis had been prepared. Even if his plan to lure the snake out of its hole had worked, capturing the demon would have been impossible.</p><p>Aware of his dangerous predicament, True Man Cui Wei didn't hesitate. He turned and fled.</p><p>The golden-armored giant and the Marquis had been waiting, ready for this. How could they allow him to escape? They pursued relentlessly.</p><p>The Marquis's cultivation was inferior to the golden-armored giant's, but he excelled in escape techniques. The two demons flew side-by-side, their escaping lights as fast as lightning.</p><p>"So it's this old bastard!"</p><p>The Marquis gnashed his teeth. He and True Man Cui Wei were old acquaintances.</p><p>"Why haven't his accomplices shown up yet?"</p><p>The golden-armored giant was puzzled. He didn't believe True Man Cui Wei would dare come alone.</p><p>The Marquis didn't answer, part of his mind focused on communicating with the outside, issuing commands.</p><p>All the demon soldiers in his entire territory had been mobilized.</p><p>The Ghostfang Kingdom and the Dao Court had been battling for many years, reaching the pinnacle of battle formations. They had frequently overcome stronger opponents with weaker forces, and under the leadership of a Demon Marquis, they could unleash even more astonishing combat power.</p><p>However, encircling and killing a Hollow Profound True Man was no easy feat. It required meticulous planning.</p><p>The Marquis's subordinates were scattered throughout his territory, seemingly disorganized, but in reality, they were following a precise order, gradually tightening the noose.</p><p>The distance between them and True Man Cui Wei was steadily shrinking.</p><p>Just then, the golden-armored giant let out a surprised "Eh?" His escaping light abruptly halted, his golden armor radiating a dazzling light.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, four towering pillars, each a thousand feet tall, rose from the surrounding mountain peaks, reaching towards the clouds.</p><p>The two demons had just stepped into the area enclosed by the four pillars.</p><p>If Qin Sang had been nearby, he would have felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>Half of each of the four pillars was crimson red, blazing with flames, while the other half was deathly pale, radiating chilling coldness. The crisp sound of chains constantly echoed—it was the Water and Fire Heavenly Prison he had encountered before!</p><p>However, the prison created by that Altar Master was no match for this Water and Fire Heavenly Prison in either scale or power.</p><p>Four Pillars forming the Prison.</p><p>Water and Fire intertwined.</p><p>Countless crimson beams shot forth from the heavenly fire.</p><p>On the other side, the frigid air froze heaven and earth.</p><p>Any creature unfortunate enough to fall into the Heavenly Prison would be either incinerated or frozen to death, instantly transforming the area into a desolate wasteland.</p><p>This was a true death prison, and only the two demons who had just entered remained alive.</p><p>The Marquis instinctively tried to retreat.</p><p>The golden-armored giant roared, and amidst the dazzling golden light, he transformed into a golden-furred ape as massive as a mountain.</p><p>A terrifying aura shook heaven and earth, but the four pillars of the Heavenly Prison remained unmoved, as endless water and fire surged towards them.</p><p>The golden-furred ape snorted disdainfully, a puff of white air escaping his nostrils. He didn't retreat a single step, planting his feet atop two mountain peaks, puffing out his chest, and raising his colossal arms, pushing them outwards with immense force.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The water and fire were actually forced back.</p><p>The golden-furred ape seemed to have opened a door in the void, resisting the binding force of the Heavenly Prison. Under the strain, the two pillars closest to him trembled violently.</p><p>He abruptly raised his head, his sharp gaze piercing through the gap between the water and fire. "So it's you!"</p><p>Three figures were currently suspended above the Heavenly Prison.</p><p>It was True Man Cui Wei, along with the Ninth Heaven Golden Que Censor and the dark-skinned stranger who had come to his aid.</p><p>"Marquis Xuan Jing, it's been a while!"</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Golden Que Censor looked down from above, his tone indifferent. But this wasn't the time for idle chatter, so he nodded at the dark-skinned stranger beside him.</p><p>The dark-skinned stranger tossed out a scroll, which unfurled in midair. Eight silver talismans immediately flew out from it, heading straight for the two demons.</p><p>This was originally meant to be an ambush tactic, but now it could only be used to stall the enemy.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>The Ninth Heaven Golden Que Censor frowned at True Man Cui Wei. He had arrived as agreed, but True Man Cui Wei had already fled.</p><p>"I overestimated myself," True Man Cui Wei didn't offer any excuses, his voice grave. "The demons were prepared. We must leave quickly. There will be someone to meet us outside the Ghostfang Kingdom."</p><p>With that, the three of them didn't hesitate any longer, flying away without any intention of engaging in a protracted battle.</p><p>'Roar!'</p><p>Seeing the three escape, the golden-furred ape roared towards the heavens. The muscles throughout his body bulged, and his incredibly potent blood essence surged into his arms. With a mighty push, a thunderous boom resounded. The four pillars collapsed, and the Heavenly Prison was shattered by his brute force!</p><p>Flowing fire scattered, and icy air surged, turning the surroundings into a desolate wasteland.</p><p>Then, the golden-furred ape leaped powerfully, smashing his fists against the eight talismans.  A white light shot out from the Marquis's back, transforming into a sword shape, assisting the golden-furred ape in breaking the talismans.</p><p>With unmatched might, the golden-furred ape shattered the eight talismans one by one.</p><p>Just then, the Marquis's face suddenly darkened. "Someone infiltrated the Marquis's Estate!"</p><p>The golden-furred ape was stunned, then sneered.  "Could their target be the treasures in your estate, brother?"</p><p>The Marquis frowned. To prevent leaks, many valuable treasures hadn't been moved. Losing them would be a significant loss, but the Dao Court officials certainly wouldn't be interested in them.</p><p>"A diversionary tactic!"</p><p>The golden-furred ape snorted. "Fourth Brother and the others should have arrived. Send a message for Fourth Brother to go back and keep an eye on that thief. We'll continue the pursuit, leaving no one alive!"</p><p>The Marquis nodded.</p><p>The reinforcements he had called upon were not limited to one. However, for a nebulous enemy, it was impossible for all of them to wait here with him.</p><p>Marquis Xuan Jing had the deepest relationship with him and had accepted his invitation, staying here for several years.</p><p>Upon discovering the enemy, he immediately sent a warning message. His reinforcements arrived via the Marquis's Estate's teleportation formation.  Unexpectedly, as soon as they left the estate, someone else infiltrated it.</p><p>The Marquis sent the message as planned.  Seeing the golden-furred ape transform into a golden light and fly away, he quickly followed in pursuit. (End of Chapter)</p>
