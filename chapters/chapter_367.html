<h1>Chapter 360: Six Hundred Years</h1><p>Li Yufu took Qin Sang's words to heart, vowing to earnestly inherit and expand the legacy of the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang retrieved the complete *Book of the Netherworld* he had purchased at the Gloom Mountain Market and gifted it to Li Yufu. The foundational spells within were carefully selected and would provide Li Yufu with ample material to study.</p><p>Additionally, Qin Sang chose several practical artifacts from his storage pouch and gave them to Li Yufu for self-defense.</p><p>The best among them was the Sky Shuttle replaced by the Ghost Cloud. In case of danger, it could be used for escape and would serve Li Yufu well until the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>“Since you call me Senior Uncle, consider these a welcome gift,” Qin Sang said with a touch of sentimentality. “Your current circumstances are far better than mine when I first embarked on this path. Remember to cultivate diligently and never slack off. Senior Wanderer dislikes laziness…”</p><p>Li Yufu nodded repeatedly. “I will definitely study hard and practice diligently!”</p><p>Qin Sang then explained the *Book of the Netherworld* and some common knowledge of the cultivation world to Li Yufu in detail.</p><p>“After sensing spiritual energy, you can use Marrow Nourishing Soup to aid your cultivation…”</p><p>“You are not a child, and the world is dangerous. I don't need to lecture you on that. The cultivation world is no different from the mortal world – it's a place where the strong prey on the weak and deceit runs rampant. You are new to cultivation and your strength is meager. Remember to be low-key and avoid showing off your powers, lest you attract disaster. If you encounter trouble you can't handle, take my token and seek help from the nearest Han Manor. You'll be safe there…”</p><p>“The next time we meet, I will inform Senior Wanderer of your situation. Wait patiently at Green Ram Temple.”</p><p>After paying respects to Abbot Silentheart and Mingyue once again, Qin Sang, despite the pleas of Li Yufu and his master, set off that very night. Under their reluctant gazes, he ascended on a cloud, heading towards Mount Shaohua.</p><p>Along the way, Qin Sang remained lost in thought, unable to enter meditation.</p><p>This return to the Great Sui Dynasty brought regret, nostalgia, and relief…</p><p>A mix of emotions welled up in his heart.</p><p>Like a gentle breeze rippling the surface of still water.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang slowly closed his eyes, and the turbulence within subsided.</p><p>Times had changed.</p><p>The past was settled.</p><p>…</p><p>Mount Shaohua.</p><p>His sect was in sight, but Qin Sang didn't stop. He flew directly over Mount Shaohua and entered the Vast Azure Swamp.</p><p>Arriving at a desolate stretch of water, Qin Sang cautiously observed his surroundings before quietly revealing himself. He used a water遁 technique to dive into the depths.</p><p>He continued to descend to the bottom.</p><p>Spiritual energy was thin here, and the underwater world was exceptionally barren.</p><p>Thick mud and sand were covered with clumps of aquatic plants. Qin Sang moved through them like a fish, heading towards a location etched in his memory.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang paused, his eyes gleaming as he surveyed the area.</p><p>Compared to other places, there was nothing unusual here. Even with his divine sense meticulously searching inch by inch, he couldn't detect anything amiss.</p><p>The spiritual spring and the Nine Phantasmal Orchid were hidden here by Qin Sang!</p><p>The spiritual vein was still thousands of feet below the mud and sand.  Qin Sang had spent a considerable amount of time meticulously locating this inconspicuous vein.</p><p>Since the vein was small and isolated, and the Black Tortoise Shell Formation sealed the spiritual energy tightly, it was now extremely well-hidden. Even a Golden Core cultivator, unless they turned the place upside down, wouldn't be able to detect its presence.</p><p>Although the spiritual vein was hidden and Qin Sang was confident it wouldn't be discovered, the Nine Phantasmal Orchid was too precious. Even in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, he couldn't help but worry about it.</p><p>Upon his return, the first thing he did was to check on the orchid.</p><p>“However, I should come here as little as possible in the future, just in case…” Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>Returning to the Vast Azure Swamp, Qin Sang didn't interact with other cultivators. But from various signs, he could tell that the atmosphere in the swamp was indeed tense. Cultivators were hurrying about, worried about the future.</p><p>The Vast Azure Swamp was vast and boundless. If a war broke out between the Heavenly March Alliance and the Small Cold Region, it would only be in the central area of the swamp. Unless the Small Cold Region completely gave up resistance and retreated steadily, it wouldn't affect this area in the short term. There was no need to move the Nine Phantasmal Orchid yet, and Qin Sang couldn't find a more suitable place for now.</p><p>However, the Vast Azure Swamp was now a mix of all sorts of people. Various sects had also sent disciples into the swamp to investigate the situation. If someone with ulterior motives discovered his tracks on the way, the existence of the spiritual spring might be exposed.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Qin Sang burrowed into the mud and sand, diving straight down.</p><p>Reaching the location of the spiritual vein, Qin Sang stopped, sensed the resistance, activated the Black Tortoise Shell Formation, and flashed inside.</p><p>Rich spiritual energy washed over him, and a look of comfort appeared on Qin Sang's face. He quickly widened his eyes and looked towards the spiritual spring.</p><p>The cave was very simple and small. In the center, where there used to be a boulder, Qin Sang had hollowed it out and planted the source of the spiritual spring. It had now manifested into a clear pool, and in its center, the Nine Phantasmal Orchid swayed gracefully.</p><p>The moment he saw the Nine Phantasmal Orchid, Qin Sang let out a soft gasp, his expression filled with surprise.</p><p>The orchid, originally seven-petaled, entirely purple, and shaped like a snow-covered black orchid, now had all its petals tightly closed, and its vibrant purple had faded somewhat.</p><p>“This is… the end of the seventh transformation, the beginning of the eighth!” Qin Sang was overjoyed.</p><p>In the notes left by the master alchemist, the several transformations of the Nine Phantasmal Orchid were described in detail.</p><p>In the eighth transformation, all colors would completely fade, and the petals would turn pure white. By the ninth transformation, when the Nine Phantasmal Orchid matured, its form would also transform into that of the most common orchid.</p><p>This process could be described as a return to its original nature.</p><p>When all the purple completely disappeared and the petals bloomed again, the eighth transformation would be complete. As long as the spiritual energy remained rich and didn't affect the growth of the spiritual herb, it would only be five hundred years away from maturity.</p><p>Now, the Nine Phantasmal Orchid seemed to have just formed its bud. Qin Sang estimated that the eighth transformation would begin in about twenty or thirty years.</p><p>At that time, he would be exactly one hundred years old.</p><p>In other words, even if nothing unexpected happened, he would have to wait until he was six hundred years old to see the Nine Phantasmal Orchid mature.</p><p>And the lifespan of a Golden Core cultivator was only five hundred years.</p><p>“Six hundred years old… should I look for life-extending pills?” Qin Sang had a headache. In the cultivation world, pills that could extend one’s life by twenty or thirty years were highly sought after. What was the concept of a hundred years of life?</p><p>Moreover, it was said that the effects of such pills couldn't be simply stacked; their potency would diminish.</p><p>“I can only take it one step at a time. I haven't formed my Golden Core yet, so it's pointless to overthink.”</p><p>“No matter what, I can't miss the Tribulation Avoidance Pill. A twenty percent chance of forming a Nascent Soul is too tempting and crucial for me. Whether it’s increasing my lifespan or hastening the growth of the spiritual herb, I must find a way!”</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fists.</p><p>Squatting by the pool, he gazed at the Nine Phantasmal Orchid for a while. Then, Qin Sang sealed the cave again, quietly retreated some distance, and flew away on his light.</p>
