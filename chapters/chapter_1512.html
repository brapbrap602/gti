<h1>Chapter 1503: Hum and Ha </h1><p>The Ice Jade Cauldron stood firmly, its ears and feet forming a square base. Each of its four sides was etched with a different image of wind and snow – some depicting bone-chilling, sinister winds, others showing heavy, goose-feather snow.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang made his move, and the four images projected into reality.</p><p>The 'whooshing' of the wind was unsettling. These winds were gray, clearly visible, and unlike ordinary cold winds, they contained the power of a spirit treasure, sharper than any blade or sword.</p><p>The gray wind swept across the sky, permeating everything, but was immediately swallowed by a blizzard, which then whipped up countless snow leaves, resembling an avalanche.</p><p>The battle took place at the edge of the black mist, where the light was already very dim. Now, with the wind and snow raging, all that remained visible to the naked eye was a expanse of grayish-white.</p><p>Various strange phenomena emerged with the appearance of the Ice Jade Cauldron.</p><p>Amidst the fierce wind and blizzard, the giant cauldron shone brightly. Its power suppressed the surrounding space, and the black mist even seemed to solidify.</p><p>Hall Master Jiang's eyes were only on Shang Lu, disregarding everyone else. He formed a hand seal with one hand and uttered, "Suppress!"</p><p>The giant cauldron made a resounding 'clang', and the strange phenomena on its four sides rapidly converged inward, merging together. Along with the giant cauldron, it appeared above Shang Lu's head and crashed down with overwhelming force.</p><p>Faced with Hall Master Jiang's all-out attack, Shang Lu's face was filled with shock and fury, and he could only respond.</p><p>The jade ruler suddenly sprang up, striking after, but arriving before. For a moment, illusory mountain shadows stretched endlessly, as if the force of mountains had been superimposed onto the ruler.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>A muffled sound.</p><p>The wind and snow phenomenon above, the illusory mountain scenery below, suddenly collided!</p><p>The mountains turned white in an instant.</p><p>The two phenomena almost collapsed simultaneously, the fragments of the illusions tightly intertwined, indistinguishable and chaotic.</p><p>Amidst the chaotic phenomena, the resounding vibrations of the two spirit treasures continued, both incredibly deep, like a series of drumbeats, shaking the soul.</p><p>The jade ruler firmly held back the giant cauldron, appearing thin and fragile, yet exceptionally sturdy.</p><p>The two spirit treasures seemed to be evenly matched.</p><p>At this critical moment, a ball of white light suddenly surged from Shang Lu's chest, revealing the phantom of a protective heart mirror – his spirit treasure capable of automatically defending its master.</p><p>The white light rapidly converged at the back of Shang Lu's head, forming a mirror of light.</p><p>The intense white light instantly drew countless gazes. The mirror of light clearly reflected the unprecedented look of horror on Shang Lu's face.</p><p>Seeing this, Hall Master Yin and the others felt a pang of dread.</p><p>Before they could react, a crisp 'snap' sounded. A crystalline, adorable, emerald-green sword, seemingly made of jade marrow, appeared out of thin air, blocked by the mirror of light.</p><p>The small sword pressed against the center of the mirror of light. Its sword gleam was not dazzling, but its power was extraordinary. The light mirror crackled wildly, and cracks spread rapidly, looking as if it would be pierced through at any moment.</p><p>"Azure Firmament Sword!"</p><p>Hall Master Yin and the others' expressions changed drastically.</p><p>This sword was Tong Lingyu's natal spirit treasure. After she became the Grand Elder, she gained the authority to wield a supreme treasure, and rarely used the Azure Firmament Sword.</p><p>They naturally knew the origin of this sword.</p><p>For a moment, everyone, including Shang Lu, had only one thought in their minds – how is this possible!</p><p>Tong Lingyu had been captured by the Palace Master and would definitely be refined into a Blood Servant. There was absolutely no chance of her turning the tables.</p><p>If the Palace Master succeeded in his tribulation, there was no need to say more.</p><p>Even if the Palace Master failed his tribulation, Tong Lingyu would undoubtedly die. Hall Master Jiang's side would also lose their Great Cultivator and be unable to harm them. At worst, they would go their separate ways after returning.</p><p>The world's general trend, is to unite after long division and divide after long union.</p><p>Anyway, the internal strife of the Profound Heaven Palace was not one or two times, and it had always been like this.</p><p>Shang Lu believed he was in an invincible position, but he never expected Tong Lingyu to escape from the Heavenly Pit alive and launch a sneak attack from behind.</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>Shang Lu cursed inwardly. This was his last thought.</p><p>He flicked his long sleeve, hastily attempting to deploy another protective spirit treasure, the Snow Kerchief, but his arm had barely lifted when his entire body stiffened.</p><p>An invisible, bone-penetrating chill enveloped him.</p><p>Ice Soul Divine Light!</p><p>Qin Sang and the other two naturally wouldn't overlook Shang Lu's self-protecting spirit treasure. With a simple trick, they succeeded. Shang Lu had tested Liuli at the wedding ceremony, but he had also exposed his own methods, otherwise, he could have struggled a little longer.</p><p>'Crack! Crack!'</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light froze Shang Lu and the surrounding void.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a sword light far more dazzling than the Azure Firmament Sword, accompanied by a metallic, resonant cry, shot out from the depths of the black mist, piercing through Shang Lu's flesh and blood!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The sword light was dazzling, like a roaming dragon.</p><p>The Golden Serenity Sword seemed to be venting its master's frustration from facing Yin Changsheng earlier.</p><p>Shang Lu lowered his head, staring blankly at the bloody hole in his chest and abdomen. The vitality in his eyes rapidly faded. He didn't even have time to flee with his Nascent Soul. His insides were churned into a pulp by the sword energy, and he died on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang, the other two, and Hall Master Jiang cooperated seamlessly, easily slaying Shang Lu.</p><p>'Plop!'</p><p>Shang Lu's corpse fell to the ground.</p><p>The sudden turn of events.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Yue stared at Shang Lu's corpse, his expression dazed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Suddenly, a startling thunderclap exploded in his ear, shocking the cultivator surnamed Yue into a shiver.</p><p>It was Hall Master Yin, seeing the unfavorable situation, who quickly retrieved a fist-sized, transparent water ball from his Mustard Seed Bag and threw it out without hesitation.</p><p>The water ball was a disposable spirit treasure similar to a thunder bead, containing condensed Azure Wood Divine Thunder. It was a treasure that Hall Master Yin had obtained by chance.</p><p>Once detonated, the Azure Wood Divine Thunder was extremely powerful, one of Hall Master Yin's trump cards.</p><p>However, he didn't throw this treasure behind him or to save someone, but aimed it at Elder Mei and the others.</p><p>Hall Master Yin, experienced in countless battles, realized the danger the moment he saw the Azure Firmament Sword. Unlike the cultivator surnamed Yue, he didn't hesitate and made the most correct response with extreme speed – escape!</p><p>Regardless of how Tong Lingyu survived, it meant that the Palace Master's plan had failed.</p><p>Tong Lingyu would never let them go.</p><p>There were at least three people in the black mist.</p><p>Shang Lu was dead, and Hall Master Yin knew he had no chance of winning.</p><p>The Azure Wood Divine Thunder was condensed into a ball, its interior like water, pure and flawless, with no trace of anything related to thunder or lightning.</p><p>The moment it left his hand, the water ball expanded rapidly. Finally, faint, tiny azure thunder threads became visible inside.</p><p>In an instant, the Azure Wood Divine Thunder formed a net of lightning, which then contracted inward. With a stretch and a contraction, it transformed into a pearl-sized, azure bead.</p><p>Elder Mei, bearing the brunt of the attack, was momentarily stunned. Her expression changed drastically, and she hurriedly twisted her fingers. The icy path on the ground vanished without a trace, and a drop of water condensed at her fingertip, instantly transforming into a solid shield.</p><p>Almost at the instant the bead exploded, the solid shield barely formed, and was almost immediately covered by azure thunder. Countless cracks instantly spread across its surface.</p><p>Elder Mei felt as if she had been struck by a heavy hammer. She groaned, stumbled backward, and her face turned pale.</p><p>The others standing in front of Hall Master Yin were also blown away along with Elder Mei. Although no one perished, they could no longer stop Hall Master Yin.</p><p>Hall Master Yin's figure darted out. Still feeling his speed was insufficient, he slapped a yellow talisman onto himself, greatly increasing his escape velocity. He instantly dashed towards the outside of the mountain, fleeing towards the exit of the Sacred Land without looking back.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before he even flew out of the floating mountain, Hall Master Yin suddenly heard a calm question.</p><p>"Where does Fellow Daoist Yin think he's going?"</p><p>As the voice sounded, a bolt of lightning broke through the black mist, piercing through the air, its speed reaching the extreme. Even with the spirit talisman's boost, Hall Master Yin was no match for his opponent. In an instant, he was overtaken.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Qin Sang stepped out from the lightning, his Phoenix Wings slowly retracting behind him, effortlessly blocking Hall Master Yin's path.</p><p>"It's you!"</p><p>Hall Master Yin's mind was far beyond ordinary. He quickly calmed down, his gaze flickering. He said coldly, "Did you and that rebel Tong Lingyu join forces to murder the Palace Master?"</p><p>"Did Fellow Daoist not see the thunder tribulation just now?"</p><p>Qin Sang said playfully, "Yin Changsheng failed his breakthrough and died under his own Heavenly Tribulation. What does that have to do with me?"</p><p>Hall Master Yin snorted, not arguing. He glanced back at the black mist and spoke rapidly, "With Fellow Daoist's divine powers, are you willing to be subservient to a mere woman? With the Palace Master's demise, I am the master of the Profound Heaven lineage. After Shang Lu and the others die, the Heavenly Mountain lineage will be scattered and pose no threat. The Listening Snow Tower lineage has deep ties with Fellow Daoist. We can cooperate from inside and out, join forces to eliminate that rebel Tong, and seize the supreme treasure. After we return, who's to say how we'll spin the tale? At that time, all four lineages will be in our hands. One of us can be the Palace Master, the other the Grand Elder, controlling the number one sect in the North Sea. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Not only will the supreme treasure belong to you, but I can also promise not to interfere in any affairs outside the Profound Heaven lineage..."</p><p>Qin Sang's lips curled slightly, and he chuckled, "Fellow Daoist's proposal is indeed quite tempting, but unfortunately, I have no interest in power. Moreover, Fellow Daoist sang in harmony with Shang Lu at the wedding ceremony, and was already plotting against me with Yin Changsheng. This is something I cannot tolerate."</p><p>Hall Master Yin's expression darkened. He no longer held any hope.</p><p>"I'd like to see how capable you are, daring to stop me alone!"</p><p>Hall Master Yin roared. He opened his mouth and spat out a secretly prepared ball of blue light.</p><p>The light ball split into ten, soaring into the air and transforming into ten blue halos, hovering above.</p><p>Each halo was the size of a human head. After dividing, they quickly wriggled, turning into ten ice mirrors. Each mirror had complex runes etched on its surface, all aimed at Qin Sang.</p><p>"Nether Gloom Divine Restriction..."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the ice mirrors, his expression unchanged.</p><p>The moment Hall Master Yin unleashed the light ball, he felt a familiar fluctuation.</p><p>Having witnessed the power of the Nether Gloom Divine Restriction earlier, Qin Sang naturally wouldn't forget it.</p><p>However, when Yin Changsheng used this restriction, there were thirteen ice mirrors. Hall Master Yin could only conjure ten, and the runes on the mirror surfaces were less complex than Yin Changsheng's, making its power considerably weaker.</p><p>The mirror surfaces emitted strange light, transforming into a restriction diagram, aimed at Qin Sang, and ruthlessly smashed down.</p><p>'Swish! Swish! Swish!'</p><p>Seats of ice rose, and the light of the divine restriction immediately engulfed Qin Sang.</p><p>Seeing this, Hall Master Yin's face was just starting to show joy when it suddenly turned to horror.</p><p>Within the divine restriction, a powerful aura of demonic fire suddenly erupted, and a black shadow charged out – a fire dragon composed of demonic fire!</p><p>The restriction diagrams shattered one after another.</p><p>Under Hall Master Yin's horrified gaze, the fire dragon, with overwhelming force, broke through the layers of restriction diagrams. Its body twisted slightly, and then it charged without hesitation towards the ice mirrors above.</p><p>'Hua!'</p><p>The ice mirrors shattered instantly, swept away by the demonic fire.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure remained in place. He pointed two fingers at Hall Master Yin, and the demonic fire dragon swooped down.</p><p>Yin Changsheng's meticulously arranged, full-power Nether Gloom Divine Restriction could withstand the Nine Nether Demonic Fire, let alone this!</p><p>In his haste, Hall Master Yin flicked his head, and white steam rose from the top of his head, transforming into a Profound Qi Grand Hand. Its power surpassed that of the cultivator surnamed Yue, but was still inferior to Yin Changsheng's.</p><p>This kind of top-tier divine power wouldn't be too abundant even in the Profound Heaven Palace's treasury.</p><p>Hall Master Yin was like a smaller version of Yin Changsheng, his cultivation techniques and divine powers originating from the same source.</p><p>For Qin Sang, two similar opponents, but two different feelings, dealing with Hall Master Yin was obviously much easier. At this moment, he didn't even need to use his Heavenly Eye Divine Light.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Profound Qi Grand Hand opened and closed, grabbing at the fire dragon.</p><p>The demonic fire had no substance and suddenly dispersed.</p><p>Surrounded by the raging fire, the Profound Qi Grand Hand immediately showed signs of dissipating.</p><p>Hall Master Yin gritted his teeth, his mind stirred slightly, and he detonated the Profound Qi Grand Hand without hesitation to buy time. Simultaneously, his right wrist twitched almost imperceptibly, and a silver gleam flashed and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment.</p><p>The silver gleam reappeared, but it was less than a foot away from Qin Sang.</p><p>This object was originally a silver needle as fine as a hair. It moved without any sound or fluctuation, extremely insidious. By the time the opponent noticed something amiss, it was too late to defend.</p><p>However, no matter how concealed, it couldn't escape Qin Sang's detection.</p><p>He had too many ways to deal with it.</p><p>His Phoenix Wings trembled behind him, suddenly spreading open. Qin Sang was about to transform into lightning and teleport elsewhere.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly heard two consecutive soft shouts.</p><p>"Hum!"</p><p>"Ha!"</p><p>The 'Hum' and 'Ha' were not actual shouts.</p><p>Even if someone stood beside Qin Sang at this moment, they wouldn't hear this sound, because the shouts were an attack on the Primordial Spirit!</p><p>A Divine Sense attack secret technique!</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up.</p><p>He had always been very interested in this type of secret technique, but he had never found one powerful enough. He possessed a strong Divine Sense but couldn't unleash its full potential.</p><p>Yin Changsheng perished under the Heavenly Tribulation, and Qin Sang originally thought that his Divine Sense attack secret technique, like the second half of the *Treasure Unification Secret Art*, had been taken to the underworld with him.</p><p>Hall Master Yin knew it too!</p><p>It felt somewhat similar, but also different from Yin Changsheng's. He didn't know if Hall Master Yin hadn't mastered it, or if Yin Changsheng had modified it later.</p><p>Yin Changsheng had sealed himself in an ice coffin for hundreds of years, so he had plenty of time to refine secret techniques.</p><p>"Showing off in front of an expert!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered. He showed no signs of being affected. He transformed into lightning, easily dodging the silver needle, and then his遁light turned, charging straight towards Hall Master Yin.</p><p>His killing move was broken.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Profound Qi Grand Hand was extinguished in the demonic flames, unable to block the fire dragon.</p><p>Hall Master Yin's mind was greatly shaken. He hurriedly conjured a square seal. The ancient characters on the seal emitted light, each character imbued with divine power, shooting out one after another, stubbornly resisting.</p><p>But before Hall Master Yin could breathe a sigh of relief, his surroundings suddenly darkened, and a sharp aura permeated everything.</p><p>All that remained within his vision were countless sword threads.</p><p>"Sword array!"</p><p>Hall Master Yin was shocked, unable to attend to his own safety.</p><p>The sound of the ancient characters shattering was like a series of muffled thunderclaps, making him feel even more terrified.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The square seal exhausted its power.</p><p>The demonic fire and the sword array converged from above and below, and the scene inside was chaotic to the extreme. Outsiders could no longer see Hall Master Yin and Qin Sang, only hearing the constant sounds of collisions.</p><p>Taking advantage of the chaos, the external incarnation quietly appeared behind Hall Master Yin.</p><p>By the time Hall Master Yin noticed something amiss behind him, it was too late.</p><p>'Puchi!'</p><p>The external incarnation's palm transformed into a sharp ice claw, piercing deeply into Hall Master Yin's back.</p><p>A light flashed from the top of Hall Master Yin's head, and his Nascent Soul fled.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as the Nascent Soul appeared, a demonic fire seemed to have been waiting there, charging straight at it. Hall Master Yin's expression instantly became dazed. Before he could teleport, he was imprisoned!</p>
