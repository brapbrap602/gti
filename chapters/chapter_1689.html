<h1>Chapter 1680: The Calming Mantra</h1><p>Two powerful cultivators were simultaneously targeting them.</p><p>No one wanted to incur the wrath of two such formidable individuals.</p><p>No one dared openly defy orders; the key was the lack of a guaranteed escape. Not everyone possessed a Shadow Escape Talisman.</p><p>As for the promise made by the Hui Guang Saint, no one was sure how credible it was, but it was all they could do to reassure themselves.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint likely made this public announcement to appease everyone, not using secret voice transmission, but an open promise witnessed by the many cultivators outside the mountain.  The Saint would have to consider the Buddhist sect's reputation, and wouldn't easily break their word.</p><p>Fan Laomo stayed by Hui Guang Saint's side, understanding that the Saint wouldn't easily let him go, and didn't even attempt to leave.</p><p>Yue Liting's expression shifted, regretting his greed after obtaining the Earth element inheritance, and for joining this chaos.  He helplessly bowed to the monk's illusory form and turned to climb the mountain.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren meticulously prepared the remains of Zi Lei Zhenren, following orders to return to the summit, remaining silent. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>They hailed from prominent sects, all sect leaders or Grand Elders, holding revered positions and significant influence in the cultivation world. Facing two powerful cultivators, they didn't lose their composure.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar and Mo Xingdao's backgrounds were far less impressive.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only an avatar. As long as the original body was safe, Qin Sang wouldn't be fundamentally harmed.</p><p>The avatar remained calm and flew towards the summit unhurriedly.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was undoubtedly the most anxious and conflicted. The only fortunate thing was that his puppet was hidden, providing a possible escape should the situation worsen.</p><p>Should things go wrong, sending the puppet away with the Spiritual Insight Immortal Fruit would be a valuable bargaining chip.</p><p>Mo Xingdao steadied himself and returned to the mountain.</p><p>Soon, almost all cultivators on Mount Disu gathered at the summit.</p><p>He Gao Zhenren, Fan Laomo, Yue Liting, Mo Xingdao, Qin Sang's avatar, plus Qin Sang's original body hidden in the stone house, the possibly deceased Poison King, Master Huaiyin recovering outside the mountain, and the missing Su Zinan – only these few remained among the top experts who had previously entered the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>They exchanged glances, all speechless. The previous scheming and rivalry now seemed like a joke.</p><p>"Recite this 'Calming Mantra' three cycles. If you sense anything unusual, immediately close your mind and don't take any chances!"</p><p>Hui Guang Saint projected a stream of light, creating bright characters that floated in mid-air, emitting a radiant glow.</p><p>Everyone looked up and saw a rather profound secret technique. The name was simple, and its cultivation wasn't difficult.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint didn't explain the mantra's origin.</p><p>This technique actually originated from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. It was created by the sect's experts during the Demon Calamity to counter demonic corruption.</p><p>Cultivators recently affected by demonic corruption could, with a high probability, detect abnormalities using this mantra, allowing them to address the issue promptly. The cultivator's higher cultivation level, the better the effect.</p><p>The appearance of this technique was a turning point in the battle, containing the Demon Calamity to the two southern provinces.</p><p>Of course, the 'Calming Mantra' wasn't foolproof.  It was said that demonic corruption varied in strength. If a powerful demon cultivated a potent technique, carefully plotted and acted slowly to conceal it deeply, the chances of detection were very low.</p><p>The Wuxiang Immortal Sect experts had overrelied on the mantra, only realizing their mistake too late and being forced to seal themselves away.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint had learned the details from Fan Laomo. Since the Demon Child had only recently been unsealed and was heavily influenced by the Heavenly Dao's demonic sound, they shouldn't have the opportunity or ability to perform deeper corruption.</p><p>The summit was filled with top experts; the stronger their willpower, the greater their resistance to demonic corruption.</p><p>The 'Calming Mantra' would suffice.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint took this precautionary measure to prevent any chaos during the upcoming battle.</p><p>Everyone was familiar with the Demon Calamity and the dangers of demonic corruption, so they readily followed instructions, silently reciting the 'Calming Mantra,' including others who witnessed it.</p><p>While distributing the mantra, Hui Guang Saint's stern voice echoed again within and outside Mount Disu.</p><p>"Leave the Central Plains within three days, and never return!"</p><p>In a hidden location...</p><p>Su Zinan hid using an escape talisman, looking up at the summit, his face pale.</p><p>Within moments, two extremely powerful consciousnesses had scanned him dozens of times. If not for the talisman's protection, he would have been exposed.</p><p>Su Zinan understood that Hui Guang Saint's warning was mainly directed at him. Though not a threat, the chilling intent in the Saint's tone made his heart pound.</p><p>He inwardly grumbled, but ultimately dared not act rashly.</p><p>At this moment...</p><p>Hui Guang Shengzhe and Qing Hu Shengwang focused their energies on the demonic body.</p><p>Within the mountain's depths, various strange lights flickered incessantly.  The five-colored crown's radiance grew increasingly intense, completely engulfing the demonic body in its light. The gray cocoon containing the Poison King was nearly swallowed as well.</p><p>Only the cocoon's outline, a large bulge, was discernible within the five-colored light.  No one knew how long the cocoon could hold.</p><p>After Qing Hu Shengwang arrived to assist, Hui Guang Shengzhe finally had some energy to spare.  He subtly redirected the Fa Hua Zhen Wheel towards the cocoon. Silver rings encircled the cocoon, not to restrain it, but to help the Poison King withstand the five-colored light.</p><p>The Poison King within, sensing the Fa Hua Zhen Wheel's fluctuations, caused the cocoon to rise and fall, echoing the silver rings as they jointly resisted the demonic entity.  For now, it didn't seem in danger of breaking, but that was all they could manage.</p><p>Unable to rescue the Poison King immediately, Hui Guang Shengzhe knew not to rush, focusing on the demonic body first. He didn't realize this action severed the demonic spirit's last hope, provoking its most desperate act.</p><p>Qing Hu Shengwang appeared to Hui Guang Shengzhe's left, her jade fingers flicking.  Thunderous waves echoed through the mountain's interior, as if an ocean was being poured in, creating a terrifying storm.  Her gaze fell upon the scene below, her eyes gradually turning pure white, devoid of pupils.  Her gaze, eerie and unsettling, pierced the chaos.</p><p>"Something's not right," Qing Hu Shengwang said, her brows furrowed. She understood the situation, having some idea of the demonic body's origin and condition.  The demonic body clearly controlled the five-colored crown now. If the spirit within had been subdued by the ancient demon, they faced a far greater threat than just the ancient demon itself—a massive problem!</p><p>No wonder Hui Guang Shengzhe was so preoccupied.  He'd used coercion and persuasion to keep those human Yuan Ying cultivators there.</p><p>Considering various possibilities, Hui Guang Shengzhe divided his attention, simultaneously trying to prevent the demonic body's escape. The strain on his mental energy in this short time was immense.</p><p>Having recovered slightly, Hui Guang Shengzhe was about to speak when a sudden change occurred within the mountain.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and the Demon Child had merged into a demonic soul within the demonic body, only to be forcibly swallowed by the demonic spirit—essentially the demonic spirit consuming both of them.  Although they'd lost the ability to resist, the critical aspect was that this consumption occurred within the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound.</p><p>A terrible shriek echoed through the mountain, piercing and sharp, like needles stabbing into the eardrums of Fan Lao Mo and the others. Their minds seemed to be pierced as well, causing them pain.  Everyone awoke from their meditative state, staring in horror at the mountain's depths, hearing Qing Hu Shengwang's warning at the same time: "Careful!"</p><p>Before the words left her mouth, a five-colored pillar of light shot from the mountain's depths, like a sword, a rainbow piercing the air. Sensing the terrifying destructive power of the rainbow light, everyone's faces paled.</p><p>'Whoosh whoosh whoosh...'</p><p>Everyone leaped into the air.</p><p>The next moment, cultivators outside the mountain heard a thunderous explosion and saw the mouth of Di Shou Mountain's peak explode, sending rocks flying. The entire ancient mansion shook violently.</p><p>Instead of magma, an endless torrent of water erupted from the mountain's mouth, like an inverted waterfall.  A beautiful rainbow surged out with the water.</p><p>This sight held no beauty; everyone felt the terrifying demonic energy. Even those far from Di Shou Mountain involuntarily trembled.</p><p>On the edge of Jin Xiang Dian.</p><p>The old nun's emotions swung wildly. First, she saw Zi Lei Zhenren's failed tribulation; before she could breathe a sigh of relief, she saw several Nascent Soul cultivators appear, shocking her.</p><p>The nuns of Yan Yue An were still searching Jin Xiang Dian and couldn't retreat quickly.  Then, demonic energy filled the sky, and more unexpected events unfolded.</p><p>The old nun couldn't tell if the situation was good or bad; at least two Nascent Soul cultivators were occupied, giving them breathing room.</p><p>Elsewhere, Bai Xiao led his demonic followers, seeing Di Shou Mountain's spectacle from afar and feeling immense fear.  However, the Shengwang's orders came first, forcing him to press on, though he secretly slowed his pace to observe.</p><p>No one outside felt the situation as clearly as Fan Lao Mo and the others.  Qing Hu Shengwang's spirit jade had melted.  Vast waves formed a giant vortex in the sky.  Seeing the vortex's contents, they gasped.</p><p>A figure, wearing the five-element crown, hung in the air.  Undeniably, this was Zhu Wu Dao's demonic body.</p><p>However, using the word "person" to describe the current demonic body was difficult.  It was, precisely, a piece of flesh maintaining a humanoid form.</p><p>The demon's skin was cracked and swollen all over, its body covered in what looked like tumors.  These tumors burst open, revealing raw, bloody flesh and, in some places, even bone.  The sight was sickening.</p><p>The creature barely retained human form. Its head and features were distorted, more like grotesque lumps of flesh.  While a semblance of expression remained, it was one of intense pain and madness.</p><p>No one could imagine what Zhu Wu Dao had endured to become this.</p><p>Everyone stared, hearts sinking.</p><p>Was this a true ancient demon?</p><p>Was this the fate of those corrupted by demonic influence?</p><p>It was a thousand times more terrifying than any ancient text described.</p><p>A chill ran down their spines. They felt a wave of fear. If the Hui Guang Saint and the Qinghu Saint King hadn't arrived in time, they would have faced certain disaster; survival itself would have been questionable.</p><p>“Old monk, I don't want to become that kind of monster!”</p><p>declared the Qinghu Saint King, her voice serious.  She seemed to see her own future reflected in the demon's form.</p><p>Assimilation by the Heavenly Demon Sound was clearly more than just madness; it manifested physically.  Zi Lei Zhenren had perished from mental collapse before completing his Heart Demon Tribulation; otherwise, he too would have eventually become an indistinguishable mass of flesh and blood.</p><p>The demon, Mo Ling, had underestimated the Heavenly Demon Sound's power. Once the assimilation began, it was unstoppable. As it progressed, the demon's body and the Five Elements Crown became increasingly intertwined, boosting its power.  However, its resistance to the Heavenly Demon Sound weakened, and its consciousness gradually succumbed to madness.</p><p>Mo Ling's true form, the Five Elements Crown, remained, but it couldn't halt her descent into the abyss. The deeper the fusion, the stronger the Heavenly Demon Sound's influence, threatening to erase her intelligence completely.</p><p>Paradoxically, this process freed her from restraint and hesitation.  Her primal madness drove her to destroy everything in sight.</p><p>Mo Ling's state increasingly resembled the ferocious beasts of the Storm Belt.</p><p>Their simulated hunt was about to begin.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King, acutely aware of the demon's changes, repeated, “I don't want to become that kind of monster!”</p><p>Hui Guang Saint understood the implication.  They had to simultaneously fight the Heavenly Demon Sound, hindering their full strength.  With his injuries, he relied on the Qinghu Saint King to take the lead in combating the ancient demon.</p><p>But if the Qinghu Saint King expended too much energy, the Heavenly Demon Sound could exploit the weakness, leading her down the same path as the demon child.</p><p>Unlike Hui Guang, the Qinghu Saint King had no attachments to her sect. If the situation became untenable, she would undoubtedly withdraw to focus on finding a way to ascend.  Her own survival was paramount; the fate of the world and its inhabitants held little concern for her.  Besides, humanity would be the first to suffer.</p><p>“This demon may not need to be eliminated, but doesn't the Saint King want to extract information from this ancient demon?  I suspect the Heavenly Demon Sound might be connected to the Demon Lord sealed within the Immortal Palace. Now that the Immortal Palace has ascended, there's only one person who might know – this demon!”</p><p>Hui Guang Saint and Qinghu Saint King communicated through mental transmission.  “We don’t know why this ancient demon couldn’t resist the Heavenly Demon Sound’s erosion.  Capturing it alive to learn the cause of the Heavenly Dao's transformation will allow us to find a solution more effectively.”</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King understood all this, but the impact of the demon's form was overwhelming.</p><p>“Form the Zen Meditation Arhat Formation!”</p><p>Hui Guang Saint softly commanded, simultaneously sending several golden rays towards the others.</p><p>Each person received a golden ray, a Buddhist formation imprinted on their minds.</p><p>The Zen Meditation Arhat Formation was a Buddhist battle array.  Ganlu Chan Monastery possessed a complete set of the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation, perfectly suited for ancient demons.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn't present.</p><p>Hui Guang Saint and Qinghu Saint King had previously planned a hunt in the Storm Belt, requiring coordination between the Saint King Palace's celestial formation and the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation.  Hui Guang Saint had thus instructed Master Xingji to contact top experts from various Buddhist sects, splitting the Vajra Orb array components to allow them to study the formation in preparation for the hunt.</p><p>Master Xingji and others were still on their way; several were in secluded meditation at their respective sects and couldn’t arrive in time.</p><p>No one expected to need the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation now. The hunt hadn't even begun, yet they faced an ancient demon.</p><p>Even if Hui Guang Saint had brought the Vajra Subduing Demon Formation, it would likely be ineffective. Mastering a spiritual formation takes time, and these individuals, though powerful, weren't Buddhist disciples, making rapid mastery impossible.</p><p>A battle array was much simpler; they only needed to follow Hui Guang Saint's instructions.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The figures moved, and the formation was instantly complete.</p><p>Without further effort, a power emanated from Hui Guang Saint, imbuing each person with a radiant halo behind their head, resembling the protective deities from murals, majestic and serene.</p><p>The formation's completion boosted their morale.  However, looking at the demon, everyone secretly wondered if the two Divine Transformation cultivators intended to fight at full strength. Were they relying on them to defeat such a terrifying fiend?</p><p>How many would survive?</p>
