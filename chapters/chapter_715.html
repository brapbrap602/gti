<h1>Chapter 707: The Terrifying Great Demon</h1><p>Others haven't emerged yet.</p><p>No one knows what happened in the cave. If they can't make a decision quickly, they might not be able to escape when the time comes.</p><p>Qin Sang can't control the others.</p><p>In a hurry, Qin Sang glanced back.</p><p>The people on the white cloud immediately noticed Qin Sang's presence.  A figure suddenly separated, swiftly pursuing him.</p><p>"It's more than one person!"</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, without pausing, he flew at full speed.</p><p>The pursuer, seemingly noticing Qin Sang's exceptional escape technique, and given the initial distance between them, abandoned the chase.  A large-scale pursuit in the demon sea would easily attract monsters, and was clearly unwise.  After a brief chase, the person gave up.</p><p>But after the person returned to the white cloud, the cloud's speed dramatically increased.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't look back, escaping far away. Only after flying a considerable distance, and certain he wasn't being followed, did he quietly land on the water.</p><p>"Why is there still no movement there? Did they reach some kind of agreement, or were the people in the cave instantly killed?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked back into the distance, pondering to himself.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as this thought crossed his mind, an extremely dazzling sword light flashed from that direction, followed by an exceptionally sharp sword cry.</p><p>"Good! They're fighting!"</p><p>A smile appeared on Qin Sang's face.</p><p>"It's the man surnamed Lan…"</p><p>Qin Sang recognized the scholar's flying sword; the sword light was from him.  It seemed he encountered a strong enemy, and this strike was clearly his full power.</p><p>This person's swordsmanship was even stronger than Qin Sang's. Even without mastering Sword Qi Thunder, he wasn't far off.</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly shocked. This person had also been hiding his strength. Earlier, he had humbly asked Qin Sang several questions about swordsmanship, and Qin Sang hadn't detected anything unusual.  They were all crafty individuals.</p><p>Facing this sword strike, Qin Sang had to be fully prepared.</p><p>Then, suddenly, a buzzing sound, like a swarm of bees, overwhelmed the sword cry.</p><p>At the point where the sword light struck, a strange shadow appeared out of thin air.  It was unclear, but Qin Sang was certain it wasn't a human figure, but some kind of insect shadow.</p><p>"Insect control! It's a Witch Clan member! Someone is a traitor!  It seems the man surnamed Lan and these people aren't working together…"</p><p>Qin Sang hid his figure, flew to a high place to observe.  He could clearly see the sword light and insect shadow clashing in what appeared to be a evenly matched battle, with neither side gaining an advantage for now.</p><p>While observing, Qin Sang opened the skinny old man's pouch, his spiritual sense quickly scanning the items inside.  His expression suddenly changed.</p><p>A bone, as thick as an adult's thigh and ten feet long, jumped out of the pouch.</p><p>"A great demon's bone, it has the same aura as the animal hide!"</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the bone and found it lacked any luster, devoid of spirituality, and extremely brittle.  Clearly, like the animal hide, it had been completely corroded.</p><p>"This person and the stout cultivator are indeed in cahoots. Besides the bone, there are no other treasures worth mentioning in the pouch. It seems they only found some junk in the cave. Perhaps they emptied their savings to open the Nascent Soul cultivator's cave, only to find the treasures corroded by the cold mist.  The huge disappointment led to evil intentions, using this place as bait to lure people in and kill them to recoup their losses?"</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, "Or is there some treasure hidden deep within the cave, sealed away and requiring a specific condition to open? I should capture someone and ask."</p><p>The waves there were monstrous, the battle intense, and even from high altitude, the island was obscured. The shockwaves from the clash of True Essence were frequent and fierce.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang noticed the battlefield was shifting, one side seemed to be retreating, perhaps trying to escape.</p><p>"They haven't been able to subdue the man surnamed Lan for so long. It seems my guess was right.  Although the skinny old man's accomplice uses a strange white cloud with amazing speed, their strength is limited. If I go back now, instantly killing one of them would easily turn the tide."</p><p>Qin Sang felt confident, but also hesitated, uncertain if these people were pretending to lure him back.</p><p>"Even if the newcomer is extremely strong, it's impossible to think of this method to attract me back so quickly.  Such a loud commotion might attract a great demon, which would be counterproductive. Besides, I didn't use my full strength just now.  With Sword Qi Thunder, they wouldn't be able to catch up even if they pursued relentlessly.  In a contest of True Essence, I have the Corpse Pill and am not afraid."</p><p>Qin Sang decided to quietly approach and take a look.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as he flew back a short distance, a sudden, inexplicable sense of danger washed over him.  His hair stood on end, as if a terrifying presence were approaching.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped abruptly, turning his head sharply, his face a mixture of surprise and uncertainty.</p><p>The next moment, he saw waves suddenly rising on the sea to his left.  Beneath the waves, a huge black shadow, neither entirely serpent nor fish, slowly emerged from the depths.</p><p>At the sight of this shadow, Qin Sang's scalp tingled. It was likely a late-stage demonic beast!</p><p>This sea area actually hid such a terrifying creature.  It might have been asleep, awakened by the battle, and now it was certainly going to attack!</p><p>Fortunately, the demonic beast was distracted by the battle ahead and hadn't noticed Qin Sang, who was closer.</p><p>Qin Sang held his breath, slowly retreating.  The battle raged on, and no one noticed a terrifying shadow rapidly approaching beneath the waves.  The crisis was imminent!</p><p>After putting some distance between himself and the battle, Qin Sang turned and fled, not looking back.  Treasures, spirit flames—he abandoned everything.</p><p>Against a demonic beast of this power, there could be no hope of survival. Others were on their own.</p><p>“Crash!”</p><p>Not long after he began his escape, Qin Sang heard a deafening roar of water.  He looked back in alarm to see a white line appearing on the sea behind him, a wall of water, several tens of feet high, pursuing him relentlessly.</p><p>He vaguely heard an extremely shrill scream.</p><p>Qin Sang ascended, seeing only a boundless expanse of white waves. A colossal beast was rolling in the waves, seemingly playing, while the cultivators were completely swallowed by the surf, lost to sight.</p><p>Even the island itself seemed to tremble amidst the monstrous waves the beast was creating.</p><p>So many cultivators against one beast, seemingly without any means of fighting back.  He wondered how many could possibly escape with their lives.</p><p>As dusk approached, Qin Sang fled, chasing the setting sun, his resolve unshaken.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the battle wouldn't last much longer, but he dared not hesitate.  Once the beast was finished with the others, he would be next.</p><p>He didn't stop running until the battlefield was out of sight. The waves from the battle still reached the sea below him, though much weaker.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang thought the battle was over, a thunderous roar exploded behind him!</p>
