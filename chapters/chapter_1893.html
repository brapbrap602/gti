<h1>Chapter 1884: The God of Time</h1><p>Qin Sang turned his head, seeing darkness encroaching from behind, a gaze sharp as a sword shooting from the gloom.</p><p>Meeting that malicious gaze, Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  A chill enveloped him, instinctively triggering a tremor, worse than when he faced the Spirit Nether King.</p><p>Though the Spirit Nether King was powerful, their cultivation realms were roughly comparable.  Now, he faced a true Demon King, a Void Refinement stage expert!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Black feathers rippled on the wings of the black roc, like black celestial fire, incinerating everything!</p><p>The celestial fire spread towards Qin Sang with astonishing speed. With a single flap of its wings, the roc traversed vast swathes of the cloud sea.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind raced.  This roc, completely ignoring other areas, had made a beeline for him upon entering the Divine Court.</p><p>‘Roar! Roar!’</p><p>Deafening dragon roars echoed, but upon closer inspection, held less defiance.</p><p>Initially, when the golden dragon flew towards the Western Seven Mansions, it would frequently look back at the Three Enclosures with reluctance.  Now, it obeyed Qin Sang's commands.</p><p>Qin Sang's manipulation of the Sky-Patrolling Chariot grew increasingly adept.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Sky-Patrolling Chariot pierced through clouds and mist, leaving behind a dazzling golden rainbow.</p><p>Qin Sang narrowed his eyes, calming his racing thoughts, sensing the chariot, probing its remaining powers.</p><p>Simultaneously, a sliver of his consciousness remained fixed on the black roc behind.</p><p>Qin Sang knew his limits. Even pushing his Thunder Escape technique to its peak, he couldn't escape the roc.  His only hope lay in the Sky-Patrolling Chariot being as powerful as Heavenly Voyager Shang had claimed.</p><p>Indeed, the chariot proved to be no ordinary treasure.</p><p>Before entering the Divine Court, it had seemingly ascended to the Lunar Palace and reached the Immortal阙 in the blink of an eye. Its traversing speed was immeasurable.</p><p>Though these were mere illusions brought on by the chariot passing through the Divine Court's barrier, its true speed was also extraordinary.</p><p>Unless the black roc had strength to spare, catching Qin Sang wouldn't be easy.</p><p>With the chariot, he might be able to contend with the Demon King for a while. The problem was, Qin Sang was completely ignorant of the outside world, unaware of how much farther he had to flee before dawn arrived.</p><p>He had only managed a preliminary restoration of the Sky-Patrolling Chariot. The treasure was not fully recovered.  How long could it last?</p><p>Between life and death, fear of the unknown loomed large.</p><p>Someone with weaker willpower, under such terrifying pressure, might have already been on the verge of collapse.</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>Staring at the fleeing chariot, the black roc snorted, its feathers bristling with a rustling sound.</p><p>The sound intensified, quickly resembling a howling gale.</p><p>A true wind arose. Black smoke emanated from the roc, transforming into a demonic wind of immense power.</p><p>The demonic wind raged across the cloud sea, following the roc's flight.</p><p>At the edges of the demonic wind, the black smoke gradually faded, merging with the surrounding cloud sea.</p><p>Then, with a sharp shriek, the black roc’s speed surged, rapidly closing the distance.</p><p>This maneuver allowed the roc to connect with the Divine Court, borrowing its power to some extent, a feat only possible due to its status as a Demon God.</p><p>Qin Sang was horrified.  The situation was worse than anticipated.  If the black roc maintained this speed, it would catch him quickly!</p><p>In truth, being newly arrived in the Divine Court, the black roc couldn't maintain this state indefinitely. However, as it grew more familiar with the Divine Court, the situation would become increasingly unfavorable for Qin Sang.</p><p>The demonic wind howled behind him.</p><p>Qin Sang drove the chariot with all his might.  Dragon roars shook the heavens, yet couldn't stop the powerful enemy's relentless pursuit.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The golden rainbow passed between two immortal mountains.  Atop each stood a golden palace, now collapsed and dilapidated.</p><p>Ahead, the Western White Tiger's Seven Mansions were in sight.</p><p>But even if he escaped into the Western Seven Mansions, what then?</p><p>Qin Sang diverted part of his mind to sense the Divine Court's Celestial Star Grand Formation. It shared similarities with the Seven Mansions Starfield Sword Formation, but this connection was insufficient to allow him to control the Divine Court.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>An unusual sound of something ripping through the air came from behind.</p><p>Alarm bells rang in Qin Sang's mind. The Oracle Butterfly's warning came simultaneously, an image flashing into his consciousness.</p><p>A mass of black demonic wind had gathered behind him, swirling cloud qi into dark clouds high in the sky.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A clap of thunder.</p><p>Lightning shot out from the dark clouds—a black demonic lightning bolt, violently erratic, striking down.</p><p>Qin Sang had no intention of directly confronting the demonic lightning.  With a thought, the golden dragon veered sharply, the chariot tracing an arc through the clouds.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The demonic lightning struck the cloud sea, barely missing the chariot.</p><p>Qin Sang could clearly feel the terrifying power contained within.</p><p>As one demonic lightning bolt missed, the dark clouds churned, immediately birthing another.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Demoniac lightning bolts struck down one after another.</p><p>While Qin Sang evaded, the black roc swiftly closed the distance.</p><p>Amidst the birth and death of lightning, silver light flickered within the depths of the dark clouds, faintly revealing a circular ancient mirror.</p><p>“So it’s a spiritual treasure…”</p><p>The thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind as he dodged, and his heart stirred.</p><p>Against spiritual treasures, the Blood Defiling Divine Light was still effective.</p><p>However, in the current situation, he dared not stop to counterattack. He could only endure for now, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>But the enemy gave him no respite. After closing the distance, the black roc attacked again.</p><p>It abruptly soared upwards, its roar like thunder, its momentum building with each ascent.  Fully charged, it dove from the heights.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the light around him dimming.  A fierce wind whipped around the chariot, immense pressure descending from above.</p><p>The sky above the chariot plunged into complete darkness, as if covered by a canopy of dark clouds. Masses of visible black demonic wind joined together, blotting out the sun.</p><p>The Sky-Patrolling Chariot traversed the wind alone, giving a sense of utter isolation.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The demonic wind surged.</p><p>A terrifying hurricane pressed down, stretching as far as the eye could see.  The chariot was at its center, unable to escape its reach no matter which direction it fled.</p><p>Qin Sang truly grasped the roc’s power. It was even more terrifying than the Demon King Dharma Image that had nearly captured him outside the Healing Platform.</p><p>Now, escape was impossible!</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm in the face of danger. With a powerful jerk of the reins, the chariot's forward momentum ceased abruptly.</p><p>The golden dragon stopped its charge, raised its head, and let out a roar even louder than before.</p><p>The black roc behind narrowed its eyes, sensing something amiss.  It hurriedly urged the Thunder Mirror, unleashing several demonic lightning bolts.</p><p>Just as the demonic wind was about to engulf the chariot, the golden dragon’s scales shimmered, erupting in blinding golden light that enveloped the entire chariot.</p><p>The chariot was swallowed by the demonic wind, the golden light instantly vanishing, and the chariot disappeared into thin air!</p><p>The next moment, golden light flashed outside the hurricane.</p><p>The black roc’s expression changed drastically.  It abruptly turned its head, seeing the chariot reappear within the golden light, the golden dragon pulling it and Qin Sang upon the jade throne completely unharmed.</p><p>The Sky-Patrolling Chariot could traverse the void, possessing the ability to teleport!</p><p>‘Snap!’</p><p>The reins tightened. The golden dragon, without looking back, continued to pull the chariot forward.</p><p>Qin Sang let out a slow breath, still shaken by the pressure he'd just faced.</p><p>Teleportation was a divine ability he had gleaned from the chariot.</p><p>In reality, the chariot itself could not teleport.  Rather, it leveraged its close connection with the Divine Court to ‘leap’ within a certain range.</p><p>However, this came at a cost.</p><p>‘Crack! Crack!’</p><p>Qin Sang heard faint sounds coming from the chariot beneath him.</p><p>His greatest fear had materialized. Teleportation placed a heavy burden on the chariot. His repairs were too crude. Each teleport caused damage, accumulating with each use. He didn't know how many more it could withstand.</p><p>The only consolation was that urging the chariot didn't consume much of his own power.</p><p>The demonic wind howled behind.  The black roc, regrouping, pursued him again.</p><p>Each teleport had to be used at the most critical moment.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang felt movement within his sleeve.</p><p>“We’re doomed! We’re doomed!”</p><p>Crimson fire flickered from his sleeve, accompanied by the Vermillion Bird fledgling’s shrieks. “Ah! Ah! Ah! Why are you being chased again!”</p><p>Qin Sang thought these words sounded familiar, as if someone else had said them before.</p><p>He was also quite helpless. It had started as an ordinary refining session. Who could have foreseen such a massive upheaval?</p><p>“Do you have any good ideas?”</p><p>Seemingly at his wit’s end, Qin Sang sought help from the Vermillion Bird fledgling.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird fledgling was speechless, exasperated.</p><p>At most, it could currently control the nine Sun Divine Birds on the Divine Tree. Even all nine together likely couldn't harm the roc.</p><p>Should it release its Vermillion Bird aura, bluffing?</p><p>But the opponent was a Demon King. It would immediately see through the charade.</p><p>Seeing the Vermillion Bird fledgling’s continued silence, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.  He could only rely on himself.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Demoniac lightning rained down, bombarding them relentlessly.</p><p>Bolt after bolt grazed the chariot, each a near miss.</p><p>They fled frantically under the barrage, relying on the golden dragon's extraordinary speed and agility, and Qin Sang's precise judgment, they remained unharmed for now.</p><p>But this wouldn't last.  Once the black roc closed the distance and attacked again, Qin Sang would have to resort to teleportation.</p><p>Amidst the chase, Qin Sang entered the Western Seven Mansions, his expression quickly turning to disappointment.</p><p>As expected, even his mastery of the Seven Mansions Starfield Sword Formation offered little recourse.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Suddenly, a black rainbow descended from the sky.</p><p>The black rainbow appeared out of nowhere, without warning, its speed astonishing, locking onto the chariot.</p><p>It was unavoidable, only teleportation could save him.</p><p>Just then, the chariot was about to pass over an immortal mountain. Atop the mountain stood a golden palace.</p><p>The palace was intact, shimmering with spiritual light.</p><p>The spiritual light formed a barrier around the palace, emitting peculiar fluctuations.</p><p>“Go inside!”</p><p>The Vermillion Bird fledgling suddenly cried out.</p><p>“That is precisely my intention!”</p><p>Qin Sang flicked the reins. The golden dragon swooped down towards the golden palace, easily passing through the barrier.  Upon reaching the palace doors, it passed through as if they weren't there.</p><p>He had been observing these golden palaces for a long time. The barrier outside was a special kind of formation, but its fluctuations were similar to the golden dragon’s.</p><p>Now, as he attempted to enter, it proved to offer no resistance.</p><p>It remained to be seen whether the Demon God could pass through the spiritual light barrier and how strong it truly was.</p><p>Entering the golden palace, the first thing he saw was a divine statue.</p><p>Offerings were placed before the statue, but compared to mundane Daoist temples, this place lacked incense and the presence of worshippers.</p><p>The statue depicted a refined man, wearing a celestial crown, with a red face, golden armor, and black robes, holding a bow and arrow.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the plaque he had seen as he entered: ‘Gengchen Grand Time!’</p><p>As the name suggested, this palace was dedicated to the celestial deity, Gengchen, the God of Time.</p><p>In Daoist scriptures, Gengchen was one of the sixty Grand Gods of Time, also known as the Sixty Yuanchen.</p><p>The Sixty Grand Gods of Time were also stellar deities.</p><p>In the system of chronological reckoning, the ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches cycled through combinations, forming a sixty-year cycle, known as the Sexagenary Cycle, each year presided over by one of the sixty Grand Gods of Time.</p><p>Some believed that the Grand God of Time of one's birth year influenced their entire life, considering it their personal guardian deity.  There was also the saying of "offending the Grand God of Time" in the mortal world, hence the practice of worshipping the Grand God of Time for good fortune.</p><p>Of course, these were mere legends.</p><p>Gengchen, while one of the sixty Grand Gods of Time, was not the deity of legend.</p><p>Through his Divine Eye, Qin Sang could clearly see that Gengchen's body was not made of clay or wood, nor was it even physical. It was composed of countless talismanic characters, essentially a divine talisman.</p><p>Far more complex than ordinary talismans, it possessed a mystical aura not found in others, truly appearing like a deity.</p><p>This was what the Dao Court referred to as a ‘Celestial Deity,’ a Talisman God born from the deduction of the Dao of Talismans!</p><p>Gengchen's eyes were wide open, as if staring at Qin Sang, this uninvited guest, exuding an aura of authority, though clearly without sentience.</p><p>“The God of Time…”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the Myriad Gods Thunder Division Immortal Guide he had obtained.</p><p>The Dao Court’s Division of Battles also had corresponding Immortal Guides.</p><p>Based on what Qin Sang knew, the status of the Sixty Grand Gods of Time shouldn’t be high. Daoists of Qi Refinement and Foundation Establishment stages could invite them to be guardian deities for their altars through their cultivation techniques.</p><p>“Can the God of Time’s temple withstand a blow from a Demon King?”</p><p>Qin Sang felt apprehensive as he looked out of the palace.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black rainbow struck, hitting the palace directly.</p><p>The palace and the immortal mountain trembled violently, erupting with intense spiritual light.</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>The black rainbow almost swallowed the palace whole.</p><p>The spiritual light barrier teetered, stubbornly resisting the black rainbow, refusing to be instantly destroyed.</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up with surprise.  It seemed the power of the spiritual light barrier wasn’t completely tied to the Talisman God's status.</p><p>“I wonder if the spiritual light barrier of a higher-status Talisman God’s temple would be stronger. If it could block the roc…”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang’s mind as he sensed the black rainbow outside frantically assaulting the spiritual light barrier, accompanied by the relentless bombardment of demonic lightning.</p><p>It appeared the black roc was at a loss against the spiritual light barrier, resorting to brute force.</p><p>The Demon King's power was truly formidable.  The palace shook violently. The spiritual light barrier wouldn’t hold much longer.</p><p>Just then, a sword light shot out from within the palace, its sword momentum shaking the heavens, slashing towards the void.</p><p>That was where the demonic lightning originated, where the Thunder Mirror resided.</p><p>A disdainful glint flashed in the black roc's eyes.  As it rapidly approached, it remotely urged the Thunder Mirror, unleashing a mass of ink-black demonic lightning to devour the sword light.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sword light didn’t clash head-on with the demonic lightning.  It abruptly stopped, revealing a spiritual sword, which emitted a burst of blood-colored light instead of sword energy.</p><p>The black roc sensed danger, but it was too late to recall its spiritual treasure. Struck by the Blood Defiling Divine Light, its treasure’s light dimmed.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't linger.  He recalled his sword, taking advantage of the weakened black rainbow to charge out with all his might, continuing his escape.</p><p>He knew clearly that a Demon King wouldn’t have only one spiritual treasure.  This action might not have much effect, but he had to do everything he could to weaken the enemy, even if it only marginally increased his chances of survival.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
