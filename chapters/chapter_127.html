<h1>**Chapter 120**</h1><p>**Slaughter Formation**</p><p>The demonic cultivation method shouldn't be helpful for Foundation Establishment, otherwise Gu Tiannan would have succeeded long ago.</p><p>Based on Gu Tiannan's reckless appearance in battle, the hidden danger might not be minor after all. Not only had he lost his mind, but his body might also undergo some kind of transformation.</p><p>However, details could only be determined after seeing the demonic cultivation method.</p><p>Initially, he only needed to hold Gu Tiannan off and invite some helpers from the sect. Then, defeating Gu Tiannan and his disciple would be easy. The black-robed youth was unwilling to kill, leaving a huge loophole. With Gu Tiannan's caution, he couldn't possibly have overlooked such a flaw.</p><p>Perhaps only a person with the black-robed youth's temperament could resist the demonic cultivation method's temptation and live his entire life to avenge his family.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and said to the white cat, "You...."</p><p>His words got stuck in his throat. He suddenly remembered that he had yet to ask the white cat her name.</p><p>Yet, the white cat was clever and immediately replied, "Master, my previous owner named me Little White when I was young."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and said, "Little White, my last name is Qin. You don't have to call yourself as a slave either. Just use 'I'."</p><p>The white cat lowered her head in embarrassment and said in shame, "Slave... I mean I, after I opened my mind, I eavesdropped on the women of a notable family and learned that they all called themselves this way. Later, I stayed in seclusion in the mountains and trained there, losing touch with the world. Please excuse me, Master Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and said, "Don't worry about it. Getting back to the main topic, if I asked you to take on Gu Yuan alone, could you stop him?"</p><p>The white cat answered seriously, "Honesty, Master Qin, my bamboo staff emits a green light that has the Yin and Yang transporting effect. It can only be used to flee or confuse people. At most, I can stall Gu Yuan for a while. Other than that, I don't have any other methods. There is no way that I can defeat him. Master Qin, are you planning to do it yourself?"</p><p>"That's enough. Bring all these people back to the cave first."</p><p>Qin Sang waited for the white cat to put the people inside. Seeing that Gu Tiannan and his disciple had not returned yet, he discussed a plan with the white cat.</p><p>He was confident and fearless against Gu Tiannan. Despite being powerful after his transformation, Gu Tiannan's mind would be affected after taking on the form of the monster. This would mean more weak points. As long as he planned carefully, defeating Gu Tiannan wouldn't be difficult.</p><p>....</p><p>The white cat withdrew the green light and slipped back into the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang meditated in place for a moment. Gu Tiannan and his disciple arrived late and did not suspect anything when they saw the battlefield that Qin Sang had intentionally messed up.</p><p>A hint of disappointment flashed through Gu Yuan's eyes.</p><p>Gu Tiannan, in contrast, looked as usual and said, "Junior Brother Qin, I have already killed the demon. That cat demon must have been run off by Junior Brother Qin as well?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked slightly exhausted, but he spoke with great anger, "That cat demon's techniques are too strange. I almost cut off its head with a single sword strike but it managed to escape. Right now, it's inside the cave. Senior Brother Gu, you've come just in time. You and I will attack it together. That monster must die today without a burial site!"</p><p>Gu Yuan suddenly smiled and joined in, "Uncle Qin, don't take it to heart. That cat demon has some abilities and is very slippery. My master and I have let it escape several times. As long as Uncle Qin could stall it this long, that's already very impressive. Now that the three of us will join forces, it will definitely not be able to run away."</p><p>As he spoke, Gu Yuan looked at Gu Tiannan and sent a secret signal to him. Gu Tiannan hesitated, but he nodded in agreement.</p><p>The three rested for a while before entering the cave.</p><p>Gu Tiannan led the way in front, while Qin Sang followed behind. He was on high alert, and his palms secretly gripped several spiritual talismans.</p><p>Although Qin Sang had agreed to cooperate with the white cat, he did not fully trust her. He was always vigilant. He could also sense that the cat demon had been keeping a distance from him, also guarding against him turning hostile.</p><p>Fortunately, the three each held their magical artifacts and went deep into the cave. Just as they reached a corner, the white cat showed up as expected.</p><p>The dark azure light instantly enveloped the three. Then, several angry shouts were heard and the azure light suddenly dispersed. However, Gu Yuan had disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Gu Tiannan called out to him several times. His voice reverberated in the cave, but there was no response from Gu Yuan. As he was about to use a body technique to pursue him deeper into the cave, Qin Sang suddenly got in his way with a flash.</p><p>Gu Tiannan's body suddenly paused, and he looked at Qin Sang with surprise. He asked in a severe voice, "Junior Brother Qin, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Senior Brother Gu, stop being stubborn. It's not too late to turn back. If you're willing to tie yourself up and come with me to the sect to admit your crimes, I won't make things difficult for you."</p><p>"I don't know what you're talking about!"</p><p>Gu Tiannan's eyes suddenly opened wide and stared at Qin Sang fiercely. "Junior Brother Qin, have you fallen under the influence of a demon's charm that you don't recognize your fellow senior brother anymore?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, "Bloodheart Pill... Senior Brother, you intentionally spread the demonic cultivation method, bringing disaster to the world. Do you still want to deny it?"</p><p>Gu Tiannan's expression changed drastically, and he exclaimed, "How did you know?"</p><p>"If you don't want people to know, then don't do it.</p><p>"Qinsang looked at Gu Tiannan with a sincere face and said, "Gu, you're just confused, have gone astray, and it's not necessarily an unforgivable crime, you can still change path."</p><p>Gu Tiannan sneered and said, "Qinsang, do you think I'm a three-year-old child? Once I fell into the hands of those people, will I still survive? What about the magic art? I haven't killed anyone myself, I only killed those murderous fiends who cannot resist temptation! The people in Shaohua Mountain call themselves orthodox, which one of them has fewer lives on their hands than me?"</p><p>Then, Gu Tiannan suddenly changed his tone, full of temptation: "Qinsang, this art is very powerful, not only can it improve your cultivation level, but it can also greatly increase your chance of breaking through the foundation building stage. It's only because I am too old with a decaying body that I have not succeeded. Qinsang, as long as you let me go, I'll give you this art, and I guarantee that I will immediately leave for a faraway place, change my name and surname, and absolutely no one else will know."</p><p>Hearing this, Qinsang looked surprised and asked anxiously, "Can it increase the chance of breaking through the foundation building stage?"</p><p>"Absolutely! I will give you the art now, and you'll know after you read it!"</p><p>Gu Tiannan lowered his head, pretending to fetch something from his mustard seed pouch, but his gaze flickered sharply and he suddenly let out a low growl, shooting out like a sharp arrow.</p><p>At this moment, his true cultivation level has been revealed!</p><p>"You're looking for death!"</p><p>Gu Tiannan roared like an inhuman monster, with a hint of frenzy in his eyes, his face full of bloodthirsty malice, his palms turned into knives, and lightning-fast stabbed towards Qinsang.</p><p>Just then, a green light flashed in front of Qinsang, and the ebony sword shot out.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Gu Tiannan's physical palm collided with the ebony sword, but it was not cut off by the sword energy.</p><p>Qinsang had never seen his flesh this strong.</p><p>"Qinsang, I really underestimated you, what an excellent spiritual sword!"</p><p>Gu Tiannan shook his hand, licked his lips, and looked at the ebony sword. Not only was he not afraid, but he did not hide the greed in his eyes.</p><p>Qinsang floated back, waved his hand, and six rays of black light landed around Gu Tiannan as he retreated. They then turned into six giant flag banners, surrounding Gu Tiannan.</p><p>The flag banners were as tall as a person, filled with a gust of yin energy, and evil ghosts howled with eerie roars.</p><p>As Qinsang's thoughts moved, a surge of strong yin energy erupted from the banners and surrounded Gu Tiannan, forming the Ten Directions Yama Formation!</p>
