<h1>Chapter 823: External Avatar</h1><p>Chapter 823: External Avatar</p><p>As that person said.</p><p>Qin Sang encountered several patrol teams along the way.</p><p>Sensing danger, he was very careful, avoiding them, and finally left the Liefeng Islands.  He remained cautious until he was out of the Southwest Sea area, then released his two-headed… beast.</p><p>…</p><p>Blue sea and blue sky.</p><p>Midday, the sun hung high.</p><p>The sky was cloudless, and there was not a breath of wind on the sea; it was extremely muggy.</p><p>A large dragon-headed ship sailed alone.  At the bow, tamed sea beasts—not demonic beasts, but huge and powerful—were secured by ropes.</p><p>They cut through the waves, pulling the ship forward at high speed.</p><p>Compared to the vast ocean, the dragon-headed ship seemed tiny.</p><p>The ship was laden with cargo. Crewmen, all ordinary people, bustled about on deck.</p><p>The sea was calm, the crew grumbled about the heat, but no one dared to speak loudly, their eyes glancing towards the cabin with reverence.</p><p>Everything seemed peaceful.</p><p>Suddenly, the ship lurched violently.</p><p>The crew members cried out in alarm, falling this way and that, discovering that one of the sea beasts pulling the ship was struggling wildly, trying to break free of its bonds.</p><p>The beast was several zhang long and incredibly strong, causing the ship to sway wildly.</p><p>These beasts had been tamed since birth, and had served with distinction, never causing trouble before.  No one knew what was happening today.</p><p>Confused, the crewmen grabbed at anything nearby, seeing the cargo shifting violently, and began to shout loudly.</p><p>At this moment, the ship's owner rushed out of the cabin, shouting, “Quick! Find out what’s wrong! Sound the conch to calm them!”</p><p>The crew rushed to the bow, one of them taking a conch and blowing it with all his might.</p><p>The conch was a tool for taming the beasts.  Usually, when the beasts became agitated, the sound of the conch would calm them down.  This time, however, it had no effect. The beast seemed not to hear, letting out earth-shattering roars, tinged with fear.</p><p>Furthermore, other sea beasts showed signs of agitation.</p><p>It looked like things were about to descend into complete chaos.</p><p>Just as the ship's owner was filled with anxiety, a whistling sound came from the cabin, and several streaks of light shot to the bow, revealing five figures of extraordinary bearing.</p><p>“Esteemed masters, the sea beasts are agitated.  Could you please tame them?”</p><p>The ship's owner saw his saviors and ran to the masters, but was surprised to find that all five wore grave expressions, staring at the empty sea, as if searching for something.</p><p>He followed their gaze, but saw nothing.</p><p>“Cut the ropes!”</p><p>The oldest of the middle-aged masters suddenly shouted sharply.</p><p>The ship's owner was bewildered, but upon meeting the master's gaze, his heart leaped, realizing something was wrong. He immediately ordered the crew, “Quick! Do as the masters say!”</p><p>‘Bang bang bang…’</p><p>One rope after another was severed.</p><p>The sea beasts went wild. The taut ropes snapped with loud bangs as the beasts gained their freedom and scattered in all directions.</p><p>The ship's owner's heart bled.</p><p>But soon he forgot his loss, overtaken by terror.</p><p>The fastest beast, after running a short distance, saw a dense cloud of bubbles rising from the water ahead.  Then, the beast was violently dragged underwater by some unseen force and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, crimson blood welled up from the depths, staining a large area of the sea, a shocking sight.</p><p>Then, another disappeared.</p><p>Such large sea beasts, vanished without even a ripple, swallowed whole by some terrifying creature, unseen by those on board. Terror gripped everyone on the ship.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator’s expression darkened, exclaiming, “It's a demonic beast, a bluefin shark! Turn back, go back!”</p><p>The ship's owner was terrified, “A demonic beast… how could such a powerful demonic beast be here…?”</p><p>The ship turned and fled.</p><p>Behind them, the sea beasts were all hunted down, one by one. The bluefin shark never surfaced, but the entire sea was dyed red, a horrifying spectacle.</p><p>But before they could breathe a sigh of relief, they noticed a dense cluster of bubbles rapidly approaching from behind.</p><p>Including the cultivators, everyone panicked, only the middle-aged cultivator remaining relatively calm. He shouted, “Don't panic! We can't just wait to die!  Quickly help me form a formation!”</p><p>The other four were anxious and flustered, barely managing to form a battle array.</p><p>Everyone summoned their magical weapons, awaiting the middle-aged cultivator's command.  At his cry of ‘Attack!’, they unleashed their weapons indiscriminately.</p><p>In an instant, several rays of light of various colors shot into the water, striking the dense cluster of bubbles.</p><p>They hoped the monstrous beast would be killed or retreat.  </p><p>But things went awry.  The bubbles became denser, and a terrifying dark shadow slowly surfaced from the seabed.  To the horror of everyone, a bluefin shark appeared.  It had several wounds, but they were superficial and not fatal, only fueling its rage.</p><p>“No!  Get out of the way!”</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator shouted, but it was too late.</p><p>The bluefin shark opened its mouth wide, and a torrent of water erupted, transforming into countless water arrows that shot towards the people on the bow.</p><p>The middle-aged cultivator used his magic weapon for protection, but the other four were too slow.</p><p>One young man was too slow to react. A water arrow struck his abdomen, tearing a large hole, and he fell into the sea, lifeless.</p><p>“Xiaoning!”</p><p>Everyone cried out in grief, falling into despair.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the distance, a young man rode a two-headed beast at full speed.  Seated on the beast's back, he held a spirit stone, his eyes closed in meditation.</p><p>This person was Qin Sang, who had traveled a long way.</p><p>At this moment, he sensed the commotion in the distance, waking from his meditation. He murmured, “This is not far from Tianxing Island.  The surrounding islands are densely populated; it's the most prosperous area for humans.  Major demons are either eliminated or driven to other remote seas, but some inevitably slip through the net. It seems someone died. Conveniently, my demonic seed is fully developed. I can find a body to refine an external avatar…”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he patted the two-headed beast, ordering it to change course.</p><p>He had journeyed to the Liefeng Islands, leaving Tianxing Island years ago. The demonic seed had been cultivating within him, finally maturing recently. He was ready to begin refining an external avatar.</p><p>The body requirements weren't high—a low-level cultivator would suffice. The cultivation speed of the external avatar is related to the main body.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang saw a dilapidated ship being chased by a bluefin shark.</p><p>Only two low-level cultivators were struggling to survive, but they were on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The bluefin shark was clearly far stronger. It was toying with its opponents; dozens of corpses floated on the surface, ignored.</p><p>Qin Sang found the body of a cultivator, a young boy.</p><p>He recalled his two-headed beast, approached the bluefin shark invisibly, and pressed down gently. The bluefin shark struggled in vain, subdued and pulled under the water.</p><p>After killing the shark, Qin Sang went to the boy, confirming he was dead before transferring the demonic seed into his body.</p>
