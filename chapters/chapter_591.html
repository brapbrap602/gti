<h1>Chapter 584: Unfilial Disciple</h1><p>Qin Sang was initially skeptical, but time and again, the information extracted from Yu Hua proved correct, allowing him to ambush and kill the Priest of the Jade Robe, seizing his Golden Core.</p><p>He suspected Yu Hua held a secret, high-ranking position within the Kuiyin Sect, explaining his intimate knowledge of the Priest of the Jade Robe.</p><p>At the time, Yu Hua's primordial spirit was sealed by the Corpse Talisman, and the three Golden Core cultivators of the Kuiyin Sect were dead, preventing verification.</p><p>Now it seems this was all Yi Tiannie's doing.</p><p>Yi Tiannie was the Priest of the Jade Robe's uncle, having raised him and knowing him intimately.  It's only natural he would understand the Priest so well.</p><p>The Priest of the Jade Robe's physical body was shattered, his Golden Core severely damaged; he barely escaped.</p><p>Yi Tiannie seemed to be little better.</p><p>The question remains: what was the relationship between Yi Tiannie and Yu Hua back then? Why didn't he contact the Priest of the Jade Robe, instead secretly investigating him?</p><p>Upon hearing the name 'Yu Hua,' Yi Tiannie flew into a rage.</p><p>"That treacherous disciple!  Back then, I barely escaped with my remnant soul, hiding within him. My lifespan was nearing its end, and I was severely injured.  Fortunately, I once obtained a ghost cultivation technique, allowing me to burn my soul, forgo reincarnation, and cultivate the path of ghosts, thereby extending my life.</p><p>"But that boy, with his ambitious heart, outwardly obeyed me, yet while I was cultivating the ghost path and weakened, he committed patricide and regicide, ambushing me and turning me into a wandering spirit.</p><p>"He then imprisoned my soul, treating me as a plaything, relentlessly abusing me and forcing me to reveal my secrets.</p><p>"I yearn to tear him limb from limb!</p><p>"I must thank you for killing that villain, freeing me from his grasp and avenging me. You even refined him into a living corpse, ensuring his eternal damnation!"</p><p>Qin Sang sneered, "His eternal damnation?  What about yours?"</p><p>He now understood how Yi Tiannie survived.</p><p>No one knows if reincarnation exists in this world, yet everyone clings to a sliver of hope, believing that Heaven might offer a lifeline in despair.</p><p>Ghost cultivation techniques are extremely strange and vicious.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's extended life, thanks to the ghost cultivation technique, came at a great cost and couldn't last.  Some not only lose the ability to possess others, but upon death, their soul is completely annihilated, just like Yu Hua!</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang suddenly realized why Yi Tiannie had remained hidden for so long before striking.</p><p>While controlled by Yu Hua, Yi Tiannie's soul must have been extremely weak; otherwise, with his late Golden Core cultivation, a hundred Yu Huas couldn't have suppressed him.</p><p>To easily control Yi Tiannie, Yu Hua would certainly have prevented his recovery.</p><p>I captured Yu Hua, unaware of Yi Tiannie's existence, allowing him to hide, secretly observing me.</p><p>Even weakened, Yi Tiannie's former cultivation base gave him a few concealment methods, easily masking himself from my senses.</p><p>After all, my cultivation was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage back then. Even with my current external Golden Core, my spiritual sense is still that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Combined with my lack of vigilance, I failed to notice Yi Tiannie's presence.</p><p>This allowed him to hide for decades.</p><p>Yi Tiannie possessed remarkable patience, enduring hardship and humiliation, only striking now.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed, a cold glint flashing.</p><p>He suddenly understood how Yi Tiannie gradually gained control of the Flying Night Rakshasa.</p><p>Yi Tiannie's injuries must have been extremely severe.  Even after all these years, he remained weak and only dared to attack me after seizing the Flying Night Rakshasa's body.</p><p>Before refining Yu Hua into the Flying Night Rakshasa, I kept Yu Hua by my side, never letting him out of my sight.</p><p>At that time, Yi Tiannie was only a wisp of a soul, at his weakest, unable to move or escape, forced to lie in wait for an opportunity.</p><p>He must have seized his chance during my battle with the Priest of the Jade Robe!</p><p>In that battle, to obtain the Golden Core, I didn't hesitate to cripple the Flying Night Rakshasa to kill the Priest.</p><p>No wonder the injured Flying Night Rakshasa was unexpectedly valiant, fighting the Priest to the death without prompting.  Yi Tiannie likely saw his opportunity and, risking exposure, secretly gave it a push.</p><p>The battle was too chaotic for me to notice, giving him his chance.</p><p>Only with the Flying Night Rakshasa severely injured and extremely weak could Yi Tiannie seize the opportunity, gradually taking over the body.  Otherwise, with his weak remnant soul, he couldn't have usurped it.</p><p>I placed the Flying Night Rakshasa in the Earth-Sinking Cave, allowing him to act without restraint.</p><p>By occupying this body, he could instantly regain his Golden Core strength, an opportunity he wouldn't miss.</p><p>No wonder Fei Tianye Cha's injuries hadn't healed in the year since the cave-in. Yi Tiannie had been secretly sabotaging his recovery, aiming to seize his body.</p><p>Qin Sang gasped.</p><p>Yi Tiannie had been lurking for decades, a venomous snake in the shadows, and she'd been completely oblivious.</p><p>She felt incredibly fortunate.</p><p>Fortunate that her soul mark, protected by the jade Buddha, was strong enough to resist Yi Tiannie's attempts to take control of Fei Tianye Cha.</p><p>Fortunate that she possessed a Xu Tian Lei, making him hesitant to act rashly.</p><p>Fortunate that her caution had led her to rarely visit the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid, especially avoiding it entirely while Yu Hua was with her.  Otherwise, that life-saving herb would have been stolen long ago!</p><p>Had Yi Tiannie, even after controlling Fei Tianye Cha's body, been eyeing this herb?</p><p>Fortunate that she'd refined an outer elixir, a fact unknown to Yi Tiannie.</p><p>Yi Tiannie surely hadn't anticipated that his attempts to hinder Fei Tianye Cha's recovery and seize control had caused him to miss her Corpse Pill refinement.</p><p>He'd chosen his moment well.  Yun Youzi was exhausted and unable to fight, she'd used her Xu Tian Lei, leaving her without means to threaten him, and the Ten Directions Yama Banner wasn't at hand.  There could be no better opportunity.</p><p>Without the Corpse Pill, she would have undoubtedly fallen to Yi Tiannie.</p><p>He didn't know she had achieved power comparable to a Golden Core cultivator â€“ this crucial piece of information led to his failure.</p><p>Fate, perhaps?</p><p>Unfazed by Qin Sang's mockery, Yi Tiannie said calmly, "If there is a next life, forgetting today's events would make me a different person. As long as I break through to Yuan Ying and live this life gloriously, reincarnation matters little. After my death, let the floodwaters rage!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed at the underlying meaning in Yi Tiannie's words.</p><p>"Qin Sang, after the great battle, Yu Hua searched everywhere for Zhao Yan, and of the five of you, only you survived. The Nine Illusions Sky Orchid must be in your possession, right? I risked my entire sect, only to make you a wedding gift!"</p><p>Yi Tiannie sneered, "Hand over the Nine Illusions Sky Orchid, or I'll crush the Crimson Cloud Purple Fruit and prevent you from forming your pill!"</p>
