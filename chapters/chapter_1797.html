<h1>Chapter 1788: The Fivefold Transformation</h1><p>The area above the altar where Shan Zhi resided was enveloped in auspicious clouds.  Within the swirling clouds, tribulation clouds were forming.  The thunder and the rumbling of the auspicious clouds blended together, making it hard to distinguish between the two.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, watching as the dark clouds parted the auspicious clouds, converging above him. Grey lightning crackled within, darkening the tribulation clouds further.</p><p>“Grey tribulation thunder!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s expression darkened.</p><p>As expected, Tian Mudie came from the same world as him and would also undergo the ascension tribulation. Tian Mudie possessed the ability to absorb tribulation thunder; if things turned critical, he could assist.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't worried about Tian Mudie’s safety, but he was concerned that the ascension tribulation being witnessed might attract unwanted attention.</p><p>He scanned his surroundings. The courtyard was large, enclosed on all sides by ancient seals—some kind of spirit array, though they couldn't locate its core.</p><p>The ancient array formed a golden curtain wall. While it didn't completely block the view, it made it difficult for outsiders to clearly see the courtyard's layout.</p><p>Four Nascent Soul cultivators had jointly opened a small gap to bring Qin Sang inside.</p><p>Using the pretext of helping the spirit insect through its tribulation, Qin Sang had set up a star yuan stone array to further isolate the courtyard.</p><p>The two arrays combined, while not completely blocking outside observation, did serve to confuse any onlookers.</p><p>After all, this was different from the outside world. Here, the tribulation clouds formed within the auspicious clouds, inextricably linked.  The colorful auspicious clouds cast a vibrant glow, overlaying the tribulation clouds, creating a dazzling spectacle with flashes of silver light. From a distance, it was nearly impossible to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>With a thought, Qin Sang poured all his energy into the star yuan stones, causing a brilliant starlight to erupt, reinforcing the surrounding seals to create a thick curtain of light.</p><p>However, this only masked the celestial phenomena.  The pressure and fluctuations from the tribulation were unavoidable and were gradually spreading.</p><p>Outside the courtyard.</p><p>Three True Masters had set up a killing array, remaining vigilant. They sensed the fluctuations of the tribulation and looked towards the courtyard.</p><p>They could vaguely see turbulent clouds and flashing lights above, a chaotic scene.</p><p>The pressure from the tribulation was stronger than they anticipated.</p><p>Even in this realm, fivefold transformation spirit insects were exceedingly rare.  Spirit insect cultivation was slow, and raising them was more difficult than training demonic soldiers.  Even orthodox Daoist disciples rarely chose spirit insects as their fighting force.</p><p>Few had ever witnessed a spirit insect undergoing a fivefold transformation tribulation.</p><p>The tribulation caused the auspicious clouds to churn, its intense fluctuations and pressure blending together to make it hard to discern. The three True Masters showed no change in expression, quickly redirecting their attention to their surroundings.</p><p>Due to the unique environment, only those nearby could see the celestial changes, but the fluctuations could be felt from afar.</p><p>Just then, the Sword Master solemnly declared, "Someone's coming!"</p><p>Two True Masters’ eyes narrowed as they followed the Sword Master's gaze towards the east.</p><p>All they could see were palaces and buildings, no sign of anyone.</p><p>Focusing their senses, they detected a subtle aura rapidly approaching, detected by their carefully laid warning array – clearly drawn by the tribulation.</p><p>The intruders were still some distance away; they couldn’t tell whether they were human or demon.</p><p>"Two of them!"</p><p>the Bamboo Grove Master stated gravely.</p><p>The three fell silent, concealing their auras, ready to activate the killing array.</p><p>Their opponents were not reckless; after a burst of speed, they slowed down near the courtyard, using concealment spells to cautiously approach.</p><p>By this time, Tian Mudie's tribulation had reached its final stage.</p><p>Qin Sang transformed into his spirit wood form, holding the Ding Zhen Pill, prepared to unleash his full power against anyone who dared to interfere with Tian Mudie's tribulation.</p><p>'Rumble…'</p><p>The spirit insect’s transformation tribulation consisted only of thunder tribulation—a unique advantage.</p><p>Grey thunder snakes converged, forming a vortex of lightning at the heart of the tribulation cloud, directly targeting Tian Mudie below.</p><p>Perhaps because its master was present, Tian Mudie showed no fear or anxiety. Its wings fluttered, radiating blue light like waves, actively meeting the tribulation cloud.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>A bolt of lightning struck from a clear sky.</p><p>Without a blinding flash, the courtyard was suddenly plunged into darkness.</p><p>The power of the thunder in the cloud was unleashed without warning, striking down; simultaneously, the tribulation cloud began to dissipate.</p><p>Just like when breaking through to the fourfold transformation, the fivefold transformation tribulation also consisted of only one thunder strike!</p><p>However, the power and scale of this thunder were unlike anything before, let alone this mutated ascension tribulation!</p><p>A massive grey lightning pillar erupted from the heart of the tribulation cloud, and amidst the swirling clouds, countless arcs of lightning fell like a torrential downpour, forming a dense net in the air.</p><p>All the lightning bolts targeted the Tianmu butterfly, converging towards the central column mid-flight.  Finally, like a torrent of heavenly thunder, they instantly engulfed their target!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was grave; she could vaguely see the butterfly's silhouette within the bolts.</p><p>Bathed in the thunder, the Tianmu butterfly's wings trembled violently. Its eyes, wide open, shot out two bolts of azure lightning.</p><p>The lightning struck the thunderbolts head-on. A violent thunderstorm scattered, reducing everything in the courtyard to dust.</p><p>Simultaneously, countless electrical arcs flickered within the Tianmu butterfly's eyes.</p><p>Compared to the overwhelming thunderbolts, these arcs seemed minuscule, yet they contained a strange power.  Touching some of the thunderbolts, they dyed them azure, before being absorbed by the butterfly.</p><p>At this point, the Tianmu butterfly might not be able to greatly assist Qin Sang in enduring the tribulation, but its ability to devour the thunderbolts allowed her to fearlessly face the heavenly tribulation, a feat unmatched by other spirit insects.</p><p>Throughout, the Tianmu butterfly never sent a plea for help.</p><p>The scattered thunderbolts were almost entirely consumed by the Tianmu butterfly, while its main body was significantly shattered by the two bolts of azure lightning.</p><p>A normal heavenly tribulation should be ending by now, but this was a grey thunderbolt tribulation, still fiercely powerful.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Bolt after bolt of azure lightning relentlessly struck the thunderbolts, yet failed to stop their advance. The Tianmu butterfly, unwavering, continuously flapped its wings, relentlessly battling the tribulation.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of anxiety.  She moved slightly, about to intervene.</p><p>Firstly, she worried about the Tianmu butterfly's safety. Secondly, she had received a warning from the Swordmaster; someone was approaching, ready for battle!</p><p>At that moment, the Tianmu butterfly made an unexpected move. It tightly closed its wings, seemingly giving up resistance.  Azure light flickered on its body, and the aura surrounding it rapidly solidified, forming an invisible, colorless membrane covering its entire body.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The remaining thunderbolts struck the membrane heavily.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. She flashed to the Tianmu butterfly's side, resisting the urge to interfere.</p><p>She saw that the moment the thunderbolts hit the membrane, they began to decompose layer by layer into countless electrical arcs from the point of contact, instantly losing their momentum.</p><p>The next moment, two bolts of lightning burst from the membrane, completely shattering the thunderbolts!</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly took to the air, unharmed. It flitted through the scattered electrical arcs, devouring the remaining dissipated energy.  Finally, shrinking to the size of an ordinary butterfly, it cheerfully circled Qin Sang, landing on his shoulder as if seeking praise.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Tianmu butterfly in surprise, guessing that the membrane was a new ability the butterfly had developed after its transformation.  Judging by its performance, it appeared to be a defensive ability.</p><p>Spirit insects cultivating abilities alone, except for some special groups, usually have fragile bodies. This had previously prevented Qin Sang from risking the Tianmu butterfly.</p><p>Breaking through to the fifth transformation, it finally mastered a defensive ability, making up for its biggest weakness.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a surge of joy, but there was no time to test the new ability's power; uninvited guests were approaching!</p><p>Glancing outward, Qin Sang immediately ordered the Tianmu butterfly to return to her dantian. Still thrilled by its transformation, the butterfly reluctantly flapped its wings a few times before flying back.</p><p>The courtyard's protective formation was difficult to enter but easy to leave. Qin Sang placed her hand on the light barrier; a flash of light, and she was outside, immediately leaping towards a narrow alleyway between two golden halls.</p><p>Five people were already there, facing off.</p><p>One side comprised three True Persons. The other group was an odd pairing: a white-haired Daoist and a young monk wearing a kasaya and sporting a shaved head.</p><p>The monk and Daoist, suddenly blocked by the three True Persons, were startled, their faces alert.</p><p>The three True Persons also looked surprised, exchanging glances.  Unexpectedly, they hadn't attracted the Demon Marquis, but two cultivators instead.</p><p>“It’s Zhang Zhenren and Venerable Zhenru.”</p><p>Gu Yun Zhenren bowed, recognizing them.</p><p>“Gu Yun Zhenren, Youhuang Zhenren, and this must be the Swordmaster!  Long admired, long admired!”</p><p>The white-haired Daoist, Zhang Zhenren, lightly waved his whisk and returned the bow.</p><p>All of them originated from Jushan, where cultivators of the level of True Person were rare. Even if they hadn’t interacted before, they had heard of each other.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren hailed from a sect outside Star Island's Immortal Lake, called Yiyu Sect. Venerable Zhenru's Jingtai Temple was near Yiyu Sect, a rare Buddhist lineage in this world.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang stopped nearby, slightly surprised by the scene, and took another look at the monk.</p><p>Two unexpected cultivators, both at the Transformation Stage, arrived.  The older Daoist was particularly noteworthy; Qin Sang realized he was at the mid-Transformation Stage, the highest cultivation level present.</p><p>His arrival drew everyone's attention.  Zhang Zhenren studied him for a moment and said, "This Daoist friend seems unfamiliar. Were you just undergoing a tribulation? It seems there's been a misunderstanding."</p><p>At this time, the Sword Master also transmitted a message, explaining the newcomers' identities.</p><p>"It's Zhang Zhenren and Venerable Zhenru! I am Qingfeng, my apologies! My apologies!" Qin Sang nodded and bowed in greeting.</p><p>As fellow human cultivators, a fight was out of the question.  Despite their numerical advantage, since they were all hunting the demon lords, no one wanted any complications.</p><p>The Sword Master interjected, "Were both Daoist friends summoned by the Daoist Decree as well?"</p><p>He got straight to the point.</p><p>With the diminishing returns at the Jushan altar, few people came here anymore.  Encountering them here was quite coincidental.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren paused before replying, "Venerable Zhenru wished to observe the divine powers of the great masters at Jushan altar a long time ago.  I happened to receive news from the Daoist Court and decided to invite the Venerable to come together. We arrived a short while ago and sensed the tribulation fluctuations, so we came to investigate. It seems that all of you are here for the same reason?"</p><p>With that explanation, the atmosphere relaxed considerably.</p><p>Youhuang Zhenren couldn't help but ask, "How long have you two been here? Have you discovered any trace of the demon lords?"</p><p>"No, otherwise we wouldn't be wandering around aimlessly," Zhang Zhenren shook his head slowly, pausing before adding, "Since we share the same goal, why don't we join forces? What do you think?"</p><p>Qin Sang and the others were not opposed to this; more people meant sharing the spoils, but also more opportunities.</p><p>"How does Zhang Zhenren propose we cooperate against the enemy?" The Sword Master asked on behalf of the group.</p><p>Zhang Zhenren looked towards the vast expanse of golden halls in the distance.  "This place is so vast, searching inch by inch, when will we find our target? By the time we find them, they may have already achieved their goals and left.  Why don't we split into two groups, leaving each other contact methods, and hunt the demons together upon discovering them?"</p><p>Upon hearing this, the four exchanged glances.  They had previously discussed searching separately.</p><p>However, they were unsure how many demon lords had infiltrated this place and worried about encountering a strong enemy alone, preferring to spend more time to be safe.</p><p>Although there were only two of them, Zhang Zhenren was a renowned expert with unpredictable abilities.</p><p>The Sword Master nodded, handing him a jade talisman, "Very well, if you two discover demons, activate this talisman, and I will know."</p><p>Zhang Zhenren readily accepted it and gave him a jade disc in return.</p><p>Afterwards, both sides pooled their findings.  With Qin Sang's group's search, and the area covered by Zhang Zhenren's group, more than half the golden halls had been explored.</p><p>After agreeing on the plan, everyone immediately split up.</p><p>The ambush failed.  Qin Sang and the others dismantled the killing formation and continued along their previous route.</p><p>Qin Sang expected some questioning, but the three were discerning and didn't inquire about the details of the spirit insect, much to his relief.</p><p>En route, Qin Sang focused part of his attention on his dantian, communicating with the Tianmu butterfly.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly was in excellent condition. After its advancement, its realm exceeded the limits of the altar, but showed no signs of mental confusion.</p><p>The transformed Tianmu butterfly showed no significant changes in appearance, but its intelligence had increased.  However, seamless communication with humans was still some way off, making Qin Sang sigh.</p><p>Even for spirit insects, free from the tribulation of the forty-nine days, the path of cultivation was arduous.</p><p>Without opportunities to test new abilities, the Tianmu butterfly was digesting the benefits of its transformation, familiarizing itself with its new abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled a scene from his tribulation, analyzing it silently. The tribulation thunder, condensed from the power of lightning, clearly fragmented upon contact with the light membrane, turning into electric arcs, greatly reducing its power and momentum.</p><p>This reminded Qin Sang of a legendary ability—the Innate Separating and Combining Divine Light!</p><p>Legend said this divine light could separate and combine all things.  Those with deep mastery could even reduce their opponent's abilities to their essential spiritual energy, easily breaking even previously unseen attacks.</p><p>The Tianmu butterfly's new ability was certainly not so overpowered, but its performance seemed to possess similar power.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang felt impatient.</p><p>It was the third day since the two teams split up when a tremendous explosion jolted Qin Sang awake.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>The four quickly flew to a high vantage point.  In front of them, a mass of fiery red clouds surged into the sky, causing the entire golden hall to tremble.</p><p>The next moment, a golden light shot out from the destroyed golden hall, flying towards the rear like lightning, disappearing into the Nine-Curve Star River in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Following this, figures vaguely emerged from the fiery clouds, also rushing into the Nine-Curve Star River, immediately causing the star river to tremble as its light shone intensely, surging towards the intruders.</p><p>"Demons!"</p><p>The Sword Master shouted, his figure flashing as he pursued. The other three followed closely behind.</p>
