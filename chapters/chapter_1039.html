<h1>Chapter 1331: The Treasure Pavilion</h1><p>Chapter 1331: The Treasure Pavilion</p><p>“Senior Brother! Sister Hong!”</p><p>Su Nu descended on a beam of light, landing on a sand dune.  She composed herself, putting on a smile.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you two to arrive first.”</p><p>Two figures landed before Su Nu.</p><p>One was an elder with a long beard, one of the two who had found her in the Xuanbing Plains.</p><p>The other was a woman, seemingly in her thirties, with a captivating and alluring presence.</p><p>Both had ample spiritual energy and calm expressions.  They were both late-stage Golden Core cultivators.  Working together, as long as they weren’t surrounded by a beast horde, their safety was largely assured.</p><p>Compared to them, Su Nu looked much worse for wear.  She had expended immense spiritual energy to reach the Treasure Pavilion before anyone else, forcing down injuries with pills, with no time for proper care.  Her clothes were scorched in several places, and her appearance was disheveled.</p><p>The two were incredibly surprised at her condition.</p><p>The elder with the long beard frowned.  “Junior Sister, why are you so badly injured? Did you encounter other cultivators?”  Su Nu’s injuries from the Xuanbing Plains were long healed. If she had focused on self-preservation and waited for the others, she shouldn't be in such a state.</p><p>The alluring woman pinched Su Nu’s cheek, giggling.  “Which handsome young man took a liking to our little Junior Sister and wouldn’t leave her alone? I always said, our little Junior Sister is so captivating. It’s a good thing the Alliance Leader was so foresighted in not letting her go on any outside training, otherwise, those young men would be going crazy.”</p><p>“Little Sister isn’t practicing any seduction techniques.  We're all cultivators. It's not as bad as you say,” the elder said, lecturing the woman, before turning serious. “Those who reach the final trial aren't weaklings.  Little Sister’s strength is indeed a bit lacking. Don’t forget Third Brother. His strength was among the best of us, yet he disappeared in the trial realm and we haven't heard from him since.”</p><p>Su Nu’s cheeks flushed, and she looked ashamed.  “It’s because of my weak cultivation and insufficient strength. These fire spirits just happen to counter my cultivation technique and can command beasts to attack. Luckily, Senior Brother and Sister Hong arrived in time. Otherwise, I don’t know how much longer I could have held out.”</p><p>Indeed, as the alluring woman said, she was captivating. Who would have thought that their Third Brother had met his end at the hands of such a person?</p><p>“Senior Brother, don’t worry. Third Brother is blessed. He probably encountered some unexpected delay. But besides Third Brother, we’ve all successfully reached the final trial. Once we regroup with the other disciples, we'll be able to complete Master’s order.”</p><p>The alluring woman offered reassurance.</p><p>Hearing this, Su Nu’s heart suddenly sank. She was completely unaware of the Master's order the alluring woman mentioned.</p><p>Instantly, Su Nu felt as though she had fallen into an ice cave.  She had been kept completely in the dark!</p><p>Su Nu secretly clenched her fists, suppressing her intense unease to avoid being noticed.</p><p>“Senior Brother, does Master have some important task for us? Why wasn’t I told?” Su Nu asked, her brows furrowed, looking puzzled.</p><p>The alluring woman also looked displeased.  “Not just you, Little Sister. I didn't know either until Senior Brother told me. And even now, Senior Brother still won’t reveal anything; he’s keeping it a secret.”</p><p>The elder with the long beard could no longer hold back, giving a wry smile.  “It’s not that I intentionally concealed it from you, but Master gave strict orders, and I dare not disobey. Before we left, Master repeatedly warned that this matter was of great importance and could not be leaked, not even to you, just in case.  Rest assured, Junior Sisters, once we regroup with the other disciples, I will tell you everything.”</p><p>Seeing that the elder was determined, the alluring woman stopped pressing the matter, laughing it off.  “Then let’s hurry! I want to see what else besides the Soul-Washing Liquid can catch Master's eye in this trial realm.”</p><p>The three of them flew on their light, continuing their journey.</p><p>“It’s said that this was originally a secret realm within the inner palace, transformed into a trial realm by our human ancestors. It's possible that undiscovered ancient treasures are hidden within…”</p><p>The elder with the long beard said as they walked. He looked towards the Treasure Pavilion, pausing before continuing, "We can't go directly to the Treasure Pavilion. Master said that it might cause a commotion and attract unwanted attention. We should find a hidden place near the Treasure Pavilion to wait for the other disciples. We need to finish this before we contend for the Soul-Washing Liquid.”</p><p>Su Nu said nothing, her thoughts racing.</p><p>Was the Master's order related to me?</p><p>Could this be the reason for my unease?</p><p>Protected by the senior brother and the alluring woman, both far stronger than I, I couldn't outmaneuver them like I did the third senior brother.</p><p>As we neared the Treasure Pavilion, another senior brother appeared.  I knew then that my chance was gone.</p><p>...</p><p>Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The heart of the trial grounds, the end of the entire ordeal.</p><p>Qin Sang forged his way through the Spirit Water region.</p><p>He quickly mastered dealing with the Spirit Water Toad's attacks. The water spirits and beasts posed no obstacle; it was far easier for him than for others.</p><p>His speed was unmatched.</p><p>After flying an unknown distance, a mountain silhouette, piercing the clouds, appeared on the horizon.  It was clearly the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Having finally located his target, Qin Sang smirked, and flew directly towards it.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang reached the edge of the marshland, landed, and got a clearer view.</p><p>The mountain was extremely perilous, a sheer stone peak, like a stone sword, with only a hint of green in the crevices.</p><p>A white stone staircase spiraled up the mountainside, clearly visible from here.</p><p>Scattered along the way were stone pavilions and towers, untouched for countless years, exuding solitude and desolation.</p><p>The staircase culminated at the mountaintop, leading directly to a pavilion – highly visible.</p><p>That pavilion was the Treasure Pavilion!</p><p>Standing atop a nearby peak, Qin Sang surveyed the stone peak, scanning his surroundings.  No one was in sight.  He seemed to be the first to arrive.</p><p>If he wished to take treasures from the Treasure Pavilion, he could choose freely.  But the time for the Soul Cleansing Liquid hadn't yet arrived.</p><p>He had arranged to meet Ming Wei at a pavilion on the stone peak.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't hesitate, continuing onward.  He soon reached the foot of the stone peak.</p><p>The stone peak was eerily silent, devoid of any figures.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed up the stone staircase, reaching the pavilion where he'd arranged to meet Ming Wei.  Without pausing, he left a mark and continued upward.</p><p>Time was on his side. He wanted to check out the Treasure Pavilion first.</p><p>He'd expected a difficult climb to the summit, but the stone peak was unguarded. Qin Sang easily arrived before the Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The interior of the pavilion was shielded by a curtain of light, a powerful enchantment.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, observing for a while, probing cautiously.  Confirming there was no danger and that the light barrier could be freely passed, he stepped inside.</p>
