<h1>Chapter 736: The Great Battle Against the Demons</h1><p>Qin Sang knew escape was impossible.</p><p>Two powerful demons pursued him. One was a black hawk, exceptionally majestic, capable of wielding golden lightning. The other was a winged flying fish, bizarre in appearance.</p><p>They were exceptionally strong, top-tier amongst demons of their realm, each rivaling—or even surpassing—the two-headed demonic beast.  They cleverly flanked Qin Sang, one on each side.</p><p>Even more worrying, Qin Sang faced more than just these two.  In the distance, other demons, summoned by the giant turtle, were converging on his position.</p><p>Without looking back, Qin Sang flew on his sword, ruthlessly slaughtering the demons.</p><p>The seawater turned crimson with blood, the bloody waves surging as countless demon corpses floated on the surface.</p><p>The two demons closed in, their pursuit relentless. Qin Sang's eyes flashed; a ferocious expression crossed his face. He suddenly turned, focusing on the strange flying fish.</p><p>The flying fish felt a shiver of dread, a primal instinct warning it of danger.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang moved.</p><p>Qin Sang had planned this.  He knew that if he got entangled with both demons amidst the demonic horde, he would be slowly worn down. His best chance was to defeat them one by one.</p><p>In the past, his only option in such a situation would have been to flee. But now, having broken through to the mid-Core Formation stage, his strength had increased dramatically. He no longer feared them; he even saw a chance of victory.</p><p>Talismans and sword-energy thunder roared to life, Qin Sang's speed suddenly exploding to an astonishing level. Like a red lightning bolt, his figure expanded rapidly in the flying fish's eyes.</p><p>The flying fish shrieked, a sound like a child's cry, incredibly eerie.</p><p>This battle-hardened demon wasn't panicked. It screamed for help from the black hawk, then puffed out its mouth, releasing a silvery pearl.</p><p>Qin Sang initially thought it was the flying fish's demon core, but upon closer inspection, realized it wasn't. It was probably some pearl the flying fish had found in the deep sea.</p><p>This pearl wasn't ordinary. Its aura rivaled that of a magic treasure; its formation was a mystery.</p><p>Qin Sang had encountered demons capable of refining such treasures before, but it was rare, a handful of times at most.</p><p>After releasing the pearl, the flying fish's abdomen swelled, and it spat out a puff of green energy onto the pearl. The pearl spun rapidly, and the green energy, agitated by the pearl, erupted into beams of green light.</p><p>Within the green light, there were fist-sized, strange orbs of light, even more dazzling than the light itself. And in the center of these orbs, something like lightning flickered.</p><p>"It seems like some kind of divine thunder.  I wonder if it's the flying fish's own power or a result of the pearl…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed. The power of the green orbs was formidable; he felt a stinging sensation.  Without hesitation, he pointed his ebony sword, unleashing the Blood-秽 Divine Light.</p><p>Touched by the Blood-秽 Divine Light, the pearl's luster dimmed; its rotation slowed dramatically, and it began to shake violently.</p><p>The green light dissipated, the divine thunder not fully dispersed but only partially formed.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed didn't lessen. He forcefully smashed through the divine thunder, instantly closing the distance to the flying fish.  He sheathed his ebony sword, his sleeves fluttering as the Ten Directions Yama Banner unfolded, the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire appearing before the flying fish's very eyes.</p><p>The flying fish was both shocked and enraged; escape was now impossible.</p><p>Qin Sang's strike, along with the two-headed demonic beast's attack, was incredibly fast. The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire engulfed the flying fish; its protective aura shattered almost instantly.</p><p>"BOOM!"</p><p>Smashed by the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, the flying fish let out a mournful cry.  The flesh on its back was corroded by the demon fire; one wing was reduced to a skeleton.</p><p>To make matters worse, its consciousness was also affected by the demon fire, causing it to become disoriented.</p><p>The flying fish swayed its head, and before it could regain its composure, the two-headed demonic beast pounced.</p><p>The two-headed beast lunged at the flying fish, its four hooves landing on its body. Its two heads simultaneously bit into the flying fish's vital points, its vertical pupils unleashing wind blades that the flying fish endured.</p><p>The flying fish screamed incessantly, its body riddled with wounds, blood flowing profusely.</p><p>Qin Sang watched coldly, his eyes devoid of any mercy.  He was about to unleash the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire again to end the flying fish’s life when he felt a sudden tightening in his back, his hair standing on end.</p><p>A black hawk, seemingly bathed in golden light, shrieked as a thick golden bolt of lightning ripped through the air, aiming straight for Qin Sang's back.</p><p>The lightning struck with terrifying speed and power.  Qin Sang, focused on killing the strange flying fish, was caught off guard.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Qin Sang didn't dodge. Without looking back, he unleashed the full power of his Nine Nether Demon Fire, continuing his attack on the flying fish.</p><p>Weakened by the fight with the two-headed monster, the strange flying fish was helpless against the Nine Nether Demon Fire.  It let out a desperate scream as the flames pierced its vital point, killing it instantly.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang was struck by the golden lightning.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Only blinding golden light remained where Qin Sang had stood; he was completely enveloped.</p><p>The two-headed monster watched with a complex expression.</p><p>Moments later, a violent surge within the golden light erupted, and a battered figure burst free. Qin Sang was pale, blood trickling from his mouth, but he seemed to have escaped serious injury.  </p><p>Most remarkably, a golden shield, now extremely dim, clung to his body.</p><p>Qin Sang darted behind the two-headed monster to assess his condition.  He muttered to himself, relieved.  His Jin Hui Armor's defense had held, preventing serious wounds.</p><p>He'd pushed the flying fish to the brink. Failing to capitalize would have been pointless. Thus, Qin Sang risked the hawk’s attack to kill the fish.</p><p>His confidence stemmed from the Jin Hui Armor, a magical item comparable in strength to a mid-grade magical treasure, and it hadn't disappointed.  His injuries were minor.</p><p>Trading a few injuries for a large demon's life was worth it.</p><p>Qin Sang took a healing pill, a blush rising on his face as he suppressed his wounds.  He stared coldly at the hawk, a low growl escaping his lips, “Again!”</p><p>The tables had turned. Qin Sang and the two-headed monster now flanked the hawk.</p><p>The hawk, witnessing the flying fish’s destruction, was terrified.  It fled, screaming orders to its minions to stop Qin Sang and calling for help from the giant turtle.</p><p>They were already close. The minor demons were ineffective. Qin Sang easily caught up to the hawk.  With the two-headed monster's assistance, the outcome was clear.</p><p>Initially trapped by the two large demons amidst the beast tide, Qin Sang's situation had been perilous.  But by risking injury and swiftly killing the flying fish, he’d reversed the tide.</p><p>The hawk struggled, but defeat was inevitable. Its screams alerted the distant battlefield.</p><p>The giant turtle and Yuan San Zhenren both witnessed this; the turtle enraged, Yuan San Zhenren overjoyed.</p>
