<h1></h1><p>Chapter 1319: Spiritual Treasure</p><p>"Should the insights I gain on my own in the future be exempt from these restrictions?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Bing Han nodded. "Naturally, I wouldn't impose too many constraints on you, Fellow Daoist. I trust you will act with discretion. The texts in our sect include not only ancient tomes on artifact forging but also the lifelong insights of our ancestors. Each one is invaluable and impossible to find elsewhere. I believe these should suffice to invite Fellow Daoist Qin to lend a hand."</p><p>Her words were not exaggerated. These were precisely what Qin Sang valued most. With the texts from the Void Spirit Sect, his artifact forging skills would undoubtedly advance by leaps and bounds.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did not rush to agree. Bing Han's eagerness made him somewhat suspicious.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Bing Han, why not speak plainly? What difficulty have you encountered? Although I wish to learn artifact forging, if it requires risking my life, it might not be worth it."</p><p>Hearing this, Bing Han smiled calmly. "Your concern is reasonable, but you overthink it, Fellow Daoist Qin. I can assure you that neither of us will face any life-threatening danger. The greatest cost would be something like what happened to Fellow Daoist Xiang—fire poison entering the body, damaging vitality, and requiring several years of rest to purge the poison. If you find this acceptable, make a vow first, and I will reveal everything."</p><p>Bing Han was even more cautious than Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this matter must be of utmost importance, possibly even related to the fate of the Void Spirit Sect. Fire poison entering the body and damaging vitality were costs he could bear. Exchanging a few years of seclusion for a treasured technique was a fair trade. He believed Bing Han would not lie about such matters, as it would render the Heart Demon Oath meaningless. Confident there were no traps, Qin Sang followed Bing Han's request and made the Heart Demon Oath.</p><p>After Qin Sang finished the oath, Bing Han's expression softened, and she became noticeably more amiable. Finally, she explained the reason. "This palace wishes to ask both of you to help me forge a treasure!"</p><p>"Forging a treasure?" Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>He had initially thought it was due to the restless underground fire veins in the forbidden land and that the Void Spirit Sect was facing some crisis. He never expected it to be such a request. This was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, as the leader of the Void Spirit Sect, your mastery of artifact forging is unparalleled. Even a top-grade treasure could be forged alone, provided you have sufficiently rare spiritual materials, right?"</p><p>Bing Han turned her gaze toward the mountain pass, her vision seemingly piercing through the rocks as she said in a deep voice, "A treasure that can become a Spiritual Treasure!"</p><p>"A Spiritual Treasure!" Qin Sang's eyes flashed with shock.</p><p>One of the reasons he sought Bing Han's guidance in artifact forging was to prepare for refining the Charred Wood, ensuring he did not accidentally harm Yun Youzi's true spirit. After that, the Ebony Sword would have the potential to ascend to the level of a Spiritual Treasure. He never expected Bing Han to be forging a Spiritual Treasure directly! This was the first time he had heard of someone attempting to forge a Spiritual Treasure.</p><p>The war across the three domains had been raging for years, involving all Nascent Soul cultivators, yet not a single Spiritual Treasure had emerged. Even the Blood Moon Wheel in Old Demon Ye's hands was only at the level of a top-grade treasure. Only now did Qin Sang realize how rare Spiritual Treasures were and how precious the relics left by Yun Youzi truly were.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind stirred. Regardless of whether he could help Bing Han succeed in forging the Spiritual Treasure, the experience alone would give him greater confidence in refining the Charred Wood in the future. He had to agree! Even if Bing Han offered no additional benefits, he would still participate.</p><p>Bing Han shook her head slightly. "Fellow Daoist Qin, you misunderstand. It's not about forging a Spiritual Treasure directly, but creating a treasure with the potential to transform into one—a treasure that can be passed down as a sect's legacy!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's puzzled expression, Bing Han countered, "Have you ever wondered why Spiritual Treasures are so rare in the cultivation world? Throughout history, there have been no shortage of prodigious talents, and sects like the Upper Pure Quiet Palace have endured for millennia. Could it be that no one has ever forged a Spiritual Treasure? Yet, in this great war, not a single Spiritual Treasure has appeared!"</p><p>This was precisely what Qin Sang found most perplexing. Unless those who possessed them feared attracting envy and dared not reveal them. But if one had a Spiritual Treasure for protection, there would be no need to fear being robbed.</p><p>The advancement of a treasure to a Spiritual Treasure is a transformation. The power of a Spiritual Treasure should not be inferior to the Eighteen Demon Banners. Qin Sang's reputation was largely built on the Eighteen Demon Banners. An ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator wielding a Spiritual Treasure could instantly become a top-tier expert.</p><p>"Please enlighten me, Fellow Daoist," Qin Sang said solemnly.</p><p>"In this barren era, it is already difficult for cultivators to break through to the Deity Transformation stage, let alone forge a Spiritual Treasure. The most important and greatest hurdle in creating a Spiritual Treasure is that spark of spirituality. Its profundity is beyond words," Bing Han sighed. "All I know is that, comparatively, the treasures most likely to develop spirituality are the life-bound treasures of cultivators. A late-stage Nascent Soul grandmaster, after nurturing their life-bound treasure for countless years, might elevate it to the level of a Spiritual Treasure, though the chances are said to be low. If the cultivator perishes, the life-bound Spiritual Treasure not only loses its power but, as its spirituality is tied to its master, it too will perish, reverting to the level of an ordinary treasure and unable to be passed down to descendants!"</p><p>"So that's how it is!" Qin Sang exclaimed in realization.</p><p>Based on his previous cultivation experience, he had vaguely guessed some of this. Life-bound treasures were the most unique, being intimately connected to a cultivator's life force. Cultivators almost always prioritized refining their life-bound treasures, as it was easier than refining ordinary treasures, unless they possessed something as extraordinary as the Eighteen Demon Banners. This advantage also manifested when advancing to a Spiritual Treasure. The downside was that if the cultivator perished, the life-bound treasure would suffer a significant loss of power. He never expected life-bound Spiritual Treasures to be even more severe—their spirituality would directly perish.</p><p>After a long moment of contemplation, Qin Sang suddenly asked, "Is this true only for lower-grade life-bound Spiritual Treasures, or for all of them? What about those with high spirituality, on the verge of developing a treasure spirit, or even those that have already developed one? Do they also perish alongside their master?"</p><p>This question stumped Bing Han. She pondered for a while before shaking her head with a bitter smile. "Fellow Daoist Qin, I cannot answer that. As far as I know, at the level of Spiritual Treasures and beyond, it is difficult to distinguish superiority or inferiority. Unlike artifacts and treasures, which have lower, middle, upper, and top grades, the level of a Spiritual Treasure's spirituality, the quality of its spiritual materials, and the refinement techniques used all greatly influence its power. Even the mutual enhancement or suppression between Spiritual Treasures is far more pronounced than with ordinary treasures or artifacts. As for treasure spirits, they exist only in legends. This palace knows nothing about them."</p><p>"So Spiritual Treasures have no grade distinctions. I've fallen into a trap of preconceived notions," Qin Sang said with a hint of shame.</p><p>Thinking about it, this made sense. It was already evident with treasures. Each of the Eighteen Demon Banners was only at the level of a lower-grade treasure, but when arranged into a formation, their power surpassed that of a top-grade treasure. At the level of Spiritual Treasures, their abilities were beyond comprehension, and such phenomena were likely even more common.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the Sword Spirit of the Slaughter Sword. He wondered about the origins of the Slaughter Sword. Its physical form had shattered, yet its Sword Spirit had survived to this day.</p><p>Bing Han consumed a few pills to restore her true essence, and her aura gradually stabilized. As Qin Sang continued to seek her guidance on matters related to Spiritual Treasures, they walked toward the mountain peak. Before long, they reached the summit's pass, where they sensed an extremely intense heat.</p>
