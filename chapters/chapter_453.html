<h1>Chapter 446: Protection</h1><p>“Shadowless Sword is actually Senior Qin?”</p><p>Le Rou and her husband exchanged glances, both with surprised expressions.</p><p>They had not been in the Chaotic Isles waters for long, but they had heard from friends about several prominent figures among the righteous, demonic, and rogue cultivators who had made a name for themselves on the battlefield.</p><p>Among them, Shadowless Sword was one of the few who had not yet reached the Pseudo Core Formation stage, but whose fame was no less than anyone else's.</p><p>He was said to have profound swordsmanship, thunderous sword momentum, and formless sword shadows.  Countless cultivators had died by his sword, making the Heavenly Mandate Alliance cultivators tremble with fear.</p><p>Unexpectedly, such a famous person actually had a considerable connection with them.</p><p>The Du cultivator gave a soft "Hmm" in agreement.</p><p>“I once saw Shadowless Sword fighting with Heavenly Mandate Alliance experts from afar. He wielded a gleaming flying sword, keeping his opponents constantly on the defensive. His swordsmanship was indeed profound, but not as formidable as the legends say.</p><p>“However, there must be a reason for his fame.</p><p>“It is said that what truly made Shadowless Sword famous was another flying sword, a very mysterious one.  Legend says that when the sword is drawn, blood must be spilled. Some suspect it is an evil weapon, while others say it can command thunder and is a sacred artifact.</p><p>“He hails from Shaohua Mountain, and no one dares to delve into these matters and incur the wrath of Shaohua Mountain.</p><p>“Since you know Shadowless Sword, your previous worries are completely unnecessary.</p><p>“You two are quite strong.  If you can build a good relationship with him and gain his protection, joining his team would be ideal. At the very least, you can ask him for a referral to join the team of another Shaohua Mountain expert…”</p><p>…</p><p>Regardless of how the three discussed him behind his back, Qin Sang flew northeastward without looking back.  When Observatory Island appeared in sight, Qin Sang's figure flashed, landing on a large island northwest of it.</p><p>The buildings on this island were arranged differently from other islands. The streets formed a grid, and the houses were neatly arranged. Many cultivators traveled the streets.</p><p>Various banners hung outside the houses, indicating they were shops.</p><p>At the very center of the island was a small auction house, seemingly inconspicuous but actually quite popular.</p><p>In the Small Cold Realm, including rogue cultivators, apart from those guarding the Seven Heroes Pass and those exempt from conscription, most Foundation Establishment cultivators had been summoned to the Chaotic Isles.</p><p>With so many experts gathered in the small Chaotic Isles, treasures frequently appeared, igniting envy.</p><p>However, the most popular spot was an island in the northernmost part of the Chaotic Isles, conventionally known as Mist Island.</p><p>When Qin Sang landed on the large island, he felt a pull in his heart and looked north.</p><p>Standing on the large island, he could see the edge of the northern Mist Sea, where Mist Island was hidden.</p><p>It was said that the establishment of Mist Island was strongly urged by a Core Formation expert among the rogue cultivators and unanimously supported by all cultivators, including those from the righteous and demonic sects.</p><p>Anyone, regardless of identity, could enter Mist Island through a token from anywhere within the Mist Sea.</p><p>On Mist Island, everyone could conceal their true identity and appearance for transactions. After completing a transaction and leaving Mist Island, they would be randomly transported to another location by the formation.</p><p>For this reason, the number of cultivators entering and exiting Mist Island every day was far greater than that of the large island.</p><p>However, Mist Island had its advantages, and the large island had its own.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze and walked into a street, finally arriving in front of a luxuriously decorated shop.</p><p>Although it didn't bear the name of the Heavenly Spear Pavilion, it was indeed one of its properties.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin has finally arrived! Please come in, please come in!"</p><p>Although it wasn't the Heavenly Spear Pavilion in Green Sun City, the shop manager was familiar with Qin Sang and warmly greeted him, leading him into a private room and personally serving tea.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and said, "Tea is unnecessary. I hope the news you mentioned earlier is true. I pray nothing unexpected occurs to disappoint me."</p><p>"How could you say that, Fellow Daoist?  When have I ever deceived you?"</p><p>The manager feigned annoyance, waved his hand to activate the room's restrictions, took out a jade box, and presented it to Qin Sang. "Please have a look, Fellow Daoist. Isn't this Soul-Guiding Grass?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered as he looked down. Inside the jade box was indeed a complete stalk of Soul-Guiding Grass, very similar to the three he had bought at the Yin Mountain Pass auction. Its age and medicinal properties were certainly sufficient.</p><p>He was very familiar with Soul-Guiding Grass and didn't need to open the jade box to confirm its authenticity. A satisfied expression appeared on his face.</p><p>Soul-Guiding Grass was related to the refinement of living corpses.  Firstly, it was a rare spiritual herb that could directly aid cultivation, making it highly valuable to demonic and evil cultivators. Secondly, the Corpse Puppet Talisman had almost苛刻demands for the quality of Soul-Guiding Grass.</p><p>Over the past three years, despite searching extensively, Qin Sang hadn't found a single stalk that met the requirements.</p><p>Fortunately, he had spared no expense at the Yin Mountain Pass auction, purchasing three stalks at the cost of thousand-year-old spiritual herbs. Otherwise, refining living corpses would have remained a distant dream.</p><p>Although Soul-Guiding Grass was precious, it wasn't enough to make Qin Sang overly emotional. With a calm demeanor, he shifted his gaze from the jade box to the manager and said indifferently, "What price are you asking for?"</p><p>The manager had been observing Qin Sang's expression and now subtly retracted his gaze.  He took a sip of tea before saying, "Fellow Daoist Qin must be aware of the effects of Soul-Guiding Grass. If our shop were to offer it publicly on the east side of Observatory Island, it would undoubtedly spark a fierce competition."</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened slightly, and he frowned. "Do you mean that the items I previously pawned here... aren't enough to purchase the Soul-Guiding Grass?"</p><p>The manager hastily shook his head and repeatedly explained, "No, no, no... Fellow Daoist misunderstands!  I am grateful for Fellow Daoist Qin's trust in our shop. Those artifacts are all of excellent quality, and their combined value is more than sufficient. I am willing to sell it to Fellow Daoist Qin at this price to build a good relationship.  It's just..."</p><p>He hesitated, then dipped his finger in tea water and wrote a name on the table. "I only hope that Fellow Daoist Qin, considering this small favor, will offer some protection to this junior of mine. His cultivation is decent, and I've prepared several life-saving artifacts for him. He certainly won't be a burden."</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the name on the table and pondered for a moment.  Then, in a deep voice, he said, "Given my relationship with the Heavenly Spear Pavilion, if a fellow from the Heavenly Spear Pavilion encounters difficulties, I naturally cannot stand idly by."</p><p>The manager breathed a sigh of relief, his face full of gratitude. "With your word, Fellow Daoist Qin, I am relieved. I await your good news. Please take this Soul-Guiding Grass."</p><p>"Then I won't decline your kindness."</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Qin Sang put away the jade box. After exchanging his spoils of war for spirit stones, he took his leave.</p><p>He didn't linger on the large island.  Pondering how to arrange matters for the manager's junior, he flew directly towards the Mist Sea.</p><p>After entering the Mist Sea, Qin Sang took out his token and cast a unique hand seal upon it.</p><p>The token emitted a faint light, connecting with the formation. Qin Sang felt the surrounding mist tremble, and in the next moment, an island appeared before his eyes.</p>
