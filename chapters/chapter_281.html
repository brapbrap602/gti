<h1>    of an hour later, they escaped from the Stone Stele area.</p><p>Including the three Core Formation cultivators, all</h1><p>    of them looked disheveled.</p><p>The entire legacy space had become a playground for the Fire Spirits. As soon as</p><p>    they entered, they were besieged by a swarm of these creatures. The Fire Spirits seemed to multiply endlessly. Even</p><p>    forming a battle formation proved challenging, forcing them to retreat.</p><p>“Since these Fire Spirits are born</p><p>    from the totems, and most of the totems are now destroyed, the birth rate of new Fire Spirits has greatly decreased.</p><p>    The three of us just need to spend some time clearing them out bit by bit. However, the space around the celestial</p><p>    peaks has completely collapsed, riddled with spatial rifts. We'll probably need the sect leaders to personally</p><p>    intervene before anyone can approach that area.”</p><p>Sikong Muyue's robe shimmered, restoring itself to its</p><p>    original pristine condition.</p><p>Individually, Fire Spirits weren't particularly strong. A Core Formation</p><p>    cultivator could easily handle one. The real danger lay in encountering thousands of them swarming together, like in</p><p>    the caverns or the volcano crater.</p><p>Now that the Fire Spirits were scattered throughout the vast ancient legacy</p><p>    space, their density was much lower. As long as the three Core Formation cultivators were discreet in their actions,</p><p>    avoiding alarming a large group at once, they should be safe.</p><p>Che Yutao slowly shook his head. “Nascent Soul</p><p>    cultivators are all busy dealing with their tribulations and rarely get distracted. There are no treasures in this</p><p>    legacy space that would attract a Nascent Soul cultivator… Besides, Fellow Daoist Sikong wasn't at the celestial</p><p>    peaks at the time, so you don't understand how terrifying it was. Near the peaks, the space is extremely unstable,</p><p>    with rifts constantly appearing. Some are even invisible and intangible, making them difficult to detect. I almost</p><p>    got swallowed by one, and only managed to escape after sacrificing a magical treasure. Although the legacy space</p><p>    isn't completely destroyed, the space deep within is still rapidly changing. It's no less dangerous than the core</p><p>    area of an ancient battlefield…”</p><p>Sikong Muyue and Du Yi exchanged glances, remaining silent. They both</p><p>    understood the underlying meaning of Che Yutao's words: Di Que and Xuan Yu were most likely in grave danger.</p><p>A</p><p>    deep worry appeared on Du Yi's face. “Fellow Daoist Di Que is one thing, but if Fellow Daoist Xuan Yu perishes here,</p><p>    I fear the Supreme Purity Palace will blame us…”</p><p>In truth, Du Yi knew that among the three of them, Sikong</p><p>    Muyue and Che Yutao had the backing of their sects and didn't fear the wrath of the Supreme Purity Palace. Only he</p><p>    lacked such powerful support and might have to bear the brunt of their anger alone.</p><p>“Accidents are common when</p><p>    exploring the unknown. The Supreme Purity Palace wouldn't be so unreasonable. Besides, Fellow Daoist Xuan Yu might</p><p>    have found a place to hide and might not have perished. We can't just stand by and do nothing. At the very least, we</p><p>    should go to the foot of the celestial peaks and check.”</p><p>Sikong Muyue pondered for a moment and added, “Also,</p><p>    although the peaks in front of the celestial peaks were destroyed by the magma, they are at the edge of the spatial</p><p>    rift zone and less affected. A large part of them still remains. The items within the restrictions in the mountains,</p><p>    while not particularly valuable, are still treasures worth risking for Foundation Establishment disciples. After we</p><p>    clear out the Fire Spirits, this place can serve as a training ground for our disciples.”</p><p>Che Yutao nodded.</p><p>    “Fellow Daoist Sikong is thoughtful. In that case, the three of us will stay a bit longer. However, if we want to go</p><p>    deeper into the legacy space, we'll need to find some helpers…”</p><p>…</p><p>Hanging Skull Pass.</p><p>Qin Sang</p><p>    stood outside the pass, gazing up at the imposing structure, filled with emotion. It had been over ten years since</p><p>    he last set foot here.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Yifeng’s voice reached his ears.</p><p>“Junior Brother Qin, I still</p><p>    need to report to Senior Brother Qi. I’ll go ahead first. We'll meet again another day.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his</p><p>    hands in farewell.</p><p>“Farewell, Senior Brother Mu.”</p><p>Watching Mu Yifeng depart, Qin Sang’s expression</p><p>    turned contemplative.</p><p>After they emerged from the ancient legacy space, Che Yutao had ordered everyone to</p><p>    disperse.</p><p>With the legacy space now occupied by Fire Spirits, Foundation Establishment cultivators like them</p><p>    couldn't enter for the time being. They could only wait until the Core Formation cultivators had cleared out most of</p><p>    the Fire Spirits before venturing back in to search for treasures.</p><p>Due to the spatial collapse, the</p><p>    restriction formations on those peaks might have been weakened, making them easier to break than before.</p><p>Of</p><p>    course, the danger was also greater than before. It was impossible to eliminate all the Fire Spirits, and being at</p><p>    the edge of the spatial rift zone could be a double-edged sword.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't particularly interested in</p><p>    the treasures within the restrictions. The only things that truly intrigued him were the Inner Scenery Talisman,</p><p>    which he wasn't sure if Xuan Yu had hidden, and the mysterious stone hall within the volcano's belly.</p><p>The</p><p>    celestial peaks had collapsed. He didn't know if the things inside had survived. Even if they had, Qin Sang wouldn't</p><p>    dare to go in.</p><p>As Che Yutao said, the depths of the Legacy Ruins are now as dangerous as the heart of the</p><p>    Ancient Immortal Battlefield. Even Core Formation cultivators dare not trespass; perhaps only Nascent Soul ancestors</p><p>    can come and go freely.</p><p>If one has already reached Nascent Soul, what use is the Inner Landscape Talisman?</p></p><p><p>It must be said, this is a paradox. Of course, Qin Sang is far from the time to ponder such things. The matter before</p><p>    him is how to reach Core Formation.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang flipped his hand, revealing in his palm the</p><p>    token left by Yun Youzi.</p><p>Yun Youzi had personal matters to attend to. He left the token with Qin Sang,</p><p>    instructing him to settle in and then leave the token and his address at the Grand Clarity Pill Pavilion. Upon his</p><p>    return, they would discuss the trip to the medicine garden in detail.</p><p>Having fully grasped the second Killing</p><p>    Talisman, Qin Sang no longer needed to train before breaking through to the middle stage of Foundation</p><p>    Establishment. He decided to find a cave dwelling for secluded cultivation in the southern mountains of Skull Gorge,</p><p>    so he skipped the Celestial Crystal Secret Realm and returned directly to Skull Gorge.</p><p>Evening approached.</p></p><p><p>After entering the city, Qin Sang found Yu Yangzi and rented a cave dwelling established by his sect.</p><p>Spirit</p><p>    stones were still necessary, and because Qin Sang requested the best cave, the price was not low. However, having</p><p>    inherited Elder Di Que's estate, he could afford it.</p><p>Next, he went to the Grand Clarity Pill Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>    After inquiring with the manager, Qin Sang sighed inwardly.</p><p>Yun Youzi had been right.</p><p>In the twenty</p><p>    years since his last visit, the Grand Clarity Pill Pavilion had not auctioned any Harmony Pills, Five Mushroom</p><p>    Divine Paste, or Snow Ginseng Jade Life Pills. The most recent auction, nearly fifty years ago, had been for a</p><p>    single bottle of Five Mushroom Divine Paste.</p><p>Leaving Yun Youzi's token and the cave dwelling's address at the</p><p>    Grand Clarity Pill Pavilion, Qin Sang left the city that night.</p><p>The bright moon hung high, its light reflected</p><p>    in the snow.</p><p>The night was as bright as day.</p><p>South of Skull Gorge, snow-capped mountains stretched</p><p>    endlessly, like a slumbering azure dragon, a desolate and uninhabited land.</p><p>Despite the bitter cold, many</p><p>    spirit veins were hidden within the mountains, all of good quality. Mount Shaohua occupied several of them,</p><p>    establishing cave dwellings for its disciples. Guarded by the Skull Gorge patrol, there was no fear of</p><p>    intrusion.</p><p>The cave dwelling was located on the summit of a snow-capped mountain, offering a vast view.</p><p></p><p>    Qin Sang pushed open the stone door, a gust of cold wind rushing in, sweeping away the stale air within. After</p><p>    assessing the spiritual energy within the cave, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction. He sealed the entrance, set up some</p><p>    restrictions, and then sat cross-legged on the ice bed.</p><p>After some deliberation, Qin Sang took out the bone</p><p>    fragment and the Nine Dragons Chariot Talisman.</p><p>Although he had not yet discussed the matter in depth with Yun</p><p>    Youzi, he was already inclined to accept the invitation and embark on the journey.</p></p>
