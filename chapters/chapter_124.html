<h1>**Chapter 117: The Cat Demon and the Devil**</h1><p>"Who goes there!?"</p><p>The furious voice echoed out of the mountain cave, followed by two beams of light, one black and one white, that shot out of the entrance. Before Qin Sang could clearly make out the figures within the beams of light, Gu Tiannan and his disciple sprang into action.</p><p>Gu Tiannan raised his palm slightly, and the five spirit swords returned swiftly to hover in front of him.</p><p>His disciple, Gu Yuan, also withdrew a flaming short sword.</p><p>"Devil, prepare to die!"</p><p>The master and disciple took flight, their swords pointed at the black beam of light, ready to close in on it.</p><p>"You old fiend, again!"</p><p>The black beam of light dissipated, revealing a man in a black robe. He had a gaunt face with deep-set eyes and cheekbones that made him appear more like a skeleton than a man.</p><p>At the sight of Gu Tiannan and his disciple, the man in the black robe was filled with rage. He opened his mouth wide and shot out a black flying needle that headed straight for Gu Yuan's face.</p><p>Gu Yuan seemed to have learned his lesson, for as soon as he saw the needle flying toward him, he ducked in panic. However, the needle clung to him like a leech, its speed and agility astonishing. In a flash, it dodged Gu Yuan's short sword and was about to pierce him when Gu Tiannan stepped in.</p><p>Gu Tiannan watched calmly as his disciple fought, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. When it came, he extended his hand and flicked his wrist. The Five Elements Sword of Breaking Barriers, which had seemed still until that moment, suddenly sprang into motion. Five beams of light combined into a single sword energy that shot out with lightning speed. Before the man in the black robe could react, it struck the flying needle squarely.</p><p>The flying needle spun and tumbled in the air, its glow fading considerably. The man in the black robe cried out in alarm and hastily recalled the needle. He examined his weapon with great concern, only to be relieved when he found that there was no major damage.</p><p>But Gu Tiannan refused to let up. He flicked the Five Elements Sword of Breaking Barriers, reversing its trajectory. The sword energy's speed increased dramatically, its immense pressure causing the man in the black robe to change expression. Hurriedly, he opened his mouth and spat out a cloud of demonic energy, which enveloped the flying needle.</p><p>Empowered by the demonic energy, the flying needle recovered its full strength and vibrated slightly before transforming into a thin, black thread. It shot forward to meet the Five Elements Sword of Breaking Barriers, its needle-tip clashing against the sword-tip. A deadlock ensued, neither side able to prevail.</p><p>At the same time, the man in the black robe opened his palm, revealing a cow skull the size of his hand. It was devoid of flesh, but its eye sockets contained two eyeballs that darted around, giving it an eerie appearance.</p><p>With a wicked glint in his eye, the man in the black robe made a quick cut on his fingertip, squeezing out several drops of blood which he dripped into the cow skull's mouth.</p><p>The cow skull greedily absorbed the blood, its eyes glowing brighter and its body pulsating with demonic energy.</p><p>With a forceful flick of his hand, the man in the black robe sent the cow skull hurtling into the air.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>The cow skull surged forward, its eyes fixed on Gu Tiannan. It let out a terrifying cackle, and in the blink of an eye, it was upon him, its mouth wide open, ready to bite down.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Gu Tiannan ignored the attack. Instead, he reached into his mustard seed pouch and retrieved a withered tree root. He held it in his hand and began to mutter an incantation.</p><p>Meanwhile, his disciple Gu Yuan rushed to his side, his short sword blazing with red light. Though he managed to fend off the cow skull, the flames on his weapon grew weaker after each bite.</p><p>Grimacing with effort, Gu Yuan held his ground, but he was clearly struggling.</p><p>Just when Gu Yuan was about to collapse, the tree root in Gu Tiannan's hand suddenly underwent a strange transformation. It crackled with electricity, and its entire surface turned a brilliant silver.</p><p>'BOOM!'</p><p>A deafening crash echoed through the air as a bolt of lightning shot out from the tree root, striking the cow skull with full force.</p><p>'CRACK!'</p><p>The demonic energy around the cow skull surged violently, and half of its face exploded into pieces.</p><p>The cow skull, as if it were a living creature, let out a piercing cry of pain and retreated back to the man in the black robe, clamping its teeth down on his palm. No matter how hard the man tried, he could not force it to come out again.</p><p>A mocking smile spread across Gu Tiannan's face as he pointed the tree root at the flying needle in the air.</p><p>Seeing this, the man in the black robe's expression changed. He glanced at the ongoing battle, hesitated for a moment, and then recalled the flying needle. With a burst of light, he transformed back into his original form and turned to flee.</p><p>"Devil! This is your day to die!"</p><p>Gu Tiannan gave a cold shout, controlled his sword and chased after the enemy, and at the same time, he turned his head to shout at Qin Sang, "Junior Brother Qin, you block that cat demon. I will kill this devil first, then come back to help you!"</p><p>Qin Sang just 'hmm'ed as a response, waved his Bibo Sword fiercely, and three giant water waves formed a Chinese character '品' shape, completely blocking the path, forcing the white cat that was anxious to support the youth in the black robe back.</p><p>That's right, his opponent is a white cat.</p><p>This white cat looks no different from an ordinary cat, but it is a Fanyao late-stage demonic beast!</p><p>The white cat stood upright, holding a magic weapon made of blue bamboo in its front claws. Its power was extraordinary. It shot out streaks of green light, making Qin Sang dare not to take it lightly. However, this was also due to the fact that Qin Sang had not used his full strength.</p><p>He had some doubts about Gu Tiannan, fearing that it was a trap, and he was unwilling to use all his trump cards. While using the Bibo Sword to deal with the white cat, he also secretly observed Gu Tiannan and the youth in the black robe.</p><p>After some exchanges, Qin Sang found that both sides were very ruthless and fierce, wishing to put the other party to death. It should not be acting.</p><p>Probably I'm too suspicious, Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>Seeing Gu Tiannan and his apprentice chasing after the youth in the black robe and disappearing from their sight in a blink of an eye, they had gained the upper hand, and it was only a matter of time before they won. Qin Sang also wanted to quickly get rid of the cat demon and go back to report.</p><p>Fanyao stage demonic beasts had unopened intelligence and were not difficult to deal with.</p><p>Qin Sang made up his mind, and was about to put away the Bibo Sword and summon the Ebony Sword for a quick battle, but the cat demon suddenly broke away from its usual behavior and no longer tried to leave. Instead, it stood up straight, leaning on the blue bamboo to face Qin Sang.</p><p>From its dark blue pupils, Qin Sang actually felt a brilliance of intelligence no less than that of a human, which made him feel puzzled.</p><p>‘Crash! ‘</p><p>The blue bamboo suddenly spread out a piece of secluded light, covering them.</p><p>A warning sign rose in Qin Sang's heart. He immediately summoned the Ebony Sword and suspended it around him. At the same time, he looked around warily, and found that there seemed to be no danger except the green light in the sky, but he could not see the cat demon at all now.</p><p>Illusion or something?</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself, hesitating whether to break the formation with another formation.</p><p>At this moment, the green light in front of Qin Sang changed and the white cat appeared from deep inside. Like a human, it clasped its hands together and bowed to Qin Sang. "Don't worry, sir. These green lights are just for my self-protection. They can't hurt you. I'm here to ask sir for a favor on someone's behalf."</p><p>Its voice was crisp and clear, like that of a young girl.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes widened in surprise, "You can talk?"</p><p>Apart from those special demonic beasts, most demonic creatures can only transform into humans and speak human language after reaching the Transformation Form stage. Such demonic beasts are called Transformation Form Great Demonic Beasts, and their strength is comparable to that of human Nascent Soul cultivators. Obviously, the white cat is not one of them.</p>
