<h1>Chapter 1805: Retreat</h1><p>The jade-green floor tiles reflected the figures of the two as they walked.</p><p>Multicolored streams of light flowed within the pagoda, creating the sensation of constant spatial distortion, unconsciously making one tense.  However, according to Venerable Zhenru, the first level held no danger.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang withdrew his Buddhist hand seal, not having been repelled by the Vajra Stupa Pagoda.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru walked and described the layers of seals within the Vajra Stupa Pagoda to Qin Sang, taking out some items and handing them over. They were treasures that could aid in breaking the seals.</p><p>After careful discussion, the two decided that Venerable Zhenru would lead the way, with Qin Sang following close behind to familiarize himself with the pagoda and utilize his advantage of cultivating both body and Dharma.</p><p>Thus, Qin Sang summoned the Gray Warbler Sword.  The sword hovered in the air, its light cascading down, enveloping the two.</p><p>Before long, they reached the end and saw a statue of Buddha.</p><p>Unlike the majestic Buddha statues in temples, this one was only the height of a normal person. Its features were lifelike, as if sculpted after a real monk.</p><p>The monk wore simple robes, his feet resting on a lotus platform. He had a kind face and downcast eyes, one hand in a gesture of greeting, the other grasping a crescent moon monk's spade, topped with nine golden prayer beads.</p><p>Compared to the imposing crescent moon spade, the monk's body seemed somewhat frail, as if the man and the weapon were mismatched.</p><p>Walking before the statue, Qin Sang's gaze was immediately drawn to the monk's eyes.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that these were sculpted eyes. At first glance, they only gave a very benevolent impression, but when one met the statue's gaze, one discovered that the eyes seemed to contain boundless Buddhist principles, drawing one deep within.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, be careful.”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru chanted a Buddhist mantra.</p><p>The first time he entered the Vajra Stupa Pagoda, he had been captivated by the statue's eyes. Fortunately, he had the records left by his ancestors and was already wary, managing to break free in time.</p><p>If one were to sink too deep and become unable to extricate oneself, one might not necessarily become lost, but one's mind might be agitated, requiring a long time to recover, rendering this attempt to conquer the pagoda fruitless before it even began.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly withdrew his gaze, his expression unchanged.  Imitating Venerable Zhenru, he bowed to the statue and sat cross-legged on a lotus platform before it.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang felt the light and shadows shift. The Buddha statue before him abruptly vanished, replaced by two stunningly beautiful women, clad in thin, revealing garments, walking towards them with captivating grace.</p><p>The women's every smile and glance was filled with charm, their eyes full of affection. Their figures were exquisite, their movements subtly revealing their allure, accompanied by boundless enchanting music that stirred the flames of desire, like the legendary Heavenly Devil's Dance.</p><p>Those with weaker minds, upon seeing this sight, would likely be consumed by lust, unable to control themselves.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please follow behind this humble monk. If you feel discomfort, take this spiritual pill…”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru's voice came, pointing to the jade bottle he had given Qin Sang earlier.</p><p>He had lived a monastic life since childhood and viewed these women as nothing more than painted skeletons.</p><p>However, the power of the Heavenly Devil's Dance would grow stronger and stronger.</p><p>Moreover, this Heavenly Devil's Dance was unlike ordinary illusions; it stirred the deepest desires within one's heart.  If Fellow Daoist Qin Sang's mind was insufficient and he showed even the slightest lapse in concentration, he might lose control.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru didn't know what the consequences of being lost here were. The past generations of Jintaisi Temple's ancestors had been extremely cautious when exploring the Vajra Stupa Pagoda.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Venerable Zhenru, Qin Sang had the protection of the Jade Buddha, and this level of the Heavenly Devil's Dance could not shake his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind was clear, but he didn't show it. He acknowledged with a simple "Alright," rose, and followed behind Venerable Zhenru, closing his eyes, matching his every step.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru clasped his hands together, chanting Buddhist scriptures, and slowly walked forward.</p><p>The two traversed the Heavenly Devil’s Dance.</p><p>The seductive music entered their ears, provoking the fires of desire, impossible to block even with closed senses.</p><p>More and more women emerged from the shadows, the scene becoming increasingly explicit and indecent.</p><p>Some even clung to them, their breath hot against their skin, the smooth touch feeling almost real.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru and Qin Sang kept their eyes straight ahead, passing through layers of illusion, finally stopping before an archway.</p><p>The archway’s gate was transparent, like a gate of light. This was the pagoda's seal. The moment they stood before the gate, the power of the Heavenly Devil’s Dance suddenly intensified severalfold.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru's gaze sharpened. He struck the archway with his palm.  A cracking sound echoed as the gate of light shattered.</p><p>The two quickly stepped through the gate, and the Heavenly Devil’s Dance instantly vanished.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru glanced at Qin Sang, saw his calm expression, and nodded. “The next level is the Blood Pool Hell.”</p><p>Qin Sang had already seen the wave of blood surging towards them.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>A deluge of blood engulfed them.</p><p>Blood Pool Hell was one of the eighteen levels of hell in Buddhist scriptures, and Jintaisi Temple's name for this place was quite apt.</p><p>The water of the blood pool carried a foul aura.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his True Essence, forming a protective罡罩, blocking the blood. He saw blood in all directions, filling his vision with crimson.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang discovered that although he had blocked the blood, the foul aura could penetrate his protective罡罩, seeping into his body.</p><p>With the accumulation of this foul aura, not only would his flesh and bones decay, but his True Essence would also be contaminated. It was terrifying.</p><p>Qin Sang then circulated the Diamond Celestial Armor Seal, but it could only weaken the penetration of the foul aura, not completely block it.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The surrounding blood churned.</p><p>The blood formed grotesque,狰狞-faced evil spirits that stared at them fiercely and lunged forward.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru had somehow produced his staff, striking out with a series of cracks. The evil spirits exploded into mists of blood.</p><p>Qin Sang also joined the fight, making another startling discovery: every time he killed an evil ghost, he would be tainted by a wisp of foul aura.</p><p>"Ahead lie the Freezing Hell and the Volcano Hell, both with similar evil ghosts. When this humble monk entered the pagoda alone, by the time I reached the end of the Volcano Hell, my body had already accumulated a large amount of foul, icy, and fiery auras, clashing within me. Even upon reaching the sixth level, I no longer had the strength to continue…"</p><p>Venerable Zhenru and Qin Sang fought side-by-side, jointly slaying the ghosts, while he recounted his previous experience in detail.</p><p>From the outside, the Vajra Stupa Pagoda had seven levels.</p><p>Inside, there was no vertical layering.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru believed that the space with the Buddha statue was the first level, the Heavenly Devil's Dance was the second, the three hells were the third, fourth, and fifth, and the sixth level's seal was the last.  Breaking it would grant access to the treasures of the seventh level!</p><p>But the seal on the last level had stopped all the eminent monks of Jintaisi Temple.</p><p>Breaking the seals on the previous levels would leave residual auras, and there was no opportunity to recover along the way. By the time they reached the sixth level, their strength would inevitably be greatly diminished. Even with the various pills and treasures they had gathered to assist them, they couldn't break the final seal.</p><p>This time, with Qin Sang's help, they would share the burden.</p><p>Qin Sang tried several magical treasures and Daoist techniques, but none could prevent the intrusion of the foul aura. He simply wielded the Gray Warbler Sword, its sword energy forming a forest, carving a path through the Blood Pool Hell.</p><p>The two moved swiftly, traversing the blood pool and reaching its end, where they found an identical archway.</p><p>They shattered the archway and were met with a blast of icy wind, instantly covering them in frost.</p><p>The two continued forward against the biting wind. The piercing cold constantly invaded their bodies, giving even cultivators of their level the illusion of being frozen stiff.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something. The seals within the pagoda were indeed strong, but they had passed three levels without encountering any mortal danger.</p><p>Rather than being designed to stop outsiders from breaking the seals, it seemed more like a test or a trial.</p><p>The past generations of Jintaisi Temple monks believed that the seventh level held Buddhist treasures based on this very reason.</p><p>After passing through the Freezing Hell, they entered the fiery Volcano Hell.</p><p>All they could see was crimson; flames surrounded them, and invisible fire seemed to penetrate their defenses, scorching them.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru took out a piece of warm jade and held it in his mouth. It was a treasure Jintaisi Temple had acquired after years of searching. It could alleviate pressure and was effective even in the Volcano Hell.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. Confident in his mastery of fire, he didn't take any other action. He sensed the invisible fire invading his body and silently circulated the Fire Lotus, only to discover, surprisingly, that the invisible fire was not suppressed.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang realized that the flames in the Volcano Hell, although appearing real, were likely not true spiritual fire, but rather illusory constructs formed by some special formation or prohibition.</p><p>Even he and the Heaven's Eye Butterfly couldn't distinguish between real and fake. Qin Sang marveled at this, acknowledging the incredible skill involved.</p><p>Countless flames formed into fire spirits, rushing towards them. The two carved a fiery path, reaching the seal.</p><p>Sword and staff struck in unison, shattering the seal, and they stepped into the sixth level!</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the chaotic auras within his body – foul, icy, and fiery auras intertwined. He had to constantly suppress them, unable to expel them in such a short time.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru also sensed his own condition. He was in much better shape than before and was overjoyed.  “This is the Eighteen Copper Men Formation!  The ancestors of our temple have only managed to break three at most.”</p><p>The sixth level had no illusions.  What greeted them were eighteen monks cast in bronze.</p><p>The bronze monks seemed to be alive, bowing to the two in greeting.</p><p>Then, the eighteen bronze monks blurred, instantly forming a formation, raising their bronze staffs and attacking.</p><p>‘Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…’</p><p>A fierce wind assaulted them.</p><p>In an instant, shadowy figures surrounded the two, enveloped by the eighteen bronze monks.</p><p>The eighteen bronze monks encircled them, moving at incredible speed.</p><p>In the next moment, eighteen bronze staffs appeared above their heads, crashing down with terrifying force.</p><p>“Amitabha.”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru chanted softly, raising his right palm above his head.  His palm swelled as if inflated and transformed into jade.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The gigantic palm met the bronze staffs head-on.</p><p>He was not fighting alone. Qin Sang struck simultaneously, his Rotating Platform Seal connecting with the eighteen bronze staffs almost at the same time as the giant palm.</p><p>One hard, one soft, two completely different forces, yet their coordination was exceptionally seamless. Not only did they repel the bronze staffs, but under their deliberate control, the formation of the Eighteen Copper Men Formation was also disrupted.</p><p>In the next moment, Venerable Zhenru used some unknown technique. Buddhist light flowed through him, erupting from his crown, instantly transforming into a towering pillar.</p><p>The pillar tilted to one side with terrifying momentum, forcing some of the bronze monks to raise their staffs to block it.</p><p>At this moment, a cold glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes.  With a sudden sword cry, the Gray Warbler Sword appeared above a bronze monk, along with seven illusory projections of Qin Sang’s sword souls.</p><p>The Seven Souls Killing Formation!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Sword light flashed like lightning.</p><p>The bronze monk couldn’t dodge. In a desperate attempt, Buddhist light emanated from its body, and the other bronze monks appeared around it as if out of thin air.</p><p>Unfortunately, the sword light was too fast. Before the bronze monks could reform their formation, it had already struck.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The sound of a bronze bell resonated through the space. The bronze monk shattered, pieces of copper scattering across the ground, causing the other bronze monks to momentarily falter.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru's face showed surprise, astonished by the power of the Seven Souls Killing Formation.  He was delighted that they had slain a bronze monk so quickly, something that had never happened before.</p><p>“Excellent swordsmanship!”</p><p>Venerable Zhenru shouted his praise.  He had donned golden armor at some point and charged towards the other bronze monks like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>They had seized the initiative, killing one bronze monk and disrupting many of the Eighteen Copper Men Formation’s changes. However, the formation hadn't weakened significantly.  As if enraged by their companion's death, the bronze monks seemed to grow stronger.</p><p>However, without their tight formation, restricting Qin Sang was futile.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru fully occupied the bronze monks, while Qin Sang patiently waited for an opportunity, each strike of his sword claiming another bronze monk.</p><p>As time passed, the number of bronze monks dwindled.</p><p>Ten, nine, eight…</p><p>Enraged, the remaining bronze monks grew stronger individually, but they couldn't prevent their inevitable demise.</p><p>Just as the two were filled with joy, anticipating the Buddhist treasures within the pagoda, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>The remaining six bronze monks roared towards the heavens and hurled their bronze staffs into the air.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The bronze staffs collided, erupting in a blinding golden light.</p><p>The six monks leaped upwards, merging with the golden light. As they approached it, they seemed to melt as if being scorched by the sun, their bodies twisting into grotesque shapes.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A golden sun shone, radiating intense golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang and Venerable Zhenru's expressions changed drastically. They felt the terrifying power of the golden light, as if it could melt everything.</p><p>The golden light filled the space. Qin Sang's pale golden skin turned a deeper gold, and he felt as though his flesh and bones were about to dissolve.</p><p>The golden light was everywhere, and the True Treasure fragments were useless against it.</p><p>The Heaven's Eye Butterfly secretly used the Convergence and Dispersion Divine Light, but it only provided temporary relief.</p><p>Even more terrifying, the slain bronze monks began to melt as well, merging with the golden sun, further intensifying the power of the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't summoned his Astral Fire Shield yet, but Venerable Zhenru, struggling to hold on, couldn't endure any longer.</p><p>Moreover, Qin Sang estimated that even if he summoned the Astral Fire Shield when the golden light reached its peak, it would be useless.</p><p>He felt a mortal threat!</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Qin Sang roared. Venerable Zhenru's eyes were filled with unwillingness, but he could only retreat.</p><p>The moment they exited the archway, they appeared outside the Vajra Stupa Pagoda.</p><p>They had been so close to the Buddhist treasures.  Neither had anticipated such a transformation. Venerable Zhenru sighed, discouraged. With their current cultivation, they simply couldn't withstand the golden light.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, lost in thought. Finally, he suggested they rest and try again.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>The two entered the Vajra Stupa Pagoda once more, only to be defeated by the golden light again.</p><p>“We cannot overcome this obstacle in such a short time,” Qin Sang declared.</p><p>Venerable Zhenru said gravely, “Forgive this humble monk's presumption, but could Fellow Daoist trade the 'Seven Masters Buddhist Seal' to our temple? This humble monk will do my utmost to satisfy Fellow Daoist’s requests.”</p><p>Qin Sang guessed that Venerable Zhenru wanted to use this Buddhist seal to seek help from someone with higher cultivation.</p><p>Just the 'Seven Masters Buddhist Seal' itself would be fine, but Qin Sang suspected it might be the disassembled Great Vajra Wheel Seal, something he couldn't easily divulge.</p><p>In truth, he hadn't used his full power.</p><p>Although the Vermillion Bird Spirit hadn't awakened, he could still barely summon the nine divine birds on the Solar Divine Tree.</p><p>But their goal was to find treasures, not to fight enemies. The sixth level's space was small, and if the nine birds clashed with the golden sun, they would have nowhere to hide.</p><p>Furthermore, caution was paramount. He couldn't afford to exert his full strength here.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered and said, "To be honest with Venerable One, this Buddhist seal of mine is not yet complete. Moreover, I sense that this seal has a special resistance to the golden light. Would Venerable One be willing to wait a while longer?"</p><p>If his feeling was correct, fusing the seven seals might give him a chance to resist the golden light and break the final seal.</p>
