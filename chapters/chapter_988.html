<h1>Chapter 980: Wanted</h1><p>Chapter 980: Wanted</p><p>Sensing the might of the sword wheel and the Nine Nether Demon Fire, the steward, a man surnamed Liu, was filled with terror.  He finally realized the caliber of his opponent and frantically channeled his true energy into his magic treasure.  The square mirror shone blindingly, forming a protective shield. Under its protection, Steward Liu dashed outward. He had given up all thought of resistance, his only desire to escape, the further the better!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The sword wheel struck the square mirror.  The mirror trembled, cracks spider-webbing across the protective shield. Steward Liu groaned, his face turning ashen. Before he could stabilize the mirror, the Nine Nether Demon Fire arrived.</p><p>*Whoosh whoosh…*</p><p>The demon fire’s power surpassed even the sword wheel.  A hissing sound filled the air as black flames engulfed the entire shield, seeping through the cracks.  Steward Liu struggled desperately, his movements frantic.</p><p>Just then, another booming sound echoed.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A fist slammed into the square mirror. Qin Sang appeared out of thin air.</p><p>A tremendous force struck, sending Steward Liu sprawling to his knees with a cry, blood spraying from his mouth. He tried to resist, but it was too late.</p><p>The Nine Nether Demon Fire seized the opportunity, breaking through the barrier and transforming into several chains of flame.  Steward Liu felt his consciousness waver. When he regained his senses, he found himself bound by the fiery chains, unable to move. His dantian was like stagnant water, his true energy completely sealed.</p><p>Despair filled his face. He never imagined Qin Sang would suddenly attack, and that he would be utterly helpless, not even having a chance to escape.</p><p>The battle ended incredibly quickly, the victor decided in a flash. The maidservants on the first floor were blissfully unaware, still playing and laughing.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang landed beside Steward Liu, his wings retracting as he coldly surveyed the man. Bai also appeared in the quiet room, having secretly suppressed the battle's fluctuations. He looked at Qin Sang and sighed, "You have so many enemies; you run into one so casually."</p><p>Steward Liu opened his mouth, his voice bitter, "Where did I slip up?"</p><p>At this moment, he harbored no illusions, understanding that he had been exposed long ago.</p><p>"You shouldn't have used Old Man Zou to deceive me," Qin Sang sneered, his tone light. "You should know what I want to know. Will you confess willingly, or shall I help you open your mouth?"</p><p>Steward Liu was silent for a moment, then sighed deeply.  "I'll tell you, I only hope you'll give me a quick death… It wasn't that I wanted to harm you.  It's just that the Deputy Head recently sent a message. The Chamber of Commerce secretly issued a warrant for the Daoist's arrest, ordering all stewards to report his sighting immediately. The reward is incredibly high. As for the reason, I know nothing, but the Deputy Head mentioned that the order came directly from the Chamber of Commerce. I dared not disobey…"</p><p>"The Chamber of Commerce is secretly hunting me?"</p><p>Hearing this shocking news, Qin Sang's expression changed drastically.  He had maintained a detached relationship with the Chamber of Commerce, only Old Man Zou acting as a liaison. He had never clashed with the Chamber and had even earned several merits. Why would they issue a warrant for his arrest?</p><p>"The Deputy Head already knows of the Daoist's presence and is on his way…"</p><p>Having accepted his fate, Steward Liu withheld nothing.  Without Qin Sang needing to use soul-searching techniques, he revealed everything.</p><p>After hearing the story, Qin Sang's mind raced.</p><p>The warrant was issued recently, after the Seven Killing Hall incident. Everything was fine before entering the hall. After returning and with Old Man Zou's death, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. His troubles increased.  He had become a wanted criminal of the Chamber of Commerce.</p><p>"The Chamber of Commerce has confirmed Old Man Zou's death. Someone wants to settle scores with Old Man Zou's faction, or…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, suddenly remembering a terrifying possibility.</p><p>"Could it be him?"</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai exchanged a look, both having reached the same conclusion.</p><p>The timing was too coincidental.  They had just thwarted the opponent's plot in the Seven Killing Hall, and now the opponent was coming after them.</p><p>"Our plan was perfect, leaving no openings. We left the Seven Killing Hall using the power of the Nine-Phoenix King.  Logically, he shouldn't be able to find you this quickly… Think about it, do you have any other enemies? To force the Chamber of Commerce's hand, their influence must be immense, likely a Yuan Ying cultivator!"  Bai said gravely.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, "The Nine-Phoenix King and Mo Qingzhu are unlikely. The Lan Dou Gate, Black Snake Mountain… they do have the ability, but I dealt with them using my true form, not the Qingfeng identity. Unless… the matter of killing the junior brother from Black Snake Mountain was somehow leaked…"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang remain silent for a long time, Bai couldn't help but complain, "How many Yuan Ying cultivators have you offended?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>He's always been low-key, minding his own business. He didn't want to make these enemies.</p><p>"What do we do? That deputy should know something.  Even if he's a late-stage Jindan cultivator and brings a few men, we have a good chance of taking him down with our strength." Bai said, changing his tone.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated. "I'm afraid he's already informed the mastermind.  Then we'll be facing a Yuan Ying cultivator instead. We'll be playing with fire."</p><p>"Let's go!" Bai said. "It's better to live to fight another day. We'll find out the truth eventually."</p><p>Qin Sang looked down at the Liu family manager, lying on the ground, eyes closed, awaiting his fate.</p><p>"You were ruthless, so don't blame me for being the same! We can't leave empty-handed; let's collect some interest first." Qin Sang said resentfully.</p><p>Bai was also eager to act.</p><p>There weren't many experts in the branch, making capturing the Liu family manager easier.  Qin Sang didn't want to alert other forces and attract trouble, so he planned a low-key raid of the branch.</p><p>Just as he and Bai were about to split up, they sensed a Jindan cultivator entering the shop.</p><p>"Welcome, honored guest!" The servant girl greeted enthusiastically, it being their first customer of the day.</p><p>The newcomer was a thin young man, short and frail-looking. He hurried in, seemingly in a rush, his expression anxious and restless, frequently looking back.</p><p>Finally, the young man gritted his teeth and entered the shop.</p><p>Seeing the servant girl, he quickly composed himself, his gaze steady, even bearing a hint of authority. Without speaking, he produced a token and waved it at the servant girl. "I wish to see Manager Liu."</p><p>The servant girl, startled by the token, quickly bowed. "Respected senior, the manager is currently meeting with a guest upstairs in his private room."</p><p>Upstairs.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai exchanged glances.</p><p>"Someone from the Qiongyu Trading Company," Bai transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, his lips moving as he imitated the Manager Liu's voice, "Please come upstairs, friend."</p><p>The young man glanced upwards and strode up the stairs.</p><p>The servant girl didn't dare stop him.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>The young man pushed open the door.</p><p>Qin Sang was already prepared.</p><p>The young man was only an early-stage Jindan cultivator; subduing him would be child's play.</p><p>Qin Sang was about to strike.</p><p>Unexpectedly, upon seeing the cloaked Qin Sang, the young man's face lit up with surprise. He blurted out, "Senior, are you Daoist Qingfeng?"</p>
