<h1>Chapter 1331: A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix</h1><p>An unprecedented phenomenon appeared at the entrance of the passage.</p><p>Multicolored rays continuously erupted from within, forming a colorful cloud in the void, gradually spreading outwards and becoming very conspicuous.</p><p>However, the thunder ring did not continue to expand; it hung far in the sky, embedded in the dark clouds.</p><p>If it weren't for the unwavering belief of True Person Canghong and others that Ye Laomo didn't have the ability to destroy the passage, everyone would have been restless long ago.</p><p>At this time, True Person Canghong and the Demon Lord Tongyou finally arrived.</p><p>Both groups of people hurried along, and they all noticed the strange phenomenon.</p><p>"Did Ye Laomo destroy all the ancient prohibitions of the entire restricted area?"</p><p>True Person Canghong looked towards the end of the stone path.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly described the scene in the restricted area, then turned his gaze to the passage in the sky, "True Person, did you foresee this phenomenon? Could it be Ye Laomo's doing?"</p><p>True Person Canghong's expression was calm, "The thunder wandering around the passage could kill us with a single strike. Even with Ye Laomo's incredible abilities, it's impossible for him to destroy the passage. At most, he's set up some obstacles to delay our progress.  Even if we rush there now, it will be useless. It's better to first investigate what Ye Laomo did here. If we can find any clues and determine his intentions, we can accomplish twice the result with half the effort!"</p><p>Everyone agreed, so they put aside other thoughts, formed a formation, and re-entered the restricted area.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at their previous location.</p><p>It was still deathly silent here, with no sign of Ye Laomo, nor any visible traps. Although Ye Laomo had broken part of the ancient prohibitions, many dangers still remained.</p><p>Working together, they passed through layer upon layer of ancient prohibitions and finally reached the end of the stone path, where they saw the seal!</p><p>"Ye Laomo is already gone!"</p><p>Qin Sang used his Heaven's Eye Divine Ability to confirm that Ye Laomo was not hiding nearby.</p><p>"There are cracks on the stone pillars. The seal has been broken..."</p><p>True Person Canghong flashed to the back of a stone pillar, his pupils shimmering with strange light. After investigating, he showed a surprised expression, "The seal was broken not long ago. Ye Laomo left just a short time ago!"</p><p>Of the three restricted areas, only the seal in this place had been broken by Ye Laomo.</p><p>It was no coincidence!</p><p>"For the past twenty years, has Ye Laomo been meticulously trying to break the seal here?"</p><p>Daoist Zhen's eyes widened in surprise, looking down at the muddy pool in the center of the four stone pillars, "What was sealed in the restricted area that he released?"</p><p>True Person Canghong and the cultivators of the Abyss of Sin all shook their heads.</p><p>This place was a restricted area precisely because of the powerful and dangerous ancient prohibitions. Countless cultivators from the Abyss of Sin had attempted to explore the restricted area, all failing.</p><p>Before this, they could only guess randomly about the function of the stone pillars.</p><p>The remaining traces indicated that the sealing power here was extremely strong. It was unknown how Ye Laomo managed to open the restricted area and destroy the seal single-handedly.</p><p>Qin Sang flew to the side of the stone pillars, examined them for a moment, easily found several cracks in the seal, and flashed over, ordering the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to use its divine ability to investigate.</p><p>"It's empty... unfortunately, the traces have been destroyed by the filth."</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly, "There must have been a demon sealed here originally!"</p><p>Everyone's expressions varied.</p><p>Even in the Blood Lake, a demon could survive to the present day, its consciousness having only recently perished. It was normal for a demon sealed in the restricted area to still be alive.</p><p>The doubt in True Person Canghong's heart finally cleared, and he couldn't help but feel furious, "The remnant souls of the demons we killed must be related to this demon! The Blood Lake incident was a trap they set, the Jade Bone Brocade Skin and the Youjing Tower, as well as the Nascent Souls of those fellow cultivators, were all key to the demon's escape!"</p><p>He was close to guessing the truth.</p><p>Qin Sang circled the four stone pillars several times, occasionally using the Ebony Sword to touch them, testing the power of the seal, "The demon and Ye Laomo have both disappeared, so we cannot judge their purpose. Perhaps Ye Laomo was also acting against his will, merely a manipulated pawn."</p><p>On Yitian Peak of the Seven Killing Palace, Qin Sang had witnessed the tragic fate of the three great merchant alliance leaders being controlled by a demon lord, and subconsciously guessed in that direction.</p><p>But that was merely a fraction of the demon lord's soul.</p><p>Ye Laomo's cultivation base was comparable to the three great merchant alliance leaders. If he were also controlled by an ancient demon, the outcome would likely not be much better.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes were heavy, and his greatest fear had come to pass.</p><p>Below Yitian Peak, so many top experts from the Canglang Sea had paid the price of their lives, and only with the help of an ancient seal were they able to barely suppress the demon lord.</p><p>The seal here had been broken, and the demon had escaped!</p><p>The only good news was that the power of this seal was far less than that of Yitian Peak.</p><p>Yi Tian Peak not only houses the three clans' ancient prohibitions, but also their precious treasures, used in conjunction with the prohibitions to suppress the Demon Lord.  Yet, here stand only four rough stone pillars.</p><p>Though the material seems extraordinary, it's certainly inferior to the Demon Subduing Stele or the Dragon Corpse.</p><p>This suggests the being sealed here isn't of the Demon Lord's caliber, and the situation isn't irretrievable.</p><p>Qin Sang informed Qing Jun of her discovery, instructing her to prepare the Demon Binding Rope. Fortunately, her senior sister had perfected the formation diagram during her seclusion; this artifact might prove useful.</p><p>"It seems we must meet the old demon, Ye, to understand his intentions! We have a new enemy, but the demon lord, having only recently escaped, must still be weak. With the North Star Realm's experts gathered, we need not fear..."</p><p>"The passage's anomaly must be the demon lord's doing!"</p><p>"We mustn't linger here. We must leave immediately."</p><p>...</p><p>The demon lord is unfathomable.</p><p>A sense of urgency gripped the group. They made an immediate decision, turning to leave the forbidden area.</p><p>Then, Qing Jun spoke, "You go ahead. I'll try to analyze the seal; I might discover something. It won't take long. I'll catch up soon."</p><p>Qin Sang worried about her senior sister being alone, but they couldn't both stay. After consulting with Jing Yu, he said to Qing Jun, "Jing Yu Daoist, please stay as well.  If anything happens, you can look out for her."</p><p>He had Bai and his Nascent Soul puppet, so his safety wasn't a concern.</p><p>Qing Jun readily agreed, thanking Jing Yu.</p><p>The group swiftly flew out of the forbidden area and sped towards the passage.</p><p>After they left...</p><p>Jing Yu stood on the stone path, summoning the Thunder Bead. Its light illuminated all directions as he stood guard, watching Qing Jun's actions with curiosity, wondering what she planned to do.</p><p>Qing Jun circled the seal briefly, then passed through the crack and entered the mire!</p><p>Though broken, the seal's remaining power was still formidable.</p><p>Qing Jun had preemptively summoned the Five Directions Pagoda, hovering above her for protection.  Meanwhile, her jade fingers moved like wheels, casting a flurry of hand seals.</p><p>Finally, she swept her sleeve, and the Qingluan puppet, cloaked in the Jiangshan Yin Yue map, flew out.</p><p>Simultaneously, dozens, perhaps hundreds, of green lights appeared around her.  As Qing Jun imbued the lights with puppet seals, they transformed into lifelike Qingluan birds.</p><p>A hundred birds paying homage to the phoenix!</p><p>The Qingluan birds danced around Qing Jun, emitting pleasant chirps.  They were incredibly agile, graceful, and their eyes shone with intelligence, seemingly searching for something.</p><p>Jing Yu, witnessing this technique for the first time, was deeply amazed.</p>
