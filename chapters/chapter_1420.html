<h1>Chapter 1412: Separation</h1><p>Chapter 1412: Separation</p><p>This was the innate ability of the Tidal Horseshoe Crab.</p><p>The Four-Change Spirit Insect, possessing extraordinary abilities, though no match for the Black Bamboo Staff, successfully acted as a buffer, saving the life of the female cultivator surnamed Wang.</p><p>The Demon-Mixing Elder missed his attack.</p><p>A look of surprise flickered across his face, but this didn't affect his decision-making.</p><p>The Black Bamboo Staff didn't pursue the female cultivator surnamed Wang.</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang only had her Nascent Soul remaining, and having been forced to use instant movement to escape, she was severely weakened and posed no threat.</p><p>The Black Bamboo Staff, forceful and unrelenting, continued its advance, smashing towards Master Mu!</p><p>At this moment, the female cultivator surnamed Wang's Nascent Soul was weak and teetering.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Qi was entangled by the Restraint-Keeping Real Person.</p><p>The Demon-Mixing Elder didn't even glance at them, heading straight for Qin Sang and Master Mu, who posed the greatest threat to him.</p><p>Master Mu's eyes were calm.</p><p>He recalled the Tidal Horseshoe Crab, his palm slightly clenched, retracting his snake spear.  The snake armor protected his body as he braced against the Black Bamboo Staff. Just as he was about to spear the Demon-Mixing Elder, he saw the Elder let out a chilling, eerie smile.</p><p>A dark shadow flickered behind the Demon-Mixing Elder. A head emerged from behind his neck, peering over his shoulder, staring fixedly at Master Mu.</p><p>This head wasn't solid; it seemed to be a disembodied spirit.</p><p>The spirit's eye sockets were pale and empty.</p><p>Being stared at by the spirit felt like being targeted by something utterly terrifying.</p><p>A chill ran down Master Mu's spine.</p><p>At that moment, Master Mu recalled various rumors about the Demon-Mixing Elder.</p><p>A warning bell sounded in Master Mu's heart. He muttered, "Not good."</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The spirit suddenly opened its mouth, emitting a piercing shriek, like demonic sound.</p><p>The moment Master Mu heard the shriek, his head buzzed.  He felt his mind assaulted by the demonic sound, his primordial spirit experiencing a sharp pain, causing a moment of sluggishness.</p><p>Master Mu was greatly startled and quickly sealed his five senses.</p><p>The Demon-Mixing Elder's next move surprised everyone.</p><p>He didn't take advantage of the situation to attack Master Mu. Instead, he flung his withered hand, sending the Demon-Mixing Order towards the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>The Demon-Mixing Elder attacked.</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang was incapacitated.</p><p>Master Mu's primordial spirit was assaulted.</p><p>All this happened incredibly fast, in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang was enduring the first wave of Buddha light and crimson flames.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>One was to ignore what was happening behind him, continue forward, and leave directly.</p><p>With the Thousand Buddha Wall as a barrier, the Demon-Mixing Elder wouldn't be able to catch up to him immediately, ensuring his safety.</p><p>But this would leave Master Mu and the others in danger.</p><p>Even at their peak, Master Mu and the others were no match for the Demon-Mixing Elder and the Restraint-Keeping Real Person. What's more, the Demon-Mixing Elder seemed to know the Pure Ocean Sect better than they did.</p><p>The second was to retreat and save them.</p><p>Almost without hesitation, Qin Sang chose the second option. He couldn't let Master Mu fall here.</p><p>As for Qi and Wang, he could only do his best.</p><p>Qin Sang assessed the strengths of both sides. Based on his past experience, using several of his abilities and joining forces with Master Mu, they should be able to put up a fight against the Demon-Mixing Elder.</p><p>At least, the Demon-Mixing Elder wouldn't easily kill him.</p><p>If Master Mu and the others fell here…</p><p>Left alone, if he encountered the Demon-Mixing Elder again, he would be at a significant disadvantage.</p><p>More Nascent Soul cultivators would arrive later.</p><p>These people feared the Demon-Mixing Elder, but had no connection with him. His situation would become even more difficult; he might not get any treasures and would be driven out of the Pure Ocean Sect.</p><p>There was another reason for going back to help.</p><p>By showing kindness to Master Mu, when he later inquired about Hundred Flowers Valley, Master Mu wouldn't have a reason to refuse.</p><p>Weighing the pros and cons…</p><p>Qin Sang fully activated the Golden Sinking Sword, deploying the Seven Souls Killing Formation.</p><p>The power of the sword formation was vast, resisting the Buddha light and crimson flames.</p><p>The pressure on him eased slightly. Qin Sang saw Master Mu being hit.  He was about to use a forbidden technique, releasing his Nascent Soul puppet to save him, when he saw the Demon-Mixing Order flying towards him.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Demon-Mixing Order transformed into a hundred-zhang-tall phantom, its momentum earth-shattering, and slammed into the Thousand Buddha Wall!</p><p>The Buddha light and crimson flames, which had originally maintained a delicate balance, were disrupted by the force of the Demon-Mixing Order and instantly went haywire.</p><p>Especially in the gap where Qin Sang was located.</p><p>Crimson-gold light surged like a tidal wave from both sides, about to engulf the gap in the blink of an eye. Qin Sang's vision blurred, and he felt an extreme sense of danger.</p><p>“No good!”</p><p>Qin Sang guessed the old man Hun Mo's intentions and was extremely anxious.</p><p>Hun Mo, having been discovered, quickly adapted, abandoning his plan to kill the four of them there.</p><p>He knew that if he attacked Valley Master Mu, once Qin Sang escaped, the two would join forces, and even he would struggle to kill them both.</p><p>One was the Valley Master of Hundred Flowers Valley, whose reputation stretched from String Moon Realm to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>The other's identity was unknown, yet they could sense his presence; clearly a formidable individual.</p><p>Neither were ordinary mid-Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Delay was dangerous.</p><p>Therefore, Hun Mo decided to disrupt the Thousand Buddha Wall, forcing Qin Sang to retreat, dividing his opponents to conquer them one by one.</p><p>Leaving Valley Master Mu alone would be far easier.</p><p>Even if he couldn't catch Qin Sang afterward, with only one left, they wouldn't pose much of a threat.</p><p>The Thousand Buddha Wall roared continuously.</p><p>Some of the 'd' glyphs shone brightly, others shattered.</p><p>The intense flames surged across the wall like a torrent.</p><p>The balance was broken; the surface of the wall instantly became incredibly chaotic.</p><p>Qin Sang's vision was filled with only gold and red; Mu and the others were lost to sight.</p><p>Wave after wave of ferocious power crashed down, incredibly powerful.</p><p>If Qin Sang tried to break out now, he would be instantly annihilated.</p><p>His escape route was cut off; he could only abandon the rescue, pass through the wall, and leave this dangerous place.</p><p>"Grand cultivator, indeed cunning and treacherous..."</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled.</p><p>He had to admit Hun Mo's plan was incredibly successful.</p><p>However, he was not without means of retaliation!</p><p>A cold smile played on Qin Sang's lips. Ignoring the surging Buddhist light and flames, he activated the corpse puppet bag at his waist, releasing a Nascent Soul puppet to shield him.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The first wave struck.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet fought bravely, its puppet seals surging, protecting Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the puppet, flicked his sleeve, and sent eighteen demonic banners flying.  Nine Netherworld demonic fire formed a dragon, seemingly scrutinizing the battlefield beyond the wall.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang hissed.</p><p>While the puppet deflected another wave, the fire dragon roared, its target not the outside of the wall, but the wall itself!</p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p>The demonic fire smashed into the wall, causing even greater chaos.  Some of the Buddhist light and flames, at the moment of impact, were redirected by Qin Sang through the demonic fire towards Hun Mo.</p><p>By this time, the incoming force had almost filled the cracks.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet was teetering.</p><p>Qin Sang knew this was his limit.  He withdrew the puppet and turned to leave.</p><p>Outside the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>Hun Mo, certain Qin Sang couldn't escape, was about to attack Valley Master Mu when he sensed something amiss and looked sharply towards the wall.</p>
