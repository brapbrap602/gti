Chapter 633: Revenge

When Qin Sang encountered Yuan Hu earlier, he had noticed something unusual about the tattoos on the two priests of the Crescent Moon Village. Now, witnessing the female priest's dance, he finally saw the complete picture.

"Could it be a type of divine inscription?"

Qin Sang murmured, staring at the female priest.

He discovered that after the divine inscriptions on the female priest's body surfaced, a peculiar power he had never seen before drifted from the distant tribespeople.

Some of it converged on the female priest, while a portion floated into the mountains, absorbed by the other priests of the Winged Serpent Village.

After absorbing this power, the divine inscriptions on the female priest's body visibly intensified.

‘Whoosh!’

With the eruption of the divine inscription's power, the female priest suddenly raised her arms in a frenzy, uttering strange cries towards the heavens, as if attempting to fly into the sky.

The bright moon remained undisturbed.

However, a light drizzle began to fall around the Winged Serpent Village.

The tribespeople cheered, regarding it as a sweet rain bestowed by their deity. They raised their faces and opened their mouths to catch the raindrops.

"What peculiar divine inscriptions!"

Qin Sang exclaimed in admiration.

He had initially assumed that shamanic rituals were merely a means for shaman-cultivators to control ordinary people. Now, it seemed things were not so simple.

This rain was clearly summoned by the female priest, but Qin Sang hadn't detected her using any incantations. It was purely the power of the divine inscriptions that influenced the weather.

To Qin Sang, the power of the divine inscriptions on the female priest was weak. However, he could discern that these inscriptions were extraordinary, likely a unique ability of the tribespeople.

He even felt that the divine inscriptions held greater potential than natal Gu insects.

Natal Gu insects were external objects, while divine inscriptions were inseparable from the cultivator, a power they controlled themselves.

Yet, for some unknown reason, the tribespeople seemed to regard natal Gu insects as their most important tool, neglecting the divine inscriptions. Even Yuan Hu and Cui Xuanzi of the Five Venom Sect didn't have any divine inscriptions on their bodies.

Why did the Five Venom Sect abandon this path that was clearly so suitable for shaman-cultivators?

Were the divine inscriptions without prospects?

Or was it that, like the human race, the tribespeople had lost many things from ancient times to the present?

Qin Sang fell into deep thought.

Just then, the female priest changed to a different shamanic dance. The rain gradually stopped, and she pointed towards a wooden building by the lake. The moonlight converged, illuminating the area in front of the building as bright as day.

There, the "holy maidens," each pure and beautiful, dressed in ornate feathered robes, held various exotic flowers and herbs, forming a line. Guided by the moonlight, they walked towards the mountain.

These exotic flowers and herbs were, in fact, spiritual medicines. The maiden at the front held a spiritual herb with blood-red leaves – the Red Leaf Herb.

They ascended a stone staircase, leading to a cave.

The cave was pitch black, with occasional hissing sounds emanating from within. Some of the holy maidens were pale with fear, while others held anticipation.

No one noticed the slight trembling of the hands of the maiden at the front, holding the Red Leaf Herb.

Qin Sang stood silently in the shadows, his hands clasped behind his back.

Finally, the procession of holy maidens reached the cave entrance.

The maiden at the front only needed to take one step to enter, but she suddenly stopped.

The female priest, not expecting this, paused her dance, her eyes flashing with anger. She pointed at the maiden. The moonlight gathered behind the maiden, about to push her inside.

Suddenly, a dazzling azure sword light flashed from the maiden!

In that instant, even the bright moon in the sky seemed to dim.

A dragon-like sword cry instantly overwhelmed the rumbling war drums, echoing through the mountains and valleys, as if countless sharp swords were unsheathed, shaking heaven and earth!

The female priest was aghast, her face filled with shock.

A thunderous roar erupted from the mountain, "Who dares disrupt our tribe's grand undertaking! Show yourself!"

Then, the trees swayed as several figures rushed out from the dense forest. The elder leading the group glared furiously at Ya Gu and the Cold Gold Sword in her hand.

With his discerning eye, he could naturally tell that the sword wasn't controlled by Ya Gu; someone else was behind it!

What unsettled the elder was that he couldn't sense anyone hiding around, nor could he detect the presence of the hidden person through the Cold Gold Sword.

Someone had infiltrated the village without his knowledge. The unease in the elder's heart grew stronger. He roared, "Bone Formation!"

Around the Winged Serpent Village, cracking sounds suddenly emanated from the ground. Then, skeletons, some animal bones and some human bones, none complete, erupted from the earth.

The eerie white bones appeared even more ghastly under the moonlight, frightening many of the young women into tears.

With the appearance of the Bone Formation, blue flames, like a blue galaxy, drifted towards Ya Gu from the gaps between the bones, seemingly slow but actually fast.

Ya Gu appeared to neither hear nor see anything. Gripping the Cold Gold Sword tightly, she suddenly slashed towards the cave.

The sword light was intensely bright, blinding to look at directly.

‘Boom!’

With a loud explosion, the cave collapsed.

Rubble flew, mixed with several severed snake corpses.

"No!"

The elder, the female priest, and the others paled and cried out in anguish. Their natal Gu insects were easily severed by this sword strike, without any resistance.

Terrified, they realized the hidden person was extremely formidable, capable of easily killing them. They abandoned even the Bone Formation and turned to flee.

Ya Gu turned around and delivered a second sword strike, shattering the blue flames of the Bone Formation.

For the third sword strike, Ya Gu hesitated for a moment, but ultimately swung it resolutely.

"You all deserve to die!"

Ya Gu's eyes were bloodshot, her heart filled with vengeful rage. The sword in her hand and the hidden person had given her the courage to finally unleash her hatred.

Even when cursing, her voice was beautiful. However, aside from Qin Sang, the others were clearly in no mood to appreciate it.

The female priest had already escaped to the center of the lake when she suddenly felt a chill in her chest. Looking down, she saw the tip of a sword slide across her chest. Her body separated, falling into the lake.

Ya Gu, gripping the Cold Gold Sword, had killed her first person.

Splattered with the female priest's blood, she gasped for breath, surrounded by the thick stench of blood, nearly suffocating.

Qin Sang, utterly ruthless, didn't shield her from the blood.

The three sword strikes seemed to have exhausted Ya Gu's strength. However, she still struggled to raise the Cold Gold Sword, aiming it at the elder and the others who had fled into the deep mountains.

‘Whoosh!’

The Cold Gold Sword carried Ya Gu, instantly catching up to them. The first to die was the slick youth, decapitated by a single stroke. His head flew into the air.

One by one, the priests of the Winged Serpent Village were slain by Ya Gu.

Blood stained the leaves along the way.

Finally, only the elder remained. His face was filled with resentment as he cried out frantically, "Who are you! We have no grievance, why slaughter my entire clan!"

‘Thud!’

The Cold Gold Sword pierced the elder's heart.

"Kill! Kill! Kill!"

Ya Gu's eyes were crimson, consumed by killing intent.  She kept muttering "kill" as she withdrew the Cold Gold Sword, about to hack the elder's corpse to pieces. She was still struggling when a hand restrained her.

"Sleep."

Upon hearing this gentle voice, the killing intent in Ya Gu's heart instantly receded like a tide. She obediently closed her eyes and fell into a deep sleep.
