<h1>Chapter 2116: Completion of the Thunder Altar</h1><p>Previously, Qin Sang had always felt a sense of precariousness, like being adrift in a storm. Now, with the Thunder Altar completed, a heavy weight finally lifted from his heart.</p><p>His divine sense sank into the altar. A 'page' formed from pure雷霆, radiating a dark, ethereal light.</p><p>It was the same Thunder Summoning Oath, but because of the differences in the refiners and the harnessed thunder energies, the emanating fluctuations were distinctly different.</p><p>Fused with the might of the Azure Phoenix True Thunder, Qin Sang found it difficult to determine the true power of this Thunder Summoning Oath once activated. But he was certain that it would undoubtedly surpass the Moonriver Cove Thunder Altar!</p><p>Each time his divine sense touched the current Thunder Altar, Qin Sang felt a tremor, lamenting its limitations. This Thunder Summoning Oath was born from the altar, completed with the assistance of numerous altar masters.  The altar formation itself functioned as a 'talismanic disc,' and the oath was inherently bound to it. Unlike an independent talisman, it couldn't be separated from the altar and carried around.</p><p>In other words, Qin Sang could only unleash the Thunder Summoning Oath within Storm Realm.</p><p>He aspired to one day refine a true fourth-order thunder talisman, independent of the altar, allowing him to stand his ground against anyone below the Body Integration realm.</p><p>As for reaching the realm where he could inscribe fourth-order thunder talismans in mid-air, Qin Sang dared not dream of it, even after reaching the late Soul Formation stage.</p><p>Besides completing the Thunder Summoning Oath, Qin Sang’s personal gains were also immense. It was as if a gate had opened, and countless epiphanies flooded his mind. His comprehension of the Dao of Talismans ascended to a new level.  Looking back at those third-order thunder talismans, they now seemed less complex and profound, including his third-order Dharmic technique, the Five Thunders Secret Technique - Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal!</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, and the recently subsided thunder stirred once more.</p><p>'Rumble…*Crack!'  The sky flashed and roared with thunder, the lightning dazzling.  At the heart of the lightning, the faint shape of a thunder seal could be seen.</p><p>Qin Sang's brows furrowed slightly, seemingly dissatisfied. With a thought, the thunder seal dissipated, but the thunder in the sky grew even fiercer, silver serpents dancing wildly.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang raised an arm, pointed a finger at the heavens, and gently swayed it. The thunder, potent enough to obliterate all the peaks of the Azure Ram Temple, now obeyed him completely, dancing in sync with his finger.</p><p>The thunder gathered and dispersed, transforming endlessly.  After several transformations, it would condense into a thunder seal once again, only to dissipate shortly after.</p><p>The thunder seals scattered and reformed, seemingly identical each time, all bearing the form of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, indistinguishable from one another.</p><p>Only Qin Sang knew that with every reformation of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, his understanding deepened.</p><p>In such a short time, his progress was beyond imagination!</p><p>Years ago, the Dao Court channeled the power of the Thunder Ancestor into him, using him as a conduit to unleash the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal. Qin Sang, experiencing this firsthand, grasped its profound mysteries. After reaching Soul Formation, he hadn’t spent much time on it, yet his comprehension of this talisman surpassed others of the same realm.  To this day, it remained one of his most potent combat methods.</p><p>However, that was ultimately imparted to him by another.  Having recently broken through to mid-Soul Formation, Qin Sang still didn't fully grasp the underlying principles of some aspects. Hence, he was still some distance from truly mastering the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.</p><p>Constructing the Thunder Altar and inscribing the fourth-order thunder talisman had filled in the gaps in his understanding.</p><p>As Dharmic thunder talismans, they shared a common lineage.  Qin Sang drew parallels, combining them with his prior accumulation.  The two complemented each other perfectly, resolving all his doubts as if water flowing into its natural course.</p><p>After the thunder seal had condensed countless times in the sky, Qin Sang finally stopped. He looked up, reached out with his palm, and the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal trembled slightly, descending from the heavens.</p><p>A sparkling thunder seal landed in Qin Sang's palm, containing within it an extremely violent and destructive power.  Yet, Qin Sang held it casually, toying with it effortlessly.</p><p>This demonstrated the depth of his understanding of the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal.  Though pressed for time, Qin Sang hadn't fully grasped a few key points and hadn't truly mastered the talisman yet. But he was confident that he only needed a short period of secluded cultivation to digest his recent gains and ponder these remaining questions to achieve mastery!</p><p>The Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, carrying the profound essence of the High Divine Firmament Scripture’s third-order Dharmic technique, the Five Thunders Secret Technique, normally required at least late Soul Formation cultivation to comprehend.  Qin Sang's achieving this in mid-Soul Formation was exceedingly rare, even within the Dao Court.</p><p>This was one of the reasons he insisted on constructing the Thunder Altar.</p><p>This wasn't the end. Qin Sang gazed at the thunder seal in his hand.  His wings fluttered gently, and threads of azure light separated from his phoenix wings, leaping between his feathers and flowing down his arm, gradually merging into the thunder seal, replacing its internal thunder energy.</p><p>Gradually, the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal transformed into an azure thunder seal, resembling a jade carving.</p><p>At Moonriver Cove, Qin Sang could barely condense a thunder seal using the Azure Phoenix True Thunder, and it was unstable, its power incomparable to what it was now.</p><p>Now, if Qin Sang faced the Hound Seal Clan expert again, he wouldn't need to summon both his Dharma Body and Dharma Image, nor use the Sun Wheel Seal to break free from the opponent's Heavenly Might. This thunder seal alone would be enough to contend with him!</p><p>With more and more trump cards at his disposal, Qin Sang's confidence grew.  He gently shook his hand, and the thunder seal vanished silently.</p><p>The celestial phenomena dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't leave, remaining seated on the altar, continuing to inscribe talismans.</p><p>Before constructing the altar, he had considered the impending threat of the Stygian Clan army.  He couldn't simply unleash the Thunder Summoning Oath immediately and needed other means to maneuver and create an opening.</p><p>The Thunder Altar in Storm Realm could also be inscribed with other third-order thunder talismans, which, when activated through the altar, would still possess considerable power. As long as he didn't inscribe another fourth-order thunder talisman, he needn't worry about conflicts with the Thunder Summoning Oath or exceeding the altar's capacity.</p><p>Qin Sang could inscribe third-order thunder talismans and control the altar himself without further assistance.</p><p>Qin Sang devoted himself entirely, oblivious to the passage of time, stopping only after completing all his plans.  Now, all that remained was to await the Stygian Clan army!</p><p>One day, a talismanic message roused Qin Sang from his cultivation.</p><p>Within the message was a crystal the size of a baby's fist, a spirit object capable of recording images.</p><p>Upon seeing the recorded scene, Qin Sang left a Dharma Body behind and walked out of the valley. Li Yufu, Shen Chen, and others were already waiting outside.</p><p>"Martial Uncle!"</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Everyone greeted Qin Sang with a respectful bow.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at them, seeing worry and unease on their faces, but no panic.</p><p>Over the years, Qin Sang had pushed them relentlessly, applying pressure and forcing all the clans and sects of Storm Realm to prepare for war.  This situation was within his expectations.</p><p>"Go. Proceed according to plan," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's composure, everyone felt reassured and dispersed to their respective duties.</p><p>Qin Sang left Azure Ram Temple and traveled westward to meet Si Lu.</p><p>"Brother Qin!"</p><p>Si Lu rose to greet him, his expression grave. Qin Sang had already informed them of the situation through the altar.</p><p>At this moment, Storm Realm was in motion, armies converging on the west, all altar masters returning to their posts, poised for action.</p><p>“Brother Qin, have you discovered who the Lu family has sent?”</p><p>Si Lu couldn't help asking.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist will see for yourself.”</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang took out the crystal, infused it with true essence, and activated the recording, which depicted the Stygian Clan army emerging from the teleportation hall.</p><p>Upon seeing the first person to emerge, Si Lu said in a low voice, "This is the Lu family's Grand Offering!"</p><p>Qin Sang observed carefully. The crystal could only record appearances, revealing the Grand Offering's extraordinary presence, but nothing more.</p><p>"What do you know about the Grand Offering?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>“Most of my clan’s strength lies in our companion beasts.  The Grand Offering’s two known companion beasts both possess extraordinary abilities, their powers matching the descriptions in our ancient texts. The other two, however, are mysterious companion beasts unrecorded in even our clan’s records. Their powers are unknown, and I have no idea how he obtained them. During the great chaos years ago, Minister Xia said it was fortunate that we acted swiftly and weren't intercepted by the Grand Offering.  Otherwise, we would never have escaped.”</p><p>Si Lu quickly described what he knew using sound transmission.</p><p>As more Stygian Clan members emerged from the hall, Si Lu continued, “This is Lu Gan, a general under Lu Wang!”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “He's the one who fought me before!”</p><p>Shortly after Lu Gan appeared, a palanquin came into view.</p><p>“This is Lu Wang’s throne, a treasured artifact passed down within the Hanjiang Lu family.  The person beside Lu Wang must be the Grand Tutor. I don't know much about him.”</p><p>Even though it was just a recording, Si Lu couldn't help but tense up as he saw the numerous enemy experts.</p><p>When the Yuanxiang Clan Leader attacked and the Stygian Clan members within the hall were forced back, a glint flashed in Si Lu’s eyes.  “They are all elites of the Hanjiang Lu family.  There are no Imperial Guards!”</p><p>“So, the Imperial family only sent a Grand Tutor?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  This was undoubtedly good news. It indicated that the Imperial family hadn't completely sided with the Hanjiang Lu family.  Otherwise, with the Imperial family's resources, even with the Thunder Altar, he would face a fierce battle if they attacked with full force.</p><p>As long as he could severely cripple the Lu family, the Imperial family's stance could still be changed.</p><p>“The enemy is at the gates. They will arrive soon. We should make preparations, sweep our courtyard…”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, his gaze fixed on the west, and continued calmly, “and await our distinguished guests!”</p><p>… As Storm Realm was busily preparing for war, the Stygian Clan army was marching eastward.</p><p>To avoid alarming the tribes along the way, their route was circuitous, a journey of countless miles.  Traveling day and night, they were finally approaching the territory of the Long Right Clan.</p><p>The Long Right Clan’s territory was shrouded in layers of mist, a complex terrain favored by many cultivators seeking secluded cultivation or hidden treasures.  But now, not a single person could be seen within tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>Shadows suddenly appeared on the sea surface.  A fleet of flying ships followed a palanquin, moving through the air without concealment, stirring up towering waves, their presence imposing.</p><p>'Boom!' The palanquin stopped abruptly before a bank of mist.</p><p>Inside, Clan Leader Min Zhuo pointed ahead.  "Your Majesty Lu Wang, passing through this mist is my clan's territory. My clansmen are ready and waiting for your command!"</p><p>When the army passed through the mist and arrived near the Holybath Plains, as Min Zhuo had said, banners lined the ground below.</p><p>The Long Right Clan army had long since assembled to await them.</p><p>Min Zhuo knew that once involved, the Long Right Clan couldn’t extricate themselves. He had left some elites and talented juniors behind, but the rest had joined the battlefield, displaying a resolve to fight to the death.</p><p>Both sides understood that the Long Right Clan's strength wouldn’t be decisive, but Min Zhuo’s attitude pleased Lu Wang.</p><p>“I understand Clan Leader Min Zhuo’s resolve. Lu Gan, you go with Clan Leader Min Zhuo and select some experts to incorporate into our ranks. Hmm, let the others follow as well to bolster our forces," Lu Wang commanded.</p><p>Lu Gan and Min Zhuo accepted the order and departed.</p><p>The integration was swift. The selected experts were taken away by Lu Gan, leaving only two close confidants with Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo called one of them closer and set up a concealing barrier. “Has there been any change in the Tainted Lands while I was away?”</p><p>The confidant shook his head. “The tainted Qi shows no sign of receding.”</p><p>Min Zhuo frowned, lost in thought.</p><p>"Clan Leader, you needn't worry," the confidant said cautiously. "With the Stygian Clan army at their doorstep, those foreign clans will struggle to protect themselves and won’t have the time to compete with us for the Azure Spirit Qi. This time, we will surely return with a bountiful harvest!"</p><p>“Short-sighted!”</p><p>Min Zhuo snorted. "If those foreign clans are annihilated, the Azure Spirit Qi will be exposed, and we will be competing with the Zhuyan Clan and the Stygian Clan. How much will they leave for us? Only by controlling the source of the Azure Spirit Qi can we gain the most benefit, ideally excavating the source and monopolizing the opportunity!"</p><p>Then, Min Zhuo’s tone shifted. "Moreover, how can you be certain that those foreign clans can’t withstand the Stygian Clan?"</p><p>Hearing this, the confidant’s expression changed drastically. "Those foreign clans only have two additional Emptiness Realm Second Stage experts. How can they possibly resist the Stygian Clan?"</p><p>“If it were that simple, why would Lu Wang personally lead the army and even invite the Imperial Grand Tutor for support? We shall wait and see!"</p><p>Min Zhuo turned and flew towards the palanquin, still pondering when the tainted Qi would recede.</p><p>He was determined to obtain Mount Daiyu, having collaborated with the tiger for this very day. However, in the current situation, claiming Mount Daiyu was akin to playing with fire.</p><p>For him, the ideal scenario was a stalemate.  He needed the foreign clans to remain, yet be too preoccupied to interfere, allowing him to slip away unnoticed and head to the Tainted Lands.</p><p>If those foreign clans were destroyed before the tainted Qi receded, or if they unexpectedly defeated the Stygian Clan army, his plans would be thwarted.</p><p>The latter was almost impossible. The challenge was to manipulate the situation into a prolonged standoff.</p><p>Min Zhuo personally greeted the Stygian Clan army to gauge their attitude towards the war. Everything he had seen and heard along the way indicated that Lu Wang was wary of those foreign clans, despite having two late-stage experts by his side.</p><p>This spoke volumes about the strength of those foreign clans!</p><p>He could deduce that Lu Wang wouldn't act rashly and would first attempt to ascertain their true strength, proceeding cautiously.</p><p>This would give him an opportunity. He was the most knowledgeable about those foreign clans, and Lu Wang would undoubtedly seek his advice. The intelligence in the previous jade slip was carefully crafted. He would need to adapt his approach and decide what further information to reveal to steer the course of the war.</p><p>Even fabricating information wouldn't be a problem. If it later proved false, he could easily explain it away.</p><p>Countless thoughts raced through Min Zhuo's mind. He exhaled softly, his expression calm as he entered the palanquin.</p><p>Got home late from work.</p>
