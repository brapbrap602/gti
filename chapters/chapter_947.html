Do you understand its value? This treasure is the only thing I left behind in my life. It’s incredibly helpful to us ghost cultivators. Do you think I would give up the Soul-Nurturing Wood just to live?”</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment, then said: “It seems, friend, that trapped as you are within the Demon Ban, you’re unaware of the situation outside. This place has become a hidden realm, opening only once every few decades. Entry is only possible during those openings. Because the realm is extremely dangerous—the beasts, for some unknown reason, have lost their minds—those trapped in the Seven Killing Hall have never reappeared, including many renowned cultivators.  And there are other strange signs.  Therefore, no one dares stay here after the realm closes.  Yet you’ve remained safely in the ghost land; you’re the only exception I’ve seen.  Could the Demon Ban somehow negate the Seven Killing Hall’s influence? Perhaps I needn’t rush to leave. I could stay within the Demon Ban for decades, waiting for the next opening of the Seven Killing Hall.  Surely this person wouldn’t dare block the exit indefinitely?”</p><p>The smile froze on Bai’s face.</p><p>The threat in Qin Sang’s words was unmistakable.  If push came to shove, he was willing to risk it all, gambling that the Demon Ban would protect him until the next opening of the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>“You’re gambling your future! Your physical body is incredibly strong. Your body cultivation is comparable to your cultivation base.  Your cultivation technique must be extraordinary, possibly pointing towards the Immortal Dao. This place is only filled with boundless ghost mist. If you dare remain here for decades, even if your spirit remains unharmed, your physical body will likely not hold up, eroded by the ghost mist, forcing you to cultivate the Corpse Ghost Dao. Is it worth it, for a mere object?”</p><p>Bai stared intently at Qin Sang, offering a word of caution.</p><p>But his intuition told him that this man was capable of anything when he set his mind to it.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly laughed, playfully saying, “Friend, do you know? To achieve Golden Core, I once took a desperate gamble, actively entering the Corpse Dao? Only later, by chance, did I return to the right path, unexpectedly achieving Golden Core.”</p><p>Hearing this, a look of surprise flashed in Bai’s eyes, his understanding of Qin Sang deepening.</p><p>“Besides, the Soul-Nurturing Wood is not merely an ‘object’ to me.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s brow flashed. The Ebony Sword shot out, hovering between them. “This sword, the Ebony Sword, is my life essence treasure, inextricably linked to my cultivation. This treasure is unique; it needs to be merged with spirit wood to grow stronger. Only the ten supreme-grade spirit woods can further enhance it, and my cultivation has been stagnant for years because of it. With the Soul-Nurturing Wood right here, if you were in my position, would you give up this chance?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew the risks of staying in the ghost land were enormous; he didn't want to resort to a fight with Bai unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>He practiced both body and spirit cultivation, possessing top-tier techniques from two races. If he were corrupted by the ghost mist and forced to cultivate the Corpse Ghost Dao, the loss would be immense, and he didn't possess any top-tier techniques of that kind.</p><p>So he revealed the Ebony Sword, making it clear to Bai that the Soul-Nurturing Wood was something he must have.</p><p>“The Soul-Nurturing Wood is a treasure to ghost cultivators, but you no longer need it, do you? After regaining your freedom, with your abilities, you might find a way to restore your human form…”</p><p>Qin Sang tried to persuade him, but he saw Bai staring intently at the Ebony Sword, his expression strange.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he quickly asked, “Friend, have you remembered something?”</p><p>Bai was the remnant soul of an ancient cultivator. Could seeing the Ebony Sword have triggered some hidden memory?</p><p>Qin Sang actively activated the *Spirit Cultivation Sword Chapter*, urging the Ebony Sword. Rings of shimmering, azure-green sword light flickered around the blade, displayed before Bai.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Bai suddenly cried out, clutching his head, his face contorted in pain. After a long while, he recovered, and under Qin Sang's anxious gaze, he said: "Interminable Blood Mulberry! Only now do I see it; your treasure is forged from the Interminable Blood Mulberry?”</p><p>“Indeed, it is the Interminable Blood Mulberry!”</p><p>Qin Sang thought Bai had recognized the origin of his cultivation technique, and he felt somewhat disappointed. He tentatively asked, “Friend, have your memories returned?”</p><p>Bai shook his head, his tone tinged with surprise. “No, perhaps because I have the Soul-Nurturing Wood, my subconscious linked it to related things. Seeing this sword, the words ‘Interminable Blood Mulberry’ suddenly popped into my soul. It seems my memories may be recoverable! I understand.  No wonder your life essence treasure couldn't be enhanced. The Interminable Blood Mulberry is the most foul wood in the world, as famous as the Soul-Nurturing Wood. Unless it is a top-tier spirit object capable of resisting the corruption of the foul wood, it cannot be refined together with the Interminable Blood Mulberry; it will be defiled and lose all its spirit. You are truly blessed to have obtained even a piece of the Interminable Blood Mulberry.”</p><p>“I wouldn't say that. I only obtained a thin piece of the spirit wood.”</p><p>Initially overjoyed, thinking it a stroke of luck, unaware that fortune hides misfortune..." Qin Sang explained, then pressed Bai further, "So, senior cultivator, you can recall memories simply by seeing something familiar from your past life?"</p><p>"Not necessarily!"</p><p>Bai's tone changed, his expression less optimistic. "I'm only a wisp of a soul. Even if I recover, at most only a small portion of my memories will return, and most of that will be inconsequential.  Reclaiming my self is incredibly difficult! The Blood Mulberry of the Netherworld is a case in point. My knowledge of it in life was undoubtedly far more extensive. Now, I only recall these superficial details..."</p><p>Bai rubbed his forehead, fell silent for a moment, then looked up. "You're right, cultivator.  It concerns my own Dao.  If I were in your position, I wouldn't miss this opportunity."</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. "What do you mean, senior cultivator?"</p><p>"It seems I must use the Soul-Nurturing Wood as payment for my life?"</p><p>Bai gave a wry smile.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, Bai readily agreed to his terms.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief; this was undoubtedly a win-win outcome.</p><p>Bai cautioned Qin Sang against premature celebration. "I can't hand over the Soul-Nurturing Wood directly. We'll agree on three conditions, a soul oath. After you help me break the demonic seal and help my soul find peace, I'll give you the treasure.  After that, you must wholeheartedly help me refine this body and must not attack me..."</p><p>He seemed to have a plan, speaking rapidly, articulating a watertight soul oath.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang softened his tone. "Unless absolutely necessary, I don't wish to be your enemy. I can make this soul oath.  Furthermore, if you encounter difficulties later in your quest to rediscover yourself, I might be able to help. However, senior cultivator, may I first see the Soul-Nurturing Wood to verify it?"</p><p>He wasn't afraid of the soul oath, but he wouldn't break his promise.</p><p>"No problem. I remember what you just said…"</p><p>Bai nodded readily, giving a sly smile.</p><p>Opening his mouth wide, a stream of corpse qi erupted, seemingly carrying something within.  Upon landing in Bai's palm, it transformed into a piece of black, decayed wood, nearly half a foot long and as thick as a forearm.</p><p>It was the Soul-Nurturing Wood!</p><p>Bai also concealed another piece of approximately the same size within his body.</p><p>He seemed to have anticipated this move, having already divided the Soul-Nurturing Wood in two.</p>
