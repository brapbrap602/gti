<h1>Chapter 945: A Narrow Escape</h1><p>Qin Sang felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>This apex predator was very likely the leader guarding the Amethyst.</p><p>Fortunately, he had known when to quit last time, grabbing a piece of Amethyst and leaving. Otherwise, he would have been in grave danger.</p><p>“Don't worry, you'll get your share!”</p><p>Qin Sang reassured the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Amethyst wasn't easy to get, but there were two other perilous areas in the Seven Killing Palace. Perhaps Lake Flower Fairy had spirit herbs that would attract the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm also seemed to understand the gravity of the situation. Sensing the oppressive aura of the apex predator, it trembled on Qin Sang's shoulder, no longer daring to make a sound.</p><p>……</p><p>The tremors grew weaker.</p><p>Old Devil Mu stood at the canyon entrance. The formation looked damaged, some of the bone tiles cracked. But he seemed oblivious to this, his gaze fixed on the depths of the Ghostlands.</p><p>Seeing no one emerge, Old Devil Mu grew restless. His lips moved slightly, and a wisp of blue spiritual fire flew out from between his brows – the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>The Cold Flame coalesced before him, reflecting in Old Devil Mu’s eyes like two icy beams.</p><p>He looked down at the Cold Flame and muttered, “Immortal Winter Nether was about to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage, becoming a Grand Cultivator, but perished due to heavenly tribulation. He died on a deserted island in the Demonic Sea and wasn't discovered for centuries. Fate can be cruel.  It's a pity that this secret technique is so difficult to cultivate. After decades, I've only achieved minor success, unable to fully refine the Winter Nether Cold Flame. Otherwise, my strength wouldn't be inferior to a Grand Cultivator. Why would I be threatened by the Demon Lord and that old Daoist, wasting precious time?  Forget it, the Demonic Fire is gone. Even if I could have obtained it, subduing it would have been a distant dream. Refining the Winter Nether Cold Flame gives me a real chance to break through to the late Nascent Soul stage and dominate both realms. The difficulty of reaching Deity Transformation is beyond imagination. Perhaps not a single one will appear in millions of years…”</p><p>Despite his words, the thought of the Demonic Fire still pained Old Devil Mu.</p><p>He flashed to the entrance of the Ghostlands. The scene inside was one of devastation.</p><p>Old Devil Mu then redeployed the bone tile formation. Out of caution, he even forced out a few drops of his essence blood, imbuing them into the tiles, restoring the formation to its full power.</p><p>He then cautiously extended his divine sense, discovering that the ghostly mist still had some effect on it. Fortunately, with the souls pacified and the demonic restrictions broken, the mist was dissipating, thin enough to see several dozen feet ahead.</p><p>Old Devil Mu's divine sense was stronger than any cultivator of the same realm, making this interference negligible. With a hand gesture, his divine sense infused with the Cold Flame, forming several Cold Fire Puppets that dispersed into the Ghostlands to search.</p><p>The Cold Fire Puppets swiftly swept through the Ghostlands, leaving no corner unchecked.</p><p>The Ghostlands were limited in size, allowing the puppets to easily explore the entire area, finding the remnants of the altars.</p><p>The altars and pillars had shattered while pacifying the souls.</p><p>Old Devil Mu appeared above the altars, his eyes flickering.  It was difficult to discern their purpose, but he could tell they weren't from this era. The strange phenomenon was definitely caused by the altars.</p><p>The altars had remained undisturbed in the Ghostlands for countless years. The mysterious person entering and triggering the incident clearly meant it was activated intentionally.</p><p>Unfortunately, only these traces remained, with no sign of the person.</p><p>Apart from the five altars, there wasn't anything unusual.</p><p>The mysterious person had vanished without a trace. There was no body, no clues to an ancient cultivator's hidden abode, and no treasures.</p><p>This place was the most desolate of all the secret realms in the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>Old Devil Mu furrowed his brow, filled with bewilderment.</p><p>Could that person have accidentally triggered some powerful restriction and been completely obliterated?</p><p>“No! Even if he died, there would be some trace.”</p><p>Old Devil Mu realized that the impact within the Ghostlands wasn't as violent as what he had experienced. “There must be something I've overlooked. Could it be…”</p><p>Before he could figure it out, a loud explosion and a sharp bird cry came from outside.</p><p>After listening for a moment, Old Devil Mu's expression changed drastically. Without looking back, he rushed out of the Ghostlands.</p><p>……</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang was fleeing in disarray.</p><p>Sensing the presence of the apex predator in the rift, Qin Sang didn’t dare to linger. He used his escape technique at full power, flying straight upwards towards the top of the rift.</p><p>He had barely left when the beast arrived.</p><p>The purple mist was incredibly dense. Using his Heavenly Eye, Qin Sang glimpsed some shadowy figures. On one side was a single beast, like a dog but not a dog.  On the other was a group of dragon-like creatures.</p><p>The two sides seemed to have a pre-existing feud, snarling and growling at each other.</p><p>Fortunately, their attention was focused on each other and the commotion in the Ghostlands, allowing Qin Sang to go unnoticed.</p><p>Just then, the unexpected happened.</p><p>A terrifying aura suddenly appeared above Qin Sang. A gust of wind buffeted him as an enormous bird descended from the sky.</p><p>Warned by the Heavenly Eye Butterfly, Qin Sang reacted instantly, flattening himself against the cliff face, ordering the Fat Silkworm to compress its poison-repelling armor and activating the Red Silk to conceal his aura.</p><p>However, the bird was incredibly alert and sensed his presence.</p><p>While the Red Silk played a part in deceiving Old Devil Mu, Bai's contribution was undeniable.</p><p>Against ordinary transformed demons or Nascent Soul cultivators, Qin Sang might have succeeded.</p><p>But these apex predators, accustomed to the purple mist and possessing strength comparable to Nascent Soul cultivators, had heightened senses and were intimately familiar with their surroundings.  His presence was discovered.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A gust of wind swept past.</p><p>The bird arrived on a gale, emitting an ear-splitting screech. It opened its beak and fired a black beam of light, like an arrow, at Qin Sang's hiding place.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart lurched.</p><p>He had thought he could breathe easy after escaping Old Devil Mu, but he hadn’t expected so many apex predators in the rift. One had been perched on the cliff face all along – an unforeseen circumstance that even Bai hadn’t anticipated.</p><p>Qin Sang had simply been lucky not to disturb it earlier.</p><p>With the bird blocking his path, other predators lurking below, and Old Devil Mu on the prowl, Qin Sang was desperate.  His mind raced.  He kicked off the cliff face, narrowly dodging the bird’s attack.  Grazed by the residual energy, he slammed hard against the cliff wall, letting out a muffled groan.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The black beam struck the cliff face, sending debris flying and leaving a large crater, making Qin Sang’s blood run cold.</p><p>The bird shrieked, flapping its wings to pursue Qin Sang. Suddenly, roars erupted from the bottom of the rift, filled with warning and hostility, seemingly directed at the bird.</p><p>The bird paused, its fierce eyes fixed on the rift below, responding with an equally sharp cry.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had been secretly preparing his Lightning Control Technique for a desperate fight, felt a surge of relief.</p><p>As he had suspected, the apex predators, influenced by the Seven Killing Palace, had only slightly higher intelligence than other beasts.  They couldn't coexist peacefully, and their attention was easily diverted by rivals.</p><p>This was a golden opportunity.</p><p>Feigning weakness, Qin Sang tumbled away, out of the bird's sight, and escaped in another direction.</p>
