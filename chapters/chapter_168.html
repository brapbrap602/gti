**Chapter 161 The Rising Moon**


*BAM*! *BAM*!
One after another, several rapid blows hacked at the sap zombie.
The sap zombie couldn’t use its baleful qi to heal fast enough, and the rate at which its wounds mended slowed significantly. Although the sap zombie's body boasted a considerable defense, the wounds still hadn't managed to close. But with this steady attrition, it would eventually be cut down without escaping. 
The sap zombie tried to fight back, but Qin Sang naturally wouldn't give it the chance to struggle. He immediately poured all his strength into powering the Five Elements Sword-breaking Sword, and a succession of sword beams slashed across the same spot. It took quite a bit of time before he managed to slay the sap zombie.
*THUD*!
The sap zombie collapsed to the ground, and the baleful earth qi on its body suddenly dispersed, filling the air with a foul stench.
Qin Sang frowned slightly and dodged a long distance away, only to see the sap zombie's massive form visibly shrivel up before his very eyes, ultimately turning into the corpse of a middle-aged cultivator, leaving Qin Sang utterly astounded.
The cultivator's form was thin and his face suffused with a bluish-black pallor, but his features were still recognizable. He only lingered for a brief moment before his body completely decayed, ultimately crumbling into a heap of black ash.
Qin Sang waved his hand to scatter the ash, and when he saw there was nothing left inside, he dashed over to the Xuan Iron Door and sent out his divine sense to study the warding spells on the Xuan Tian Door.
The warding spell on the Xuan Iron Door was a bit trickier than the one on the stone gate, but it wasn’t very difficult to crack. He quickly found the weak point in the warding spell, and the Five Elements Sword-breaking Sword stabbed repeatedly at the black cloud beneath the portrait of the ancient corpse's feet.
*BAM*!
The black cloud shattered, and the Xuan Iron Gate shook violently as a puff of black qi burst into the air.
Then, accompanied by a piercing sound that grated on the ears, the Xuan Iron Door where the black cloud had been slowly opened up into a narrow gap. Qin Sang channeled his spiritual power and pushed the gap open enough for someone to slip through, then darted inside.
The large chamber opened up into more forks in the path, splitting into five stone paths. This was much fewer than before, and the paths were clearly sloping downward. If the terrain ahead was anything like this, the spiderweb-shaped basin would eventually converge on a specific location.
By now, Qin Sang was fairly certain that this cave system was the location of the mountain gate for some demonic sect well-versed in corpse refinement. He didn't know whether a powerful enemy had done them in or whatever the reason, but not only had all their disciples been slaughtered, the mountain gate had also been sealed with warding spells, and the sect had completely vanished from the world of immortal cultivation.
The point where all the stone paths gathered would probably be the heart of this demonic sect!
After passing through the Xuan Iron Gate, Qin Sang clearly felt that the spiritual power was several times richer than outside. These stone paths were more regular than the ones before, having been finely smoothed out by human hands. Along the sides of the stone paths, there was a stone chamber every so often, and all the stone chamber doors stood wide open, most of them empty inside.
The stone path ahead also had similar stone chambers, and Qin Sang had seen several skeletons inside them, guessing that they were probably the cultivation caverns of the demonic sect's disciples.
From this, it could be seen that the further down into the basin one went, the more abundant the spiritual energy and the better quality the cultivation caverns became.
The disciples who cultivated here must have had a higher status than those on the outer edges. And just a bit further down, one should reach the cultivation caverns of the Foundation Establishment disciples.
Qin Sang didn't linger too long after passing through the Xuan Iron Gate. He scanned his surroundings casually, then activated the Fallen Cloud Wings and concealed his aura with the Spirit Evasion Technique before darting into one of the stone paths.
As soon as he had gone in a short distance, Qin Sang made a surprising move.
He suddenly turned around and stared in the direction of the Xuan Iron Gate, hesitating for a moment before quietly doubling back a little ways. Just before reaching the Xuan Iron Gate, he slipped into a stone chamber and lay in wait.
The stone path was dark and still, without a sound to be heard.
Qin Sang stood at the entrance to the stone chamber as if he had become a statue, not moving a muscle, his eyes fixed on the fork in the path, as if the deadly baleful qi was nothing to him.
And so a hundred breaths passed, with the stone path remaining as lifeless as before. This brief period had felt incredibly long, and the doubt on Qin Sang's face grew thicker and thicker, making him think, "难道我感知错了?"
At that moment, a soft gasp suddenly sounded from the dark fork in the path. It was an extremely soft sound, but to Qin Sang's ears, it was like a clap of thunder.
Qin Sang's face stiffened, and he pushed his Fallen Cloud Wings and Spirit Evasion Technique to the limit. He narrowed his eyes and looked towards the location the sound had come from.
He saw the space behind the Xuan Iron Gate begin to distort, and moments later, the silhouette of a person gradually emerged.
When he saw who it was, Qin Sang's eyes gleamed.
Wu Yuesheng!
Earlier in the large chamber, just when Qin Sang had wanted to test the sap zombie's abilities so that he could be prepared to deal with it, he had suddenly felt a faint fluctuation, as if someone had broken in. Although it had vanished almost instantly, he had still caught it.
Performing the Five Elements Sword-breaking Sword spell with all his strength required harnessing the spiritual qi in the space around him, plus the fact that his divine sense wasn’t weak, meant that he could detect the slightest changes in his surroundings.

Qin Sang didn't show any emotion, but he quickly changed his plan, taking out his Blood Blade and starting a close-quarters combat with the evil corpse, so that he could justify activating his Star Tears for protection.  He fought with the evil corpse while secretly investigating it, but he found nothing strange.  Everything was normal in the hall, and the fluctuation from before seemed like an illusion.

But in such a strange cave and cavern, Qin Sang couldn't treat it as an illusion.

He was in the open, the enemies were hiding.

He didn't know if the enemies in hiding were human or ghosts, or how strong they were.  Qin Sang didn't dare to alert the other side recklessly, so he was wary, pretending to be normal and opening the Black Iron Doors.  Only then did he start his actions.

Qin Sang wasn't sure if this would draw out the other side.  He was just trying to survive, and he would accept it if his opponents didn't show up.

At this time, Qin Sang was not too surprised to see Wu Yuesheng in the shadows. He had noticed that Wu Yuesheng performed unique Breath Concealing Techniques before the Ghost Wind Barrier.

Qin Sang was on guard.  Why didn't Wu Yuesheng choose to join forces with him by showing himself, but instead spied on him in the shadows?

There was the Earth煞Breath hanging like a sword over his head, and the evil corpse blocking the way ahead.  He was in great danger.

Joining forces to overcome the crisis was the best choice.

Even if he wanted to use this opportunity to observe his strength, he should have shown himself after Qin Sang had killed the evil corpse and broken the seal on the Black Iron Doors.

Wu Yuesheng had reached the Foundation Establishment Realm before him, and his superficial strength was stronger.  He had no reason to be afraid of him.

His mind was racing, and Qin Sang secretly observed Wu Yuesheng.

He saw Wu Yuesheng standing at the fork, looking in front of him at the five forks in the road.  His facial expression was a little surprised.  He muttered, "Junior Brother Qin is really careful.  There's no trace of him on any of the five paths.  I wonder which one he took?"

After a moment's hesitation, Wu Yuesheng shook his head, randomly chose a path, and was just about to step inside when he suddenly remembered something and raised his hand to point at a spot in the void.  A fireball was born out of thin air, then expanded rapidly and exploded with a bang when it reached its limit.

Threads of flame danced like elves, instantly flying out in all directions at astonishing speeds, filling the surrounding space in an instant.

Qin Sang had been wary.  As soon as Wu Yuesheng moved, he made a decisive retreat, narrowly avoiding the probing flames.

Seeing everything normal, Wu Yuesheng laughed at himself and disappeared into that stone path.
