<h1>Chapter 1944: Jade Capital Mountain</h1><p>Chen Xiucai and Yu Chenghuang were both loquacious individuals, while Yi Panguan and Liu Daifu played the perfect supporting roles.</p><p>Qin Sang occasionally interjected a few words, but mostly listened to their conversation with relish, occasionally raising a cup of wine.</p><p>This gathering, a mix of mortals and immortals, was a unique experience.</p><p>‘Sizzle… sizzle…’</p><p>Qin Sang personally took charge, grilling the meat over charcoal until slightly charred, sprinkling it with seasoning powder.  Every movement was precise, every detail perfect.</p><p>After grilling, he took out a few skewers and handed them to his disciples.</p><p>The four little ones gathered in the corner, their mouths glistening with grease.</p><p>“You guys… on the mountain… Ow!  That’s hot!”</p><p>Tao Teng inhaled sharply, unwilling to spit out the meat.  He swallowed with difficulty, feeling the flavor permeate his very bones.</p><p>Whether from the heat or from envy, Tao Teng looked at Yu Lang, his eyes reddening. “Truly… a celestial life!”</p><p>The bookboy, Ming Yan, nodded in fervent agreement.</p><p>“Just eat yours!”</p><p>Yu Lang tossed Tao Teng a spirit fruit to shut him up.</p><p>‘Knock! Knock! Knock!’</p><p>Someone was frantically knocking on the door.</p><p>Liu Daifu startled, while Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan turned to look.</p><p>Qin Sang uttered a reassuring word, got up, and opened the door.  Zhu Que flew in, looking shifty-eyed.</p><p>Having been reprimanded several times, it finally learned its lesson and didn't squawk loudly, instead staring intently at the meat in Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang had already prepared a plate for it.  Ignoring everyone else, Zhu Que buried its head and began to devour the meat.</p><p>Everyone at the table watched as Zhu Que gorged itself.</p><p>“Even a little bird loves it; the taste must be exceptional,” Liu Daifu chuckled.</p><p>Zhu Que glanced at him disdainfully and continued eating.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan continuously scrutinized Zhu Que, astonished to find that they couldn't even see through a bird from the Daoist temple?</p><p>Composing themselves, Yu Chenghuang picked up a skewer, sniffed it lightly, and imitating Qin Sang, bit off a piece directly from the skewer.</p><p>Having come from a scholarly family, he had been raised with strict etiquette since childhood. Such a coarse manner was a first for him, and he felt somewhat awkward.</p><p>Chen Xiucai was initially the same, but quickly adapted, and even praised this way of eating, declaring that this was how it should be done.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang savored the taste.</p><p>Chen Xiucai stared at him, waiting for him to swallow, then smugly asked, “Brother Yu, how is it? I didn’t exaggerate, did I?”</p><p>“Truly heavenly!”</p><p>Yu Chenghuang was generous with his praise.</p><p>“The Drunken Fragrance Feast at the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant is reputed to be the best in Jiangnan, yet it cannot compare to this simple skewer of meat.”</p><p>Yi Panguan echoed, inwardly scoffing.  He knew the ingredients used were extraordinary; how could it not be delicious?</p><p>His gaze swept over the mortals in the room.  They had consumed so many potent spiritual herbs and fruits yet hadn't exploded. Clearly, the temple master had subtly intervened, allowing them to slowly digest the medicinal power, at least strengthening their bodies and benefiting them for life.</p><p>“What is the Drunken Fragrance Feast?” Chen Xiucai was bewildered. He had been to the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant many times and had never heard of such a feast.</p><p>“The owner of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant was once an imperial chef.  It is said he offended some villain in the palace and was forced to retire, returning to Jindian County to open the restaurant. Only the owner knows how to prepare the Drunken Fragrance Feast, and he has yet to pass on his skills.  The owner is getting old and can only make it a few times a year, and only his old acquaintances have such fortune,” Yu Chenghuang sipped his wine, savoring the blend of wine, meat, and medicinal aromas.</p><p>“Another recluse! My Jindian County is truly a city of recluses! A county of recluses! We must drink to this!”</p><p>Chen Xiucai, overcome with emotion, slammed his hand on the table and drained his cup in one gulp.</p><p>He drank several cups in a row, his demeanor becoming increasingly unrestrained.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang glanced at Qin Sang, silently agreeing. “Indeed, a county of recluses, and also a den of hidden dragons.  Next year’s autumn examinations, Brother Chen should be emerging from seclusion, shouldn't you?”</p><p>As the City God of Jindian County, Yu Chenghuang also paid attention to the talented scholars under his jurisdiction.  He knew that this Chen Xiucai was quite learned, but unfortunately, his talent had not been recognized, and he had repeatedly failed the imperial examinations.</p><p>Chen Xiucai gave a wry smile.  “In my youth, I was full of myself, yet I failed the exams time and again.  Seeing my classmates all enjoying success, I could only feign eccentricity. It was merely a mask to hide my shame. I was never a true recluse, so how can there be talk of emerging from seclusion?”</p><p>“With such a broad mind, I believe Brother Chen will one day achieve his aspirations.” Qin Sang raised his cup to Chen Xiucai, and the others drank with him.</p><p>No one offered any words of empty comfort.  Chen Xiucai’s willingness to reveal his vulnerabilities showed that he didn't need anyone's consolation.</p><p>Chen Xiucai accepted the toast calmly, stood up, and looked out the window. “In my youthful arrogance, I loved to speak shocking words.  Now, I no longer yearn for titles or a place in history. If I am fortunate enough to pass the exams and govern a region, I only wish to not fail the people, not fail the Emperor, not fail Heaven and Earth, and not fail my own heart!”</p><p>…</p><p>Wine cups clinked in the attic of the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>People bustled in Jindian County.</p><p>The teahouse should have been even livelier than the streets.</p><p>Yet, when the young woman entered the teahouse, she was met with a strange stillness.  Everyone was completely engrossed in listening to the storyteller.</p><p>The tea servers walked with the lightest of steps, even pouring tea with utmost care so as not to make a sound.</p><p>The patrons rarely spoke, forgetting even the food and tea in front of them.</p><p>Only when the storyteller struck the gavel did the patrons seem to awaken from a dream, drinking tea and conversing for a brief moment, their voices as soft as whispers.</p><p>The storyteller's voice resonated throughout the teahouse, seemingly drowning out the outside noise.</p><p>“What story could have such captivating power?”</p><p>The young woman, marveling at the scene, looked past the patrons and saw the storyteller on stage.</p><p>Just as the auntie outside had described, the storyteller wore a grey long gown, had a youthful appearance, a moderate build, and ordinary looks, the kind of person who would be lost in a crowd.</p><p>The storyteller also noticed the young woman entering.  Seeing her approach, he smiled slightly and nodded in greeting.</p><p>The young woman couldn't help but smile back.</p><p>The tea server approached with a teapot.  After a brief exchange of glances with the young woman, he led her to an empty table.</p><p>“It is said that when the Nine Heavenly Goddess descended to the mortal realm, the Heavenly Mother happened to send the Azure Bird with a decree, secretly instructing the Azure Bird to escort the Nine Heavenly Goddess to the Heavenly Pool if she remained obstinate.  Unexpectedly, the Azure Bird, yearning for the mortal world, was swayed by the Nine Heavenly Goddess's few words and followed her down to the mortal realm…”</p><p>So it was a mythical tale.</p><p>The young woman thought as she sat down, guided by the tea server.  However, she didn't notice that the kingfisher on her shoulder had raised its head and flapped its wings upon hearing the mention of the Azure Bird.</p><p>‘Chirp… chirp…’</p><p>The kingfisher flew around excitedly, circle after circle, tirelessly.</p><p>Its feathers shed azure specks of light, and its calls blended seamlessly with the storyteller’s narrative, transforming into the Azure Bird of the story, immersing everyone in the scene.</p><p>None of the listeners, including the young woman, found this strange.</p><p>The young woman completely ignored her companion.  After sitting down, she focused intently on the storyteller on stage, listening to the captivating tale.</p><p>In a trance, she felt as if she had become the Nine Heavenly Goddess in the story.</p><p>Her master was the heartless Heavenly Mother.</p><p>Every action and every encounter of the Nine Heavenly Goddess after descending to the mortal realm tugged at her heartstrings.</p><p>When the Nine Heavenly Goddess rejoiced, she beamed with smiles.</p><p>When the Nine Heavenly Goddess grieved, tears streamed down her face.</p><p>…</p><p>The young woman forgot that she was in a teahouse, forgot everything around her, lost in the world created by the storyteller.</p><p>Not long after the young woman entered the teahouse, a gust of eerie wind suddenly swept past the entrance, and a figure, invisible to ordinary mortals, flickered in the shadows.</p><p>This figure, clad in armor, was a ghost god under the command of the Jindian County City God, and one of high rank, second only to the City God and the Civil and Military Judges, on par with the heads of various departments and generals: the Day Wanderer God.</p><p>“She went in?”</p><p>Two ghostly attendants, who had been standing where the Day Wanderer God materialized, bowed in unison and replied, “Yes.”</p><p>The young woman likely had methods to conceal her aura, deceiving the gatekeeping ghostly attendants upon entering the city, but she was still detected by the divine artifacts within the City God Temple.</p><p>Unfortunately, the primary officials were all absent today.</p><p>The City God and the Civil Judge had gone out on patrol together, and the Military Judge personally led troops out of the city to hunt down a demonic creature.</p><p>The Day Wanderer God and the other department heads, unable to ascertain the young woman’s background and not daring to act rashly, observed her innocent and carefree demeanor, seemingly harboring no malicious intent, and so the Day Wanderer God went out of the city to consult the Military Judge.</p><p>Two ghost soldiers were ordered to wait here.</p><p>“Yes, she entered the teahouse and hasn’t come out,” one ghostly attendant hesitated, “Something’s strange inside.  You should see for yourself, my lord.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The Day Wanderer God furrowed his brows and, leading the two ghostly attendants, quietly slipped through the curtain.  At that moment, the storyteller happened to be narrating the part where the Nine Heavenly Goddess encountered danger.</p><p>“The Heavenly Mother dispatched heavenly soldiers and generals to search the entire world. No matter how careful the Nine Heavenly Goddess and the Azure Bird were, they ultimately couldn't escape their fate. At Lianyang Mountain, they were finally discovered by a squad of heavenly soldiers.  Alas, the Immortal Seal bestowed upon the Nine Heavenly Goddess and the Azure Bird upon their descent had yet to dissipate, and their powers had only recovered to thirty percent. Another fierce battle was inevitable…”</p><p>The kingfisher, at some point, had returned to the young woman’s shoulder.  Just like its owner, it was engrossed in the story, its expression filled with anxiety.</p><p>The Day Wanderer God and the two ghostly attendants, having just stepped into the teahouse, were stunned to see the storyteller nod towards them.</p><p>At that moment, a surge of heroic spirit welled up within their chests. They felt as if they had transformed into heavenly soldiers and generals, tasked by the Heavenly Mother to apprehend criminals and administer divine justice!</p><p>They completely forgot their original purpose, walked to another empty table, sat down with ramrod straight backs, their eyes gleaming brightly.</p><p>The story continued.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan back at the Green Ram Temple were completely oblivious to this.</p><p>The feast lasted from early morning until afternoon.</p><p>Liu Daifu stayed the night at the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>Chen Xiucai and Yu Chenghuang, along with the others, descended the mountain together, bidding each other farewell outside the bamboo forest.</p><p>Chen Xiucai initially offered to send them off in his carriage, but Yu and Yi declined.</p><p>After parting ways, the two divine beings vanished into thin air, reappearing in a mountain not far from the Green Ram Temple.</p><p>“Greetings, my lords.”</p><p>The local Earth God, having waited there for some time, hastily bowed.</p><p>Yi Panguan said, “We have met that Daoist Qing Feng.  He is truly extraordinary. Be cautious in your dealings with him, fulfill any requests he may have, and do not disturb him unnecessarily.”</p><p>The Earth God was astonished.  “May I ask what is the background of this Daoist?”</p><p>Yi Panguan looked at Yu Chenghuang.  For some reason, Yu Chenghuang hadn’t inquired about this earlier.</p><p>“I fear even the officials of the prefecture would treat this person with courtesy.  It’s hard to say whether it's a blessing or a curse that such a person resides in seclusion in Jindian County.”</p><p>Yu Chenghuang sighed softly. “Regardless of his identity or cultivation, treat him as a powerful being experiencing the mortal world.”</p><p>The Earth God responded with a confused “Yes.”</p><p>Yi Panguan glanced at the Earth God and said gravely, “With such individuals, everything depends on fate. Without fate, all is futile. Don’t think that diligent service will earn you any favors. Be careful not to overdo it.”</p><p>His thoughts exposed, the Earth God shuddered.  “Thank you for your guidance, my lord.  I almost made a grave mistake.”</p><p>“There's no need to be so overly cautious. I observe that this person has an amiable disposition. Just be natural,” Yu Chenghuang gave a few more instructions, and then, together with Yi Panguan, they returned to the county city.</p><p>…</p><p>“What did you say? The Day and Night Wanderer Gods and the Soul Summoners are all trapped in the teahouse?”</p><p>When Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan returned to the county city, the Military Judge happened to have returned from his demon hunt as well.  They joined forces, only to receive a message via spirit talisman at this moment.</p><p>Upon seeing the contents of the talisman, the three officials' expressions changed drastically.</p><p>It turned out that after the Day Wanderer God entered the teahouse, he vanished without a trace.  The Night Wanderer God and the Soul Summoners, who came looking for him, were also trapped within.</p><p>Then came several other department heads.</p><p>The teahouse door seemed like a gaping maw, swallowing all the ghost gods who entered.</p><p>As more and more ghost gods vanished, finally, a ghostly attendant realized something was amiss.</p><p>“Preposterous! I’ll see what kind of demon dares to wreak havoc within the county city!”</p><p>The Military Judge flew into a rage.  With a flick of his sleeve, all the ghost soldiers transformed into a gust of eerie wind, rushing towards the county city.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang and Yi Panguan exchanged glances, seeing the same apprehension in each other’s eyes.</p><p>What a coincidence!</p><p>Trouble erupted in the city right after their visit to Daoist Qing Feng.</p><p>At this time, layers upon layers of ghostly attendants surrounded the teahouse, their spells isolating it from the mortal world.</p><p>The mortals remained oblivious, continuing to bustle in the streets, subconsciously ignoring the teahouse.</p><p>The storyteller’s resonant voice could be heard, narrating the pursuit of the Nine Heavenly Goddess and the Azure Bird by heavenly soldiers and generals.</p><p>This pursuit was thrilling and captivating.</p><p>All the ghost gods in the city were gathered here, yet none dared to step foot inside the teahouse.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>An eerie wind descended from the sky. Yu Chenghuang and the two Judges finally arrived.  After listening to their subordinates’ report, they approached the teahouse entrance.</p><p>The curtain was made of bamboo, and through the gaps, they could vaguely see the scene inside.</p><p>The young woman, the Azure Bird, and the numerous ghost gods, each with different expressions, were completely absorbed in the story.</p><p>“Deploy the Mountain Quelling Spirit Banners!”</p><p>The Military Judge whispered.</p><p>Outside the teahouse, a squad of ghost gods retreated upon receiving the order, retrieving nine black banners, each three zhang long, and planting them around the teahouse.</p><p>The ghost gods divided into nine groups, gathering beneath the banners.  The main banner stood behind the Military Judge.</p><p>Nine banners formed an array, suppressing all cultivators and demonic creatures!</p><p>Yu Chenghuang nodded at Yi Panguan.  Yi Panguan stepped forward and lifted the curtain, but didn’t cross the threshold.</p><p>The curtain was half-lifted.</p><p>The three officials saw the storyteller, and at the same time, the storyteller looked up at them.</p><p>Yu Chenghuang opened his mouth, about to speak.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The storyteller abruptly struck the gavel. “The heavenly soldiers and generals were repelled by the Nine Heavenly Goddess’s cunning plan, suffering a crushing defeat. Just as the Nine Heavenly Goddess and the Azure Bird rejoiced, they were unaware of the approaching danger! The Three Star Lords had already led their troops in pursuit. It seems they will not escape this tribulation!”</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain Dao Field.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body, immersed in comprehending the sword array, suddenly awoke. He gazed southward, his expression gradually turning grave.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang stood up, left his cave dwelling, sent a message to Marquis Gui, and vanished in a flash of thunder.</p>
