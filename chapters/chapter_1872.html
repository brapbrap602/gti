<h1>Chapter 1863: North Pole Ghost-Slaying Seal</h1><p>At the heart of the Golden Armored Battle Formation, Qin Sang and Ling Youwang clashed fiercely.</p><p>Qin Sang within, the Golden Armored Battle Formation without, and Zuo Zhenren above, formed a small-scale battle array.</p><p>Qin Sang resembled a valiant general, leading his troops to besiege the enemy, while Zuo Zhenren oversaw strategy and coordination.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang was completely lost in the fight, relentlessly attacking the enemy before him.  There were no discernible techniques, only the purest form of fists and feet, a style that paradoxically resonated with the true meaning of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.</p><p>He disregarded his injuries and exhaustion, fighting like a man possessed.</p><p>The formidable nature of his Spiritwood Body finally manifested.</p><p>Throughout his long life, Ling Youwang had never encountered such a frenzied opponent.  Gazing into those bloodshot eyes, he couldn't help but feel a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Ling Youwang not only had to contend with the combined assault of Qin Sang and the Golden Armored Battle Formation, but also remain constantly wary of Zuo Zhenren's talismans.</p><p>High upon the altar, Zuo Zhenren appeared leisurely, but in reality, he had no moment of respite.  Pacing in measured steps, his fingers formed intricate hand seals, conjuring flickering talismanic shadows.  Sometimes, they merged with the Golden Armored soldiers, and at other times, they struck directly at Ling Youwang.</p><p>The talismans could transform into swords, spears, halberds, or manifest as ethereal scenes of wind, flowers, snow, and moonlight.  Lethal intent lay hidden within these wondrous displays, keeping Ling Youwang constantly on guard, never daring to underestimate them.</p><p>In this short span of time, Zuo Zhenren had unleashed more talismans than Qin Sang had ever witnessed, a testament to the profound intricacies of Daoist talismanic arts.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A furious roar shook the heavens.</p><p>Qin Sang's relentless assault had ignited Ling Youwang's ferocious nature.  He fixed his gaze upon Qin Sang, eyes filled with savage intensity.  With a flash of spiritual light, his body visibly shrunk.</p><p>His reduced fish form was less than half its original size, appearing almost diminutive before Qin Sang.  However, the luster of his scales deepened, and Qin Sang sensed an inexplicable threat emanating from him, heightening his vigilance.</p><p>The transformation didn't end there, and its effects rippled outward.  A faint, watery hue began to permeate the surrounding void, centered around Ling Youwang.</p><p>The watery hue spread, but upon contact with the Golden Armored Battle Formation, it vanished, seemingly dispersed by the golden light.</p><p>On the altar, Zuo Zhenren's expression grew solemn.  His gaze shifted towards a point outside the battle formation.</p><p>The watery hue reappeared at the edge of the formation, ceasing its expansion and coalescing within a radius of several zhang.  Then, a further transformation occurred.</p><p>It was as if real water existed there.  As the watery hue rippled, a large black fish materialized out of thin air.</p><p>The black fish, like the watery hue, was faint, resembling a phantom.  It swished its tail, seemingly confined within the watery area, as if trapped in a pool.  Yet, its demeanor appeared strangely content.</p><p>A second and then a third black fish phantom emerged, positioned in a triangular formation, encircling the Golden Armored soldiers.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's expression flickered.  With a single command, a chorus of whooshing sounds filled the battlefield.</p><p>The golden chains held by the Golden Armored soldiers were swiftly retracted and then flung outward, each targeting one of the three black fish phantoms.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The golden chains, imbued with immense power, tore through the void with resounding cracks.  Golden streams of light pierced the black fish phantoms before snapping back.</p><p>Yet, the black fish phantoms remained unscathed, not a single scale disturbed, and even the watery hue showed no visible ripples.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren paused, momentarily unable to decipher the nature of these black fish phantoms. Perhaps it was a new technique Ling Youwang had cultivated over the years.</p><p>His thoughts raced.  He ordered the Golden Armored soldiers to continue their assault on Ling Youwang while he retrieved three yellow talismans from his sleeve.  With a flick of his wrist, they transformed into three streaks of profound yellow light, each hurtling towards a black fish phantom.</p><p>The yellow talismans descended silently, the paper disappearing, leaving behind three crimson mystic characters written in cinnabar, floating on the surface of the watery hue. The black fish phantoms immediately became less agile.</p><p>These talismans were a type of Malignant Prohibition Seal, possessing the power of confinement. They often proved effective against unknown entities.</p><p>However, Zuo Zhenren's deployment of the talismans came a moment too late.</p><p>Within the battle formation, Ling Youwang lashed out with his fishtail.  Simultaneously, the three black fish phantoms outside mirrored his movement.</p><p>Their tails struck with the speed of lightning, so fast that even the Heaven's Eye Butterfly could barely track their trajectory.</p><p>Qin Sang hastily raised his arms.  With a resounding boom, he felt as if a mountain had collided with him.  He grunted, sent flying backward, nearly disrupting the Golden Armored Battle Formation.</p><p>As he regained his footing, he raised his arms and discovered, to his dismay, that the Bright Mountain Armor on his forearms bore significant dents and spiderweb cracks.</p><p>This treasured armor, which had protected him from countless attacks throughout his battles with Ling Youwang, had finally reached its limit.</p><p>The Bright Mountain Armor's material was, after all, inferior to a true spiritual treasure.  While the fragments of the true treasure remained potent when coalesced, their power dispersed when integrated into his body, revealing their limitations when facing a Demon King.</p><p>"I was too greedy last time.  Full body armor dispersed the true treasure's power too thinly, making it less effective.  Crafting an inner armor would be the optimal approach..."</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind, but his offensive didn't waver.  He twisted his body and charged back into the fray.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren also noticed their movements.  His gaze swept over Qin Sang before he produced another item from his sleeve: a jade slip the size of a finger.</p><p>Resembling a jade slip, it was, in fact, a talisman known as the Responsive Spirit-Seizing Jade Inscription.</p><p>This talisman could subdue demons, ghosts, and monsters, preventing them from approaching, serving as a powerful form of protection. It was a secret technique of the Dao Court, rarely revealed.</p><p>This talisman possessed immense power and was difficult to refine.  Even the "talisman paper" that bore the inscription required an exceptionally rare and high-quality spirit jade as its base, meticulously refined through forty-nine precise steps before taking shape.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's willingness to deploy this talisman demonstrated his resolve to eliminate Ling Youwang.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The talisman shattered, transforming into a stream of jade-colored light.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that this jade light was beneficial to him, so he offered no resistance, allowing it to envelop him.</p><p>His figure became somewhat hazy, and he felt a sense of lightness.  The oppressive feeling he usually experienced in Ling Youwang's presence vanished, replaced by a sensation of superiority, as if he had become a deity tasked with subduing evil, his inherent rank suppressing his opponent.</p><p>Of course, this was merely an illusion.  Whether he could truly subdue Ling Youwang depended on whose strength prevailed.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Qin Sang lunged forward and, seeing Ling Youwang's tail sweeping towards him, met it with a powerful punch.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The impact reverberated through his body. The force of the tail was no less potent than before, yet Qin Sang handled it with greater ease.</p><p>"Truly a divine talisman!"  Qin Sang marveled inwardly as he dissipated the force.  He shifted his stance and suddenly saw Ling Youwang leaping into the air.</p><p>At that very moment, the Swallowing Sea Clam finally broke free from the wooden bead's entanglement and shot downwards.</p><p>Seeing Ling Youwang's move, Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.  He flapped his phoenix wings and soared after him.</p><p>A flurry of whistling sounds filled the air as all the golden chains shot towards Ling Youwang, spreading like a canopy in mid-air.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The Swallowing Sea Clam transformed into a shadowy light, returning to Ling Youwang's side.  Its shell opened slightly, engulfing Ling Youwang entirely, before snapping shut and shooting skyward.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>The golden chains arrived, but instead of piercing the Swallowing Sea Clam, they wrapped around its shell.</p><p>Dozens of golden chains instantly bound the Swallowing Sea Clam tightly.</p><p>'Clang! Clang! Clang!'</p><p>The chains strained, taut to their breaking point.  All the Golden Armored soldiers roared, exerting their full strength to pull downwards.</p><p>Qin Sang also caught up. With a resounding clap, his hands clamped onto the Swallowing Sea Clam.  He executed the Thousand Jin Fall technique, while above, the Roaming Cloud Sword whistled like thunder, slashing down upon the clam like a dragon.</p><p>The three black fish phantoms thrashed their tails frantically.</p><p>Ling Youwang, remarkably, continued to strive to escape despite enduring this onslaught.</p><p>'Creak! Creak! Creak!'</p><p>The golden chains stretched, threatening to snap.</p><p>Zuo Zhenren's brow furrowed slightly.  He immediately issued a command.  Half of the Golden Armored soldiers handed their chains to their comrades, bent their knees, and leaped into the air.  A series of deafening booms echoed as they collided with each other.</p><p>Blinding golden light erupted.  As it faded, the Golden Armored soldiers had merged into a golden mountain, which plummeted towards the Swallowing Sea Clam.</p><p>No one knew the weight of this golden mountain, but Qin Sang caught a glimpse of it from the corner of his eye, and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The golden mountain struck the Swallowing Sea Clam dead center.</p><p>The protective light surrounding the clam was almost completely shattered.  The shell shuddered, and a crack appeared, as if forcibly split open.</p><p>The shell opened wide, revealing a scene of utter darkness within, exposing Ling Youwang.</p><p>Seeing Ling Youwang again, Qin Sang's eyes widened in surprise, a strange feeling welling up inside him.</p><p>For some reason, the Black Fish Dharma Idol was significantly more illusory than before.  Completely disregarding the surrounding enemies, it raised its head towards the sky, its mouth agape, as if swallowing something.</p><p>Upon its reappearance, the Dharma Idol's form deteriorated rapidly, showing signs of dissipating.</p><p>Meanwhile, the three surrounding black fish phantoms grew increasingly solid, mirroring the Black Fish Dharma Idol's posture, their mouths also wide open.</p><p>In fact, the three black fish phantoms had moved earlier, but Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren, preoccupied with the Swallowing Sea Clam, hadn't noticed.</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Qin Sang.  He suddenly recalled the scene of Ling Youwang drawing upon water-type elemental energy to attack him.  His expression grew grave, and he called out, "Senior, be careful..."</p><p>There were illusions containing water vapor nearby, although they weren't directly connected to the Jungle Domain.</p><p>Before he could finish his warning...</p><p>The sky abruptly darkened, and an abnormally dense concentration of water vapor materialized from an unknown source, gathering into clouds high above.</p><p>The next moment, torrential rain poured down.</p><p>In a matter of moments, the earth transformed into a lake, the water steadily rising, already submerging half the height of the trees.</p><p>A shimmering, fiery, azure light enveloped the Black Fish Dharma Idol.</p><p>Ling Youwang's face was contorted in a grimace, his eyes burning with hatred.  He had come to despise Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren with a passion.  He was forced to sacrifice his Dharma Idol, unleashing a technique that shouldn't be accessible to a Hollow Profound Realm cultivator, just to have a chance of escaping.</p><p>If he hesitated any longer, and his strength dwindled further, even sacrificing his Dharma Idol wouldn't be enough to execute this technique.</p><p>A feeling of suffocation washed over Qin Sang as he sensed the terrifying, overwhelming force of the water.  He was deeply alarmed. This was likely a true Demon King technique!</p><p>Then, Zuo Zhenren calmly replied, "It's fine."</p><p>His tone exuded confidence, as if he had been anticipating this moment all along, reassuring Qin Sang somewhat.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The downpour ceased abruptly, seemingly anticlimactic.</p><p>However, the sky didn't clear.  Thick water vapor filled the entire space, and a dense fog hung over the jungle.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren suddenly heard the ethereal sound of waves.</p><p>Without warning, the surrounding scenery transformed dramatically.  The space became a deep lake, and the ancient trees, the Golden Armored soldiers, Qin Sang, and Zuo Zhenren were all submerged beneath the surface.</p><p>The mortal world was like water, and all living beings were fish within it. At this moment, Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren had become fish trapped underwater.</p><p>The water's surface became a tangible boundary, impassable to those without exceptional techniques.</p><p>This scene was both real and illusory.</p><p>The world Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren perceived remained unchanged.  They couldn't feel the water, nor could they see the boundary.  Yet, Ling Youwang had vanished before their eyes.</p><p>His disappearance was sudden and unexpected.</p><p>"As expected of the Dao soldiers and descendants of Demon Gods meticulously selected by the sages of old, their bloodlines are truly extraordinary..."</p><p>Zuo Zhenren murmured, unable to help but admire Ling Youwang's technique.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>A spray of water erupted from the calm surface, and a black fish leaped out.</p><p>Its body arched like a crescent moon.  After breaking free from the water, it soared upwards without looking back.</p><p>Its tail flickered slightly.</p><p>A carp leaping over the dragon gate!</p><p>Wherever the black fish passed, water vapor followed, continuously spreading upwards.  The scenery changed wherever the water vapor touched.</p><p>Even the sky barrier was pushed downwards by the rising water surface, which continued to ascend, about to surpass the Jungle Domain, even piercing through the illusionary layer above, and perhaps even further.</p><p>As he ascended, Ling Youwang's Dharma Idol continued to burn away, gradually revealing his true form.</p><p>His true form was indeed a black fish, with a tail that had almost fully transformed into a dragon's tail.</p><p>He looked exhausted, his scales dull, but he didn't dare to stop, using all his remaining strength to distance himself from the battlefield, to escape this place.</p><p>Even though he would be severely weakened after escaping, as long as he reached a place rich in water-type elemental energy, he could still cling to life.</p><p>Finally, Ling Youwang broke through the sky barrier.</p><p>"Faster! Faster!"</p><p>Ling Youwang urged himself inwardly.</p><p>The enemy was still below, seemingly unaware of his technique, still searching for him blindly.</p><p>Fortunately, Zuo Fengdao's cultivation had also been reduced to the Hollow Profound Realm, limiting his spiritual sense, otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to maintain the deception for long.</p><p>This thought crossed his mind, but before Ling Youwang could breathe a sigh of relief, he caught a glimpse of a faint green light from the corner of his eye.</p><p>The green light clung to the edge of the sky barrier, appearing inconspicuous.</p><p>Yet, after a single glance, Ling Youwang couldn't tear his eyes away.</p><p>The green light flashed, blocking his path.  Within the green light was a small seal, three inches long and two and a tenth inches wide.</p><p>This seal was carved from green jade.  Its knob was broken, with clear signs of fracture.  The seal itself was missing a corner, and the inscription on its face was incomplete, with scratches marring the remaining characters.</p><p>"North... Slay... Ghost..."</p><p>Upon deciphering the fragmented inscription, Ling Youwang's eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>Could this be... the North Pole Ghost-Slaying Seal?!</p><p>The North Pole Ghost-Slaying Seal, one of the legendary divine seals of the Daoist sect, originated from the North Pole Evil-Banishing Court, specifically designed to slay demons, ghosts, and evil spirits.  Its power was boundless.</p><p>Ever since the collapse of the Divine Court and the decline of the Dao Court, this divine seal had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Some speculated that it had been destroyed in the devastating war that led to the Daoist sect's downfall.</p><p>Countless Daoist experts had perished in that battle, and countless Daoist treasures had been destroyed.</p><p>Daoists believed that seals were the embodiment of heaven and earth's trust, usable for inscribing talismans, casting spells, forming altars, summoning generals, performing rituals, and even for presenting memorials, subduing evil, refining power, and praying for blessings.</p><p>Over many years, Daoist masters had refined numerous divine seals, but very few had survived.</p><p>There were also legends that the North Pole Ghost-Slaying Seal had appeared in the final battle, not completely destroyed, and that the remaining fragment had fallen into the hands of the Ju Shan Zhi Zhi Altar.</p><p>Another rumor claimed that the fragment had been retrieved by the North Pole Evil-Banishing Court and enshrined in White Stone Zhi, and that the current Daoist sect lacked the ability to restore the divine seal.</p><p>The North Pole Ghost-Slaying Seal was actually in Zuo Fengdao's possession, and he could wield it!</p><p>Even though it was only a fragment!</p><p>'Hum!'</p><p>The North Pole Ghost-Slaying Seal flashed towards him, its face directed at Ling Youwang, emitting a gentle green light that filled him with terror.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang and Zuo Zhenren looked up at the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang had, at some point, summoned the Five Elements Crown, holding it in his palm.  The crown spun gently, and five-colored divine light pierced the sky, penetrating the barrier!</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
