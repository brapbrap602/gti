Chapter 270: The Cyan Lotus That Hates Fire

"These divine objects should have ended up in the hands of Yuan Ying ancestors, right?" Qin Sang said with a sigh.

The locations where the ten divine trees emerged were always surrounded by danger, which kept cultivators with weaker cultivation away.

If one's cultivation was too weak, even if they obtained the treasure by chance, it could become their downfall and attract a murderous disaster.

"Not necessarily!" Wanderer shook his head. "Among these three times, there was once that included a kind of spiritual bamboo, which was one of the ten divine trees' stand-up wood—the Qingfu Zheng Bamboo. At that time, there was no lack of Yuan Ying and transformed great demons participating in the fight. It is said that the Qingfu Zheng Bamboo ran away by itself. It is still missing now, and there has been no news of anyone using a magic weapon refined with the Qingfu Zheng Bamboo."

"It escaped under the eyes of Yuan Ying and great transformed demons?" Qin Sang was stunned. "Could it be that the Qingfu Zheng Bamboo had developed spiritual intelligence and become a transformed demon?"

"It's hard to say; it could be hidden by someone too. It is very difficult for demons to transform, especially for those at the level of the ten divine trees. When they develop spiritual intelligence, it is likely to cause the envy of the heavens. The transformation disaster must not be that easy to overcome. After all, the true way of immortals is so difficult…"

It seemed that Wanderer was thinking about his own cultivation path. He gave a deep sigh. Qin Sang thought about everything he had experienced along the way and felt sympathetic.

"What about the second time?" Qin Sang asked.

"The second time was the ten divine trees' Blood Bodhi Tree. This tree is said to be the most defiled tree in the legends. Magic weapons forged with the Blood Bodhi Tree could unleash a divine ability called the Blood Defilement Radiance. The Blood Defilement Radiance could taint others' dharma instruments and magic weapons. Weapons with slightly inferior qualities may be destroyed directly. Even magic weapons would suffer great losses of spirituality if they were struck by the Blood Defilement Radiance. They would need to be cultivated for a long time to restore their power.

"It is said that the emerged Blood Bodhi Tree was accidentally destroyed while it was being fought over by several Nascent Soul cultivators from the demonic sects. Its shards fell into the depths of the Boundless Valley. There are still cultivators entering the valley to search for the tree, hoping to find a piece of it. After all, a divine ability like the Blood Defilement Radiance can easily secure victory in combat.

"However, the Boundless Valley is not so easy to break into. As the saying goes, men die for riches as birds die for food. If you can't find the treasure, you may lose your life."

Wanderer said with some irony.

"Boundless Valley?" Qin Sang recalled carefully but did not seem to have heard of this name before. There did not seem to be a secret realm in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield called Boundless Valley.

Wanderer smiled. "The Boundless Valley is not in the Ancient Immortal Battlefield but a forbidden land deep in the Severed Sky Mountain. Most of the cultivators who enter this place are from the demonic sects, and there are countless cultivators who die inside. It is not an exaggeration to describe it as a place where corpses are strewn all over the fields."

Qin Sang nodded slightly. It turned out to be the Severed Sky Mountain.

The Severed Sky Mountain was vast and boundless. There were also many forbidden places in the wilderness, and each of them was extremely dangerous.

"The third time was even more interesting.

"It is still unclear which of the ten divine trees emerged this time. Shortly after the incident, the Pure Sun Sect suddenly launched a large-scale attack on the Blood Fiend Sect and annihilated this major demonic sect with its own strength. The Blood Fiend Sect's Sect Master was killed on the spot, shocking the entire Small Cold Domain!

"Later, there were rumors that the person who obtained the divine tree was a disciple from the Blood Fiend Sect with a low cultivation.

"Outsiders have been talking about whether these two incidents are related, but the truth is still unknown.

"However, there was a message that was suspected to have been released by the Pure Sun Sect later on. It said that the Blood Fiend Sect disciple had already escaped with the ten divine trees and left the Small Cold Domain.

"Only the Pure Sun Sect knows the truth of the matter."

Wanderer said, his tone a little playful.

So, the Pure Sun Sect destroyed the Blood Fiend Sect because of this.

Qin Sang nodded slightly. The Pure Sun Sect was undoubtedly the number one sect among the Eight Major Righteous Sects. The cultivation of the Pure Sun Sect's Sect Master was second to none in the Small Cold Domain, so no one would dare to go to the sect to verify the truth.

"Senior, I've almost recovered from my injuries. Let me take over the bamboo boat." Qin Sang stood up and took the initiative to replace Wanderer.

Wanderer was also exhausted. He naturally had no objections. He told Qin Sang how to control the spiritual bamboo boat. Nevertheless, with Qin Sang's help, he could still control the bamboo boat.

The bamboo boat moved through the ground at high speed. Even the gorgeous and magnificent lava flow scenes had become boring to look at.

Qin Sang took a glance at Wanderer and sighed secretly. "I hope that the trial space is not too far away from the stone tablet. I hope that nothing else happens."

The two of them took turns steering the boat. They steadily controlled the spiritual bamboo boat, leaving the fire spirit beast far behind them. Everything was safe and sound.

Once again, Qin Sang felt that his spiritual power had been depleted to a certain extent. He gave way to Wanderer. Wanderer looked at Qin Sang in surprise and hesitated to speak.

"Brother Qin...forgive my bluntness, but does your dantian and sea of Qi carry some hidden wounds?"

Qin Sang was taken aback, then suddenly understood. Although he had always taken care to conceal the damage to the foundation, the fire spirit beast had pursued him relentlessly, making it impossible for him to manoeuvre the Spirit Bamboo Flying Boat without using his full power. There was no way he could have concealed it perfectly.

Yun Youzi was proficient in the art of inner alchemy of medicines; it was natural for him to discover some clues.

Qin Sang had the Ebony Sword and the Ten Directions Yama Banner with him, and he was not afraid of cultivators of the same realm.

Moreover, Yun Youzi could only tell that his sea of Qi was damaged, but he could not see the extent of the damage or how serious it was with the naked eye.

Because of this, Qin Sang was not afraid of being seen through by Yun Youzi.

In addition, Qin Sang did indeed have a plan to ask a person skilled in the art of inner alchemy of medicines to teach him, and find a way to repair the foundation. Yun Youzi was on the list of candidates.

Since it had been discovered, Qin Sang calmly said, "Senior has a keen eye. In order to break through to the Foundation Establishment,  I used a secret technique, resulting in some damage to the sea of Qi. Although it does not have much impact on cultivation, I have tried various methods, but I have not been able to cure it. It exists like a thorn that cannot be removed, leaving me helpless."

Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Yun Youzi suddenly smiled, which surprised Qin Sang greatly.

"Brother Qin, you and I are truly destined to meet each other. Do you know that the hidden danger left by your humble servant in order to break through the Foundation Establishment is the Yuanshen? It is also similar to yours, becoming a chronic disease. I have run around for many years to find a spirit medicine to restore the Yuanshen, but unfortunately I have not been able to improve it. Just now, the spirit medicine I encountered under the earth was Lesser Flaming Azure Lotus. I thought...but the Azure Lotus seeds are gone..."

Yun Youzi's smile disappeared, his brows furrowed, and wrinkles appeared. His eyes held a deep weariness and regret, and he let out a deep sigh.

"If I cannot cure the chronic disease, not only will the Golden Elixir be hopeless in this life, but it remains to be seen whether I can break through to the middle stage of the Foundation Establishment..."

The Lesser Flaming Azure Lotus was a rare spirit medicine. The Azure Lotus would produce twelve Azure Lotus seeds, but these Azure Lotus seeds would eventually merge into one, and the medicinal effect could reach its peak.

The Azure Lotus seeds had the effect of nourishing the soul  and strengthening the Yuanshen. They were a spirit medicine that one could only hope to encounter, not seek.

It was a great pity to encounter the Lesser Flaming Azure Lotus but it did not have the most important Azure Lotus seeds.

Fortunately, Yun Youzi had a resolute will, and after experiencing the shock of great joy and great sorrow, he could still face it calmly. When talking about this, he only showed a sense of loss.
