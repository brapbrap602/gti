<h1>Chapter 1008: Emergence</h1><p>Bai was merely weak, with no visible injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang briefly learned about his ordeal, then asked, "Daoist friend, how many places did you visit?  What do you recall?"</p><p>Bai's tone was not optimistic, "I spent too long in the North Sea's Rain Desert, searching to no avail, and then hastily went to the Witch God Continent of the Witch Tribe. These two places should be the most likely to trigger my memories.  Apart from that, I only made cursory visits, exploring several ancient secret realms mentioned in legends, but found nothing familiar. My earlier guess was probably right: the Seven Killing Hall and the Canglang Sea were likely unrelated in ancient times; they only ended up here after the cataclysmic changes, for some unknown reason."</p><p>"If so, Daoist friend, come back to Xiaohan Domain with me. The Ziwei Palace and the Seven Killing Hall have intricate connections; perhaps it might help you remember something.  And the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall…"</p><p>Qin Sang recounted the message from Ning Wuhuai, "The Seven Killing Hall will emerge within two years. Daoist friend, recover your cultivation as soon as possible and avoid going out."</p><p>"Two years? Such a short time, it's indeed not good to go out. I'll go into seclusion now and not disturb you further."</p><p>Bai readily agreed and returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>After seeing Bai off, Qin Sang didn't immediately close himself off for cultivation. He first checked his Qianjun Ring, ensuring nothing was amiss, then summoned the demon banners.</p><p>This time, he summoned all nine.</p><p>The nine demon banners formed an array, whose power ranked among the top-tier of high-grade magic treasures. However, controlling the banners was more difficult than controlling a true high-grade magic treasure.</p><p>Foundation Establishment cultivators fortunate enough to obtain a high-grade magic treasure, even if it's not their lifebound treasure, could still wield it, although not at full power.</p><p>But the demon banners were different. If one's strength was insufficient, they couldn't suppress the backlash of the Nine Nether Demon Fire, making forced usage impossible.</p><p>After his breakthrough in both cultivation and physique, Qin Sang had been practicing manipulating the nine demon banners in formation. He found that his biggest limitation was his spiritual sense.</p><p>After the Blackwood Sword was merged with the Soul-Nurturing Wood, it had the effect of nurturing the soul and refining the spiritual sense. Qin Sang's spiritual sense gradually transformed; although the changes were not drastic, over time, he could feel a definite improvement.</p><p>"Refined spiritual sense makes it easier for me to control the magic treasure. I can give it a try."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the nine fluttering demon banners before him, murmuring, "In these two years, I will focus on mastering the array of the nine demon banners. Even if I can only unleash a few strikes, it can still serve as a trump card."</p><p>Then Qin Sang sighed again, "Many Nascent Soul masters will enter the inner hall of the Seven Killing Hall this time. In front of those people, it's best not to reveal the demon banners, lest I invite more trouble. Speaking of which, I wonder where Old Devil Mu has hidden himself. Will he enter the Seven Killing Hall this time?"</p><p>…</p><p>Time passed unnoticed in cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Bai spent two years in diligent cultivation.</p><p>One day,</p><p>Qin Sang was in seclusion when he suddenly felt the restriction being triggered. With a gesture, a message talisman flew into his palm.</p><p>After perceiving the contents of the message talisman, Qin Sang abruptly stood up, "It's finally here!"</p><p>Quickly gathering his belongings, Qin Sang stepped out of his cave dwelling and woke Bai, who was also in seclusion.</p><p>"The Seven Killing Hall is about to emerge?"</p><p>Bai was also delighted at the news. He looked around, puzzled, "Where is Ning Wuhuai?"</p><p>"Daoist Ning sent a message saying that as a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect, he needs to go to the Seven Killing Hall with his fellow sect members. We will go ahead and meet up inside the Seven Killing Hall,"</p><p>Qin Sang explained.</p><p>Bai nodded, asking no further questions, and retreated into the corpse puppet bag.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly left the city, then activated his escape light and headed straight towards East Gate Island.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang returned to East Gate Island and found that many cultivators had already gathered there.</p><p>Qin Sang found an inn and waited for news.</p><p>In the following days, more and more cultivators arrived on the island.</p><p>The biggest difference from the previous two times was that Nascent Soul cultivators frequently appeared among these cultivators, including Grand Masters from top sects. The lone cultivators also possessed noticeably stronger strengths than before.</p><p>Although the self-emergence of the Seven Killing Hall eliminated the need to expend a large amount of precious spiritual materials to set up top-tier spiritual arrays, the requirements for cultivators entering the Seven Killing Hall were even higher.</p><p>Without a jade talisman to protect them, cultivators not only risked getting lost in the storm but also had to face the Seven Killing Hall's grand array directly.</p><p>However, the outer defensive array of the Seven Killing Hall would not be fully opened, and it still possessed incredible power.</p><p>Only Nascent Soul Grand Masters or those with sufficient strength could pass through the array and enter the Seven Killing Hall. Those who were not strong enough would perish within the array.</p><p>However, with Qin Sang's strength, he didn't need to worry about the outer defensive array.</p><p>A small island like East Gate Island, yet so many Nascent Soul Grand Masters were present.</p><p>All the Jindan-stage cultivators were unusually well-behaved. They found an inn or a cave and didn't come out, fearing they might cause a misunderstanding or offend the Yuan Ying masters.</p><p>Day after day passed, and the atmosphere on the island grew increasingly tense.</p><p>Until late one night, ten days later.</p><p>As if by prearrangement, the Yuan Ying masters suddenly emerged from seclusion together.</p><p>In an instant, colorful escaping lights lit up the sky above Dongmen Island, their powerful auras unmistakable.</p><p>"Old Man Mu, you dare enter the Seven Killing Hall? Aren't you afraid of perishing inside?  Wasn't your Mu family stronghold wiped out by Old Devil Duan?" A strange laugh echoed through the air.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a gray escaping light veered sharply, approaching a green one.</p><p>Two figures could be seen within the green light, a portly elder and a young woman. The elder remained unperturbed, calmly smiling, "Old Devil Duan hasn't dared to show his face for over a hundred years since I severely injured him last time. Besides, his heavenly tribulation was fifty years ago.  Knowing him as I do, unless he obtains a miraculous opportunity, his chances of surviving it were less than one in ten. What's there to worry about?"</p><p>"Your heavenly tribulation is approaching too, Old Man Mu, isn't it? Even if you don't perish in the Seven Killing Hall, you'll likely follow in Old Devil Duan's footsteps soon enough. I wonder if you two will fight once you get to the underworld?"</p><p>The gray escaping light and the portly elder flew side by side. Noticing the young woman beside the elder, the figure in the gray light exclaimed in surprise, "You even brought your precious granddaughter?  You wouldn't be…"</p><p>The portly elder sighed, "How many more years do you think you have than I do? The path to immortality is severed, and the heavenly tribulation is imminent.  Old age, sickness, and death – even the strongest among us cannot avoid them. If I can gain something in the Seven Killing Hall, I might survive a little longer. If I fail, I can only pave the way for my descendants before my demise. I heard you have two promising disciples. Why didn't you bring them?"</p><p>The person in the gray escaping light chuckled, "I'm not like you, Old Man Mu! The celestial array in the Seven Killing Hall exerts a strange suppression on us Yuan Ying cultivators. Bringing disciples would only weaken me. I'm not ready to die yet, so I'm giving it my all."</p><p>As they spoke, the Yuan Ying masters flew further away.</p><p>Only then did Qin Sang and the others dare to move.</p><p>One escaping light after another soared from Dongmen Island, following the Yuan Ying masters like shooting stars towards the east.</p>
