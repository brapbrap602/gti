<h1>Chapter 1166: Hukou Pass</h1><p>Tan Yien had already departed for Cangheng Island.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by the two birds, entered the Heavenly Demon Hills and then proceeded northward to reach the City of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p>...</p><p>The City of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p>One of the Seven Great Passes, it served as the gateway for demonic beings to enter and exit the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>After the demonic race took control of the Heavenly Demon Hills, they secured this pass, and it had never changed hands since. The other great passes had, to varying degrees, been affected by internal strife among the human race.</p><p>All demonic cultivators who wished to enter or exit the Ancient Immortal Battlefield had to pass through the City of Ten Thousand Demons.</p><p>The current ruler of the City of Ten Thousand Demons was none other than the renowned Feather Demon King.</p><p>The City of Ten Thousand Demons was quite different from the Immortal-Demon City. Qin Sang wanted to see what a true demonic city looked like, so he entered alone, while Fat Chicken and White Crane waited for a while before following him in.</p><p>Upon entering the City of Ten Thousand Demons, Qin Sang's first impression was that the place was bustling with "human activity."</p><p>The city was primarily inhabited by mortals.</p><p>The streets were filled with people coming and going, orderly and peaceful, presenting a scene of prosperity.</p><p>These people had been living under the rule of the Demon King since birth, so they were long accustomed to seeing demonic beasts striding boldly through the streets.</p><p>The demonic beasts allowed into the city were all great demons who had been enlightened and awakened to intelligence.</p><p>The Feather Demon King had established strict rules, and after entering the city, Qin Sang did not witness any incidents of demonic beasts harming mortals.</p><p>However, the world of cultivation was not one of warmth and tenderness. Just as humans hunted demonic beasts, extracting their bones and skins to use as spiritual materials for alchemy and artifact forging, the demonic race would not simply raise so many humans for nothing. Some things were better left unexamined.</p><p>Not long after entering the city.</p><p>While Qin Sang was strolling through the city, a commotion suddenly broke out ahead, and the crowd parted to either side.</p><p>A dark mass appeared in front—a group of armored demon wolves galloping down the street, charging forward. The leader of the demon wolves was a massive figure, exuding a bloodthirsty aura that was extremely intimidating.</p><p>On its back was an exquisite saddle, upon which sat a strange demonic beast that resembled a fox but was even smaller, with unusually short forelegs—a *bei* demon.</p><p>The aura emanating from this demon was stronger than that of Fat Chicken and White Crane, indicating it was a great demon at the late Core Formation stage. Otherwise, it would not have been able to command the demon wolf leader to serve as its mount.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped in his tracks, realizing that he had been exposed.</p><p>Fat Chicken and White Crane flashed in front of Qin Sang, shielding him.</p><p>*Rumble...*</p><p>The demon wolves moved in unison, clearly targeting Qin Sang and his companions. As they approached, they came to an abrupt halt, exuding immense pressure.</p><p>Qin Sang stood with his hands behind his back, his expression calm.</p><p>Fat Chicken and White Crane bristled, issuing a warning.</p><p>The *bei* demon leaped down from the demon wolf and walked upright toward them, bowing respectfully. "Dare I ask if the esteemed senior is the Young Master of the Thousand Bamboo Sea, the Moonlight Demon King? Our king has prepared a palace for you. I have been ordered by the king to receive you, esteemed seniors."</p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, gasps of surprise rippled through the crowd on the street, and the gazes directed at Qin Sang were filled with both reverence and fear.</p><p>"Young Master?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. The title wasn't bad, so he nodded, signaling the *bei* demon to lead the way.</p><p>Under the guidance of the *bei* demon, they made their way to the Demon King's palace.</p><p>That place was the stronghold of the demonic race. Qin Sang estimated that among the human race's Nascent Soul cultivators, few would dare to stride so boldly and alone into such a place.</p><p>"Which other demon kings are attending the council?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>The *bei* demon replied, "Reporting to the esteemed senior, the Red-Tailed Demon King arrived the earliest, three days ago. Then came the Snake King..."</p><p>After listening to the *bei* demon's account, Qin Sang realized that nearly half of the demon kings from the Heavenly Demon Hills had arrived. The council was still three days away, and more demon kings were sure to come.</p><p>Like him, they were likely drawn by the news of the Purple Micro Palace.</p><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>During these days, several demon kings, including the Li Hong Demon King, came to visit. Qin Sang, intending to build connections, got to know a few of them.</p><p>One of them was the Red-Tailed Demon King mentioned by the *bei* demon. He was a red fox who had achieved enlightenment, taking on the form of a handsome young man with a strikingly conspicuous red tail.</p><p>The name "Red-Tailed Demon King" came from this feature.</p><p>He claimed to have long admired the Bamboo Demon and was quite enthusiastic toward Qin Sang. Qin Sang wasn't sure if this was genuine, but he played along and managed to learn many secrets about the demonic race from him.</p><p>Qin Sang ordered the two birds to stay at the palace and walked side by side with the Red-Tailed Demon King toward the Feather King's Palace.</p><p>The Feather King's Palace had always been the residence of successive Feather Demon Kings, and this council was also being held there.</p><p>The Red-Tailed Demon King dismissed the guiding demons and led Qin Sang through familiar paths toward the Feather King's Palace.</p><p>"The Feather King has been rather secretive, but according to convention, since the Purple Micro Palace has been mentioned, there must be some news. In the past few times the Purple Micro Palace appeared, the Bamboo Demon never showed up. This time, he sent you, Moonlight Daoist. Does he intend to compete for the next opportunity to enter the Purple Micro Palace?"</p><p>The Red-Tailed Demon King pointed out and introduced the surrounding buildings to Qin Sang while asking curiously.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly shook his head. "My master did not mention anything about entering the Purple Micro Palace. He sent me here mainly to gather information about the situation on the front lines."</p><p>The Red-Tailed Demon King nodded in understanding and sighed. "If the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance truly cannot withstand the Sin Abyss, given the Sin Abyss's domineering ways, the agreement between us and the human race will likely be hard to maintain. Peace may be difficult to come by in the future. But if we fully support them in resisting the Sin Abyss, causing us to suffer heavy losses, it would be the most foolish choice. The balance is indeed hard to strike. However, these are the Feather King's headaches..."</p><p>"Even so, we cannot remain indifferent. I have no desire to retreat into the Demon Sea and spend my days surrounded by ice," Qin Sang replied, shaking his head.</p><p>Over the past few days, he had been probing the attitudes of the demon kings, both openly and subtly.</p><p>As expected, the demonic race had little interest in getting involved in the human race's internal conflicts. The best course of action was to watch from the sidelines, placing bets on both sides to avoid offending either.</p><p>But the Frost Domain and the Heavenly Alliance were not fools. They would not allow the demonic race to sit back comfortably.</p><p>Currently, although the Heavenly Demon Hills had sent demonic troops to reinforce the front lines, few demon kings had actually joined the battle.</p><p>Those demon kings were now stationed with their troops at a pass called Hukou Pass, said to be a strategically important location, though somewhat remote. The likelihood of the Sin Abyss launching a major attack there was small.</p><p>Outside Hukou Pass, a division of the Sin Abyss faced them. The two sides seemed to have an unspoken understanding, engaging only in minor skirmishes.</p><p>As they spoke, a dense forest appeared ahead, its shadows looming.</p><p>"We're here! The Feather King's Palace is inside!" the Red-Tailed Demon King whispered as a reminder.</p><p>Qin Sang focused his gaze and saw an ancient wooden hall at the center of the forest, suspended in mid-air. Flickering green spiritual light surrounded it, and dense, powerful restrictions filled the air.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, you've finally arrived!"</p><p>A figure emerged from the forest—the Li Hong Demon King himself had come out to greet them.</p><p>He had long since abandoned any designs on the Thousand Bamboo Sea and was now quite enthusiastic toward Qin Sang. "Moonlight Daoist, the Feather King has heard that you are the Bamboo Demon's disciple and has been eager to see what kind of outstanding talent could inherit the Bamboo Demon's legacy."</p><p>...</p><p>After some pleasantries, the three of them entered the forest together and arrived at the gates of the Feather King's Palace.</p><p>The Li Hong Demon King pushed the doors open and entered.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes immediately fell upon a man seated in the center, clad in feathered robes—the Feather Demon King who, years ago, had used a rare treasure to open the grand formation of the Purple Micro Palace!</p>
