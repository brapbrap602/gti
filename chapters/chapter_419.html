<h1>Chapter 412: The Sword Pavilion</h1><p>Time passed.</p><p>Seven days flew by.</p><p>At the Hui Long Guan, everything was as usual.</p><p>Inside the cave, the sword light and blood light, which had once been evenly matched, finally reached a conclusion. The Blood Mulberry retreated to a corner, its blood light reduced to a thin layer on its surface, its luster dulled, unable to withstand the aggressive black wood sword.</p><p>The sword light contracted, completely enveloping the Blood Mulberry, resembling an egg floating in mid-air.</p><p>The killing talismans shone brightly, operating autonomously, helping the black wood sword to erode the blood light.</p><p>The last trace of blood light was gradually worn away, revealing the true form of the Blood Mulberry—a perfectly uniform piece of blood wood without a single speck of impurity.</p><p>As Qin Sang's consciousness approached the blood wood, he felt a subtle sense of being tainted by it. This divine wood was too uncanny; he wondered if other divine woods possessed similar abilities.</p><p>Qin Sang eagerly awaited the transformation of the black wood sword after it had refined the Blood Mulberry, anticipating a pleasant surprise.</p><p>He moved with utmost care, manipulating the sword energy to slowly refine the Blood Mulberry.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's ceaseless refinement, the Blood Mulberry melted like ice, turning into blood.  Surprisingly, the Blood Mulberry contained no impurities; the entire piece of spirit wood was pure essence.</p><p>Qin Sang opened his eyes, gazing intently at the blood, then after a moment, with a thought, the black wood sword trembled slightly, its light flashed, and it plunged into the blood.</p><p>The sword body also melted, merging with the blood, forming a sword embryo.</p><p>The sword embryo was unstable.</p><p>For a time, it was unclear whether the black wood sword was consuming the Blood Mulberry, or vice versa.</p><p>However, within the blood, the three killing talismans remained steady as ever, like three anchors, firmly suppressing the sword embryo until everything stabilized.</p><p>At this point, both the black wood sword and the Blood Mulberry had disappeared. Before Qin Sang was only a sword embryo.</p><p>The sword embryo was two-toned.</p><p>Qin Sang could sense that the black wood sword was refining the power of the divine wood. When the red color completely disappeared and the embryo became clear, the black wood sword would be transformed!</p><p>However, this process would be very slow.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the sword embryo into his primordial spirit, entering a meditative state to carefully understand it. After a full day, Qin Sang opened his eyes, his expression serious; his premonition had come true.</p><p>A small amount of blood, after a whole day, the black wood sword had only refined an insignificant trace.</p><p>At this rate, it would take nearly forty years to completely refine the Blood Mulberry!</p><p>During this process, the black wood sword would remain in its embryo form, its actual body extremely fragile and unsuitable for combat. It must remain nurtured within his primordial spirit.</p><p>Thankfully, with the help of the three killing talismans, the black wood sword could autonomously refine the divine wood, without requiring Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>Even so, the time was far too long!</p><p>The black wood sword in its embryo form couldn't even be used in combat, let alone bear new killing talismans. This meant Qin Sang had to wait until the black wood sword had completely consumed the Blood Mulberry before he could break through to the late Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>He possessed the Blood Droplet Ghost Mushroom and the Li Long Pill, among other precious elixirs. After several life-or-death battles in the Wuya Valley, he had a deep understanding of the four killing talismans. He originally expected to break through to the late Foundation Establishment stage within a decade or two.</p><p>Because of the black wood sword, it would now take nearly forty years.</p><p>Too long.</p><p>However, this problem was not insurmountable; otherwise, Qin Sang wouldn't have acted so rashly. He should at least wait until he reached the late Foundation Establishment stage before refining the Blood Mulberry.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a jade slip, the one given to him by Shopkeeper Wu. It contained the refining insights of Wu's ancestors, as well as even more valuable insights on crafting magic treasures.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had a hunch, and now he was certain: the black wood sword's absorption of the spirit wood was also a process of refining.</p><p>The insights in the jade slip would be helpful for the black wood sword.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang could comprehend the contents of the jade slip and achieve a certain level of mastery in the Dao of Refinement, he could significantly reduce the time it took for the black wood sword to absorb the spirit wood.</p><p>Of course, comprehending the jade slip would not be easy.</p><p>Qin Sang had no foundation in the Dao of Refinement and would have to start from scratch, gradually accumulating knowledge.</p><p>The Dao of Refinement encompassed a vast expanse of knowledge, and mastery couldn't be achieved overnight, but fortunately, he didn't need to delve into other aspects; focusing on the refining of spirit swords would suffice.</p><p>Moreover, he didn't need to actually refine high-quality magic tools; merely understanding the principles within the jade slip during the refining process and applying them to the refinement of the black wood sword would be highly beneficial.</p><p>Learning this would not be wasted effort in the future.</p><p>The 《Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter》cultivation technique is special. The practitioner's natal spirit sword resides within the primordial spirit, allowing them to refine a second natal magic treasure, kept in the dantian and nurtured by the dantian fire.</p><p>This experience would also be useful in the future, during the process of refining natal magic treasures after forming the Core.</p><p>The contents of the jade slip, Qin Sang had reviewed countless times.  After grasping the basics, he hit a wall, realizing the need for practical experience.</p><p>Therefore, he rented a secluded cave dwelling in Qingyang Market, complete with a small, unassuming shop. The dual identities of refiner and shopkeeper served as excellent camouflage, a multi-faceted advantage.</p><p>…</p><p>Qingyang Market.</p><p>In a quiet alleyway, a small, unremarkable shop opened its doors without fanfare or grand announcements.  A simple sign hung above the entrance, bearing only two elegantly written characters: "Sword Pavilion."</p><p>The calligraphy exuded a strong sword intent, an unusual quality and perhaps the only notable feature of this humble establishment.  Despite its name, the shop didn't primarily sell spirit swords; instead, it offered a variety of low-quality magical artifacts, filling the shelves.</p><p>A Foundation Establishment cultivator, passing by and noticing the new shop's bold name, was intrigued.  He entered, took a quick look, and left muttering angrily.  Even low-level Qi Condensation cultivators wouldn't bother with such inferior items.</p><p>Many similar small shops existed in the market, barely making ends meet. However, these new shopkeepers seemed unreliable, often working alone and operating inconsistently; some shops were closed for days at a time within the first half-month of opening.</p><p>Deserted and struggling to survive, they probably couldn't even afford the rent.</p><p>Qin Sang was the owner of the "Sword Pavilion."</p><p>Due to its location, this cave dwelling, despite including the shop, was not significantly more expensive than others, perfectly fitting Qin Sang's needs.  After researching ancient texts at Baota Peak, he brought along several refining manuals from the Shao Hua Mountain collection before leaving his sect and returning to Qingyang Market to open his small shop.</p><p>He had only recently arrived and hadn't yet begun to seriously study the art of refining.  The artifacts in the shop weren't his own creations, but rather a collection of items gathered over the years – a display to give the shop some presence. He priced them low, not really expecting to sell them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't need the meager amount of spirit stones they could fetch.  His pouch wasn't lacking valuable items; he planned to gradually release them, interspersed with his own refined artifacts, once his refining skills improved.</p>
