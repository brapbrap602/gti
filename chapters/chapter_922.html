<h1>Chapter 914: Subordinates</h1><p>On Poison Island.</p><p>Qin Sang left his cave and stood on a hill, gazing down at the illusion formation below.</p><p>The three people who had disembarked from the flying shuttle had entered Poison Island and triggered the formation.</p><p>Although he didn't know the details, seeing their appearance and the sinister wind chasing close behind, Qin Sang could roughly guess what was happening.</p><p>He couldn't help but feel a little exasperated. He had been diligently cultivating in his cave, yet these bothersome people disturbed him, forcing him into this turmoil.</p><p>With his current cultivation level, unless a Nascent Soul cultivator personally intervened, he wasn't afraid of anyone, but less trouble was always preferable.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered how to handle the situation, he observed the trio's actions after landing on the island, as well as the cultivation levels of the scholar and the middle-aged beautiful woman. His expression shifted, revealing a thoughtful look.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to descend the hill to intervene, his eyes narrowed slightly, fixated on a shadowy figure outside Poison Island.</p><p>"A Core Formation old ghost, seems to be a demonic cultivator…"</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened.</p><p>Judging by the momentum and speed of the sinister wind, he had assumed the pursuers were at most Foundation Establishment cultivators.  He thought it was a dispute between Foundation Establishment cultivators, something he could easily handle.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a Core Formation cultivator was following.</p><p>It seemed things weren't so simple.</p><p>However, a Core Formation demonic cultivator was not enough to make Qin Sang change his mind. He glanced indifferently at the shadowy figure, then withdrew his gaze, his figure flashing down the hill.</p><p>To be safe, Qin Sang summoned his two-headed azure serpent and instructed them to keep a close watch on the illusion formation.</p><p>After landing on Poison Island, the scholar and the middle-aged beautiful woman entered the poisonous miasma and split up as planned.</p><p>The middle-aged beautiful woman took out a gauze curtain and wrapped it around herself and her daughter.</p><p>Due to having consumed the Yin Toad Pill, a faint black aura emanated from their bodies, allowing them to blend into the poisonous miasma. Combined with the Red Tassel Canopy's abilities, they could conceal themselves effectively.</p><p>The scholar, without looking back, rushed into the depths of Poison Island, intending to lure the Eagle King with his body.</p><p>The middle-aged beautiful woman wiped away her tears, resolutely turned, and flew in another direction, holding her daughter.</p><p>After flying for a short distance, both of them cried out in surprise, realizing they had fallen into a peculiar illusion formation.</p><p>The illusion formation was integrated with the power of the poisonous miasma and personally controlled by Qin Sang. How could mere Foundation Establishment cultivators break it?</p><p>The scholar, disoriented and frightened, hastily bowed towards the void and said, "Junior didn't know this was Senior's territory. I apologize for disturbing Senior. I hope Senior will forgive me."</p><p>The illusion formation remained silent.</p><p>Just as the scholar was filled with apprehension, a cold, aged voice suddenly came from above, "Forgive you? You have the audacity to disturb my cultivation and even lead so many cultivators here. Do you think I wouldn't dare take your lives?"</p><p>The scholar's heart sank upon hearing these words, secretly lamenting his misfortune.</p><p>This old fellow didn't sound friendly at all.</p><p>He thought it was just a poisonous island, but unexpectedly, it was occupied by this old demon and turned into a cultivation ground.</p><p>The Rotting Wing Eagle King, a being that even Core Formation cultivators feared, was silently eliminated by this old demon, and even its nest was occupied. There wasn't a whisper of this outside, showing how powerful the old demon was.</p><p>He hadn't even shaken off his pursuers, and now he had fallen into a demonic lair.</p><p>"Junior was disrespectful and is willing to bear full responsibility, submitting to Senior's judgment. My wife and daughter know nothing about this. I only hope Senior can spare them…"</p><p>A burst of eerie laughter echoed from the air, "Are you talking about them?"</p><p>The poisonous fog in front of the scholar rippled, transforming into a water mirror, reflecting the images of his wife and daughter. The middle-aged beautiful woman and the young girl had been separated. The girl had already woken up, both of their faces filled with panic and helplessness.</p><p>Seeing this, the scholar's expression tightened, and he immediately knelt on the ground, pleading, "Senior, they are innocent. Please show mercy and don't make things difficult for them. Junior is willing to be your servant…"</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>A cold snort came from the air, interrupting the scholar, "Don't bother putting on a show in front of me. Your pursuers have arrived, including that Core Formation demonic cultivator. I haven't decided how to deal with you yet. Perhaps I'll just hand you over to that fellow and curry favor with him…"</p><p>"No, Senior!"</p><p>The scholar cried out. He had initially harbored some hope after discovering the old demon on the island, but now he realized the old demon had seen through him all along.  Horrified, he hurriedly pleaded.</p><p>"Then it depends on your value, whether you're worth saving," the voice in the air paused. "Tell me your origins and why you provoked that person outside. Don't hide anything. If anything you say differs from what your wife says, I'll throw you out immediately."</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang stood directly above the scholar, looking down at him, while the scholar remained completely unaware.</p><p>He had witnessed the scholar and his wife's previous actions.  His motivation wasn't purely out of compassion.</p><p>Firstly, he didn't want his cave to be exposed prematurely. If these people didn't have any significant background, he would keep them all.</p><p>Secondly, Qin Sang happened to be short of helpers. The couple's actions demonstrated their deep love for their daughter, making them easier to control.</p><p>He expected to remain in secluded cultivation for a while, but he needed people to gather cultivation resources and gather information.</p><p>The scholar and his wife were Late Foundation Establishment and Mid Foundation Establishment cultivators, respectively.</p><p>With Qin Sang's discerning eye, he could easily tell that the couple's cultivation techniques were unusual, their true strength far exceeding their apparent level.</p><p>Of course, Qin Sang would also assess the situation.</p><p>If the forces they had provoked were too powerful, involving Nascent Soul ancestors, he would be powerless.</p><p>Although the scholar was terrified by the mysterious old demon's methods, he felt a glimmer of hope upon hearing that the demon might spare his family.</p><p>"My wife and I were originally cultivators from White Flame Valley, outside the Cleftwind Archipelago. We were forced to flee into the archipelago after provoking enemies. Over the years, we have been cautious, hiding and never harming anyone. Unexpectedly, during one of my daughter's outings, she was encountered by that demon's subordinates. They discovered that my daughter possesses a Water Jade Body and wanted to abduct her to be a cauldron…"</p><p>The scholar's eyes flickered, and he finally gritted his teeth and revealed everything, not daring to conceal a single detail.</p><p>"Water Jade Body?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly, and he chuckled, "I've heard that a Water Jade Body can condense Water Jade Qi in the Dantian, which has wondrous effects for certain compatible demonic cultivation techniques. No wonder there's such a commotion. White Flame Valley, I haven't heard of it. Now, tell me clearly, what are the origins of your former enemies and these people outside?"</p><p>The scholar, anxious and uneasy, felt relieved that Qin Sang didn't seem overly interested in his daughter. He quickly replied, "White Flame Valley is just a small sect. It's normal that Senior hasn't heard of it. Our former enemy is an elder of the Converging Light Sect. The person outside is a notorious demon in the vicinity, the Cave Master of the Sacrificial Demon Cave, along with his subordinates…"</p>
