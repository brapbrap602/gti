<h1>Chapter 816: Astonishing Ability</h1><p>Chapter 816: Astonishing Ability</p><p>Six months passed, and Qin Sang had gathered most of the information he needed.</p><p>The cultivators near Liangqiu Island held Luo Daotong in high regard, but very few had actually met him. Luo Daotong rarely appeared on Liangqiu Island.</p><p>Unlike the leader of the Hanhai Sect, he was a loner. He never took on disciples, didn't associate with others, and stayed out of power struggles.</p><p>This made things very difficult for Qin Sang.</p><p>He repeatedly spied on Liangqiu Island from a distance, observing the powerful protective formations shimmering with strange light. His only chance seemed to be waiting for Luo Daotong to leave the island.</p><p>However, there was no telling when that would be, and Qin Sang couldn't indefinitely stay at sea, risking missing the opportunity.</p><p>Patience was Qin Sang's strong suit. He cultivated while searching for a solution.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, another three months slipped by.</p><p>Late one night, Qin Sang sat cross-legged outside his cave, refining his body using the energy of the stars.  A faint starlight shimmered on his skin, which glowed with a healthy sheen.</p><p>Suddenly, he was startled and looked down at his dantian.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly had awakened!</p><p>Qin Sang's face lit up. He released the butterfly.</p><p>The transformed Tianmu Butterfly moved with more grace than before, flitting around Qin Sang, its form appearing and disappearing, a dreamlike spectacle under the starlight.</p><p>Aside from the patterns on its wings, its appearance hadn't changed significantly, but its aura was noticeably stronger.</p><p>The third transformation!</p><p>Feeling the butterfly's affection, Qin Sang smiled broadly and used his spiritual sense to communicate with it.</p><p>According to records, after its third transformation, the Tianmu Butterfly would possess the Tianmu ability, a powerful skill, though the descriptions were vague. He was naturally very curious.</p><p>As it was his spirit insect, communication was easy.</p><p>'Crackle!'</p><p>Suddenly, thunder erupted from the butterfly's wings, turning them silver-white as if bathed in lightning.  Then, it violently flapped its wings, unleashing a bolt of white lightning as thick as a man's arm.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>A boulder in front of the cave entrance was shattered by the lightning strike, a large crater appeared on the mountain wall, and the ground trembled.</p><p>"Acceptable,"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, sensing the power of the lightning.</p><p>He had expected the transformed butterfly to possess the strength comparable to a cultivator of the same realm, but it seemed a little short, after all, it wasn't an innate thunder-control ability.</p><p>However, it was more than enough for self-defense, at least he no longer had to worry about it dying unexpectedly.</p><p>The lightning strike alerted other cultivators on the mountain, jolting them from their meditation.  They came out to investigate.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ma Yu's caves were both on the mountaintop, not far apart, occupying the two best spots along the spiritual vein. Ma Yu was also awakened and came out of his cave, looking uncertain.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang made a surprising discovery. Through the Tianmu Butterfly, he could directly see Ma Yu.</p><p>The cloud-like barrier formed by Ma Yu's protective formation was completely useless against the butterfly. Although Ma Yu's cultivation was limited, and the formation wasn't very powerful, Qin Sang couldn't normally see through it without resorting to stealth techniques.</p><p>"So this is the Tianmu ability? It can see through illusions!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked sideways.</p><p>The Tianmu Butterfly hovered in the air, the pupils of the eyes on its wings moving, their silver-white irises lifelike.</p><p>"Daoist Mingyue, what happened?"</p><p>Ma Yu stepped out of his formation, looked around, finding nothing unusual, and approached Qin Sang's cave, asking aloud.  Qin Sang saw his every move.</p><p>"I was overzealous in my cultivation, resulting in an accident. I apologize for disturbing my fellow Daoists. My spiritual energy is currently unstable, so I cannot meet you for now..."</p><p>Qin Sang explained.</p><p>"Are you injured, Daoist? If you need help, please do not hesitate to ask."</p><p>Ma Yu expressed his concern.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't been there for even a year, yet they had gotten along well. Qin Sang was unambitious and didn't crave power, and Ma Yu's attitude towards him had become increasingly friendly.</p><p>"Fortunately, I noticed it in time and it's nothing serious. Thank you for your concern, Daoist."</p><p>Qin Sang dismissed them briefly and kept the Tianmu Butterfly observing Ma Yu's movements, because he had made another startling discovery!</p><p>Ma Yu, unsuspecting, dismissed the others and returned to his cave.</p><p>As Ma Yu opened his protective formation to enter, Qin Sang held his breath, his mind connected to the Tianmu Butterfly, his gaze fixated on the formation.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang let out a long breath, his eyes shining with excitement as he looked at the Sky-Eyed Butterfly. "Such powerful abilities!  Not only can it see through illusions, but it can also discern the weaknesses of spirit formations and restrictions!"</p><p>Qin Sang was extremely surprised. He never expected the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's abilities to be so strong.</p><p>The butterfly had easily seen through the flaws in the protective spirit formation of Ma Yu's cave and found a way to break it.</p><p>Qin Sang's own skill in the Dao of Restrictions was quite good, yet he couldn't have done it so easily.</p><p>Most terrifyingly, this wasn't due to the Sky-Eyed Butterfly's deep understanding of restrictions and spirit formations. It was purely instinct and innate talentâ€”the very nature of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly!</p><p>This ability was effective even against the mysterious and complex ancient spirit formations and restrictions.</p><p>Of course, this wasn't a top-tier spirit formation.  Currently, its cultivation is insufficient, and its abilities are limited.  Against more complex and powerful formations, its performance would undoubtedly not be so astonishing.</p><p>"Sky-Eyed Butterfly... Sky-Eyed Butterfly... This is why the Sky-Eyed Butterfly can be ranked alongside those legendary strange insects? This ability is terrifying, far more useful than the Fat Silkworm's detoxifying armor. After its next transformation, with its help, I might even be able to find ways to break the mysterious ancient restrictions and formations in the secret realms of the cultivation world."</p><p>"However, raising a Sky-Eyed Butterfly is incredibly difficult. For others, a lifetime might not be enough to see it reach its third transformation."</p><p>"Red Gold Vine was equally rare and precious in ancient times.  Nearly 80% of the Red Fire Gilded Gold in one spirit fruit went into the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, only helping it reach its third transformation. The Fat Silkworm advanced after consuming just a few drops."</p><p>"If it had to advance on its own, it would likely take an eternity."</p><p>"There's very little Red Fire Gilded Gold left. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's chances of reaching its fourth transformation are slim to none. Without a miraculous encounter, the long wait could be utterly despairing."</p><p>Qin Sang suppressed his excitement, avoiding unrealistic expectations and steadying his mind.</p><p>His initial purpose in raising a spirit insect as a familiar was to cultivate one to its peak third transformation, providing assistance during his Nascent Soul stage.  Successfully helping the Sky-Eyed Butterfly reach its third transformation had essentially completed the majority of that task; everything else was a bonus.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang cherished it, his mind and the insect deeply connected, continuing to experience its abilities. The transformed Sky-Eyed Butterfly possessed higher intelligence, able to communicate simply with Qin Sang, acting like a nimble extension of himself.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang briefly appeared, then left South Crossing Island directly.</p><p>The Sky-Eyed Butterfly's abilities gave him another idea: if he could break the protective spirit formation of Liangqiu Island, he could directly land on it.</p>
