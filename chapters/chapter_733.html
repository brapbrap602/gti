<h1>Chapter 725: Unexpected News</h1><p>“I know very well what kind of place the Seven Killing Palace is, but I have no choice but to go…” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>Seeing this, Ran Luo stopped persuading him, but instead told Qin Sang some unexpected news.</p><p>“Rumors about the Seven Killing Palace did begin to spread in the Inner Sea a year or two ago, but only a limited number of people know about it. I also heard about it when Old Zou was chatting with a friend. It’s said that this time it's different. The next opening of the Seven Killing Palace might be in just over twenty years.”</p><p>Qin Sang was incredibly surprised. “Just over twenty years? Wouldn't that mean only fifty years have passed since the last time, a full twenty years less than before! Forcing it open before the Immortal Formation reaches its weakest point, the price to pay is definitely not just double or triple, no single force can bear it! Did Old Zou say why?”</p><p>Qin Sang was anxious. Originally, there was plenty of time. It was more than enough for him to break through to the mid-Core Formation stage. And he had enough time to cultivate both spirit insects to their third transformation, allowing them to play a greater role.</p><p>With the time suddenly shortened by twenty years, his own cultivation had become urgent, and it would be difficult for the two spirit insects to complete their third transformation before the Seven Killing Palace opened.</p><p>“No, Old Zou doesn't know.”</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head. “Perhaps there has been a change in the Seven Killing Palace's Immortal Formation, but I guess it’s probably not that simple, because there’s another variable. I heard from Old Zou that it seems more difficult to obtain qualifications to enter the Seven Killing Palace this time than before.  Only those well-established forces will get a turn.  Previously, rogue cultivators could obtain qualifications through other channels, such as auctions; if they actively searched for them, it wasn't too difficult. Now I’m afraid it will be very hard.”</p><p>The opening is earlier, and the slots are limited.</p><p>The sudden changes caught Qin Sang somewhat off guard.</p><p>He didn't want to get too deeply involved with the forces of the Boundless Sea, and even maintained a certain distance from the Qiongyu Trading Company.  Unexpectedly, this had become the wrong choice.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang said solemnly, “Fellow Daoist Ran, does our trading company have the ability to obtain qualifications?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. I’ve never considered going to such a dangerous and ominous place before; I just heard about it as an interesting story.”</p><p>Ran Luo shook her head. Seeing Qin Sang fall silent, she thought for a moment and said, “Even if our trading company can't, the East Pole Alliance definitely can. Our trading alliance’s strength is comparable to those top sects of both the righteous and demonic paths.  Fellow Daoist is also considered a member of our trading company.  Through the East Pole Alliance, you might be able to obtain a qualification. If Fellow Daoist is interested, I will inquire with Old Zou on your behalf. He has countless old acquaintances and definitely has a way.”</p><p>“Then I’ll have to trouble Fellow Daoist Ran.”</p><p>Qin Sang said gratefully.</p><p>With only twenty years left, he had to cultivate diligently to ensure he broke through to mid-Core Formation before the Seven Killing Palace opened.</p><p>If he returned to the Inner Sea and searched aimlessly, not only might he not obtain qualifications, but he didn't know how much time he would waste.</p><p>Relying on the Qiongyu Trading Company and the East Pole Alliance was indeed the best choice. It was likely that the qualifications wouldn't be easy to obtain, and the trading alliance and trading company might take this opportunity to raise some conditions. As long as they weren't too excessive, Qin Sang decided to agree to them.</p><p>“Why be so polite, Fellow Daoist?  I still rely on Fellow Daoist.  The newly hired Artifact Refiners are simply no match for Fellow Daoist’s abilities.” Ran Luo smiled, covering her mouth.</p><p>“It’s my responsibility.”</p><p>Qin Sang cupped his hands.</p><p>The two exchanged a few more pleasantries, then Qin Sang urged Ran Luo to send the spirit materials to the fire chamber so he could begin artifact refining. Ran Luo reciprocated by sending someone to contact Old Zou, who was on another island.</p><p>After refining the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings, Qin Sang had made significant progress in artifact refining. He felt that his success rate in refining magic tools wouldn't be lower than that of other Artifact Refiners.</p><p>Provided he used the Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>The enormous consumption, the lengthy time, and the demonic fire energy residue from the Nine Nether Demonic Fire were the reasons why Qin Sang hadn’t proactively mentioned this matter to Ran Luo.</p><p>When refining magic weapons, the residue of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire was minimal and could be disguised with special artifact refining techniques.</p><p>If all magic tools were like the Mixed Yuan Concentric Rings, it would be difficult to explain.  Experienced Artifact Refining Grandmasters could tell at a glance that the person who refined the magic tool must possess a unique spiritual fire.</p><p>It would invite unnecessary trouble.</p><p>Until he could solve this problem, Qin Sang felt it was best to keep a low profile.</p><p>Batches of spirit materials were delivered one after another, and Qin Sang stayed in the fire chamber for over a month without coming out.</p><p>One day, after Qin Sang finished refining the last magic weapon and was meditating, he heard a guard knock on the door. Learning that Ran Luo had come to visit, his heart stirred, and he hurriedly opened the door.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Ran, is there any news?”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you’ve worked hard.”</p><p>Ran Luo nodded, looked around, and said, “Old Zou has learned about the matter and sent a letter. Please follow me, Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>The two returned to the residence’s quiet room, where Ran Luo handed Qin Sang a letter.</p><p>The contents of the letter were simple. Qin Sang scanned it, his grip on the letter tightening, his expression changing, and he fell silent.</p><p>After a while, Ran Luo softly said, “The news Old Zou found out should be true. He said he didn’t expect the Trading Alliance to have such harsh requirements. Not only do they demand every single spirit stone, but everyone must also act together.”</p><p>Qin Sang subconsciously nodded.</p><p>The spirit stones were expected. Although the quantity was astonishing, if he sold the demon cores he had, he could almost gather enough.</p><p>The second requirement was the reason for Qin Sang’s hesitation.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance actually required all members of the Trading Alliance to obey the Alliance's commands after entering the Seven Killing Palace, forbidding any independent action.  Only after completing the mission could they attend to their own affairs.</p><p>As for the specific mission, the Trading Alliance hadn’t explicitly stated it, only saying that it wouldn’t take too much time, shamelessly labeling it ‘confidential’.</p><p>The East Pole Alliance’s confidence showed how difficult it was to obtain qualifications to enter the Seven Killing Palace.</p><p>In comparison, the Qiongyu Trading Company's requirements were much simpler, or rather, Old Zou’s requirements. Old Zou hoped that Qin Sang would formally join the Qiongyu Trading Company and, like Ran Luo, take charge of affairs on a large island.</p><p>“I’ve only recently formed my Core. I’m afraid it would be difficult for me to be competent,” Qin Sang probed.</p><p>Ran Luo smiled slightly. “Why be so modest, Fellow Daoist? Even the direct disciple of Black Serpent Mountain was easily slain by Fellow Daoist. Your strength is unfathomable.  I'm no match for you.”</p><p>“Black Serpent Mountain is…”</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't heard of this name, but a flash of inspiration struck him. He suddenly realized something.</p><p>Ran Luo nodded and said solemnly, “The person who ambushed you back then should have been a direct disciple of the Black Serpent Mountain’s Patriarch. This person was killed by Fellow Daoist. The people of Black Serpent Mountain lost track of you and were unwilling to give up. After the chaos between the two races ended, they sent people to infiltrate Douyan Island and secretly investigate Fellow Daoist’s identity. Fortunately, I discovered it in time. Old Zou, in the name of the Island Lord, secretly drove them off the island and set up several traps to confuse them. Fellow Daoist, don't worry. Only Old Zou and I know about this. They definitely won't be able to trace it back to you.”</p>
