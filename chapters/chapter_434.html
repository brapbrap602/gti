<h1>Chapter 427: Blood-winged Devil Bees</h1><p>Chapter 427: Blood-winged Devil Bees</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished.</p><p>He and Jie Ying had received completely different orders.</p><p>The Seven-Leaf Moonflower that Jie Ying mentioned was a crucial auxiliary herb for the Kanli Golden Pill. Qin Sang only learned about this from Qi Yuanshou; Jie Ying and the others were likely unaware of its significance.</p><p>Considering the importance of the Kanli Golden Pill, the order wasn't surprising.</p><p>It seemed he held considerable weight in Qi Yuanshou's mind; this patron was firmly secured.</p><p>Qin Sang was grateful for seizing the opportunity to gain Qi Yuanshou's favor.  Without it, he couldn't have lived so peacefully outside for all these years. He might have been sent off as cannon fodder like Jie Ying.</p><p>Of course, his relationship with Qi Yuanshou was fragile.  He wasn't indispensable, just convenient and easily manipulated.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, unable to figure out what he could do for Qi Yuanshou.  The only things of value he possessed were a few magic treasures, but he couldn't possibly give those to Qi Yuanshou.</p><p>Seeing Jie Ying still lamenting, Qin Sang's expression hardened. He said sternly, "The sect isn't heartless. As the situation changes, so do the strategies. When you received your orders, the situation wasn't so critical. What's so strange about that?  Master Qi is kind and compassionate, prioritizing his disciples. How could he disregard his disciples' lives for a mere spiritual herb? Don't utter such useless words again; avoid trouble by keeping quiet!"</p><p>Jie Ying's expression tightened, his complaints fading.  He bowed, "Thank you, senior brother, for your guidance.  This junior disciple has learned a lesson."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly, surveying the surroundings and the deep lake.  "Junior Brother Jie, Master Qi's secret order doesn't need to be shared with other disciples. Starting now, arrange personnel for continuous day and night vigilance. If anything goes wrong, we can adapt as needed."</p><p>With Qi Yuanshou's secret order, Jie Ying felt relieved and at ease.  Without prompting from Qin Sang, he diligently carried out his orders.</p><p>Qin Sang enjoyed his newfound leisure, occupying Jie Ying's cave dwelling. The cave's spiritual energy was sufficient for cultivation.</p><p>After breaking through to the late Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang frequently travelled between Tianyou Pass and Qingyang City to investigate the remnants of the Kuiyin Sect, gaining experience and improving his understanding of killing talismans, though his cultivation time was insufficient.  </p><p>Being assigned to guard the medicinal garden provided a chance for quiet cultivation.</p><p>However, Qin Sang wasn't entirely at ease. Initially, his cultivation was intermittent, frequently pausing to secretly observe Jie Ying and the others. Only after confirming everyone was behaving and there was no unusual activity did he settle down to cultivate.</p><p>Seasons changed.</p><p>Two years passed in a blink.</p><p>Since arriving at the medicinal garden, Qin Sang had rarely left his cave dwelling.</p><p>One time, a fierce battle erupted nearby between cultivators of the Tianxing League and those from Xiaohan Region.</p><p>Jie Ying was greatly worried and hastily awakened Qin Sang from meditation.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Tianxing League cultivators, but this was his first time witnessing their combat firsthand.</p><p>Both sides were strong, each with several Foundation Establishment cultivators, including several late-stage experts. Whether it was a pursuit or a chance encounter, the life-or-death struggle happened right near the medicinal garden.</p><p>Hidden behind the garden's protective formations, Qin Sang intently observed the entire battle.  After all, these people could be his greatest future enemies.  Knowing one's enemy is essential for victory.</p><p>Through this observation, Qin Sang found that Tianxing League cultivators were much like their counterparts, employing similar methods: spells, magic weapons, talismans, and forbidden artifacts.</p><p>The only difference was their cultivation techniques, leading to varied strengths.</p><p>They were all cultivators, yet engaged in life-or-death combat without any deep-seated hatred.</p><p>What particularly caught Qin Sang's eye was a Yuling Sect disciple from the Xiaohan Region who controlled a magnificent striped tiger.</p><p>This cultivator was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, but his tiger was equally strong, possessing the formidable power of a mid-Spirit Beast stage.</p><p>The tiger's fangs were like swords, claws like knives, moving with lightning speed and grace.</p><p>The combined strength of man and beast greatly surprised Qin Sang. This cultivator, facing a late Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Tianxing League, held his own.</p><p>Cultivating such a powerful spirit beast required significant time and effort.</p><p>Seeing the tiger's power, Qin Sang was envious, reminding him of the blood-winged devil beehive he obtained in the Wuya Valley, filling him with frustration.</p><p>After leaving Wuya Valley, Qin Sang, in his spare time, followed the instructions in a Yu Ling Sect Golden Core cultivation manual. He bought herbs, brewed elixirs, and tried to cultivate Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees, using the same method as before.</p><p>He didn't spend much effort; it was a casual endeavor.</p><p>Fifteen years later, the Bloodwing Ghost Head Bee larvae in the hive finally emerged, looking exactly like the Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees he had seen before.</p><p>But when Qin Sang tried to subdue these demonic bees, the same thing happened again.  Even as larvae, they had fiery tempers and self-destructed without hesitation.</p><p>Uncompromising!</p><p>Qin Sang was dumbfounded and cursed inwardly.</p><p>After repeated unsuccessful attempts, Qin Sang realized these Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees had extremely erratic intelligence and were impossible to subdue.</p><p>He completely gave up on taming them.</p><p>Bloodwing Ghost Head Bees did have one advantage: their combat power was a level higher than regular Ghost Head Bees.</p><p>Although he hadn't invested much effort, he had cultivated them for so long that Qin Sang couldn't bear to discard them. He kept them in his spirit beast pouch to raise slowly.</p><p>Since he couldn't find a way to subdue them, there was no point in continuing to cultivate them. Otherwise, instead of using them against enemies, he risked them backfiring and harming himself.</p><p>Because of this, Qin Sang didn't waste any Red Fire Gilded Gold on them.</p><p>He didn't have much Red Fire Gilded Gold left and planned to use it to carefully cultivate suitable unique insects later.</p><p>That battle lasted for a whole hour. Although the location was closer to Xiaohan Territory, the Tianxing Alliance had a slight advantage. While those from Xiaohan Territory weren't immediately in mortal danger, they were forced to defend and couldn't even spare anyone to send a message back.</p><p>As the battle raged on and slowly moved closer and closer to the medicinal garden, Qin Sang grew concerned.</p><p>If the battle reached the medicinal garden, they would likely be caught in the crossfire, exposing the garden's location.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't stand idly by. After consulting with Jie Ying, he had them secretly prepare the medicinal garden's protective formations while he secretly left the garden, appearing as a passerby, and flew towards the battle from afar.</p><p>The swiftly approaching sword light immediately attracted the attention of both warring sides.</p><p>Qin Sang's Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivation was clearly revealed.</p><p>Both sides were exhausted from the prolonged battle. The arrival of any expert would disrupt the balance, and given Qin Sang's direction of approach, it was highly likely he was a cultivator from Xiaohan Territory.</p><p>The Tianxing Alliance cultivators immediately stopped fighting and fled.</p>
