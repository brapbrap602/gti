<h1>Chapter 1592: The Soul-Binding Secret Technique</h1><p>Chapter 1592: The Soul-Binding Secret Technique</p><p>Leaving Gong Xingqing behind, Qin Sang quickly exited the chamber.</p><p>The token in her hand guided her.</p><p>Shortly after, the token led Qin Sang to a room where a servant was waiting. Opening the door, he respectfully said, "Please enter, senior."</p><p>Beyond the door was not a room, but a winding stone staircase leading down into a narrow passage into the unknown.</p><p>The servant led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the fluctuation of a restriction within the passage, but it wasn't a restriction to impede passage, only to block spiritual sense detection.</p><p>The servant's cultivation was not weak, proficient in rapid movement techniques; Qin Sang effortlessly kept pace.</p><p>The passage seemed endless.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated the distance; they were already far from Tianzhong County, surprising her somewhat.</p><p>After some time of rapid travel.</p><p>Ahead, the light suddenly dimmed, revealing a stone wall.</p><p>The servant stopped, turning to say, "With respect, senior, I can only escort you this far.  Once you exit, you can use the token to sense the location of the Yi Bao gathering. This is a disguise treasure prepared for you by the Hall; combined with the formation at the Yi Bao gathering, it will block spiritual sense and prevent others from spying on you."</p><p>With that, the servant handed Qin Sang a jade pendant-shaped talisman, bowed respectfully, turned, and walked back down the passage, disappearing along with the passage itself before Qin Sang's eyes. Whether by mechanism or restriction, this fully demonstrated the Liu Zhou Hall's deep roots and complete control over Tianzhong County.</p><p>Her previous guess was most likely correct; the Liu Zhou Hall headquarters was probably in this city.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, activating the jade pendant. Her figure blurred, transforming into a gaunt young Daoist, then she put on a prepared mask artifact.</p><p>After confirming there was nothing unusual outside, she pushed open the door.</p><p>Outside the stone door was a cliff.</p><p>As expected, she had been taken to the wilderness.</p><p>Tall yellow grass grew all around.</p><p>Birds and animals sang their calls.</p><p>A faint light glimmered in the distance.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang was about to leave, she heard a 'click-click' sound from behind. Turning, she saw a graceful female Daoist emerge from the opposite cliff.</p><p>This person was certainly also disguised; her appearance was meaningless.  She appeared to be a Daoist nun, but her true identity, male or female, was unknown.</p><p>After exiting the passage, Qin Sang sensed the fluctuation of a spirit array, indicating she had entered the formation. When she tried to use her spiritual sense, she felt an unprecedented level of difficulty, her spiritual perception inexplicably restricted.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly wasn't affected, but Qin Sang couldn't be sure whether the Liu Zhou Hall had secretly arranged countermeasures for such abilities.</p><p>The participants in the Yi Bao gathering were all highly cultivated.</p><p>Even a slight fluctuation from the Tianmu ability wouldn't escape their spiritual awareness, so it was best not to risk it and become a target.</p><p>Their eyes met; both were startled for a moment, then casually averted their gazes, deliberately keeping a distance, and flew towards the light.</p><p>Upon reaching it.</p><p>A dark pool lay ahead.</p><p>The vegetation around the pool had been cleared, with tables and cushions placed around it, where several people sat, some having arrived earlier.</p><p>Several carp swam in the pool, their tails swishing as they spat out pearls, the source of the light.</p><p>The pearl light was not bright.</p><p>But for Qin Sang and the others, the presence or absence of light made no difference.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Daoist nun approached, their arrival noticed by those already seated. Some glanced at them, others continued to meditate, but no one acted rudely or stared.</p><p>The Daoist nun sat down by herself.</p><p>Choosing a cushion at the edge, she sat cross-legged. Qin Sang looked around and didn't see anyone from the Liu Zhou Hall.</p><p>After they sat down, the number of arrivals increased sharply; breaking sounds filled the air. Within a few dozen breaths, cultivators at the Yuan Ying stage arrived one after another, filling most of the available seats.</p><p>Despite the crowd, everyone remained quiet.</p><p>Some arrived in groups, communicating only secretly.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A sudden splash came from the pool's center, a cloud of mist rising, attracting everyone's attention.</p><p>Smoke rose from the ground, and a figure appeared.</p><p>A white-haired old man stood on the water, his gaze sweeping over the assembly, smiling as he clasped his fists in a bow, "Old Jiang You greets all fellow Daoists. Among those present are surely close friends of mine, although I cannot recognize your identities at present. The event was hastily arranged, the place humble, and I apologize for any shortcomings."</p><p>Before he finished, someone from the crowd joked, "Deputy Hall Master Jiang's illustrious name is known to everyone; do you really need an introduction?"</p><p>"Is that really Daoist Jiang? Or is this a disguise? I've heard of Daoist Jiang's mastery of the Seven Paths Soul-Losing Spear, capable of capturing souls.  Why not demonstrate it and verify your identity?" Another voice taunted.</p><p>Jiang You remained unperturbed, his smile unchanged, "All of you possess extraordinary abilities. Whether or not I am disguised is unlikely to escape your sharp eyes. Among you, surely some possess spear techniques far surpassing mine; I won't make a fool of myself…"</p><p>Qin Sang straightened her posture.</p><p>The Liu Zhou Hall had two deputy hall masters, and above them, a mysterious hall master.</p><p>Two of the Six States Hall's deputy masters, Jiang Mu highly regarded Jiang You, and Qin Sang had already heard of him.</p><p>Another person arrived.</p><p>Jiang You glanced at the sky and said gravely, "The hour has come. The exchange meeting begins now.  Those who haven't arrived, Jiang can only express regret."</p><p>He made a hand seal, striking towards the void. The array's power suddenly converged, covering only the area near the dark pool, even obscuring the light, creating a secluded space.</p><p>The crowd stirred slightly, quite surprised.  </p><p>As long as they met the qualifications, more people were always better.</p><p>The Six States Hall's cautious approach was excessive. Was it the employer's request?</p><p>"Jiang, since you're just the organizer, why do you need to show your face? Where's the employer? We've been manipulated for so long, how much longer will they hide?"</p><p>The voice was low and hoarse, filled with discontent.  He and another person arrived together, seated on the left. The person on the right remained motionless with eyes closed, seemingly of higher status.</p><p>"The employer is among you. I'm acting on their behalf. The employer is generous, and this exchange meeting will not charge any commission.  At the appropriate time, the employer will reveal themselves. Please be patient. Our hall is open for business and will strive to meet all our esteemed guests' requirements.  The same applies if you need anything in the future."</p><p>Jiang You explained, not forgetting to drum up business for the Six States Hall.</p><p>Hearing this, everyone looked around, suspecting anyone could be the employer.</p><p>This was truly the strangest exchange meeting they had ever attended.</p><p>The employer hiding their identity, either had a sensitive status with many enemies, or the items being traded were extremely significant.</p><p>This, however, made everyone more expectant.</p><p>"The rules of the exchange meeting are known to all, so Jiang won't repeat them. There's only one thing: during the exchange, once the employer makes a move, under the same conditions, the employer has priority.  Let's avoid any conflict," Jiang You stressed.</p><p>This was standard, and no one objected.</p><p>Jiang You nodded, raised his hand, and water from the pool surged, forming a platform.  With a flick of his sleeve, three items appeared. "Let me start. These are three treasures."</p><p>He first pointed to the twin rings on the left. "These are special magic treasures, the Moon Reflection Rings. Extremely sharp, specialized in breaking protective shields. As for other abilities, it's hard to describe.  I'll momentarily release a small part of their restriction; you can use your spiritual sense to investigate."</p><p>In the middle was a pearl.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it. Wasn't this the Corpse Soul Pearl that Bai obtained after hunting a corpse king?</p><p>The Corpse Soul Pearl was bluish-black, with condensed corpse energy inside, occasionally forming a terrifying face.  However, this pearl was much weaker than Bai's.</p><p>"This is from a Nascent Soul stage corpse king. Unfortunately, the Corpse Soul Pearl was buried for many years before we discovered it, and its power is diminished. However, for those who cultivate Corpse Ghost Dao, it's still a rare treasure."</p><p>The third item was a green crystal. The green light formed a swirling spectacle, with a sense of lightness, beneficial for cultivating wind-based techniques.</p><p>"Three treasures in exchange for treasures related to the Five Elements Dao, or other easily traded items.  You can also use spirit stones. The starting price is 10,000, and each bid increase must be no less than 10,000," Jiang You announced.</p><p>It was indeed a way to start the bidding.</p><p>The three treasures themselves were valuable, but their uses were limited, and the most precious Corpse Soul Pearl, due to its weakened power, couldn't fetch a high price.</p><p>As for spirit stones, that was just talk. Spirit stones were practically non-existent in such exchanges.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the Moon Reflection Rings. His Wish-Fulfilling Pearl was a shield-type defensive treasure. He never expected the first treasure to be its counter.</p><p>Such treasures were common in the cultivation world; Qin Sang couldn't acquire them all. With his spirit treasures and the Sun God Tree, as long as he could hit, another Moon Reflection Ring wouldn't be much help.</p><p>Comparatively, he was more interested in the Corpse Soul Pearl.</p><p>Bai had refined the Corpse Soul Pearl to advance his cultivation.</p><p>But Ya Gu's intelligence hadn't been fully restored, and Qin Sang couldn't communicate directly with her.  Otherwise, buying the Corpse Soul Pearl and helping Ya Gu refine it would bring great benefits.</p><p>After some consideration, Qin Sang decided not to bid.</p><p>Ya Gu's lifespan was abnormal, but before she fell asleep, she was merely at the Qi Condensation stage. Forcibly refining a Nascent Soul stage Corpse Soul Pearl, no one knew what consequences that might bring.</p><p>Seeking the Ghost Mother and hoping for the Fat Silkworm's advancement was more reliable.</p><p>Finally, all three treasures were exchanged for other magical treasures.</p><p>Jiang You smiled, flashing to the edge of the pool. "Please begin."</p><p>Before his words faded, a figure rushed from the front row, taking the lead. "Haha… this old man is a little impatient, forgive me! Here, this is a Earth Yuan Pearl that I painstakingly refined using profound arts in a place where earth energy gathered for many years. For those cultivating earth-based techniques, refining this pearl helps break through realms; the lower your realm, the better the effect… I'll trade it for a transformed earth spirit."</p><p>Silence fell.</p><p>Many coveted the treasure, but none could meet the old man's demands.  Alternative offers were rejected.</p><p>Disappointed, the old man prepared to leave.</p><p>At that moment, a heavily armored man seated not far from Qin Sang spoke, "I don't have a living Earth Spirit, but I saw a group a century ago. Their leader should still be there.  This place is remote; Earth Spirits rarely move their nests. It must still be there. After the exchange ends, I'll personally take you there to help you capture it...how does that sound?"</p><p>The old man was overjoyed, "Agreed!"</p><p>The two exchanged whispers, their private conversation unknown.</p><p>The old man, satisfied, flew back to his seat, immediately replaced in the queue.</p><p>Some, like the old man, left with treasures; others left empty-handed.</p><p>As the exchange progressed, Qin Sang truly felt the vastness of the Central Plains.</p><p>Most items were various rare spiritual materials.</p><p>Exceptional treasures were displayed one after another, many rare or even extinct in the North Sea, surpassing the previous Demon Convocation by several levels.  </p><p>Had Qin Sang not had a specific goal, he would have made several bids.</p><p>Some items were entirely unfamiliar, their value impossible to judge.</p><p>Magic weapons were rare at the exchange.</p><p>Most cultivators present were not lacking in top-tier magic weapons.</p><p>Surprisingly, someone produced a pseudo-spiritual treasure—and it wasn't their lifebound treasure; it could be refined by anyone!</p><p>Qin Sang had much to improve.  Refinement was low on his list of priorities; after arriving in the Central Plains, he hadn't researched their refinement techniques.</p><p>Indeed, the Central Plains possessed even more advanced refinement techniques!</p><p>This was quickly confirmed.</p><p>"The refining secret technique, 'Imprisoning Spirit Technique,' can refine pseudo-spiritual treasures, and it doesn't require a lifebound treasure," a Daoist in green robes gracefully entered the pool, producing a jade slip.</p><p>Before he could state his terms, surprised voices rose from below, "Imprisoning Spirit Technique? Is that one of the three major heritages of the ancient Xuanqi Mountain sect in the South Sea?"</p><p>"Correct!" The Daoist smiled and nodded.</p><p>"Learning the 'Imprisoning Spirit Technique' allows one to refine spiritual treasures! A thousand years ago, the Qiongying Sect discovered the Xuanqi Mountain ruins on the South Sea coast, obtaining half the treasures. It's said that a fragment of the 'Imprisoning Spirit Technique' fell into their hands.  Do you possess the complete technique, friend?" the person continued.</p><p>"Not so," the Daoist shook his head, "I also have only a fragment. Whether it's the same as the Qiongying Sect's, I cannot say. I can add my own insights, but it won't refine spiritual treasures, only pseudo-spiritual treasures."</p><p>The person chuckled, "A pseudo-spiritual treasure is enough. Spiritual treasures are beyond our reach for now.  Don't you want to reach the Divine Transformation stage?"</p><p>Refining a spiritual treasure isn't a matter of days, or even the work of a single person.</p><p>Their back-and-forth made a prior agreement hard to deny.</p><p>After a moment of silence,</p><p>A female cultivator's voice rang out,</p><p>"Friend Daoist, what do you want for the 'Imprisoning Spirit Technique'?"</p><p>The green-robed Daoist's eyes lit up. He rattled off over a dozen extremely rare celestial materials, leaving everyone speechless, before saying, "You need only provide three."</p><p>The female cultivator paused, "Three celestial materials for a fragment? That's too steep! Why not trade directly with the Qiongying Sect?"</p><p>The green-robed Daoist remained silent.</p><p>The female cultivator didn't press, "I want to see part of the technique first."</p><p>"Certainly!"</p><p>The green-robed Daoist looked at Jiang You.</p><p>Jiang You cast a hand seal, nodding slightly.</p><p>A wisp of divine sense discreetly entered the jade slip.</p><p>Qin Sang eyed the jade slip, quite tempted.</p><p>But not now.</p><p>He would study it later, then visit a refining sect for advanced instruction.</p><p>"I'll take it."</p><p>The female cultivator produced three jade boxes, tossing them into the pool.  The green-robed Daoist examined them, a pleased expression on his face, then sent the jade slip to the cultivator before returning to his seat.</p><p>The exchange continued.</p><p>The host remained unseen, and Qin Sang still hadn't found the treasure he sought to strengthen his divine sense.</p><p>Secretly, Qin Sang took out the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal and stood.</p>
