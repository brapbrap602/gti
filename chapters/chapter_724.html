<h1>Chapter 716: Corpse Pill</h1><p>Chapter 716: Corpse Pill</p><p>The Hun Yuan concentric ring tightened, causing Qing Jiao excruciating pain.</p><p>But after Qin Sang's promise, Qing Jiao seemed to forget the agony, staring intently at him, its fierce eyes filled with disbelief and hope.</p><p>Immediately, Qing Jiao swung its massive tail and pursued the direction Qin Sang indicated.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, then activated the talisman and sword energy thunder sound, his遁光 flashing several times before vanishing ahead. After flying several miles, Qin Sang saw the fleeing figure of the two-headed creature from afar.</p><p>Its front leg was injured, but with the help of its wind wings, it could still speed across the water.</p><p>This two-headed creature could create up to six illusory images, each indistinguishable from the real one and inheriting a small portion of its power. Without direct confrontation, it was impossible to discern the real from the fake with the naked eye.</p><p>If it wanted to escape, it would be nearly impossible for its enemy to stop it.</p><p>Qin Sang was grateful he'd severely wounded the two-headed creature first; otherwise, he would have lost it.</p><p>Hearing the approaching sound, the two-headed creature turned its heads left and right, staring fixedly at Qin Sang. Its vertical pupils suddenly glowed brightly, emitting two beams of green light that transformed into two ethereal wind blades.</p><p>They attacked Qin Sang from both sides.</p><p>"That's the real one!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes narrowed.</p><p>Faced with these wind blades, he felt a stinging sensation on his skin, indicating their extreme power. The illusions couldn't possess such potent attacks; this was the real two-headed creature.</p><p>To Qin Sang's delight, he discovered that after the creature unleashed the wind blades, its aura weakened further, proving his strategy effective.</p><p>During this night's chase, Qin Sang had opportunities to intercept the two-headed creature. If he spared no expense and used the talisman and sword energy thunder sound, he could have easily subdued it.</p><p>But he didn't. He kept a safe distance, letting it believe it had a chance of escape while preventing it from resting.</p><p>Under Qin Sang's persistent harassment, the already heavily injured two-headed creature was forced to repeatedly overexert itself, using its abilities to overcome the danger. It was finally nearing its limit.</p><p>The wind blades struck, but Qin Sang remained calm.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The sword energy surrounding Qin Sang flashed past.</p><p>Thunder rumbled.</p><p>The next moment, the ebony sword appeared before the wind blades.  Its shadow flashed, splitting into two sword lights, intercepting the two wind blades from both sides.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang let out a long whistle, commanding Qing Jiao and the Flying Night Yaksha to hurry.</p><p>The time was right; it was time to close the net!</p><p>However, the two-headed creature possessed mid-stage cultivation, and its desperate counterattack would undoubtedly be extremely fierce. Qin Sang felt somewhat uneasy.</p><p>Besides, his goal wasn't to kill the two-headed creature, but to capture it alive.</p><p>At that time, the Flying Night Yaksha had just clashed with an illusion of the two-headed creature. Hearing Qin Sang's whistle, it cleaved the illusion with a palm strike and retreated. Qing Jiao, having just spotted the two-headed creature, hesitated upon hearing the whistle, then also turned back.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The wind blades and the spirit sword collided, countless green fragments scattering as the wind blades dissipated.</p><p>The ebony sword trembled, emitting a sword song as it escaped the wind blades. Its light flashed, returning to Qin Sang.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang seemed to have the upper hand.</p><p>To his surprise, after unleashing the wind blades, the two-headed creature turned, its two vertical pupils flashing with malice. Its head lowered slightly, revealing its fangs as it let out low growls.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart tightened, realizing the two-headed creature was fighting for its life.</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, two illusions separated from the creature's body and suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang muttered inwardly, "Not good!" and immediately retreated.</p><p>The next moment, three two-headed creatures appeared where he had stood. Had he not reacted in time, he would have been gravely injured.</p><p>The two-headed creature relentlessly pursued him.</p><p>Its wind wings fluttered and shattered, transforming into a torrential downpour of wind blades, as both the real body and the illusions pounced again.</p><p>Fortunately, Qing Jiao and the Flying Night Yaksha had arrived.</p><p>Qin Sang skillfully evaded the wind blades, then targeted the two-headed monster, ordering the Azure Shark and the Flying Night Rakshasa to shred its illusions.  The three then launched a coordinated assault.</p><p>The two-headed monster's final desperate attack failed. Weakened and its wind wings lost, it was overwhelmed by the combined assault, struggling desperately as the situation grew critical.</p><p>Despite its weakened state, the creature unleashed several more attacks, fueled by its life force, but Qin Sang easily neutralized them all.</p><p>Finally, despairing, the two-headed monster let out a mournful cry. One of its heads opened its gaping maw, releasing a bolt of azure light.</p><p>Within the light, a pill was clearly visible.</p><p>A demon core!</p><p>The azure light pulsed with a poignant beauty, the demon core shimmering, radiating an exceptionally powerful aura.</p><p>The two-headed monster had self-destructed its core!</p><p>Qin Sang showed no alarm. With a sweep of his hand, three streaks of dark light shot out, transforming instantly into three enormous ghost banners that fluttered wildly in the wind.</p><p>For fifteen years, Qin Sang's life had been monotonous: hunting demons and cultivating.  He deliberately avoided the conflicts between the two races, venturing deeper and deeper into the Demon Sea, leveraging the precognitive abilities of his Xuan Yuan Heart Ring.  In fifteen years, he hadn't encountered a single cultivator.</p><p>This solitude didn't bother him; it was a necessary sacrifice for his cultivation.  During this time, he constantly pondered his path.</p><p>Before the next opening of the Seven Kills Hall, he should easily reach the mid-stage of the Golden Core realm.  However, further advancement would be impossible within that timeframe.  Continued cultivation beyond the mid-stage would yield diminishing returns.</p><p>How could he rapidly enhance his strength to prepare for the Seven Kills Hall?  Two paths presented themselves:  body refinement and cultivating the spiritual sense.</p><p>Qin Sang had acquired similar cultivation methods among his spoils of war, but they were mediocre at best; their effectiveness was debatable.  Even the techniques from the treasure vaults of Mount Shao Hua were largely ineffective for Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>Had it not been for Dongyang Bo's scheme, Qin Sang would have returned to his sect, successfully formed his Golden Core, and gained access to Shao Hua's most precious techniques, avoiding this lack.</p><p>Cultivation methods for spiritual sense and body refinement were rare, and top-tier techniques were extremely scarce.  His reluctance to join other sects and be bound limited his opportunities even further.</p><p>After much deliberation, Qin Sang turned his attention elsewhere.</p><p>To the corpse pill.</p><p>After achieving the Golden Core, he had kept the corpse pill as a last resort, a means to unleash greater endurance than other cultivators of similar strength when his true energy was depleted.</p><p>He felt using the precious corpse pill would be wasteful. It deserved a more significant role, to justify the hardships he endured obtaining it.</p>
