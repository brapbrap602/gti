<h1>## Chapter 1425: The Red Phoenix Curse</h1><p>At this moment, the bell rang.</p><p>Realizing the bell's effect, they subconsciously looked around, but were still unable to find the source of the bell, and had no choice but to give up and focus on the Golden Summit.</p><p>"Perhaps it was someone who once had a debt of gratitude to the Pure Sea Sect."</p><p>Jade Robe Immortal Monarch dismissed this thought and stopped delving into the origins of the statue.</p><p>Her gaze shifted downwards.</p><p>She saw an offering table in front of the Buddha statue, while the area in front of the stone statue was completely empty.</p><p>It seemed faith was still more important.</p><p>The items on the offering table attracted her attention.</p><p>Besides the usual pure water, lamp candles, incense sticks, etc., there were also three objects that were obviously not ordinary.</p><p>In the center was a Buddha shrine.</p><p>The Buddha shrine was only a foot tall, with lotus patterns in relief on its surface, the patterns intricate, lively and beautiful, and inside stood a Bodhisattva statue. The whole presented a dark red color, and the material could not be distinguished with the naked eye.</p><p>To the left of the Buddha shrine was a neatly placed spirit fungus *ruyi* (scepter), with a Bodhisattva seated in meditation on the spirit fungus.</p><p>On the right was a completely round precious pearl.</p><p>The precious pearl was the size of an infant's fist, with no patterns on the surface, as pure as water.</p><p>Below the offering table were several skeletal remains, all in a seated meditative posture. There were no visible external injuries on their bodies; they seemed to have died silently and without warning, which was very strange.</p><p>Several magical artifacts were also placed next to the skeletal remains.</p><p>A pair of arm-length golden forks, placed crossed on top of each other, sharp and deadly.</p><p>A circular, slightly convex mirror-like magical artifact, resembling a heart-protecting mirror.</p><p>A treasured pestle, powerful and heavy.</p><p>A flower basket, the flowers inside still delicate and beautiful, even gently swaying, all legendary flowers of Buddhism.</p><p>There was also a small jade sword in the hand of a skeleton, faintly visible through the gaps in the fingers.</p><p>These were all the magical artifacts that could be seen outside the Golden Summit Main Hall.</p><p>Jade Robe Immortal Monarch's gaze swept over these magical artifacts one by one.</p><p>First, she eliminated the golden forks, jade sword, treasured pestle, and heart-protecting mirror.</p><p>Because these were most likely treasures for attack or defense.</p><p>With her cultivation level, she did not lack similar magical artifacts. She valued magical artifacts with unique effects.</p><p>Of the remaining four magical artifacts, the flower basket, spirit fungus *ruyi*, and Buddha shrine all had a strong Buddhist aura, possibly Buddhist treasures that could only be activated by Buddhist cultivators.</p><p>Only that pure precious pearl was the most unique and eye-catching.</p><p>Although the position of the Buddha shrine was obviously more important, Jade Robe Immortal Monarch's gaze was still drawn to the pure precious pearl.</p><p>Immediately afterward, Jade Robe Immortal Monarch frowned almost imperceptibly because she noticed that Chaotic Demon Old Man was also staring at the pure precious pearl, without any attempt to conceal it.</p><p>"He's also eyeing the precious pearl. That's right, everyone's thoughts and vision are similar..."</p><p>Jade Robe Immortal Monarch sighed inwardly, hesitant.</p><p>Was it worth offending Chaotic Demon Old Man for a magical artifact of unknown use?</p><p>After weighing it, Jade Robe Immortal Monarch looked away, hesitating between the spirit fungus *ruyi* and the heart-protecting mirror. If she couldn't get the precious pearl, getting a defensive magical artifact was not bad either.</p><p>"Let's begin!"</p><p>Chaotic Demon Old Man spoke in a low voice.</p><p>He needed Jade Robe Immortal Monarch to cooperate in breaking the restrictions, and take away the treasures in the main hall before the seal collapsed.</p><p>Jade Robe Immortal Monarch nodded her head gently, raised her right hand, and a ray of red light flew out of her sleeve, a red silk ribbon. The ribbon appeared rather illusory, as if it were not a physical entity.</p><p>As the red silk ribbon appeared, it twisted and contorted. Then, one after another, pale figures entangled in red mist flew out of it. They were all male souls of extraordinary charm.</p><p>These souls were all stark naked, their faces filled with joy, as if immersed in something wonderful.</p><p>"The Immortal's Red Phoenix Curse (alternative: Red Phoenix Affliction) is becoming more and more refined," Chaotic Demon Old Man glanced at it, a trace of wariness hidden in his eyes.</p><p>Jade Robe Immortal Monarch looked at these souls lovingly, her eyes sparkling like spring water, giggled, and pointed her jade finger lightly towards the Golden Summit Main Hall.</p><p>*‘Swoosh!’*</p><p>The red silk ribbon lunged towards the restriction and immediately scattered like a cloud of mist.</p><p>The men inside changed their expressions drastically, and ferociously lunged at the restriction, lost their senses, and began to gnaw madly.</p><p>Chaotic Demon Old Man glanced at that spot deeply, flashed to another door, raised his black bamboo staff, and slowly pierced it into the restriction, his eyes slightly closed.</p><p>In the next moment, the Golden Summit Main Hall shook violently, and the restriction swayed unsteadily.</p><p>...</p><p>Inside the main hall.</p><p>The secret passage's exit was behind the stone statue.</p><p>Hiding in the secret passage, Qin Sang sensed the violent fluctuations coming from the restriction, his gaze slightly focused, while sensing the restriction, he also cautiously kept an eye on the changes in the seal behind him.</p><p>If the seal collapsed ahead of time, he could only retreat first.</p><p>The layout of the main hall appeared in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang's target was also locked on that precious pearl.</p><p>Although he did not have a handy defensive magical artifact, relying on the Thunder Escape Technique and Nascent Soul Talisman Puppet, he was enough to deal with most dangers, so he was not in urgent need.</p><p>As for the Empowering Treasured Pestle that Tan Hao specifically asked for, it was closest to the secret passage. Qin Sang knew that what Tan Hao really wanted was not necessarily this, but it was the easiest to obtain.</p><p>...</p><p>*‘Boom!’*</p><p>*‘Boom!’*</p><p>*‘Rumble...’*</p><p>Loud noises echoed continuously throughout the Pure Sea Sect, even drowning out the bell.</p><p>Both the pagoda and the Golden Summit were shaking violently.</p><p>Discipline Keeper True Man forced himself to ignore the coldness on his shoulders, focused on breaking the restriction, the three people were wary of each other, all ready to go, preparing to be the first to rush in after the pagoda was opened.</p><p>In contrast, Chaotic Demon Old Man and Jade Robe Immortal Monarch seemed much more harmonious.</p><p>Jade Robe Immortal Monarch pinched a strange spell with her jade fingers, maintaining it without moving, only the Red Phoenix Curse and those men were busy, slowly merging into the restriction.</p><p>Chaotic Demon Old Man was even more motionless as a mountain, the black light emitted by the black bamboo staff had already tainted a large area of the restriction.</p><p>As time went on, the Buddha's light of the Golden Summit Main Hall became dimmer and dimmer, shaking violently.</p><p>Just at this time.</p><p>The spirit formation in the air suddenly cracked, and several more figures flew in, each with a powerful aura, all Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Because the aura of the Scarlet Flame was fading, the flaws in the Sect Protecting Grand Formation were increasing. These people entered the formation later than Chaotic Demon Old Man, but they had broken in so quickly.</p><p>Before they had time to rest, they saw the situation of the Golden Summit and the pagoda at a glance. They looked at each other and rushed towards the Golden Summit without hesitation, even though Chaotic Demon Old Man was there.</p><p>But Chaotic Demon Old Man and Jade Robe Immortal Monarch completely ignored them, because the restriction was about to be broken. When those people came over, they would only see an empty Buddha Hall!</p><p>In the secret passage.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed that the aura of the Scarlet Flame behind him was becoming more and more violent, and the seal was heading towards collapse, his expression extremely dignified.</p><p>He could not see the situation outside, but he was certain that the power of the restriction in the Golden Summit Main Hall was rapidly fading.</p><p>"Now is the time!"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted in his heart and crushed the talisman in his hand forcefully.</p><p>*‘Puff!’*</p><p>In the medicine garden, the talisman in Tan Hao's hand burst into a ball of flame.</p><p>Tan Hao's gaze suddenly sharpened, he flung off the fireball, stepped on the *bu gang* (star walking) technique, and activated a set of array devices that Qin Sang had taught him. All the array devices were arranged at the key nodes of the medicine garden restriction, and at the same time, his palm rubbed the Misty Rain Pot forcefully.</p><p>*‘Boom!’*</p><p>Dense purple mist suddenly surged, rushing towards the sky, dyeing a void purple-red. In the purple-red mist, the illusory images of spirit medicines flickered faintly.</p><p>This sudden phenomenon instantly attracted everyone's attention.</p><p>Chaotic Demon Old Man and Jade Robe Immortal Monarch were also alarmed by the phenomenon!</p>
