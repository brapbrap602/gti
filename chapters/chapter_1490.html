<h1>Chapter 1481:  Slaying the Serpent</h1><p>The light mirror bought Shang Lu precious time.  His mind was focused on the Serpent Banner, completely unprepared for Liuli's perfected Ice Soul Divine Light. He couldn't dodge in time.</p><p>If it weren't for the timely protection of this treasure, the battle would have been decided already.  He was facing not only the Ice Soul Divine Light, but also Qin Sang's Golden Sinking Sword – attacked from both front and back.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>A series of explosions echoed from the light mirror in front of Shang Lu.  Cracks rapidly spread across its surface, covered in a layer of frost.  Before it could fully unleash its power, it froze, losing its effectiveness.</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light surged forward silently.  Liuli no longer concealed her power; the piercing chill sent a shiver down Shang Lu's spine.  The top technique of the Listening Snow Tower truly lived up to its name.</p><p>Simultaneously, a sword cry rang out, piercing the sky. A brilliant arc of sword light blazed across the night, radiating intense sharpness, aimed directly at Shang Lu!</p><p>Outside the arena, Hall Master Yin and the others watched with grave expressions, mobilizing their True Essence, ready to intervene at any moment.  In a battle between Yuan Ying cultivators, victory could shift in an instant.</p><p>Shang Lu, caught in a trap, lost his advantage. Defeat seemed inevitable unless he had a way to turn the tables.  The Ice Soul Divine Light in front, the Golden Sinking Sword behind – he was in extreme danger.</p><p>But Shang Lu's cultivation wasn't achieved easily.  Remaining calm, he ignored the Golden Sinking Sword behind him and immediately recalled his jade ruler.</p><p>Originally heading for Liuli, the jade ruler abruptly reversed course, soaring past Shang Lu, transforming into a white light and rushing towards the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Ruler and sword collided. Countless sword qi and white light scattered, a dazzling display of light and color, like a magnificent firework blooming in the night.</p><p>The jade ruler, hastily engaging, was undeniably knocked away.  However, the sword light's momentum was also deflected.</p><p>The pressure on Shang Lu lessened.  He slapped his waist pouch, releasing a ten-foot-long snow scarf.  The instant it appeared, it shattered into pieces, dispersed by the shockwave from the sword and ruler's collision, disappearing without a trace, incredibly fragile.</p><p>Just as everyone was wondering what was happening…</p><p>A white mist inexplicably rose around Shang Lu, enshrouding him.</p><p>‘Click click click…'</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Light followed, freezing the surface of the mist into ice. Shang Lu was encased in an ice sphere, the Ice Soul Divine Light continuously spreading inward.</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile…</p><p>Qin Sang moved swiftly.  He was seeing Liuli’s full power of the Ice Soul Divine Light for the first time; no wonder she was confident in facing Shang Lu.  If not for that self-activating treasure, they would have already subdued Shang Lu.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flickered. He recalled the Golden Sinking Sword and turned towards the Serpent Banner, not cooperating with Liuli to attack Shang Lu.</p><p>Many Yuan Ying cultivators lurked outside the arena, ready to interfere at any moment.  Even if they won, they couldn't seriously injure or kill Shang Lu.  His defeat was only a matter of time.</p><p>Therefore, it was better to give him a lesson.  Qin Sang had a plan. Ignoring Shang Lu, he appeared above the Serpent Banner and pointed downwards.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword shot downwards.  The force of the sword qi caused the Serpent Banner to tremble, about to fall.  The Banner's task was to suppress Liuli.  In a flash, the situation changed drastically, leaving it no time to adjust.  The three snow serpents, still recovering from the Ice Soul Divine Light's impact, let out fearful roars.</p><p>‘Crash!’</p><p>The Serpent Banner rose from the ground, violently gathering jade-white light and charging towards the Golden Sinking Sword.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Due to the haste, the three snow serpents were violently shaken from the banner, dazed and disoriented. This, however, roused their ferocity; they turned to charge back.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as they appeared, the serpents saw a blur – Qin Sang had materialized before them.  Their intelligence was not low; their demonic eyes glowed fiercely, emitting sharp roars. Their long bodies thrashed, three serpentine tails simultaneously smashing towards Qin Sang, the force astounding.</p><p>A Yuan Ying cultivator without adequate defenses would suffer severe injuries, at minimum, from such a strike.  A fierce wind assaulted his face.</p><p>“You dare, vile beast!”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, his mind visualizing the Buddhist seal.  He moved with the grace of a phantom, easily circumventing the python’s tail, appearing instantly above its head, close enough to touch.</p><p>He had completely mastered the first four seals of the *Seven Masters' Buddhist Seals*, including the Destroyer Seal, reaching the level of mental visualization.</p><p>He lightly extended a palm, pressing it against the forehead of one snow python.</p><p>The snow python couldn't react.</p><p>*Poof!*</p><p>Brains splattered, skull cracked.</p><p>Even at only the early stage of the fourth level of *Celestial Demon Transformation*, Qin Sang's physical body was comparable to a demon king in the initial stage of transformation.  With the Destroyer Seal, a mere妖丹 (yao dan) stage minor demon was no match.</p><p>The light in the snow python's eyes quickly vanished; it died instantly.</p><p>The guests, previously focused on Liuli and Shang Lu, finally turned their attention to Qin Sang.</p><p>“Body refinement?”</p><p>The crowd was astonished and uncertain.</p><p>The groom's spirit sword was blocked by the python banner and the jade-white Xuan light. He had no magical treasures in his hands, nor any visible magical fluctuations; yet he had instantly killed the beast with a bare hand!</p><p>The level of *Celestial Demon Body Refinement* was a secondary concern; his physical body was his least significant tool—perfect for diverting attention.</p><p>The remaining two snow pythons, hearts filled with fear, fled.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the tail of one, pulling with all his might. Scales flew, the snow python's bones cracked, and a terrible force exploded within its body, shattering its internal organs.</p><p>The last snow python, more clever, coiled around its banner and desperately charged toward its master.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Jin Chen's sword dispersed the jade-white Xuan light, striking westward, piercing the snow python's skull.</p><p>*Thud!*</p><p>A cultivator surnamed Yue dropped his jade cup, rising abruptly; the composure on his face vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang's movements were too fast.  With a palm strike, a grip, and a sword thrust, three snow pythons were instantly killed.  Those outside the arena were too slow to react, watching helplessly as the three precious snow pythons were slaughtered.</p><p>Even after the last snow python died, the body of the first one hadn't yet begun to fall.</p><p>Qin Sang grabbed the tails of all three snow pythons, extracted their demon cores, and with a flick of his wrist, tossed the corpses to Shi Xue, laughing heartily,  "I hear snow python meat is tender and delicious, a rare delicacy.  Our friends here are in for a treat today."</p><p>Shi Xue, smiling, caught the snow pythons.</p><p>Shang Lu, disregarding the proprieties of the ceremony, had attacked at the wedding. Shi Xue, no longer concerned with Tian Shan's reputation, felt Qin Sang had done well, venting her anger, and loudly proclaimed, "Thank you, Shang Zhangzuo, for this grand gift!"</p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side, Shang Lu finally managed to break free from the Ice Soul Divine Light.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The ice sphere shattered.</p><p>Shang Lu quickly darted away, his face slightly pale, offering a wry smile, "Sister Liuli is truly a prodigy, having achieved such mastery of the Ice Soul Divine Light."</p><p>Having personally experienced its power, Shang Lu no longer doubted it.</p><p>Liuli remained silent, her eyes glowing a deep blue, preparing to attack again.</p><p>Qin Sang dashed to Liuli's side, playing with the python banner in his hand.</p><p>"No need to continue.  Shang admits defeat."</p><p>Shang Lu was quite composed, knowing that having lost the banner, even facing Liuli alone would be difficult, let alone fighting two.</p>
