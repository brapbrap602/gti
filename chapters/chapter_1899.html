<h1>Chapter 1890: The Thunder Ancestor's Edict</h1><p>Silver threads descended,</p><p>stirring the Divine Court.</p><p>The heavens were pierced by the silver threads, and the barriers of the Divine Court were clearly no match. The cultivator behind the threads' power was self-evident.</p><p>‘Whoosh…whoosh…’</p><p>The ripples caused by the silver threads shook the Divine Court.</p><p>From the Three Enclosures, Four Symbols, and Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions to the Nine Heavens Thunder City, all the immortal mountains and divine halls swayed with the Divine Court, throwing its interior into chaos.</p><p>‘Swish! Swish! Swish!’</p><p>The tips of the silver threads gently swayed, bringing with them violent winds and surging clouds.</p><p>Kun Dao looked up at the nine heavens, her expression grave.  She turned her jade hand, producing an ancient and simple incense burner.</p><p>The burner was inscribed with the characters of the Three Primordial and Eight Meetings, adorned with carvings of phoenixes, qilin, and auspicious beasts.  Its base was decorated with swirling cloud patterns, with two dragons coiled around it, their claws supporting the burner.</p><p>The incense burner hung above the altar, trembling slightly.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>A melodious bell resonated.</p><p>On either side of Kun Dao, two Grand Masters were in meditation, refining their inner elixirs. They awoke at the sound, understanding Kun Dao's posture immediately.  Quickly calming their breath, they stood excitedly, moving to stand behind her.</p><p>One on the left, one on the right, they drew their magic swords, standing at attention with solemn expressions.</p><p>The remaining Masters also produced their magic swords, forming ranks behind the two Grand Masters, maintaining silence.</p><p>Simultaneously, the bell's sound reached the Zhongmao Zhizhi altar, and indeed all altars within the two Zhi regions.</p><p>The masters of each altar, along with their disciples, stood respectfully before their altars, instinctively holding their breath.</p><p>The Masters were unaware of the celestial anomaly, filled with excitement as they awaited the True Monarch's decree.</p><p>Without a doubt, what followed would be the grandest and most significant ritual ceremony since the decline of the Dao Court.</p><p>The term "Zhaijiao" doesn't refer to a single thing, but rather to "Zhai" (fasting rites) and "Jiao" (ritual ceremonies) separately.</p><p>'Zhai' signifies purity.</p><p>Zhai practices originated in the ancient times of ignorance.  Before offering sacrifices to Heaven, Earth, and spirits, people would bathe, change clothes, abstain from alcohol and meat, and refrain from sexual activity to show their sincerity and respect.</p><p>Thus, an ancient saying goes: Zhai means to reach the utmost clarity and purity, only then can one communicate with the divine.</p><p>The Daoist tradition initially absorbed and further developed Zhai practices. From the external form of sacrificial fasting, a more important "heart-fasting" or "inner fasting" emerged. They believed that observing precepts aided in heart-fasting, thus leading to the creation of many Daoist precepts.</p><p>Zhai, is pure and serene.</p><p>Jie (precepts), is alert and vigilant.</p><p>Daoism considers fasting and precepts fundamental to its laws and the gateway to seeking truth. It believes they can connect one to Heaven and Earth and the divine, benefiting cultivation.</p><p>Later, as Daoism's understanding of Heaven, Earth and the Dao deepened, realizing that Heaven, Earth and spirits existed only in legend, they used talismanic arts to invent talismanic deities, establishing the Divine Court, and modifying Zhai practices to be used in summoning talismanic deities.</p><p>Talismans deities are not Heaven, Earth or spirits.</p><p>Before performing a ritual, it's not necessary to be as meticulously devout as in ancient sacrifices, completing the external Zhai practices flawlessly, but one must engage in heart-fasting, calming and centering the mind.</p><p>The character 'Jiao' also originates from ancient sacrificial practices, referring to the ritual of praying to the divine.</p><p>Jiao means to offer prayers to Heaven, Earth and the spirits, similar in meaning to 'Ji' (sacrifice).</p><p>However, 'Ji' often uses animal sacrifices and blood offerings.</p><p>In Jiao ceremonies, incense, flowers, lamps, candles, fruit, wine, tea, etc., are prepared, respectfully offered to Heaven and Earth, and blessings sought from the divine.</p><p>Since ancient times, Zhai and Jiao have been paired. Before performing a Jiao ritual, one must fast and observe precepts.</p><p>After Daoism inherited these practices, it gave them new meaning.  The use of talismans, hand gestures, incantations, and other procedures when summoning talismanic deities are termed 'Jiao'.</p><p>The two are now used together, with "Zhaijiao" now referring to Daoist ritual ceremonies.</p><p>After the establishment of the Divine Court, Daoist cultivators rarely paid homage to Heaven, Earth, and spirits.  Zhaijiao rituals now refer to the ceremonies of summoning talismanic deities.</p><p>The complexity of a Zhaijiao ritual depends on the status of the deity being summoned.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A spiritual incense stick appeared in Kun Dao's palm. She inserted it into the incense burner; fragrant smoke curled upwards.</p><p>The smoke surrounded the Masters, lingering for a long time.</p><p>Kun Dao pinched her fingers, creating a divine talisman which she dropped into the incense burner.</p><p>The incense burner immediately emitted rays of precious light, combining with the fragrance to shower the Masters, light as water.</p><p>Like heavenly water bathing their bodies, washing away worldly filth, transforming them into pure white Daoist robes.</p><p>This is the first step of the Zhaijiao ritual, called the offering of incense. In all Zhai cultivation matters, sincerity is conveyed through incense, starting with the offering.</p><p>The talisman used by Kun Dao is a type of incense talisman, used in conjunction with spiritual incense, called the Bathing Incense Talisman.</p><p>The talisman provided the Masters not only with external changes, but also washed away their mental distractions, purifying their hearts and minds.</p><p>Kun Dao's movements were frequent, inserting various spiritual incense sticks into the burner, each with a different talisman.</p><p>Fifteen incense talismans were issued in succession.</p><p>Kun Dao sheathed her sword and stood; the other Masters did the same.</p><p>All altars fell silent.</p><p>Kun Dao, along with numerous cultivators, appeared as if clothed in celestial garments, each holding a ritual sword. Their robes flowed, and their bearing was utterly serene.</p><p>At this moment, all cultivators were calm in mind and spirit, devoid of any distracting thoughts.</p><p>Kun Dao stood before the altar, wielding her ritual sword. A divine talisman materialized effortlessly as she performed a choreographed sword dance, chanting aloud:</p><p>“Nine Heavens Golden Dragon, Elixir of Immortality.</p><p>Come forth, Supreme Being, unbound by the void.</p><p>I summon thee now, to ascend the Celestial Palace.</p><p>Swiftly, as commanded by the Upper Palace of the Divine Thunder!”</p><p>The other cultivators behind her moved in unison, chanting along, as did those at the other altars.</p><p>Under the night moon, within the Daoist territory, cultivator after cultivator stood before their altars, their movements resembling a sword dance – each step, each flourish precise, rhythmic, and measured.</p><p>The incantations pierced the heavens.</p><p>A golden pillar of light erupted from the Baishi altar, shooting skyward, its end unseen.</p><p>The next moment, a dragon's roar shook the heavens.</p><p>A golden dragon descended!</p><p>This was no true dragon, but a phantasmal image, clawed and scaled, with an otherworldly majesty exceeding even the celestial chariots' dragons and surpassing any demonic saint in its dragon-like appearance.</p><p>The golden dragon roared, diving downwards.</p><p>As it was about to crash into the altar, Kun Dao remained unmoved, her ritual sword guiding the dragon. The dragon swished its tail, its jaws clamping down on the talisman, then ascended back into the heavens.</p><p>At that instant, Daoist cultivators at altars under the Daoist court's control – those in Zhongmao, Jing, Du, and the branch altars – all heard the dragon's roar.</p><p>Golden light flickered in the heavens.</p><p>Suddenly, a multitude of dragons appeared.</p><p>Countless golden dragons, riding beams of golden light, descended to the mortal realm, surging into various altars.</p><p>Across the Daoist double-prefecture, golden light filled the sky, clearly visible from beyond the borders.</p><p>But it wasn't over yet.</p><p>Kun Dao released another talisman.</p><p>“Divine Thunder decree, proclaimed to all heavens.</p><p>Dragon messengers deliver, fulfill the decree.</p><p>Swiftly, as commanded by the Upper Palace of the Divine Thunder!”</p><p>With the chant's completion, the dragon's roar echoed again across the Daoist double-prefecture, though lacking the previous might and power.</p><p>Golden light sprinkled down from the sky.</p><p>Each point of light contained a golden scaled Jiao dragon, each carrying a decree, which they delivered into the various sects' main altars.</p><p>“Summon the celestial horses, to convey the mandates.</p><p>With utmost speed, instantly arriving.</p><p>Swiftly, as commanded by the Upper Palace of the Divine Thunder!”</p><p>Another decree was issued. This time, Kun Dao pointed her ritual sword towards the east.</p><p>…</p><p>At Jushan Prefecture…</p><p>Many sects outside the Daoist order had either sealed their mountains to avoid calamity or sent their elite disciples to battle the encroaching beasts, leaving only a few cultivators guarding their mountain gates.</p><p>In this precarious moment,</p><p>most cultivators gathered before the main hall, with the more vigilant among them having already set up altars, awaiting the Daoist True Monarch’s decree.</p><p>Those cultivators in high places within these sects could see the astonishing celestial phenomenon in the west: a sky ablaze with golden light.</p><p>All cultivators were awestruck by the spectacle produced by Kun Dao’s incantations.</p><p>This was the power of a True Monarch!</p><p>This was the foundation of the Daoist order!</p><p>Suddenly, the cultivators felt a presence, looking up to the heavens to see golden light descending toward them.</p><p>Within the light, a magnificent celestial horse, mouth bearing a decree, transformed into a streak of light, entering the altar before their very eyes.</p><p>Instantly, those at the main altars of various sects understood the decree's contents and began their rituals accordingly.</p><p>The Zhongmao, Baishi, and Jushan prefectures – all three altars were mobilized by Kun Dao.</p><p>Vast golden light illuminated the heavens and earth.</p><p>In that moment, a gigantic Xuan altar seemed to have been born, formed from numerous smaller altars,</p><p>with Kun Dao at its center.</p><p>But it wasn't enough!</p><p>“Scarlet script and jade characters, obeyed and followed.</p><p>Proclaimed to all immortals, quickly verify and present.</p><p>Fly and deliver, with wind and fire's swiftness.</p><p>Swiftly, as commanded by the Upper Palace of the Divine Thunder!”</p><p>As the decree was given, golden light danced across the three prefectures, countless and dense.</p><p>The numerous golden lights resembled fireflies under the night sky, swirling in the wind, the vast majority heading toward the battlefields to the north and south, fast as lightning.</p><p>On the battlefields,</p><p>cultivators were engaged in fierce combat with the beast tide.</p><p>Suddenly, they saw the wind and fire decrees.</p><p>Those who received the decrees immediately retreated, prostrating themselves before the Baishi altar from afar, and depositing the decrees into the altar.</p><p>They then drew their ritual swords, preparing for battle.</p><p>The altar immediately emitted golden light, connecting with the celestial Xuan altar.</p><p>Kun Dao's actions were establishing the Daoist order's four divine stations.</p><p>Daoist scriptures note: when establishing a Xuan altar, one must first establish four stations, with decrees conveyed like the postal stations of the mortal world.</p><p>These four divine stations are the Golden Dragon Station, the Jiao Dragon Station, the Golden Horse Station, and the Wind and Fire Station, each with different purposes.</p><p>Establishing these stations requires the power of the divine court, each station overseen by a divine official to facilitate their actions.</p><p>The aim was to unify the Daoist forces, performing rituals to transform heaven and earth into a Xuan altar!</p><p>Kun Dao, along with an incense burner, ascended into the sky, standing upon the altar and inserting fragrant incense into the burner.</p><p>“Incense arises from sincerity, smoke from faith.”</p><p>With a cry of "Honesty reaches the Celestial Realm, all immortals descend from the Jade Steps!", Kun Dao raised her head, her gaze following a wisp of incense that ascended to the heavens.  The fragrant smoke pierced the barriers of the Divine Court, passed through cloud-capped mountains, entered the Thunder City, and soared to its eighth heaven.</p><p>This highest heaven housed only one temple, dedicated to the Supreme Thunder Deity, the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable.</p><p>Kun Dao continuously offered various incense, her movements with sword and talismans growing increasingly swift.</p><p>"Incense of Dao, Virtue, and Non-Action; Non-Action's pure and natural incense;</p><p>妙洞真香, 灵宝慧香, 超三界香, 三炷真香...</p><p>Incense clouds swirled, rising in offering."</p><p>As stick after stick of incense was inserted into the burner, the other cultivators closed their eyes, sensing the Xuan Tan (altar), and along with the sword dance, chanted the "Incense Blessing Text." The incense clouds grew thicker, connecting with the Thunder Deity's hall.</p><p>Kun Dao softly chanted:</p><p>"The innate One… Venerable, the Jade Pure King of the Thirty-Six Heavens."</p><p>The cultivators responded: "Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p>Kun Dao continued:</p><p>"Jade Pivot descends to the world, the gate to eternal life and treasure.</p><p>Golden seals in the heavens, secret master of the flawless scriptures!"</p><p>The cultivators responded: "Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p>…</p><p>Each incantation, each word uttered by Kun Dao, was accompanied by a talisman. The ceremony had reached its crucial point – the invocation.</p><p>In the eighth heaven of the Thunder City, the demon gods watched the dazzling light of the Thunder Deity's hall in utter terror. As the ritual progressed, the hall and the mortal world interacted, transforming into a thunder temple.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>'Rumble!'</p><p>Thunder light filled the eighth heaven, radiating a terrifying aura; a single thunderbolt could reduce them to ashes.  But even more alarming to the demon gods was the terrifying pressure descending from the heavens as silver threads penetrated the Divine Court.</p><p>They felt their insignificance, as small as ants.</p><p>Finally, the ritual neared completion.  All cultivators of the Heavenly Xuan Tan felt incredible pressure; their arms trembled as they held their swords.  Kun Dao sent forth the final talisman, took a deep breath, and suddenly raised her sword to the sky.</p><p>Following her command, the cultivators mustered all their strength, chanting along with Kun Dao:</p><p>"Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Palace, Supreme Jade Pure King.</p><p>Transformed and filling the ten directions, discoursing and transcending nine winds.</p><p>Above the Thirty-Six Heavens, reviewing the precious scriptures, examining the jade books.</p><p>Before the fifteen hundred kalpas, position truly righteous, authority greatly transforming.</p><p>Hand holding the golden Ruyi, proclaiming the Jade Pivot treasure scriptures.</p><p>Unsubmissive transformed into dust, issuing commands swift as wind and fire.</p><p>With a pure heart to cultivate great vows, with wisdom's power to subdue all demons.</p><p>Overseeing the five thunders, operating the heart of the three realms.</p><p>Father of all beings, teacher of all spirits.</p><p>Great Saint, Great Compassionate, Supreme Emperor, Supreme Dao.</p><p>Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p>The chant echoed through heaven and earth, shaking the three realms.  Kun Dao had established the Heavenly Xuan Tan to summon the Thunder Deity, the Nine Heavens Responding Yuan Thunder Sound Universalizing Heavenly Venerable.  The chant was known as the "Thunder Deity's Precious Proclamation."  The Thunder Deity's rank was equivalent to a Celestial Master of the Daoist school; the summoning incantations for deities of this rank were called "Precious Proclamations."</p><p>Within the Thunder Deity's hall, the chant echoed and grew louder, as if countless cultivators were chanting simultaneously within the temple.  The deity sensed the invocation.</p><p>The Thunder Temple erupted in blinding light; a shadowy figure slowly emerged from above.  At the heart of the light was a divine statue, clad in thunder robes, with a fierce demeanor.  Its left hand held a thunder drum, its right a cone, as if about to strike.  Its form was almost impossible to look at directly, seemingly composed entirely of thunder and lightning, imposing and awe-inspiring!</p><p>The demon gods dared not gaze at the Thunder Deity. They forgot the Great Saint's orders, revealing their true forms, prostrating themselves, trembling, and filled with terror.  Anyone who looked closely at the deity could see lightning arcing across its body like cracks – wounds, some healed, some still fresh.  But this did not diminish the deity's overwhelming power.</p><p>At that moment, the silver threads had successfully pierced the Divine Court's barrier, their tips gently swaying, seemingly searching for their target.</p><p>Qin Sang and the two demon kings pursuing him noticed the celestial phenomenon. Before they could understand what was happening, they sensed an overwhelming power erupting from the Thunder City. The Bi Lin Demon King and the black roc changed color, halting abruptly.  Forgetting their pursuit of Qin Sang, they turned toward the city, their ferocious expressions replaced by intense fear.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly stood from his jade seat, gazing at the dazzling thunder light in the heavens.  For some reason, the Divine Thunder Seal within him stirred, and he vaguely sensed a connection with the lightning.  This was no illusion; the seal's activity intensified.  Qin Sang's expression changed; he felt something momentous was about to happen to him.</p><p>A deafening crack of thunder!  Lightning illuminated the heavens.  Qin Sang's eyes widened as he seemed to see a thunder god, transformed into lightning, descending from the heavens, striking directly at him!</p><p>(End)</p>
