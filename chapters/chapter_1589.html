<h1>Chapter 1580: The Ullambana Festival</h1><p>Chapter 1580: The Ullambana Festival</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>Qin Sang returned directly to Zhuozhou from the Northern Wastelands, first going to Mount Non-Thought.</p><p>The sky was clear and cloudless.</p><p>Standing atop the mountain where a stone tablet marked "White Cloud Waterfall" stood—the only way into Mount Non-Thought—Qin Sang looked up at the boundless expanse of sky.</p><p>He flew upward a short distance, but the magnificent cloud waterfall was gone.</p><p>He released his spiritual sense, but couldn't detect any fluctuations from Mount Non-Thought's protective formation; even the stone tablet was missing.</p><p>He had intended to ask Situ Yu about the origins of the Old Man of Yan Mountain, but now he couldn't even find the mountain gate.  The mountain's protective formation was no ordinary thing; forcing his way in was impossible.</p><p>Mount Non-Thought’s seclusion wasn't a joke; it had truly withdrawn from the world.</p><p>It would be inappropriate to intrude.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, transformed into a rainbow, and flew away.</p><p>He returned to the Clear Void Illusionary Realm.</p><p>Qin Sang and his body double sat facing each other, taking out the spoils of their trip: two pills, an ice disc, and several of Yuefei's belongings.</p><p>The woman's storage pouch had survived.</p><p>To make the act believable and prevent Su Zinan from obtaining the pouch and uncovering her scheme, Yuefei had only prepared some necessary pills and the like for her possessed self.  The treasures bestowed by Su Zinan remained on her person.</p><p>After all, she was the beloved concubine of the Divine Transformation's adopted son.</p><p>Even after destroying so many treasures in the ice cave battle, her pouch still contained two powerful magic weapons.</p><p>The most precious was a divisible silver bracelet.  Qin Sang had confiscated it after Yuefei's "death."  It could restrict an opponent's magic weapons, a peculiar treasure with potentially unique effects.</p><p>Qin Sang planned to keep it for himself.</p><p>The other two items in the pouch were less significant; he would give them to the Xie family and the Loutai Temple.</p><p>Once he had time, he would re-refine them to prevent Lu Ye from recognizing them.</p><p>Besides these, the pouch also held numerous spirit stones and various pills, making Qin Sang quite wealthy.  He would no longer need to personally manage his resources.</p><p>After all, the Xie family and Loutai Temple were insufficient to support Qin Sang's needs.</p><p>Having carefully categorized everything, Qin Sang turned his attention to the water elemental lord's belongings: the two snow-white pills.</p><p>He and his body double had carefully sensed them along the way.  The body double had attempted to use various ice-type magical powers, but they could only determine that the pills weren't for cultivation enhancement.</p><p>The last item was the ice disc.</p><p>Slightly larger than Qin Sang's palm, the disc had inner and outer layers. The inner layer constantly circulated an aura that remained contained and didn't leak out.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure if it was cold煞 energy. After retrieving it from the spirit array, it no longer emitted cold煞 energy; holding it only felt cool.</p><p>Divine objects conceal their nature.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the disc for a long time, noticing that the aura's changes were erratic. Sometimes it formed magnificent mountains and rivers; other times, icy palaces.</p><p>There were also various other scenes of unclear meaning, without any pattern.</p><p>Each scene lasted less than a breath before changing endlessly.</p><p>The ice palace was grand and imposing.  From the scene within the disc, Qin Sang sensed a breathtaking beauty, wondering if such a place truly existed.</p><p>These images had no clear meaning.  After some thought, Qin Sang gave the disc to his body double, instructing him to refine it like a magic weapon.</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Qin Sang furrowed his brow.</p><p>The ice disc wasn't a magic weapon and couldn't be refined by a cultivator, nor was it a spiritual treasure.  Otherwise, even without understanding the Treasure Refining Scripture, he would have sensed the unique aura of a spiritual treasure.</p><p>The good news was that his body double successfully activated the cold煞 energy within the disc, making cultivation possible.</p><p>“The cold煞 energy within the ice disc is extremely concentrated, more than enough to allow my body double to cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light! Could this special treasure be a necessary component in the water elemental lineage’s legacy, specifically for cultivating with cold煞 energy?” Qin Sang pondered, then his expression changed slightly, “Wait…”</p><p>A flash of inspiration struck him as he considered array formations. He made a discovery,  “It’s similar to an array instrument, but it can’t form arrays on its own. It's used to assist in setting up a certain type of special spirit array; it seems to be an array-eye treasure… This array's power must be incredibly formidable!”</p><p>He couldn’t be certain; it might just be one of the ice disc’s functions.</p><p>Like the pills, this brought him back to the same issue: to understand their true functions, he must first obtain the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's legacy.</p><p>For now, they would only serve as auxiliary cultivation tools.</p><p>The body double put away the ice disc, preparing to cultivate the Ice Soul Divine Light and gradually familiarize himself with the disc.  After mastering the Ice Soul Divine Light, he would continue to research its other functions and try to utilize it in cultivation!</p><p>This time, his body double would also be in seclusion for a long time.</p><p>His main body ceded the cave dwelling to his body double, reversing their inner and outer positions.</p><p>The cave dwelling's restrictions were sealed.</p><p>The cultivator briefly meditated, taking his time, then quietly left Pushan Mountain, flying southeast.  He stopped near the border of Zhuozhou, entering a large market town called Yan Shui Xu.</p><p>Yan Shui Xu is under the jurisdiction of Buling Mountain and is one of the largest market towns in Zhuozhou.  It’s unclear how Buling Mountain will manage Yan Shui Xu after its closure, as no changes are yet apparent.</p><p>In the Nineteen Rain States, where sects govern, true marketplaces and cities catering exclusively to cultivators are rare. Those that exist are usually small, secluded markets for limited transactions.</p><p>Larger cities contain both cultivators and commoners, though there is a clear distinction, and commoners generally avoid disturbing cultivators.</p><p>Flight is forbidden within the market.</p><p>Having recently offended Luye, to avoid trouble Qin Sang used a disguise technique, quickly blending into the heart of the market to find his target – the Liuzhou Hall branch.</p><p>This is Liuzhou Hall’s largest branch in Zhuozhou.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached, three Golden Core cultivators emerged, accompanied by a crowd filling the main hall; even Qi Condensation cultivators were scarce.</p><p>The three Golden Core cultivators, two men and a woman, appeared to have made a rich haul, their faces beaming.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached, one of the men glanced at him. Sensing an aura of unfamiliarity despite the man’s refined air, he felt a strange unease.</p><p>As they passed, the man suddenly had a thought and secretly activated his Spirit Eye technique. A faint electrical spark flashed in his left pupil.</p><p>He prided himself on the technique’s subtlety, having used it countless times to observe others without incident.</p><p>However, the moment the spark appeared, the man felt a sharp, stabbing pain in his left eye. He shuddered, let out a pained groan, and covered his eye.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>His companions, startled to see blood seeping through his fingers, were both shocked and enraged.  “You…”</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The man, gritting his teeth against the pain, shoved his companions away.  Unable to move, overwhelmed by fear, his voice trembled.  “I was impolite, a thousand deaths are not enough to atone!”</p><p>The other party didn’t respond, walking into the Liuzhou Hall without looking back.</p><p>“Thank you, senior, for sparing my life!”</p><p>The man, as if pardoned, quickly pulled his companions away.</p><p>Running a considerable distance, the man removed his hand.</p><p>His companion was horrified to discover his left eye was a bloody mess; his painstakingly cultivated technique was ruined, its future uncertain. They had no idea when the attack occurred.  “Could that person have…?”</p><p>The man, surviving a brush with death, felt immense relief, saying bitterly, “I used this technique to observe the Zhexing Sect’s Grandmaster, and he didn’t notice…Luckily, this senior was merciful. To survive is a blessing; I almost implicated you both.”</p><p>The three exchanged hushed words, not daring to linger in the market, and hastily left.</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Qin Sang, having briefly punished the offender, ignored the matter and entered Liuzhou Hall.</p><p>The branch manager was a Yuan Ying cultivator. He had witnessed the events outside and hurried downstairs to personally greet Qin Sang, leading him to a private room.</p><p>Qin Sang waved away the offered tea, producing a token. “This is my credential. Please examine it.”</p><p>The manager apologized, verified the token using a secret technique, bowed deeply, and returned it.  “The token is genuine. I am Jiang Mu, I greet Cultivator Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang returned the bow and addressed him as Daoist Jiang.  “Has anyone presented this token seeking me in recent years?”</p><p>“Please wait a moment.”</p><p>Jiang Mu personally went to check the records, returning after a stick of incense.</p><p>Upon receiving a negative response, Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>A century ago, Liuli traveled west to study Buddhism and vanished without a trace; her whereabouts and progress remained unknown.</p><p>He collected his thoughts and stated his purpose.</p><p>Qin Sang wanted to purchase information from Liuzhou Hall on various powerful factions in the Central Plains, regardless of era or location, extending beyond the Nineteen Rain States – the older, the better.</p><p>While surprised, Jiang Mu wasn’t particularly astonished. He guessed Qin Sang might have discovered a secret realm or obtained an item of unknown origin, seeking information through this means.  He had seen this many times.</p><p>This approach was akin to searching for a needle in a haystack, with only a few ever finding clues.</p><p>However, spirit stones smoothed the way.</p><p>They reached an agreement. Qin Sang produced a bag of spirit stones; Jiang Mu immediately ordered the relevant files to be brought, leaving Qin Sang alone in the private room.</p><p>Qin Sang set up several isolating restrictions, turning to the files on Baguan View and Ganlu Chan Monastery, counting the names and checking all cultivators above the Yuan Ying realm.</p><p>The two sects' appearances of Nascent Soul cultivators were well-known and not a secret.</p><p>Master Liusu, the venerable abbot of Ganlu Temple, a true saint of Buddhism!</p><p>Another, Huang Xi, was a Nascent Soul cultivator, the ancestor of Baguan Scenic Spot!</p><p>Furthermore, both lived in the same era, their breakthroughs to Nascent Soul separated by no more than two hundred years.</p><p>"Both were Nascent Soul cultivators!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned grave.</p><p>It was certain that the two individuals vehemently condemned in the Water Phase Master's last testament were the ancestors of these two sects.</p><p>With the fall of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and the rise of Baguan and Ganlu Temple, what exactly transpired back then?</p><p>The Water Phase Master's resentment was immense, leading Qin Sang to suspect them as the masterminds behind the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's destruction.  He hastily flipped through the scrolls, glancing over numerous jade slips, finally locating the record of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Strangely, for such a powerful sect, the entry was incredibly brief.  Repeated readings yielded no useful information; even the location of their mountain gate was deliberately omitted.</p><p>"Baguan and Ganlu Temple intended to completely annihilate them…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>The situation was unclear, involving the two top sects of Buddhism and Daoism, fraught with hidden dangers, making open investigation impossible.</p><p>"A superlative immortal sect wouldn't have only one lineage.  As the saying goes, even a centipede doesn't die easily.  The Water Phase Master's legacy has already surfaced; won't the others be far behind?  With both Buddhist and Daoist Nascent Soul cultivators constantly emerging, they could have been a deterrent.  Now that the disappearance of Nascent Soul cultivators is widely rumored, the Nanman Gu God Cult and the Northern Wasteland Demon Sect are stirring.  The descendants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, after hiding for so long, should be making their move, shouldn't they?"</p><p>Qin Sang lightly tapped the jade slip.</p><p>His heavenly tribulation was approaching; it wouldn't hurt to wait a little longer.  All sorts of strange beings would inevitably surface.</p><p>Having made his decision, Qin Sang reviewed the remaining scrolls, committing them to memory. He then dismissed the attendant waiting outside, requesting Jiang Mu's return.</p><p>"I have another matter to request of your esteemed hall. I ask for your assistance in gathering treasures that can enhance spiritual awareness – spirit pills, elixirs, secret techniques, and magical artifacts, all are acceptable."</p><p>This was Qin Sang's true objective.</p><p>After his breakthrough to the later stage, refining the demonic fire had become significantly easier.</p><p>Qin Sang had believed that continuing to refine the demonic fire would greatly enhance his spiritual awareness, even possibly reaching a level comparable to Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>However, after three years of diligent cultivation following his breakthrough, Qin Sang realized he might have been overly optimistic.</p><p>While the speed of refining the demonic fire remained impressive, there were also concerns.</p><p>His cultivation of the Fire Seed Golden Lotus involved strengthening his spiritual awareness through refining the demonic fire, and he was still far from reaching the third stage of the technique – the Fire Lotus Transforming into a Lotus Throne.</p><p>But this didn't mean there was no bottleneck.</p><p>As time passed, the more demonic fire the Fire Lotus absorbed, the greater the demands placed on him, exceeding the rate of his spiritual awareness increase.  In the future, he might reach a limit, achieving a balance between his spiritual awareness and the Fire Lotus.</p><p>He also had to thank the Soul-Nurturing Wood, which subtly brought him immense benefits; otherwise, cultivating the Fire Seed Golden Lotus wouldn't have been so smooth.</p><p>Continuing to forcibly refine the demonic fire resulted in an uncertain outcome – breakthrough or loss of control.</p><p>Based on Qin Sang's experience, the probability of success was negligible.</p><p>He either needed a major breakthrough in his cultivation or had to find another way to improve his spiritual awareness.</p><p>Of course, the Cloud-Traveling Sword had absorbed the Soul-Nurturing Wood, its soul light constantly nourishing his primordial spirit, so he would eventually refine the demonic fire, though it would take a considerable amount of time.</p><p>The upcoming turmoil in Central Plains presented both danger and opportunity.</p><p>He wished to further enhance his strength, not only to protect himself during the chaos but also to gain something from it.</p><p>To this end, Qin Sang had approached the Six States Hall.</p><p>This was a major undertaking!</p><p>Jiang Mu, with a beaming smile, immediately produced a jade slip, showcasing the Six States Hall's collection.  "Daoist Qin, please take a look.  Recently, the hall received a Wuding Flower, which can be refined into Wuding Pills, significantly beneficial even to us Yuan Ying cultivators. I can authorize giving you the formula. Also, this 'Turtle Drawing Technique' is an unparalleled method for cultivating spiritual awareness, created by a renowned Yuan Ying cultivator from East Sea Immortal Mountain, later falling into Miemeng Island, and perfected by generations of cultivators…"</p><p>Qin Sang examined them carefully, ultimately shaking his head.</p><p>The Wuding Flower was merely one of the main ingredients for Wuding Pills; collecting all the ingredients would take an indefinite amount of time, not to mention the uncertain efficacy.</p><p>As for the 'Turtle Drawing Technique,' he had already acquired similar techniques of that caliber at Xuan Tian Palace; by the time he encountered the bottleneck, it would likely be ineffective.</p><p>A glimpse was enough to understand the whole picture.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's extremely high standards, Jiang Mu's smile faded. He carefully assessed Qin Sang, raising his estimation of the man.</p><p>Putting away the jade slip, after a moment of contemplation, he said, "Daoist Qin, are you aware of the Ullambana Meeting?"</p><p>"The Buddhist Ullambana Meeting?  I've heard it's held only once every thousand years," Qin Sang replied, having some knowledge of it.</p><p>"Not a thousand years, but five hundred,"</p><p>Jiang Mu explained.  "The Buddhist Ullambana Meeting and the Daoist Zhongyuan Ceremony are essentially the same event.  They are simply held alternately by the Buddhist and Daoist sects, with different names. They are the greatest events in the Central Plains."</p>
