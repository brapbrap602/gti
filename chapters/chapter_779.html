<h1>Chapter 771: Ancient Cultivator's Relics</h1><p>Qin Sang retracted the Flying Night Rakshasa, then summoned the Ghost Banner, channeling a surge of Nine Netherworld Demon Fire to envelop himself in a black fiery shield.</p><p>He took two steps forward; the fire shield swayed slightly.  He felt the Demon Fire's power – incredibly violent and terrifying – but upon contact with his shield, it softened.  The core of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire showed no sign of unrest.</p><p>The shield trembled, the fiery aura blocked, though it could easily pierce through, it didn't.  The Demon Fire, though extraordinary, was inanimate.  Encountering a fire of its origin, it showed a kinship. As long as he didn't provoke it, it wouldn't attack.</p><p>Even under the shield's protection, the impact on his spirit was unavoidable.  However, protected by the jade Buddha, the effect was negligible.</p><p>"It works…"</p><p>Qin Sang's face brightened. He returned the fat silkworm to its container.</p><p>As he neared the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, the purple mist dissipated.  No matter how potent the purple mist, it was no match for the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, completely blocked.  The fat silkworm, having maintained the anti-venom armor for so long, finally rested, falling into a deep sleep upon returning to its container.</p><p>Qin Sang moved sideways, hugging the cliff face, proceeding cautiously, inching forward.  The black Demon Fire was before him.</p><p>His eyes widened; he was extremely nervous, not daring to breathe, afraid of any mishap.  If someone were to disturb the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, even slightly, he wouldn't have a chance to escape, instantly reduced to ashes.</p><p>The space occupied by the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire wasn't large, yet it felt incredibly long to Qin Sang.  His back was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang passed through the Demon Fire's barrier.  His mind relaxed, he gasped for breath, casting a wary glance at the fire before examining the space ahead.</p><p>Grey-white ghostly mist drifted everywhere. There was no wind, but the cold was bone-chilling, resembling the environment of the Immortal Tomb.</p><p>How large was this space?</p><p>What creatures lurked within?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment, not hurrying to leave the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire's influence.  If something changed, he could escape quickly. He remained where he was, releasing the Flying Night Rakshasa to scout.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa's corpse-energy surged, silently blending into the ghostly mist.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes slightly, using the soul mark within the Flying Night Rakshasa to guide it deeper into the mist.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, the ancient teleportation array, the same time of emergence…</p><p>All these coincidences, if anyone said the Seven Killing Hall and the Purple Micro Palace were unrelated, Qin Sang wouldn't believe it for a second.</p><p>If this place resembled the Immortal Tomb, it wasn't surprising.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa traveled some distance into the mist without encountering any tombs or gravestones.</p><p>Qin Sang murmured softly, "It seems not to be an ancient burial ground! No Immortal Tomb!"</p><p>His expression relaxed somewhat.</p><p>The Immortal Tomb of the Purple Micro Palace was a place both Dongyang Bo and Chen Yan feared, containing ghost kings with power comparable to Nascent Soul masters. If this place also had an Immortal Tomb, Qin Sang would hesitate.</p><p>Even stranger, after so long, the Flying Night Rakshasa hadn't encountered a single ghost.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa also stopped, its neck twisting, eyes gleaming strangely, fixated on the left side of the ground.</p><p>A piece of bronze protruded from the soil, looking like a corner of armor.</p><p>The bronze was heavily rusted, mostly buried underground. It seemed to be an ancient cultivator's battle armor.</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa glanced around, then moved towards the armor.</p><p>It extended its ghostly hand, lightly touching it.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the seemingly indestructible armor crumbled at the touch, a piece falling off and turning to dust.  Over countless years, time had worn it away, completely decaying.</p><p>"The armor is decayed?  Could there be a lingering soul?  If not, how did this ghostly place form?"</p><p>Qin Sang whispered, his eyes filled with sadness.</p><p>This armor was clearly no ordinary object; the person who wore it must have been an extremely powerful ancient cultivator. Now, buried deep underground, its power was gone, while the ancient cultivator was nowhere to be found, not even their remains.</p><p>Even such a powerful ancient cultivator could not achieve immortality, perishing in this extremely secluded valley, unknown to the world.</p><p>Could today's cultivators truly reach the immortal path, shining as brightly as the sun and moon?</p><p>The Flying Night Rakshasa continued forward, discovering a broken sword, which also crumbled at a touch, turning into smoke.</p><p>Then, a skeleton appeared in its view.</p><p>This skeleton, whether severed at the waist in life or damaged after death, only had its upper half remaining.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a jolt of excitement, finally noticing something unusual.  He immediately ordered the Flying Yaksha to investigate.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha approached silently, its eyes darting as it examined the bones.  It paused slightly, then leaned down and touched them.</p><p>At that moment, a pale light flashed briefly from the bones, and a ghostly figure burst forth. With a shriek, it lunged at the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>Suddenly assaulted by the ghost's wail, the Flying Yaksha merely flickered its gaze, its form blurring as it instantly retreated several yards.</p><p>The ghost, devoid of reason, relentlessly attacked, its cries filled with intense hatred. It was a resentful spirit, intent on destroying the Flying Yaksha.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>A ghostly hand appeared without warning, plunging into the ghost's body. With a gentle twist, a surge of corpse energy erupted.</p><p>The ghost abruptly froze, letting out a scream before being instantly torn apart by the spectral claw.</p><p>"Looks frightening, but not very strong. Probably about the level of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  Many cultivators died in this Immortal Tomb. The more cultivators who die, the more souls are absorbed, and the more powerful the ghosts become, eventually breeding a Ghost King.  Since no cultivators have entered here before, there probably won't be very powerful ghosts…"</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the resentful spirit's strength and analyzed the situation.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha flickered and returned to the bones.  Touching them again, no more ghosts appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang, emboldened, ordered the Flying Yaksha to accelerate its exploration.</p><p>The further they went, the more weapons littered the ground – swords, spears, halberds, and more. None were preserved; even those appearing intact crumbled to dust at the slightest touch.</p><p>More and more skeletons appeared.  In some places, the bones were piled into massive heaps, enough to make one's scalp tingle – evidence of a past battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang instructed the Flying Yaksha to continue probing, focusing on isolated skeletons.  A small percentage held vengeful spirits, all similarly weak; no exceptionally powerful evil ghosts were encountered.</p><p>The Flying Yaksha even disturbed a small pile of bones, causing a dozen or so resentful spirits to fly out, all of comparable strength.</p><p>All the spirits had completely lost their intelligence, driven only by boundless resentment and killing intent.</p><p>"If all the ghosts here are similar to this one, it will be manageable.  But this isn't enough…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, ordering the Flying Yaksha to avoid the bones and proceed directly to the deepest part of the space to ascertain its size and the number of buried skeletons.</p>
