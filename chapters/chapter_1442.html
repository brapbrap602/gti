<h1>Chapter 1434:  Spiritual Body Manifestation</h1><p>A Buddhist physical cultivation martial art.</p><p>It must have been obtained from the Jinghai Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the information Tan Hao had previously investigated: the Jinghai Sect was struck by the Flame Tide, and before its destruction, some treasures were washed away.</p><p>It's normal for someone to obtain a Nascent Soul-level martial art, unable to use it themselves or find a suitable buyer, and then bring it to the Wanmo Grand Assembly for trade.</p><p>Physical cultivators are incredibly rare in this world!</p><p>This is not only due to the scarcity and loss of physical cultivation techniques, but also because the difficulty of physical cultivation in the modern era far surpasses that of spiritual cultivation.  Even Golden Core-stage physical cultivators are extremely rare.</p><p>Unless one can, like Qin Sang, directly draw upon inexhaustible stellar energy to temper their body and are unafraid of stellar煞 (sha) erosion.</p><p>In Xiao Han Domain, with its occasional appearance of rare spirit herbs, and throughout the entire Bei Chen Realm, Qin Sang and most Nascent Soul cultivators have interacted, yet he has never seen a single pure physical cultivator!</p><p>Of course, some people do practice physical cultivation in addition to other methods.</p><p>There are mainly two reasons for this.</p><p>Firstly, cultivating the spirit, energy, and body all contribute to breaking through bottlenecks. Nascent Soul cultivators should have similar insights and will try this path.</p><p>Secondly, it's to improve their physical bodies to guard against extreme situations.</p><p>However, they will eventually find that this consumes too much energy with little effect, making it a losing proposition. Moreover, those ordinary physical cultivation techniques cannot meet their needs.</p><p>Therefore, their cultivation levels are not very high.</p><p>Martial arts.</p><p>Qin Sang prefers to call them martial arts divine abilities. Top-tier martial arts divine abilities are even rarer than physical cultivation techniques.</p><p>He has cultivated the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* to its fourth stage, his physique is comparable to a transformed great demon, but the techniques' inherent abilities are only the Heavenly Demon Transformation, strengthening the body and manifesting phoenix wings; and the Heavenly Demon Dharma Image, whose true function is still unclear.</p><p>Without using magic treasures or spells, relying solely on physical cultivation abilities, he wouldn't be a match for a same-stage demon king.</p><p>The reason is that Qin Sang does not possess martial arts divine abilities.  He has a strong physique but cannot unleash his true strength.</p><p>Demon kings can refine their own bloodline power and master bloodline divine abilities, which humans cannot learn. He had confirmed this point by consulting Jing Yu.</p><p>This gap becomes increasingly apparent with higher cultivation levels.</p><p>Qin Sang tried to purchase them in the Bei Chen Realm, only obtaining several inferior martial arts divine abilities that were useless.</p><p>Of course, with Qin Sang's current cultivation, he could study these martial arts divine abilities and try to create his own, but his foundation in physical cultivation is shallow, relying on a rapid advancement through demonic cultivation techniques. He doesn't know how much time and energy it would take to succeed, and he has too many things to do.</p><p>Qin Sang doesn't lack methods to deal with enemies, so he hadn't paid much attention to this before.</p><p>For him, the greatest use of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* is granting him the art of thunder escape, and making his physical body less fragile to cope with dangerous situations.</p><p>When passing through the storm belt, the power of his strong body was evident, sometimes able to withstand the storm directly; otherwise, it wouldn't simply be a matter of depleted True Qi and accumulated impurities in his medicinal pills.</p><p>His cultivation only reached the mid-Nascent Soul stage when he set off, which was indeed a bit rushed.</p><p>"A Buddhist martial arts divine ability."</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flickered.</p><p>Since the person put it up for sale without special instructions, it should not require the cooperation of Buddhist techniques and can be used by physical cultivators.</p><p>He wondered if there were any Nascent Soul-stage physical cultivators in the North Sea.  The competition pressure shouldn't be too great, unless a demon king participates, but demon kings place more importance on treasures that enhance their bloodline power.</p><p>This top-tier martial arts divine ability is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart pounded.</p><p>He looked up and down, unable to find the trading conditions for the *Seven Master Buddha Seal*, and asked Master Yinquan for clarification.</p><p>Master Yinquan said, "It means that when we participate in the Wanmo Grand Assembly, we should bring all our assets! As long as we have sufficient treasures on hand, we don't have to worry about not having trading opportunities. The last day's trading session will start from dawn and will be unlimited in duration, giving participants ample time to weigh the pros and cons and make exchanges. Completing a single transaction may require several or even a dozen handovers. Of course, each exchange must go through the Wanmo Grand Assembly, and they will take a commission."</p><p>After a trading session, the organizers make a fortune.</p><p>It's so orderly, the name 'Wanmo Grand Assembly' feels a little incongruous.  You wouldn't know that it's backed by righteous forces.</p><p>The predecessors who founded the Wanmo Grand Assembly had great foresight.</p><p>Qin Sang shifted his gaze to other treasures on the list. He hadn't decided whether to participate in the Wanmo Grand Assembly, waiting until he refines the Hidden Fragrance Pill.</p><p>Three star feathers from a Star-Riding Bird.</p><p>Celestial Fall Iron.</p><p>The Cold Bone Demon Hand, an ancient demonic sect relic of the Cold Bone Dao.</p><p>…</p><p>Piece after piece of unparalleled treasures dazzled the eyes.</p><p>The Wanmo Grand Assembly is indeed the greatest event in the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to refine the Hidden Fragrance Pill and then inquire about where to go to visit Master Yinquan before the Wanmo Grand Assembly.</p><p>Master Yinquan gave him a Dan Ding token, "Fellow Daoist, go to Mingzhu Island; activating this token will summon someone to pick you up."</p><p>Qin Sang recalled Mingzhu Island's location, bowed, and took his leave.</p><p>Leaving Blue Star Island, Qin Sang returned to his cave without delay.  He entered, activating the protective barrier, and saw Tan Hao performing a memorial rite for Tan Jie.  When leaving Jing Hai Sect, Tan Hao had taken Tan Jie's coffin to prevent his brother's remains from being lost.</p><p>Asking Tan Hao to investigate the Huanglong Palace and the Wanmo Assembly, two significant events, Qin Sang entered his cave, sealed the barrier, and instructed Tan Hao not to disturb him under any circumstances.</p><p>He sat in meditation.</p><p>A black flame emanated from Qin Sang's brow, revealing the Fire Lotus Seed.</p><p>Gradually, the fluctuations from the Fire Lotus Seed stabilized, gently floating before his chest.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled deeply, having reached peak condition, and absorbed the Fire Lotus Seed into his body.</p><p>*Click!*</p><p>A jade bottle beside him opened by itself, and an Yinxiang Pill flew towards Qin Sang, its fragrance filling the air.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at it and swallowed it.</p><p>As the pill entered his body, it immediately transformed into a cool medicinal energy, merging with his being. Qin Sang felt his mind clear, experiencing a sensation of blissful transcendence.</p><p>...</p><p>Four months later.</p><p>*Creak!*</p><p>The door to the quiet chamber opened, and Qin Sang stepped out.</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings; his eyes shone with an unprecedented brilliance, which he quickly subdued.</p><p>Finding Tan Hao absent, Qin Sang pondered for a moment before flying from the cave.  Remembering the location of a deserted sea area, he soared into the sky.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure silently appeared above the empty sea.</p><p>His actions were somewhat peculiar; his eyes were half-closed, as if he was sensing something.  Then, a slight smile touched his lips. "My sensory range has nearly doubled. This is the benefit of spiritual sense transformation?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Qin Sang subtly moved his mind, suddenly releasing his spiritual sense. A powerful aura emanated from him.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The wind and clouds above the sea changed drastically.  Near-substantial gale winds formed into visible streams of air.</p><p>Confirming that no one was nearby, Qin Sang no longer hesitated and unleashed his spiritual sense fully, allowing it to sweep across the area, causing various phenomena.</p><p>*Rumble…*</p><p>Qin Sang calmly observed the celestial events, analyzing the benefits and changes brought about by his spiritual sense transformation.</p>
