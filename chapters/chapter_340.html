Chapter 333: The Truth


Bubbles gurgled in the swamp.

Mist rolled, and tree shadows deepened.

Tan Hao traveled westward. His speed wasn't fast, and his escape technique wasn't refined, not matching his apparent cultivation. The masked man and Qin Sang followed easily.

The masked man was patient. After leaving Stone Island, he didn't rush to attack, silently trailing Tan Hao deep into the deserted swamp.

Or perhaps, he was cautious.

The masked man was also at the early Foundation Establishment stage, his aura stronger than Tan Hao's.  He had the element of surprise, but even a lion uses its full strength to hunt a rabbit. It was best to wait for absolute certainty before striking.

One strike, one kill.

He was waiting for Tan Hao to lower his guard.

Tan Hao wasn't completely unaware. During his flight, he left some hidden restrictions, but the masked man and Qin Sang easily detected and avoided them.

Deep night silence made the swamp even darker.

A quarter of an hour later.

The masked man, having pursued Tan Hao into a forest, suddenly stopped. He had lost Tan Hao's trail.

The ancient trees in this forest weren't dense, and the surrounding space was clear. Just a moment ago, Tan Hao's aura had been constant, leading straight to this point, then vanishing without a trace.

The masked man released his divine sense, searching the area, but found nothing.

The night wind picked up; everything seemed normal.

Tan Hao had vanished completely, leaving no clue behind.

Not far behind, Qin Sang was hidden in a tree crown, also observing.

Because of the distance, Qin Sang hadn't noticed how Tan Hao disappeared either. Like the masked man, he couldn't tell if Tan Hao was hiding, using some other method to evade them, or had already flown far away.

"I underestimated Tan Hao..."

Qin Sang frowned, pondering for a moment. He didn't rush to reveal himself, choosing to wait and see.

The masked man must have other methods.

As Qin Sang expected, the masked man, after searching and failing to find Tan Hao, wasn't anxious. Instead, he sneered and took out a round, mirror-like artifact.

He held two fingers together, spiritual energy surging as he rapidly drew on the mirror's surface.

Strange runes merged into the mirror, which began to glow, gradually becoming as bright as a full moon.

However, the masked man concealed this light, preventing it from leaking out.

With the final stroke, the masked man shouted, "Rise!"

The mirror flew from his hand, rising high into the sky and becoming a moon embedded in the night. The surrounding mist was dispersed by its 'moonlight.'

The bright light instantly illuminated the surroundings.

The next moment, the man turned sharply to his left, spotting an extremely faint shadow slowly moving between two ancient trees.  It was Tan Hao.

Tan Hao, using some unknown method, had concealed himself and his aura perfectly, slowly trying to escape.

He was at the edge of the 'moonlight.'  A moment later, and he would have been gone.  But there are no 'what ifs.'

Tan Hao had left this measure in place just in case, never expecting someone would actually be following him, let alone so easily break his arrangements.

Exposed by the mirror's light, Tan Hao was startled, his back covered in goosebumps.  He knew that anyone who could follow him silently and easily find him must have a cultivation far exceeding his own.

Not daring to look back, not even knowing who he had offended, Tan Hao transformed into a streak of light, escaping with all his might.

He knew his chances of escape were slim, but even the slightest possibility couldn't be abandoned.

Watching Tan Hao flee, the masked man didn't immediately pursue him. Surprise and anger flashed in his eyes, almost amused by the scene.

"Damn it, he's only at Qi Refinement!" the masked man cursed.

No wonder he was so angry.  Qin Sang was also surprised.  Tan Hao, using his full escape technique, revealed his true cultivation: only the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement.

Had he known, the masked man could have easily captured Tan Hao back on Stone Island.  Why bother with such a cautious pursuit?

It was the strange mask that helped Tan Hao disguise his aura.

Even Qin Sang had been fooled.

Qin Sang had seen artifacts and spells that concealed aura, like the Spirit Concealment Technique, but this was the first time he'd seen one that disguised a higher cultivation so perfectly.  This mask was remarkable. Even at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, Qin Sang hadn't noticed anything amiss.

He wondered if those at the late Foundation Establishment stage had noticed.  But since Tan Hao dared to participate in the auction and the black market, he must have been confident in the mask's abilities.

It certainly wouldn't fool a Core Formation cultivator, but they wouldn't lower themselves to bother with him.

This disguise was easily broken and didn't enhance Tan Hao's actual strength.

Just like now, as soon as Tan Hao fought, his true cultivation would be revealed.

However, on Stone Island, due to the Yin Mountain Pass's rules, cultivators were restrained and rarely fought. Tan Hao wouldn't cause trouble, so his disguise remained intact.
Unable to maintain the mask, his face was revealed to Qin Sang.

It was indeed Tan Hao!

Compared to his time at the Kui Yin Sect, he looked much older.

Qin Sang was already seventy, and Tan Hao, only a few years younger, looked like a man in his forties, appearing older than Qin Sang.

This was normal for cultivators. If Tan Hao couldn't reach Foundation Establishment, he would age even faster in the next twenty years, eventually becoming a white-haired old man.

But Tan Hao was already over sixty and still hadn't reached Foundation Establishment. His chances were slim now.

Compared to his time at the Kui Yin Sect, Tan Hao's appearance hadn't changed much. Qin Sang recognized him instantly.

Tan Hao's former vigor was gone, replaced by weariness and exhaustion in his eyes, which made Qin Sang sigh.

The immortal path pursued by cultivators was so ethereal. They were also just struggling to survive in this world, part of the masses.

The masked man cursed a few more times, leisurely waiting for Tan Hao to escape a certain distance before casually giving chase. In his eyes, Tan Hao's treasures were already his.

Behind him, Qin Sang followed silently, secretly summoning his Ebony Sword.

He had intended to let the masked man test Tan Hao's strength, but now there was no need. In a fight, Tan Hao wouldn't last a few rounds against the masked man.
