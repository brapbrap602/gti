Chapter 602: The Green Copper Fragment


Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid and Three Light Jade Liquor were both incredibly valuable treasures, enough to drive cultivators to madness.  It wouldn't be surprising for even Dao companions to turn against each other over them.


Qin Sang and Yun Youzi had a deep friendship, forged through years of shared experiences and mutual support. Now, their bond was being tested by the allure of these extraordinary treasures. Would their friendship survive? Qin Sang hoped Yun Youzi wouldn't disappoint him.


Qin Sang walked to the edge of the Southern Bright Flame, summoning his Ebony Sword and preparing himself as he watched Yun Youzi.


Yun Youzi sat cross-legged in the center of the spirit array, his expression solemn. He held the small bird spirit puppet in his upturned palm, presenting it to the Southern Bright Flame.


Under Yun Youzi's control, the azure light within the spirit array converged on the bird puppet, eventually merging into its body.  


At the same time, the bird puppet spread its wings and hopped on Yun Youzi's palm.  It opened its beak wide, hungrily devouring the aura of the Southern Bright Flame.


As it did so, the puppet's bones and feathers became increasingly crimson, as if flames were truly burning within it, spreading outwards until they enveloped the entire bird.


After a final chirp, it vanished, truly transforming into a ball of fire!


Having absorbed the aura of the Southern Bright Flame, it had become assimilated by the flame.  The flames on the bird puppet now closely resembled the true Southern Bright Flame.


"Go!"


Yun Youzi's palm trembled slightly.


The bird puppet unfurled its wings and shot like an arrow straight towards the Southern Bright Flame, instantly disappearing within.  It had chosen a spot close to the wall of the passage, where the Southern Bright Flame was weakest.


‘Poof!’


The bird puppet, surprisingly, wasn't instantly incinerated upon entering the Southern Bright Flame.


A small bird-shaped shadow appeared deep within the flames.


The aura of the Southern Bright Flame it had absorbed over the years now took effect, helping the bird puppet merge with the flame. However, this integration wouldn't last.  The puppet's stored aura was rapidly depleting.


Years of accumulation couldn't withstand the searing heat of the true Southern Bright Flame. When the aura was exhausted, the bird puppet would be destroyed.


The puppet's body was visibly shrinking, able to endure for at most ten breaths.


The moment the bird puppet entered the Southern Bright Flame, Qin Sang acted.  Man and sword as one, he flew towards the flames like a moth to a lantern.


Yun Youzi clenched his hand abruptly and shouted, "Open!"


The bird puppet within the flames flapped its wings fiercely, dancing in the fire.


Its dance was extraordinarily graceful, but there was no pleasant birdsong to accompany it.  In the ensuing silence, there was a touch of melancholy.  This would be the bird puppet's final performance.


Using the bird puppet as a lever, Yun Youzi achieved a great effect with minimal effort.


The Southern Bright Flame, which even Nascent Soul ancestors dared not touch, rippled at its edge. A gap appeared between the flame and the wall.


Qin Sang arrived just in time, instantly passing through the opening and successfully reaching the other side of the Southern Bright Flame.


He barely registered the terrifying heat as he was immediately enveloped by a blast of icy wind.


He experienced a sudden shift from extreme heat to extreme cold.


Qin Sang shivered.  His vision was filled with white. Ice shards seemed to be swirling within the icy wind, converging with the Southern Bright Flame, creating a bizarre spectacle of coexisting ice and fire.


It was extremely cold, but not unbearable.  The cold-resistant artifacts Qin Sang had prepared weren't needed.


The scene before him made it clear that the sword Qi-infused wind was far more potent than the Profound Frost wind. This was likely because the heat of the Southern Bright Flame was neutralizing the wind's chill.


However, the extreme cold was still palpable, directly assaulting his Yuan Shen.  Anyone else would have their Yuan Shen shattered and be frozen to death within moments.


The closer he got to the sword scar and the source of the sword Qi, the more terrifying the cold became.


The Profound Frost wind was insignificant compared to this. Even Nascent Soul ancestors, who could easily traverse the Profound Frost wind, wouldn't dare to challenge this sword Qi wind.


Time was limited.  After a quick survey of his surroundings, Qin Sang focused his gaze ahead.


As Yun Youzi had said, the passage ended abruptly not far ahead, forming a cliff. Between the end of the passage and his current position was a stone chamber, similar in size to the one containing the Southern Bright Flame.


If Yun Youzi's information was correct, the cauldron fragment was inside.


The stone chamber was also filled with the sword Qi wind, but Qin Sang was undeterred. He immediately rushed towards it.


‘Whoosh…’


The wind howled, exerting immense pressure.


Qin Sang braved the wind, pushing himself to the limit as he reached the entrance of the stone chamber and looked inside.


The sword Qi wind raged like knives within the chamber. Ancient restrictions were clearly in place, preventing the chamber's destruction.


The chamber was empty. Anything that had been inside would have been swept away by the wind long ago.  However, at the center of the chamber, the sword Qi wind formed a vortex, within which a faint green light flickered.


Qin Sang focused his gaze, piercing through the green light.  He saw a fist-sized green copper fragment.


It was simply a piece of green copper, covered in rust, with no inscriptions or ancient characters. Its edges were sharp, as if it were a fragment of a shattered copper artifact.


The copper fragment appeared remarkably heavy. Despite its small size, it lay firmly on the ground, unmoved by the raging wind.


Only against the backdrop of the sword Qi wind did its extraordinary, ancient aura become apparent.


Qin Sang glanced at it, sensing no divine aura of an artifact.  He hoped he hadn't come all this way for nothing.


‘Clang!’


His Ebony Sword hummed, releasing a surge of sword Qi that slashed at the vortex of wind.


Qin Sang pushed off the ground, taking advantage of the momentary disruption in the wind to rush into the center of the vortex and reach for the green copper fragment.


He was wary, but to his surprise, the fragment offered no resistance. His hand closed around it, and a surprising warmth emanated from it.


Having been exposed to the sword Qi wind for countless years, the copper fragment remained unaffected. This was how a fragment of an artifact should behave!


Qin Sang marveled inwardly, acknowledging the fragment's extraordinary nature.


He grasped the fragment and tried to lift it. His body suddenly felt heavier, and he almost stumbled. He hadn't lifted the fragment, but it nearly pulled him down.


How could it be so heavy?


Qin Sang cursed under his breath, quickly channeling more True Yuan into his hand. He finally managed to lift the fragment.


Only three breaths had passed.


Retrieving the copper fragment had been far easier than Yun Youzi had anticipated.  Qin Sang even had time to search the chamber and examine the fragment.


From this vantage point, he could see more clearly.  The chamber was completely bare, everything swept away by the sword Qi wind, save for the green copper fragment.


Furthermore, neither his divine sense nor his True Yuan elicited any response from the fragment.


Apart from its unusual weight, the green copper fragment showed no other peculiarities.
