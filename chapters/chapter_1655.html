<h1>Chapter 1646: Convergence</h1><p>A black line moved nimbly within the pool, constantly absorbing the fire poison.</p><p>Master Huaiyin sensed the black line's aura, his gaze fixed upon it, his expression growing grave.  He asked sternly, "Five Transformations?"</p><p>The Poison King shook his head. "It's merely a corpse refined into a Gu; mere outward show."</p><p>Seeing his reluctance to elaborate,</p><p>Master Huaiyin didn't press further. He gazed deeply at the black line, then surveyed the subterranean palace.</p><p>At that moment, both he and the Poison King noticed the fire spirit nurtured by the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool; its aura was unusually weak, inconsistent with the pool itself – clearly abnormal.</p><p>"Someone has been here!"</p><p>They both spoke almost in unison, perceiving the anomaly.</p><p>The true fire spirit had been taken beforehand, and not long ago; the disturbance of their arrival must have startled it away.</p><p>The fire spirit was secondary; the Flowing Fire within the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool was the true essence.</p><p>However, since entering the legacy mansion, they had been blindly wandering, lacking understanding of the layout of the Unseen Immortal Sect.  They desperately needed someone familiar with the sect to guide them, but those who had entered before had vanished without a trace.</p><p>Now, finally encountering someone, they naturally wished to consult.</p><p>Master Huaiyin scanned his surroundings, spotted a stone door, and disappeared into the stone passage.</p><p>The Poison King, needing to control the black line, was temporarily unable to move, sitting cross-legged at the edge of the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool, fully concentrating on using the black line to absorb the fire poison.</p><p>As the black line moved, the dazzling golden light gradually weakened.</p><p>At this time, vibrations continuously emanated from the well shaft. The Poison King, paying close attention, realized it wasn't Master Huaiyin battling someone, but the forceful breaking of a restriction.</p><p>Shortly after, Master Huaiyin returned empty-handed, shaking his head. The other party had retreated swiftly, and seemed intimately familiar with the island's restrictions. By the time he gave chase, they had vanished.</p><p>"We'll encounter them eventually in the mountains."</p><p>The Poison King wasn't worried; he continued to manipulate the black line, accelerating the absorption of the fire poison.</p><p>From their arrival on Fire Rhinoceros Island to this point, within a short time, the island's energy was visibly becoming chaotic.</p><p>The lava waterfall erupted in waves of fire, showing no sign of weakening; instead, each wave grew larger than the last.</p><p>The intense flames surged back towards the floating island, a sea of fire.</p><p>The chaos escalated.</p><p>The booming sounds and tremors reached even the subterranean palace. The Poison King could clearly sense it, understanding that the floating island was being affected by them; its destruction was only a matter of time. He hurriedly focused on absorbing the fire poison.</p><p>During this time, Master Huaiyin left the subterranean palace, walking on lava, striding through the intense flames, searching aimlessly. He occasionally found things, but nothing caught his interest.</p><p>Before long, the Poison King finally completed the absorption of the fire poison and immediately came to join him.</p><p>By then, Fire Rhinoceros Island was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>The island held little value; neither wished to linger, so they randomly chose a path down the island.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>Having just left Fire Rhinoceros Island and not yet escaped the range of the flame veins, they heard a deafening roar from behind, a sudden, astonishing surge of energy.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The violent energy, having accumulated to its limit, finally erupted.  Crimson flames soared into the heavens, the sky a single expanse of red.</p><p>Fire Rhinoceros Island began to collapse from its center; huge rocks continually crashed down.</p><p>The energy surge formed a dazzling crimson ring of fire, rapidly expanding outwards, instantly reaching their backs, about to engulf them.</p><p>The Poison King summoned a poison cloud, forming a protective ring of poison.</p><p>Master Huaiyin's body resonated with the sound of thunder, his Qi and blood vibrating, making the flames unable to approach.</p><p>Unharmed, they burst from the flame veins, reached a distant mountain peak, and turned to look back at the scene of destruction they had wrought – its scale only slightly less than the previous azure pillar.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the phenomenon reached its peak and began to subside, part of Fire Rhinoceros Island remained intact.</p><p>A fire dragon, supporting the northern section of the floating island, had withstood the impact. Fire Rhinoceros Island was decimated, but a portion did survive.</p><p>This was due to the island's unique spirit array. However, the fire dragon was precarious, its endurance uncertain.</p><p>The two didn't linger, hurrying to meet Elder Fan at Emperor's Gift Mountain.</p><p>In the distance, Qin Sang's avatar appeared in a hidden location in the mountains, looking back at Fire Rhinoceros Island.  Seeing the floating island collapse, he couldn't help but sigh, "What a pity."</p><p>The central palace, where the subterranean palace was located, had crumbled; the Flowing Fire Illusionary Pool was surely gone.</p><p>Looking at his palm, the Fire Jade Centipede was fast asleep, its round belly rising and falling.</p><p>The avatar turned towards Emperor's Gift Mountain and set off immediately to rejoin his main body.</p><p>…</p><p>In the mountains.</p><p>Before a crude cave dwelling.</p><p>Mo Xingdao sat in silent meditation.</p><p>Su Zinan, after learning of the divine opportunity at Di Shou Mountain, secluded himself, apparently refining some treasure, and remained unseen for a long time.  Mo Xingdao, however, remained composed, patiently awaiting Su Zinan while adjusting his own state.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Su Zinan finally finished refining his treasure and emerged.  Mo Xingdao rose to greet him, but noticed a certain gloominess in Su Zinan's expression.  He wondered silently if the refinement had failed.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Mo Xingdao, Su Zinan was deeply troubled, facing a difficult choice.  He had successfully refined the soul of Yan Shan Lao Ren, gaining much information about the Wu Xiang Sect, including one piece of news that greatly intrigued him—the existence of an Ascension Array.</p><p>This Ascension Array was a closely guarded secret of the Water and Fire Halls, requiring two specific treasures: the Ice Instrument Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Pearl, along with a corresponding altar and the Ice-Fire Order.  Yan Shan Lao Ren had obtained the array's diagram and the method to forge the Ice-Fire Order from the tomb of the Water Hall Master.  However, he lacked both the Ice Instrument Disc and the Fire Rhinoceros Pearl.</p><p>He was in a difficult position. These two treasures were the core components of the Ascension Array, irreplaceable.  The Ice Instrument Disc was likely taken by the Fire Demon—at least there was a lead there.  The whereabouts of the Fire Rhinoceros Pearl, however, remained completely unknown, even to the Water Hall Master.</p><p>Normally, the Ice Instrument Disc was kept in the Ice Instrument Palace, while the Fire Rhinoceros Pearl was enshrined on Fire Rhinoceros Island. Only when a Wu Xiang Sect member was about to breakthrough to the Divine Transformation stage would the two treasures be retrieved for the array. If the Fire Rhinoceros Pearl hadn't been moved, it was most likely in the Fire Hall.</p><p>Su Zinan then understood why Yan Shan Lao Ren had flown towards Fire Rhinoceros Island after leaving the stone beach; he had been searching for the pearl.  Regrettably, Su Zinan, preoccupied with the divine opportunity at the temple, hadn't refined the soul on the spot after defeating Yan Shan Lao Ren. Now it was too late; he had missed the island.</p><p>Returning now to the Fire Hall would displease Mo Xingdao, and Zhu Wu Dao wouldn't wait forever.  Which was more important: the divine opportunity or the Ascension Array?  It was a difficult question.</p><p>Furthermore, Di Shou Mountain was on the verge of a Daoist conflict, a chaotic battle Su Zinan had eagerly anticipated.  He was one soul away from completing the Demon Banner.  Great cultivators were all cunning and unfathomable.  Catching a newly ascended cultivator like Yan Shan Lao Ren alone had been a stroke of luck, unlikely to be repeated.  The chaos of the conflict would provide an opportunity to fish in troubled waters.  Su Zinan regretted that the Three Corpses Death God Banner did not create a detachable avatar, limiting his range, and he didn't have the Moon Guard to command here.</p><p>Unaware of Su Zinan's thoughts, Mo Xingdao took flight towards Di Shou Mountain.  Su Zinan followed, occasionally glancing toward Fire Rhinoceros Island, his expression unchanged, while inwardly weighing his options, hesitating.</p><p>As they flew, a sudden crimson light erupted from the direction of Fire Rhinoceros Island.</p><p>Su Zinan froze.  Mo Xingdao also noticed the distant phenomenon. "Where is that coming from?"</p><p>"Judging by the direction, it's the Fire Hall!" Su Zinan's voice was grim.</p><p>"First the Water Hall, now the Fire Hall," Mo Xingdao clicked his tongue. "Do these people have to resort to such drastic measures when searching for treasures?" The Wu Xiang Sect had remained unchanged for ten thousand years, so the Fire Hall couldn't have collapsed on its own.</p><p>"First the Water Hall, then the Fire Hall... that route..." Su Zinan repeated Mo Xingdao's words, and a sudden insight struck him.  A Fire Demon, possibly seen at the clifftop, possessed the Ice Instrument Disc.  A suspected Fire Hall successor… if he knew about the Ascension Array...</p><p>All the pieces fell into place. A figure emerged in his mind. It seemed his old and new grievances would be settled at once.</p><p>A flash of killing intent crossed Su Zinan's eyes, quickly suppressed.  He glanced one last time at Fire Rhinoceros Island before withdrawing his gaze, his decision made. He flew directly toward Di Shou Mountain!</p><p>…</p><p>The divine mountain stood majestic, its grandeur breathtaking.  The Wu Xiang Sect boasted countless peaks, but none rivaled Di Shou Mountain.  At the mountain's northern foot, a winding stone path snaked upward, passing through forests before reaching a cluster of ancient temples halfway up the mountain. Beyond that, brilliant light and layered restrictions obscured the view.</p><p>A faint, ethereal voice echoed from the path's entrance:</p><p>"Legend says 'Di Shou' was named by the Wu Xiang Sect's founder, who claimed his power was divinely bestowed. But it is unclear whom this 'Di' refers to. Some suspect the temple's owner was a Heavenly Emperor from the upper realms..."</p><p>The voice was cut short by a cold laugh.</p><p>"Heavenly Emperor?  I think you mean emperor. Those righteous people are always so good at flattering themselves.”</p><p>The ethereal voice chuckled softly. "True, countless cultivators have explored the temple over the ages without confirming the identity of its owner."</p><p>The Celestial Emperor of the Upper Realm is likely just a legend.  Brother Fan remains as sharp as ever, always hitting the mark. Back in our younger days, when the sect sent us on missions,  Brother Fan could see through everything I did. He always outshone me, leaving me with only second-place rewards. It seems things haven't changed.”</p><p>The voice grew clearer.</p><p>A figure flickered into existence on the first stone step of the stone path, solidifying into Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>He had escaped pursuit by three Daoist masters, appearing unscathed.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao stood on the steps, gazing at the forest beside them.</p><p>The woods were dark and dense, seemingly empty.</p><p>However, after Zhu Wu Dao's appearance, the shadow of an ancient tree deepened, revealing a figure – the solitary Fan Laomo.</p><p>He laughed, “You were simply too careless, younger brother. I noticed Brother Lu acting strangely and followed him, uncovering your secret.  I never expected you to hide so deeply and have such ambition.  The sect owes you a grand ceremony of ascension!”</p><p>His tone was laced with mockery and surprise, but also a hint of amazement.</p><p>Tian Hao Tower wasn't exactly harmonious, but neither were they completely estranged.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, not only a descendant of the Wuxiang Xianmen, but also a late Yuan Ying cultivator, had concealed his cultivation, undetected by the entire sect.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao seemed to ignore the sarcasm, saying, “I had no choice. Revealing my cultivation would expose the Qu Yang Mountain lineage, inviting scrutiny.”</p><p>“Then why did you contact me?”</p><p>Fan Laomo asked.</p><p>He had been blocked by a cloud wall, losing Zhu Wu Dao's trail. Unexpectedly, upon reaching the foot of the mountain, before even beginning his search, Zhu Wu Dao had invited him to meet.</p><p>“Fellow disciples, we know each other well.  We're far more trustworthy than those Daoists and strangers,” Zhu Wu Dao said frankly.</p><p>“Trust?”</p><p>Fan Laomo scoffed but didn't contradict him.</p><p>Trust might not have existed between them, but they were undeniably the most suitable partners.</p><p>However, he wouldn't be so easily fooled.</p><p>Fan Laomo assumed the air of a Grand Elder, his eyes flashing: “I'll overlook your Qu Yang Mountain lineage's clandestine activities within the sect for now.  If you don't want your entire lineage annihilated, tell me everything you know about the Wuxiang Xianmen!”</p><p>Fan Laomo was ruthless and quite capable of it.</p><p>With the Tian Hao Tower sect master in seclusion, and Old Demon Ku Rong's status even lower than Fan Laomo's, he certainly had the power to destroy Qu Yang Mountain.</p><p>However, Zhu Wu Dao showed no fear.</p><p>He calculated, calmly saying, “Brother Fan, please be patient. The appointed time is near. Once those friends arrive, I'll explain the Transcendence opportunity. If you don't believe me, you can go ahead; just use any of the Five Phases Tokens.”</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was also puzzled.</p><p>The agreed time was ample for the Crying Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xing Dao to arrive, yet neither had appeared. Had something gone wrong?</p><p>Fan Laomo maintained his distance, hidden in the shadows, his thoughts unknown.</p><p>The appointed time approached.</p><p>A tearing sound echoed from afar.</p><p>Two beams of light appeared in the forest, swiftly approaching.</p><p>“Friend Mo! Friend Su!”</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's eyes narrowed. He looked intently at Mo Xing Dao, unsurprised that he had brought help.</p><p>“You’ve finally arrived. We must hurry! The Crying Spirit Cave Master and another cultivator are close friends and possess a Wood Phase Token. They likely intended to ditch us and ascended alone,” Zhu Wu Dao stated, believing it the only possibility.</p><p>“Huh? When did Elder Fan arrive?”</p><p>Su Zi Nan, noticing Fan Laomo in the shadows, asked in surprise.</p><p>“I didn't expect Friend Su to get involved,” Fan Laomo said with a forced smile.</p><p>There was no time for pleasantries; they set off immediately.</p><p>However, Fan Laomo deliberately lagged behind, keeping his distance and making markings without concealing them from the others.</p><p>The markings were for the Poison King and Master Huai Yin.  Fan Laomo’s cooperation with them was a matter of necessity.</p><p>With Zhu Wu Dao’s side gaining the upper hand, Fan Laomo needed his own reinforcements.</p><p>Learning the Poison King and Master Huai Yin’s destination,</p><p>Su Zi Nan exclaimed, “Fire Rhinoceros Island?”</p>
