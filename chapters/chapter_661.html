Chapter 653: Li Wu Palace (Additional Chapter for Patron Mu Han!)


“Qin Sang, may you achieve immortality…”
Yagu closed her eyes, her breath fading fast.
“Sleep well. Everything will be alright,” Qin Sang whispered in her ear.  Without hesitation, he imprinted the Heavenly Corpse Talisman into Yagu's soul, then cast a series of restrictive spells.

Yagu fell into a deep sleep, a lingering smile on her face.  It wasn't a smile formed by the curve of her lips, but an intrinsic joy, like a clear night sky after the rain.

Qin Sang gazed at her, a heavy sense of responsibility settling upon his shoulders.

In his hundred years of cultivation, he had met countless people, many exceptional women, yet he had never allowed himself to become attached.

It wasn't for lack of opportunity; it was a conscious choice.

Just as some promises are not made lightly.

Some responsibilities are too difficult to bear.

The Heavenly Corpse Talisman sealed Yagu’s soul.  Qin Sang wasn't sure if he could ever undo it.  Having experienced being a corpse puppet himself, he knew how sinister the talisman was.  If not for the Jade Buddha, a unique artifact, he wouldn't have been able to break free.

But Yagu's plight was directly related to him.  He couldn't just watch her die. Since she had agreed, he would do everything in his power, no matter how slim the chance of success.

The thought of Wu Shang, now a full-fledged corpse puppet in the Cliffless Valley, filled Qin Sang with urgency. Yagu's cultivation was too low; he didn't know how long she could hold on.

Then, to his surprise, he discovered the life force from the Three-Light Jade Liquid was still potent within Yagu, suppressing the corpse energy and protecting her body from the agony of transformation.

Qin Sang's eyes lit up.  There were two major hurdles with the corpse puppet restrictions. One was the prolonged imprisonment of the soul, which could erode its consciousness. The other was the physical transformation into a corpse puppet.  Once the corpse energy infiltrated the body's core, there was no turning back, only the option of seizing another body.

The Three-Light Jade Liquid had solved a major problem.

Immediately, Qin Sang acted, sealing the liquid's medicinal power within Yagu, focusing it solely on combating the corpse transformation and preventing it from being wasted, maximizing its duration.

He then retrieved the Warm Soul Jade from his ring and placed it in Yagu's mouth.

This jade, acquired from Yi Tiannie, could nourish the soul. It was within this jade that Yi Tiannie’s remnant soul had persisted. While not as effective as the Soul Nourishing Wood, one of the Ten Divine Trees, it would still greatly benefit Yagu.

These two artifacts would buy Qin Sang valuable time to research corpse and ghost path techniques and find a way to break the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.

The Wu Clan also excelled in the arts of corpses and ghosts and surely had unique methods.

If he couldn't find a solution in the Vastwave Sea, Qin Sang would have to return to the Small Cold Realm to search for the remnants of the Heavenly Corpse Sect and the second half of the *Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual*.

With this in mind, Qin Sang stood up, his gaze fixed coldly on the Five-Worms Sect.

The Five-Worms Sect… Li Wu Palace…

He had a feeling that the mystery of his teleportation was about to be unravelled.

It was then that Qin Sang remembered the fat silkworm in the insect basket.  It had suddenly become agitated and was still relentlessly gnawing at the basket, but it didn't seem like it was hungry.

Qin Sang was puzzled by its behavior.

He opened the basket, and the silkworm zipped out, heading straight for Yagu in Qin Sang’s arms.

Intrigued, Qin Sang didn't stop it. The silkworm crawled onto Yagu’s hand and gently bit her finger.

A connection of blood and essence.  In that instant, a strange bond formed between the silkworm and Yagu.

“Is this… a spirit insect voluntarily choosing a master?”

Qin Sang was astonished. He hadn't expected such a rare occurrence to happen to Yagu.

Why would the silkworm, upon its first encounter with Yagu, choose her as its master?

Qin Sang recalled that the silkworm had only become agitated after Yagu spoke.  Could it be because of her voice? Was her voice so enchanting that it could captivate a spirit insect?

Qin Sang picked up the silkworm and sensed that it had indeed chosen Yagu as its master, similar to a life-bound insect gu, but with significant differences.

“This little thing wouldn’t have chosen a master just to escape me, would it?”

Qin Sang looked at the silkworm’s shifty little eyes with suspicion.  He found it absurd that Yagu’s voice alone could win over a spirit insect.

He had been tormenting the silkworm with Nine Nether Demonic Fire and depriving it of Redfire Gold. It probably wanted to escape but lacked the power, left to swallow its tears.

Unfortunately, Yagu was asleep.

Qin Sang checked Yagu's condition but found no other changes.

He would have to care for her spirit insect for the time being.

The clever silkworm had outsmarted itself, not only failing to escape but also getting itself tied down.

Qin Sang wrapped the silkworm in Nine Nether Demonic Fire and gave it another lesson.

The silkworm cried out, pleading with its new master for help, but received no response.  Finally, its eyes glazed over in despair as Qin Sang tossed it back into the basket.

Qin Sang learned the location of Yagu’s fight, not far upstream from Thousand Households Village. Not much time had passed.  Yagu’s injuries were severe, and she had been swept away by the raging river.  If not for his swift Sword Qi Thunder Sound Escape, she would truly have been beyond saving.

Traveling upstream, Qin Sang quickly found the battlefield, a barren mountain ridge by the Green-Clothes River.

The Soul-Devouring Cone's explosion had a limited range, and the ridge wasn't significantly damaged.

Qin Sang immediately saw two bodies on the ground and dismembered remains hanging from the surrounding vegetation.

The Tong cultivator was in the worst state, his lower body practically obliterated. Though he had avoided fatal injuries, he hadn't escaped the poisoned needles. The venom had claimed his life.

The other was indeed a stranger. Qin Sang's divine sense detected a faint breath.

He had been poisoned by the Black Jiao yet hadn’t died instantly, though his condition was critical. His skin was almost entirely black and purple. Without an antidote, death was inevitable.

Qin Sang landed beside him and forced an antidote pill into his mouth.

Soon, the poison was neutralized, and the man gradually regained consciousness, seeing a stranger before him.

“You are…”

Qin Sang remained silent, placing a hand on the man’s forehead.

Soul Searching Technique!

Qin Sang feared the man's weakened body wouldn't withstand the pain of the Soul Searching Technique, so he administered the antidote first.

After earth-shattering screams, the man fell silent, lifeless.

Qin Sang withdrew his hand, surprise and killing intent flashing across his face.

…

The Five-Worms Sect was in ruins. Rubble, broken stones, and shattered wood littered the mountain, evidence of a fierce battle.

The sect’s protective formation was activated and, surprisingly, intact.

The bodies of many Five-Worms Sect disciples lay scattered among the debris. The stench of blood was overpowering, staining the ground crimson. No one had come to collect them.
