<h1>Chapter 976:  Inventory</h1><p>Chapter 976:  Inventory</p><p>“Three bone flutes.</p><p>“One from the Xiaohan region, originally belonging to a leopard-like demon.</p><p>“One was unexpectedly purchased in the Demon Sea by a human cultivator from the Canglang Sea.</p><p>“The last one was originally owned by a Biqiu demon beast from the Demon Sea, but it ended up in the Canglang Sea by a twist of fate.”</p><p>Qin Sang played with the bone flutes, recalling the identity of the hooked-nosed man and his own experience with obtaining the *Tianyao Lianxing* scroll, feeling both amused and bewildered.</p><p>The three bone flutes, separated, had appeared in three disparate corners of the cultivation world, sparking endless speculation.</p><p>At this moment, his spirit beast pouch chimed.</p><p>Having sensed the presence of the Nine-Phoenix King earlier, Fei Can had behaved impeccably, not daring to breathe loudly.  Now, safe from danger, Fei Can’s courage had swelled, clamoring for food.</p><p>Qin Sang took Fei Can out.</p><p>Having captured this fellow for over a hundred years, its cultivation had improved remarkably.  Its appearance remained unchanged – one could only say it was identical.</p><p>All it did was sleep and eat.</p><p>Fortunately, it could find its own food and had proven crucial numerous times.  The investment in it had long since paid off.</p><p>Seeing the Toxic Algae Fruit in Qin Sang's other hand, Fei Can’s eyes lit up, struggling vigorously.</p><p>“Looks like I won’t need to refine it into a pill after all…”</p><p>Qin Sang said thankfully, tossing it to Fei Can.</p><p>Fei Can accepted it without ceremony, swallowing the fruit in one gulp. Its mouth swelled for a moment, before it swallowed with difficulty, then, with a round belly, it lay contentedly in Qin Sang's palm, falling asleep.</p><p>Qin Sang envied this carefree existence.</p><p>He stimulated Fei Can with his true energy. Fei Can woke up, angry, squeaking and protesting his bad behavior before promptly falling back asleep.</p><p>“It seems these fruits need to be digested slowly as well. Not sleeping so deeply is a good thing.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, carefully storing the remaining Toxic Algae Fruits.</p><p>Not knowing the properties of the Toxic Algae Fruits, Qin Sang used all the known restrictive methods to prevent any loss of potency.</p><p>The Toxic Algae Fruits weren't his biggest gain.</p><p>With a flash from the Qianjun Ring, several objects landed before Qin Sang: the eighteen Demon Banners and the Soul-Nurturing Wood.</p><p>Seeing the Soul-Nurturing Wood, Qin Sang’s eyes flashed with intense desire.</p><p>He picked up the Soul-Nurturing Wood, pondered for a moment, then channeled his true energy. Following Bai’s instructions, he first carved several tablets from the wood. One he placed on Ya Gu, saving the rest for later use.</p><p>To escape the Nine-Phoenix King, Qin Sang was forced to consume a drop of Three Lights Jade Liquid.  Unexpectedly, his escape was so smooth that unrefined energy still remained within him.  This energy couldn't enhance his cultivation or physical constitution significantly, so he transferred some of its life energy into Ya Gu.</p><p>Ya Gu remained unconscious.  The effects of the Soul-Nurturing Wood were not immediately apparent.</p><p>This large piece of Soul-Nurturing Wood was more than enough to upgrade the Ebony Sword to a top-grade magic treasure.</p><p>Whether it could transform into a spiritual treasure, however, was uncertain.</p><p>Qin Sang had never encountered a spiritual treasure, nor heard of any Nascent Soul master possessing one.  Previously, the Kuiyin Ancestor's ten Demon Banners, comparable in power to top-grade magic treasures, allowed him to control the weather in the Xiaohan region.</p><p>He had seen some vague information in ancient texts, suggesting that the transformation of a magic treasure into a spiritual treasure wasn’t simply a matter of accumulating materials; there were other factors involved.</p><p>Ancient texts detailing the secrets of spiritual treasures, naturally, wouldn't be kept on the Treasure Pagoda Peak of Shaohua Mountain. Unfortunately, he didn't have the opportunity to see them.</p><p>To find out more, he had to find a way to contact those deeply rooted sects.</p><p>Qin Sang remembered that refining a single piece of the Boundless Blood Mulberry took him twenty years.  His cultivation had improved greatly, but refining the Soul-Nurturing Wood would still take some time. During that time, the Ebony Sword would be vulnerable and unusable in combat.</p><p>He couldn't relax yet.  He would deal with reforging the Ebony Sword once things settled down.</p><p>He decided to use some of the Soul-Nurturing Wood to temporarily upgrade the Ebony Sword to a high-grade magic treasure, so as not to hinder his cultivation of the *Yuanshen Yangjian Zhang* (chapter on nurturing sword with primordial spirit). He would continue refining the Soul-Nurturing Wood after breaking through to the late stage of Core Formation.</p><p>Qin Sang made his calculations and split the Soul-Nurturing Wood in two.</p><p>Putting away the Soul-Nurturing Wood, Qin Sang’s gaze fell upon the eighteen Demon Banners.</p><p>“I wonder if the eighteen Demon Banners, when used together, could rival a spiritual treasure?”</p><p>Qin Sang murmured, feeling hopeful.  The Demon Banners were not subject to conventional understanding; the power of the Demon Banner formation depended on the power of the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire.</p><p>Even wielding six banners simultaneously was strenuous.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to focus on mastering the Demon Banners in the near future.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang picked up Elder Zou's belongings, letting out a soft sigh.</p><p>A Ning surname sword cultivator, from the Heavenly Dao Sect…</p><p>Qin Sang clutched the demonic banner, but didn't enter meditation. His eyes were distant, planning what to do after leaving the storm zone.</p><p>Closed-door cultivation to break through was a certainty. His cultivation had stagnated before, but he hadn't stopped studying the Killing Talisman. After refining the Soul-Nourishing Wood, his cultivation would improve rapidly, and breaking through to the late Core Formation stage was imminent.</p><p>Before that, he needed to see the Ning surname sword cultivator.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu asked him to find this person, indicating that this person was close to Senior Qingzhu, possibly a direct disciple, and certainly knew something.</p><p>Asking the Ning surname cultivator about the ancient teleportation array was also indirectly conveying a message to Senior Qingzhu.  Unfortunately, Senior Qingzhu was constrained by the demonic soul's incarnation, unable to condense the crystal pearl and leave any clues behind; otherwise, he could have found a way to rescue Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu was second only to the great cultivators in the Canglang Sea.  The Xiaohan Domain was even weaker; even the Pure Yang Sect's Sect Master was only at the mid-Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>"So Madam Jing is Senior Qingzhu's daughter.  Her real name is Qingjun…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts flashed, remembering Madam Jing.</p><p>More than a hundred years had passed.  He wondered if Madam Jing had eliminated Leng Yuntian and what her current cultivation level was.</p><p>Looking back, Madam Jing was strange.</p><p>She was Senior Qingzhu's daughter, and seemingly avenged Senior Qingzhu by killing Leng Yuntian, yet her attitude towards Senior Qingzhu was very cold.</p><p>When entering the Ziwei Palace, she asked Qin Sang to bring back Senior Qingzhu's body.</p><p>She presented two different faces.  Stunningly beautiful, yet disguised as a low-level cultivator, appearing aged as she walked the mortal world.</p><p>Her cultivation seemed erratic; able to infiltrate Mount Shaohua, visit Dongyang Bo's manor, yet needing help to assassinate Leng Yuntian.</p><p>"She must be skilled in escape techniques. Her strength is probably between Leng Yuntian and Dongyang Bo, most likely early Nascent Soul! But after so long, Madam Jing's cultivation must have improved significantly…"</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Returning to Xiaohan Domain, he definitely needed to find Madam Jing and see her again.</p><p>Firstly, to convey Senior Qingzhu's message, and possibly gain a powerful ally against Dongyang Bo. Secondly, to ask Madam Jing where she saw the Qingluan's image, hoping to see the Qingluan's true form personally.</p><p>Qin Sang had been cultivating the *Heavenly Demon Transformation* technique by visualizing Madam Jing's Qingluan puppet, but felt insecure, knowing the puppet's aura was far inferior to the real thing.</p>
