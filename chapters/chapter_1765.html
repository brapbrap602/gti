<h1>Chapter 1756: Razing the Mountain, Shattering the Temple</h1><p>Shen Huo was a man of passion. Learning that Qin Sang was also a body cultivator, his attitude immediately changed.  He pulled Qin Sang down to sit beside him, grabbed the wine jug on the table, and drained it in one gulp, wiping the liquor from his lips. He’d intended to clap Qin Sang on the shoulder, but for some reason changed his mind mid-gesture, slamming his hand on the table instead. "They say we Dragon and Tiger Altar cultivators are barbarians! They don't understand, all that messing with troops and formations, how can it compare to the sheer thrill of knocking someone down with a single punch!  Just for upholding the Dragon and Tiger Altar, Daoist Qingfeng, I believe in you!"</p><p>Shi Xuan also drank a cup, smiling wryly to himself.  He and Shen Huo had known each other for many years and understood his temperament; he considered anyone who shared his path a kindred spirit.</p><p>The smile on Qin Sang’s face didn't waver. He raised his cup in acknowledgement, emptying it in a single draught.</p><p>According to his investigations, the Dragon and Tiger Altar and the Troop and Formation Altar represented different schools of cultivation within this world's Daoist tradition.</p><p>Besides these, there was also the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>The Troop and Formation Altar was easy to understand. Daoists summoned and nurtured spirit troops, not only to deploy formations and become a one-man army, but also to unify the spirit troops' consciousness, collectively storing divine intent, thereby benefiting their cultivation.</p><p>The Daoist tradition referred to this as the Troop and Formation Secured Altar, and it was considered the orthodox path.</p><p>However, not every Daoist possessed the ability to nurture spirit troops.</p><p>Those from renowned sects or the two courts of the Daoist Authority had access to sect-reared spirit soldiers, allocated to them by their masters when they received their precepts.</p><p>Spirit soldiers born and raised within the sect were utterly loyal to their masters, requiring no special training to obey commands.</p><p>Those without allocated spirit soldiers had to personally venture out to subdue demons and gather troops.</p><p>Setting aside the matter of whether one possessed the ability to subdue demons, even finding spirit troops that resonated with oneself required a significant investment of time and effort.</p><p>Spirit troops subdued in this manner were known as the Five Rampaging Troops.</p><p>As the name suggested, they were unruly and wild, initially nothing more than a disorganized mob. Untrained, they would not obey commands. Even after being tamed, they required constant appeasement and offerings.</p><p>Rebellions and Altar Shattering incidents often stemmed from this type of troop. Even True Persons of the Danshao Prefecture had fallen victim, highlighting the inherent difficulty.</p><p>Nevertheless, once spirit troops were properly cultivated, they not only enhanced one's cultivation but also, when deployed on the battlefield, unleashed formations, talismans, and incantations of immense power. The drawback was the deep connection between the cultivator and their troops. If the troops suffered losses, there was a risk of the Altar being destabilized.</p><p>There was another path that didn't involve nurturing spirit troops.</p><p>By gathering few or no spirit troops and instead utilizing external forces like Heavenly Treasures to solidify the Altar, as the Daoist cultivated, the Altar and their spirit would fuse into a Seal, forming a true Golden Seal.</p><p>The Daoist tradition referred to this as the Golden Seal Secured Altar.</p><p>Except for the two resource-rich courts of the Daoist Authority, other sects could only nurture a limited number of spirit soldiers. Aside from their core disciples, most cultivators pursued the Golden Seal Altar. However, finding Heavenly Treasures to cast the Altar was no easy feat.</p><p>Qin Sang had yet to witness a Golden Seal Altar cultivator in action and didn't know how they performed.</p><p>It was said that the two paths weren't mutually exclusive, and many cultivated both.</p><p>Whether it was the Troop and Formation Secured Altar or the Heavenly Treasure Cast Altar, the purpose was to forge a stable Spiritual Altar, using the Altar to secure the spirit and serve as a vessel for storing divine intent.</p><p>The Altar stabilized vital energy, while the Guardian Spirit protected the mind.</p><p>The third school was the Dragon and Tiger Altar, which focused on tempering the physical body, interweaving vital energy and blood until they manifested as Dragon and Tiger forces, hence the name.</p><p>Cultivators of the Dragon and Tiger Altar were no longer afraid of the Six Heavenly Ancient Qi, even deliberately utilizing it to temper their physique. However, they still needed to cultivate their Altar, condense the Seal, and contemplate their Guardian Spirit.</p><p>Regardless of the school, storing divine intent was essential for peaceful cultivation in this world.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang couldn't help but recall the Serpent Demon in his spirit beast pouch. The demon cultivation practiced by the Serpent Demon felt strikingly similar to the Daoist Dragon and Tiger Altar. The only difference lay in the object of their contemplation.</p><p>Detecting a hint of resentment in Shen Huo's tone, Qin Sang quickly guessed the reason.</p><p>It aligned with the information he had gathered. The prevailing attitude within the Daoist tradition regarded the Troop and Formation Altar as superior and the Dragon and Tiger Altar as inferior, giving rise to the derogatory term 'barbarian's path.'</p><p>"Six Heavenly Ancient Qi is everywhere. Those furry and horned beasts thrive in it. How long are we going to let them have all the glory, while we struggle to pacify the Demon Kingdom and cleanse the demonic taint?  Since we are born in this world, we should adapt to its nature. Yet, everyone remains stubbornly clinging to outdated practices!"</p><p>Shen Huo fumed, glaring at Shi Xuan and his sister, including his two friends in his condemnation.  He didn't believe in the so-called orthodox Daoist path; he firmly believed the Dragon and Tiger Altar was the true way.</p><p>His voice, unmuted, carried outside and reached the ears of several other Daoists, who also felt indignant but dared not argue with Shen Huo, given his cultivation and the combat prowess he'd demonstrated earlier.</p><p>Luo Yin puffed out her cheeks in anger but couldn't think of a rebuttal.</p><p>Shi Xuan let out a wry chuckle and ordered someone to bring a large jug of fine wine, pushing it towards Shen Huo, hoping to silence him with drink.</p><p>"Demon cultivators are naturally gifted, inherently suited for physical cultivation. We humans lack special bloodlines and are physically frail. Is cultivating the Dragon and Tiger Altar truly easier than other paths? Brother Shen and Daoist Qingfeng should know better than us, having faced countless hardships and dangers in their cultivation."</p><p>Noticing Shi Xuan’s gaze, Qin Sang nodded slightly but showed no intention of joining the argument.</p><p>Disappointed, Shi Xuan could only try to appease Shen Huo on his own. He talked until his mouth went dry, only to be silenced by a single sentence from Shen Huo.</p><p>"You all swear that when your cultivation reaches its peak, you can summon celestial soldiers and generals, enlist them as your elite spirit troops, and borrow the power of deities to enhance your talismans and incantations.  Where are these deities now? You spend your days submitting memorials and performing rituals, have you ever received a response? Aren’t you all the same as us, relying on a single Guardian Spirit?"</p><p>Shen Huo’s face was filled with disdain. Shi Xuan sighed deeply, shaking his head repeatedly, too weary to argue.</p><p>Shen Huo turned to speak with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had already discerned that while Shen Huo appeared rough and boisterous, he was actually quite shrewd. He avoided discussing true secrets, never revealing anything of importance.  It would be a grave mistake to assume one could truly confide in him.</p><p>However, Shen Huo was ultimately no match for Qin Sang’s cunning. Without revealing his own hand, Qin Sang gleaned quite a bit of useful information, particularly gaining a deeper understanding of Jushan Region.</p><p>Shen Huo had spent many years roaming Jushan Region, where he had befriended Shi Xuan and his sister.</p><p>Jushan Region, situated between the Daoist Authority and the Ghostfang Kingdom, had long been a battleground for the two powers.</p><p>Yet, after years of continuous warfare, neither side had managed to drive the other out of Jushan Region. Instead, they were both deeply mired in the quagmire of war, fostering a blood feud that eliminated any possibility of reconciliation.</p><p>In recent years, the Daoist Authority and the Demon and Ghost Kingdoms had been in a period of truce, recuperating and rebuilding their strength. But Shen Huo claimed this respite wouldn't last; both sides were undoubtedly preparing for war.</p><p>History suggested that even if the Daoist Authority reclaimed Jushan Region, the war wouldn't end, and vice versa.</p><p>Even during the truce, Jushan Region wasn't free from bloodshed.</p><p>Both sides maintained their troops there, engaging in constant covert conflicts.  Summons, meritorious deeds, and the like arose in response to this situation.</p><p>However, unlike the heartland of the Daoist Authority, another power existed in Jushan Region, known as the Yintian Palace, said to rival the two courts of the Daoist Authority.</p><p>Speaking of the Yintian Palace, Shen Huo couldn’t help but express his admiration. "I admire the Daoists of the Yintian Palace the most.  Rooted in Jushan Region, they dedicate themselves to vanquishing demons and slaying monsters, never seeking comfort or pleasure, spending their days battling demonic forces!"</p><p>Its full name was the Zhoujue Yintian Palace, commonly referred to as the Yintian Palace.  Its name was derived from the Six Heavenly Palaces in Daoist legends.</p><p>Legend had it that the Northern Emperor ruled the酆都冥京, the axis of the Nine Netherworlds, where he established Six Heavenly Palaces. The Zhoujue Yintian Palace was the first of these palaces.</p><p>Qin Sang had heard of the Yintian Palace before, and upon hearing Shen Huo mention it, he listened attentively.</p><p>For Qin Sang, the more factions in Jushan Region, the better. The more chaotic the situation, the easier it would be to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>The group chatted and laughed as the official ship passed through several checkpoints.</p><p>Shi Xuan and the other two didn't mention the contents of the summon, and Qin Sang didn't inquire.</p><p>After becoming more acquainted, they briefly exchanged information about their respective abilities to facilitate future cooperation.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally presented himself as a body cultivator, whose power resided solely within himself.</p><p>When they reached the last fortress on the river, the official ship dared not proceed further. By this point, only the four of them and the ship's crew remained.</p><p>“The journey ahead is treacherous. Be careful, everyone.”</p><p>Shi Xuan was the first to rise and step out of the cabin.</p><p>Possessing cultivation, Qin Sang and the others followed Shi Xuan, leaping into the air and flying across the river.  They sped along the riverbank for a while before landing on solid ground.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, the land ahead was desolate.</p><p>In fact, since they had changed ships, the scenery along both banks of the river had gradually become more dilapidated.</p><p>The Daoist Authority's power was ultimately limited. It couldn't constantly station experts to guard against demon and ghost incursions. When necessary, those territories could be temporarily abandoned.</p><p>The group traversed mountains and valleys, traveling swiftly for several days. Ahead, the mountain ranges stretched endlessly, filled with treacherous terrain and perilous waters.</p><p>Shi Xuan leaped onto a hilltop, surveyed the area, and turned back to warn them, “Conceal your auras. Remember not to fly at high altitudes. Without cover, you’re easily detected by demons and ghosts, who might lay ambushes.”</p><p>This warning was mainly directed at Qin Sang.</p><p>Despite his fiery nature, even Shen Huo didn't show any carelessness at this moment.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn’t expected such caution upon entering Jushan Region.  Upon inquiring, he learned that the Daoist Authority and the Demon and Ghost Kingdoms were in a standoff in central Jushan Region.  That area, garrisoned by Daoist officials and a large army, was the safest.</p><p>These remote areas, on the other hand, were prone to encounters with roaming demon troops from the Ghostfang Kingdom.  Such encounters invariably resulted in life-or-death battles.</p><p>It was kill or be killed!</p><p>Qin Sang readily complied, selecting a random suit of armor from his Thousand Jun Ring.</p><p>Shi Xuan couldn't help but glance at it twice but didn't ask any questions. He gestured for everyone to stop and addressed Qin Sang, “Daoist brother, you have remarkable patience.  I haven't revealed the contents of the summon, yet you've patiently accompanied us this far without asking.”</p><p>Qin Sang smiled faintly. "Since you accepted the summon and invited me, I presume the task won’t exceed my capabilities. I’ll find out when the time comes.  Why waste breath asking?"</p><p>Shen Huo exclaimed in approval.</p><p>Shi Xuan looked at Qin Sang intently. "We're honored by Daoist brother's trust.  However, not all within the Daoist tradition are virtuous. There are also those who commit acts of treachery and murder. The chaotic situation in Jushan Region makes it a haven for such individuals. Even some betray the Daoist Authority and join the Ghostfang Kingdom. Be wary, Daoist brother."</p><p>“Thank you for your kindness, Daoist friend.”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in gratitude.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang showed no arrogance, Shi Xuan nodded inwardly. "To be frank with you, Daoist friend, this summon from the Arctic Demonbane Court tasks us with razing a mountain and shattering a temple, eradicating a few evil deities!"</p><p>"Razing a mountain, shattering a temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly taken aback, instinctively thinking of the mountain and land deities under the Daoist Authority’s jurisdiction.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't yet fully investigated the origins of these local deities. Shi Xuan hailed from the Jiuhua Celestial Cave, and Qin Sang had hoped he might know more.  He'd subtly probed earlier, but even Shi Xuan couldn't explain their origins, only that the mountain and land deities, city gods, and mountain lords were all appointed by the Daoist Authority.</p><p>The legendary celestial soldiers and generals were even more mysterious. As Shen Huo had mentioned, cultivators only knew of Guardian Spirits; no one had witnessed the manifestation of celestial deities.</p><p>Evil deities…</p><p>Qin Sang pondered inwardly.  So, conversely, those appointed by the Daoist Authority were righteous deities.</p><p>He raised his head, surveying the surrounding mountains and rivers.</p><p>Since entering Jushan Region, Qin Sang hadn't detected any trace of mountain or land deities.</p><p>However, Shen Huo had mentioned that in central Jushan Region, within the territory held by the Daoist Authority, there were locally appointed deities who played a significant role in the conflict with the Ghostfang Kingdom.</p><p>As they spoke, Shi Xuan flicked his finger, sending out a speck of yellow light that unfolded before them into a talisman.</p><p>The summon existed in the form of a talisman, containing a brief description of the mission and a rudimentary map.</p><p>The map was very simple, intended only for basic navigation.</p><p>It didn't mark any dangers along the route. Jushan Region was infested with demons and ghosts, and the situation changed constantly. They needed to exercise extreme caution.  Fortunately, their target wasn’t too far.</p><p>“Head east from here, to the vicinity of that evil temple, and then search carefully for the path,” Shen Huo said, pointing broadly forward after reviewing the map.</p><p>Shi Xuan agreed, retrieving the yellow talisman, and urged everyone to depart.</p><p>One month later.</p><p>Their journey had been surprisingly uneventful.</p><p>On a mountain, the four gathered, studying the map to determine their location, finally confirming their target.</p><p>"It's just ahead, less than five hundred li!  What manner of evil deity dares to erect a temple here?  Prepare to face my sword!"</p><p>Shen Huo, his heavy sword slung over his shoulder, charged forward, his killing intent palpable.</p><p>The others followed closely behind.</p><p>As they approached the evil temple, they were surprised to find the ghost inhabitants here were vastly different from those elsewhere. They lived in huts, forming villages.</p><p>They stopped outside one such village, observing that the ghost inhabitants, though still retaining some bestial traits, had learned basic etiquette and cultivated the land around their village.</p><p>In front of the village was a flattened circular plaza, upon which stood a stone statue.</p><p>Although crudely carved, it depicted a creature with the head of a fox and the body of a human.</p><p>Offerings were piled before the statue, indicating the villagers' deep reverence for this creature, offering daily tributes.</p><p>The group exchanged glances, silently bypassing the village and continuing onward until they reached a steep mountain peak.</p><p>Even from the foot of the mountain, they could see a temple perched on the cliff above, gleaming golden in the morning sun, but with wisps of smoke perpetually swirling around it.</p><p>Qin Sang had initially thought the evil deity might be some unique being, but he sensed only demonic energy emanating from the temple.</p><p>Moreover, the demonic energy in the mountain converged into a single stream, suggesting a considerable number of demons within.</p><p>Shen Huo could no longer contain himself.  After observing the energy for a moment, he stomped his foot heavily, bones cracking throughout his body. He silently formed a hand seal, his body suddenly swelling until he transformed into a giant several zhang tall.</p><p>His already strained Daoist robe burst apart, revealing a suit of iron armor.</p><p>With a broad face and wide ears, Shen Huo hefted his heavy sword and leaped upwards, roaring,</p><p>"Your Daoist Grandpa is here!"</p><p>At the same time, Shi Xuan and Luo Yin also sprang into action.</p><p>Qin Sang's attention was fixed on Shi Xuan, a cultivator of the Golden Seal Altar.</p><p>As Shi Xuan ascended, spiritual light flickered before him, revealing a blue Spiritual Altar, smaller than a typical Troop and Formation Altar, with a more condensed Seal within.</p><p>With a flick of his wrist, a streak of light shot out from the Seal, transforming into a talisman mid-air.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
