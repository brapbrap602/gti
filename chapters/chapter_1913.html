<h1>Chapter 1904 The Dharma Body</h1><p>Upon receiving the token, Qin Sang sensed a subtle fluctuation, a very concealed restriction.  Even a Yuan Ying cultivator might overlook it if not careful.  The token seemed to be part of some formation, but its function was difficult to determine from the token alone.  Its use as a token likely stemmed from its ability to resonate with the formation when nearby.  Qin Sang guessed that the boy and his father hadn't discovered, or fully understood, the token's unusual nature; they knew what it was, but not how it worked.</p><p>This piqued Qin Sang's interest.  He decided to keep it, and said to the guard captain standing nearby, "Please, friend, make another trip. Fetch a Huanli Stone and a top-quality water-attribute magical treasure."</p><p>The boy, sweat beading on his forehead from nervousness, felt his wish fulfilled. His taut nerves relaxed abruptly, and he nearly collapsed.</p><p>The guard captain hesitated, but ultimately accepted the spirit stones and obeyed the order.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully questioned the boy about various details. The boy, now without any further concealment, answered everything truthfully.  After a lengthy exchange, the guard captain returned to Fudi Manor, taking even longer than the previous trip for the Zi Yuan Pills, leaving the boy restless and fidgeting.</p><p>The guard captain placed a jade box and a broad-mouthed square cauldron before Qin Sang. Inside the jade box was a fist-sized, strangely shaped stone, clear as crystal, with what appeared to be a pool of water within.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed something unusual and sent a voice transmission asking for an explanation. The guard captain explained that Huanli Stones weren't particularly valuable, but were quite rare in Yundu Mountain; it would be difficult for others to find one of this quality.</p><p>"They're all yours. Take them," Qin Sang gestured for the boy to take the items on the table.</p><p>The boy's hands trembled slightly as he picked up the Huanli Stone, even more excited than when he received the Zi Yuan Pills.</p><p>Still so young!  The three present were all experienced individuals; the boy's actions didn’t escape their notice.  It was clear to them that the Zi Yuan Pills might have been a diversion—the Huanli Stone was his real target.  The boy certainly had more secrets!</p><p>"I haven't heard of any special uses for Huanli Stones," Lu Guanshi thought, but seeing Qin Sang unconcerned, engrossed in the golden register, and the guard captain standing respectfully, he abandoned his suspicions. He ordered a servant girl to escort the boy away.</p><p>Qin Sang then selected several cave dwellings from the register before leaving Fudi Manor. He didn't let the guard captain follow and instead wandered the city, interacting with various cultivators of Yundu Mountain.</p><p>Except for the Fuyao Realm, the sights, people, and customs of the Greater World were vastly different from the Storm Realm.  One word to describe it: abundant!</p><p>Perhaps because of this, perhaps due to Yundu Tian's wise governance, Yundu cultivators didn't exhibit much hostility.  At the Golden Core stage and below, the Greater World held a distinct advantage.  Here, cultivating with dual spiritual roots was not significantly harder than cultivating with heaven-grade spiritual roots in the Storm Realm.</p><p>Of course, heaven-grade spiritual roots lacked bottlenecks when breaking through to the Golden Core stage, a gap dual spiritual roots couldn't bridge.</p><p>If he had been sent to the Greater World by the Jade Buddha back then, he might not have had to sell himself to establish his foundation, but he would have missed those thrilling experiences and opportunities.</p><p>Musing to himself, Qin Sang strolled through the city before returning to the sixth-floor hall.</p><p>Qin Sang remained in Yunding City for almost a year, during which he met the city lord.  Once the first batch of Yinghua Pills was refined, he took the pills and left Yunding City.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving the city, Qin Sang retraced his steps, flew out of the Yundu Mountain range, and continued westward. Gradually, he began to see human villages.</p><p>After flying over several countries, Qin Sang circled slightly above a perilous peak before descending swiftly. The mountain was surrounded by sheer cliffs, impassable even for monkeys.  Several levels existed on the mountainside, each with houses and pavilions.  The closer to the summit, the grander the structures, culminating in a palace at the top, reminiscent of an earthly emperor's palace; magnificent, yet lacking serenity.</p><p>Yet, despite the opulence, the palace felt devoid of life, like an empty house.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't conceal his aura.  As soon as he landed, a figure in a grey robe ascended from a palace at the summit, revealing an elderly man.</p><p>An old man hovered at the edge of the protective mountain array above the palace.  Seeing a stranger, he cupped his hands and asked, "Excuse me, esteemed cultivator, what brings you to our humble abode? Are you perhaps acquainted with any of our elders from North Mountain Sect?"</p><p>Qin Sang flicked his sleeve, revealing a token from the Blissful Abode, and surveyed the mountain below. "It seems your sect has relocated?"</p><p>Recognizing the token, the old man understood Qin Sang's purpose and his tone softened. "Indeed! You must have learned of this from the Blissful Abode.  I needn't elaborate... if you wish to purchase it, you can take possession of this cultivation site immediately!"</p><p>Qin Sang questioned, "Complete sect relocations are rare.  Is there some troublesome karmic entanglement with this place?"</p><p>The old man shook his head repeatedly. "Our sect master was fortunate enough to obtain a cultivation site in Cloud City, Cloud Summit Mountain, which is why we moved there.  You can easily verify this by inquiring in Cloud City."</p><p>While talking, Qin Sang silently sensed the flow of spiritual veins in this mountain and the surrounding ranges.  He could now clearly perceive even minor underground veins.</p><p>This cultivation site was quite good, sufficient for a sect of cultivators up to the Nascent Soul stage. He would have purchased it already if North Mountain Sect hadn't asked such a high price.  Furthermore, the mountain's seclusion made it ideal for Qin Sang's secluded cultivation.</p><p>Qin Sang visualized the surrounding spiritual veins. The quality of a cave abode or cultivation site is closely linked to the owner's abilities. North Mountain Sect's protective array was too crude, failing to utilize the site's full potential.</p><p>Geomancy and feng shui are significant disciplines in the cultivation world.  With proper arrangement and excellent earth-vein manipulation techniques, a cultivation site could even improve year by year, achieving a 'dragon-raising' effect.</p><p>Qin Sang, a former sect master himself, was well-versed in this art.  If he personally set up a grand array, shifted spiritual veins, and incorporated the spiritual essence of the surrounding mountains, he could elevate this place to accommodate even a Transformation stage cultivator.</p><p>However, this would be too conspicuous, and the site's foundation was insufficient. Even at its best, it could only solidify the foundation; true cultivation would require a different location.  This was merely a second-best option.</p><p>After a brief conversation with the old man, Qin Sang bid farewell and departed.  This was the only suitable location he had found within the mortal realm.</p><p>Leaving North Mountain Sect, he soared north, the cities and rivers below receding at an astonishing pace.  Gradually, human settlements thinned out, and Qin Sang sensed a wave of intense heat emanating from ahead.</p><p>Besides the youth's location, Qin Sang had also selected two cave abodes in the north, and the rest were in the Duskfall Mountain Range. The scenery here was vastly different from Cloud Summit Mountain.</p><p>Soon after leaving the mortal realm, Qin Sang saw a towering pillar of fire, with scalding magma constantly erupting, and billowing black smoke obscuring the sky.</p><p>The earth wasn't entirely occupied by the raging fire veins, but the intense heat rendered the area desolate, filled with barren mountains and desert wastelands. Mortals couldn't possibly survive here.</p><p>The fire spiritual energy here was incredibly abundant. For those who could withstand the extraordinarily volatile spiritual energy, it was a sacred site for fire cultivation techniques.</p><p>The further north he flew, the more desolate it became.  Rivers of magma crisscrossed the land, and volcanic eruptions were frequent.  It wasn't far from the storm belt between the Central Plains and the Western Territories.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang found his first target: a cave abode nestled within a dormant volcano.  Its owner, a Nascent Soul cultivator, was exceptionally welcoming, praising the cave abode lavishly, and expressing deep regret at having to sell it for the sake of obtaining pills.</p><p>His acting was impeccable, almost flawless, and his asking price wasn't high.  Unfortunately, Qin Sang saw through it instantly.  The cave abode's actual quality fell far short of his boasts; a special array created the illusion.</p><p>For a respected Nascent Soul cultivator to resort to such deceit was contemptible.  Had the cultivator possessed malicious intent to harm or rob, Qin Sang's punishment would have been far harsher.</p><p>At the next location, Qin Sang couldn't find the cave abode. After circling the area, he finally discerned the reason. This place had once been a crucial point for several large fire veins. The signs suggested a recent eruption.</p><p>The owner likely sensed the fire vein's instability, knowing the cave abode wouldn't last, and abandoned it, attempting to make a quick profit before leaving—virtually no different from attempted robbery and murder.</p><p>"The world has lost its integrity!" Qin Sang shook his head, lamenting the situation.  Judging from the remaining traces, this location was still a prime choice.  If he had arrived earlier, he could have suppressed the fire veins.</p><p>"Hopefully, the next one won't disappoint me…"  Qin Sang determined his direction, flew westward over three thousand li, and held up his token, quickly establishing a connection.</p><p>Following the instructions, Qin Sang landed beside a lava river.</p><p>The lava in the river had dried up, leaving behind a bed of black volcanic rock, with cracks faintly glowing red.</p><p>The target was underground.</p><p>Standing there, Qin Sang could sense a sea of magma deep beneath the earth, with numerous fire spirits frolicking within, some even at the Yuan Ying stage.  Unless his father could summon a Yuan Ying cultivator, clearing out so many fire spirits would be impossible.  The best they could do would be to avoid detection and sneak in.</p><p>Qin Sang carefully sensed the area.</p><p>"It's still at the bottom of the magma..."</p><p>He was about to pass through a crack when he suddenly stopped.  His figure flickered, and a brilliant light appeared above his head. A wave of pure energy surged upward, pausing in mid-air before transforming into a human figure.</p><p>This person, with features identical to Qin Sang's, was his Dharma body.</p><p>When he broke through to the Lianxu stage, Qin Sang took an unconventional path, and he hadn't yet fully grasped the advantages of his Dharma body.</p><p>Solidifying his cultivation included re-examining his breakthrough process and understanding those overlooked insights.</p><p>Qin Sang's physical body looked up, his Dharma body looked down; four eyes met, seeing only themselves, a peculiar sensation.</p><p>The Dharma body, formed from a Lianxu cultivator's essence, could be considered a kind of nascent Yuan Ying.</p><p>Recalling his breakthrough,</p><p>At the moment he pierced the final barrier, the Yuan Ying within him suddenly expanded to the size of a person, thus drawing on the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and his understanding of the Dao reached a new level.</p><p>The Dharma body's separation was like a Yuan Ying leaving the body, but it was not as fragile.</p><p>The Dharma body draws on the cultivator's essence and manipulates the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.  Even without the soul leaving the body, spiritual awareness can extend without hindrance, allowing him to cast spells, wield magical treasures, and fight enemies as if his true body were present.</p><p>Thus, a cultivator need not reveal himself; he can summon his Dharma body to fight, while remaining hidden, undetectable to his enemies!</p><p>If the Dharma body is damaged, it only needs to return to the main body for a period of cultivation to fully recover.</p><p>However, it's not without risk. If the Dharma body is destroyed, the cultivator, even if he doesn't die, will suffer grievous damage to his foundation, enduring unimaginable pain.</p><p>However, if the cultivator senses that the Dharma body will be destroyed, within a certain range, he can directly use the "return to source" technique to dispel the Dharma body and return to his true form, thus avoiding disaster.</p><p>This technique actually manifested back in the Yuan Ying stage as the Yuan Ying's teleportation ability.</p><p>Qin Sang had experimented. With his current abilities, his "return to source" range was a thousand li, and this would extend further as his foundation solidified.</p><p>Thus, it's evident that killing a Lianxu cultivator is no easy feat.</p><p>Beyond that, the Dharma body's uses are limitless, and it is ideally suited for scouting.</p><p>This place wasn't dangerous enough to warrant such caution; this was more for familiarizing himself with the Dharma body.</p><p>His true body slipped into a crack and sat cross-legged.</p><p>The Dharma body raised its hands, examining itself for a moment. A Sky-Eye Butterfly landed on its shoulder.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Snow fell.</p><p>The surrounding temperature dropped sharply.</p><p>The Dharma body, holding the Four-Serpent Seal, released four serpent-shaped ornaments which moved playfully in its palm.</p><p>The Dharma body gathered the cold air, holding it in its hand like a snowfield, and passed through the fissure into the earth.</p><p>The next moment, the view was filled with blinding red light, and intense heat washed over it.</p><p>The fire spirits were still playing, completely unaware of the uninvited guest.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't bother clearing out the fire spirits. After a brief observation, the Dharma body sank into the magma.</p><p>The feeling of magma flowing around it was exceptionally clear, no different from being there in his true body.</p><p>Even after sinking a hundred li, it hadn't reached the bottom.</p><p>Meanwhile, the token in the Dharma body's hand grew hotter, brighter even than the magma itself.</p><p>The Dharma body raised a finger, lightly touching the token.</p><p>The token hummed, and a rune, red as fire, appeared at its center.</p><p>The firelight within the rune flowed, slowly pointing in a direction.</p><p>"There!"</p><p>The Dharma body flew in that direction. After another fifty li, the token vibrated more intensely, as if trying to break free and return to its source.</p><p>Here, Qin Sang and the Sky-Eye Butterfly detected an anomaly below.</p><p>As Qin Sang predicted, there was an ancient array.</p><p>“Hmm? This array seems rather complex, but…”</p><p>The Dharma body’s gaze swept across, moving diagonally a hundred meters forward, then suddenly stopped, pressing its palm downwards.</p><p>With the Dharma body as the boundary, a break appeared in the magma. The lower magma pressed down, as if a barrier held up the hundred-li-thick layer of magma above.</p><p>Soon, unusual red glows and strange outlines appeared on the surface of the lower magma.</p><p>Taking it all in, the Dharma body shook its head slightly, "Indeed, it's an ancient array, but unfortunately…"</p><p>Finding an ancient array is cause for celebration; with good luck, one might obtain the legacy and treasures of ancient cultivators.</p><p>Unfortunately, this array was damaged, greatly diminishing its value.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's goal was to find the cave, so he wasn't disappointed. He chose a weak point and slipped into the array.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I was away for a while, so I’m back late.</p>
