<h1>Chapter 523: Success</h1><p>A short while later.</p><p>Shi Ying regained her composure and once again sliced off a sliver of Azure Yang Divine罡, sending it into Qin Sang's Qi Sea.</p><p>This time, Qin Sang's strategy changed. He attempted to urge his spiritual power to mask the aura of the Earthly Yin Qi. Although he still failed, the situation was much better than before.</p><p>Qin Sang and Shi Ying were both less tense, calmly accepting the failure. After adjusting their breath, they continued to try.</p><p>Soon, the Azure Yang Divine罡 that Shi Ying had gathered was exhausted.</p><p>A whole night passed.</p><p>Shi Ying had gone to Divine罡 Peak twice more, but still hadn't even attempted the罡-Yin Pill Fusion, because to achieve the罡-Yin Pill Fusion, one must first allow the Azure Yang Divine罡 and the Earthly Yin Qi to coexist within the Qi Sea, and then use them together to impact the Golden Core.</p><p>After Shi Ying recovered through meditation, she rose and left the cave, returning to Divine罡 Peak.</p><p>After she left, Qin Sang opened his eyes.</p><p>That night, besides attempting the secret technique and making adjustments, he listened to Shi Ying recount her story.</p><p>Shi Ying's original name was Lan Ying. Her parents were rogue cultivators, but their cultivation wasn't low. Her father came from a cultivation family. Although the family had declined, their resources were still more abundant than those of ordinary cultivators. Both her parents successfully established their foundation.</p><p>After Shi Ying was born, she was naturally deficient in Yuan Qi. Upon examination, it was discovered that she had a hidden illness. As she grew older, the hidden illness would affect her more and more severely.</p><p>Her parents learned that there was a spiritual herb on the second level of the Boundless Valley that could cure Shi Ying's illness. Not long after she was born, her parents entrusted a friend to care for her and ventured into the Boundless Valley with others to gather the herb.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they never returned, both perishing within the Boundless Valley.</p><p>Her parents' friend realized something was wrong and immediately took Shi Ying far away, changing their names and adopting Shi Ying as their own daughter, changing her surname to Shi.</p><p>Shi Ying's adoptive mother treated her as her own daughter and, at great risk, entered the Boundless Valley to gather the spiritual herbs needed to cure Shi Ying's illness. She also discovered the identity of her parents' killer: Wen Yanjie, the person who had accompanied them into the Boundless Valley.</p><p>This person coveted the Lan family's inherited magical artifact and plotted to murder Mr. and Mrs. Lan.</p><p>Although the Azure Yang Demonic Sect bore the name of a demonic sect, its disciples' actions weren't necessarily vicious. Mr. and Mrs. Lan didn't have much defense against Wen Yanjie and both perished.</p><p>After discovering the truth, Shi Ying's adoptive mother attempted to avenge her friends, but the assassination failed, and she too died at Wen Yanjie's hands.</p><p>The vengeance Shi Ying spoke of was not only for her birth parents but also for the adoptive mother who had raised her with painstaking care.</p><p>By then, Shi Ying's adoptive mother had managed to send her into the Azure Yang Demonic Sect.</p><p>From the moment she entered, the twelve-year-old Shi Ying had only revenge in her heart. Yet, she could only watch helplessly as her enemy, relying on treasures obtained through murder and robbery, advanced smoothly, his cultivation growing ever higher.</p><p>As the saying goes, "Ill-gotten gains bring prosperity."</p><p>The gap between the two grew wider and wider, like a chasm!</p><p>Shi Ying felt immense despair and pain, with nowhere to vent. When she went to pay respects at the graves of her parents and adoptive mother, she wept bitterly before their tombs.</p><p>If not for this tragedy, Shi Ying would have been a very talkative person. It was the burden of blood feud that suppressed her true nature.</p><p>…</p><p>The stone door was pushed open from the outside, and Shi Ying returned.</p><p>She was much faster this time. In less than a quarter of an hour, she successfully gathered a sliver of Azure Yang Divine罡.</p><p>"Four trips to Divine罡 Peak in less than a day. If Master Uncle finds out, he'll definitely be suspicious…"</p><p>Shi Ying looked anxious. Cultivating Azure Yang Demonic Fire didn't require such frequent trips into the mountains.</p><p>The reason she risked entering the mountains was that she noticed the time seemed to be getting longer each time, and the situation was gradually improving. Perhaps this time, they would succeed.</p><p>However, if she failed again, she would have to wait two days before trying again.</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang wasn't anxious. He had a clue. This time, he was confident he could make the two coexist. Next, it depended on whether the idea of the罡-Yin Pill Fusion would work.</p><p>The man and the corpse sat facing each other.</p><p>The Azure Yang Divine罡 entered Qin Sang's body.</p><p>The moment Shi Ying withdrew the Azure Yang Demonic Fire, Qin Sang used all his power to seal the aura of the Earthly Yin Qi. At the same time, he released a strand of Earthly Yin Qi, about the same size, and controlled it as it rushed towards his Golden Core.</p><p>This wasn't Qin Sang's own action; it was also accompanied by Shi Ying's intent.</p><p>The reason for the delay until now was that Qin Sang had been subtly guiding, patiently showing signs of improvement, and discreetly "pointing" Shi Ying onto the correct path.</p><p>Before confirming the result, he didn't want to expose himself, so he couldn't let Shi Ying sense any discord.</p><p>From Shi Ying's perspective, she was in control, but in reality, Qin Sang was at the helm.</p><p>As soon as the Earthly Yin Qi appeared, it was sensed by the Azure Yang Divine罡.</p><p>The Azure Yang Divine罡 swayed like a spirit snake, chasing after the Earthly Yin Qi. The two grew closer and closer to the Golden Core, almost reaching it simultaneously. They were about to collide and explode.</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang suddenly urged his spiritual power with all his might, enveloping the two auras.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The conflict between the two auras didn't cease, but Qin Sang, at the cost of consuming his spiritual power, actually delayed their explosion. Then, without hesitation, he wrapped them and slammed them into the Golden Core.</p><p>Combined with the Azure Yang Divine罡, the destructive power of the Earthly Yin Qi was far greater than the Earthly Yin Qi alone.</p><p>Although the Golden Core was strong, it was an unowned object. With their power concentrated to the extreme by Qin Sang, they actually broke through the surface power of the Golden Core and made contact with it.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Divine light radiated from the Golden Core.</p><p>The Qi Sea trembled violently!</p><p>Shi Ying's face turned pale. She realized that her divine sense had been instantly shattered by the enormous waves. Without hesitation, she quickly regained control of the corpse, but could only focus on stabilizing his Qi Sea, anxiously awaiting the result.</p><p>Unaware, at that moment, a transparent spirit sword quietly appeared above the Golden Core.</p><p>Sword Qi gathered into a single stream, enveloping the Golden Core.</p><p>Learning from his last experience refining the Flying Celestial Yaksha, Qin Sang summoned the Ebony Sword, adding a layer of protection, regardless of whether it would truly be effective.</p><p>Earthly Yin Qi, Azure Yang Divine罡, Golden Core…</p><p>Three powerful forces collided, using the Golden Core as their battlefield, erupting with astonishing fluctuations.</p><p>However, these fluctuations came and went quickly.</p><p>Because the Earthly Yin Qi and the Azure Yang Divine罡 were too small, they were no match for the Golden Core and quickly dissipated.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the turbulence subsided, and the Golden Core and Qi Sea returned to normal.</p><p>Shi Ying gasped for breath. Seeing that Qin Sang's Qi Sea had stabilized, her worried heart finally settled. She carefully observed the Golden Core again, but seeing no change, she couldn't help but feel disappointed. After a brief adjustment, she mustered her spirits and tried again.</p><p>The third time…</p><p>The fourth time…</p><p>The Azure Yang Divine罡 was exhausted again. Shi Ying sighed deeply and entered meditative cultivation.</p><p>Just then, Qin Sang suddenly opened his eyes. A sharp glint flickered in his black pupils, and he vanished from the spot.</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang silently appeared behind Shi Ying, extending a hand and striking her with a restrictive spell.</p><p>Shi Ying's body went limp, and she collapsed to the ground. Qin Sang helped her onto the bed.</p><p>Qin Sang straightened up, looking towards Divine罡 Peak, a faint smile on his face. He finally saw signs of success!</p>
