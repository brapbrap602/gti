<h1>Chapter 1928: The Indestructible Bone</h1><p>“What kind of creature is a Ghost Cloud Steed?” Vermillion Bird had never heard of such a Demonic Beast. Recalling that Luo Hou was still in her spirit form, it suddenly dawned on her, “You want to possess it?”</p><p>Luo Hou had been crippled by Qin Sang years ago and hadn't found a suitable physical body. She herself was unwilling to settle for less, thus delaying it until now.</p><p>Luo Hou neither confirmed nor denied, replying, “The bloodline of the Ghost Cloud Steed has a certain degree of compatibility with my own.”</p><p>If she wanted to possess a body, she didn't have to insist on the Shadow Horse lineage and could choose a similar bloodline as a vessel.</p><p>Luo Hou had several alternatives, and the Ghost Cloud Steed was one of them.</p><p>Luo Hou's expression was clearly hesitant. Firstly, because this Ghost Cloud Steed's bloodline was thin. Secondly, the Ghost Cloud Steed wasn't the best choice, only a mediocre one.</p><p>However, the Demonic races chosen by Luo Hou, including the Ghost Cloud Steed, were very rare.  It had taken her this long to encounter one.</p><p>There might be better choices in the depths of the Twilight Mountains. She considered herself a defeated general, lucky to have survived and become the guardian spirit beast of the mountain. How could she dare to ask her Master to make a special trip to find her a physical body?</p><p>Moreover, the situation in the Twilight Mountains was complex, filled with Nascent Soul stage powerhouses, dangers lurking everywhere.</p><p>With only her spirit remaining, her strength was greatly diminished. While she was more than capable of dealing with Demonic cultivators like the Purple-Gold Divine雕, facing cultivators of the same realm, she paled in comparison. She wouldn't dare venture into the Twilight Mountains alone.</p><p>Encountering a Ghost Cloud Steed unexpectedly was a small stroke of fortune.</p><p>Possessing the Ghost Cloud Steed, though not as compatible as other Demonic races, held the hope of restoring her to her peak, though it would take more effort.</p><p>If she missed this opportunity, she didn’t know how long she'd have to wait for the next one.  The lack of a physical body was hindering her cultivation, and the sooner she possessed one, the better.</p><p>“Then what are you waiting for? Go, go, go!” Vermillion Bird urged repeatedly, clamoring, “I'll deal with this guy. How dare it call itself the Demonic Emperor in front of this divine bird? I’ll show it what I’m capable of!”</p><p>Vermillion Bird rubbed its claws together, its tone arrogant.</p><p>Luo Hou didn’t move, hesitating, "But, Master, he…"</p><p>“Why worry about that? Could that Qin Sang stop you from taking over a body? He brought you down the mountain to help you recover, didn’t he? Otherwise, why wouldn't he bring that fox?” Vermillion Bird, with its bit of cunning, guessed Luo Hou’s concerns and suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>“Ga ga… You actually believed him? He keeps saying he won’t kill, but isn’t it to help Little Five temper his demonic nature? He didn’t specifically tell us to show mercy when we came down. Do you think that Qin Sang is some inflexible pedant, or do you really think your Master is a great benevolent person?”</p><p>“Ga ga ga ga…”</p><p>Vermillion Bird laughed as if it had heard the biggest joke, clutching its belly.</p><p>Having traveled with Qin Sang, it learned many new and interesting words, like ‘pedant.’</p><p>The laughter reached the Purple-Gold Divine 雕's ears, igniting its fury.</p><p>They were pursuing it, yet they dared to be distracted by conversation and laughter, a blatant humiliation.</p><p>Luo Hou was still hesitant. Since descending the mountain, Qin Sang had been slaying demons and monsters, leaving rivers of blood in his wake. Possessing another being was undoubtedly the act of a demon, even though the Ghost Cloud Steed must have slaughtered many mortals.</p><p>Unlike Vermillion Bird, she didn't have the privilege to ignore Qin Sang's words.</p><p>“Sigh, I didn’t know you were so timid! Just ask Qin Sang if it’s okay or not.  Quickly catch that Ghost Horse before it escapes!”</p><p>Vermillion Bird flapped its wings, condensing a fiery plume that transformed into a crimson streak, piercing the air.</p><p>Luo Hou left the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 to Vermillion Bird and leaped toward the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Vermillion Bird shook its wings, glancing sideways at the enraged Purple-Gold Divine 雕, and let out a sinister chuckle.</p><p>“Your demise is at hand!” Vermillion Bird, having learned more elegant phrases from the mortal world, roared, its entire body ablaze with raging flames as it lunged toward the Purple-Gold Divine 雕.</p><p>“Arrogant!” The Purple-Gold Divine 雕 retorted defiantly, but didn't turn its head.  Still, it was easily caught by Vermillion Bird. As soon as they clashed, it realized something was amiss.</p><p>Vermillion Bird seemed to only possess late Nascent Soul cultivation, equivalent to the Purple-Gold Divine 雕, but it couldn’t be treated like an ordinary Demonic Beast.</p><p>Moreover, the Demonic Emperor had just suffered a blow from Luo Hou and was already injured. It quickly fell into a disadvantage, engulfed by the overwhelming flames.</p><p>With the imperial palace breached and the Demonic Emperor preoccupied, the other Demonic Beasts were disorganized, each fending for themselves. They couldn't mount any significant resistance, retreating steadily. Even escape was a luxury.</p><p>Luo Hou captured the Ghost Cloud Steed, moving like a phantom, clearing the battlefield. The Demonic horde could only surrender.</p><p>The sky above the capital city became the battleground between Vermillion Bird and the Demonic Emperor.</p><p>“No one interfere!” Vermillion Bird's roar echoed from within the flames.  It finally had a chance to fight and intended to enjoy it.</p><p>“Senior Luo, what should we do now?” A cultivator stepped forward.</p><p>Luo Hou gazed for a moment, confirming that the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 couldn't escape. “Let Master Vermillion Bird have his fun. We'll go reinforce elsewhere! Let's go!”</p><p>“Fun?”  The crowd looked at each other in bewilderment.  Facing a late-stage Transformation realm Great Demon and calling it ‘fun’ was simply inconceivable!</p><p>With reinforcements arriving, the other two battlefields were swiftly overwhelmed.</p><p>The three demonic nests were destroyed overnight!</p><p>Finally, the group marched mightily towards the capital of the Myriad Spirits Kingdom.  The battle there wasn't over, but the Purple-Gold Divine 雕 was at its limit.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A blast of crimson fire slammed into the ground like a meteorite, destroying half the imperial palace, shaking the heavens and earth!</p><p>As the flames dispersed, the crowd saw the small Vermillion Bird standing with one foot on the head of the Purple-Gold Divine 雕, which was countless times larger than itself.</p><p>Vermillion Bird preened its feathers, looking down upon everyone.</p><p>Amidst a chorus of flattery, its small head tilted higher and higher, its beak almost touching the sky.</p><p>With Su Xuanzhu and others cleaning up the aftermath, the three demons, their task complete, departed gracefully.</p><p>Vermillion Bird called out to Luo Hou, shaking a fiery plume, “Your Master has already given his permission. Why are you still waiting?  Hurry and possess it.”</p><p>“I'll trouble the two fellow Daoists to protect me!”</p><p>Luo Hou didn't question the truth and, without hesitation, landed on a hilltop with the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Vermillion Bird and Taiyi stood guard on either side.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day at noon, the three demons returned to Taiyi’s cave.</p><p>Qin Sang, who was comprehending the Taiyi Thunderclap Talisman, was somewhat surprised to see Luo Hou. “You found a physical body yourself? This saves me the trouble, as I was planning to make a trip to the Twilight Mountains. Take these pills. Adapt to this body quickly and recover your strength.”</p><p>He tossed a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside were three spiritual pills, all extremely precious. They were obtained from the Demonic King’s relics, specifically refined for Demonic cultivators, greatly beneficial to Luo Hou.</p><p>Luo Hou then realized that Qin Sang had always remembered her situation.  She immediately knelt and kowtowed, gratefully saying, “Thank you, Master, for the pills.”</p><p>“Hee hee, I told you he wouldn’t refuse.  You insisted on asking for permission…” Vermillion Bird hopped onto Luo Hou’s shoulder, smugly.</p><p>“Asking for permission?” Qin Sang looked at Vermillion Bird.</p><p>Vermillion Bird abruptly covered its beak, its eyes darting around, before turning and rushing towards the entrance.  However, a tremendous force yanked it back, causing it to shriek.</p><p>“Luo Hou needs to focus on refining her new body and it's inconvenient for her to be a mount anymore. From now on, you’ll take over.” Qin Sang ignored the screams, raising a finger. Vermillion Bird's flames surged.</p><p>“Master…” Luo Hou opened her mouth, but meeting Qin Sang's gaze, she fell silent.</p><p>Soon after, a crimson-feathered bird flew out of the mountains, carrying everyone on its back towards the sky, leaving behind heart-wrenching cries.</p><p>“Ah! I, the dignified Vermillion Bird!”</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain, Daoist Abode.</p><p>Qin Sang’s true body awakened from meditation, calculated with his fingers, and murmured, “It’s almost time for the agreed meeting with the Cloud Cauldron City Lord.”</p><p>Now that restoring his foundation was no longer a problem, Qin Sang began considering his cultivation priorities.</p><p>Comprehending the Dao of Slaughter was clearly not something to be rushed.</p><p>Seeking the Dao, seeking the Dao… The most important thing was enlightenment and understanding of the Great Dao.  Epiphany referred to this very process.</p><p>His true body venturing out wouldn't be any more effective than his avatar.</p><p>Entrusting it to the avatar, letting it continue to wander the mortal world and seek opportunities from within, might be the best choice.</p><p>What Qin Sang’s true body needed to do was to gain strength matching a Void Refinement cultivator as quickly as possible.</p><p>Various divine abilities and treasures from before Void Refinement, some of them, were now somewhat lacking in power.</p><p>Especially the three devastating Buddhist Seals, which could be said to be his most important means before Void Refinement, were now limited by his physical cultivation.</p><p>Comprehending Thunder Arts wouldn't yield extraordinary results in a short time, unless the Thunder Altar could bring him a pleasant surprise.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>One was to quickly enhance his physical cultivation and break through to the sixth level of the *Heavenly Demonic Body Refinement*.</p><p>The other was to comprehend the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, relying on the *Violet Star Sword Scripture* and Heavenly Crossing Senior’s sword light, to deduce a Sword Domain from the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>Even if he could only grasp a hint of the Sword Domain’s essence, he would have a significant advantage when fighting against Void Refinement cultivators!</p><p>A breakthrough in Sword Dao would undoubtedly bring about a leap in strength, but the difficulty would certainly be immense.</p><p>For over three hundred years, Qin Sang often pondered where he should begin.</p><p>Gradually, he gained some clues and made plans, though he hadn't yet put them to the test.</p><p>Heavenly Crossing Senior’s words back then were also a subtle guidance.</p><p>Evolving the celestial stars with a sword formation. Qin Sang knew the difficulties and didn’t dare to have such grand ambitions for the time being.</p><p>Creating a Celestial Star Sword Formation had to be done step-by-step. He planned to emulate the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation, gradually constructing the Southern Seven Mansions, Eastern Seven Mansions, and Northern Seven Mansions.</p><p>With the Four Symbols complete, he would achieve the Four Symbols Sword Formation!</p><p>Thus, the sword formation could be considered a minor accomplishment. Then, he would evolve the Sun, Moon, and Nine Luminaries, the Three Enclosures of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Supreme Palace Enclosure, and Heavenly Market Enclosure, eventually leading to the completion of the Celestial Star Sword Formation.</p><p>This was a grand plan, and Qin Sang wasn’t certain whether he could complete it within the Void Refinement stage.</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang's mind, recollections of what he had witnessed within the Divine Court.</p><p>There were images of him being pursued by the Demonic King, memories he had recorded of the Western White Tiger Star Region.</p><p>And the moment when he was possessed by the Thunder Ancestor, controlling Heaven and Earth, with the world and the Divine Court beneath his feet.</p><p>This profound imprint on his soul seemed to encompass some impressions of the Divine Court, the Four Star Regions, the Three Enclosures, and the Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions.</p><p>His consciousness was hazy at the time, and he subsequently suffered repeated attacks, unable to calm his mind. The remaining impressions were faint.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't sure how much he could ultimately gain, but if he could truly glean something from it, using the essence of the Divine Court to construct the sword formation would definitely multiply his efforts!</p><p>Compared to directly observing the ethereal celestial stars, this was undoubtedly a shortcut.</p><p>Of course, if he could achieve a breakthrough in the *Heavenly Demonic Body Refinement*, he could also gain formidable combat power through the three Buddhist Seals.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers lightly on his knee.</p><p>He had asked the Cloud Cauldron City Lord in advance to help him collect potent poisons, and the appointed time to retrieve them was approaching.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture* was secondary.  Qin Sang mused that he should focus on comprehending the Dao of Dharma Manifestation. The deeper his understanding, the more naturally he could break through future bottlenecks.</p><p>The Great Dao was different, yet interconnected. He was already a Void Refinement cultivator. With his understanding of the Unity of Heaven and Man, it would be beneficial to comprehend the Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>A fierce wind rose within the cave.</p><p>The Dharma Manifestation was summoned by Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up, gazing at the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation, carefully sensing it.</p><p>Previously, he had received guidance from Senior Zuo, learning about the so-called Inner Scenery and Outer Scenery in body cultivation, yet his understanding remained vague.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had grasped a few truths.</p><p>Void Refinement stage Dharma cultivators manipulated the world’s spiritual energy, focusing on control.</p><p>And the transition from Inner Scenery to Outer Scenery for body cultivators was also the Unity of Heaven and Man, but it pursued integrating Heaven and Earth into oneself, with the self as the core.</p><p>It was like absorbing the power of Heaven and Earth, nourishing oneself, achieving one's own Inner Heaven and Earth, thereby influencing the true Heaven and Earth in return.</p><p>Then what about the Yang Spirit?</p><p>Was it using Heaven and Earth as its root, with the soul actively merging into Heaven and Earth?</p><p>The most extreme choice on this path, was it to abandon the self, merging with Heaven and Earth, existing in unison with them?</p><p>It seemed to have some similarities with the Divine Dao, rooted in the earth's veins or reliant on the worship of incense and fire.</p><p>This thought crossed Qin Sang's mind, reminding him of the Yang Spirit that had attacked him in the Divine Court, its figure like a phantom, completely unfathomable in its movements.</p><p>Did these three different Great Daos represent the three ultimate paths for sentient beings seeking the Dao, and then further differentiate below, giving rise to various Daos?</p><p>These were the results of Qin Sang’s continuous contemplation.</p><p>He knew there must be many errors and omissions, but it didn't matter. As his cultivation progressed, his understanding would gradually refine and he would comprehend the true location of the Dao.</p><p>This process was a journey of seeking the Dao, as well as a transformation and sublimation of himself!</p><p>“Dao! Dao! Dao!”</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the word continuously.</p><p>Facts proved that the higher the realm, the greater the importance of the ‘Dao,’ and the smaller the influence of talent.</p><p>Reaching the Void Refinement stage, who would still care if you were a Five Spiritual Roots cultivator?</p><p>Of course, the speed of comprehending the Great Dao was also a form of talent.</p><p>Some had sudden enlightenment, while others toiled for half their lives.</p><p>“This is comprehension, right? But the level of comprehension certainly can't determine future achievements. It can still be compensated for by external means, gaining enlightenment.”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Azure Phoenix Dharma Manifestation.</p><p>The so-called Dharma Manifestation was an external manifestation of the power of the Inner Heaven and Earth.  With his Void Refinement understanding, his ‘comprehension’ regarding the Dharma Manifestation was naturally unparalleled.</p><p>Qin Sang silently circulated the *Heavenly Demonic Body Refinement*.</p><p>Several days later, the stone gate of the cave opened, and Qin Sang emerged, invigorated.  He instructed Gui Hou to guard the abode and flew out of the Daoist Abode.</p><p>He flew leisurely in the sky, crossing the Fire Domain and arriving at Cloud Capital Mountain, observing the changes below.</p><p>It seemed that over the past two hundred years, Cloud Capital Mountain hadn't changed at all, at least superficially, it was very peaceful.</p><p>Under Cloud Capital Heaven’s governance, Cloud Capital Mountain was able to maintain long-term peace and stability, a blessing for cultivators.</p><p>Cloud Cauldron City.</p><p>Qin Sang only came to the Immortal City once every few decades, but successive guards knew his name.</p><p>Upon entering the city, he was personally escorted by the commander of the guards directly to the topmost level of Cloud Cauldron City.</p><p>The City Lord personally came out to greet him.</p>
