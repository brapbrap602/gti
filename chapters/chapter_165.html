<h1>Chapter 158: Earth Sha Engulfing Qi</h1><p>In the water pool, there were countless layers of restrictions, each layer was extremely sturdy, and difficult to break. The restrictions on the light shield were the core of the entire formation, and was bound to be even more difficult. Now only a few cracks had appeared, and it was far from being destroyed, yet it suddenly shattered.</p><p>Originally, they had intended to use up the Fire Raven Token’s fire essence, and even drain the Fire Raven’s essence spirit to destroy the magic artifact and use it to break through the formation, no one had expected this situation to occur.</p><p>The light shield had shattered without any warning, as if it had been forcefully torn open by an enormous force.</p><p>Once the formation was broken, and the light shield was shattered, the entire appearance of the cave appeared into everyone’s sight.</p><p>The Bottomless cave was completely pitch black, light was swallowed by the darkness, an endless sense of chilliness assaulted them. Everyone was frozen, and couldn’t help but shiver, this was an inconceivable event for Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Immediately afterwards, before anyone could react, a sudden enormous suction force pulled the eight people, along with the Fire Raven Token, into the cave. Immediately, chaos ensued.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>In the moment the suction force appeared, Qin Sang was immediately alert. Feeling the terror of the suction force, he was extremely terrified in his heart.</p><p>Fortunately, he had already been prepared, and resolutely withdrew his mind from the Fire Raven Token. Without any hesitation, he summoned the Ebony Wood sword, the sword light surrounded his body, protecting him, and he flew away. But he hadn’t even flown out before being captured by the suction force.</p><p>It was like a weak insect, being grabbed by a hand, with no power to resist.</p><p>The other few were also like this, falling one after another into the cave like dumplings. Everyone used all of their strength, but it was futile, and the descent was not relieved in the slightest.</p><p>“Quickly, gather together!”</p><p>Qing Ting urgently shouted, getting everyone to join hands and resist. His voice had not yet fallen, when earth shaking sounds came from below.</p><p>‘Hong long!’</p><p>An intense shaking transmitted, the ground shook and the mountains shook.</p><p>Liu Shan looked down and his expression changed greatly, he exclaimed in terror, “What is that!”</p><p>Everyone hurriedly looked below, and saw that from the depths of the cave, a black mist surged and came up, like a giant black dragon. It rushed up, straight at them, and was about to swallow them.</p><p>Upon seeing the terrifying black mist, Qin Sang suddenly felt a sense of inexplicable familiarity, a flash of lightning in his mind, and he finally remembered what this black mist was, and his hands and feet turned cold.</p><p>“It’s Earth Sha Engulfing Qi!” Qin Sang loudly reminded, his expression extremely unsightly.</p><p>The Grotto-Heaven Earth Pit was created by Earth Sha Nether Veins, and Qin Sang had guarded the Grotto-Heaven Earth Pit for several years, and had once curiously gone to the depths of the Grotto-Heaven Earth Pit, arriving at the junction of the Nether Qi and the Earth Sha Engulfing Qi, where he saw the body of the Earth Sha Engulfing Qi.</p><p>At that time, he carried with him a Sun-Yang Pearl and Repelling-Evil Pouch, and also held several cold-dispelling spiritual pills, but it still wasn’t able to stop the bone piercing cold from invading his body, nearly freezing him to death inside.</p><p>Since then, Qin Sang had learned the might of the Earth Sha Engulfing Qi, and never again dared to court death, only absorbing Nether Qi in the upper levels of the Grotto-Heaven Earth Pit.</p><p>Earth Sha Engulfing Qi was a type of world’s extreme yin ultimate evil qi, even Golden Core cultivators had to be somewhat cautious of it.</p><p>The Earth Sha Nether Vein in the Grotto-Heaven Earth Pit had harmed an unknown number of living beings, and the souls of the living beings it had swallowed had already formed condensed and undissipating Yin Sha Qi, affecting a large and vast region, causing the grass not to grow, becoming a desolate dead place.</p><p>Shaohua Mountain could only use restrictions to block the larger cracks as far as possible, to slow its swallowing rate, but they couldn’t stop the Earth Sha Nether Vein from spreading outward.</p><p>Could it be that the restriction above was left by an expert, to seal the Earth Sha Engulfing Qi in the cave?</p><p>Qin Sang couldn’t help but bitterly laugh, he would be too wronged to die here.</p><p>After being reminded by Qin Sang, everyone finally thought of the illustrious Earth Sha Engulfing Qi, and realized what kind of dangerous situation they were currently in, and they immediately became ashen.</p><p>Their bodies were pulled by the inexplicable suction force, with no power to resist, and as the Earth Sha Engulfing Qi neared, the terrifying coldness froze their bodies, and even moving became difficult. They could only watch as the Earth Sha Engulfing Qi rushed up and swallowed them.</p><p>Even Golden Core cultivators would find Earth Sha Engulfing Qi difficult to deal with, if they fell into it, what would be their fate?</p><p>After breaking the restrictions, they had originally intended to observe if there was any danger below, before deciding whether to explore or to leave. Who could have imagined that the suction force would not give them an opportunity to make a choice, and directly dragged them down, sending them into a dangerous situation where ten deaths would result.</p><p>“Who set this damned trap!” Someone cursed loudly.</p><p>If the Earth Sha Engulfing Qi was only sealed to stop it from causing disasters everywhere, then there was no need to leave a suction force trap, but they could only rage powerlessly.</p><p>Qin Sang did not give up hope. He forced himself to calm down and quickly thought about ways he could use to escape the dangerous situation.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's eyes caught a glimpse of something, and he was startled. He looked around and saw mountain caves all around the stone wall of the cave. These caves looked like natural karst caves, but they obviously had been renovated by humans, and there were more the closer he got to the bottom.</p><p>Since someone had dug these caves, no matter what their purpose was, they must have a way to resist the Earth Fiend Qi!</p><p>It was said and done, and in the blink of an eye, they were about to fall into the Earth Fiend Qi. Qin Sang hurriedly told everyone about his discovery. Qing Ting also saw the presence of the caves and immediately shouted, "Activate the Fire Crow Order with all your might, and throw it down!" without waiting to be Qin Sang's reminder.</p><p>Everyone immediately understood Qing Ting's intention. They endured the extreme cold and used their spiritual power to control the scattered Fire Crow Orders that had been disordered by the suction, mustering all their strength, and barely managed to converge into a formation. Then, without hesitation, they drew down on the Fire Crow Order's Fire Origin Power.</p><p>All the Fire Crow's spirits were released. Then, everyone forcibly squeezed them together. The seven Fire Crow Orders formed a large fireball. The heat slightly alleviated the coldness in their bodies.</p><p>The flames were unstable and exuded a violent aura. The Fire Crow Order could explode at any time. This was exactly what they wanted. They immediately threw the Fire Crow Order out with great force.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The intense explosion sent waves crashing down as the fire collided with the Earth Fiend Qi. The power of the magic weapon's self-destruction should not be underestimated. Under the impact of the explosion, Qin Sang suddenly felt that the suction force on his body had diminished by a few degrees, and he could finally move, but then the power of the explosion hit him, and his whole body was wracked with pain.</p><p>Qin Sang endured the severe pain; the opportunity was hard to come by. Time did not allow him to think much. He could only pinpoint the location of the cave that was closest to him and rushed in with all his strength.</p><p>At the last moment when he entered the cave, Qin Sang hurriedly glanced down and could only see Qing Ting, who was struggling to fly towards a cave at the bottom. They had all been scattered, and he had no idea what had happened to the others.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>Qin Sang staggered and fell into the cave, hitting his head hard on the stone wall. Then, darkness suddenly enveloped him. He saw the giant dragon composed of Earth Fiend Qi sweeping past the entrance of the cave and charging up to the sky.</p><p>He did not know how many years this Earth Fiend Qi had been suppressed, but once it was released, its terrifying power filled Qin Sang with fear.</p><p>He wondered how many people would manage to escape with their lives.</p>
