<h1>Chapter 1664: Protection of a Precious Artifact</h1><p>Chapter 1664: Protection of a Precious Artifact</p><p>What is this fragment, and why is it on Yitian Peak?</p><p>What is its connection to the gray energy?</p><p>Qin Sang was full of questions.</p><p>He didn't even know how the gray energy appeared in his dantian.</p><p>Earlier, when he tried to touch the fragment with his spiritual energy, not only was there no repulsion, but he felt a subtle sense of harmony.  Combined with the ancient character 'Kill' on the fragment, it brought certain memories to mind.</p><p>Both he and Qingzhu cultivated the "Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter".</p><p>Judging from the first seven levels of the Heavenly Tower, the lingering sword intent here is inextricably linked to the "Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter".</p><p>Did Senior Qingzhu discover some incredible secret?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, considering various possibilities, but couldn't reach a conclusion.</p><p>The fragment was extremely important to Senior Qingzhu; Ning Wuhuai wouldn't entrust it to him for casual study.  With the situation unclear, Qin Sang didn't want to reveal the existence of the gray energy in his dantian.</p><p>He needed to see Senior Qingzhu to find out.</p><p>He glanced at Ning Wuhuai, walked to the edge of the earthen platform, and gazed at the Netherworld Valley.</p><p>If he had the chance to enter alone later, he also wanted to go down and investigate what was below. However, Qin Sang understood that even an Outer Dao Nascent Soul cultivator found it difficult, so his hopes weren't high.</p><p>Soon, Ning Wuhuai finished refining the medicinal power.</p><p>When Qin Sang thought he would return the way they came and go elsewhere, Ning Wuhuai turned towards a stone wall at one end of the Netherworld Valley. After searching for a moment, he summoned his crimson-gold spirit sword and slashed a sword energy into the stone wall.</p><p>Immediately, the crimson-gold spirit sword's light blazed, enveloping them both. With a flash, they disappeared into the stone wall.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and Ning Wuhuai found themselves in a hall.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head and was surprised to find that there was no stone wall behind them, but a plain wall. The wall had no exit, and he couldn't sense any restrictive fluctuations—it was very strange.</p><p>Just then, the spiritual energy in the void suddenly became chaotic.</p><p>Without warning, thunder exploded, and in an instant, streams of light appeared, bright as meteors, like terrifying sword energies.  Sword energy filled the room, each beam aimed at them.</p><p>A mountain-shaking, sea-toppling pressure of sword intent swept over them.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, his scalp tingling.</p><p>Before he could react,</p><p>‘铮!’</p><p>A clear sword cry rang out.</p><p>Ning Wuhuai tossed the crimson-gold spirit sword upwards.  It hung inverted above their heads, spinning, its blade's glow shimmering, sword energy erupting like raindrops, penetrating the void.</p><p>The sword cry seemed to resonate with the void, the sword energy merging with the streams of light, the strange phenomenon gradually dissipating, returning to silence.</p><p>Qin Sang broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>His eyes showed surprise.</p><p>Just now, the streams of light in the void were likely ancient restrictions remaining in the hall, or the sword intent left by ancient sword cultivators, triggered by their uninvited arrival and attacking the intruders with terrifying momentum.</p><p>The moment these sword energies appeared, Qin Sang felt a tremor; the sword intent contained within them seemed to share the same origin as the "Yuan Shen Sword Nurturing Chapter".</p><p>Similar to the ancient sword hall before the Ziwei Palace's ancient teleportation array, but far more powerful. If the sword energy in the hall completely erupted, Qin Sang suspected that even a Nascent Soul Grandmaster couldn't survive, at best being pierced by countless swords and turned into a blood-soaked gourd.</p><p>He was about to summon his ebony sword, hoping to gain the sword energy's acknowledgment, but Ning Wuhuai acted first, resolving the crisis.</p><p>With the sword energy dissipated, the hall returned to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang dared not move carelessly, observing from where he stood, while Ning Wuhuai, who seemed to have anticipated this, remained calm and walked towards the hall's entrance.</p><p>"What a dilapidated hall!"</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly.</p><p>From inside, the hall was empty and incredibly dilapidated. The beams were almost broken, the pillars supporting the hall were crisscrossed with cracks, threatening to collapse, the roof tiles were askew, and gaps revealed in the broken areas allowed the sunlight to shine through.</p><p>It must look even worse from the outside.</p><p>One of the wooden doors was missing, the other was askew, about to fall.  Once made of some unknown spiritual wood, it was now full of signs of decay, reduced to rotten timber.</p><p>"Don't go outside; stepping across the threshold will trigger the Spirit Subduing Domain's suppression!"</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the entrance, Ning Wuhuai reached out to stop him.</p><p>This was Yitian Peak!</p><p>Qin Sang did not dare to overstep, looking down to find that the ancient hall was built on the highest point of Yitian Peak, next to the immortal-restricting sunlight. There were a few stone steps leading down, and below was a vast expanse; except for a light fog, there was virtually no obstruction to the view.</p><p>Yitian Peak towered tens of thousands of feet high.  Standing here, one could only see part of the mountain, unable to see the scenery below. It would be impossible to discern the events here from below.</p><p>Overlooking Yitian Peak, gazing into the distance.</p><p>The mountain range was a continuous expanse of stone forests, interspersed with occasional grand halls and pavilions.  Many buildings clustered together, alongside several forbidden valleys radiating strange, flickering lights.  The sights were varied and breathtaking.</p><p>One could imagine the bustling scene of cultivators on Yi Tian Peak in its heyday.</p><p>Due to the suppression of the Zhen Ling Domain, few cultivators possessed the ability to ascend Yi Tian Peak.  They hadn't spotted any other cultivators, but both remained cautious, concealing their presence and aura.</p><p>"Senior Qingzhu asked us to wait here for him?" Qin Sang asked, turning from his gaze.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui nodded, producing a shard. "He instructed me to wait here. Even if he doesn't return, he'll certainly appear nearby."</p><p>"Nearby?" Qin Sang's gaze swept across the forbidden areas below. "Senior Qingzhu can't fully control his body. If he's too far away, how will you get out there to help him?"</p><p>The Zhen Ling Domain's suppression was unreasonable; those without sufficient cultivation couldn't possibly leave, even Yuan Ying stage cultivators from other sects were insufficient.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui gently tapped the shard with his fingertip. "This treasure will protect me."</p><p>With that, Ning Wu Hui cautiously ventured out.</p><p>As Ning Wu Hui had said, the Zhen Ling Domain showed no unusual fluctuations. An invisible shield seemed to surround him, keeping him safe and unharmed.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang had a sudden idea.</p><p>The grey energy in his dantian seemed closely related to the shard, possibly originating from the same source. Could it also protect him within the Zhen Ling Domain?</p><p>However, with Ning Wu Hui nearby, Qin Sang held back from testing it.</p><p>After exploring for a while, Ning Wu Hui returned to the entrance of the hall, sat cross-legged, and began cultivating to refine the shard. Qin Sang also sat down, lost in thought for a moment before entering meditation to await Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>...</p><p>Three leaders of the Merchant Alliance, protecting Su Nu, stealthily traversed the Zhen Ling Domain and arrived at the foot of Yi Tian Peak.</p><p>Yi Tian Peak was almost devoid of cultivators; any present would undoubtedly be top-tier experts. Therefore, they dared not slacken, doing their best to conceal their auras to avoid detection.</p><p>Fortunately, all three were highly skilled and renowned experts, moving swiftly and maintaining excellent concealment.</p><p>The mountain path was long.</p><p>They raced directly towards the summit, passing numerous secluded realms without slowing down.</p><p>Finally, as they neared the shimmering light of the celestial barrier, they stopped at a concealed mountain pass entrance.</p><p>The three alliance leaders exchanged a glance, their eyes revealing a degree of tension.</p><p>Su Nu's face was ashen; even suicide was beyond her, powerless to resist, awaiting her fate.</p>
