<h1>Chapter 1944: Jade Capital Mountain</h1><p>Mr. Chen and Mr. Yu, the City God, were both talkative, while Judge Yi and Dr. Liu’s supporting roles were perfectly timed.  Qin Sang occasionally chimed in, but mostly listened with relish, occasionally refilling their cups.  This table, a gathering of mortals and immortals, was a unique experience.</p><p>*Sizzle…*</p><p>Qin Sang personally handled the grilling, using charcoal to roast the meat until slightly charred, then sprinkling on seasoning. Each movement was precise, every detail perfect. After grilling several skewers, she gave them to her apprentices.</p><p>The four youngsters huddled in a corner, their faces shiny with grease.</p><p>“You…on the mountain…ow, it’s burning!”</p><p>Tao Teng gasped repeatedly, unwilling to spit out the meat in his mouth. He swallowed with difficulty, feeling the deliciousness down to his bones. Whether from the heat or jealousy, Tao Teng’s eyes reddened as he looked at Yu Lang.  “It’s truly…a god’s life!”</p><p>The young servant, Mingyan, nodded in complete agreement.</p><p>“Eat yours!”</p><p>Yu Lang tossed Tao Teng a spirit fruit to shut him up.</p><p>*Bang! Bang! Bang!*</p><p>Someone was frantically knocking at the door.</p><p>Dr. Liu jumped, and Mr. Yu and Judge Yi turned to look.</p><p>Qin Sang said it was fine, got up and opened the door. Zhuque, the vermillion bird, flew in stealthily. Having been scolded several times, it had finally learned its lesson and didn't shout, instead staring intently at the meat in Qin Sang’s hand.  Qin Sang had already prepared a plate for it.  Ignoring everyone else, Zhuque buried its head and began to eat voraciously.</p><p>Everyone at the table watched Zhuque devour the meat.</p><p>“If even the birds love it, it must be delicious,” Dr. Liu chuckled.</p><p>Zhuque glared at him and continued to eat.</p><p>Mr. Yu and Judge Yi kept looking at Zhuque, realizing with astonishment that they couldn't even see through a bird in the temple?</p><p>After calming down, Mr. Yu picked up a skewer, gently sniffed it, and, imitating Qin Sang, bit directly into a piece.  He came from a scholarly family and had been raised with strict rules, so this crude way of eating was a first and somewhat uncomfortable for him. Mr. Chen had initially been the same, but quickly adapted, even praising this method of eating.</p><p>Mr. Yu savored the taste.</p><p>Mr. Chen watched him until he swallowed, then said smugly, “Brother Yu, how is it?  I wasn’t exaggerating, was I?”</p><p>“It’s heavenly!”</p><p>Mr. Yu praised generously.</p><p>“The Drunken Fragrance Feast of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant is said to be the best in the south, but it’s no match for this simple skewer.”</p><p>Judge Yi agreed, but inwardly scoffed, thinking, *Of course it’s delicious, considering the ingredients.*  He glanced at the several mortals in the room. They hadn’t exploded after eating so many potent spirit medicines and fruits.  Clearly, the temple master had secretly intervened, allowing them to slowly digest the medicinal power, at least enough to strengthen their bodies for a lifetime.</p><p>“What’s the Drunken Fragrance Feast?” Mr. Chen was bewildered. He had been to the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant many times but had never heard of such a feast.</p><p>“The owner of the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant was once an imperial chef.  Rumor has it that he offended some powerful people in the palace and was forced to retire, returning to Jien County to open the Drunken Fragrance Restaurant. Only the owner can prepare the Drunken Fragrance Feast, and there are no successors. The owner is getting old, and only makes it a few times a year, only his close friends get to enjoy it,” Mr. Yu sipped his wine, enjoying the mix of wine, meat, and medicinal aromas.</p><p>“Another recluse! Jien County truly deserves to be called the City, no, the County of Recluses!  Let's drink to that!”</p><p>Mr. Chen, overcome with excitement, suddenly slammed his fist on the table and drained his cup.  He drank several more cups, becoming increasingly unrestrained.</p><p>Mr. Yu glanced at Qin Sang and thought inwardly, *It’s true*. “Since it’s the County of Recluses, it’s also a hidden dragon’s lair. Brother Chen, you should emerge from seclusion next autumn during the examinations, shouldn’t you?”</p><p>As the City God of Jien County, Mr. Yu paid attention to the talented scholars under his jurisdiction. He knew Mr. Chen was quite learned but unfortunately had repeatedly failed the imperial examinations.</p><p>Mr. Chen gave a wry smile. “In my youth, I was arrogant, yet I repeatedly failed.  Seeing my classmates succeed one after another, I only pretended to be aloof, merely wearing a mask to save face. I was never a true recluse; there’s no question of emerging from seclusion.”</p><p>“With such a heart, Brother Chen, I believe you will one day achieve your wish,” Qin Sang offered Mr. Chen a toast, and everyone drank together.  No one offered words of comfort; Mr. Chen’s willingness to expose his shortcomings showed he didn’t need any consolation.</p><p>Mr. Chen accepted it calmly, stood up, and looked out the window.  “In my youthful arrogance, I was fond of shocking pronouncements…”</p><p>He no longer yearned for titles or fame in history books.  If he were fortunate enough to pass the imperial examinations and become a local magistrate, he only wished to serve the people well, be loyal to the Emperor, and live without regret towards Heaven or himself.”</p><p>……</p><p>The Qingyang Temple pavilion buzzed with lively conversation.</p><p>The town of Jinen was bustling with activity.</p><p>The teahouse should have been even livelier than the street outside.</p><p>But when the young girl entered, she felt an unusual stillness. Everyone was completely absorbed in listening to the storyteller.</p><p>The tea server moved with the utmost care, pouring tea as if afraid of making the slightest noise.</p><p>The patrons rarely spoke, even forgetting the food and tea before them.</p><p>Only when the storyteller struck the clapper did they rouse themselves, briefly chatting and sipping tea, their voices as soft as whispers.</p><p>The storyteller's voice filled the teahouse, seeming to drown out the outside commotion.</p><p>"What story could be so captivating?"</p><p>The girl, filled with wonder, looked past the patrons towards the storyteller on the stage.</p><p>Just as the woman outside had described, the storyteller wore a grey robe, looked young, was of average height and build, and unremarkable in appearance – the type of person who'd blend into any crowd.</p><p>The storyteller noticed the girl entering and smiled slightly, nodding in greeting.</p><p>The girl returned the smile.</p><p>A tea server approached with a teapot, exchanged a brief glance with the girl, and led her to an empty table.</p><p>"Now, as the celestial maiden descended to earth, the Heavenly Mother dispatched the Azure Bird to deliver a message, secretly instructing it to use magic to take the maiden back to the Heavenly Pool if she proved uncooperative. Unexpectedly, the Azure Bird succumbed to earthly desires and was easily persuaded by the celestial maiden to stay…"</p><p>It was a mythological tale.</p><p>The girl, led to her seat by the tea server, didn't notice her shoulder bird raising its head and fluttering its wings at the mention of the Azure Bird.</p><p>'Cheep…cheep…'</p><p>The bird took flight, circling tirelessly.</p><p>Its feathers shed blue dust, its chirping perfectly blending with the storyteller's narrative, transforming itself into the Azure Bird of the story, making the listeners feel they were actually there.</p><p>The listeners, including the girl, found nothing strange about this.</p><p>Completely forgetting her companions, the girl focused intently on the storyteller, enthralled by the tale.</p><p>In a daze, she felt she had become the celestial maiden in the story.</p><p>Her master was the cruel Heavenly Mother.</p><p>Every action, every experience of the maiden on earth stirred her emotions.</p><p>When the maiden rejoiced, she too laughed; when the maiden wept, tears streamed down her own face.</p><p>……</p><p>The girl forgot she was in a teahouse, forgot everything around her, lost in the world the storyteller had created.</p><p>Shortly after the girl entered the teahouse, a gust of cold wind swept past the entrance, and a shadowy figure, invisible to ordinary eyes, appeared.</p><p>Clad in armor, this was a god from the Jinen City God's retinue, of high rank – a Day-Patrol God, second only to the City God and the judges, equal in status to the other high officials and generals.</p><p>"She's inside?"</p><p>Two underworld constables standing nearby bowed deeply in response.</p><p>The girl must have some way to conceal her aura; she had bypassed the gatekeepers, but the divine objects in the City God's temple sensed her presence.</p><p>Unfortunately, the high officials were all absent.</p><p>The City God and the Literary Judge were out on patrol, and the Martial Judge had led troops out of the city to hunt a demon.</p><p>Unable to determine the girl's origins, the Day-Patrol God and the other officials dared not act rashly. Seeing her innocent demeanor, they decided to send the Day-Patrol God out of the city to seek instructions from the Martial Judge.</p><p>Two underworld soldiers remained on watch.</p><p>"Yes, she entered the teahouse and hasn't come out," one constable hesitated, "It's… strange in there, my lord. You should go see for yourself."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>The Day-Patrol God frowned, leading the two constables silently through the doorway.  The storyteller had just reached the part where the celestial maiden faced danger.</p><p>"The Heavenly Mother dispatched heavenly soldiers to search the entire world. No matter how cautious the celestial maiden and the Azure Bird were, they could not escape. On Lianyang Mountain, they were finally discovered by a troop of heavenly soldiers.  Poor celestial maiden and Azure Bird; the immortal seals they received upon their descent had not yet dissipated, their powers only at thirty percent, and now they faced another fierce battle…"</p><p>The bird had returned to the girl's shoulder, immersed in the story as much as its owner, displaying an anxious expression.</p><p>The Day-Patrol God and the two constables, having just entered the teahouse, were startled when the storyteller nodded at them.</p><p>At that moment, a surge of righteous indignation filled them.  They felt as if they had transformed into celestial soldiers, dispatched by the Heavenly Mother to apprehend criminals and mete out divine justice!</p><p>They completely forgot the purpose of their trip, and sat down at another empty table, their backs ramrod straight, their eyes shining with determination.</p><p>The story continued.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan at Qingyang Temple knew nothing of this.</p><p>The feast lasted from morning until afternoon.</p><p>Dr. Liu stayed overnight at Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Chen Xiucai, Yu Cheng Huang, and the others descended the mountain together.  They parted ways at the edge of the bamboo forest.</p><p>Chen Xiucai offered them a ride in his carriage, but Yu and Yi declined.</p><p>After parting, the two deities vanished into thin air, reappearing in the mountains not far from Qingyang Temple.</p><p>“Greetings to your excellencies.”</p><p>The local earth deity, who had been waiting there, quickly bowed.</p><p>Yi Pan Guan said, “We’ve already met that Qingfeng Daoist. He’s no ordinary person. Be careful in your dealings with him, carry out any requests promptly, and don't disturb him unnecessarily.”</p><p>The earth deity was startled. “I wonder what the Daoist’s background is?”</p><p>Yi Pan Guan looked at Yu Cheng Huang.  Yu Cheng Huang, for some reason, hadn’t asked about this.</p><p>“I fear even the highest officials in the prefecture would treat this person with respect.  His seclusion in Jien County... it’s hard to say whether it's a blessing or a curse.”</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang sighed, “Regardless of his identity or cultivation, let's just consider him a powerful being who plays among mortals.”</p><p>The earth deity responded vaguely.</p><p>Yi Pan Guan looked at the earth deity and said sternly, “With such a person, everything depends on fate.  Before the time is right, everything is illusion.  Don't think that diligent service will bring you any benefit; be careful not to overdo it.”</p><p>The earth deity, his thoughts exposed, shivered. “Thank you for your warning, your excellency. I almost made a grave mistake.”</p><p>“You don't need to be so overly cautious.  I find this person's nature to be easygoing; just let things take their course,” Yu Cheng Huang added a few more instructions, then returned to the county city with Yi Pan Guan.</p><p>…</p><p>“What do you mean? The Day and Night You Shen and the Soul-Reapers are trapped in a teahouse?”</p><p>When Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan returned to the city, Wu Pan Guan had also just returned from apprehending a demon.  They were about to combine forces when they received a message via talisman.</p><p>Upon seeing the contents of the talisman, the three officials’ faces changed drastically.</p><p>Apparently, the Day You Shen had disappeared after entering the teahouse; the Night You Shen and Soul-Reapers, upon searching for him, also became trapped inside.</p><p>Then several more officials from different departments.</p><p>The teahouse door seemed like a gaping maw, swallowing all the ghosts and gods without a trace.</p><p>More and more ghosts and gods were drawn in, until some Yin Cha noticed something was wrong.</p><p>“Preposterous! I want to see what kind of demon dares to act so recklessly within the city!”</p><p>Wu Pan Guan exploded with rage, a flick of his sleeve sending all his ghost soldiers swirling as a dark wind, rushing towards the teahouse.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang and Yi Pan Guan exchanged a look; both saw the same worry reflected in the other's eyes.</p><p>How could this be such a coincidence?</p><p>It happened while they were visiting Qingfeng Daoist.</p><p>By now, the teahouse was surrounded by layers of Yin Cha, using magic to seal it off from the mortal world.</p><p>Mortals were oblivious.  People were still coming and going on the street, but would subconsciously avoid the teahouse.</p><p>The storyteller’s booming voice could be heard, narrating the tale of a Nine Heavens Goddess and a Azure Bird being pursued by celestial soldiers.</p><p>The chase was thrilling and captivating.</p><p>All the ghosts and gods in the city were there, yet none dared to take a step into the teahouse.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A gust of dark wind descended from the sky. Yu Cheng Huang and the two Pan Guan finally arrived, listened to their subordinates' report, and went to the teahouse door.</p><p>The curtain was made of bamboo.  Through the gaps, they could vaguely see inside.</p><p>A young woman, the Azure Bird, and a crowd of ghosts and gods, each with different expressions, were completely immersed in the story.</p><p>“Deploy the Town Mountain Spirit Banner!”</p><p>Wu Pan Guan murmured.</p><p>Outside the teahouse, a team of ghost soldiers received their orders, retrieved nine three-zhang-tall black banners, and erected them around the teahouse.</p><p>The ghost soldiers were divided into nine groups, gathering beneath the banners, the main banner standing behind Wu Pan Guan.</p><p>Nine banners formed an array, capable of subduing any immortals, cultivators, or demons!</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang nodded to Yi Pan Guan, who stepped forward and lifted the curtain but did not cross the threshold.</p><p>The curtain was half raised.</p><p>The three officials saw the storyteller, and at the same time, the storyteller looked up.</p><p>Yu Cheng Huang opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The storyteller suddenly slammed his sounding block, “The celestial soldiers were driven back by the Nine Heavens Goddess’s clever strategy, suffering a crushing defeat. Just as the Nine Heavens Goddess and the Azure Bird were celebrating, they didn't know that danger was approaching! Three Star Lords have already led their troops in pursuit; this calamity will be difficult for them to overcome!”</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain Dojo.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body was comprehending a sword array when he suddenly awoke, gazing south, his expression slowly turning grave.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, left his cave dwelling, informed Gui Hou, and vanished using thunder escape.</p>
