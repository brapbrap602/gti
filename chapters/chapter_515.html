<h1>Chapter 508 The False Sect Leader</h1><p>After an interrogation, Qin Sang had a clear understanding of the situation within the Demonflame Sect.</p><p>The Core Formation late-stage cultivator, surnamed Luo, was a disciple of Priest Jiupao and the newly appointed Demonflame Emissary.  Currently, he held the highest position and possessed the greatest power within the Demonflame Sect, effectively controlling the sect in Priest Jiupao's stead.</p><p>Besides the three captives, eleven other remnants of the Demonflame Sect remained, one of whom was at the late-stage Core Formation realm, while the rest were mostly at the mid-stage.  Like a centipede that twitches even after death, the deep roots of the Kuiyin Sect were evident.</p><p>Priest Jiupao had intended to sever ties with the Kuiyin Sect, therefore expressly forbidding any contact between the Kuiyin Sect remnants, other than Luo, and the newly initiated disciples of the Demonflame Sect. They would typically absorb sufficient Yin Sha Qi in the underground cavern before returning to the back mountain for secluded cultivation, never interacting with the new disciples.  Within the Kuiyin Sect, Priest Jiupao was their master or grandmaster.</p><p>These individuals had been pursued by the Yuanzhao Sect for decades, living in constant fear. Finally finding a sanctuary, they were entirely dependent on Priest Jiupao and none dared to disobey his commands.</p><p>After soul possession, a period of recovery is always necessary.  Priest Jiupao, confident in his success, had summoned all his disciples back to the sect prior to the attempt. Even those stationed in Green Sun City were recalled under various pretexts, awaiting his return.</p><p>Therefore, all the Kuiyin Sect remnants summoned by Priest Jiupao were currently within the Demonflame Sect awaiting news, saving Qin Sang the trouble of searching for them.</p><p>Qin Sang left the cavern and retrieved Priest Jiupao's sole remaining possession, the iron thumb ring.</p><p>Priest Jiupao had designated this iron thumb ring as the symbol of the Demonflame Sect's leadership, declaring that whoever possessed it would be recognized as the sect leader.</p><p>This knowledge prompted Qin Sang to reconsider his initial plan of disbanding the Demonflame Sect.  A new idea began to form.</p><p>After killing the three captives and placing them into his corpse puppet bag, Qin Sang donned a black robe, put on the iron thumb ring, and flew towards the Demonflame Sect at the foot of Earthfire Volcano.</p><p>The Demonflame Sect's protective formation was perpetually active. To ordinary mortals, the crimson-leafed spiritual trees appeared unremarkable, but cultivators knew the danger they concealed.  Each tree within the forest was a potential death trap, capable of myriad transformations.</p><p>As Qin Sang approached the protective formation, a shout echoed from within.</p><p>"Halt! Who goes there!"</p><p>Qin Sang stopped, keeping his black robe on and raising his right hand to display the iron thumb ring.</p><p>"The Sect Leader has returned!"</p><p>A gasp came from within the formation, followed by a figure emerging from the forest.  Prostrating himself before Qin Sang, he said, "Disciple Lu Xing greets the Sect Leader! Please forgive me!"</p><p>"It was I who instructed you to activate the protective formation. What is there to forgive?"</p><p>Qin Sang noticed a flicker of doubt in Lu Xing's eyes. Remaining still, he swept his gaze over the area and asked casually, "Where are Luo Xiao and Mei Gu?"</p><p>Luo Xiao was the late-stage Core Formation cultivator Qin Sang had captured in the cavern.</p><p>The doubt in Lu Xing's eyes vanished. He immediately replied, "Reporting to Sect Leader, Senior Brother Luo descended the mountain last night. His destination is unknown, but he instructed this disciple to guard the mountain gate. Senior Sister Mei Gu is currently at the training grounds, instructing the younger generation. This disciple will summon her at once…"</p><p>"No need."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand and strode into the Demonflame Sect.</p><p>"I shall go to the back mountain first. Inform Mei Gu and the others to await me at the training grounds…"</p><p>As he spoke, Qin Sang activated his movement technique and vanished into the forest, leaving only a faint echo behind.</p><p>Apart from Ji Wu, a unique exception, the other successfully established disciples of the Demonflame Sect were only at the early-stage of Core Formation.</p><p>Lu Xing couldn't possibly discern Qin Sang's movement technique.</p><p>Qin Sang stealthily approached the grand halls in the back mountain. From Luo Xiao, he had learned the details of the Kuiyin Sect remnants on the mountain and planned to eliminate them all in one fell swoop.</p><p>As a precaution, Qin Sang first set up an isolating barrier outside, then deployed the Ten Yama Formation.  Wielding the Ebony Sword, he forcefully charged into one of the grand halls.</p><p>The demonic cultivator inside, caught completely off guard during meditation, was slain by Qin Sang without any resistance.</p><p>Within a quarter of an hour, all eleven Kuiyin Sect remnants within the Demonflame Sect were eliminated.</p><p>Each of them possessed Ten Yama Banners, though most had been destroyed during their escape.  The surviving banners were collected by Priest Jiupao and given to the four Demonflame Emissaries to serve as their trump cards while traveling.</p><p>These individuals all yearned for the power of the Ten Yama Banners, but with the Yuanzhao Sect still pursuing them, they dared not act recklessly.</p><p>Ten white banners had been destroyed by Qin Sang using his Nine Nether Demonic Fire.</p><p>Ji Wu originally also had ten. During the battle in Cold Mountain City, when Priest Jiupao's magic treasures were tainted by the Blood Defilement Divine Light and he was forced into a desperate situation, he used Ji Wu's Ten Yama Formation to defend against Qin Sang, but it too was destroyed in the battle.  The other two Demonflame Emissaries only possessed six banners each.</p><p>After killing so many Kuiyin Sect remnants, and adding the spoils from the Demonflame Emissaries, Qin Sang only obtained fourteen complete Ten Yama Banners in total.</p><p>Not even two complete sets.</p><p>The power of the Ten Yama Formation even surpassed that of talisman treasures. Selling them would undoubtedly fetch a handsome sum, but Qin Sang, not yet having reached the Nascent Soul realm, still relied on the Ten Yama Formation to empower his magic treasures.</p><p>To be safe, it was best to keep them.</p><p>The last traces of the Kuiyin Sect in the cultivation world were erased by Qin Sang.</p><p>This once powerful demonic sect, whose name had struck fear into the hearts of righteous cultivators throughout the Small Cold Region, now existed only in history.</p><p>After eliminating these individuals, Qin Sang collected the spoils, erased all traces of the battle, and flew towards the training grounds on the mountain peak.</p><p>…</p><p>The Demonflame Sect's training grounds were located near the summit. Standing there, one could clearly hear the rumbling of magma within the volcanic crater, and the air was intensely hot.</p><p>However, the Demonflame Sect disciples cultivated unique techniques and were unaffected by the heat.</p><p>At this moment, four individuals stood on the training grounds, three men and one woman.</p><p>Among them were Lu Xing and two other young men of similar age, one named Zhao Shanran and the other calling himself the Crimson Leaf Scholar.</p><p>The woman was a matronly figure in palace attire, with a gentle demeanor. She was Mei Gu, the most powerful of the four, having already sensed the bottleneck to mid-stage Core Formation.</p><p>These four were the only remaining Core Formation cultivators of the Demonflame Sect.  They were originally rogue cultivators with decent talent, who had been recruited and successfully established their foundations.</p><p>The four were anxiously waiting. An hour had passed, yet the Sect Leader was still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"Junior Brother Lu, has the Sect Leader truly returned?  You're not playing a trick on us, are you?"</p><p>Zhao Shanran, impatient from waiting, questioned Lu Xing.</p><p>Lu Xing glared at him. "Senior Brother Zhao, don't speak such nonsense!  Even with the greatest audacity, I wouldn't dare falsely convey the Sect Leader's decree!  I advise you to be careful, lest misfortune befall you from your own mouth…"</p><p>Just as he finished speaking, a black-robed figure materialized before them.</p><p>Without any warning.</p><p>The four were startled, but upon seeing the iron thumb ring on Qin Sang's hand, they all prostrated themselves.</p><p>"Disciples greet the Sect Leader!"</p>
