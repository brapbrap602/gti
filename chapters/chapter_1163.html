<h1>Chapter 1155: No Tribulation</h1><p>Chapter 1155: No Tribulation</p><p>Could these visions be my heart demons?</p><p>Qin Sang was on high alert.</p><p>Achieving immortality had been his lifelong pursuit, his greatest obsession.</p><p>The Heart Demon Tribulation isn't always triggered by the deepest fears and most traumatic experiences.  It can also stem from obsessions.</p><p>It waits for one to let their guard down, then delivers a fatal blow, turning joy into sorrow.</p><p>The Heart Demon Tribulation comes after the Lightning Tribulation, indicating its extreme danger. Once lost within it, escape becomes impossible.</p><p>“Master Uncle!”</p><p>“Master Qin!”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone flew to the island and saw Qin Sang sitting cross-legged. Though his body was charred black, appearing somewhat comical, he was still alive.</p><p>Unexpectedly, as they landed beside him, Qin Sang suddenly flashed back several feet, his face alert, regarding them as mortal enemies, sword energy flickering in his palm.</p><p>“Master, you don't recognize me? I'm your little Fatty Chicken!”</p><p>Since Qin Sang had successfully broken through, Fatty Chicken's attitude had changed drastically.  He was fawning and eager to ingratiate himself, but Bai grabbed him by the scruff of his neck.</p><p>“Qin Xiong, do you think you're still in the Heart Demon Tribulation?”</p><p>Bai guessed the reason.  A moment passed in the real world, but for someone undergoing the Heart Demon Tribulation, countless years might have passed in the illusion.  Sudden awakening makes it difficult to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p>Bai gestured for everyone to back off, giving Qin Sang time.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at everyone, then down at his own disheveled appearance, his eyes flickering. Finally, he confirmed he wasn't in a Heart Demon Tribulation. This was real.</p><p>He had successfully passed the tribulation!</p><p>There was no Heart Demon Tribulation!</p><p>Only one explanation for this situation: the Jade Buddha!</p><p>Qin Sang was astonished by the Jade Buddha's powerful ability. He had anticipated that under the Jade Buddha's protection, the power of the heart demons might be weakened, making his tribulation less difficult.</p><p>Incredibly, the Jade Buddha had completely eradicated the Heart Demon Tribulation—the most dreaded ordeal for cultivators!</p><p>“What level of treasure is the Jade Buddha, exactly?”</p><p>Qin Sang was lost in thought.</p><p>If this got out, the entire cultivation world would go mad.</p><p>The celestial treasures recorded in ancient texts, however precious and rare, could at most stabilize one's mind, increasing the chances of success in a tribulation. No one had ever heard of one that could eliminate the Heart Demon Tribulation entirely.</p><p>He had already placed the Jade Buddha very highly, but it seemed he still underestimated it.</p><p>“I’m a Nascent Soul cultivator?”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, inspecting his Nascent Soul. His gaze gradually cleared.  A spiritual light flowed over his body, healing his injuries, and he donned a brand new Daoist robe.</p><p>“Congratulations, Qin Xiong, on your breakthrough to Nascent Soul, on transcending to sainthood!”</p><p>Bai offered his congratulations.</p><p>“Congratulations, Master Uncle!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Master Qin!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Master!”</p><p>…</p><p>Li Yu Fu and the three demons all paid their respects, each using a different term, their faces filled with joy and envy.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled and nodded, looking around, feeling refreshed.</p><p>The spirit island on the lake, the birds, the fish.</p><p>Everything around him was under his control!</p><p>Qin Sang felt an overwhelming sense of exhilaration, suddenly letting out a long roar that shook the heavens.</p><p>…</p><p>After an incense stick's worth of time.</p><p>Everyone sped across the Yun Cang Great Marsh, returning to their cave abode. Qin Sang, newly a Nascent Soul cultivator, needed to consolidate his cultivation through seclusion.</p><p>“Master Uncle, should we hold a Nascent Soul celebration, establish a sect?”</p><p>Li Yu Fu took the initiative to ask.</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, saying calmly, “I still have unfinished business! Holding a Nascent Soul ceremony now… how would I give that person the greatest surprise? Besides, I still need to maintain the disguise of the Moonlit Demon King. As for establishing a sect…”</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang said, “The Abyss of Sin is still unsettled, the cultivation world is in turmoil; now is not the best time. When you travel, if you encounter promising disciples, you can guide their cultivation, but don't publicly accept disciples yet. In the future, the sect will be called Qing Yang Temple!”</p><p>Qin Sang had no obsession with establishing a sect.  He simply wanted a few disciples to handle some mundane tasks, so he wouldn’t have to do everything himself.</p><p>Since the Yun Youzi had wished to re-establish the Qing Yang Temple, and Qin Sang had received much kindness from three generations of Qing Yang Temple disciples, he decided to continue the name.</p><p>“This disciple thanks Master Uncle on behalf of the ancestral master!”</p><p>Li Yu Fu's tiger eyes welled up. He bore the ancestral master's legacy, yet only possessed Golden Core cultivation.</p><p>The responsibility was immense, heavy as a thousand jun.</p><p>Qin Sang had taken on the burden from his shoulders.</p><p>“No need for such formalities.”</p><p>Qin Sang helped Li Yu Fu to his feet, encouraging him, “You are the true successor of your predecessor. I see that you should soon break through to the middle stage of Golden Core.  With your talent, you are very likely to reach Nascent Soul.”</p><p>"From now on, avoid distractions and focus on your cultivation.  Reach the Nascent Soul stage quickly, so I can entrust Qingyang Temple to you with peace of mind, and you can then travel the world."</p><p>Having said this, Qin Sang turned to the three monsters and said to Xiaobai, "You don't need to return with me. Go back to Qianshan Bamboo Sea now and tell Daoist Liu the good news. I will stay at Yuanshen Gate for a period of quiet cultivation. If anything important happens, send me a message."</p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The three monsters, though reluctant to leave, bid farewell to Qin Sang and returned to Qianshan Bamboo Sea.</p><p>Soon after, Qin Sang and the two others arrived near Yuanshen Gate. Li Yu Fu separated from them and returned to his cave abode alone.</p><p>That cave was suitable for Golden Core cultivators, but seemed rather meager for a Nascent Soul master. Fortunately, Qin Sang possessed a Yuanshen Gate Elder's token, allowing free access, so there was no urgent need to find a new abode.  It would be even better to see Senior Sister Qingjun.</p><p>Li Yu Fu returned and told Tan Yi En and the other one the good news. Their excitement is needless to say.</p><p>Yuanshen Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang concealed her cultivation, disguising herself as a Golden Core cultivator. Arriving at the gate, she found the guards were much stricter than usual.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>A group of disciples flew out from the gate, halting Qin Sang.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations emanating from Qin Sang, the disciples' expressions froze. Upon seeing the token in Qin Sang's hand, their faces turned pale with panic. They hastily opened the formation, stepping forward to bow. "Greetings, Elder Qin! We were blind and shortsighted. Please punish us, Elder Qin!"</p><p>"You are guarding the sect, what crime have you committed? Rise."</p><p>Qin Sang was in a very good mood and naturally wouldn't make things difficult for these disciples.</p><p>Entering Yuanshen Gate, Qin Sang paused and asked, "Is the Ancestor within the gate?"</p><p>"Reporting to Elder Qin, according to what the disciples know, the Ancestor and the other Elders went to the front lines and haven't returned since."</p><p>The leading disciple replied.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and flashed towards the Yuanshen Gate's restricted area.</p><p>After Qin Sang's figure disappeared into the restricted area, the other disciples gathered around.</p><p>"Is this the legendary, most mysterious Elder Qin?"</p><p>"So young!  And so approachable!"</p><p>"She's radiant!"</p><p>"It's said that Elder Qin appeared seemingly out of nowhere, a late-stage Golden Core master, deeply trusted by the Ancestor, allowed to cultivate in the restricted area.  Do you think she's the Ancestor's choice for the next sect leader?"</p><p>"It's possible!  In this great war, so many elders went to the front, yet an Elder of such high cultivation was left behind. They must be protecting Elder Qin!"</p><p>…</p>
