<h1>Chapter 1822: Half-Puppet Body</h1><p>Mo Xingdao and Hong Yuzi, who had searched for the Qinghu Saint King for many years, suddenly appeared before them.</p><p>Furthermore, they were ambushed in a place neither could have ever anticipated!</p><p>Qing Fei, the Qinghu Saint King, sensed Mo Xingdao's gaze.  She glanced sideways, meeting his eyes. A charming smile curved her lips as she bowed gracefully to the heavens.</p><p>One bow, the moon rose.</p><p>The wind ceased, and the Spirit Lake appeared.</p><p>Below, the lake's water shimmered, reflecting the moon like a silver plate. Water and moon intertwined, locking heaven and earth.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King and Xia Hou were clearly prepared. A water-moon prison sealed both Hong Yuzi and Mo Xingdao.  Mo Xingdao had no time to escape, his retreat cut off.</p><p>The scene before him was all too familiar.</p><p>Years ago, during the hunt for ancient demons at the Wuxiang Immortal Gate, the Qinghu Saint King had used this fox's moon-worshipping technique to trap a demonic body.</p><p>Mo Xingdao had once aided the Qinghu Saint King in hunting demons; now, he was experiencing the power of this demonic art firsthand.</p><p>Back then, the Qinghu Saint King needed several Yuan Ying cultivators to assist. Now, she single-handedly imprisoned two, the power undiminished, even increased.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's heart lurched.  His eyes showed shock. Without hesitation, he retreated frantically, his palms intersecting.  Thick black energy surged from his arms like two black dragons, coalescing into a sharp point before striking the water-moon barrier behind him.</p><p>Hong Yuzi, ignoring Mo Xingdao, glared at Xia Hou, flinging the Yellow Book.</p><p>This Yellow Book, called the Thousand Mountains Record, was unlike typical treasures.  It was a talismanic artifact of supreme power.</p><p>As the name suggests, it was a kind of talismanic chart.</p><p>Created by a master of talismans, day and night they painstakingly sketched a divine talisman that could manifest the shadow of mountains. Each additional talisman added a mountain shadow, and the Record, once unfurled, possessed a terrifying power comparable to a thousand mountains.</p><p>Those with weaker cultivation would be instantly reduced to pulp!</p><p>It's said the talisman forms aren't complex; the difficulty lies in combining them into the Record—a feat only a grandmaster of talismans could achieve.</p><p>'Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!'</p><p>As if an invisible hand rapidly turned the pages of the Yellow Book, instantly reaching the last page.</p><p>With each page turned, a black mountain shadow appeared, merging with the previous ones.</p><p>The mountain shadows piled up, their color deepening, until they were no longer shadows but a true mountain!</p><p>At that moment, the moon was above, the Spirit Lake below, but between moon and lake, a colossal mountain stood, seemingly capable of piercing the moon and shattering the lake!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The black mountain trembled, suddenly plummeting.</p><p>Enveloped by the mountain's shadow, even the powerful Xia Hou felt a crushing pressure, his spirit shaken.</p><p>Xia Hou's eyes blazed with murderous intent. This was an ambush; the attack would be decisive and relentless!</p><p>His blood qi soared, and his figure leaped, merging into the shadow of a divine deer.</p><p>The deer let out an excited roar, its aura intensifying, its eyes more ferocious, its speed surging as it charged before the mountain could fall.</p><p>Its antlers were wreathed in blood-red light that filled the sky, distorting the void. The antlers were like blades tearing through space, leaving a piercing sound in their wake. The target: the leader of the demon soldiers.</p><p>The demon soldier leader's eyes were bloodshot. His cultivation was only at the early stage of the Cave Xuan realm, facing a late-stage Cave Xuan realm cultivator of the same demon race. He was inevitably subjected to the opponent's imposing might.</p><p>Years of close companionship and countless drills had fused his essence with that of the demon soldiers. Backed by the war-altar, he could withstand this pressure.</p><p>If the formation was intact and combined with the talismanic array, even without Hong Yuzi's intervention, they could have held their own for a while.</p><p>But the enemy launched a surprise attack while the formation was unstable, causing chaos in the battlefield, leaving the demon soldier leader with no choice but to fight to the death.</p><p>The demon soldier leader stood tall, his eyes wide as copper bells, roaring at the sky.</p><p>Hong Yuzi's troops were elite soldiers, fearless and loyal.</p><p>Even in this dire situation, the demon soldiers had not lost their fighting spirit. Even those injured and bleeding fought to maintain their stance.</p><p>At this moment, all the demon soldiers unleashed their blood qi frantically.  Hong Yuzi pressed his palm downwards, seizing it tightly, his spiritual energy surging. Although the formation was slightly scattered, the blood qi still formed a blood map, finally condensing into a blood seal that entered the demon soldier leader's brow.</p><p>This was a secret technique used only in times of extreme danger.</p><p>The demon army leader, brimming with power, leaped forward, his agile form showing no sign of retreat, crashing into the divine deer!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The collision between the divine deer and the demon leader sent violent tremors through the Water-Moon Prison.</p><p>The demon soldiers spat blood, many collapsing and losing their fighting ability.</p><p>The golden-eyed leopard clung fiercely to the deer's antlers, but was relentlessly forced back, blood splattering, bleeding from all seven orifices.</p><p>Fortunately, a massive black mountain fell, smashing into the deer's head.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The deer shuddered, its forward momentum halted.</p><p>Hong Yuzi seized the opportunity, activating his altar, a flash of light engulfing the remaining soldiers and drawing them into the altar.</p><p>The deer shook its head and exchanged a glance with the Azure Fox Saint King above.</p><p>Their eyes met, and the two demons reached an understanding: their ambush on Hong Yuzi had failed.</p><p>Indeed, a Daoist court official was not easily slain, even after breaking through his formations.  Killing him would require Xia Hou to risk his life.</p><p>Xia Hou had already made his decision: a swift victory was ideal; otherwise, he would withdraw to avoid complications.  Their objective had already been achieved.</p><p>Moonlight suddenly shifted from the Nine-Return Pearl, locking onto Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, wielding a long spike, had just used the chaos to create a breach in the Water-Moon Prison.  The moonlight’s lock revealed the immense pressure his demon body had once endured.</p><p>His body stiffened, but his eyes burned with madness. Thunder rumbled within him, his form swelling as his power surged.  He pushed against the moonlight's pressure, stepping out of the prison.</p><p>But the moment he escaped, Mo Xingdao's pupils constricted.</p><p>The demons' apparent ambush on Hong Yuzi was a ruse; their true target was Mo Xingdao, and they had a hidden plan.</p><p>Before Mo Xingdao could see what lay ahead, a fierce wind struck him, a terrifying force impacting his chest, sending him flying.</p><p>Mo Xingdao’s vision blurred as he staggered to his feet.  The Azure Fox Saint King stood before him, smiling serenely.</p><p>Facing this stunningly beautiful fox demon, Mo Xingdao felt no enchantment, only icy dread.</p><p>He glanced frantically at the other battlefield, despairing as he saw four celestial pillars rise from the lake.  Hong Yuzi was entangled with Xia Hou, trapped within the pillars.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you.”</p><p>A chilling voice echoed in his ears.</p><p>Terror gripped Mo Xingdao. He unleashed a burst of Xuan Qi from his throat, forming a flying dagger to strike the Azure Fox Saint King.  He raised his arms to fight back, only to discover a strange power invading his body.</p><p>This force coursed through him, parts of his body slipping beyond his control.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King’s smile deepened, a circle of light descending from the heavens, striking the Xuan Qi dagger.</p><p>Even Hong Yuzi's Nine-Return Pearl was blocked by this light; Mo Xingdao's refined Xuan Qi, years in the making, was no match.  He was trapped, his vital energy surging.</p><p>His energy, as if alive, thrashed and struggled, but couldn't break the light circle.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King glided closer, her jade hand gently reaching towards Mo Xingdao's forehead.</p><p>Mo Xingdao fought back wildly, but a numbing sensation spread from his torso to his limbs.</p><p>His puppet-like face came alive, his features contorting in a mixture of shock and hatred.</p><p>A seductive glint entered the Azure Fox Saint King’s smile, her eyes radiating a strange light as she gazed into Mo Xingdao's eyes, her voice a hypnotic whisper reaching his mind.</p><p>“Surrender!  Follow me, and I will spare your life…”</p><p>Her jade finger touched Mo Xingdao’s forehead.</p><p>His eyes flickered, then filled with terror and madness.  He stared at the Azure Fox Saint King, as if determined to etch his enemy into his memory before death, a deathly aura clouding his eyes.</p><p>The Azure Fox Saint King frowned, slightly surprised.  The moonlight intensified, pouring into her fingertip, surging into Mo Xingdao's body, but it was too late.</p><p>The deathly aura signified Mo Xingdao's fading life.  In his final moment, he chose death rather than submission to the Azure Fox Saint King.</p><p>Falling into her hands, becoming her puppet, eternally controlled by his enemies—a fate worse than death!</p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p>Qin Sang, racing towards the battlefield, heard a scream and felt a sudden lightness on her shoulder.</p><p>The scream came from the kingfisher.</p><p>The bird-shaped being slumped sideways and plummeted.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. After extracting the information, the bird fell silent. The battlefield situation seemed extremely critical; Mo Xingdao couldn't contact him.</p><p>The bird's sudden fall… could it be…?</p><p>Qin Sang stopped abruptly, raising a hand to catch the falling bird.  To his surprise, as it fell, the bird grew larger and its form twisted.</p><p>Its wings elongated into arms, and its bird head transformed into a human head.</p><p>In an instant, the bird changed into a dark-skinned humanoid creature, its aura completely different. It let out a roar filled with hatred, "The Qinghu Saint King killed my true body!"</p><p>True body?</p><p>Qin Sang was momentarily confused, examining the dark-skinned creature. A thought struck him.</p><p>At the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, Qin Sang had witnessed Mo Xingdao's puppet firsthand, the puppet crystal even obtained from him.</p><p>After reuniting with Mo Xingdao, Qin Sang sensed a difference in the puppet's aura.</p><p>But Mo Xingdao had declared his identity, and Qin Sang, having learned the conditions offered by the two Nascent Divinity cultivators from the Ganlu Chan Monastery, hadn't suspected anything.</p><p>Now, looking again, this creature resembled a puppet even more!</p><p>However, this puppet's aura was weak, only equivalent to a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Qin Sang vaguely guessed something, his surprise evident.</p><p>"In the Storm Realm, they and my true body puppet protected me during my tribulation. Using a secret technique that refines oneself into a half-puppet body to break through to Nascent Divinity! Rather than lingering, Mo would rather fight with all his might!"</p><p>A bitter tone laced Mo Xingdao's low voice.</p><p>Years ago, the two Nascent Divinity cultivators gave him two choices: soul fusion with a puppet or forcibly enduring the Heavenly Tribulation. He chose the latter.</p><p>Even becoming a half-puppet body was better than soul fusion.</p><p>With the tribulation secret technique, the protection of his puppet, superior soul-suppressing incense, and the full assistance of the human and demon kings, Mo Xingdao defied the heavens and succeeded in his tribulation!</p><p>Mo Xingdao is, as far as Qin Sang knew, the only person besides himself to successfully survive the Heavenly Tribulation's demonic sound, without the protection of the Jade Buddha.</p><p>However, Mo Xingdao hadn't anticipated that soul fusion with a puppet seemed to be his destiny; he ultimately couldn't reverse fate.</p><p>When thrown into this realm, he was exploited by the Qinghu Saint King. His true body puppet shielded him from a calamity, almost reduced to dust.  With difficulty, a small portion of the core essence was salvaged, taking a hundred years to recover to the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>Leaving his true body puppet with Qin Sang, and splitting off a soul fragment, was merely a precaution. Unexpectedly, the incident actually occurred.</p><p>Only, the unforeseen event didn't come from Hongyuzi, but from the Qinghu Saint King.</p><p>Qin Sang remained silent, unsure what to say.</p><p>In his heart, he admired Mo Xingdao, an admiration similar to that for Master Zhitan of Xitu. Knowing the path ahead was arduous, he still defied the heavens and succeeded.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's breath gradually stabilized, but he was incredibly weak. Looking at the silent Qin Sang, he asked, "Qin Daoyou, what do you plan to do next?"</p><p>"Do you intend to use me for revenge?"</p><p>Qin Sang scrutinized Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao said indifferently, "My cultivation of a thousand years is almost gone. How could I utilize Daoyou?  If Daoyou chooses to avoid the conflict, I will naturally help Daoyou obtain the Five Elements Crown to secure a place to live, enduring humiliation and waiting for a future opportunity!"</p><p>Qin Sang was also pondering.</p><p>The two demons' ambush was successful, killing Mo Xingdao. Would they continue to fight Hongyuzi to the death?</p><p>According to Mo Xingdao, Hongyuzi was unfathomable and still had fighting strength. Judging from the demons' battlefield arrangements, they aimed more to trap than to kill.</p><p>Of course, it wasn't impossible that the Qinghu Saint King wanted to control Mo Xingdao first before focusing on Hongyuzi.</p><p>"Daoyou, do you think the Qinghu Saint King has found the Five Elements Crown?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked thoughtfully.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's eyes flickered. The last person to see the Five Elements Crown was him, but the Qinghu Saint King's ability to ambush here, with such precise timing, indicated familiarity with the place; she must have been here more than once.</p><p>Perhaps she already found the Five Elements Crown!</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, "Daoyou mentioned earlier that in the Storm Realm, the Five Elements Crown's demonic soul was about to lose control.  For a hundred years, the demonic soul and the ancient demons have gradually merged, making it far different now. Coupled with the illusion's threat, it probably won't be easy to obtain…"</p><p>"You mean, the Qinghu Saint King wants to…"</p><p>Mo Xingdao guessed what Qin Sang meant.</p><p>Perhaps he wasn't the Qinghu Saint King's true target, merely collateral.</p><p>"If she found the Five Elements Crown, why wouldn't she obtain it herself? Why instead lure a late Nascent Divinity demon cultivator, taking advantage of Daoyou and Hongyuzi's arrival to ambush you first, triggering a great battle, just to subdue Daoyou?"</p><p>Qin Sang snorted coldly, "Moreover, given that vixen's nature, would she readily hand over such a readily obtainable treasure?"</p><p>Mo Xingdao felt a complex mix of emotions.</p><p>He had spent countless days with the Qinghu Saint King, understanding her too well.  Qin Sang's guess was likely true.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King didn't take him seriously, merely treating him as a pawn.</p><p>"Let's find the Five Elements Crown first!"</p><p>Qin Sang declared decisively, immediately changing direction. He sneered, "If that vixen hasn't found the Five Elements Crown, we'll obtain the treasure first, then go to the battlefield and reap the benefits. Hongyuzi should be able to hold out for a while. Otherwise, there should be a good show to watch!"</p><p>…</p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p>The Qinghu Saint King seized Mo Xingdao's corpse, sensing the absence of life. She snorted, openly breaking open Mo Xingdao's storage artifact; treasures scattered on the ground.</p><p>After a quick glance, the Qinghu Saint King immediately sent a voice transmission to Xia Hou: "The key isn't on him!"</p>
