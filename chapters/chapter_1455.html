<h1>Chapter 1447: A Heavenly Thunderbolt</h1><p>Chapter 1447: A Heavenly Thunderbolt</p><p>Many Nascent Soul cultivators were in the city.  It was impossible to determine how many Xuan Tian Palace cultivators were disguised among them.  We thought keeping an eye on the three elders would be enough.</p><p>They simply vanished before our very eyes!</p><p>“Master, forgive us!”</p><p>Two disciples were terrified at the sight.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren didn't even glance at them. He grabbed a shard of ice sculpture, his figure transforming into a black streak that shot into the air.  He surveyed the surroundings before silently disappearing.</p><p>“Junior Brother, gather the men and find the Xuan Tian Palace Law Enforcement disciples. I'll go help Master.”</p><p>One of the black-robed men whispered, quickly activating his flying artifact to give chase.</p><p>The other disappeared into the shadows.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Hun Mo Island.</p><p>Elder Mei and Elder Lan of Xuan Tian Palace were hidden beneath the sea, encased in an ice sphere.</p><p>They had already put some distance between themselves and Hun Mo Island.</p><p>This was not only because they feared Hun Mo Lao Ren interfering, but also because they were wary of the forces behind the Myriad Demons Conference.</p><p>Acting near Hun Mo Island, breaking the rules, and angering those people would bring consequences even if Xuan Tian Palace wasn't afraid of retaliation.  They would have to consider the long-term effects unless they wanted to stop sending disciples to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Over the years, countless incidents proved that these forces would retaliate fiercely against those who overstepped their boundaries.</p><p>Inside the thin ice sphere.</p><p>The two elders sat and stood.</p><p>Elder Mei gazed towards Hun Mo Island.</p><p>They had finally found the location of the sacred artifact and were about to return, yet she felt uneasy.</p><p>Elder Mei reviewed their preparations; there shouldn't have been any oversight.</p><p>Three ice sculptures created the illusion that they were still in the city.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren's attention was mostly occupied by the sudden appearance of the Great Saint Tian Peng. This arrangement was sufficient; adding more would only be counterproductive.</p><p>They didn't expect to deceive Hun Mo Lao Ren for long. Their goal was simply to buy time to retrieve the sacred artifact and prevent Hun Mo Lao Ren from interfering.</p><p>Once they succeeded, all Xuan Tian Palace disciples would unite, and even someone as powerful as Hun Mo Lao Ren would only be able to watch them leave.</p><p>There was nothing to worry about here.</p><p>To avoid alerting the enemy, everyone was ambushing outside Hun Mo Island.</p><p>At this moment, all the Nascent Soul elders of Xuan Tian Palace were scattered in all directions except the north, forming a dragnet.</p><p>The north was the inevitable path for Great Saint Tian Peng and the various demon kings to return. They didn't want to reveal their presence, attract powerful enemies, and risk accidents, so only one elder skilled in concealment techniques was stationed there.</p><p>If the person with the sacred artifact left from the north, they would wait until Great Saint Tian Peng was far away before making their move.</p><p>If it was from another direction, things would be much simpler.</p><p>To guard against the enemy circling back, the ambushing elders couldn’t act rashly.</p><p>They would use the ice key to sense the artifact's location and quickly converge on it. If they couldn't catch up, the elder in ambush would appear first to detain the target.</p><p>They could arrive within moments, ensuring success.</p><p>If the three of them combined were not a match for the opponent, the elders ambushing in other directions would have also arrived on the battlefield, making escape impossible!</p><p>However, Elder Mei thought this unlikely.</p><p>Even if that monster had incredible luck and broke through to mid-Nascent Soul stage, Elder Mei was confident in subduing him, unless the opponent was at the late Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>As her thoughts raced, Elder Mei noticed the ice key’s glow beginning to move.  “The exchange is over?”</p><p>The octagonal ice key, shaped like a piece of Xuan Ice, hovered in front of Elder Lan, flickering incessantly.</p><p>Elder Lan hummed, lightly grasping the ice key, his eyes closed.  “That person is taking a detour.”</p><p>This was within their expectations.</p><p>The two elders patiently watched the ice key. After a dazzling display of changes, the key’s indication pointed south!</p><p>“South!”</p><p>Elder Lan abruptly stood.</p><p>They had gambled wrong, guarding the direction opposite Xuan Tian Palace, the west side of Hun Mo Island.</p><p>Elder Mei moved faster, her fingers rapidly tapping the void.  A series of cracking sounds followed as the thin ice forming the ice sphere shattered into countless fragments, flying everywhere.</p><p>In an instant, these fragments gathered around them, transforming into a mass of cold air that enveloped the two and propelled them through the air.</p><p>Not long after flying.</p><p>Elder Lan suddenly exclaimed, “Not good! That person’s escape speed is incredible!”</p><p>They practiced Xuan Tian Palace's top-tier ice escape technique, unrivaled in the cultivation world, yet the opponent was even faster!</p><p>Elder Mei's face darkened.  “Shi Xue is guarding the south, have her hold them off! She’s already at the peak of the early stage, stuck at a bottleneck for years. Even against a mid-Nascent Soul cultivator, she can hold her own.”</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Myriad Demons City.</p><p>Qin Sang left the city without incident, and immediately sensed several powerful Yuan Ying cultivators near Demon Island. Their auras were undisguised and imposing, like guardians stationed in all directions.</p><p>“Are these Yuan Ying cultivators hired by the forces behind the Wan Mo Assembly?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.  These experts, along with the Demon Island Elder, meant few dared to cause trouble on Demon Island. However, their protection only extended to the immediate vicinity.  Any conflict beyond that area would be met with indifference.</p><p>Qin Sang remained wary of these Yuan Ying cultivators; any one of them might be in league with the Demon Island Elder. He concealed his aura, took a circuitous route out of the island, and used his enhanced senses and spiritual perception to ensure he wasn't being followed. Once he was out of sight, he sped away.</p><p>“I’ve obtained the Seven Masters Buddha Seal and the materials to enhance the Jinchen Sword.  Unfortunately, I haven't gathered all the necessary spiritual materials for the Ascension Ceremony.  It seems I won't find the Yuan Yin Water and Yin冥土 outside Baihua Valley. No wonder Valley Master Mu was so patient and didn't try to contact me. I wonder how many Wan Ling Fruits this will cost…”</p><p>Qin Sang remained vigilant while considering the gains and losses of this trade fair.</p><p>“This went smoothly enough. The Demon Island Elder didn’t play any tricks, whether he was unwilling or unable to. The major forces behind the Wan Mo Assembly are not to be trifled with; they can restrain the Demon Island Elder.  My backup plans were unnecessary, wasting a formation array and three alchemy formulas.”</p><p>Shortly after, Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed. His spirit butterfly also sounded an alarm. Thanks to his powerful spiritual sense, he detected the anomaly before the butterfly did. This was partly because the other party’s concealment techniques were not very sophisticated; otherwise, at such a distance, spiritual sense alone would not have been sufficient, making the butterfly's role indispensable.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Qin Sang cursed his bad luck, while also feeling puzzled. He hadn't sensed any tracking markers. Why could this person pinpoint his direction of departure?</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang – the mysterious ice box in the Qianjun Ring.  However, he didn't intend to waste words. Regardless of the person's identity or intentions, hiding in the shadows was clearly hostile.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang pretended to be unaware, chanted the Summoning Thunder spell, and unleashed a heavenly thunderbolt!</p>
