<h1>Chapter 461: A Man of the Mundane World</h1><p>Under the elegant moonlight, Qin Sang was stunned.</p><p>How could such a woman appear in the mortal world?</p><p>Witnessing the world's tumultuous changes yet remaining detached, residing in a moonlit palace with only a flickering lamp for company—that should be her destiny.</p><p>In the presence of this woman, Qin Sang felt a sense of shame.</p><p>He was but a man of the mundane world.</p><p>Having witnessed Qingluan transform from a wooden carving to a living being and back again, Qin Sang wondered if this woman might also be a puppet carved by Granny Jing.</p><p>But after seeing the woman in person, he wavered.</p><p>What powerful puppetry would be required to create such a realistic, such perfect being?</p><p>“It is I.”</p><p>The woman nodded gently, confirming her identity as Granny Jing.</p><p>Her voice had changed too. Unlike her aloof demeanor, it was relatively soft, yet still carried a hint of coldness and loneliness, like the cool light cast by the solitary moon in the night sky.</p><p>“Is it really you?”</p><p>Qin Sang asked in surprise. “Was it all a disguise before? Is this your true appearance?”</p><p>Granny Jing didn't explain, but instead posed a rhetorical question with a detached tone, “It's just a shell. What's the difference between the me before and the me now?”</p><p>Alright, I'm just a common man.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly to himself and refrained from further questioning. He watched as Granny Jing walked out from beneath the jade pillar, slightly raising her head to gaze at the towering Sky-Reaching Peak.</p><p>“Do you want to take a look outside your Grandmaster's cave?”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat. He looked up, following Granny Jing's gaze, but saw only swirling white clouds.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang's body tensed as Granny Jing carried him directly upwards. The wind whistled past his ears, and Shaohua Mountain rapidly receded from his view.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the clouds were within reach.</p><p>The cloud layer was only halfway up Shaohua Mountain. Beyond the clouds was a snow-capped peak, its summit almost piercing the celestial winds.</p><p>With Qin Sang's eyesight, he could vaguely make out a stone gate carved into the cliff face at the peak.</p><p>Intricately complex runes adorned the stone gate, shimmering with a mysterious light that Qin Sang couldn't decipher.</p><p>Howling winds and swirling snow couldn't penetrate within thirty feet of the stone gate.</p><p>“Is this enough?”</p><p>Granny Jing glanced at Qin Sang.</p><p>If I say it's not enough, are you going to push the door open?</p><p>Qin Sang smiled wryly.  He realized for the first time how fragile his heart was, unable to withstand such shocks. “Enough! Enough! I believe you…”</p><p>…</p><p>Turbulent Island Waters.</p><p>Qin Sang sat in his cave, holding a bundle of silk threads in one hand and the wooden carving Granny Jing had given him in the other, examining it repeatedly.</p><p>Everything that had just transpired felt like a dream, so unreal. After a round trip to his sect and a glimpse of his Nascent Soul ancestor's cave, he only came to his senses upon returning to his own cave.</p><p>Upon returning to Turbulent Island Waters, Granny Jing departed, leaving him only the Star Spirit Net and this wooden carving.</p><p>Before, Qin Sang had thought the carving was so lifelike, so perfect.</p><p>Only after seeing the real person did he realize that it didn't even capture a fraction of her essence.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was restless, plagued by a single question.</p><p>Just what was Granny Jing’s cultivation level?</p><p>Even someone as powerful as Serpent Witch wouldn't be able to come and go from Shaohua Mountain without fear of being detected by Duke Dongyang, right?</p><p>There was such a vast difference between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core.</p><p>The gap between Golden Core and Nascent Soul must be even greater, like a chasm.  There were so many Golden Core cultivators in the Small Cold Region, but how many Nascent Soul Grandmasters?</p><p>Could Granny Jing be a Nascent Soul Grandmaster in hiding?</p><p>Qin Sang was startled by his own thought, his expression flickering.</p><p>Even without any benefits, Qin Sang would be delighted to establish a positive connection with a Nascent Soul Grandmaster.  Moreover, Granny Jing had promised to help him acquire the maximum number of Star Origin Stones in exchange for the Snow Spirit Lotus and Iris Flower.</p><p>However, Qin Sang also understood that this was a transaction. Once the matter was concluded, they would be even.</p><p>Favor wasn't so easily earned.</p><p>With his current cultivation, he held no value to a cultivator of Granny Jing’s level.</p><p>Cold and indifferent, aloof and distant—that was Granny Jing's true temperament. The old woman in Question Moon Market was merely a disguise for her travels in the mortal world.</p><p>As for why Granny Jing lived in seclusion in Question Moon Market, Qin Sang dared not ask.</p><p>“Sky-Reaching Peak…”</p><p>Qin Sang silently glanced towards the southeast, cleared his mind of all distractions, and entered meditative cultivation.</p><p>…</p><p>Once again, he was awakened by the token.</p><p>Qin Sang abruptly sat up, drawing the spirit stones into his palm.  Just as he was about to stride out, he paused, reaching to his chest where the wooden carving was hidden.</p><p>Granny Jing had instructed him to always carry the carving on his person, not in a storage pouch.</p><p>Fortunately, no matter how one looked at it, it was just an ordinary, unremarkable peachwood carving.  If anyone asked, Qin Sang could easily explain it away.</p><p>Cultivation wasn’t about severing ties with the mortal world or purging oneself of emotions and desires. Cultivators were merely mortals who wielded great power, at least those at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p>Who didn’t have something to cherish?</p><p>After seeing how Granny Jing used her wooden carving, Qin Sang recalled the time he had purchased a peachwood sword from her during his dealings with the He sisters. It was intended as a form of payment to Granny Jing.</p><p>Like the wooden carvings of Qingluan and Granny Jing’s transformed self, Qin Sang couldn't detect anything unusual about the peachwood sword.</p><p>Could it also possess great power?</p><p>Stories of powerful cultivators traveling the mortal world, encountering destined individuals, and on a whim, bestowing opportunities were commonplace.</p><p>Then, when the destined individual faced danger, the true purpose of the opportunity would be revealed, saving their life and propelling them to greater heights.</p><p>Such tales were widespread in the cultivation world.</p><p>Unfortunately, Qin Sang was overthinking it.  Granny Jing had explicitly stated that everything in her shop was ordinary, and the sword Qin Sang had purchased was no exception.</p><p>However, these carvings were made using Granny Jing’s unique technique. Perhaps their only use was to inspire mortal carving masters to improve their skills.</p><p>After concealing the wooden carving, Qin Sang took a deep breath, exited his cave, and flew towards Stargazing Island on a cloud.</p><p>He encountered Senior Brother Rong on the way.</p><p>Senior Brother Rong’s expression was grave, and he wasn't in the mood for conversation.</p><p>They exchanged brief greetings and flew towards Stargazing Island in silence.</p><p>They arrived at Stargazing Island and waited a short while before all thirty-three cultivators gathered. The island was silent as everyone took their positions, none inclined to chat.</p><p>After a brief pause, the depths of Stargazing Island suddenly brightened, and five streaks of light flew towards them.</p><p>The first to arrive was Serpent Witch.</p><p>Besides Serpent Witch, Deputy Island Master Xiao was also among them. The remaining three were all late-stage Golden Core cultivators.</p><p>“I and Fellow Daoist Xiao will go ahead. Gather the other Daoists and follow,” Serpent Witch’s voice echoed.</p><p>“As you command!”</p><p>The other three dispersed swiftly, flying towards the righteous, demonic, and rogue cultivator factions.</p><p>“Come aboard!”</p><p>Serpent Witch waved her hand, and the snake bracelet on her wrist detached, transforming into a giant python.  Its vertical pupils emitted a chilling gaze as it swept over Qin Sang and the others.</p><p>Everyone felt a chill down their spines. They carefully summoned their flying light and landed on the giant python's back with utmost caution.</p>
