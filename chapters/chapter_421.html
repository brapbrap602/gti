<h1>Chapter 414: A Snap of the Fingers</h1><p>After settling Ning Youwei and his mother, Qin Sang traveled alone to Boundless Valley. The items in his shop at Azure Sun Market weren't particularly valuable, so he wasn't worried about them running off with his money.  Although the Ebony Wood Sword had transformed into a sword embryo and was unusable, Qin Sang still possessed numerous protective talismans.</p><p>With Sun Xin's map, Qin Sang spent most of his time on the second level of Boundless Valley, seeking out and challenging妖兽. The second level was rarely visited, and due to his cautious approach, he gradually adapted to the training environment within the valley, which wasn't much different from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>After a period of training, or once he'd gathered enough spiritual materials, he would return to Azure Sun Market to focus on cultivation, refining techniques, and studying the jade slips. Finally, he'd apply his insights to the Ebony Wood Sword, which proved highly effective, significantly reducing the time it took for the sword to absorb energy. He even felt a stronger connection with the sword. Although this somewhat affected his cultivation, the gains were greater.</p><p>…</p><p>Twenty-eight years passed in a flash. ‘Sword Pavilion’ had gained a degree of renown in Azure Sun Market.</p><p>Initially, the small shop was inconspicuous, displaying only low-grade talismans. The shop assistant was quiet and reserved, and the customers were mostly cultivators below the sixth level of Qi Refining.  However, the fair prices attracted a number of regular customers.</p><p>As Qin Sang’s refining skills improved, the quality of the talismans on display gradually increased.  Other types of talismans became less common, eventually replaced almost entirely by various spirit swords. The shop became a veritable forest of swords, living up to its name, ‘Sword Pavilion’.</p><p>This unique specialization made Sword Pavilion stand out in the market, its reputation spreading and attracting numerous cultivators. Many cultivators visiting Azure Sun Market would make a point of stopping by Sword Pavilion to see if any new swords were available. While not quite reaching a frenzy, the items sold well.</p><p>The demand even began to outstrip supply when Qin Sang started incorporating Cold Gold into his spirit swords to enhance their quality.  This was thirteen years after his arrival in Azure Sun Market.  Throughout those years, he had continuously studied refining, crafting large batches of low-grade talismans for practice.  He also achieved a reasonable success rate with higher-grade talismans.  The shop gradually became profitable, although it didn't generate a large income.</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Sang had plundered Yu Hua's storage pouch, providing him with ample resources to sustain himself for so long. However, he encountered a bottleneck when he attempted to craft top-grade talismans.</p><p>Several consecutive failures incurred costs that even Qin Sang couldn't bear.  The Stone-Heart Fire generated by the spirit array was no longer sufficient for refining top-grade talismans.  He had to pay exorbitant fees to rent access to the underground fire veins in the market. Not all underground fire veins were suitable for refining and alchemy; stable flames were required, supplemented by various spirit arrays and restrictions to control the veins.  It was difficult for Qin Sang to find a suitable location on his own. These spirit stones were a necessary expense.</p><p>Even more painful was the significant loss of precious spiritual materials with each failure.  Learning from these costly mistakes, Qin Sang realized he couldn't continue this reckless approach.  He wouldn't have unlimited resources to squander. After careful consideration, he decided on a different strategy.</p><p>Refining high-grade talismans and then enhancing them with precious spiritual materials would be less challenging. Once he could create spirit swords comparable to top-grade talismans and had accumulated sufficient experience, he would try again.  This approach stemmed from the insights of the Wu family ancestors.  Generations of Wu family ancestors had dedicated themselves to refining, but limited by their talent, few had broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage. They had used this method to improve their refining skills.</p><p>Qin Sang then turned his attention to the Cold Gold. The Cold Gold extracted from the Cold Gold ore was one of the best spiritual materials in his possession, and using it on low-grade talismans was wasteful.  However, for the sake of the Ebony Wood Sword, Qin Sang disregarded this concern.  Even so, it took several failures before he gradually mastered the properties of Cold Gold.</p><p>Incorporating Cold Gold into talismans not only imbued them with extreme cold properties but also increased their durability. Talismans with Cold Gold were instantly superior to others.  Once word spread that someone had acquired a Cold Gold talisman from Sword Pavilion, the shop's reputation soared, and customers flocked to it.</p><p>More people began paying attention to Sword Pavilion, including various sects and merchant guilds.  By observing the changes in the talismans sold over the years, it wasn't difficult to deduce that the owner of Sword Pavilion was likely a skilled refiner.  Achieving such proficiency in just over a decade suggested either exceptional talent or a strong family background.</p><p>Some guilds attempted to recruit the shop owner, but the owner remained elusive. Few had ever seen them in person.  Messages left with the shop assistant went unanswered. Even those who did meet Qin Sang were politely refused.</p><p>At this point, Qin Sang realized he had gone too far.  He was using his identity as a refiner to conceal his true origins, but he didn't want to attract the attention of powerful forces, as this could lead to unforeseen complications.</p><p>It was at this time that Ning Youwei suggested purchasing talismans from elsewhere and reselling them at a profit or diversifying into other businesses to maintain the shop's operations. Ning Youwei was now a middle-aged man of forty with a goatee. His cultivation had stalled at the fourth level of Qi Refining. He had long since given up on pursuing immortality, married, had children, and lived a peaceful life, no different from ordinary people in the market.</p><p>Qin Sang only returned from his training to refine batches of talismans, which quickly sold out due to the shop's popularity.  The shop remained closed at other times, leading to Ning Youwei's suggestion.  For over a decade, Ning Youwei had diligently served Qin Sang, demonstrating maturity and never making a mistake.  Qin Sang was indifferent to the shop and intended to transfer ownership to Ning Youwei as a reward for his years of loyalty, so he agreed to the proposal.</p><p>In the following years, Qin Sang rarely crafted low-grade spirit swords, focusing instead on studying the jade slips.  The high-quality spirit swords he crafted were no longer sold at Sword Pavilion but were instead traded with a few trusted merchant guilds, allowing him to remain behind the scenes.  Ning Youwei, with full authority, made his own decisions, and the business stabilized after several adjustments.</p><p>The disappointed regular customers, unwilling to give up, frequently visited the shop in the beginning. However, after a long period without seeing any new spirit swords on display, they became disheartened and speculated that the refiner behind the shop had likely left Azure Sun Market to wander the world.  The former glory of Sword Pavilion, like a fleeting flower, had lasted only a few short years before fading away, leaving many to lament its demise.</p><p>As his skills deepened, Qin Sang finally succeeded in crafting a top-grade talisman! The success rate remained low, but the rewards were immense. He could finally understand the words of the Core Formation cultivator from the Hollow Spirit Sect recorded in the jade slips.</p><p>In his twenty-first year in Azure Sun Market, the Ebony Wood Sword successfully absorbed the Blood Devil Ginseng. Subsequently, Qin Sang refined the Blood Drop Ghost Mushroom and the bottle of Qi Gathering Pills.  His third killing talisman formed, and his cultivation smoothly advanced, allowing him to reach the late stage of Foundation Establishment!</p>
