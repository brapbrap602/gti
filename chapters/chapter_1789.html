<h1>Chapter 1780: The Clarity Pill</h1><p>“I'd like to hear the details,” Qin Sang said, already having a guess.</p><p>True Person Zhijian’s following words were indeed as he expected.</p><p>“If Fellow Daoist's ancestors left any legacy, you can go directly to the Celestial Court. The Celestial Court values its reputation and generally won't make things difficult. For example, if your sect had a profound connection with the Celestial Court in ancient times, or if your ancestors made contributions in the great wars between the two sides.”</p><p>Speaking of this, True Person Zhijian didn't pause, continuing to speak. If Qin Sang came from such a sect, there would be no need to consult him.</p><p>“If you go to them yourself, the Celestial Court will give you two choices. If you are close to the Celestial Court and willing to be dispatched, it's not difficult to obtain a Dharma Decree.”</p><p>“Wouldn't that make one a servant of the Celestial Court?” Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't believe that the Celestial Court would treat them as one of their own.  Human nature being what it is, regardless of time, place, sect, or school, there are always distinctions between close and distant relationships.  Once faced with a life-or-death mission, the Celestial Court would definitely think of these people first.</p><p>Subjected to others, how can one talk about freedom and ease?</p><p>True Person Zhijian explained, “Those who can cultivate to this level possess superior character and talent. The Celestial Court wouldn't really treat these people as servants.  Under normal circumstances, the Celestial Court generally doesn't interfere. I've heard that the Celestial Court's Dharma Decrees come with generous rewards. If one is unwilling to respond when a Dharma Decree arrives, they won't be forced. But once war breaks out between the Celestial Court and the Ghost Country, I'm afraid…”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, able to imagine the scenario.</p><p>Nascent Soul cultivators could become Lords Protector in the Celestial Court. They wouldn't lightly send such experts to their deaths.</p><p>Currently, the Celestial Court and the Ghost Country were only in a standoff, still exercising restraint.</p><p>But no one could say for sure when the current situation would be broken.</p><p>If one side were to launch a war, the Ju Mountain Range would instantly be dragged into the flames of war. This had happened before.</p><p>“If one doesn't want to be attached to the Celestial Court, what then?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>True Person Zhijian only said four words, “Trade life for a Decree!”</p><p>Qin Sang exhaled softly, thinking as expected, just like the Celestial Court's Dharma Decree at Crane Cry Mountain—contributing to the Celestial Court to exchange for Ascension qualification.</p><p>However…</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts took a turn.  “The Celestial Court shouldn't send people to their deaths, right?”</p><p>Cultivators in this world generally Ascend when their cultivation reaches completion, nearing a breakthrough.</p><p>In other words, Ju Mountain Range cultivators would need to contact the Celestial Court at the peak of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>At that time, they wouldn't possess Nascent Soul Grandmaster level strength.</p><p>The Celestial Court couldn't possibly give them Dharma Decrees at the Nascent Soul Grandmaster level. Otherwise, what would be the difference between that and extortion and murder?</p><p>Unexpectedly, True Person Zhijian actually shook his head slightly.  Under Qin Sang’s surprised gaze, he said, "As far as I know, these Dharma Decrees are generally of two types. The first is only achievable by Soul Severing Grandmasters. The second type is less dangerous, but often requires hundreds of years, perhaps even several centuries of dedication, during which one cannot be distracted. There's also the possibility of failure. They still need to prepare for their breakthrough, so how much time can they afford to squander? Those unwilling to be bound by the Celestial Court are all proud and ambitious individuals. They generally seek their own breakthrough first, and then respond to the Celestial Court's call for Ascension."</p><p>The Celestial Court was ruthless!</p><p>Those who, for the sake of freedom, dared to break through before Ascending were also extraordinary.</p><p>Breaking through to the Nascent Soul Grandmaster stage was as different from breaking through to the Golden Core stage as heaven and earth.  The Nascent Soul Grandmaster stage has Heavenly Tribulations!</p><p>Both the Three Disasters Tribulation and the Heart Demon Tribulation could be fatal.</p><p>Undergoing tribulation before Ascension, beyond the protective ability of one's own altar, with unstable True Essence, passing the Three Disasters Tribulation would be extremely difficult.</p><p>However, this place was better than the deadly Storm Realm.  The Six Heavens' Ancient Qi's influence on the mind was subtle, unlike the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound, which had an immediate effect. Therefore, the power of the Heart Demon Tribulation wouldn't be intensified because of this.</p><p>Even so, without strong self-confidence and strength, no one would dare to do this.</p><p>But even if one successfully broke through, they would have to suppress their True Essence like him, greatly reducing their strength. How could they complete a Nascent Soul Grandmaster level Dharma Decree?</p><p>Qin Sang asked this question.</p><p>“Upon responding to the call, the Celestial Court will bestow a Clarity Pill. During the duration of the pill's power, one can recover to their peak strength, unaffected by the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi,” True Person Zhijian's tone shifted, suddenly smiling, “In this matter, Force Cultivators like Fellow Daoist who cultivate the Dragon and Tiger Altar are actually the least worried.”</p><p>In a flash, Qin Sang understood the reason.</p><p>Force Cultivators cultivate their physical bodies. Their only fear is mental confusion. The Dragon and Tiger Altar's function is to protect the mind.</p><p>They could break through without worry before Ascending, their strength wouldn't be affected, and their chances of surviving the tribulation were high.</p><p>After breaking through, Force Cultivators could still maintain powerful combat strength, while others had to suppress their True Essence to the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>This was also one of the reasons why many cultivators chose the Dragon and Tiger Altar instead of cultivating the orthodox Daoist path.</p><p>“There's actually such a miraculous medicine as the Clarity Pill!”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed.</p><p>The Daoist sects were deeply rooted in this world and had certainly discovered many ways to deal with the Six Heavens' Ancient Qi.  Dharma Decrees were the most complete system.</p><p>The Clarity Pill was an alchemical pill. Its power couldn't last, and each person was limited to one. Its value must be extraordinary.</p><p>Qin Sang had travelled to so many places, yet he hadn't seen it for sale anywhere.</p><p>True Person Zhijian continued, “Moreover, compared to Fellow Daoists of the other two schools, the Dharma Decrees you receive should be easier.”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>Listening to True Person Zhijian’s tone, it seemed to be because of the differences in the Dharma Decrees of the three major schools.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Qin Sang’s expression turned solemn, and he asked in a deep voice, “What if I don't want to be granted a Dragon and Tiger Altar Dharma Decree?”</p><p>True Person Zhijian, with his sharp mind, instantly grasped the deeper meaning in Qin Sang’s words. His gaze suddenly focused, and he asked in surprise, “Are you a Spell Cultivator?”</p><p>Of the three major Daoist schools, the Golden Seal Altar and the Warhost Altar were essentially Spell Cultivators who cultivated True Essence.</p><p>The Dragon and Tiger Altar was unique. It couldn't stabilize True Essence but could increase the cultivation speed of the Force path.</p><p>For the Dragon and Tiger Altar, one couldn't have both.</p><p>Cultivators could only choose one Dharma Decree of the same rank at each realm.</p><p>Because of its unique Dharma Decree, the Dragon and Tiger Altar couldn't stabilize True Essence and had to continue down the Force path.</p><p>Unless one changed schools and switched to a Daoist Dharma Decree, starting from scratch, it was impossible to cultivate both.</p><p>Although the first two schools could also cultivate the body, firstly, their own cultivation was already difficult, and secondly, without the Dragon and Tiger Altar's enhancement, the results were not as good as true Force Cultivators, so dual cultivators were very rare.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang’s embarkation on the path of body cultivation was also a twist of fate.  The *Heavenly Demon Body Tempering Scripture* had stagnated throughout the entire Nascent Soul stage. After reaching Nascent Soul Grandmaster, he first prepared to travel east to the Return to Ruin, and then, due to the threat of the Heavenly Tribulation, he was forced to pick up this cultivation method again.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly but didn't explicitly state whether he was originally a Spell Cultivator or a Force Cultivator who changed schools to become a Spell Cultivator.</p><p>“No wonder Fellow Daoist’s poison skills are so remarkable,” True Person Zhijian shook his head repeatedly, seemingly lamenting his own lack of discernment.  “Not cultivating the Dragon and Tiger Altar is also a good thing. Fellow Daoist should have noticed that the Dragon and Tiger Altar is not the orthodox Daoist path and won't go far.”</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred.  “I've heard of it, but I'm not sure... Is it because of the Demonic Arts?”</p><p>The rumors among cultivators were quite specific, saying that the Dragon and Tiger Altar Dharma Decree was created by imitating Demonic Arts.</p><p>This world was clearly more suitable for Force Cultivators, and there were also many cultivators practicing the Dragon and Tiger Altar, yet the true disciples of the Daoist sects sneered at it.</p><p>Something out of the ordinary must have a demon behind it!</p><p>Qin Sang had long speculated about this.</p><p>"Indeed," True Person Zhijian nodded.  "Demonic creatures are gifted with innate abilities. Their bloodline power can enhance their Demonic Arts.  We humans don't have bloodline divine abilities, how can we compare to them? Although it's unclear where the limit of the Dragon and Tiger Altar lies, there are almost no True People who have cultivated the Dragon and Tiger Altar among the Lords Protector of the Celestial Court. This speaks volumes."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered upon hearing this.</p><p>Guardian Deities of the Altar weren't something one could summon and then rest easy.</p><p>The altar was not only a place of safety but also a palace for storing the spirit. An unstable altar meant an unsettled deity. This was the greatest hidden danger of the Dragon and Tiger Altar!</p><p>“Fellow Daoist seeks a Daoist Dharma Decree. If you don't want to be controlled by the Daoist sects, you must plan carefully,” True Person Zhijian advised.</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood up and bowed.</p><p>If he put in the effort, he could also inquire about these things, but it would definitely be mixed with information that was difficult to distinguish between true and false, unlike what True Person Zhijian had said so thoroughly.</p><p>Knowing this, he could act with a clear purpose in the future.</p><p>“Why be so formal, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>True Person Zhijian waved his hands repeatedly and told Qin Sang an address.  “The Celestial Court’s two academies have specifically dispatched a True Person for this matter, Dharma name Zhan Gui, who is in secluded cultivation on a spirit island in the northern part of Star Island's Immortal Lake. When Fellow Daoist visits True Person Zhan Gui, you might as well inform me.”</p><p>“Did Fellow Daoist Ascend through this True Person Zhan Gui?” Qin Sang memorized the location of the spirit island.</p><p>True Person Zhijian hummed in agreement. “I've met True Person Zhan Gui a few times. I may not be able to pull strings, but he shouldn’t make things difficult for Fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Qin Sang thought, "I need to make some preparations first. I estimate it will take a few years before I can respond to the call."</p><p>The Daoist Dharma Decrees varied in difficulty. What kind of mission he received was entirely up to this True Person Zhan Gui. Having someone to recommend him was definitely not a bad thing.</p><p>“It's fine, I won’t be leaving Sword Heart Island anytime soon.”</p><p>Having settled on this matter, Qin Sang stayed on Sword Heart Island for a few more days.</p><p>Above the vast water surface, two figures flew through the air—Qin Sang and True Person Zhijian.</p><p>The two flew north, neither fast nor slow, talking as they went.</p><p>“The two Fellow Daoists are on Gloomy Bamboo Island, three hundred miles away. They should have received the message and are waiting for us on the island,” True Person Zhijian pointed north.</p><p>They were now going to meet True Person Zhijian’s friends, both said to be Nascent Soul Grandmasters.</p><p>“The two Fellow Daoists’ Dharma names are Gu Yun and You Huang respectively. True Person You Huang is a female cultivator, and Gloomy Bamboo Island is her cultivation grounds. Neither of them are aloof individuals…”</p><p>True Person Zhijian briefly introduced their identities.</p><p>Qin Sang took note and inconspicuously glanced at True Person Zhijian. He felt that this person’s introduction of these two to him wasn’t simply for them to get acquainted but had another purpose.</p><p>Before long, the two descended from the sky, landing on a delicate spirit island filled with flowers and bamboo.</p><p>Several beautiful women respectfully greeted them, bowing and leading them to True Person You Huang’s cave dwelling, where they met the two True People.</p><p>True Person You Huang looked to be only eighteen or nineteen years old, with a petite figure, bright almond-shaped eyes, and a smile that curved like a crescent moon, resembling a charming young girl.</p><p>What caught Qin Sang’s attention the most was the other person, True Person Gu Yun.</p><p>True Person Gu Yun was tall and slender, standing straight as a pine tree. He was unexpectedly a Force Cultivator, and he didn’t conceal it. His Qi and blood were exceptionally thick. Even though Qin Sang had been tempered by the Heavenly Tribulation, he felt inferior.</p><p>True Person Zhijian introduced the three of them. They exchanged greetings and took their seats according to their host and guest status.</p><p>Attendants brought forth immortal fruits and fine nectar, all rare delicacies, their fragrance filling the air, making their mouths water.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't help but drink a few more cups.</p><p>To Qin Sang’s surprise, True Person Zhijian seemed to have genuinely arranged for them to become acquainted.</p><p>The group chatted merrily during the feast.</p><p>Sometimes they talked about the secrets of the Daoist sects, and Qin Sang just listened quietly.</p><p>Sometimes they discussed Daoist techniques, and only then would Qin Sang carefully choose his words, cautiously concealing his identity as someone from the outer realms.</p><p>They didn't finish until late at night.</p><p>True Person You Huang warmly urged them to stay, and True Person Gu Yun and True Person Zhijian planned to stay for a few more days, but Qin Sang, with his heart set on the treasure fragments, rose and excused himself.</p><p>“Calling on friends during breaks in cultivation, carefree and content, quite leisurely…”</p><p>Qin Sang flew out of Gloomy Bamboo Island, this thought surfacing in his mind.</p><p>Looking back on the eight hundred years he had lived, such leisurely times were few and far between.</p><p>"After obtaining a Dharma Decree, I'll find a cave dwelling, make a few friends, and we can look out for each other in case of war. Usually, I can focus on secluded cultivation.  That doesn't seem bad..."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>In the Storm Realm, he was always pushed around by various events. Due to his lack of talent, he had to fight for certain opportunities.</p><p>Now he was a Nascent Soul Grandmaster, not very old, and his cultivation talent had been compensated for. Ordinary treasures couldn’t catch his eye. Why bother running around everywhere?</p><p>Of course, this didn't mean he would slack off.</p><p>"I'll see Fellow Daoist off."</p><p>A voice came from behind, and True Person Zhijian flew up.</p><p>"What does Fellow Daoist think of them?" True Person Zhijian asked.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, puzzled.  "They are both outstanding individuals."</p><p>No matter which world, breaking through to the Nascent Soul Grandmaster realm was no simple feat.</p><p>At this moment, True Person Zhijian finally revealed the truth, "I invited Fellow Daoist here with ulterior motives."</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at him, not surprised at all.</p><p>“For these past years, I’ve been preparing for a major undertaking, requiring entry into the Demonic Wasteland. You Huang and Gu Yun are both helpers I’ve invited.  Speaking of which, this matter is also related to the Celestial Court. I previously thought Fellow Daoist might be from a Daoist palace or temple, and I know Fellow Daoist is a trustworthy person.  If I could persuade Fellow Daoist, not only would you be a reliable ally, but some information I’ve been unable to ascertain could also be investigated through Fellow Daoist," True Person Zhijian revealed the whole story without reservation.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head. "Unfortunately, I'm not."</p><p>"However, I still want to invite Fellow Daoist," True Person Zhijian said sincerely. "If this matter succeeds, not only will you receive generous rewards, but it can also directly secure Ascension qualification for Fellow Daoist.  Moreover, if we join forces and look out for each other, it's safer than Fellow Daoist going alone."</p><p>Qin Sang was slightly startled. He hadn't displayed his true strength in front of True Person Zhijian.</p><p>Generally speaking, before Ascending, one's strength was definitely inferior to someone with a Dharma Decree.</p><p>True Person Zhijian’s invitation to him seemed to stem from a desire to offer protection, thanks to the goodwill established during their two encounters.</p><p>Before Qin Sang could reply, True Person Zhijian continued, "Because there’s still one matter that hasn't been clarified, we are also waiting for news. We should be able to confirm it soon. I'll explain the whole story to Fellow Daoist then.  Fellow Daoist doesn't need to rush to reply. You can visit True Person Zhan Gui first and compare the difficulty of the Daoist Dharma Decree before making a decision. Even if Fellow Daoist decides to respond to the call, if there's anything I can do to help, I will do my utmost to assist!"</p><p>This effectively gave Qin Sang two choices.</p><p>What True Person Zhijian was going to do was definitely more dangerous, but the advantage was that they could look out for each other.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and nodded slightly.  "As Fellow Daoist suggests. I should be visiting True Person Zhan Gui within three to five years. We can discuss it further then."</p><p>"Good!"</p><p>True Person Zhijian stopped his flight.</p><p>Qin Sang bowed slightly, then steered his escaping light southward, returning to the City in a Pot.</p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>
