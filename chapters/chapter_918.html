<h1>Chapter 910: Two Years</h1><p>Chapter 910: Two Years</p><p>Soon, another Eagle King was slain.</p><p>Leaderless, the corrupted winged eagles panicked and fled Poison Island.</p><p>Qin Sang only eliminated the greater demons (妖灵期 and above), sparing the lesser ones. He instead confined them, planning to raise them on several mountaintops, maintaining the illusion that Poison Island remained unchanged.</p><p>Afterwards, he located the island's spirit vein, nodding thoughtfully.</p><p>"Excellent! The two Eagle Kings' nests are ideally situated on the spirit vein; perfect for a cave dwelling. However, it does smell rather foul..."</p><p>Qin Sang frowned, casting a spell to dispel the stench. After careful consideration, he thoroughly explored Poison Island, releasing the corrupted winged eagles and setting up a purchased illusionary array and a spirit array to defend against storms.</p><p>The illusion array, combined with the miasma, formed the first barrier.</p><p>He then returned to his cave dwelling and set up multiple restrictions and spirit arrays.</p><p>After all, barring unforeseen circumstances, he planned to cultivate here for several decades; excessive caution was warranted.</p><p>"All done!"</p><p>Qin Sang took out a meditation cushion, sat down, and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.</p><p>After a brief rest to wash away his fatigue, Qin Sang finally had time to carefully consider his future plans.</p><p>"First, I'll advance my external avatar to the Core Formation stage, which is a prerequisite for the Star Yuan Body Tempering.</p><p>"My external avatar has reached the mid-Foundation Establishment stage; I can now prepare to refine the Corpse Pill using the *Seed Yuan Demon Fetus* technique.  Having studied these two techniques for so long, I'm about 60% confident in refining the Corpse Pill. Once my avatar reaches the False Core stage, I'll have further insights and can further perfect the technique; success is practically guaranteed.</p><p>"By then, *Celestial Demon Transformation* should also reach its peak second level.  Once everything is ready, it will be time for intensive cultivation, with some free time devoted to studying the art of refining artifacts. Nothing else to say..."</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted to the two spirit insects on his shoulder.</p><p>Fatty Silkworm looked at him expectantly, awaiting its feeding.</p><p>After feeding the Fatty Silkworm a purple crystal, Qin Sang released the Sky-Eye Butterfly, allowing it to move freely within the cave dwelling, thinking to himself.</p><p>"I wonder if they can break through to the mid-third transformation stage before the Seven Killing Palace opens.  An advancement would significantly increase their abilities, allowing them to be of greater assistance.</p><p>"As for the two-headed… that creature's temperament suggests it won't submit.  If so, I won't force it.  I'll just let it go once it breaks through to the later stage, or finds a more suitable spirit beast companion.</p><p>"With the Star Platform, I don't need spirit medicines to break through to the third level of body refinement.  I'll save that Dominant Blood Fruit for it. It's helped me a lot, so it's a well-deserved reward…"</p><p>Qin Sang's thoughts raced. He summoned his external avatar, fed it blood, and let it cultivate on its own.  He then took out the jade slip containing the *Control Thunder Technique*.</p><p>He had pondered the *Control Thunder Technique* countless times during this period. He'd only been waiting for a safe place to practice.</p><p>"Refine star煞, control heavenly thunder, evolve into the supreme thunder technique… quite a boast…"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered.</p><p>The *Control Thunder Technique* was indeed powerful, but with his improved cultivation, whether it truly lived up to the jade slip's claim of being a supreme thunder technique remained to be seen.</p><p>"To cultivate this technique, one must first refine star煞, then attract heavenly thunder until the technique is perfected.  The Crackwind Islands frequently experience storms; I won't lack for thunderous weather, but attracting heavenly thunder into my body is extremely dangerous.  Lan Dou Sect disciples have Yuan Ying cultivators protecting them during cultivation; I'll have to rely on myself…"</p><p>Qin Sang's scalp tingled after reading the cultivation process.</p><p>The technique was indeed powerful, and the considerable risk was worth it.</p><p>The power of the *Control Thunder Technique* depends on the cultivator's level of cultivation; the higher the cultivation, the greater the power.</p><p>However, it is important to note that because both forces are incredibly violent, the instant one uses the *Control Thunder Technique*, it not only damages the user, but also drains 70-80% of their true essence, which is why it can unleash such terrifying power.</p><p>"No wonder the Dou Niu Peak disciples were defeated so badly, with some even captured alive. One can only use this technique if they can kill their opponent in one blow; otherwise, it's a last resort, a desperate gamble…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious. He knew he must be cautious in the future.</p><p>However, due to his cultivation of body refinement and the advancement of *Celestial Demon Transformation* to the third level, his physique far surpassed that of other cultivators; he should be able to withstand the backlash of the *Control Thunder Technique*.</p><p>That evening, after cultivating *Celestial Demon Transformation* and accumulating sufficient star煞 in his body, Qin Sang immediately began cultivating the *Control Thunder Technique*, refining the star煞.</p><p>Before he knew it, a month had passed.</p><p>None of the nearby cultivators noticed that Poison Island, once the object of their fear, had changed hands.</p><p>Qin Sang diligently continued his cultivation, enjoying a rare period of peace.  Finally, the first major storm since taking control of Poison Island arrived.  The midday sun was suddenly obscured by dark clouds. In an instant, darkness fell, accompanied by howling winds and monstrous waves.  The spirit formation steadily protected the island.</p><p>Qin Sang stood atop the mountain, observing the apocalyptic scene around him. He finally looked up at the sky, where dark clouds gathered and lightning danced. He was about to ascend and draw down the heavenly thunder.</p><p>Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he felt a certain apprehension.  He steadied himself, waiting until the storm subsided and the lightning became less ferocious before he began his incantation and leaped into the air.</p><p>A thunderclap! Lightning tore through the darkness, striking a figure. Qin Sang groaned, falling into the sea.  The two-headed beast, waiting below, quickly carried him back to the island.</p><p>The two-headed beast wrinkled its nose at the smell of scorched flesh, looking disgusted.  Qin Sang shivered slightly, forcing himself to sit up and immediately resumed his cultivation.  While he could easily withstand the lightning strike at his level, he had to remove most of his defenses and focus entirely on the incantation to successfully draw the heavenly thunder into his body for this technique.</p><p>The pain was insignificant. Qin Sang's expression remained unchanged as he sat on the mountaintop, focusing his mind and using his stellar power to subdue the roaming thunder. The two-headed beast guarded him. It tilted its head, observing Qin Sang's focused expression, seeming to understand something before returning to its position, lying down thoughtfully.</p><p>Qin Sang repeatedly ascended, drawing down the heavenly thunder until the storm ceased.  In the end, his robes were torn to shreds, and his body bore lightning-shaped scars. Ignoring his battered appearance, he performed a hand seal and sensed his progress.  "Excellent! My understanding of the Lightning Control Technique is correct! A few more storms, and this technique will be mastered…"</p><p>A satisfied expression spread across his face as he returned to his cave.  Unknowingly, two years passed. Poison Island remained peaceful and undisturbed.</p><p>One night, while cultivating, Qin Sang sensed something and suddenly opened his eyes, a hint of joy flashing across his face. He murmured, "It's finally done!"  Before he finished speaking, Qin Sang disappeared, reappearing deep within his cave.  He looked at his external manifestation, now at the False Core stage, his eyes filled with wonder.</p>
