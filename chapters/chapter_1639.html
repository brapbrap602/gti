<h1>Chapter 1630: Remnants in the Cloud Pool</h1><p>On the road to Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Weeping Soul Cave Master couldn't help but ask, "I recall the Water Phase Hall's palace is named the Ice Ritual Palace, quite prestigious, and likely difficult to enter. What does Fellow Daoist seek?"</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man, claiming to be a descendant of the Wood Phase Hall, had spent considerable time searching for treasures within the Wood Phase Hall. Neither of them understood the Water Phase lineage, making it even more challenging.</p><p>Having received news of a Nascent Soul opportunity, the Strange-Faced Man still wanted to visit the Water Phase Hall first, surely attracted by some treasure.</p><p>"The Wood Phase Hall is intact, while the Water Phase Hall is in ruins, its residual formations greatly weakened..."</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man briefly described what he saw outside the Ice Ritual Palace. "Cave Master, do you remember the two people I encountered years ago? Lu Zhang's companion possessed a rich Wood Spiritual Aura, its purity the likes of which I've never seen. Unfortunately, my divine abilities were incomplete back then, and they escaped.  Just now, passing by the Water Phase Hall, I sensed another Wood Spiritual Aura, no less pure.  There's likely a rare and precious Wood treasure within the hall!"</p><p>"A rare and precious Wood treasure not in the Wood Phase Hall, but in the Water Phase Hall?"</p><p>Weeping Soul Cave Master's tone was peculiar.</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man knew more about the Formless Immortal Sect than Weeping Soul Cave Master. "The Sect's five lineages, each a self-contained entity, secretly compete with each other. Even if they obtain treasures needed by other lineages, they wouldn't easily part with them.  It's possible it was left in the Water Phase Hall."</p><p>"I see!" Weeping Soul Cave Master suddenly understood, then remembered something and offered a reminder, "Fellow Daoist, be careful, someone might have already gotten there first."</p><p>"Only Cave Master, Elder He Gao, and the one surnamed Mo activated the teleportation formation with Elder Zhu. Su Zinan shouldn't know much about the Formless Immortal Sect. He cultivates Blood Path divine abilities, neither water nor wood.  His target is most likely the alluring Emperor Bestowal Mountain. The Water Phase Hall is so dilapidated, it probably won't pique his interest...  Is Cave Master referring to that Water Phase descendant?"</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man pondered for a moment, then continued, "He could indeed be in the Water Phase Hall! But this person is secretive, always holding back in his actions, overly cautious, not like someone with great divine abilities. He clearly knows about the Immortal Halls, yet didn't compete for the Sword Tomb qualification. Unless, like us, he knows about some supreme treasure, or perhaps he knows his own strength is insufficient and has retreated. We'll take the precious Wood and leave. If this person is wise, we won't clash with him."</p><p>Weeping Soul Cave Master expressed his admiration. "Fellow Daoist has already considered everything. It was I who was overthinking!  Fellow Daoist seeks the precious Wood to cultivate the Acquired Wood Golem Stele, correct?  Isn't the Scarlet Profound Ancient Tree Elder Zhu sent sufficient?"</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man revealed an unsightly smile. "This divine ability uses spiritual wood as a medium. The higher the grade of the spiritual wood, the greater the power of the divine ability. The Scarlet Profound Ancient Tree is acceptable, but still slightly inferior to the aura in the Water Phase Hall."</p><p>Weeping Soul Cave Master echoed with a laugh, "I also want to see what kind of precious Wood can surpass the Heavenly Firmament Tower's Scarlet Profound Ancient Tree! The Formless Immortal Sect lives up to its reputation, such profound heritage!"</p><p>After the感慨, Weeping Soul Cave Master's smile suddenly faded, and he shook his head with a sigh. "I thought that with the Wood Phase Hall's secret techniques and the Sword Tomb insights, we would have a great chance at Nascent Soul! Unexpectedly, the Immortal Hall's path is closed. The materials required for this secret technique are all peerless treasures, and it's not easy to refine. Nascent Soul remains out of reach."</p><p>The Strange-Faced Man consoled him, "Cave Master, why be so disheartened? The changes in the Immortal Hall are beyond human control. But there is still great hope for that secret technique. As long as we work together to search after we leave, we might find what we need!"</p><p>As they spoke.</p><p>The Water Phase Hall came into view.</p><p>However, what stood out most was the Jade Repository Pavilion.</p><p>Jade pavilions reaching the heavens, single-handedly plucking the stars.</p><p>Gazing at the silhouette of the jade pavilion, Weeping Soul Cave Master's eyes were drawn to it. "That's where the Formless Immortal Sect stores its scriptures and exotic treasures, the Jade Repository Pavilion."</p><p>Glancing at the Jade Repository Pavilion, the Strange-Faced Man showed little interest. "The true inheritances of the five lineages are all stored within the five palaces!  Only things needed by low-level cultivators, cultivation techniques and divine abilities that ordinary people can't practice, or fragmented texts and exotic treasures of unknown origin and no interest to anyone, are thrown into the Jade Repository Pavilion.  If there were anything useful, would it have waited for us? After the Emperor Bestowal Mountain matter is settled, Cave Master can try your luck there. Perhaps you might find a connection with some exotic treasure."</p><p>Weeping Soul Cave Master shook his head slightly.</p><p>...</p><p>Jade Repository Pavilion.</p><p>After separating from his avatar, Qin Sang's true body ascended the Path of Inquiry and arrived at the Jade Repository Pavilion.</p><p>The jade pavilion emitted a faint jade-white light, without complex carvings or decorations on the outside. Clouds surrounded the pavilion, and spiritual light flickered around it.</p><p>Looking closely, one could see that the spiritual light and clouds formed cloud platforms of varying sizes. Qin Sang guessed that they might have been places for lectures and discussions in the past, abandoned for who knows how many years.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, the Jade Repository Pavilion's lower levels were accessible, without any restrictive formations blocking the way.</p><p>On both sides of the jade entrance, there were several jade statues. It was impossible to discern what they originally depicted, as they were severely damaged, covered with traces of cultivator battles that extended into the jade pavilion.</p><p>During the great chaos, external enemies took advantage of the situation and plundered the Formless Immortal Sect, naturally not sparing the Jade Repository Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared, but seeing this sight still couldn't help but sigh, hoping that some things had been preserved.</p><p>He looked up at the top of the jade pavilion.</p><p>There were still restrictions there, and logically, it should be where the top-level treasures were stored.</p><p>However, Qin Sang decided to enter from the entrance on the first floor.</p><p>"It seems I'm the only one here for now..."</p><p>Qin Sang swept his gaze across the layers of the jade pavilion, but didn't sense anyone else's presence.</p><p>The bones had already decayed.</p><p>Qin Sang walked into the Jade Repository Pavilion.  He didn't experience the chaos firsthand, but saw fragments of magical treasures scattered everywhere, jade slips littered on the ground...</p><p>And, orbs of various colors floated in the air.</p><p>He beckoned with his hand, and a yellow orb landed in his palm.</p><p>*Scripture of the Defensive Altar*.</p><p>It was a defensive divine ability. For Golden Core cultivators, it was considered a superior divine ability, worthy of being a core inheritance in ordinary sects.</p><p>But in Qin Sang's eyes, it was merely decent.</p><p>The other orbs were similar, likely snatched from the lower levels of the jade pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced around, found the stairs, and was about to ascend to the second floor when he seemed to have discovered something. He paused, looked up at the ceiling of the first floor.</p><p>The ceiling was also made of white jade, its luster dimmed by the war.</p><p>Qin Sang saw through the mystery. There were formations hidden within the ceiling, albeit damaged.</p><p>It shouldn't be the jade pavilion's protective formation, and it wasn't complex. Qin Sang activated his divine sense, scanned it, and immediately knew where the problem lay.  After a brief moment of thought, he drew several talismans in the air and sent them into the ceiling.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The ceiling suddenly lit up, and a clear light shone down.</p><p>Immediately afterward, the first floor became brighter, and an illusory image slowly appeared before Qin Sang. It was a geomantic map of the entire Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>In fact, Qin Sang had already understood the general layout of the Formless Immortal Sect along the way, but it was good to see the geomantic map, which was more intuitive.</p><p>Emperor Bestowal Mountain was undoubtedly the core of the Formless Immortal Sect, with the five lineages forming a protective circle around it.</p><p>Of course, there couldn't be any confidential information on the geomantic map. Trying to find the forbidden areas of the Formless Immortal Sect from the map was undoubtedly wishful thinking, otherwise, someone would have already come here.</p><p>The Ice Palace was indeed the Water Phase Hall; his avatar had gone to the right place.</p><p>"Fire Phase Hall..."</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the south of Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Of the five lineages of the Formless Immortal Sect, besides the Water Phase Hall, he was most interested in the Fire Phase Hall.</p><p>The Fire Phase Hall was located in a place called Fire Rhinoceros Island, which, according to the geomantic map, was a spiritual island floating in the air.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized the location, planning to explore Fire Rhinoceros Island when he had the chance.</p><p>After restoring the ceiling to its original state, Qin Sang ascended to the second floor via the stairs.</p><p>Although he didn't encounter any obstacles, Qin Sang discovered traces of residual restrictions in many places. After analyzing them, he determined that they were used to restrict the cultivation level of those entering.</p><p>Those with insufficient cultivation could only ascend a limited number of floors.  Only after breaking through could they qualify to access the scriptures on higher levels.</p><p>This showed the strict rules and regulations of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>The Jade Repository Pavilion's collection of books was truly vast, especially on the lower floors, where bookshelves were densely packed with all kinds of cultivation techniques and secret arts, and not limited to cultivation.</p><p>It encompassed all aspects of immortal cultivation.</p><p>It was truly a sight Qin Sang had never seen before, making him wonder if the Formless Immortal Sect had once plundered the entire cultivation world of the Middle Continent.</p><p>The higher he went, the sparser the bookshelves became.</p><p>Each floor offered a view of the scenery outside the jade pavilion, a pleasant sight, but unfortunately, the scenery of this blessed land was obscured by the dense light of restrictive formations.</p><p>Traces of battles persisted, countless scriptures and treasures plundered, and most of the bookshelves emptied.</p><p>Without time to examine them one by one, his divine sense swept through rapidly, collecting some interesting parts.</p><p>Qin Sang's speed increased, and he estimated he had ascended more than half the height, continuing for a while longer, not far from the top floor, finally reaching the level of late Golden Core.</p><p>"If nothing unexpected happens, the scriptures above should be at the Nascent Soul level."</p><p>Qin Sang looked upwards.</p><p>The restrictive force here was still present, and the jade stairs shimmered with clear light.  Qin Sang sensed a threat from it. However, this level of restriction couldn't stop him.</p><p>*Clang!*</p><p>The Goldfall Sword leaped out, hovering above. Qin Sang stepped onto the jade stairs.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The shimmering clear light above the jade stairs immediately pressed down on Qin Sang, converging into a powerful pressure, enough to force back a Nascent Soul initial stage cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unfazed.</p><p>The Goldfall Sword trembled slightly and casually slashed out three sword beams.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The sword beams penetrated, and the shimmering clear light instantly became chaotic, the resistance greatly reduced.</p><p>At the same time, beams of white light shot out from within the jade stairs, like white strings, cutting through the void towards Qin Sang, also blocked and severed by the Goldfall Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang's pace didn't pause at all.  He reached the top of the jade stairs and saw the scene on the next level, letting out a "Huh."</p><p>There was a hint of annoyance in his tone.</p><p>The scriptures on this level had been completely cleared out, not a single one left for him!</p><p>Although there weren't many traces of fighting, it was evident that a Nascent Soul battle had taken place here, a place fiercely contested by the top experts of both sides.</p><p>Qin Sang had a bad feeling. He tried to go higher, but unexpectedly found there were no more stairs.</p><p>"The Jade Repository Pavilion's collection only goes up to Nascent Soul."</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, pondering, and quickly found his target. With a thought, the Goldfall Sword flipped, its tip pointing upwards, piercing the center of the ceiling.</p><p>A strange scene unfolded. There was no sound of collision, the Goldfall Sword vanished into the ceiling, and then the ceiling transformed drastically, spinning rapidly.</p><p>Jade light shattered, turning into specks of starlight, revealing a starry passage.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his Heavenly Eye, observed for a moment, and then followed the Goldfall Sword into the passage.</p><p>He didn't understand the restrictions of the Jade Repository Pavilion and could only force his way through. Perhaps due to previous damage, the resistance Qin Sang encountered wasn't as strong as he had imagined.</p><p>The Goldfall Sword paving the way was sufficient.</p><p>When necessary, he transformed into a sword formation, stabilizing the void.</p><p>Without even using his Demonic Fire, Qin Sang smoothly passed through the passage and entered a higher level. His eyes immediately lit up.</p><p>He saw a sea of clouds stretching beyond the jade pavilion, surging and illusory, with myriad wondrous sights. Although connected to the main body of the jade pavilion below, it was concealed by restrictions and wouldn't appear in his field of vision.</p><p>It was like a celestial pavilion in the clouds!</p><p>"Emperor Bestowal Mountain!"</p><p>Within the celestial pavilion, the view was clearer.</p><p>Closest was the Water Phase Hall, followed by Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The jade pavilion seemed towering, but it wasn't even half as tall as Emperor Bestowal Mountain. The imposing aura of the sky-supporting giant mountain washed over him.  One could imagine the celestial grandeur of the Formless Immortal Sect at its peak!</p><p>He didn't linger on the outside scenery for too long.</p><p>The layout of the celestial pavilion came into view, a peculiar structure with an open center and surrounding corridors.</p><p>In the middle was a cloud pool, with clouds flowing like water.</p><p>Qin Sang felt something was amiss, and upon closer inspection, he discovered its hidden wonders!</p><p>There were white orbs within the cloud pool, hidden within the mist.  Something seemed to be encased within the orbs.</p><p>He activated his Heavenly Eye.</p><p>He could see what was inside the orbs, greatly surprising him.</p><p>Within these orbs, some contained broken swords and blades, chipped stone bracelets, and iron whips with only their hilts remaining.</p><p>In other words, they were all remnants of treasures.</p><p>The remnants were desolate, their power gone, but because of their unique materials, they were kept in the cloud pool.</p><p>Another portion consisted of round jade cages, similar in shape, with runes flowing on their surfaces, seemingly used to seal the treasures within.</p><p>Some orbs were empty, their treasures already taken, perhaps plundered by enemies.</p><p>It didn't look like a scripture repository at all, but a treasure pool!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't know where the Formless Immortal Sect obtained these items, but judging by the exposed remnants, they were likely of unknown value and origin. Fearing they might miss a valuable treasure, the Formless Immortal Sect threw them all in here.</p><p>Even with his Heavenly Eye Butterfly, he couldn't discern the relative value of these remnants.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede also didn't react.</p><p>Qin Sang casually chose a jade cage and conjured a sword beam, intending to retrieve it.  Unexpectedly, as soon as the sword beam appeared, the cloud pool suddenly surged, and a cloud thunder shot out towards his face.</p><p>*Crackle!*</p><p>The cloud thunder wasn't loud.</p><p>But Qin Sang's expression changed.  His Phoenix Wings flapped, and he instantly shifted several zhang away, dodging the cloud thunder.</p><p>At the same time, the sound of clashing metal rang out from the cloud pool. The Goldfall Sword flew back, repelled by the restrictions, and then the cloud pool vanished, the treasures disappearing into thin air.</p><p>Qin Sang's relaxed expression disappeared, realizing that retrieving treasures from the cloud pool wasn't easy. Force wouldn't work, and they were all remnants of unknown use.  Cultivation techniques were more important. He would go to the upper level first and deal with this later.</p><p>He looked towards a corner of the corridor. The jade stairs reappeared, leading to the next level, the very top of the jade pavilion, the only place he hadn't explored yet.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly walked around the corridor.  As he approached the jade stairs.</p><p>The commotion in the cloud pool gradually subsided, returning to normal.  Orbs of white light drifted randomly.  Qin Sang inadvertently glanced at a jade cage, and a strange palpitation arose in his heart.</p><p>Faint and indistinct.</p><p>Qin Sang stopped in surprise, focusing inwards, searching for the source of the palpitation.</p><p>After a while, Qin Sang finally dared to confirm that it originated from the *Yin Yang Heavenly Strife Secret Art* that he had almost forgotten, the fragmented technique he obtained from the Lan Dou Sect in the Vast Ocean!</p>
