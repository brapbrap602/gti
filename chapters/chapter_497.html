<h1>Chapter 490: The Gatekeeper</h1><p>The spirit array within the Peach Blossom Miasma had countless variations, but deciphering them wasn't difficult if one knew the patterns.  However, Qin Sang proceeded cautiously, inching towards the heart of the miasma, wary of any traps Yuanji might have left behind that could expose his presence.</p><p>As he ventured deeper, the peach trees seemed to twist and contort, their branches like claws, their appearance far from the idyllic beauty they once held. They now resembled malevolent spirits, a stark contrast to the Red Jade Peaches of Mount Shaohua.</p><p>The structure within the miasma became clearer, a simple, square stone house devoid of any ornamentation.</p><p>The moment the stone house came into full view, Qin Sang abruptly halted. Activating the *Dun Ling Jue* to its fullest, he dodged behind a peach tree, his brow furrowed as he observed what lay ahead.</p><p>Seated before the stone house was a man.</p><p>Around fifty years old, he wore a grey robe embroidered with black flames along the hem.  He sat cross-legged, his back to the house, eyes half-closed, his breathing even.  He seemed unaware of anyone's approach, his Core Formation cultivation level on full display.</p><p>"It's him?"</p><p>Recognizing the man, Qin Sang instantly recalled his identity: Mo Yan, one of the Four Flame Envoys of the Demonic Flame Sect, a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect, whose real name was Huang Shizhong.</p><p>Qin Sang had now encountered all four of Yuanji's Flame Envoys, two of whom had already fallen at his hands.</p><p>He had captured another, a Core Formation cultivator, on the Chaotic Isles.  However, unwilling to waste a precious Heavenly Corpse Talisman on him, Qin Sang had killed the man after capturing Huang Jiaren and turned him into a demonic corpse.</p><p>Now, Huang Shizhong was here in the Peach Blossom Miasma, sitting motionless before the stone house, not cultivating, but seemingly guarding the entrance.</p><p>Within the Demonic Flame Sect, only Yuanji himself warranted such a guard.</p><p>It appeared Yuanji was likely inside.</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flickered. He had come to the right place.</p><p>His gaze shifted past Huang Shizhong to the stone house behind him.  Its doors were tightly shut, its surface etched with runes, a faint, flickering light emanating from the restrictive barrier.  He couldn't penetrate it to see within.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, Qin Sang realized the barrier was quite intricate.  While it would take him considerable effort to break, it posed little challenge to the Night Spectre.</p><p>Where was Ji Wu?</p><p>Qin Sang scanned his surroundings but found no trace of anyone else.</p><p>Only two of the Four Flame Envoys remained. If even Huang Shizhong had been summoned to guard the door, Ji Wu couldn't be far.  His status was higher than Huang Shizhong's.</p><p>Yuanji valued Ji Wu highly, treating him as his heir.  Qin Sang had learned from the captured Flame Envoy that Ji Wu was even more favored than Yin Yan.</p><p>Could Ji Wu be inside the stone house?</p><p>Hidden behind the tree, Qin Sang waited patiently for an hour, but still, there was no sign of Ji Wu, nor any sound from within the stone house.</p><p>He couldn't wait any longer.</p><p>Yuanji might be at a crucial juncture, and the longer he delayed, the more variables could arise.  He had to act now.</p><p>To eliminate Yuanji, he first had to deal with Huang Shizhong. Otherwise, facing a Nascent Soul cultivator and two Core Formation experts, his only option would be to flee.</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, pondering.  Yuanji was the primary target, so he didn't want any complications. He had no intention of capturing Huang Shizhong alive.</p><p>He considered how he could swiftly and decisively eliminate Huang Shizhong before Yuanji noticed, taking out one opponent before the main confrontation.</p><p>Ideally, he would kill Huang Shizhong without alerting Yuanji at all.</p><p>An idea formed in his mind.</p><p>...</p><p>Huang Shizhong sat as still as a statue.</p><p>The Peach Blossom Miasma was highly toxic, repelling all birds and beasts. Even the surrounding area for miles was a dead zone.</p><p>Thus, an unusual silence prevailed, making any subtle sound easily discernible to Huang Shizhong.</p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to hear something. His ears twitched, and he snapped his eyes open, focusing on a nearby peach tree.</p><p>A single branch trembled slightly, as if stirred by a breeze, a few peach blossoms drifting down.</p><p>Was it his imagination?</p><p>A flicker of doubt crossed Huang Shizhong's eyes.  Apart from the falling petals, nothing seemed amiss, including the spirit array within the miasma.</p><p>He shook his head slightly, his guard momentarily lowered.  As he was about to close his eyes again, a gust of wind struck his left side. His expression changed drastically.</p><p>In his peripheral vision, he saw a dark figure approaching with astonishing speed, already almost upon him.</p><p>Someone!</p><p>Huang Shizhong was startled. It hadn't been his imagination. There was an intruder.</p><p>The enemy had silently bypassed the spirit array and the poisonous miasma, getting this close without him noticing!</p><p>Experienced as he was, despite his shock, Huang Shizhong reacted swiftly.  Instead of fleeing, he twisted his upper body to face the attacker, fists clenched, ready to counterattack.</p><p>Seeing the masked Night Spectre, Huang Shizhong's heart sank.  The Night Spectre's terrifying power left him shaken, knowing he was no match. He opened his mouth to cry out to Yuanji.</p><p>"Huh..."</p><p>As his mouth opened, a chill pierced his chest, and his strength drained away.  No sound escaped his lips.  A searing pain shot through his throat as clawed hands clamped around his neck.</p><p>He managed to look down, and through the ghostly claws, he saw an emerald sword tip protruding from his chest.  Focused on the Night Spectre's attack, he hadn't noticed another enemy lurking in the shadows, wielding such a sharp sword.</p><p>His protective robe had been effortlessly pierced.</p><p>Chaotic sword energy surged into Huang Shizhong's body, wreaking havoc, stealing not only his strength but his life. The light in his eyes rapidly faded.</p><p>He died.</p><p>At that moment, the equally masked Qin Sang appeared beside Huang Shizhong, ordering the Night Spectre to release its grip as he gently supported the lifeless body.</p><p>The assassination, seemingly simple, had been mentally taxing.  Each moment had to be precisely timed to prevent Huang Shizhong from raising the alarm.</p><p>Qin Sang pressed against Huang Shizhong's wound, stemming the flow of blood, thinking, *You died at the hands of the Night Spectre and my magical treasure, a fitting end.*</p><p>He deposited Huang Shizhong's body into the Corpse Puppet Bag. Then, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the Night Spectre, he looked towards the stone house entrance.</p><p>Huang Shizhong was dead.</p><p>There was no reaction from within the stone house. Yuanji seemed genuinely unaware.</p><p>Regardless of Yuanji's plans, Qin Sang had reached a point of no return.  He commanded the Night Spectre forward, simultaneously retrieving the Ten Yama Banners and deploying the ten ghostly standards.</p><p>As the formation began to take shape, Qin Sang glanced at the Night Spectre.</p>
