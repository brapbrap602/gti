**CHAPTER 200: THE BEST PILLS**


"Senior Brother Yuyangzi, I'm Qin Sang. I have a question, I wonder if Senior Brother Yuyangzi can enlighten me?"


Yuyangzi curiously glanced in his direction and said, "Junior Brother Qin, don't hesitate to ask."


Qin Sang nodded his head and said, "I am quite new here, and I do not know much about Xuanguan Pass and the Ancient Immortal Battleground. From the jade slips' descriptions, I can only see the general picture. It is difficult for me to make a decision between becoming a Xuanguan Guard or an Umbra Guard. Is it mandatory for us to make a decision now? If not, may I ask for a few days of leeway, Senior Brother? I would like to observe this place before choosing."


Yuyangzi responded with an "Oh" sound, then said with a smile, "Of course. Junior Brother Qin, just make sure to make up your mind within a month. Feel free to contact me..."


Yuyangzi paused, took out a jade talisman, and handed it to Qin Sang. He said, "Keep this, Junior Brother Qin. You may use this jade talisman at the foot of Junpan Mountain. You can borrow a cave outside the military camp without any charge. Give it back to me when a month has passed. However, Junior Brother Qin, you should make your decision as soon as possible. If you miss this chance, it will be okay for the Umbra Guard. You will only need to work hard, but if you want to join the Xuanguan Guard, you will have to wait another ten years. Xuanguan Pass is not under the complete control of our Shaohua Sect. We still have to follow certain rules."


Qin Sang said his thanks. He saw from the jade slips that the Xuanguan Guards' military camp is stationed at Junpan Mountain. The best caves on Junpan Mountain were built for the guards to use. The caves are not available to the public. Outsiders are strictly forbidden from trespassing.


He was able to borrow a cave for a month because of his sect's connections.


In a month, he would have to find a cave on his own or rent one.


Next, some people also decided to observe for a few days. After receiving the jade talisman, Qin Sang declined a fellow brother's invitation to walk together. He walked towards the outside of the hall alone.


It was exactly mid-day, and the sky was万里无云.


Qin Sang stood outside the hall's entrance. He squinted and looked up at Xuanguan Pass' extraordinarily magnificent city walls.


The city walls were hundreds of zhang tall, and large blue boulders were used to build the entirety of the wall. Both sides were so vast that the ends could not be seen, and the city was built within this pass.


For immortal cultivators, it was not difficult to use concrete and stones to build city walls like this. What was difficult was setting up firm restrictions on such massive city walls that could resist the impact of ever-changing weather patterns and beast tides.


After staring for a while, Qin Sang walked into the crowd. He recalled the map of Xuanguan Pass he saw in the jade slip and walked towards the east.


...


Spirit Pill House


The store was not large. They sold all sorts of commonly used pills, and they purchased all kinds of spiritual medicines. Porcelain and jade bottles were densely placed on the shelves, and the names and medicinal effects were clearly marked on them.


The owner was a man who looked to be about fifty years old. He was also a cultivator, but his realm was only in the 12th level of the Qi Refining Stage.


On this street, there were many similar stores. This store was not in a prominent location, and there were no customers in the store.


The owner leisurely leaned on a lounge chair, when suddenly, the light in the store dimmed. The owner squinted, and seeing a man walk in, lazily asked.


"What does this honored guest need..."


After seeing the man's cultivation, all laziness on the owner's face vanished. He hurriedly stood up and rushed to welcome him as he repeatedly said, "I did not know an elder was coming. I arrived late to welcome you. Please forgive me, elder. What spirit pills do you want to buy? We only have top-notch products in this store..."


"I will take a look. Store owner, please be at ease," the person waved his hand, then walked up to the shelves on his own. He glanced at each jade bottle as if he had no intention of buying anything.


The owner did not dare to get angry. He patiently accompanied the person around.


This person was Qin Sang. He had not hidden his cultivation. He had been walking around this street for a long time, and he went in to take a look at any store that sold spiritual materials and pills.


After walking around, Qin Sang could not help but marvel that the Ancient Immortal Battleground was indeed an excellent place. Both the quality and variety of spirit pills were far richer than the Wenyue Market Store.


The pill he was most concerned about was for repairing foundations and replenishing Yuan Qi. It was also available for purchase.


However, Qin Sang knew in his heart that he had lost his most fundamental foundation, so these top-quality spirit pills would probably be useless. Therefore, he only casually bought a few to see the effects. Even if these spirit pills were top-notch among similar pills, they might not be effective. Moreover, with Qin Sang's current assets, even if the store had them, he would not be able to afford them.


There was nothing interesting in this store, Qin Sang shook his head and prepared to leave. The owner read the expression on Qin Sang's face and while seeing him off, he said, "The pills in this store are all for Qi Refining Stage cultivators. They are unlikely to impress you. If you need anything, Senior, the Ice Spring House and the Grasswood Pavilion on the street should meet your requirements. Of course, the best store is the Great Purity Pill Hall. That is the Great Purity Pill Sect's property..."


...


At dusk, Qin Sang walked out of a store that sold magic treasures, and he stored the handkerchief-shaped magic treasure he had just bought into his mustard seed bag.


After shopping for so long, Qin Sang gained a deeper impression of the Ancient Immortal Battleground and Xuanguan Pass. He glanced at the sky, sped up, and flew towards Junpan Mountain.

The Beacon Hill was situated within the fortress of Xuangan Pass. The mountain was richly endowed with spiritual essence and was mined with neatly aligned caverns patrolled by sentries whose discipline was strict and formal.

Qin Sang arrived in a great hurry. Just as he reached the foot of the mountain, he saw a detachment of sentries approaching him.

“This is a restricted military zone. Daoist friend, please leave!” The vigilant garrison commander stopped Qin Sang with a respectful tone.

Qin Sang presented the jade token he had prepared. “General, I am Qin Sang, a disciple of Mount Shaohua. This jade token is from General Yu Yangzi. He said I could stay on Beacon Hill for a month…”

The garrison commander took the jade token and examined it carefully. His expression relaxed as he gestured to him with an outstretched hand, “It turns out to be a fellow daoist from Mount Shaohua. Daoist friend Qin, would you follow me?”

Qin Sang was led to a secluded cavern at the foot of the mountain. The spiritual essence in the cavern was acceptable but somewhat inadequate for Foundation Establishment cultivators. After he closed the cavern entrance, Qin Sang sat down with his legs crossed on a stone bed. He was deep in contemplation.

He sorted through his experiences during the day. Two things had attracted his attention: Spiritwood and spiritual pills.

The number of Spiritwood on sale at the shops in the city was considerable. Many pieces were superior in quality to the Golden Snow Pine Wood. This put Qin Sang at ease and made him realize that he had been right to come to the ancient battlefield of the immortals.

Although the prices were not low, if he collected it slowly and steadily, he would definitely be able to improve the quality of his Ebonywood Sword.

In addition, Qin Sang had visited the Taiyi Pill Pavilion and heard from the manager about three spiritual herbs, namely the Harmonizing Melody Pill, the Five Mystical Herbs Ointment, and the Snow Ginseng Jade Elixir. These three were top-grade elixirs used to repair damaged foundations.

In today’s immortal cultivation world, the herbs required to make the three elixirs had not yet completely disappeared from the face of the earth and had even been sold at the Taiyi Pill Pavilion.

Whether they would be effective for him, Qin Sang was unsure. For now, he could only look at them with his mouth watering.

Because all three spiritual herbs were sold through auctions. Each auction would invariably trigger intense competition. The final transaction prices would all run into tens of thousands. Even if Qin Sang were to sell himself, he would not be able to raise enough money to buy them.

However, there was no need to be in such a hurry. If he added the data he had gathered on Mount Pagoda to the mix, Qin Sang now had multiple targets—much better than searching aimlessly.
