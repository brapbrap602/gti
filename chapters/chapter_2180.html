<h1>Chapter 2170: Langxian Garden</h1><p>Qin Sang withdrew from the beast formation, feigning departure, then stopped a short distance away, lost in thought.</p><p>Including the woman in palace attire, there were at least three of them.</p><p>As for their cultivation levels, judging solely from the pressure they exerted might be inaccurate, but there should be at least one late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator among them.</p><p>Unless both Liuli and Lechen were severely injured and incapacitated, working together with them from within held a good chance of breaking the formation and rescuing them.</p><p>The current problem was how to contact them.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly rose, the Sky Eye Butterfly flew out from his dantian and landed on his shoulder, its wings fluttering gently, emitting a strange light.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang's eyes grew increasingly profound, as if reflecting the entire world before him.</p><p>Activating his Sky Eye ability, the world within his vision began to change.  The mountains and trees gradually blurred, and all things in the world transformed into swirling masses of colorful energy, some drifting, some stagnant.</p><p>The most striking was a mass of crimson energy, almost filling Qin Sang's entire field of vision—the energy emanating from the beast formation.</p><p>The spirit beasts forming the array were fire crows, fire oxen, and the like, all possessing innate fire-resistance, making the fire spirit energy here exceptionally dense. This fire spirit energy also formed the foundation of the array.</p><p>It was clear that the closer to the core of the formation, the purer and denser the fire spirit energy became.</p><p>After gazing for a long time, Qin Sang's expression shifted as he noticed something unusual.</p><p>The fire spirit energy within the beast formation was not only dense but also seamlessly integrated; however, to Qin Sang, it felt strangely disharmonious. He didn't know where this feeling came from, but he knew it wasn't baseless, so he continued to observe the formation, following this sensation.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang seemed to find the reason for this disharmony—it likely stemmed from the spirit beasts within the formation.</p><p>"Could it be that the spirit beasts in the formation don't belong to a single master? Perhaps they belong to several people, jointly forming this array?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, formulating a hypothesis.</p><p>Even if they came from the same lineage and practiced the same technique, differences would inevitably exist between different cultivators.  They couldn't be completely identical.</p><p>One could employ various methods to mask and compensate, but it would be impossible to completely eliminate these differences.</p><p>There are no perfect formations in the world!</p><p>These differences were equivalent to the formation's weak point.</p><p>Of course, even knowing that these differences exist, finding them would be incredibly difficult. The formation's masters were already trying their best to conceal them.  A mid-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would never notice them.  Qin Sang's ability to detect them was primarily due to the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Even if found, exploiting this weakness to break the formation would be as difficult as reaching the heavens.</p><p>Those controlling the formation would undoubtedly be more aware of its flaws than those trying to break it, maintaining constant vigilance. Moreover, a beast formation, composed of spirit beasts, is more flexible than other spirit formations, allowing for changes at any time. Ultimately, it would come down to a contest of strength.</p><p>However, the Sky Eye Butterfly's ethereal divine light proved remarkably effective in breaking and traversing formations.  If Qin Sang didn't try to break the formation, but instead used this slight inconsistency to infiltrate the formation and ascertain Liuli and Lechen's location, it might be possible!</p><p>With that thought, Qin Sang focused his observation, a plan gradually forming in his mind. Soon, the Sky Eye Butterfly flapped its wings vigorously, and a faint light, the ethereal divine light, enveloped Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang and the Sky Eye Butterfly vanished without a trace.</p><p>Under the protection of the ethereal divine light, Qin Sang quietly arrived at the edge of the beast formation.  After some reconnaissance, he selected a river, following it upstream, crossing over a dozen mountain ranges, reaching a point deeper than before.</p><p>He found himself at the edge of a dense forest, with three fire oxen standing or lying nearby, within arm's reach, yet the formation's masters remained oblivious.</p><p>As time passed, the scene within the beast formation unfolded before Qin Sang.  The landscape here was crisscrossed with mountains and valleys, picturesque and beautiful. Surprisingly, the scenery was pristine, showing no signs of damage, meaning no major battle had taken place there.</p><p>"Could the battlefield be elsewhere?"</p><p>Qin Sang mused to himself. Perhaps Liuli and the others had fled here, eventually becoming trapped within the formation, unable to escape. If he could find the battlefield, he might glean some information from the traces left there.  Unfortunately, time was pressing; Liuli and the others might not be able to hold out for long.</p><p>The situation was better than Qin Sang anticipated.  There were no signs of a struggle; the formation's masters hadn't yet found them.</p><p>The shifting beast formation confirmed Qin Sang's suspicions.  The spirit beasts constantly moved, their formation's power sweeping across every corner repeatedly, clearly searching for them.  This, however, was a problem for Qin Sang. Without guidance, he didn't know the location of Liuli and Liao Chen.</p><p>Qin Sang rubbed his fingers.  He had preserved a trace of Liao Chen's blood essence when the Blood Crane dissipated, wondering if Liao Chen could sense it.</p><p>Qin Sang then moved throughout the beast formation, traversing its outer perimeter to no avail, before slowly approaching the center.  The closer he got, the more cautious he had to be.  Exposure meant no time to retreat; it would be a suicide mission.</p><p>Qin Sang slowed his pace, frequently stopping to observe and sometimes detouring, but progress was steady, gradually bringing him closer to the core.</p><p>“They're probably hidden there…”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed at the towering mountain range before him, his brow furrowed in thought.  He sensed that the area ahead was heavily sealed by the formation's master, impenetrable.  He was currently at the edge of this area and hesitated to enter rashly.</p><p>Liuli and Liao Chen hadn't been discovered yet, but this situation couldn't last. The area was shrinking, and they would eventually be found.</p><p>Several crane calls echoed from a distance. Qin Sang glanced sideways, spotting three fire cranes flying towards him. The leading crane was a Nascent Soul-stage great demon, yet merely a pawn in the formation master's hands.</p><p>The fire cranes spread their wings, gliding through the sky, their sharp eyes scanning back and forth. They flew past Qin Sang, completely unaware of his presence.</p><p>As they passed, the leftmost fire crane tilted its head, its gaze sweeping across Qin Sang's hiding place, its expression seemingly normal.</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes narrowed. He noticed a flash of unusual light in the crane's pupils as it looked at him – something he'd never seen in the other spirit beasts. Those in the formation were controlled, devoid of self.</p><p>“Could it be…”</p><p>A thought struck Qin Sang. He followed the fire cranes, hesitated for a moment, and stealthily sent a strand of his divine sense into the crane.</p><p>This was undoubtedly risky. If Qin Sang was wrong, he’d be exposed.</p><p>A moment later, he received a response.</p><p>“Is that Master Qin?”</p><p>Liao Chen's voice!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart leaped. His strategy worked; Liao Chen had sensed his blood essence.</p><p>“It is I. Where are you?” Qin Sang immediately asked.</p><p>Liao Chen's voice was clearly weak, indicating a dire situation.</p><p>After a brief silence, Liuli responded, “Friend Qin, we're inside a mountain, hidden with the Wu Yang Dou…”</p><p>Pausing, Liuli added, “My senior brother is injured.”</p><p>The Wu Yang Dou must be a concealment treasure.  With Ning Zhenren around, Qin Sang wasn't surprised by their possession of such items.</p><p>Hearing that Liuli was alright, Qin Sang relaxed slightly. “Was Venerable Liao Chen injured by the enemy?”</p><p>Liuli replied, “Senior brother was injured in the Spirit Valley. His wounds hadn't healed when they encountered them, and they took advantage of his weakened state…”</p><p>“It’s simply my bad luck…”</p><p>Liao Chen sighed, explaining the situation.</p><p>It turned out that after entering the sacred grounds, Liao Chen intended to visit a Spirit Valley for a chance encounter. This is where things went wrong.</p><p>This encounter was crucial for Liao Chen, who was on the verge of a breakthrough. Obtaining it would allow him to reach the late Nascent Soul stage within the sacred grounds, enhancing their chances for success.</p><p>They went directly to the Spirit Valley, and things went smoothly thanks to their preparations. However, an unexpected event occurred just as they were about to obtain the opportunity.</p><p>A celestial light suddenly descended, illuminating the entire Spirit Valley.  Ghostly gray figures emerged from the light. At that time, Liao Chen was fighting two Spirit Valley guardians.  The gray figures mimicked his abilities, and the celestial light triggered a change in the valley.  Taken by surprise, he was injured by the gray figures and the guardians.  Liuli, being on the outer perimeter, escaped.</p><p>Celestial light again!</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, "As expected," the celestial light disrupted the sacred grounds trial. Some benefited while others suffered, Liao Chen being one of the unlucky ones.</p><p>Countless individuals were affected, some even perishing.  Misfortune never comes singly.</p><p>The celestial light attracted nearby cultivators, and the two barely escaped the valley, only to be pursued. They fled to this point, only to be trapped by the beast formation.</p><p>Liao Chen said with shame and remorse, "Master Ning asked me to help my junior sister, but I've only become a burden. I'm at my wit's end, a single desperate attack is all I can muster, while they are still at full strength.  If we both try to escape, we'll both die. My only hope was to buy time for my junior sister to escape, but she refused."</p><p>Liuli said, "It's not time to give up hope! Even if Daoist Qin hadn't encountered the Blood Crane, we still might have a chance."</p><p>Turning to Qin Sang, she continued, "I used a divine ability from my Imperial Emperor Talisman to secretly control this fire crane. I planned to slowly move the wisp of divine intent towards the edge of the beast array, then explain the situation to you, but the enemy became alerted, so I dared not act.  But unexpectedly, you managed to infiltrate.  With us working together inside and out, we should be able to break this array!"</p><p>Listening to Liuli's lengthy explanation, Qin Sang felt only… strangeness.</p><p>But compared to the previous half-day of barely speaking a word, requiring others to guess his meaning, this was a welcome change.</p><p>"While I can infiltrate this array, breaking it won't be easy," Qin Sang said, frowning.  "What is their background, and how strong are they?"</p><p>"They're from the Lang Xian Yuan," Liao Chen said.</p><p>"Lang Xian Yuan? A sect from Kan Prefecture?" Qin Sang seemed to recall hearing that name in Kan Prefecture.</p><p>"That's right. Lang Xian Yuan is a sect from Kan Prefecture.  They remain hidden from the world, unlike the renowned large sects of Kan Prefecture, but their strength and background are extraordinary. Master Ning once mentioned that Lang Xian Yuan also received a lineage of the Supreme Daoist Sect. There are many similar hidden sects in Kan Prefecture, and others have also sent people here, such as Bi Chen Xuan…"</p><p>Hearing Liao Chen's explanation, Qin Sang realized that Kan Prefecture hid numerous secluded sects, most with roots in Daoism.</p><p>So many sects possessing the Supreme Daoist Sect's lineage...  Could the Supreme Daoist Sect have shattered, splitting into numerous large and small sects?</p><p>The concentration of these sects in Kan Prefecture couldn't be a coincidence. Perhaps the Supreme Daoist Sect was originally located in Kan Prefecture.</p><p>Unfortunately, during his years in Kan Prefecture, he was focused on collecting materials for the casting altar, at the behest of the Five Elements Alliance, and had no time to investigate these hidden secrets; otherwise, he might have noticed something.</p><p>However, Qin Sang did notice that Kan Prefecture had many Daoist cultivators, and their demeanor was relaxed compared to other prefectures, perhaps influenced by the Daoist Dan Ding sect.</p><p>Master Ning also possessed a lineage from the Supreme Daoist Sect; logically, there should be some connection.  On the contrary, Lang Xian Yuan and other sects had clashed with Purple Cloud Mountain in the Sacred Land many times, they were old enemies, which explained why they attacked Liuli and the others.</p><p>"How many people are from Lang Xian Yuan, and how strong are they?" Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>"There are two; one at the mid-Lianxu stage, the other a top expert at the late Lianxu stage. If not for her, we would have had a chance to escape," Liao Chen said.</p><p>"Only two?" Qin Sang's eyes flickered. "I detected three people earlier…"</p><p>He briefly recounted his earlier probing.</p><p>"That second wave of pressure was a feint, aimed at intimidating us without a fight!"</p><p>Liuli stated firmly, "They need to focus on controlling the beast array to prevent our escape, so they would avoid provoking others."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly. Since there were only two enemies, he was less apprehensive. The priority was breaking the beast array and rescuing Liuli and Liao Chen.</p><p>"Do you two have any strategies?"</p><p>Liuli said, "With Daoist Qin's help, escaping shouldn't be difficult. But would you be willing to take more risks and go further? They might have useful information, and we can learn about the strength of other opponents to prepare beforehand."</p><p>"Oh? How confident are you, fairy?" Qin Sang was intrigued.</p><p>Liuli calmly replied, "The Imperial Emperor Talisman has a divine ability called 'Imperial Decree'.  Using it, I can temporarily force some spirit beasts to obey me, creating a huge flaw in the array.  Due to my insufficient cultivation, I can't maintain it for long; they'll quickly regain control.  Normally, our chances are slim, but with Daoist Qin, it's different.  From my observations, the array is formed by the spirit beasts of both of them.  I'll target the woman's beasts; while she's distracted, Daoist Qin can launch a surprise attack, and we might succeed!"</p><p>The Imperial Emperor Talisman could actually forcibly seize control of spirit beasts from Lianxu cultivators!</p><p>This talisman came from Master Ning.  Perhaps due to Liuli's cultivation, its power was limited, but its high rank was undeniable.</p><p>Since Liuli dared to say this, she must have some confidence.</p><p>Unexpectedly, even in danger, Liuli remained calm and had already devised a counter-strategy.  After careful consideration, Qin Sang deemed it feasible.</p>
