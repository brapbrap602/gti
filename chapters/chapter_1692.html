<h1>Chapter 1683: Bestowing the Elixir</h1><p>Among these individuals, the origins of Qin Sang's Avatar remained the most obscure.  Although Mo Xingdao was a rogue cultivator who had achieved considerable renown early on, his Avatar seemed to have sprung from the cracks of a stone.  Therefore, Holy Venerable Huiguang posed this question.</p><p>The Avatar frankly explained his background.</p><p>Although he used a secret sound transmission, he knew that the identity of the Xie Family Ancestor couldn't be concealed for long. Once the matter here was resolved, various parties would be able to investigate.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang merely asked casually, without intending to delve deeper.  He mused, "If the Demon Subduing Stake is as the benefactor describes, only broken in the middle with its internal restrictions not severely damaged, there's still a chance for restoration. However, this poor monk doesn't have absolute certainty and needs to examine the artifact first."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Avatar frowned, his expression uneasy, as if on the verge of speaking but hesitant.</p><p>His thoughts were practically written all over his face.  How could Holy Venerable Huiguang not see through him?  He smiled and said, "If the Demon Subduing Stake can be used to suppress the Ancient Demon and prevent this demonic tribulation, the benefactor will be the greatest contributor.  This poor monk will certainly keep his promise and bestow the Five Elements Elixir upon the benefactor.  Presumably, everyone else will have no objections."</p><p>As he spoke, Holy Venerable Huiguang's gaze swept over everyone present.</p><p>Naturally, no one voiced any disagreement.</p><p>In such a short time, the Demonic Body had displayed a level of power that filled them with dread.  Their primary concern now was no longer whether they could achieve Nascent Soul ascension, but how to preserve their lives.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang was injured.  It was conceivable that once the Saint King Qinghu showed signs of weakening, they would likely have to face the Ancient Demon directly, without even the opportunity to flee.</p><p>They were overjoyed that the Avatar could produce a treasure capable of restraining the Ancient Demon.</p><p>Incidentally, they could also observe whether the old monk's promise was sincere and whether this fellow could actually take the Five Elements Elixir. As for whether there would be future turmoil due to the elixir, that was a matter for later.</p><p>Having received the promise, the Avatar discarded his feigned apprehension and hesitantly said, "I won't hide it from the two senior predecessors. Many years ago, this junior accidentally obtained the Demon Subduing Stake, unaware of its origins.  I only felt that its restrictions were quite profound and not of this era.  Thus, I devoted myself to studying it for many years, integrating it with my own cultivation method, and gaining considerable insight. Based on the network of restrictions, I have fused it with my own divine abilities, and it has even become linked with this junior's Dao Foundation.  I am willing to offer all my years of understanding to assist the two senior predecessors in repairing the Demon Subduing Stake.  However, hastily separating from this treasure will inevitably destabilize my Dao Foundation..."</p><p>This kid wants to run!</p><p>Old Demon Fan and the others cursed inwardly. Only a fool would believe the nonsense about the treasure being linked to the Dao Foundation.</p><p>Yet, they were helpless.</p><p>If they were in his shoes, having obtained the Five Elements Elixir, they would certainly look for a reason to slip away while Holy Venerable Huiguang was occupied with the Demonic Body.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang was clearly no fool. Even if the Avatar spoke with seeming sincerity, he wouldn't completely believe it, treating it as another condition for the Avatar to offer the Demon Subduing Stake.</p><p>Among everyone present, the Avatar had the lowest cultivation level and the weakest background.  Having various concerns was understandable.</p><p>A mere mid-Nascent Soul cultivator.  His absence wouldn't necessarily disrupt their formation.</p><p>"As long as this poor monk can personally see the Demon Subduing Stake, I should be able to determine whether this treasure is usable. The benefactor need not worry."</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang agreed without hesitation, separating the Avatar from the Dhyana Arhat Formation. After a brief period of disarray, the formation reformed.</p><p>Detached from the battle formation, the Avatar immediately felt the pressure lessen.  He took a deep breath and, using the excuse that his Dao Foundation was of paramount importance and couldn't be disturbed, requested permission to find a cave on Emperor Bestowed Mountain to perform the technique undisturbed.  It wouldn't take long.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang agreed to everything.</p><p>However, before his departure, Holy Venerable Huiguang and Saint King Qinghu both openly placed a mark on him.</p><p>The Avatar bowed respectfully and leaped down, landing on the mountain peak.</p><p>...</p><p>While the Avatar was negotiating with Holy Venerable Huiguang, Qin Sang's true body had already retrieved the Demonic Banners, placing all of them before him.</p><p>His fingers lightly touched a banner, the familiar icy chill penetrating his bones and reaching his heart.</p><p>He still remembered that the first true Ten Yama Banners he acquired was shortly after entering Shaohua Mountain, after killing a remnant of the Kuiyin Sect. That fellow seemed to be called... Sun De?</p><p>He gradually acquired more until he obtained the opportunity in the Seven Kill Hall of the Boundless Sea, refining the other half of the Demon Subduing Stake into a Demonic Banner, controlling eighteen banners, and becoming renowned in the North Star Region.</p><p>Finally, he obtained the remaining banners from his senior sister, effectively collecting the complete Demon Subduing Stake.</p><p>From Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, and even Nascent Soul, the Ten Yama Banners had made great contributions to him.</p><p>"Kuiyin Ancestor..."</p><p>Qin Sang clicked his tongue.</p><p>He never acknowledged himself as a disciple of the Kuiyin Sect.  Yet, ironically, he had to thank Kuiyin Ancestor for his current achievements, still benefiting from his legacy.</p><p>Thinking of trading away the treasures that had followed him for so long, Qin Sang felt a pang of reluctance.</p><p>Since he was giving them to a Nascent Soul cultivator, Qin Sang had no intention of reclaiming them.</p><p>Whether Holy Venerable Huiguang kept them for himself or left them within his sect as a treasured artifact to prevent future Ancient Demon disturbances, it was impossible for them to be returned to him.</p><p>Perhaps, in ancient times, the value of the Demon Subduing Stake far surpassed that of the Five Elements Elixir.</p><p>But Qin Sang believed it was worthwhile.</p><p>The Demon Subduing Stake's uses were too narrow, and it didn't aid his cultivation.</p><p>Previously, it served as a container to seal the Demonic Fire.</p><p>Only the origin of the Nine Nether Demonic Fire remained unrefined, but Qin Sang possessed the Mani Pearl.  Upon obtaining this treasure, Qin Sang discovered that the Mani Pearl could serve as a vessel for the Demonic Fire's origin.</p><p>As for how to deal with future encounters with Ancient Demons, that wasn't something he needed to consider now.</p><p>This exchange, firstly, allowed his Avatar to escape danger.</p><p>The Avatar was not only a precious Dao Manifestation Tree, but had already sensed the opportunity for a breakthrough.  He would soon advance to late-Nascent Soul.  Wielding a spiritual treasure and possessing the Ice Soul Divine Light divine ability, his combat power was likely no less than his true body's.</p><p>Moreover, the Avatar represented a second life. If it could be saved, it should be saved.</p><p>Secondly, he would obtain the Five Elements Elixir.</p><p>With the value of the Five Elements Elixir, as long as news spread, there was a chance to exchange it for the Spirit Rhinoceros Immortal Fruit or other miraculous elixirs.</p><p>Furthermore, the cultivation world was ravaged by demonic corruption, with countless lives lost, which was certainly not what Qin Sang wanted to see. He was still a long way from Nascent Soul ascension, and he couldn't escape either.</p><p>He could only lament the unpredictable nature of the world.</p><p>He had been considering how to repair the Demon Subduing Stake after refining the Demonic Fire, and had specifically taken on a disciple for this purpose.  Unexpectedly, he was trading away the treasure so soon.</p><p>The Demonic Banners, which sealed the spiritual fire, stood upright.</p><p>Qin Sang's brow flickered, and the fire lotus spun out.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Mani Pearl flew out of his dantian, hovering beside Qin Sang.</p><p>The fire lotus gradually became illusory, transforming into Demonic Fire, drifting towards the banners, eventually forming a ball of fire that enveloped all the banners.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression turned serious as he changed his hand seals.  Within the Demonic Fire, layers of fire waves formed, continuously converging towards the banners, forming a thick 'shell' around them.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's movements, threads of the Demonic Fire's origin were extracted from each banner. Gradually, the banners toppled one after another, and all the Demonic Fire's origin converged into one place.</p><p>The Demonic Fire reformed into the fire lotus, with a longan-sized flame gently flickering at its core.</p><p>It was also black, but more restrained and profound than the Demonic Fire Qin Sang controlled!</p><p>Yet, Qin Sang could sense an incredibly violent and astonishing power within it. This power was still beyond his control, pacified only by the resonance of their origins.</p><p>"This is the origin of the Demonic Fire..."</p><p>Qin Sang murmured as he gazed at the flame.</p><p>If not for this obstacle, his divine sense breakthrough would have made things much easier this time.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>The Mani Pearl moved horizontally.  With a thought, Qin Sang guided the fire lotus, carrying the Demonic Fire's origin, into the Mani Pearl.  He then saw the flame disperse, threads of origin seeping out of the wish-fulfilling jewel.</p><p>Finally, the outer ring of red fire on the wish-fulfilling jewel was tinged with black fire, the Demonic Fire's origin sealed within.</p><p>He summoned it into his hand and, after a brief examination, confirmed that both the Demonic Fire's origin and the Mani Pearl were unharmed. Qin Sang nodded slightly, feeling that the Mani Pearl was becoming increasingly like a demonic artifact.</p><p>Next, Qin Sang's fingers flickered, streams of light sinking into the Demonic Banners.  The bone-chilling coldness returned as the soul threads that formed the banners disintegrated, finally dissipating into the world.</p><p>Qin Sang triggered the internal restrictions of the Demon Subduing Stake.  The banner poles immediately transformed, reverting to their original forms.</p><p>He held two sections of what appeared to be dark iron, the Demon Subduing Stake, with perfectly smooth breaks.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at them, stood up, pushed open the stone door, traversed the Five Elements Divine Restriction, and flew towards one of the caves.</p><p>...</p><p>The Avatar descended from the sky.</p><p>His movements drew the attention of the others.</p><p>Seemingly choosing at random a cave not yet destroyed by the Five Elements Divine Restriction, the Avatar stepped inside, cast a protective restriction to block others' perception upon entering, and cautiously incorporated the Ice Soul Divine Light.  However, he didn't conceal the marks on his body.</p><p>They could monitor his movements at any time.</p><p>When the Avatar entered the cave, the Demon Subduing Stake had already been discreetly delivered.</p><p>Having retrieved it, the Avatar didn't rush to return.  He disguised himself before exiting the cave, flying into the air, and presenting the treasure.</p><p>"It is indeed the Demon Subduing Stake!"</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang received it, his eyes gleaming.  After carefully examining it, he exclaimed joyfully, "The internal restrictions of this treasure aren't severely damaged.  With this poor monk's refinement, although it cannot be fully restored, it should be possible to temporarily mend the break and restore several layers of its power."</p><p>Saint King Qinghu had been observing the situation. Upon hearing this, his expression visibly relaxed.</p><p>"This poor monk needs to invoke my heart fire and concentrate on refining this treasure. Time is of the essence. I cannot be disturbed during the process and can only leave behind a sliver of instinctive thought to maintain the Dhyana Arhat Formation.  I'll have to rely on you all and the Saint King.  Disperse the formation, evade its attacks, and engage in guerilla tactics with the Ancient Demon as much as possible. Do not let the Ancient Demon escape."</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang spoke while communicating with the Saint King through divine sense.</p><p>"Old monk, you'd best hurry.  This king has summoned the artifact spirit, but there's no response. The Ancient Demon has lost its reason, but it still perfectly controls the spiritual treasure. Its power is too formidable. A single hit is either fatal or crippling. Even though guerilla tactics are easier, they likely won't last long."</p><p>As Saint King Qinghu spoke, he removed the phoenix hairpin from his head and tossed it upwards.</p><p>The hairpin split into four, transforming into four heavenly pillars that stood at the edge of the suspended lake.</p><p>The lake surface expanded, providing space for everyone to maneuver.</p><p>This, in turn, further highlighted the terror of the Demonic Body.  The Demonic Body roared repeatedly. Wherever the five-elemental spiritual light passed, the lake water churned, as if being torn apart, relying on the heavenly pillars for stability.</p><p>Everyone evaded its attacks, assisted Saint King Qinghu in sharing the pressure, and maintained the formation to the best of their abilities.</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang replied and turned to the Avatar, his tone relaxed, "The benefactor is truly a remarkable individual of this era. No wonder Elder Lu could befriend you. Xingji has always spoken highly of Elder Lu, describing him as flawless jade, a man living up to his name. It's a pity that Elder Lu has high aspirations, having chosen a superior secret art of the Unremembered Mountain Sect. Due to the secret art's flaws, he hasn't made much progress for years."</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang was surprisingly knowledgeable about the Unremembered Mountain Sect and Lu Zhang.</p><p>In fact, Lu Zhang had long been known as a genius within the Unremembered Mountain Sect. His fame once rivaled Cheng Shenzi's. After Cheng Shenzi accidentally damaged his Dao Foundation, Lu Zhang was considered the most likely candidate to succeed Sect Master Situ.</p><p>Other sects paid close attention to top geniuses from prominent sects like the Unremembered Mountain Sect.  Regardless of the relationship between the Unremembered Mountain Sect and the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery, they would certainly have thoroughly investigated Lu Zhang's background.</p><p>A flicker of sentimentality crossed Holy Venerable Huiguang's eyes, as if lamenting Lu Zhang's situation.</p><p>The Avatar felt a chill run down his spine as he listened.</p><p>He had claimed to be close friends with Lu Zhang. If he didn't understand these secrets, it wouldn't be easy to explain.</p><p>"It's not due to flaws in the secret art, but the lack of an important spiritual object.  A few years ago, this junior traveled with Fellow Daoist Lu in the Southern Region and captured a nearly mature Stone Toad. Fellow Daoist Lu obtained this spiritual object and returned to the mountain for closed-door cultivation.  He should be making significant progress soon."</p><p>As he spoke, the Avatar glanced towards Poison King's grey cocoon.</p><p>It was because of that incident that he was targeted by the Strange-Faced Man, leading to the subsequent turmoil.</p><p>With Poison King trapped, he could still exploit the identity of the Xie Family Ancestor.  Once Poison King was freed, his connection to his true body would be exposed.</p><p>Whether Poison King used the opportunity to pressure him or exposed him directly, it would be troublesome.</p><p>It was best to withdraw early!</p><p>"No wonder the Unremembered Mountain Sect didn't send anyone to participate in the Ullambana Assembly."</p><p>Holy Venerable Huiguang seemed to have realized something.  He had been pondering this matter.  "The Pu Mountain Xie Family... This poor monk has some recollection.  They were once a prominent clan in the Zhuozhou region, declining for many years before finally welcoming a leader of resurgence."</p><p>"Senior's vast knowledge is truly admirable. This junior is filled with respect. This junior is limited in talent and doesn't dare to aim too high. However, this junior will never allow the Xie Family bloodline to end with my generation.  Otherwise, I would have no face to meet my ancestors in the afterlife.  If the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?  This junior is duty-bound to stop the demonic tribulation!"</p><p>The Avatar spoke with a solemn tone.</p><p>"If all cultivators under Heaven possessed such spirit and broadmindedness, how could this great chaos have arisen?" Holy Venerable Huiguang sighed, not delaying further.  He raised his hand and produced a jade bottle.</p><p>The Avatar hurriedly received it with both hands, gently uncorking the bottle.  He immediately sensed a faint fragrance.  Judging by its appearance and scent, it was undoubtedly the Five Elements Elixir.</p><p>"Many thanks, Senior, for bestowing the elixir!"</p><p>The Avatar accepted the Five Elements Elixir.  After the two Nascent Soul cultivators removed the marks, he didn't hesitate.  Under the curious gazes of the others, he retreated into Emperor Bestowed Mountain, seemingly not in a hurry to leave, as if truly searching for a place to heal his injuries.</p><p>He didn't notice Saint King Qinghu glancing at him as he left.</p><p>Looking at Qin Sang's Avatar's retreating figure, a strange glint flashed in Saint King Qinghu's eyes.  He glanced at Holy Venerable Huiguang before looking away.</p><p>The old monk's intentions were crystal clear.</p><p>Without eliminating the Heavenly Dao Demonic Sound, the Five Elements Elixir was useless.  It didn't matter who possessed it.  Other matters were unimportant.</p><p>Those people didn't know that the more opportunities they obtained, the closer they got to Nascent Soul, the faster they would die.</p><p>By giving away the elixir, the Sweet Dew Chan Monastery could eliminate one, or possibly several, potential rivals.  What a clever move by the old monk.</p><p>The Avatar returned to Emperor Bestowed Mountain, his figure disappearing into the clouds and mist, entering the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang's true body was lying in wait within the sword formation, awaiting an opportunity to escape. Out of caution, he wasn't rushing to rejoin his Avatar.</p><p>Suddenly, the true body's expression changed, and a fierce glint flashed in the Avatar's eyes!</p>
