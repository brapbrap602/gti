<h1>Chapter 742: The Tokens</h1><p>Chapter 742: The Tokens</p><p>“You, demon cultivator, flaunting your two beauties—the envy of all!  Living the high life, yet unafraid of dying in the Seven Killing Hall?  Those two might just find new lovers and cuckold you!”</p><p>Cui Ji, publicly defeated by Qin Sang and unceremoniously thrown off the island, still nursed his resentment.  He’d wanted revenge back then.  </p><p>But Elder Zou had secretly warned him, leveraging the Merchant Guild’s rules.  Cui Ji knew he was in the wrong, outmatched, and had to swallow his pride.</p><p>He didn’t like to admit it, but he feared Qin Sang.  That “废人法宝” (ruined artifact) was incredibly strange and powerful, capable of turning the tide of battle. He spent a long time restoring its spiritual essence.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang now, old and new grievances surged, provoking his sarcastic remarks.</p><p>Others were intrigued, watching them with amusement.  They hadn’t expected even a group of eight to have such a pair of rivals.  There would be a show.</p><p>Xiang Yi frowned.</p><p>Qin Sang said calmly, “Before this cultivator ascends, Daoist Cui will likely have gone ahead to scout the way. I wonder if you’ll still be so quick-witted in the Nine Nether Yellow Springs?”</p><p>Xiang Yi stopped their argument, warning coldly, “Whatever grievances you have, forget them once inside the Seven Killing Hall. If internal strife jeopardizes the Merchant Guild’s mission, I will hold you accountable!  And let me assure you, your connections within the Guild won’t save you!”</p><p>Cui Ji fell silent, sitting on his stool, glaring hatefully at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t care. He could have taken down Cui Ji then without the double-headed… thing.  If Cui Ji dared to cause trouble, the Seven Killing Hall would be his tomb!</p><p>With everyone assembled, Xiang Yi took a golden box from his pouch, opened it, revealing eight jade pendants. “These are your credentials. One each.  Only these will grant you entry to the Seven Killing Hall.”</p><p>Xiang Yi paused, his hand rising. The pendants flew towards them.</p><p>Qin Sang caught his pendant, inspecting it with his spiritual sense. The jade was remarkably fragile, yet held an incredibly intricate enchantment, impossible to replicate.</p><p>Then, they began questioning Xiang Yi about the Seven Killing Hall, exchanging information.  Of the eight, only Xiang Yi had been inside during its last appearance. The others were first-timers.</p><p>Though Qin Sang had gathered information beforehand, nothing beat firsthand experience. He seized the chance to question Xiang Yi.</p><p>With the Seven Killing Hall's opening imminent, they left for the Inner Sea via teleportation array without delay.</p><p>…</p><p>Across the Desolate Island, the teleportation array was located on Tianxing Island, the largest human island.  Legend says that during the height of the Witch Clan’s power, when humanity was most vulnerable, it was this island that provided a foothold, giving Tianxing Island unique status among humans.  </p><p>Tianxing Island housed the largest human city.  Qin Sang longed to see it, but time was short, and he left with Xiang Yi.</p><p>The Inner Sea was noticeably safer than the Demon Sea.  Though deep-sea beasts lurked, they weren’t as numerous.</p><p>Traveling as eight powerful cultivators, they took turns powering a shuttle, journeying day and night southeast.</p><p>Their destination: East Gate Island.  It was said to be one of the safer routes into the storm and towards the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>East Gate Island was actually quite small, originally home to an insignificant sect.  Only when the Seven Killing Hall opened did it become bustling.</p><p>Upon arrival, the island teemed with cultivators.  Before even entering the city, Qin Sang sensed many powerful auras, including several Nascent Soul masters!</p><p>Everyone became subdued and discreet.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll rest in the city before entering the storm.”</p><p>Xiang Yi led the way.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced east. The sea appeared darker than elsewhere. On the horizon, a vast, dark line stretched from south to north as far as the eye could see—the infamous storm zone.</p><p>He'd heard tales of its terror, but the Seven Killing Hall wasn't deep within the storm; its power increased the further in one went.  Their cultivation was sufficient to reach the Hall.</p><p>They rented a courtyard. Xiang Yi warned them against causing trouble and implicating others.  The island's cultivators were either powerful or well-connected—and many were unruly, easily provoked.</p><p>Qin Sang was curious.  Since leaving the Great Desolate Island, Xiang Yi hadn't let them contact any other East Pole Alliance teams.</p><p>The vast East Pole Alliance couldn't possibly only have eight slots.</p><p>All the teams were completely isolated.  This situation was quite strange. It seemed the East Pole Alliance was planning something big; some treasure must be worth such a massive effort.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dwell on it, nor did he want to investigate further.</p><p>He was here for the ancient teleportation array and didn't want to be caught in a major storm.</p><p>He also knew very well that he had only agreed to assist Xiang Yi in exchange for a spot; he wasn't here to die for him.  If a crisis arose, he'd look for a way out first.</p><p>The others must have been thinking the same.</p><p>Closing the door, Qin Sang sat quietly for a while, then took out a set of formation flags and laid them out in the room, adding several layers of restrictive prohibitions.</p><p>After ensuring there were no omissions, Qin Sang took out the jade box containing the Winter Nether Cold Flame.  He hesitated for a moment before finally opening it.</p><p>For years, he'd been pondering how to handle the Winter Nether Cold Flame.</p><p>Refining it into a fire pearl would be too wasteful.  Such a rare cold flame couldn't be kept to himself; it felt like a missed opportunity.</p><p>But multiple attempts at taming it had failed.  The mark of the Winter Nether Master had fused with the flame; the flame itself may even have been born from the Winter Nether Master.</p><p>His cultivation was still too low; he had no chance at all.</p><p>The Seven Killing Hall was approaching, concerning his future, he couldn't hesitate any longer.</p><p>The Void Heaven Thunder was the Xu Ling Sect's most treasured item.  The notes left by the Golden Core cultivator naturally wouldn't contain the Xu Ling Sect's refining methods, but a few mentions were made.</p><p>Qin Sang had once possessed a Void Heaven Thunder, studying it for a long time.</p><p>Most importantly, while the Winter Nether Cold Flame was violent, it was remarkably docile in the presence of Nine Nether Demon Fire.  This solved the biggest problem, an advantage the Xu Ling Sect didn't have.</p><p>As long as Qin Sang didn't make a mistake, he didn't have to worry about backlash.</p><p>There was a good chance he could refine the Winter Nether Cold Flame into a fire pearl, using the Void Heaven Thunder as a reference.</p>
