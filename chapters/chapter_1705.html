<h1>Chapter 1696: The Great Five Elements Forbidden Divine Light</h1><p>A spirit-transforming puppet?  Mo Xingdao instantly grew wary, his eyes changing.  Huiguang Saint pretended not to notice, continuing, “The Heavenly Demon's Sound is like a thorn in our backs. We spirit-transforming cultivators are but caged beasts, unwilling to be slaughtered.  The Eastern Sea Abyss still offers a glimmer of hope. The Saint and I will depart for ascension after settling our affairs; we won't remain in this world long. Time is short; even with the combined strength of both races, creating a spirit-transforming puppet from scratch is impossible. I observe your puppet, Master Mo, possesses remarkable potential; a mere Nascent Soul level being capable of comprehending Yin-Yang Escape Technique. The Saint and I are willing to fully support your refinement of this puppet to further its capabilities!”  As a lone cultivator, Mo Xingdao had weathered countless storms and endured many ups and downs.</p><p>His tempered spirit allowed Mo Xingdao to quickly regain his composure and rational thought, realizing the true intentions of the two races' spirit-transforming cultivators.</p><p>They coveted his puppet! However, no hardship could compare to the despair of the Heavenly Demon's Sound. Mo Xingdao was overwhelmed by the despair subtly conveyed in Huiguang Saint's words.</p><p>He felt lost and helpless.  Any grand cultivator would likely have a similar reaction upon hearing this.</p><p>A lifetime of painstaking cultivation, free from distractions, sacrificing readily available wealth and pleasure, all for a single clear goal: breaking through to the spirit-transforming realm.</p><p>Ascension! Transcendence! Now, that goal had crumbled. Everything they had pursued had lost its meaning. Could they truly abandon their devotion to the Dao, succumb to mundane desires, and even indulge in debauchery, living out their remaining days in a haze of apathy?</p><p>Were the two races' spirit-transforming cultivators demanding he hand over the puppet, or did they intend to offer something in exchange? Countless thoughts raced through Mo Xingdao's mind.</p><p>Ganlu Monastery was the foremost Buddhist temple, a dominant force in the cultivation world; they could undoubtedly offer tempting conditions, but aside from ascension, nothing could pique his interest in the slightest!</p><p>“Ancient Demon!  Beasts!” A flash of insight struck Mo Xingdao.  He urgently said,</p><p>“Since it's the Demon's Sound, didn't you capture the Ancient Demon and interrogate it?  Could the rampaging beasts in the storm zone be due to some change in their lair?”  Seeing Mo Xingdao's quick recovery and focus on the key points, Huiguang Saint couldn't help but regard him highly, explaining, “Regarding the origin of the Heavenly Demon's Sound, there are two theories:  First, the sound has always existed, and the Celestial Palace served to suppress it, protecting the world's inhabitants. With the Celestial Palace's ascension, this world lost its protector, leaving us vulnerable. If this is true, the anomaly may have only just begun, and no one knows if it will ultimately lead to the barrier's collapse and the extinction of all life. The other theory is that the Celestial Palace's ascension triggered this world's instability, causing an unknown change deep within the Abyss; that is the source of the Demon's Sound. The beasts originally resided in the Eastern Sea Abyss and wouldn't usually roam. The Abyss is the most mysterious place in this world; its secrets remain unexplored. Countless spirit-transforming elders have attempted to delve into its depths, only managing to painstakingly forge a path to the Waymark Gate.” Huiguang Saint paused, giving Mo Xingdao time to digest these secrets, before continuing,  “I've ordered close monitoring of the storm zone to try and capture a beast. As for the Ancient Demon… the Saint and I have been trying to help it regain consciousness.  We discovered that the Ancient Demon and its spirit seem to be one entity, a fusion of at least three different consciousnesses, consuming each other while being assaulted by the Heavenly Demon's Sound.  It's in utter chaos, consumed by madness and confusion; its intelligence may be completely extinguished.  It would likely take several hundred years, or even longer, for any chance of recovery, and with the Heavenly Demon's Sound persisting, it's practically impossible.” As he spoke, Huiguang Saint led Mo Xingdao into an inner chamber, revealing the demon's body on the Demon-Sealing Stake.</p><p>The demon's body was even more horrifying than before, a shocking sight—swollen flesh, distorted features, twisted and mangled, resembling a terrifying meatball.</p><p>It was unclear what methods the two spirit-transforming cultivators used, but the demon's body was now calm, no longer roaring.  However, Mo Xingdao could sense the madness emanating from within.</p><p>Previously, they had thought it was demonic corruption; now they knew the Heavenly Demon's Sound was the true culprit.</p><p>The Holy Sage Huiguang didn't hide the puppet's condition from Mo Xingdao, explaining their intentions in detail.</p><p>"The spirit is unconscious, making it less resistant to external forces.  The Saint King and I have pondered this for a long time, drawing upon the methods of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect in controlling artifacts through formations. We believe there's a good chance of manipulating this treasure.  The Five Elements Crown's most powerful ability, the Great Five Elements Banishing Divine Light, uses 'banishment' and 'reversal' to its advantage. The reversed Five Elements Divine Light excels at destruction, something we experienced firsthand during the Demon Suppression War. The regular Five Elements Divine Light is unparalleled in its sealing power – it's what the Saint King and I value most. When we encountered the ferocious beasts in Gui Xu, we used the Five Elements Seal to restrain them, allowing for a swift escape and avoiding further danger. However..." Huiguang's tone changed, becoming grave. "Because the spirit is out of control, controlling the Five Elements Crown risks being consumed by its madness. Multiple people will need to share the burden."</p><p>"So, my puppet is essential to you both," Mo Xingdao said with a wry smile, knowing he was powerless to resist. He asked frankly, "How do you intend to obtain it...?"  Huiguang looked at him intently, replying, "It depends on whether it is your life-bound puppet." Mo Xingdao replied quietly, "What if it's not?"</p><p>"The Saint King and I will offer treasures and fulfill all your requests within our capabilities. Afterward, you will be free to travel the continent and the East Sea unimpeded; no one will dare to trouble you. The Ganlu Temple and your descendants will forge an eternal alliance…" Huiguang stated confidently.</p><p>Such promises would make others ecstatic. Mo Xingdao, however, didn't even bother to lift an eyelid.</p><p>"What if it *is* my life-bound puppet?" This was precisely why the two Nascent Soul cultivators had spent so much time explaining things to him.</p><p>Life-bound puppets are vastly different from ordinary puppets. Similar to life-bound treasures, they share a fate with their owner, their dao foundations intertwined. If the owner dies, the puppet’s power plummets, and its potential is extinguished.</p><p>If they hadn't suspected it was Mo Xingdao's life-bound puppet, they wouldn't have needed this explanation.  They could have simply threatened him with his own life to get the puppet.</p><p>Even if Huiguang, as the leader of the righteous path, hesitated to resort to outright force, many coercive and tempting methods were available.</p><p>"Only the Heavenly Demon Sound is truly threatening to us. We hear of a puppet technique akin to spirit fusion. We will fully assist you in advancing your puppet further.  If you use this spirit fusion technique to take control, could you then circumvent the Heavenly Tribulation?" Huiguang asked, turning the question back on Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Mo Xingdao’s face changed.</p><p>"With insufficient cultivation, forcibly fusing with the puppet would inevitably result in backlash, even if successful.  Even if temporary control is achieved, the consequences are unimaginable. At best, future advancement will be impossible; at worst, you will lose yourself and truly become an unconscious puppet!" Huiguang stared at him, silent.</p><p>Mo Xingdao quickly calmed himself, realizing this proposal might be his best option.</p><p>Considering the fate of Zi Lei Zhenren, Mo Xingdao didn't believe his willpower surpassed his. Attempting a breakthrough would be suicide.</p><p>The normal path to Nascent Soul and ascension was closed. He had to find another way. Escape this world's prison, reach the higher realms, and then seek a solution – this was his only recourse.</p><p>Even without the pressure of Nascent Soul cultivation, this remained his sole path. Huiguang and the Qinghu Saint King's willingness to help him refine the puppet was an invaluable opportunity.  Even with the Yin-Yang Puppet Crystal, he alone would struggle to improve the puppet at the Yuan Ying stage.</p><p>If he missed this chance, once the two Nascent Soul cultivators left, he would never find such help again.</p><p>Seeing Mo Xingdao's silence, Huiguang continued, "If you are confident enough, we can also help you forcibly break through to the Nascent Soul stage. With the puppet's protection, you might have a slightly higher chance of surviving the Heavenly Tribulation. However, if you fail, and perish before the Heart Demon Tribulation, the Saint King and I will use a secret technique to extract your remaining essence and place it within the puppet, temporarily preventing its decline and allowing us to control it. Of course, this technique is not permanent, so you need not worry about being controlled forever." Huiguang's words were chilling.</p><p>Mo Xingdao was puzzled.</p><p>"Why must it be this way?  Couldn't we wait until my soul puppet reaches the Nascent Soul stage, and I control it to accompany both senior masters?"  The Green Fox Saint King, who had remained silent, scoffed, disdainfully saying, "Foolish dream!  Not to mention the unimaginable dangers deep within the Abyss, simply the spiritual pressure there is unbearable for a mere Nascent Soul cultivator. You'd burst before even reaching the Dao Mark Gate…"  The Hui Guang Saint nodded slightly.</p><p>"Countless Nascent Soul masters have perished in the Abyss over the ages. The journey to the Dao Mark Gate is fraught with peril.  The Saint King and I will barely manage ourselves; even with a puppet to protect you, your safety cannot be guaranteed."…</p><p>Manzhou Province.  Bottom of the Poison Lake.  The old residence of the Weeping Spirit Cave Master. The avatars and the Ghost Mother arrived to meet them.  Qin Sang and Liuli felt a connection and went out to greet them.</p><p>Entering the cave dwelling, the Ghost Mother's eyes lit up upon seeing Liuli. She scrutinized her, clicking her tongue in admiration, then glanced at Qin Sang with a teasing smile.</p><p>"What a stunning beauty! No wonder you've been lingering, forgetting all about your poor wife back home!"  Qin Sang, no stranger to the Ghost Mother's sharp tongue, still felt his face stiffen slightly.  Who would have thought a cultivator who had lived since ancient times could be so outspoken?</p><p>And she had the power to back up her outspokenness.  Glancing at Liuli, seeing she was only frowning and not yet angry, Qin Sang quickly ushered the Ghost Mother inside, changing the subject to ease the tension.</p><p>He had many things he needed to ask the Ghost Mother. Through his avatar's consciousness, Qin Sang already knew about the occupation of Luye and the control of the Moon Guard, and that he had gained two more grand disciples, forming the beginnings of a faction.</p><p>He hadn't intended to establish a faction in Central Plains, yet he had been pushed into it step by step.  He might as well open a branch of the Green Sheep Temple in Central Plains.  Senior Yunyouzi certainly wouldn't mind expanding his influence there.</p><p>The cultivation techniques and secret arts he'd obtained from the Wuxiang Immortal Sect alone would be enough to support a sect. Luye, though small, could serve as a temporary sect grounds.</p><p>However, he still had many unresolved problems.  He'd address those later. After some pleasantries, Qin Sang focused his mind on his dantian, activating the Yunyou Sword intent. He wrapped the sleeping Gu King in a poison pearl and slowly floated it out of his body.</p><p>"This vicious insect is something I unexpectedly obtained. I have no way to deal with it for now, and it's a risk if it's exposed, quite troublesome. Would you have a look, senior?" Recalling the encounter on Emperor Mandate Mountain, he knew the Poison King had a way to track the Gu King. Qin Sang and Liuli had been on high alert, closely monitoring the news about the legacy cave, ready to leave at any moment.</p><p>Did the Ghost Mother have a way to subdue the Gu King? The Gu King remained asleep, its body completely white. Qin Sang briefly described the Gu King's abilities and origins.</p><p>"It's the art of Gu cultivation," the Ghost Mother nodded, unafraid of the Gu King suddenly spraying poison, extending her right hand, pinching the Gu King between two fingers, and examining it closely.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the Ghost Mother's pupils were twinkling like stars, emitting an unusual light. He sat quietly, not daring to disturb her.</p><p>After a quarter of an hour, the Ghost Mother blinked, her pupils returning to normal.  She said, "A crude art of Gu cultivation, but it has its merits. From my observation, it seems that an external force was artificially introduced, grafted onto the Gu insect through Gu cultivation, thereby giving it new vitality. The ability to track is based on this connection, but it can only sense within a certain distance, so finding you won't be that easy." After a moment's thought, the Ghost Mother continued, "This is not difficult to solve." Then, the Ghost Mother told Qin Sang to dispel his sword intent.</p><p>Sensing the change in the surroundings, the Gu King's wings fluttered as it began to awaken. The Ghost Mother flicked her fingers, and clumps of white mist floated towards the Gu King, quickly enveloping it. Then, the Ghost Mother brought her palms together, and the mist suddenly contracted.</p><p>The Gu King's jade-like body was imprinted with mottled patterns, like naturally formed cloud patterns.  Qin Sang used his sword intent to suppress it again.</p><p>The Ghost Mother said, "This vicious insect has been drained of its potential by crude Gu cultivation; its intelligence is low, and unless it receives a miraculous opportunity, it has no chance of advancing. Of course, at least for Nascent Soul cultivators, it is still very threatening. However, if your ambitions go beyond that, you might as well let the poison pearl absorb it. The poison pearl, formed from the ability of a lazy silkworm with the bloodline of a divine silkworm, has far greater potential than this insect." The Ghost Mother's words coincided with Qin Sang's thoughts.</p><p>With the Ghost Mother's guidance, Qin Sang could finally make a decision. However, the Gu King's poison was so powerful that if the poison pearl absorbed it, it might only improve his poison resistance, which would be a waste.</p><p>The poison-resistant armor had a narrow range of effect, and only a few cultivators in the cultivation world were adept at using poison, and its current power was barely sufficient.</p><p>If he could subdue the Gu King, he could use it for a while. Once he advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, he could absorb it later.</p><p>Qin Sang asked the Ghost Mother about this. Unexpectedly, the Ghost Mother looked at him sideways,</p><p>"After swallowing so many poisonous things, you can only use it for poison resistance? The divine silkworm bloodline wouldn't be that simple! I only later discovered that the true ability of that lazy silkworm, even if only related to the poison path, had not been fully awakened. Do as I say, let the poison pearl absorb the Gu King, and you will naturally be able to control fierce poisons."</p>
