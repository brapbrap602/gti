<h1>Chapter 2028: Strike First to Gain the Upper Hand</h1><p>For some unknown reason, the outer void was also trembling, and the fluctuations from the Thousand鈞 Ring hadn't completely dissipated. This indicated that the scattered spatial fragments here were likely more than just this one piece.</p><p>However, the Thousand鈞 Ring's fluctuations had become extremely faint, far less clear than the sensation from the recently recovered fragment.  This situation might be due to the other fragments being too small or too severely damaged.</p><p>Qin Sang naturally wanted to retrieve all the fragments, but the current upheaval left him no time to consider them.  Recalling his focus, he swept his gaze across the surroundings, his brows tightly furrowed.</p><p>On the vast ocean surface, the shadows of distant islands loomed. The sky was shrouded in thick, black clouds.</p><p>The black clouds pressed down extremely low. There was no thunder or lightning, only utter darkness, bringing a heavy pressure to the world below. Even with Qin Sang's cultivation, he couldn't completely dispel this feeling, and he clearly knew that there was undoubtedly an unknown danger within the clouds.</p><p>Fortunately, since they had entered the archipelago, the black clouds had remained like this, without actively attacking them.</p><p>But at this moment, the world trembled, and waves surged in the sea. As the tremors intensified, waves several zhang high could be seen everywhere.</p><p>‘Splash!’</p><p>A large wave crashed towards him.</p><p>Qin Sang stood firm, unmoving.  Just as the wave was about to slam into him, it suddenly split open, narrowly avoiding him.</p><p>Similar scenes occurred repeatedly.  Not a single drop of water touched Qin Sang. He looked up, staring at the sky above, where the black clouds were also in turmoil, churning violently.</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't tell when the tremors had begun, only that it was around the time the Thousand鈞 Ring experienced its transformation. So, was the source of the tremors the Thousand鈞 Ring?</p><p>It appeared to be the world trembling, but in reality, they were within a formation.  It was highly likely that some change had occurred within the grand formation.  The Thousand鈞 Ring retrieving a Minor World fragment, such a significant event, could very well have shaken the foundation of the grand formation.</p><p>“Could it cause the grand formation to collapse…”</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself.</p><p>The Xin Family had dispatched so many experts from their clan and dared to invite two Void Refinement cultivators to accompany them, conspiring with tigers.  Their ambitions were clearly vast.  They couldn't possibly be after the Thousand鈞 Ring alone; there must be other unknown secrets hidden here.</p><p>These secrets might also be related to the Thousand鈞 Ring.  It would be a pity to destroy them.</p><p>Qin Sang thought of the mysterious pavilion and high altar within the Thousand鈞 Ring's space, which might hold hidden mysteries.  Unfortunately, each time he could only stay inside for a very short period before having to come out and wait for the space to stabilize before entering again.  There was no time to investigate them one by one now.</p><p>As his thoughts raced, the surrounding phenomena grew increasingly terrifying.</p><p>Above and below, terrifying waves were everywhere.  The black clouds churned furiously, as if the heavens were about to collapse, ready to crash down and destroy everything.</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt something and turned to look back the way he had come.</p><p>Shockingly, the phenomena in the distance were even more astonishing, forming black flowing clouds, resembling black dragons, or celestial rivers, vast and mighty.</p><p>Endless black clouds surged forth, engulfing the islands.  It seemed that more violent changes were occurring in the outer regions of the grand formation, and the collapse would begin from the periphery.</p><p>Seeing this scene, a strong sense of foreboding arose in Qin Sang's heart.</p><p>This place might truly be on the verge of collapse.  What followed would undoubtedly be extremely dangerous, not a question of whether or not he could obtain treasures, but whether or not he could escape unscathed.</p><p>Once the grand formation was destroyed, Qin Sang, in his current location, clearly wouldn't have time to escape.</p><p>“At the moment of destruction, could I hide within the Thousand鈞 Ring?”</p><p>Learning that the Thousand鈞 Ring was a fragment of a Minor World, Qin Sang had considered this possibility.</p><p>He put the Thousand鈞 Ring back on his right thumb, subconsciously turning it.  He didn't place all his hope on a single ring, but scanned his surroundings, searching for a hiding place.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang traveled alone, unaware of the situation with Patriarch Pei and the Xin Family cultivators who had left the canyon.</p><p>After their departure, they had been hunting Jade Spirits.</p><p>The group moved in a mighty procession, their sharp gazes sweeping across all directions, leaving no gaps.  Even the Jade Spirits' ability to conceal themselves within the void couldn't escape so many eyes.  However, despite searching for some time, they found nothing.</p><p>Young Master Xin at the front suddenly stopped.  Everyone thought they had finally found a Jade Spirit, but when they caught up, they found nothing, only Young Master Xin with a furrowed brow and a solemn expression.</p><p>“Xin Sheng, what's wrong?”</p><p>Patriarch Pei, who had been trailing behind, seemingly unconcerned with the Jade Spirits, stepped forward and asked.</p><p>Young Master Xin gently shook his head, saying in a deep voice, “Searching like this is too slow! And those Jade Spirits won't stay in one place, they'll move around.”</p><p>Even if the formation diagram only showed the outer regions of the grand formation, the area was still vast.  It would take a considerable amount of time to cover the entire perimeter.</p><p>Patriarch Pei's eyes flashed with a profound look.  “You want to split up and search?”</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>Young Master Xin glanced over the Xin Family cultivators. “We must find enough Jade Spirits as quickly as possible and give them to Elder Qin to refine the ferry. Uncle Luo, Great Elder, Second Elder, each of you lead a team and search separately.”</p><p>Steward Luo became anxious upon hearing this. “Before leaving, the Master ordered this old servant not to leave Young Master's side for a moment…”</p><p>Others also echoed his sentiment.</p><p>Young Master Xin waved his hand, interrupting Steward Luo. “We’ve been inside for so long, have we encountered any danger? At least this area should be safe. The Jade Spirits’ concealment technique is quite peculiar. Others might be deceived, but with Uncle Luo and the two Elders personally overseeing the search, we can ensure success. As for me, with the暝 Spirit protecting me, what is there for Uncle Luo to worry about?  How about this, Third Elder, would you accompany me and act as my protector?”</p><p>Everyone looked towards a young man.</p><p>The young man was dressed in white robes, with a youthful face, but his brows held a weariness that belied his appearance.</p><p>His expression shifted slightly, and he flew forward, cupping his hands and replying, “Yes! Rest assured, Steward Luo, this old man will ensure Young Master’s safety.”</p><p>A new generation is born within a family every one or two decades. Cultivators have varying talents and opportunities, and their cultivation speeds differ. High-level cultivators have long lifespans, so addressing each other solely based on seniority would be overly cumbersome.</p><p>Therefore, many families also establish positions. For example, Nascent Soul cultivators in the Xin Family can be promoted to Elders within the clan, with the authority to assist the Family Head in decision-making.</p><p>The Third Elder, in terms of seniority, was Xin Sheng's grandfather and the previous Family Head's uncle, but they addressed each other by their positions.</p><p>The Xin Family had no Family Head, only a Young Master. However, the Third Elder, despite being an elder, showed no disrespect towards Young Master Xin.</p><p>Xin Sheng held the title of Young Master but was effectively the Family Head, having vowed to fulfill the previous Family Head's wishes before officially assuming the position, rather than due to a lack of prestige.</p><p>The entire Xin Family admired and respected this Young Master.</p><p>Firstly, Young Master Xin had successfully controlled the暝 Spirit, which was currently the Xin Family's strongest force and also one of the symbols of the Family Head.</p><p>Secondly, the previous Family Head's sudden demise left a void in leadership within the family, and Patriarch Pei's intentions were unclear.  Externally, powerful enemies were watching covetously. In this time of crisis, Young Master Xin skillfully navigated the complex relationship between Patriarch Pei and that powerful enemy, preserving the Xin Family. This ability was something others couldn't hope to match.</p><p>Seeing that Young Master Xin had made up his mind, Steward Luo couldn't say much more. They divided the manpower, including Patriarch Pei, into five groups.</p><p>“Patriarch Pei, do you need a couple of people to assist you?” Young Master Xin inquired.</p><p>Patriarch Pei scoffed, “Besides you, the others would only hinder this old man.”</p><p>The others dared not show anger or speak, silently moving away.</p><p>“This junior will take his leave first!”</p><p>Young Master Xin bowed and, beckoning to the Third Elder, departed in the designated direction.</p><p>Gazing at Young Master Xin's retreating figure, and then glancing at the direction Steward Luo and the others had gone, a flicker of suspicion crossed Patriarch Pei’s eyes.  Then, a cold smile appeared on his lips, and with a snort, his figure flickered and vanished into thin air.</p><p>“I need to focus on directing the暝 Spirit to sense what’s ahead. The sides and rear are entrusted to Third Elder,” Young Master Xin turned and said.</p><p>The Third Elder immediately responded and deliberately stayed ten zhang behind Young Master Xin. He pinched a hand seal, and a cloud of grey Qi surged from behind him, eventually transforming into an eyeball. The grey eyeball slowly rotated, emitting a sinister light as it stared behind them.</p><p>At the same time, a flash of green light flickered within the Third Elder's sleeve. The source of the light was a jade bracelet. The green light flashed and vanished, leaving no trace of fluctuation, and Young Master Xin remained completely unaware.</p><p>The two flew across the ocean, one in front of the other.</p><p>The strategy of splitting up quickly yielded results. Not long after they began flying, Young Master Xin detected the presence of a Jade Spirit.  The暝 Spirit leaped out from behind her and lunged directly towards a patch of empty space.</p><p>‘Poof!’</p><p>The Jade Spirit was forced to reveal itself, too late to escape as shadows enveloped the surroundings. The shadows twisted and grew grotesque claws, scrambling to grab the Jade Spirit.</p><p>The Jade Spirit darted left and right, unable to escape. Finally, a claw caught its arm, and before it could break free, the other claws descended upon it, instantly submerging the Jade Spirit within the shadows.</p><p>The shadows receded, presenting a jade slip to Young Master Xin. Having successfully retrieved one jade slip, their confidence soared, and they continued onward.</p><p>Islands were left behind them, but they couldn't find a second Jade Spirit. Young Master Xin's gaze remained focused, without a trace of impatience.</p><p>Just then, Young Master Xin stopped again, letting out a soft exclamation.</p><p>“Young Master, what is it?” Third Elder caught up.</p><p>“There's the aura of a Jade Spirit here, but it seems to be inside the mountain…”</p><p>Young Master Xin looked towards the island ahead. The mountain was steep and rugged. After circling half the island, she finally spotted a narrow cave entrance.</p><p>Young Master Xin smiled faintly. “This Jade Spirit has hidden itself well, fortunately, I have the暝 Spirit to assist me…”</p><p>With that, the two entered the cave. They discovered that the cave within was long and winding, with countless forks. However, with the暝 Spirit’s keen senses, the Jade Spirit couldn’t hide. After navigating countless passages, they finally found the Jade Spirit deep underground.</p><p>Retrieving the jade slip, they returned the way they came.</p><p>As they reached the cave entrance, just as Young Master Xin was about to step out, she seemed to sense something. Her footsteps halted abruptly, her gaze sharp as she scanned the outside of the cave.</p><p>The scenery outside remained unchanged: the black sky, the black sea, the hazy mountain shadows, the desolate void – nothing seemed amiss.</p><p>However, Young Master Xin’s expression suddenly changed drastically.  She cried out, "Not good!" and retreated rapidly.</p><p>The Third Elder, still unsure of what had happened, suddenly felt the ground shake violently.  A dense, scalding fog, seemingly out of nowhere, instantly filled the cave.</p><p>The fog was scorching hot, carrying a strange burning power, like a raging fire searing their bodies.</p><p>Immediately afterward, a powerful pressure descended. Young Master Xin and the Third Elder felt their breath catch. A deafening roar echoed as the cave ceiling collapsed above them.  Rocks flew through the air as they were flung out of the cave, landing in a dense fog that now enveloped the mountain.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A crimson shadow flashed within the fog. The surrounding Spiritual Qi violently surged as a gigantic flaming whip appeared, lashing towards Young Master Xin with terrifying force.</p><p>This whip seemed capable of shattering the void itself.  If it struck Young Master Xin and the Third Elder, they would surely die!</p><p>With the crisis upon them, Young Master Xin hurriedly summoned the暝 Spirit to shield her.  A dull thud echoed as the whip struck the暝 Spirit head-on.  The flames tore through the shadows, and although they didn't pierce the暝 Spirit’s body, they left a ghastly wound, burning with crimson fire, as if it were the暝 Spirit’s own blood.</p><p>“Patriarch Pei, what are you doing!”</p><p>Young Master Xin demanded sharply, an expression of disbelief on her face.</p><p>The Third Elder was equally shocked and bewildered.</p><p>This attack… had come from their Xin Family’s Patriarch – Patriarch Pei!</p><p>Patriarch Pei had attacked them, a sneak attack, no less. And it seemed he had also set up a formation around them.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>A figure emerged from the fog, and Patriarch Pei’s cold laughter echoed.  “You cunning girl, trying to use the diversion tactic to deceive this old man.  Unfortunately, you’ve forgotten one principle: overwhelming power conquers all tricks!  This old man doesn’t care about your schemes, or whatever pact you have with that Qin fellow.  As long as I capture you, the truth will be revealed! That thing in your hand, even if it isn’t the Jade璧, it’s certainly something crucial to this place.  Did you really think you could fool this old man’s discerning eye?”</p><p>The premise of any scheme’s success is that the opponent plays along, allowing themselves to be manipulated. Patriarch Pei, however, possessed the power to overturn the table entirely.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The暝 Spirit let out a shrill shriek.</p><p>The crimson fire burned its body, causing endless pain. But the暝 Spirit was no weakling. Its shadowy form writhed, and the wound instantly healed, its body swelling to a colossal size, towering between heaven and earth.</p><p>But Patriarch Pei’s killing move wasn't limited to this.</p><p>The fog churned, and countless rings of fire appeared, forming shackles that descended from the sky.</p><p>Looking at the struggling暝 Spirit, Patriarch Pei sneered, “Did you think this old man didn’t know that your Xin Family manipulates the暝 Spirit by offering blood essence as a sacrifice?  Along this journey, the暝 Spirit must have consumed quite a bit of blood essence, hasn’t it?  Impressive how well you concealed its weakness.  However, how many more times can the暝 Spirit attack? This Abyssal Yang Infinite Formation of mine has been prepared for you for a long time!”</p><p>Terror filled Young Master Xin’s face.</p><p>She had believed her disguise to be perfect, but her opponent had seen through her all along. This feeling was utterly despairing.</p><p>It was a misunderstanding.  There was no special pact between her and Elder Qin. But any explanation would be futile. Patriarch Pei had shown his true colors and would undoubtedly show no mercy. There was no room left for reconciliation.</p><p>“You swore an oath with my father, aren’t you afraid of the oath’s backlash!” Young Master Xin grasped at the last straw.</p><p>“Don’t worry, this old man will capture you alive, sparing your life. Both you and the Xin Family are still useful to me.”</p><p>Patriarch Pei’s tone was playful, as if victory was already in his grasp.</p><p>The Third Elder hovered behind Young Master Xin. After the initial panic, he gradually regained his composure.</p><p>Although his expression was anxious, his eyes held a calmness rare in ordinary people.</p><p>He appeared to stand with Young Master Xin, facing the powerful enemy together.  Inconspicuously, he glanced beyond the fog, his voice filled with feigned resentment.  “Young Master, I saw through this man’s treacherous intentions when the old Family Head was still alive, and now he has finally revealed his fangs! This man has a wolf’s heart. Pleading for mercy is useless.  We must fight with all our might! If Elder Qin and the Great Elder sense the disturbance and come to our aid, we might have a sliver of hope!”</p>
