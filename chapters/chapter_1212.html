<h1>Chapter 1204:  A Top-Tier Treasure</h1><p>Chapter 1204:  A Top-Tier Treasure</p><p>‘Rumble…Rumble…’</p><p>Waves crashed skyward.</p><p>An unknown energy wave impacted the seal, affecting the entire space and creating a terrifying storm.  The intensity almost rivaled the storm belts surrounding the Canglang Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang protected himself, flew to Fat Chicken’s side, and checked the restrictions at the secret realm entrance, ensuring the waves wouldn’t spread.</p><p>“Master, could there be a powerful demon wreaking havoc inside?”</p><p>Fat Chicken asked worriedly.</p><p>It had heard Qin Sang say the altar was connected to a sealed space.  If the seal was broken, those inside were likely freed.  Why then this terrifying phenomenon?</p><p>Qin Sang gently shook his head.</p><p>Tianmu Butterfly perched on Qin Sang’s shoulder, activating its celestial eye to gaze at the underwater seal.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang suddenly opened the secret realm exit, flew out, and looked towards the entrance to the Yuanxu Abyss.</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual tide caused by the Yuanxu Abyss’s tremors was impacting everything around it along the Celestial Scar. Although Qin Sang was some distance away, he could still feel the aftermath of the storm.</p><p>A hurricane hit his face, the forest leaves rustling violently.</p><p>The already unstable fragments of ancient prohibitions nearby became even more agitated.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang immediately guessed the reason. “The source is the Yuanxu Abyss entrance!  Indeed, this is caused by the Zuishen Palace’s tremors!”</p><p>Before the Ziwei Palace appeared, spiritual tide phenomena would occur across the entire Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>In comparison, the Zuishen Palace’s commotion was much smaller.</p><p>It was said that tremors only occurred periodically. Even if the tremors surged out of the Yuanxu Abyss, they could be blocked by a large formation, preventing the waves from destroying other ancient prohibitions and secret realms within the Celestial Scar and causing a chain reaction.</p><p>“Is the seal here directly connected to the Yuanxu Abyss? Or are nearby secret realms affected by the Zuishen Palace’s tremors, leading to this situation?”</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the secret realm, watching the intensifying storm.</p><p>After discovering the underwater restriction connected to an unknown sealed space, Qin Sang had made similar guesses, suspecting the sealed space might be related to the Yuanxu Abyss.</p><p>After all, this place was so close to the Yuanxu Abyss entrance.</p><p>The Yuanxu Abyss was as dangerous as the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield.</p><p>This was why Qin Sang was so cautious, waiting until the Wumu Sword was refined before exploring the sealed space.</p><p>If he had only 10-20% certainty before, seeing the secret realm’s anomalies had raised it to 50%.</p><p>“Whether it's the Yuanxu Abyss or not, I'll have to go in to find out…”</p><p>Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Several hours later, the storm finally showed signs of weakening, but it was far from over; it was just less intense than before.  And it continued, with no telling how long it would last.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Yuanxu Abyss entrance…</p><p>Other cultivators felt the pressure on them lessen slightly.</p><p>The high-crowned Daoist and the white-haired elder sensed the change, exchanged a glance, then simultaneously changed their hand seals.  The light barrier transformed, like an inverted jade bowl, becoming even more stable.</p><p>Knowing the most violent wave of tremors had passed, everyone’s expressions relaxed slightly.</p><p>The two Yuan Ying cultivators were able to spare some attention, habitually sensing their surroundings to ensure nothing was amiss before continuing to activate the spirit array and waiting for the Zuishen Palace to calm down.</p><p>At that moment, a strange energy wave appeared and silently dissipated from a nearby crack in the rock, instantly returning to stillness, without a trace.</p><p>The two Yuan Ying cultivators at the Yuanxu Abyss entrance were completely unaware.</p><p>Tian Shi Sect headquarters…</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the main hall and casually set up a layer of restriction to block the storm.</p><p>Although the energy waves from the sealed space had weakened, Qin Sang still had no intention of going in.</p><p>He knew that like the Ziwei Palace, the Zuishen Palace's tremors wouldn't subside overnight, so he wasn't in a hurry and planned to continue waiting for the Wumu Sword.</p><p>…</p><p>He cultivated amidst the storm, as still as a mountain.</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of green light shot out from Qin Sang’s forehead, dazzlingly brilliant.</p><p>A sword cry surpassed thunder, an earth-shattering sword intent soaring to the heavens!</p><p>The storm, which hadn’t stopped since the tremors began, paused for a moment, then launched an even fiercer counterattack, seemingly enraged at being shocked by a small flying sword.</p><p>Fat Chicken, idly guarding the secret realm exit, suddenly jolted, its feathers standing on end.  For an instant, it felt countless sword energies attacking it and, with a shriek, flapped its wings to escape.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The spirit sword was freely retracted and released, transforming into a dragon, circling briefly in the void before hovering before Qin Sang.</p><p>The Wumu Sword became even more crystal clear, pure as glass, like a work of art that would shatter at a touch.  It was hard to imagine this was a killing sword that had been stained with countless blood.</p><p>‘Buzz…Buzz…’</p><p>The Wumu Sword trembled gently.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled slightly, gently stroking the sword. His fingertips touched his soul-bound sword, feeling the immense sword intent within.</p><p>Fatty the chicken fluttered over, relieved it was a false alarm, but still a little shaken.  "Master, you scared me again!" it complained.</p><p>It looked curiously at the ebony sword. "Is this sword a top-tier magical artifact? Congratulations, Master, on your new treasure!"</p><p>A top-tier magical artifact was considered the strongest in the mortal realm, and the ebony sword's aura clearly indicated it was extraordinary.</p><p>"It is a top-tier artifact..."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly.</p><p>Logically, refining such a large piece of soul-nurturing wood shouldn't result in just a top-tier artifact.  </p><p>It confirmed what Qin Sang had researched before:  For a magical artifact to advance to a spiritual treasure, simply accumulating materials wasn't enough; other opportunities were needed to cultivate a trace of spirituality.</p><p>"This is good. I'll use the ebony sword to contain Master Yunyouzi's spirit. Refining another top-tier artifact wouldn't be easy, and the quality might not meet the requirements.  If it affects the nurturing of his spirit, I'd deeply regret it. The ebony sword is my soul-bound sword; it's easier to control and will be more helpful in nurturing."</p><p>Qin Sang thought, and the ebony sword vanished into his forehead.</p><p>Being a soul-bound artifact, Qin Sang didn't need to spend time refining it further.</p><p>He stood up, thinking, "It's time to investigate.  How long will this upheaval last? I can't wait forever.  If I can truly enter the Abyssal Ruins from here, the chaos caused by the upheaval will be to my advantage."</p><p>Fatty the chicken retreated into the Hun Yuan concentric ring.</p><p>Qin Sang first placed several layers of restrictions at the exit of the secret realm. Then, he flashed into the water, summoned the ebony sword, and opened the sealed passage using the same method as before.</p><p>The seal was weakened by the storm, making it harder than last time, but the ebony sword was far more powerful than the Golden Immersion Sword, so Qin Sang found it easier.</p><p>Underwater, the spirit sword made phantom slashes, leaving trails of sword energy.  The storm on the surface became even more violent.</p><p>Soon, the vortex reappeared on the altar.</p><p>He felt it more clearly: the upheaval was coming from the other side, meaning the passage was two-way, and he didn't have to worry about not being able to return. Qin Sang pointed, and the ebony sword shot towards the vortex. It split into four beams of sword light, positioning themselves in the four directions, stabilizing the vortex.</p><p>Once the passage was stable, Qin Sang recalled the ebony sword and summoned the Twelve Demon Banners, entering them.</p><p>Darkness enveloped him. Qin Sang knew he had been transported elsewhere, but he found himself still underwater.</p>
