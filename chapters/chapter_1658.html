<h1></h1><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The hissing of the Gu insects within the black light grew increasingly shrill.</p><p>Within the black light, a faint, blood-red hue emerged.</p><p>As the bloody hue intensified, the Gu insects no longer targeted the mountain. Instead, consumed by a ferocious savagery, they turned on their master, hissing and writhing, as if attempting to break free from their restraints and devour him.</p><p>Poison King's brows furrowed deeply.  He probed the black light with two fingers and instantly felt a searing pain. An unnatural crimson flushed his pale face, and a muffled groan escaped his throat.</p><p>Utilizing some unknown secret art, Poison King gradually subdued the Gu insects' ferocity. Their hissing softened.</p><p>He took a deep breath, but his breathing remained ragged, unable to regain its calm.</p><p>Master Huaiyin, who had been observing Poison King's actions, sighed, “What a ferocious Gu!”</p><p>Poison King circulated his mystic power, calming the turbulent blood energy within him. His voice, however, remained slightly unsteady. “It's not entirely its fault. This secret art drastically amplifies the residual savagery within its instincts.”</p><p>“Such an art should be used with caution,” Master Huaiyin warned.</p><p>Inciting a Gu insect's ferocity is simple, but subduing it is far more challenging.  If the same secret art is employed repeatedly within a short period, the hidden dangers will escalate with each use, inevitably reaching a point where control becomes impossible.  Judging by Poison King's struggle to pacify the Gu insect, it was clearly far more difficult than the last time.</p><p>“Thank you for your reminder, Master. I know my limits. If not for the significant risks of this secret art and its inability to be maintained indefinitely, that scoundrel wouldn't have escaped. Fortunately, Heaven has favored us. This time, he won't get away!”</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, Poison King withdrew the Gu insect.  Hands clasped behind his back, he gazed towards the mountain summit, his tone icy.</p><p>They waited before the Jade Gate.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and the others were still occupied.</p><p>The four of them, joining forces, relentlessly assaulted the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>Suspended in the void, with no support above or below, the Jade Pavilion swayed precariously under their attacks.  It appeared as though it might collapse at any moment, yet it proved far more resilient than it seemed.</p><p>Zhu Wudao bore the greatest burden.</p><p>While attacking the Jade Pavilion, he also had to analyze the restrictions and guide the others. The mental strain was immense, yet he persevered, showing no signs of exhaustion.</p><p>This made Old Demon Fan increasingly apprehensive.</p><p>Since reuniting with Zhu Wudao, Old Demon Fan had been silently observing this familiar yet unfamiliar junior brother.  Their seniority within the Heavenly Hao Tower was comparable, their ages not far apart. Since their Qi Refining stage, they had frequently interacted, engaging in subtle power struggles. Zhu Wudao had always been a step behind.</p><p>When he broke through to the late Nascent Soul stage and secured the position of Grand Elder, Old Demon Fan had assumed their rivalry had finally been decided.  Who could have foreseen that Zhu Wudao had been concealing his cultivation all along?</p><p>For years, he had maintained a flawless facade before both him and the Sect Master!</p><p>Such meticulous planning sent chills down Old Demon Fan's spine.</p><p>While attacking the Jade Pavilion, Old Demon Fan pondered Zhu Wudao's intentions.  He felt there was more to it than met the eye, yet Zhu Wudao's reasoning was sound: the opportunity for Deity Transformation was indeed worth the risk.</p><p>Unable to grasp the crux of the matter, Old Demon Fan was lost in thought when Mo Xingdao's warning reached his ears.</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>A crisp cracking sound emanated from the Jade Pavilion. A fissure suddenly appeared on the lintel, extending all the way to the pavilion's second floor.</p><p>Their attacks were finally taking effect!</p><p>But what happened next was something even Zhu Wudao hadn't anticipated.</p><p>The appearance of the first crack seemed to be a signal.  A series of ‘crack’ sounds echoed as countless fissures rapidly spread across the entire Jade Pavilion like a spiderweb.</p><p>“The formation is destabilizing!”</p><p>Su Zinan, sweeping his gaze across the scene, identified the root cause.</p><p>Their assault on the Jade Pavilion was certainly a contributing factor, but the long-term sealing of the Emperor Bestowal Mountain’s grand formation had also caused changes within the formation itself. These accumulated changes, triggered today, were the reason for the Jade Pavilion's rapid destruction.</p><p>This wasn't necessarily a bad thing. They intended to destroy the Jade Pavilion anyway.</p><p>The four cultivators, with comparable cultivation levels and swift reactions, immediately ceased their attack and switched to defense.</p><p>Zhu Wudao donned golden armor, raising the Golden Aspect Token high. Golden light bathed the surroundings.</p><p>Su Zinan raised his hand, unfolding a net of Dragon Sinew Silk around him.</p><p>Mo Xingdao expelled his mystic energy, forming a protective shield.</p><p>Old Demon Fan transformed into a swirling black mist, flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>Just as their defenses were established, the Jade Pavilion, unable to sustain itself any longer, exploded with a thunderous roar.  The violent shockwave, carrying countless fragments, engulfed the four of them.</p><p>In an instant, starting from the Jade Pavilion, the entire jade stairway crumbled, like a shattered illusion, dissolving into the chaotic scene within the sea of mist. Heaven and earth shifted!</p><p>The four cultivators vanished without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>An unknown location.</p><p>A sphere of light floated silently in the darkness.</p><p>Disturbed by the actions of Zhu Wudao and the others, ripples appeared within the sphere. Five-colored divine light pulsed rhythmically, alternating in brilliance.</p><p>As the Jade Pavilion shattered, the sphere of light flared, illuminating the surroundings. Within the heart of the five-colored divine light, the faint image of a five-colored crown materialized, slowly revolving.</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang was soaring through the void.</p><p>He had lost count of how many times he had probed the void.</p><p>His mind linked with the Skyeye Butterfly, Qin Sang devoted all his energy to deciphering the restrictions within the void.  His efforts were fruitful, allowing him to grasp the fundamental principles and gradually delve into the finer details.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>A faint sigh, tinged with fatigue, echoed in the darkness.</p><p>Deciphering the restrictions alone placed a tremendous strain on his mind, but as long as he succeeded, he could reach the other side.</p><p>“I wonder if my avatar has retrieved the Immortal Talisman?”</p><p>This thought flashed through Qin Sang's mind. He was about to push forward and find a path.</p><p>Just then, an unusual tremor rippled through the void.</p><p>Qin Sang frowned. Such tremors had occurred before, but they were always faint. This one was the most violent yet.</p><p>“Is it because I forced my way in?”</p><p>He wondered.</p><p>Despite his prolonged analysis, he could only perceive the space within this particular Jade Pavilion. He couldn't grasp the entirety of the Emperor Bestowal Mountain’s grand formation and was unaware of the tremor's significance.</p><p>Soon, Qin Sang's expression changed.</p><p>The previous tremors had been intermittent, but this one showed no signs of ceasing, and it was intensifying!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang activated the Wishfulfilling Pearl.</p><p>A protective罡 shrouded him, further reinforced by a layer of demonic fire.</p><p>Immediately after taking these precautions, Qin Sang noticed an anomaly in the void. It froze, as if encased in ice, then shattered explosively as the restrictions collapsed!</p><p>In that instant, a kaleidoscope of multicolored light flooded in, banishing the darkness.</p><p>Qin Sang felt as though he had fallen into a kaleidoscope, surrounded by countless shattered mirror fragments. The fragments spun and tumbled, the scenes within them piecing together to resemble the interior of a grand hall.</p><p>This thought barely registered before Qin Sang felt an immense force strike him. His protective罡 buckled under the pressure, and he was swept away by the turbulent flow.</p><p>After a dizzying shift of light and shadow, he was flung outwards.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang! Bang!’</p><p>Qin Sang forcefully stabilized himself, finding he had been transported to an unfamiliar hall.</p><p>…</p><p>Before another Jade Pavilion.</p><p>The two disciples of the Jade Platform Sect, using the Fire Aspect Token, had opened the Jade Pavilion's doors and were about to enter when the white-robed Daoist abruptly stopped, holding back the female Daoist as well.</p><p>The female Daoist, momentarily stunned, noticed the grim expression and heavy gaze of her senior brother.</p><p>She knew her senior brother's temperament well.  He only displayed such an expression when faced with extreme danger.  A tremor of fear ran through her. “Senior Brother, is there something…”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist gestured for her to be silent.  Standing before the entrance, he remained speechless, his gaze fixed on the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>As if having seen something, his expression shifted dramatically.  Crying out in alarm, he grabbed the female Daoist's hand and retreated rapidly.</p><p>The sudden pull nearly caused the female Daoist to stumble.</p><p>Fortunately, their sibling connection allowed for seamless coordination.  The female Daoist instantly employed their sect's signature movement technique, watching as the Jade Pavilion receded further and further away.</p><p>The Jade Pavilion’s doors remained open, the pitch-black doorway seeming to conceal something utterly terrifying.</p><p>Confusion filled the female Daoist.  Then, she saw the Jade Pavilion begin to shake violently.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist, without pausing, retreated along the jade stairway towards the path they had come from, abandoning even the Fire Aspect Token.  He finally remembered to explain, “Someone is trying to destroy the Jade Pavilion!”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>There was clearly no one around the Jade Pavilion!</p><p>The female Daoist paused, then recalled her senior brother’s mention of five such tokens, each corresponding to a Jade Pavilion. There were others on the mountain.</p><p>Having witnessed how her senior brother opened the Jade Pavilion, she understood its incredible resilience.  It was impossible for the two of them to destroy it.</p><p>Even two Grand Cultivators would likely struggle!</p><p>Why would those Grand Cultivators destroy the Jade Pavilion?</p><p>“They didn't go to the Immortal Palace?”</p><p>The female Daoist exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>This was precisely the source of the white-robed Daoist's confusion and apprehension. No matter how valuable the Formless Immortal Sect's treasures were, how could they compare to the opportunities within the Immortal Palace? Why would those Grand Cultivators abandon the primary objective?</p><p>No one could offer them an explanation.</p><p>Before they could retreat much further, a muffled explosion echoed from the depths of the sea of mist.  A surging wave of energy erupted from ahead, originating from the Jade Pavilion they had just fled.  Strangely, the wave didn’t carry a concussive force, but a powerful suction.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The wave washed over them.</p><p>Their figures jerked to a halt as an immense suction force attempted to drag them towards an unknown destination.</p><p>“Careful, Junior Sister! Don't get pulled in! The grand formation is shifting, mountains and terrain are changing, triggering the second transformation! The Five Elements’ locations will all be merged!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist roared, his robes billowing. The Crimson Fire Sword whirled around him, each slash transforming into a ring of sword light, forcefully severing the suction force.</p><p>Hearing his words, the female Daoist finally understood her senior brother's fear. Numerous Grand Cultivators were on the mountain.  If they were dragged into their midst, their situation would become extremely perilous.</p><p>Panic seized the female Daoist. She hastily summoned her natal magic treasure, coordinating with the Crimson Fire Sword to resist the pull.</p><p>Fortunately, the white-robed Daoist had some understanding of the Emperor Bestowal Mountain’s grand formation and had retreated in advance.  The suction force surrounding them was weaker than that near the Jade Pavilion, allowing them to withstand it.</p><p>The suction force felt like invisible shackles.</p><p>They struggled to break free, and after a grueling effort, the suction vanished without warning.  Immediately, the earth quaked violently. Before they could react, a tremendous force hurled them away.</p><p>‘Bang! Bang!’</p><p>They crashed against the mountain wall.</p><p>Thankfully, their high cultivation levels automatically activated their protective罡, sparing them from injury, though they were undeniably disheveled.</p><p>The white-robed Daoist rolled to his feet. He saw a vast expanse of white around them, still within the sea of mist.  Beneath their feet was a wide mountain path, leading upwards.</p><p>The female Daoist, smoothing her robes, approached him. “Senior Brother, where have we been moved to?”</p><p>After confirming there were no others around, the white-robed Daoist relaxed.  He pondered for a moment, comprehending their situation, and his eyes lit up. “We're still within the formation…”</p><p>Although they hadn't been transported directly inside like those Grand Cultivators, their situation wasn't the worst. They had also avoided a major calamity.</p><p>They still held a certain advantage.</p><p>“Let’s ascend!”</p><p>The white-robed Daoist made a swift decision.</p><p>Now understanding the situation, the female Daoist, her fear subsiding, quickly followed.</p><p>…</p><p>With the Jade Pavilion shattered and the formation drastically altered.</p><p>At the mountain gate, both Qin Sang's avatar and Poison King sensed the change, rising abruptly and staring intently into the depths of the Jade Gate.</p><p>The sea of mist churned violently, endless clouds surging upwards, propelled by an unseen force, quickly surpassing the Emperor Bestowal Mountain’s summit.</p><p>The already indistinct summit was completely engulfed by the rising mist.</p><p>The tide of mist showed no signs of stopping, continuing to surge towards the heavens, its momentum seemingly capable of breaching the very boundaries of this secret realm.</p><p>The higher it rose, the thinner the mist became.</p><p>Gradually, a fantastical sight revealed itself within the mist: another divine mountain!</p><p>A new divine mountain had sprouted from the peak of the Emperor Bestowal Mountain.  More accurately, this was the true Emperor Bestowal Mountain, its upper half concealed by the grand formation, now revealing its true form.</p><p>The divine mountain soared for tens of thousands of feet, dwarfing even the tallest peak of the Central Continent.</p><p>A jade path, extraordinarily wide, stretched towards the summit. The jade stairway before them connected directly to this path.</p><p>Poison King and his companion saw Old Demon Fan's secret mark, recognizing this as the Shifting Mountains transformation. It seemed Old Demon Fan hadn't lied to them.  Exchanging a glance, they hesitated no longer and stepped into the Jade Gate.</p><p>Qin Sang's avatar, unsure of the cause, frowned at the sight.</p><p>His main body was inside. He wondered if the changes were related to him.</p><p>Just then, the avatar noticed the grand formation's transformation was far from over. The fluctuations within the misty waves grew increasingly violent, and the jade stairway behind the mountain gate began to collapse.</p><p>If he didn't seize this opportunity to enter, further changes might occur, making entry far more difficult.</p><p>The avatar sensed no immediate danger. After a moment's thought, he stepped into the Jade Gate.</p><p>…</p><p>With the divine mountain revealed.</p><p>This earth-shattering change was visible from any corner of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>East of the Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>The nuns of the Veiled Moon Convent, having just arrived near the Golden Aspect Hall, looked up in astonishment at the divine mountain emerging from within the clouds. Then, they turned to the elderly nun, awaiting her decision.</p><p>Further east.</p><p>The Earth Aspect Hall dwarfed the other four halls.</p><p>Occupying dozens of mountain ranges, even more astonishingly, the Earth Aspect Hall harnessed the earth energy of these ranges, transforming the vast area into a single, unified grand formation.</p><p>At this moment, a figure darted back and forth within the Earth Aspect Hall: Yue Lingtian.</p><p>The changes within the Immortal Palace had created a rift between Yue Lingtian and the Daoist sect, leading him to the Earth Aspect Hall alone.  Partly, he was observing the situation, and partly, he genuinely valued the Earth Aspect inheritance.</p><p>Unexpectedly, despite his cultivation, he encountered obstacles at every turn within the Earth Aspect Hall.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Earth Aspect Hall’s master had been the one who orchestrated the channeling of earth energy and the establishment of the grand formation to seal the ancient demons and quell the demonic tribulation. The complexity of the Earth Aspect Hall’s formation far surpassed the other four halls, and it was also the best preserved after the great battle.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Yue Lingtian stomped heavily, sending waves of earth energy flying in all directions.  A nascent puppet crumbled into dust.</p><p>In the next moment, the surrounding peaks shifted.</p><p>Having pinpointed the location of the Earth Aspect inheritance hall, Yue Lingtian snorted coldly, preparing to break the formation.  His movements halted as he turned his head towards the west, witnessing the emergence of the divine mountain.</p><p>“They've already entered?”</p><p>His pupils constricted as he muttered to himself.  After a moment's hesitation, he decided to secure the Earth Aspect inheritance first.</p><p>At the entrance to the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Outside the stone beach.</p><p>Two groups of Nascent Soul cultivators were locked in a standoff: the Daoist sect and the descendants of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>Having entered the Formless Immortal Sect one after the other, they encountered each other at the stone beach and had already clashed once, with the Formless Immortal Sect descendants slightly disadvantaged.</p><p>At this moment, the divine mountain emerged in the direction of the Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p><p>Seeing this from afar, they lost interest in their confrontation and rushed towards the Emperor Bestowal Mountain.</p>
