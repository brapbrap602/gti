<h1>Chapter 1630: The Remnants of Yunchi</h1><p>Chapter 1630: The Remnants of Yunchi</p><p>On the way to Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>Crying Spirit Cave Master couldn't help but ask, “I remember the palace in the Water Phase Hall is called Bingyi Palace, a place of great significance. It will likely be difficult to enter. What exactly are you seeking, friend?”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man, self-proclaimed successor of the Wood Phase Hall, had already spent considerable time searching for treasures there.  Neither of them understood the Water Phase lineage, making this even more challenging.</p><p>The news of a chance at ascension has motivated the grotesque-faced man to visit the Water Phase Hall first, surely drawn by some alluring treasure.</p><p>“The Wood Phase Hall is intact, but the Water Phase Hall is dilapidated, its protective arrays greatly weakened…”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man briefly described his observations outside Bingyi Palace.  “Cave Master, do you remember the two individuals I encountered years ago?  The companion of Lu Zhang carried an intense wood spirit energy, the purest I've ever witnessed. Unfortunately, my abilities were insufficient back then, and they escaped.  Passing by the Water Phase Hall earlier, I sensed a similar wood spirit aura, equally pure.  There’s likely a rare and precious wood within the palace!”</p><p>“A rare and precious wood, not in the Wood Phase Hall, but in the Water Phase Hall?”</p><p>Crying Spirit Cave Master's tone was peculiar.</p><p>The grotesque-faced man understood the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect better than Crying Spirit Cave Master.  “The five lineages of the Sect are independent, secretly vying with one another. Even if they obtain treasures needed by other lineages, they won't easily part with them.  It's possible it’s been left in the Water Phase Hall.”</p><p>“So that’s it!” Crying Spirit Cave Master suddenly understood, then recalled something, adding a warning, “Friend, be wary that someone might have beaten you to it.”</p><p>“Among those who activated the teleportation array with the old demons, there were only the Cave Master, Crane Gao Daoist, and the one surnamed Mo. Su Zi Nan likely knows little about the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.  He cultivates bloodline techniques, neither water nor wood, so he'll most likely aim for the most tempting Di Shou Mountain. The Water Phase Hall, being so ruined, probably won't interest him…  Are you referring to that Water Phase successor, Cave Master?”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man pondered for a moment, then said, “He could indeed be in the Water Phase Hall! However, this person is secretive and cautious to a fault, not like someone with great power.  Knowing about the existence of the immortal palaces, he didn't compete for the Sword Tomb, unless, like us, he knows of a certain treasure, or perhaps he knows his own limitations and chose to retreat.  We'll take the precious wood and leave; if this person is sensible, there will be no conflict.”</p><p>Crying Spirit Cave Master expressed admiration. “You've already thought it through; I was overly concerned! Friend, are you seeking this precious wood to cultivate the Post Heaven Wooden Man Stele?  Couldn't the Chi Xuan Ancient Tree the old demons provided suffice?”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man offered a strained smile. “This technique uses spiritual wood as a medium; the higher the quality of the wood, the stronger the technique. The Chi Xuan Ancient Tree is acceptable, but it is slightly inferior to the aura I sensed in the Water Phase Hall.”</p><p>Crying Spirit Cave Master echoed with a smile, “I too would like to see what kind of precious wood surpasses the Chi Xuan Ancient Tree of Tian Hao Tower! The Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's reputation is well-deserved, its foundation runs so deep!”</p><p>After the sigh, Crying Spirit Cave Master's smile faded, shaking their head in lament. “I thought the Wood Phase Hall secret arts combined with insights from the Sword Tomb would give us a great chance at ascension! But the immortal palaces are inaccessible, and the materials needed for these secret arts are all unparalleled treasures, not easily obtained, making ascension still unattainable.”</p><p>The grotesque-faced man consoled, “Cave Master, why such dejection! The changes to the immortal palaces are beyond our control. But those secret arts still offer hope, as long as we work together to search after we leave, we may still find what we need!”</p><p>As they spoke,</p><p>The Water Phase Hall came into view.</p><p>However, the most striking sight was the Lang Zhong Tower.</p><p>Jade pavilion reaching the heavens, plucking stars with one hand.</p><p>Upon seeing the jade pavilion, Crying Spirit Cave Master’s gaze was captivated. “That's where the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect keeps its treasured texts and rare artifacts, Lang Zhong Tower!”</p><p>Glancing at Lang Zhong Tower, the grotesque-faced man showed little interest.  “The true inheritances of the five lineages are all kept within their respective palaces! Items for lower-cultivation level disciples, cultivation techniques inaccessible to ordinary people, or obscure, neglected fragments and rare objects, are the things likely to be discarded in Lang Zhong Tower.  Anything worthwhile would not have lasted until now.  After the Di Shou Mountain matter, Cave Master, you can try your luck there. You might find some artifact suited to you.”</p><p>Crying Spirit Cave Master shook their head slightly.</p><p>…</p><p>Lang Zhong Tower</p><p>After separating from his clone, Qin Sang's main body ascended the Questioning Sutra Path, arriving at Lang Zhong Tower.</p><p>The jade pavilion emitted a soft white light.  The exterior lacked intricate carvings or decorations.  Clouds and spiritual light surrounded the pavilion.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, one could see that the light and clouds formed platforms of varying sizes. Qin Sang guessed these were once places for lectures and discussions, now abandoned for countless years.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, Lang Zhong Tower wasn’t heavily guarded. The lower levels were free of restrictions.</p><p>On either side of the Jade Gate entrance stood several jade statues, their original carvings indistinguishable due to severe damage.  Marks of intense cultivator battles were scattered everywhere, extending all the way into the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>During the Great Uprising, foreign invaders exploited the chaos, looting the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect without mercy.  The Lang Zhong Pavilion certainly wasn't spared.</p><p>Qin Sang, though prepared, still felt a pang of regret at the sight. He hoped some things remained intact.</p><p>He looked up towards the top of the Jade Pavilion.  </p><p>Restrictions remained there, indicating, logically, the storage of the most valuable treasures.</p><p>However, Qin Sang decided to enter from the first-floor entrance.</p><p>"It seems I'm the only one here…"</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the Jade Pavilion's levels, sensing no other presence.  The corpses had long since decayed.</p><p>Entering the Lang Zhong Pavilion, Qin Sang, while lacking firsthand experience of the Great Uprising, saw scattered fragments of magical artifacts and scattered jade slips...</p><p>And, floating in the air, were many differently colored orbs.</p><p>He gestured, and a yellow orb flew into his hand.</p><p>*The Scripture of Defensive Talismans*.</p><p>A spell focused on defense, considered excellent for Golden Core cultivators; a high-level teaching in most sects.  For Qin Sang, however, it was merely decent.</p><p>The other orbs were similar, likely looted from the lower levels of the Jade Pavilion.</p><p>Qin Sang surveyed the area, found a staircase, and was about to ascend to the second floor when he paused, noticing something. He looked up at the first floor's ceiling.</p><p>The ceiling, also made of jade, was dulled by the ravages of war.</p><p>Qin Sang discerned the mechanism:  a hidden, albeit damaged, restriction.  It wasn't the Pavilion's main defense, and was not complex.  After a quick scan with his spiritual sense, he identified the problem.  After a moment's thought, he drew several talismans in mid-air and sent them into the ceiling.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The ceiling suddenly glowed, bathing the area in a clear light.  </p><p>The first floor grew brighter, and a vision slowly materialized before Qin Sang – a map of the entire Wu Xiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had already gained a general understanding of the Sect's layout, but the map was a welcome addition, offering a clearer perspective.</p><p>Di Shou Mountain was undoubtedly the Sect's core, with five branches forming a protective circle around it.</p><p>Of course, the map lacked sensitive information.  Expecting to discover the Sect's forbidden areas from it was wishful thinking; otherwise, someone would have already done so.</p><p>The Ice Palace was indeed the Water Branch – he'd chosen correctly.</p><p>"The Fire Branch…"</p><p>Qin Sang looked towards the southern part of Di Shou Mountain.</p><p>Of the five branches, besides the Water Branch, he was most interested in the Fire Branch.</p><p>Located on an island called Fire Rhinoceros Island, it was, according to the map, a floating island.</p><p>Qin Sang memorized its location, intending to visit Fire Rhinoceros Island when opportunity allowed.</p><p>Restoring the ceiling to its original state, Qin Sang ascended to the second floor.</p><p>Although he encountered no obstacles, he found traces of numerous residual restrictions.  He deduced they were designed to limit entry based on cultivator rank.</p><p>Those of insufficient cultivation could only ascend a limited number of floors; reaching a higher level granted access to higher-level texts.  This highlighted the Sect's strict regulations.</p><p>The Lang Zhong Pavilion contained a vast collection of books, truly a monumental library.  The lower levels, in particular, were densely packed with bookshelves filled with various cultivation techniques and secret arts, encompassing much more than just cultivation.</p><p>It covered a hundred arts of cultivation, leaving no stone unturned.  </p><p>Qin Sang had never seen anything like it, wondering if the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had once scoured the entire Middle State cultivation world.</p><p>As he ascended, the bookshelves grew sparser.</p><p>Each floor offered a view of the scenery outside the Jade Pavilion; unfortunately, the beauty of this blessed land was obscured by dense arrays of restriction lights.</p><p>The marks of battle were everywhere, countless texts and treasures looted, the vast majority of shelves empty.</p><p>Having little time, he quickly scanned the shelves with his spiritual sense, collecting only what interested him.</p><p>His speed increased, nearing the halfway point.  After a while, not far from the top floor, he reached the Golden Core late-stage level.</p><p>"As expected, the upper levels should contain Yuan Ying-level texts."</p><p>Qin Sang looked upwards.</p><p>The restrictive power remained here, and a clear light shimmered on the jade steps. Qin Sang sensed a threat, but this level of restriction posed no challenge.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The Golden Sinking Sword leaped out, hanging suspended above. Qin Sang stepped onto the jade steps.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The clear light above instantly surged towards Qin Sang, forming immense pressure, enough to repel a Yuan Ying early-stage cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang remained unmoved.</p><p>Jin Chen's sword trembled slightly, then sliced out three beams of light.</p><p>*Swish! Swish! Swish!*</p><p>The sword light pierced through the ethereal glow, causing immediate confusion and significantly reducing resistance.  Simultaneously, white beams of light, like white strings, erupted from the jade steps, slicing through the air towards Qin Sang.  He deflected and severed each one with his Jin Chen sword.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't falter, reaching the top of the jade steps.  Upon seeing the next level, he let out a surprised "Hah!"</p><p>His tone held a hint of annoyance.  The texts on this level had been completely emptied – not a single volume left!  The signs of battle were minimal, but it was clear a major conflict between Yuan Ying cultivators had taken place, a key area fiercely contested by top experts.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sense of foreboding.  He attempted to ascend further, only to discover that the stairs had vanished.</p><p>Qin Sang looked around, thoughtfully, quickly locating his target.  With a slight shift in his thoughts, he reversed his Jin Chen sword, pointing the tip upwards towards the center of the ceiling.</p><p>A strange sight unfolded. Without a sound of impact, the Jin Chen sword disappeared into the ceiling.  The ceiling itself then dramatically transformed, spinning rapidly.  The jade light shattered, transforming into countless stars, revealing a starry passage.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his celestial eye, observing for a moment before leaping into the passage after his sword.  Unfamiliar with the mechanisms of this place, he could only force his way through.  Perhaps due to previous damage, the resistance was less than expected. The Jin Chen sword proved sufficient; when necessary, he could summon a sword formation to stabilize the void.</p><p>He didn't even need to use his demonic fire. Qin Sang smoothly traversed the passage, arriving at a higher level, instantly greeted by a breathtaking sight.</p><p>He saw boundless clouds and seas outside the jade pavilion, a mesmerizing, fantastical panorama. The area below, although connected to the main structure, was concealed by a restriction and invisible.  It was, without a doubt, a celestial pavilion amongst the clouds!</p><p>"Di Shou Mountain!"</p><p>From within the pavilion, the view became clearer.  Closest was the Water Phase Hall, followed by Di Shou Mountain. The jade pavilion, though towering, was less than half the height of Di Shou Mountain; the imposing grandeur of the colossal mountain was overwhelming.  One could only imagine the splendor of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect during its heyday!</p><p>He didn't linger on the external view for long. The pavilion's interior layout caught his eye – a bizarre structure with a hollow center and surrounding corridors.  In the middle was a cloud pool, the mist flowing like water.</p><p>Qin Sang sensed something unusual and investigated further.  He discovered a remarkable secret! Within the cloud pool were numerous white orbs hidden in the mist, each seeming to contain something.</p><p>Activating his celestial eye, he saw the contents of the orbs, a shocking revelation.  Some contained broken swords, knives, chipped jade bracelets, and the handles of ancient iron whips – in short, fragments of ancient treasures.  These ruined treasures, their power depleted, were preserved in the pool due to their unique materials.</p><p>Others were spherical jade cages, uniformly crafted, with shifting runes on their surface, appearing to seal the treasures within. Some orbs were empty, the treasures already removed, likely plundered by enemies.</p><p>This was clearly not a library, but a treasure pool!</p><p>Qin Sang wondered where the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had obtained these items.  Judging by the exposed fragments, they seemed to be of uncertain value and origin; fearing to miss out on anything valuable, the sect had simply tossed them all in. Even the Heavenly Eye Butterfly couldn't discern their relative worth, and the Fire Jade Centipede remained unresponsive.</p><p>Qin Sang casually chose a jade cage, forming a sword beam to retrieve it.  The moment the beam emerged, the cloud pool churned violently, suddenly launching a bolt of cloud lightning towards his face.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The cloud lightning wasn't particularly powerful, yet Qin Sang's expression changed drastically. He moved several meters instantly with a flap of his phoenix wings, avoiding the strike.</p><p>Meanwhile, the sound of metal clashing echoed from the pool. The Jin Chen sword flew back, repelled by a restriction.  Then, the cloud pool vanished, the treasures disappearing into thin air.</p><p>Qin Sang dropped his relaxed demeanor, realizing retrieving treasures from the cloud pool wasn't easy; forceful attempts were fruitless, and these were all treasures of uncertain use.  Cultivation techniques were more important. He'd proceed to the upper level and return later.</p><p>He noticed the jade steps reappearing in a corner of the corridor, leading to the very top of the jade pavilion – the only unexplored area.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly bypassed the corridor and approached the steps. The cloud pool gradually calmed, returning to normal, with white orbs floating aimlessly.  As Qin Sang inadvertently glanced at a jade cage, a strange feeling of familiarity stirred within him.</p><p>Faint but undeniable.</p><p>Qin Sang paused in surprise, focusing inward to trace the source of the feeling.  After some time, he realized it originated from the almost forgotten  《Yin Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Arts》, a fragmentary cultivation technique he had obtained at the Lan Dou Gate in the Cang Lang Sea!</p>
