<h1>Chapter 877: The Cloud Bridge</h1><p>Two figures darted towards the rocky beach.</p><p>The people on the beach were startled and looked over, some with hostility in their eyes.</p><p>Approaching them, the man in a green robe, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, opened them and sized them up. He spoke, "Are you here to participate in our Yanmiao Pavilion's disciple recruitment ceremony?"</p><p>"Yes, yes..."</p><p>Fang Ting nodded repeatedly, looking innocent and carefree.</p><p>Huasheng, as if hypnotizing himself, silently muttered, "I am Zhang Yue," then said firmly, "Disciple Zhang Yue, has long admired the immortal path and Yanmiao Pavilion. I implore you, senior, to accept me."</p><p>"The disciple recruitment ceremony hasn't begun yet. Whether you're selected or not isn't something I decide."</p><p>The man in green robes, discerning Huasheng's cultivation, spoke without harshness. Then, a kind smile suddenly appeared on his face, and he softly said, "Find a place to rest.  You'll know in two days."</p><p>Huasheng, seeing the man's smile, thought he was mistaken. When had these renowned disciples become so approachable? Upon closer inspection, he realized the man was smiling at Fang Ting.</p><p>The two found separate rocks to sit on.</p><p>The others glanced at them before resuming their meditation, conserving their energy.</p><p>Huasheng immediately noticed the abundant spiritual energy on the beach, far richer than elsewhere – a prime cultivation spot. He whispered a few words to Fang Ting, then calmed his mind, awaiting the ceremony.</p><p>Meanwhile, Qin Sang's true form appeared nearby, hidden in a secluded spot, secretly providing protection.</p><p>Two days passed in a flash.</p><p>More people arrived, gradually filling the beach.</p><p>Among them were innocent-looking youths, seasoned cultivators with barely concealed killing intent, and some unruly individuals.</p><p>With a Foundation Establishment cultivator from Yanmiao Pavilion watching, no one dared to cause trouble, maintaining the beach's calm.</p><p>Just after the third day's Yin hour, while the mountains were still shrouded in darkness, the man in green robes suddenly opened his eyes and said gravely, "The time has come. The disciple recruitment ceremony begins now. Those who wish to join Yanmiao Pavilion, follow me."</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he stood up, summoned a white bamboo pole, stepped onto it, and flew along the lakeshore.</p><p>A stir erupted among the crowd, who quickly rose and followed.</p><p>Each used different methods – some with magical artifacts, others with escape techniques. For a moment, colorful escaping lights illuminated the lake, a beautiful sight.</p><p>Huasheng flicked his finger, releasing his bamboo leaf artifact. Fang Ting also summoned her sword light, and both quickly set off.</p><p>The man in green robes slowed his pace, leading them around several mountains, finally arriving at a man-made dock overlooking a large island in the lake.  Several boats were moored there, and behind it lay a mist-shrouded valley of considerable size.</p><p>Following the man to the dock, curiosity filled the onlookers.</p><p>Huasheng's gaze swept across the scene, finally resting on the misty valley.</p><p>The mist obscured their vision, but not the Sky-Eye Butterfly. Deep within the valley was a mortal town, a place resembling a hidden paradise.</p><p>At that moment, three figures flew out from the mortal town, emerging from the mist. One of them laughed loudly, "Brother Mu has brought everyone here."</p><p>"Reporting to the three senior brothers, these are all the cultivators participating in this disciple recruitment ceremony,"</p><p>the man in green robes bowed.</p><p>From the trio, a calm-looking middle-aged cultivator stepped forward, his gaze sweeping over the assembled cultivators before a satisfied expression appeared on his face. He nodded and said, "Indeed, we have more applicants this year than in previous years. We should be able to complete the Pavilion Master's task. Brother Mu, protect them. We three will set up the Cloud Bridge..."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the man in green robes waved, sending out a green light that transformed into a screen, shielding the cultivators.</p><p>At this point, a commotion arose among the loose cultivators.</p><p>"What is a Cloud Bridge? I heard that Yanmiao Pavilion's recruitment was always three minor trials. I've never heard of a Cloud Bridge trial!"</p><p>A cultivator exclaimed in surprise and confusion.</p><p>Another cultivator echoed, "Yes! I participated in the last ceremony; it was the three minor trials. How could it change so suddenly?"</p><p>A thin cultivator with a sallow complexion showed despair and looked dazed, as if his life force had been drained.</p><p>The dock buzzed with chatter.</p><p>"Silence!"</p><p>A sword cultivator beside the middle-aged cultivator suddenly roared, coldly saying, "When did we say that trials must remain unchanged? The purpose of the trials is to test your performance. If you resort to tricks, even if you pass, you won't enter Yanmiao Pavilion. Now you may leave."</p><p>Reprimanded, the crowd quieted down, not daring to speak anymore.</p><p>The three Yanmiao Pavilion disciples produced three identical bronze mirrors.</p><p>The mirrors flew high, assembling above the dock. After a slight tremor, they emitted a white light, shooting straight towards the island in the lake.  Despite the distance, the light instantly reached and connected with the island.</p><p>Then, the mist on the lake island churned, spreading towards them along the white light.</p><p>Gradually, a cloud bridge, connecting the two shores and hovering above the lake, appeared.  Made entirely of mist, it was only about ten feet wide, ethereal and incredibly light.</p><p>Everyone worried about whether it would simply fall apart beneath their feet.</p><p>The bridge appeared; the white light vanished.</p><p>The bronze mirror returned to their hands.  Before they could speak, a figure flew from the lake island.  With a few quick movements, a young man with sharp eyebrows and piercing eyes, dressed in flowing white robes, stood before them.</p><p>The four cultivators from the Yanmiao Pavilion looked serious and immediately bowed.  "Disciple greets Master Chen!"</p><p>Those on the shore were stunned.  Such a young man was a Golden Core cultivator!  They bowed as well, awestruck.</p><p>Huasheng lowered his head.  At Master Chen's appearance, he immediately ordered the Sky Eye Butterfly to cease its abilities and fall asleep, avoiding detection.</p><p>With the Sky Eye Butterfly completely hidden, Huasheng relaxed, then noticed something unusual about Fang Ting beside him. She was staring intently at the Yanmiao Pavilion Golden Core cultivator, her face a mixture of surprise and delight.</p><p>Huasheng noted this.</p><p>Master Chen raised a hand slightly and said calmly, "Rise. Among you, are there any with a single spirit root, double spirit root, or those possessing special constitutions beneficial to cultivation? Step forward. You may bypass the cloud bridge and enter directly."</p><p>Actually, cultivators with triple spirit roots generally had a good chance of being accepted. Even if they failed the test, few were rejected.</p><p>However, they were clearly less favored than those with single or double spirit roots.</p><p>By the looks of it, being directly accepted as a direct disciple by a Golden Core cultivator wasn't impossible.</p><p>Some special spiritual bodies were rarer than single spirit roots. These bodies could be beneficial, detrimental, or have no effect on cultivation.</p><p>Huasheng keenly observed that Master Chen's gaze fell upon Fang Ting beside him as he spoke, a smile in his eyes.</p>
