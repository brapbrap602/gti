<h1>Chapter 2066: The Chaos Devil Stick Technique</h1><p>Yuan Miao respectfully asked, "May I inquire about your name, friend?"</p><p>"My surname is Qin."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed.</p><p>"So it's Daoist Qin," Yuan Miao nodded, pointing towards the horizon.  "This is not a place for battle. Please, follow me."</p><p>With that, Yuan Miao soared into the air, his figure like a shooting star, and Qin Sang and the others followed in his wake.</p><p>One of the Zhuyan masters, who had previously clashed with Ji Hong, couldn't contain himself. He scratched his head, mumbled something about "you all stay here," and then hastily chased after them.</p><p>High-level duels held unparalleled fascination for every Zhuyan. The remaining members were anxiously wringing their hands, thankfully retaining enough sense to understand their duties.</p><p>Yuan Miao led the group beyond the heavens.</p><p>Midway, Si Lu had a thought and sent a voice transmission: "This is just a duel between two individuals; let's not disturb the other Daoists."</p><p>If news of this battle leaked out, it would undoubtedly cause a huge uproar amongst the Zhuyan, resulting in a far greater spectacle than they desired.</p><p>Yuan Miao grunted, somewhat reluctantly. The Zhuyan were a battle-loving race, skilled at gleaning experience through combat. Observing a duel between masters would be a rare opportunity for the younger generation.</p><p>Even if Yuan Miao lost in front of the entire tribe, he wouldn't feel ashamed; it would simply mean he was outmatched.  He could just train harder and challenge them again later!</p><p>However, since their guest had made this request, he couldn't refuse without causing offense. He used his magic to conceal their energy fluctuations.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others flew across the sky, the landscape speeding by beneath them.</p><p>The teleportation array was located here, certainly a crucial place for the Zhuyan. Surprisingly, the Zhuyan hadn't built a magnificent celestial city like other unusual races.</p><p>The surroundings were untouched nature; countless strangely shaped peaks stood on the land, rivers flowed ceaselessly, and forests flourished.</p><p>The Zhuyan people lived amongst the mountains and wilds. Occasionally, figures could be seen emerging from beneath the trees, while others leaped and swung between branches and vines, using them as paths.</p><p>Even the Zhuyan commoners were strong and agile, capable of overpowering tigers and leopards.  But they weren't savage beasts; they also built exquisite dwellings and were no less intelligent than humans.  Their nature was simply closer to that of nature, their lives completely integrated with it.</p><p>Beyond the Zhuyan, Qin Sang also saw other unusual races.</p><p>Seeing other noble races amongst the Zhuyan was normal, but Qin Sang noticed an unusually large number of a particular race; he saw almost as many of them as Zhuyan.</p><p>These people had long limbs and slender fingers, fair skin, and rather unique features—bushy facial hair and two markings under their eyes, giving them a perpetually smiling appearance. Their speech was soft and gentle.</p><p>Compared to the Zhuyan, with their wide eyes and ever-ready fighting spirit, they were noticeably more amicable.</p><p>He couldn't help but wonder who they were and how the Zhuyan could tolerate so many in their territory.</p><p>"Those are the Youyao," Ji Hong sent a voice transmission. "While not a top race, they are said to be quite powerful, even rumored to be equals to the Zhuyan, though their roles differ.  They jointly rule over the other noble races.  Of course, outsiders can't know the full truth. The Zhuyan are always the leaders, and the Youyao are not likely to challenge that."</p><p>Qin Sang acknowledged this information, noting it for later.  The Youyao's high status meant he would undoubtedly need to deal with them when establishing his dojo here.</p><p>As they spoke, Yuan Miao slowed down ahead and led them towards a striking peak.</p><p>The peak was almost sheer cliff on all four sides. The summit had a flat, square stone platform—a perfect arena for combat.</p><p>Such platforms were common here; almost every mountaintop had been leveled to create large and small arenas. As they flew, they saw many battles in progress, both between cultivators and commoners, with numerous spectators and cheering crowds.</p><p>The Zhuyan's reputation for bellicosity was truly well-deserved!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>Yuan Miao landed, activating a jade talisman. He tapped his foot, causing the platform to gently tremble. Crimson light erupted from all sides, forming a curtain of light. Within the curtain, threads of light intertwined to create a smooth net covering the entire platform.</p><p>Simultaneously, flowing lights also moved across the net, obscuring the scene, making it impossible to see what was happening from the outside.</p><p>Yuan Miao turned to Qin Sang, explaining,  "Daoist Qin, don't worry. This array is only to prevent the aftershocks from causing damage; it won't affect our duel.  Our tribal battles have no such rules; if you feel you can't win, just shout your surrender.  Otherwise, don't blame anyone if you get killed or crippled."</p><p>Furthermore, since this is a duel, not a death match, stepping off the platform constitutes a loss. However, if Daoist Qin deliberately avoids the fight, it's not what I wish to see!”</p><p>He paused.  Yuan Miao's fighting spirit suddenly erupted, overwhelming and fierce.  “I hope Daoist Qin will show your true skill and not hold back!”</p><p>Qin Sang didn't answer, but his own aura erupted simultaneously. The two powerful presences clashed like two dragons in the sky, causing the heavens to darken, sand and stones to fly, and the void to rumble with the sound of thunder.</p><p>The protective array here was evidently extremely strong.  Despite the violent impact, the light net and the ground remained unmoved.</p><p>Si Lu and the others moved to a nearby viewing platform.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Yuan Miao, whose eyes were bloodshot and his expression ferocious. He felt like a ferocious beast, yet the man's rationality remained unaffected, making him even more formidable.</p><p>A purple light flashed from Yuan Miao's right hand as he gripped a purple-gold staff.</p><p>Qin Sang had already noticed that Zhu Yan people, whether commoners or cultivators, favored using staffs, clubs, and heavy blades, with staffs being the most common.  He guessed it was because such weapons allowed them to fully unleash their strength.</p><p>The staff struck the ground with a resounding *dong*, a purple-gold halo rippling outwards. Yuan Miao's body instantly seemed cast from gold and iron.</p><p>Sensing Yuan Miao's growing power, Qin Sang exhaled softly, summoned his spirit tablet, and gripped it tightly.</p><p>At the same time, he silently chanted incantations, activating the *Tian Yao Lian Xing* technique to summon his Dharma Image, feeling an irresistible surge of power coursing through his blood and bones, filling him with boundless strength.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Ming Shan armor manifested on his body. Having been further refined, it now possessed the power of a spiritual treasure.</p><p>Yuan Miao narrowed his eyes.  A seasoned warrior, he keenly sensed the change in Qin Sang, feeling a sense of being overwhelmed. But the stronger his opponent, the more it ignited his fighting spirit. With a low growl, he tightened his grip on his staff.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>In that instant, Qin Sang's vision seemed to contain only a streak of purple-gold light, a staff shadow rapidly enlarging before his eyes.</p><p>The first strike was merely a probe, but its power was undeniable. Qin Sang's eyes flashed, he remained motionless, his arm lifting slightly.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A strange stillness fell upon the arena. Qin Sang stood firm, feet slightly apart, holding the spirit tablet. Yuan Miao hovered above him, his two hands gripping the purple-gold staff, striking down at the tablet.</p><p>?????55.?????</p><p>The first strike seemed evenly matched.</p><p>Almost as soon as Yuan Miao appeared, before his figure had even dissipated, another Yuan Miao materialized behind Qin Sang, his purple-gold staff smashing down towards the back of his head.</p><p>Qin Sang remained calm, again using the spirit tablet to deflect the blow.</p><p>The arena resounded with continuous booming sounds. Qin Sang's legs seemed rooted to the ground, never moving, while countless Yuan Miaos flashed above him, dozens, hundreds, their figures overlapping and shimmering.</p><p>Qin Sang appeared to be simultaneously attacked by numerous Yuan Miaos. His spirit tablet danced in his hands like a butterfly, flawlessly parrying every blow.</p><p>Qin Sang rarely encountered such close-quarters combat, as his Dharma Body cultivation was superior, his strength usually used to support or confuse his opponents.</p><p>However, thanks to his past cultivation of the Great Vajra Wheel Seal, granting him near-instinctive acute perception, his combat skills were by no means lacking. His defense was impenetrable, leaving Yuan Miao unable to find an opening.</p><p>Despite this, Qin Sang's purely defensive stance made him seem to be at a disadvantage. Yuan Miao's offensive was relentless, like a tempest that threatened to engulf him at any moment.</p><p>Several onlookers grew anxious, but Si Lu remained calm, full of confidence in Qin Sang.</p><p>After a prolonged assault, Yuan Miao suddenly shouted, “Daoist, why not use your true abilities?”</p><p>The next moment, the illusory figures shattered, leaving only one staff shadow in the heavens – the actual purple-gold staff.</p><p>This strike seemed to incorporate the power of countless Yuan Miaos, continuously accumulating until reaching its peak, finally exploding with full force!</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>Qin Sang felt a sharp pain at the top of his head, a warning sign in his heart, aware of the strike's devastating power.  He immediately shifted his thoughts, no longer hesitating, truly activating the Great Vajra Wheel Seal.  In an instant, his body, inside and out, became crystal clear, manifesting his Vajra Glass Body.</p><p>A beam of green light shot towards the heavens, actively colliding with the purple-gold staff, fearlessly!</p><p>The next moment, a violent wave of green and purple energy exploded, a tremendous power surging towards the sky, threatening to tear it open, only stopped by the protective light net.</p><p>Within the wave of energy, Qin Sang and Yuan Miao simultaneously flew back.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the ground, regaining his footing. He looked up to see Yuan Miao, whose purple-gold staff had carved a noticeable white mark on the ground as he too steadied himself.</p><p>"Impressive strength!"</p><p>Yuan Miao's eyes gleamed as he roared triumphantly to the heavens.  </p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. Yuan Miao's skin was becoming increasingly red, as if blood was seeping from within.  A bloody glow emanated from his body, like blood flames burning on his skin.</p><p>The moment the blood flames appeared, Yuan Miao's power surged again. The sight made one suspect he was burning his life essence to gain strength.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled what Ji Hong had mentioned earlier, about the Zhuyan people's power residing in their abundant, potent blood.  This wasn't Yuan Miao burning his life essence; rather, he was employing his innate abilities, finding his ordinary attacks ineffective.</p><p>In common understanding, it could be seen as him burning his life force, but not only was he not weakening, he was growing stronger in the fight.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang felt a surge of red engulf his vision, sensing a power even more formidable than before.  Remaining calm, he channeled even the minutest of his strength using the Vajra Wheel Seal, focusing it into a single point, and slammed his spirit tablet.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The arena's formations trembled, the ground shaking slightly.</p><p>The two instantly clashed, locked in a fierce entanglement. Spectators couldn't distinguish Qin Sang and Yuan Miao; they were a blur.</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhuyan warrior stared wide-eyed, seeing only a chaotic mass of light, moving back and forth across the arena. Occasional glimpses of blurred figures appeared, uncertain whether they were the fighters themselves or mere afterimages.</p><p>Attempting to enhance their vision, they soon felt dizzy and disoriented. Only Si Lu could still make out the fighters' movements, marveling at their skill, especially Qin Sang's ability to match the Zhuyan warrior blow for blow, as a human.</p><p>As Ji Hong and his companion were reeling from the spectacle, two figures suddenly separated. A roar followed.</p><p>"Take this, my Chaotic Demon Staff Technique!"</p><p>Ji Hong and the Zhuyan warrior's eyes widened. A crimson staff hurtled towards Qin Sang.  The force was terrifying, enough to pierce the heavens; even from the arena, their hearts pounded as if they were about to be pulverized.</p><p>It was unimaginable, the terrifying pressure faced by Qin Sang confronting that crimson staff directly.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression grew grave. He wouldn't be defeated by one blow, but he sensed the incredible skill behind the technique; even if he survived this attack, a more ferocious onslaught would undoubtedly follow.  Once the opponent unleashed their full attack, he would only be able to defend, with no respite.</p><p>Yuan Miao seemed to be in a trance-like state, his eyes focused only on his opponent, oblivious to everything else, willing to exchange blows even at the cost of injury.</p><p>A head-on clash wasn't what Qin Sang wanted. Even if he won, it would likely damage his Ming Mountain Armor, and he might also be injured.  Yuan Miao didn't care, but he certainly didn't want to get injured unnecessarily.</p><p>"Truly a madman,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, instantly blocking the crimson staff. As expected, another blow followed swiftly.</p><p>His figure disappeared amidst the flurry of attacks. He didn't rush, waiting for his moment. A bright green light erupted from his back, accompanied by a flash of lightning, revealing a pair of phoenix wings.</p><p>He channeled the Azure Luan True Lightning into his wings. A flash of lightning, and he appeared at the edge of the arena.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>The crimson staff smashed into an afterimage, missing its target.</p><p>Yuan Miao was stunned. He'd never seen anything like it. Once he used the Chaotic Demon Staff Technique and gained momentum, opponents could only defend.  Yet, Qin Sang had escaped the technique’s confines using only speed.  He had encountered various opponents and seen various strategies, but escaping the demon staff directly was unprecedented.</p><p>His gaze fell upon Qin Sang's wings, noticing they weren't artifacts or magical abilities, but real wings.</p><p>"A feathered race?"</p><p>The thought occurred to Yuan Miao. He recalled the feathered races and various imperial clans, none possessed such wings.  However, he'd heard that the feathered races often interbred without restriction, making anything possible.</p><p>The fight wasn’t over. Yuan Miao quickly dismissed these thoughts. Though his opponent's speed was astonishing, he was not defenseless.</p><p>After all, this was an arena!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Qin Sang smiled, "My turn to attack!"</p>
