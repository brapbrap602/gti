<h1>Chapter 852: Pursuit</h1><p>Chapter 852: Pursuit</p><p>Qin Sang watched the two-headed beast disappear, then abruptly stopped, turning to face his rapidly approaching opponents with a cold stare.  He was still full of questions, puzzled by their unusual interest in Su Nu.</p><p>He wasn't unfamiliar with demonic cultivators; his first master after entering the immortal path was a member of a demonic sect.  Contemporary demonic cultivators didn't place much value on True Devil Qi.  Aside from its rarity, even if found, it was impossible to absorb or utilize this power; it would likely backfire and endanger one's life.</p><p>Therefore, the two individuals’ unusual attitude towards the True Devil Qi and Su Nu made Qin Sang suspicious.  The connection between the two large merchant alliances and the True Devil Qi seemed far closer than he had imagined.  What secrets were hidden within?</p><p>Furthermore, during their escape from the demon island, Su Nu had been docile and obedient, not at all the spoiled brat he'd expected. Yet, she couldn't even tolerate a few offending glances, which also raised his suspicions. Was this her true personality, or was it intentional?  If intentional, her motives and her relationship with Yue Xiangu became intriguing indeed.</p><p>Of course, these were merely Qin Sang's suspicions.  He hadn't known Su Nu long, barely exchanging a few words with her. He didn't understand her temperament; perhaps she was spoiled by Yue Xiangu's overprotection.</p><p>Qin Sang's mission was to ensure Su Nu's safety. He couldn't abandon her, and he didn't want to get entangled in affairs unrelated to him. So, such thoughts only briefly crossed his mind, and he didn't delve deeper.</p><p>"I have no intention of being enemies with the three of you. Why are you so aggressive?" Qin Sang stood in their path, loudly questioning them.</p><p>"We merely wish to exchange cultivation insights with the young lady," the bearded man pleaded,  "but you are acting like a startled bird, misunderstanding our intentions! The demon sea is now a realm of demonic beasts. If cultivators don't cooperate, how long can we survive?"</p><p>However, his eyes held a hidden murderous intent. Especially upon seeing the two-headed beast, he quickly transmitted a message to the fat merchant: "Junior brother, this person even has a妖丹期 spirit beast. No wonder he can come and go freely in the demon sea. This person is not simple. Killing him won't be easy, and we might pay a heavy price. Let's let him off for now; our priority is capturing that girl, alive…"</p><p>The three exchanged messages and quickly formulated a plan. The bearded man took out a talisman, secretly activating it as his true form vanished into thin air. Simultaneously, the talisman transformed into an illusion of the bearded man, realistic enough to deceive. The other two maintained their composure, guarding the illusion, and aggressively attacked Qin Sang.</p><p>The bearded man's true form, however, infiltrated the shadows, stealthily changing direction to bypass Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, ever vigilant, had already awakened his Heaven's Eye Butterfly, activating its Heaven's Eye to scan his surroundings.  He easily saw through the bearded man's illusion and found his true form.  Without showing his hand, he proactively engaged, feigning ignorance.</p><p>As he approached the bearded man's true form, his sword light suddenly changed direction.</p><p>In an instant, countless sword beams descended like an inverted Milky Way, accompanied by thunderous roars, captivating the heart. It was as if a sword forest shot forth from Qin Sang's hand, directly engulfing the bearded man in the shadows!</p><p>The bearded man was startled, stunned by the astonishing swordsmanship. He couldn't maintain his concealment and hastily activated his innate treasure. A crystal square seal shot out from his dantian, shining with silver light; the runes on top transformed into a silvery "鎮" (zhèn – suppress).</p><p>The sword beams collided with the seal.  The large "鎮" character flew out from the seal, rapidly spinning; the sword beams along its path dissipated.  Simultaneously, the character began to fade; the silver light on the seal fluctuated, bearing immense pressure.</p><p>"Such powerful swordsmanship!" The bearded man, forced out of hiding, looked serious, staring at Qin Sang. "I truly misjudged you. Your strength is rare even among the three major merchant alliances, yet I've never heard of you."</p><p>"I am merely a humble cultivator, insignificant," Qin Sang replied, but he showed no mercy.  His ebony sword moved with supernatural speed, utilizing the sword techniques honed from his comprehension of the Way of the Sword. He forcefully shattered the silver character.</p><p>The sword beams, like a waterfall, were unstoppable. But before the ebony sword could approach, the seal flew back, reforming the silver character.  The bearded man, holding his treasure, retreated rapidly.</p><p>At this moment, the other two arrived. Seeing the situation, they immediately attacked, not assisting the bearded man in defending against the spirit sword but instead activating their own treasures to target Qin Sang, attacking his life force.</p><p>Swords and spears converged.  Qin Sang silently thought, "No chance."</p><p>While pretending to be unaware and planning an ambush, he had secretly prepared his Blood-Soiled Divine Light and Star Conch, waiting for the bearded man to reveal a flaw; then, he would kill him first. Dealing with the other two would then be easy.</p><p>The bearded cultivator, a late-stage Golden Core expert, was ambushed. Though caught off guard, he maintained his composure.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't found a suitable opportunity to intervene until the other two arrived. Facing three powerful opponents, she abandoned the idea of killing them outright and opted for a strategic retreat.</p><p>As their magic weapons approached, Qin Sang moved swiftly, deploying her magic banner to create a defensive formation.  She channeled a wisp of Netherfire into her palm and countered their attack.</p><p>Qin Sang knew she couldn't sustain a three-on-one fight indefinitely. Once the bearded cultivator recovered and they formed a battle formation, they would overwhelm her.  Furthermore, her spiritual energy was depleting rapidly; the pills she had consumed were insufficient.</p><p>After a brief engagement, Qin Sang feigned a weakness.</p><p>The bearded cultivator, eager to capture her, instructed his companions to restrain Qin Sang while he pursued the two-headed…beast.</p><p>Ignoring this, Qin Sang recalled her ebony sword.  Seizing the moment, she unleashed a blood-tainted light, striking the rich merchant's magic weapon directly.</p><p>"Senior brother, save me!"</p><p>With the ebony sword and Netherfire converging, the rich merchant, having lost his magic weapon, was defenseless and terrified.</p><p>The Liu cultivator rushed to his aid, but could only deflect the Netherfire.</p><p>Seeing this, the bearded cultivator's eyes widened in fury. He turned to rescue his junior, but the sword aura had already engulfed the rich merchant.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>A silver amulet shattered the sword energy.</p><p>Qin Sang sheathed her sword, gazing at the blood-soaked rich merchant with a hint of regret.  Somehow, the man had managed to survive, though severely wounded, rendering him combat-ineffective for a time.</p><p>The blood-tainted light, originating from one of the Ten Great Divine Trees, had once again secured victory for Qin Sang.</p><p>The bearded cultivator was stunned, cradling his severely injured junior, his disbelief palpable. He assumed that even if his companions couldn't defeat her, they could at least hold her off. Instead, they were routed so swiftly, so completely!  What kind of magic was that blood-light?</p><p>"Try to interfere again, and this will be your fate!"</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, gesturing towards the rich merchant before flying away.</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p>The bearded cultivator, consumed by rage but remaining calm, stated,  "That demonic cultivator is merely a mid-stage Golden Core, yet fought three of us, deployed multiple magic weapons, and must be severely depleted of spiritual energy!  She's bluffing; don't be deceived!"</p><p>He instructed his junior to refine the sword energy within his body and, along with the Liu cultivator, pursued Qin Sang.</p>
