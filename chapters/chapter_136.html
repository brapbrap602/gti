<h1>Chapter 129: Dan Long Ginseng</h1><p>Chapter 129: Dan Long Ginseng</p><p>As Qin Sang's cultivation advanced, his understanding of the Xuan Pin Jade Cauldron Scripture deepened.</p><p>Cultivating this technique inherently carries great risk, and the consequences of being harvested likely aren't as easily dismissed as the sect master said, merely a problem of sentimental attachment.</p><p>After being harvested, even if a soul imprint wasn't planted, emotional roots will take root and be inescapable. In the future, whether it be breaking through bottlenecks or normal cultivation, it will be affected by emotional attachments.</p><p>This influence is subtle yet constant, extremely frightening.</p><p>Just before breaking through, it will transform into a heart demon and suddenly spring forth, disrupting one's state of mind. All effort will be wasted unless one possesses great willpower. It's hard to make progress again after that.</p><p>...</p><p>"Disciple greets the sect master."</p><p>The cave abode opened wide. Sect Master Gu entered and Qin Sang stood and bowed.</p><p>He had condensed the jade cauldron and was about to complete the third level of the Xuan Pin Jade Cauldron Scripture, so he immediately sent out a sound transmission talisman. It had already been half a year since he arrived at Mount Shaohua.</p><p>He didn't know the others' progress, but Qin Sang was certain that no one could be faster than him.</p><p>Upon hearing Qin Sang say that he'd already condensed the jade cauldron, Sect Master Gu's expression sank and his tone grew solemn. "This old man warned you long ago. Cultivating the Xuan Pin Jade Cauldron Scripture mustn't be rushed. Do you know that a month ago, He Mu's state of mind was destroyed by the demonic desire. His vital essence leaked out, his cultivation dropped five levels, and he almost lost his life!"</p><p>Qin Sang was stunned and could only sigh with regret.</p><p>Sect Master Gu confirmed everything meticulously and then his expression eased somewhat. He glanced at Qin Sang in slight surprise and nodded. "To think you would be the first to condense the jade cauldron. I must first examine your aptitude... Oh? Five different elemental spiritual roots!"</p><p>Qin Sang naturally still used spirit medicines to conceal his aptitude, but he didn't dare to conceal the fact that he had consumed a foundation establishment pill without any effect.</p><p>He secretly glanced at Sect Master Gu and noticed that his expression didn't seem too good. His heart couldn't help but race, pounding in his chest as his fists clenched tightly.</p><p>It wasn't that he lacked composure, but this might be his closest chance to reaching the foundation establishment stage in ten years!</p><p>However, unbeknownst to him, Sect Master Gu was secretly muttering to himself.</p><p>As sect master, his authority was neither small nor great; he was merely a figurehead for the various masters. Seeing that he was old and steady, and that he had no hope of forming a golden core, they pushed him forward to handle trivial matters to avoid interrupting their cultivation.</p><p>Mount Shaohua's major decisions were always made with a single word from the Nascent Soul Patriarch or after the various Golden Core Sages deliberated and passed down decrees. He simply carried out the orders as required.</p><p>Once Mount Shaohua's disciples broke through to the foundation establishment stage, so long as their aptitude wasn't too poor, they all had the chance to become disciples under a Golden Core Sage. It could be said that everyone had someone to back them and they didn't fear the sect master in the slightest. The most they'd do was be somewhat respectful toward him.</p><p>The things he usually handled were the most trivial matters within the sect. The moment it involved a conflict of interest, he could only become a marionette and wait for the results of the bargaining above him.</p><p>He couldn't even interfere with the distribution of foundation establishment pills.</p><p>Firstly, the sect had strict rules that no one dared defy.</p><p>Secondly, the number of foundation establishment pills was limited. Even when the harvest was good and there were a few extra, they had already been promised to the juniors. If they weren't distributed evenly, the case would immediately reach the Golden Core Sages.</p><p>This time, the Taoist Zhenma had sent down a decree seeking a dual cultivating partner, and with the patriarch's backing, Sect Master Gu naturally didn't dare be careless. Knowing full well that this technique was problematic, he still had to prepare as best as he could.</p><p>He had even racked his mind and prepared three foundation establishment pills in case of emergencies.</p><p>Never would he have expected to encounter a disciple with five different elemental spiritual roots. Three foundation establishment pills were definitely not enough. If he were to forcibly take someone else's pill at this time, it would cause such an uproar that he wouldn't be able to suppress it.</p><p>In any case, he had already found someone who fit the conditions and completed his task. He would leave the rest to Taoist Zhenma to handle. They were just a few foundation establishment pills.</p><p>Thinking of this, Sect Master Gu had Qin Sang wait quietly while he carefully chose his words and wrote a sword talisman, which he then sent out.</p><p>The sword talisman transformed into a beam of flowing light, disappearing in the depths of the Vast Mist Swamp in an instant, rushing toward Taoist Zhenma's cave abode.</p><p>A few moments later, the Vast Mist Swamp was still completely calm. Instead, the clouds suddenly began to churn atop Mount Shaohua, formations wavered, and a beam of green light descended from the sky and directly entered Qin Sang's cave abode.</p><p>Sect Master Gu sensed it and instantly flew out of his cave abode. As he raised his head, he saw that the green light enveloped a verdant spirit medicine, only as big as a palm. Its branches and leaves were entwined and shaped exactly like a true dragon, its body winding and fierce, its head raised as it breathed out a pearl. Its dragon eyes were extremely ferocious.</p><p>This pearl was the fruit of the fairy grass, with a body as red as fire!</p><p>"Dragon ginseng!"</p><p>Headmaster Yu's heart skipped a beat,  and he couldn't help gasping in surprise. Then, the maxim of the ancestor rang out by his ear suddenly, "Help this boy personally refine the Dragon ginseng and break the block soon. With this ginseng, he can lay the foundation without taking the foundation pill."</p><p>Headmaster Yu quickly controlled his expression and lowered his eyes, kowtowing.</p><p>"May the disciple follow the maxim of the ancestor!"</p><p>Qin Sang in the cave immediately laid down on the ground obediently after seeing Headmaster Yu's gesture, with his heart full of shock and anticipation. He was shocked that his foundation-laying could alarm the Primordial Soul ancestor, Dongyang Bo, and he anticipated that it should be extremely easy for a Primordial Soul ancestor to help a disciple lay the foundation, should it not?</p><p>Green lights dispersed, and the Dragon ginseng landed in front of Headmaster Yu.</p><p>Headmaster Yu raised his hands high, holding the Dragon ginseng carefully, and knelt on the ground without moving for quite a while before he got up, bowed to the mountaintop, and backed into the cave, saying to Qin Sang, "Get up."</p><p>Qin Sang stood up, staring at the dragon-shaped spirit herb in Headmaster Yu's hand with scorching eyes. He wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>Seeing this, Headmaster Yu said faintly, "This is Dragon ginseng. Swallowing it directly will have miraculous effects in helping one break the obstacle. Even in forming the Golden Pill, getting a thousand-year-old Dragon ginseng can provide some assistance. This kind of spirit herb has only been found twice in Mount Green Light, and you're lucky. I will help you refine this medicine. You will definitely lay the foundation. Shouldn't you thank the ancestor for his grace first?"</p><p>Qin Sang tried to restrain his excitement, kowtowed meticulously towards the mountaintop, and then got up and bowed to Headmaster Yu. "The disciple won't ever forget the kindness of the Headmaster's assistance."</p><p>He knew clearly that he had paid for this Dragon ginseng with the price of being a cauldron.</p><p>Of course, if he had been a casual cultivator, there would be no path for him to sell his body.</p><p>Headmaster Yu nodded, cast several sound transmitting notes, made arrangements on the sect affairs, and waved his hand to close the cave. He lifted his palm to support the Dragon ginseng, and flames suddenly appeared in the palm, slowly burning the Dragon ginseng body.</p><p>The spirit herb actually lasted in the flame for over an hour before it began to turn slightly withered.</p><p>At this moment, Headmaster Yu's face was a little pale. He shouted suddenly, and the flame in his palm jumped higher. The Dragon ginseng withered faster and faster. Finally, the whole thing was dry and cracked, and drops of bright green liquid were forced out from it, which then flew into the dragon pearl automatically.</p><p>The dragon pearl was red, and it became even brighter.</p><p>Headmaster Yu flicked his fingers, shot the dragon pearl to Qin Sang, and shouted, "Swallow it quickly!"</p>
