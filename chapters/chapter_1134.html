<h1>Chapter 1126: Sword Intent</h1><p>After their sparring session, the two returned to Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Bai went directly into seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang passed through the peach grove, arrived at the tomb of Elder Qingzhu, paid his respects, and then returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>He took out the charred piece of wood left by Yunyouzi.</p><p>Whether it was due to his insufficient cultivation or the wood's weakness, Qin Sang couldn't sense Yunyouzi's primordial spirit.</p><p>"Bai was right. I should wait until I reach the Yuan Ying stage before attempting this again to ensure success."</p><p>Qin Sang mused silently, "After forming the golden core, I'll first upgrade the Ebony Sword. The remaining Soul-Nourishing Wood is enough to raise the Ebony Sword to a top-grade magic weapon, only then can I integrate the charred wood."</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang took out the Du E Pill.</p><p>He hadn't had the time to examine it before.</p><p>'Pop!'</p><p>The jade bottle opened, and the spiritual mist condensed without dispersing.</p><p>He didn't smell the expected fragrance of the pill, but Qin Sang felt a sudden clarity in his mind, and his golden core and true essence in his dantian stirred, seemingly activated by the pill.</p><p>"Truly worthy of being the Du E Divine Pill!"</p><p>Qin Sang calmed his dantian, his gaze deepening slightly.</p><p>He only had one Du E Pill; forming the golden core had to succeed, there was no room for failure!</p><p>Then, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, his brow flashed, and the Ebony Sword flew out.</p><p>Since his time in the Canglang Sea, when Qin Sang had comprehended the branching of sword light, he hadn't slacked off, and had independently understood sword wheels. He had undergone rigorous sword training, sparred in the trial realm and against the puppet sword array, and studied the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*.</p><p>However, he was still one step away from comprehending sword intent.</p><p>Originally, Qin Sang planned to focus on cultivation, and continue with the sword path after forming the golden core, letting it come naturally.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he suddenly grasped sword intent.</p><p>Bai's suggestion to spar helped dispel his pent-up frustrations.</p><p>During the intense battle, Qin Sang fought without reservation, completely disregarding retreat, purely venting his emotions, and this unexpectedly caused a resonance in his sword heart, becoming the catalyst for his breakthrough.</p><p>However, he was still slightly short at that time.</p><p>Fortunately, Bai was knowledgeable and perceptive; he noticed Qin Sang's unusual state and immediately guessed what was happening. Under Bai's relentless pressure, Qin Sang finally broke through the bottleneck!</p><p>Sword intent is the origin of sword formations; it must be integrated into sword formations to unleash its true power.</p><p>Previously, Qin Sang had neglected the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, feeling that his current level would consume too much time, and that it was better to improve his cultivation and break through as soon as possible.</p><p>Since he had grasped sword intent, it would be much easier for Qin Sang to study the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, and if he could use sword formations, his combat power would increase significantly.</p><p>Various thoughts swirled in his mind.</p><p>Among them was the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*.</p><p>The various changes of the puppet sword array from its initial deployment.</p><p>The next level of the *Meta-Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter*, which contained a few words about the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>And Bai's words during their conversation.</p><p>"While you cultivate a killing-path sword array, I see a noble intent in your previous sword intent, it's not an extreme killing sword. But the sword energy you just displayed carries a hint of sadness."</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>He understood why Bai had such a feeling before.</p><p>Cultivating the *Meta-Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter* requires comprehending killing talismans through slaughter, even if one isn't bloodthirsty, coming out of a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood would inevitably affect one's state of mind.</p><p>But he had always been protected by the Jade Buddha, his mind remaining calm, merely using the technique as a means to advance.</p><p>Presumably, among cultivators of killing-path techniques, he had the least killing intent.</p><p>Furthermore, the *Meta-Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter* is actually all-encompassing; the technique is merely the foundation, and each cultivator has their own understanding, thus forging their own path.</p><p>Unintentionally, Qin Sang, without deviation, followed the technique, implicitly possessing the intent of a noble path. The sadness in his sword intent was related to the breakthrough opportunity; it was temporary, and after forming the golden core, it would return to the right track.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the *Qingzhu Sword Scripture*, and found that the sword intent within was different from his own.  It was relentless, sharp, yet with a hint of hatred and hesitation, matching Elder Qingzhu's experiences.</p><p>The puppet sword array was different again.</p><p>This sword array was infinitely variable, extremely precise and complex.</p><p>It could be certain that the puppet's creator had a great connection to the *Meta-Soul Sword Cultivation Chapter*, and the puppet sword array was created based on the Seven Souls Killing Array.</p><p>"Elder Qingzhu's path is not entirely suitable for me. I should only absorb the essence of the scripture and continue on the path of the technique, and not be influenced by Elder Qingzhu."</p><p>Qin Sang was clear-headed and made his choice, "Based on the changes of the puppet sword array, I should be able to grasp some meaning of the Seven Souls Killing Array.  Temporarily deploying a sword array using this will be the most suitable for me."</p><p>The advantages are clear.  After forming the Nascent Soul, the ebony sword will be used to nurture the primordial spirit of my senior. If I can independently comprehend the Seven Souls Killing Formation, I won't need my life-bound spirit sword to use it against enemies.</p><p>After careful consideration, Qin Sang affirmed her path.</p><p>Senior Sister Qing Jun is still missing. I can only go to the Finger Heaven Peak after she returns.</p><p>For now, my priority is cultivation and Nascent Soul formation. However, I now have free time from the *Heavenly Demon Body Refinement* technique, so I can dedicate some of it to comprehending the sword way.</p><p>…</p><p>Five years passed.</p><p>Time heals all wounds.</p><p>The sorrow of Yun Youzi's death has faded.</p><p>Qin Sang left her cave dwelling.</p><p>Snow fell outside, a thousand miles frozen, yet Peach Blossom Valley remained warm as spring.</p><p>A white crane carried a message talisman.</p><p>Qin Sang opened it; it was from Li Yu Fu. He wrote that he'd hit a cultivation bottleneck, was making no progress in seclusion, and had decided to travel.</p><p>More than twenty years had passed since Qin Sang's return.</p><p>The cultivation world had enjoyed an unusually long period of peace.  It almost felt as if the Abyss of Sin had lost its power to invade, and this peace would last forever.</p><p>Li Yu Fu is very talented and already quite strong, so Qin Sang isn't worried about him.</p><p>She saw the slightly disheveled peach orchard and entered, carefully pruning the branches.</p><p>These peach trees seemed to radiate loneliness. Senior Sister Qing Jun has been gone for too long.  With their master absent, the peach blossoms bloom for no one.</p><p>At that moment, the valley's protective formation was triggered.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. Looking towards the valley entrance, she finally saw that flash of red!</p><p>"Senior Sister!"</p><p>Qin Sang rushed to greet her.</p><p>Qing Jun's beauty remained unchanged. Gazing at the blooming peach blossoms, her sharp eyes softened.</p><p>"My, you're almost at the peak of the Core Formation stage!"</p><p>After a quick appraisal of Qin Sang, Qing Jun showed surprise.</p><p>She, of course, understood the power of the killing talismans in the *Chapter on Nurturing Swords with the Spirit*, but she was amazed by how much Qin Sang had changed during her absence – and not just in cultivation.</p><p>"A few more years are needed to hone my skills,"</p><p>Qin Sang replied.</p><p>"How are your preparations for Nascent Soul formation? How confident are you? It seems the Lesser Cold Region will soon have another Nascent Soul master."</p><p>As they walked into the orchard, Qing Jun, in high spirits, asked proactively.</p><p>"There's a small matter related to my Nascent Soul formation that I'd like your help with,"</p><p>Unsure how long Qing Jun would remain this time, Qin Sang quickly explained her plan.  "Senior Qing Zhu once said that a strong body helps in Nascent Soul formation. I'm cultivating a body refinement technique that needs stellar energy infusion to break through to the fourth level. Finger Heaven Peak is the best place for this.  I wonder if the teleportation array and the Immortal Mansion connected to Finger Heaven Peak are still there?"</p>
