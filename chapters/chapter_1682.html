<h1>Chapter 1673: Realm Shattered</h1><p>Within the medicinal garden.</p><p>Poison King and Qin Sang chased each other through the rows of precious herbs, while unexpectedly, Elder Hegao did not depart with Elder Zilei, but continued deeper into the garden.</p><p>Su Zinan also chose to remain.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, quicker in his actions, had already begun to plunder the garden's treasures.</p><p>Though vast, the garden's supply of spiritual herbs was finite.</p><p>Firstly, spiritual herbs were delicate, with demanding needs. Different herbs often clashed, requiring intricate formations and restrictions to alter the environment to suit their growth, thus occupying considerable space.</p><p>Secondly, only the most valuable or exceedingly rare spiritual herbs were deemed worthy of cultivation on Emperor's Bestowment Mountain.  Even within the Formless Immortal Sect, such herbs were not abundant.</p><p>Thirdly, during the demonic tribulation years ago, when the sect faced its gravest peril, most of these herbs were used to refine丹药, elixirs, to support the war effort, leaving nine out of ten formations empty.</p><p>Of course, the herbs were a secondary concern.  Both men, while gathering what they could, focused a portion of their attention on Elder Hegao, closely monitoring his movements.</p><p>Though animosity simmered between Mo Xingdao and Su Zinan, they maintained a fragile truce for the time being.</p><p>Thus, Elder Hegao remained at the forefront.</p><p>He traversed the medicinal garden, his discerning eye, honed by his prestigious sect's teachings, picking out only the most exceptional herbs.  Occasionally, a plant would pique his interest, prompting him to break the protective formation surrounding it.</p><p>In this manner, Elder Hegao circled nearly the entire garden.</p><p>He remained engrossed in his search, seemingly oblivious to the two figures trailing him at a cautious distance.</p><p>Gradually, suspicion gnawed at Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao.  They wondered if Elder Hegao was toying with them, deliberately leading them on a wild goose chase.</p><p>They not only tracked Elder Hegao but also observed the garden's formations and restrictions, sensing the surrounding spiritual energy, yet found nothing unusual.</p><p>Mo Xingdao, harboring no other ambitions, would be content with the herbs he had gathered.</p><p>Su Zinan, however, had forsaken the chance to exploit the chaos surrounding Poison King and the Fire Demon. Though his soul-capturing scheme with the demonic banner had been exposed, diminishing his chances of success, he still felt a pang of regret.</p><p>Growing impatient, Su Zinan glanced towards the mountain peak, recalling Elder Zilei, and a thought struck him: Was Elder Hegao merely putting on a show, keeping everyone occupied here to prevent interference with Elder Zilei?</p><p>Perhaps the true treasure lay at the summit!</p><p>But what were Venerable Fan and the other demonic elders doing?</p><p>Amidst the swirling confusion, who could grasp the full picture?</p><p>Su Zinan abandoned his contemplation, crossing hundreds of zhang in a single stride, weaving through the formations to approach Elder Hegao directly.  "What is the Elder searching for?" he inquired.</p><p>As if noticing him for the first time, Elder Hegao cast a dismissive glance. "I gather herbs to replenish my own garden. What business is it of yours? You’ve been following me for so long, have you taken a fancy to my nascent soul?"</p><p>His tone dripped with undisguised mockery, leaving no room for politeness.</p><p>With two souls residing within his banner and Mo Xingdao observing from afar, along with his Nascent Soul late-stage puppet, Su Zinan would have carefully weighed his words had they not been on the verge of conflict. Now, though wary of Elder Hegao, he did not fear him excessively.</p><p>Su Zinan's face twitched. Before he could speak, an enraged roar echoed through the air.</p><p>The roar reverberated across Emperor's Bestowment Mountain, reaching even the depths of the medicinal garden.</p><p>All three were momentarily stunned.</p><p>As Su Zinan sought the source of the roar, he sensed a sudden shift before him.  The resounding cry of a crane filled the air as Elder Hegao transformed into a shadowy avian form, crashing into a nearby spiritual formation.</p><p>The formation's five elemental energies were in disharmony, with earth energy dominating.  Yellow sand swirled within, hinting at the nature of the spiritual herbs it once housed.  Yet, the formation was empty.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Employing some unknown divine ability, Elder Hegao's crane form momentarily paused upon impact, then effortlessly pierced the formation's barrier.</p><p>By the time Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao arrived, they saw only whirling sand and a hazy crane silhouette vanishing into the depths.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Su Zinan and Mo Xingdao attacked simultaneously.</p><p>The demonic banner's main soul and the puppet's assault struck the formation almost in unison. Combined with their own attacks, the force of the combined strike was comparable to five Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators.</p><p>The formation's barrier groaned under the strain, collapsing under the onslaught. The violent sandstorm was ripped apart, revealing a fleeting glimpse of the crane silhouette within the newly formed void.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, the two men exchanged a glance.</p><p>Their shared animosity was undeniable, yet here they were, cooperating once more – a cruel irony.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the seal.</p><p>Venerable Fan, having unleashed the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand, knew he had made a grave error.</p><p>The Five-Colored Crown's light dimmed as the black tide surged, changing course to rush towards him.  Alarmed, his illusory demonic form dispersed into smoke, retreating into the lotus heart.</p><p>The Myriad Illusions Nether Lotus shot backwards, seeking refuge within the Heavenly Hao Mirror.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The black tide followed close behind, instantly engulfing the ancient mirror.</p><p>The mirror trembled violently, a brilliant light erupting from its center as a long crack appeared.  The black tide frantically poured into the fissure, threatening to tear it open and invade the mirror's inner realm.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The ancient mirror shattered, its fragments vanishing like a fleeting dream.</p><p>The black tide churned even more violently, searching in vain before coalescing into a single point and slamming against the Five-Colored Crown.</p><p>Outside the seal.</p><p>Elder Zilei manifested his Thunder Sovereign Dharma Body, wielding the power of lightning.</p><p>In his grasp, the raging purple lightning transformed into chains of celestial punishment.</p><p>Embodied as the Thunder Sovereign, he delivered heaven's judgment!</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>Elder Zilei looked down upon Zhu Wudao, his aura as imposing as a mountain, as deep as an abyss of thunder.  He raised a hand, and bolts of lightning rained down, shattering the sword-transformed golden rainbow inch by inch.</p><p>Following closely behind the golden rainbow, the Purple Pupil Demonic Eye was Zhu Wudao's true killing move.</p><p>Yet, lightning possessed inherent power against evil. Clad in thunderous robes and crowned with an imperial diadem, Elder Zilei, shielded by swirling purple lightning, remained unyielding.</p><p>Cast by Zhu Wudao through the intermediary of the Demonic Child, the Purple Pupil Demonic Eye's power was already diminished, further hampered by layers of obstruction.  Its attempt to assail Elder Zilei's hardened mind proved futile.</p><p>Despite the Demonic Child's aid, Zhu Wudao felt a chill run down his spine. The aura emanating from above was unnerving. Abandoning his spiritual sword, he retracted the Purple Pupil and silently recited scriptures.</p><p>His brow split open, revealing a speck of black light that coalesced, resembling a third demonic eye.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>The black light vanished abruptly.</p><p>It reappeared within the lantern's illusory realm, transformed into a small black demonic blade. Insignificant compared to the boundless purple lightning, its aura seemed equally weak.</p><p>This, however, was a sign of its power condensed to the extreme. Wherever the demonic blade passed, the illusory starry sky created by the lantern collapsed into chaos. The Eight Scenery Palace Lantern spun rapidly, showering streams of light to repair the illusion, yet it could no longer stop the blade's advance.</p><p>In an instant, only the barrier of lightning separated Elder Zilei from the demonic blade.</p><p>Undeterred, Elder Zilei gathered purple light before him.  A similar thunder seal formed, yet markedly different from before, its runes more complex, condensed through the power of the imperial crown.</p><p>As the thunder seal descended, the surrounding lightning converged upon it, expanding its size severalfold.  The colossal seal met the demonic blade head-on.</p><p>It wasn't that Zhu Wudao didn't want to alter the blade's trajectory, but he had no opportunity!</p><p>The thunder seal and the demonic blade collided, annihilating each other.</p><p>In the next moment, their combined power fused, forming a swirling sphere of purple and black.  It lasted but a fleeting instant before exploding.</p><p>A deafening roar reverberated through the mountain's belly.</p><p>Anticipating this, Elder Zilei had contracted the lantern's illusion to shield it from the blast, simultaneously sweeping his hand across the imperial crown, channeling the purple lightning into the illusion.</p><p>The illusion shifted rapidly.</p><p>By the time Zhu Wudao reacted, he was surrounded by omnipresent lightning.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's brow twitched. He had expected the guardian of the first gate to be formidable, but not this powerful.  Even with the Demonic Child's assistance, he had failed to gain the upper hand.</p><p>Fortunately, the demonic blade had bought him time.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, who had been secretly preparing, finally completed his spiritual formation. With a flick of his wrist, the divine statue left his hand, landing at the formation's center, assuming a seated posture.</p><p>The statue, blood-red and eerily demonic, pulsed with power.</p><p>The completion of the formation coincided with the peak of the blood sacrifice outside.  Thick, bloody energy seeped from the statue, its eyes now stained black.</p><p>The inanimate statue blinked, its dark gaze fixing upon Zhu Wudao.  A surge of power transferred, flooding into Zhu Wudao’s body.</p><p>Cracking sounds echoed, both from Zhu Wudao’s bones and the twisting golden armor he wore.</p><p>His arms outstretched, hair whipping wildly, Zhu Wudao radiated demonic energy.</p><p>Sensing a lethal threat, Elder Zilei's expression shifted.</p><p>A flicker of confusion crossed Zhu Wudao's face. The power flowing from the Demonic Child was far greater than anticipated. Although the passage was open, the Demonic Child still required time to fully escape, transferring its essence gradually.</p><p>Communicating with the Demonic Child, Zhu Wudao quickly understood the reason and let out a chuckle.</p><p>He had Senior Fan to thank.</p><p>With this unforeseen development, the situation was far more advantageous!</p><p>At that moment, a pained groan echoed from the mountain peak, and a figure plummeted downwards.</p><p>Evading the black tide, Venerable Fan had decisively shattered the mirror's projection, hastily returning. The mirror talisman before him vibrated violently, nearly shattering as well.</p><p>His illusory demonic form, similarly affected, was ejected from the talisman, revealing his true form, injured.</p><p>Concealed within the illusion, Elder Zilei witnessed the events within the mountain's belly.</p><p>Sensing Elder Zilei's sharp gaze, Venerable Fan took the initiative, roaring, "Old bullnose, look what you've done!"</p><p>His shout echoing, Venerable Fan halted his descent, turning to flee.</p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p>Elder Zilei scoffed. The Eight Scenery Palace Lantern ascended, its illusion expanding rapidly. By the time Venerable Fan stabilized his mirror talisman, he had been drawn into the lantern's illusory realm.</p><p>It wasn't that Elder Zilei desired to fight them all at once, but the unfolding events were too unexpected, his sense of foreboding intensifying. Too many pieces of the puzzle remained unclear.</p><p>Venerable Fan's sudden appearance clearly indicated some hidden action.</p><p>Within the illusion, Venerable Fan observed Zhu Wudao's transformation.  Connecting it to his experience within the seal, he grasped the full picture, realizing his junior brother’s schemes ran deeper than he imagined.</p><p>Venerable Fan sighed, relaying the truth to Elder Zilei through divine sense.</p><p>Instantly, both their gazes fixed upon the statue within the formation.</p><p>Below.</p><p>Unconcerned with their exchange, Zhu Wudao’s sole focus was ensuring the Demonic Child's escape from the seal, preventing any attack on the statue that might disrupt the passage.</p><p>If it were the Saint Sovereign himself, invoking his descent, even a fraction of his power would make him invincible. But for now, caution was paramount.</p><p>Otherwise, after climbing nine-tenths of the mountain, he would fall short of the summit.</p><p>Zhu Wudao shifted, positioning himself above the statue, blocking their view. Demonic energy gathered in his palms, forming two dark spheres that served as anchors for a shadowy canopy that unfurled above, concealing everything beneath.</p><p>The surrounding spiritual energy stirred.</p><p>A similar phenomenon had occurred when the lantern's illusion expanded, but now, the shadowy canopy grew increasingly dense.</p><p>Within the seal.</p><p>The black tide relentlessly assaulted the Five Elements Crown.</p><p>Though its light had dimmed, bolstered by the Five Elements Divine Restriction, the crown remained stable at the heart of the black tide, unyielding.</p><p>The artifact spirit had detected the 'passage' between the statue and the Demonic Child.</p><p>However, tainted and facing the Demonic Child's furious counterattack, the artifact spirit was momentarily helpless.  The passage itself was incredibly profound, its foundation not within the mountain but thousands of miles away, supported by countless blood-soaked statues channeling a constant stream of power.  It could not be easily severed.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>…</p><p>The relentless assault continued, accompanied by the Demonic Child’s threats and enticements.</p><p>"You cannot devour me!"</p><p>"Why not join forces with me and taint this entire realm with demonic energy!"</p><p>"Our conflict will only benefit others."</p><p>"Have you forgotten how they enslaved you, controlled you? Do you yearn to return to that?"</p><p>"Oh, artifact spirit! Who can resist such temptation?"</p><p>"By helping them seal me, you condemn yourself to the same fate.  They won't grant you the chance to complete your true nature! Even if they agree, it will be a trap, a means to control you!"</p><p>"You've dealt with them before. Each one is cunning and ruthless. Do you believe your wit can match theirs?"</p><p>"Only I, in this desperate situation, offer you a sincere alliance!"</p><p>"Release the seal, and I will forge a soul pact with you, imparting the Spirit Shaping Art. You will be free to come and go as you please."</p><p>"Otherwise, once I escape, I will claim you as my own!"</p><p>…</p><p>These words penetrated the Five Elements Crown, assaulting the artifact spirit’s mind.</p><p>The taunts fueled its rage.</p><p>Yet, the artifact spirit could offer no rebuttal.</p><p>During its time inhabiting the Kun Dao, any of those present on the mountain, placed in its position, could have exploited the conflicts between the others, devising a far more intricate and deadly scheme to seize control. Yet, she had bungled it.</p><p>Throughout, the artifact spirit remained silent, offering no response, focusing solely on its main body. Waves of five-colored light rippled outwards, cleansing the Filthy Yin Phosphorus Sand clinging to the crown, its luster gradually returning.</p><p>Amidst the Demonic Child's relentless assault on the seal, a flaw in the Seven Lunar Mansions Sword Formation suddenly magnified, rapidly spreading throughout the Five Elements Divine Restriction, affecting the seal itself.</p><p>The cycle of five elements still held, preventing the immediate collapse of the divine restriction, but anomalies began to manifest.</p><p>The first signs appeared in the barrier, formed from the seal’s power and integrating the mountain’s other formations.  As the seal faltered, the barrier was the first to react.</p><p>Qin Sang and Poison King, the trio within the medicinal garden, and the cultivators outside Emperor's Bestowment Mountain – all witnessed cracks spreading across the barrier, tainted by the wind煞, evil energy, like slithering serpents, a chilling sight.</p><p>Those within heard a resounding boom that echoed throughout Emperor's Bestowment Mountain, shaking their very souls.</p><p>As Qin Sang sought the source of the disturbance, a look of surprise crossed his face. He raised his left hand, observing the faint glow emanating from the Blood Moon mark, accompanied by a subtle warmth.</p>
