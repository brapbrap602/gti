<h1>Chapter 1629: Opportunity</h1><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The Jade Smoke Torrent crashed against the golden armor, waves surging and churning, creating a thousand layers of ripples.  Upon impact, the golden armor shook violently, then abruptly shot forth a beam of golden light, swift as an arrow, incredibly sharp, piercing into the Jade Smoke Torrent.</p><p>Zhu Wudao, clad in battle armor, advanced step by step, his aura resembling a rainbow.</p><p>The vast, misty waves momentarily stalled, the golden light plowing a path through the center, aimed directly at Hegao Zhenren.</p><p>Zhu Wudao remained completely unscathed, a testament to the might of his armor.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren's eyes narrowed slightly, but he showed no panic.  Facing Zhu Wudao, he had already calculated every possibility. The seemingly fragile Jade Smoke Torrent was intentionally so.</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>A crane's shadow appeared behind Hegao Zhenren's head.</p><p>The Immortal Crane stretched its neck and cried out, its posture graceful.</p><p>With the appearance of the crane's shadow, Hegao Zhenren instantly soared several zhang high, nearly touching the ceiling of the ancient hall, evading the golden light's assault.</p><p>His hand seals changed.</p><p>The momentum of the Jade Smoke Torrent plummeted, as if transitioning from a raging river to a tranquil autumn moon on a calm lake. Wisps of light smoke drifted, its overwhelming force transforming into extreme gentleness.  The smoke filled the air, transforming into thousands of silken threads, wrapping layer upon layer around Zhu Wudao.</p><p>Simultaneously, purple lightning illuminated the space surrounding the teleportation formation, reflecting in Zhu Wudao's eyes, causing him to squint.</p><p>Five bolts of Purple Lightning shot forth.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a slight stinging in his eyes as he watched the lightning, even though the lightning serpents weren't directed at him.</p><p>At the critical moment, a white light suddenly arrived.</p><p>Mo Xingdao's Profound Energy, nurtured within his body for many years, was far from ordinary.  It pierced through the air, appearing directly above the path of the five lightning serpents.</p><p>Struck by the Profound Energy, the Purple Lightning seemed to solidify.</p><p>Unexpectedly, without any further action from Zilei Zhenren, the lightning serpents' bodies thrashed violently, using their overwhelming lightning force to forcibly break through the Profound Energy blockade.</p><p>Mo Xingdao hesitated no longer.  His hand formed a blade, and he slashed through the air.  The Profound Energy followed, descending swiftly!</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>The heads of all five lightning serpents were severed.</p><p>The rear halves of the serpents stiffened and collapsed, but the front halves, still charged with lightning, continued their swift advance. Mo Xingdao was powerless to stop them.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Xingdao finally realized that Zilei Zhenren's target wasn't the teleportation formation, but Zhu Wudao himself, simply aiming to obstruct him.</p><p>This differed from their expectations.</p><p>Mo Xingdao couldn't help but feel surprised.</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren flew towards the teleportation formation, only to be blocked by Qiling Dongzhu's red flowers.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Flower shadows flitted like butterflies, a breathtakingly beautiful sight.</p><p>In an instant, a field of flowers materialized in the void.</p><p>Hidden within this beautiful scene was deadly peril.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren's movement remained unimpeded.  Lightning erupted from his brow, revealing a Lightning Seal.</p><p>Forged entirely from lightning force, the seal radiated a hazy lightning glow.  Within it, lightning runes flowed and shifted, causing the light to pulse and flicker.</p><p>Seeing the Lightning Seal, Qiling Dongzhu's expression changed. The seal seemed to be a formidable divine ability.</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu rapidly changed his hand seals, but it was too late to react.</p><p>Thunder roared, and the Lightning Seal transformed into a cocoon of lightning.  A bolt of lightning, even more terrifying than the previous serpents, tore through the air, shattering the flower shadows with overwhelming force.</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu roared in anger, a flash of blood-red appearing in his eyes.</p><p>Within the collapsing flower shadows, the centers of the petals distorted, revealing agonizing human faces, clearly the faces of malevolent spirits.</p><p>The evil spirits roared, stabilizing the flower shadows. For a moment, hundreds of ghosts rampaged, baring their fangs and claws as they counterattacked Zilei Zhenren.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yue Lingtian had also clashed several times.</p><p>The three-legged cauldron possessed unique abilities.  Whenever the sword threads within the sword formation were illuminated by the cauldron's mouth, they seemed to slow, then were directly absorbed into the cauldron.  Qin Sang discovered that his connection with these sword threads was severed.</p><p>"Let's see how much you can absorb."</p><p>Qin Sang snorted inwardly, pushing the sword formation to its limits.</p><p>At the same time, a fire lotus spun in his palm.</p><p>Despite engaging Yue Lingtian, Qin Sang's focus wasn't there.  Seeing that Qiling Dongzhu couldn't hold back Zilei Zhenren, he considered lending him a hand.</p><p>At this moment, both Zhu Wudao and Zilei Zhenren's actions seemed unusual, clearly preparing to unleash powerful divine abilities to contend for the teleportation formation.</p><p>Then, the teleportation light extinguished before their eyes.</p><p>Everyone's movements froze the moment the light vanished.</p><p>Space itself seemed to solidify, mirroring their gazes.</p><p>Until this point, they had witnessed every change in the teleportation formation.  Even Zilei Zhenren and Zhu Wudao, closest to the formation, had no opportunity to tamper with it, yet the light had still extinguished.</p><p>The spatial fluctuations also vanished.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>A deathly silence fell over the hall.</p><p>Qin Sang clenched his fist, withdrawing the fire lotus he was about to unleash.  He stamped his foot silently, staring at the teleportation formation with a strange expression.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and Zilei Zhenren stared at each other across the formation.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's expression froze on his face, and Zilei Zhenren fared no better.</p><p>The others looked at the two in bewilderment, awaiting an explanation.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Zilei Zhenren placed new spirit stones into the formation.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's expression shifted slightly but he didn't interfere.</p><p>The others stopped and watched, a sense of absurdity washing over them.</p><p>After such a chaotic battle, some were already prepared to use their trump cards, and now they were contending for a broken formation?</p><p>The old spirit stones were pried from the formation's sockets.  The luster within them hadn't faded, indicating that their spiritual energy hadn't been completely depleted.</p><p>New spirit stones were inserted, reactivating the teleportation formation.</p><p>The ancient hall trembled, more cracks appearing.</p><p>Spatial fluctuations reappeared, but the respite was short-lived.  After a violent flicker, the result was the same!</p><p>The teleportation light, along with everyone's hopes, extinguished, their hearts sinking to the bottom of a valley!</p><p>Yet the formation operated smoothly, showing no signs of damage.</p><p>Those present were some of the rarest peak cultivators in the world; they couldn't be mistaken.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhu, what is going on?"</p><p>Qiling Dongzhu's face was grim.</p><p>He had agreed to wade into these troubled waters partly because of the Immortal Hall. He had traveled far and wide for it, even suffering injuries at the hands of the Poison King.</p><p>Was it all for naught?</p><p>Mo Xingdao didn't react as strongly. He hadn't known what treasures the Immortal Hall held, so his expectations were low, and his disappointment correspondingly minimal.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's expression shifted constantly, clearly this wasn't within his expectations either.</p><p>The divine statue in his sleeve grew scorching hot, burning his mind.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's lips curled into a bitter smile.  He mocked himself inwardly.  Despite all his meticulous planning, he hadn't foreseen this.</p><p>For whom had he toiled so tirelessly?</p><p>"We can only ask the esteemed Daoist experts," Zhu Wudao seemed to realize something, abruptly raising his head to question Zilei Zhenren.  "What exactly did you do in the Tiantong Hall to damage the teleportation formation?!"</p><p>Tiantong Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred. The South Sea Immortal Hall was indeed his target!</p><p>Zilei Zhenren remained silent.  His greatest fear had become reality.</p><p>By now, how could Zilei Zhenren not know?  He suspected that he had wrongly accused the Buddhists. It wasn't the Buddhist Sect that harmed Zhenjun Danyu, but some unknown change within the Immortal Hall.</p><p>The situation was even worse than he had anticipated. The path to the Immortal Hall was severed!</p><p>Zhenjun Danyu and Holy Monk Huiguang had met with an accident in the Immortal Hall, but the truth remained elusive.</p><p>"I only see Daoists, no Buddhist disciples.  Are you trying to hide this from the Buddhist Sect and enter the Immortal Hall alone?!"  Recalling Zilei Zhenren's earlier actions, Zhu Wudao gradually grasped the truth, his speech quickening. "Have the Daoists and Buddhists turned against each other? Or is there some reason you must enter the Immortal Hall?  Does the disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivators have something to do with the Immortal Hall?"</p><p>Zilei Zhenren couldn't answer a single one of these questions.</p><p>Hegao Zhenren's eyes held a hint of worry. With the teleportation formation disabled, the path to the Sword Tomb was cut off.</p><p>Yue Lingtian stared directly at Zilei Zhenren, his gaze unflinching.</p><p>Had Zilei Zhenren anticipated this beforehand?</p><p>Had the Immortal Hall already undergone some change?  Had he tolerated the remnants of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect because the normal path was blocked?  If they couldn't even enter the Immortal Hall, what about Zilei Zhenren's previous promises, and what about the price the Taiyue Sect had just paid?</p><p>Yue Lingtian clenched his fists secretly.</p><p>Zilei Zhenren, with his crane-like hair and youthful face, maintained his composure, the demeanor of a grandmaster.  He barked, "The Tiantong Hall is a place for sealing demons!  The Demon Lord's terror overflowed from the ancient scrolls that recorded it. Both sects have ancestral precepts: only the Tianxiang Hall may be explored; the Xian prohibitions of the Tiantong Hall must not be disturbed. It remains as it was when the Wuxiang Immortal Sect sealed its mountain.  Among those present, only Sect Master Zhu possesses the ability to secretly manipulate things.  Could it be that you intend to ditch us and enter the Immortal Hall alone, yet you dare to shift the blame?!"</p><p>His words held a certain logic.</p><p>Zhu Wudao had deep connections with the Wuxiang Immortal Sect and understood it thoroughly. He had personally opened the ancient hall and the teleportation formation. Only he had the ability to deceive everyone.</p><p>In this situation, even the most cunning and crafty individuals present couldn't discern the truth.</p><p>Although Yue Lingtian suspected the Eight Scenery Sect's malicious intent, he lacked evidence and didn't voice his suspicions, maintaining a posture of unity with Zilei Zhenren.</p><p>Zhu Wudao's lips moved slightly, transmitting a message. Qiling Dongzhu and Mo Xingdao both appeared hesitant.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>A sword's cry echoed through the ancient hall, startling everyone. It was Qin Sang suddenly withdrawing his sword formation.</p><p>The sword light drew everyone's gaze as it shot into Qin Sang's sleeve, disappearing from sight.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang, without a word, ignoring all transmitted messages, withdrew from the conflict and sped out of the hall, heading down the mountain without looking back.</p><p>The people within the ancient hall wore various expressions, deep in thought, searching their memories for this mysterious expert. Both sides suspected the other had brought him, but upon seeing the other's contemplative expressions, they became even more confused.</p><p>Qin Sang had remained on the periphery, harboring no deep grudges against either side. No one stopped him.</p><p>He arrived elegantly and departed just as gracefully, unconcerned with the outcome.  The swiftness of his actions and his decisiveness surprised everyone. They didn't even know his name.</p><p>On the stone path.</p><p>Qin Sang flew down the mountain.</p><p>"Judging by Zilei Zhenren's tone, both the Tiantong Hall and Tianxiang Hall were once controlled by the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, both located in Zhongzhou, and they are connected.  The Ziwei Palace and Seven Kill Hall are independent..."</p><p>Qin Sang mused inwardly.</p><p>These Immortal Halls all contained fragments of the Killing Sword, suggesting a connection between them. Before descending to this realm, they were likely a single Immortal Hall.</p><p>The Tianxiang Hall and Tiantong Hall were proof of this!</p><p>Just now, Qin Sang had secretly activated his Heavenly Eye, analyzing the teleportation formation. He confirmed that the formation's restrictions were undamaged. It would be difficult for Zhu Wudao to tamper with it under the scrutiny of his Heavenly Eye. The problem likely lay on the other side.</p><p>Zhu Wudao and Zilei Zhenren's expressions and reactions indicated that an unknown change had occurred within the Immortal Hall!</p><p>They were unaware of the truth, but Qin Sang knew the reason.</p><p>He had personally witnessed the Immortal Hall ascend!</p><p>When he learned of the Tianxiang Hall and Tiantong Hall's existence, Qin Sang had suspected that when the Ziwei Palace ascended, other Immortal Halls might also be drawn along. He had guessed correctly.</p><p>This also explained the disappearance of the Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>Liuli's master, trapped within the Ziwei Palace, had ascended with it.  If those Nascent Soul cultivators, attracted by the Immortal Hall's ascension, had entered it but couldn't react in time, they would likely have been taken to another realm along with the hall.</p><p>He remembered clearly that the Nascent Soul cultivators who hadn't escaped the Ziwei Palace in time were crushed into pulp. Nascent Soul cultivators, with their vast divine abilities, possessed far greater life-saving capabilities.</p><p>The Immortal Halls had ascended.</p><p>The remaining cultivators could now only compete for the opportunities left behind by the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>No fewer than ten powerful cultivators had entered the game.</p><p>If not for Yun Long's intervention, even more Nascent Soul cultivators would have entered the Wuxiang Immortal Sect. The treasures here were limited, perhaps not enough for everyone. It all depended on who could seize the advantage.</p><p>The same applied to Qin Sang.  His only hope now lay within the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's scripture repository, hoping they had preserved the fragmented cultivation techniques.</p><p>Seeing the impending conflict, Qin Sang knew staying would be pointless.  He made a decisive move!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The stone path trembled, the restrictions destabilizing. Loose rocks tumbled from the cliff face.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced back, seeing multicolored lights erupting from the clifftop as the powerful cultivators battled.  The ancient hall finally succumbed, collapsing completely.</p><p>He could guess that Zilei Zhenren's insistence on capturing Zhu Wudao wasn't solely to interrogate him about the teleportation formation's change.  If they truly couldn't enter the Immortal Hall, Zhu Wudao, as the person most knowledgeable about the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, possessed valuable information.</p><p>The Eight Scenery Sect, with their numbers and strength, had the ability to capture him.</p><p>If Zhu Wudao couldn't persuade Qiling Dongzhu and Mo Xingdao to help him, his chances of survival were slim.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered the situation as he flew at incredible speed, rushing out from the cliff face and into the mountains, following the path his avatar had taken. He didn't know the final outcome of the battle.</p><p>His goal was clear: the core territory of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>His avatar had paved the way, leaving behind secret markings.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body effortlessly passed through layers of restrictions, traversing mountains and forests.</p><p>In the distance, he could see it.</p><p>The core territory of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, with its towering peaks, remained vibrant and full of spiritual energy despite years of dormancy.</p><p>Pavilions and temples dotted every mountain, emanating immortal qi.</p><p>One majestic mountain in the deepest part of the territory, though not as towering as the cliff face, clearly held great importance within the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Both his main body and avatar were heading in this direction.</p><p>Unbeknownst to them, this mountain was the ruler of the Five Phases, named Dishou Mountain!</p><p>After traveling for an unknown distance.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression shifted slightly. He abruptly changed direction, heading towards the west side of Dishou Mountain.  Soon, he saw a figure flying towards him, his avatar.</p><p>His avatar had gone ahead, his primary mission to locate the scripture repository.</p><p>"I found it!"</p><p>His avatar's face was filled with joy as he pointed behind him towards a distant peak.  "There's a Jade Scripture Pavilion within that mountain."</p><p>He had just glimpsed the inscription on the Jade Pavilion's roof plaque from afar and was heading there when he sensed his main body's arrival.</p><p>Their minds connected.</p><p>The main body and avatar understood each other's experiences and decided to join forces and head to the Jade Scripture Pavilion first.</p><p>Just a short distance away, Qin Sang suddenly let out a soft gasp, stopping in his tracks and staring towards the Jade Scripture Pavilion's direction.</p><p>Across several mountains and plains.</p><p>There stood an Immortal mountain, bathed in radiant light that illuminated all directions, a breathtakingly beautiful sight.</p><p>Within the cold light, he could faintly discern a corner of an ice palace, identical to the one conjured by the mysterious ice disc!</p>
