<h1>Chapter 916: Cultivating Both Body and Dharma</h1><p>The old man and the others were terrified, their fighting spirit completely gone. Even though they were manipulating the forbidden talismans, they couldn't exert much power.  They were easily captured by the Avatars and the Twin-Headed Serpent, who then interrogated them. Meanwhile, the Twin-Headed Serpent guarded Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang was already locked in fierce combat with the Cave Master of the Sacrificial Demon Cave. The battlefield was utterly chaotic.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>A figure was knocked back, staggering.</p><p>The surprised voice of the Cave Master rang out, “You are a body cultivator? This is the first time I've fought a body cultivator of such a high realm. However, with just this level of strength, trying to stop me is nothing but a fool's dream.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, “Indeed, I can't be your opponent with physical strength alone.”</p><p>Before his voice faded, Qin Sang's aura transformed.  A magnificent, iridescent phoenix wing unfolded behind him. With a gentle flap, Qin Sang transformed into a streak of rainbow light, blocking the Cave Master’s path.</p><p>He chose to fight the old demon alone to test the results of his years of arduous cultivation. </p><p>His “Celestial Demon Refining Form” hadn't yet reached the mid-stage of the third level. He had just fought the old demon with his physical body alone and felt strained, showing signs of defeat in a single exchange.</p><p>After activating the Celestial Demon Transformation, Qin Sang's aura soared. However, to defeat the old demon, this alone wasn't enough. He needed to display the true power of cultivating both body and dharma.</p><p>“Demonic Qi?”</p><p>The Cave Master was taken aback.</p><p>It was normal for Nascent Soul cultivators of the Boundless Sea to have demonic qi. But he had never seen demonic qi this dense.</p><p>He could be certain that this person was a human cultivator, not a demon beast.</p><p>What shocked him even more was Qin Sang's escape speed. After the wings appeared, it skyrocketed, surpassing even the fastest Nascent Soul peak cultivators he had seen.</p><p>The Cave Master realized that unless he killed this person, he wouldn't be able to escape.</p><p>Qin Sang's calm demeanor, with his spirit beast standing guard, also made the Cave Master frown. His cultivation was clearly a realm higher, but for some reason, he had a persistent sense of foreboding.</p><p>The Cave Master couldn't help but look into the distance. His companions were still nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Are you looking for these?”</p><p>Qin Sang beckoned to the side. A beautiful butterfly appeared out of thin air, its wings shimmering as it landed on the back of Qin Sang's hand. A ball of lightning hovered before it, containing several mosquito-like spirit insects flying around like headless flies.</p><p>The cunning Cave Master had secretly released multiple messaging spirit insects, all of which were captured by the Sky-Eyed Butterfly.</p><p>“Sky-Eyed Butterfly!”</p><p>The Cave Master exclaimed, “A natal Gu worm? No, you're not a witch, how dare you…”</p><p>A strange glint flashed in Qin Sang's eyes. “It seems you are also very knowledgeable in insect control, recognizing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly as my natal Gu worm at a glance.  That means I can’t let you live.”</p><p>The lightning ball easily annihilated the spirit insects. The Sky-Eyed Butterfly flew into Qin Sang's embrace.  With a tap of his foot, Qin Sang's figure vanished, reappearing above the Cave Master in the next instant.</p><p>A myriad of fist shadows descended, bombarding the old demon.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>An astonishing force descended from the heavens.</p><p>“If you want to keep me here, it depends on whether you have the ability!”</p><p>A ferocious expression appeared on the Cave Master's face. Since he couldn't shake off this person, he immediately cast aside all distracting thoughts. He opened his demonic maw wide, spewing out a mass of pitch-black demonic light.</p><p>The demonic light shot skyward, exploding the moment it touched the fist shadows. The demonic light swept across all directions like a raging tide.</p><p>Countless fist shadows were annihilated under the demonic light, which also rapidly faded.</p><p>The two forces neutralized each other, equally matched.</p><p>As the demonic light dispersed, a cyan light was revealed. The cyan light trembled slightly, slowly parting to the sides. It was Qin Sang, who had enveloped himself with his phoenix wings, remaining unharmed under the impact of the demonic light.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>In the next moment, Qin Sang’s figure materialized before the Cave Master.  With a slight twist, he struck fiercely at the Cave Master’s chest.</p><p>While the demonic light was blocking Qin Sang, the Cave Master had already summoned his magical treasure. A small, ancient bronze bell spun and flew up, emitting a bright yellow light, transforming into a yellow bell shadow that enveloped the Cave Master.</p><p>At the same time, a blood-red blade flashed from the Cave Master’s dantian, emanating a thick, nauseating bloody stench.</p><p>‘Dong!’</p><p>The bell shadow was struck by the heavy fist, and the sound of metal clashing resonated as the bell itself trembled violently.</p><p>The Cave Master’s figure retreated to dissipate the force. Secretly, he made a hand seal, and the blood blade shot through the air with equally astonishing speed, aiming straight for Qin Sang’s forehead.</p><p>The timing was perfect, precisely when Qin Sang’s old strength was exhausted and his new strength had yet to emerge.</p><p>As the blood blade flew towards him, Qin Sang’s face showed no fear. A light flashed from his forehead as the Ebony Sword shot out, instantly colliding with the blood blade.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>With a crisp sound, the Ebony Sword and the blood blade were both knocked back.</p><p>The Ebony Sword was slightly weaker, after all, it was only a low-grade magical treasure, while the blood blade had been refined by the Cave Master to the power of a mid-grade magical treasure.</p><p>What followed was the Cave Master's furious roar.  He grabbed the blood blade, his face filled with shock and rage. This natal magical treasure had lost its luster and appeared greatly diminished in spirit.</p><p>“What did you do!”</p><p>The Cave Master roared.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered.  Since the opponent dared to use his natal magical treasure against the Ebony Sword, he naturally showed no mercy, using the Blood Defilement Divine Light to strike the blade.</p><p>He remained silent, flapping his wings again as he formed hand seals.</p><p>In an instant, fist shadows and the Ebony Sword arrived, threatening to engulf the Cave Master. Before the Cave Master could react, the Ebony Sword flickered, and countless bright sword lights scattered among the fist shadows, making it difficult to distinguish the real from the illusory.</p><p>“Sword Light Splitting.”</p><p>The Cave Master was almost numb. His premonition had come true.</p><p>This person not only cultivated both body and dharma and possessed a natal Gu worm, but he also mastered the grand divine ability countless sword cultivators dreamed of.</p><p>With this level of strength, he would be treated as a honored guest by any faction, yet he was hiding in this desolate place, only to be encountered by him.</p><p>‘Dong, dong…’</p><p>The ringing continued, and the bell shadow around the Cave Master trembled violently.  Under the Cave Master's horrified gaze, it shattered into countless fragments.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't given up on comprehending Sword Light Splitting, he simply hadn't focused his main energy on it. But compared to ten years ago, his swordsmanship had definitely improved.</p><p>The Cave Master’s strength was only slightly stronger than the black-robed man on Clarity Island.</p><p>With his powerful swordsmanship and the Sword Light Splitting divine ability alone, Qin Sang was capable of fighting him.</p><p>After activating the Celestial Demon Transformation, without using the Star Conch and other items, he might still be no match for Grandmaster Lu or the Fang youth, but defeating this person was still within his grasp.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang had even used the Blood Defilement Divine Light, so the outcome was without a doubt.</p><p>After the bell shadow was broken, the Cave Master successively deployed magical treasures and talismans, attempting to use divine abilities to escape, but he was suppressed by Qin Sang at every turn.</p><p>Unable to fight or flee, the Cave Master fell into utter despair.</p><p>Chaotic true essence formed a storm, radiating strange lights, obscuring the figures within.</p><p>Then, a scream rang out.</p><p>The storm slowly dissipated.</p><p>Qin Sang’s right arm was seen piercing through the Cave Master’s left chest, his bloody hand clutching a shattered heart.</p>
