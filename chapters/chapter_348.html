Chapter 341: Reencountering the Wandering Cultivator


The young man in strong clothing was laid on a wooden bed.
While capturing the young man, Qin Sang had completed the first layer of the enchantment.
The young man's body and spirit were sealed, but outwardly, there was little difference from when he was alive. Only his skin had a faint bluish-black tinge.
Even after being refined into a corpse, the change wouldn't be too significant; this is one of the differences between a living corpse and a fierce corpse.
To others, it's almost impossible to tell that a living corpse is a refined corpse from its appearance.
Especially when freshly refined, it's almost indistinguishable from its living state, only slowly changing over time.
Like the living corpse he encountered with Bai Yunshan at the Tian Shi Sect branch, even after many years, besides growing fangs and claws, its appearance hadn't drastically changed.
Of course, the strong corpse aura would still reveal its true nature.
But there are ways around that.
The biggest difference between a living corpse and a fierce corpse, and the reason why living corpses are far stronger, lies in their ability to retain one of their pre-death spells.  Simultaneously, the refiner can also infuse a spell using the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.
Qin Sang had already made his choice, deciding to infuse the *Tun Ling Jue* (Escape Spirit Technique).
The *Tun Ling Jue* not only conceals cultivation but also masks demonic,妖, and corpse auras, and other unusual energies.  Back then, Gu Tiannan and his disciple used this technique to hide the demonic aura produced by cultivating the *Shi Dan Secret Technique*, deceiving Qin Sang's perception.
With the *Tun Ling Jue*, the corpse aura of the living corpse can be concealed as much as possible, only revealed during combat, or by cultivators far surpassing the living corpse's former cultivation level.
While it doesn't instantly improve its strength, it can sometimes have miraculous effects.
The young man lay quietly on the wooden bed, oblivious to everything.
Qin Sang pondered for a moment, summoned the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, held it in his palm, and cast countless enchantments. Some landed on the talisman, while others drifted towards the young man.
Gradually, a strange connection seemed to form between the talisman and the young man.
Upon completion of the last enchantment, Qin Sang paused slightly, his eyes suddenly widening.  He flipped his palm, abruptly pressing the Heavenly Corpse Talisman against the young man's forehead!
"Seal!"
With Qin Sang's roar, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman suddenly emitted a幽光, flashed, and disappeared into the young man's body, entering his spirit space.
Immediately, Qin Sang felt an exceptionally strong resistance coming from the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.
The talisman vibrated violently under the impact.
Qin Sang's spiritual sense was even stronger than that of cultivators at the same level.  Facing this resistance, he was fearless, carefully protecting the talisman and slowly continuing the secret technique.
Finally, the resistance completely disappeared.
The Heavenly Corpse Talisman seal was complete!
At this moment, Qin Sang suddenly stopped, exhaled a breath of stale air, and looked down at the young man.
Whether or not to erase this person's consciousness was a toss-up, decided by the refiner.  If not erased, the living corpse would have higher intelligence and slightly greater strength after refinement.
Qin Sang ultimately decided to erase the person's consciousness.
In this way, the person was essentially dead, only the vitality of the spirit remaining, preserved by the Heavenly Corpse Talisman.
With the spirit sealed, the next step was the refinement of the body.  Only when the Heavenly Corpse Talisman and all enchantments were interconnected, forming a unified whole, would the refinement be complete.
This step was also not easy, as it required maintaining the corpse's vitality.  The dantian (energy center) must be preserved and not completely filled with earth-sha aura.  If the earth-sha aura damaged the dantian, all efforts would be wasted.
Therefore, although Qin Sang was proficient in Five Elements Foundation Building, he still dared not be careless.
The young man had cultivated a metal-elemental technique before his death, so Qin Sang began with Blue Nether Gold, following the order of the Five Elements generation cycle, infusing Five Elements Yin objects into his body.
As expected, the consumption of Five Elements Yin objects was several times that of a fierce corpse.  Fortunately, Qin Sang had prepared sufficiently.
'Whoosh!'
Spiritual energy lifted one of the Shao Yin magnetic bottles, flying into Qin Sang's palm.
The bottle opened, and the earth-sha aura flowed out. Under Qin Sang's control, it entered the dantian of the living corpse.  Immediately, it was met with resistance from the spiritual energy within.
This was completely different from refining a fierce corpse; the dantian of a fierce corpse was empty!
At this moment, the spiritual energy in the living corpse's dantian began to fiercely counterattack, like a storm in the ocean. The earth-sha aura and spiritual energy violently clashed, each refusing to yield.
Fortunately, thanks to the strengthening of the Five Elements Yin objects and the *Tian Yin Shi Jue* (Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique) enchantments, the dantian was spared.


Seeing that a vial of earth-fiend Qi was almost exhausted, yet had failed to infuse even a wisp into the living corpse's dantian, Qin Sang's expression darkened.  The difficulty was far greater than he'd anticipated.

A second vial of earth-fiend Qi.

Still nothing!

A third vial, still no sign of success.

Qin Sang gave up, stopped the refinement, and resealed it.  A trip to Shao Hua Mountain seemed inevitable, but he would deal with the immediate problems first.

After clearing the lingering Qi from the cave, Qin Sang sat cross-legged, entering a meditative state to cultivate.

On the fifth day, the protective formation outside the cave was triggered.  Qin Sang felt it instinctively, awakening from his meditation. He summoned the message talisman into his palm, and a pleased expression spread across his face upon reading the contents.

Leaping out of the cave, Qin Sang instructed Tan Hao to wait inside while he used his flying technique to head towards Yin Mountain Pass.

Ling Dan Pavilion.

Qin Sang saw Yun Youzi again.

His appearance hadn't changed much, but his complexion was somewhat improved.  The Jiuhua Frost Grass had clearly been effective.

Now, Yun Youzi's Qi was far stronger than four years ago; he was likely at the peak of the early Foundation Establishment stage, on the verge of the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.

But he hadn't broken through, having been surpassed by Qin Sang.

However, judging by appearances alone, Qin Sang couldn't tell if Yun Youzi's soul injury had healed.

While Qin Sang was observing Yun Youzi, Yun Youzi noticed that Qin Sang had broken through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage.  He asked with some surprise, "Brother Qin, have you refined the Blood-Dripping Ghost Mushroom as well?"

Qin Sang shook his head with a wry smile.

Yun Youzi's expression fell.  Without the Blood-Dripping Ghost Mushroom, Qin Sang's rapid advancement to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage could only mean one thing: the Xuanwen Harmony Pill hadn't healed his injuries, and the medicinal power had been used solely to improve his cultivation.

"I don't know whether to congratulate you,"

Yun Youzi sighed, offering some comfort.  "But, Brother Qin, achieving the mid-Foundation Establishment stage is still something to be happy about; it's far better than my progress."

Qin Sang frowned and quickly asked, "Was the Jiuhua Frost Grass ineffective for you?"

A thousand-year-old Jiuhua Frost Grass, and yet it couldn't cure Yun Youzi.

Could his soul injury be even more severe than Qin Sang's foundational damage?

Yun Youzi sighed, "It had some effect, better than nothing!  Actually, I didn't expect the Jiuhua Frost Grass to cure the injury, but I thought it would at least heal a portion of it, so I wouldn't have to worry about it before forming the Golden Core. Who would have thought the effect would be even less than expected? I'm still stuck in the early Foundation Establishment stage, unable to make any progress."
