<h1>Chapter 2052: Haitang Academy</h1><p>“What’s the trouble?” Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Su Nu replied, “After learning about this, I tried to find them. But during the investigation, I discovered another force secretly searching for them. Luckily, I found out in time, and I hid myself while investigating this force. It turned out to be a group of otherworldly beings from Lansha Prefecture.  Those two also sensed danger and are constantly moving, making it difficult to locate them. However, they're alone and without outside help in Lansha Prefecture.  They’re hiding everywhere and are probably running out of options…”</p><p>“You want to rescue them from that force?”</p><p>Qin Sang understood Su Nu’s intentions.</p><p>The Storm Realm is trapped in the Mist Sea. To reach the Storm Realm, they must pass through the otherworldly beings’ territory.  If their suspicions are correct, and the Changyou tribe is a Celestial Department tribe, they might even have to cross the Water Department.</p><p>Several human cultivators traveling through otherworldly territory for a long time, no matter how well they hide, are bound to have accidents and will eventually be discovered.  The otherworldly beings aren't without experts, and each department possesses unique abilities.</p><p>They know almost nothing about the Mist Sea, so finding an otherworldly guide is necessary.</p><p>Regardless of their identities, these two being able to escape from the Celestial Department to Lansha Prefecture means we can bring them back from Lansha Prefecture to the Celestial Department.</p><p>Furthermore, once we find the Storm Realm, how to handle relations with surrounding otherworldly beings is a huge concern.  There's more than just the Changyou tribe in the Mist Sea. Even if we destroy the Changyou tribe, there are other tribes.</p><p>Powerful otherworldly beings would be pleased to see the Changyou tribe destroy the Storm Realm. But once the Storm Realm has the ability to destroy the Changyou tribe, they definitely won’t stand idly by and will inevitably interfere.</p><p>To achieve lasting stability in the Mist Sea, the best approach is to work from within the otherworldly beings, finding supporters. These two might be an opportunity.</p><p>“Their cultivation should be strong, right?” Qin Sang immediately asked another question.</p><p>Su Nu nodded.  “Both are definitely Void Realm cultivators; at least one is at Void Realm level two, equivalent to our Transcendence stage, but their exact cultivation levels are unknown. Their abilities are quite mysterious, probably related to concealment and illusion, otherwise they couldn't have escaped for so long without revealing their identities.”</p><p>After a pause, Su Nu smiled wryly, “Forgive my ignorance, Qin Xiong, I still don’t even know if they are male or female.”</p><p>“And their tribe is unknown?”</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised. “Did you find out why they fled to Lansha Prefecture? Why are those otherworldly beings pursuing them?”</p><p>“For fear of discovery, I haven't dared to investigate thoroughly, so I haven't gotten much information. What I managed to glean from the otherworldly beings' forces is that these two Celestial Department individuals deserted their tribe and fled to Lansha Prefecture. They must have some big secret, maybe they stole a treasure. Even if not, among the otherworldly beings, cultivation corresponds to status. These two must be important figures in some tribe. Capturing them would be a great achievement, and the merfolk would certainly give a generous reward. Of course, this might be deliberately released misinformation; outsiders can't know the truth,” Su Nu briefly described the information she gathered, allowing Qin Sang to make a judgment.</p><p>“A big secret? A treasure of the otherworldly beings?”</p><p>Qin Sang was thoughtful. He wouldn't be tempted by such a statement; no matter how good the otherworldly beings' treasures are, they might not be suitable for humans.</p><p>“So, there are many expert otherworldly beings searching for them. Bringing them out is like snatching food from a tiger’s mouth! Have you noticed any signs of other forces getting involved?”</p><p>Seeing Su Nu shake her head, Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief. They only need to face the otherworldly beings; the pressure is much less. In this situation, they don't need to worry about Mahayana cultivators. If the otherworldly beings sent out a Saint Realm cultivator, those two would have already been captured.</p><p>“You must have a plan and have already discovered their whereabouts? Is there a way to take them away secretly before other otherworldly beings act?”</p><p>Qin Sang knew that with Su Nu’s intelligence, she must have a plan before summoning him urgently.</p><p>As long as they don't encounter a Saint Realm cultivator from the otherworldly beings, Qin Sang was confident that even if they couldn't win, they could easily escape. But the otherworldly beings' abilities are unpredictable and hard to guard against, so it's best to avoid conflict.</p><p>“It’s very difficult! I’ve been watching those otherworldly beings. From their actions, I've seen some clues, judging that the two people's whereabouts may have been discovered, and there must be otherworldly experts watching them. It’s impossible to bring them out silently.  In fact, if the otherworldly beings weren't worried about other forces interfering, and hadn’t avoided large-scale searches, we wouldn't have any loopholes to exploit.”</p><p>Su Nu's expression was serious. She continued, “Even if we contact them in advance, it's hard to gain their trust. It’s better to appear when they're in danger, then they'll have no choice but to leave with us. Before, I couldn't take the risk alone. Now that Qin Xiong is here, we can give it a try.</p><p>Qin Sang was silent for a moment, then asked, "Where are they hiding now?"</p><p>"Hai Tang Academy," Su Nu replied.</p><p>"Hai Tang Academy?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, recalling hearing the name on the journey.  It had a certain reputation.</p><p>"Hai Tang Academy is a powerful force in Lan Sha Prefecture, unlike other factions. It's a sect, but also an academy that teaches and instructs the people.  It's quite famous, but not for its strength."</p><p>Su Nu seemed to remember something amusing and chuckled.  "As the name suggests, Hai Tang Academy emphasizes classics and propriety, believing that a world where everyone behaves with proper etiquette and everything follows the rules is the ideal state. They believe that 'man is born evil.'  To manage the common people, they should be guided to read, to become gentlemen.  Reading countless books teaches propriety, honor, and shame, suppressing evil thoughts and aggression. That's why it's called an academy."</p><p>"Because of this, everything within Hai Tang Academy is strictly regulated, especially for outsiders. They call outsiders 'external poisons,' believing that if they are allowed to enter without restriction, it will pollute the virtuous, corrupting the atmosphere and undermining the academy's foundation.  Therefore, outsiders need permission to enter and must always abide by the academy's rules.  Violation will result in expulsion, or even punishment."</p><p>"That's why Hai Tang Academy issues Four Gentleman Tokens. Outsiders must hold a token to enter."</p><p>"There are four types of tokens: Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, and Chrysanthemum. Different tokens grant access to different places and activities. The Plum token is the highest rank; the Chrysanthemum, the lowest."</p><p>"Only those recognized by Hai Tang Academy receive these tokens.  If their actions don't meet the academy's standards, the token is immediately revoked.  They don't believe in universal education. They believe that humankind is superior to all beings and that other races are no different from beasts. Therefore, tokens are rarely given to non-human races.  Those two somehow managed to hide in the academy, preventing that group of non-human pursuers from acting rashly…"</p><p>The rules of Hai Tang Academy sounded strange, but after learning about the Great Way, Qin Sang didn't find them unusual.</p><p>"So, it won't be easy for us to enter Hai Tang Academy to find them?"</p><p>Su Nu nodded. "Even those recognized as gentlemen by the academy only receive a Chrysanthemum token upon first contact.  They must then pass tests, gradually rising in rank until, without any flaws, they are granted the highest Plum token. However, there are ways around this. I've made some friends over the years. For a price, we might be able to obtain a Bamboo token. That's why I'm staying in the Turbulent Wave Sea – for convenience."</p><p>The Bamboo token was the third rank, granting access to a larger area than the Chrysanthemum token, but Su Nu's tone suggested it wasn't enough.</p><p>"Those two are hiding outside the Bamboo token's area?"</p><p>Qin Sang knew that the academy had the means to enforce its rules and prevent outsiders from crossing boundaries.</p><p>"Yes, we'll have to take some risks."</p><p>Su Nu looked at Qin Sang. She had laid out all the pros and cons; it was up to him.</p><p>These non-human pursuers were rare. Missing this chance would mean contacting the Water Tribe non-humans first and then changing guides, causing many more problems.</p><p>Su Nu dared to take such a risk because she had seen Qin Sang battle the Second Palace Master of Li Yu Palace, knowing his power was unfathomable. Otherwise, she wouldn't have dared.</p><p>After Su Nu finished speaking, Qin Sang fell into thought.</p><p>The pursuing non-human force was strong, but not enough to make him back down.  But before acting, better preparation was necessary.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang had an idea.  "I might be able to get a higher-ranked token."</p><p>Su Nu was surprised. The higher the rank, the harder it was to obtain. After years of investigation in Lan Sha Prefecture, she could only get a Bamboo token. She wondered how Qin Sang could do it.</p><p>Qin Sang stood up. "I'm not completely sure, but it's worth a try. We'll get a Bamboo token as well. What do you need me to do?"</p><p>Qin Sang's words showed his resolve.</p><p>"I don't need help right now; I've prepared everything," Su Nu stood up to see him off.  "I'll await Qin Xiong's good news!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, without hesitation, left the marketplace, and disappeared in a flash of sword light.</p><p>Passing through the immortal city where Gu Ya and Jian Nu were, Qin Sang summoned them, pointing out a location. Su Nu had already planned an escape route. If they succeeded, they would hide there, avoiding the non-human pursuers.</p><p>Gu Ya and Jian Nu couldn't help in the main task; they would wait there beforehand.</p><p>After the instructions, Qin Sang flew out of the Turbulent Wave Sea and took out Song Feng Jushi's letter. It was to be delivered to a cultivator named Xuan Xiang, whose backing was an organization called Liu Nian Xiao Xuan.</p><p>Qin Sang had already investigated.  While Liu Nian Xiaoxuan wasn't exactly famous throughout Lansha Prefecture, its influence was comparable to that of Liu Zhou Tang in Zhongzhou.  The success of this mission now depended on the clout of Qian Die Shen Que and Song Feng Jushi.</p><p>…</p><p>You Nan Island.</p><p>This island, isolated in the vast ocean, was surrounded by hundreds of miles of open sea with no other large islands nearby, yet it thrived with activity.  Beams of light constantly appeared and disappeared, indicating arrivals and departures.  A large and prosperous immortal city dominated the island.</p><p>Qin Sang retracted his escaping light ahead of time, mounting a white cloud and slowly approaching, confirming the address from the letter.</p><p>Entering the city, Qin Sang quickly located Liu Nian Xiaoxuan.</p><p>From the outside, Liu Nian Xiaoxuan resembled a place for tea and meditation, devoid of any commercial atmosphere.</p><p>A beautiful and elegant young woman gracefully approached and inquired politely.</p><p>Qin Sang stated his purpose directly, "I have been entrusted with a letter for Daoist Xuanxiang of your establishment.  Is Daoist Xuanxiang available?"</p><p>The young woman's smile faded as she bowed, "Please, senior, follow me to the guest hall. I will immediately inform my superiors."</p><p>Qin Sang was led to the guest hall. Before he had finished a cup of spiritual tea, a middle-aged cultivator arrived hastily.</p><p>"Are you Daoist Xuanxiang?" Qin Sang rose and bowed.</p><p>"Indeed!  May I ask your Daoist name?" Xuanxiang returned the bow. "And which Daoist sent the letter?"</p><p>"My surname is Qin.  I am an honored guest elder of the Five Elements Alliance.  Before coming to Lansha Prefecture, I was commissioned by Song Feng Jushi. The letter is here, please examine it."</p><p>Qin Sang presented the letter.</p><p>"Elder Qin!  My apologies!"</p><p>Xuanxiang's expression grew more serious.  He apologized and checked the letter's restrictions. "It is indeed from Song Feng Jushi."</p><p>Qin Sang sat down and calmly sipped his tea.</p><p>After reading the letter, Xuanxiang put it away and looked at Qin Sang. "I understand the matter Song Feng Jushi mentioned. I will send someone to him shortly.  Thank you, Elder Qin, for traveling so far to deliver the letter."</p><p>"It was nothing," Qin Sang replied indifferently.</p><p>But Xuanxiang didn't see it that way.  Previously, any instructions from Song Feng Jushi were communicated verbally.  This time, sending a special messenger clearly held a deeper meaning, which he understood.</p><p>Moreover, the status of an honored guest elder of the Five Elements Alliance was enough to warrant his attention.</p><p>"Song Feng Jushi's friends are my friends. Elder Qin came all the way to Lansha Prefecture, you must have important business. Please feel free to tell me what I can do to help."</p><p>Unexpectedly, he was so straightforward and got to the point. Qin Sang hesitated.</p><p>Seeing this, Xuanxiang said, "Our establishment faced a crisis some time ago, and it was thanks to Qian Die Shen Que that we survived. Elder Qin, please do not hesitate."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang did not delay. He explained his background, believing that with Liu Nian Xiaoxuan's influence, obtaining a Junzi Ling should not be difficult.</p><p>"Junzi Ling?"</p><p>Xuanxiang frowned. "Bamboo and Chrysanthemum orders are not a problem, however…  Are you looking for a specific spiritual object? We may have some in our collection."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed, apologetically saying, "This concerns a personal secret of mine, and I cannot divulge it."</p><p>Xuanxiang understood and stopped questioning. He pondered, "Elder Qin, you may not know, but only a few people in Lansha Prefecture are eligible for a Mei Ling. At most, I can obtain a temporary Lan Ling for you."</p><p>"Temporary?" Qin Sang frowned.</p><p>Xuanxiang nodded. "It means asking a Lan Ling holder to vouch for you. It will last for a month at most.  Any infraction during that time will result in harsher penalties.  You must remember to leave before the time limit ends."</p><p>Hearing a hidden meaning in Xuanxiang's words, Qin Sang's heart stirred, and he asked, "If I inadvertently break the rules, will it implicate you?"</p><p>Xuanxiang smiled confidently. "Unless Elder Qin openly attacks the academy! It's just a guarantee.  Hai Tang Academy has so many rules, who can guarantee they won't break any? It's just a matter of paperwork. My position is not so easily shaken."</p><p>Qin Sang rose and bowed.  "Then I will trouble you, Daoist. I will be very careful!" </p>
