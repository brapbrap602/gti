Chapter 354: Legend


“Fellow Daoist Qin becoming a senior disciple of Mount Shao Hua, and possessing such high cultivation, without your future being delayed by my momentary oversight… I am finally somewhat relieved…”
Master Han’s face showed shame, as if remembering something, he asked, “After my recovery from injury, worried about Fellow Daoist Qin, I sent people to the vicinity of the You Mountain range, but failed to find you.  All these years, I haven't received any news from you.  Have you been in seclusion at Mount Shao Hua all this time?”


Qin Sang replied, “After joining Mount Shao Hua and breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage, I went to the Ancient Immortal Battlefield to hone my skills. This time, I am returning from the Ancient Immortal Battlefield, passing through You Mountain Market. Reuniting with Fellow Daoist Han is an unexpected joy. As far as I know, the You Mountain range is a lawless place. Fellow Daoist Han, bringing clan experts here, does the Pure Yang Sect intend to exploit this area?”


“Not exactly.”


Master Han shook his head, “Fellow Daoist Qin, as a disciple of Mount Shao Hua, you should know that the border of the Little Cold Region is currently unstable.  The Sky Walking League is stirring, and major sects are all preparing for war. At this critical juncture, many demonic cultivators are frequently crossing the border, trying to take advantage of the chaos. The sect ordered us disciples to eliminate the demonic presence as a warning. The Han family, along with several other families, were assigned to the vicinity of the You Mountain range…”


Qin Sang then realized that Master Han was not only the head of the Han family, but also a direct disciple of a Golden Core cultivator of the Pure Yang Sect after his Foundation Establishment breakthrough, holding a high position within the Sect.


“The Sky Walking League is really going to launch a large-scale attack? How dire is the current situation?” Qin Sang’s heart sank, and he quickly pressed for details.


Once a major war began, the Yun Cang Marsh would inevitably become a battlefield, with Mount Shao Hua bearing the brunt!


Master Han said, “Fellow Daoist Qin, don’t worry. It's said that the atmosphere in the Yun Cang Marsh is indeed tense, but there are no signs of a major war yet. At least, we need to wait for the spiritual tide to truly arrive before we can see clearly. Moreover, the number of Nascent Soul cultivators in the Little Cold Region today is the highest in thousands of years, at its peak. Before the Sky Walking League acts, they will have to weigh their capabilities!”


Qin Sang nodded.


Master Han was right; the Little Cold Region's current strength was indeed formidable.


However, there were also rumors that not every Nascent Soul cultivator possessed the combat power of a Nascent Soul, and the secrets behind this were not something they could fathom.


During their conversation, Qin Sang noticed that the flying boat wasn’t heading towards the Great Sui Dynasty, and curiously asked, “Isn't the Han Family Fort near the Great Sui?”


Previously, Qin Sang only knew that the Pure Yang Sect had a Han family under its command, but the geographical map didn’t show the specific location of the Han Family Fort.


Master Han smiled and said, “It was some distance from the Great Sui before, but now it's within the Great Sui's territory.”


“Oh? Did something change over the years?”


Qin Sang was surprised, vaguely guessing something.


Master Han hummed, patiently explaining to Qin Sang.


“Because of the great contributions of our ancestors, after the ancestor founded the Han family, the sect allocated the region containing several mortal nations, including the current Great Sui, to the Han family.


“Originally, our ancestor believed that mortals were ignorant, so he dispatched family members to establish and govern these nations.


“Unexpectedly, these descendants not only lacked the ability to govern, but also, relying on their cultivator status, acted recklessly, indulged in pleasure, lost their Dao heart, creating chaos and resentment among the populace.


“Our ancestor, after reflecting deeply, decided to use mortals to govern the mortal realm!


“All family members returned to the Han Family Fort to cultivate, and loose cultivators within the territory were also restrained, not allowed to reveal their cultivation easily, much less interfere with the mortal world's affairs.


“Of course, cultivator methods are mysterious and unpredictable, and some things are still difficult to eradicate, but after the rules were established, the interference did lessen significantly.


“Since then, the mortal world has been allowed to develop freely, with talented and virtuous people taking charge. Although there have been ups and downs, and wars often occurred, it has surprisingly become increasingly prosperous.


“We, the Han family, only need to receive tributes from the emperor and, without interfering with the mortal world's operation, bestow a few pills and intervene in situations like plagues or natural disasters beyond mortal capabilities. It's effortless and efficient.


“Seeing its effectiveness, other families followed suit.  Today, the mortal realms under the Sect's control are mostly like this…”


Upon hearing this, Qin Sang felt a chill down his spine. Fortunately, he had been low-key in the past, only acting as a spy, and never recklessly used the Yama King in battle, especially during the attack on the imperial capital, where he remained hidden.


Otherwise, he might have been caught and executed by the Han family.


Unaware of Qin Sang’s thoughts, Master Han continued, “Our ancestor's decision was indeed wise. In recent years, outstanding figures have emerged in the mortal world, and some of their talents have even made us cultivators sigh in admiration.


“However, few can compare to the Great Sui Empress!


“General Qin served under the Empress; you must have some understanding of her, right?


“During her lifetime, the Empress, as a woman, performed astonishing feats, launching a coup d'état.”


His father had barely ascended the throne when he was deposed by the Empress, becoming the retired Emperor.  The Han family debated the impropriety of the situation at the time, but ultimately decided against intervention and acknowledged her reign.

Unexpectedly, the Empress, upon her ascension, displayed extraordinary talent.  Internally, she selected capable officials and fostered national strength. Externally, she skillfully forged alliances.  When the time was right, she launched a war with devastating speed.

With the might of the Sui Dynasty, she won victory after victory, conquering several nations in just one year.

Now, the Sui Dynasty’s territory rivals that of Heng. Under her rule, it flourishes daily.

The Empress, a true paragon of virtue, excelled in both civil administration and military conquest, making her a truly great ruler!

"Friend Qin… Friend Qin…"

The Han family head, filled with admiration for the Empress, noticed Qin Sang seemed distracted. "Friend Qin, what are you thinking?"

"Oh? Nothing! Nothing!"

Qin Sang snapped back to attention, quickly shaking her head to cover her thoughts. After a slight cough, she couldn't help but ask, "The Empress was indeed a remarkable person! But you said 'before her death,'  meaning she has passed away?"

The Han family head nodded.

"The Empress was, after all, mortal.  Moreover, with the Sui Dynasty's power, expanding its territory and creating such an unparalleled legacy, every step was fraught with peril, with the constant risk of utter ruin…

"It was like she was dancing on a tightrope, working tirelessly day and night, exhausted both mentally and physically.  Although the Han family provided several restorative elixirs, it was to no avail.

"However, she lived a magnificent life, one that even we cultivators admire.  She truly lived a full life.

"Compared to her, many cultivators are merely decaying wood living a few extra years!"

As Qin Sang listened to the Han family head, her mind wandered.

The East Yang Princess, the Princess Royal, the Empress…

One could say Qin Sang watched her rise to power step by step.

Qin Sang had long known of her ambition.  The night before her departure, she also knew she was preparing to gamble everything, acting as bait to lure the Crown Prince into the open, giving her one last chance.

Unexpectedly, her conviction never faltered.

She became a legend.
