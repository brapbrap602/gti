<h1>Chapter 1889: Fear of Death?</h1><p>Chapter 1889: Fear of Death?</p><p>‘Swish!’</p><p>Qin Sang had just set up the twelve Demon Banners formation, his True Qi and divine sense draining at an alarming rate.  The Three Lights Jade Liquid still had some potency left, continuously replenishing his True Qi, but he had to use a different spirit herb to restore his divine sense.</p><p>Qin Sang drank down the Soul Cleansing Liquid he'd been holding. This substance could increase the chances of forming a Nascent Soul, and when refined using the secret technique Ming Wei had passed on to him, it significantly enhanced his divine sense. Now, it could only be used to replenish his depleted divine sense. Fortunately, it didn't affect its efficacy in aiding Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>Pure soul energy replenished his divine sense, but far from keeping pace with its depletion. The Demon Banner formation was becoming difficult to maintain.</p><p>"We have Soul Cleansing Liquid too."</p><p>A weak voice came from beside him.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced sideways. The boy, somehow awake, was struggling to speak. His face was pale as paper; he lay on the ground, unable to move, only able to direct his gaze towards his and the girl's pouches.</p><p>Without needing the boy to say more, Qin Sang had already guessed this. He had sensed the strong connection between the boy, the girl and the Four Saints Palace. Considering the trial realm was created by the Four Saints and the unusual appearance of the Soul Cleansing Liquid, he had a pretty good idea what had happened.</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang grabbed their pouches, taking two bottles of Soul Cleansing Liquid, and immediately drank one.</p><p>The twelve Demon Banners, when formed into an array, were comparable in power to a top-grade magic treasure.  It wasn't that Qin Sang didn't want to set up the full eighteen-banner formation, but he sensed it was his limit, only achievable with the help of the Demon Fire Seed.  Summoning more Nine Netherworld Demon Fire would put it beyond his control.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi suddenly stopped Qin Sang. He was about to inform the Demon Lord and Nan Gui Xianzi, when he sensed a thought from the Qingzhu's main body.</p><p>The ancient demon's soul fragment, having forcefully used the  'Severing Yuan and Spirit' technique, had suffered damage.  Qingzhu had finally found a weakness and managed to make a difficult connection with the outside, seeking help.</p><p>Upon hearing this, a look of intense joy appeared in Ling Zhuzi's eyes. His lips moved silently as he performed some type of blood refinement technique, then spat out a mouthful of essence blood onto his whisk.</p><p>The whisk, imbued with the blood, transformed into a blood-red whisk.  As it danced, it resembled strands of blood-red hair, incredibly eerie.  Ling Zhuzi's hair instantly turned completely white, his life force draining, his face becoming deeply wrinkled, and he aged several times over.</p><p>Meanwhile, elsewhere…</p><p>The Demon Lord, held captive by the ancient demon's soul fragment, did not give up.  In this moment of crisis, the Yin Ghost Divine Light reappeared. Thousands of evil ghosts swarmed onto the Demon Lord, greedily devouring his essence.  One side of his body visibly shriveled, becoming withered and dry, clinging to his bones like a skeleton.  The same thing happened to his Nascent Soul.</p><p>‘Bang!’</p><p>The Yin Ghost Divine Light suddenly shattered.  The thousands of evil ghosts were simultaneously sacrificed by the Demon Lord, breaking the shackles and freeing him from the ancient demon's soul fragment's control.</p><p>Nan Gui Xianzi, having forcibly increased her cultivation through the Sacrificial Yuan Technique and endured consecutive battles, with her soul severely damaged, was completely exhausted.  Knowing she had no chance of survival, she sighed softly, closed her eyes, ceased resisting, and released her Nascent Soul, willingly colliding with the ancient demon's soul fragment.</p><p>The three human experts all chose a desperate fight. They attacked simultaneously.</p><p>The blood whisk transformed into a river of blood, joining Nan Gui Xianzi's Nascent Soul almost at the same moment.  The self-destructing Yin Ghosts frantically attacked the ancient demon's soul fragment.</p><p>The ancient demon's soul fragment, who thought victory was already his, was unwilling to fight to the death. As he saw this, he resisted with all his demonic Qi, while retreating to avoid the attack.  Simultaneously, he swung his hand, unleashing three chains. One ensnared Nan Gui Xianzi, who was about to self-destruct, and dragged her into the blood coffin. The other two were aimed at Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord.</p><p>"Grandmaster!"</p><p>The boy cried out in grief.</p><p>The girl, also awake, embraced him and wept, watching helplessly as their beloved master was brutally killed, themselves too weak and injured to do anything.  They regretted their lax cultivation in the past.</p><p>"What are you doing!"</p><p>A roar drowned out their cries.</p><p>The ancient demon's soul fragment had been forced back, close to the blood coffin and the sword energy. He was about to capture the Demon Lord and Ling Zhuzi, when he sensed another change in Qingzhu's true soul within him.  This time it was different from before.</p><p>A shard of the spiritual sword glowed with an unusual light, its emanations causing the ancient demon's fragment of a soul to feel a sharp pain.</p><p>Even more shocking and enraging to the demon's soul fragment was that a wisp of sword intent within the sword energy seemed to resonate with the shard, creating a powerful harmonic vibration.</p><p>In an instant, the demon's soul fragment understood Qingzhu's plan.  The shard and the sword energy of Yitian Peak were deeply connected. Qingzhu was manipulating the shard to draw the sword intent into his body, aiming to kill the demon.</p><p>Qingzhu could only draw the sword energy into himself; he lacked the ability to control such potent energy. This act was tantamount to suicide, a mutual destruction with the demon's soul fragment.</p><p>"You're playing with fire!"</p><p>The demon's soul fragment roared. "Stop! I'll spare your life!"</p><p>"Death holds no fear!"</p><p>Qingzhu finally spoke, his tone calm and unwavering. He was willing to die with the demon's soul fragment, rather than release it to wreak havoc upon the world.</p><p>As he'd said before: "I have no desire to shoulder the burden of all under heaven, but this catastrophe must not begin because of me!"</p><p>If he hadn't sealed the demon soul in Yitian Peak, things might not have come to this.</p><p>The sword energy vibrated slightly, a strand of intent activated, striking towards the back of Qingzhu's head.</p><p>The demon's soul fragment was terrified.</p><p>A surge of demonic energy washed over Qingzhu's face, distorting his features. The demon's soul fragment attempted to break free from Qingzhu's body, seeking escape.</p><p>It had another vessel outside, an agreement had been made with its main body; it did not want to die here.</p><p>"Now!"</p><p>Lingzhuzi urged loudly.</p><p>Qin Sang, already poised, eyes gleaming, suddenly unleashed the Nine Netherworld Demon Fire, aiming straight for the demon's soul fragment.</p><p>His true essence and spiritual awareness were instantly depleted; he collapsed.</p><p>The demon fire shot out like an arrow, swift as a falling star.</p><p>"Nine Netherworld Demon Fire!"</p><p>The demon's soul fragment never expected anyone else to wield such an attack.  Demon fire inherently countered souls, and caught off guard, the collision of demonic energy and demon fire hindered the soul fragment's escape.</p><p>That brief moment of hesitation was enough to change everything.</p><p>The invisible sword intent entered Qingzhu's body.</p><p>A scream of excruciating pain, enough to make one's hair stand on end, echoed from within Qingzhu, originating from the demon's soul fragment.</p><p>Qingzhu froze, a sword mark appearing on his forehead. Blood flowed from his seven orifices, his breath rapidly fading.</p><p>Lingzhuzi and the Demon Lord tumbled to the ground, narrowly avoiding being thrown into the blood coffin.</p><p>They saw each other's dire state, their hearts filled with bitterness.</p><p>The main demonic body, enraged, seized the opportunity while the sword energy was affecting Qingzhu, and frantically manipulated the blood coffin to force its way upwards.  However, with the three ancient tribal prohibitions fully restored, they were all activated by the sword energy.</p><p>As the Demon Suppressing Stele, the Dragon Corpse, and the Divine Furnace – the three treasures of demon suppression – unleashed their full power, the sealing force intensified.</p><p>The bloody light dimmed, the main demonic body's counterattack growing weaker.</p><p>The blood coffin shook violently, overwhelmed by the sword energy, unable to resist, and plunged into the bottomless abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang, having somewhat recovered, saw Qingzhu standing motionless, a sudden alarm flooding his heart.  He quickly put away his demon banner and dashed over.</p>
