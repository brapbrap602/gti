<h1>Chapter 147: Spirit Thread</h1><p>On the desolate island, six large banners fluttered in the wind. Billows of black vapor surging from the banners enveloped the entire island. Gloomy clouds filled the sky, obscuring the bright moon and preventing moonlight from filtering through. The island was plunged into darkness.</p><p>An eerie wind howled, scattering black vapor tinged with a faint blue light. Countless ghostly figures appeared amidst the vapor, their mournful cries rising far louder than they had when Qin Sang fought Gu Tiannan in Gu Yuan Nation.</p><p>Fortunately, the island was deep within the Cloud Mist Marsh, far from any habitation. No other cultivators were nearby. Otherwise, the sight would have made them believe that a powerful demon had come to wreak havoc.</p><p>To the naked eye, only thick black mist was visible, but cultivators could discern countless black thread-like strands squirming within the mist, layer upon layer, like a tangled mess of hair. A faint blue flame flickered along the strands, emitting a ghostly chill that made one's scalp crawl.</p><p>These strands were Spirit Threads formed from the ghostly energy of the Ten Kings Infernal Banners. If a cultivator were to be trapped by the Spirit Threads, the ghostly flame would invade their body, followed by evil spirits. Without a means to protect their Soul Essence, their Soul Essence would be damaged.</p><p>Weaker cultivators might even have their souls torn apart by the Spirit Threads and devoured by the evil spirits within the banners. The technique was extremely malevolent.</p><p>This was the true power of the Ten Kings Infernal Formation. Trapping people was a minor matter. The real killing move was the ability to damage the Soul Essence.</p><p>When he was at the Qi Refining Stage, Qin Sang's strength was insufficient to unleash the full power of the grand formation. He could not control the ghostly flame on the Spirit Threads and could only clumsily use evil spirits to engage in melee combat. Now, he could control these six Spectral Banners as he pleased.</p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar erupted from within the grand formation, resonating with the strength of thunder that shook the heavens.</p><p>The ghost energy fluctuated violently, and the edges of the formation began to dissipate slightly. Immediately following, a towering wave surged up from the center of the formation and crashed down on the layers of Spirit Threads.</p><p>'Crash!'</p><p>The giant wave slammed down with a deafening roar.</p><p>The desolate island trembled. The banners of the six Ten Kings Infernal Banners fluttered violently in the hurricane-force wind, straining to their limits as they let out a loud whistling sound.</p><p>Wherever the water wave struck, the Spirit Threads shattered into countless fragments that drifted down to the ground. However, in the next moment, they fused together again, forming new Spirit Threads that connected with the undamaged Spirit Threads and merged back into the grand formation, rolling toward the depths of the formation like drifting snow.</p><p>The aftermath of the giant wave surged toward Qin Sang, but its power had weakened. The instant it reached Qin Sang, light flickered around his body, revealing a protective barrier that deflected the water wave. He had secretly activated the power of the Starry Tear.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the aftermath of the giant wave dissipated, several water arrows shot out from the water without warning.</p><p>'Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh...'</p><p>Qin Sang did not dare to withstand the water arrows with the Starry Tear. His figure moved rapidly, dodging the water arrows one after another.</p><p>He did not expect this monster beast to learn the art of misdirection. Qin Sang sighed inwardly and looked up at the center of the formation.</p><p>He saw that the Silver Rhinoceros Demon Beast was wrapped in a layer of water membrane that could defend against the Spirit Threads and the Soul Devouring Evil Spirits.</p><p>The Spirit Threads that wrapped around it were blocked by the water membrane. Only a few managed to penetrate and enter the Silver Rhinoceros Demon Beast's body, causing the demon beast's Soul Essence to ache and its fury to soar, but it was difficult to seriously injure it.</p><p>Even the main spirits of the several Spectral Banners were unable to break into the Silver Rhinoceros Demon Beast's body after repeated attempts.</p><p>If the Ten Kings Infernal Banners had devoured enough souls and blood essence and reached their full power, countless evil spirits would have emerged from the formation and devoured the Silver Rhinoceros Demon Beast's soul and body. The demon beast's fate would have been far more miserable than it was now.</p><p>Although the Silver Rhinoceros Demon Beast's Soul Essence was repeatedly injured by the Spirit Threads, the injuries were not severe and it could withstand them. Its huge beastly eyes glared at Qin Sang, their pupils filled with extreme anger. A layer of blood gradually spread across them, turning the entire eyes blood-red. Clearly, it had fallen into a state of berserk rage.</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Silver Rhinoceros Demon Beast let out a furious roar. Blue light flashed on its horn, and a circular water wave spread out around it. It did not seem powerful, but the Spirit Threads that were wrapped around it shattered inch by inch when they were struck by the water wave.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the Silver Rhinoceros Demon Beast lunged forward several feet with its front hooves. The Spirit Threads were only able to wrap around it again after it had moved.</p><p>As the one-horned rhinoceros was encouraged by the sweet taste of the kill, it attempted to deploy the same tactic again. However, Qin Sang knit his brows slightly and, after coming to the conclusion that ensnaring it with the Soul’s Thread alone would not suffice for its capture, he combined all six of the main souls into one body, which transformed into an evil spirit.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The one-horned rhinoceros’s massive body resembled a small mountain, making the evil spirit appear weak. Regardless, in spite of the formidable collision, the evil spirit did not avoid the attack but instead wrapped itself around the rhinoceros, ensnaring it.</p><p>Once Qin Sang witnessed this sight, he could make a judgment. This one-horned rhinoceros must have only recently broken through the Spirit Demon Stage. The strong water arrows that were shot from its horn were incredibly powerful, and its water control abilities were excellent. However, its actual capabilities were not particularly formidable. It likely had not been able to find a suitable cave dwelling, which was probably why it was so resolute about obtaining the spirit eye of the spirit stone mine.</p><p>Finally, with this development, the situation stabilized. While the one-horned rhinoceros was entangled with the evil spirit, a sword ray flashed across Qin Sang’s forehead, and the ebony sword that he had been storing and cultivating within his primordial spirit flew out.</p><p>Qin Sang was aware of the purpose of his current mission. Whether or not he was able to kill this one-horned rhinoceros was unimportant. His main priorities were to gain comprehension of the Dao of Slaughter and train his cultivation techniques.</p><p>As Qin Sang’s thoughts stirred, the ebony sword transformed into a blood-red sword, its sword energy as radiant as a rainbow. The sword disappeared and reappeared in the array in a flash, above the head of the rhinoceros, where sword energy suddenly erupted.</p><p>The one-horned rhinoceros was also quite vigilant. The moment that the ebony sword appeared, it was alerted and hastily shook its head to push the evil spirit away, then aimed its horn at the ebony sword and rapidly shot out several water arrows.</p><p>The ebony sword turned into a streaming light. Although it completely destroyed the water arrows, it also gave the one-horned rhinoceros time to dodge, resulting in an unsuccessful strike and an empty attack.</p><p>In the brief confrontation, Qin Sang’s expression remained undisturbed. His mind was filled with doubt. Did this not help him comprehend the Dao of Slaughter?</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Qin Sang boldly chose to attempt to observe the Kill Symbol during the actual battle. As a result, the murderous intent that filled his chest did not cloud his mind, but instead caused his eyes to appear unusually cold as he gazed at the rhinoceros with the same indifference as he might a corpse.</p><p>The ebony sword let out a long, sorrowful wail, and its blood-red sword energy proliferated. It pointed straight at the one-horned rhinoceros with absolute murderous intent.</p><p>A hint of fear flashed across the rhinoceros’s eyes, but it quickly shook its head to free itself from the influence of the murderous intent. It glared fiercely at the ebony sword and began roaring furiously.</p><p>At the same time, the circular water waves appeared on its horn once again. However, unlike before, the waves immediately condensed into a sharp blade and hurtled toward the ebony sword.</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze was solely fixated upon the rhinoceros. In order to prevent it from escaping the Ten Yama Array, he ordered the evil spirit to obstruct its path, then completely connected his mind with the ebony sword.</p><p>At that moment, it was as though he had become an incarnation of the sword itself, capable of cutting down all enemies in the world!</p>
