<h1>Chapter 398: The Division of Magical Treasures</h1><p>Thinking of magical treasures, Qin Sang took Yu Hua's pouch.</p><p>Yu Hua's Ten Directions Yama Formation had been destroyed by Qin Sang, but the treasures themselves were unharmed.</p><p>Qin Sang now possessed two identical magical treasures, both originating from the same source.</p><p>From Yu Hua, he learned that before his death, the ancestor Kui Yin had passed down five Ten Directions Yama Banners, giving one to each of his five disciples.</p><p>When Kui Yin Sect was destroyed, Jiu Pao Dao Ren and another Golden Core cultivator each had one, while the whereabouts of a third remained unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang knew it had been taken by Sun De, who infiltrated Mount Shao Hua with it.</p><p>Yi Tian Nie possessed two of these treasures. He kept one and gave the other to Zhao Yan to steal the Nine Illusion Sky Orchid; it eventually fell into Yu Hua’s hands, eventually winding its way back to Qin Sang.</p><p>On the night of the catastrophe, Yi Tian Nie and another Golden Core cultivator were killed. If their Ten Directions Yama Banners weren't destroyed, they should be in the hands of the Yuan Zhao Sect.</p><p>Yu Hua witnessed Yuan Zhao Sect’s leader self-destructing, destroying Jiu Pao Dao Ren's lifebound treasure in the process. Jiu Pao Dao Ren only escaped thanks to the Ten Directions Yama Banner, but even that was badly damaged.</p><p>After that, Jiu Pao Dao Ren was repeatedly hunted, his physical body was severed and his Golden Core badly injured; the probability of his treasure being destroyed is high.</p><p>Even if not destroyed, repairing it would be incredibly difficult, no easier than healing his own injuries. Otherwise, the Kui Yin Sect would have long since recovered all ten Yama Banners and restored the ancestor Kui Yin's reputation.</p><p>Currently, Qin Sang possesses two of the five Ten Directions Yama Banners, Yuan Zhao Sect has two in their possession, and Jiu Pao Dao Ren has one.</p><p>The Ten Directions Yama Banners were the culmination of the ancestor Kui Yin's life's work. Legend has it that when all ten are gathered and used to form a demonic formation, their power rivals that of top-grade treasures, even potentially capable of contending with top-tier treasures.</p><p>Golden Core cultivators usually use magical artifacts, talisman treasures or low-grade treasures. Only those with significant wealth or exceptional luck obtain a mid-grade treasure; those possessing a high-grade treasure are few and far between.</p><p>High-grade and top-tier treasures are treasures only owned by Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>In the Xiaohan Region, top-tier treasures are extremely rare.</p><p>This treasure was the source of the ancestor Kui Yin's formidable reputation, which instilled fear into the cultivators of the Xiaohan Region. Sadly, his legacy died with him.</p><p>Even a single Ten Directions Yama Banner is among the best of low-grade treasures.</p><p>Holding his two Ten Directions Yama Banners, Qin Sang pondered whether, like magical artifacts, they need all six to be present for cooperative use to form the demonic formation.</p><p>Yu Hua was unsure.</p><p>It seems I need to break through to the Golden Core stage to verify this.</p><p>Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Those main souls consumed most of his essence; lifting even one treasure required immense effort, so simultaneously activating two is impossible.</p><p>Putting the treasures away, Qin Sang continued to search the pouch.</p><p>In the end, he found only three noteworthy top-grade artifacts.</p><p>One, resembling a vajra, was twisted into a mess and completely ruined, beyond repair.</p><p>The deep imprint of a palm on the vajra clearly shows it was the work of the Flying Sky Yaksha.</p><p>Another, called the Myriad Crows Flask, Qin Sang initially thought it had some special function.  After refining it, he discovered it was a defensive artifact.</p><p>The flask releases billowing smoke that transforms into thousands of crows, forming a defensive array that moves according to the owner's will, flexible yet powerful, endlessly changing.</p><p>Its power surpasses the Seven-Colored Parasol, and its manipulation is effortless, making it highly useful.</p><p>However, the flask is currently low on smoke; it was probably depleted while resisting the Flying Sky Yaksha and needs time to replenish.</p><p>Finally, there was a flying sword. Qin Sang held it in his palm for a closer inspection.</p><p>The sword bears a palm print with lingering corpse poison, another remnant of the Flying Sky Yaksha. There are several cracks in the middle of the blade, but fortunately, it's not broken and can be repaired.</p><p>When my alchemy skills improve, I can use it for practice.</p><p>The Flying Sky Yaksha's body was truly terrifying!</p><p>Qin Sang put away the artifacts and muttered to himself.  </p><p>Just from what Qin Sang knew, Yu Hua lost at least three top-grade artifacts to the Flying Sky Yaksha: a protective mirror, the vajra, and the flying sword.</p><p>The Flying Sky Yaksha's body, refined by corpse pills and earth-sha energy, far surpasses ordinary artifacts in hardness and should no longer be considered merely flesh and blood.</p><p>However, I don’t want to follow the corpse path, to become a cultivator of corpses, and don’t dare to use the earth-sha energy to refine my body, quite the opposite I will avoid it.  If I had such a powerful body, I could go anywhere, couldn't I?</p><p>He continued searching but found no talisman treasures.</p><p>Qin Sang wasn't discouraged.  He needed time to prepare, anyway. The power of the Ten Directions Yama Formation and his magical artifacts far surpassed talismans, and he didn't have to worry about depleting their power.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang took out two jade bottles, a look of surprise in his eyes.</p><p>They were two bottles of Li Long Pills!</p><p>Li Long Pills had a similar effect to Gathering Qi Pills, but their efficacy was far superior. They were top-grade foundation-building pills.</p><p>No wonder Yu Hua's cultivation progressed so quickly.</p><p>Qin Sang left the Yuanzhao Sect at twenty-five, and is now seventy-two—less than fifty years.</p><p>Yu Hua's talent wasn't particularly good; otherwise, he wouldn't have broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage so late in life.  And he betrayed his sect and acted as an inside man for the Demon Sect to achieve it.</p><p>In fifty years, Yu Hua went from newly achieving Foundation Establishment to the False Core stage.  That's remarkably fast in the cultivation world.</p><p>Yu Hua must have consumed many spiritual pills and elixirs, and still had some left over.</p><p>Qin Sang happily put the two bottles of Li Long Pills away, silently thanking Yu Hua for accelerating his own cultivation progress.</p><p>His biggest gains were the magical artifacts and the two bottles of Li Long Pills. He also had several thousand spirit stones.  Qin Sang sorted through the rest of the spoils and put them into his dimensional pouch.</p><p>After cleaning up the loot, Qin Sang felt exhilarated.  His losses were far outweighed by his gains—it was absolutely worth it, but he didn't want a repeat performance.</p><p>Reviewing the events, from being forced into revealing his location by Yu Hua, every step had been a walk on a razor's edge. One wrong move, and he would have been doomed. Qin Sang hoped never to experience such a thing again.</p><p>Learning that Yu Hua had entered the Boundless Valley in search of spiritual herbs, and had only pursued him after sensing the Heart-Eating Insects, with no accomplices, Qin Sang felt relieved.</p><p>He continued questioning Yu Hua, but his spirit began to decay.</p><p>The ice palace wasn't quiet.  A blizzard raged outside the ice walls, constantly battering them with a constant *thump-thump* sound.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced outside the ice wall, but still saw no sign of Yun Youzi. He wondered how he was doing and if he'd obtained the Nightfall Lily.</p><p>Seriously injured, Qin Sang decided to stay in the ice palace to recuperate.</p><p>He didn't rush to remove the Corpse Talisman.  He still needed it to deceive the Flying Night Rakshasa when he left.</p><p>Qin Sang sat cross-legged in the ice palace, motionless. The chaotic spiritual energy within his body gradually calmed down. With the help of the pills and his cultivation techniques, the damage to his dantian and meridians began to heal.</p><p>Time ticked by, second by second.</p><p>After an unknown period, Qin Sang awoke from meditation, exhaling a breath of stale air.</p><p>He examined himself internally. His injuries weren't fully healed, but they wouldn't significantly affect his strength.</p>
