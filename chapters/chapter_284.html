<h1>Chapter 277: Daoist Priest Qingfeng</h1><p>Chapter 277: Daoist Priest Qingfeng</p><p>Yunyouzi also told Qin Sangming that the spirit medicine that emitted this mysterious yellow energy was not limited to the Xuanwen Yellow Essence; the probability that there was a Xuanwen Yellow Essence below that mysterious yellow energy was only fifty percent.</p><p>Besides the mysterious yellow energy, there was the possibility of finding similar spirit medicine below other energy of other colors. Yunyouzi promised that regardless of the type of spirit medicine, as long as it could help repair hidden injuries, he would do his utmost to help Qin Sang gather and refine the pills, free of charge.</p><p>Similarly, Qin Sang also had to return the favor and provide assistance to Yunyouzi when he was in need.</p><p>Yunyouzi suspected that there was a high possibility that these spirit medicines had guardian spirit beasts, and that even if they managed to arrive safely, gathering the medicine would not be easy; they would need to work together in unity.</p><p>This request was reasonable, so Qin Sang did not hesitate to agree.</p><p>However, before that, the first thing they needed to consider was how to find this suspected medicine garden.</p><p>The discovery of this place had many twists and turns.</p><p>Originally, this place was an ancient immortal’s cave in the middle of Jiuyong Pass and Xuanlan Pass, in the area where the inner and middle zones intersected, beyond the reach of major sects and a place of chaos since ancient times.</p><p>The commotion of the cave’s emergence attracted a lot of attention, including that of many Foundation Building stage immortal cultivators.</p><p>However, after breaking the outer restriction, people found that the cave was empty and contained no valuables, so the people who entered the cave returned empty-handed.</p><p>Fortunately, the remaining restrictions of the cave were still intact, so later on, some immortal cultivators repaired the restrictions and built a market here called Qiuhong Market.</p><p>Because of its location, Qiuhong Market had no other markets or towns nearby, and the restrictions of Qiuhong Market were powerful so as to remain standing for decades, thus it was an extremely safe haven. Consequently, the people in the market gradually increased, and its reputation became greater and greater.</p><p>Until one year, a natural phenomenon came, and unexpectedly, a large group of cloud beasts comparable to the Foundation Building stage came out from the depths of the Ancient Immortal Battlefield and wandered to Qiuhong Market, leading to its destruction and the encirclement of the market's owner by the beasts. People were shocked to discover that there was a hidden universe inside Qiuhong Market!</p><p>Deep within Qiuhong Market, there was actually a great protective array concealed, and within the protective array was where the genuine cave was located!</p><p>That was where the ancient immortal’s real treasure trove was!</p><p>Because of the huge commotion created by the emergence of the cave, many people knew about this place. The owner of the market could not have kept it for himself, so he came up with an idea to spend a large sum of money to repair the restrictions, then borrowed the market to hide his intentions while secretly trying to break the protective array.</p><p>After the protective array was exposed, people came in droves to explore Qiuhong Market, but the protective array was very dangerous, so it was not easy to get in. Many people died within the array.</p><p>Later, the pattern of the protective array was finally understood: about every thirty years, the array would enter a low point. During the low point of the array, if Foundation Building stage immortal cultivators formed an array to enter together, there was also a high probability of succeeding.</p><p>Over the years, batches of immortal cultivators had come and gone, but this secret path had never been discovered before.</p><p>The scene in the jade pendant was made by the first person to discover the secret path, who had copied down what they saw. However, after this person left, they mysteriously died and the information had never been leaked out.</p><p>Until two years ago, some news that seemed to be true or false suddenly began to spread, about the secret path and the medicine garden, with the trend of gaining momentum. Of course, most people did not believe it.</p><p>Because in Qiuhong Market, besides several important places, every other corner had been searched countless times. It was not an exaggeration to say that the ground had been dug three feet deep. If there was any secret path or treasure, it would have already been found.</p><p>Moreover, this kind of rumor was not the first time it had been spread, and it was not only spread when Qiuhong Market emerged. Almost every time a similar situation occurred, there were people with ulterior motives who spread various rumors and attempted to fish in troubled waters.</p><p>After receiving the news, Yunyouzi followed the principle of not missing any opportunity and personally went on a trip. Coincidentally, he saw the scene in the jade pendant and thus confirmed that the news was very likely true.</p><p>Since the person who had left the scene in the jade pendant was dead, Yunyouzi did not know the exact location of the secret path and could only think of other ways.</p><p>After a meticulous investigation, Yunyouzi suspected that the person’s death was greatly related to the companions who had entered Qiuhong Market with him thirty years ago. Finally, he focused on three people.</p><p>These three people were also going to enter during the next low point of the array, and they were currently gathering people and practicing the array.</p><p>The first thing they needed to do was to mix into the ranks of these three people before the protective array reached its low point. By secretly observing these people’s movements, they could determine who the murderer was.</p><p>So, besides Qin Sang and Yunyouzi, there was another person traveling with them.</p><p>The three of them needed to act separately.</p><p>Having determined the goal, then look for a chance to contact.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang put away the jade pendant. After ten more days, it will be the appointed time for him and Wanderer to set out to Qiu Hong Market and seek an opportunity to blend into one of the teams.</p><p>Qin Sang tidied himself up. After the Wumu Sword swallowed the Black Yan Zhang, its power has increased by another point. The Shifang Yanluo Banner and Treasure Talisman Ruyi are his last trump cards, plus the Nine Dragon Tiannian Talisman, which has been mostly restored, with these treasures, as long as he is careful, Qin Sang is not worried about his safety.</p><p>However, some of them cannot be seen by others. After using them, he must be prepared to kill and silence the people.</p><p>Before this, it is best to keep a low profile.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Qin Sang walked out of the cave mansion, closed the ban, and went straight to Xuanlu Pass, spent some spirit stones to replenish several magic weapons, and made full preparations.</p><p>Ten days later.</p><p>The Wanderer arrived as promised.</p><p>"Brother Qin, there is a message from there..."</p><p>The Wanderer came in a hurry,"The great array of the Qiu Hong Market, this time the low tide will appear later, it may be postponed by one to two years. At that time, there may be more people entering the Qiu Hong Market. However, the longer the time, the easier it is to gain each other's trust. For us, it may not be a bad thing. But Brother Qin must act with caution, even if you have confirmed the person's identity, before my fellow Taoist Ge Yuan and I arrive, don't startle the snake."</p><p>The Wanderer is still a bit worried about Qin Sang, so he told him a thousand times to be careful.</p><p>Ge Yuan was the third person who joined forces with them. Qin Sang had not seen him yet.</p><p>This person is now潜伏in the town of Xihuang, which is the town closest to Qiu Hong Market, and is always monitoring the changes in the situation.</p><p>Qin Sang also knows that this matter is of great importance. For one person to blend into the other party's team and make a rash move is not a wise move. It is very likely to be besieged.</p><p>"Senior, don't worry, I know the importance of it, I will be careful."</p><p>The Wanderer said, "Brother Qin understands. By the way, have you decided what identity to use as a disguise?"</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, "After this, senior can call me Daoist Qingfeng."</p>
