<h1>Chapter 855 Avatar</h1><p>During his retreat on Tianxing Island, Qin Sang befriended several fellow cultivators. Most of the message talismans he now held were left by them. He picked up two at random.</p><p>One invited him to a small gathering of friends to discuss the Dao.</p><p>Another informed him of a senior lecturing on the Dao elsewhere, inviting him to attend.</p><p>Qin Sang was eager to check on his avatar, so he put the talismans aside and hurried into his cave.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Moonstones provided a faint light.</p><p>His avatar sat cross-legged on a cushion, unaware of Qin Sang's arrival due to the isolating barrier.</p><p>His breathing was steady, his posture as still as a bell.</p><p>This was a good sign, indicating no mishaps during Qin Sang's absence.</p><p>He deactivated the barrier and walked in. The avatar remained motionless.</p><p>Sitting opposite his avatar, Qin Sang examined its condition and found that the demonic seed had 'consumed', or rather fused with, the physical body, reaching the crucial point of embryonic gestation.</p><p>He hadn't expected to be away for so long, nearly jeopardizing the entire process.</p><p>With a serious expression, Qin Sang pondered briefly, then sealed the cave entrance and set up a spirit-gathering formation using spirit stones.</p><p>After sitting down again, he extended his divine sense, connecting with the avatar's consciousness to prepare for the blood sacrifice.</p><p>The spiritual energy on Bao Gu Mountain was already abundant, and with the formation's boost, the cave held enough to sustain Qin Sang's secret technique.</p><p>After a full night of preparation, ensuring everything was perfect, Qin Sang forced a drop of blood essence from his fingertip.</p><p>The blood essence hovered between them. With a solemn expression, Qin Sang's hand seals changed rapidly, causing the spiritual energy in the cave to surge. Runes materialized in the air, quickly descending onto the blood essence.</p><p>The blood essence absorbed the runes, glowing brightly red.</p><p>This single drop had to withstand hundreds of runes, a significant test of Qin Sang's control. Fortunately, his cultivation level was high enough, and everything proceeded smoothly.</p><p>The last rune merged into the blood essence.</p><p>With a 'pop', the essence burst like a blood bubble. The resulting blood energy, instead of dissipating, coalesced into a human-shaped blood shadow.</p><p>The shadow, no bigger than a finger, had features strikingly similar to Qin Sang's, but with a sinister aura in its eyes.</p><p>Its eerie smile sent chills down one's spine.</p><p>"A demonic art indeed, truly sinister," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>From the beginning of the secret technique, the seeds of backlash were sown.</p><p>Even with his current cultivation, he could already sense the intent of the backlash, although faint and negligible.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang commanded, pointing at the avatar. The shadow's grin widened, and it eagerly lunged at the avatar, entering through its forehead.</p><p>The avatar shuddered slightly, then became still.</p><p>Qin Sang followed the blood shadow with his divine sense into the Purple Mansion. He saw a black cocoon containing the dormant Sword Soul Demonic Seed, about to emerge.</p><p>The shadow merged into the cocoon and vanished. But Qin Sang continued, drawing out several more drops of blood, refining them into shadows. Some entered the Purple Mansion, others infused the avatar's physical body.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang exhaled slowly, his face slightly pale. He checked the avatar's condition, finding the secret technique had been successful.</p><p>A subtle connection now existed between him and the avatar.</p><p>The Sword Soul Demonic Seed was exceptionally stable. At this rate, with a few more blood sacrifices, the avatar would be complete.</p><p>Having consumed so much blood essence, he quickly took several spirit pills.</p><p>Nine days passed in a blink.</p><p>He repeated the ritual daily, using his blood essence to nurture the embryonic form. This was the ninth and final time.</p><p>'Thump! Thump! Thump!'</p><p>Blood shadows materialized at Qin Sang's fingertips, lunging at the avatar. Bloodstains appeared on its body. Most noticeably, the cocoon in the Purple Mansion was now blood-red.</p><p>As the last shadow entered, the cocoon suddenly split open, and the Sword Soul Demonic Seed sprang forth. At the same moment, the avatar's eyes snapped open.</p><p>Crimson eyes, like pools of blood, and a faint sinister smile played on its lips.</p><p>Qin Sang's face darkened. Using a thunderous voice, he activated the secret technique from the *Seed Embryo Demonic Birth* to dispel the avatar's undesirable thoughts and bring it under control.</p><p>As if struck by lightning, the avatar stiffened, the blood in its eyes receding, its expression returning to normal.</p><p>The two, though drastically different in appearance, shared a similar aura.</p><p>However, the connection between Qin Sang and the now complete avatar became more obscure.</p><p>Unless they appeared together, or someone's cultivation far surpassed Qin Sang's, it would be impossible to see through the avatar's disguise.</p><p>Furthermore, the avatar possessed its own consciousness, capable of independent action. Even away from Qin Sang's gaze, it would be indistinguishable from an ordinary person.</p><p>Having finally completed the avatar, Qin Sang smiled and examined its condition.</p><p>The avatar's original cultivation was only at the Qi Refining stage, which wouldn't increase after the transformation. Qin Sang needed to continue the blood sacrifice and use the secret technique to enhance its power.</p><p>*Seed Embryo Demonic Birth* also described another method: devouring other cultivators. The higher their cultivation, the faster the avatar's growth.</p><p>However, the consequences were obvious â€“ increased risk of the avatar turning on its master, creating a demonic entity that would ultimately consume him.</p><p>With *Primordial Spirit Sword Nurturing Chapter* stalled, Qin Sang had to control a peak Core Formation avatar with his mid-Core Formation cultivation.  For safety, slowly enhancing it with blood essence was the better option.</p><p>Unfortunately, the avatar hadn't formed a nascent soul and couldn't be stored like a corpse puppet. It had to remain outside at all times.</p><p>To prevent accidents, until it had sufficient self-preservation abilities, he would keep it in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang drew a few drops of blood essence for the avatar, then ordered it to cultivate in seclusion.</p><p>He, too, sat down and entered a meditative trance, washing away his fatigue overnight.</p><p>The next morning, Qin Sang glanced at the avatar and stepped out of the cave.</p><p>He was contemplating the matter of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>They possessed a cultivation method based on the celestial stars, having produced Core Formation cultivators in the past, yet now, it was unknown. Was the technique flawed, abandoned, or had something else happened?</p><p>To uncover the truth, he likely needed to go near their sect and find a way to contact their core disciples or senior cultivators.</p><p>The Lan Dou Sect wasn't far from Tianxing Island. He could reach it in less than a month.</p><p>"Before leaving, I'll ask Alchemist Yi about the Scorpion Venom Grass.  My priority is still finding spirit herbs. Oh, right..."</p><p>Qin Sang noticed the message talismans outside and retrieved them.</p><p>Most of the information was outdated, but one caught his attention. It was from the shopkeeper who helped him exchange for high-grade spirit stones last time.</p>
