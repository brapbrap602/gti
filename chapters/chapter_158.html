<h1>Chapter 151: All Beings Have Feelings</h1><p>Chapter 151: All Beings Have Feelings</p><p>The escape light landed in the Wen Yue Market Town. Qin Sang first had to fulfill the agreement he had made a year ago and retrieve the Chi Dragon Sword.</p><p>It was not that he was reluctant to part with this evil instrument that was about to be destroyed but rather because he did not want the Chi Dragon Sword to end up in the outside world and attract the attention of those who had ill intentions.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu returned the Chi Dragon Sword to Qin Sang with an embarrassed smile on his face. "I beg your forgiveness, Fellow Daoist Qin. I was so eager to examine the prohibitions in the core of the magic weapon that I nearly destroyed this treasure."</p><p>Qin Sang swept the Chi Dragon Sword with his divine sense and found that it had indeed acquired a few more cracks, and the prohibitions on it were in imminent danger. With a gentle touch of his spiritual energy, the entire sword body shattered, the sword body turned into fragments that fell to the ground, and only a dense mass of evil energy remained in the core, dispersing with the wind.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu's expression changed slightly, and he muttered in a somewhat dejected tone, "Fellow Daoist Qin, I will compensate you with a top-grade magic weapon..."</p><p>Qin Sang did not express his opinion and patted the palm of his hand, which still had traces of evil energy on it. He looked at Shopkeeper Wu and asked, "Fellow Daoist Wu, you have been observing for so long. Have you gained anything in the way of weapon refinement?"</p><p>Speaking of weapon refinement, Shopkeeper Wu seemed to immediately forget about the trouble of compensation, and his expression was invigorated as he said, "The prohibitions on this sword are extremely exquisite, something that I have never heard of before. Unfortunately, my cultivation base limits me, and I can only comprehend one or two of them, but it will also be of great benefit to my future weapon refinement! I must thank Fellow Daoist Qin for this opportunity!"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Shopkeeper Wu in surprise.</p><p>Old Man Yi was a Golden Core cultivator who could use evil energy and a small amount of spiritual materials to refine a top-grade magic weapon. Although it could only be used for a period of time, this weapon refining technique was also very powerful.</p><p>Shopkeeper Wu was only a tenth-layer Qi Refining cultivator. He had merely observed for a year and yet had been able to comprehend one or two of the prohibitions. This showed that he was indeed very talented when it came to weapon refinement and had a pretty good temperament.</p><p>It was a pity that he was already quite advanced in age and had almost no hope of establishing a foundation, unless he could achieve astonishing accomplishments in weapon refinement and gain the attention of a Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivator who would spare no expense to help him establish a foundation.</p><p>This was also a dilemma that many cultivators faced. Those who closed themselves off to cultivate lacked cultivation resources, while those who focused on external things would certainly affect their cultivation advancement even if they could earn some spirit stones. It was not certain that they would be able to make up for it in the future.</p><p>Unless one had a background or was a truly talented genius, one could only have one of these things.</p><p>"It's just a broken spiritual sword. If it can help Fellow Daoist Wu comprehend the Way of Weapon Refining before it's destroyed, then it will have served its greatest purpose. Fellow Daoist Wu doesn't need to take it to heart."</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand indifferently and, without waiting for Shopkeeper Wu to speak, said, "I have other matters to attend to. I will come and trouble Fellow Daoist Wu for some tea another day."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang turned around and left the shop, striding towards the exit of Wen Yue Market Town.</p><p>...</p><p>Outside Mount Shaohua, on an unknown island.</p><p>It was originally just a barren island, but today, a dense fog had appeared on the island, concealing it like a barrier.</p><p>'Chirp, chirp...'</p><p>A bird with gray feathers held a small fish in its mouth and anxiously circled the island. Its small brain could not understand why it could not suddenly enter its home. Every time it tried to enter the fog, it was inexplicably pushed out.</p><p>It did not give up and tried again and again. Its originally clear and pleasant cries became increasingly anxious, turning into a harsh squawk.</p><p>At this moment, a huge greenstone on the island was flattened by someone, and three people were sitting on it in meditation. One of them was Yu Daiyue.</p><p>The other two were a woman, Daoist name Qing Ting, and another one was Wu Yuesheng, whom they had invited.</p><p>"How noisy!"</p><p>Yu Daiyue glared at the bird, his eyes filled with divine light, like sharp arrows. In the blink of an eye, they flew out of the fog.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at the moment Yu Daiyue flew out of the fog, he was suddenly blocked by a green light. The two lights canceled each other out and silently disappeared, unnoticed by the bird.</p><p>Yu Daiyue turned to look at Qing Ting in surprise.</p><p>Qing Ting opened her eyes and took a deep look at the chaotic bird. Her tone was inexplicably tinged with emotion as she said, "All beings have feelings. Let's fulfill this pair of pitiful little fellows."</p><p>As she spoke, she opened up a gap in the fog, and the bird flew into its nest like an arrow from a bowstring, feeding the small fish in its mouth to its breeding companion. It chirped and squawked loudly, seemingly recounting its fear from before.</p><p>Yu Daiyue let out a dry laugh. "Senior Sister Qing Ting has a kind heart... By the way, I wonder how Junior Brother Jiang is doing?"</p><p>Qing Ting shook her head and sighed.</p><p>Just then, a white cloud suddenly flew over from the sky, while a small boat broke through the waves from the south. Two people stood on it, and Yu Daiyue's expression turned to joy as he said, "Fellow Daoist Baiyun has arrived! The Liu brothers have also arrived."</p><p>Seeing that Qing Ting's brows were slightly furrowed, Yu Daiyue advised, "Senior Sister, don't worry. Junior Brother Qin's cave abode is in the Ancient Abyss Kingdom. It will take him some time to get here."</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, a sound of air being torn apart came from the north. Qin Sang arrived, riding on a flying shuttle.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on the bluestone and secretly sized up the six people in front of him.</p><p>He had met Martial Sister Qing Ting and Yu Daiyue before, and he had also met another Martial Brother once.</p><p>Apart from the three, there was also an old Daoist who seemed to be around sixty years old. His hair was gray, and he had a goatee, making him look quite old. His eyes were slightly narrowed, as if he was always smiling. He looked like a kind senior.</p><p>The other two were in a magic weapon shaped like a small boat. They were a pair of twin brothers who looked almost identical.</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, this pair of twin brothers were only at the thirteenth level of the Qi Refining Stage. Although they were both at the peak, he remembered that Yu Daiyue had said that breaking the formation required a Foundation Building Stage cultivator to operate it.</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please sit!"</p><p>Yu Daiyue greeted them warmly and introduced everyone.</p><p>After the introduction, Qin Sang learned that the Martial Brother was Wu Yuesheng, whom he had mentioned before. The other three were not disciples of Shao Hua Mountain but rogue cultivators from the Yun Cang Great Marsh.</p><p>The old man's Daoist title was Bai Yun Mountain Man. His cave was on Bai Yun Island. The twin brothers were called Liu Jiang and Liu Shan. They cultivated on Qi Long Island, and were both rogue cultivators with a good reputation nearby.</p><p>Except for the Liu brothers, everyone, including Qin Sang, was at the early stage of the Foundation Building Stage. Qing Ting and Yu Daiyue were slightly higher, close to the middle stage of the Foundation Building Stage.</p><p>Qin Sang sat aside and secretly observed everyone. He found that except for the Liu brothers, who looked a little vigilant, the others were calm, showing no signs of anything unusual.</p><p>He could only guess from their positions that the Liu brothers and Bai Yun Mountain Man were sitting close together, but this was normal.</p><p>After introducing everyone, Yu Daiyue said to Qing Ting, "Martial Sister Qing Ting, except for Junior Brother Li Zai, all the fellow Daoists are here."</p><p>Qing Ting nodded at everyone, greeted them and said, "Junior Brother Li Zai is at a crucial moment in his closed-door cultivation. I have already given him a Fire Crow Token for him to practice. It will not delay our important matters. I will introduce Junior Brother Li to all fellow Daoists later."</p><p>As Qing Ting spoke, her gaze swept across everyone, finally landing on the Liu brothers, her eyes filled with some doubt.</p><p>Seeing this, Yu Daiyue smiled and said, "Martial Sister, don't worry. Although the Liu brothers have not yet reached the Foundation Building Stage, they have the same amazing skill. Together, they can exert strength no less than a cultivator at the Foundation Building Stage. Their Divine Consciousness is enough to withstand the impact of the demonic sound. Operating the Fire Crow Token should not be a problem."</p>
