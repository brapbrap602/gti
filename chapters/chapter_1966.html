<h1>Chapter 1957: The Teahouse</h1><p>Fire Domain.</p><p>Here, even the wind took on a form, the form of flames.</p><p>Blazing inferno fires floated on the surface of magma, howling as they came and went.</p><p>Between heaven and earth, apart from crimson, no other color could be seen.</p><p>Occasionally, 'splashes' could be observed in the magma, strange figures flashing in and out of existence.</p><p>This was a pure ocean of magma, not a single piece of land in sight. Only fire beasts with special bloodlines, and fire spirits born from the flames, could permanently survive here.</p><p>They feared nothing in this environment, weaving through the magma like fish in water.</p><p>Suddenly, the fiery winds here paused for a moment, gradually revealing two illusory figures.</p><p>These two were Ling Shi and Gui Hou.</p><p>Gui Hou, with a Fire Jade Centipede coiled around his arm, seemed to be communicating with it, then pointed downwards.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Ling, it’s here! Lord Zhuque mentioned before that some Dark Devil Lilies grow beneath this magma. I just don't know if their medicinal properties will meet your requirements.”</p><p>“Dark Devil Lilies prefer to grow in places where the power of inferno fire is most potent and violent, absorbing fire poison as nourishment. The environment greatly influences their quality. If I were to use them myself, high-grade Dark Devil Lilies would suffice. However, this time, I need to refine a virulent poison requested by Senior, and it must be of supreme-grade quality.”</p><p>Ling Shi twitched his nose slightly, using a secret technique to sense the surroundings, and nodded. “This place is not bad; it has the potential to nurture supreme-grade Dark Devil Lilies. Let’s go, let's take a look down below!”</p><p>The two plummeted downwards. The magma parted on both sides, then closed up again in the blink of an eye, returning to normal.</p><p>The magma was bottomless.</p><p>Gui Hou led the way, continuously descending, and asked via sound transmission, “Fellow Daoist Ling, do you mean that in the entire field, there might only be a few that reach supreme-grade quality? How many are needed to refine the virulent poison?”</p><p>“The more, the better!” Ling Shi replied.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Gui Hou furrowed his brows. “I’m afraid there aren’t many places like this in the entire Fire Domain, and once a field reaches a certain size, it’s likely to be claimed. The three great sects of the Fire Domain are all proficient in fire-attribute Dao Arts, and there are also various other powers, large and small. Even if they don’t cultivate Dark Devil Lilies, they can still develop it into a medicinal field.”</p><p>“Let’s do our best; this isn’t the only option! Besides, Senior is incredibly powerful and definitely has a way. If he wanted to unify the Fire Domain, wouldn’t it be a piece of cake?” Ling Shi said casually.</p><p>Brought back by Qin Sang, Ling Shi was initially apprehensive, but now he felt at ease.</p><p>Here, he only needed to focus wholeheartedly on comprehending the Dao of Poisons and developing various virulent poisons. No matter the request, Qin Sang would fully support him.</p><p>This kind of treatment was typically reserved for Grandmasters of Alchemy.</p><p>Although there was a saying that alchemy and poison crafting were two sides of the same coin, and Ling Shi did understand some alchemy techniques, the poison cultivation arts he practiced were not solely for refining poisons. Furthermore, without an alchemical heritage, he ultimately couldn't compare to a true Alchemy Grandmaster.</p><p>The price was restricted freedom, but he had already been targeted by the Soulfall Abyss and had no choice.</p><p>Gui Hou couldn’t be as carefree as Ling Shi. He shook his head and said, “While that's true, as subordinates, we should do our utmost to share Master's burdens.”</p><p>As they spoke, the two descended to an extreme depth.</p><p>The temperature here not only didn't decrease, but the scorching, violent aura nurtured by heaven and earth became even more intense.</p><p>Gradually, the magma became invisible to the naked eye, transforming into pure streams of fire, flowing towards them from all directions.</p><p>It was unimaginable what kind of apocalyptic scene would result if these forces were to erupt.</p><p>“Fire Domain cultivators call this place a Blaze Pool. The power of inferno fire undergoes transformation here. Within a powerful Blaze Pool, we must also be cautious. Dark Devil Lilies are connected to the Blaze Pool’s Qi. We must be careful when picking them, lest the Blaze Pool erupts.”</p><p>Gui Hou cautioned.</p><p>As they spoke, they descended a further distance, deliberately slowing down.</p><p>The surrounding scenery changed dramatically, and even the two Nascent Soul stage powerhouses felt a primal sense of oppression.</p><p>Without any warning, the surroundings suddenly became calm.</p><p>Here, not a single turbulent current could be seen.</p><p>However, this tranquility felt incredibly eerie, as if immense power was accumulating here, ready to erupt and destroy everything at any moment.</p><p>There was fire here too, burning quietly. The flames were a faint blue, gently swaying, giving off an unexpectedly delicate impression.</p><p>They cautiously entered this space, avoiding the flames, and soon found a patch of shadow within the blue flames.</p><p>The shadow wasn't completely dark; it emitted a dark blue light.</p><p>Within the light, scattered sparsely, were some flowers, shaped like lilies, with petals also of a dark blue hue, some deep and some lighter in color.</p><p>There was no soil here. They floated, and one could clearly see countless blue roots growing from their base, extending into the flames, absorbing 'nourishment' from the fire.</p><p>“One, two… there are actually five supreme-grade Dark Devil Lilies!”</p><p>Ling Shi’s face lit up with joy. He had expected at most two or three.</p><p>He flashed to the side of a supreme-grade Dark Devil Lily and extended his right hand towards the root ball.</p><p>His fingers flicked gently, and strange waves emanated from his fingertips, enveloping the root ball.</p><p>Ling Shi focused intently, his movements gentle yet decisive. He carefully supported the root ball, then patiently picked out the roots from the flames one by one.</p><p>Picking a single Dark Devil Lily actually took about ten days.</p><p>Gui Hou watched him retrieve a complete lily, then offered to help.</p><p>Just as the two were concentrating on picking the spiritual flowers, they suddenly sensed something and stopped their movements, exchanging glances.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!” Gui Hou said gravely.</p><p>This magma was home to countless fire beasts and fire spirits, and the environment itself was incredibly chaotic.</p><p>While picking herbs in the Blaze Pool, they couldn't be acutely aware of every fluctuation in the outside world. If someone was merely passing by nearby, they wouldn't be alerted.</p><p>However, the newcomer seemed unusual, fleeing here in a panic, as if being pursued, plunging straight in.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi were both composed enough not to act rashly. They judged the direction of the uninvited guest’s movement based on the source of the fluctuations.</p><p>“They’re not coming this way,” Gui Hou’s expression eased slightly.</p><p>Before he finished speaking, they sensed another aura, close behind the first.</p><p>Ling Shi said, “As expected,” then added in surprise, “It’s actually two Nascent Soul cultivators!”</p><p>There weren’t many Nascent Soul cultivators in the Fire Domain.  To encounter two at once, and in the midst of a chase, was quite unexpected.</p><p>“There might be people from the three great sects of the Fire Domain, but it has nothing to do with us.  The important matter at hand…” Gui Hou shook his head, but noticed a change in Ling Shi’s expression.</p><p>“The one behind is a Corpse Demon from the Soulfall Abyss!”</p><p>Ling Shi’s eyes flashed with a cold light, and he sneered. “These things that are neither human nor ghost, I can smell their corpse stench even through the magma!”</p><p>…</p><p>Upper layer.</p><p>A crimson streak of light shuttled through the magma at high speed.</p><p>Within the escaping light was a burly man. If Qin Sang were here, he would recognize this person as Fu Xiao of the Six Harmonies Sect.  Qin Sang, in his transformed state, had lured Fu Xiao over when he eradicated the Sand Bandits.</p><p>At this moment, Fu Xiao’s robust and sturdy body was hunched over, his face ashen, clearly suffering from serious injuries.</p><p>On his chest was a gaping wound, his robes pierced through.</p><p>The wound nearly penetrated straight through to his back, and his internal organs had inevitably suffered severe damage.</p><p>The most troublesome thing was not the injury itself, but the layer of green flames covering the surface of the wound.</p><p>This green fire was like a malignant growth, clinging to his flesh, preventing the wound from healing, and devouring his life force. Even consuming vast quantities of healing pills was useless.</p><p>‘Huff! Huff! Huff!’</p><p>While fleeing, Fu Xiao formed hand seals and spat out a ball of spiritual fire.</p><p>The spiritual fire landed on his chest, intertwining with the green fire, but unable to eradicate it.</p><p>He spat out several more mouthfuls, managing only to temporarily suppress the green fire.</p><p>Moreover, he discovered a more terrifying phenomenon: the green fire was silently invading his internal organs.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he had several methods to extinguish the green fire, but now, seriously injured and with pursuers on his tail, his situation was precarious, and no method seemed effective.</p><p>He mentally calculated the distance to his sect, growing even more anxious. At this rate, he would die before he could escape back.</p><p>He had accidentally stumbled upon the Corpse Demon's hiding place, but hadn't expected another one lurking in the shadows.  Caught off guard, he was ambushed, and the talisman for contacting his sect was also destroyed.  He was truly stranded with no hope in sight.</p><p>Behind him, the sinister aura relentlessly pursued him, rapidly closing in.</p><p>Chasing him was a streak of green flame, extremely conspicuous within the magma.</p><p>Fu Xiao cultivated the Six Harmonies Sect’s core cultivation art, making him as comfortable in magma as a fish in water, his speed lightning-fast.  Yet this green flame was in no way inferior!</p><p>Within the green fire was also a tall figure, appearing even more imposing than Fu Xiao. It was one of the individuals Qin Sang had startled when he activated the bronze pillars.</p><p>The others' whereabouts were unknown, with only this tall man pursuing Fu Xiao alone.</p><p>“Hmph! If Lord Fei Luo hadn’t returned to report and Rou Ji hadn’t been injured, how could you have escaped alive! Stay here!”</p><p>The tall man shouted coldly. His robes billowed, and surges of green flames suddenly erupted from his body, instantly transforming him into a man of fire.</p><p>The green fire spread, instantly dyeing the surrounding magma green. The green magma instantly shifted from scorching hot to bone-chillingly cold.</p><p>The green fire spread incredibly fast.  Just as Fu Xiao sensed something amiss, he was already surrounded by the green magma.  A premonition of danger surged through him.</p><p>Without warning, a ghastly white claw emerged from the green fire.  Its five fingers, like sharp swords, grabbed at his back.</p><p>If this strike landed, Fu Xiao would undoubtedly be in grave danger.</p><p>Fortunately, he had taken precautions. A crimson pattern, composed of flames, appeared on his back, resembling a Bagua but with subtle differences.</p><p>As the Bagua fire diagram appeared, a muffled thunderclap sounded.</p><p>Struck by the ghost claw, the fire diagram trembled violently, cracks appearing, but it successfully blocked the ghost claw for an instant.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity to dash forward. He should have been able to create some distance from his pursuer, but unexpectedly felt a gust of yin wind.</p><p>The ghost claw, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, suddenly materialized in front of him, aiming straight for his face.</p><p>Fu Xiao was horrified, but amidst his panic, a hint of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes. He opened his mouth wide, and instead of flames, he spat out a pearl.</p><p>This pearl possessed an exceptionally brilliant luster, known as the Crimson Seal Pearl. It was a treasure Fu Xiao relied heavily upon, and now, to escape, he could only bear the pain of destroying it!</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The Crimson Seal Pearl shot towards the ghost claw.  The ghost claw immediately sensed the anomaly and curled its fingers inward, attempting to retreat into the green magma.</p><p>However, the ghost claw was too close to Fu Xiao, and Fu Xiao had planned this for a while, his timing impeccable.</p><p>With a ‘Boom,’ the Crimson Seal Pearl exploded. A fire serpent, entwined with all the fragments, rushed out, its fangs bared and claws extended.</p><p>A furious roar echoed from within the magma. The ghost claw, unable to retreat in time, simply didn’t retract. Instead, its five fingers spread wide, revealing a black eye embedded in its palm, swiveling left and right like a living creature, utterly bizarre.</p><p>With a blink of the eye, a black beam shot out from the pupil, meeting the fire serpent formed by the Crimson Seal Pearl.</p><p>The moment the two forces collided, a shadowy figure vaguely appeared behind the ghost claw, retreating backwards.</p><p>The Crimson Seal Pearl possessed boundless power, instantly destroying the black beam.</p><p>The tall man appeared rather disheveled, but hadn't suffered significant injuries, having dodged most of the blast.</p><p>However, the green fire that had permeated the magma could no longer be sustained.</p><p>Fu Xiao seized the opportunity to break free.  Flicking his sleeve, several streaks of light shot towards his enemy.  Then, without even looking at the result, he chose a direction and fled with all his might.</p><p>He remembered a Six Harmonies Sect ruin from thousands of years ago.</p><p>The brief exchange had drastically worsened Fu Xiao's injuries, and he knew that with his own strength alone, escaping the demon’s clutches was almost impossible.</p><p>He hoped the ruin was still there; it was his only hope!</p><p>…</p><p>Elsewhere.</p><p>Gui Hou and Ling Shi temporarily stopped collecting herbs and quietly left the Blaze Pool.</p><p>They didn't get too close to the battlefield, but based on the fluctuations emanating from there, they could deduce what was happening with reasonable accuracy.</p><p>“That’s the Azure Sky Formula of the Six Harmonies Sect!” Gui Hou didn't venture out often, but he had some understanding of the surrounding forces, especially the three great sects of the Fire Domain.</p><p>“A Corpse Demon from the Soulfall Abyss, chasing and killing a Six Harmonies Sect expert here… don’t you find it suspicious, Fellow Daoist?”</p><p>Ling Shi was eager to get involved. “The Soulfall Abyss is extending its clutches into the Fire Domain again. There must be a sinister plot!  It's best we investigate this thoroughly and be prepared, so as to avoid disturbing the Daoist sanctuary and affecting Senior's cultivation!”</p><p>Gui Hou glanced at Ling Shi. He knew that Ling Shi had a grudge against the Soulfall Abyss and certainly wanted to take the opportunity to vent his anger.</p><p>Ling Shi’s words did carry some weight.</p><p>However, Gui Hou also had to consider whether their rash intervention might attract the attention of a Soulfall Abyss ancestor when there might have been no issue otherwise.</p><p>Gui Hou had followed Qin Sang from the Talisman World to the Great Thousand World. He knew that Qin Sang hadn’t achieved his Void Refinement breakthrough through normal means and might not be a match for a true Void Refinement cultivator.  It was best to consolidate his foundation and avoid contact for as long as possible.</p><p>“Don't worry, Fellow Daoist. This guy isn't that important in the Soulfall Abyss.  He’s definitely not the only one who infiltrated the Fire Domain.  The Old Devil has several Nascent Soul late-stage demons under his command. The loss of one Corpse Demon wouldn’t even make him bat an eye,” Ling Shi said confidently.</p><p>Just as they were in disagreement, they suddenly heard a voice.</p><p>They immediately stopped, expressions of respect appearing on their faces.  They listened attentively for a moment, then bowed simultaneously towards the void.</p><p>“By your command!”</p><p>After the voice disappeared, they straightened up.</p><p>Ling Shi laughed heartily. “As expected, Senior has already seen through everything!”</p><p>Gui Hou offered no comment, glanced ahead, and sped off in pursuit.  “Fellow Daoist Ling, we need to discuss our plan carefully.  Master demands a live capture; there must be no mistakes.  We can only rely on your poison skills next.”</p><p>“Certainly! The Corpse Demons of the Soulfall Abyss constantly refine corpse poison, and ordinary toxins have little effect on them.  However, my poison skills are a different matter. I’ll make sure he won’t return alive!”</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Daoist sanctuary.</p><p>Qin Sang's true body sat cross-legged on a stone bed, surrounded by twinkling stars.</p>
