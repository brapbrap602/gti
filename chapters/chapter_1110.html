<h1>Chapter 1102: Reunion</h1><p>The ancient cultivation ruins were closest to the Hanging Skull Pass.</p><p>A long journey it was.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived near the ancient cultivation ruins and found the entrance.</p><p>A cracked stone stele stood in the middle of a ring of rubble.</p><p>After enduring numerous spiritual tides and celestial phenomena, the entrance to the ancient cultivation ruins had not been destroyed, persevering to this day.</p><p>Qin Sang discovered that various sects had left behind restrictions to protect the entrance, but after some investigation, he confirmed that no cultivators were stationed within the secret realm; the surrounding area was deserted.</p><p>Years ago, when cultivators from the Hanging Skull Pass found the ancient cultivation ruins, they discovered that it had been visited by the Demon Sect.</p><p>The remaining treasures were first plundered by Che Yutao and others, then further events occurred, and major sects controlled it for many years, leaving very few behind.</p><p>Furthermore, the ancient cultivation ruins were not as peaceful as other secret realms.  Many dangerous fire spirits resided within; after that event, it had become almost a ruin, with extremely unstable space, unsuitable as a base.</p><p>Its abandonment was not unexpected.</p><p>Qin Sang quietly entered the ancient cultivation ruins.</p><p>His cultivation was vastly improved, and the restrictions he encountered were different from those of the past – likely due to the cataclysm.  Qin Sang entered effortlessly.</p><p>A wave of intense heat struck him.</p><p>Lava flowed, a sea of red before his eyes.</p><p>Besides a few isolated peaks resembling islands, the entire secret realm had become a sea of lava!</p><p>Gazing into the depths of the secret realm.</p><p>Qin Sang saw the shadow of the Sky Peak, completely surrounded by lava.</p><p>Most frighteningly, the space there was extremely unstable; countless spatial fissures surrounded Sky Peak, far more numerous than when they escaped before.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated briefly, then flew directly west towards Sky Peak.</p><p>Below, lava surged, occasionally erupting from the ground.  Fire spirits frequently leaped and played in the lava, attacking Qin Sang upon seeing him.</p><p>Perhaps it had been cleared, but the number of fire spirits was not as many as he anticipated.  Otherwise, traversing this area would have been much more difficult for Qin Sang.</p><p>After a short time, he arrived near Sky Peak, the area once sealed by flame runes.</p><p>Now, the ancient restrictions were gone.  The once numerous peaks were mostly submerged in lava, the exposed ones transformed into lava islands, losing their former beauty.</p><p>Even if treasures remained, they would have been destroyed by repeated lava washes.</p><p>The greatest dangers were not these, but the countless spatial fissures and the ancient restrictions interwoven among them.</p><p>Compared to the time of the cataclysm, the area was less chaotic. Qin Sang observed for a while and didn't see any new fissures forming.</p><p>But that didn't mean he could relax.</p><p>Looking at the countless spatial fissures, Qin Sang felt apprehensive.</p><p>The lava was equally dangerous; the main body of the secret realm's ancient restrictions lay within the lava, now highly sensitive.  Touching the restrictions would result in a counterattack at the least; triggering spatial tremors and being caught in a fissure would be inescapable.</p><p>The distance to Sky Peak wasn't great, yet it felt like an insurmountable chasm.</p><p>"After Nascent Soul, with the Sky Eye Butterfly, entering shouldn't be difficult. But what's the point of searching for the Inner Scene Primal Rune then? I can only try. If I truly can't enter, I can't force it…"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head, summoned the Sky Eye Butterfly, letting it land on his shoulder, and fully activated the Sky Eye divine ability.</p><p>He circled the area countless times.</p><p>After careful consideration, he finally chose a direction and cautiously entered.</p><p>But he hadn't gone far before encountering an ancient restriction, forcing him to retreat.</p><p>He didn't give up, choosing another direction to continue probing.</p><p>Attempt after attempt ended in failure.</p><p>Each attempt required his utmost concentration. Even with the Sky Eye Butterfly's assistance, Qin Sang felt exhaustion. Knowing he couldn't rush, he found a lava island and decided to stay there for a few days.</p><p>Two days passed quickly.</p><p>No other cultivators appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang relaxed, exploring bit by bit, finally making progress; he could now traverse about half the distance.</p><p>On the third day.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the spatial fissure zone, searching for a path to approach Sky Peak when he sensed something and abruptly looked down, staring intently at the lava ahead.</p><p>The lava surged, showing no unusual signs.</p><p>Just now, Tianmudie detected a faint, insignificant shadow emerging from the lava, quickly disappearing into the depths.</p><p>The shadow was extremely subtle; Qin Sang would have completely missed it if Tianmudie hadn't given warning.</p><p>"Besides Fire Spirits, could there be other creatures here?  Able to move freely in this place!"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised, then suddenly remembered something.</p><p>"No way? Could it be them?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze sharpened. After a moment's thought, he quietly withdrew from the spatial fissure and landed on the island, retrieving a jade vial from his Qianjun ring.</p><p>The vial contained only a thin layer of spiritual liquid—the remaining Chihuo Liujin, leftover from feeding the Fat Silkworm and Tianmudie.</p><p>Neither insect was close to its fourth transformation, and he had no other insects worth cultivating with Chihuo Liujin, so he kept it.</p><p>The remaining Chihuo Liujin was insufficient to significantly benefit Tianmudie and the Fat Silkworm.</p><p>Earlier, Qin Sang had taken a small amount, hoping to tempt the Fat Silkworm to awaken, but it failed.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm remained asleep within Ya Gu.</p><p>Months have passed, and there's still no sign of awakening.</p><p>He wondered when the silkworm and Ya Gu would wake up.</p><p>Qin Sang cleared away the surrounding Fire Spirits, then placed a jade plate on the island, dripped a trace of Chihuo Liujin onto it, and vanished into the shadows.</p><p>Initially, nothing unusual happened.</p><p>Lava waves splashed onto the island, quickly cooling and solidifying into layers of black stone.</p><p>Soon, a tiny figure emerged from the lava.</p><p>It swam effortlessly, unafraid of the heat.</p><p>Clearly, it sensed and was attracted to the Chihuo Liujin.  However, it remained cautious, staying submerged, circling the island several times to observe its surroundings.</p><p>"It's a Fire Jade Centipede!"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes lit up from his hiding place.</p><p>He finally saw its full form: a Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Moreover, it was a peak second-stage Fire Jade Centipede!</p><p>Male and female Fire Jade Centipedes are quite different and easily distinguishable.</p><p>"A male! Could it be the one Di Que Lao Ren took from me?"</p><p>Qin Sang questioned.</p><p>Years ago, when he obtained the Fire Jade Centipede, it was only at the peak of its first stage. Even after over twenty years, it hadn't molted. Since the centipede hadn't bonded with him, he wasn't sure if it was the same one or a descendant of the original pair.</p><p>"All the insects were in Di Que Lao Ren's spirit beast pouch, destroyed by Xuan Yu Daozhang. I never imagined the Fire Jade Centipede survived. If only I'd come back to retrieve them earlier...Why isn't the female here?"</p><p>Qin Sang used his Tianmu divine ability to carefully investigate.</p><p>He ultimately confirmed there was only one.</p>
