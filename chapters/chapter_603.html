<h1>Chapter 596: The Gathering Shrine</h1><p>He had observed how the ancient teleportation formation was activated at the Shangyuan Tranquility Palace and remembered that they used medium-grade spirit stones. This one should be no different.</p><p>The formation before him seemed smaller and more complex than the one at Shangyuan Tranquility Palace, but the activation method should be similar.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Eight spirit stones landed in their respective grooves.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't held out much hope as he attempted to activate the runes on the ancient teleportation formation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the moment the last spirit stone fell, the altar trembled. The runes on the formation lit up rapidly, and the entire ancient hall began to hum.</p><p>The formation grew brighter, and a powerful spiritual wave emerged, threatening to erupt.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed. He immediately stopped the activation and forcibly retrieved the eight medium-grade spirit stones.</p><p>He had only wanted to try it out, but the formation was intact. Senior Qingzhu hadn't destroyed the other side after passing through.</p><p>Stepping onto the platform would teleport him, but Qin Sang abandoned the idea without hesitation.</p><p>This decision was easy. Qin Sang would definitely not leave the Small Cold Realm.</p><p>He hadn't yet obtained the Three-Light Jade Nectar, the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid was still in the Cloudmire Great Marsh, and he hadn't fulfilled his promise to Wanderer Yun. These were his hopes for Nascent Soul formation.</p><p>Moreover, after their warning, they helped the two realms withstand the Abyssal incursion and received promises from several Nascent Soul cultivators for their lifebound treasures.</p><p>His future was bright.</p><p>Leaving this advantageous situation for an unknown land would be foolish.</p><p>Although a great war was looming, once he left the Violet Firmament Palace, he could immediately form his Gold Core, escaping the fate of a cannon fodder and the precarious life of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p>Furthermore, his sect had two Nascent Soul experts.</p><p>As the saying goes, fortune favors the bold.</p><p>The war might even be an opportunity.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression flickered. He now suspected that the other side was not a safe place. Senior Qingzhu had either encountered danger or been trapped by something.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu had honed his swordsmanship and could easily perfect his Killing Talismans. With his talent, his chances of reaching Nascent Soul were very high.</p><p>Only two hundred years had passed since the last opening of the Violet Firmament Palace.</p><p>Leng Yuntian was still alive and well, and Granny Jing clearly had a close relationship with Senior Qingzhu.</p><p>Yet he had left, his vengeance unfulfilled and his loved ones waiting, never to return.</p><p>Given his usual behavior, this was clearly abnormal.</p><p>Qin Sang's current cultivation was too weak, far inferior to Senior Qingzhu's back then. Time was also short. Even if there were treasures on the other side, he couldn't go.</p><p>With that in mind, Qin Sang resolutely gave up, put away the spirit stones, and darted out of the ancient hall.</p><p>Wanderer Yun was waiting by the lake. Seeing Qin Sang return safely, he relaxed and came to greet him.</p><p>Qin Sang mentioned some things about the ancient hall, but Wanderer Yun knew nothing about them, much to his disappointment.</p><p>…</p><p>“The vegetation here is too lush; there must be a reason!”</p><p>Qin Sang stood on a mountaintop, pointing to a valley ahead.</p><p>The valley was wide and, like other places, covered in wild grass and ancient trees.</p><p>But upon closer inspection, the ancient trees here were exceptionally tall. The entire forest was almost level with the mountains on both sides. The oldest trees even surpassed the highest peaks, their enormous crowns like small hills.</p><p>Even the wild grass was unusually thick, almost like small trees, and the wildflowers were the size of washbasins.</p><p>The Violet Firmament Palace was rarely visited.  Though the vegetation in other areas was also lush, few places had so many towering ancient trees.</p><p>Wanderer Yun agreed, nodding. “Indeed, the vitality here is excessive. It’s likely due to the Three-Light Jade Nectar!  The Three-Light Jade Nectar gathers the essence of heaven and earth, brimming with vitality, hence its reputation as a healing panacea.  Even if the Three-Light Jade Nectar within the Gathering Shrine is well-sealed, after so many years, the surrounding life would inevitably be affected.”</p><p>“Yi Tiannie said the Gathering Shrine is hidden in the void. Many experts in the past noticed the unusual vegetation and turned the valley upside down, but they couldn't find the source.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the sky.</p><p>The Violet Firmament Palace had no day or night. The sea of clouds stretched endlessly, obscuring the sun, but the light in the sky was still dazzling.</p><p>Qin Sang squinted, gazing at the edge of the sea of clouds.</p><p>There, the clouds drifted, forming waves. Similar to the areas around the outer land fragments, turbulent currents existed.</p><p>The currents in the sea of clouds were even more terrifying, no less powerful than the罡 wind high in the sky. Even Nascent Soul cultivators dared not venture into them.</p><p>Fortunately, the Gathering Shrine was located at the lowest level of the turbulence, within their ability to withstand. However, deciphering the fragmented formation in such a place was even more difficult. It all depended on Wanderer Yun.</p><p>“So it's here, no wonder…”</p><p>Wanderer Yun glanced at the sky a couple of times and then confidently flew upwards, gesturing for Qin Sang to follow.</p><p>“The Gathering Shrine’s formation is fragmented, so it must have many cracks. Breaking it shouldn't be too difficult. Qin Sang, I need you to clear the path with your sword, following my guidance.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, unsealed his Corpse Core, transformed into a streak of sword light, and flew forward.</p><p>High in the sky, the view was much wider. The highest peak was the most prominent, piercing into the sea of clouds. Faint shimmering lights, like tiny specks, could be seen on the mountain.</p><p>He didn't know if someone had intruded or if it was always like that.</p><p>Within his sight, there were also several beams of light shooting into the sky. Just as Qin Sang flew up, he happened to see one of the beams extinguish, realizing that the restriction there might have been broken.</p><p>“Qin Sang, ten zhang to the right, thrust your sword at the Western Palace position!”</p><p>Following Wanderer Yun's guidance, Qin Sang immediately complied.</p><p>From Wanderer Yun’s words, the fragmented formation of the Gathering Shrine seemed to correspond to the constellations, but to Qin Sang, it was all chaos.</p><p>According to Yi Tiannie's memories, he could only use brute force to enter the fragmented formation and then look for weaknesses, which involved many variables.</p><p>But Wanderer Yun seemed confident, giving precise instructions.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang shifted ten zhang and thrust his sword towards the sky.</p><p>It appeared to be empty space, but the moment the Ebony Sword struck, a star-like crack appeared, flashing and disappearing.</p><p>In the next moment, both sword and man vanished.</p><p>The Violet Firmament Palace disappeared from view.</p><p>Surrounded by endless darkness, he could vaguely see a few faint lights in the distance. Without any reference points above, below, left, or right, he felt a sense of panic, an urge to approach those lights.</p><p>Qin Sang channeled his sword Qi to protect them both as he looked around in confusion.</p><p>He knew he was inside the formation and that there were many weaknesses, but finding a way to break it instantly was beyond his capabilities.</p><p>Wanderer Yun calculated with his fingers, his eyes sharp as a hawk, fixated on the cluster of distant lights.</p><p>He pointed at the lights and said in a deep voice, “That should be the Kui Mansion position. The formation’s eye is currently there, the key to breaking it. Now that it's fragmented, it's even easier. Let's go.”</p>
