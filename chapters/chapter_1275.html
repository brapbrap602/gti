<h1>Chapter 1267: A Battle to the Death</h1><p>The piercing sound of sword resonance filled the air, omnipresent and unrelenting.</p><p>The Ebony Sword transformed into a sword formation, the Seven Souls Slaughter Array, swirling and sealing off the Blood Demon Avatar. The Blood Demon Avatar neither dodged nor evaded. The Blood Moon Wheel hovered above its head, its crimson light flickering incessantly. Unaware that Qin Sang had already expended his Blood Filth Divine Light, the avatar remained cautious while wielding its treasure.</p><p>A curtain of blood cascaded from the Blood Moon Wheel, enveloping the avatar's body, rendering sword energy unable to penetrate. Having experienced the might of the Seven Souls Sword Formation before, the Blood Demon Avatar had some understanding of how to counter it.</p><p>The sword formation's relentless assault yielded no results.</p><p>Qin Sang's incantation shifted, and the sword formation was withdrawn. The Ebony Sword flew back into his hand, followed by the surging Nine Nether Demonic Flames, which roared forth like a ferocious dragon.</p><p>Upon contact with the Nine Nether Demonic Flames, the Blood Demon Avatar sensed impending doom. In the past, Qin Sang had wielded the Twelve Demon Banners, and while the demonic flames he summoned were formidable, they paled in comparison to what he now unleashed. The Blood Demon Avatar felt a lethal threat!</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar, a seasoned veteran of countless battles, quickly discerned that Qin Sang's control over the demonic flames was still somewhat unrefined, indicating that he had yet to fully master them. As long as the avatar could exploit this weakness and avoid being trapped by the flames, it believed it could survive.</p><p>Yet, it could not afford to retreat, for doing so would bring greater trouble to its true form. The Blood Demon Avatar's heart sank. The only option now was to fight to the death!</p><p>'Buzz...'</p><p>The Blood Moon Wheel resembled the eye of a blood sea, unleashing an endless torrent of crimson light. In an instant, the area around the Blood Demon Avatar transformed into a vast ocean of blood. Its figure vanished into the heart of the blood sea, as layers of real blood light surged upward, accompanied by deafening roars.</p><p>Even the surrounding blood mist and the blood from the blood pool were drawn into the blood sea. The accumulated blood energy was absorbed by the crimson light, amplifying its power.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang hurriedly activated the demon banners. The eighteen banners grew rapidly, each reaching a height of three zhang, standing tall in the void and spinning rapidly around Qin Sang. Streams of demonic flames shot out, spreading across the sky, their black flames fiercely burning at the edges of the blood sea, consuming the crimson light.</p><p>The blood sea's waves rose and fell, while the demonic flames possessed the power to scorch the heavens and boil the seas. The battlefield's intensity soared to its peak, surpassing even the clashes between Tongyou Demon Lord and Tianzheng Elder.</p><p>Sensing the situation, the onlookers turned their attention to the scene. Ye Laomo, the Blood Demon Avatar's true form, had long been renowned, so it was no surprise that even an avatar possessed such strength. But how long had this Moonlight Demon King been in his transformed state? He had first slain a Nascent Soul cultivator, then caused chaos in the Abyssal Ruins, and even escaped from Ye Laomo's grasp. His feats had already left his peers in awe and shame.</p><p>Now, wielding demonic flames with such terrifying force, he was actually overpowering the Blood Demon Avatar! At this level, every step forward was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. In just a few short years, this demon had made such rapid progress, suppressing the Blood Demon Avatar. It was truly shocking.</p><p>How could the onlookers not be astonished? They silently marveled that the Coldfrost Domain had produced another rising star. Given a few more years, he might even surpass Ye Laomo in fame.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Where the demonic flames clashed with the blood sea, waves of fire and blood surged into the sky, only to be blocked by the ancient restrictions of the blood pool. Otherwise, the impact would have been far greater.</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar was in a dire predicament. The eighteen demon banners were the most powerful treasures it had ever encountered. It had no idea where this brat had obtained them. Under the onslaught of the demonic flames, the crimson light shattered, and even the Blood Moon Wheel struggled to endure.</p><p>Qin Sang sneered. During his battle with Dongyang Bo, the eighteen demon banners had proven their might. If not for Dongyang Bo's hidden escape method, he would have been reduced to ashes by the demonic flames, his regrets buried in the river of blood!</p><p>Though the Blood Demon Avatar was strong, it was no match for the eighteen demon banners. Moreover, its goal differed from Dongyang Bo'sâ€”it sought only to delay Qin Sang, clashing head-on with the demonic flames. The question was, how long could it hold out?</p><p>The Blood Moon Wheel trembled violently, enduring a terrifying impact. The Blood Demon Avatar's fingers moved like wheels, rapidly forming seals. Blood energy surged within its body, condensing into strange patterns that flew toward the Blood Moon Wheel. With the avatar's support, the Blood Moon Wheel stabilized momentarily, but the respite was short-lived, and it soon began to falter again.</p><p>Seeing this, the Blood Demon Avatar realized its plan had failed. The demonic flames were too powerful. If this continued, the Blood Moon Wheel would collapse before Qin Sang's true energy was depleted.</p><p>After all, the Blood Demon Avatar was merely an avatar. Its true form could only spare limited treasures for it. The Coldblood Divine Needle had failed, and the Blood Moon Wheel, which it had refined for years, was no match for the demonic flames. Its other treasures were even less effective.</p><p>For the first time, the Blood Demon Avatar felt utterly outmatched. It sighed inwardly, then suddenly closed its eyes and formed a peculiar seal with its hands.</p><p>In the next moment, a brilliant crimson light erupted from the Blood Demon Avatar's body.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar suddenly vanished, splitting into three blood shadows. This was a secret blood technique, similar to the Demonic Disintegration Art, with a tremendous cost. However, the three blood shadows worked together to activate the Blood Moon Wheel, stabilizing it against the demonic flames' assault.</p><p>Qin Sang was inwardly alarmed. Ye Laomo's methods were endless, and even an avatar was this difficult to deal with. How strong was the true form? Could his senior sister withstand it?</p><p>Though anxious, Qin Sang had no other options. The eighteen demon banners were his strongest weapon. If even they couldn't force the Blood Demon Avatar to retreat, nothing else would.</p><p>However, such a disintegration technique would surely drain its potential and severely damage its vitality. It couldn't last long.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately poured all his spiritual sense and true energy into the eighteen demon banners, pushing them to their limits. The demonic flames surged higher and higher, crashing relentlessly against the crimson light.</p><p>'Rumble...'</p><p>Qin Sang, along with the demon banners, plunged into the demonic flames, charging forward.</p><p>Before long, the three blood shadows began to waver.</p><p>The Blood Demon Avatar was still fighting desperately.</p><p>At that moment, a sudden disturbance arose at the center of the blood pool.</p><p>With a loud 'splash,' a figure burst out of the water.</p><p>The unexpected turn of events caught everyone off guard, their attention immediately drawn to the figure. It seemed the battle beneath the blood pool had reached its conclusion, but who had emerged victorious?</p><p>However, when they saw the figure's appearance, everyone was stunned.</p><p>It was a desiccated jade skeleton!</p><p>"Is this the ancient cultivator who has survived until now? How bizarre! How could he still be alive? What about the three who went down earlier? Could they all have been killed by the ancient cultivator..."</p><p>The onlookers saw only the jade skeleton, with no sign of Ye Laomo or the others. They were horrified.</p><p>The ancient cultivator's abilities were unfathomable.</p><p>The Sin Abyss had mobilized its forces for two reasons: to jointly break the seal and the Blood Gate, and to prevent the ancient cultivator from turning on them after being released. They hadn't expected the Coldfrost Domain to interfere, leaving only Ye Laomo to infiltrate the blood pool alone.</p><p>Had their worst fear come to pass?</p><p>Both sides were uneasy.</p><p>Soon, several beams of light followed the jade skeleton out of the pool. Upon closer inspection, they were the Five Directions Pagoda, the Yin-Yang Twin Halberds, and the Thunder Thought Pearl, among other treasures.</p><p>The treasures circled the jade skeleton, locked in a fierce struggle.</p><p>The jade skeleton remained seated in a meditative posture, motionless, allowing the treasures to pull it around in their conflict. There was no sign of revival.</p><p>Seeing this, the onlookers breathed a sigh of relief, but their confusion only deepened.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>I got home late yesterday. There's more to come soon.</p>
