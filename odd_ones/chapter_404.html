      The identification mage was staying at a small villa far away
                from the city. Han Xiao found the place easily and pressed on
                the doorbell.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After a while, the door opened. An old Godoran walked out and
                looked at Han Xiao puzzled.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Who’re you?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Hello, Master Angleton. I have come to you for help after
                hearing about you. I hope that you can help me open an item with
                magic security measures.” Han Xiao recognized this person as the
                target, so he went straight to the point.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      To his surprise, Angleton was confused. “It has only been three
                months since I moved here. I did not notify anyone yet, how did
                you find me?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was stunned for a second, then he realized. At this
                period, the players in his previous life were still in their
                novice planets. He was too ahead of time. Luckily, Angleton had
                moved here this early, or it would have been awkward if he could
                not find him.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Angleton could not figure out why but did not dwell on it. He
                invited Han Xiao into his house and said while he was walking,
                “You’re the first customer after I moved house. It has
                commemorative significance. I think I should write this day in
                my diary. Uninvited surprise guest, what do I call you?”
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Call me Han Xiao.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Today is the official opening. To celebrate my first business,
                I will help you as much as I can…” Angleton smiled.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The inside of the villa was very luxurious. The two of them came
                to the basement, and there were many magic tools here. Quite a
                number of magic arrays were embedded on the wall and the floor.
                There were also many precise instruments to research and analyze
                magics.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After Han Xiao paid the fees, Angleton placed the Secret Message
                Bead inside the analytical magic array, flipped open his thick
                magic book, and started channeling.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Ding.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The seal of the Secret Message Bead appeared in the air.
                Angleton wore his reading glasses, narrowed his eyes, and
                observed it. He drew magic lines on the array from time to time,
                solving it bit by bit, just like opening a lock.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Mage class and Mechanic class were known as the vastest and
                complicated classes. There were many types of machinery, ranging
                from nanotechnology to battleships, from nuclear weapons to
                psionic canons, from internet technology to artificial
                intelligence. It was very versatile and mostly about technology.
                The branches of the Mage class were very complicated as well.
                There was elemental, secret sorcery, blessing, spacetime, shape
                manipulation, summoning, curse, and so on.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Mages could learn spells from multiple branches—it had no
                limitations. They could use ice and fire at the same time if
                they wanted to. Like Mechanics spending experience to gamble on
                blueprints, Mages had to spend experience to learn spells as
                well. As long as they had enough experience, they could learn as
                many as they wanted. However, to players, there were differences
                between these two. For a Mage to learn a spell, the spell was
                divided into different ‘stages’. For example, learning Fire
                Blast required three stages, and every stage cost experience.
                The higher the stage, the more it would cost. If a certain stage
                failed, one had to use experience and try to learn that stage
                again. When all the stages were completed, the mage would
                officially be able to use that spell—meaning, the mage would get
                a new ability.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The success rate of learning spells depended on Intelligence and
                Mystic. The higher the spell grade, the more stages it has. It
                was also very experience consuming. It was relatively easier for
                higher level Mages to learn low-level spells, and it would be
                very difficult the other way around. Plus, high-level spells
                usually had prerequisites, such as learning a certain low-level
                spell or attributes reaching a certain value.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The differences between spell branches were like the differences
                between machinery types, which was a difference in ability
                choices. In terms of class focus, the Mechanic class had Cannon
                Master, Mechanical Pugilist, Mechanic, and so on. The Mage class
                also had different focuses. The class difference in the Mechanic
                class was decided afterward, but in the case of the Mage class,
                it was decided beforehand. The method of awakening decided their
                path. The first method was awakening Super genes of a Mage
                normally—those people are born with magic power or those able to
                activate their magic power through meditation would become
                official Mages. These were the talented ones.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The second method was for those that could not activate magic
                power or even had no Mage talent at all. Through planting magic
                circuitry in their body, there was a chance to generate magic
                power, granting them the qualifications to be a Mage. This was
                similar to the Esper class, in which some Espers could
                self-awaken and some needed Gene Awakening Elixir. The magic
                circuitry planted into their bodies was the source of magic
                power; it required continuous enhancement and strengthening. The
                biggest difference between circuit mages and talented mages was
                that circuit mages were unable to learn all spells, as circuits
                usually had certain tendencies. They could only be specialized
                Mages, as the foundation could not be changed once it was
                planted, so there was only one chance to choose a circuit.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Of course, as the saying goes, knowing one thing very well is
                better than knowing many things a little.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Specialized Mages were not weak. Instead, they were the
                majority. After all, one’s energy was limited, so it was better
                to focus on one instead of not focusing on everything. In fact,
                there were even some talented Mages who planted circuit in
                themselves and became specialized Mages afterward. As circuit
                was equivalent to an enhancement to that certain type of magic,
                it meant to give up all-round capabilities in exchange for
                strong spell powers. Goa, for example, was a specialized Mage, a
                pure Ice Mage.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      There was another special type of Mage, called the MagicNet
                Mage. Their magic power did not belong to themselves; rather, it
                was ‘borrowed’ through religion, praying, ceremony, and all
                kinds of strange methods to come in contact with magic entities
                of other dimensions—usually of unspeakable appearance. They
                would then form a contract or deed. They could not learn spells;
                they could only use spells given by that magic entity. Most of
                these spells did not cost mana but had a limit to how many times
                they could be used per day. In other words, they had a cooldown
                but had no mana cost. The way for them to become stronger was to
                enhance their connection with the magic entity or to create
                contracts with more magic entities, granting them more spells
                and higher usages.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The Great Mechanic Han played a Mage class in his previous life
                before. It required very high skills, emphasizing on creating
                combos by using all kinds of spells, and it had countless
                combinations. It was the complete opposite of the simple and
                brutal Pugilist class. When battling other players, one had to
                pay attention to details and make a lot of calculations. It was
                very suitable for technical players with good brains… Oh, that
                was except for Fire Blast Style and Summoning Style—these two
                were more brainless than Pugilist. There was no need for any
                analysis or whatsoever—they just have to finish their mana bar,
                and there would barely be anyone standing.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      With a cup of magic coconut tea in his hands, Han Xiao sat at
                the side and waited for many hours. He almost fell asleep.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Clank!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In midair, the magic seal array was finally cracked as it
                shattered like a mirror.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “It’s done.” Angleton took off his glasses.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Let me see what on earth is inside…” Han Xiao took back the
                Secret Message Bead, took a deep breath, and slowly turned it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Without the seal, the Secret Message Bead was easily split in
                half. A mini vacuum glass cabinet was fixed to each side. These
                two things both had a shrinking spell on them, which was why
                they could fit in such a small bead.

      “Holy… It’s these two things!” Han Xiao’s breathing stopped for
                a moment. His eyes were fixed on these things. He finally
                understood why DarkStar had spent so much effort in tracking
                this down. The significance of these two things was beyond
                ordinary—he had almost snatched DarkStar’s lifeblood away!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      These two things were connected to two huge conspiracies of
                DarkStar—they were the origin of two big events! One of them was
                Planet Aquamarine’s main storyline in Version 2.0—Mutation
                Disaster!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He had a flash of insight and connected the dots.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       DarkStar bought these items from another organization. The
                  seller is outside Shattered Star Ring, so they chose to send
                  one of their subordinates to deliver the goods, who happened
                  to be a Silver. He followed a tourist group here and planned
                  to deliver the goods secretly. However, just as the Silvers
                  were having a tour, they were suddenly robbed by slavers. The
                  carrier was unlucky as hell, and that forced DarkStar to come
                  and find the goods. Then, coincidentally, the other Silvers
                  hired us… They did not know about the deal behind this.
                  Everything that happened was because of the first
                  accident.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was astonished. Through many coincidences, he had
                ruined DarkStar’s secret deal and robbed them of the goods that
                they had spent an outrageous amount of money to buy!
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Secret organizations selling this kind of product were like arms
                dealers. DarkStar itself did not have the technology to research
                new ‘weapons’—they could only buy them. The Mutation Source was
                already generation seven, so it had definitely been tested in
                another place before.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      As these thoughts flashed through his mind, more than one
                notification of triggering a new mission popped up in the
                interface.

       The Main Storyline mission of the next version!
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao’s eyes sparkled in surprise. He did not expect to
                trigger the main storyline of Version 2.0 in advance.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The main storyline mission of the Mutation Disaster was not an
                individual mission but a mission carried out by all players.
                Planet Aquamarine needed thirty million progress points, and
                every player’s actions would be added into the progress. There
                were many stages of the Mutation Disaster, and the virus would
                grow, causing the progress to drop by large portions. The
                mission requirement was to complete the requirements before the
                virus grew into its unstoppable mature stage. It required all
                players to work together.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       This mission is different from the one players would receive.
                  I remember that the players’ mission is just to protect Planet
                  Aquamarine, but my target includes other planets as well… Is
                  it because I got the Mutation Source?
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao was a little surprised. This was a good thing; it gave
                him more choices. Of course, he was definitely going to protect
                Planet Aquamarine first. Not only was it his home, but it was
                also for the players of the next version.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The status of the mission at this moment was frozen. Only when
                the timeline reached Version 2.0 and the disaster broke out
                would the mission start. What he was thinking was how to make
                full use of the Mutation Source in his hands in order to achieve
                the biggest impact.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       The key component of solving the Mutation Disaster is Godora.
                  In my previous life, Godora took a very long time to invent
                  the cure. If I give them the mutation source, they will be
                  able to invent the cure earlier…
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao contemplated on the issue. This was probably the best
                way to maximize the use of the mutation source. However, he had
                to think of when he should give it to Godora. If he gave it to
                them too early, the contribution points would not be counted
                into the mission, and he would be suspected too.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He searched through his memories and had a rough plan. The
                details had to be improved, but he let it aside for the moment.
                He looked at the other two new missions.
