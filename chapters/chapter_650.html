<h1>Chapter 642: The Dusk Bug</h1><p>Qin Sang was searching for a type of spirit insect called the Dusk Bug.  Resembling ordinary bugs, it thrives in dark, damp environments, feeding on Yin energy, hence its name.</p><p>After leaving the Xiong Mountain region, Qin Sang adopted a disguise, visited several market towns, and contacted various factions to gather information.  He ultimately selected nine spirit insects as targets.</p><p>Five were from the Extraordinary Insect List.  For some, he knew their cultivation methods; for others, he didn't.  However, Qin Sang possessed the Red Fire Gilded Metal, so he wasn't overly concerned at least until the third transformation. The abilities of these insects were extremely unique and quite appealing.</p><p>The other four were ordinary spirit insects with lower potential but powerful abilities.  They could greatly assist him at the Nascent Soul stage, serving as a fallback option.</p><p>The rumors and records he collected weren't necessarily reliable.  The insects might have migrated, encountered predators, been captured, or even undergone transformation and left their habitat—all were possibilities.</p><p>Qin Sang felt that finding even one of these nine insects would be a great success. His standards were high, and he was prepared to invest considerable time and effort in the search.</p><p>The Dusk Bug was one of the six extraordinary insects.  Highly regarded on the Extraordinary Insect List, its abilities in the first two transformations were unremarkable, like most insects.  Only in the third transformation, and even more so afterwards, did it undergo a dramatic change.</p><p>After its third transformation, the Dusk Bug could transform its internal Yin energy into a black sword, incredibly fast and as sharp as a genuine magic treasure sword.  What's more, when inactive, it gave off no discernible aura.  Inaction was stillness; action was like a thunderbolt!</p><p>For a spirit insect cultivator, possessing a third-stage Dusk Bug was like having an extremely sharp hidden sword that didn't consume the cultivator's own spiritual energy, making it extremely difficult to guard against.</p><p>Qin Sang greatly desired it.  Therefore, it was his first target.</p><p>However, the Dusk Bug ranked lower than the Ghost-headed Bee on the Witch Insect List, near the very bottom.  No one dared to choose it as their life-bound insect. This was because its transformation was exceptionally difficult, its lifespan was long, and its growth was slow.  Without the proper method, a Nascent Soul cultivator might never see their Dusk Bug reach the third transformation in their lifetime.</p><p>Among the several spirit insect cultivation methods Qin Sang possessed was one for the Dusk Bug.  The Spirit Controlling Sect had found an incomplete method from an ancient cultivator's texts.  It required several Yin-cold spirit pills used in combination to increase the Dusk Bug's growth rate several times over.</p><p>A cultivator once saw a second-stage Dusk Bug in this wasteland, but before they could react, the Dusk Bug disappeared into an underground cave.  This was the only lead Qin Sang had.  To catch the Dusk Bug, he had to find the cave first.</p><p>"I've searched almost the entire wasteland, and still haven't found the cave?  Did an earthquake change the terrain?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, his gaze sweeping across the vast wasteland. He decided to change direction.</p><p>A few steps later, Qin Sang paused with a soft "Hm?"  He then leaped a thousand meters to the left with a flash of his sword, hanging in the air and looking down.</p><p>"Found it!"</p><p>Overgrown weeds completely concealed the cave entrance. Qin Sang was about to use his sword to cut through, but he changed his mind, sheathing his ebony sword and silently entering the cave.</p><p>The cave was extremely deep.  It took a full incense stick's worth of time for Qin Sang to reach a subterranean chasm.  The cold was intense—perfect for the Dusk Bug.</p><p>However, upon seeing the chasm, Qin Sang began to have a headache.  The scale was enormous, with countless branches—even more complex than the Earth-sinking Cave of Mount Shaohua.  Searching for a tiny Dusk Bug in such a place was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Flying Night Fork couldn't stray too far from him; otherwise, splitting up would improve efficiency.</p><p>Dusk Bugs preferred cold, Yin environments, and the stronger they became, the more pronounced this preference was. Qin Sang decided to go straight to the deepest part of the cave.</p><p>He summoned the Flying Night Fork and rapidly descended.  The bottom grew increasingly colder and more eerie.  Feeling it was about right, Qin Sang took out several vials from his Qianjun Ring, containing powders and liquids, and scattered them along the way.</p><p>These were insect-luring secret medicines—some bought from Witch cultivators, others self-brewed based on the Spirit Controlling Sect's formulas. He'd prepared many.</p><p>This method worked on some spirit insects, though he wasn't certain it would lure the Dusk Bug; it was worth a try.</p><p>The Yin cold became terrifying, threatening to penetrate his bone marrow.  Forced to activate his true energy to protect himself, Qin Sang descended further, and heard the sound of flowing water below.</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.  Upon closer inspection, he found that Yin energy had mixed with an underground river, turning the water gray and preventing it from freezing.</p><p>Standing by the dark river, Qin Sang looked upward.</p><p>All the way down, he had scattered over a dozen vials of insect-luring medicine, but hadn't attracted a single spirit insect.</p><p>This was good news.</p><p>Except in special circumstances, each spirit insect possesses its own territory, and doesn't allow other insects to intrude.  The presence of other insects would mean that the Mingchun was gone.</p><p>Qin Sang observed the underground environment, and began to search along the dark river, using his spiritual sense in conjunction with the insect-luring medicine, not missing a single corner.</p><p>The cavern was like a huge maze. Qin Sang searched for a whole day, but found nothing.</p><p>Finally, Qin Sang gave up and returned to his starting point.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at a protruding rock by the dark river. After carefully examining the surrounding terrain, he had a thought, and his Flying Night Rakshasa dived into the river and hid at the bottom.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang took a jade vial from his Qianjun Ring.</p><p>The vial contained a crimson viscous liquid, extremely thick, like a ruby, shining with a captivating luster.  Within the liquid, golden gleams occasionally flashed, strangely unusual.</p><p>This was the fruit of the Crimson Gold Vine, the Crimson Fire Gilded!</p><p>Spirit insects were hard to find in the Xiao Han region. After obtaining the Crimson Fire Gilded, Qin Sang had not found an opportunity to use it, storing it until now.  Now, finally, it was time to put it to use.</p><p>The reason Qin Sang dared to venture alone into the Western Frontier to search for insects based on flimsy rumors was because of this item.</p><p>The Crimson Fire Gilded can help spirit insects undergo metamorphosis, and is extremely attractive to them, more effective than any insect-luring medicine. This was an advantage that others didn't have.</p><p>Since those insect-luring medicines were useless, Qin Sang could only use the Crimson Fire Gilded.</p><p>Not much was needed; it was enough to simply release its scent.</p><p>Simultaneously, Qin Sang opened the insect basket at his waist and took out several Ghost Head Bee larvae.</p><p>The larvae of other spirit insects are also excellent lures, especially larvae that have undergone bloodline mutation; their allure is even stronger. Combining the two, Qin Sang didn't believe that the Mingchun could remain unmoved.</p><p>Currently, Qin Sang had lost interest in cultivating Blood Winged Ghost Head Bees.</p><p>Having lost their potential for metamorphosis, no matter how many Blood Winged Ghost Head Bees he had, they could only threaten Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>Qin Sang mobilized his true energy, grabbed the Blood Winged Ghost Head Bee larvae, erased their consciousness, and then carefully opened the vial, drawing out a trace of the Crimson Fire Gilded to apply to them.</p><p>He flung several into the distance, keeping one with the most Crimson Fire Gilded applied, placing it on the stone platform.</p>
