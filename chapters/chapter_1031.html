<h1>Chapter 1023 Ancient Demons</h1><p>“Ask her to demonstrate the transformations of the Demonic Wings,” Bai transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang complied.</p><p>Su Nü was secretly surprised, unable to guess why Qin Sang was so fixated on the Demonic Wings and seemed to understand them so well.</p><p>She dared not disobey Qin Sang's order, steadied her breath, and activated the Demonic Wings. Sometimes they transformed into escaping light for swift flight, and sometimes they wrapped around her body like bone armor.</p><p>……</p><p>“I remember now. Many of the enemies who sealed me had similar Demonic Wings. They were called Demons. Not Demonic Cultivators, but true Demons.</p><p>“Demonic Qi is to them what spiritual energy is to cultivators.</p><p>“The Demonic Restrictions and Demonic Fire were left by the Demons.</p><p>“Demons are our greatest enemies.</p><p>“To combat the Demons, our human cultivators tried to analyze the captured Demonic techniques and discovered that a small number of cultivators with special physiques could directly cultivate Demonic techniques. But I don't recall any 'True Demonic Arts.' Perhaps my memory is incomplete, or perhaps the name has been corrupted over time.”</p><p>Bai's voice was low. He paused, then continued, “However, ancient Demons have long since vanished from the world, so what cultivation technique it is doesn't matter anymore. This girl likely possesses a special spiritual body that allows her to cultivate Demonic techniques using Demonic Qi. I'm very confused right now and need to sort things out…”</p><p>After that, Bai fell silent.</p><p>After breaking the Demonic Restriction, Bai recovered more and more memories, until today, when he finally remembered the great enemy that had sealed them away.</p><p>“Ancient Demons…”</p><p>Qin Sang fell into deep thought.</p><p>He had traveled the cultivation world for many years and had rarely heard any rumors related to ancient Demons.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Qin Sang suddenly recalled something.</p><p>“The Abyss of Sin! When I entered the Purple Star Palace, the Abyss of Sin launched a sneak attack, and a terrifying six-armed demonic shadow appeared. Its size was beyond imagination, and its power was astonishing. Could it have been an ancient Demon?”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly alarmed, and a sense of worry arose in his heart.</p><p>He didn't know whether returning to the Small Cold Realm was a good thing or a bad thing this time.</p><p>One must know that the ancient cultivation world was far superior to the present one, with legends of Grand Completion stage cultivators ascending to immortality. The cultivation and power of cultivators back then were unimaginable today.</p><p>Ancient Demons existed in Bai's era and were powerful enough to be considered the greatest enemies of cultivators. A single Demonic Restriction was enough to seal Bai and his subordinates, condemning them to eternal imprisonment. This showed how terrifying their power was.</p><p>If the Abyss of Sin was conspiring with ancient Demons, could the Small Cold Realm and the Heavenly Travel Alliance withstand them with their combined strength? After returning, he hoped he wouldn’t receive news of the two realms' destruction.</p><p>When the nest is overturned, no eggs remain intact.</p><p>If something were to happen to the Small Cold Realm, his friends and acquaintances would likely face a grim fate.</p><p>But regardless, he had to return to retrieve the Nine Phantasmal Sky Orchid. With his strength, as long as he remained low-key and focused on self-preservation, he shouldn't have to worry too much.</p><p>He would observe the situation before deciding whether to stay in the Small Cold Realm or return to the Boundless Sea.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed inwardly, collected his thoughts, and noticed Su Nü looking at him cautiously.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Qin Sang opened his mouth, about to say something, but then furrowed his brow and turned to look into the distance.</p><p>In the next moment, two streaks of light appeared at the edge of the ice plain. Two people were flying towards them. Judging by their speed, they should both be late-stage Core Formation cultivators.</p><p>“My senior brothers are here!”</p><p>Su Nü said joyfully. Seeing Qin Sang's frowning and silent expression, her heart tightened, and she quickly suppressed her joy. “Fellow Daoist, please rest assured, they are my senior brothers and have always been very protective of me.”</p><p>People from the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang gave Su Nü a deep look.</p><p>Their purpose was very clear, heading straight in this direction. It seemed that this woman must have something on her that could guide them.</p><p>Since Bai had recovered some of his memories, there was no point in staying here. If he wanted to inquire about the origins of this Demonic technique, he would probably have to find the leader of the East Pole Alliance.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't want to encounter the people from the East Pole Alliance. Without saying anything further, he slightly flapped his phoenix wings, and his figure transformed into a streak of escaping light, heading in the opposite direction.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Qin Sang became a green dot of light, disappearing into the vast ice plain.</p><p>Su Nü didn't expect Qin Sang to fly away so abruptly without a word. She stared blankly in the direction he had left, blinking her eyes with a strange expression.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>Two figures flew over and landed on either side of Su Nü.</p><p>One was a tall, strong man, and the other looked somewhat old, with the appearance of a man in his fifties, a long beard hanging from his chin.</p><p>“Whew!”</p><p>The strong man let out a long breath, his breath somewhat unsteady. He complained, “Junior Sister, you really made Senior Brother and me search for a while. Didn’t we tell you to find a safe place to wait for us and not wander off alone? Why did you run so far?”</p><p>The long-bearded elder narrowed his eyes, looking in the direction Qin Sang had disappeared, and said in a deep voice, “Junior Sister, who was that person just now? Did he do anything to you?”</p><p>“Senior Brother, you misunderstood. It was all thanks to that fellow Daoist's help that I survived…”</p><p>Su Nü explained the whole story.</p><p>The two of them suddenly understood.</p><p>The strong man felt a lingering fear. “That was close! That was close! I wonder which sect that fellow Daoist belongs to. We should report back to Master and the Alliance Leader and thank him properly!”</p><p>Su Nü shook her head regretfully. “That person didn't want to reveal his identity. I don't know his background.”</p><p>“In the Trial Realm, we are all rivals, so it's normal to be cautious. We will meet again if fate allows. Just keep it in mind, Junior Sister,” the long-bearded elder comforted her, then seemed to remember something. “Why hasn't Third Junior Brother arrived yet?”</p><p>Third Junior Brother was the handsome young man killed by Su Nü.</p><p>Su Nü's expression remained unchanged, and she said calmly, “I was being chased by fierce beasts and ran all the way here without seeing Third Senior Brother. Perhaps he was delayed by something.”</p><p>The two of them didn't suspect anything and looked around for a while, but saw no one.</p><p>The long-bearded elder said, “The three of us should be able to move freely in the Profound Ice Plain now. There's no need to wait here. Let's keep moving while we wait for Junior Brother to join us. Junior Sister, you should heal your injuries first. We'll keep watch.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Su Nü replied obediently, glanced in the direction Qin Sang had disappeared, and followed them.</p><p>……</p><p>Regardless of how Su Nü and the others discussed him,</p><p>Qin Sang flew for a certain distance, summoned the Ebony Sword to clear the path, and released the White Crane as well.</p><p>The deeper into the Profound Ice Plain he went, the more difficult it became to travel.</p><p>However, Qin Sang still successfully crossed the ice plain and completed the second trial.</p><p>Straight ahead,</p><p>A faint light barrier blocked his path. Qin Sang paused, recalled the White Crane, deactivated his Demonic Transformation, and walked forward.</p><p>Passing through the light barrier, the extreme cold disappeared.</p><p>Qin Sang found himself in a square courtyard, filled with stone benches and chairs. Several cultivators were currently resting and recuperating there.</p><p>Sensing Qin Sang's arrival, someone opened their eyes, sized him up for a moment, then closed their eyes again, focusing on their recovery.</p><p>“These people are considered the first echelon…”</p><p>Qin Sang observed them secretly. Indeed, everyone's aura was very strong, among the best of the cultivators.</p><p>“I don't see any Nascent Soul Grandmasters. It seems that the trials for the two groups of cultivators are separate. That's more reasonable. Otherwise, who would dare to compete with a Nascent Soul cultivator?”</p>
