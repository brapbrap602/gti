<h1>Chapter 164: Protection of the Treasure</h1><p>What is this fragment, and why is it on Sky Peak?</p><p>What does the gray mist have to do with it?</p><p>Qin Sang was full of questions.</p><p>He didn't even know how the gray mist appeared in his dantian.</p><p>Just now, when he tried to touch the fragment with his spiritual power, not only was it not repelled, but he felt a faint sense of connection.  Coupled with the ancient character 'kill' on the fragment, it made him think of certain things.</p><p>Both he and Qing Zhu cultivated the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture."</p><p>Judging from the first seven levels of the Celestial Tower, the remaining sword intent here is inextricably linked to the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture."</p><p>Could Senior Qing Zhu have discovered some incredible secret?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, considering various possibilities, but couldn't reach a conclusion.</p><p>The fragment was crucial to Senior Qing Zhu. Ning Wu Hui wouldn't possibly hand it over to him for casual study.  Given the uncertain situation, Qin Sang didn't want to reveal the existence of the gray mist in his dantian.</p><p>He needed to see Senior Qing Zhu to understand.</p><p>He glanced at Ning Wu Hui, walked to the edge of the earthen platform, and gazed into the Nether Valley.</p><p>If he had the opportunity to come here alone later, he wanted to explore the valley and see what was down there. However, Qin Sang understood that even a foreign Nascent Soul cultivator struggled, so his chances were slim.</p><p>Before long, Ning Wu Hui finished refining the medicinal power.</p><p>Just when Qin Sang thought he would return the same way and go elsewhere, Ning Wu Hui turned and walked towards the stone wall at the end of Nether Valley. After searching for a moment, he summoned his Crimson Gold Spiritual Sword, and a faint sword energy sliced into the stone wall.</p><p>Immediately, the Crimson Gold Spiritual Sword blazed with light, enveloping the two of them. In a flash, they disappeared into the stone wall.</p><p>The next moment, Qin Sang and Ning Wu Hui appeared inside a hall.</p><p>Qin Sang turned his head, surprised to find that there was no stone wall behind him, but a solid wall. There was no exit on the wall, nor could he sense any fluctuations of a restriction. It was very strange.</p><p>At that moment, the spiritual energy in the void suddenly went wild.</p><p>Without any warning, thunder exploded, and in an instant, streaks of light flashed like meteors, resembling terrifying sword energy. The hall was filled with sword energy, each one aimed at the two of them.</p><p>The oppressive force of the sword energy, like a landslide and tsunami, swept over them.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled, his scalp tingling.</p><p>Before he could react,</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>A clear sword cry rang out.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui tossed the Crimson Gold Spiritual Sword upwards. It hung upside down above his head, the blade spinning. Sword light flickered, and sword energy shot out like raindrops, disappearing into the void.</p><p>The sound of the sword cry seemed to resonate with the void. The sword energy merged with the streaks of light, and the strange phenomenon slowly dissipated, returning to silence.</p><p>Qin Sang was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>A look of astonishment appeared in his eyes.</p><p>The streaks of light in the void were likely remnants of ancient restrictions within the hall or sword intent left behind by ancient sword cultivators.  They were triggered by the two uninvited guests, attacking the intruders with astonishing momentum.</p><p>The moment the sword energy appeared, Qin Sang felt a tremor. The sword intent contained within these sword energies seemed to originate from the same source as the "Soul Nurturing Sword Scripture."</p><p>Similar to the Ancient Sword Hall in front of the Purple Star Palace's ancient teleportation formation, but even more terrifying. If the sword energy in the hall were to fully erupt, Qin Sang suspected even a Nascent Soul ancestor wouldn't survive, likely to be riddled with wounds and turned into a bloody mess.</p><p>He was about to summon his Ebony Sword, hoping to gain the recognition of the sword energy, but Ning Wu Hui acted first, resolving the crisis.</p><p>The sword energy dissipated, and the hall returned to normal.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to move around randomly and observed his surroundings. Ning Wu Hui, however, seemed to have anticipated this, his expression calm as he sheathed his sword and walked towards the hall's entrance.</p><p>"What a dilapidated hall!" Qin Sang thought to himself.</p><p>From the inside, the hall was empty and incredibly dilapidated. The beams were almost broken, the pillars supporting the hall were covered in cracks and seemed about to collapse, and the roof tiles were askew, with gaps revealing the sky above.</p><p>It must look even more broken from the outside.</p><p>One of the wooden doors was missing, and the other hung crookedly, about to fall. Originally crafted from some unknown spiritual wood, it was now covered in rot, reduced to decaying wood.</p><p>"Don't go outside. Stepping over the threshold will trigger the Spirit Suppression Domain!" Ning Wu Hui stopped Qin Sang as he reached the doorway.</p><p>This was Sky Peak!</p><p>Qin Sang didn't dare to cross the line and looked down, discovering that this ancient hall was built at the highest point of Sky Peak, right next to the Immortal Restriction's glow. A few stone steps led down, and below was an open expanse. Apart from a faint mist, his vision was almost unobstructed.</p><p>Sky Peak soared tens of thousands of feet high. Standing here, he could only see part of the mountain and couldn't see the scenery below. From below, it would be impossible to detect what was happening here.</p><p>Looking down from Sky Peak, his gaze swept across the landscape.</p><p>Stone forests stretched across the mountain, interspersed with halls and pavilions. Buildings clustered together, and there were also several forbidden areas and secret valleys, where the strange lights of ancient restrictions flickered. All sorts of wonders met the eye.</p><p>It was easy to imagine that Sky Peak must have once been bustling with cultivators, a truly magnificent sight.</p><p>Due to the suppression of the Spirit Suppression Domain, very few cultivators could climb Sky Peak. He didn't see any signs of cultivators, but they were still very cautious, concealing their figures and auras.</p><p>"Is Senior Qing Zhu asking us to wait for him here?" Qin Sang retracted his gaze and asked.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui nodded and took out the fragment. "He instructed me to wait here. Even if he doesn't return here, he will definitely appear nearby."</p><p>"Nearby?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze swept over the forbidden areas below. "Senior Qing Zhu can't control his body. What if he's too far away? How will you get out to help him?"</p><p>The Spirit Suppression Domain's suppression was unreasonable.  Without sufficient cultivation, it was impossible to leave. A foreign Nascent Soul's power wasn't nearly enough.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui gently flicked the fragment with his fingertip. "This treasure can protect me."</p><p>As he spoke, Ning Wu Hui cautiously stepped outside.</p><p>Just as he said, the fluctuations of the Spirit Suppression Domain remained unchanged. It was as if an invisible shield surrounded him, protecting him from harm.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>The gray mist in his dantian seemed to have a close relationship with the fragment, possibly sharing the same origin. Could it also protect him within the Spirit Suppression Domain?</p><p>However, with Ning Wu Hui by his side, Qin Sang resisted the urge and didn't test it.</p><p>Ning Wu Hui went out to investigate and returned to the doorway, sitting cross-legged and circulating his true essence to refine the fragment. Qin Sang also sat down beside him, pondering silently for a while before entering meditation to await Senior Qing Zhu.</p><p>...</p><p>The three Trade Alliance leaders escorted Su Nü, quietly passing through the Spirit Suppression Domain and arriving at the foot of Sky Peak.</p><p>There were almost no cultivators on Sky Peak. If anyone appeared, they were bound to be top experts.  Therefore, they didn't dare to relax, fully concealing their auras to avoid being detected.</p><p>Fortunately, all three were renowned experts with profound cultivation. They moved swiftly and were adept at concealment.</p><p>The mountain path was long.</p><p>They flew straight towards the summit, passing by numerous secret realms along the way without slowing down.</p><p>Finally, as they neared the Immortal Restriction's glow, they stopped at the entrance of a hidden mountain valley.</p><p>The three leaders exchanged glances, a hint of tension in their eyes.</p><p>Su Nü's face was ashen. She couldn't even commit suicide, powerless to resist, waiting for her fate.</p>
