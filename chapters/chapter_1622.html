<h1>Chapter 1613: Sword Tomb</h1><p>As they spoke, the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation covered Dragon Soar Cliff, the black canopy expanding outwards.  Su Zinan and the others, sensing the shift, fell silent, raising their heads to observe the formation's transformations.  With their discerning eyes, they could naturally see that the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation wasn't simply meant to seal off Mount Taiyue Sect, but also to disrupt its protective mountain formation.</p><p>From the outside, the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation seemed to permeate everything, embedding itself within Mount Taiyue Sect's protective formation. The two spiritual formations nearly overlapped, the dark canopy clearly spreading within the protective formation. Two diametrically opposed formations, which should have been mutually exclusive, now flawlessly merged, indistinguishable from one another.  Key nodes within the Mount Taiyue Sect's protective formation were either invaded by the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation, obscured, or outright destroyed, their power greatly diminished.</p><p>This demonstrated just how ingenious the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation truly was. As the descendant of a Soul Transformation cultivator, Su Zinan's insight was second to none present. Precisely because of this, he understood the sheer difficulty of such a feat. A strange glint flashed in his eyes as he discreetly employed his divine abilities, attempting to deduce the formation's next changes. Even with the earlier demonstrations, he found it surprisingly taxing.  Looking at the white-haired elder with astonishment, Su Zinan's appraisal of him rose another level.</p><p>The white-haired elder had clearly been plotting against Mount Taiyue Sect for a considerable time, possessing an intimate knowledge of their protective formation. Even for a grandmaster of formations, achieving this level of mastery required immense dedication, bordering on the impossible.  Furthermore, sealing off Mount Taiyue Sect was merely the initial preparatory stage, not even the first step. They hadn't yet seen any sign of the Formless Immortal Sect.</p><p>A single person, or even a large sect, couldn't accomplish this! Unless the plot had been brewing for generations, meticulously cultivated until the plan reached fruition. This was indeed something only a descendant of the Formless Immortal Sect would undertake.</p><p>"By my foster father's standards, Fellow Daoist has reached the pinnacle of the Dao of Formations. I am truly impressed!" Su Zinan, always the picture of elegance in public, never lorded his status as a Soul Transformation descendant over others.  He readily admitted his mistakes and offered praise where it was due.  No one could discern his cruel nature.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, besides Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, the Heavenly Firmament Tower hides yet another expert. The Heavenly Firmament Tower's Quyang Mountain branch is not well-known, and Fellow Daoist's concealment within it is a true waste of talent. In my opinion, your talent is sufficient to replace either of them.  If I hadn't accompanied my foster father in dealings with Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan, I would have thought one of them was masquerading as you to amuse me."</p><p>The white-haired elder's subordinates all wore robes to conceal their identities, but their affiliation became clear the moment they clashed with Mount Taiyue Sect. Su Zinan and the others, with their sharp eyes, finally saw through his origins. The Grotesque-Faced Man was clearly aware of the white-haired elder's identity, but the others were somewhat surprised to learn he hailed from the foremost demonic sect.</p><p>The white-haired elder, manipulating the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation with practiced ease, still found time to respond, "Fellow Daoist Su flatters me. Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan are both profound in demonic arts, their Soul Transformation imminent.  While I can only painstakingly excavate the ruins of the Formless Immortal Sect, searching for opportunities. The difference is obvious."  His words also subtly implied that he and Sect Master Yu and Elder Fan were not aligned.</p><p>The others understood. The Heavenly Firmament Tower was not a monolithic entity.  The hearts of demonic cultivators were unpredictable, their internal conflicts far greater than other sects.  If he were in cahoots with Yu and Fan, the Heavenly Firmament Tower could easily have opened the Formless Immortal Sect with any ally, without resorting to such elaborate schemes.  It wasn't only the righteous and Buddhist sects that targeted the Formless Immortal Sect; the demonic sects had also gained much from their downfall. The Heavenly Firmament Tower showed no mercy to remnants of the Formless Immortal Sect.  Preventing their resurgence seemed to be a shared goal of the major sects in the Central Plains, otherwise traces of the Formless Immortal Sect wouldn't have been so thoroughly erased. A Formless Immortal Sect remnant had actually infiltrated the Heavenly Firmament Tower, forming their own branch. The most dangerous place was indeed the safest; the ancients were wise.</p><p>Throughout their conversation, the Sword-Bearer remained silent.  Clearing his throat, he said in a deep voice, "As far as I know, the Quyang Mountain branch leader should only be at Mid-Nascent Soul realm. Judging by Fellow Daoist's divine abilities, your breakthrough wasn't recent. Have you been hiding behind the scenes all this time?"</p><p>"I am Zhu Wudao, the branch leader of Quyang Mountain," the white-haired elder nodded.</p><p>The Sword-Bearer was surprised. "You managed to conceal yourself from Yu and Fan for so long?"</p><p>"My master passed down a few minor techniques, nothing worth mentioning," Zhu Wudao said calmly, offering no further explanation.</p><p>A moment later, Zhu Wudao ceased his manipulations, letting the spiritual formation evolve on its own.  Sensing the outside, he let out a long sigh.  "With Fellow Daoist Mo and the others personally intervening, there should be no problems!  The overall situation is settled.  We should begin."  Pausing, Zhu Wudao remembered something and looked at the Grotesque-Faced Man. "Where is the Poison King now?"</p><p>The Grotesque-Faced Man calculated with his fingers. "The Cave Master and I set up a diversion.  If nothing goes wrong, he should be lured to the heart of the Savage Lands."</p><p>"Good. The Poison King alone can't cause much trouble!" Zhu Wudao nodded. "As long as we keep the Poison King away for a while, even if the emergence of the Formless Immortal Sect draws him back, the news will reach Golden Jade Province too late. We have ample time."</p><p>...</p><p>As they conversed, cries of battle echoed from beyond Dragon Soar Cliff.</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>'Dong!'</p><p>...</p><p>A drum suddenly resounded within Mount Taiyue Sect.  The rhythm grew increasingly frantic. This was no ordinary drum; it seemed to emanate from the earth itself, commanding the mountains to tremble. The drumbeat, deep and resonant rather than sharp, instilled a sense of urgency that shook the very soul, a feeling of suffocation.</p><p>With each beat, panic spread throughout Mount Taiyue Sect. This was the Taiyue Ritual Drum, built atop the main peak by the founding ancestor of Mount Taiyue Sect.  It wasn't a supreme treasure, but its significance to the sect was immeasurable.  The Taiyue Ritual Drum was only sounded in times of direst peril. Since Mount Taiyue Sect's rise to dominance in the Southern Province, the drum had remained silent for countless years.</p><p>Upon entering the sect, disciples were informed of the Taiyue Ritual Drum's existence, but none had ever heard its sound.</p><p>With the drum's first beat, everyone within Mount Taiyue Sect, regardless of cultivation level, immediately converged towards the main peak.</p><p>To worsen matters, night descended without warning.  The depths of the darkness seemed to harbor a hundred ghosts on parade, further amplifying the disciples' terror.  They all knew the sect was under attack, but they never imagined the upheaval would originate from within. Had their vaunted protective mountain formation become mere decoration?</p><p>Chaos erupted within Mount Taiyue Sect. Streaks of escaping light ignited from all directions, converging on the main peak.  Unbeknownst to them, these escaping lights made them even more conspicuous targets.</p><p>The low-level disciples of Mount Taiyue Sect were utterly helpless against the invaders.  Massacres unfolded, escaping lights extinguished in droves, punctuated by the occasional short, sharp cry. Most, like the gate guards, died in silence.</p><p>The invaders, unsatisfied with slaughtering low-level disciples, unanimously turned their attention to the main peak of Mount Taiyue Sect. The sect's experts, reacting swiftly, had mostly gathered on the peak, activating its formation.</p><p>At this moment, the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation also enveloped the main peak, but the darkness couldn't submerge it completely.  A primal yellow light flickered there.  The Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation could only disrupt the protective mountain formation; the main peak had its own independent formation.</p><p>However, the sealing power of the Sky-Shrouding Profound Formation was indiscriminate.</p><p>The main peak's formation was similarly enveloped in darkness, the yellow light appearing faint and dim.  The anomalies here were completely invisible to the outside world, let alone capable of transmitting messages.</p><p>"Where's that old ghost Chi going?!"</p><p>Two streaks of light, one crimson and one white, suddenly appeared within the darkness. The white light led, followed by the crimson. The crimson light belonged to the Wailing Spirit Cave Master.  After a fruitless search, he'd unexpectedly discovered a furtive figure. Even better, he had a grudge against this person!</p><p>The white escaping light belonged to a burly man with a ruddy complexion.  Seeing the Wailing Spirit Cave Master, his eyes widened in fury.  "It's you!"</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master sneered.  "Years ago, you bragged about razing my Wailing Spirit Cave, driving me out of the Southern Province.  Did you ever imagine this day would come?"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a red light shot from the Wailing Spirit Cave Master's palm. The intensely vibrant red light took the form of a flower, resembling a morning glory, hanging upside down in the air, its opening facing Old Ghost Chi.</p><p>'Woo...'  A strange whistling sound emanated from the flower's heart, the red light flickering.  There was no grand display of power.  But the instant the whistling began, Old Ghost Chi, as if facing a mortal threat, plunged towards the ground without hesitation.  With a resounding boom, he smashed a large crater into the hard mountainside.</p><p>Then, a yellow light flashed over Old Ghost Chi, and he merged with the rock, instantly vanishing into the earth. Simultaneously, the ground within the crater bulged upwards, exceeding its original height, forming a distinct hump.  The hump's texture differed markedly from the surrounding mountain, displaying regular patterns like a stone shield.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'  A series of explosions rang out, and a dozen blade-like cracks instantly appeared on the hump's surface. As the cracks appeared, several illusory blade shadows flashed and vanished.  The hump collapsed.  A muffled groan echoed from within.</p><p>Seeing that he hadn't forced Old Ghost Chi out, the Wailing Spirit Cave Master changed his hand seals. The red flower suddenly swelled, becoming as large as a small mountain, like a giant bell, and slammed down towards where Old Ghost Chi had fled.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as the red flower was about to land, the ground cracked open, and black light erupted skyward.  A stone stele flew out from the earth. The stele was square and plain, bearing no inscriptions or runes, only the two characters 'Still Wind'.</p><p>'Boom!' A deafening explosion shook the air. The descending red flower and the ascending Still Wind Stele collided violently. The piercing red light scattered, dyeing half the sky crimson. Due to the darkness, the Still Wind Stele appeared less imposing.  But the red flower stalled, unable to descend further.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master, his expression changing slightly, hadn't anticipated an uninvited guest.  By the time he tried to recover, it was too late.</p><p>'Whoosh!'  The stele shot into the air, heading straight for the main peak. The Wailing Spirit Cave Master hesitated for a moment, then abandoned the pursuit, raising his head to glare coldly at Mount Taiyue Sect's main peak.  Within the yellow light of the formation, several figures flickered indistinctly.  It was they who had joined forces to save Old Ghost Chi.</p><p>At this moment, space rippled beside the Wailing Spirit Cave Master, revealing a figure.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Mo was slow to act." The Wailing Spirit Cave Master's tone held a hint of dissatisfaction.  This person was Mo Xingdao.  If he hadn't hesitated, if he had acted decisively, they could have captured Old Ghost Chi.  Such indecisiveness; how could he be the Northern Wastelands' foremost rogue cultivator?</p><p>"Are you injured?"  Mo Xingdao didn't answer, instead questioning the Wailing Spirit Cave Master.  The Wailing Spirit Cave Master, surprised by Mo Xingdao's perceptiveness, reluctantly nodded.  "I was tricked by the Poison King."</p><p>"The Poison King?"  Mo Xingdao was surprised.  Seeing that the Wailing Spirit Cave Master didn't want to elaborate, he didn't press the matter, following his gaze towards the main peak.  "I need to prevent others from breaking through."</p><p>This served as an explanation for his earlier actions. Hunting down Mount Taiyue Sect's experts wasn't their objective. They needed to ensure the news didn't leak, keeping Mount Taiyue Sect trapped on the main peak.</p><p>The Wailing Spirit Cave Master grudgingly accepted this explanation.</p><p>On the main peak, the disciples of Mount Taiyue Sect were in despair.  Even those who had managed to escape to the main peak wore no smiles. Many of their friends and family had been slaughtered by the invaders, some falling into the hands of demonic cultivators, their souls doomed for eternity.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivators who had remained at the mountain gate gathered together, exerting all their strength to maintain the formation. This was their last line of defense.  They centered around an elder with a wrinkled face.  They couldn't afford to be consumed by rage; they had to find a way to break through.</p><p>At this moment, a figure arrived through the air, his voice panicked.  "Grand Elder, the transmission formation is disabled! Someone tampered with it within the mountain gate!"</p><p>The elder was the current Grand Elder of Mount Taiyue Sect.  His cultivation had reached the peak of Mid-Nascent Soul realm. Although he had no hope of further breakthroughs, his divine sense had reached the Form Manifestation stage, making him a renowned figure in the cultivation world.</p><p>Upon hearing this devastating news, the crowd stirred.</p><p>The Grand Elder's expression remained unreadable, his voice soft yet clearly audible to everyone. "Remain calm. Amidst this chaos, I have already alerted the Sect Master. We only need to defend the main peak, and reinforcements will arrive.  We will slay these villains and avenge our loved ones!"</p><p>These words steadied their hearts. The disciples of Mount Taiyue Sect calmed somewhat.</p><p>The Grand Elder closed his eyes halfway, appearing to doze, like any ordinary old man.  No one noticed his gaze piercing through the formation, looking out at the hellish landscape beyond the main peak.  Those disciples of Mount Taiyue Sect, moments ago vibrant with life…  His gaze was not entirely impassive.  Although he had sent away the most promising disciples under various pretexts, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow seeing these innocent disciples die in vain.</p><p>These disciples never imagined that they had been abandoned by the revered Grand Elder and Sect Master, reduced to pawns in their scheme!</p><p>This plan had been set in motion the moment they confirmed the Formless Immortal Sect remnant's target. Although the mastermind behind this plan was the Eight Sceneries Pavilion's Pavilion Master, Purple Thunder True Person, neither he nor Yue Lingtian could offer any reason for refusal.  In fact, they had agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Because after this incident, Mount Taiyue Sect would be eligible to enter the Southern Sea Immortal Palace!</p><p>The enduring prosperity of the Eight Sceneries Pavilion and the Sweet Dew Zen Monastery stemmed from a secret realm within the Southern Sea Immortal Palace.  Both sects had Soul Transformation cultivators at the helm, jointly controlling the Southern Sea Immortal Palace, preventing any outside interference.  Every generation of their great cultivators could enter the Immortal Palace, increasing their chances of a breakthrough.</p><p>Entry into the Southern Sea Immortal Palace was solely at the discretion of these two sects.</p><p>The rumors circulating the world were true; Mount Taiyue Sect's rise to dominance in the Southern Province was due to the Eight Sceneries Pavilion's covert support.</p><p>Even so, the Eight Sceneries Pavilion wasn't generous enough to cede one of their slots.</p><p>Purple Thunder True Person had promised that when the Southern Sea Immortal Palace next opened, the Eight Sceneries Pavilion would relinquish one slot to Mount Taiyue Sect!</p><p>Who could refuse such an offer?</p>
