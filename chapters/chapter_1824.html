<h1>Chapter 1815: Hunting Beasts and Comprehending the Dao</h1><p>The moon hung high in the sky.</p><p>The two men were deep in their cups.</p><p>Inspired by the moment, Realmaster Zhijian stood up and casually plucked a long leaf from the Swordheart Orchid.  Wielding the leaf as a sword, he moved with blinding speed, leaving a flurry of sword shadows hanging in the air.  Yet, there was no trace of killing intent, only an ethereal grace that perfectly complemented the moonlit night, a truly marvelous sight.</p><p>Qin Sang watched intently.  Along with Realmaster Zhijian's explanations, this was the first time he had received such profound guidance in swordsmanship.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu had been both a good teacher and a friend, but their meeting had been too late, leaving Qin Sang with only a sword scripture.</p><p>Qin Sang could only interject occasionally, even though their current discussion was related to the Chengying Sword inheritance.</p><p>Although Realmaster Zhijian hadn't received the inheritance, after Qin Sang’s descriptions and demonstrations, he was able to deduce the underlying principles and provide Qin Sang with numerous insights. His profound understanding and innate talent in the Way of the Sword left Qin Sang feeling humbled.</p><p>Draining the last cup of spirit wine, Qin Sang remained immersed in the Dao of the Sword, only startled back to reality when the Sword Slave came forward to refill his cup.</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian waved his hand, dismissing the Sword Slave.  He looked at Qin Sang appraisingly and said with a smile, "Brother, you too are a sword fanatic."</p><p>Qin Sang gave a wry smile and shook his head, bowing deeply.  "Thanks to Brother Dao’s guidance, I have finally glimpsed the true scenery of the Sword Dao."</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian turned slightly to avoid the bow, lightly flicking the orchid leaf, which emitted a resonant hum. "This humble Daoist is waiting for the day Brother’s swordsmanship reaches great heights, so we can fulfill our promise to spar."</p><p>With that, he flicked his sleeve and strolled towards his cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang watched Realmaster Zhijian's retreating figure and, after a moment's thought, said, "If you have any requests, I will do my utmost to fulfill them."</p><p>Realmaster Zhijian laughed heartily.  "This humble Daoist will not stand on ceremony with you."</p><p>The moonlit night was quiet and still.</p><p>There were no important belongings in the cave dwelling.</p><p>Qin Sang bid farewell to the Sword Slave and left Swordheart Island, heading directly east.  He took the Minor Teleportation Formation from the Left Belt Pass and entered the territory of the Demonic Kingdom.</p><p>Among the many Demonic Kingdoms in Jusangzhi, there was one ruled by the White-Tailed Demonic Wolf Clan, located in the northeastern part of Jusangzhi. Due to its remote location, this kingdom rarely clashed with the human race, existing in peaceful seclusion.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the Demonic Kingdom and finally arrived at a giant boulder atop a desolate mountain.  He sat down cross-legged, seemingly waiting for someone.</p><p>Three days later.</p><p>Outside the mountain, in the jungle, a small figure moved swiftly through the undergrowth. Its form, like a cross between a dog and a fox, was that of a demonic beast. Its concealment technique was extraordinary, leaving no trace of its passage.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>The demon leaped onto the mountaintop, its eyes meeting Qin Sang's. It trembled involuntarily, then adopted a fawning expression, prostrating itself on the ground.  Its voice was filled with excitement, "This humble demon greets the Immortal Lord!"</p><p>"It seems you have already received the Demonic Godhood," Qin Sang said calmly.  "Why not assume your human form?"</p><p>The newcomer was the Jackal Demon.</p><p>Years ago, he had let the Jackal Demon go to seek its own Demonic Godhood. The cunning creature had indeed succeeded.</p><p>The Jackal Demon knelt, not daring to rise.  "This humble one's transformation is incomplete, and my appearance is unsightly.  I fear it would offend the Immortal Lord's eyes."</p><p>Qin Sang looked at it with a mixture of amusement and disdain. "Should I address you as Lord Jackal God now?"</p><p>The Jackal Demon raised its head and suddenly adopted an indignant expression. "Those Demonic Wolves only appoint their own kin to the temples and grant them Godhood.  This humble one is not trusted and deeply regrets being unable to uncover any secrets for the Immortal Lord!"</p><p>"Oh? Is that so?"</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't known there were such intricacies involved in the appointment of Demonic Gods. The more the demons valued this process, the more important the Demonic Gods must be.</p><p>In truth, Qin Sang still didn't understand what the Guifang Kingdom was plotting, and the Dao Court was also very secretive about it.</p><p>The Jackal Demon spoke at length, confirming that after being appointed as Demonic Gods, the demons resided in the temples, enjoying offerings and incense.  At least for now, there seemed to be no noticeable changes from before their appointment.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression remained impassive.</p><p>Unable to guess Qin Sang's thoughts, the Jackal Demon felt uneasy.  Suddenly, it remembered something and hastily said, "Immortal Lord, please allow me to report.  This humble demon has maintained contact with that Demonic Snake. It has now become a Demonic General under a Demonic Marquis and is quite influential. It is said that it will be dispatched to the Demonic Wastes.  Why not summon it to meet the Immortal Lord now…"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded slightly. He had intended to contact the two demons this time.</p><p>He had previously speculated that the Snake Demon's inheritance was not simple, and his suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>"Summon it here.  This humble Daoist will wait for you here," Qin Sang said calmly.</p><p>The Jackal Demon bowed and retreated, its face etched with disappointment.</p><p>It had tried every means possible but couldn't remove the latent poison within its body. It lived in constant fear that Qin Sang would forget about it and the poison would suddenly flare up, killing it.</p><p>Finally, it had the chance to see Qin Sang, but he hadn't mentioned anything about providing an antidote.</p><p>The Jackal Demon sighed inwardly and hurried away.</p><p>…</p><p>On the desolate mountain.</p><p>The Grey Warbler Sword hovered in the air, the surrounding void seemingly distorted. In a flash, the spirit sword vanished into the void, its shadow flickering in and out of existence.</p><p>Rustling sounds came from below the mountain.</p><p>A jackal and a snake arrived together.</p><p>They had assumed their demonic forms outside the mountain to show their submission.  Crawling obediently to the top, they saw Qin Sang practicing his swordsmanship and respectfully stood by.</p><p>Several days later, Qin Sang slowly sheathed his sword.</p><p>The two demons immediately prostrated themselves.</p><p>"Rise," Qin Sang said indifferently, looking at the Snake Demon. Before he could speak, the Snake Demon recounted its experiences over the years.</p><p>After listening, Qin Sang asked, "The Demonic Marquis wants to send you to the Demonic Wastes to establish a temple, become a Demonic God, and enlighten the ghost people. Will becoming a Demonic God allow you to remain in the Demonic Wastes permanently, without losing your sanity?"</p><p>It turned out that after the Snake Demon entered the Guifang Kingdom with the token, it was quickly granted an audience, even with a Demonic Marquis under a Demonic King.</p><p>It also learned that the inheritance was actually a Dao Seed spread by the Demonic Marquis on the orders of the Demonic King while traveling.</p><p>Demon cultivators who received this inheritance were more likely to become Demonic Gods.</p><p>They were scattered throughout the lands, and when the Guifang Kingdom acted, commands would be issued through the tokens. At that time, they would all become Gods to bolster their power.</p><p>However, the Demonic King was fond of talent and ordered the Demonic Marquis to leave a message. If there were demons with exceptional talent, they could travel to the Guifang Kingdom and serve before him.</p><p>The Snake Demon had relied on Qin Sang to reach the Guifang Kingdom.</p><p>Its talent was decent but not enough to catch the Demonic King's eye. It hadn't even seen the Demonic King's true face.</p><p>The Demonic Marquis appointed it as a Demonic General and bestowed many treasures. The Snake Demon not only fully recovered from its injuries but also successfully broke through to the mid-stage. If it weren't for Qin Sang's threat, it would have considered itself at the peak of its life.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it had recently learned that it was to be sent to the Demonic Wastes to become a Demonic God.</p><p>Being a Demonic God in the Demonic Wastes was vastly different from being one in the inner lands. If the Dao Court decided to destroy the temples and purge the Demonic Gods, they would surely start with the Demonic Wastes. The demons there would bear the brunt of the attack. It was practically exile.</p><p>The Snake Demon immediately felt its future was uncertain; those benefits weren't free after all.</p><p>"This humble demon doesn't know. It is said that after becoming a Demonic God, one can stay longer, but every once in a while, one still has to return to the Guifang Kingdom…"</p><p>The Snake Demon dared not hide anything and confessed everything.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered, seeing that he couldn't get any more information, he let it go. His gaze swept over the two demons, and with a flick of his fingers, he shot two beams of spiritual light towards their foreheads.</p><p>The two demons trembled but didn't resist.</p><p>The spiritual light merged into their foreheads. It was a body refining secret technique.</p><p>"Enter meditation," Qin Sang said in a deep voice.</p><p>The two demons immediately obeyed, circulating the secret technique. Qin Sang raised his hand and pressed it virtually on their heads.</p><p>Then, the two demons felt a portion of the latent poison within their bodies being drawn out and spreading throughout their bodies, being refined as they circulated the secret technique.</p><p>A long while later, the two demons awoke and were surprised to find a significant improvement in their physical bodies. Their faces were filled with joy.</p><p>"From now on, you can also collect poisons to refine your bodies, but remember not to be greedy. If this humble Daoist cannot provide you with the antidote in time, you can use this technique to suppress the poison for a period of time, but…"</p><p>Qin Sang shouted coldly, "Do not attempt to refine the poison within your bodies, or else, if the poison flares up, even immortals cannot save you!"</p><p>"This humble demon wouldn't dare!"</p><p>The two demons prostrated themselves and cried out, "Thank you, Immortal Lord, for bestowing this technique!"</p><p>This secret technique came from the *Poison God Canon*. Qin Sang had taken a part of it. The effect was not as good as the original, but it was safer. He had made slight modifications to suit demon cultivators.</p><p>A combination of grace and power was necessary to make the two demons submit.</p><p>"Alright, serve diligently in the future, and this humble Daoist will not treat you unfairly.  There are still things I need you to do…"</p><p>Qin Sang gave them their instructions and soon parted ways with the two demons. He returned the way he came, heading straight for Pot Island.</p><p>He first arrived at the rented mortal courtyard.</p><p>Old Chen, who looked after the courtyard, seemed even older, but thanks to the medicine Qin Sang had given him, his hidden injuries had healed, and he was strong and healthy, his spirit even better than before.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the quiet room in the back hall.</p><p>The spirit array in the quiet room was still there, but there was no message from Mo Xingdao.</p><p>Ten years had passed. Qin Sang had been cultivating on Swordheart Island, never leaving Jusangzhi, and he didn't know what Mo Xingdao's situation was now.</p><p>He took out a blank spirit talisman, pondered for a moment, inscribed a new communication method on it, and flicked it with his finger.</p><p>The spirit talisman shot towards the spirit array, like a stone thrown into water, creating ripples before disappearing.</p><p>He was going to cultivate at the Jusangzhi Dao Platform and couldn't come here often to check, so the previous communication method could no longer be used.</p><p>The Snake Demon being sent to the Demonic Wastes to establish a temple and become a Demonic God was a convenient way to relay messages.</p><p>He had made arrangements. Mo Xingdao would send messages to the Jackal Demon, who would then relay them to the Snake Demon. Qin Sang and Mo Xingdao had already established secret marks, so even if the message was intercepted, others wouldn't understand its true meaning.</p><p>In addition, Qin Sang also gave the Snake Demon and the Jackal Demon a task: to help him collect the necessary spiritual herbs in the Guifang Kingdom.</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, he erased all traces and walked out of the quiet room. Seeing Old Chen respectfully waiting outside, Qin Sang asked, "Old Chen, do you have any nephews or nieces alive?"</p><p>Old Chen was stunned. "Reporting to Master, this old servant has a nephew who has settled down and started a family on Hongdong Island, but we haven't been in contact for many years."</p><p>"I will not be returning."</p><p>Saying this, Qin Sang took out some silver and a few spirit stones. "I'll leave this small courtyard and these to you. They should be enough for you to live out your remaining years in peace. Remember to use the spirit stones sparingly."</p><p>Old Chen suddenly felt his arms heavy, unsure what to do.  By the time he came to his senses, Qin Sang had already vanished. He knelt and kowtowed repeatedly.</p><p>Leaving the courtyard, Qin Sang went to Master Qi's residence, explained his intentions, and soon flew out of Pot Island, leaving behind an emergency contact method on Swordheart Island as well.</p><p>With the basic arrangements in place, there was no need to stay any longer.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately summoned his flying light and soared north.</p><p>Returning to the Demonic Wastes, Qin Sang flew continuously, reaching the vicinity of the Jusangzhi Dao Platform, but he didn't stop, continuing to fly north.</p><p>Gradually, he ventured deeper and deeper.</p><p>Few people reached these depths. Even Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators only came to such places when hunting ferocious beasts.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose for this trip was precisely to hunt ferocious beasts.</p><p>One, to earn demonic corpses and demonic cores to exchange for spiritual herbs. Two, to verify his previous comprehension of the Killing Dao.</p><p>Whether it was due to the aftereffects of the previous tremor at the Jusangzhi Dao Platform or some other reason, Qin Sang hadn't encountered a single Nascent Soul stage ferocious beast despite searching for so long.</p><p>*Whoosh…*</p><p>Qin Sang went even deeper, finally landing on a mountaintop. He saw lush, boundless jungle ahead, filled with rich wood spiritual energy.</p><p>"This is a good place," Qin Sang murmured.</p><p>The wood spiritual energy here was sufficient to support a great battle.</p><p>He flew around the jungle, made some arrangements, and began searching around the perimeter.</p><p>Further north, Qin Sang stopped after a while, frowning as he looked ahead. After a moment of contemplation, he turned left.</p><p>Continuing deeper, he might soon find his target, but according to the rumors Qin Sang had heard, the deepest parts of the Demonic Wastes not only had ferocious beasts, but also strange and unpredictable Yaksha ghosts, even more terrifying than ferocious beasts.</p><p>These ghosts roamed the depths of the Demonic Wastes and rarely ventured out. Few people had seen them. It was said that encountering these ghosts brought terrible danger, and no one wanted to meet them.</p><p>Some said they were evil ghosts that had emerged from the underworld, even attributing the legends of hell from the Dao scriptures to the Demonic Wastes.</p><p>Most of the information regarding these ghosts were rumors. Qin Sang didn't know the details, nor their abilities, so naturally, he avoided them if possible.</p><p>He continued to expand his search radius, centering around the jungle, and finally found his target at a stream!</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>As soon as Qin Sang released his aura, a huge splash erupted from the stream. A silver light, carrying an unmatched ferocity, charged straight towards him.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly saw clearly. The silver light was a strange ferocious beast shaped like a small calf, with deer antlers and nine fleshy tumors on its back.</p><p>This strange bull sensed the delicious flesh and blood, its eyes revealing greed, drool dripping from its mouth.</p><p>"Nascent Soul mid-stage!"</p><p>Qin Sang nodded inwardly.</p><p>Ordinary Nascent Soul late-stage cultivators would already need to divert their attention to resist the erosion of the heavens here, and would need to carefully consider engaging a Nascent Soul mid-stage demonic beast.</p><p>Qin Sang had no such concerns. He immediately used Thunder Escape and soared away.</p><p>How could the strange bull let its prey escape? It pursued relentlessly.</p><p>The thunder light and the silver light raced, causing chaos in the surroundings. Qin Sang controlled his speed, keeping the strange bull at bay.</p><p>Soon, the jungle was in sight.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>Qin Sang landed, causing the ground to tremble violently. He glanced back, killing intent flashing in his eyes. His body transformed instantly.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>A treant, as tall as an ancient tree, rose from the ground. Compared to it, the strange bull seemed rather small.</p><p>The strange bull sensed the threat and let out a low growl. It also swelled in size, transforming into a giant bull as large as a small mountain. Lowering its head, it charged fiercely towards Qin Sang.</p><p>As long as there was sufficient wood spiritual energy, Qin Sang dared to face a Nascent Soul late-stage expert. He had slain Marquis Li before his cultivation fully recovered, let alone a strange bull.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Sword light appeared, enveloping the jungle in darkness. Sword stars hung high in the night sky, witnessing the battle between the two.</p><p>The Skyeye Butterfly flew leisurely onto a sword star, acting as a lookout to prevent other ferocious beasts or ghosts from being attracted.</p><p>*Thump! Thump! Thump!*</p><p>The ground shook.</p><p>Qin Sang charged fearlessly towards the strange bull, seemingly intending to meet its attack head-on.</p><p>Just as they were about to collide, the strange bull roared. A silver vortex expanded rapidly from its forehead, instantly covering the sky and earth, as if attempting to devour everything. However, it struck empty air.</p><p>Qin Sang vanished, emerging from an ancient tree behind the strange bull. He grabbed its long tail and swung it with all his might.</p><p>The strange bull's body tilted, and it was sent flying a great distance, smashing a nearby stone peak in two.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The strange bull emerged from the rubble, roaring furiously. Unexpectedly, a brilliant starlight descended from the sky, striking its head and sending it flying back again, landing on its back with all four hooves in the air.</p><p>As it struggled to get up, it was enveloped by a shadow. A withered hand, carrying a strange force, pressed down on its chest and abdomen.</p><p>*Splat!*</p><p>The strange bull desperately dodged the vital spot, its entire body radiating silver light as it escaped into the earth. When it emerged from another spot on the ground, its chest and abdomen were covered in blood.</p><p>Having lost the initial advantage, it was already injured.</p>
