<h1>Chapter 1465: Listening Snow Tower (8k, two extra chapters for the alliance leader Qi Zhi Youzou!)</h1><p>Touching one small tower causes the other to react.</p><p>Qin Sang experimented with this idea, finding that it couldn't directly transmit messages. However, the two towers' mutual感应 (sensing/resonance) showed no delay whatsoever.</p><p>If two people were separated by thousands of miles, as soon as a signal was sent, the other party would immediately perceive it.  Under specific circumstances, this could be crucial.</p><p>Such as a warning!</p><p>Qin Sang moved beyond his previous assumptions, making a bold deduction.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace and Jing Hai Sect both had significant connections to Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>Let's assume the two towers were deliberately left behind in the two sects by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>Various signs indicate that Jing Hai Sect's destruction was related to a demonic figure, with the entire sect devoting themselves to repairing the ancient seal to reseal the demonic figure.  Was their duty to guard the seal of the demonic figure?</p><p>This duty was likely bestowed upon them by Xiao Xiangzi.</p><p>Let's be even bolder: Jing Hai Sect was founded by Xiao Xiangzi himself.</p><p>If this were true…</p><p>Did Xiao Xiangzi unify Yin Ri Realm and establish Xuan Tian Palace for a similar purpose – a precaution against the demonic figure breaking the seal, a backup plan left behind in advance?</p><p>This would explain the existence of the two towers.</p><p>Once the seal showed signs of weakening, Jing Hai Sect would immediately alert Xuan Tian Palace through the Seven-Story Pagoda, summoning help and uniting the Buddhist and Daoist forces to suppress the demonic figure.</p><p>There might even be more than these two towers.</p><p>If the demonic figure breaks the seal, it would face the combined might of the entire Bei Hai cultivation world.</p><p>However, unforeseen circumstances and the passage of time change hearts; things did not develop as Xiao Xiangzi planned, resulting in deviations.</p><p>Jing Hai Sect fulfilled its duty.</p><p>Xuan Tian Palace, however, due to internal strife caused by selfish desires, underwent repeated calamities.  It was no longer the original Xuan Tian Palace, its scriptures lost, its ancestors' instructions and responsibilities forgotten, failing to fulfill its promise.</p><p>Fortunately, Jing Hai Sect turned the tide, repairing the ancient seal with Buddhist restrictions, but at the cost of the entire sect's lives, resulting in a tragic outcome.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the tower in his hand.</p><p>These were all his conjectures, mostly unfounded.</p><p>Xiao Xiangzi's character, whether he had the heart to protect the world, remained unknown.</p><p>Perhaps having witnessed similar scenes in the Seven Killing Hall—the Four Saints' struggle to seal the Demon Lord, and the Four Saints Palace's descendants guarding the seal for generations—led Qin Sang to consider this possibility.</p><p>After becoming a guest elder of Listening Snow Tower, he could slowly investigate within Xuan Tian Palace, perhaps finding some clues.</p><p>After much thought, seeing no new changes, Qin Sang put the two towers back into his Qian Jun Ring.</p><p>…</p><p>Di Tong Island is located west of Yin Ri Realm.</p><p>After leaving the Seventy-Two Springs of Xuan Tian Palace, Qin Sang needed to travel northwest.</p><p>When he reached Di Tong Island, the two women, Liuli, had not yet arrived. He found the pre-arranged deserted island and entered it to comprehend the Seven Master Buddha Seals.</p><p>After this period of time, Qin Sang finally thoroughly understood the first seal, the Auspicious Seal.</p><p>At the center of the deserted island, numerous stone peaks stood.</p><p>Vegetation was sparse on the stone peaks, with only hints of green in the crevices. These stone peaks were not particularly thick, varying in height; the thinnest were like stone pillars.</p><p>Qin Sang casually chose a larger stone peak, lightly stepped, and flew before it.</p><p>Floating in mid-air, Qin Sang closed his eyes, remaining motionless for a long time, seemingly experiencing something.</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Sang's eyes widened, his eyes flashing with brilliance. He raised his arms, his hands facing each other, forming a Buddha seal with lightning speed.</p><p>The Auspicious Seal!</p><p>In an instant, Qin Sang felt a surge of blood rushing through his body, his bones cracking.</p><p>After becoming a Yuan Ying cultivator, he had hardly engaged in pure physical combat.</p><p>During the Foundation Establishment stage, his cultivation had stagnated for a time. The skill of the Heavenly Demon Transformation surpassed his cultivation level; he relied on his physical body, but at that time, it was mainly brute force.</p><p>Practicing this top-tier physical cultivation skill, Qin Sang finally truly understood how to best utilize the power contained within his physical body.</p><p>The Auspicious Seal, as the first of the seven seals, serves primarily to help practitioners understand themselves and mobilize their bodily energy!</p><p>At this moment, a Buddha light shone between Qin Sang's palms, forming a phantom image of a giant Buddha, also holding the Auspicious Seal, centered on his hands.  This was a phenomenon caused by the overflowing blood energy, coating Qin Sang in a layer of golden light, his skin turning bronze, like copper and iron, invulnerable to blades and swords!</p><p>His blood energy became increasingly vigorous, resonating with his meridians and bones, booming like thunder, its sound like a梵唱 (梵唱 - Sanskrit chanting).</p><p>For a time, Qin Sang was like a present-day Arhat, walking the earth.</p><p>The fact that using physical cultivation skills produced such a grand spectacle surprised Qin Sang, yet he was somewhat displeased.</p><p>He examined himself, feeling that as his cultivation deepened, he could conceal these phenomena, preventing his enemies from becoming wary before he even made a move.</p><p>Making hand seals was merely a form, a guide.  Once he completely mastered this divine ability, he could form seals with his mind, moving freely and effortlessly.</p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, the phantom indeed gradually retracted, his Qi and blood condensing to the extreme.</p><p>Immediately, Qin Sang turned his gaze to the stone peak in front of him, his figure flashing, instantly appearing before it.  He condensed his Qi and blood in his hands and struck a huge boulder with a powerful blow.</p><p>Silently, deep palm prints appeared on the surface of the boulder.  Then, starting from the prints, cracks spread rapidly, as if a terrible force were erupting from within.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The stone peak shattered into four pieces.</p><p>Astonishingly, instead of fragments flying off, the entire peak turned into dust.</p><p>Dust swirled, creating a hazy cloud.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at his palm, a strange light flashing in his eyes.  He could easily destroy a stone peak with a punch before, but certainly not like this.</p><p>Having tested the power of the Auspicious Seal, Qin Sang nodded in satisfaction, looking forward to the remaining six seals even more. He withdrew his divine ability and returned to his cave dwelling.</p><p>He didn't continue practicing the Seven Master Buddha Seals, but instead took out the Sun God Tree. The color of the South Ming Li Fire aura on the flower bud was deeper, and a faint outline of a divine bird was even vaguely visible inside.</p><p>Though blurry, Qin Sang could barely make out its shape.</p><p>It was an exhilarating discovery.</p><p>After his divine sense took physical form, Qin Sang clearly felt his control strengthen, and the South Ming Li Fire condensed much faster. Everything was proceeding smoothly, evolving as he expected.</p><p>“At this rate, the divine bird will take shape in a few years, definitely before the Sacred Land opens…”</p><p>Qin Sang examined it carefully, his eyes filled with joy.</p><p>He couldn't accurately gauge the Sun God Tree's power, but he presumed it wouldn't be weaker than the Eighteen Demon Banners.</p><p>Like the Eighteen Demon Banners, it sealed high-level spirit fire using special methods, drawing on a portion of its power.  Unless it encountered a unique opportunity, it couldn't inherently develop sentience. Its power depended on the sealed spirit fire and couldn't be judged solely by the grade of artifact or treasure.</p><p>Such situations were not uncommon in the cultivation world.</p><p>Some special artifacts even possessed abilities that treasures didn't, making them prized possessions of Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>…</p><p>The sky was clear and bright.</p><p>A gentle sea breeze blew.</p><p>Two graceful figures, one purple and one white, flew from afar across the sea. Their beautiful faces resembled twin lotuses.  It was Shi Xue and Liu Li, arriving from Demon Mixing Island.</p><p>Liu Li still wore plain white clothes, her face veiled with a light gauze.</p><p>Shi Xue, however, wore a purple robe, exuding an elegant demeanor.</p><p>She shielded her eyes with her hand, gazing ahead. “They're traveling in the Grand Elder’s palanquin; they're faster than we are. If that heartless man hasn't gone back on his word, he's already returned the sacred object. If he has an ounce of conscience, he should be waiting for my junior sister near Di Tong Island.”</p><p>Liu Li had listened to the “heartless man” description all the way.</p><p>Shi Xue knew the “heartless man’s” real name, but whether out of anger for her junior sister or to vent her frustration over the loss of her treasure, she refused to change the nickname.</p><p>As they approached their destination, Liu Li looked at Shi Xue and reminded her, “His Dao name is Qingfeng.”</p><p>Qin Sang had previously agreed with Liu Li that after becoming a guest elder of the Listening Snow Tower, he would revert to his alias—Daoist Qingfeng.</p><p>“Of course I won't scold him to his face, do you think I'm stupid?!”</p><p>Shi Xue rolled her eyes, gritting her teeth, and snorted.  “It's only because I can't beat that heartless man right now! One day, if I reach the Palace Master's cultivation level, I'll beat him black and blue and get revenge for us sisters!”</p><p>The Grand Elder compensated her for her losses on behalf of the sect, but that incredibly useful life-saving treasure was one of a kind, irreplaceable, making her still feel like she lost out.</p><p>Liu Li remained unmoved.</p><p>Shi Xue imagined beating Qin Sang up, a wave of dark satisfaction washing over her, before she coughed in embarrassment.  “Junior sister, the Yin Li Pearls the Grand Elder gifted are even more suitable than the several spiritual objects we'd anticipated.  If we request three more Di Tong Fruits, your breakthrough should be foolproof this time, don't you think?”</p><p>She glanced at Liu Li as she spoke, using a questioning tone.</p><p>Seeing Liu Li's unchanging, noncommittal expression, a sense of worry arose in Shi Xue's heart. She hesitated before asking, “Junior sister, how do you feel about that heartless man now?”</p><p>Liu Li was silent, then said, “He is he, and I am I.”</p><p>Shi Xue’s lips moved slightly, as if choosing her words carefully.  She spoke hesitantly, “Junior Sister, have you considered… that your current feelings might not be your own?  They might be influenced by the Ice Heart Seal.”</p><p>Liuli turned her head and looked at Shi Xue silently.</p><p>Shi Xue felt immense pressure.</p><p>“I don’t know if this is good or bad for you, Junior Sister. Consider it just your senior sister rambling. You’ve always had such strong resolve, you certainly won’t be swayed by a few words from me.” Shi Xue quickly justified herself.</p><p>“I don’t know what happened between you and that… man, and I won’t pry.</p><p>“The saying goes, ‘The deeper the love, the sharper the reproach.’</p><p>“Your choice to use the Ice Heart Seal only proves the depth of your feelings for him. He’s left a profound mark on your heart, a deep-seated impression.</p><p>“Such devotion… I’ve cultivated for hundreds of years and never seen its like.  I used to think romantic love was illusory, that its turmoil was merely the delusion of mortals.  You, Junior Sister, have changed my perspective.</p><p>“He agreed to return the sacred artifact and help you extract its power to obtain the Yin Li Pearl. He does have a shred of conscience.</p><p>“If you truly have feelings for him, why torment yourselves?</p><p>“Unless he committed an unforgivable act, if there's a misunderstanding or unresolved issue, you should actively clear it up.  Hesitation isn't the way of cultivators; there's no external force preventing you from resolving things.</p><p>“Cultivators, especially we Yuan Ying stage cultivators, don’t easily find suitable partners. You met before reaching Yuan Ying, so he’s likely around your age. To have reached his current level of cultivation, his talent is comparable to yours.  He could be your companion, an enviable immortal couple.</p><p>“The Ice Heart Seal isn't necessary to cultivate the Ice Heart Divine Light.</p><p>“Don’t worry that ‘love’ will impede your cultivation.</p><p>“The cultivation world has plenty of dual cultivation techniques.  The union of man and woman, the balance of Yin and Yang, is natural and right. We cultivators follow the Way of Heaven; deliberately avoiding and suppressing our true feelings only invites inner demons.</p><p>“Using the Ice Heart Seal is a path of seclusion.</p><p>“Senior Du Zhong of the Purple Cloud Pavilion was stuck at a bottleneck for centuries.  He finally left seclusion, sealed his cultivation, abandoned his cultivator identity, entered the mortal world, married, had children, experienced birth, aging, illness, and death, and the cycle of life.  Through this, he understood the illusion and broke through his bottleneck. It became a famous story – a path of engagement with the world.</p><p>“Cultivating the heart has always had paths of seclusion and engagement, neither superior to the other!”</p><p>She finally let out the words she'd been holding back.</p><p>Shi Xue caught her breath, afraid she hadn’t explained clearly enough and might cause Liuli to misunderstand.  She quickly added, “This is just my personal opinion, Junior Sister. I don't know what the right choice is for you. I just hope you examine your heart, and don't let the cultivation method blind you, lest it harm your cultivation instead of benefiting it.”</p><p>Liuli listened silently, then looked at Shi Xue sincerely. “Senior Sister, I understand. Thank you.”</p><p>Shi Xue chuckled awkwardly, “I’m just theorizing, Junior Sister. Just take it as you will.”</p><p>Silence followed.</p><p>After flying for a while, they saw the desolate island, and then a figure emerged from the island, it was Qin Sang, sensing their arrival.</p><p>Shi Xue pursed her lips, but quickly regained her composure.</p><p>“I am Qingfeng, I greet the two immortals.”</p><p>Qin Sang flew forward and bowed.</p><p>Liuli returned the bow.</p><p>Shi Xue maintained the bearing of a sect leader, her demeanor unyielding. “You’re too kind! Daoist, you must have returned the sacred artifact. From now on, you are an honorary elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion, there’s no need for formality between us.”</p><p>Qin Sang laughed freely, “A newcomer, I hope for your guidance, Sect Leader. Please forgive any previous offenses, Sect Leader and Fairy Liuli. I've always been a solitary cultivator, accustomed to vigilance and caution – it's how I’ve survived this long.”</p><p>He offered a partly true, partly false explanation and apology.  Although Shi Xue’s strength wouldn’t cause him trouble, his future role as an honorary elder of the Listening Snow Pavilion would allow him access to the Xuan Tian Palace sacred grounds.  He didn’t want the Sect Leader to harbor resentment and hinder his actions.</p><p>*You dare mention it!*</p><p>Shi Xue muttered to herself.</p><p>But though she blamed Qin Sang for the artifact's damage, she understood it was due to the Xuan Tian Palace’s ambush. Qin Sang merely retaliated, and considering her junior sister, she didn't truly resent him.</p><p>Picking up on something in Qin Sang’s words, Shi Xue was surprised. “You’re a wandering cultivator?”</p><p>“I’ve had places to call home, but ultimately, I’ve been adrift.”</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Liuli.</p><p>Thinking back, he’d thought he could remain a disciple of Mount Shao Hua, but fate had other plans. Now, he’d built Qing Yang Temple with his own hands, yet it couldn't be relied upon as his own support.</p><p>Shi Xue's surprise deepened. A mere independent cultivator, yet achieving such accomplishments!  She mused, no wonder my junior sister remembers him so fondly.</p><p>The three of them flew towards Diting Island.</p><p>Shi Xue remembered something and looked at Qin Sang, "Are you really going to show your true face? If news of you reaches Xuantian Palace, you might be recognized."</p><p>Qin Sang was prepared and was about to take out his wide-brimmed hat.</p><p>Shi Xue swept her hand across her pouch and produced a mask thin as a cicada's wing.  "This is a Thousand Fox Mask. It can subtly alter your appearance, seamlessly.  Consider it borrowed for now. Your spiritual sense is strong; with this mask, only the Palace Master and Grand Elder of Xuantian Palace can detect flaws with the naked eye. You just need to avoid a few individuals with special treasures and techniques, but they usually only use them during fights to avoid offense.  Try to avoid them."</p><p>She deliberately emphasized the word 'borrowed'.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't mind, thanked her, and put on the mask, feeling an immediate coolness.</p><p>With the mask on, Qin Sang subtly moved his mind, his features shifted in a rather frightening way, then his appearance changed dramatically, his demeanor resembling a seasoned traveler.</p><p>"Truly exquisite!" Qin Sang praised. He didn't know how to refine such a unique artifact. With diligent study, he might be able to create one, but he wouldn't waste his time on it.</p><p>The Thousand Fox Mask only required spiritual energy to maintain, and Qin Sang's spiritual sense had reached the level of transformation, easily sustaining the minimal consumption.</p><p>Soon, Diting Island was in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang intentionally lagged behind, following the two women.</p><p>Diting Island had a peculiar shape, its coast lined with jagged rocks, while the interior was filled with towering ancient trees, vibrant with life, like a green jewel embedded in the sea.</p><p>The island was deserted, only the chirping of birds disturbed the quiet.</p><p>Around Diting Island, however, faint blue light drifted in the air, faintly visible in the daylight, remarkably unusual, clearly not ordinary.  Auspicious light and auspicious energy filled the air.</p><p>The three stopped their flight outside Diting Island, observing the treasure island.</p><p>Shi Xue softly exclaimed, "Could Old Man Diting know we're coming and have closed the island to visitors, opening the protective array ahead of time?"</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Sky-Eyed Butterfly to observe the depths of Diting Island.</p><p>Everything on the island seemed normal; there were no signs of a fight.</p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Shi Xue stepped forward and sent a stream of light into the array.</p><p>A moment later, a beautiful young woman emerged from the array.</p><p>The girl held a jade plate covered with red cloth, stood within the array, and bowed deeply, "Junior greets the three seniors."</p><p>Shi Xue saw that the girl was only at the Foundation Establishment stage and directly asked, "Is your ancestor on the island?"</p><p>"The ancestor is in seclusion," the girl answered calmly. "Are the three seniors here for the Diting Fruit?"</p><p>Shi Xue nodded, "Precisely."</p><p>The girl raised the jade plate, "This is one Diting Fruit. The ancestor instructed that if the seniors provide an equivalent treasure or spirit stones in exchange, they may take it."</p><p>The three exchanged glances, somewhat surprised that Old Man Diting was so readily offering one.</p><p>However, one Diting Fruit wasn't enough to satisfy them.</p><p>Shi Xue was about to speak when Qin Sang stopped her.</p><p>"Let's get this one first."</p><p>Shi Xue understood and remained silent.</p><p>Liu Li took out a medicinal herb prepared for the exchange and threw it into the array. After the girl checked it, she immediately unveiled the red cloth, presenting the fruit.</p><p>The Diting Fruit was yellow, shaped like an olive.  After the girl removed the restriction, a cold aura immediately gathered around the fruit; it was a Yin fruit.</p><p>After Liu Li secured the fruit...</p><p>Shi Xue cleared her throat and said, "Please convey to your master that we would like to purchase two more."</p><p>The girl was stunned, unexpected by the seemingly insatiable greed, momentarily unsure how to respond.</p><p>At that moment, a cold hum resonated from the island, a booming voice like thunder,  "Shi Zhangzuo, this fruit takes a hundred years to produce ten, and you want a third?  Furthermore, experts from your Tian Shan branch recently came under the guise of a joint effort against the demon race, demanding three fruits. I respect you as the head of Xuantian Palace and gave you one, but don't push your luck. The rest have been refined by me!"</p><p>Qin Sang quietly asked, "Has the situation deteriorated to this point?"</p><p>He knew the demon race was causing trouble in the Xingsha Islands, but he didn't expect a two-pronged attack, with Xuantian Palace also having to join forces with nearby factions against the demon race.</p><p>"The Great Saint Tianpeng is indeed ambitious, but he still has to deal with the Grand Elder."</p><p>Shi Xue frowned deeply.  "How could I not know about this joint resistance against the demon race?  Whose orders are they following?  Could it be Shang Lu's?  To stir up trouble while the Grand Elder is away, falsely claiming orders, and damaging the sect's reputation!"</p><p>Shang Lu is the head of the Tianshan lineage.</p><p>After explaining in a low voice to Qin Sang, she turned to look at Diting Island and asked loudly, "Senior, offering three Diting Fruits, are you trying to withdraw from this matter?"</p><p>"Diting Island will be closed for a hundred years. Please leave."</p><p>The Diting Elder didn't want to say more and was about to send them away.</p><p>At that moment, his tone suddenly changed, and he shouted angrily, "Stop! What are you doing!"</p><p>It turned out that Qin Sang had flown to the vicinity of the formation sometime before, his palm exuding true energy, lightly touching the formation, causing the nearby light to fluctuate.</p><p>The young woman's face paled, and she hurriedly fled into the island.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up and smiled, "Senior's formation has quite a few flaws. If the demon race targets it, I'm afraid it won't hold for long. Seeking peace and quiet, but failing to find it."</p><p>"Audacious! Who are you, to be so rude!" The Diting Elder flew into a rage.</p><p>Qin Sang sighed lightly, "This concerns a friend's path. I can only choose to help my friend, regardless of right or wrong."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang's figure flashed, and he pointed a finger at a void. The spiritual array's light flickered, revealing a flaw.</p><p>Although this flaw didn't affect the overall situation, the fact that Qin Sang could find one so quickly was enough to shock people.</p><p>Shi Xue became increasingly surprised by Qin Sang, and she quietly asked, "You also understand formations?"</p><p>"Slightly."</p><p>Qin Sang replied humbly.</p><p>In fact, he had obtained the complete inheritance of the Yuan Shen Gate, and with the assistance of the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, his ability to break formations was extraordinary; even great cultivators might not surpass him.</p><p>He could tell that the Diting Island formation was not top-tier, and the Diting Elder was only at the early Yuan Ying stage. Even if he personally controlled the formation, his changes would be limited.  He wondered how the Diting Elder managed to protect this spiritual tree.</p><p>It turned out that the Diting Fruit had a unique but limited effect, only assisting specific cultivators. No truly powerful cultivator was competing with him for it.</p><p>Even so, the Diting Elder had changed several locations. Every move caused the Diting Spirit Tree to suffer a great loss of energy. From the depths of the Boundless Sea to near Yinri Realm, he established a good relationship with the Xuan Tian Palace to stabilize the situation.</p><p>"You dare!"</p><p>The Diting Elder was furious.  "The Xuan Tian Palace claims to be a righteous sect, but its actions are so despicable. Aren't they afraid of being ridiculed by the world?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked enlightened and said regretfully, "I almost made a big mistake! I just met the two fairies, and was merely invited to the Xuan Tian Palace as a guest; I'm not a member of the Xuan Tian Palace. My actions have nothing to do with the Xuan Tian Palace. The two fairies, please step back and avoid being implicated by my misdeeds, affecting the reputation of Xuan Tian Palace."</p><p>Upon hearing this, both Liuli and Shi Xue were speechless, but they complied.</p><p>"You!"</p><p>The Diting Elder was furious.</p><p>Qin Sang put away his roguish expression and said seriously, "Daoist Diting, my previous words were just a joke; don't take them seriously. However, this concerns our path, and we certainly cannot give up the Diting Fruits. I believe Sect Leader Shi's offer won't leave you at a loss. As compensation, I can freely help you improve your island protection formation. I hope you will reconsider."</p><p>Shi Xue interjected at the right moment, stating her terms, willing to offer a higher price.</p><p>The Diting Elder fell silent.</p><p>He wasn't sure if Qin Sang was bluffing.  The other party claimed to be able to break his carefully arranged protective formation, which was rather arrogant.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's performance just now was indeed astonishing, and he had to consider this possibility.</p><p>If the other party, single-handedly, could really break the formation, where would his face be?</p><p>Shi Xue seemed determined to obtain the three Diting Fruits, leaving no room for refusal.</p><p>If Shi Xue gathered the forces under the Listening Snow Tower and launched a large-scale attack on Diting Island, using force to pressure him, he wouldn't be afraid. The Xuan Tian Palace wasn't united, and the case could be taken to Lingxiao Peak.</p><p>But this was difficult.</p><p>While the Diting Elder was pondering, Qin Sang continued his actions, finding two more flaws. The Diting Elder immediately changed the formation to cover them up, but his eyelids twitched wildly.</p><p>Seeing that the Diting Elder remained silent, Qin Sang was also secretly muttering to himself.</p><p>He had spoken very confidently, but this was after all a Yuan Ying cultivator's domain. Even if he could really break the formation, it would take some effort, and he would have to use his full strength, revealing his identity.</p><p>After a long silence, the Diting Elder's voice was hoarse as he asked, "Do you really improve this formation?"</p><p>"There are two options. First, I will improve this formation for you free of charge; second, I will help you refine a set of protective formations, much more powerful than this one, but you will have to collect the materials yourself," Qin Sang stood still, taking the opportunity to get another customer.</p><p>Having achieved great success in the art of refining, he should have more income and not be so strapped for cash.</p><p>He had no time for such things, constantly either in rigorous training or traveling.</p><p>“Your help won’t be free, will it?”</p><p>Elder Ditong snorted, “Old man needs to see your abilities first!”</p><p>As his words finished, the spiritual array’s light flickered, parting to reveal a path.</p><p>…</p><p>Seven days later.</p><p>Three figures flew from Ditong Island eastward—Qin Sang and the two women.  Ditong Island’s spiritual array pulsed with a幽蓝 light, like a shimmering blue eggshell over the sea, far denser and more powerful than before, before fading from sight.</p><p>Qin Sang spent seven days helping Elder Ditong perfect the array.  The power increase was less than ten percent, but he repaired several critical flaws.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Elder Ditong considered the array sufficient and didn't immediately require Qin Sang's further assistance. Fortunately, he obtained the other two Ditong fruits, and Elder Ditong also lowered his demands.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Liuli noticed the weariness in Qin Sang’s brow, understanding the immense mental strain he’d endured.</p><p>Shi Xue’s attitude toward Qin Sang also changed significantly.  “We owe you a great debt, Qingfeng Elder.  My sister and I will handsomely reward you upon our return.”</p><p>Qin Sang waved his hand. “No need for any reward. As a guest elder of the Listening Snow Tower, it's my duty.  If Master Shi finds my service satisfactory, I hope you can help me secure a place to witness the Sacred Land ceremony. Also, I have another matter to discuss with you, Master Shi. Do guest elders have the right to exchange for a Kan Shen Pearl?”</p><p>He’d given up the Kan Shen Pearl for the seven-story pagoda. This pearl could be refined by an external avatar to enhance cultivation, so he needed to find another way to obtain one.</p><p>Before Shi Xue could answer, Liuli said, “After entering the Sacred Land, I will help you acquire one.”</p><p>“Thank you, Fairy.  If there are any requirements, I will fulfill them!”</p><p>Qin Sang bowed his thanks.</p><p>After this event, the three were no longer as unfamiliar, having become much closer.</p><p>Traveling eastward, Shi Xue provided detailed information about the Listening Snow Tower and the Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Although the Listening Snow Tower ranks last among the four main branches, it remains a major branch. Even a weakened camel is larger than a horse. It has numerous Nascent Soul cultivators, including a mid-Nascent Soul expert, the current Palace Master of the Yuanji Palace in Xuan Tian Palace.</p><p>Unfortunately, this person is now quite elderly and struggling to maintain their position alone.</p><p>In Xuan Tian Palace, the Palace Master must come from the Xuan Tian lineage, while the Grand Elder position must be filled by the strongest cultivator outside of the Xuan Tian lineage, even from outside the main branches.  The current Grand Elder, Tong Lingyu, comes from the Zi Xia Xuan.</p><p>Mid-Nascent Soul cultivators can serve as elders or Palace Masters, but holding such positions prevents them from also serving as branch leaders. Therefore, Shi Xue serves as the leader of the Listening Snow Tower branch.</p><p>…</p><p>Unknowingly, the three entered the Yinri Realm.  Flying across the vast snowfield, they finally arrived at the Listening Snow Tower in the Northern Region.</p><p>Compared to Lingxiao Peak and Seventy-two Springs, the mountain range occupied by the Listening Snow Tower appeared exceptionally delicate. The snow-capped mountains meandered deep within the snowfields, lacking any extremely prominent peaks.</p><p>Qin Sang followed them into the protective mountain array.  At a glance, he saw exquisite pavilions and towers on each mountain peak, their design and layout meticulously planned.</p><p>Shi Xue and Liuli returned discreetly, without disturbing others. They planned to announce Qin Sang's appointment as guest elder in two years, to avoid any association with the mysterious expert from the Hun Mo Island and its recent events.</p><p>After escorting Qin Sang to the back mountain, Shi Xue pointed to a two-story building. “Daoist, you will stay here for the time being.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked closely.</p><p>The small building was situated near the mountaintop, perched on a raised rock.  The front yard was unobstructed, offering a breathtaking panoramic view.  From the second floor, one could see the boundless snow scenery.</p><p>The place was tranquil and undisturbed, with surrounding arrays. More importantly, the spiritual energy was extremely rich, making it an excellent secluded residence.</p><p>Qin Sang was very pleased.  After expressing his gratitude, he remembered something and quickly asked, “Is there an underground Yin vein nearby?”</p><p>Cultivating the *Cold Ming Gui Yin* technique requires an underground Yin vein to refine the spiritual body of the Nascent Soul puppet.</p><p>Shi Xue, having heard about Qin Sang's plan to refine an external avatar, pointed northeast. “Three hundred miles from here lies an underground Yin vein, but it's discontinuous, fluctuating in strength. You'll have to find a suitable location yourself.”</p><p>Then, Shi Xue and Liuli took their leave.</p><p>Qin Sang entered the small building, activated the array, and added several more restrictions.  Climbing to the second floor, he watched the snow scene for a while, pondering his situation.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Palace Sacred Land will open in ten years.  He needs to improve his strength as much as possible during this period.</p><p>The Sun God Tree can evolve on its own. Qin Sang has relatively few tasks.</p><p>He plans to stay at the Listening Snow Tower for a while, comprehending the *Seven Master Buddha Seal* and simultaneously cultivating the *Cold Ming Gui Yin* technique using the underground Yin vein.  Once his external avatar shows progress, he will journey to Hundred Flower Valley to trade with Valley Master Mu for the final spiritual item needed for the Ascending Spirit Sacrifice—Yin Ming Earth.</p><p>There’s no rush.</p><p>With these thoughts, Qin Sang slowly closed his eyes, the chapters of *Cold Ming Gui Yin* appearing in his mind.</p><p>――</p><p>――</p><p>I intended to write 10,000 words, but my mind is getting sluggish. I'll post this for now.</p>
