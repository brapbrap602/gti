<h1>Chapter 1889: Silver Threads Hanging in the Air</h1><p>“Greetings, Demon-Subduing Envoy!”</p><p>Two Grand Masters, their faces alight with joy, bowed deeply to Kun Dao at the altar.</p><p>Kun Dao and Zhang Zhenjun, both holding the rank of Zheng Erpin Jiu Tian Jin Que Shang Zai, served in the Daoist court as the Nine Heavens Demon-Subduing Envoy, presiding over the North Pole Exorcism Court.</p><p>Both showed clear signs of exhaustion.  The short time spent summoning the deity had greatly depleted their energy; they had been struggling to maintain themselves.</p><p>They had both sensed the unusual phenomenon during the altar ritual, recognizing it as a sign of a breakthrough.</p><p>However, Zhenjun's emergence was too swift, leaving them somewhat apprehensive. Seeing Zhenjun now, they breathed a collective sigh of relief.</p><p>Although Zhenjun’s aura was still unsteady after the breakthrough, even they could sense the significant increase in her cultivation; the breakthrough was a success!</p><p>Kun Dao gave a slight nod, then lightly tapped her feet, rising into the air. Her eyes, filled with divine light, swept across the battlefields to the north and south, paying particular attention to several Grand Master-level demonic beasts, including Ji Zhenjing.</p><p>Ji Zhenjing.</p><p>The nun, having transformed into the Taiyin Yuanjun, experienced a tremendous surge in power, but it also brought an unimaginable level of impact and pain.</p><p>This pain stemmed not only from the forceful infusion of power far exceeding her current cultivation, but also from the assault on her primordial spirit and will.</p><p>Invoking a high-level talisman deity was an immense test for those undergoing such transformations.</p><p>If one's mental fortitude and willpower were insufficient, even after summoning a high-level talisman deity, they could only manage to maintain their sanity with great effort, completely unable to control this immense power.</p><p>Because of this, Daoism places great emphasis on cultivating the disciple's mental strength, from initiation and instruction to daily practice, all requiring adherence to Daoist precepts.</p><p>The most common are the Three Refuges, Five Precepts, and Twelve Great Vows; many Daoist sects have their own unique precepts, such as the Xiang'er Nine Precepts, the Mingzhen Twenty-Four Precepts, or even the Three Hundred Great Precepts!</p><p>Daoism believes that worldly attachments and desires cloud the mind and pollute the spirit.</p><p>Observing precepts and rules, restraining oneself from evil deeds, not only forges one's Daoist heart but also cultivates goodness, accumulates merit, and builds virtue.</p><p>As a Grand Master, the nun's mental fortitude was naturally exceptional, allowing her to withstand the impact.</p><p>Her delicate body still trembled, her fists clenched, the veins in her jade arms bulging as she struggled to control the immense power within.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A tiger’s roar, like thunder, echoed from outside the city.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators who had ventured outside the city walls had retreated, using the city walls as a shield to strike down the relentless wave of beasts.</p><p>The ground outside the city was awash in blood, the corpses of monstrous beasts piled high, yet the onslaught was endless, the beasts clambering over their fallen comrades, savagely battering the city walls.</p><p>Protected by the city’s protective formation, the walls shimmered with golden light, standing firm.</p><p>Upon hearing the tiger’s roar, the beast horde’s assault noticeably slowed, but the Daoist cultivators within the city showed no relief, instead gazing in terror towards the city’s edge.</p><p>Rolling clouds of yellow smoke billowed from beyond the city walls, from within which a monstrous tiger burst forth, shattering mountains in its path, and with a final leap from the last peak.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The mountain peak crumbled.</p><p>The tiger soared through the air, its jaws agape, roaring as it lunged towards the city, completely ignoring the city’s protective formation.</p><p>Even separated by the city walls and the formation, everyone clearly felt the terrifying aura emanating from the tiger.</p><p>The Daoist cultivators were terrified, and the demon soldiers fared even worse; they grew restless, some trembling and falling to their knees. If not for strict laws, they would have scattered in panic.</p><p>At this moment, the pain on the nun’s face lessened slightly as the power within her finally stabilized.</p><p>She raised her right hand, her fingers gently gliding across the air, her sleeves dancing with her slender hand.</p><p>Spiritual energy gathered at her fingertips, leaving a trail of moon-white light in its wake.</p><p>In an instant, a divine talisman appeared.</p><p>This talisman, known as the Taiyin Mirror Talisman, previously required extensive preparation and complex spells and incantations for the nun to cast, with no guarantee of success.</p><p>Now, she drew it in the air effortlessly!</p><p>With a flick of her wrist, she lightly struck the talisman.</p><p>The tiger was now extremely close, about to pounce into the city, its two forepaws impossibly thick, like colossal stone pillars, crashing toward the walls!</p><p>The cultivators could clearly see the tiger's terrifyingly fierce gaze and its razor-sharp claws, filling them with dread.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The talisman shot towards the city’s edge, stopping before the tiger.</p><p>The next moment, the light exploded, like a rising moon.</p><p>The moonlight was dazzling, truly showcasing the silhouette of a full moon hanging before the tiger, like a precious mirror reflecting its image.</p><p>The tiger's roar ceased abruptly; its ferocious gaze shifted from the city to the Taiyin Mirror Talisman, its fur standing on end.</p><p>A powerful force from the magic mirror threatened to pull the beast inside.  However, the threat posed by the Yin Mirror Talisman was far less than that of the Broken Army Sword's phantom image.</p><p>The ferocious tiger, unyielding in the face of the Yin Mirror Talisman, roared even louder.  Instead of attacking the immortal city, it raised its forepaw and slammed it against the mirror.</p><p>*Bang!*</p><p>The mirror violently shook.  It had withstood the blow!</p><p>Before the crowd could cheer, a rapid succession of *bangs* echoed as the tiger's claws relentlessly pounded the mirror.  Cracks quickly spiderwebbed across its surface. The sound of shattering reached the immortal city, causing everyone's hearts to tremble.</p><p>The female Taoist priest's breath hitched.  She stepped forward, levitated above the city walls, and raised her arms. The protective city array blazed with dazzling golden light.  Even transformed into the Yin Yuan Jun, possessing power comparable to a True Monarch, she was no match for the tiger. Her divine power was gradually waning, and she relied on the array to defend the city.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Daoist cultivators understood their role and, led by  Real Person Ruòquán and others, formed an array to assist the priestess.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>The mirror shattered!</p><p>The tiger roared triumphantly, charged forward, and slammed into the city walls.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The earth shook.  A fissure ripped through the city walls, countless buildings collapsed, and many Daoist cultivators were thrown into the air. The priestess cast several talismans to stabilize the array.</p><p>The tiger attacked with frenzied abandon; its head, like an iron hammer, repeatedly struck the protective barrier.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!*</p><p>The array swayed precariously.  The cultivators within the city turned pale.  The priestess, exerting all her strength, protected the city and her fellow disciples.</p><p>*Oof!*</p><p>The priestess suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood, staggered, causing a collective gasp.</p><p>"Real Person Li!"  Real Person Ruòquán exclaimed, flying to support her.</p><p>The priestess shook her head, pushed him away, swallowed a pill, and continued casting talismans.</p><p>…</p><p>All this unfolded before Kun Dao's eyes. She moved to stand between the two Grand Real Persons, holding the White Stone Governing Seal, and softly said, "Take the pill."</p><p>Her voice, amplified through the governing altar, reached all subordinate altars.  The Zhongmao Governing Altar, and the Jingtan and Zongtan altars under the Tianshu Academy, all heard the command.</p><p>The Daoist court was a single entity. With the permission of the main governing master, other seal holders could assume control. Kun Dao assumed control of the Daoist dual governance, sending the order throughout the land!</p><p>Including the two Grand Real Persons at the Zhongmao Governing Altar, the cultivators presiding over the various altars rejoiced wildly upon hearing the True Monarch's command. They promptly took the pills and hastened their recovery.</p><p>Kun Dao produced a three-foot-long wooden sword, crafted from an unknown spirit wood.  Dark red, its wood grain was clearly visible, with a tassel hanging from the hilt. This was a Daoist ritual sword, often used in altar ceremonies for summoning divine generals, exorcising evil, and even freeing souls from purgatory.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Kun Dao raised the sword, pointing it towards the heavens.</p><p>"Flying Heaven Blazing Fire, Guiding Divine Dew."</p><p>A soft incantation echoed. The White Stone Governing Seal before Kun Dao shimmered, and the altar in the granting hall resonated, radiating golden light.  Simultaneously, similar phenomena occurred at altars throughout the dual governance.</p><p>The cultivators presiding over the altars were still refining the pill's energy.  As they moved to act, they sensed this ritual differed from previous ones; they weren't needed. This ritual required only the True Monarch and Grand Real Persons, drawing upon the power of all altars under the Daoist governance!</p><p>Where the sword pointed, luminous talismans, each character as large as a bucket, materialized in the void, using the heavens and earth as their parchment.</p><p>*Swish!*</p><p>Kun Dao pointed her sword to the East.</p><p>"East Rising Sun Valley, West Guiding Dragon Terrace."</p><p>Swiftly turning to the West, she then commanded the North and South.</p><p>"South Spinning Fire Palace, North Turning River Leader."</p><p>The incantation's power reached the celestial heights. Finally, Kun Dao again raised her sword to the sky. The talismans in the void burned, flames filled the air, and coalesced into a beam of light shooting towards the heavens.</p><p>"Drive the Dragon to Bring Rain, Talisman Follow Swiftly!"</p><p>The incantation ended.  Suddenly, the battlefield was engulfed in wind and cloud.</p><p>*Crack!*</p><p>Thunder roared.  The cultivators desperately defending the immortal city looked up, only to find the sky, at some point, shrouded in dark clouds, obscuring even the moon.</p><p>*Whoosh! Whoosh!*</p><p>The clouds gathered, a torrential downpour imminent.  This phenomenon wasn't limited to the immortal city; across the Daoist dual governance and the Jushan governance, in all places under attack, dark clouds gathered.  A heavy sense of oppression pervaded the battlefields.</p><p>*Rumble! Rumble!*</p><p>Thunderclouds rolled.  Some noticed figures amongst the lightning, sinister and indistinct, riding clouds and mist, like descending gods.  Some wielded thunder wedges, striking incessantly, unleashing bolts of lightning.</p><p>Some carried enormous, gaping sacks, buffeted by fierce winds.  Others cradled clay pots, pouring forth endless water that transformed into clouds.</p><p>…</p><p>“Celestial soldiers!”</p><p>“True Lord has summoned the gods to aid us!”</p><p>…</p><p>Unsuspecting cultivators cheered.</p><p>This was a summoning technique different from divine transformation.  The female cultivator channeled her power through talismans, summoning and commanding gods, harnessing the power of the divine court’s talismans, greatly amplifying their potency.</p><p>The talisman she now wielded, called the Rain-Summoning Talisman, sounded unremarkable, yet it summoned:</p><p>The Thunder God to call forth thunder.</p><p>The Wind Master to summon the wind.</p><p>The Rain Master to bring the rain!</p><p>As dark clouds gathered, the battlefield’s spiritual energy was consumed, surging madly into the clouds, making the shadowy figures within seem even more mysterious.</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Torrential rain lashed down on the battlefield.</p><p>This was no ordinary rain.  Raindrops fell like blades on the enemy, yet were like nectar to the cultivators.</p><p>The downpour washed over the battlefield.  Under the deluge, countless beasts perished.  The Daoist cultivators felt as if they’d consumed potent elixirs; their wounds and pain eased, their dantians replenished.</p><p>Jijing and the surrounding areas received special attention.  The torrential rain, like a celestial waterfall, poured down. The female cultivator, bathed in the rain, looked more flushed, while outside the city, the ferocious tigers, struck by the cascading water, shook their heads wildly, pained expressions on their faces.  They finally abandoned their assault on the walls, exhaling yellow clouds to shield themselves from the rain.</p><p>Instantly, the Daoist side’s morale soared!</p><p>The dire situation on the battlefield was temporarily eased, especially for Gushanzhi, who was on the verge of collapse; this support was invaluable.</p><p>The female cultivator sheathed her sword, her gaze shifting, suddenly fixing on Gushanzhi.</p><p>In the Grand Saint Mansion,</p><p>a demon king was beating a demonic drum, inexplicably feeling a chill in his heart.  Other demon kings around him felt their hair stand on end, their faces etched with fear.</p><p>Fortunately, this ominous feeling was fleeting.</p><p>The female cultivator didn't attack the Grand Saint Mansion or seize the demonic drum. Her gaze lifted, toward the South Heavenly Gate.</p><p>At that moment, Tianyue Supreme and the five-clawed golden dragon were locked in fierce battle, sword light and golden flames intertwining in a chaotic scene.</p><p>Tianyue Supreme, alone with his sword, confronted the transformed five-clawed golden dragon and the demon formations within the Grand Saint Mansion.  He firmly blocked the enemy’s advance, each charge repelled by his sword.</p><p>But at a heavy cost.  Tianyue Supreme’s face was ashen, a trace of blood on his lips, yet his bearing remained undiminished, standing firm before the South Heavenly Gate, like a guardian deity!</p><p>The two True Lords couldn’t conceal the momentum of their breakthrough; the five-clawed golden dragon had noticed.  It became even more frenzied, swirling golden flames and demonic lightning, relentlessly attacking Tianyue Supreme.</p><p>The female cultivator dared not act rashly, only diverting some of the Rain-Summoning Talisman’s power to help Tianyue Supreme recover.</p><p>Her gaze continued upward, past the South Heavenly Gate, into the divine court.  She saw celestial mountains and palaces, and streaks of light chasing each other between them.  Her gaze paused on Qin Sang for a moment, then continued upwards, beyond the nine heavens, the Thunder Emperor’s Hall, the Divine Soaring Palace, and even higher.</p><p>There, in the deep night sky, normally quiet and still, the emergence of the divine court caused ripples.  And in the boundless void, concentric ripples appeared.</p><p>Like gently swaying water, the ripples spread, growing wider, their center suddenly flashing silver. Then, a silver thread descended into this world from the edge of the sky.</p><p>The thread, thin and transparent, like an ordinary fishing line, gently swayed its tip, creating ripples in the void, rapidly descending, its target: the divine court!</p><p>In an instant, the tip of the silver thread arrived above the divine court, paused slightly, and then plunged down!</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The South Heavenly Gate shook violently.</p><p>The female cultivator’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the divine court,</p><p>Qin Sang was fleeing for his life, pursued by two demon kings, relying on repeated teleportation to survive.  But this wasn’t sustainable; even if Qin Sang could hold on, the patrolling divine prohibitions were at their limit.</p><p>The golden dragon pulling the chariot was becoming increasingly translucent; its scales were barely visible. A few more attempts, and only a dragon’s shadow would remain.</p><p>Still, no Daoist reinforcements appeared.</p><p>Qin Sang fled into a palace. The spiritual light barrier outside would be broken in an instant, and he’d have to flee again. His expression was numb, bordering on despair.  This time, unlike previous crises, he was helpless, unable to conceive how to escape the two demon kings.</p><p>‘Rumble!’</p><p>Before fleeing, Qin Sang suddenly noticed that the palace’s shaking was unusual.  He thought reinforcements had arrived, hope flaring, but realized it wasn't so after fleeing.  The source of the tremor was above!</p><p>At that moment, Qin Sang, the two demon kings, and the demon god who had broken through the prohibitions in Lei City, all felt it and looked up.</p><p>Above the divine court, ripples spread, and a silver thread pierced the divine court’s barrier!</p><p>(End)</p>
