<h1>Chapter 324: Soul-Attracting Grass</h1><p>The strong man only had three Thousand Vine Flowers.</p><p>The efficacy of spiritual herbs varies greatly, making it difficult to accurately assess their value.</p><p>However, judging by the auction's momentum, the Heart-Calming Fruit would certainly fetch an extremely high price. After weighing the pros and cons, most people began to back down.</p><p>However, the Thousand Vine Flower is also a rare spiritual herb, and it seems that many people are trying to bypass the Heart-Calming Fruit and trade directly with the strong man.</p><p>The strong man was flustered for a moment, so he clasped his fists and shouted loudly, "I only wish to exchange for the Heart-Calming Fruit, or a similar pill that can nourish the soul. Fellow cultivators, if you do not have such a pill, please don't waste your breath."</p><p>It was quite a scene, but the auction of the Heart-Calming Fruit was not affected, and the price continued to rise.</p><p>Unfortunately, many people were vying for the Heart-Calming Fruit, and it indeed sold for a price far exceeding its inherent value. A few who had their eyes on the Thousand Vine Flowers tried raising their bids several times before also giving up.</p><p>Qin Sang bid twice before deciding to give up.</p><p>Spending so much to exchange for several Thousand Vine Flowers that were currently useless to him wasn't worthwhile.</p><p>Ultimately, a female cultivator bought the Heart-Calming Fruit at a price that left the strong man despairing, and she showed no intention of trading with him.  It seemed the Heart-Calming Fruit was precisely the herb she desperately needed.</p><p>The strong man slumped into his chair, utterly dejected.</p><p>Some people remained persistent, trying to contact him to trade, but the strong man refused them all.</p><p>The auction didn't stop because of the strong man.  One item after another was auctioned, but unfortunately, no more pills with similar effects to the Heart-Calming Fruit appeared.</p><p>"Next item! Soul-Attracting Grass!"</p><p>Gao Yi's excited voice invigorated Qin Sang. In his previous bids, he had been hesitant and reluctantly passed on items, only buying a Falling Phoenix Vine of comparable quality to the Earthfire Pandanus, fearing that excessive spending would affect his ability to bid on the Soul-Attracting Grass.</p><p>Finally, the moment had arrived! The Soul-Attracting Grass!</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Gao Yi lifted the red cloth, revealing three jade boxes arranged side by side on the tray!</p><p>Each jade box contained a spiritual herb dug up by the roots, a Soul-Attracting Grass!</p><p>The Soul-Attracting Grass was completely jet black, with three leaves branching out from the root, but they didn't spread in different directions. Instead, they intertwined like three vines, twisting together to form a bud-like shape at the top—a truly unique sight.</p><p>During its growth, the Soul-Attracting Grass undergoes four transformations: white, green, dark green, and finally jet black—the sign of maturity!</p><p>As soon as the Soul-Attracting Grass appeared, the hall erupted in an uproar, with several gasps of astonishment.</p><p>Some even stood up abruptly, staring intently at the tray with fervent eyes.</p><p>Many cultivators who had spent lavishly earlier sighed regretfully.</p><p>Seeing this, Qin Sang felt a sudden tightening in his chest, a sense of unease. He realized he had underestimated the Soul-Attracting Grass's appeal to demonic and heretical cultivators.</p><p>Each leaf of the Soul-Attracting Grass can be used to refine a Heavenly Corpse Talisman; one plant yields three, though there's a chance of failure.  However, having studied the Heavenly Yin Corpse Technique for quite some time, Qin Sang was confident he could create at least two.</p><p>Judging by their fervent expressions, the competition for the Soul-Attracting Grass would be fierce. Qin Sang dared not hope to obtain all three.</p><p>He would strike first, sparing no expense to secure the first plant, and then decide about the remaining two based on the situation.</p><p>That was Qin Sang's decision.</p><p>With his resources, securing the first plant should be easy, though the price would far exceed his expectations.</p><p>Still, obtaining at least two living corpses would be worthwhile.</p><p>"Three mature Soul-Attracting Grasses, beneficial to the cultivation methods of many demonic and unorthodox cultivators. It seems everyone knows the value of this item. I will only briefly introduce it..."</p><p>Gao Yi's lips curled into a slight smile as he announced the starting price.</p><p>"The owner of the Soul-Attracting Grass requests that all three be auctioned together. They would rather it remain unsold than be separated. The starting bid is a talisman treasure with at least 70% of its original power remaining; attack talismans are preferred!"</p><p>All three plants together!</p><p>No spirit stones, no magic tools, no pills—only talisman treasures!</p><p>This condition was like a bucket of cold water, instantly extinguishing the heated atmosphere.</p><p>The hall fell silent, everyone looking at each other in astonishment.</p><p>Among these Foundation Establishment cultivators, how many possessed talisman treasures?</p><p>Moreover, requiring the talisman treasure to retain at least 70% of its power was excessively demanding.</p><p>"This old one is willing to offer 7,000 low-grade spirit stones to purchase a talisman treasure in exchange for the Soul-Attracting Grass.  Is there any fellow cultivator willing to part with one?" A raspy voice suddenly echoed through the hall.</p><p>7,000 low-grade spirit stones—enough to buy two top-quality magic tools. This price wasn't a bad deal for the talisman treasure.</p><p>However, no one was selling at that price.</p><p>“Seven thousand spirit stones for a talismatic treasure?  Friend, you're dreaming! I'll offer seven thousand five hundred!”  Immediately, someone raised the bid.</p><p>“Eight thousand!”</p><p>…</p><p>The spirit stones reached nine thousand, leaving only a handful of serious contenders.</p><p>Unfortunately, only their voices echoed in the hall; no one else responded.  Clearly, a mere sum of spirit stones wasn't enough to tempt the owner of the treasure.</p><p>“Two top-grade magical artifacts, plus two thousand spirit stones! Is there anyone willing to trade?”</p><p>Finally, someone offered something else in exchange.  A pained expression was evident in his voice; he clearly was parting with cherished possessions, likely his personal artifacts.</p><p>Qin Sang, having participated in the bidding, quickly realized this approach was futile.  He began observing the crowd carefully.</p><p>Gao Yi stood on the high platform, smiling serenely at the escalating bids below.</p><p>Many people were secretly communicating with Gao Yi, their intentions clear to Qin Sang – they hoped to buy the Soul-calling Grass separately or negotiate other terms.</p><p>It seemed their requests were refused, as sighs of disappointment rippled through the hall.</p><p>Eventually, Qin Sang noticed several individuals who caught his attention:</p><p>A woman in red.</p><p>A Daoist priest in a dark blue robe, his face unobstructed by any protective artifact.</p><p>A slender young man in battle armor.</p><p>A boy who appeared no older than fifteen, a subtle smile playing on his lips.</p><p>…</p><p>They shared a common trait: their auras were exceptionally subtle, imperceptible to Qin Sang. He guessed they were likely late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p>These individuals also kept their eyes on the Soul-calling Grass, silent and observant, seemingly weighing the value of exchanging their talismatic treasures.  The rising bids held no sway over them.</p><p>This heightened Qin Sang’s sense of alarm.</p><p>The auction house in Yinshan Pass was renowned, attracting many powerful cultivators.  The presence of several individuals possessing talismatic treasures was perfectly normal.</p><p>For these people, spirit stones and top-grade artifacts were not necessities. Only equally rare treasures could pique their interest.</p><p>Even if he offered his spirit stones, artifacts, and the nearly-broken Silver Knife talisman, he would only exhaust himself in a frustrating stalemate.</p><p>Besides those, only two thousand-year-old spirit herbs were of significant value to him.</p><p>If he hesitated to part with his herbs, he would be the first to give up as the price continued to climb, as his resources were undoubtedly less than theirs.</p>
