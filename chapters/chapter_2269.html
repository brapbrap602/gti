<h1>Chapter 2259: The Death of Senior Brother</h1><p>The identity of Tian Qi has been dormant for too long and is no longer suitable.  Qin Sang plans to return to human territory first. If things go wrong, the Qingluan Clan won't be able to trace him.</p><p>In fact, after contacting the mysterious Qingluan and learning the truth about the illusion, Qin Sang has better access to information about the Qingluan Clan. If there's any reason to stay in the demon realm, it's the possibility of encountering the Shadow Demons and gathering intelligence on them.</p><p>Qin Sang feels the mysterious Qingluan was evasive about the Shadow Demons.  He wonders if it's hiding a secret, or if even the mysterious Qingluan doesn't fully understand the Shadow Demons' true nature.</p><p>And the so-called "Celestial Secret"—even the mysterious Qingluan is unclear about what it is. Naturally, the Shadow Demons, born from the "Celestial Secret," remain equally enigmatic.</p><p>Returning to the old battlefield, years have passed, and it's completely changed.</p><p>The demons won a decisive victory, occupying what was once human territory, pushing the front lines significantly westward.</p><p>Flying through the air, Qin Sang repeatedly saw unusually lush forests.  These areas, despite the ravages of war, weren't desolate but instead thrived, seemingly nourished by bloodshed.</p><p>A small sample reveals the whole picture: the current battle is incredibly fierce.</p><p>Qin Sang flew west for some time before finding the location of the human camp.  Relieved, he remembered establishing a cave dwelling there before leaving and contacting acquaintances, telling them he was going into seclusion and that any messages should be sent there.</p><p>The front lines hadn't reached his dwelling, which should be unaffected.</p><p>On an inconspicuous hillside, Qin Sang descended from the sky, opened the protective formation, and entered the cave. He immediately saw countless glowing lights, flitting about erratically within the spirit formation.</p><p>He collected and examined them one by one.</p><p>Most were from fellow disciples, aside from those from the Immortal City.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced through them.  Most messages in the earlier years were from Senior Brother Qing Yan, as they had entered the battlefield together and could support each other. But later, Senior Brother Qing Yan suddenly stopped sending messages, and they were replaced by messages from Senior Sister Qing Hong.</p><p>Qin Sang reviewed the talismans, which mostly contained inquiries and expressions of concern, but a sense of foreboding crept into his heart.</p><p>"Hopefully, they simply switched roles," Qin Sang thought, turning to the last letter, sent last month.  It revealed Qing Hong's location, so he set off.</p><p>Thirteen days later, Qin Sang found Qing Hong.</p><p>"Junior Brother, you're finally out of seclusion!"</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang, Qing Hong rejoiced, relieved. She repeatedly murmured, "Junior Brother is alright!  Junior Brother is alright!"</p><p>For years, she had sent messages periodically without receiving a reply, causing her to worry greatly about his safety.</p><p>After her initial joy, Qing Hong's expression dimmed, sadness flashing in her eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang noticed this and asked gravely, "Did something happen to Senior Brother?"</p><p>"Senior Brother… he was escorting treasures and suddenly ambushed by demonic beasts. He was killed," Qing Hong cried, tears in her eyes.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this and sighed regretfully.</p><p>Qing Yan was dead.  According to the Immortal City's requirements, someone from Yuanjing Mountain had to replace him—Qing Hong.</p><p>Even knowing it was all an illusion, these people were so vivid, and their emotions towards him were real. His grief was natural. Now, Qin Sang understood why so many cultivators couldn't overcome their heart demons and ultimately succumbed to their karmic retribution.</p><p>He had the jade Buddha protecting him—a significant advantage.</p><p>"Before I left, a senior from the Immortal City summoned me. I asked him to let Senior Brother stay behind. I never imagined…"</p><p>Qin Sang saw Yuanjing Mountain as the foundation for his future power, especially since his fellow disciples were trustworthy. Now, he had lost one.</p><p>Qing Yan's remains were lost; only a memorial tomb was erected at Yuanjing Mountain.</p><p>"Have you found out who killed Senior Brother?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qing Hong said, "Only that it was a powerful Yanlei Bird. Three were involved; they passed through the area where Senior Brother perished."</p><p>"Then kill them all!" Qin Sang said coldly.</p><p>"Junior Brother, don't be impulsive. They're all top-tier experts, even Master isn't their match."</p><p>Pulling herself together, Qing Hong said, "Junior Brother, you've been gone so long.  You should go back to pay respects to Senior Brother.  Your junior sister has been very worried about you."</p><p>"Is Master still in seclusion?" Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Qing Hong shook her head gently.</p><p>Qin Sang considered it and said, "I will stay to avenge Senior Brother; I can't return to the mountain immediately, but Senior Sister should go back!"</p><p>Before Qing Hong could respond, Qin Sang continued, "Senior Sister, don't worry; I have ways. The Immortal City values me highly.  Any reasonable request will be granted. As long as we are patient and wait for the right opportunity, we will succeed.”</p><p>Qing Hong's worried expression didn't fade.  "What excuse will I use to return to the mountain?"</p><p>"I will use merit to secure Shijie's return.  Once back, Shijie will undertake a task…"</p><p>Pausing, Qin Sang asked, "Shijie, did you receive the jade scroll I sent back to the sect?"</p><p>Qing Hong nodded.  "Thanks to your insights, my junior sister and I have both made significant progress in our cultivation."</p><p>Qin Sang could see that Qing Hong had already broken through to the Yuan Ying stage, clearly benefiting from the scroll.  Its contents detailed his insights gained on the Water-Fire Bridge, highly useful for cultivating the Water-Fire Harmony technique.</p><p>"Shijie, you should feel it. With these insights, our sect's cultivation speed will surpass other sects. However, our late start and small number of disciples hinder our development.  Your return should focus on widely recruiting disciples and passing on our Dao. I believe that one day, our Yuan Jing Mountain will become a major power, bringing glory to our lineage!"</p><p>Ambition gleamed in Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>The war was so brutal, many sect masters and elders of smaller sects surely perished, effectively destroying those sects.  With their high-level fighters gone, the remaining disciples would be leaderless and fearful, eager for protection—easy to draw into Yuan Jing Mountain.  They would be the cream of the crop, already vetted, saving us the trouble of testing them.</p><p>The war clouds hung over the city, the major powers preoccupied with self-preservation. This is the perfect time for Yuan Jing Mountain to flourish.</p><p>As for territory, it's time to settle the score with Tian Jing Sect.</p><p>But Qin Sang's true goal wasn't the glory he spoke of.</p><p>His original plan was to build his own power base once the time was right.</p><p>His strength lay in his clear-headedness. He could plan ahead; when the final battle came, his opponents would still be awakening, while he would be strong, ready to utilize the power of illusions and a massive army.</p><p>He didn't need unwavering loyalty from these disciples; he only needed them to be effective in the final battle.</p><p>However, the truth revealed by the mysterious Azure Bird made Qin Sang realize he'd been too naive. His opponents weren't just the otherworldly cultivators, or at least, not only them.</p><p>Omens appeared earlier than Qin Sang expected.  The sacred treasure might appear before Yuan Jing Mountain could grow strong, rendering his plan largely ineffective.</p><p>Still, Qin Sang intended to proceed.  The future was unpredictable; it might prove useful after all.</p><p>Qing Hong was shocked by Qin Sang's ambition, finding her junior brother strangely unfamiliar. She hesitated. "Those disciples, joining Yuan Jing Mountain mid-way, might still yearn for their old sect…"</p><p>Qin Sang had a solution. "Shijie, divide the disciples into inner and outer sects. Only those who pass the trials join the inner sect, weeding out the weak.  The world is in chaos, a time of great struggle. No one can remain untouched. Master must have foreseen this, which is why we were tasked to expand the sect."</p><p>Qing Hong was swayed.</p><p>Having served as acting sect leader and experienced the brutal realities of war, her resolve was far stronger than before.  She nodded firmly. "Good! We'll follow our junior brother's lead!"</p><p>After further discussion, Qin Sang quietly left.</p><p>…</p><p>In a large camp built by the city's forces, under the cover of night, the camp gate opened silently. A group of cultivators slipped away unnoticed, melting into the darkness.</p><p>They avoided the demons' eyes, climbing mountains and crossing valleys, gradually distancing themselves from the battlefield.</p><p>The two leaders stopped.</p><p>One said to the other, "Sect Leader Chen, let's part ways here. We'll meet again after the task is complete."</p><p>Moonlight illuminated the other's face – Sect Leader Chen of Tian Jing Sect.  No one could stay neutral in this war; Sect Leader Chen had personally joined the fighting.</p><p>"Until we meet again!"</p><p>Sect Leader Chen nodded, leading half the cultivators away.</p><p>He was somewhat gloomy. Years ago, in an unsolved mystery, he lost his son, and his relationship with the demons was severed.  His focus on finding a new path had led him to neglect his position in the city; his attempts to rectify the situation came too late, leaving him repeatedly stymied, treated like a pawn.</p><p>Fortunately, this mission wasn't overly dangerous.</p><p>As soon as this thought crossed his mind, Sect Leader Chen saw three dark figures on the mountain ahead. His heart tightened. "Who's there?!"</p><p>The cultivators stopped, vigilantly watching the figures.</p><p>The figure in the middle laughed mockingly. "Sect Leader Chen, you lost your only son; have you fathered another heir?"</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Sect Leader Chen was furious, a sudden premonition seizing him.  Two dark figures lunged at him from either side.</p><p>Caught off guard, Sect Leader Chen was quickly slain. The others, far weaker than him, swiftly followed.</p><p>"Master, the humble servant has completed the task."</p><p>The two figures, having finished the slaughter, flew back to the mountain. They were demon cultivators.</p><p>Another shadowy figure was Qin Sang.  Years ago, plotting against Grandmaster Chen required careful planning, but now he didn't even need to act himself.  These two demon cultivators were captured by Qin Sang and willingly allowed him to implant control talismans within them.  Furthermore, Qin Sang had also subdued several transformed demon cultivators, intending to make them loyal to Qing Hong and bring them back to the sect as enforcers.</p><p>Qin Sang turned and left with the two demon cultivators, leaving behind a pile of corpses.  Next, Qin Sang declared his seclusion was over, re-established contact with the Immortal City, joined the battle, and achieved great military merit. He then used this merit to bring his senior sister, Qing Hong, back to the mountain.</p><p>Everything proceeded smoothly according to Qin Sang's plan.</p><p>…</p><p>"Senior, have you sensed a change in the celestial patterns again?" the mysterious Azure Vermillion Bird regained consciousness. Qin Sang asked, though he already knew the answer.</p><p>"A celestial omen… it doesn't mean… the treasure will appear immediately, but… I have a feeling…" the mysterious Azure Vermillion Bird hesitated,  "…the treasure might… appear in a way… we… can't imagine…"</p><p>It then pressed Qin Sang,  "The sacred object… how is it…"</p><p>"With all due respect, Senior, I have successfully refined a sliver of the sacred object's power!" Qin Sang exclaimed excitedly.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>The Azure Vermillion Bird's tone rose. It had only casually inquired, not expecting Qin Sang to succeed so quickly.</p><p>"Absolutely true.  It's a pity you can't see it, Senior. My cultivation has recently progressed greatly," Qin Sang said gratefully. "It's all thanks to you, Senior. I'm forever in your debt!"</p><p>Refining the sacred object wasn't as successful as Qin Sang made it sound. He hadn't yet grasped the properties of the Azure Vermillion Bird clan's sacred object. However, Qin Sang had to say this to make his rapid cultivation improvement believable, allowing himself to quickly become stronger and reach the peak of the Transcendence Transformation stage.</p><p>Qin Sang had been wanting the mysterious Azure Vermillion Bird to use its divine abilities to help him find the stone pavilion, but he lacked a suitable pretext.  If he encountered a bottleneck or claimed to be afflicted by a demonic obsession, asking the Azure Vermillion Bird for help wouldn't arouse suspicion, as bottlenecks and demonic obsessions are unpredictable.</p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p>The mysterious Azure Vermillion Bird couldn't contain its excitement, repeating the word "good" several times.  It urged Qin Sang to diligently cultivate, quickly grasp the true Dharma form to support more powerful divine abilities, and passed on its insights on comprehending the Dharma form to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>However, the day after his exchange with the mysterious Azure Vermillion Bird, he found an excuse to leave the battlefield, flying southwest to Mount Yuji.</p><p>"Fei Long pays his respects to Senior!"</p><p>The former herbalist boy had grown up. He looked at the person who had changed his life with gratitude.</p><p>Che Fei Long knew what Qin Sang cared most about, so he reported, "The fairy the Senior asked me to wait for has not returned."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, not surprised.</p><p>He gazed at the stone pavilion for a moment, then set up an array to conceal it, blocking out the starlight.</p><p>Che Fei Long didn't understand but dared not ask.</p><p>"Continue guarding here," Qin Sang paused. "You can pass on the Dao techniques I taught you."</p><p>"Yes!  My descendants will forever guard this place, awaiting the fairy for Senior!"</p><p>Che Fei Long bowed respectfully. When he looked up, the figure had vanished without a trace.</p><p>…</p><p>Before Mount Yuji.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure flickered, then disappeared into the cliff face.</p><p>He had recently broken through, achieving a level comparable to a late Nascent Soul cultivator in the "Water and Fire Harmony" technique.  Based on his observation of Mount Yuji's grand array, this level wasn't enough to pass the array's test and become the master of Mount Yuji.</p><p>However, Qin Sang's true strength was far greater, able to fight against late Transcendence Transformation cultivators without losing. He wondered if this strength would be enough to force his way through.</p><p>Standing at the head of the stone bridge, Qin Sang's eyes flickered. After a moment of contemplation, he stepped onto the bridge.</p><p>In an instant, strange phenomena arose on both sides of the bridge, overwhelming Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang walked slowly, unafraid of the imminent threat. Occasionally he would stop to meditate before continuing, step by step, until he reached the other side of the bridge.</p>
