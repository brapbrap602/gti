<h1>Chapter 760: Completion</h1><p>The Demonic Jiao manifested.</p><p>The four cultivators wielding the Black Dragon Talismans sensed the demonic energy emanating from the Black Jiao, and were both surprised and shocked.</p><p>This type of demonic energy was rarely seen in the world; although not large in quantity, it was extremely pure, comparable to ancient demonic energy.</p><p>They wondered what kind of expert could seal such demonic energy within a talisman.</p><p>Though they had encountered demonic cultivators before, they had never seen such pure demonic energy.  With the Black Jiao circling before them, they even felt as if they were about to be eroded by it.</p><p>The Liu couple and the others were secretly alarmed.  Without hesitation, they followed Xiang Yi's instructions and urged the Black Jiao to lunge at the iron chains in front of them.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Black Jiao roared furiously.</p><p>The Liu couple and the others were tense, struggling to restrain the Black Jiao.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>Almost simultaneously, the four Black Jiao lunged at the iron chains.</p><p>‘Clang!…’</p><p>The iron chains shook violently. The Black Jiao threw their entire bodies onto the chains, coiling around them. At the same time, surging demonic energy erupted from their bodies, covering the chains.</p><p>The Black Jiao's true form was actually composed of demonic energy.</p><p>The iron chains, originally radiating Heavenly Lightning, transforming into Lightning Chains, were now submerged in demonic energy.</p><p>From the outside, only demonic energy was visible.  Intermittently, flashes of silver light could be seen within, but as the demonic energy grew denser, even the Heavenly Lightning couldn't break through.</p><p>This completely enraged the restrictions on the iron chains.</p><p>The chains shook wildly, thunder and lightning flashing.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>In an instant, everyone's ears rang, and all they could hear was the earth-shattering thunder.</p><p>The demonic energy began to show signs of instability, repeatedly bulging outwards – clearly caused by the restrictions on the iron chains.</p><p>The Heavenly Lightning had erupted, but it was temporarily unable to penetrate the demonic energy, firmly sealed within.</p><p>The four Black Jiao Talismans had truly suppressed the restrictions on the iron chains!</p><p>However, it was evident that this suppression couldn't last.  Under the impact of the Heavenly Lightning, the demonic energy was being consumed at an alarming rate, gradually thinning, and would soon be completely depleted.</p><p>Xiang Yi glanced at the Lightning Chains. Seeing this, his expression became anxious. He whispered something to the richly dressed, stout man, and the two suddenly exerted their power simultaneously.</p><p>The jade awl struck the Ancient Divine Platform's restriction, emitting a teeth-grinding sound.</p><p>Black light and golden light collided, neither yielding, locked in a stalemate.</p><p>As Xiang Yi and the stout man exerted their full strength, the jade awl suddenly began to spin rapidly. The black light condensed towards the center, focusing its attack on a single point of the golden light.</p><p>With the change in the jade awl, the golden light began to fluctuate frequently, becoming dim.</p><p>Xiang Yi saw his opportunity.  His eyes widened, and he roared, “Break!”</p><p>‘Crack!’</p><p>The jade awl suddenly exploded. The residual black light, like sharp swords, pierced into the golden light.</p><p>With a resounding crack, the golden light finally split open, revealing a large hole.</p><p>Xiang Yi's face lit up with joy.  Without hesitation, he pushed off the ground and flashed to the opening in the golden light.</p><p>The golden light pulsed; the ancient restriction was automatically restoring itself.</p><p>Through the golden light, the full view of the Ancient Divine Platform within could be seen.</p><p>As expected, the golden light was merely a manifestation of the ancient restriction.  The platform itself was very simple, constructed from plain stone blocks, without even any engravings.</p><p>Although the ancient restriction was broken, the damaged area still held extraordinary power. Xiang Yi knew clearly that they were able to break the restriction not because of their own strength, but because of these strange talismans.</p><p>With a mix of excitement and trepidation, Xiang Yi steeled himself and rushed in.</p><p>Outside the Ancient Divine Platform, everyone nervously watched Xiang Yi's actions.</p><p>Once the task was complete, they could escape.  Due to Cultivator Pan's betrayal, they had lost some time, but fortunately, the task itself was relatively easy, so the time spent wasn't excessive, and they still had ample time remaining.</p><p>After rushing in, Xiang Yi stood on the first step of the Divine Platform.</p><p>The four iron chains vibrated even more violently, Heavenly Lightning raining down. The increasingly thin demonic energy was gradually losing its hold, but other than that, no other unusual phenomena occurred.</p><p>The Ancient Divine Platform remained quiet.</p><p>Xiang Yi looked up and then quickly ascended towards the top of the platform.</p><p>At this moment, everyone suddenly looked behind them, having heard the roars of ferocious beasts.</p><p>The emergence of the Divine Platform had already caused quite a commotion, and the suppression of the iron chains had led to the eruption of Heavenly Lightning, which undoubtedly alerted even more beasts.</p><p>However, the number of beasts was far smaller than expected.  Everyone quickly realized the reason: the earlier chaos caused by Cultivator Pan had drawn many of the nearby beasts away.</p><p>With this realization, everyone's faces brightened, feeling the pressure greatly reduced.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The first beast entered their field of vision.  Shaped like a male lion, its roar shook the heavens, comparable to a sonic spell.</p><p>Cultivator Liu's gaze darkened. A bell appeared in his palm, which he gently shook, producing a clear, ringing sound. Ripples, visible to the naked eye, spread outwards.</p><p>The bell's sound wasn't loud, but after it appeared, the beast's roar was abruptly suppressed.</p><p>The beast, enraged, spread its limbs, its sharp claws and teeth bared, ready to pounce.  At that moment, the bell's ripples touched its body.</p><p>With a 'poof', the beast's eyes suddenly bulged, two streams of blood spurting out.  It then crashed heavily to the ground, lifeless.</p><p>Its entire body, except for its eyes, was without a single scratch, yet it had died instantly.</p><p>Similar scenes played out in other directions.  A large group of beasts surrounded them.  The five cultivators, while manipulating their talismans, hunted the beasts, keeping a close eye on Xiang Yi's actions.</p><p>Xiang Yi had reached the top of the Ancient Divine Platform.  He crouched there for a moment, then took something from his storage pouch.</p><p>From below, the others couldn't see clearly, but it seemed to be another talisman.</p><p>Xiang Yi held the object in his hand, aiming it at the center of the Divine Platform, muttering something under his breath.</p><p>Black energy surged from his palm and then retracted.</p><p>Then, with a low shout, Xiang Yi flipped his hand and pressed it firmly against the Ancient Divine Platform.</p><p>‘Hum!’</p><p>The Ancient Divine Platform vibrated.</p><p>Xiang Yi withdrew his hand, nervously watching the platform.  Noticing no other unusual changes, a smile appeared on his face. He quickly descended the platform, rushed out of the restriction, and called out, “Mission accomplished! Fellow Daoists, prepare to withdraw!”</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was surprised. They looked up at the top of the Ancient Divine Platform. “It’s done already?”</p><p>No one saw Xiang Yi retrieve any treasure from the platform; he seemed to have left something behind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at the final stage, not only were there no complications, but the completion was incredibly easy.</p><p>Arranging so many people to enter the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone and activate the Ancient Divine Platform – wasn't it for retrieving treasure?</p><p>Xiang Yi chuckled. “Did you all think it would be that difficult?  The Merchant Alliance surely considers our cultivation levels when assigning tasks. They wouldn't send us to a dangerous place meant for Nascent Soul Patriarchs. Retreat carefully, then release the Black Jiao Talismans. The Heavenly Lightning on the Lightning Chains will naturally help us eliminate the beasts.”</p><p>“Daoist Xiang speaks wisely.”</p><p>Cultivator Liu was visibly relieved, a relaxed smile appearing on his face.</p><p>After a brief discussion, they slowly retreated. Once they had created some distance, they said "Release" in unison, then, without looking back, they rushed outwards.  After regrouping, they didn't pause, heading straight for the exit of the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p>
