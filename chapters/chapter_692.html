<h1>Chapter 684: Seeking the Jiao</h1><p>Qin Sang emerged from the cave dwelling to find five individuals gathered in the outer hall, engaged in conversation.</p><p>"Keep one person on guard outside at all times, monitoring the sea trench for any signs of demonic beasts.  No one else should venture out unless necessary.  Your judgment is sound; this location is excellent. Even if the sea trench becomes chaotic, we can detect it and escape immediately…"</p><p>Qin Sang gave detailed instructions.  Unbeknownst to the others, he also stationed a Flying Night Rakshasa outside as a sentinel.</p><p>The elderly couple exchanged a look and said thoughtfully, "Daoist Master, with all due respect, we have discussed it amongst ourselves, and believe last night's strange occurrences were likely coincidental. Even if the legendary demonic beast royalty truly exists, it would only reside deep within the sea trench, not in such a remote location. We even hunted a peak Yao Ling-stage fish demon nearby, and there have been no further incidents since."</p><p>Qin Sang's tone turned slightly grave.  "Better safe than sorry; I needn't teach you that. I paid a significant sum to hire you to find the Jiao; I don't want to lose lives for the sake of a single Jiao dragon spirit essence. Obey my commands and diligently perform your duties. Remain in the cave dwelling for a month of quiet cultivation; once we're sure everything's safe, we'll resume our search for the Jiao."</p><p>The elderly couple's expressions grew serious. They replied in unison, "We understand, Daoist Master."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, about to turn back, then remembered something and turned back, asking, "By the way, does anyone among you possess any demonic beast inner cores?"</p><p>These five individuals had hunted demonic beasts in the Demon Sea for decades and were not weak, so it wasn't strange for them to have obtained demonic beast inner cores.</p><p>Qin Sang intended to test other demonic beast inner cores to see if the Fat Silkworm was only interested in poisonous cores, or if other types would also suffice.</p><p>"Demonic beast inner cores?"</p><p>The five exchanged glances. The man in grey robes hesitated, his expression flickering.</p><p>Qin Sang saw their apprehension and said coldly, "Taking your demonic beast inner cores back would only lead you to seek someone to refine them into Demonic Beast Pills, costing a considerable sum of spirit stones to hire a capable alchemist. I can directly exchange them for top-grade magical artifacts or Demonic Beast Pills. I don't have Demonic Beast Pills on hand at the moment, but I can promise you this:  If your inner cores are the kind I need, I'll immediately have the appropriate high-quality Demonic Beast Pill exchanged for you at the trading house upon our return."</p><p>With a wave of his hand, two magical artifacts appeared in his palm.</p><p>A bone sword, seemingly forged from gold and iron, emanated a faint cold light.</p><p>A bone spear, with a slender, razor-sharp point.</p><p>These were artifacts he had crafted while researching the art of refinement to test his ideas. Each possessed considerable power.</p><p>They were far superior to those he had entrusted to the Qiong Yu Trading House.</p><p>However, just as there was an insurmountable gap between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators, so too was there a significant gulf between artifacts and magic treasures.  Qin Sang was confident that few refiners surpassed him in crafting artifacts, yet he still didn't dare to attempt forging magic treasures.</p><p>All five were connoisseurs; seeing the two weapons, their faces lit up with intense fascination.</p><p>Inner cores were precious, but these artifacts were even rarer. Obtaining one would increase their power by thirty percent, how could they not be moved?</p><p>"We've long heard that your Daoist Master's skills in artifact refinement are unparalleled on Du Yan Island; today, we've finally witnessed it for ourselves…"</p><p>The elder repeatedly praised Qin Sang.</p><p>The man in grey robes, eyes fixed on the bone sword, stepped forward, producing a jade bottle from his storage pouch. "Senior, please examine this inner core. Might I exchange it for the bone sword?"</p><p>Qin Sang took the bottle and saw a light blue inner core inside, imbued with potent water elemental energy, a common type in the Demon Sea.</p><p>"Wait a moment…"</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the cave dwelling and presented the inner core to the Fat Silkworm, discovering that it showed no interest, clinging only to the blue Jiao inner core.</p><p>"As I suspected, its talent lies in poison; only poisonous cores will do."</p><p>Qin Sang returned the inner core to the man in grey robes, clarifying that he only desired poisonous cores.</p><p>Deep disappointment etched itself on the man's face, but he didn't dare to say anything more, quietly putting away the inner core. The others also lacked poisonous cores, so Qin Sang had to desist for the time being.</p><p>Afterward, the group settled into quiet cultivation on the island.</p><p>During this period, he closely observed the Fat Silkworm.  A full month passed, and the inner core had only shrunk slightly, yet the Silkworm's cultivation had improved significantly.</p><p>Qin Sang estimated that the Fat Silkworm would need at least several years to fully absorb the inner core, after which it should be able to progress to the mid-second transformation stage.</p><p>This was far faster than his own cultivation speed back then.</p><p>Fortunately, for a month, everything in the trench remained calm, with no signs of unrest.  Qin Sang then split his forces into three groups, secretly entering the trench to search for the dragon. He and the man in grey formed the central group, while the elderly couple and the Wang sisters flanked them, maintaining a distance that allowed for quick support, as they searched the trench extensively.</p><p>The requirements for the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman were too demanding. Even though the elderly couple and others had been active in this area for many years, finding suitable dragon essence was no easy feat.  After searching the trench for over three months, they finally hunted a red dragon!  They encountered dangers along the way, but Qin Sang successfully resolved them all. The elderly couple and others grew increasingly trusting of him, realizing he wasn't a vicious fiend, and they worked for him wholeheartedly without worry.</p><p>Of course, this was also thanks to the bulging pouches at their waists.  Along the way, whenever they encountered killable beasts, Qin Sang would strike, taking only the most valuable parts, leaving the rest for the elderly couple and others. Qin Sang had the meat; they had the broth.</p><p>…</p><p>On the boundless ocean surface, two figures silently sped across the water. They only landed to rest briefly on occasional rocky islands before continuing their journey. Maintaining a slight distance from each other, they remained vigilant of their surroundings.  These were Qin Sang and the man in grey.</p><p>A month had passed since their last hunt of the red dragon, and they had resumed their long and arduous search.  While speeding across the sea, Qin Sang suddenly noticed a message talisman flying from afar. The man in grey caught it and immediately stopped.</p><p>After reading the talisman, the man in grey quickly flew over and said, "Senior, the Wang sisters just sent word. They’ve discovered traces of dragon activity on an island. The tracks are fresh, and it seems to be a sizable group."</p><p>"Let's go check it out!"</p><p>Qin Sang’s spirits lifted. The aimless search had been incredibly monotonous, and even the spectacular beauty of the妖海 (yaohai - demon sea) had lost its novelty.</p><p>An hour later, Qin Sang and the man in grey landed on an island where the Wang sisters had been waiting, immediately greeting them.</p><p>"Senior, please look. These are all dragon tracks, appearing to be only a few days old. It seems the dragon group was migrating, as we also found similar traces on several nearby islands," the Wang sisters reported.</p>
