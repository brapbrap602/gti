<h1>Chapter 715: The Two-Headed Beast</h1><p>A single realm difference makes all the meaning different.</p><p>Overjoyed, Qin Sang pondered, the most likely reason was the inherent nature of the Nine Netherworld Magic Fire.</p><p>The Nine Netherworld Magic Fire can directly impact the primordial spirit, it is naturally also effective against demonic beasts.  Coupled with the ability of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring to restrain demonic beasts, it couldn't be more suitable.</p><p>Other types of magical treasures might not produce such a significant improvement.</p><p>Qin Sang held up the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, examining it repeatedly.</p><p>Its rank hadn't changed, but its value clearly couldn't be measured by rank alone.</p><p>Truly worthy of being a secret treasure of the Yu Ling Sect!</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed again, this treasure, by a fortunate coincidence, had shone even brighter in his hands.</p><p>Some demonic beasts possess powerful bloodline powers and extensive abilities, and are no pushovers even against late-stage Golden Core cultivators. If he could subdue such a beast, Qin Sang's strength would skyrocket.</p><p>Generally, Golden Core cultivators, after many years of cultivation, can only upgrade their natal treasures to mid-grade at the late-stage.  Those who possess mid-grade treasures in the early or mid-stage are extremely rare.</p><p>Among Qin Sang's treasures, the Nine Dragon Heavenly Chariot Talisman definitely counts, and the Golden Light Armor can also be considered one.</p><p>Therefore, he already possessed four treasures comparable to mid-grade magical treasures!</p><p>Of course, imagination is wonderful.</p><p>To unleash the full power of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, the premise is to find and subdue a mid-stage Core Formation demonic beast.</p><p>Subduing a demonic beast is not easy. One must first defeat and capture it alive.  Only when the beast is extremely weakened is there a chance to seize the opportunity. During the subduing process, one must constantly resist the beast's struggle.</p><p>The stronger the demonic beast's strength and willpower, the greater the chance of failure.</p><p>As for those powerful demonic beasts, Qin Sang could only avoid them now, let alone subdue them.</p><p>Additionally, the limitations of the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring cannot be ignored.</p><p>A forcibly subdued demonic beast, controlled by the treasure, is different from one that willingly submits and follows.  It will not be inwardly submissive, and will constantly try to break free from its shackles, even potentially turning against its master.</p><p>Controlling a demonic beast through the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring is also different from the Flying Night Rakshasa Qin Sang refined himself.</p><p>The restraint comes from the treasure's own power, not Qin Sang's soul imprint. The Jade Buddha is unlikely to be of much use.</p><p>Therefore, when using a demonic beast to fight enemies, when one feels their True Qi is about to be depleted, the beast must be put away. One cannot rely on them indefinitely, lest the beast turns against its master.</p><p>The stronger the demonic beast, the more cautious one must be.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring still brought Qin Sang immense surprise.</p><p>Qin Sang, his heart surging, put away the Yang Ring, darted out of the cave, chose a direction, and disappeared into the deep blue sea.</p><p>â€¦</p><p>Time flies.</p><p>Years fly by like shuttles.</p><p>Fifteen years had passed in a flash.</p><p>It was the wee hours of the morning. The stars had not yet retreated, starlight dotted the sea, and a faint white veil had just begun to cover the distant east.</p><p>All things had not yet awakened. In this sea area, besides the sound of the gentle sea breeze and the soft lapping of waves, there were no other noises, it was exceptionally peaceful.</p><p>The place was unusually empty, no islands were visible in any direction.</p><p>Suddenly, a beam of green light raced from the west at an astonishing speed.  With a "whoosh," the green light plunged into the sea and disappeared.</p><p>The next moment, in another part of the sea, a figure the size of a steed quietly emerged from the water.</p><p>Under the starlight, its appearance could be vaguely discerned.</p><p>It was a two-headed demonic beast. Two heads grew from its shoulders, shaped like dogs and wolves, but far more ferocious.</p><p>Even more peculiar, on the forehead of each head was a vertical pupil. Its real eyes were tightly closed, only the vertical pupils were open, occasionally flashing with green light, strangely eerie.</p><p>At this moment, its dual pupils were filled with anxiety.</p><p>It had two green wings on its ribs, but upon closer inspection, the wings were not solid, but rather some kind of condensed, strange energy.</p><p>The demonic beast had a slender body.  Combined with its wings, its every move was full of beauty, but it was injured, greatly hindering its movements.</p><p>It had a bloody wound on its abdomen, seemingly bitten by some large demonic beast, pierced by sharp teeth, almost revealing its internal organs.</p><p>In addition, its front leg was limp and broken.</p><p>Because of its injuries, its wings were unsteady, its flight erratic and shaky.</p><p>The demonic beast surfaced, glanced behind it, and saw a white line in the western sea, chasing towards it, causing it great anxiety.</p><p>It licked its wound, and its two heads let out a low growl simultaneously.  Then, in a flash, it split into three, fleeing in different directions.</p><p>Shortly after, a tremendous splashing sound came from the west.  The source turned out to be a wave, parted by a huge shark.</p><p>Two figures stood on the shark's back; one was Qin Sang, the other, Feitian Yecha.</p><p>Qin Sang, arriving on the shark, stopped where the beast had split.  After a quick scan, she pointed in one direction. Feitian Yecha immediately flew off.</p><p>Then, Qin Sang patted the shark's head, pointed to another direction, and whispered, "Go after that one."</p><p>The shark's tail thrashed, creating a wave, seemingly reluctant.</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted.  With a thought, a ring-shaped image suddenly appeared on the shark's head.</p><p>The shark rolled in pain.</p><p>After the lesson, Qin Sang said coldly, "Qingjiao, if you help me capture that two-headed beast today, considering our long association, I'll grant you freedom. Otherwise, you'll be my battle pet for life!"</p><p>Over a decade ago, Qin Sang refined the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring. After subduing a demonic bird, fulfilling her long-held wish of "Riding a Crane South," she chose this Qingjiao, finding it extremely useful.</p><p>Qingjiao, a demonic beast in the early Nascent Soul stage, is proficient in water-based magic, a dominant force in the sea.  Though unwilling to submit after being captured by Qin Sang, it has performed numerous meritorious services.</p><p>The human and beast developed an unlikely bond forged through conflict.  If it weren't for this two-headed beast, Qin Sang wouldn't have planned to replace Qingjiao so soon.</p><p>Qin Sang had been making waves in the Demon Sea for over ten years, always aiming to subdue a mid-Nascent Soul stage demon, but without success.</p><p>Three days ago, she encountered this two-headed beast by chance.</p><p>The two-headed beast, resembling an ancient divine beast and thus named, is vastly different in nature.</p><p>This type of beast excels at wind-based magic; the wings on its sides are wind wings, granting it not only superb escape skills but also a shadow-splitting technique that allows for convincing deception.</p><p>This two-headed beast, at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, becomes nearly indistinguishable even from late-Nascent Soul experts after using its shadow-splitting technique.</p><p>Originally, Qin Sang wouldn't have dared to target it.  However, the two-headed beast had recently engaged in a fierce battle with another beast, sustaining significant injuries.</p><p>Qin Sang tracked it for two days, finally seizing an opportunity for a surprise attack, worsening its injuries and greatly diminishing its strength; its shadow-splitting technique and escape skills were both severely hampered.</p><p>What followed was a night-long chase.</p>
