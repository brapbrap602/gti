<h1>Chapter 2126: Nine Heavens Kui Gang Yellow Dragon Deathblow</h1><p>Heaven and earth trembled, the sound echoing through the void.</p><p>The thunder drowned out all other sounds.</p><p>On the battlefield, both friend and foe, all cultivators were shaken, instinctively looking towards the heart of the formation.</p><p>Some cultivators locked in battle slowed their attacks.</p><p>The situation was clear: one side sought to break the formation, the other to protect it. The outcome of this clash would decide the war.</p><p>The Kun Tian Golden Lock, a formidable treasure, emitted a faint golden glow as its locks clicked.  The glow calmed the chaos, an eerie stillness pervading the void.</p><p>The lightning dimmed, or rather, the golden light was stronger, obscuring the lightning.</p><p>Above, the lightning hung like silver ropes in the sky, frozen in time, neither dissipating nor renewing.  The Five Thunder Heavenly Heart Seal hung in the mid-heaven, surrounded by flickering golden light, seemingly also bound.</p><p>In the Grand Attendant's hand, the Kun Tian Golden Lock displayed astonishing power.  While less spectacular than Qin Sang's thunder techniques, its quiet strength was equally awe-inspiring.</p><p>Seeing this treasure in their possession, some in the Lu Wang army rejoiced. But this joy was short-lived.  With a deafening roar, the golden glow around the seal violently vibrated, then burst into countless cracks.</p><p>'Clang! Clang! Clang!'</p><p>The Kun Tian Golden Lock shook violently, its metallic sound ringing out.</p><p>The cracks spread at an alarming rate across the void, the world seemingly reflected in a shattered bronze mirror!</p><p>Countless fragments of golden light danced in the air.  Along with them, the joy on the faces of the Lu Wang army shattered.</p><p>The Grand Attendant's expression changed drastically. He had underestimated Qin Sang again!</p><p>Based on Lu Gan's report, Qin Sang had only escaped the Golden Lock Domain using secret techniques; he lacked the power to directly confront the Kun Tian Golden Lock.</p><p>Yet here, Qin Sang had used a single thunder technique to shatter the Golden Lock Domain!</p><p>The Grand Attendant had been anticipating a hidden attack from Xia Changshi, never expecting Qin Sang to be so well-hidden.  His response was hasty, the Kun Tian Golden Lock's power not fully unleashed.  But Qin Sang's achievement was proof enough of his strength!</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>Azure lightning descended from the heavens, piercing the void and the scattered golden fragments, unstoppable.</p><p>In the heart of the formation, Min Zhuo's face was filled with shock.  The situation had taken many unpredictable turns. When the Grand Attendant unleashed the Kun Tian Golden Lock, he'd almost believed he was saved, already considering how to feign injury.</p><p>This thunder seal was terrifying. Locked by the seal, Min Zhuo felt his blood freeze.</p><p>With his cultivation, any attempt to use treasures or divine abilities would be futile, a mere gesture against an unstoppable force. His only hope lay with Lu Gan and the Grand Attendant!</p><p>He had chosen to stay at the heart of the formation to find an escape, never imagining the enemy's strength was so overwhelming. He faced death shortly after the battle began.</p><p>To strike down a high-ranking general amidst countless enemy soldiers!</p><p>If given another chance, Min Zhuo would have carefully considered his decision.</p><p>The thunder's might was instantaneous. At the last moment, water surrounded Min Zhuo, forming a surging river that swirled around him.</p><p>The water was a vibrant blue, speckled with countless luminous points, like bioluminescent jellyfish drifting along the current.</p><p>From afar, the swirling river formed limbs, a torso, and a head, transforming into a colossal giant.</p><p>Min Zhuo struggled to save himself, but knew his survival depended on forces beyond his control.</p><p>In this moment of crisis, a Xuanhuang light enveloped Min Zhuo. A strange energy surrounded him.</p><p>The Wu Ding Eight Poles Diagram had acted!</p><p>Min Zhuo stood at the heart of the water giant. As the Xuanhuang light appeared, his form became ethereal, about to be drawn into the vortex.</p><p>Suddenly, a dragon's roar echoed from above, earth-shattering in its power.</p><p>Min Zhuo's blood surged, his mind reeling.  He saw a colossal creature appear in the sky, its shadow engulfing the earth!</p><p>Only a portion of its form was visible, resembling a yellow cloud.</p><p>The cloud took the shape of a dragon, its color a pale yellow. Its scales, claws, tail, head, and horns were lifelike.  The dragon coiled in the heavens, a glimpse of its power enough to awe the world.</p><p>From the nine heavens, the dragon lowered its head, its eyes fixed on the formation's heart, its furious gaze and roar emanating from its mouth.</p><p>A third-order Daoist thunder talisman—the Nine Heavens Kui Gang Yellow Dragon Deathblow!</p><p>In ancient times, the image of the thunder god was varied; among them, there was the legend of the yellow dragon.</p><p>Another theory identifies Huanglong as the legendary divine beast Yinglong, also known as a thunder god and rain god.</p><p>The opponents were seeking ways to subdue it, Qin Sang included. This talisman was created to break the Xuanhuang light!</p><p>"Roar!"</p><p>A dragon's roar shook the heavens.</p><p>Immense power erupted, and after the Heavenly Binding Golden Lock was activated, the battlefield fell silent once more.  Cultivators felt the legendary dragon's might, while Min Zhuo faced its full force.</p><p>The dragon's head nearly filled Min Zhuo's vision, delivering a massive shock.  Min Zhuo saw in horror that the Xuanhuang light solidified in the roar, then the swirling vortex of Xuanhuang light became turbulent.</p><p>The Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram.</p><p>Lu Gan, seated calmly on the clear pool, showed a flicker of seriousness.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>He formed a hand seal and pressed it down.</p><p>A point of yellow light emerged from the pool, manifesting a golden carp.  The carp, seemingly burdened by immense pressure, thrashed and struggled to the surface, its tail beating vigorously.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Its tail sent up a spray of water.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Xuanhuang light vortex beneath Min Zhuo churned again.  A wave of light surged upwards, attacking the Huanglong.  But it was ultimately futile. The wave shattered in the roar, and the Xuanhuang light vortex violently imploded!</p><p>Min Zhuo's figure solidified, remaining where he stood, but a terrifying power of thunder descended.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Celestial thunder struck the giant squarely on the head.</p><p>The water forming the giant instantly ceased flowing.  Lightning could be seen coursing through its body.</p><p>'Bang! Bang! Bang!'</p><p>From head to limbs, parts of the giant exploded, like a colossal spray of water bursting in the air.</p><p>Within the water curtain, only Min Zhuo remained, all the thunder and lightning surging towards him.</p><p>Min Zhuo was near despair.  He possessed a self-activating protective treasure, a jade pendant worn around his neck.  It flashed brilliantly, but quickly dimmed in the lightning.</p><p>The Lu Wang army watched helplessly as Min Zhuo was engulfed by the thunder.  The Emptiness Realm Second Stage experts, including the Grand Protector, attempted a rescue, but were too late.</p><p>Only Lu Gan, controlling the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram, could save him!</p><p>Sensing the Xuanhuang light had been broken, Lu Gan's face changed drastically.  Without hesitation, he exerted all his effort to activate the diagram.</p><p>Deep underground, the true master of the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram, Shao Shi, seemed to be in meditation. He sensed something and his eyelids flickered, but he didn't react.</p><p>Within the area covered by the Unfixed Eight Pole Diagram, eight clear pools appeared in different locations.</p><p>Some appeared on mountaintops, others in valleys, others where rivers curved…</p><p>These springs appeared out of nowhere, yet blended perfectly with their surroundings, as if they had always been there, eight spiritual eyes of the earth.</p><p>Including Lu Gan's, there were nine pools.  Upon their appearance, they emanated extraordinary fluctuations, radiating a peculiar power.</p><p>Meanwhile, above Min Zhuo, a streak of Xuanhuang light drifted down from the void. This light was deeper and more intense than before, spreading rapidly.</p><p>Then, a shadowy scroll appeared within the Xuanhuang light.  The scroll unfurled, revealing a chaotic interior, its contents indistinct.</p><p>The scroll aimed at the formation's eye and suddenly rolled, drawing Min Zhuo inside.  A Xuanhuang scroll remained where he'd been, but Min Zhuo was gone.</p><p>Before Min Zhuo disappeared, it was evident that his jade pendant shattered, that he was engulfed by lightning, and that he had vomited blood, sustaining grievous injuries, though likely not dead, having been saved by the Xuanhuang scroll.</p><p>The Xuanhuang scroll then instantly appeared thousands of feet away, transforming into a yellow light, moving with uncanny speed.  In a few blinks, it vanished, eluding even the Five Thunder Heaven Heart Seal and Huanglong.</p><p>At this time, after the Golden Lock domain was broken, the Grand Protector summoned a treasure bottle to rescue.</p><p>However, Qin Sang had stopped. He didn't even glance at the fleeing Xuanhuang scroll, but instead stared deeply into the sky. His gaze was tangible, piercing mountains and valleys, to Lu Gan on the clear pool.</p><p>From that vast distance, Lu Gan's heart leaped – surprised and irritated – and he raised his hand.  Clouds and smoke rose from the earth, obscuring Qin Sang's vision.</p><p>Qin Sang slowly lowered his gaze. Though he hadn't killed Min Zhuo in this battle, his objective was achieved. He finally knew what kind of treasure the Lu King's army relied upon!</p><p>At this moment, Qin Sang felt a slight sting in his brow. He turned to look at the edge of the battlefield, where the Grand Minister stood in mid-air, holding a jade bottle, looking coldly at him, but not launching another attack.</p><p>After a brief exchange, the two stood facing each other across a distance, while the battlefield had already descended into chaos.</p><p>With Min Zhuo's escape, and no one to hold the array's core, the formation naturally collapsed.  The Lu King's army's morale plummeted, and casualties mounted instantly.  Seeing this, a group of powerful cultivators quickly broke free from Si Lu and others, helped Li Yue out of the sword array, reorganized their ranks, left countless corpses behind, and hastily retreated from the battlefield.</p><p>…</p><p>Before the Lu King's palanquin.</p><p>Looking at the army’s shameful return, the Lu King’s expression was grave, the atmosphere oppressively heavy.</p><p>They had anticipated the enemy might be concealing their strength, but despite their preparations, the outcome was still a humiliating defeat, leaving the powerful cultivators feeling disgraced.  Li Yue, in particular, as the main general, had been trapped in the sword array the entire time, essentially useless.</p><p>"How is Clan Chief Min Zhuo's condition?"</p><p>The Lu King spoke, showing concern for Min Zhuo.</p><p>A yellow light streaked down from the sky, landing on the ground, revealing two figures: the Grand Minister and Min Zhuo.</p><p>Min Zhuo's face was pale yellow, his body bearing multiple wounds, and his neck still marked with lingering lightning patterns.  The patterns pulsed, the power of thunder still raging within him, indicating his injuries were far more severe than they appeared.</p><p>"Cough… cough…"</p><p>Upon landing, Min Zhuo stumbled, his face worsening.</p><p>"Clan Chief!"</p><p>Cries of alarm arose from the army. Several high-ranking Changyou clan masters rushed to Min Zhuo's side, trying to support him.</p><p>Resentment filled their hearts, but they dared not show it.</p><p>Min Zhuo waved them off, saying, "Thank you for your concern, Lu King. I am ashamed!  Thanks to the spiritual elixirs provided by the Grand Minister, my injuries have been stabilized. However, due to my severe weakness, the thunder poison in my body needs to be slowly extracted…"</p><p>The Lu King’s expression softened slightly. "It’s good that Clan Chief Min Zhuo is alright. We underestimated that Qin Zhenren. Fortunately, Clan Chief Min Zhuo is blessed, able to escape danger! "</p><p>"Lu King, you flatter me. Without your strategic planning and the Grand Minister's guidance, and the contribution of the Shao Shi and Lu Gan in controlling the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu, I would have been reduced to ashes. That Qin Zhenren concealed his strength so deeply.  Thinking about it now, I am terrified, further solidifying my determination to eliminate those foreign tribes!"</p><p>Min Zhuo displayed a suitably shocked and angry expression, then changed his tone.  "Unfortunately, I have suffered damage to my essence in this battle, and the elixirs can only delay the worsening of my injuries. Only the Sacred Lake offers hope for recovery. I must return to the Sacred Lake as soon as possible to heal, and I may not be able to witness the Lu King's victory personally!"</p><p>"Clan Chief Min Zhuo, are you afraid I will order a retreat?"</p><p>The Lu King laughed heartily.  "I came here with great fanfare. Even if Xia Changshi were alive, I would not retreat.  That Qin Zhenren, however strong, is only at the mid-Lianxu stage.  Just focus on your recovery."</p><p>Min Zhuo observed their reactions, seeing that the Lu King and others harbored no suspicion, and lowered his eyes.  "If that’s the case, I will await the Lu King’s good news at the Sacred Lake!"</p><p>Afterwards, Min Zhuo entered the Lu King’s palanquin with his entourage, describing the events of the battle and his deductions, and then formally took his leave.</p><p>Several Changyou clan masters escorted Min Zhuo out of the Xitu territory, continuing their flight, leaving the Wu Ding Ba Ji Tu behind. Min Zhuo was extremely cautious, circling for a long time before making sure there was no threat, and then flew towards Sheng Mu Yuan.</p><p>Looking at the tranquil blue waves and the vast blue sky, Min Zhuo let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Recalling the events, he was still terrified.</p><p>But his gamble had paid off!</p><p>He hadn't trusted the Lu King and Grand Minister's character, but believed that if they had any hidden means, they wouldn't abandon him in plain sight. Otherwise, once exposed, who would serve them?</p><p>And that Qin Zhenren…</p><p>Before, Min Zhuo lamented being a pawn, but now he felt fortunate. Without the Lu King and his people, he would have had no chance against the Stormwind Realm in vying for the Daiyu Immortal Mountain.</p><p>Now, he gambled his life, and he had won a sliver of hope!</p>
