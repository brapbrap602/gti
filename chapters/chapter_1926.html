<h1>Chapter 1917: The Seven Ranks of Talisman Arts</h1><p>The Inner Canon of the Five Thunders Emissary's Court records that spirit talismans within the Thunder Arts are divided into seven ranks.</p><p>Though not explicitly stated, Qin Sang speculated that they should correspond to the Daoist magical arts.</p><p>The Jade Pure Thunder Summoning Talisman, the Flowing Gold Fire Bell Thunder Summon, and the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart True Seal Talisman, which bear the High Divine Empyrean Arts, belong to the first, second, and third ranks, respectively.  Like the ranks of the magical arts, they roughly correspond to Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment, Golden Core and Nascent Soul, and Deity Transformation and Void Refinement.</p><p>The fourth rank of spirit talismans can only be wielded by Body Integration stage cultivators.</p><p>Whether due to damage to the Dharma Seal or intentional erasure, the treasured seal, while containing some descriptions of the power of fourth-rank spirit talismans, does not record any specific fourth-rank talismans.</p><p>As for the higher fifth, sixth, and seventh ranks of spirit talismans, there are only fragments of information, making them impossible to comprehend.</p><p>Among spirit talismans above the fourth rank, Qin Sang clearly knows of one that bears the fourth-rank art of the High Divine Empyrean Arts—the Purple Void Thunder Control Treasure Art—called the Purple Void Thunder Guide.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if he were to break through to the Body Integration stage now, he wouldn't know where to ascend to.</p><p>Of course, the third-rank spirit talismans recorded in the treasured seal, if thoroughly comprehended, are already enough to benefit Qin Sang immensely.  Fourth-rank spirit talismans are currently beyond his reach.</p><p>The Rainbow Manifestation Talisman that the young man just cast is a second-rank spirit talisman.</p><p>"Coincidence? Or is there truly a legacy of the Celestial Court here?"</p><p>Qin Sang had visited Cloud Metropolis Mountain several times and interacted with the cultivators there.  He naturally investigated but found no trace of the Celestial Court. Unexpectedly, he made an unexpected discovery while traveling down the mountain.</p><p>And it was a legacy of the Thunder Division!</p><p>In the later period of the Celestial Court, the Fighting Division was supreme, and the Thunder Division gradually declined. The Thunder Jade Palace became the protector of the Immortal Sects, and the Celestial Court's Thunder Arts became increasingly difficult to transmit outside.</p><p>For many years, there had been no news of the Celestial Court's return within Cloud Metropolis Mountain.</p><p>He didn't expect to find a trace of the Celestial Court here. Could it mean that this place might have been a former territory of the Celestial Court?</p><p>Could the Celestial Court that returned to the Great Thousand World be not far from here?</p><p>Qin Sang pondered these questions and continued to ask, "What other talismans have you learned?"</p><p>"Cloud Thunder Talisman, Celestial Step Talisman, Deep Pool Water Receiving Talisman, Great Flourishing Thunder Incantation..."</p><p>The young man rattled off a dozen or so talismans in one breath.</p><p>Qin Sang's expression gradually grew serious. Half of the talismans were recorded in the Five Thunders Court. Some, though seemingly unrelated to the Thunder Arts by name, were actually thunder talismans.</p><p>Most were first-rank, with the Great Flourishing Thunder Incantation being second-rank.</p><p>Spirit talismans of the same rank also have varying levels of power. The Great Flourishing Thunder Incantation is more complex than the Rainbow Manifestation Talisman. With the young man's cultivation, he couldn't yet create the Great Flourishing Thunder Incantation independently, otherwise, he wouldn't have fled in such a panic.</p><p>One talisman could be a coincidence, but with so many matching talismans, there must be a deep connection to the Celestial Court's Thunder Division.</p><p>Qin Sang's interest was piqued. His travels had initially been aimless, but now he had a goal.  Perhaps he could find a Thunder Division legacy outside of the Five Thunders Court.</p><p>"Ji Kingdom..."</p><p>Qin Sang asked a few more questions, a rough map forming in his mind.</p><p>The young man prostrated himself on the ground, trembling with anxiety. He opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but was suddenly swept up by a force.</p><p>Inside the Daoist temple.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu was interrogating the fox demons when he suddenly felt something and saw a streak of light shoot towards the temple gate.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>The assembled ghosts and deities shouted.</p><p>The Civil and Martial Judges stepped forward, flanking the main gate of the temple. The Immortal Binding Formation was still active, and the spectral officials retreated into the black mist as a gust of Yin wind arose.</p><p>"Stop!"</p><p>Gao Ruoxu shouted, dismissing his attendants and quickly walking to the main gate. Seeing Qin Sang and the others outside, his expression slightly tightened, and he gave a slight bow. "Daoist Qing Feng, we meet again."</p><p>As he spoke, he saw the young man, his gaze suddenly sharpening like a blade.</p><p>"This humble Daoist followed you here."</p><p>Qin Sang smiled frankly. "Fellow Daoist Gao should have found out by now that those fox demons were actually acting under orders. There's someone else behind them, and their crimes aren't deserving of death.  This person attempted to escape in secret and was caught by this humble Daoist. I'll hand him over to Fellow Daoist Gao for judgment."</p><p>Gao Ruoxu wasn't bothered about being followed. He nodded and pointed at the young man. "Civil Judge, Martial Judge, seize this thief!"</p><p>"As you command!"</p><p>The Civil and Martial Judges flashed forward, placing chains and shackles on the young man, sealing his cultivation.</p><p>The young man knew escape was impossible and didn't dare resist, his face filled with despair.</p><p>So many cultivators had died at his hands.  According to the laws of the Divine Path, even if he wasn't executed, his life would be worse than death.</p><p>"Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!"</p><p>The fox demons, seeing this scene, let out pleading cries, seemingly expressing their grievances, and repeatedly bowed to Gao Ruoxu.</p><p>"Hmph! Though you were coerced, your crimes aren't deserving of death, but absorbing the yang energy of mortals was likely not this person's directive.  Harming others for your own benefit is an unforgivable crime! Take them back, investigate their crimes, and punish them accordingly!"</p><p>Gao Ruoxu waved his hand and turned to Qin Sang, bowing deeply.  "Thank you, Daoist, for your righteous assistance in capturing this major threat!"</p><p>"This humble Daoist merely acted on impulse.  I won't disturb Fellow Daoist Gao's interrogation of the evil spirits.  I'll take my leave now."</p><p>Qin Sang bowed his hands and was about to leave.</p><p>Gao Ruoxu quickly stopped Qin Sang. "Daoist, you helped us capture this grave danger. Please allow this Gao to hold a banquet in gratitude; otherwise, it would be a breach of etiquette. Moreover, as soon as I return to the city, I will send a message to the prefecture and report your virtuous deed to the capital, requesting a reward for you, Daoist!"</p><p>He could naturally see that Qin Sang captured the young man without any effort, indicating his profound and unfathomable strength.</p><p>Presumably, the City God wouldn't mind befriending such an expert; it would only be beneficial to them.</p><p>Qin Sang considered for a moment and said, "There's no need for a banquet. Could Fellow Daoist Gao personally write a passage permit?  This humble Daoist is traveling south and should pass through the prefectural city. At that time, I will personally pay my respects to the Prefectural City God."</p><p>Some places have checkpoints set up by ghosts and deities, requiring cultivators to present passage permits for travel.</p><p>A passage permit, to some extent, can also serve as a symbol of identity and origin, more formal than the City God's token Gao Ruoxu had previously given him. Qin Sang could claim to be from Beikuo County in Liu Kingdom, better integrating himself into the local scene.</p><p>Qin Sang thought that if this place truly was a former territory of the Celestial Court, there must be more than one place with a legacy of the Thunder Arts.  Asking the deities for help in gathering clues would be easier than searching alone.</p><p>"That's no problem at all!"</p><p>Gao Ruoxu readily agreed, calling his subordinates to escort the prisoners and returning to the county city as quickly as possible.</p><p>Not long after, Gao Ruoxu personally escorted Qin Sang out of the city.  In Qin Sang's hand was a golden document, condensed with divine power, inscribed with "Liu Kingdom, Tanzhou, Fuchun Prefecture, Beikuo County," and signed and sealed with Gao Ruoxu's City God seal.</p><p>Under the moonlight, the passage permit shimmered with golden light, like a mystical treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang put away the passage permit and walked along the river at a leisurely pace, passing through several county cities without stopping.</p><p>The river gradually widened, eventually merging into a large river.</p><p>This river, named Fuchun River, surged southward.  Traveling down the river would lead to the prefectural city of Tanzhou.</p><p>The river currents were swift, with sails vying for speed.</p><p>Qin Sang arrived at the Fuchun River at nightfall, relaxed and unhurried.</p><p>At the dock where the rivers converged, numerous riverboats were moored.  They were passenger boats plying the river, ranging from large ships adorned with lanterns, as magnificent as pleasure barges, to simple sampans, swaying gently, making one worry if they would capsize.</p><p>Qin Sang led his horse onto the dock, just as a passing multi-storied ship was casting off its mooring ropes, about to depart.</p><p>The ship was decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers, and the sounds of silk and bamboo music, along with the chatter of women, drifted from the cabins.  A faint fragrance of cosmetics was carried by the river breeze to the shore.</p><p>The passengers waiting on the dock all stood aside, away from this ship.</p><p>It was no wonder, the fare must have been very expensive.</p><p>Qin Sang, not lacking in money, led his horse forward and was about to step onto the gangplank when a steward hurried out from the ship, blocking Qin Sang's path and looking him up and down.</p><p>"This Daoist, what are you...?"</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the ship, puzzled.  "What's the matter? Does your ship not carry passengers? Or is it already full?"</p><p>"We do carry passengers, and there are still cabins available, but..."</p><p>The steward's face showed difficulty, and he whispered, "This is a pleasure boat for river excursions.  Do you know what a pleasure boat is for?"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled.  "This humble Daoist has traveled the world and has seen everything.  I naturally know what a pleasure boat is. Is the steward worried that this humble Daoist will advise the guests on the boat to abandon their infatuation with fleeting beauty and become monks?"</p><p>"Oh! I can't explain it to you!"</p><p>The steward waved his hands repeatedly. "In short, this isn't a place for an otherworldly expert like you. You certainly wouldn't be interested in these women, so please don't make things difficult for this lowly one."</p><p>Looking at the man with his horse, bird, and little girl, he didn't seem like someone who would genuinely enjoy the pleasures of a pleasure boat, let alone being a Daoist priest.</p><p>At this moment, someone shouted from the bow of the ship, "Weigh anchor!"</p><p>"Quick! Quick! Board and retract the gangplank!"</p><p>The steward blocked Qin Sang, urging the dockhands to board. After the ship left the shore, he kept bowing to Qin Sang.</p><p>"I apologize!  I apologize!"</p><p>The multi-storied ship cut through the river, creating two white wakes. The sound of the water was loud, faintly mixed with the subtle melody of a zither.</p><p>On the third floor of the multi-storied ship, inside a spacious and embroidered room.</p><p>A woman in light green clothes and simple makeup was gracefully playing the zither, but her eyes were lost in thought, gazing out at the river.</p><p>Her eyes were slightly swollen; she had just been crying.</p><p>The zither melody flowed from her fingertips, the mournful sentiment growing stronger, but her expression remained unchanged, a picture of desolation.</p><p>Beside the zither lay an open letter, containing only two lines.</p><p>As the pleasure boat sailed into the middle of the river, the wind suddenly picked up, and the letter was caught by the breeze, fluttering up.</p><p>The woman's dull eyes moved slightly, mechanically following the letter as it was blown out the window and into the river.</p><p>'Bang! Bang!'</p><p>Someone was knocking repeatedly on the door.</p><p>The madam of the pleasure boat, her face full of anxiety, stood behind several strong men, but didn't dare to force the door open, afraid of upsetting the person inside.</p><p>"Qing'er! Qing'er!  You must see reason!"</p><p>"There are plenty of men in the world. With your beauty and talent, whatever kind of man you desire, mama can find for you.  Why do you...  Why pine for that heartless man? Sigh!"</p><p>...</p><p>"Should I change my attire?"</p><p>Qin Sang watched the departing multi-storied ship, then glanced at his Daoist robe, laughing softly.</p><p>The sound of the zither and the shouting reached his ears.</p><p>Qin Sang had originally intended to take Xiao Wu onto the ship, to meet that woman and hear her tale of love.</p><p>In the human world, there are always various forms of affection.</p><p>Friendship, familial love, kindness - Xiao Wu had seen them, even experienced them personally.</p><p>Just observing superficially, Xiao Wu wouldn't truly understand anything.  At the very least, she should know of their existence.</p><p>Unexpectedly, they wouldn't even let him on the boat.</p><p>"Forget it, there are countless infatuated men and resentful women in the world..."</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head and looked towards a small boat by the riverbank.</p><p>The boatman was a burly man with a full beard, lying carelessly at the bow of the boat, holding a wine gourd bigger than a human head, occasionally taking a swig, looking drowsy and half-drunk.</p><p>This boat was dilapidated, the fare must be cheap, but few dared to board it, largely due to the boatman's appearance.</p><p>The boatman's perception was surprisingly acute, immediately noticing Qin Sang's gaze. He let out a drunken burp and shouted hoarsely,</p><p>"Hey!  Daoist, want a ride?"</p><p>"To the prefectural city, chartered. How many taels of silver?"  Qin Sang led his horse over.</p><p>This boat was even smaller than Chen Ya'er's.  With Qing Ma on board, there wouldn't be much space left.</p><p>The boatman held up five fingers, then flipped his hand. "Ten taels!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head.  "Too expensive.  I'll give you eight at most."</p><p>"Deal!"</p><p>The boatman didn't even bother to stand up.  He shifted his body slightly, creating some space, gesturing for Qin Sang to board.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang actually board the boat, the people on the shore whispered amongst themselves, some casting sympathetic glances.</p><p>Once Qin Sang was on board, the boatman kicked off the dock forcefully.  The small boat shot out towards the middle of the river like an arrow loosed from a bowstring, without even tying a mooring rope.</p><p>The small boat reached the center of the river.</p><p>The boatman crossed his legs, swinging his large feet and savoring his wine, yet the boat was both fast and steady, no slower than the multi-storied ship ahead.</p><p>Qin Sang, holding Xiao Wu's hand, sat by the side of the cabin and looked towards the bow.  "I didn't expect a River God to be making a living on the river."</p><p>The boatman chuckled.  "I'm no River God.  I can barely be considered a minor water deity of this section of the river. Before the true River God, I can only kneel in worship. Those mortals are unwilling to offer good wine to the temple, so I have to earn money to buy it myself."</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. He had heard from Gao Ruoxu that the Fuchun River stretched across multiple kingdoms, and the true River God was more powerful than the City God.</p><p>The Divine Path system was also complex.</p><p>Powerful River Gods and Mountain Gods were not under the jurisdiction of the City God.</p><p>They accepted offerings of incense, using the power of faith to connect with the earth and water veins, aiding their cultivation. Some didn't even require incense.</p><p>'Splash!'</p><p>Ahead, a large splash erupted beside the multi-storied ship.  There were immediate cries of alarm from the ship, and a group of people rushed onto the deck in a panic.</p><p>"It's terrible! Lady Qing'er jumped into the river!"</p><p>...</p><p>"What are you looking at! Quickly go down and save her!"</p><p>The madam shrieked, jumping up and down on the deck.</p><p>However, everyone's faces showed difficulty.</p><p>Lady Qing'er was determined to die, choosing this section of the river, known as the Water Ghost River. Not only were the currents swift, but there were also many whirlpools beneath the surface.  Once caught in a whirlpool, even those skilled in martial arts would struggle to escape death.</p><p>Lady Qing'er was nowhere to be seen on the river surface, most likely already swept into a whirlpool.</p><p>Just then, a figure suddenly surfaced from the river.</p><p>"Ah! There!"</p><p>"She's come up!"</p><p>"No whirlpool! We can save her! Quick! Quick!"</p><p>Several strong men who could swim jumped in, struggling to rescue Lady Qing'er and bring her back onto the ship.</p><p>"Cough! Cough!"</p><p>Lady Qing'er was still conscious, coughing up some water and catching her breath.  She hugged herself, her body frail, looking dazed, but the determination to die in her eyes had lessened considerably.</p><p>...</p><p>Qin Sang observed all of this and said, "Fellow Daoist, you must have saved many lives over the years, worthy of the name Water Deity."</p><p>The boatman took a swig of wine and said casually, "Accidental falls, if I encounter them, I'll save them if I can.  Those who jump into the river themselves, if they still can't see reason after being saved once, it's their choice. What is love in this world...  Heh!  Such a trivial matter!"</p><p>Saying so, he tilted his head back, looking playfully at Xiao Wu. "Little girl, don't you go learning from her when you grow up."</p><p>Xiao Wu remained silent.</p><p>Qin Sang leaned against the gunwale, gazing at the faint moon in the sky, silent for a long time.</p>
