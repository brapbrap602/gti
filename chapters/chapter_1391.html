<h1>Chapter 1383: First Battle</h1><p>Chapter 1383: First Battle</p><p>Hunting Dawn Island.</p><p>A Nascent Soul puppet controlled a communication artifact.</p><p>During this time, Feng Shangshi occasionally sent messages, informing Qin Sang of the latest changes in the situation.  Other than that, nothing significant happened.</p><p>The demonic unrest hadn't spread here yet.</p><p>The cultivators on Hunting Dawn Island dared not disturb the puppet.</p><p>Therefore, the Nascent Soul puppet's identity remained undisclosed.</p><p>Qin Sang cultivated on another islet, oblivious to outside affairs.</p><p>The communication artifact vibrated.</p><p>This time, the content was different.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet stood up straight, leaving Hunting Dawn Island. Qin Sang, having sensed it beforehand, waited outside.</p><p>“Several demon kings are appearing in the western sea, something's amiss?”</p><p>Qin Sang, seeing the vague message, was puzzled.</p><p>“Could it be that Bi Fang isn't planning to attack humanity, but has other intentions?”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered.</p><p>The message instructed him to go meet them alone, without mobilizing defenses, lest the demons were employing a feint.</p><p>As per his agreement with Feng Shangshi, he couldn't refuse.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at the Nascent Soul puppet standing beside him, hesitated briefly, put it away, and immediately turned into a streak of lightning, heading northwest.</p><p>Lightning split the sky.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't use his full power, trying to preserve his condition.</p><p>He had made up his mind.</p><p>If he encountered demon kings and a general battle ensued, if he had a chance to face Bi Fang alone, he could hold out for a while. If attacked by multiple opponents, he wouldn't act recklessly.</p><p>Feng Shangshi sent frequent messages.</p><p>As they were about to meet, Qin Sang suddenly stopped and released the Nascent Soul puppet again.</p><p>His divine sense mark maintained a connection; he didn't worry about losing the puppet.</p><p>‘Plop!’</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet jumped into the sea, submerging itself beneath the surface, remaining motionless.</p><p>After Qin Sang left and his escaping light disappeared into the sky, the Nascent Soul puppet silently followed, trailing far behind.</p><p>Since killing demons wasn't the primary objective, Qin Sang used the same tactic, releasing the Nascent Soul puppet beforehand as a backup to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p><p>After flying for some time, Qin Sang saw waves rising in the distance ahead. A ship shaped like a shuttle was speeding across the sea.</p><p>“Daoist Mingyue, quickly board the ship!”</p><p>Feng Shangshi’s voice came.</p><p>Qin Sang observed for a moment, restrained his escaping light, and jumped onto the ship, finding Feng Shangshi and four other Nascent Soul cultivators there.</p><p>The ship barely accommodated four people, but after Qin Sang boarded, it expanded slightly.</p><p>Qin Sang landed.</p><p>The ship remained steady and its speed didn't decrease.</p><p>Qin Sang examined the ship, his eyes flashing with brilliance.  He praised, “What a treasure!”</p><p>Feng Shangshi smiled, “This Sea-Conquering Vessel of Daoist Shen is a generations-old treasure.  Its speed may not match your lightning escape technique, but it carries people, and the consumption isn't as high.  To my knowledge, in the entire String Moon Realm, there aren't any comparable treasures. I'd wager only a behemoth like the Xuan Tian Palace might possess better ones."</p><p>Island Master Shen steered the ship while humbly replying, “Daoist Feng is exaggerating. The North Sea is vast and boundless, with countless extraordinary people and treasures. My humble possessions are insignificant.”</p><p>Feng Shangshi laughed, then turned serious, “Daoist friend, quickly recover your energy. We might have a fierce battle ahead.”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the calm sea around him and frowned slightly, “This is where the decisive battle will take place? Where are the armies of both sides?”</p><p>Feng Shangshi explained, "Those demon kings are elusive, probably plotting something. I’ve ordered the nearby armies to move out. They'll arrive shortly.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and casually sat cross-legged.</p><p>While seemingly recovering his true energy, he was actually sensing the Nascent Soul puppet’s location.</p><p>Feng Shangshi and the others exchanged glances, thinking they were clever, but they didn't notice a Nascent Soul-level puppet trailing far behind.</p><p>The Sea-Conquering Vessel cut through the waves, speeding northwest.</p><p>The area ahead became increasingly desolate, with fewer and fewer islets.</p><p>The ship’s heading was taking them closer to the storm belt.</p><p>After traveling for an unknown distance.</p><p>Feng Shangshi, sitting on the Sea-Conquering Vessel, suddenly awoke, flew into the air, his expression grave as he looked north.</p><p>It was deep night.</p><p>The stars were few and faint.</p><p>Within his sight, only gentle waves lapped; the sea was unusually calm.</p><p>With the naked eye, there was nothing unusual to be seen in the north.</p><p>But Nascent Soul cultivators could clearly sense several powerful auras speeding in the north, seemingly heading in their direction.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others also noticed those auras, flying to Feng Shangshi's side, their expressions varied.</p><p>The next moment, a crimson light suddenly appeared on the horizon.</p><p>The hawk demon and the frog-fish demon then appeared.</p><p>It was clear that Bi Fang and the other demonic beasts had noticed their approach.</p><p>“The Sea-Conquering Vessel! Why has Old Man Feng arrived so quickly?”</p><p>Bi Fang turned, his gaze fixed on the rainbow rat on the back of the hawk demon, and coldly questioned.</p><p>The rainbow rat, furious, burst into a tirade, “He dared to steal the essence of my master! We must stop them, the Xuan Tian Palace traitor is ahead! Hurry!”</p><p>Bi Fang snorted, withdrew his gaze, and with a powerful beat of his wings, his speed surged, like a flash of crimson lightning.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side…</p><p>Master Feng, witnessing this, realized the worst-case scenario had unfolded; both sides had encountered each other halfway.</p><p>Fortunately, he had summoned Daoist Mingyue. Otherwise, they would likely not have been a match for Bi Fang.</p><p>“Friend Qin, I’ll leave that fiend Bi Fang to you! We’ll handle the other demon kings!”</p><p>Without further ado, Master Feng’s body flashed with green light, transforming into a wisp of green smoke and disappearing.</p><p>Madam Yue and the others also employed their various abilities, and for a moment, a dazzling array of escaping lights filled the scene, shattering the tranquility of the sea.</p><p>Qin Sang did not hesitate long before unleashing his thunder escape technique.</p><p>As he sped through the air, Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  The actions of these creatures seemed strange. Something up ahead was causing both factions to clash like ravenous tigers.</p><p>Releasing his Nascent Soul puppet beforehand had been the right decision.</p><p>Qin Sang’s mind raced; a plan formed in his heart.  With a cold snort, he didn’t openly defy Master Feng’s decision, pretending ignorance, and pursued Bi Fang directly, shouting, “Daoist friend, please wait!  A reunion with an old friend, why not stop and chat?”</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>Bi Fang recognized the thunder escape technique, and was furious.</p><p>He had long known that letting this person escape would become a major threat, and now it had come to pass, at such a crucial moment!</p><p>Even in a weakened state, the person had escaped from the three of them. His strength at his peak was unfathomable.</p><p>Old Man Feng was already difficult to deal with, and now they had this formidable ally.</p><p>Bi Fang felt a surge of unease.</p><p>‘BOOM!’</p><p>Thunder shook the heavens.</p><p>A thick bolt of lightning descended from the sky, igniting the battle, ruthlessly striking at Bi Fang.</p><p>Without a word, Qin Sang extended his fingers, directly unleashing the Lightning Control Technique.</p><p>Bi Fang was enveloped in a terrifying aura, feeling the impact of a violent force; the fleshy growth on his head felt like it was about to explode.</p><p>Having previously experienced the power of the Lightning Control Technique—the cunning fox had nearly been killed by a single bolt—Bi Fang dared not be careless. He frantically beat his wings, his figure tilting sharply, spewing blood to momentarily impede the lightning, narrowly avoiding the attack.</p>
