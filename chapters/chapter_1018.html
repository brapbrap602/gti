<h1>Chapter 1110: Nascent Soul Arrival</h1><p>“Purple Micro Palace and Seven Killing Hall… they seem to be from the same hand!”</p><p>Qin Sang paused, thoughtful.</p><p>“It seems the connection between these two places goes beyond just the transmission array. There must be a deep connection. No wonder Purple Micro Palace holds the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*, while the Heavenly Tower of Seven Killing Hall preserves a similar sword intent.  If that’s the case, could Seven Killing Hall also hide a copy of the *Yuan Shen Yang Jian Zhang*?”</p><p>Qin Sang reconsidered, figuring that even if it existed, finding it would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>Access to the inner hall of Seven Killing Hall is granted only once every few hundred years. This time is the shortest interval in history – over a hundred years.</p><p>They say the inner hall is larger and far more dangerous than the outer hall, and exploration time is always limited.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu must have entered the inner hall twice.  Judging by his notes left on the Sword Path, he didn’t find any subsequent cultivation techniques.</p><p>“At lower cultivation levels, lacking both cultivation base and backing, talent determines everything. After Nascent Soul stage, I shouldn't be as helpless as before. There are countless paths, myriad possibilities in the cultivation world! However, without the enhancement from the Killing Talisman, my cultivation path will undoubtedly be more arduous than those with superior talent. Thankfully, I possess two top-grade magic treasures, my strength is not inferior, and I can slowly find a solution.”</p><p>Qin Sang gazed towards the inner hall, his eyes flickering.  “If Seven Killing Hall and Purple Micro Palace haven’t undergone any changes, after I reach Nascent Soul, I can freely travel between the two and search the inner hall thoroughly…”</p><p>Suddenly, a sharp, piercing sound broke Qin Sang’s reverie.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to see a streak of light in the distance, heading towards the inner hall entrance, just like him. The aura was powerful—a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Qin Sang grew wary, concealed his own light, and flew discreetly.</p><p>The Nascent Soul cultivator didn’t even glance at him, quickly surpassing him.</p><p>At this time, more and more streaks of light shone among the mountains of the outer hall, mostly heading straight for the inner hall entrance. Seeing this, Qin Sang quickly increased his speed.</p><p>Flying past the Heavenly Tower, Qin Sang soon reached the edge of the immortal restriction and saw the full view of Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>The palace was dilapidated, with a corner collapsed.</p><p>The plaque was mottled, the ink peeling, with significant wear and tear, exuding an ancient aura.</p><p>Before the palace was a plaza paved with white jade, large enough to accommodate hundreds of people.</p><p>This wasn't the edge of the plaza; the abrupt break at the edge looked like it had been cut off by the immortal restriction, leaving only a portion behind.</p><p>Surprisingly, the white jade on the plaza was intact and looked new, smooth as a mirror, clearly reflecting people's shadows.</p><p>There were already dozens of people in the plaza.</p><p>Qin Sang landed at the edge of the plaza, hesitated for a moment, then stepped inside.  As soon as he entered, he felt a strange sensation, a subtle fluctuation sweeping across him.</p><p>Qin Sang was startled and immediately performed internal observation, checking his Corpse Puppet bag and the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, finding nothing unusual before stopping.</p><p>Someone noticed Qin Sang and looked over.</p><p>Qin Sang’s strength wasn't outwardly apparent; without using the Heavenly Demon Transformation, he looked like an ordinary late-stage Golden Core cultivator. Those people glanced at him twice before losing interest.</p><p>This was exactly what Qin Sang wanted.</p><p>He calmly moved to the back of the crowd, standing in a corner of the plaza, his gaze sweeping across the entire area.</p><p>As he entered the plaza, more people arrived, and the number of cultivators gradually increased.</p><p>“The top echelon of humankind has gathered here…”</p><p>Qin Sang silently marveled.</p><p>Aside from the Nascent Soul masters, every Golden Core cultivator in the plaza was formidable; those at the mid-Golden Core stage were a minority.</p><p>However, considering the vast Cang Lang Sea and the prosperity of humankind, the appearance of so many experts wasn't surprising.</p><p>“Ling Zhuzi!”</p><p>Qin Sang carefully observed, instantly spotting a familiar figure.</p><p>He noticed the cultivators' positions were strategic; he could tell who belonged to which group, standing together in lively conversation.  Those with obvious disagreements were separated by a distance.</p><p>“With Ling Zhuzi leading, those must be righteous cultivators.”</p><p>Qin Sang scanned the Nascent Soul cultivators. Some could be identified by their appearance and sect, while others wore plain Taoist robes, making identification difficult.</p><p>The righteous Golden Core disciples stood obediently behind their Nascent Soul masters, interacting with acquaintances.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't see Ning Wu Hui, she must not have arrived yet.</p><p>“On the other side of the plaza, furthest from the righteous path, must be the demonic cultivators,” Qin Sang shifted his gaze, noticing a figure standing with hands behind his back, silent and unmoving.</p><p>All the demonic Nascent Soul cultivators were positioned behind him, not daring to disturb him.</p><p>Even from the back, one could feel his extraordinary aura.</p><p>“Able to command the demons, this person must be the Demon Lord,” Qin Sang's gaze moved between Ling Zhuzi and the Demon Lord.</p><p>"I never expected Grand Masters Mozhu and Lingzhuzi to be here in person.  Seven Kills Hall truly lives up to its reputation as a human sanctuary!" Qin Sang mused.</p><p>Beyond the human and demon cultivators, there were waves upon waves of other cultivators, a motley crew whose numbers rivaled, perhaps even surpassed, those of the righteous and demonic factions. Their strength was considerable too.</p><p>It seems many forces prefer to stay out of the human-demon conflict.</p><p>As Qin Sang pondered their identities, the square filled with even more cultivators.</p><p>Two cultivators stood beside him.  One, somewhat curious, looked around, finally realizing something amiss.  "Brother Shen, why aren't there any Witch Clan cultivators in the square this time? I remember when I last came to Seven Kills Hall, there were quite a few of them, even their Grand Shaman was present."</p><p>The other, a cultivator surnamed Shen, chuckled. "They'd like to come in, but not unless they want to die! Brother Lu, you don't know. Only human cultivators are allowed in the inner hall.  Any Witch Clan cultivators or transformed demons who dare to step within are instantly detected by the square's formation.  Try to force their way in, and they're killed on the spot!"</p><p>Lu's eyes widened. He quickly scanned the square.</p><p>"Don't bother, Brother Lu," Shen said confidently. "Even if it's not an ancient immortal array, it's certainly a formation left behind by a powerful human cultivator. It's usually inconspicuous, only revealing its power when triggered. That's why Seven Kills Hall is a human sanctuary. I heard they only opened the outer hall to the Witch Clan before, to try and forge an alliance against the demons in the Demon Sea and share the burden. The inner hall is sealed by immortal restrictions; there's only this one entrance. Even if they were allowed in, the Witch Clan wouldn't dare!"</p><p>Qin Sang, having overheard this conversation, finally understood the earlier fluctuations.</p><p>The white crane, controlled by the Hun Yuan Tong Xin Ring, was considered his spirit beast.  Ya Gu and Bai, bearing his Corpse Talismans, were also considered under his command.</p><p>That was why he hadn't triggered the formation.</p><p>Qin Sang breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
