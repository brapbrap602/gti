<h1>```</h1><p>Chapter 1395 Tide-drawing Horseshoe Crab</p><p>"Could it be that someone improved the Witch Clan's inheritance, resolved the hidden dangers, and thus allowed humans to cultivate it?"</p><p>Qin Sang was surprised.</p><p>He possessed his Natal Insect Gu soon after forming his core, and now he had even cultivated the Four Transformations Skyeye Butterfly. He considered his attainments to be quite high.</p><p>But if he were to modify it, he would still be at a loss.</p><p>The Natal Insect Gu secret art was an ancient inheritance of the Witch Clan, where moving one part would affect the whole. It wasn't something that could be modified casually.</p><p>Unless the person themselves had an extremely deep understanding of this path. Otherwise, even a peerless genius would not be able to do it.</p><p>Lan Jingsi and Senior Feng were chatting and laughing.</p><p>Qin Sang silently followed behind.</p><p>Before long, a mountain peak appeared before the three of them.</p><p>Lan Jingsi gently raised her jade hand and cast a hand seal. The mountain peak suddenly twisted, revealing that it was an illusion, with a different world inside.</p><p>This place was precisely the location of Hundred Flowers Valley's mountain gate.</p><p>"Please, Fellow Daoists."</p><p>Lan Jingsi gestured with her hand.</p><p>Flying into Hundred Flowers Valley, a rich floral fragrance assaulted their senses, making them feel intoxicated.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley lived up to its name. The entire valley was covered in brocade, with flowers as splendid as tapestry. Among them were many spirit flowers, standing tall and graceful, exuding a unique floral fragrance.</p><p>Some Hundred Flowers Valley disciples walked among the flowers, occasionally startling an insect from the flower bushes.</p><p>The insects were not afraid and flew around them affectionately before diving back into the flowers.</p><p>Crystal Ants, Greenback Mantises, Triangle King Worms…</p><p>Qin Sang was bedazzled. In just a short while, he discovered more than a dozen kinds of spirit insects.</p><p>Although they weren't of the extraordinary insect level, they were all rare spirit insects that were hard to see in the outside world, each possessing innate divine powers with their own profundities.</p><p>It seemed that these spirit insects were all raised by Hundred Flowers Valley. As expected, they had some tricks up their sleeves.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley not only had a sea of flowers but also other landforms suitable for the survival of various spirit insects, and even some poisonous insects.</p><p>Instead of calling it Hundred Flowers Valley, it would be more suitable to call it Insect Valley.</p><p>The three of them finally arrived at a bamboo pavilion by a lake.</p><p>Lan Jingsi ordered her servants to serve flower tea.</p><p>The three of them chatted idly for a while. Senior Feng spoke of the recent great battle between the two races and lavished Qin Sang with praise.</p><p>Lan Jingsi seemed to believe him, and she became even more serious when facing Qin Sang.</p><p>Senior Feng praised the mellowness of the flower tea and exchanged a look with Qin Sang. He put down his teacup and asked, "I wonder where Daoist Mu is at the moment?"</p><p>Lan Jingsi did not hide anything. "Senior Brother was invited by a fellow daoist and went to the Boundless Sea."</p><p>"Boundless Sea?"</p><p>Senior Feng was slightly startled. "Your sect's founder also came from the Boundless Sea…"</p><p>"Senior Brother even told Fellow Daoist Feng about this? That's right. Although we left the Boundless Sea, there are still many old friends there. The one who invited Senior Brother is a descendant of one of the founder's old friends. It's a matter of great importance. Senior Brother cannot extricate himself before the matter is resolved."</p><p>Lan Jingsi explained solemnly, but she did not reveal the true whereabouts of Valley Master Mu.</p><p>Senior Feng did not press the matter. He looked at Qin Sang and explained his intention. "To be honest, Fellow Daoist Lan, this Feng owes Fellow Daoist Mingyue a favor and promised to introduce Fellow Daoist Mingyue to Daoist Mu, to ask Daoist Mu to give some guidance on the Way of Insect Manipulation."</p><p>Lan Jingsi seemed to have expected this and was not surprised. She turned to look at Qin Sang. "Fellow Daoist Mingyue is also proficient in Insect Manipulation?"</p><p>"I wouldn't dare claim proficiency in Hundred Flowers Valley," Qin Sang said humbly. "This poor Daoist is very interested in the Way of Insect Manipulation and has tried to cultivate a few, but the results have not been satisfactory."</p><p>Speaking of Insect Manipulation, Lan Jingsi also became very interested and began to exchange ideas with Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang had been immersed in this path for many years. Even though he hid the part related to the Witch Clan, he often spoke with exquisite words, causing Lan Jingsi to ponder at times.</p><p>Lan Jingsi reciprocated, making Qin Sang even more convinced that Hundred Flowers Valley's inheritance was not simple.</p><p>Senior Feng couldn't get a word in but listened with great interest, not finding it boring at all.</p><p>When they talked about the spirit insect that Qin Sang valued the most, Lan Jingsi couldn't wait to say, "Could you let this concubine take a look?"</p><p>Qin Sang opened his spirit beast pouch and summoned the Fire Jade Centipede.</p><p>Before investigating the details of Hundred Flowers Valley, Qin Sang could not expose the fact that he possessed a Natal Insect Gu.</p><p>The Fat Silkworm was Dumb's spirit insect.</p><p>He could only use the Fire Jade Centipede as a facade.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was about to break through to the late stage of the Third Transformation, which was already quite rare in the cultivation world.</p><p>"Fire Jade Centipede!"</p><p>A look of surprise flashed in Lan Jingsi's eyes. "It's actually this rare treasure-hunting spirit insect! Among spirit insects, the difficulty of the Fire Jade Centipede's advancement can be ranked at the top. I didn't expect to see a Three Transformations Fire Jade Centipede in this day and age! No wonder Fellow Daoist is so attentive!"</p><p>She was indeed knowledgeable in the Way of Insect Manipulation, and she revealed the details of the Fire Jade Centipede in one sentence.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lan is learned and knowledgeable. This poor Daoist admires you," Qin Sang praised with cupped fists. "I presume Fellow Daoist has seen my difficulty. This poor Daoist can only cultivate it to the late stage of the Third Transformation, but I don't know how to help it advance again."</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede was testing the waters.</p><p>Qin Sang's purpose was to probe how much Hundred Flowers Valley actually knew.</p><p>Hundred Flowers Valley had two nascent soul cultivators in the sect, and the Valley Master was also in the middle stage of the nascent soul realm and had a good relationship with Senior Feng.</p><p>It would be best if he could get what he wanted through exchange. Unless necessary, Qin Sang didn't want to use other methods.</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang continued, "I heard that Daoist Mu possesses a Four Transformations Tide-drawing Horseshoe Crab , which should be able to give some guidance to this poor Daoist."</p><p>It was not a secret among nascent soul cultivators that Valley Master Mu possessed a Four Transformations spirit insect, but Qin Sang did not expect it to be his Natal Insect Gu.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Lan Jingsi looked embarrassed. "Senior Brother only succeeded by chance, and it's related to his own cultivation method. It's difficult for outsiders to replicate. Moreover, this is Senior Brother's secret. Without Senior Brother's permission, this concubine cannot reveal it to outsiders."</p><p>Senior Feng advised Qin Sang, "You've come at a bad time. How about visiting again after Daoist Mu returns to the valley?"</p><p>Qin Sang pondered secretly. Improving the Fire Jade Centipede was not urgently needed. Anyway, Hundred Flowers Valley couldn't run away, and he could come over at any time.</p><p>It would be better to take advantage of this time to go to the Boundless Sea to find the Pure Lake and see if he could find anything related to the Witch Clan before making a decision.</p><p>Qin Sang had made up his mind and was about to speak.</p><p>Lan Jingsi suddenly said hesitantly, "If Fellow Daoist Mingyue has nothing important to do, you might as well stay in the valley for a period of time. I'll try to send a message to Senior Brother and let him decide."</p><p>Senior Feng was delighted. "It would be great if we could contact Daoist Mu!"</p><p>Qin Sang secretly scrutinized Lan Jingsi. A light flashed in his eyes. After thinking about it, he decided to change his plan and nodded. "This poor Daoist will bother you for a period of time. I'll trouble Fellow Daoist Lan."</p><p>The three of them continued to drink tea and discuss the dao.</p><p>An hour later, Senior Feng was eager to visit an old friend and got up to say goodbye. Qin Sang and Lan Jingsi tried to persuade him to stay but failed, so they saw him out of the valley.</p><p>After this, Qin Sang stayed in Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Lan Jingsi settled Qin Sang in a quiet bamboo building.</p><p>Perhaps due to Senior Feng's kind words, Hundred Flowers Valley did not have much vigilance against Qin Sang on the surface.</p><p>Qin Sang could walk around Hundred Flowers Valley and was granted permission to enter the first floor of Hundred Flowers Valley's Scripture Pavilion to view some of the books.</p><p>In the following ten days or so, Lan Jingsi did not show up. Qin Sang did not know what method she used to contact Valley Master Mu.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to take his time and didn't rush.</p><p>During this time, he gained a deeper understanding of Hundred Flowers Valley.</p><p>Even without obtaining Hundred Flowers Valley's inherited secret arts, Qin Sang could be sure that it was definitely related to the Witch Clan!</p>
