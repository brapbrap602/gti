<h1>Chapter 2185: Fusion</h1><p>The Thunder Palace existed to seal the Thunder Beast Guards.  With Qin Sang subduing the guards, the sealing array began to collapse.</p><p>‘Boom! Boom! Boom!’</p><p>Palace after palace shattered.</p><p>Everyone knew destruction was imminent, so they left the palace.  As soon as they flew out of the thundercloud, a deafening roar echoed behind them.</p><p>The thundercloud dissipated, the Thunder Palace crumbled, countless fragments swirling amidst the radiant light.</p><p>Qin Sang turned to look.  Where the Thunder Palace once stood was a giant, iridescent orb, steadily expanding, strikingly bright in the darkness, like a giant lantern hanging in the void.</p><p>Where to go now?</p><p>Everyone was somewhat lost, including the Fu Clan Chief and Fu Jiang.  They should have left the Sacred Land, but the passage hadn't opened yet.  Now, they could only follow Qin Sang. They had witnessed Qin Sang's abilities firsthand; it was impossible that he would let them go easily – they were a potential threat.</p><p>Qin Sang and Liuli needed to find Heart Lake, but they had no idea where to begin.</p><p>Various signs indicated that the Sacred Land and the Silent Space were interwoven and chaotic, without clear boundaries. Even entering from the edge of Heart Lake, they could be miles off.</p><p>Existing clues offered no way to determine the edge of this world within the Silent Space, nor the location of its deepest point. Up, down, left, and right were indistinguishable – endless darkness, utter silence.</p><p>The talisman left by the Hegou Clan ancestor might be a guide, but it was currently unresponsive. They couldn't wait indefinitely, yet were worried about choosing the wrong direction and straying further.</p><p>"If you're at a loss, perhaps we should return to the Azure Scorpion Ancient Palace and wait and see," the Fu Clan Chief suggested.</p><p>He had ulterior motives.  Many palaces on the ground remained unopened, containing treasures left by their ancestors. If they couldn't retrieve them, they would be destroyed in the radiant light.</p><p>Even if Qin Sang kept all the treasures, at least there would be a chance to acquire some in the future.</p><p>"The Azure Scorpion Ancient Palace may not survive until then…"</p><p>Qin Sang said.</p><p>It was clear that any radiant lake that appeared would quickly obliterate everything around it.</p><p>"However, it's worth a look," Qin Sang's tone shifted.  They had nowhere else to go, so they could explore some hidden realms and wait for an opportunity.  He and Liuli were newcomers, knowing little of the Sacred Land, and had no better options.</p><p>Before departing, Qin Sang dashed into the radiant light, returning to the Sacred Land, soaring to a high altitude to survey the area.</p><p>The island's protective array was destroyed, the mist gone.</p><p>Half water, half land was visible, with only faint traces and outlines visible, the radiant light omnipresent.</p><p>In the days they'd spent conquering the Thunder Palace, the Sacred Land had been utterly transformed. Qin Sang immediately saw at least five large and small radiant lakes nearby; the Sacred Land was likely riddled with these "light spots," greedily consuming everything.</p><p>They would eventually merge, swallowing the Sacred Land whole!</p><p>For countless years, the Sacred Land was deeply ingrained in the hearts of the Yi people.  Seeing its ravaged state, Qin Sang wondered what the Yi cultivators felt. He sensed the Fu Clan Chief and Fu Jiang suppressing their anxiety; most Yi cultivators were probably in disarray.</p><p>Returning to the Silent Space, they headed towards the Azure Scorpion Ancient Palace.</p><p>The journey there had been relatively calm; the return journey, however, presented several "radiant lanterns." The barriers between the two spaces were clearly riddled with holes.</p><p>Perhaps the Silent Space was far vaster than they'd imagined. They didn't encounter other cultivators and arrived safely at the Azure Scorpion Ancient Palace.</p><p>The sight before them shattered their optimism. The Fu Clan Chief and Fu Jiang sighed.</p><p>Qin Sang had been right; a radiant lake had formed here, destroying the Azure Scorpion Ancient Palace and connecting the two realms.  No wonder the poisonous mist was far denser than before.</p><p>"There might still be surviving treasures…" Fu Jiang said unwillingly.</p><p>Elixirs and medicines couldn't withstand the radiant light, but spiritual treasures might survive.</p><p>They rushed into the radiant light, searching separately, and actually found two spiritual treasures, unfortunately tailored for the Hegou Clan.</p><p>Having found something, they intended to re-enter the radiant light for a thorough search.  At that moment, Qin Sang's expression shifted; he seemed to sense something and suddenly looked up into the darkness.</p><p>The Fu Clan Chief sensed the faint fluctuation almost simultaneously with Qin Sang, then Fu Jiang and Liuli felt it faintly.</p><p>"This fluctuation… Daoist…"</p><p>The Fu Clan Chief looked at Qin Sang, hesitant, unsure.</p><p>“Heavenly might!”</p><p>Qin Sang declared, “It’s a Heavenly Tribulation.”</p><p>“Someone’s undergoing a tribulation here?”  Everyone was astonished.</p><p>At their level of cultivation, lifespan was no longer a concern.  Heavenly Tribulations were the greatest obstacle on the path to advancement; no one dared to take them lightly.</p><p>The Sacred Land contest was full of uncertainties. If a Heavenly Tribulation happened to coincide with the opening of the Sacred Land, most people would cautiously choose to forgo entry and focus on overcoming the tribulation.</p><p>Unless it was a Six-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, could someone be breaking through a realm?</p><p>At this thought, the Fu Clan Chief’s expression changed. There were no cultivators at the Void Realm in the Sacred Land; there was only one possibility – a breakthrough to the Saint Realm!</p><p>He didn't know that a Nascent Soul cultivator was standing before him at that moment.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look!”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang leaped towards the source of the disturbance.</p><p>It wasn't to interfere with the tribulation. Once a Heavenly Tribulation descended, outsiders would avoid it as much as possible; a single misstep could bring disaster. This was the first cultivator they had encountered since entering the Silent Space; perhaps they knew some secrets.</p><p>The possibility of a Saint Realm breakthrough was slim. Throughout countless years of Sacred Land trials, only a very few exceptional individuals had ever broken through to the Saint Realm within the Sacred Land itself.</p><p>Liuli and the others followed swiftly. As they flew, the sensation grew clearer, but the distance was far greater than they'd imagined.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang's expression grew more serious. Even without seeing the other person, the answer was clear. The fluctuations of a Void Refinement Heavenly Tribulation couldn’t be this immense, this far-reaching.</p><p>“The Saint Realm…”</p><p>The Fu Clan Chief muttered.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others empathized with his feelings.  The highest cultivation among the four was only Void Refinement Mid-stage; the Transformation stage was a distant dream, yet someone ahead was about to enter this realm.</p><p>“The heavenly might hasn't dissipated. It seems this person has broken through the barrier and is now undergoing the tribulation,” Qin Sang sighed.</p><p>This was the second time he had witnessed someone attempting a breakthrough to the Transformation stage, but the last person had only reached the bottleneck; they might never cross that threshold in their lifetime. This was incomparable.</p><p>As he had said before, this Sacred Land upheaval contained countless opportunities within the crisis; he wasn't the only one who benefited, and the greatest benefits wouldn't fall to an outsider like him.</p><p>Perhaps this person had obtained a great opportunity, breaking through the bottleneck and undergoing the tribulation on the spot!</p><p>Compared to the chance to break through to the Transformation stage, the mere Thunder Beast guards were insignificant.  Qin Sang's joy diminished somewhat.</p><p>They didn't stop, wanting to get closer.</p><p>“The Wind Tribulation has begun,” the Fu Clan Chief said softly.</p><p>Through the fluctuations from ahead, they could vaguely determine the type of tribulation.</p><p>Then Qin Sang intentionally slowed down. After flying a short distance, he suddenly stopped and said gravely,</p><p>“The other party has passed the Wind Tribulation; the Thunder Tribulation is about to begin!”</p><p>Everyone stopped as well, knowing they couldn’t approach further, lest they cause misunderstanding. Furthermore, if the other party successfully broke through to the Saint Realm, it was best to keep their distance.</p><p>They waited intently for the thunder to descend.</p><p>After a moment, Qin Sang felt a vast heavenly might sweeping over him, his mind stirred, a fear arising involuntarily despite the distance, as if his soul would be annihilated at any moment.</p><p>Affected by the tribulation, the void vibrated repeatedly.</p><p>Then, everyone saw faint lights in the darkness. Using their spiritual sight to the fullest extent, they could only vaguely see a golden light, golden thunder spreading there.</p><p>The tribulation of this person, was, like that of the demon race, golden thunder!</p><p>No wonder many human cultivators, when mentioning this person, grouped them with the demon race, calling them demonic and abnormal, their tone full of disdain.</p><p>Qin Sang and the others couldn't imagine the scale of a Transformation stage tribulation. The golden thunder they saw was likely only the edge of the thundercloud, the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>‘Rumble…'</p><p>The muffled thunder rolled.</p><p>Soon, they heard an unusual thunderclap. Their hearts tightened, realizing the person had begun the Thunder Tribulation.</p><p>Unfortunately, they dared not approach, unable to see the actual tribulation scene. They could only infer its progress from the thunder and the waves of fluctuation.</p><p>Even from this distance, they sensed powerful waves surging like a tsunami. They seemed to see a vision: an unparalleled expert struggling fiercely against the thunder, against Heaven and Earth!</p><p>They completely forgot the passage of time. After an unknown period, a long cry, like the call of a goose, suddenly broke through the thunder, surpassing even the sound of the tribulation.</p><p>Then Qin Sang's pupils constricted.  The thunderbolts abruptly stalled, crushed by a green ox hoof. Through the gaps in the thunder, they glimpsed a huge figure, resembling a green ox, wildly charging into the thundercloud.</p><p>“Could it be him?”</p><p>Qin Sang mused, remembering a similar shadow he'd seen during his last experience.</p><p>He shared his discovery with the Fu Clan Chief.</p><p>The tribe leader exclaimed in surprise, "The Daoist Master says it's the Heavenly Collapse power of the Zhu Huai tribe!"</p><p>"Zhu Huai?"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the records about this tribe.  The Zhu Huai were a tribe of the Heavenly Department, one of the vassal tribes of the Winged People, and uniquely, a non-winged tribe affiliated with them.</p><p>"This person is from a vassal tribe? The Zhu Huai tribe leader?"</p><p>The leader of the Fu tribe looked thoughtful, shaking his head slightly. "I'm afraid it's not the Zhu Huai leader!"</p><p>"Oh?" Qin Sang looked over. "Tribe Leader Fu seems to remember something?"</p><p>The Fu tribe leader nodded. "Daoist Master should know, our tribe's powers are best suited for warfare.  Therefore, whenever the Water and Sky Departments go to war, our experts are always present.  Even during peacetime, when both departments station troops at the border, our experts are stationed there, often clashing with the Heavenly Department. To my knowledge, the Zhu Huai leader is rather unremarkable. Even if they had gained some opportunity in recent years and reached the later stages of cultivation, it's impossible for them to break through to the Saint Realm so quickly!"</p><p>"If not the Zhu Huai leader, then who is this person?" Qin Sang was curious.  Vassal tribes, while powerful, were still inferior to the main tribes.  The emergence of a late-stage cultivator amongst a vassal tribe would make it a very powerful one.</p><p>"I recall an unconfirmed story from our Third Elder..."</p><p>The Fu tribe leader said, "The Zhu Huai tribe is affiliated with the Winged People, but among the many vassal tribes, they are unique for being born without wings, treated as outsiders.  The Third Elder said that when he was stationed at the border, a Zhu Huai expert, for unknown reasons, clashed with a Winged People commander, causing a disturbance in the camp and deserting, but didn't defect to the Water Department.  They disappeared without a trace.  At that time, the Third Elder and the others were very nervous, fearing conflict with the Heavenly Department, until the cause was discovered..."</p><p>Hearing this, everyone was astonished.</p><p>If this person was the deserter, they would be rejected by the Winged People and their own tribe.  To have wandered alone and then break through to the Saint Realm demonstrated extraordinary talent.</p><p>"Quickly retreat! The tribulation seems unable to defeat this person!"</p><p>Qin Sang observed the change in the tribulation thunder and immediately called for everyone to retreat.</p><p>After the tribulation, only the heart demon tribulation remained. The cultivator might experience illusions spanning millennia, yet it would appear as only an instant to others.</p><p>This person, having rebelled against their tribe, achieved such success and dared to attempt a breakthrough to the Saint Realm during the upheaval of the Sacred Land, their mental fortitude must be exceptionally strong; the heart demon tribulation would likely not be able to restrain them.</p><p>No one dared to linger; they silently flew back.</p><p>"Unexpectedly, the first Saint Realm expert isn't from the Merfolk or Winged People," the Fu tribe leader sighed.</p><p>"Perhaps not the first!"</p><p>Qin Sang shook his head slightly, pondering. "Once someone breaks through to the Saint Realm, might they be summoned out of the Sacred Land by other ancestors?"</p><p>If Saint Realm experts remained in the Sacred Land, who could contend with them?</p><p>"There are such rumors, but..."</p><p>The Fu tribe leader looked around.</p><p>Qin Sang understood. The Sacred Land was collapsing; the ancestors were unknown, were the old rules still relevant?</p><p>At this thought, Qin Sang's heart sank. Would they have to contend with the Saint Realm expert for opportunities?</p><p>The thunder gradually faded, the divine might dissipated. It remained unknown whether the person had survived the tribulation and entered the Saint Realm.</p><p>On their way back, they encountered a lake of shimmering light and sensed a familiar aura. Passing through the light, they saw cracks crisscrossing the sky like scars on the Sacred Land, and the passage leading out of the Sacred Land had reappeared.</p><p>"It's time for you two to leave," Qin Sang said, without trying to persuade them to stay.  He couldn't trust them, and they knew his abilities. Sending them away was the best choice.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang's resolve, the Fu tribe leader could only bow. "We shall take our leave! We hope Daoist Master will keep your promise. We await good news from you outside!"</p><p>Qin Sang bowed in return.</p><p>The Fu tribe leader and Fu Jiang exchanged a glance, soared into the air, and flew towards one of the cracks, disappearing into the depths in a blink.</p><p>Before their departure, Qin Sang directly gave the two spiritual treasures he had later obtained to the Fu tribe leader, instructing them to send some treasures to Qing Yang Zhi later.</p><p>After their departure, Qin Sang and Liuli were still unsure where the Heart Lake had fallen. They planned to search or inquire among other cultivators when the talismans finally reacted! </p>
