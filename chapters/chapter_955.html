<h1>Chapter 947: Responsibility</h1><p>Chapter 947: Responsibility</p><p>Two figures hid among the mountains, overlooking the wasteland.</p><p>“We have to cross the wasteland to leave?”</p><p>Bai, having learned about the Seven Killing Hall from Qin Sang, looked grave. “If that person is guarding the wasteland, won't we be trapped?”</p><p>“Unless he’s mad!”</p><p>Qin Sang coldly snorted, “Besides the two clans' Yuan Ying cultivators, those who entered the Seven Killing Hall include Nascent Soul stage cultivators from various factions—all top-tier experts in their realm and influential figures.  Does he dare to defy all factions and search everyone?  The Canglang Sea isn't a place where he can have absolute control. The Great Shaman and the天道宗's Master Lingzhuzi wouldn't allow it.”</p><p>By now, the wasteland had returned to calm, devoid of figures.</p><p>After leaving the Purple Mist Forbidden Ground, the two hadn't found any trace of the Yuan Ying cultivator, unsure of his whereabouts. Bai suspected he might still be waiting.</p><p>Normally, even a madman wouldn't do this—it’s too reckless.</p><p>A Yuan Ying ambush is a death sentence for Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><p>If everyone did this, even obtaining treasures would only benefit others; who would dare to enter the Seven Killing Hall to seek treasure then?</p><p>There's never been a precedent for this; the various factions must have an unspoken agreement, maybe even established rules.</p><p>Furthermore, with Master Lingzhuzi and the Great Shaman, two powerful cultivators, in the Seven Killing Hall, this person wouldn’t be able to run rampant.</p><p>But Qin Sang suddenly remembered a scene from their last visit to the Seven Killing Hall.</p><p>The Demon Lord and the Great Shaman fought over a treasure, battling from inside the Celestial Tower all the way to the Canglang Sea. Both clans' Yuan Ying cultivators were involved, nearly triggering a war between the clans.</p><p>He was caught in the crossfire and nearly died in the Celestial Tower.</p><p>If something similar happened again, the Great Shaman and Lingzhuzi would prioritize the overall situation and wouldn't have time for these trifles—making it possible for this person to succeed.</p><p>If this person believes a significant treasure exists in the Ghostland, acting wildly wouldn't be impossible.</p><p>Thinking this, Qin Sang felt a little uneasy.</p><p>“Think carefully again, Daoist friend. You really can't remember his appearance?”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed Bai.</p><p>He’d already asked Bai in the Ghostland, wanting to confirm the enemy’s identity to avoid him later, but unfortunately, Bai hadn't seen the person's face either.</p><p>Bai shook his head. “When he appeared last time, I had just seized the corpse from Daoist friend. After Daoist friend left, I was concentrating on refining my body. When I sensed the Demon Fire’s fluctuations, sealed the corpse, and went to check, the person was already gone. This time, he deliberately ambushed you, without even revealing his true form.  I was prepared and noticed the flaws in his formation. As for other times, I don't know if he came or not. Cultivators trying to forcibly enter are not uncommon; several Yuan Ying cultivators once arrived together, setting up a top-tier formation, yet they couldn't shake the Demon Ban…”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, slowly shaking his head. “Forget it, what's done is done. It's not time to leave yet; I still have something important to do.  The Seven Killing Hall might become chaotic soon; maybe we can escape then. The soul mark is removed, Daoist friend. What are your plans?”</p><p>Qin Sang had just fulfilled his promise, removing the soul mark from the corpse's primordial spirit.</p><p>The Soul-Nurturing Wood was also obtained.</p><p>Their agreement was completed; they were now even.</p><p>Bai frowned. “Daoist friend only removed the soul mark?  There's another strange power in the corpse's primordial spirit, intertwined with it, inseparable. That must also be left by you, right?”</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. “That power is called the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, crucial to this corpse refinement technique. But I only know how to create the Heavenly Corpse Talisman; I don't know how to remove it.”</p><p>Bai stared at Qin Sang, clearly disbelieving him.</p><p>Qin Sang calmly met his gaze; his words were truthful. “This corpse refinement technique is called the 'Heavenly Yin Corpse Scripture.' It's useless to me now, no need to keep it secret. If you don't believe me, see for yourself.”</p><p>He took out the Heavenly Corpse Token from his Qianjun Ring and tossed it to Bai.</p><p>After reading the contents of the Heavenly Corpse Token, Bai's face turned extremely gloomy.</p><p>Qin Sang curiously asked, “Why worry about a mere talisman, Daoist friend? Without my soul mark, the Heavenly Corpse Talisman itself isn't hard to break. With your strength, you should be able to easily erase the corpse's primordial spirit, right?”</p><p>Bai gave a wry smile. “Erasing the corpse's primordial spirit isn't difficult, but then I'd only be able to walk the path of the corpse way forever, with no chance of returning to normal.”</p><p>Pausing, Bai explained, “After merging with the corpse's body, I found that the body wasn't truly dead; there's still a trace of life inside.  If I erase the corpse's primordial spirit, the life force will also vanish, turning it into a true corpse. To restore my body to normal, I must start from the root and refine the corpse's primordial spirit first, then slowly recover… Unless I obtain some divine pill or extraordinary treasure, there's no turning back.”</p><p>"I heard that the cultivation world is in ruins, and the strongest cultivators are only at the late Yuan Ying stage. Where can I find such a heaven-defying treasure?"</p><p>Qin Sang's heart stirred at these words.</p><p>Although he had transformed himself into a living corpse, he was protected by the jade Buddha and didn't count as a true corpse cultivator, so his understanding was not as deep as Bai's.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after all this time, the Flying Night Rakshasa's body still had a remnant of life force.  This is the true meaning of the "Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual" referring to a living corpse, is it not?</p><p>If Bai finds a way to break the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, perhaps it could be used on Ya Gu.</p><p>Thinking of this, Qin Sang quickly asked, "What kind of life force are you referring to, senior? After breaking the Heavenly Corpse Talisman, is it really possible to restore her to normalcy?"</p><p>Bai looked at Qin Sang meaningfully. "The life force I speak of is different from the external vitality provided by pills; it's the original life force.  You guessed right, as long as the Heavenly Corpse Talisman is broken, there is a chance for the woman in your corpse puppet bag to recover. I never expected you to be such a devoted person, using an evil method to save someone and keeping them by your side, never abandoning them.  I have to reconsider my opinion of you…"</p><p>"You saw her?"</p><p>Qin Sang sighed softly, "It's not devotion, it's responsibility. Could you, senior, bear to watch your savior die before your eyes? If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, it would have been fine; avenging her would have been enough. But since there's a way to save her, even if the hope is extremely slim, I can't stand idly by; otherwise, my conscience wouldn't allow it."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang opened the corpse puppet bag and summoned Ya Gu.</p><p>Ya Gu looked like a sleeping beauty. Unlike the Flying Night Rakshasa, her appearance didn't resemble a corpse at all; her skin was even more rosy and tender than before her death.</p><p>"Senior, you've been a ghost cultivator for many years. Are you truly helpless against the Heavenly Corpse Talisman?"</p><p>Qin Sang stared at Ya Gu for a long time before looking up and asking.</p><p>Bai shook his head, his expression serious. "I suspect the 'Heavenly Yin Corpse Manual' may not be a necromantic secret technique, or at least not entirely so."</p>
