      The battle only lasted for fifteen minutes. The waves of iron
                slaughtered the entire swarm, and white slurry covered the
                ground, giving off an extremely stinky odor as it was vaporized
                by the high temperature.

      The team was completely unharmed. The people looked at Han Xiao,
                who was calmly smoking a cigarette, and felt very safe. They had
                been rather afraid when they left the sanctuary, as the
                wilderness of Planet Aquamarine was filled with danger, but with
                the way they looked at it now, there would not be any danger as
                long as Han Xiao was around.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Liu Zhao realized that the team of guards that he led had become
                the ones being guarded instead, and admiration toward Han Xiao
                blossomed in his heart. The strong would always be admired.

      When one’s level was too much higher than the monster killed,
                the experience received would be largely reduced. One bug only
                gave 10 Experience, but there were at least 10,000 of them. Han Xiao
                looked at the interface—he had received more than 100,000 Experience.

      The circling helicopter landed. Huang Yu had been watching from
                the helicopter earlier on, and he was overwhelmed when he saw
                the endless swarm falling like patches of wheat being cut down,
                the endless rain of bullets blooming like flowers, and the camp
                remaining completely unharmed.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Huang Yu had actually been planning to escape in the helicopter,
                and he had almost wanted to leave the others behind. Now that
                danger has been averted, his expression became quite awkward. It
                felt like the surrounding people all looked at him with disgust
                and unhappiness in their eyes.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       The Mechanic class is actually this strong…
      </em>
      Hao Tian contemplated as he held Bear Cub. He was a Pugilist,
                and now he was unavoidably worried about his future in the pro
                scene.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      On the other hand, Frenzied Sword, who had been a godly Pugilist
                player in Han Xiao’s previous life, was even gladder that he had
                chosen the Mechanic class.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       More material.
      </em>
      Bun-hit-dog’s face was
                filled with happiness. He did not have to worry about finding
                contents for his videos as long as he followed behind Black
                Phantom.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The three players who had triggered the mission to protect the
                team received a rather good amount of experience without having
                to do anything. Frenzied Sword and Bun-hit-dog were used to this
                uncommon occurrence, but it was the first time for Hao Tian.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Seeing the experience bar growing a rather large amount, Hao
                Tian had mixed feelings. The amount of earning that he had
                gotten from doing missions tirelessly was not even worth it
                compared to following Han Xiao and doing nothing.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      No wonder so many people wanted to trigger Black Phantom’s
                hidden storyline—even a godly pro player like him almost wanted
                to do the same.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">

     <p class="calibre5">
      The danger of the wilderness came from beasts, robbers, and
                radiation, but with the iron war machines protecting them, the
                numerous beast attacks that they met along the way were all
                easily resolved. It was a scary journey indeed, but there was no
                real danger.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      When they were just one day away from arriving in Graymetal
                Ruins, the convoy set up camp.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It was a night with clear skies, and if one looked up the skies,
                the entire river of stars would be reflected in one’s eyes. The
                technological environment of Planet Aquamarine was similar to
                Earth, but its nature was more beautiful.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In Star Zone 9 of the Garton Galaxy, the civilization density of
                the star zone was very low, but the planets were very
                concentrated. Many empty planets were caught by planets with
                higher density and started to orbit around them. Planet
                Aquamarine was one of the planets orbiting around a fixed star
                at a distance just nice to have the temperature suitable for
                human habitation. There are also a few natural satellites
                orbiting around Planet Aquamarine, which were ‘moons’ that
                reflects light from the fixed star to the planets at their dark
                side of self-rotation.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Before the old era, there were countries that had built a rocket
                ship to land on the natural satellites, but they were desolated.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The opportunity that made the Godoran Civilization contact
                Planet Aquamarine happened when one of Godora’s Interstellar
                Spectrometers captured the waves in space made by Planet
                Aquamarine’s primitive rocket ship.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Godora was a galactic civilization in the Garton Galaxy. The
                areas that they explored included many star zones of the Garton
                Galaxy, but they were more of a law enforcing organization,
                contacting civilizations with friendly motives.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Recently, Han Xiao had read a bit about the research that the
                nations in Planet Aquamarine had regarding astrology. The
                players could access this information through various sources as
                well, and it was incredibly detailed and real, which made the
                players feel a very strong sense of reality. With the
                perspective of an NPC, Han Xiao could see more information.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      In the camps, as Han Xiao and Coney Fury were discussing the
                blueprint, a guard came in to report.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Your Excellency, we captured a wanderer. He has been lingering
                near our camps.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It was a teen wanderer with worn out clothing. He had a double
                barrel hunting gun, which had been confiscated by the guards.
                Upon seeing the camp that was filled with armed guards, horror
                showed on his face, and he started trembling.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao had an idea and asked, “Is there a colony nearby?”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Liu Zhao looked at the map and said, “There are a few
                medium-size colonies.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao nodded and looked at the teenager with a pondering
                look. The teenager felt that the eyes of this man in black
                before him were so pressurizing that his legs started to soften.
                Before Han Xiao questioned, he explained in tremble and said,
                “I’m a wanderer from a nearby colony. I was out to hunt for food
                and coincidentally saw you guys passing by, so I wanted to take
                a closer look.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao touched his chin and contemplated for a while. Seeing
                this teenager looked undernourished and emaciated, he said, “Liu
                Zhao, get him some food.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The teenager was stunned for a moment.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “Return to your colony and tell your people that my team will be
                building a city in the Graymetal Ruins. We will provide a large
                number of paid jobs. They’re also welcome to join us. Let your
                chief know my intentions. We hope they can move in and take
                residence.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The heavy bag of food brought the teenager back to his senses.
                His face was filled with relief and surprise.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      He was a hunter of the colony. With very little prey recently,
                the people in the colony had not eaten much food and had been
                starving—this food could give them several filling meals.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The teenager had been very scared when he was captured, but now
                that he had found that these people were not evil, he was much
                more relieved and started to consider Han Xiao’s suggestion.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Most of the wanderers did not have the luxury to enjoy full
                stomachs, so the prospect of work in exchange for food was
                indeed tempting.
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      After having someone send the teenager away, Han Xiao took out
                the map and said, “Graymetal Ruins is isolated. There’s no human
                habitation within thirty miles, but there are about more than a
                dozen colonies further away, mostly small ones, totaling at
                about two thousand to three thousand people. Liu Zhao, take some
                people and food along with you, and spread the news about us
                building a sanctuary.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The original intention of a sanctuary was to protect wanderers
                in the wilderness. Thus, it was normal to attract wanderers to
                move in. Huang Yu thought that he had seen through Han Xiao’s
                plan and thought to himself,
      <em class="calibre7">
       He actually wants to hire wanderers as workers, but it’s
                  still too few.
      </em>
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao wanted to complete the basic layout of the sanctuary
                blueprint in a month, which needed at least 100,000 people.
                There were way too few wanderers for that.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Huang Yu shook his head. He felt the one-month plan would very
                most likely fail. It would not damage the organization, but it
                definitely would damage Black Phantom’s prestige and face. Being
                unable to live up to his word, other high ranked officials’
                impression of him would definitely worsen.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       I will appeal to return to the headquarters after staying for
                  a month anyway,
      </em>
      Huang Yu thought. There were no opportunities to contribute or
                gain benefits, so he did not want to waste his time being an
                assistant in Sanctuary Three.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Concerned with that arrangement, Liu Zhao said, “But if we
                spread out the guards, the defensive power of the team won’t be
                enough.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      Han Xiao pointed toward the Generation 2.5 Rangers that
                patrolled the camp with their preprogrammed routes and gave a
                faint laugh.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I’ll give you another chance to respond.”
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      “I ensure the completion of the mission.” Liu Zhao changed his
                words immediately and stood straight.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      …
     </p>
     <div class="chapter-c">
     </div>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The endless plains of Karst were maroon and looked like
                coagulated blood. Han Xiao had returned once again; it was a
                familiar view.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      <em class="calibre7">
       Come to think about it, I haven’t been back to my base for
                  quite a long time,
      </em>
      Han Xiao thought. His base had been in standby mode as he did
                not really use it.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The outline of the Graymetal Ruins appeared in sight.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      There had once been a broad road on the plains, but after years
                of no maintenance, it was now filled with weeds. The concrete
                had cracked open, and greens grew from within. Old newspapers
                flew slowly on its roads, and the long extinguished street
                lights were covered in vines.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      It was a view filled with despair.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The entrance of the Graymetal Ruins was a broad abandoned road.
                The convoy moved forward along the road, and the only sound was
                the sound of the engine and the wheels pressing on the roads.
     </p>
     <p class="calibre5">
      The huge amount of work needed to turn this abandoned city into
                a sanctuary had the people feeling greatly pressured.
