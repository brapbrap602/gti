<h1>Chapter 1425: Red Luan Curse</h1><p>At this moment, a bell tolled.</p><p>They sensed the bell’s sound and instinctively looked around, but couldn't locate its source.  They gave up and focused their attention on the golden summit.</p><p>“Perhaps it’s someone who once benefited Jing Hai Sect.”</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun dismissed the thought, ceasing her investigation into the statue’s origin.</p><p>Her gaze shifted downward.</p><p>She saw an altar in front of the Buddha statue, but the area before the stone statue was empty.</p><p>It seems faith is still more important.</p><p>The items on the altar caught her eye.</p><p>Besides the usual offerings of pure water, candles, and incense, there were three objects that clearly weren't ordinary.</p><p>In the center was a small shrine.</p><p>Only a foot high, its surface was adorned with intricate and exquisitely carved lotus patterns. Inside stood a Bodhisattva statue. The entire shrine was a dark red color, its material indistinguishable to the naked eye.</p><p>To the left of the shrine sat a lingzhi-shaped ruyi scepter, with a seated Bodhisattva atop the lingzhi.</p><p>To the right was a perfectly round orb.</p><p>The orb was about the size of an infant’s fist, its surface smooth and unmarked, pure as water.</p><p>Beneath the altar lay several skeletons, all seated in the lotus position.  There were no visible wounds on their bodies, suggesting a silent, mysterious death.</p><p>Several magical artifacts were placed beside the skeletons.</p><p>A pair of arm-length golden forks, crossed and laid side-by-side, sharp and deadly.</p><p>A round, slightly convex mirror-like artifact, resembling a protective amulet.</p><p>A powerful vajra.</p><p>A flower basket, its blossoms still vibrant and gently swaying, depicting legendary Buddhist flowers.</p><p>A small jade sword, partially visible through the fingers of one skeleton.</p><p>These were all the artifacts visible from outside the main hall on the golden summit.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun's gaze swept across these artifacts one by one.</p><p>She immediately ruled out the golden forks, jade sword, vajra, and amulet.</p><p>These were most likely offensive or defensive treasures.</p><p>With her cultivation level, she didn’t lack similar artifacts; she valued unique magical treasures with special functions.</p><p>Of the remaining four artifacts—the flower basket, the lingzhi ruyi, and the shrine—all had strong Buddhist connotations and might only be activated by Buddhist cultivators.</p><p>Only the pure orb was unique and most captivating.</p><p>Though the shrine was clearly more prominent, Yu Yi Yuanjun’s gaze was drawn to the pure orb.</p><p>Then, Yu Yi Yuanjun's brow furrowed slightly, for she noticed that Hun Mo Lao Ren was also staring intently at the orb, without any attempt to conceal it.</p><p>“He's also after the orb.  I suppose we all have similar thoughts and desires…”</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun sighed inwardly, hesitating.</p><p>Was it worth offending Hun Mo Lao Ren for an artifact of unknown function?</p><p>After weighing the options, Yu Yi Yuanjun shifted her gaze, her eyes flickering between the lingzhi ruyi and the protective amulet. If she couldn't get the orb, obtaining a defensive treasure wouldn't be bad.</p><p>“Let’s do it!”</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren’s voice was low and gravelly.</p><p>He needed Yu Yi Yuanjun’s cooperation to break the barrier and retrieve the treasures within the hall before the seal collapsed.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun nodded slightly, raising her right hand. A red light shot from her sleeve – a red ribbon, but seemingly ethereal, not entirely solid.</p><p>As the ribbon appeared, it twisted, and pale figures entangled in red mist flew out – the ghostly forms of handsome men.</p><p>These spirits were naked, faces filled with joy, seemingly immersed in some delightful experience.</p><p>“The refinement of your Red Luan Curse has reached a new level,” Hun Mo Lao Ren glanced at them, a hint of caution in his eyes.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun looked at these spirits with affection, her eyes shimmering like spring water. With a soft laugh, she gently pointed her jade finger towards the main hall on the golden summit.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The ribbon darted towards the barrier, immediately dissipating like a puff of mist.</p><p>The expressions of the men within changed drastically; they became ferocious, mindlessly attacking the barrier, gnawing at it frantically.</p><p>Hun Mo Lao Ren took a deep look, then dashed to another door, raised his black bamboo staff, and slowly pierced it into the barrier, his eyes closed.</p><p>The next moment, the golden summit hall shook violently, the barrier trembling.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the hall.</p><p>The secret passage exit was behind the stone statue.</p><p>Hidden within the passage, Qin Sang sensed the violent fluctuations from the barrier. His gaze sharpened, sensing the barrier while also vigilant of the changes behind him.</p><p>If the seal collapsed prematurely, he would have to retreat immediately.</p><p>The layout of the hall flashed in his mind.</p><p>Qin Sang's target was also the orb.</p><p>Although he lacked a suitable defensive artifact, he could rely on his thunder escape technique and the Yuan Ying puppet to handle most dangers; he wasn't in dire need of one.</p><p>Regarding the blessed vajra that Tan Hao specifically requested, it was closest to the secret passage. Qin Sang knew that Tan Hao didn't necessarily want that specific item; it was simply the easiest to obtain.</p><p>…</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>‘Rumble…’</p><p>A series of loud explosions rocked Jing Hai Sect, even overpowering the sound of the bells.</p><p>The pagoda and golden roof shook violently.</p><p>Master Zhijie forced himself to ignore the icy chill on his shoulder, focusing on breaking the seal. The three of them remained wary, poised to be the first to rush into the pagoda once it opened.</p><p>In contrast, the Hun Mo Elder and Yu Yi Yuanjun appeared far more harmonious.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuanjun held a strange hand gesture, remaining motionless. Only the Red Luan煞 and the men were busy, gradually integrating into the restriction.</p><p>The Hun Mo Elder remained as still as a pine tree, the black light emanating from his black bamboo staff already corrupting a large area of the restriction.</p><p>As time passed, the golden light of the main hall grew dimmer and the violent shaking intensified.</p><p>Just then,</p><p>The aerial spirit array suddenly cracked, and several more figures flew in, each exuding powerful energy—all Yuan Ying cultivators.</p><p>Due to the dissipation of the Chi Yan energy, the protective formation's flaws were increasing. These people entered later than Hun Mo Elder yet managed to break through so quickly.</p><p>Without pausing, they saw the condition of the golden roof and pagoda. After exchanging glances, they immediately charged towards the golden roof, even with Hun Mo Elder present.</p><p>Hun Mo Elder and Yu Yi Yuanjun completely ignored them, for the restriction was about to be broken. By the time those people arrived, they would only find an empty hall!</p><p>In the secret passage,</p><p>Qin Sang sensed the increasingly violent Chi Yan energy behind him, the seal nearing collapse. His expression was extremely grave.</p><p>He couldn't see what was happening outside, but he could tell that the golden hall's restrictive power was rapidly dissipating.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>Qin Sang shouted internally, forcefully crushing the talisman in his hand.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>In the medicinal garden, the talisman in Tan Hao's hand burst into flames.</p><p>Tan Hao's eyes narrowed sharply. He flung away the burning talisman, stepped on the step-罡, activating the array Qin Sang had given him. All the array instruments were deployed at key points of the medicinal garden's restrictions.  Simultaneously, he vigorously rubbed the Yan Yu flask.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A thick purple mist suddenly surged, reaching the sky and dyeing a patch of the void purplish-red. Within the purplish-red mist, faint shadows of spirit herbs flickered.</p><p>The sudden phenomenon instantly drew everyone's attention.</p><p>Even Hun Mo Elder and Yu Yi Yuanjun were startled by the spectacle!</p>
