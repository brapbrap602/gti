<h1>Chapter 890: True Disciple</h1><p>The Incarnation visited the Daoist boy hoping to cultivate a close relationship, intending to use him later. Unexpectedly, the boy offered him the position of true disciple.</p><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>The Daoist boy first sent a sound transmission to Jade Finger Peak, then gestured with his sleeve and led the Incarnation directly towards the mountaintop.</p><p>The Incarnation was cautious, carefully concealing his aura.  Even in decline, the sect surely had many Foundation Establishment stage masters.</p><p>Soon, they arrived at a wooden tower on Yin-Yang Peak.</p><p>This tower was unusual, built in mid-air between the two peaks, supported only by a narrow stone bridge—a precarious location.</p><p>The Daoist boy pushed open the door. The interior was empty, except for a towering statue of a slender Daoist.</p><p>The statue, carved from some kind of spiritual wood and enhanced with enchantments, possessed a profound gaze and distinguished aura. Despite its age, its surface remained pristine.</p><p>“This is the ancestor of our Yin-Yang lineage, Yin-Yang Daoist.”</p><p>The Daoist boy, with the Incarnation behind him, lit a stick of incense and paid respectful homage.</p><p>“Disciple greets the ancestor!”</p><p>The Incarnation, feeling a sudden chill, knelt.</p><p>Yin-Yang Daoist had been a renowned Nascent Soul cultivator in the Canglang Sea, the founder of the Yin-Yang lineage of the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>“My master is currently away, but he instructed me to handle this. Take the heart demon oath, and I will transmit the first layer of the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique* to you. We will report to him upon his return…”</p><p>Only the first layer? Disappointment flickered in the Incarnation’s heart.  He obediently swore an oath.</p><p>The Daoist boy sent a stream of light into the Incarnation’s forehead.</p><p>The Incarnation trembled slightly.  A section of scripture appeared in his mind, exactly as the Daoist boy promised: only the first layer of the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique*, suitable for the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p>“Do not underestimate this foundational layer. It contains the essence of the entire technique. The ancestor used this method to comprehend the true meaning of Yin-Yang Daoism, achieving great renown in the Canglang Sea…”</p><p>The Daoist boy’s expression turned serious as he recounted the ancestor’s deeds.</p><p>The Incarnation thought his judgment had been sound. The *Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique* scroll was only the first layer; the subsequent techniques were all created by Yin-Yang Daoist himself.</p><p>This shocked the Incarnation.</p><p>Senior Qingzhu, a supremely gifted individual, had created his killing talismans. This was because he had cultivated the five layers of the *Spirit-Nourishing Sword Chapter*, reaching the Foundation Establishment stage before doing so.</p><p>With only the first layer of the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique* in existence, it was considered extremely incomplete.  Had Yin-Yang Daoist begun creating his own techniques from the Qi Condensation stage?</p><p>“Yin-Yang Daoist probably attained a certain level of cultivation through Yin-Yang Daoism before discovering the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique* and creating the subsequent techniques. It's impossible for anyone to be so unbelievably talented. Even so, he was incredibly powerful, and certainly had talent comparable to Senior Qingzhu.”</p><p>The Incarnation memorized the technique while listening to the Daoist boy's explanations.</p><p>“Afterward, find Senior Brother Lu to replace your jade tablet.  Once Master returns, I'll make further arrangements.  From now on, you will cultivate the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Duel Secret Technique*.  Strive to cultivate the first strand of Yin-Yang Qi in your dantian.  The Dongming Island Martial Arts Conference begins in two months—you can participate in that for some experience…”</p><p>The Daoist boy continued.</p><p>“Uncle Yang, what’s the Dongming Island Martial Arts Conference?” the Incarnation asked curiously.</p><p>The Daoist boy glanced at him. “I forgot. It doesn't concern outer disciples; it’s normal that you haven't heard of it. It's a competition between true disciples from Lan Dou Island and nearby sects. It's held on Dongming Island, hence the name.  Dongming Island is a secret island, only accessible during the conference.”</p><p>The Incarnation exclaimed, “True disciples from various sects are all Foundation Establishment cultivators like Uncle Yang. If I participate, I’ll surely be at the bottom!”</p><p>“Are you aiming for first place?”</p><p>The Daoist boy sneered. “Smaller sects have less strict requirements for their true disciples, so Qi Condensation disciples do participate. You don't need to worry about your ranking; just perform to your best ability as a form of training. The conference rewards are excellent and will benefit your future cultivation.  This rare opportunity is why I've expedited your ascension to true disciple.”</p><p>“Disciple understands. I will cultivate diligently.”</p><p>While saying this, the Incarnation had little interest in the conference.</p><p>He hadn't even participated in the Great Competition of the Eight Orthodox Sects in the Little Cold Region, and now he was even less inclined. Any reward at the conference wouldn't tempt him.</p><p>He couldn't refuse the Daoist boy's request, so he planned to just go through the motions.</p><p>However, the mention of Dongming Island, a secret island, piqued his interest. He wondered if there was any connection to Douniu Peak.</p><p>Secret lands, forbidden grounds…</p><p>On second thought, the Incarnation decided it was unlikely.</p><p>Dongming Island isn't solely controlled by Lan Doumen.  With the Dharma Assembly taking place, numerous sects gather near Lan Doumen.  It's unlikely a true successor's lineage would be established in such a location.</p><p>Following a lengthy and complex process, a full hour later, the avatar finally flew from Yin-Yang Peak back to Jade Finger Peak to exchange the jade register.</p><p>“Becoming a true successor disciple this quickly was faster than expected. The avatar can't possibly cultivate the *Yin-Yang Heavenly Battle Secret Technique*. Even if I use the original body to create a disguise, it would be impossible to hide from a Foundation Establishment cultivator like Hua Yang Lao Dao, who is proficient in this technique.  It’s only a matter of time before the deception is revealed. I can only pretend to be inept, unable to cultivate Yin-Yang Qi, buy time, and quickly gather information...”</p><p>As a true successor disciple, the avatar's actions are significantly easier. Areas restricted to outer disciples are now freely accessible.</p><p>He didn't rush to leave Jin Yan's stone hall.  Using his dual identity, he successfully infiltrated several secretive areas, secretly deploying the Heaven's Eye Butterfly to spy, while simultaneously investigating various leads.</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Dongming Island Dharma Assembly is fast approaching.</p><p>The attendant is increasingly attentive, but the avatar’s persistent failure to cultivate Yin-Yang Qi leaves the attendant frustrated, even questioning his judgment.</p><p>After another harsh reprimand, the avatar returned to his cave dwelling and found two figures standing before it; one of them was Fang Ting.</p><p>Fang Ting had been visiting frequently. Her background within Lan Doumen isn't a secret; the attendant even warned the avatar not to slight her because of their past encounter.</p><p>Since it didn't interfere with his main objectives, and Fang Ting's identity might prove useful, the avatar patiently dealt with her.</p><p>Unexpectedly, a month ago, Fang Ting brought another person – Zhao Songqiao, who had participated in the Yan Miao Pavilion's disciple recruitment ceremony with them.</p><p>"Brother Zhang!"</p><p>Fang Ting waved happily upon seeing him.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao, his face beaming, bowed and said, "My brother yearned for a taste of Brother Zhang's spiritual tea, and so I came to bother you again."</p>
