<h1>Chapter 2069: The Sacred Image</h1><p>The bottomless Demon Pit is now surrounded by mountains, artificially created by the Storm Realm cultivators using powerful formations to pile earth and stone.  They diverted nearby spirit veins, creating a place that is sheltered from the wind and rain, rich in spiritual energy, and strikingly beautiful.</p><p>This place is now the most important location for the Storm Realm cultivators.  Not only is it protected by a massive guardian spirit formation, but countless guards are also stationed here.</p><p>Safe, rich in spiritual energy, and a crucial transportation hub between two regions, it naturally developed into a celestial city.  As more cultivators stayed, the city expanded, becoming one of the most prosperous places in the entire Northern Sea Four Regions.</p><p>Shen Chen emerged from the teleportation hall, clouds forming beneath his feet. The guard captain, recognizing him, bowed respectfully, "Lord Shen, have a safe journey!"</p><p>The other guards showed equal deference.</p><p>Shen Chen nodded with an air of mastery, rising into the air and quickly shrinking to a tiny speck on the horizon.</p><p>An excited guard said, "Lord Shen's arrival in the Northern Sea... did he refine another powerful artifact and bring it here personally?"</p><p>"Possible," another guard sighed, "I hear those monkeys are restless again, frequently encroaching on our borders. I hope this doesn't lead to major chaos. It's our turn to patrol the seas next month."</p><p>The guards' expressions darkened.</p><p>Guarding the teleportation array is a coveted position, fiercely competed for, especially by disciples of major sects.</p><p>With external enemies threatening, no one in the Storm Realm is exempt from contributing. Disciples of large sects, with their masters' support, tend to secure less dangerous assignments.</p><p>To ensure fairness, rotational assignments are the norm.</p><p>"What's the point of worrying?  If we go to war, can we run away? Killing a couple of monkeys is enough to earn our keep!"</p><p>The guard captain shouted, silencing the guards.</p><p>Unaware of the guards' discussion, Shen Chen was planning which spiritual materials he would collect from the various sects.</p><p>He didn't need to do this personally, but since he was visiting Xuan Tian Palace, he decided to come himself.</p><p>He moved unimpeded through the city, quickly flying to its outskirts. He saw numerous settlements dotting the land, with the shimmering glow of protective formations in the forests.</p><p>Since the city's rise, many independent cultivators and smaller sects had relocated here, bringing their affiliated families and even commoners, settling the wasteland and creating the current vibrant scene.</p><p>Shen Chen, having lived through the old days, remembered what the Storm Realm used to look like.  Seeing the current scene, he sighed, "It would be perfect without the Changyou tribe..."</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Shen Chen saw two figures appear out of thin air in the distance.</p><p>"Who's there!"</p><p>Shen Chen was startled.  Even at his Metamorphosis Initial stage, he hadn't sensed their presence beforehand.</p><p>No, three people!</p><p>One of them had a small figure perched on their shoulder, tilting its head to look at him.</p><p>Over the years of fighting the Changyou tribe, the Storm Realm had been confined to this area, but they weren't entirely unaware of the outside world.</p><p>It was rumored that the Yi Ren tribe had all sorts of strange clans.  Could these be allies invited by the Changyou tribe, specifically to ambush him?</p><p>But his trip was unplanned. How did they know he would be here? Was there a traitor in the alliance or Luye, leaking his movements?</p><p>Shen Chen's imagination was quite vivid; countless thoughts flashed through his mind instantly.  His reaction was swift; he activated his spirit armor and retreated.</p><p>The next moment, Shen Chen froze. He saw someone even more unexpected.</p><p>Gazing at the familiar face, Shen Chen's eyes widened.</p><p>"What?  After a few hundred years, you don't recognize your master?" Qin Sang smiled faintly, his hands behind his back as he looked at his disciple.</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Shen Chen trembled, the words escaping him.</p><p>If he had previously suspected someone was impersonating him, now he was absolutely certain: it was his master!</p><p>His master wasn't dead!  He had returned!</p><p>"Master!"</p><p>Shen Chen called out again, suppressing his excitement, flying closer to Qin Sang, and bowing deeply in the clouds, "Disciple greets Master!"</p><p>Seeing his disciple, Qin Sang's heart stirred.</p><p>For him, the Storm Realm was a home away from home.  Returning here, he felt an unprecedented sense of peace.</p><p>Since his ascension to the Fuyao Realm, he had felt like a drifting water weed. Perhaps this feeling was what made him reluctant to establish a daoist sect or stay in Yue Du Bay.</p><p>Returning here, I feel I’ve found my roots. In this vast world, I finally have my place.  Many old friends may have passed, but some I can still meet again.</p><p>Those increasingly distant memories now have a foundation, no longer vague and ethereal, but brought sharply into focus, their colors vibrant once more.</p><p>I recall, when I first took this disciple, I didn't place much importance on it.  But afterwards, he fulfilled his duties as a disciple.</p><p>When he left, Shen Chen had already reached the Yuan Ying stage, and now he’s at the early stage of Hua Shen.</p><p>“Rise.”</p><p>A beam of light lifted Shen Chen.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at his steadier disciple and nodded.  “Good.”</p><p>Shen Chen didn't know Qin Sang's cultivation level, but the moment he confirmed his master's return, inexplicably, all his pressure and burdens lifted, as if he’d returned to his carefree days at Luye.</p><p>Receiving his master's praise, Shen Chen showed no complacency.  “Disciple was distracted by artifact refinement, neglecting cultivation. Please, Master, punish me.”</p><p>Qin Sang asked, “Those guards call you Alliance Leader?”</p><p>“Yes!  Due to the perennial war with the Changyou tribe, to counter the external enemy, various artifact refinement masters gathered together, forming an alliance called Tiangong, to jointly refine the magical weapons and treasures needed on the battlefield.”</p><p>Here, Shen Chen said with some shame, “The position of Alliance Leader should have gone to Qiongying Sect, but the Qiongying Sect Master claimed the sect had too much to handle, so they pushed me forward.”</p><p>Seeing his expression, Qin Sang pretended to be displeased.  “The various sects jointly nominated you as the Tiangong Alliance Leader, showing your ability to win them over.  Since you are my disciple, you should have the courage to take on this responsibility without hesitation!”</p><p>He knew his disciple’s talent.  On the way, he had already anticipated that if Shen Chen could pass the Hua Shen stage, he would inherit his path of artifact refinement.</p><p>Shen Chen took a deep breath, his heart free of hesitation. “Disciple will follow Master's teachings!”</p><p>Next, they discussed Shen Chen's plans. Learning he was going to Xuantian Palace, Qin Sang asked, “Where is Liuli now?”</p><p>“Reporting to Master, Fairy Liuli is currently in seclusion at Xuantian Palace.”</p><p>Shen Chen couldn't help but steal a glance at Qin Sang.</p><p>For years, rumors of Master and Fairy Liuli had been rampant. As Qin Sang's disciple, he knew some were not mere rumors, and pieced together the story of his master and Fairy Liuli's relationship.</p><p>He always considered Fairy Liuli his master's wife.</p><p>Shen Chen had witnessed Fairy Liuli's lonely figure standing before his master's statue, and couldn't help but feel happy for her. “Knowing Master has returned, Fairy Liuli must be overjoyed!”</p><p>Learning Liuli was safe, Qin Sang was naturally pleased. “How long has Liuli been in seclusion?”</p><p>Shen Chen thought for a moment. “It should be several decades.  It is said that Fairy Liuli is trying to break through a certain barrier.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded. Liuli was in a critical stage of her breakthrough, and it was inappropriate to disturb her.  Since he had returned, he could see her anytime after her seclusion, there was no need to rush.</p><p>“You said the Jade Axe brought you here?”</p><p>Shen Chen nodded. “On my way here, I went back to the mountain gate, and Senior Brother used Luye to send me here.  He should not have gone far.”</p><p>After the discovery of this teleportation array, communication between Central Plains and the North Sea was restored, allowing the two Qingyang Sects to reconnect.</p><p>Shen Chen remembered Qin Sang's teachings when he established the sect.  He wasn’t interested in power, and developing the sect wasn't his forte. He willingly merged the Central Plains Qingyang Sect into the North Sea Qingyang Sect, with Li Yu Fu as the Sect Master.</p><p>Later, for convenience, at Liuli's suggestion, they decided to make Luye the main Qingyang Sect, moving valuable items there, with Li Yu Fu residing there permanently.</p><p>Of course, the North Sea Qingyang Sect was not abandoned; many disciples still practiced there.</p><p>“Let’s go to Luye first,” Qin Sang said.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Shen Chen took the lead.</p><p>“Don't reveal our identities,” Qin Sang channeled his true energy, altering his appearance, turning to Silu and Ji Hong. “Please disguise yourselves as well.”</p><p>Silu nodded, a wisp of grayish-white energy emanating from his brow, circling his body before dissipating, changing his appearance.</p><p>He transformed into a human female cultivator, while Ji Hong became a small monkey, appearing as Silu's spirit beast.</p><p>Ji Hong looked at himself, not feeling offended but rather curious, pulling out a bright yellow fruit, squatting on Silu's shoulder and happily munching.</p><p>Shen Chen twitched his eye.  Since the feud with the Changyou tribe, the monkey spirits of the Storm World had also been affected, becoming unpopular.</p><p>“Alliance Leader Shen, you’re back?”</p><p>The guard captain was surprised to see Shen Chen return so quickly.  He glanced behind Shen Chen, noticing two unfamiliar cultivators.  However, given Shen Chen's status, a search was unnecessary.</p><p>Shen Chen nodded, producing spirit stones.  “Activate the Grand Teleportation Array. We’re returning to Central State.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The guard captain, without hesitation, immediately obeyed.</p><p>“Personally escorted by Alliance Leader Shen…are these two accomplished artifact refiners joining the Heavenly Crafts Alliance?”</p><p>The guard captain secretly speculated, feeling a surge of envy.</p><p>The teleportation array was located at the bottom of the Demon Cave. The cave, now devoid of any sinister aura, had been transformed into a vast space, its walls adorned with luminous pearls, brightly lit.</p><p>As they stepped onto the array, a flash of light, and they arrived in Central State.</p><p>Across from them lay a bustling immortal city. Qin Sang’s mind stirred, sensing a colossal presence on the horizon – Lu Ye!</p><p>“After the storm subsided, Central State and the Western Lands became connected, creating a vast expanse of land, now collectively known as Central State.  Nourished by the abundant spiritual energy, the once barren, lava-filled region is now dotted with countless cultivation sites. Some fortunate cultivators even discovered ancient ruins here, reaping significant rewards.</p><p>“The Canglang Sea and the Demon Sea were breached by the Changyou tribe, forcing many cultivators to relocate here. Of course, many sects and independent cultivators found better cultivation sites and established their own schools.</p><p>“Now we only have the North Sea and this continent left. Most races have gathered in these two places. However, Central State is vast and its spiritual energy is abundant; there's no feeling of overcrowding.”</p><p>Shen Chen, walking beside Qin Sang, recounted the changes of these years.</p><p>As they spoke, they reached Lu Ye.</p><p>Now, Lu Ye could freely roam across Central State, previously constrained by the storm.  It no longer remained hidden, appearing periodically for the world to see. This served a dual purpose: allowing the people to venerate Qin Sang's image and bolstering morale.</p><p>Qin Sang saw that Lu Ye’s main body remained massive, but layers of halls and pavilions had been constructed along its edges, accommodating more cultivators.  The protective array had also been modified, increasing its power.</p><p>Naturally, the spiritual energy here was far denser.  The interior of Lu Ye had undergone significant changes, but the area around his original cave remained untouched, designated as a restricted zone.</p><p>His gaze swept across the landscape, finally settling on the entrance.</p><p>The canyon had been widened, the 'Lu Ye' stele moved aside, and a large jade statue now stood in the plaza.</p><p>Shen Chen activated a talisman, and they passed through the array, entering Lu Ye.</p><p>Qin Sang stood before the statue, looking up at the likeness of himself.</p><p>The statue, carved from a single piece of spirit jade, faced outward, its head slightly bowed, gazing upon the world with a compassionate yet slightly worried expression, resolute in its determination to find a way forward for all beings.  The statue’s outstretched right hand dripped a single drop of nectar, its lower body engulfed in flames, symbolizing its willingness to sacrifice itself for the hope of humanity.</p><p>This jade statue was incredibly lifelike and evocative.</p><p>Qin Sang had no idea when he had acquired such a compassionate demeanor. But upon meeting the statue’s gaze, Qin Sang was profoundly shaken.</p><p>At that moment, he experienced a strange sensation, as if countless images flashed before his eyes.</p><p>He saw people devoutly praying before the statue, thanking the saint for protecting them.</p><p>Some offered tributes, pleading for their wishes to be granted.</p><p>Others made vows, inspired by the saint's example.</p><p>Some cursed him, blaming him for the Changyou tribe's attack.</p><p>Others were simply sightseeing, some indifferent, some gossiping about his romantic affairs with great interest...</p><p>And one person stood alone, gazing at the statue for a long time, their figure utterly solitary.</p><p>…</p><p>These figures were blurry and unidentifiable, quickly dissolving like illusions.</p><p>Countless hazy fragments surged forth, yet Qin Sang knew this was no illusion—it was likely a reflection of reality.  Those who had worshipped the statue had left behind traces of their spiritual energy, entwined with the statue over time, forming this power that had resided within it and was now returning to its source.</p><p>Qin Sang closed his eyes.</p><p>Si Lu and Ji Hong were surprised to see Qin Sang's aura shift.</p><p>After leaving Fengju Jade Gate, Qin Sang hadn't attempted to break through to the mid-Nascent Soul stage because his cultivation was derived from the Witch Clan's incantation, requiring time to solidify.</p><p>There was another crucial reason: he sensed an invisible barrier in his cultivation, a potential obstacle to his advancement.</p><p>In that moment, the barrier dissolved!</p>
