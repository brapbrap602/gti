<h1>Chapter 774: Failure</h1><p>This person approached the Demonic Flame, activating a secret technique to examine it closely.</p><p>Although the other party had been cautious, erasing their tracks upon leaving, they couldn't deceive his eyes. He found clues.</p><p>"I tried every method to probe it before, nearly burning to death by the Demonic Flame. Even a late Nascent Soul elder could only sigh in despair. Who could it be? Of the two late Nascent Soul experts who entered the Seven Slaughter Palace this time, the Demon Lord and the Great Shaman entered the Celestial Tower together and their whereabouts are unknown. The other old demons' cultivation is at most comparable to mine. Unless they possess an ancient secret treasure or cultivate some special demonic art... The Demonic Flame has an extraordinary origin, not naturally formed, but a divine ability of an ancient demon. Cultivating a similar ancient demonic art might indeed be possible. I know the backgrounds of these old geezers clearly, could there be something I've overlooked…?"</p><p>The blackness in his eyes receded, returning to normal, as he paced back and forth, speculating on the other party's identity.</p><p>"Could the Demonic Flame have mutated, its power weakened?"</p><p>He was filled with uncertainty, then suddenly flashed closer to the Demonic Flame.</p><p>Entering the range of the Demonic Flame's power, a layer of blue flames abruptly appeared on this person's body. The flames were thin but extremely resilient, like a protective shield.</p><p>Under the protection of the blue flames, this person stepped forward, approaching the main body of the Demonic Flame step by step.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as he entered the Demonic Flame's range, his eyes suddenly dimmed, becoming vacant. Then a bewildered expression appeared on his face, as if he were about to lose consciousness.</p><p>At this moment, this person bit his tongue hard. The sharp pain jolted him awake, and his figure immediately retreated, fleeing in panic.</p><p>He distanced himself from the Demonic Flame, gasping for breath, still lingering in fear.</p><p>The Demonic Flame's power hadn't changed.  Before its origin power even erupted, he almost succumbed. The strangeness and terror of ancient demonic cultivation methods were difficult for later generations to fathom.</p><p>Even with his high cultivation, he couldn't resist it. How did that mysterious person manage it?</p><p>He shook his head, staring at the main body of the Demonic Flame. "Forget it, let's try to tame the Demonic Flame first! Even if the treasures inside have been taken by someone else, as long as I can subdue the Demonic Flame, my dominance over the Boundless Sea is just around the corner. Perhaps there's even a chance to breakthrough to Deity Transformation. What treasures couldn't I obtain then?"</p><p>This person made up his mind and sat down cross-legged, keeping a distance from the Nine Yin Demonic Flame.</p><p>A blue light flickered at the center of his brow, then a small blue flame flew out from his brow, floating in front of him.</p><p>This blue flame was crystal clear, suspended in the void, gently swaying, extremely beautiful.</p><p>Maintaining the blue flame seemed to be quite strenuous; his face flushed red, and beads of sweat dripped from his temples.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>He whispered, his divine sense surging.</p><p>The blue flame flickered slightly, then drifted towards the main body of the Demonic Flame.</p><p>He opened his eyes, watching the blue flame with anticipation. Seeing it successfully cross the distance and float towards the Demonic Flame's main body, unaffected and not dispersed by the Demonic Flame's aura, he was immediately overjoyed.</p><p>The blue flame hovered before the Demonic Flame's main body, its fluctuations more pronounced than before.</p><p>Seeing this, this person knew that if too much time passed, the blue flame wouldn't be able to withstand the Demonic Flame's pressure. He immediately started circulating his cultivation technique, attempting to subdue the Demonic Flame.</p><p>He continuously changed hand seals. Following this, a tremendous suction force emerged from within the blue flame, targeting the Demonic Flame, attempting to draw out a wisp of it for the blue flame to devour.</p><p>The technique worked. The Demonic Flame wasn't enraged, and a small flame seemed to be separating from its main body, about to be drawn in by the blue flame.</p><p>A look of joy just appeared on this person's face.</p><p>At this moment, a sudden change occurred.</p><p>As the Demonic Flame approached, the blue flame shook violently, the flames shrinking, as if in fear and evasion.</p><p>This person was greatly alarmed and hurriedly urged his divine sense with all his might to maintain the blue flame. Unexpectedly, the blue flame suddenly exploded without warning.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>Like fireworks blooming, the blue flame completely shattered.</p><p>Flame fragments dissipated into the void, a magnificent sight.</p><p>The wisp of Demonic Flame immediately returned to its main body, the Demonic Flame remaining as before.</p><p>A shrill scream rang out simultaneously.</p><p>The instant the blue flame exploded, this person shrieked, falling to the ground. Clutching his head tightly, his body curled up into a ball, trembling uncontrollably, enduring immense pain.</p><p>After a while, he tremblingly sat up, his hair dishevelled, eyes bloodshot, blood flowing from his seven orifices.</p><p>Covered in dust, he looked extremely dishevelled.</p><p>Ignoring this, he hurriedly entered meditative cultivation. After a long while, his breathing stabilized, and he slowly opened his eyes.</p><p>"It's still no good! Unless I can find more spiritual flames to further enhance the flame seed... This level of spiritual flame is rare in the world. I only learned of it by chance before…"</p><p>He sighed deeply.</p><p>Another failure.</p><p>The blue flame was so terrified of the Demonic Flame that the flame seed shattered before even making contact.</p><p>He didn't even dare to think about directly using the technique to refine the Demonic Flame into a flame seed. He would probably ignite himself before the technique was completed.</p><p>He made several more attempts, each ending in failure.</p><p>Finally, he gave up, stood up, his gaze shifting to the gap beside the Demonic Flame's main body, his eyes flickering.</p><p>"What method did that person use to resist the Demonic Flame's power and travel back and forth? If I could get it… With the Demonic Flame blocking the way outside, the restrictions inside are probably even more terrifying. He might not be able to take the treasures! Besides, seeing such a top-level Demonic Flame, wouldn't he be tempted? He's likely to return here in the future…"</p><p>His eyes suddenly lit up. Then, he carefully erased the traces he had left behind, and his figure vanished into thin air.</p><p>The canyon fell silent once more.</p><p>The Demonic Flame flickered, and poisonous mist drifted.</p><p>…</p><p>At the edge of the dense forest.</p><p>Qin Sang emerged from behind an ancient tree, looking vigilantly towards the wilderness.</p><p>He had changed his attire, not even wearing his cloak anymore.</p><p>As long as Cui Ji and Xiang Yi were alive, he couldn't appear as Daoist Qing Feng again. He wasn't afraid of Cui Ji, but he feared Xiang Yi's powerful background and the possibility of him mobilizing his connections to harm him secretly.</p><p>Xiang Yi and the others had long since left this place. Qin Sang didn't know where to find them, so he decided to attend to his own matters first.</p><p>The vast wilderness was empty, not a single figure in sight.</p><p>Qin Sang moved along the edge of the forest, heading towards the mountains.</p><p>Before long, he arrived at the foot of the first mountain.</p><p>This mountain wasn't particularly tall, but it stretched endlessly, blocking both the dense forest and the wilderness, like a towering wall, forming a distinct dividing line.</p><p>Beyond this mountain were rolling hills, filled with countless secret realms and ubiquitous dangers.</p><p>Some areas were as notorious as the Purple Mist Forbidden Zone.</p><p>The Poison-Repelling Armor was useless in such places; Qin Sang could only rely on his own caution.</p><p>The Celestial Tower was located behind the mountains. After crossing a few mountains, one could see its silhouette. There was no fixed path from here to the Celestial Tower, but some dangerous areas could be actively avoided.</p><p>Qin Sang took out a simple topographical map, located his position, and found that entering the mountains from here was a relatively good choice. He planned a route and set off.</p>
