<h1>Chapter 298: Guardian Spirit Beast</h1><p>Cloud Wanderer had sent not only a way to break the restriction, but also information about Luo Xingnan and the others and the mountain’s situation.</p><p>In their haste to break the restriction, they’d already lost two people.</p><p>One was Wu Chen; the other, a man with the surname Yin.</p><p>The man with the surname Yin chose betraying Sheng Yuanzi without hesitation to stay alive. He was brutal and ruthless, which made others become even more vigilant toward him. When Luo Xingnan asked him to scout the way, no one spoke up for him.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer was powerless to do anything about it.</p><p>The strength they could rely on was decreasing, while Luo Xingnan and the others’ strength still seemed intact.</p><p>However, thanks to Cloud Wanderer’s information, Qin Sang and Ge Yuan were much better off than Luo Xingnan and the others.</p><p>Although Cloud Wanderer’s report hadn’t mentioned having entered the mountain, if they waited until he had, they might not even get any scraps. So they had no choice but to rely on their own abilities to get through the last two restrictions.</p><p>Although they were in danger, they were lucky enough to get through the restrictions and reach the bottom of the mountain. But what met them was thick fog and clouds.</p><p>It looked exactly the same as what they’d seen from outside.</p><p>They were in a fog, and unlike outside, where they could see everything at a glance, their vision was completely blocked. They could only rely on memory to recall where the spirit medicine grew.</p><p>But Qin Sang and Ge Yuan didn’t act rashly.</p><p>What surprised Qin Sang was that, contrary to what he’d imagined, the mountain didn’t seem to be surrounded by restrictions that would put them in danger at every turn.</p><p>He didn’t see anything dangerous as far as the eye could see.</p><p>Qin Sang activated his divine sense and probed at the thick fog. Even at the limit of his divine sense, he still didn’t find any sign of restrictions.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and the others were also nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"This…"</p><p>Ge Yuan had evidently discovered this too, and extremely surprised and incredulously, he said, "Could it be that this place really is the cave master’s medicine garden and the restrictions are only at the foot of the mountain? Are the spirit medicines here… here for the taking?"</p><p>Qin Sang and Ge Yuan’s expressions became grim.</p><p>This was nothing like what they’d anticipated. They’d always thought there would also be many restrictions inside the mountain, and it would be very difficult to find spirit medicine.</p><p>Only then would they have a chance to get their hands on something.</p><p>But after discovering that there weren’t any arrays or restrictions, and they could pick the spirit medicine wherever they wanted, even a huge mountain wasn’t a problem for a cultivator.</p><p>There were only twenty-one spirit medicines.</p><p>They might have already been cleaned out by Luo Xingnan and the others!</p><p>Ge Yuan appeared very unwilling.</p><p>After experiencing so many hardships and countless scheming, they’d reached this point, and the spirit medicine was right before their eyes, but they couldn’t have it. No one would be willing to accept this.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Ge Yuan flickered and rushed up the mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang was just as fast as Ge Yuan. He ignored Ge Yuan and went straight to where the dark yellow Qi was.</p><p>The Profound Patterned Yellow Aloe was very important to him. If that spirit medicine wasn’t Profound Patterned Yellow Aloe, then he would give up. But if it was, then he wouldn’t give up.</p><p>Cloud Wanderer had told him that not many people understood the effects of Profound Harmony Harmony Pills. Most people thought they could only restore foundations.</p><p>There were only very few cultivators whose foundations were injured.</p><p>He didn’t know who had obtained this spirit medicine. Maybe there was a chance of trading for it.</p><p>Before Qin Sang and Ge Yuan had taken three steps, a tremendous explosion suddenly sounded from above.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The deafening boom was followed immediately by violent trembling from the mountain.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>That was the sound of rocks shattering.</p><p>Then, a piercing, earsplitting shriek rang out.</p><p>The extremely shrill shriek was filled with anger and fury. It was like a demon’s voice that drilled straight into the ears. Even when they were at the top of the mountain, they could still hear it clearly and it was extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>At the same time as the shriek, several furious roars sounded out. One of them was Luo Xingnan’s!</p><p>Chaos immediately broke out at the top of the mountain.</p><p>The fluctuations from spirit energy colliding traveled far. The fog in the mountain began to violently shake.</p><p>Piercing shrieks echoed out incessantly. Although they weren’t as deep and powerful as the first one, the effect of all of them mixed together was quite deafening, so much that Luo Xingnan and the others’ roars sounded very weak and powerless.</p><p>Luo Xingnan and the others’ opponents were clearly some kind of demon beast. Not only did they have greater numbers, they also seemed extremely powerful. Their voices were mixed together and getting faster and faster, as if they weren’t gaining the upper hand.</p><p>But there was no way to tell their true situation without seeing it for themselves.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ge Yuan halted abruptly and looked at each other. They were slightly uncertain, but more surprised.</p><p>They couldn’t help thinking about the hook serpents that had guarded the entrance.</p><p>It turns out that the mountain was not warded because there exists a guardian spirit beast here.</p><p>This was good news for them. Luoxingnan and his people were obviously fighting the guardian spirit beast, so that proved the spiritual herbs had not been picked yet.</p><p>“Daoist, can you tell what kind of demon beast it is?” Ge Yuan asked via voice transmission.</p><p>Qin Sang listened closely. There were countless types of demon beasts, and it was difficult to tell from their cries alone. He shook his head. “I can’t tell, but these demon beasts must be very fierce indeed. There’s also sounds from Senior Wanderingzi, so the demon beasts must have gotten to him!”</p><p>Wanderingzi acted with composure, but he was roaring now, so it was possible that he was trying to transmit a message to them.</p><p>“Let’s go for the herbs!”</p><p>Ge Yuan made a decision right away. Luoxingnan and his people were keeping each other busy with the demon beasts, and this was a golden opportunity for the two of them, so why not gather the herbs while they had the chance?</p><p>Ge Yuan tried to rush to a spiritual herb he remembered, but Qin Sang stopped him.</p><p>“Senior Wanderingzi and I worked out that the brightness of the lights could possibly be related to the quality of the spiritual herbs. The lights at the foot of the mountain are mostly dim and thin, so the most precious spiritual herbs are on the peak. The situation is changing rapidly, so we cannot waste any more time at the bottom.”</p><p>With that, Qin Sang rushed to the peak.</p><p>Ge Yuan listened to the sounds coming from the peak, and thought to himself that maybe it was just an illusion, but the demon beast’s cries sounded a little weaker.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was just an illusion, he knew Qin Sang was right, so he quickly followed.</p><p>The two restrained their auras and continued to fly toward the peak.</p><p>“Daoist Ge, has Senior Wanderingzi told you which herbs he needs?” Qin Sang asked quickly.</p><p>Wanderingzi appeared to be trapped by the guardian spirit beasts.</p><p>Once Qin Sang had obtained the yellow pattern herb, he planned to take the herb Wanderingzi needed along with him.</p><p>After all, they could successfully make it this far largely thanks to Wanderingzi, so they could not turn against him now.</p><p>“I do not know.”</p><p>Ge Yuan shook his head, but then his gaze shifted in a different direction. He was pleased. “I remember there being the scent of a spiritual herb, and it was very prominent!”</p><p>With that, Ge Yuan overtook Qin Sang and headed in that direction.</p><p>It seemed he would have to search later for a spiritual herb that could mend the soul, but fortunately he knew of such a herb.</p><p>Qin Sang thought it over and changed his course to follow Ge Yuan without a word.</p><p>Chapter 298: Guardian Beasts</p><p>Yun Youzi relayed not only the path to break the restrictions, but also the status of Luo Xingnan's group and the situation within the mountain.  Two lives were lost to achieve this. One was Wu Chen, the other, a man surnamed Yin.  Desperate to survive, Yin readily betrayed Sheng Yuanzi, acting ruthlessly and decisively. This, however, made the others even more wary of him, and so when Luo Xingnan forced him to scout ahead, no one spoke up for him. Yun Youzi could do nothing about it.  Their available manpower dwindled, while Luo Xingnan's side remained at full strength.</p><p>Thanks to Yun Youzi's intel, Qin Sang and Ge Yuan's progress was much smoother than Luo Xingnan's group. However, Yun Youzi hadn't entered the mountain itself. Had they waited for Yun Youzi's further report, they might have missed out entirely.  Therefore, the final two layers of restrictions had to be breached by Qin Sang and Ge Yuan alone.</p><p>Though fraught with peril, they managed to navigate the restrictions and reach the foot of the mountain.  They were met with a scene shrouded in swirling clouds and mist, identical to what they'd observed from the outside.  Engulfed by the fog, unlike their previous vantage point, they couldn't see the glow of the spirit herbs, relying solely on memory to recall their locations.  However, neither Qin Sang nor Ge Yuan acted rashly.</p><p>[Announcement: Our official account will be giving out cash and reward points daily. Follow to claim yours.

Official Account: [Reading Base]]</p><p>To Qin Sang's surprise, the mountain wasn't as heavily fortified as he'd imagined, nor was it riddled with dangers. At least not at first glance. He extended his divine sense into the thick fog, reaching its limit, but still found no trace of restrictions. Luo Xingnan and his group were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>"This…" Ge Yuan, equally astonished, voiced his disbelief, "Could it be... that this truly is the cave master's herb garden?  Protected only by restrictions at the foot of the mountain, with no other defenses?  The spirit herbs… are free for the taking?"</p><p>Both Qin Sang and Ge Yuan's expressions darkened. This was completely different from their expectations. They'd anticipated further layers of restrictions within the mountain, making collecting the herbs a difficult task.  Only then would they have a chance to claim their share.  But now, they found no formations or restrictions, the spirit herbs seemingly there for anyone to pick. Even for a towering mountain, it would take a cultivator mere moments to reach the top.  Twenty-one spirit herbs in total. Perhaps Luo Xingnan and his group had already plundered them all!</p><p>Ge Yuan's face was etched with frustration.  After enduring countless hardships and treacherous schemes, having come this far with the spirit herbs within reach, only to return empty-handed, anyone would be bitter.</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Ge Yuan shot towards the mountain. Qin Sang, equally swift, ignored Ge Yuan and headed straight for the location of the Primordial Yellow Qi. The Profound-Veined Yellow Essence was of paramount importance to him.  If that spirit herb wasn't the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, so be it, but if it was, he wouldn't give up easily.  Yun Youzi had mentioned that few truly understood the effects of the Profound Harmony Pill, most believing it only served to restore foundations. Among cultivators, very few suffered from damaged foundations. He didn't know who had obtained the herb, but perhaps a trade was possible.</p><p>They had barely traveled three meters when a deafening roar erupted from above.</p><p>*BOOM!*</p><p>The earth-shattering sound was followed by a violent tremor that shook the entire mountain.</p><p>*Crash!*</p><p>The sound of shattering rock echoed.  Then, a piercing shriek tore through the air.  The shriek was incredibly sharp, filled with rage and savagery, like a demonic sound capable of penetrating eardrums. Despite the distance, it was still incredibly unpleasant to hear.</p><p>Simultaneous with the shriek were several shouts, one of which belonged to Luo Xingnan!</p><p>Chaos erupted on the mountaintop.</p><p>The fluctuations of clashing spiritual power rippled outwards, violently disturbing the clouds and mist.</p><p>Similar shrieks followed, though none as powerful as the first.  Mixed together, they created a terrifying cacophony, making Luo Xingnan's shouts sound weak and faint. Their opponents were clearly some kind of demonic beasts, not only numerous but also powerful.  Judging by their increasingly frantic cries, they didn't seem to have the upper hand.</p><p>However, without witnessing the battle firsthand, it was impossible to ascertain the true situation.</p><p>Qin Sang and Ge Yuan stopped abruptly, exchanging glances filled with surprise and uncertainty, but mostly relief. They both thought of the Hook Snakes guarding the entrance. No wonder there were no restrictions on the mountain; there were guardian beasts here as well. This was good news. Luo Xingnan's group was clearly entangled with the guardian beasts, meaning the spirit herbs hadn't been taken yet.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist, can you tell what kind of beasts they are?" Ge Yuan transmitted his voice.</p><p>Qin Sang listened intently.  Countless types of demonic beasts existed, making identification by sound alone difficult. He shook his head.  "I can't tell, but they must be ferocious.  I hear Yun Youzi's voice, he's engaged with them too!"</p><p>Yun Youzi, usually calm and collected, was now shouting, likely sending them a signal.</p><p>"Gather the herbs!" Ge Yuan made a swift decision.</p><p>Luo Xingnan's group and the beasts were preoccupied with each other, presenting a perfect opportunity.  If not now, when?</p><p>As Ge Yuan darted towards a spirit herb he remembered, Qin Sang stopped him.  "Yun Youzi and I analyzed the light.  Its brightness likely corresponds to the herb's quality.  Most of the faint glows are at the foot of the mountain.  The most valuable ones are at the summit. The situation can change in an instant. Don't waste time down here."</p><p>With that, Qin Sang flew towards the peak.</p><p>Ge Yuan listened to the sounds from the summit again.  Was it his imagination, or were the beasts' cries indeed weakening?  Regardless, he knew Qin Sang was right and quickly followed.</p><p>They concealed their auras as best they could, flying at top speed.</p><p>"Fellow Daoist Ge, did Yun Youzi mention which herb he needs?" Qin Sang asked urgently.</p><p>Yun Youzi was now trapped by the guardian beasts.</p><p>After obtaining the Profound-Veined Yellow Essence, Qin Sang intended to help Yun Youzi collect his needed herb. After all, Yun Youzi had played a crucial role in getting them this far.  He couldn't just abandon him.</p><p>"I don't know," Ge Yuan shook his head, then his gaze fixed on the area ahead to the left.  "I recall a spirit herb's aura over there, one of the brightest!"  He sped past Qin Sang towards it.</p><p>*I'll have to look for any soul-restoring herbs later.  Fortunately, I know quite a few,* Qin Sang thought.</p><p>Watching Ge Yuan's receding figure, Qin Sang pondered for a moment, then changed direction, following close behind.</p>
