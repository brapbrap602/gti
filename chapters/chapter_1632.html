<h1>Chapter 1623: The Battle for the Array</h1><p>As Qin Sang moved, the divine patterns on his left arm gradually faded.  The power of the divine patterns was fully activated.  Finally, only a crescent blood moon remained on the back of Qin Sang's left hand.  Qin Sang stared at the blood moon, concentrating his senses.  Gradually, the blood moon's glow subsided, leaving only a blood moon-shaped mark; that special aura was sealed within the mark.</p><p>"No reaction…" Qin Sang murmured.  The lack of feedback from the blood moon indicated that the transformed god corpse wasn't nearby.  Qin Sang wasn't sure about the range of the mark's sensing ability; Gui Mu's explanation was vague, so he could only proceed step by step.  The mark left no effect on his hand.  Qin Sang shook his hand, ignoring it, glanced at the clifftop, and with a thought, his second Nascent Soul flew out from his forehead, summoning his external incarnation. He planned to send his incarnation ahead to scout the terrain of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect's heartland.</p><p>The incarnation summoned the Snow-Stepping Divine Blade, ready to depart. Qin Sang remembered something, the Qianjun Ring flashed, and a blood-hand-wrapped crocodile bone flew out. It was the blood crocodile bone hand Qin Sang had refined earlier.  The crocodile bone's power was extraordinary and required control through the blood hand.  He gave it to his incarnation, providing an extra method of dealing with any situation.  Having previously refined the blood crocodile bone hand, the incarnation put on the blood hand and stowed the bone, then stealthily moved towards the depths of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang watched his external incarnation disappear into the mountains and emerged from his hiding place. By then, Zhu Wu Dao and the others had broken through the red mist and reached the clifftop, using the crystal stele to summon the phantom of the ancient hall at the top.  From the bottom of the cliff, the clear light emanating from the top was visible.  Qin Sang no longer hesitated and climbed the stone path carved out by Zhu Wu Dao and the others. The path was winding. Qin Sang proceeded at a steady pace, instructing the Sky-Eyed Butterfly to keep a close watch on the unusual changes at the clifftop.</p><p>Through the Sky-Eyed Butterfly, he saw faint spatial fluctuations around the pavilion where Zi Lei Zhenren and Yue Ling Tian were hiding. The two finally emerged from the stone pavilion, but stopped just short of the summit.  Zi Lei Zhenren sensed something, his expression shifting as he suddenly glanced down the mountain.  Qin Sang reacted swiftly, darting to the edge of the stone path and using the remaining restrictions to conceal himself. Yue Ling Tian noticed Zi Lei Zhenren's movement and transmitted a question. Zi Lei Zhenren mused, "Including our junior brother, only four people have reached the clifftop."</p><p>"A rabble!" Yue Ling Tian scoffed.  "Some are here for the opportunities within the immortal hall, others covet the treasures of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect; they aren't united. The Tian Tong Hall's teleportation array is within the ancient hall.  The situation is settled.  No matter how many small fry there are, they can't make any waves!"</p><p>The Cloud Carving Dragon had blocked the path to the Wuxiang Immortal Sect, presenting both advantages and disadvantages.  While Hua Chen Zi hadn't been able to enter promptly, most of the Wuxiang Immortal Sect remnants were also blocked.  With him, Zi Lei and He Gao Zhenren working together, who dared to stop them?</p><p>Zi Lei Zhenren nodded slightly, agreeing that even if someone were hiding below, it wouldn't affect the overall situation.  To avoid unforeseen complications, he withdrew his gaze.</p><p>On the clifftop, the statue in Zhu Wu Dao's sleeve was burning hot. He acted nonchalantly, placing his hand on the ancient hall's door. The door was sealed by restrictions, but due to damage to the hall, the restrictions had many flaws. Zhu Wu Dao's eyes shone with divine light as he focused on deducing the restrictions.  The three others also arrived before the door, dividing the work of breaking the restrictions.  Soon, Zhu Wu Dao formed a hand seal and struck out, a golden handprint landing squarely in the center of the hall door.  Without communication, the other three worked together seamlessly.</p><p>The Crying Spirit Cave Master summoned a wooden-spike-like treasure, holding it between two fingers, infusing it with true energy. The spike shot out a black line, piercing directly into the inner part of the restriction; it was clearly a treasure specialized in breaking restrictions. The Swordsman's method was simple yet effective. His swordsmanship, unlike before, was subtle and refined, silently cutting into the restrictions, demonstrating superb skill.  Mo Xing Dao couldn't help but glance over, also summoning a small silver bell-shaped treasure.  He gently shook it in his hand.  Though no bell sound could be heard, shaped waves emanated and floated towards the hall door.</p><p>With their combined efforts, the hall door's restrictions finally reached their limit.  The door trembled violently; brilliant light flashed, then quickly dimmed.</p><p>'Creak!'</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao forcefully pushed open the hall door, revealing the interior.  Unexpectedly, the hall was exceptionally spacious, yet its furnishings were simple to the point of being sparse.  Grand yet empty!  Only four jade pillars stood within the hall, carved with dragons and phoenixes, depicting various immortal birds and divine beasts—exquisite and lifelike, possessing a hint of the divine beasts' aura, as if they could step down from the pillars at any moment.  It was clearly not the work of ordinary people.</p><p>Jade pillars supported the grand hall.  </p><p>Beyond them, a swirling green light hovered between four standing pillars.</p><p>Within the green light was a teleportation array!</p><p>Two meditation cushions lay at the array's edge, suggesting former guardians, now long gone.</p><p>Seeing the array, the four exchanged excited glances.  Ignoring the hall's simplicity, their attention was riveted on the array.</p><p>Master Qi Ling hesitated at the doorway, watching Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>"The ancient hall should be trap-free…"</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao said, then dashed into the hall, directly to the array, finding the path clear.</p><p>Closer inspection revealed the array's remarkable intricacy.</p><p>Suspended in mid-air, it drew on earth energy, its complex prohibitions rivaling rare ancient arrays—a masterpiece impossible for modern cultivators.</p><p>This array could pierce the celestial prohibitions outside the Immortal Palace, leading directly from the Southern Frontier into the Palace's interior.</p><p>The Daoist and Buddhist sects controlling the Immortal Palace couldn't achieve this.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao and his companions gazed, awestruck, suspecting the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect had relocated and modified an ancient array.</p><p>Even so, the difficulty was unimaginable.</p><p>The array stood before them, the Immortal Palace just a step away.</p><p>Their expressions grew graver.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao circled the array twice. Under their expectant gazes, he nodded.  "Heaven favors us. The array is intact!"</p><p>Hearing this, Master Qi Ling and the other two breathed sighs of relief. They sensed it, but needed Zhu Wu Dao's confirmation.</p><p>Even now, Zhu Wu Dao showed no sign of dismissing them to claim the Immortal Palace alone.</p><p>The three tacitly allowed him to approach the array.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao performed hand seals. After a flurry of activity, the array slowly rotated, its energy pulling, causing the already damaged hall to tremble, threatening collapse.</p><p>Then,</p><p>Streams of light leaped from Zhu Wu Dao's storage pouch—all high-grade spirit stones.</p><p>The South Sea was not vast; the distance between the Southern Frontier and the Immortal Palace was not great, but for safety, Zhu Wu Dao used only high-grade stones.</p><p>'Swish swish swish…'</p><p>The stones slotted into the array's apertures.</p><p>Instantly, the array vibrated, a thick green beam erupting, almost shattering the hall.</p><p>While Master Qi Ling and Mo Xing Dao watched, the Swordsman suddenly leaped, soaring above the array, confronting Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>Simultaneously, two figures landed before the ancient hall.</p><p>Master Zi Lei and Yue Ling Tian had arrived!</p><p>"Eight Views!"</p><p>Hearing the breaking sound and seeing Master Zi Lei, Master Qi Ling and Mo Xing Dao's faces paled. They darted to the other side of the array, exchanged glances, and looked at the Swordsman.</p><p>His identity was clear.</p><p>The Swordsman, fixing Zhu Wu Dao, dropped his disguise. His bones cracked, his body thinned, his features drastically altered.</p><p>Light flashed, and the Swordsman transformed into a lean Daoist—Master He Gao!</p><p>"Sect Leader Zhu, long time no see."  Master He Gao greeted him.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao, the head of the Qu Yang Mountain lineage of Tian Hao Tower, was renowned in Central State. Master He Gao had interacted with him before, so they were somewhat familiar.</p><p>Before Zhu Wu Dao's true nature was revealed, no one would have guessed he was a remnant of the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect!</p><p>'Thump! Thump!'</p><p>Footsteps echoed in the hall.</p><p>Master Zi Lei approached slowly, without summoning any magical artifacts, his gaze on the array.</p><p>Master Qi Ling and Mo Xing Dao instinctively held their breath, their faces grim.</p><p>Eight Views, Tai Yue Mountain—three Grand Cultivators had arrived, two of them sect leader-level masters.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao remained calm, narrowing his eyes, then suddenly smiled. "I wondered why it went so smoothly.  I hadn't even deployed all my reserves before successfully opening the Immortal Sect's legacy. I always felt a hidden force lurking, veiled. I thought it was another Wu Xiang faction, but it's you!  Two Immortal Palaces and Daoist legacies aren't enough for the sect master, you've set your sights on the Wu Xiang Immortal Sect's legacy?"</p><p>His tone grew lighter.  He glanced at Master Zi Lei's back. "Where's that bald donkey?"</p><p>As he spoke,</p><p>The array's spectacle intensified.</p><p>The ancient hall, under assault, shook violently.</p><p>Thick green light burst from the hall.</p><p>Before the hall, another figure was illuminated by the array's light—Qin Sang, who had sensed the void fluctuation and swiftly arrived.</p><p>On the precipice,</p><p>Seven grand cultivators finally gathered.</p><p>Everyone was astonished.</p><p>Expecting Su Zinan and his group's return, they instead encountered a stranger, seemingly unaffiliated with the Purple Thunder Real Person.</p><p>"Seize him!"</p><p>Without turning, Purple Thunder Real Person's gaze shifted, suddenly fixing on Zhu Wu Dao.</p><p>Crane Chorus Real Person, eager to act but restrained by his senior brother's presence, immediately unleashed his magical treasure, the Jade Smoke Torrent, upon receiving the order.</p><p>A thousand illusory lights shimmered.</p><p>The light smoke instantly transformed into a surging torrent, a white streak hurtling towards Zhu Wu Dao's face.</p><p>"Do you all intend to watch, thinking the Eight Scenic Views will share the Immortal Palace's opportunities with you?"</p><p>Simultaneously with Purple Thunder Real Person's command, Zhu Wu Dao roared.</p><p>This was not only directed at the Weeping Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xing Dao, but also at Qin Sang, who had just arrived—anyone not an ally of the Daoist League could be used!</p><p>*Whoosh!*</p><p>Purple Thunder Real Person moved like lightning, dashing towards the transmission array.</p><p>En route, he raised his right hand, fingers slightly curved, purple light swirling.  The sound of thunder echoed through the ancient hall, deafeningly loud, as five bolts of purple lightning shot out.</p><p>Thick as thunder pythons, the purple lightning clashed with the white torrent, piercing the air.</p><p>The goal was not merely capture, but seizing the initiative.</p><p>Yue Lingtian was equally swift, his legs pounding the ground,  yellowish-brown energy rising from the earth to form a mysterious array beneath the transmission array.</p><p>*Puff! Puff! Puff!*</p><p>More than ten yellowish-brown pillars shot out.</p><p>Thick and heavy, these columns encircled the transmission array like a cage, aiming to seal it within.</p><p>From Zhu Wu Dao activating the transmission array to the appearance of Purple Thunder Real Person, Yue Lingtian, and Qin Sang, and then Purple Thunder Real Person's attack, all happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p>However, everyone present had cultivated for many years; even with the sudden change, their judgment remained unaffected.</p><p>While the three cultivators' abilities were formidable, the counterattacks from Weeping Spirit Cave Master and the others were no less impressive.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's life or death was of no concern to them, but his words were accurate.</p><p>The Eight Scenic Views and the Ganlu Temple, having occupied the Immortal Palace, had never been known to share opportunities with others; their domineering actions were notorious, and today would be no different.</p><p>Even Qin Sang intervened.</p><p>Entering the hall, he flashed to the side, his Golden Sinking Sword cleaving the air.  Faster than a shooting star, the sword light vanished mid-air, transforming into a sword array, yet deliberately avoiding Purple Thunder Real Person and Yue Lingtian, targeting the transmission array directly.</p><p>The Eight Scenic Views and Ganlu Temple's seizure of the Immortal Palace was no secret.  The two major sects had other ways to enter, unlike others who relied solely on the transmission array!</p><p>Unaware of the situation, Qin Sang and the others assumed that Purple Thunder Real Person sought to eliminate future threats by destroying the transmission array and thus easily cutting off their access to the Immortal Palace.</p><p>Undoubtedly, protecting the transmission array was paramount!</p><p>"Fellow Daoists, why such bloodshed?  Let's talk," Qin Sang sincerely appealed.</p><p>In the void, sword energy surged downwards.</p><p>At that moment, the yellowish-brown light Yue Lingtian controlled erupted.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The light advanced halfway, then suddenly dimmed, enveloped by the sword array.</p><p>The yellowish-brown pillars were greatly impeded, their surfaces becoming mottled and riddled with holes, forcibly suppressed by the sword array.</p><p>Qin Sang and Yue Lingtian, meeting for the first time, exchanged a blow from afar.</p><p>Yue Lingtian's expression changed slightly. He countered by summoning a three-legged cauldron, which spun and crashed into the sword array.</p><p>Needless to say, not only Qin Sang, but also Weeping Spirit Cave Master and Mo Xing Dao acted similarly.</p><p>Weeping Spirit Cave Master's red flower treasure remained close at hand; with a thought, it transformed into a rainbow, soaring above the transmission array. Its flower crown inverted like a canopy, unleashing torrential spiritual energy, sweeping away any force attempting to approach the array.</p><p>Mo Xing Dao secretly formed a hand seal, hesitated, then changed it to another, his throat rumbling as he expelled a white spiritual energy.</p><p>This energy was exceptionally sharp, swift as a sword, daring to strike directly at the purple lightning unleashed by Purple Thunder Real Person.</p><p>Simultaneously, everyone charged towards the transmission array.</p><p>Within the ancient hall, various strange lights erupted, intermingling chaotically.</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao was at the heart of the storm, his every move affecting the situation.</p><p>At this critical juncture…</p><p>Zhu Wu Dao's relaxed expression vanished.  The Jade Smoke Torrent was close at hand, but he neither dodged nor evaded.  He straightened his upper body, and in an instant, golden light blazed forth.</p><p>Golden light encircled him, containing countless runes.</p><p>The light refracted, the runes recombined, and after a dazzling display of transformation, Zhu Wu Dao was clad in a golden battle armor!</p><p>The armor's luster flowed across his body, not an illusion but real.  Its strength was undeniable at a glance.</p><p>Still unsatisfied, Zhu Wu Dao unleashed a powerful voice, preparing to use other abilities or treasures.</p><p>The battle for the array was about to begin.</p><p>At this moment…</p><p>The transmission array absorbed the spiritual energy of the spirit stones; the spatial fluctuations became increasingly pronounced, the transmission light shining brightly to its peak.</p><p>Suddenly, it extinguished.</p>
