<h1>Chapter 1145: Escape</h1><p>The phantom of the Azure Bird created such a commotion that it attracted the attention of the beasts.  A moment later, they would have been trapped.  The falcon demon, restrained by Qin Sang, was unable to move, unable to flee. Seeing Qin Sang unconcerned, it became furious.</p><p>Qin Sang awoke, realizing that they had to leave; they couldn't break through here. While enduring the impact of the Azure Bird's power, Qin Sang sensed an opportunity for a breakthrough.  The *Heavenly Demon Transformation* was close to advancing to the fourth level. However, comprehending the Heavenly Demon Dharma Image required time and couldn't be rushed.</p><p>Before the breakthrough could be completed, the  Qianji Demon King arrived.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang made an immediate decision.</p><p>His expression darkened, he suppressed the Azure Bird's power with all his might, stabilizing the phoenix wings. Luckily, the Heavenly Eye Butterfly was also absorbing energy, helping to share the burden.  Qin Sang could still manage, forcibly multitasking: he mentally recited the cultivation technique to regulate the chaotic power within his body while fleeing.</p><p>He flickered, instantly appearing at the treasure vault entrance.  </p><p>Within the green glow, streaks of silver light mixed, emitting thunderous sounds. The speed was faster than Qin Sang anticipated.</p><p>"This is lightning escape…"</p><p>Qin Sang was startled.  After his wings fused with the Azure Bird's power, he had unexpectedly mastered the lightning escape ability.  It was an unexpected surprise.  His speed was even faster than before. However, this state wouldn't last long; the Azure Bird's power might lose control at any moment, shattering his wings.</p><p>"Brother!  Master! We have no grievances, I beg you to show mercy! Release the restrictions on me, I can run away by myself!"</p><p>The falcon demon suddenly changed its tone, pleading bitterly.</p><p>It had been cursing just moments ago; now it was calling the other "Master." This fellow was quite adaptable!</p><p>Qin Sang couldn't bear to watch, flicked a finger, releasing the restrictions on the falcon demon, and dashed out of the tunnel. He saw that the king's consort's chambers had already been destroyed, reduced to rubble, smoke rising everywhere.</p><p>He would keep the falcon demon alive; he could question it later about the Wuyaya Valley and search for the Intermittent Blood Mulberry. Ten divine trees—one could never have too many.  But taking the falcon demon along was impossible; it would depend on whether it was lucky enough to survive.</p><p>The falcon demon regained its freedom, following closely behind Qin Sang as he rushed out of the tunnel. Its eyes flickered.  It suddenly realized that Qin Sang's aura held a great allure, its bloodline throbbing with excitement. The phantom of the Azure Bird in the stone slab was what truly attracted it. But the falcon demon only wanted to live, with no thoughts of treasure hunting.</p><p>The lesser demons sensed the abnormality, shouting and rushing towards them.</p><p>Qin Sang didn't stop, aiming for the formation exit.</p><p>"Looking for death!"</p><p>The white-furred eagle was the first to spot Qin Sang, furious.  He was ordered to guard the demon king's residence, yet a thief had infiltrated at this moment. The location of the incident made the white-furred eagle's head spin: it was the demon king's consort's chambers! He didn't know whether the consort was alive or dead.  Thinking of the demon king's fury and his impending fate, the white-furred eagle wanted to devour the other on the spot.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>A white shadow dashed towards them, leaving the lesser demons behind.</p><p>Qin Sang felt a gust of wind, the white-furred eagle intercepting him.  The white-furred eagle let out a deafening shriek, filled with rage.  Demonic energy surged, its claws like sharp swords, its wings like long blades.  The white-furred eagle transformed into countless images, a storm of swords and blades, overwhelming in its ferocity.</p><p>At this moment, the Azure Bird's power within Qin Sang could explode at any time.  He was desperate to escape, find a place to break through, and he wouldn't hold back.</p><p>'Swish!'</p><p>Sword light shot out, fast as a meteor.</p><p>The white-furred eagle felt an impending danger. Before it could react, the void ahead was filled with countless cold lights. It was then horrified to discover that its attack was instantly shattered by its opponent, followed by the impact of the sword energy.  The white-furred eagle's mind was overwhelmed by the sword energy, its body stiff, filled with terror.</p><p>'Bang!'</p><p>A scream.</p><p>The white-furred eagle was sent flying by Qin Sang, blood spraying, feathers scattered, severely injured. In the last moment, the white-furred eagle did its best to save its life, avoiding immediate death. This was also because Qin Sang didn't want to waste time on it.</p><p>The spiritual sword paved the way!  Qin Sang's figure didn't pause for a moment.  The lesser demons only saw a flash before losing sight of him.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>Qin Sang burst out of the formation, then suddenly changed direction, flying upwards.  Just then, a thunderous roar echoed in Qin Sang's ears, making his head buzz.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>The Qianji Demon King!</p><p>Qin Sang’s heart pounded. He had finally drawn the Demon King.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw a rainbow of light bursting from the direction of the banquet.  Demonic energy soared, the red light intense, a clear sign of the King's furious rage.</p><p>As the voice echoed, Qin Sang felt his body weigh down, the Demon King's oppressive aura descending.</p><p>Simultaneously, a grey, shadowy mist coalesced in the void. Qin Sang felt like he was sinking into a bog; his escape light dimmed, his speed noticeably slowing.</p><p>Qin Sang was now trapped between two forces.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Qin Sang’s face contorted, his voice raw with desperation.</p><p>As if sensing its master's urgency, the ebony sword let out a sharp, piercing cry. A sword array formed around Qin Sang, instantly taking shape.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>The sword array exploded, a column of light shooting towards the heavens.</p><p>The surrounding grey mist was swept away by the array.</p><p>Above the Wan Snake Abyss, the guards were heavily deployed.  They were about to intercept Qin Sang when the light column blasted a path through them, throwing their formation into disarray.  Qin Sang didn't look back, rushing straight out of the abyss.</p><p>Deep night, all was quiet, until the peace was shattered.</p><p>Within the abyss,</p><p>The Qianji Demon King was momentarily surprised by his failure. He was quite puzzled.</p><p>This thief felt… strange.  He radiated incredibly pure demonic energy, yet his swordsmanship rivaled that of the top human sword cultivators.  His aura was even stranger, not like a transformed great demon or a human Nascent Soul cultivator, yet he fearlessly withstood the Demon King's pressure, easily countering his divine powers, and his escape technique was even something the Qianji Demon King admired.</p><p>This level of strength shouldn't be possible for someone at the Golden Core stage.</p><p>“A wounded great demon, or… a trap?”</p><p>The Qianji Demon King couldn't help but wonder.</p><p>Suddenly, the Demon King recognized the thief’s aura; a familiar feeling.</p><p>“The stone tablet! The Azure Bird! Could this person have Azure Bird blood and have stolen the tablet?”</p><p>After obtaining the tablet, the Qianji Demon King had tried everything to unlock its secrets, failing to do so. He had simply stored it in his treasure vault, almost forgetting about it.</p><p>He never expected a descendant of the Azure Bird to still exist.</p><p>Somehow, news of the mysterious stone tablet had leaked.</p><p>Certain it wasn't a trap, but a theft of a priceless treasure, the Qianji Demon King wouldn't let the thief escape so easily.  A cold glint flashed in his eyes, he snorted coldly, and pursued Qin Sang out of the Wan Snake Abyss.</p><p>The falcon demon, naturally possessing lightning escape abilities, and with Qin Sang drawing all the attention, managed to slip out successfully.</p><p>Even though Qin Sang had released him from his restraints, the falcon demon felt no gratitude whatsoever; after all, Qin Sang was responsible for the entire situation.</p><p>However, witnessing Qin Sang repelling the white-haired eagle and breaking through the Demon King's blockade in one swift move, the falcon demon couldn't help but be amazed by Qin Sang's strength.</p>
