<h1>Chapter 1884: Imperial Feather</h1><p>Chapter 1884: Imperial Feather</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuanwu Turtle was the first to obtain the Sky Phoenix Feather, and it has a close relationship with the Four Saints Palace.</p><p>Everyone knew that trying to take the Sky Phoenix Feather from the Nine-Lives Xuanwu Turtle at this moment was unrealistic.  Internal conflict would only lead to being picked off one by one by the ancient demons, resulting in everyone's death.  The only priority was preventing the Sky Phoenix Feather from falling into the ancient demons' hands.</p><p>Having experienced countless battles, they all instinctively changed their target without needing communication. They blocked the pursuing ancient demon spirits, protecting the Nine-Lives Xuanwu Turtle.</p><p>Seeing the situation was hopeless, the ancient demon spirits turned to attack Mo Qingzhu. The two demons joined forces and completely suppressed the Jiao Dragon King.</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King was torn apart by the two demons.</p><p>Blood rained down, the Jiao Dragon King didn't even have time to scream.</p><p>Witnessing this, everyone's eyelids twitched, shocked by the ancient demons' brutal methods.</p><p>The Jiao Dragon King's spirit essence was also captured.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu coldly snorted, his palm clenching violently. The Jiao Dragon King's spirit essence and all his remains were compressed into a giant blood orb, its essence extracted and refined.</p><p>'Whoosh!'</p><p>None of the Jiao Dragon King's energy was wasted; it was all poured into the blood coffin.</p><p>Bloody runes flickered on the surface of the coffin; a mysterious formation faintly emerged.</p><p>A faint bloody hue stained the sword energy.</p><p>The blood coffin's aura surged.</p><p>The storm grew even more violent.</p><p>The tide was turning.</p><p>Seeing this, everyone was terrified, understanding the ancient demons' intentions: to use the blood and souls of everyone as a sacrifice to weaken the sword energy and release the main body!</p><p>"This is an ancient treasure of the Yaohai Phoenix Clan. Legend says it was crafted using the Sky Phoenix Feather..."</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuanwu Turtle rushed to Lady Nangui's side, honestly handing over the Sky Phoenix Feather and detailing everything he knew.</p><p>Lady Nangui activated the Demon-Subduing Stele as a precaution.</p><p>An elder received the Sky Phoenix Feather, and after examining it with his divine sense, his face grew serious.  "Although this treasure has been refined into a kind of magical artifact, it still retains the Sky Phoenix's aura. It requires unique refining techniques to be fully refined and utilized. Do you know the Phoenix Clan's treasure-refining techniques?"</p><p>The last question was directed at the Nine-Lives Xuanwu Turtle.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuanwu Turtle shook his head with a wry smile. "Although we cooperated, the Jiao Dragon King and Nine Phoenix King were wary of us and wouldn't entrust such an important treasure to me."</p><p>"We might be able to forcefully control it using the ancestor's treasure-refining technique, but its power will be greatly reduced. It might only be enough to send one person away..."</p><p>The elder said in a low voice.</p><p>Lady Nangui transmitted a message to everyone, "We don't know how long the sword energy can hold. Once the ancient demons break free, not only will we die, but the entire Canglang Sea will suffer. The only way is to repair the ancient seals and restore their power to cooperate with the sword energy and reseal the ancient demons. The ancient demon's main body and its spirit are at odds; the spirit can't fully control the demon puppet.  Therefore, without the main body's control, the demon puppet's power will be significantly weakened."</p><p>The demon puppet referred to Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>They had seen clearly that the ancient demon spirit and its main body each had their own agendas. Though forced to cooperate, they were actually wary of each other.</p><p>Everyone's expressions varied after hearing the message.</p><p>The battle in the storm's center intensified, making it almost impossible to see the blood coffin and the sword energy clearly. Yet, the blood coffin’s power was awe-inspiring, causing fear in everyone's hearts.</p><p>In contrast, the sword energy had no root or source; no one knew how long it could suppress the blood coffin.</p><p>Furthermore, Mo Qingzhu and the ancient demon spirit were too powerful; they might not even survive until the blood coffin appeared.</p><p>"Are you two trying to make us risk our lives to protect you while you escape?"</p><p>Old Master Fang, whose true form was a withered cicada, was expressionless, but his tone was clearly dissatisfied.</p><p>"Repairing the ancient seals requires sending the Demon-Subduing Stele back; only we know how to use it. You need not worry; only my senior brother will leave. I will stay!"</p><p>Lady Nangui said coldly.</p><p>"Junior sister..."</p><p>The elder tried to speak, but was interrupted by Lady Nangui.</p><p>"Senior brother, although you performed the Sacrifice Yuan Technique later than me, you are seriously injured and haven't recovered. You won't last long.  Quickly repair the ancient seals and seal the ancient demons, then we can be saved…"</p><p>Lady Nangui allowed them to scan the Sky Phoenix Feather with their divine senses.</p><p>Everyone knew Lady Nangui wasn't lying. This seemed to be the only option.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everyone exchanged their perceptions and instantly understood the situation, making their decision.</p><p>They were all decisive individuals.</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuanwu Turtle and the Great Shaman transmitted their knowledge of the two clans' ancient seals to the elder.  They hadn't completely unlocked the seals, only a small portion, making restoration possible.</p><p>At that moment, Gu Mo's fragmented soul and Mo Qingzhu were jointly tearing apart the Jiao Long King.</p><p>Watching the Jiao Long King being thrown into the blood coffin, Gu Mo's fragmented soul's eyes were greedy and bloodthirsty. He subconsciously licked his lips but dared not be too presumptuous.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu's blood-red eyes turned, fixated on the elder holding the Sky Phoenix Feather, and coldly said, "Kill!"</p><p>They understood that once someone escaped the blood-colored barrier and repaired the seal, Gu Mo's true form would have no chance of turning the tables.</p><p>The elder's situation was far better than the Jiao Long King's; he had numerous allies.</p><p>"Hold them off!"</p><p>Ling Zhuzi shouted.</p><p>Everyone was prepared and immediately stood before the elder, buying him time.  Their roles were clearly defined.</p><p>The Great Shaman, Fang Laomo, Ling Zhuzi, and the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle attacked Mo Qingzhu.  The Demon Lord, having fought Gu Mo's fragmented soul many times and understanding him best, covered the elder while assisting the Demon Lord in blocking Gu Mo's fragmented soul.</p><p>They had already placed great importance on Mo Qingzhu.</p><p>However, chaos erupted immediately upon engaging.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu appeared suddenly.</p><p>Demonic Qi filled the sky, Mo Qingzhu's figure ethereal. His escape techniques were so astonishing that for a time, everyone struggled to pinpoint his true location.</p><p>Fortunately, everyone was no ordinary person, and their coordination was excellent. Thunder, star sand, and the Xuan Turtle's shell shadows complemented each other, forming a powerful barrier to resist the Demonic Qi.  A yellow light darted through it, leaving behind the shadows of withered cicadas, patching the gaps – this was Fang Laomo's doing.</p><p>Various phenomena appeared simultaneously, colliding with the Demonic Qi with a roar.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu's figure emerged from the Demonic Qi, then vanished in a flash.</p><p>'Rip!'</p><p>To everyone's shock, a hand tore through their carefully constructed barrier and shot towards the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle like lightning.</p><p>Mo Qingzhu's gaze was vicious; he had instantly recognized the slightly weaker Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle as their weak point.</p><p>Their divine powers were once again thwarted.</p><p>Watching Mo Qingzhu tear through the barrier and rapidly approach, the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle was terrified.</p><p>Everyone reacted without hesitation, doing everything to rescue him.</p><p>At the critical moment, the Demon Suppressing Stele appeared again, combining with the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's true turtle shell to block the fatal blow.</p><p>'Crack!'</p><p>The Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's heart pounded. He retracted his shell, saw the glaring finger-sized hole, and his face turned pale.  The shell had been painstakingly refined day and night; its defensive power surpassed even cultivators' magical treasures, yet it had been pierced by a demonic claw.</p><p>Four masters attacking Mo Qingzhu could still not stop him, nearly causing the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle's death.</p><p>At this moment, everyone truly recognized Mo Qingzhu's strength.</p><p>"Go deal with Gu Mo's fragmented soul!"</p><p>Seeing this, Nan Gui Xianzi could only transmit a message to the Nine-Lives Xuan Turtle, altering their strategy.</p>
