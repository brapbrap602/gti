<h1>Chapter 1392  The Falling Phoenix Jade</h1><p>Chapter 1392  The Falling Phoenix Jade</p><p>“I’m still completely bewildered. You all keep talking about a conflict between two races, yet we inexplicably fought a great妖王, and inexplicably, a Xuan Tian Palace traitor and a Xuan Tian Palace treasure appeared.  Exactly how much do you know? Shouldn’t you explain and clear up my confusion?”</p><p>Qin Sang waved to stop the Island Master Shen, looked at Master Feng, and coldly asked.</p><p>Several exchanged glances.</p><p>Master Feng produced a prepared explanation, “We only recently learned of the妖族’s conspiracy and haven’t had a chance to tell you…”</p><p>Qin Sang, having received the biggest benefit, was merely posturing, expressing his displeasure, not intending to press the matter. After hearing Master Feng’s explanation, his expression softened slightly.</p><p>“This person was first pursued by Xuan Tian Palace, escaped into the妖 realm, and was then pursued by the Rainbow Rat here… What treasure did he bring out from Xuan Tian Palace?”</p><p>Island Master Shen shook his head. “I couldn’t overhear specific information. The Rainbow Rat probably didn’t know the details either, only that Xuan Tian Palace placed immense value on this object, sending several elders to pursue it deep into the妖 realm, nearly alarming the Great Sage Tian Peng before giving up.”</p><p>Great Sage Tian Peng.</p><p>A late-stage transformed being, emulating the glorious name of an ancient妖族 great sage, he is known as the Great Sage and has a fearsome reputation in the North Sea.</p><p>They hadn’t gotten any useful information.</p><p>Qin Sang thought to himself that he could only wait to open the ice box himself to find out what the treasure was.</p><p>At this moment, Madam Yue, who had been silent, suddenly spoke, “Since the treasure has fallen into the hands of the妖族, perhaps we should spread the news…”</p><p>“To use a knife to kill someone!”</p><p>Island Master Shen clapped his hands together.  “Shen has the same intention! Let’s see if they can hold onto the treasure!”</p><p>Master Feng hesitated, “I hear that Xuan Tian Palace is always domineering. I’m afraid that spreading the news will cause trouble for more than just them. A Xuan Tian Palace treasure appearing nearby, and all of us having participated in the struggle for it… even if we declare that the treasure was taken by the 妖族, others may not believe us. We might attract too many people, causing us unrest and making things worse. The situation will become even more complicated…”</p><p>As the local overlord, he didn’t want to give others a reason to interfere.</p><p>Even someone as powerful as Master Feng had people and forces he feared.</p><p>The black-clad swordsman added, “I still have travels planned and don’t want to be constantly watched.”</p><p>Madam Yue nodded slightly. “My consideration was too simplistic.”</p><p>Master Feng shook his head. “Madam Yue’s suggestion is reasonable; we certainly can’t let Bi Fang get away with this.  The news can be released, but we must carefully consider it.”</p><p>Everyone agreed.</p><p>Next, they took out the ice boxes they had each obtained.</p><p>Including Qin Sang’s snow-patterned cold jade, the human side had a total of eight ice boxes.</p><p>They mostly contained various materials for refining artifacts, of varying value. There were no medicinal herbs, presumably consumed by the man in white during his escape.</p><p>Qin Sang immediately spotted a piece of red jade in one of the ice boxes.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>Qin Sang directly summoned the red jade into his hand and examined it carefully.</p><p>The inside of the red jade had wood-grain-like patterns.</p><p>Holding it, he felt a warmth.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang’s actions, Island Master Shen and the others frowned slightly.</p><p>Master Feng shook his head slightly, then looked at Qin Sang, “What?  Daoist friend, you have your eye on this Falling Phoenix Jade?”</p><p>“Daoist Feng recognizes this object?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked away and nodded, “I’m looking for suitable materials to enhance my artifact, and the Falling Phoenix Jade perfectly fits the requirements. I wonder if you would be willing to part with it?”</p><p>After a pause, Qin Sang took out the snow-patterned cold jade, “The Falling Phoenix Jade’s value is undoubtedly the highest among these items. I’m willing to give up this snow-patterned cold jade and only take the Falling Phoenix Jade.”</p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p>Master Feng said, “The snow-patterned cold jade was taken from Bi Fang by Daoist friend and should rightfully belong to you. Since you say so, Feng has no objections.”</p><p>Madam Yue said happily, “I’m about to refine an ice-attribute artifact and only need half of the snow-patterned cold jade. Thank you, Daoist friend Qin.”</p><p>…</p><p>Qin Sang took the Falling Phoenix Jade and stepped aside, watching Master Feng and the others divide the remaining items.</p><p>Everyone was happy.</p><p>Master Feng prepared to counterattack the 妖族.</p><p>Speed was essential. Island Master Shen and the others immediately went to make arrangements.</p><p>Soon, only Qin Sang and Master Feng remained in the hall.</p><p>Master Feng said apologetically, “I should have waited for the 妖族 to retreat before fulfilling my promise to take you to Hundred Flowers Valley. The situation has changed, and I’m afraid I won’t be free for a while. I can write a letter, and you can take it to visit the Valley Master of Hundred Flowers Valley.”</p><p>“Perhaps, Daoist friend, you could stay a while longer?  We can leave together once things have settled down here.”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, remaining silent.</p><p>Having heard that Feng Shangshi and the others planned to spread news of his presence, he decided to leave this precarious place as soon as possible.  He was outnumbered and outmatched. If Xuan Tian Gong or other powerful factions sent experts after him, he wouldn't stand a chance.</p><p>However, his visit to the Bai Hua Valley master wasn't just for an exchange of cultivation insights; he also hoped to learn their unique insect-controlling techniques. A simple letter wouldn't suffice to build a rapport.</p><p>After some thought, Qin Sang said, “Then I will wait a little longer. I have nothing pressing to do, and I can continue assisting Daoist friend Feng in guarding Hunting Dawn Island.  Should the opportunity arise to hunt down a Bi Fang or other demons, I would also like to take my revenge.”</p><p>Feng Shangshi was delighted.</p><p>Bidding farewell to Feng Shangshi, Qin Sang immediately flew back to Hunting Dawn Island.</p><p>As before, he left his Yuan Ying spirit puppet in his cave dwelling. He himself went to a nearby islet, set up a complex array of flags and layers of protective enchantments, before finally taking out the mysterious ice box.</p><p>“Such intricate seals… I wonder what treasure lies within…”</p><p>Qin Sang picked up the ice box and examined it closely.  The box was crystalline, but not transparent; the inside was a bright white.  He couldn't determine if the white light was the sealing power or emanated from the treasure itself. Even his Sky Eye Butterfly could only see a white glow, unable to discern the object within.</p><p>“嘶! The box seems to be made of ten-thousand-year-old glacial ice!”</p><p>Qin Sang was startled. Xuan Tian Gong truly spared no expense, using this rare material to create a container.  This discovery heightened his anticipation.</p><p>However, after an hour, Qin Sang was at a loss, feeling completely at a dead end. He examined the ice box repeatedly, mobilized his spiritual sense, and worked with his Sky Eye Butterfly to carefully analyze the seals.  Before he knew it, a whole day and night had passed.</p><p>Night fell on the second day.</p><p>Qin Sang, exhausted, meditated for a while before returning to the ice box. His expression turned grave.</p><p>“The seals are seamless, but that’s not the hardest part. Inside the box, there seems to be an extremely violent energy. I wonder if I’m mistaken…”</p><p>His thoughts raced. Qin Sang decided to try something; he placed the ice box on the ground.  Then, a gentle force emanated from his palm, slowly approaching the box.</p><p>Time seemed to slow. Qin Sang moved with extreme delicacy.</p><p>Finally, a faint light flickered on the surface of the ice box, and faint blue lines appeared in the ten-thousand-year-old glacial ice, revealing the sealing power.</p>
