<h1>## Chapter 402: The Lair</h1><p>The lineage and bloodlines of demonic beasts are incredibly complex. Not every demonic beast can shapeshift into human form during the Transformation stage. However, at the same realm, a demonic beast incapable of shapeshifting isn't necessarily weaker than one that can.</p><p>It's unknown whether the Thunder Swallow could shapeshift.  Facing two Nascent Soul cultivators simultaneously, even if it could, being forced to reveal its true form is not unusual.  Fighting one against two without falling behind, the Thunder Swallow was the strongest demonic beast Qin Sang had ever seen.</p><p>This battle was also the first time he had witnessed a fight between Nascent Soul Grandmasters.  The scene of the two black-robed figures breaking the restriction earlier paled in comparison to this.</p><p>Bluish-white waves churned within the sea of wind. The wind and clouds shifted, as if the heavens themselves were enraged.</p><p>Three figures flickered in and out of existence within this tempest. Qin Sang couldn't clearly see how they were fighting, only catching glimpses of their profound movements when the violent gusts momentarily revealed their forms.</p><p>One black-robed figure wielded a Black Tortoise Shell. The shell, like a shield, manifested the phantom of a gigantic Black Tortoise, only slightly smaller than the Thunder Swallow.  It let out a desolate roar, sprawling across the sky, its head raised in a furious glare at the Thunder Swallow.</p><p>With a casual swing of his hand, the Everlasting Sect Master unleashed thousand-foot-long sword beams that effortlessly tore through the wind, leaving rents that refused to close.</p><p>Qin Sang, filled with awe and captivated, was completely engrossed in the spectacle.</p><p>The Thunder Swallow was no less impressive than the two Nascent Soul cultivators, perhaps even surpassing them.  Its sharp cries were filled with warning and rage.  With a gape of its beak, it unleashed thunderbolts; a beat of its wings brought down storms of lightning.</p><p>The destructive aura of the raging thunder reached Qin Sang from afar, making his heart pound.</p><p>Every attack from these Nascent Soul Grandmasters drew upon the power of heaven and earth, unleashing unimaginable might. Even though the battle raged far in the sky, the residual force still caused the icy plains to tremble.</p><p>The previous tremors in the ice cave were a direct result of the impact of their clash.  Qin Sang had no doubt that if the battlefield were any closer, the ice cave would have been shattered.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang noticed something. The true objective of the Everlasting Sect Master and the mysterious black-robed figure seemed not to be killing the Thunder Swallow.</p><p>Their coordination was impeccable, their roles clearly defined. It was as if they had another purpose, constantly attempting to break through the Thunder Swallow's blockade. One would distract the Thunder Swallow while the other tried to bypass it, but each time, they were forced back, their efforts thwarted.</p><p>Possessing such formidable strength, the Thunder Swallow's intelligence was clearly exceptional.  Having discerned their intentions, it didn't initiate attacks, only repelling them before swiftly retreating to maintain its position, giving them no opportunity to exploit.</p><p>By now, Qin Sang could make some educated guesses.  The Thunder Swallow's strength might not necessarily surpass their combined power, but it was enraged and willing to fight to the death, while the two cultivators were clearly cautious, unwilling to risk mutual destruction.</p><p>This hesitation gave the Thunder Swallow the apparent upper hand.</p><p>What were the Everlasting Sect Master and the other cultivator searching for? Qin Sang recalled the scene he'd witnessed earlier: after the two had broken the ancient restriction together, one had descended to search, seemingly not finding what they sought, before departing.</p><p>What could make two Nascent Soul cultivators venture into the Boundless Valley, risking a battle with the Thunder Swallow?  A celestial herb?  Or an ancient treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, emerging from behind the ice, and stood at the edge of the ice cave, observing his surroundings. Due to the Frostwind, the spiritual energy in the area was incredibly chaotic. As long as Qin Sang remained concealed, even a Nascent Soul cultivator would struggle to detect him.</p><p>The ice cave he was in appeared to be within a massive iceberg. The entire mountain was riddled with similar ice caves, resembling a gigantic honeycomb. It was a peculiar geological formation.</p><p>Wind and snow poured into the caves, producing a mournful whistling sound.</p><p>At the foot of the iceberg lay a bottomless abyss, vast in its expanse. The sea of wind above pressed down low, forming a massive funnel connected to the abyss. At the center of the abyss churned a conspicuous white pillar of wind, condensed Frostwind spiraling upwards like a water dragon.</p><p>It seemed as though the deadly wind descended from the heavens. After observing for a while, Qin Sang realized the abyss was, in fact, the source of the Frostwind.</p><p>Endless gusts surged from the abyss, converging in the sky above.  Accumulated over countless millennia, as far as the eye could see, stretched the boundless Frostwind, a monotonous expanse of bluish-white.</p><p>Could the Thunder Swallow's lair be within the abyss? Qin Sang wondered.  It would explain everything.</p><p>The Nightbloom Lily grew so close to the Thunder Swallow's lair. Without a restrictive formation, once the lily matured, even the most chaotic spiritual energy could hardly mask the alluring aura of such a heavenly treasure.  The Thunder Swallow would have surely devoured it long ago.</p><p>No wonder the cultivator who discovered the Nightbloom Lily had been so cautious, not only utilizing a teleportation formation at great expense but also ensuring every restriction prioritized concealment.</p><p>Especially the formation protecting the Nightbloom Lily, it was exceptionally subtle, completely locking down the lily's aura, preventing any leakage.  Beyond this, there were no other superfluous measures, lest they backfire and alert the Thunder Swallow.</p><p>The Everlasting Sect Master and the other cultivator's objective seemed to be the abyss.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted back and forth between the abyss and the sky above. His fists clenched, his expression flickering with indecision.  He was torn.</p><p>The battle between the two cultivators and the beast was at a stalemate.  While Qin Sang couldn't discern the true strength of Nascent Soul cultivators, from outward appearances, it seemed unlikely a victor would emerge any time soon.</p><p>However, this didn't guarantee him an opportunity to act.</p><p>The abyss, being the source of the Frostwind, was undoubtedly incredibly dangerous. It appeared the condensed Frostwind only occupied the central region of the abyss, but the entire chasm was inevitably affected, filled with even more terrifyingly cold winds.</p><p>While Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the cold侵蚀ing his soul, his physical body was fragile.  So close to the Frostwind, whether the Crimson Elixir would be effective remained uncertain.</p><p>Even more daunting were the three Nascent Soul Grandmasters in the sky.</p><p>The situation could change at any moment.  Whether the Everlasting Sect Master and the other cultivator found an opportunity to break through the Thunder Swallow's blockade and enter the abyss, or if they decided to retreat, with the Thunder Swallow returning to its lair, Qin Sang would be trapped in a perilous situation.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, but this wasn't a particularly difficult decision.  The two cultivators' fighting spirit seemed weak, as if they might withdraw at any moment. It was their apparent lack of commitment that prevented Qin Sang from acting impulsively.</p><p>This was a so-called opportunity that could cost him his life, one where he didn't even have a 50% chance of success.</p><p>And the potential rewards were unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly made his decision.  He would remain in the ice cave, observe the battle of the Nascent Soul Grandmasters, and gain valuable experience.  That alone was already a significant reward.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang resolved to stay put, the situation changed once again.</p><p>Chapter 402 The Lair</p><p>The origins and bloodlines of demonic beasts are incredibly complex.

Having discerned the duo's intentions, it didn't actively attack.

The Thunder Swallow's strength might not surpass their combined power, but it was enraged and willing to fight to the death. The two Nascent Soul cultivators, however, were clearly cautious, unwilling to suffer even mutual destruction.</p><p>Because of this, their hesitation made it appear as if the Thunder Swallow had the upper hand.</p><p>What were they searching for?</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the earlier scene where the two had combined their strength to break the ancient restriction. One had gone down to search, seemingly failing to find what they sought, before they both departed.</p><p>What could make two Nascent Soul cultivators venture into the Boundless Valley, risking a battle with the Thunder Swallow?  Was it a celestial herb or an ancient treasure?</p><p>Qin Sang withdrew his gaze, emerging from behind the ice, standing at the edge of the cave, observing his surroundings. Due to the Profound Frost Wind, the spiritual energy in this area was incredibly chaotic. As long as Qin Sang remained concealed, even Nascent Soul cultivators would struggle to detect him.</p><p>The ice cave he occupied seemed to be located within an ice mountain. The entire mountain was riddled with similar ice caves, resembling a gigantic honeycomb. It was unclear how such a peculiar landform had come to be.</p><p>Wind and snow poured into the caves, producing a mournful whistling sound.</p><p>At the foot of the ice mountain, there was a bottomless chasm, vast in its scope. The wind-sea above pressed low, forming an enormous funnel connecting to the chasm. At the chasm's center, a striking white pillar of wind – concentrated Profound Frost Wind – spiraled upwards like a rising dragon.</p><p>It appeared as if the wind descended from the heavens.</p><p>After careful observation, Qin Sang realized that the chasm was actually the source of the Profound Frost Wind.</p><p>Endless gusts of wind surged from the chasm, converging high in the sky. Accumulated over countless millennia, as far as the eye could see, stretched the boundless Profound Frost Wind, a monotonous expanse of bluish-white.</p><p>Could the Thunder Swallow's lair be within that chasm?  Qin Sang thought to himself, suddenly understanding.</p><p>The Nightbloom Lily's growing location was so close to the Thunder Swallow's lair that, without a restrictive formation, when the lily matured, even the chaotic spiritual energy couldn't mask the alluring aura of a heavenly treasure.  The lily would have long since been devoured by the Thunder Swallow.</p><p>No wonder the predecessor who discovered the Nightbloom Lily had been so meticulous, not only utilizing a teleportation formation at great cost but also ensuring the primary function of each restriction was concealment.  The formation protecting the lily was particularly subtle, tightly sealing its aura, preventing even the slightest leakage.  Beyond this, there were no other superfluous measures, lest they backfire and alert the Thunder Swallow.</p><p>The duo's objective seemed to be that chasm.</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze shifted between the chasm and the sky. His fists clenched, his expression shifting. He was torn by hesitation and conflict.</p><p>Currently, the battle between the two humans and the beast was at a stalemate.</p><p>While Qin Sang couldn't ascertain the true strength of the Nascent Soul cultivators, he could tell from appearances that a decisive outcome was unlikely in the short term.</p><p>However, this didn't mean he had a window of opportunity.  The chasm, being the source of the Profound Frost Wind, was undoubtedly extremely dangerous.  It appeared that the concentrated Profound Frost Wind only occupied a central area of the chasm, but the entire abyss was undoubtedly affected, filled with winds even more terrifying than those outside.</p><p>While Qin Sang wasn't afraid of the cold penetrating his spirit, his physical body was fragile. So close to the source of the Profound Frost Wind, whether his Crimson Elixir could protect him remained uncertain.</p><p>Even more frightening were the three Nascent Soul Grandmasters above.</p><p>The situation could change at any moment.  Whether the two found an opportunity to break through the Thunder Swallow's blockade and enter the chasm, or they decided to retreat and the Thunder Swallow returned to its lair, Qin Sang would be trapped in a perilous situation.</p><p>Qin Sang hesitated, but the choice wasn't particularly difficult.  The two Nascent Soul cultivators seemed less than determined, likely to withdraw at any time.  It was their attitude that deterred Qin Sang's impulsiveness.</p><p>This was a so-called opportunity that could cost him his life at any second, and Qin Sang didn't even have half a chance of success.  The potential reward was unknown.</p><p>Qin Sang quickly made up his mind.  Staying put in the ice cave and observing the battle of Nascent Soul Grandmasters was already a significant gain.  He had learned much.</p><p>Unexpectedly, just as Qin Sang resolved to remain where he was, the situation changed again.</p>
