Chapter 382: Jungle and Sea of Flowers


Just then, the two Nascent Soul cultivators seemed to have finished their discussion.


They moved to either side of the mountain wall, standing facing each other, simultaneously raising their hands.  Boundless spiritual energy surged forth, converging between them.


Gradually, this spiritual energy formed a crystalline sphere, then expanded at a visible rate.


Qin Sang couldn't sense the sphere's aura, but he could see the immense spiritual energy contained within.  If it were him, he wouldn't even be able to support the sphere's creation; his energy sea would be instantly drained.


Yet the two Nascent Soul cultivators remained at ease, the sphere rapidly expanding without stopping.


The vast difference in strength between him and the Nascent Soul cultivators was evident.


In the blink of an eye, the sphere expanded to its limit, then began to deform, stretching vertically, finally transforming into a gigantic luminous sword. Then it collapsed inward, ultimately compressing into a sword only a person's height tall, its light subdued, appearing almost solid.


The sword hung upside down, point downwards, suddenly disappearing from view.


The next moment, Qin Sang felt the ground tremble slightly.


Immediately after, from the cleft between the two mountains, endless rays of brilliant light erupted, shooting towards the two Nascent Soul cultivators in the air.


Surprisingly, even the Nascent Soul cultivators had to dodge and weave to avoid these rays.


However, more and more rays appeared, seemingly alive, and no matter how they dodged, they clung to them with unusual agility, like a clinging curse.


At that moment, one of the Nascent Soul cultivators, unable to avoid it, had half his robe torn away by the rays.  Seeming enraged by the entanglement, he suddenly opened his hand, and a black disc shot out from his palm.


The object spun rapidly, growing larger in the wind.


Qin Sang and Yun Youzi then saw clearly that it was a tortoise shell.


The shell was dark black, with strangely mysterious patterns etched upon it. Because they were too far away, they couldn't distinguish whether the shell was a magic treasure or some kind of strange artifact.


Seeing this, the other Nascent Soul cultivator shook his head, not joining the fray. Instead, he leaped to the other's side, drawing all the rays of light towards himself.


The tortoise shell hung in mid-air, emitting a dark glow, covering the rays of light. The rays resisted, but steadily retreated, eventually being suppressed and disappearing without a trace.


Even just watching this silent battle, Qin Sang's heart was stirred with tension. The fact that a Nascent Soul cultivator could easily extinguish those seemingly powerful rays with a tortoise shell left him awestruck.


The rays vanished.


The Nascent Soul cultivator put away the tortoise shell, while the other person darted downwards.


After a short while, this person returned, apparently having obtained some treasure from within. The two seemed to exchange a few words, then headed towards the depths of the Wuyagu Valley, disappearing into the distance.


An hour later.


After confirming that the two Nascent Soul cultivators were long gone, Qin Sang and Yun Youzi dared to emerge from the hillside.


"Senior, did you recognize the identities of those two Nascent Soul cultivators?" Qin Sang asked, looking sideways.


It was unclear whether the two Nascent Soul cultivators were deliberately concealing their identities; not only were they completely shrouded in black robes, but they also didn't use any incantations during the breaking of the seal. Only when one of them was irritated by the rays did he use the tortoise shell, perhaps providing a clue for speculation.


Yun Youzi shook his head with a wry smile.


"Qin, you think too highly of this old Daoist. With my meager cultivation, I can only hear some hearsay; how could I possibly know the secrets of the Nascent Soul realm?


"However, in our Little Cold Region, the true Nascent Soul experts are few and far between, and it is said that their relationships are not harmonious.  I wonder what kind of treasure could make two Nascent Soul cultivators join forces...


"Forget it, these matters are none of our concern, nor are they something we can fathom. Fortunately, the route taken by those two Nascent Soul cultivators is opposite to ours. Let's continue on our journey."


Qin Sang nodded, glanced back, and followed Yun Youzi, his mind still replaying the battle.


Because of the numerous dangers and their weak strength, their speed was not fast.


Thus, another half-day passed.


Rounding a mountain stream, Yun Youzi saw the scenery ahead and his face lit up with joy. He stopped, "Qin, this is the place."


Before them appeared a small, dense forest, a rare sight in the fragmented inner valley.


Qin Sang's taut nerves relaxed slightly, as he gazed intently.


The forest contained only a few towering trees, mostly consisting of waist-high bushes, allowing a clear view to the end. It was unusually quiet, without even the sound of insects, as if no living creature inhabited it.


This place is actually a breathtaking illusion, but if you can't find a way to break it, then it's all too real!

Yun Youzi said with great admiration, striding forward, moving easily through the jungle, without avoiding contact with the plants.

An illusion?

Qin Sang was greatly surprised, snapping off a branch.  A milky white sap flowed out, emitting a fresh herbal scent â€“ completely real!

Yun Youzi stopped in the middle of the jungle, his gaze shifting, seemingly searching for something.

After a moment, Yun Youzi's eyes fixed. He went to an ancient tree, crouching down to look at an inconspicuous little plant growing at its base.

He raised his hand, placing it over the plant, and channeled his spiritual energy into it.

The next moment, the jungle vanished, and the scenery changed dramatically!

...

A mountain, split in two, formed a valley.

The fracture was smooth as a mirror, making one wonder if the mountain had been cleaved in two by a single blow.

Countless flowers bloomed in the valley.

These flowers, varying in color and shape, were all in full bloom at the same time, forming a sea of flowers dancing in the gentle breeze.

A person in grey robes and a straw hat was walking through the flower sea.

Instead of appreciating the beauty of the vibrant flowers, the person in grey robes looked extremely serious, as if the flower sea concealed a man-eating beast.

Even when pollen was shaken loose from the flowers colliding, he would quickly dodge, avoiding any contact with it.

This person, who seemed to have spent a considerable amount of time in the flower sea and possessed extensive knowledge of the flowers, moved with practiced ease, expertly navigating the blooms.

Suddenly, the person in grey robes unknowingly touched something. A flower beside him transformed into a ferocious ghost, opening its bloody maw and snapping its sharp fangs.

The robed figure reacted swiftly, instantly leaping back. While retreating, he sent out waves of spiritual energy.

This energy did not harm the relentless ghost but gently subdued it, calming it until the ghost's eyes glazed over and it reverted to its flower form.

Having skillfully resolved the crisis, the grey-robed person was about to continue when he seemed to sense something. He looked up, staring at the multicolored sky in the distance.

Surprise flickered across his face.

After a moment's thought, the person transformed into a wisp of green smoke, darting out of the flower sea and disappearing into the depths of the intricate barriers.

Only a whispered word of surprise lingered, slowly fading away.

"Heart-eating insect?"
