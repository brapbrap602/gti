<h1>Chapter 2130: The Sage</h1><p>Qingyang Temple.</p><p>The Thunder Altar activated.</p><p>Thunder erupted, the earth quaked, and mountains swayed.  Even Qingyang Temple's protective formation could no longer contain the radiant lightning, which pierced through the formation's veil and soared into the heavens.</p><p>Across the surrounding mountains, plains, and wilderness, countless living beings were gripped by fear, staring blankly at Qingyang Temple. The dazzling lightning stung their eyes. They could only see a colossal pillar of lightning, thicker than a mountain, connecting heaven and earth, anchored below by a magnificent Thunder Altar.</p><p>The lightning pillar reached the Ninth Heaven, its power immeasurable.</p><p>Chaos reigned under heaven!</p><p>Birds, beasts, fish, insects, humans, demons, and cultivators—in the face of this apocalyptic thunderous might, all living beings couldn't suppress the terror in their hearts. They wailed in despair, some even dying on the spot from sheer fright.</p><p>The thunder's might continued to escalate.</p><p>Creatures in the Northern Wastelands, the Middle Continent, and even farther regions felt this terrifying power, comparable to the might of heaven and earth itself. Their minds were unsettled, consumed by a deep unease.</p><p>All beings trembled in fear!</p><p>In the distant outer realms, almost simultaneously, three more pillars of lightning erupted, emanating from the Northern Sea, the far west of the Middle Continent, and the Canglang Sea—the three core branch altars, resonating with the main altar.</p><p>Su Nu and the other two presided over the branch altars. The pressure they bore was second only to Qin Sang's, and they dared not relax for a moment.</p><p>This Thunder Altar possessed far greater power than before, placing even more stringent demands on those at the main altar.  Qin Sang kept the Celestial Eye Butterfly by his side to share the burden, allowing him the freedom to act on the battlefield.</p><p>Standing atop the altar, Su Nu's face was taut.  With precise steps, she meticulously performed the incantations Qin Sang had taught her.</p><p>*Hum!*</p><p>The altar vibrated intensely.</p><p>Previously, to avoid their core branch altars being discovered by the enemy, they had kept them concealed.  Fortunately, they had only been using Third-Order Thunder Talismans, which they could manage with ease.</p><p>Now, they had to give their all.  The altar could no longer remain hidden.  A phantom altar materialized in the void, its structure and size second only to the main altar.</p><p>Similar scenes unfolded in the other two realms.</p><p>With the appearance of the three lightning pillars, from the four corners of the Northern Sea to the Middle Continent, and even to the Eastern Sea, the Canglang Sea, and the Demon Sea, the altar formation began to manifest. All altar masters, following orders, exerted their full power. One after another, bolts of lightning erupted in an instant.</p><p>Countless altars, countless lightning bolts, some clustered, some scattered, appeared mostly at renowned sects and sacred mountains, all centered around the three branch altars and the main altar. Like a myriad of thunder swords, they pierced the sky, standing between heaven and earth, transforming the Storm Realm into a forest of lightning swords.</p><p>The world's spiritual energy surged. In an instant, dark clouds gathered, thunder rumbled, and lightning roared across the sky of the Storm Realm. This entire territory was enveloped by heavenly might, undergoing a baptism of divine lightning.</p><p>Above the dark clouds, boundless lightning stretched endlessly.  Countless thunderbolts were born from nothingness, dancing wildly across the firmament.</p><p>At this moment, the Storm Realm seemed to be divided into four great thunder domains, each vast and boundless, possessing the terrifying power to overturn heaven and earth, easily annihilating billions of lives.</p><p>Lightning surged, converging from all directions, from the distant horizon.  Immense thunderous might gathered in the sky.</p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p>The moment Qin Sang shattered the Void Severing Pagoda, Grand Preceptor felt a surge of foreboding. Without hesitation, he activated his Shifting Art. As expected, it felt as though a barrier had appeared, severing the connection between him and the Nine-Colored Deer, restricting his divine abilities!</p><p>Grand Preceptor's expression changed drastically. He felt a deep sense of unease.  He immediately sent a warning message and ordered Lu Gan to activate the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram to rescue them.</p><p>He didn't know what the enemy was relying on to dare cut off his escape route.  Something so unusual must have a hidden motive.  Since the enemy had revealed this trump card, they must have a plan.</p><p>Regardless, retreat was the best strategy!</p><p>At that moment, within the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram, Lu Gan, Lu Wang, and Shao Shi were all stunned by the celestial phenomena above the Western Lands.</p><p>Outside, dark clouds churned. Azure lightning illuminated the Ninth Heaven. Endless thunder transformed into a tide of lightning, roaring towards them.</p><p>Even from afar, and within the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram, they felt a sense of suffocation facing the tide of lightning.  The pressure sent chills down their spines.</p><p>"Save them!"</p><p>Lu Wang, sensing impending doom, roared.</p><p>The lightning tide possessed such power even before it arrived.  Once it reached the army, the consequences would be unimaginable. Grand Preceptor, always cautious, hadn't retreated yet. The Nine-Colored Deer lay motionless on the ground, clearly having encountered some mishap.</p><p>Lu Gan, a veteran of countless battles, also recognized this.  When Lu Wang gave the order, he fully activated the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram, receiving Grand Preceptor's warning almost simultaneously.</p><p>The mountains resonated, and eight clear pools appeared.</p><p>In the next moment, a faint golden light appeared above the heads of Grand Preceptor and the other Void Realm Second Stage cultivators.</p><p>Within the golden light, the shadow of a scroll faintly materialized. Just then, thunder roared. Above the Storm Realm, amidst the boundless lightning, a sphere of pure azure lightning was born.</p><p>As the azure lightning appeared, the surrounding lightning paled in comparison, as if all its power had been devoured. Within the azure lightning, a 'lightning paper' floated—the Thunder Summoning Decree!</p><p>In an instant, the Thunder Summoning Decree traversed the vast distance, descending upon the battlefield, fluttering down.</p><p>The Thunder Summoning Decree didn't fall directly onto the battlefield but appeared between the battlefield and the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram.</p><p>*Boom!*</p><p>The void trembled inexplicably.</p><p>The Thunder Summoning Decree paused momentarily. Heavenly might reigned supreme, and lightning illuminated the land.</p><p>The expressions of Grand Preceptor and the others turned ghastly. Just as the scroll was about to fully materialize, it suddenly disintegrated, and the golden light vanished completely. Hope, briefly granted, was snatched away!</p><p>The Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram trembled violently.  The earth cracked, mountains crumbled, rivers reversed their flow—a scene of utter devastation.</p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p>Lu Gan coughed up blood, his face ashen.  He seemed to have suffered a terrible blow, sent flying on the spot.</p><p>Seven of the nine clear pools collapsed instantly. The two that survived were also cracked, their waters dried up.</p><p>Lu Gan fell down a cliff, severely injured. He stared at the lightning paper in the air, his face filled with horror.</p><p>The Thunder Summoning Decree, having suppressed the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram, paused briefly before continuing its descent, carrying with it the might of thunder.</p><p>On the battlefield, everyone, including Grand Preceptor, was consumed by deep fear.</p><p>The Void Severing Pagoda could only cover a limited area. Qin Sang, activating this treasure, had targeted Grand Preceptor. Not all Void Realm Second Stage cultivators' escape routes were cut off. Only Grand Preceptor and those closest to him had their divine abilities sealed.</p><p>As the saying goes, when disaster strikes, each person fends for themselves.  Some, realizing their divine abilities were still intact, didn't hesitate to use their Shifting Art, teleporting away from the battlefield.</p><p>Others weren't so lucky, including Li Yue.</p><p>He wasn't Lu Wang's confidant but had been lured here by a generous reward.  Dying here was truly unjust.</p><p>With the Yan Shan Si Clan in ruins and awaiting restoration, if possible, Qin Sang would have preferred to leave him for Si Lu. But he had to kill Grand Preceptor and couldn't afford to show mercy at this moment.  Li Yue and the others could only blame their ill fortune.</p><p>Suppressed by heavenly might, everything seemed frozen in time. The battlefield fell into an eerie silence. The only things that moved were the boundless azure lightning and that light, 'azure lightning paper.'</p><p>A single thin sheet of paper seemed to carry the weight of celestial law, suppressing the world!</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>With a desperate cry, one of Lu Wang's confidants, a Void Realm Second Stage Initial Stage cultivator, finally succumbed to the pressure of the thunderous might. His body cracked, lightning coursed through him, and he exploded.</p><p>In his final moments, three streaks of light escaped—his three companion beasts.  In the next instant, they transformed into three spherical lightning bolts and vanished.</p><p>A peak Void Refinement expert had fallen!</p><p>At this moment, Grand Preceptor was the only one left with the strength to resist. Even Li Yue had no chance of survival.</p><p>Fear?</p><p>Regret?</p><p>...</p><p>In this critical moment, Grand Preceptor couldn't afford such useless thoughts.  His only thought was to find any way to grasp a sliver of hope!</p><p>He tried to recall the Heaven Trapping Golden Chains, but they were entangled with the Five Thunders Heavenly Heart Seal, and even the power of his Void Domain likely couldn't withstand this Thunder Talisman.</p><p>Grand Preceptor hastily retrieved a black dou, filled with silver sand.  He overturned the dou, and the silver sand poured out.  The earth began to warp and undulate, countless stones protruding from the ground.</p><p>The stones shifted, transforming into winged celestial horses, majestic and imposing.</p><p>The celestial horses spread their wings and soared into the sky, fearlessly charging towards the Thunder Summoning Decree. The vast herd obscured the sky, carrying Grand Preceptor's last hope.</p><p>Grand Preceptor didn't have time to look up.  He desperately activated the treasure bottle in his hand.  The cross-shaped light beams spun rapidly, attempting to create an opening in the Void Severing Pagoda's power.</p><p>Azure lightning danced among the celestial horses, annihilating a large swathe with each strike.</p><p>A massive hole appeared in the herd, revealing the Thunder Summoning Decree, its divine might irresistible!</p><p>Grand Preceptor abruptly looked up, his pupils constricting before being swallowed by the lightning!</p><p>Within the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram.</p><p>The cultivators who had managed to escape were still shaken, their faces filled with terror.  Lu Wang's face was as dark as water because Grand Preceptor hadn't returned!</p><p>Just then, the Nine-Colored Deer finally stirred, leaping to its feet, its form twisting, its features seemingly shifting towards Grand Preceptor's.</p><p>A flicker of joy appeared on Lu Wang's face, then froze.  Lightning erupted from within the Nine-Colored Deer, tearing it apart before their eyes.</p><p>Shao Shi, Lu Wang, and every Si You Clan cultivator who witnessed this felt a chill run down their spines!</p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the spot where Grand Preceptor had been, sensing his aura rapidly fading.</p><p>To ensure complete success, he also summoned the Five Elements Crown, unleashing a beam of five-elemental divine light, which was clearly overkill.</p><p>This attack was even more powerful than he had anticipated.</p><p>It wasn't just because of the Thunder Altar and the Fourth-Order Thunder Talisman, but also the Azure Phoenix True Lightning.  The Fourth-Order Thunder Talisman needed the Azure Phoenix True Lightning as a medium, and conversely, only a Thunder Talisman of this rank could unleash the true power of the Azure Phoenix True Lightning.  The two complemented each other, instantly annihilating a late Void Refinement expert!</p><p>Moreover, the thunder's might hadn't been exhausted yet!</p><p>Qin Sang controlled the Thunder Summoning Decree, sending it flying towards the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram.</p><p>Lu Wang, Shao Shi, and the others could all see Qin Sang and the slightly fading, yet still potent, Thunder Summoning Decree.</p><p>At the same time, Qin Sang's voice rang out clearly.</p><p>"Shao Shi, do you still wish to oppose me?"</p><p>Do you still wish to oppose me?</p><p>His voice radiated immense confidence.</p><p>"Lord Shao Shi..."</p><p>Lu Wang's expression shifted slightly.  Before he could finish, he saw Shao Shi flash through the crowd.  He immediately realized what was happening and shrieked, "Stop him!"</p><p>But with Grand Preceptor dead and Lu Gan severely injured, even Lu Wang himself couldn't stop Shao Shi.</p><p>Shao Shi was also deeply shocked, awed by the power of the Thunder Talisman.</p><p>In truth, the Earthly Yellow Scroll wasn't the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram's strongest ability. The Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram was a treasure passed down through generations of the royal family. How could it only possess the ability to rescue people?</p><p>This treasure was also a powerful weapon on the battlefield.  Shao Shi had originally planned to reveal this gradually to Lu Gan, depending on how the battle progressed.</p><p>The problem was, even if he unleashed these abilities, could they withstand that 'azure lightning paper' on the other side?</p><p>Shao Shi truly lacked confidence.  Moreover, who knew how many more times the enemy could unleash such an attack?</p><p>Qin Sang's words were profound, and Shao Shi naturally understood their meaning.</p><p>As long as Si Lu still wanted to return to the Si You Clan and restore the Yan Shan Si Clan, he couldn't become mortal enemies with the royal family!</p><p>But if he didn't join forces with Lu Wang now and fully control the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram, if Qin Sang turned on him, his fate wouldn't be pleasant either.</p><p>The dignified Royal Tutor, having to gamble on the other party's mercy, when had he fallen to such a state?</p><p>Shao Shi smiled bitterly, but his mind was made up. He said coldly, "Lu Wang, you're on your own!"</p><p>Simultaneously, he shouted, "The Yan Shan Si Clan and the royal family share the same Si Clan bloodline.  The Si Emperor never believed Lu Clan's slander and sent people to protect the remnants of the Yan Shan. This old man has witnessed with his own eyes Lu Clan's arrogance and self-destruction.  The Yan Shan Si Clan is innocent. We shall await Young Master Si Lu's return!"</p><p>Shao Shi appeared above the clear pool.  Lu Gan, severely injured, couldn't stop him.  Control of the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram was easily seized.</p><p>A wisp of golden light rose from the bottom of the clear pool and was grasped by Shao Shi.</p><p>The land began to lose its color.</p><p>Since Lu Wang's army had invaded the Western Lands, the desert had transformed into fertile land. Now, although it didn't revert back to desert, its spiritual energy and vitality were being rapidly drained.  This place had already been ravaged by the Thunder Summoning Decree, and now it was returning to a desolate wasteland.</p><p>In Shao Shi's palm, the golden light intensified, and a treasure map appeared, its light dim, its power clearly diminished.</p><p>This time, the losses outweighed the gains.</p><p>Shao Shi, ignoring his heartache, used the power of the treasure map to protect himself, cautiously flying towards the border of the Western Lands.</p><p>Qin Sang looked down from above, his eyes filled with killing intent.  The Thunder Summoning Decree completely transformed into lightning, sweeping across heaven and earth with unstoppable force.</p><p>Others could be captured, but Lu Wang and his confidant, Lu Gan, had to die.</p><p>Who could have predicted that such a favorable situation would reverse so quickly and completely? Lu Wang and the others hadn't even considered leaving a companion beast outside the Eight Extremes Shifting Diagram.</p><p>Now, there was no escape!</p><p>With the rumble of thunder behind him, Shao Shi glanced back and saw the azure lightning blotting out the sky, but it wasn't coming for him.  He couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, then heard Qin Sang's reply.</p><p>"Convey my greetings, and those of Fellow Daoist Si Lu, to the Si Emperor!"</p><p>...</p><p>The Storm Realm.</p><p>Above all the branch altars, lightning filled the sky, displaying the same image, reflecting the events unfolding on the battlefield.</p><p>At the three core branch altars, Su Nu and the other two finally witnessed the true power of the Thunder Altar, their hearts filled with awe.</p><p>The other cultivators were even more astonished.</p><p>They finally knew what the enemy looked like and who was protecting the Storm Realm, leading them to victory against powerful foes.</p><p>There was a Daoist, commanding myriad thunderbolts, invincible and unstoppable, making the enemy tremble and flee in defeat!</p><p>This scene was deeply etched in their memories, never to be forgotten.</p><p>At this moment, regardless of race or sect, the cultivators showed genuine reverence.</p><p>Some bowed to the Daoist's back, hailing him as Grand True Man.</p><p>But more voices called him—Sage!</p>
