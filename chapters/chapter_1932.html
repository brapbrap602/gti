<h1>Chapter 1923: The Spirit Talisman</h1><p>The three girls' mother, after drinking the elixir and recovering her strength, joined them in their work.  </p><p>She was busier than her daughters.</p><p>First, she removed the weeds stuffed into her daughters' clothes, revealing their bodies. Then she fetched water to wash the dirt from their faces and necks, tidied their hair, brushed the dust from their clothes, making them as clean as possible.</p><p>"Back home, we were always clean, never this ragged.  The world is so chaotic, I could only do this, only this... even if my little girls love cleanliness, there's nothing I can do.  I'm useless, I'm sorry, I brought you into this world but can't protect you..."</p><p>Her mutterings were like explanations to someone, and as she spoke, she began to cry.</p><p>The three girls were all quite pretty and clever. Without their mother needing to say anything, they understood her intentions, their eyes red as they worked, showcasing their efficiency and diligence.</p><p>Ordinary people couldn't see the Earth God; to them, only Qin Sang stood there.</p><p>The Earth God, calming himself, didn't refuse. He held his jade pendant tightly; a flash of white light enveloped him, revealing his form, though only the mother and daughters could see him.</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The three girls and their mother were startled to suddenly see a little old man beside Qin Sang.</p><p>However, considering Qin Sang was a celestial being, another celestial being appearing wasn't so strange.</p><p>The Earth God, seeing through the mother's thoughts, coughed and said, "Don't harbor such ideas. The Daoist is an unparalleled immortal, with vast powers, and has seen countless outstanding people. To meet the Daoist and be reborn is a blessing from your ancestors; you should be content."</p><p>The mother's thoughts were exposed, and she felt ashamed, whispering, "My three daughters are obedient and sensible, know how to serve others, and are quick with their hands.  I see the little celestial being has no maidservant; it would be good if one could be chosen..."</p><p>The Earth God sighed, unable to blame her for her wishful thinking.  Who among ordinary people, upon seeing a celestial being, could resist seeking a celestial connection?</p><p>Among these people, countless others harbored the same thoughts as this mother.</p><p>"Fate is predetermined.  To vainly seek a celestial connection invites misfortune."</p><p>The Earth God, feeling moved to speak, gave a warning, tapping his earth-measuring staff.  "I am the local Earth God. Due to the great unrest in the land, there has been a long absence of offerings, and my temple has been abandoned for a long time.  Seeing your motherly nature is simple and observing your speech reveals you are educated, I wish to re-establish my deity, requiring someone to manage the mundane affairs of the temple. Will you be my temple's priestesses?"</p><p>"Yes! Of course, yes! Let us pay our respects to Grandfather Earth God!"</p><p>The mother was overjoyed, immediately wanting to kneel with her daughters, but the Earth God stopped her.</p><p>"After you assist the Daoist in distributing the elixir, take this stone tablet and find a place to live in Duchiguo. The tablet is imbued with divine power and will protect you. When the tablet grows warm, it will guide you to the temple..."</p><p>The Earth God produced a palm-sized grey stone tablet, carved with his lifelike image.</p><p>Having just obtained the jade pendant, he felt a heavy responsibility and needed to think carefully, understand the situation, before considering rebuilding the temple.</p><p>More disaster victims arrived in succession, and Qin Sang and Xiao Wu stayed for three days.</p><p>Many who drank the elixir were reluctant to leave, but seeing there were no further benefits and that the celestial being had no intention of taking disciples, they finally set off for Duchiguo.</p><p>Three days later, in the evening.</p><p>The figures on the dirt road became sparse.</p><p>Xiao Wu and the three girls had some free time and squatted by the stove, looking at the stars, occasionally adding firewood to the fire.</p><p>"Little celestial being sister, look, that star is so bright!"</p><p>The youngest girl, whose milk name was Yin'er, pointed to a star in the sky and said crisply.</p><p>The two older girls were more sensible and treated Xiao Wu with a degree of awe, always cautious, while Yin'er and Xiao Wu were the closest.</p><p>Qin Sang had cast an illusion on Xiao Wu, and after three days together, they hadn't discovered that she was blind.</p><p>The spectacle of three moons shining together ended in the latter half of that night; the blood moon and dark moon disappeared, leaving only one bright moon hanging high in the sky.</p><p>"Mother and father said that star is the Yue Lao star. If you worship the Yue Lao star, Yue Lao will give us a good husband."</p><p>Yin'er, though young, knew quite a lot, a shy expression on her small face, suddenly asked, "Little celestial being sister, will you marry someday?"</p><p>"Marry?"</p><p>Xiao Wu hesitated. She had heard and seen so many stories and understood the meaning of marriage, but she had never considered it herself.</p><p>“No,” she shook her head slightly.  “Why get married?”</p><p>“Can immortals not marry?”</p><p>Yin’er sighed for Xiao Wu. “Mother says that getting married provides support, someone to protect us like Father.”</p><p>Xiao Wu shook her head. “I don’t need anyone’s protection. My master will protect me.”</p><p>For three days, Yin’er’s father had spoken little, remaining silent, constantly gathering and carrying firewood, a way to numb himself. His wife didn’t speak to him either.</p><p>‘Slap!’</p><p>Hearing Yin’er’s words, their father, hidden behind the woodpile, slapped himself hard, then buried his face in his hands.</p><p>Their mother heard his muffled sobs.  Her expression was complex. She went over and embraced her husband, and they wept together.</p><p>The flames in the stove crackled.  Their daughters noticed nothing unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang sat on the ground nearby.</p><p>The land deity, while Qin Sang was still present, busied himself subduing the demons.</p><p>Some demons were unruly, so the land deity activated his jade pendant, making them suffer until they learned their lesson and became docile.  Those whose demonic nature was incurable were conveniently used to establish his authority through their deaths.</p><p>Luo Hou and Zhu Que, having nothing better to do, helped the land deity subdue the demons. Within three days, the demons were completely obedient, lined up in the distance, awaiting commands.</p><p>…</p><p>“Finally. Three days.  Their response is rather slow.”</p><p>Qin Sang, emerging from meditation, opened her eyes, her gaze sharp as lightning. She looked towards the direction of Duzhi.</p><p>The land deity was initially puzzled, but soon sensed two powerful presences rapidly approaching. In the night sky, two white rainbows appeared in the distance.</p><p>“White Refining Escape Technique. Cultivators from the Crane Control Pavilion are coming,” the land deity whispered.</p><p>He had mentioned the Crane Control Pavilion to Qin Sang before among the great sects.</p><p>The Crane Control Pavilion was a righteous immortal sect in Duzhi, once as renowned as the Dragon Guard Mountain.  The Crane Control Pavilion cooperated with the Divine Path, actively descending the mountain to protect the peace of the land. Demons dared not trespass.  Dragon Guard Mountain, however, had fallen to the point of relocating its sect.</p><p>Qin Sang had anticipated this.  With the refugees entering Duzhi, the cultivators within Duzhi would certainly come to investigate.</p><p>‘Whoosh! Whoosh!’</p><p>Two beams of light rapidly approached, then suddenly stopped upon seeing the demons in the distance.</p><p>Once they confirmed that Qin Sang and the land deity were unharmed, they approached and descended from the sky.</p><p>The arrivals were an old man and a young man, both dressed in Daoist robes. One rode a magnificent white crane, a creature with its own spiritual power.</p><p>The old man was a Yuan Ying cultivator.</p><p>The land deity recognized the old man, his face showing shock. He quickly bowed.  “This humble deity greets Master Su.”</p><p>This person was the current Pavilion Master of the Crane Control Pavilion!</p><p>“You are the local land deity, I presume?”</p><p>Given Master Su’s status and cultivation, he didn’t need to pay attention to a lowly land deity, yet he still bowed meticulously and then bowed respectfully to Qin Sang.</p><p>“And this Daoist is…?”</p><p>“I am Qingfeng. I greet Pavilion Master Su,” Qin Sang returned the bow.</p><p>Master Su mentally repeated the name “Daoist Qingfeng” several times, certain he had never heard it before. “Daoist Qingfeng, you must not cultivate nearby.  Forgive my boldness, but I inquire as to your place of origin?”</p><p>Master Su had seen the demons. Some possessed considerable power, yet they were all behaving themselves.</p><p>The land deity clearly lacked the strength to subdue them.</p><p>A Daoist of considerable power had arrived.  The Crane Control Pavilion naturally needed to inquire about his intentions.</p><p>“I have no fixed abode. I came from the east, traveling here.  Seeing the suffering of the people, I refined a few insignificant pills. I hope I haven’t caused any inconvenience to the Crane Control Pavilion or to you, Daoist,” Qin Sang said frankly.</p><p>“Daoist, dispensing medicine to save people is a righteous act, worthy of admiration.  How could there be any inconvenience?”</p><p>Master Su hesitated slightly, then tentatively asked, “You must also disapprove of the demons’ rampages.  Might you have a good strategy for dispelling them?”</p><p>Qin Sang saw through it. Master Su’s concern about the demons was a pretense; he cared about Qin Sang's intentions.</p><p>“Demons are everywhere. Even if they are pacified for a time, great demons will descend from Sunset Mountain at any moment. Unless all sects work together, the immortals enter the world and join forces with the Divine Path, it’s only a temporary fix, not a solution to the root problem. I, a mere wandering Daoist, can’t think of any good strategy. To be frank with you, Daoist Su, I am here to find something.”</p><p>Qin Sang didn’t hide it, stating her purpose directly.</p><p>“Oh?  What are you looking for, Daoist? If it's confirmed to be near Duzhi, I might be able to provide some clues,” Master Su’s eyes flashed, asking in return.</p><p>“I am seeking an ancient altar. This altar has three levels; the upper is round, the middle is octagonal, and the lower is square. Its design is ancient, not of this era.”</p><p>The altar is most likely destroyed, perhaps only the base remains...” Qin Sang described the altar's features to Master Su.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Master Su shook his head.  “Master Su has never heard of such an altar.  Since the Daoist says it’s an ancient artifact, after all this time, it might be buried deep underground.”</p><p>Qin Sang showed disappointment and continued, “This Daoist greatly admires thunder magic, so I have traveled the land, visiting fellow practitioners skilled in thunder magic to discuss and exchange techniques. Master Su, if you know of any such practitioners, would you be willing to introduce me?”</p><p>The disciple behind Master Su subtly shifted, glancing at his master's back before remaining silent.</p><p>Master Su shook his head again. “I’m afraid I must disappoint you, Daoist. Among my acquaintances, there are no masters renowned for their thunder magic.”</p><p>Qin Sang sighed, “It seems I must search on my own. I may trouble you again in the future, please don't mind, Master Su.”</p><p>“Not at all! With Daoist Qingfeng around, demons and monsters will surely be terrified. We would be delighted to help. If you ever need assistance, simply send a message to our sect, and Master Su will lead the disciples to aid you.”</p><p>Master Su, having ascertained Qin Sang’s intentions, exchanged pleasantries. He didn’t invite Qin Sang to the sect as a guest; after a few more polite words, he found an excuse to leave.</p><p>Master and disciple ascended on a crane, transforming into two streaks of white light that pierced the sky.</p><p>Watching their departing glow, Qin Sang's eyes flickered.  He called to Xiao Wu, “This matter is settled, let’s go.”</p><p>Qin Sang gave the remaining pills to the land deity, and he and Xiao Wu mounted their horses. The family and the land deity were very reluctant to see them go.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>The green horse summoned a demonic wind and soared into the air.</p><p>“Goodbye, little fairy sister!  You must come visit us again!” Yin’er shouted from below.</p><p>Xiao Wu simply waved, making no promises. After all, there might not be another opportunity to return.</p><p>Master Su and his disciple, having taken their leave of Qin Sang, steered their spirit crane back to Ducheng.</p><p>The disciple hesitated to speak, until they were nearing Ducheng’s border, ensuring they couldn’t be overheard. Then he asked, “Master, isn’t that senior Taiyi exceptionally skilled in thunder magic?”</p><p>Master Su sat cross-legged on the crane’s back, eyes half-closed. He said calmly, “Are you suggesting I introduce Daoist Taiyi and Daoist Qingfeng?”</p><p>“I remember you mentioned that senior Taiyi lamented the lack of fellow practitioners to exchange thunder magic techniques with, saying he couldn’t reach the highest level by himself. This Daoist Qingfeng travels the land seeking fellow practitioners, he must be a master of thunder magic. Perhaps he is the very person senior Taiyi is looking for,” the disciple said.</p><p>“You lack experience and are easily misled by appearances. Just because the Daoist gives away pills and water, helping the poor, doesn’t mean he is a good person. Demons and monsters in this world are cunning and deceptive, often disguising themselves as righteous individuals.”</p><p>Master Su sighed, “Daoist Taiyi has been secluded for many years. Only a few friends like myself can see him. He never reveals himself when he vanquishes demons. I once asked him why, but he avoided answering; he must have untold reasons.  I fear Daoist Taiyi has made powerful enemies and is hiding. If that Daoist is seeking revenge, bringing him to Daoist Taiyi would be inviting a wolf into the house!”</p><p>He patiently explained the risks, guiding his disciple.</p><p>The disciple finally understood, ashamedly admitting, “I was reckless, Master.”</p><p>Ducheng was in sight. Master Su said, “You return first. I will visit Daoist Taiyi. If he isn’t an enemy, let Taiyi meet the Daoist himself.”</p><p>As they spoke, master and disciple separated. Master Su flew south on his crane, passing through Ducheng’s southern border, over Jing State, and further on.</p><p>Along the way, Master Su periodically cast spells to check for pursuers.</p><p>‘Liiit!’</p><p>The spirit crane descended, letting out a cry.</p><p>Below lay layers upon layers of mountains, their peaks overlapping. Mirror-like water flowed between them, creating a breathtaking scene of green mountains floating on water.</p><p>“Is that Master Su? Why are you not in Ducheng, suppressing demons, but have time to visit my humble abode?”</p><p>A deep voice echoed from the mountains, and a white-robed old man appeared on a mountaintop.</p><p>The old man’s expression and demeanor radiated a transcendent aura, like a celestial being, smiling at Master Su.</p><p>“I encountered a strange event, a certain Daoist…”</p><p>Master Su didn’t beat around the bush, recounting his earlier experience.</p><p>However, as soon as the old man heard the word “altar,” his face changed, revealing unprecedented urgency. “An altar? What altar is he looking for? Who is this person?”</p><p>Master Su, sensing something was wrong, opened his mouth to speak, but his expression suddenly changed as he looked behind the old man, as if he’d seen a ghost.</p><p>Standing behind the old man was Qin Sang.</p><p>The old man turned sharply, his palms flashing with thunder and lightning.</p><p>Qin Sang, seemingly unfazed, sized up the old man, showing a look of surprise.  “符感通灵  – this is rare! You call yourself Taiyi.  Are you the Taiyi Lei Zhuan Fu or the Taiyi Lei Gang Fu?”</p>
