<h1>## Chapter 1421: Conspiracy</h1><p>It all depends on how much Tan Hao knows about the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Qin Sang asked these questions.</p><p>Seeing his intention, Tan Hao was secretly surprised, never expecting that Qin Sang would actually dare to oppose Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Tan Hao didn't offer any dissuasion.</p><p>He believed in Qin Sang; achieving today's accomplishments was no accident. He wouldn't do something reckless and court death, or he would have become a lonely, wild ghost in the Yin Sha Abyss long ago.</p><p>He had to admit, Tan Hao also held a few expectations, hoping that Qin Sang could help him retrieve a magical treasure. It would be better than returning empty-handed, forced to watch his own treasure fall into the hands of another.</p><p>"How did you guys get in here?"</p><p>Qin Sang first considered an escape route .</p><p>Without another word, Tan Hao led Qin Sang back to the cave abode.</p><p>He felt around on the wall behind the cave abode. Only a series of clicking sounds could be heard, and the wall shifted to both sides, revealing a stone staircase, sloping downwards.</p><p>A wave of scorching heat rushed toward them.</p><p>The entire Pure Sea Sect was shrouded in crimson flame energy.</p><p>Tan Hao strode down.</p><p>Qin Sang continued to leave the Nascent Soul Puppet outside, paying attention to Old Devil Hunmo's movements, and followed Tan Hao into the secret passage.</p><p>The secret passage, which should have been cool and shady, now had walls on both sides that were crimson red, as if they were about to melt.</p><p>Fortunately, there were Buddhist restrictions on the walls, supporting the secret passage and preventing it from collapsing.</p><p>"This place leads to several meditation chambers. It used to be the location with the richest spiritual energy, and should be the place where the Pure Sea Sect's high monks secluded themselves for meditation. It was originally possible to leave the Pure Sea Sect directly from here. Senior Guimu discovered that this area was the weakest point of the spirit array and broke into it from near the meditation chambers," Tan Hao explained as he walked.</p><p>They continued forward at a brisk pace.</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly stopped Tan Hao. "Wait, where do these two paths lead?"</p><p>They had entered a dark room .</p><p>This was the place where the meditation chamber guards were stationed.</p><p>Behind the dark room was a stone door, leading to a row of meditation chambers.</p><p>In the front, there were three identical secret passages, all pointing to the dark room, seemingly connecting to different directions.</p><p>"They lead to the Scripture Pavilion and the peak where the Golden Summit is located, respectively."</p><p>Tan Hao knew the Pure Sea Sect very well, pointing to the other two secret passages, explaining them one by one.</p><p>"These three places are the three core locations of the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>"The place we came in from is not only the herb garden; the pill chamber, the artifact chamber, and so on are also there.</p><p>"The Scripture Pavilion was originally a wooden pagoda standing alongside the Thirteen-Story Pagoda, but it was unfortunately destroyed in that upheaval. Now only the base remains. The exit of this secret passage is in the Buddha Cave behind the two pagodas, and the restrictions are still there. When Senior entered the Buddha Pagoda, they didn't completely destroy the pagoda's restrictions. If their attention is drawn to the Buddha Pagoda, they shouldn't be able to discover the secret passage in a short time.</p><p>"The third secret passage leads directly to the Golden Summit, but the exit is also sealed by the restrictions on the Golden Summit."</p><p>Hearing this, Qin Sang's eyes lit up. He looked at the secret passage leading to the Golden Summit and asked, "From this secret passage, can we avoid Old Devil Hunmo's sight and enter the Golden Summit?"</p><p>Tan Hao hesitated. "That's true, but the Golden Summit's restrictions are interconnected. If you try to break them, they will definitely notice. Moreover, the secret passage brushes past that mountain pass. If breaking the restrictions causes the seal to collapse and the crimson flame energy bursts through the seal, that secret passage will bear the brunt, and you'll be blocked inside."</p><p>Qin Sang fell silent, letting Tan Hao continue to take him to see the exit.</p><p>He calculated all the possibilities in his heart.</p><p>The Buddha Pagoda had already been visited by Guimu, so there probably weren't many good things left.</p><p>In addition to that, there were still a few places in the Pure Sea Sect with some history. Searching them might lead to the discovery of treasures if he was lucky, but they definitely wouldn't be as good as the Golden Summit.</p><p>Tan Hao had originally planned to search them one by one after forming his Nascent Soul.</p><p>The magical treasures placed in the Golden Summit were the most valuable items on the surface.</p><p>But that also meant that the difficulty of fighting for the treasures here was the greatest!</p><p>While pondering, Qin Sang followed Tan Hao and saw the back door of the meditation chamber. Everything was normal.</p><p>"I almost forgot. Do you know what magical treasures are in the Golden Summit?"</p><p>Qin Sang asked.</p><p>Seeing that Qin Sang really had ideas about the Golden Summit, Tan Hao suppressed the impulse to dissuade him and recalled, "Some of those magical treasures are placed on the offering tables in front of the Buddha statues in the Golden Summit, and some are scattered on the ground. There are also corpses beside them. There are roughly seven or eight items. Among them are a pair of golden forks, a Blessed Vajra Scepter, a jade sword the size of a finger, a magical treasure similar to a heart-protecting mirror, a wish-fulfilling gem, a wooden Buddhist shrine, a flower basket, a spiritual-zhi sceptre ..."</p><p>Then, he added, "Perhaps there are still treasures on the corpses, as well as in places blocked by the Buddha statues. I'm not sure about the function and grade of those magical treasures across the restrictions, so I can only guess."</p><p>He didn't expect there to be so many.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered for a moment and asked, "Which one do you have your eye on?"</p><p>If he had the chance, Qin Sang wouldn't mind helping Tan Hao snatch one, as a reward for the information.</p><p>"The Blessed Vajra Scepter!"</p><p>Tan Hao didn't hesitate.</p><p>His progress in refining his Natal Magic Treasure was behind schedule. After forming his Nascent Soul, he lacked a powerful offensive magical treasure. The safest and most desirable one was the Blessed Vajra Scepter.</p><p>Other Buddhist magical treasures might not be suitable for him, and some might even require Buddhist cultivators to activate.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded, took a deep breath, and said, "Let's go up first!"</p><p>...</p><p>Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>Five figures landed on a mountain peak at the same time. Everyone's gaze was drawn to the Buddha Pagoda and the Golden Summit.</p><p>Among these people, Old Devil Hunmo's aura was the weakest, but he was the most feared and dreaded by everyone.</p><p>Real Person Chijie stood beside Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>He kept stroking the ring on his hand, and excitement and agitation were hidden in the depths of his eyes.</p><p>On the other side of Old Devil Hunmo stood a woman with an enchanting bearing.</p><p>This woman had a beautiful face, but her hair was all silver, making it impossible to tell her age.</p><p>She was also the only Nascent Soul Middle Stage expert among the five.</p><p>This woman's Dharma name was Yu Yi Yuan Jun , the number one expert near the Empty Spirit Sea. She liked to raise handsome male servants , but she didn't force them, and she was very picky. Her reputation was much better than other demonic cultivators. She usually acted in a low-key manner and rarely left her cave abode.</p><p>Real Person Chijie remained calm, glancing at Yu Yi Yuan Jun out of the corner of his eye. He hadn't expected this enchantress to be alarmed as well.</p><p>Yu Yi Yuan Jun's eyes were like water, and her lips carried a smile. She seemed to be observing the Pure Sea Sect, but in reality, her attention was always on Old Devil Hunmo, and she harbored vigilance in her heart.</p><p>Behind the three stood two men, one tall and one short, both Nascent Soul Early Stage cultivators.</p><p>The tall one stood behind Old Devil Hunmo, appearing somewhat aloof.</p><p>The other one looked worried.</p><p>"The degree of damage to the seal seems to be more serious than you said! It seems that uninvited guest that the two Daoists mentioned hasn't come in yet."</p><p>Yu Yi Yuan Jun scanned her surroundings, her voice carrying a bewitching tone, causing people's minds to wander.</p><p>"Fairy, don't let your guard down. This person is also a Nascent Soul Middle Stage expert. We learned from Soul Searching his companions that he seems to have a way to obtain guidance in the spirit array. Unfortunately, Soul Searching a Nascent Soul isn't easy, and he was desperately stopped by the surnamed Mu at a crucial moment. We don't know what methods this person used."</p><p>Real Person Chijie reminded her, paused, and then said, "However, this person is, after all, alone. It's normal for the five of us to break the array faster than him if we join forces."</p>
