<h1>Chapter 1535: Xue Lian Mountain (4k)</h1><p>Perhaps eager to return and absorb the seven-colored energy cluster, the insect cloud no longer plundered life as before, but hurried back to its nest.</p><p>Fei Can gritted his teeth and cursed.</p><p>He obtained the Amber Insect Crystal, but lost his essence. While this wouldn't cause irreversible damage, it would require a long period of rest to recover, delaying his advancement.</p><p>In his simple understanding, not gaining an advantage was a loss—just like the last time he fell into Qin Sang's hands.</p><p>Qin Sang watched the gradually disappearing insect cloud, still recalling the recent experience, feeling quite astonished.</p><p>The true insect king was at least a four-transformation spirit insect!</p><p>Wild four-transformation spirit insects were exceedingly rare.</p><p>Firstly, the difficulty of spirit insect cultivation was extremely high.</p><p>Secondly, wild spirit insects hid extremely well. Some spirit insects skilled in concealment could mask their presence from higher-level enemies.</p><p>However, this true insect king's ability wasn't simply concealment.</p><p>Otherwise, the Sky Eye Butterfly would certainly have discovered its trace.</p><p>The insect control manuals of both clans only had brief descriptions of the Rotten Phosphorus Firefly, portraying it as an insect swarm with only simple instincts, seemingly nothing worth mentioning.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the Rotten Phosphorus Firefly's insect king was so unique.</p><p>"Well, maybe there's no insect king, but a group consciousness mutation of the swarm,"</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the feeling of being watched by the swarm, this thought flashed through his mind, then another possibility came to him, "Perhaps, the true insect king is another spirit insect with special abilities, enslaving this group of Rotten Phosphorus Fireflies…"</p><p>While pondering these questions, Qin Sang wanted to examine the Amber Insect Crystal, but Fei Can had already gulped the crystal whole, struggling to swallow it.</p><p>His small eyes darted around, clearly wary of Qin Sang.</p><p>He knew that Qin Sang had two other spirit insects, and the coquettish butterfly was the most favored.</p><p>In fact, the Sky Eye Butterfly hadn't shown any interest in the Amber Insect Crystal.</p><p>Qin Sang smiled helplessly. Could he steal the treasure this fellow had exchanged for his essence?</p><p>After swallowing the Amber Insect Crystal, Fei Can flew back with a swollen belly, his eyelids drooping, unable to hide his fatigue, almost falling asleep on the spot.</p><p>Qin Sang made a cursory check, confirmed there were no abnormalities, and let him go to sleep, hoping that Fei Can could advance after refining the insect crystal.</p><p>This matter was settled.</p><p>Qin Sang returned to the stone cave, saw Zhou Ruan and the other two quietly staying within the spirit formation, and took them with him, proceeding slowly, leaving the Sky Crack Valley.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Sky Crack Valley.</p><p>Three figures slowly flew through the forest.</p><p>"With respect, senior, ahead is the Daoist temple where we cultivate, Loutai Temple."</p><p>Zhou Ruan and the other led the way, Zhou Jin occasionally turning his head, introducing the surrounding terrain to Qin Sang.</p><p>This place was thousands of miles away from Sky Crack Valley, even more barren than other places, rarely visited by cultivators.</p><p>Loutai Temple was quite famous in the mortal world, but no one would have imagined that a small temple housing cultivators was hidden behind the Loutai Temple's mountain.</p><p>Temple hidden in the mountains.</p><p>The environment was extremely tranquil.</p><p>Zhou Ruan was a true Daoist heir.  It was unknown why the original founder of Loutai Temple chose to establish a Daoist place of cultivation in the Northern Wasteland.  The lineage continued, but it wasn't exactly prosperous, with only the two of them in this generation.</p><p>A few young Daoist priests remained in the temple, disciples of Zhou Jin.</p><p>They stayed at the temple for several days.</p><p>Ruan Yu completely absorbed the medicinal power of the Snake Shadow Grass, her illness improved, and her originally pale face showed a little more color.</p><p>However, there was no joy on her face, only worry.</p><p>Qin Sang decided to take Zhou Jin with him, setting off together, leading him through the most chaotic section of the Northern Wasteland, to the border of the Nineteen Rain-Kissed States, before parting ways.</p><p>He turned westward.</p><p>Zhou Jin entered the Nineteen Rain-Kissed States alone.</p><p>Having made his decision, Zhou Ruan didn't dare to refuse, only silently enduring the pain of separation.</p><p>"Junior Sister will recuperate in the temple, I'll be back soon," Zhou Jin pretended to be relaxed, patted Ruan Yu's thin shoulders, flew up on his sword, and flew out of the temple without looking back, catching up with Qin Sang.</p><p>The journey was uneventful.</p><p>…</p><p>The Nineteen Rain-Kissed States, also called the Central Plains by Northern Wasteland cultivators, didn't actually have a clear boundary with the Northern Wasteland.</p><p>Legend has it that the division of the Nineteen States was related to the past Buddhist-Daoist conflict.  Initially, there were only the six core states of the Eastern River, and the old Central Plains referred to only these six states. Later, it gradually expanded, gradually incorporating the seven Western states, the four Northern states, and the two Southern Barbarian states, forming the current pattern, and called the Nineteen Rain-Kissed States.</p><p>The Nineteen Rain-Kissed States were a prosperous and magnificent scene.</p><p>The four Northern states border the Northern Wasteland.</p><p>Qin Sang and Zhou Jin left the Northern Wasteland and first entered Ze State, one of the four Northern states.</p><p>Ze State.</p><p>As its name suggests, it is a land of endless lakes and marshes.</p><p>The four northern states are largely mountainous and dotted with lakes and marshes.  The six southern states also have extensive waterways, but they lack the wild, untamed scale of the north;  vast marshes and towering peaks are far less common there.</p><p>Ze State, it is said, is nine-tenths water, shrouded in mist and sparsely populated.</p><p>The towns and markets of Ze State resemble islands in a sea, giving the impression of a vast ocean.</p><p>A streak of light sped across the lake, landing on a green peak.  This was Zhou Jin.</p><p>He approached a sheer cliff face at the summit and bowed deeply.</p><p>“Senior Qin, I’ve found out.  A thousand miles south lies Mu Pass City, where the Six States Hall is located—their northernmost branch, I believe.”</p><p>A “垣” (city wall) can be considered a city or large market in the cultivation world, common throughout the Nineteen Rain States, and sometimes called a market town or prefecture elsewhere.</p><p>The Six States Hall is a powerful merchant organization with extensive connections.  Originally established in the six southern states, it has since grown to dominate the Nineteen Rain States, becoming one of the largest merchant guilds in the Central Plains.  The name has remained unchanged.</p><p>Zhou Jin finished speaking; there was no response from the cliff face. Maintaining his respectful posture, he waited patiently.  Suddenly, a flash of light illuminated the cliff, and Qin Sang emerged.</p><p>“Catch!”</p><p>Qin Sang tossed an object to Zhou Jin.</p><p>Quickly catching it with both hands, Zhou Jin felt something weightless and soft.  Upon closer inspection, it was a wisp of grey cloud-like gauze – a light and ethereal magical artifact.</p><p>“I see your escape techniques are lacking.  With this treasure, the ‘Ten Thousand Miles of Smoke,’ you can conceal your presence and, if necessary, use it for rapid escape once you refine it.”</p><p>Qin Sang spoke calmly.  The Ten Thousand Miles of Smoke was crafted from materials from a demonic beast he hunted in the Sky-Splitting Valley.</p><p>Though the Nineteen Rain States enjoy a time of peace compared to the Northern Wastelands, the cultivation world is never truly tranquil.  Zhou Jin, having helped him gather information, needed to be kept safe.</p><p>Zhou Jin rejoiced. “Thank you for the treasure, Senior!”</p><p>Though Qin Sang was reserved, he wasn't unapproachable, and certainly not like a demonic cultivator.</p><p>Hesitantly, Zhou Jin asked Qin Sang some questions about cultivation he’d been pondering for a long time and, to his surprise, received concise and insightful answers.</p><p>Now, Zhou Jin’s fear was tempered with respect, and he resolved to work diligently. Perhaps this was not only a chance to cure his junior sister's illness but also a fortunate encounter for both of them.</p><p>“When you enter the Central Plains, leave a token at the Six States Hall at regular intervals.  Once I’ve finished my business, I'll contact you through them…”</p><p>As they flew towards Mu Pass City, Qin Sang gave instructions, which Zhou Jin carefully noted.</p><p>Reaching Mu Pass City, Zhou Jin bid farewell to Qin Sang and vanished into the vast marshes.</p><p>Qin Sang paused, then entered the city alone.</p><p>The clamor of the city enveloped him.</p><p>In Ze State, due to its sparse population, even the cities and markets, and the settlements of ordinary people, are larger than elsewhere.</p><p>Mu Pass City is said to be controlled by three large factions, a complex situation that Qin Sang had little interest in exploring, as he wouldn't be staying long.</p><p>His purpose was twofold: to establish contact with the Six States Hall for future operations, and to purchase maps of the Western Desert and gather intelligence.</p><p>Six States Hall.</p><p>Qin Sang subtly released the aura of a Yuan Ying cultivator.  Upon entering, he was immediately ushered into a private room and greeted by the manager.</p><p>This manager was actually a Golden Core cultivator, though he appeared as a jovial, plump landlord with a neatly trimmed mustache—a far cry from the typical image of a cultivator.</p><p>The manager subtly observed Qin Sang and bowed.  “Forgive my poor eyesight, Senior.  Might I inquire about your name and origin?”</p><p>“Old man Qin, an itinerant cultivator from overseas.”</p><p>Qin Sang's tone was calm.</p><p>“Senior Qin…”</p><p>The manager realized.  “So Senior hails from the Eastern Sea Isles.  Forgive my limited knowledge…I presume you don't yet have a Six States Token?”</p><p>The manager produced a token and presented it with both hands. “The Hall Master has instructed that Six States Tokens are only given to Yuan Ying cultivators.  Wherever you go, show this token and all branches will wholeheartedly serve you.”</p><p>Qin Sang had received many such items in the North Sea.</p><p>He casually accepted it and asked, “I hear your Hall has excellent intelligence. Do you have any information about the Western Desert?”</p><p>The manager nodded repeatedly, without asking Qin Sang's intentions.  After apologizing, he left the room and quickly returned with a jade slip.  “This is the latest map.  However, due to our limitations and the vastness and ever-changing nature of the Western Desert, it doesn't cover the entire region.  The area closest to the seven western states is the most detailed.”</p><p>Some legends from the Western Desert were also included on the jade slips, all freely given to Senior Qin.”</p><p>Qin Sang’s tone was displeased. “Would this old man sponge off you for a few spirit stones?”</p><p>The steward repeatedly said he dared not, hurriedly explaining, “Senior, please understand, this has always been the rule of our Six States Hall.  This kind of information has always been provided free of charge to Yuan Ying masters.  It’s not for anything else, just to cultivate good karma.”</p><p>“Heh, your Hall has great ambition. No wonder you’ve become so large.”</p><p>Qin Sang nodded and accepted them readily.</p><p>After receiving the jade slip, Qin Sang immediately saw Jiu Jia Mountain, still a sacred Buddhist site.</p><p>…</p><p>After a brief stay in Mu Guan Yuan, Qin Sang left the city and headed west towards Jiu Jia Mountain to meet with Liuli.</p><p>The direction was easy to determine; Qin Sang only needed to follow the Tian Tuo River westward to reach Jiu Jia Mountain.</p><p>Leaving Zezhou, and passing through Sai Prefecture, the northernmost prefecture of the seven western prefectures, he entered the Western Desert.</p><p>In western Sai Prefecture, the landscape started to resemble that of the Western Desert.</p><p>Vast desert, a desolate landscape.</p><p>However, the banks of the Tian Tuo River remained lush and green, the scenery beyond the pass no less impressive than the Six States of the east.</p><p>The Western Desert wasn't entirely desert and wasteland; its interior contained oases, lakes, and fertile lands, quite rich.</p><p>For example, in the northern region of the Western Desert, at the source of the Tian Tuo River, the Xue Lian Mountains, the melting snow nourished large oases, forming a mighty river that flowed through the Central Plains and eventually emptied into the East Sea. It was one of the most important rivers in the Central Plains water system.</p><p>Legend has it that the Xue Lian Mountains were a place where Buddhism flourished, with numerous Buddhist sacred sites, Jiu Jia Mountain being just one of them.</p><p>Over the years, the Western Desert was no longer solely under Buddhist control. Taoist disciples came out to preach and established sects in the oases amidst the sands.</p><p>Many other unorthodox sects and evil cultivators, unwilling to go to the Northern Wasteland, chose to go west. While not as chaotic as the Northern Wasteland, the situation was still very complex.</p><p>Of course, the Xue Lian Mountains remained a Buddhist preserve, difficult for external forces to penetrate.</p><p>Along the banks of the Tian Tuo River, Buddhist temples were as numerous as the stars in the sky, visible everywhere. This river was also a pilgrimage route for Buddhist disciples from the Central Plains.</p><p>Buddhism, though greatly diminished in the North Sea and Canglang Sea, was one of the most important forces in the Central Plains, rivaling Taoism.</p><p>Qin Sang traveled with Buddhist disciples, calling himself a layman, the "Bright Moon Walker."</p><p>His practice of the "Seven Master Buddha Seal" allowed him to fit in with the Buddhists.</p><p>Leaving Sai Prefecture, the scenery became increasingly desolate. The moisture from the Tian Tuo River could not withstand the erosion of the wind and sand, and the oases along the riverbanks gradually shrank, the vegetation becoming increasingly sparse.</p><p>Once deep within the Western Desert, the scenery was almost identical to the Beichen Desert in the Beichen region, and Qin Sang, unfazed, hurried on, making almost no stops.</p><p>Until reaching the edge of the Xue Lian Mountains, the land gradually became richer again.</p><p>Lush trees, abundant vegetation.</p><p>Qin Sang landed on a patch of wasteland, gazing into the depths of the oasis, where he saw snow-capped mountains, temples nestled among the snowy peaks, bathed in Buddhist light.</p><p>"I wonder if Liuli has arrived yet,"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered, heading towards Jiu Jia Mountain and disappearing in a flash.</p><p>Jiu Jia Mountain.</p><p>Qin Sang's figure appeared at the foot of the mountain, gazing at the enormous city walls encircling the summit.</p><p>As expected, a Buddhist temple was built in the center of the walls, at the top of the mountain, and it was the largest temple he had seen on his entire journey west.</p><p>Among the peaks of the Xue Lian Mountains, Jiu Jia Mountain was not particularly majestic or dangerous.</p><p>Its status as a sacred site was due to a Buddhist sage who had once practiced there; the temple was the sage's practice ground.</p><p>The mountain path was crowded with people, including Buddhist monks, but like ordinary people, they chose to walk up the mountain as a sign of respect.</p><p>Jiu Jia Mountain was not only famous as a Buddhist sacred site.</p><p>Located at the southern foot of the Xue Lian Mountains, it was also a crucial gateway to the Xue Lian Mountains from the southern desert, and because the city was orderly, it served as a market town, trusted by the nearby cultivators.</p><p>Therefore, many people on the mountain path were not dressed as monks, and Qin Sang didn't stand out.</p><p>He observed that the expressions of these Buddhist monks were somewhat strange, their faces seemingly filled with resentment and indignation. According to Buddhist scriptures, anger should be cut off; these Buddhist monks clearly lacked sufficient cultivation.</p><p>One or two behaving this way would be normal.</p><p>But so many Buddhist monks acting this way was rather unusual.</p><p>Qin Sang walked up the mountain and into the city, deliberately acting conspicuously, announcing himself as the Bright Moon Walker, and then found the most famous inn and settled in.</p><p>He rested briefly in his room, washing away the dust of the journey, also waiting for Liuli.</p><p>If Liuli didn't come, he would start his own inquiries about the situation in the Western Desert, searching for information related to the Buddha bone relic.</p><p>Before dusk, the protective barrier on his door was triggered. Qin Sang's heart stirred, a smile appearing on his face as he opened the door.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>A figure in a hooded cloak flashed in—Liuli!</p>
