<h1>Chapter 891: Dark Thunderwood</h1><p>“Junior Sister Fang, Senior Brother Zhao, please!”</p><p>Huashen, with a smile, invited the two of them in.</p><p>This Zhao Songqiao was also a quick-witted person.</p><p>Huashen had heard from Fang Ting that after joining the sect, Zhao Songqiao had been very attentive to her, frequently visiting. Initially, Fang Ting was wary of this old man, but later, seeing that he had no ill intentions and even helped her with some small tasks, and being a fellow disciple, she gradually let down her guard.</p><p>She had casually mentioned to Zhao Songqiao once that Huashen had become a true disciple of the Yin-Yang lineage of the Candor Sect.  Unexpectedly, Zhao Songqiao then asked her for an introduction.</p><p>Fang Ting couldn't refuse, so last month when she came, she brought Zhao Songqiao along.</p><p>Huashen had seen this kind of thing many times before.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao, as a rogue cultivator, had painstakingly cultivated to the thirteenth level of Qi Refining and tempered such a mentality, presumably having tasted the joys and sorrows of life. Huashen didn't feel any aversion to Zhao Songqiao's attempts to curry favor, but he wouldn't get too close either, maintaining a polite facade.</p><p>The three entered the house and sat down.</p><p>Huashen brewed some spirit tea, glanced at their faces, took a sip, and asked calmly, “Junior Sister Fang, you came here today because you have something to discuss, right?”</p><p>“Senior Brother, you can even tell that?”</p><p>Fang Ting's face was full of surprise, but then her nose wrinkled, revealing a troubled expression.</p><p>This made Huashen secretly curious. Fang Ting had a straightforward personality, and during her previous visits, she rarely showed such hesitation. He wondered what the matter was.</p><p>“Hehe, Junior Sister, all your thoughts are written on your face. How could Junior Brother Zhang not see it with his keen eyes?”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao chuckled and looked at Fang Ting. “Junior Sister Fang, if it's difficult for you to say, since this matter arose because of me, let me tell Junior Brother Zhang.”</p><p>“Alright, Senior Brother Zhao, you say it.”</p><p>Fang Ting nodded as if relieved.</p><p>Huashen just looked at the two curiously without speaking.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao straightened up, his expression slightly serious, and said, “Junior Brother Zhang, since you are already a true disciple of the Candor Sect, you should know about the Illumination Island Assembly.”</p><p>Huashen was slightly taken aback. He put down his teacup and asked, “Senior Brother Zhao, why are you asking about the Illumination Island Assembly? The Misty Pavilion should also send disciples to participate, right?”</p><p>“That's right, but only true disciples are allowed to participate, and I'm not qualified.  At the assembly, the true disciples of various sects will compete, especially the Foundation Establishment stage seniors of each sect. If I could observe them once, it would be of great benefit to my path of breaking through the bottleneck.”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao sighed, and without waiting for Huashen to reply, he changed his tone, “Fortunately, Junior Sister Fang agreed to take me to Illumination Island to watch the assembly.”</p><p>Huashen looked at Fang Ting, not surprised by this. With Fang Ting's status, no one in the Misty Pavilion would be so tactless as to object.</p><p>However, when Fang Ting mentioned Zhao Songqiao before, her tone wasn't particularly close.</p><p>Huashen was a little curious how Zhao Songqiao had persuaded Fang Ting.</p><p>“Is Senior Chen taking you there?”</p><p>Fang Ting shook her head and said with some helplessness, “Originally, Master was supposed to lead the team to Illumination Island, but Master has been in seclusion…”</p><p>Huashen laughed in surprise.</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Chen and Elder Huayang had formed a grudge.  It was likely that the cultivator surnamed Chen wouldn't leave seclusion until he broke through to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment, avoiding any encounter with Elder Huayang.</p><p>“Then congratulations, Senior Brother Zhao! You have the highest cultivation level among our group of disciples, and Senior Chen values you greatly. After the assembly, you will definitely break through. Among us, Senior Brother Zhao should be the first to establish a foundation.”</p><p>Huashen cupped his hands in congratulations, not asking a word about the previous matter.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao waved his hands repeatedly. Seeing Huashen's evasiveness, he had to continue, “Junior Brother Zhang, you will soon break through to the tenth level of Qi Refining, and then you will know how difficult it is to establish a foundation. At my age, I don't know how many times I've failed, and I've long given up hope. I never thought I would be accepted into the Misty Pavilion. This is the only chance in my life, and I must strive for it no matter what.  Please help me, Junior Brother Zhang!”</p><p>Seeing Zhao Songqiao's behavior, Huashen was full of doubts. “Senior Brother Zhao, you're making me confused. I didn't join the sect earlier than you, and my cultivation is not as high as yours. How can I help you?”</p><p>“Junior Brother Zhang, you should have learned about what kind of place Illumination Island is, right?”</p><p>Zhao Songqiao asked Huashen to activate the cave dwelling’s restrictions before whispering, “This island is not a secret in Candor Island.  The island is quite unique, especially abundant in wood-type spiritual energy, making it particularly suitable for the growth of spiritual herbs and spiritual wood, without requiring any care from cultivators. After the various sects discovered Illumination Island, they divided it among themselves, with the Candor Sect occupying the largest and most fertile area. However, the most central area is Mount Rising Star in the center of Candor Island. It is said that there are many rare spiritual herbs on it, even attracting Foundation Establishment cultivators, almost causing a great chaos. Later, the sects set rules and jointly sealed Illumination Island. Only during each Illumination Island Assembly will the seal be opened for them to enter the mountain and gather spiritual herbs. And it is said that the performance of the disciples of each sect in the assembly is also related to the final distribution of spiritual herbs…”</p><p>Huashen listened quietly to Zhao Songqiao's words.</p><p>He had already inquired about the situation on Illumination Island.</p><p>This place was only opened once in a long while, and it was a forbidden area, but Huashen felt that the possibility of it being related to Mount Bullfight was low.  Nevertheless, he would still look for an opportunity to search the island.</p><p>What Zhao Songqiao said was consistent with what he had learned.</p><p>The Candor Sect couldn't keep all the spiritual herbs on Mount Rising Star for themselves, so to appease the other sects, they held the Illumination Island Assembly.</p><p>Huashen stared at Zhao Songqiao. This guy had inquired about Illumination Island so thoroughly, could he be plotting something against Mount Rising Star? Mount Rising Star was under the watchful eyes of various sects; even his main body wouldn't dare to do such a reckless thing.</p><p>Trespassing on Mount Rising Star was no different from courting death!</p><p>“…Besides Mount Rising Star, each sect also cultivates some spiritual trees and spiritual herbs in their own designated areas. It is said that the results are much better than outside.”</p><p>At this point, Zhao Songqiao paused and bowed slightly. “Your sect has a Dark Thunderwood forest on Illumination Island.  Since Junior Brother Zhang is a true disciple and works under Senior Jin Yan, you must know about it. I would like to ask Junior Brother Zhang to take me to this forest once.”</p><p>“Dark Thunderwood forest?”</p><p>Huashen asked in surprise, “Senior Brother Zhao even knows about this?”</p><p>Dark Thunderwood was a kind of spiritual wood with an ink-like color, shaped like a pagoda tree. Its special feature was that it contained a faint trace of Yin Thunder power, which could be used to refine flying swords and other magical artifacts, increasing their power compared to similar artifacts of the same rank.</p><p>However, this wisp of Yin Thunder power was too weak and thin, only useful for low-level disciples.</p><p>The Candor Sect did have a Dark Thunderwood forest on Illumination Island, and it seemed to be quite large. Jin Yan had mentioned that a batch of Dark Thunderwood on the island should be mature.</p><p>Zhao Songqiao shook his head repeatedly, “The valuable spiritual herbs outside Mount Rising Star have long been picked clean and have become ordinary herb gardens. What spiritual plants each sect cultivates is no longer a secret.”</p>
