<h1>Chapter 1412: Separation</h1><p>This was the Tide-Drawing Horseshoe Crab's innate divine power.</p><p>A four-transformation spirit insect possessed extraordinary divine abilities. Though not a match for the Black Bamboo Staff, it served as a buffer, successfully saving the life of the female cultivator surnamed Wang.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo's strike missed its mark.</p><p>A hint of surprise flickered across his expression, but this did not affect his decision.</p><p>The Black Bamboo Staff did not pursue the female cultivator surnamed Wang.</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang only had a Nascent Soul remnant left and had been forced to use teleportation to escape, suffering a severe loss of vital energy and was not worth worrying about.</p><p>The Black Bamboo Staff, full of imposing aura, still followed its previous momentum, and ruthlessly smashed toward Valley Master Mu!</p><p>At this time, the Nascent Soul of the female cultivator surnamed Wang was frail and tottering, like a leaf in the storm.</p><p>Cultivator Qi was entangled by the Precept-Holding Reverend.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo didn't even glance at them, heading straight for Qin Sang and Valley Master Mu, who posed the greatest threat to him.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's gaze was calm.</p><p>He summoned back the Tide-Drawing Horseshoe Crab, his palm clenched in a void grip, and retrieved the Serpent Spear. Serpent Armor protected his body, resisting the Black Bamboo Staff. Just as he was about to use the spear to stab at Old Devil Hunmo, he suddenly saw Old Devil Hunmo give him an eerie smile that made his hair stand on end.</p><p>He saw a black shadow swaying behind Old Devil Hunmo. A head actually emerged from behind his head, crossing Old Devil Hunmo's shoulder, staring straight at Valley Master Mu.</p><p>This head was not a physical entity; it seemed to be a Yin spirit (or wraith).</p><p>The Yin spirit's eye sockets were a pale white, devoid of eyeballs.</p><p>Being watched by the Yin spirit felt like being targeted by some extremely terrifying thing.</p><p>Valley Master Mu actually felt a chill.</p><p>At this moment, Valley Master Mu recalled the various rumors about Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's heart stirred with alarm, and he secretly thought, 'Not good!'</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>The Yin spirit suddenly opened its mouth and let out a piercing shriek, extremely ear-splitting, like a demonic sound.</p><p>The moment he heard the shriek, Valley Master Mu's mind buzzed, and he felt as if his brain was being flooded with demonic sounds. His nascent soul experienced a sharp pain and even a sense of stagnation.</p><p>Valley Master Mu was greatly alarmed and hurriedly closed off his five senses.</p><p>However, Old Devil Hunmo's next move was beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p>He did not take advantage of the situation to attack Valley Master Mu. With a flick of his withered palm, he actually struck the Thousand Buddha Wall with the Hunmo Token in his hand.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo launched his attack.</p><p>The female cultivator surnamed Wang was crippled.</p><p>Valley Master Mu's nascent soul was impacted.</p><p>All of this happened extremely quickly, in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Qin Sang was being subjected to the first wave of Buddha light and crimson flames.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>One was to ignore what was happening behind him, continue forward, and leave directly.</p><p>With the Thousand Buddha Wall blocking the way, Old Devil Hunmo would not be able to catch up to him for a while, guaranteeing his own safety.</p><p>But if he did that, Valley Master Mu and the other two would be in danger.</p><p>Even in their prime, Valley Master Mu and the other two were no match for Old Devil Hunmo and the Precept-Holding Reverend, especially since Old Devil Hunmo seemed to know the Pure Sea Sect even better than they did.</p><p>The second was to retreat and save them.</p><p>Almost without hesitation, Qin Sang made the second choice, at least he couldn't let Valley Master Mu perish here.</p><p>As for Qi and Wang, he could only say he would do his best.</p><p>Qin Sang assessed the strength of both sides. Based on previous experience, relying on his several divine abilities and joining forces with Valley Master Mu, he should be able to fight Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>At least, Old Devil Hunmo wouldn't be able to kill him so easily.</p><p>If Valley Master Mu and the other two perished here...</p><p>Leaving him alone, if he encountered Old Devil Hunmo again, he would be too passive.</p><p>More Nascent Souls would arrive later.</p><p>These people were afraid of Old Devil Hunmo, but they had no friendship with him. His situation would become increasingly difficult. At that time, he probably wouldn't get any treasures and would be driven out of the Pure Sea Sect.</p><p>There was another consideration for turning back to save them.</p><p>Bestowing favor on Valley Master Mu, if he inquired about Hundred Flower Valley in the future, Valley Master Mu would have no reason to refuse.</p><p>Weighing the pros and cons.</p><p>Qin Sang fully activated the Golden Sinking Sword, displaying the Seven Soul Killing Formation.</p><p>The power of the sword formation was vast and mighty, resisting the Buddha light and crimson flames.</p><p>The pressure on his body eased, and Qin Sang saw Valley Master Mu being hit, about to expose his trump card and release the Nascent Soul puppet to save him, when he saw the Hunmo Token smashed over.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The Hunmo Token transformed into a hundred-zhang (approx. 333 meters) illusory image, its aura earth-shattering, fiercely bombarding the Thousand Buddha Wall!</p><p>The Buddha light and crimson flame aura originally maintained a delicate balance, but the power of the Hunmo Token impacted and destroyed it, immediately throwing everything into chaos.</p><p>Especially the gap where Qin Sang was located.</p><p>Crimson-gold light set off terrifying waves, surging from both sides, about to engulf the gap in the blink of an eye. Qin Sang's vision was blurred, giving rise to an extreme sense of danger.</p><p>"Not good!"</p><p>Qin Sang guessed Old Devil Hunmo's plan and was greatly alarmed.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo's whereabouts were exposed by Qin Sang, so he adapted to the situation and changed his original plan of killing the four of them here.</p><p>He knew that if he attacked Valley Master Mu and Qin Sang escaped, the two of them would support each other. Even he would have to go to great lengths to kill them.</p><p>One was the Valley Master of Hundred Flower Valley, whose reputation spread from String Moon Realm to Boundless Sea.</p><p>The other's identity was unknown, but he could see through his whereabouts, showing considerable skill.</p><p>These two were clearly not ordinary Nascent Soul middle-stage cultivators.</p><p>Delay would only bring trouble.</p><p>Therefore, Old Devil Hunmo decided to stir up the Thousand Buddha Wall, first forcing Qin Sang away, dividing the opponents, and defeating them one by one.</p><p>Leaving Valley Master Mu alone would be much easier to deal with.</p><p>Even if he couldn't catch Qin Sang later, with only one person left, they wouldn't be able to cause any trouble.</p><p>The surface of the Thousand Buddha Wall rumbled constantly.</p><p>The 'å??' (wan) glyphs either shone brightly or shattered.</p><p>The crimson flame aura was even more like a torrent of fire, rampaging across the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>With the balance broken, the surface of the Thousand Buddha Wall instantly became extremely chaotic.</p><p>In Qin Sang's vision, only crimson and gold colors remained. Valley Master Mu and the others outside had all disappeared.</p><p>The fierce power came wave after wave, astonishing.</p><p>If Qin Sang rushed out now, he would be bombarded to death on the spot.</p><p>With his retreat cut off, he had no choice but to give up saving them, pass through the Thousand Buddha Wall, and leave this place of contention.</p><p>"Grand cultivator (or Great cultivator), truly cunning as an old fox..."</p><p>Qin Sang slowly exhaled a breath of air.</p><p>He had to admit that Old Devil Hunmo's plan was very successful.</p><p>However, he was not without the power to counterattack!</p><p>A cold smile appeared on the corner of Qin Sang's mouth. He turned a blind eye to the surging Buddha light and crimson flames. He used his divine sense to guide the corpse puppet pouch on his waist, and the Nascent Soul puppet jumped out, blocking in front of Qin Sang.</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The first wave struck.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet, fearless of death, its whole body surging with puppet seal power, firmly guarded Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at the Nascent Soul puppet, flicked his sleeve, and the Eighteen Demon Banners flew out. The Nine Nether Demon Fire transformed into a fire dragon, seemingly examining the battlefield across the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>"Go!"</p><p>Qin Sang whispered.</p><p>Taking advantage of the Nascent Soul puppet blocking another wave of attacks, the fire dragon roared out.</p><p>Its target was not outside the Thousand Buddha Wall, but the Thousand Buddha Wall itself!</p><p>'Boom!'</p><p>The demonic fire fiercely crashed into the Thousand Buddha Wall, creating even greater chaos, and some of the Buddha light and crimson flames, at the moment of the explosion, were guided by Qin Sang, with the help of the demonic fire, towards Old Devil Hunmo.</p><p>At this time, the crack was almost filled with the surging power.</p><p>The Nascent Soul puppet was already tottering.</p><p>Qin Sang knew that this was the limit of what he could do, so he put away the puppet and turned to leave.</p><p>Outside the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p><p>Old Devil Hunmo was sure that Qin Sang could not come out and was about to attack Valley Master Mu when he suddenly sensed something was wrong and abruptly looked towards the Thousand Buddha Wall.</p>
