<h1>Chapter 906: Dark Clouds</h1><p>The passage, deprived of its source of black smoke, was rapidly shrinking. Once it sealed completely, those inside would be trapped, and even if they survived the spirit array, they would certainly be captured by the Lan Dou Sect.</p><p>A difficult choice lay before the young man surnamed Fang.</p><p>He was still unaware of the events that had transpired, clueless about why that person had appeared to sabotage the flag array and what exactly he had done.</p><p>All his junior brothers were trapped inside, and what if the treasure was in there…</p><p>After all, his second junior brother's abilities and intelligence were well-known; it shouldn't be that easy for someone to steal the treasure while he was present.</p><p>Finally, the young man surnamed Fang roared in anger, dashing to the passage entrance. Simultaneously, the blood Jiao beside him let out a roar, fearlessly charging into the passage, leaving only a small portion of its body outside.</p><p>‘Pfft!’</p><p>A Wu tribe cultivator was thrown out, dazed and disoriented. The young man surnamed Fang grabbed him by the collar.</p><p>“The stone platform?”</p><p>“Senior Brother!”</p><p>The man, having escaped death, was overjoyed at first, then shocked. He cried, his face ashen, "Second Senior Brother was ambushed and killed on the spot. His belongings were… were stolen…"</p><p>Before the man could finish, the young man surnamed Fang was already enraged, slapping him hard across the face, sending him flying dozens of meters.</p><p>“Useless!”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang trembled with anger.</p><p>He had braved danger, only to return empty-handed.</p><p>His second junior brother, with so many people and the Beast King Banner, had been killed and robbed right under their noses.  The young man surnamed Fang couldn't help but rage.</p><p>At that moment, the blood Jiao managed to rescue another person. The passage grew narrower, and the blood Jiao, unable to hold on any longer, was forced to retreat.</p><p>Three figures floated on the empty sea, their desolation palpable.</p><p>Once the passage collapsed, those trapped inside would be impossible to save.</p><p>Now, only three of them and two blood corpse insects remained.  Most critically, the stone platform was gone, snatched away. The mission from their master had failed.</p><p>The three exchanged glances, their expressions filled with despair.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>“We won't rest until that person is punished!”</p><p>The young man surnamed Fang's eyes were bloodshot, nearly losing his reason.  Regardless of whether he could catch up or not, he rode the blood Jiao towards the direction where Qin Sang had disappeared.</p><p>The two junior brothers exchanged a look, not daring to utter a sound. Upon noticing that Lu Shouzuo was about to catch up, they were startled and quickly grabbed onto the blood Jiao's tail.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>Inside Dongming Island, cultivators from various sects broke through the flag array. Some followed the fleeing Black Serpent Mountain disciples into the passage; others besieged those who had fallen behind.</p><p>The lone Black Serpent Mountain disciples, wielding the Beast King Banner, put up a futile resistance, their faces filled with despair. However, the various sects' goal was to capture them alive, not to kill them.</p><p>Chaos reigned.</p><p>At this moment, a black-and-white遁光 sped towards them—it was Hua Yang Laodao.</p><p>Hua Yang Laodao, besieged by the blood Jiao until now, had his robe torn to shreds, his body stained with blood, his breath ragged, and his expression extremely anxious.</p><p>Arriving at the Dark Thunder Wood Forest, Hua Yang Laodao felt an ominous premonition. Upon seeing the exposed stone steps and sensing a violent force emanating from within, he was greatly startled and rushed forward, shouting, “The thunder liquid is about to erupt! Run!”</p><p>Everyone paused, looking at Hua Yang Laodao's appearance, almost wanting to laugh.</p><p>“What thunder liquid? Fellow Daoist Hua Yang, your Lan Dou Sect is very secretive. Dongming Island hides a treasure, yet we knew nothing about it. If you hadn’t been hoarding it all along, this wouldn’t have happened…”</p><p>Having failed to seize the treasure, some were dissatisfied and questioned Hua Yang Laodao.</p><p>However, Hua Yang Laodao completely ignored them, running away after saying that, as if something terrifying lurked in the forest, his expression not seeming feigned.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts pounded, they released their divine senses, and finally discovered the anomaly.</p><p>“This force is so violent… Could there really be thunder liquid hidden beneath the ground?”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone scrambled to escape.</p><p>As soon as they rushed out, a sun-like light suddenly appeared in the Dark Thunder Wood Forest, and under everyone's horrified gaze, it exploded.</p><p>The Dark Thunder Wood Forest vanished completely, leaving behind a deep pit. A terrifying wave swept across everything.</p><p>Those cultivators who had managed to escape were hit by the shockwave, and were now in about the same state as Hua Yang Laodao—dressed like beggars, their eyes vacant, their faces filled with fear.</p><p>Dongming Island trembled violently, with huge waves crashing against it.</p><p>Lu Shouzuo, who was outside the island, also seemed to have been impacted, groaning and his figure swaying. He suddenly looked towards Dongming Island, his face changing drastically.</p><p>Qin Sang, who had escaped far away, was also startled by the explosion. He turned his head and looked towards Dongming Island, where a dark cloud rose into the sky, seemingly mixed with streaks of lightning, which was particularly eye-catching against the clear sky and blue sea, lingering for a long time.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>Qin Sang paused, a little dazed and bewildered.</p><p>In the Dark Thunder Woods, he had been worried about further dangers within the stone steps. He'd decided against letting the Sky-Eye Butterfly enter, fearing exposure. His plan was simple: identify the treasure thief, kill them, and take the treasure. No need for unnecessary risks.</p><p>Therefore, Qin Sang was unaware of the existence of the Thunder Pool on Dongming Island.</p><p>"What in the world did those guys do?"</p><p>Qin Sang muttered to himself, thoroughly shocked by the scene before him.</p><p>"Not only did they steal the treasure, but they also ravaged this precious place. Even though I didn't do it, Lan Dou Sect will surely blame me, won't they?  I've now offended both the Witch Clan and the Human Clan, three Yuan Ying Masters... Thankfully, I was cautious enough not to use my double-headed… in public.  Only the Star Conch and the sword light were exposed…"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression was troubled.</p><p>He still didn't know that another Yuan Ying master of the Lan Dou Sect had fallen.</p><p>However, two Yuan Ying enemies, with both the Witch Clan and Human Clan hunting him, was quite enough trouble.</p><p>"The Black Serpent Mountain people slaughtered the Dou Niu Peak disciples.  The Dou Niu Peak's true legacy must have fallen into their hands. That person killed first seemed very high-ranking, second only to the Fang young master. His storage pouch should have it.  Hopefully, this true legacy is useful. If it can solve the problem of Star Yuan Infusion, I'll find a place to cultivate in seclusion for decades, then reappear when the Seven Killing Hall opens. I'll see where they find me then…"</p><p>Qin Sang steeled his resolve, speaking coldly.</p><p>There was still an important task to attend to; he didn't have time to check those two people's storage pouches. Qin Sang glanced behind him. He’d shaken off his pursuers.  Immediately concealing his aura, he took a large detour, then stealthily returned to retrieve his clone.</p><p>Shortly after, the Qingfu coins in Qin Sang's hand reacted.</p><p>Before parting, Qin Sang had given his clone a coin, instructing him to crush it upon escaping to signal his location.</p><p>Qin Sang reached the deserted island, sensing his clone's location, his expression softening. His clone had escaped successfully.  The chaos on Dongming Island meant nobody had noticed a Qi Condensation disciple's movements.</p><p>He flicked a finger, revealing a black coffin-shaped artifact. He ordered his clone to enter, then shouldered the coffin and fled the scene.</p><p>As for the far-reaching consequences of this great upheaval, that was beyond his concern.</p>
