<h1>Chapter 338: Unwavering Devotion</h1><p>Chapter 338: Unwavering Devotion</p><p>For over forty years, Tan Hao has never given up on Tan Jie, painstakingly guiding his comatose brother along the arduous path of cultivation.  He not only struggles to gather resources for his own cultivation but also relentlessly searches for elixirs to sustain Tan Jie's life and heal his injuries.</p><p>No wonder Tan Hao is so impoverished!  A cultivator at the thirteenth level of Qi Condensation isn't the very bottom of the cultivation world; basic resources shouldn't be a problem, and at least a simple cave dwelling should be affordable. But Tan Hao has spent most of his savings on Tan Jie.  No wonder he hasn't been able to establish his foundation!  Considering his hardships, reaching the thirteenth level of Qi Condensation is remarkable. Unless Tan Hao has a stroke of incredible luck, he'll never amass the resources needed for foundation establishment.</p><p>Qin Sang recalled the scenes at the auctions and secret markets; this must have played out countless times for Tan Hao. He's poured everything he has into every elixir that might possibly help Tan Jie.</p><p>Tan Hao produced a Tranquil Spirit Pill obtained from the secret market, opened the jade coffin, gently raised Tan Jie, and used his spiritual energy to dissolve the pill and feed it to his brother.  Even this hard-won elixir only slightly strengthened Tan Jie's spirit. Before, it was like a lamp running out of oil, the weak flame about to extinguish; now, it's just a drop of oil added, allowing it to burn a little longer. That’s all. The fundamental situation remains unchanged.</p><p>It's virtually useless against Tan Jie's injuries, unable to stop the dissipation of his spirit, showing no signs of awakening. The severity of Tan Jie's condition is evident.</p><p>An involuntary question rose in Qin Sang's mind: Is it worth it?  At Tan Hao's current cultivation level, he may never find a cure for Tan Jie in his lifetime. Even if he miraculously did, he wouldn't be able to afford it, nor would he be able to obtain it by force.  And his own cultivation path has been severely delayed.  The eventual outcome is easy to imagine: when Tan Hao's lifespan ends, Tan Jie will die as well.</p><p>Tan Hao has kept Tan Jie alive for several more decades, but as a living corpse, unconscious, immobile, drifting through life, unaware of anything.  It seems utterly meaningless!  Yet, judging by Tan Hao's expression, he clearly feels it's all worthwhile.  Perhaps it's driven by guilt towards his brother, or perhaps by brotherly love…</p><p>Without regret!</p><p>Qin Sang suddenly remembered someone – Senior Sister Qing Ting. She and Tan Hao are so alike! Senior Sister Qing Ting did it for her Dao companion, Senior Brother Jiang; Tan Hao, for his brother, Tan Jie. One is love; the other, brotherhood.  Both relentlessly pursued their goals, never giving up!</p><p>To heal Senior Brother Jiang, Senior Sister Qing Ting exhausted all means, spending her savings to refine the Fire Raven Talisman and ventured into the Sky Corpse Sect ruins to search for the Sky Corpse Charm. Yet, having sold all her magical tools for materials, she died at the hands of a煞尸 (malignant corpse). In her final moments, Senior Brother Jiang miraculously awoke, grasping her hand, his single tear the greatest comfort to Qing Ting. All her efforts were known to him; they were not in vain.</p><p>The scene in the Sky Corpse Cave is still vividly etched in Qin Sang's memory, prompting much reflection.  To witness a similar scene today is unexpected. In the cultivation world, as long as one isn't dead, as long as there's a sliver of hope, miracles are possible!</p><p>Tan Hao must be driven by this very belief, bearing his burden and persevering to this day.  If he had given up on Tan Jie, and later encountered a chance to cure him, he would undoubtedly regret it deeply.</p><p>A thoughtful expression appeared on Qin Sang's face, his gaze flickering slightly, lost in thought.</p><p>"This spiritual liquid contains a medicinal herb called Purple Gold Paste, thanks to Senior Sister Shi Hong…"</p><p>Tan Hao carefully placed Tan Jie back into the coffin's spiritual liquid. Qin Sang's gaze turned to the liquid within. A faint purple hue shimmered in the transparent liquid, a life force sustaining Tan Jie's body – the effect of the Purple Gold Paste, as Tan Hao had mentioned.  However, the purple was extremely faint, indicating that the paste's potency was nearly exhausted!</p><p>Qin Sang could imagine that, if Tan Hao hadn't encountered this unexpected event and successfully obtained the Tranquil Spirit Pill, he wouldn't have had time to rest; he would have immediately set out again to find a new elixir to sustain his brother.</p><p>For years, Tan Hao had lived like this, hadn't he?</p><p>"When I first met Shi Hong, my senior sister, after she heard about Tan Jie's condition, she unhesitatingly gave me all her savings.  That's how I could afford the Zijin Paste and finally breathe a sigh of relief. I was able to cultivate intensely for several years and break through to the thirteenth level of Qi Refinement. Otherwise, Tan Jie wouldn't have survived. Senior Sister Shi Hong saved our lives, yet I've been unable to repay her…"</p><p>Mentioning Shi Hong, Tan Hao's voice was filled with gratitude.  He looked at Qin Sang with an almost pleading expression. This tough man suddenly bowed deeply, about to perform a full prostration.</p><p>"Brother Qin, please, you must save my senior sister! I'm a cripple now, I don't know how else I can repay you for your kindness. I will never forget this favor. If I can't repay you in this life, I'll be your ox and horse in the next!"</p><p>Qin Sang, quick as a flash, sent out a wave of spiritual energy to prevent Tan Hao from bowing.  He said solemnly, "We four are fellow disciples. You don't need to say anything; I will do everything I can to rescue you and Senior Sister Shi Hong! Forget about repaying me – that was just talk. Don't mention it again!"</p><p>After stopping Tan Hao, Qin Sang went to the jade coffin and investigated Tan Jie's body with his spiritual sense.</p><p>Tan Jie's physical wounds had healed, but the most serious problem was his soul. Like Brother Jiang, it was slowly dissipating.</p><p>After a thorough examination, he asked Tan Hao, "Have you consulted experts skilled in alchemy and medicine?"</p><p>"Yes,"</p><p>Tan Hao nodded. "Before Tan Jie's condition worsened, the necessary spirit medicines weren't that much, and the pressure wasn't too great. I heard that the Spirit Pill Pavilion in Yinshan Pass is owned by the Taiyi Pill Pavilion, and they have alchemists from the Taiyi Pill Sect, but their fees are exorbitant. I saved up for almost ten years, accumulating enough spirit stones, and took Tan Jie to the Spirit Pill Pavilion to see an alchemist."</p><p>Qin Sang quickly asked, "What did he say?"</p><p>Tan Hao's eyes darkened, and he said helplessly, "That person only glanced at him and declared Tan Jie beyond saving. He told me that even if we used all the treasured spirit pills of the Taiyi Pill Sect, we couldn't save him. At most, we could let him live a few more years in a daze, and he advised me to give up and not waste any more effort."</p><p>"But you persevered,"</p><p>Qin Sang said with deep emotion.  In the Xiaohan Region, the conclusion of an alchemist from the Taiyi Pill Pavilion was almost impossible to overturn, unless a miracle happened.</p><p>"How could I give up on him?"</p><p>Tan Hao clenched his fists, his tiger eyes filled with tears. He murmured, "If I had persisted a little longer that day, it would have been me who cultivated the Yama Banner! My brother…he died in my place! How could I give up on him?!"</p><p>"No matter what, I can't give up on him!"</p>
