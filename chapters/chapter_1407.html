<h1>Chapter 1399  The Myriad Spirits Fruit</h1><p>“What legend?”</p><p>Qin Sang pressed.</p><p>Master Mu chuckled, “Legend says the Fire Jade Centipede, a spirit insect born with the ability to find treasure, possesses an unparalleled and exceptional sensitivity to its target. Even if the treasure is sealed by spirit formations or restrictions, it cannot block their perception. Fellow Daoist, you’ve lived with the Fire Jade Centipede for a while, you should have some understanding, right? I wonder if the legend is exaggerated.”</p><p>Qin Sang recalled past experiences.</p><p>The Fire Jade Centipede first displayed its ability in an ancient cultivator's relic, finding the Vermilion Gold Vine and the Red Fire Gilded Metal.</p><p>The Vermilion Gold Vine was hidden by ancient cultivators using restrictions, but the Fire Jade Centipede easily saw through it—at that time, it was only in its first transformation!</p><p>The second time was at the Xu Ling Sect, sensing the Fire Jade within the forbidden area.</p><p>Its performance did indeed seem to somewhat match the legend's description.</p><p>However, it certainly couldn't be as exaggerated as the legend said; its ability to sense treasures is limited, and it will become increasingly sharp as its cultivation improves.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Fire Jade Centipede is only interested in special fire-attribute treasures; otherwise, I could take it treasure hunting everywhere.</p><p>Seeing Qin Sang nod, Master Mu's joy intensified.  This explained things. “Fellow Daoist, have you heard of the Empty Spirit Sea… Regarding the unique climate of the Empty Spirit Sea, there have always been various accounts. Some experts, with nothing better to do, have tried to explore it, but all have returned empty-handed.  Recently, Daoist Qi unexpectedly discovered some unusual signs, suspecting it to be some ancient ruin, so he invited me to come…”</p><p>Unexpected discovery.</p><p>What a load of nonsense!</p><p>Qin Sang scoffed inwardly, but didn't expose Master Mu directly.</p><p>If he guessed correctly, that ancient ruin was likely related to the Witch Clan!</p><p>“I almost forgot to introduce Daoist Qi! Daoist Qi's ancestors and our founder were close friends, and their descendants have always maintained contact. There’s another Daoist Wang, also invited by Daoist Qi. They also wanted to personally greet you, but I persuaded them to stay at the Empty Spirit Sea to continue observing,” Master Mu’s tone shifted.</p><p>Qin Sang asked back, “It sounds like your exploration of the ruins hasn't been going well?”</p><p>Master Mu sighed, “More than not going well! The three of us have been trapped here for a year, and we haven't even glimpsed the entrance! We've been wandering around outside!”</p><p>“You haven’t even gone inside?” Qin Sang was quite surprised.</p><p>He had initially suspected that the Ba Hua Valley founder obtained the Witch Clan inheritance there, but Master Mu hadn’t even been able to get inside.</p><p>Had he guessed wrong?</p><p>Master Mu nodded, ashamed, “Around the ruins, there’s an array we’ve never seen before, incredibly mysterious. In fact, we still can’t figure out what kind of array it is; whether it’s the work of a cultivator or a natural formation!”</p><p>Qin Sang was secretly startled.</p><p>Three Yuan Ying cultivators had schemed for a year and still didn't know what kind of array it was.</p><p>Then, after listening to Master Mu's description of the spirit array, Qin Sang asked, “Could it be a type of illusion array?”</p><p>Master Mu recalled, “Perhaps, we’ve considered that too. But it shouldn't have any soul-affecting effects; none of the three of us have felt our spirits being influenced.  It's precisely because everything is normal that it's even more bizarre!”</p><p>Qin Sang pondered silently; whether it could affect the soul, he could try it himself.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist wants to use the Fire Jade Centipede’s abilities to break the formation?” Qin Sang couldn't think of a solution.</p><p>If it were a simple illusion array, the Sky Eye Butterfly would be more effective.</p><p>Master Mu nodded, “Precisely! We haven’t been idle this time, thinking hard, and we’ve barely come up with an alternative approach…”</p><p>After a pause, Master Mu finally got to the point, “Although we haven't gone inside, after much investigation and verification, I’ve also found some clues from the founder’s relics. The ancient ruins within the illusion array are very likely to have belonged to a sect that once existed in the Empty Spirit Sea—the Pure Sea Sect! The Pure Sea Sect was a rare Buddhist sect, hidden from the world, extremely mysterious, and little known. The Pure Sea Sect had a Myriad Spirits Fruit tree, which holds immense appeal for spirit insects.  Moreover, the Myriad Spirits Fruit can be used to refine a treasure called Tranquil Spirit Incense.  Burning it before breakthroughs and tribulations can suppress inner demons and stabilize the soul!”</p><p>“Suppress inner demons?”</p><p>Qin Sang exclaimed, his eyes rippling.</p><p>Of course, most of it was an act.  No matter how precious the Tranquil Spirit Incense was, it wasn't comparable to the Jade Buddha; it wouldn't cause Qin Sang to lose his composure.</p><p>But Qin Sang knew the value of such a treasure to cultivators. Cultivators facing imminent tribulation or nearing a breakthrough would be willing to trade any treasure they possessed for a stick of Tranquil Spirit Incense!</p><p>A slight smile played on Master Mu’s lips; he had anticipated Qin Sang’s reaction.</p><p>The Heavenly Tribulation is a life-or-death ordeal that no Yuan Ying cultivator can ignore.  Hearing of the divine Zhen Ling incense, no one could remain unmoved.</p><p>He first poured cold water on Qin Sang's enthusiasm. "The Wan Ling fruit is only one ingredient in the creation of Zhen Ling incense; the other ingredients must be equally rare.  Furthermore, whether the ruins of the Jing Hai sect are intact, or even if the method for creating the incense remains, is still unknown.  If the Wan Ling fruit tree still exists and we can obtain a few fruits, I will be satisfied.  Our ancestor had a teaching: if a spirit insect consumes a Wan Ling fruit, it will not only gain many unknown benefits, but also increase the success rate of the Sheng Ling ritual!"</p><p>So that's it!</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Valley Master Mu, quite interested in the Wan Ling fruit. Her thoughts raced. "Fellow cultivator, you intend to use the Fire Jade Centipede's treasure-finding ability to sense the Wan Ling fruit and locate the entrance to the Jing Hai sect…but it won't be that simple, will it?"</p><p>Firstly, the Fire Jade Centipede's discovery of the Red Fire Gold was possibly not due to the medicinal herb's attraction, but rather because the Red Gold Vine was rooted in the fire vein, absorbing fiery energy, making it inherently a fire-type object that the centipede could sense.</p><p>Secondly,</p><p>even if the Wan Ling fruit is attractive to the Fire Jade Centipede, if the Jing Hai sect's outer formations are as intricate as Valley Master Mu described, the centipede's low cultivation might prevent it from sensing the fruit through the formations.</p><p>Let's hope for the Sky Eye Butterfly.</p><p>Valley Master Mu said, "I've cultivated a similar treasure-finding insect, the Jade Swallowing Bee, but it's inferior to the Fire Jade Centipede, and I couldn't help it beyond its second transformation.  However, from my understanding, this unusual fruit would be a great temptation for any spirit insect with keen senses.  Also, I have a method to temporarily enhance the insect's abilities, boosting the Fire Jade Centipede's perception to near the level of a fourth transformation."</p><p>"What method?" Qin Sang asked urgently, surprised.</p><p>What an unexpected bonus!</p><p>If this could be used on the Sky Eye Butterfly, raising its Sky Eye ability to the fifth transformation, the power would be unimaginable!</p><p>Below the Transformation God realm, anyone would be exposed to Qin Sang.</p><p>Most spirit arrays and restrictions would be unable to impede her progress.</p><p>Her interest in the Hundred Flowers Valley grew. The origin of the Hundred Flowers Valley's ancestor must be extraordinary; they likely obtained a great legacy from the Witch Clan!</p><p>"The Three Spirit Disk King Array!"</p><p>Valley Master Mu replied solemnly.</p><p>---</p><p>---</p><p>I spent three days scratching my head.</p><p>Finally sorted it out, and I will catch up on the missing chapters as soon as possible.</p>
