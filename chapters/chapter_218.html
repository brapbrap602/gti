**Chapter 211: Humanoid Cloud Beast**

"Senior Qin, be careful. There's not only vicious ghosts but also a humanoid cloud beast. Its strength is comparable to a Foundation Stage cultivator. It's been hiding in the dark, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Fellow Daoist Chai was sneak attacked by it, almost fatally wounded."

The Ning-surnamed cultivator was vigilant and sent a sound transmission to remind Qin Sang.

After hearing these words, Qin Sang came to a sudden realization. With just a few vicious ghosts, it wouldn't have been enough to leave Ning and Chai helpless. It turned out that in order to deal with the humanoid cloud beast, they had been unable to escape in time, resulting in more and more vicious ghosts being attracted, trapping them there.

Humanoid cloud beasts were not commonly seen. They were the result of cultivators being contaminated by cloud beast souls, transforming into cloud beasts. Sometimes they were corpses that had changed, while other times they were cultivators yet to die but had their consciousness invaded by cloud beast souls. Without exception, these humanoid cloud beasts were extremely difficult to deal with, and their strength was not inferior to those in their previous lives, and might even be superior. Some cloud beasts could even use the magic treasures that those cultivators had used before death.

His Divine Sense was restricted, unable to investigate everywhere. Furthermore, there were no signs of humanoid cloud beasts within the Ten Yama Formation, so this geist had hidden itself quite well.

"Fellow Daoists, go outside to recuperate and heal. Hurry up and go support Fellow Daoist Yun Qiong." Qin Sang made a gesture with his eyes to the two, seemingly defenselessly turning around to escort the two away.

After taking only two steps, suddenly a cold and gloomy force attacked from behind his back, its speed astonishing as it headed straight for Qin Sang's back.

Qin Sang sneered in his heart, secretly activating the Ebonywood Sword, stabbing it behind him. Sword Qi instantly exploded a dozen feet long, all aimed at that dark shadow.

'Bang!'

The shadow was unable to dodge and was stabbed by the Ebonywood Sword, thrown backward by the enormous force and smashing into a stone wall.

'Swoosh!'

The Ebonywood Sword immediately followed, sword light flashing in the air and dividing into two streams of Sword Qi, forming a sword formation. At that moment, the dark shadow had just rolled up from the ground, about to hide in the darkness again, but the sword formation covered it right on top.

"Go quickly!"

Urged by Qin Sang, Ning and Chai didn't dare hesitate; staying there would only slow Qin Sang down. So they flew outside without looking back. Once they left, Qin Sang called back the Corpse Fiend hiding in the darkness.

The Myriad Machine Sword Formation, together with the Corpse Fiend, firmly trapped the humanoid cloud beast. Qin Sang sensed the situation of the Ten Yama Formation, seeing that the vicious ghosts couldn't make any waves, so this gave him a chance to carefully examine this humanoid cloud beast.

It looked human, but that was about it. It was like someone who had been wind-dried, with only a layer of skin stretched tightly over the bones—more accurately, it was a skeleton covered with a layer of skin.

Qin Sang's gaze shifted and landed on the cloud beast's arm.

There was a grayish-white metal bracelet on its wrist, a magic treasure that should have been used by this person in his previous life. The bracelet had been damaged and had several obvious notches; only one piece remained connected at the notches, making it seem like the bracelet would break if just lightly touched.

Seeing the bracelet, Qin Sang's heart moved and his body flickered as he swept over to the Ten Yama Formation, restraining a vicious ghost and carefully sensing it. As a result, he discovered that the vicious ghost and the bracelet were indeed closely connected.

"A damaged soul-refining magic treasure?"

Qin Sang muttered to himself, secretly thinking that this made sense.

No wonder the Ten Yama Banner could easily devour the vicious ghosts without being countered.

It turned out that the magic treasure was already damaged, so its control over the vicious ghosts was greatly reduced. Furthermore, the cloud beast was a cloud beast, with its intelligence far inferior to those of cultivators in their previous lives. After the vicious ghost was devoured, it simply didn't know how to manipulate the magic treasure to counterattack.

Seeing this scene, Qin Sang had a plan in his mind. The vicious ghosts were not a problem, but that bracelet magic treasure was a good thing for him. As long as he had the Ten Yama Banner devour all of the vicious ghosts in the bracelet, its power would definitely rise to a new level.

This also gave Qin Sang a clear path.

He didn't know if other magic treasures had this characteristic, but since the Ten Yama Banner could directly devour magic treasures to increase its power, it wouldn't be necessary to kill and refine souls. He just needed to devour the soul-refining magic treasures of other Demonic cultivators.

Complete magic treasures would definitely be very expensive and difficult to find. Collecting damaged magic treasures might be easier, after all, what he wanted was just the vicious ghosts and fiends within the magic treasures.

Thinking of this, a look of delight appeared on Qin Sang's face, and he immediately used all of his strength to activate the Ebonywood Sword to swiftly attack the humanoid cloud beast. The Sword Qi increased greatly, being exceptionally flexible, and repeatedly slashed at the humanoid cloud beast's wrist. Finally, its arm was cut off.

The humanoid cloud beast roared again and again.

Just then, with a 'Clang', the bracelet fell to the ground, rolling out to a distance. The humanoid cloud beast leapt to fight for it, but the Corpse Fiend forced it back with a heavy fist. Qin Sang's spiritual power transformed into a large hand and grabbed the bracelet, bringing it in front of his face.

Holding it in his hand and examining it carefully, Qin Sang discovered that the bracelet had not yet completely broken down and still had some power left.

As Qin Sang focused his spiritual sense, he forced his way into the bracelet violently, erasing the mark of the previous master, and claiming ownership of it.
“Retrieve!”
Qin Sang made a gesture of his hand, and the bracelet rose into the air, spinning rapidly. Then, streams of gray-white air emerged from the bracelet. The wicked ghosts roaming outside howled unwillingly as they were taken up by the bracelet one after another. 
Just then, there came a cacophony of footsteps from behind. They heard the voice of a cultivator with the surname Ning, “Senior Mu, Senior Yun Qiong, Senior Qin is just ahead...”
“Got it!”
Mu Yifeng shouted, “Junior Brother Qin, don’t let that humanoid cloud beast get away. I am coming to help!”
Qin Sang frowned. He frantically fed spiritual energy into the bracelet, fully activating the magical weapon, retrieving all the wicked ghosts. Then he made another gesture, and put away the Ten Directions Demon Subjugation Banner into his meditation bag.
After a moment’s hesitation, Qin Sang gave up the idea of retrieving the Specter Corpse but instead ordered it to go farther ahead and circle at the edge of his sensory range.
Mu Yifeng arrived in a flash. He must have cast some spell to make his body look like a ball of fiery red flames, which shielded him from the demonic aura.
Seeing Qin Sang wielding the sword energy easily suppress the humanoid cloud beast, and that it was just a matter of time before victory would be his, Mu Yifeng was reassured. He immediately activated the Divine Edge to help Qin Sang. "I was worried that Junior Brother Qin couldn’t handle those ghost things, but it seems I was being overly anxious.”
“I made Senior Mu worry.”
As they were speaking, Scattered Immortal Yun Qiong and others followed closely. Qin Sang glanced around, and finding there were only six people, and that the cultivator called Kuang Li was missing, he gave Mu Yifeng a look.
Mu Yifeng sighed and said, “Fellow Daoist Kuang Li also encountered a humanoid cloud beast unfortunately and lost his life. I failed to save him in time...”
Qin Sang nodded. Although it seemed easy for him to take care of the humanoid cloud beast, it was a formidable foe to cultivators in the Qi Refining Stage. It was already very fortunate that Ning and his friend had survived.
Thankfully, only one person was lost. They had already gathered eight of them. Even if Yin Xingge met with an accident, they wouldn’t have to worry about being trapped here.
“How come so many humanoid cloud beasts suddenly appeared?”
Qin Sang asked with a frown. “Any news about Fellow Daoist Yin?”
“None!”
Mu Yifeng shook his head, then said secretly to Qin Sang using voice transmission, “Now that we have enough manpower to activate the Astrolabe, I wonder what Junior Fellow Brother Qin thinks. Should we stay or go?”
