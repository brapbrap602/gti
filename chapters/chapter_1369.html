<h1>Chapter 1361: Adamantine Seed</h1><p>"Fellow Daoist Qin, although I mainly cultivate the *Crimson Profound True Scripture*, I first entered the path through swordsmanship and have never slacked off since then. I always believed I had made some achievements in swordsmanship. Only after listening to Fellow Daoist Qin's lecture today did I realize that there are always those more skilled, and heavens beyond heavens! Your insights are unique and insightful, yet they point directly to the true meaning of the Great Dao…"</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator in a crimson robe bowed slightly, cupping his fist at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to these seemingly flattering words, his expression remaining unchanged.</p><p>He recognized this person.</p><p>This person was Jiang Xue, one of Ancestor Chifa's two Nascent Soul disciples.</p><p>The number one righteous Immortal Sect in the Lesser Cold Domain was split into two by them, and they hated each other, fighting for the title of the orthodox Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>The end result was a loss for both sides, as they were taken advantage of by others, suffering heavy losses and beginning to decline.</p><p>While Jiang Xue was flattering Qin Sang, a female cultivator on the other side of the Immortal Platform revealed a look of contempt.</p><p>She was Ancestor Chifa's other disciple, bearing the Dharma name Chi Tan.</p><p>These two were like fire and water, and rarely appeared in the same place except for major events such as the Blood Lake and Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang felt honored that the two of them had personally come to congratulate him today.</p><p>"However…"</p><p>Jiang Xue's tone shifted, becoming serious, "Only listening to Fellow Daoist Qin's lecture, I always feel like there is a layer between me and the Great Dao. I dare to ask Fellow Daoist Qin for guidance, just a brief exchange, I wonder what Fellow Daoist Qin's intentions are?"</p><p>Jiang Xue's cultivation was similar to Qin Sang's, not considered bullying the weak, and judging from his tone, he didn't seem to be looking for trouble.</p><p>Everyone looked at Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Jiang Xue. Discussing mysteries and seeking guidance from each other was normal, but for some reason, he always felt that Jiang Xue had other intentions.</p><p>In recent years, he had only dealt with the affairs of Qingyang Temple and cultivated diligently, single-minded and not concerned with the outside world.</p><p>Unable to figure out Jiang Xue's intentions, but Qin Sang was not afraid, and without hesitation, he nodded in agreement.</p><p>Jiang Xue's expression brightened, he thanked him, and a ball of crimson profound light flew out from between his eyebrows, he said in a deep voice: "Please Fellow Daoist Qin make the first move!"</p><p>Qin Sang was not polite, summoned the Jin Chen Sword, gently shook it, turned into a sword light, the Seven Souls Killing Formation was ready but not released, and with a flash, it stabbed towards the light ball in front of Jiang Xue!</p><p>With the naked eye, nothing could be seen, but those present were all top experts, and they could see the danger of this sword at a glance, and they were worried for Jiang Xue.</p><p>"Well done!"</p><p>Jiang Xue shouted loudly.</p><p>The light ball flickered, condensing inward, revealing a spiritual sword.</p><p>In an instant, the spiritual sword turned into a crimson rainbow, meeting the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>The fluctuation of the spiritual sword was very small, and the sword light was extremely restrained, and other places in the Immortal Platform were not affected in the slightest.</p><p>But all the Nascent Souls could feel that Jiang Xue's sword was not simple, incorporating the *Crimson Profound True Scripture* into swordsmanship, unique!</p><p>He had just said that he had made some achievements in swordsmanship, which was by no means boasting.</p><p>'Clang!'</p><p>The two spiritual swords touched and separated, vaguely a dim light burst out, but before it could spread, it quickly retracted into the body of the Jin Chen Sword.</p><p>This kind of control was already exquisite.</p><p>The Jin Chen Sword remained in place.</p><p>And Jiang Xue's spiritual sword was forced back three feet, and the difference was obvious!</p><p>Jiang Xue took back the spiritual sword and praised, "Fellow Daoist Qin's swordsmanship is profound, I admire it! It's a pity that Junior Nephew Han is not here. Although Junior Nephew Han only has Golden Core cultivation, his attainments in swordsmanship are extremely deep. If he can get Fellow Daoist Qin's guidance, he will definitely make rapid progress."</p><p>The Nascent Souls were surprised, wondering what Jiang Xue meant by suddenly mentioning Junior Nephew Han. Did he want to introduce a disciple to Qin Sang?</p><p>Chi Tan on the other side suddenly became alert.</p><p>"Han…"</p><p>Qin Sang's eyes flashed, and he immediately thought of someone.</p><p>Back then, it was Han the Immortal Master who almost led him into Han Family Fort!</p><p>The Han family was a cultivation family attached to the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>"Is Brother Han at Qingyang Temple?"</p><p>Qin Sang's gaze penetrated the clouds and looked down the mountain.</p><p>Jiang Xue shook his head, "Junior Nephew Han was incredulous after hearing Fellow Daoist Qin's name. Later, after confirming that it was really Fellow Daoist Qin, he was greatly encouraged and often retreated to cultivate diligently, hoping to catch up with your footsteps. I also learned later that Junior Nephew Han and Fellow Daoist Qin actually have this kind of origin, I can only sigh that we were blind and missed Fellow Daoist Qin, this genius, back then!"</p><p>Qin Sang smiled, "If I had the opportunity to join the Pure Yang Sect, my path of cultivation would not have been so difficult."</p><p>The two of them were speaking in riddles here.</p><p>The Nascent Souls were full of doubts. They all knew that Qin Sang was once a disciple of Shaohua Mountain, but they didn't know how he got involved with the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>Chi Tan's expression was solemn, secretly discussing something with Si Di and Yao Jing.</p><p>After the Pure Yang Sect split, she befriended the neighboring Taiyi Alchemy Sect and obtained the support of Daoist Chongyi, while Jiang Xue and Shanxing Sect were mutually supportive, with the shadow of Earl Dongyang behind them.</p><p>After Si Di and Yao Jing took over the Taiyi Alchemy Sect, they followed Daoist Chongyi's will and continued to support Chi Tan.</p><p>The sect master of Shanxing Sect had not been a Nascent Soul for long, and his foundation was far less than that of the Taiyi Alchemy Sect.</p><p>Earl Dongyang had his plans disrupted by Qin Sang, lost his ambition to compete, and Shanxing Sect gradually retreated, making Jiang Xue's situation even more difficult.</p><p>Chi Tan had already seen the dawn of victory, but unexpectedly, Jiang Xue suddenly came up with a 'Junior Nephew Han', which seemed to be deeply involved with Qin Sang.</p><p>…</p><p>Finally, after a small trade fair was held, the Nascent Souls left the discussion with their own thoughts and said goodbye to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang personally saw them off.</p><p>The grand ceremony ended.</p><p>Everything settled.</p><p>Jing Yu was going back to Qianshan Bamboo Sea to train the fat chicken, so she also left with the little demons.</p><p>Qingyang Temple was on the right track and did not require Qin Sang's attention.</p><p>Qin Sang took the white cat and flew towards Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Not long after they entered Peach Blossom Valley, a figure appeared outside the valley, it was Jiang Xue.</p><p>Qin Sang personally came out to greet him.</p><p>An hour later, Jiang Xue flew out of Peach Blossom Valley, half happy and half worried.</p><p>Inside the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang played with the jade cup in his hand, and muttered in his mouth, "Adamantine Seed…"</p><p>Just now, Jiang Xue told Qin Sang about the situation of the Han family head.</p><p>Jiang Xue was worried that the Han family head would recognize the wrong person and did not dare to bring him to visit rashly. Now that he knew it was true, he would definitely let the Han family head visit in the future.</p><p>During the conversation, Qin Sang heard Jiang Xue talk about his grievances with Chi Tan and the Taiyi Alchemy Sect, and understood his intentions.</p><p>Jiang Xue intended to form an alliance with Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang was indifferent. Anyway, even if Jiang Xue fell, it would not be difficult for him to protect the Han family head's life. He did not make any promises and watched Jiang Xue's sincerity.</p><p>Instead, Jiang Xue was tricked by Qin Sang.</p><p>The legendary Ten Great Divine Trees had appeared in the Lesser Cold Domain three times.</p><p>One was the Netherworld Blood Mulberry, but now that the Blood Lake was destroyed, the Netherworld Blood Mulberry that fell into the Blood Lake was probably doomed.</p><p>The second was the Cloud Wanderer's main body, which turned into charred wood in the lightning tribulation.</p><p>The third was an Adamantine Seed!</p><p>Back then, in order to compete for the Adamantine Seed, Ancestor Chifa did not hesitate to use the power of the Pure Yang Sect to brutally destroy the Blood Fiend Sect. Unexpectedly, the Blood Fiend Sect disciple who obtained the Adamantine Seed was very alert and escaped before the sect was destroyed.</p><p>Ancestor Chifa ordered his men to search everywhere, and finally traced it to the desert, where he found a trace suspected to be left by the Blood Fiend Sect disciple, but in the end, he failed to catch him.</p><p>From then on, the Blood Fiend Sect disciple and the Adamantine Seed disappeared completely without a trace.</p>
