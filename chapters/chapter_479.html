Chapter 472: Spatial Storm


A superbly crafted flying sword shot from Qin Sang's brow, accompanied by a deafening roar like thunder, transforming into a lightning bolt before everyone.
In this critical moment, Qin Sang unleashed all his power without reservation.
The Ebony Sword made a stunning appearance.
The awe-inspiring might of the sword's energy and thunder, combined with the aura emanating from the Ebony Sword itself, not only shocked the young man, but also caught the attention of Old Lady Yu, Granny Jing, and Elder Zhang.
In an instant, the Ebony Sword traversed the space between them.
The young man's eyes widened in terror. All he could do was unleash his treasured blade, creating a flurry of blade energy to block the Ebony Sword.
‘Swish!’
A layer of bloody light surged across the Ebony Sword's surface, its light turning into a crimson lightning bolt.
A bloody light splashed out.
The bloody light, carrying an aura of defilement, landed precisely on the treasured blade.
The moment the bloody light touched the blade, the blade energy dissipated instantly, and the blade's bright luster turned into a dull grayish-white, representing decay, at a speed visible to the naked eye.
In a flash, the treasured blade became ordinary iron.
‘Crack!’
The blade shattered!
Even magical treasures would lose their power in a short time if touched by this defiling light, let alone a mere magical weapon.
This high-grade magical weapon had no resistance and was destroyed outright.
The scattered pieces of iron stung the young man's eyes, and the unimpeded Ebony Sword brought him the chilling breath of death.
The young man, his face filled with terror, opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out.
A beam of moonlight descended from the sky, its speed rivaling that of the Ebony Sword.
Granny Jing dared not let the young man unleash the Void Thunder; almost at the same moment Qin Sang decided to use the Ebony Sword, she forcefully activated her treasure.
‘Swish!’
A bright moon suddenly shone, shooting a beam of moonlight that pierced through the spatial illusion created by Elder Zhang's silver robe, landing on the young man, seizing the Void Thunder from his hand.
The Ebony Sword arrived only a moment after the moonlight, about to pierce the young man's heart and kill him instantly.
Seeing the moonlight from Granny Jing's support, Qin Sang relaxed slightly, then had a sudden thought. At the last moment, he forcefully commanded the Ebony Sword to retract its energy and deviate slightly.
‘Pfft!’
Blood sprayed.
The young man watched helplessly as the Ebony Sword approached, his face filled with despair.
The Ebony Sword pierced the young man's body but did not injure his heart, passing close to his vital points.
But the moment it entered the young man's body, Qin Sang secretly activated the Ebony Sword's energy, wreaking havoc on his meridians. This would incapacitate the young man without causing irreparable damage.
If Qin Sang were facing the young man alone, he wouldn't dare take such a risk, but with Granny Jing's help, it was different. The young man, suppressed by the moonlight, was completely defenseless.
The sword energy raged within him, the excruciating pain of severed meridians contorted his face until he finally fell unconscious.
‘Whoosh!’
The Ebony Sword pierced through the young man's chest.
Qin Sang's figure shot up, quickly approaching the young man, but his gaze fell upon Elder Zhang. The Ebony Sword moved with Qin Sang's gaze, its song clear and resonant, heading straight for Elder Zhang.
With the Ebony Sword drawn, there was no need for concealment.
Qin Sang decided to help Granny Jing kill Elder Zhang and Old Lady Yu, aiming for a swift victory to eliminate the threat before things worsened.  He didn't care what happened to Granny Jing; he didn't want to be hunted throughout the entire Xiaohan Domain.
The Ebony Sword was a genuine magical treasure, and even someone as powerful as Elder Zhang wouldn't dare ignore it.
It was a pity that the defiling light was wasted.
The defiling light could only be used once and needed time to recover.
If he'd known that Granny Jing still had the strength to help, he wouldn't have used the defiling light on the young man.  Saving it for Elder Zhang would have been far more effective.
However, Qin Sang didn't regret it. In that situation, he couldn't possibly have held back. If the young man had unleashed the Void Thunder, the consequences would have been far worse.
Unexpectedly, this glance revealed something that caused Qin Sang's expression to drastically change.


Perhaps because Granny Jing was distracted by supporting Qin Sang, the high moon dimmed slightly.  Seizing the opportunity, the Star Master urged the star river to rapidly converge towards the moon.

The star river compressed to its extreme, its power surging, threatening to suppress the moon.

The Star Master gasped, then suddenly pointed at his chest.  His whole body shone with brilliant starlight, echoing the star river. The source of the starlight was countless crystalline chains tightly wrapped around him.

The chains were crystal clear, bright as glass.  They seemed frail, yet were exceptionally strong.  Chain after chain, from head to toe, bound the Star Master tightly, like some cruel torture.

The chains appeared out of nowhere; none were visible before.  His silver hair danced wildly.  The Star Master roared, his behavior bordering on madness.

*Bang!*

A sharp crack; a chain snapped.  Following this, the other chains broke, a large portion shattering instantly.

Simultaneously, the Star Master’s aura surged at an astonishing rate, surpassing the Foundation Establishment stage in the blink of an eye, and continuing to climb.

“The Star Master is suppressing his cultivation with these chains?”  Qin Sang thought to herself, guessing the chains’ purpose.

Then she remembered Granny Jing's earlier words. Qin Sang’s face showed alarm.  She looked closely and discovered that as the Star Master’s aura exploded, surpassing the Foundation Establishment stage, the space around him seemed to be inked black, plunging into extreme darkness.

Within the darkness, subtle fluctuations were faintly visible.  These fluctuations were very subtle, yet alarming to observe, as seemingly imperceptible cracks appeared within the depths of the disturbance.

Granny Jing had said that the space on Fingertip Peak was incredibly fragile.  If intruders used cultivation exceeding the Foundation Establishment stage, at best it would shatter the space, and at worst, it might trigger a spatial storm!

A spatial storm was something even Nascent Soul masters would avoid.  The Star Master suddenly snapping his chains and unleashing his cultivation without restraint – was he courting death?

Soon, the Star Master gave Qin Sang the answer.

The Star Master also knew the terror of a spatial storm.  His eyes showed horror and urgency.  He quickly pointed downwards, and a beam of light fell into the center of the plaza.

The pile of broken stone pillars was shattered to dust by the beam of light, revealing what lay beneath.

In the very center of the plaza was a circular stone platform.

The platform wasn't large, less than two zhang in diameter, slightly raised above the last ring of stones.  The dust on its surface was swept away by the light, revealing its true form.

After countless years, the dark gray stone platform was mottled, exuding an air of endless antiquity.  On its top surface, crude strokes depicted mysterious runes.

The beam of light merged into the platform, completely absorbed without a trace.  The moment after, the runes on the platform shone brightly.
