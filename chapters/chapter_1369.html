<h1>Chapter 1361:  The Diamond's Substance</h1><p>“Daoist Qin, while I primarily cultivate the Crimson Profound Scripture, my initial training was in the way of the sword, a path I have never abandoned. I believed myself to possess some skill in swordsmanship. However, only after hearing Daoist Qin’s discourse today do I understand that there are always greater experts and higher realms! Your insights are unique and yet strike directly at the true meaning of the Dao…”</p><p>A Nascent Soul cultivator in a crimson robe bowed slightly, hands clasped in a gesture of respect towards Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang listened to this seemingly flattering speech with an impassive expression.</p><p>He recognized this man.</p><p>His name was Jiang Xue, one of the two Nascent Soul disciples of the Red-Haired Ancestor.</p><p>The leading righteous sect in Xiaohan Region had been split in two by these men, who now bitterly feud, vying for the title of true successor to the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>The outcome was a double loss. They were exploited by others, suffering heavy casualties and subsequent decline.</p><p>While Jiang Xue praised Qin Sang, a female cultivator at the other end of the viewing platform showed a look of disdain.</p><p>She was the Red-Haired Ancestor's other disciple, known as Chi Qin.</p><p>These two were utterly incompatible, rarely appearing at the same event unless it involved matters of great importance such as the Blood Lake or the Ziwei Palace.</p><p>Qin Sang felt greatly honored by their personal attendance today.</p><p>“However…”</p><p>Jiang Xue’s tone changed, becoming serious. “Listening to Daoist Qin’s teachings, I feel a certain distance from the Dao.  I would be bold enough to request a brief exchange of skills, if Daoist Qin would be so kind?”</p><p>Jiang Xue’s cultivation base was similar to Qin Sang’s—not an instance of the strong bullying the weak.  His tone did not suggest troublemaking.</p><p>Everyone looked to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang glanced at Jiang Xue. Philosophical discussions and mutual exchanges were common, yet he sensed an ulterior motive in Jiang Xue’s actions.</p><p>For years, he had focused solely on the affairs of the Green Sheep Temple and intense cultivation, unconcerned with the outside world.</p><p>Unable to fathom Jiang Xue’s intentions, but fearless, Qin Sang readily agreed.</p><p>Jiang Xue’s face brightened. After thanking him, a crimson light burst from his brow.  In a deep voice, he said, “Daoist Qin, please make the first move!”</p><p>Without hesitation, Qin Sang summoned the Jinchen Sword. A gentle tremor sent it flying as a sword-light, the Seven Souls Killing Array held in reserve, toward the light before Jiang Xue.</p><p>The intricacies were invisible to the naked eye. But those present were top-tier experts, instantly recognizing the danger and feeling a pang of anxiety for Jiang Xue.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Jiang Xue roared.</p><p>The light團 flickered and condensed, revealing a spirit sword.</p><p>In an instant, the spirit sword transformed into a crimson rainbow, meeting the Jinchen Sword.</p><p>The spirit sword’s fluctuations were minimal; its light was extremely restrained, leaving the rest of the platform unaffected.</p><p>Yet, all the Nascent Souls present sensed the extraordinary nature of Jiang Xue’s strike; he had uniquely integrated the Crimson Profound Scripture into his swordsmanship!</p><p>His earlier claim of skill was no boast.</p><p>‘Clang!’</p><p>The two spirit swords met and separated, a faint dark light flaring before quickly receding into the Jinchen Sword.</p><p>The control was exquisite.</p><p>The Jinchen Sword remained motionless.</p><p>Jiang Xue’s spirit sword, however, was forced back three feet, clearly demonstrating the difference in skill.</p><p>Jiang Xue retracted his spirit sword, exclaiming, “Daoist Qin’s swordsmanship is profound; I am in awe!  It’s a pity that Han Shizi isn’t here. Although only at the Golden Core stage, his swordsmanship is extremely profound. With your guidance, Daoist Qin, he would certainly make rapid progress.”</p><p>The Nascent Souls were surprised, unsure of Jiang Xue’s sudden mention of “Han Shizi.”  Was he trying to introduce a disciple to Qin Sang?</p><p>Chi Qin, however, was instantly alerted.</p><p>“Han…”</p><p>Qin Sang’s eyes flashed, recalling someone.</p><p>The Han Xian Shi who had almost led him to Han Manor!</p><p>The Han family was a cultivation family dependent on the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>“Is Brother Han at Green Sheep Temple?”</p><p>Qin Sang’s gaze pierced the clouds towards the mountain below.</p><p>Jiang Xue shook his head. “Han Shizi, upon hearing of Daoist Qin’s reputation, was disbelieving. After confirmation, he was greatly encouraged and has been in secluded cultivation, striving to catch up with you. I only recently learned of the connection between Han Shizi and Daoist Qin; we were truly blind, missing a genius like you back then!”</p><p>Qin Sang chuckled. “Had I joined the Pure Yang Sect, my cultivation journey would surely have been less arduous.”</p><p>The two exchanged veiled allusions.</p><p>The Nascent Souls were full of suspicion. They knew Qin Sang had been a disciple of Shao Hua Mountain but were unaware of his connection to the Pure Yang Sect.</p><p>Chi Qin’s expression was grave, secretly consulting with Si Di and Yao Jing.</p><p>Following the Pure Yang Sect’s split, she had cultivated a good relationship with the neighboring Taiyi Dan Sect, receiving support from Daoist Chong Yi, while Jiang Xue had formed a mutual alliance with the Mountain Shape Sect, with the shadow of Duke Dongyang behind them.</p><p>Si Di and Yao Jing, having taken over Taiyi Danzong, continued to support Chi Tan, following the wishes of Chong Yi Daozhang.</p><p>The head of Shanxing Gate had only recently formed their golden core, their foundation far inferior to Taiyi Danzong.</p><p>Dong Yang Bo, his plans disrupted by Qin Sang, had lost his ambition. Shanxing Gate showed signs of retreat, leaving Jiang Xue in an increasingly precarious position.</p><p>Chi Tan had almost tasted victory, but then Jiang Xue unexpectedly introduced a "Junior Nephew Han," seemingly deeply connected to Qin Sang.</p><p>...</p><p>Finally, a small trade fair concluded the discourse.  The Golden Core cultivators, each with their own thoughts, bid farewell to Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang saw them off personally.</p><p>The ceremony ended.</p><p>Everything settled down.</p><p>Jing Yu, needing to return to Qianshan Bamboo Sea to train the fat chicken, left with his little monsters.</p><p>Qingyang Temple was running smoothly, requiring no further attention from Qin Sang.</p><p>Qin Sang, accompanied by her white cat, flew towards Peach Blossom Valley.</p><p>Shortly after their arrival, Jiang Xue appeared outside the valley.</p><p>Qin Sang personally greeted him.</p><p>An hour later, Jiang Xue left Peach Blossom Valley, a mixture of hope and worry evident on his face.</p><p>Inside the cave dwelling,</p><p>Qin Sang played with a jade cup, murmuring, "King Kong Shi..."</p><p>Earlier, Jiang Xue had informed Qin Sang about the situation with the Han Family Head.</p><p>Fearing the Han Family Head might be mistaken about his identity, Jiang Xue hadn't dared to bring him directly. Now knowing the truth, he planned to arrange a formal visit.</p><p>During their conversation, Qin Sang learned about Jiang Xue's grievances with Chi Tan and Taiyi Danzong, understanding his intentions.</p><p>Jiang Xue aimed to forge an alliance with Qingyang Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang remained noncommittal.  Even if Jiang Xue perished, protecting the Han Family Head wouldn't be difficult for her.  She made no promises, preferring to observe Jiang Xue's sincerity.</p><p>Instead, Qin Sang extracted information from Jiang Xue.</p><p>Legend spoke of ten divine trees that had appeared in Xiaohan Region three times.</p><p>First, the Interminable Blood Mulberry, now likely lost with the destruction of Blood Lake.</p><p>Second, the body of Yunyouzi, reduced to charcoal by a lightning tribulation.</p><p>Third, a King Kong Shi!</p><p>In the past, to obtain the King Kong Shi, the Red-haired Ancestor had mobilized the entire Pure Yang Sect to obliterate the Blood Nether Sect.  However, the Blood Nether Sect disciple who possessed the King Kong Shi was exceptionally alert, escaping before the sect's annihilation.</p><p>The Red-haired Ancestor dispatched his men to search extensively, even tracing the disciple's possible trail to the desert.  Despite finding potential clues, they failed to apprehend him.</p><p>Thereafter, the Blood Nether Sect disciple and the King Kong Shi vanished without a trace.</p>
