<h1>Chapter 249: Threat</h1><p>Chapter 249: Threat</p><p>The Crimson Golden Vine changed.</p><p>Just as Qin Sang suspected, the moment the Hermit Di Que picked the fruit, the monkeys saw through his disguise.</p><p>Their roars were like thunder, almost flipping the cave over!</p><p>At once, all the flying monkeys forgot about Qin Sang and glared in unison at the Hermit Di Que in the center of the lake. Their eyes blazed with rage and violence.</p><p>Among them, those divine monkeys cultivated by Qin Sang exuded an aura no less powerful than the Hermit Di Que's!</p><p>A great battle was imminent!</p><p>Everything was going according to Qin Sang's plan, but when his gaze passed over the great lake and found the Hermit Di Que, he discovered that the Hermit Di Que was paying no attention to anything. Instead, he was staring straight at him.</p><p>Their gazes met in the air. The Hermit Di Que's face showed no panic and was instead curved in a mocking smile.</p><p>Qin Sang's heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Then, in the sea of consciousness, the wisp of Thousand Illusions Divine Melody left behind by the Hermit Di Que quivered slightly. The Hermit Di Que's voice sounded like a bolt from the blue:</p><p>"I didn't think I'd sense a Heart-Devouring Worm's aura from Brother Qin's sea of consciousness. It's been a long time! As far as I know, controlling the sea of consciousness with Heart-Devouring Worms is a technique unique to the Kuiyin Sect. Brother Qin's identity isn't simple!"</p><p>Qin Sang's expression changed dramatically, and his body suddenly froze. His hands and feet grew cold.</p><p>When the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody invaded his sea of consciousness, he concealed the Heart-Devouring Worm with his divine consciousness, but it was seen through by the Hermit Di Que. Was he someone from the Kuiyin Sect?</p><p>No, that couldn't be!</p><p>If the Hermit Di Que was from the Kuiyin Sect, with his cultivation, he would definitely be able to manipulate the Heart-Devouring Worm Gu and should have discovered his identity outside the Relics.</p><p>Listening to his tone, he hadn't discovered the Heart-Devouring Worm but had sensed its aura in his sea of consciousness. This meant that this person had seen a Heart-Devouring Worm before and knew that it was handiwork of the Kuiyin Sect.</p><p>To Qin Sang, the Heart-Devouring Worm could be considered his biggest secret apart from the Jade Buddha. If his identity was exposed, even if he escaped the cave now, as soon as the Hermit Di Que revealed it to Mount Shaohua, he would be purged.</p><p>The only good news was that the Hermit Di Que didn't intend to kill him.</p><p>In the Hermit Di Que's view, he was a spy who had already infiltrated Mount Shaohua.</p><p>If he had other intentions, then it was definitely more valuable for him to be alive than dead.</p><p>Qin Sang's mind was in turmoil. He felt like he was rooted to the ground and didn't dare to budge an inch.</p><p>Suddenly, the Hermit Di Que moved. His figure shot out like lightning, flying toward the outside of the lava lake.</p><p>Just as the monkeys were about to surround the Hermit Di Que, the sea of fire Qin Sang had created changed. In the midst of the storm, the formidable power of the Divine Melody manifested. It was wrapped in a conch-shaped magic treasure.</p><p>Qin Sang hadn't sensed the conch's existence before.</p><p>The conch magic treasure blared, and the power of the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody, aided by the magic treasure, surged with astonishing speed.</p><p>The Thousand Illusions Divine Melody Qin Sang had controlled before was only a small part of this power, like an iceberg in water. The greater portion had been hiding in the dark until now.</p><p>This concealment was impeccable. Qin Sang hadn't noticed it, and neither had the Fire Flying Monkeys!</p><p>At the beginning, when the Hermit Di Que ordered him to scout the way, Qin Sang had found it a bit strange.</p><p>The Thousand Illusions Divine Melody the Hermit Di Que gave him was a Nascent Soul Stage technique, but as a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he had been able to control it so easily and effortlessly as if it were nothing. It didn't make sense.</p><p>Later, he had scouted the way several times and encountered many dangers, including life-threatening crises. The Thousand Illusions Divine Melody hadn't reacted at all. Every time, Qin Sang relied on his own quick thinking to turn the crisis around.</p><p>This had led Qin Sang to suspect a little less and, perhaps out of wishful thinking, assume that the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody was special and could be lent to others.</p><p>After all, auditory techniques were rare, so it was possible that there were strange abilities he didn't know about.</p><p>Now, he realized that the power had always been within the Hermit Di Que's control. He had pretended to focus all his attention on sensing the flying monkeys' energy fluctuations but had actually been capable of controlling the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody at the same time.</p><p>Qin Sang's ability to control the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody was just an illusion created by the Hermit Di Que!</p><p>Realizing this, Qin Sang's expression became extremely bitter. He had thought he had created a powerful enemy for the Hermit Di Que, but in fact, he was merely bait, helping the Hermit Di Que gather the majority of the monkeys together.</p><p>In particular, all the flying monkeys in the lava lake that had fused together had been attracted by Qin Sang. When the conch emerged from the water, its power instantly surged, and the Thousand Illusions Divine Melody transformed into ropes that rapidly wrapped around the flying monkeys. It then tightened, instantly binding them all.</p><p>At this moment, a large pupa suddenly appeared at the edge of the Lava Lake.</p><p>Fierce Fly Monkeys were struggling violently inside the pupa, causing it to heave up and down as if it were alive. It seemed to be breathing.</p><p>This seal could not last. In no time at all, countless cracks appeared on it, threatening to tear it apart. However, because of the pupa, there was a brief gap in the monkey horde.</p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p>The pupa was smashed into a million pieces, and the Divine Monkey gave chase.</p><p>Old Man Dique was still unable to escape the lava at this moment. His gaze was cold as he looked at the countless stick figures above. Suddenly, he uttered a word like thunder, "Halt!"</p><p>The seashell trembled violently, and the divine sound transformed into a shield.</p><p>The stick figures crashed into the sound shield in unison.</p><p>Old Man Dique's face turned pale, and his body flew backward like a cannonball. However, this went according to his plan. He used the seashell to clear a path and fell out of the Lava Lake, crashing against the Rock Cave's wall.</p><p>He stood up straight, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and glanced at the furious Monkey Horde in the Lava Lake with a sinister smile. He then opened his hand and looked at the intact fruit, letting out a few loud bursts of laughter.</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Old Man Dique's actions with indifference.</p><p>Old Man Dique ignored Qin Sang. With one hand, he held the Scarlet Goldenvine Fruit, and with the other, he carefully condensed his spiritual power into a sharp blade, which he used to jab at the skin of the fruit. Unexpectedly, the Scarlet Goldenvine Fruit was extremely hard, and Old Man Dique tried several times in succession, increasing his strength each time, but it remained unharmed.</p><p>He had not expected the fruit to be so hard that even a Nascent Soul Stage cultivator could not do anything about it.</p><p>Old Man Dique frowned and rubbed his palms over the fruit while he thought deeply. After a long pause, he suddenly had a flash of inspiration and hurriedly took out a jade slip, which he pressed against his forehead.</p><p>After a short while, Old Man Dique opened his eyes. His gaze held a trace of surprise as he looked at the fruit. He then stretched out his finger and quickly used his spiritual power to draw strange runes on its surface.</p><p>Qin Sang stood to one side, suppressing the unease in his heart.</p><p>He was also very curious about the fruit and stared intently. He discovered that he had never seen any of these runes before. They seemed to have a touch of the meaning of Artifact Refining, but there was also a hint of Alchemy, making them extremely strange.</p><p>One after another, the runes blended into the fruit, and Old Man Dique's movements became faster and faster. The fruit finally began to change.</p><p>It was as if ordinary mortal fruit, slowly rotting in the natural world, were now rotting millions of times faster before Qin Sang's eyes.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the golden skin's luster dimmed and turned to a dark gold, then a dull gray, and finally, it turned completely black and shattered, revealing the flesh inside.</p>
