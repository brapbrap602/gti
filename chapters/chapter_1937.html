<h1>Chapter 1928: The Unfading Bone</h1><p>“What is a Ghost Cloud Colt?”</p><p>Zhu Que heard of this demonic beast for the first time. Remembering that Luo Hou was still a spirit, she suddenly understood.  “You want to take over its body?”</p><p>Luo Hou was severely injured by Qin Sang years ago and hadn’t found a suitable host body. She was unwilling to compromise, so she waited until now.</p><p>Luo Hou neither confirmed nor denied this, replying, “The Ghost Cloud Colt’s bloodline has some compatibility with my own clan.”</p><p>If she were to possess a body, she didn't need to insist on the Shadow Horse clan; she could choose a similar bloodline as a host.</p><p>Luo Hou had several options, and the Ghost Cloud Colt was one of them.</p><p>Luo Hou's expression showed some hesitation. Firstly, this Ghost Cloud Colt's bloodline was thin, and secondly, it wasn't the best choice; it was only mediocre.</p><p>However, the demonic beasts chosen by Luo Hou, including the Ghost Cloud Colt, were all extremely rare. It took her a long time to find one.</p><p>Deep within the Mulu Mountains, there might be better choices. She considered herself a defeated general.  Surviving and becoming a mountain spirit guardian was already fortunate; how could she dare ask her master to make a special trip to find a body for her?</p><p>Furthermore, the situation in the Mulu Mountains was complex, full of dangers with many powerful cultivators.</p><p>With only her spirit remaining, her strength was weakened. While she could easily handle a demonic cultivator like the Golden-winged Roc, she was at a disadvantage against those of her own level, and dared not venture into the Mulu Mountains alone.</p><p>Encountering a Ghost Cloud Colt was a small stroke of luck.</p><p>Possessing the Ghost Cloud Colt, though not as compatible as other demonic beasts, still offered a chance of restoring her to her peak, but it would require more effort.</p><p>If she missed this opportunity, she didn't know how long she would have to wait.  Lacking a body had a significant impact on her cultivation; the sooner she possessed one, the better.</p><p>“What are you waiting for? Go, go, go!”</p><p>Zhu Que urged repeatedly, clamoring, “I’ll deal with this guy.  How dare it call itself a Demon Emperor in front of this divine bird? Let it know the might of this divine bird!”</p><p>Zhu Que rubbed her claws together, her tone arrogant.</p><p>Luo Hou didn't move, hesitating, “But, Master…”</p><p>“Why worry about that?  Will Qin ever stop you from taking over a body? He brought you down the mountain to help you recover, otherwise why wouldn't he bring that fox?”</p><p>Zhu Que, with a little bit of cunning, her eyes rolled, guessing Luo Hou's concerns, suddenly cackled with laughter.</p><p>“Cackle… You actually believed him? He claims not to kill, isn't it to help Xiao Wu to dissipate his demonic intent?  He didn't specifically instruct us to show mercy. Do you think Qin is an inflexible pedant, or do you really think your master is a great benevolent person?”</p><p>“Cackle, cackle, cackle…”</p><p>Zhu Que seemed to have heard a huge joke and laughed heartily.</p><p>Following Qin Sang's travels, she had learned many new words, such as ‘pedant’.</p><p>The laughter reached the Golden-winged Roc's ears, igniting his anger.</p><p>The opponent was pursuing him, yet dared to chat and laugh incessantly, a great humiliation.</p><p>Luo Hou remained hesitant. Since Qin Sang descended the mountain, he had been slaying demons and monsters, causing rivers of blood. Taking over someone else's body was undoubtedly the act of a demon, even though the Ghost Cloud Colt had certainly killed many people.</p><p>Unlike Zhu Que, she didn't have the privilege to ignore Qin Sang's words.</p><p>“Hey, I didn't expect you to be so timid!  Can you do it or not? Just ask Qin! Quickly capture that Ghost Colt and don't let it escape!”</p><p>Zhu Que flapped her wings, condensing a fiery feather into a crimson streak of light, breaking through the air.</p><p>Luo Hou left the Golden-winged Roc to Zhu Que, leaped, and pounced towards the Ghost Cloud Colt.</p><p>Zhu Que shook her wings, glanced sideways at the enraged Golden-winged Roc, and let out a cackling laugh.</p><p>“You are doomed!”</p><p>Zhu Que, having learned more elegant words from the mortal world, roared, her whole body burning with flames, and pounced on the Golden-winged Roc.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>The Golden-winged Roc was defiant in words, but didn't turn around.  However, he was easily overtaken by Zhu Que. As soon as they engaged, he realized something was wrong.</p><p>Zhu Que seemed to only have the cultivation of a late-stage Nascent Soul, comparable to the Golden-winged Roc, but she definitely couldn't be regarded as an ordinary demonic beast.</p><p>Moreover, the Demon Emperor had just suffered a blow from Luo Hou and was already injured. He quickly fell into a disadvantage, swallowed by the overwhelming flames.</p><p>The palace was breached, and the Demon Emperor was overwhelmed.</p><p>Other demonic beasts acted independently, a disorganized mess, unable to mount a decent offensive. They retreated steadily, escape itself a distant hope.</p><p>Luo Hou, capturing the Ghost Cloud Steed, moved like a phantom, clearing the battlefield. The demons could only surrender.</p><p>Above the capital city, Zhuque and the Demon Emperor clashed.</p><p>“No one interfere!”</p><p>Zhuque's roar echoed through the flames.  She had finally gotten a chance to fight, and she intended to have some fun.</p><p>“Senior Luo, what should we do now?”</p><p>A cultivator approached.</p><p>Luo Hou watched for a moment, confirming the Golden-winged Roc couldn't escape.  “Let the Divine Bird play. We’ll reinforce elsewhere! Go!”</p><p>“Play?”</p><p>The crowd exchanged bewildered glances.  To simply 'play' against a late-stage transformed demon was unbelievable!</p><p>Reinforcements arrived, and the other two battlefields fell swiftly.</p><p>Three demonic nests were destroyed overnight.</p><p>Finally, everyone rushed to the capital of Wanling Kingdom.  The battle wasn't over, but the Golden-winged Roc was spent.</p><p>‘Boom!’</p><p>A fiery blast struck the ground like a meteor, destroying half the palace in a earth-shattering explosion!</p><p>When the flames subsided,</p><p>everyone saw a small Zhuque standing on the head of the Golden-winged Roc, which was vastly larger.</p><p>Zhuque preened her feathers, surveying the scene with pride.</p><p>Amidst the praise, her little head tilted higher and higher, her beak almost touching the sky.</p><p>Su Xuan and others cleaned up the aftermath. The three demons, their task complete, departed.</p><p>Zhuque stopped Luo Hou, shaking a fiery feather. “Your master has agreed.  Don't delay the body snatching. What are you waiting for?”</p><p>“Please, both Daoists, protect my cultivation!”</p><p>Luo Hou didn't question the truth, acting decisively. She landed on a mountaintop with the Ghost Cloud Steed.</p><p>Zhuque and Taiyi guarded her, one on each side.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day at noon.</p><p>The three demons returned to Taiyi's cave.</p><p>Qin Sang was studying the Taiyi Thunderbolt Talisman.  Seeing Luo Hou, he was surprised.  “You found a body yourself? I was planning to go to Mulu Mountain anyway. This saves trouble. Take these pills. Adapt to your new body and recover your strength quickly.”</p><p>He tossed a jade bottle.</p><p>Inside were three extremely valuable pills, obtained from a demon king's remains, specifically created for demon cultivation.  They would greatly benefit Luo Hou.</p><p>Luo Hou realized Qin Sang had remembered her all along. She immediately knelt and kowtowed, grateful.  “Thank you, Master, for the pills.”</p><p>“Hee hee, I told you he wouldn't refuse.  You insisted on asking…”</p><p>Zhuque hopped onto Luo Hou's shoulder, smug.</p><p>“Asking?”</p><p>Qin Sang looked at Zhuque.</p><p>Zhuque quickly covered her mouth, her eyes darting around. She turned to run towards the exit, but a powerful force yanked her back, causing her to scream.</p><p>“Luo Hou needs to focus on refining her body. She’s no longer suitable as a mount. You'll take over.”</p><p>Qin Sang ignored the screams, raising a finger. Zhuque's body blazed with fire.</p><p>“Master…”</p><p>Luo Hou opened her mouth, but Qin Sang’s glance silenced her.</p><p>Soon, a large red-feathered bird soared into the sky, carrying everyone, leaving behind a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p>“Ah! I, the noble Zhuque!”</p><p>…</p><p>Fire Domain, Daoist Temple.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body awoke from meditation and calculated with his fingers, murmuring, “It's almost time for my meeting with the Yun Ding City Lord.”</p><p>Restoring his foundation was no longer a problem. Qin Sang needed to prioritize his cultivation.</p><p>Rushing into the Dao of Killing was unwise.</p><p>Seeking the Dao, the most important thing was understanding it.  Enlightenment was that understanding.</p><p>His main body wouldn't fare better than his avatar.</p><p>Letting his avatar continue traveling the world, searching for opportunities, was the best choice.</p><p>Qin Sang's main body needed to quickly achieve power comparable to a Nascent Soul cultivator.</p><p>Many of his previous abilities and treasures were insufficient.</p><p>Especially his three supremely powerful Buddha seals, his most important tools before the Nascent Soul stage, were now limited by his physical strength.</p><p>Comprehending Thunder techniques wouldn't bring quick success, unless the Thunder Altar provided a breakthrough.</p><p>He had two choices.</p><p>Quickly increase his physical strength, breaking through the sixth layer of the *Heavenly Demon Transformation*.</p><p>Or comprehend the Seven Mansion Star Division Sword Array, using the *Purple Micro Sword Scripture* and Tian Yue's sword light to create a sword domain.</p><p>Even a hint of the sword domain's essence would give him a huge advantage against a Nascent Soul cultivator!</p><p>A breakthrough in swordsmanship would undoubtedly lead to a significant increase in strength, but it would undoubtedly be extremely difficult.</p><p>For over three hundred years, Qin Sang had often pondered how to approach this.</p><p>Gradually, Qin Sang developed a plan, but it hadn't been tested yet.</p><p>The words of the Sky Transcendent Elder had subtly guided him.</p><p>Using a sword array to emulate the celestial constellations was a daunting task, something Qin Sang knew he wasn't ready to attempt yet.</p><p>Creating a celestial constellation sword array required a gradual approach. He planned to emulate the Seven Mansions sword array, gradually constructing the Southern, Eastern, and Northern Seven Mansions.</p><p>With the Four Symbols complete, he would achieve the Four Symbols Sword Array!</p><p>That would be a small success.  Then he would go on to incorporate the Sun, Moon, and Nine Luminaries, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, the Great Forbidden Enclosure, and the Heavenly Market Enclosure, ultimately achieving the complete Celestial Constellation Sword Array.</p><p>It was an ambitious plan, and Qin Sang wasn't sure he could complete it before reaching the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p>Images flashed through Qin Sang's mind – memories from his time in the Divine Court.</p><p>He recalled the Western White Tiger star region from when he was being pursued by the demon king.</p><p>And the time when the Thunder Ancestor possessed him, granting him control over Heaven and Earth, allowing him to crush both the Divine Court and the world beneath his feet.</p><p>This intense experience seemed to have imprinted a faint understanding of the Divine Court, the four star regions, the Three Enclosures, and the Twenty-Eight Mansions.</p><p>His consciousness was clouded at the time, and the subsequent ordeals had left these impressions very faint.</p><p>Qin Sang was uncertain how much he could glean from these memories, but if he could gain even a little insight, using the essence of the Divine Court to construct his sword array, it would greatly increase his efficiency.</p><p>It was certainly a shortcut compared to directly observing the ethereal celestial constellations.</p><p>Of course, if he could make a breakthrough with the *Demonic Transformation*, he could also gain immense power from the Three Buddha Seals.</p><p>Qin Sang tapped his fingers against his knee.</p><p>He had previously requested the Cloud Tripod City lord to gather potent poisons for him; the time to collect them was approaching.</p><p>The *Poison God Scripture* was secondary. Qin Sang mused that he should focus on comprehending the Dharma Image, for deeper understanding would lead to a natural breakthrough when he hit a bottleneck.</p><p>Different paths had their points of intersection. As a Nascent Soul cultivator, his understanding of the harmony between Heaven and Man would greatly benefit his comprehension of the Dharma Image.</p><p>‘Whoosh!’</p><p>A gale erupted in the cave.</p><p>Qin Sang summoned his Dharma Image.</p><p>Qin Sang looked up at the Azure Bird Dharma Image, carefully sensing its essence.</p><p>Previously, he had received guidance from Left Senior, learning about the inner and outer realms in the cultivation of physical arts. However, the concepts remained rather hazy.</p><p>Now, Qin Sang grasped their true meaning to some degree.</p><p>For Nascent Soul cultivators specializing in Dharma, controlling the energy of Heaven and Earth centered around mastery.</p><p>For physical cultivators, the transformation from the inner to the outer realm, also a form of harmony between Heaven and Man, involved absorbing Heaven and Earth into oneself, making oneself the center.</p><p>It was as if they were absorbing the energy of Heaven and Earth, replenishing themselves, creating their own inner world, which in turn affected the true world.</p><p>What about the Yang God?</p><p>Was it about using Heaven and Earth as the root, the divine soul actively merging with Heaven and Earth?</p><p>The most extreme path—was it to abandon the self, entrusting oneself to Heaven and Earth, existing as one with them?</p><p>This seemed somewhat similar to the paths of deities rooted in mountain ranges or reliant on offerings of incense.</p><p>Qin Sang pondered this, recalling the Yang God that had attacked him in the Divine Court, a figure as elusive as a ghost, moving with such imperceptible speed that it was hard to see how he had appeared before him.</p><p>Did these three distinct paths represent the three ultimate routes for mortals seeking the Dao, with further subdivisions and derivations giving rise to various paths?</p><p>These were the fruits of Qin Sang's relentless contemplation.</p><p>He knew there were many flaws, but it didn't matter. With further cultivation, he would gradually refine his understanding and grasp the true nature of the Dao.</p><p>This process was a journey of seeking the Dao, a transformation, and an elevation of the self!</p><p>“Dao! Dao! Dao!”</p><p>Qin Sang repeated the word incessantly.</p><p>The higher the realm, the greater the importance of the Dao, and the less influential innate talent became.</p><p>By the Nascent Soul stage, who cared if you had five spiritual roots?</p><p>Of course, the speed of comprehension was also a form of talent.</p><p>Some achieve enlightenment instantly, while others struggle their whole lives.</p><p>“This must be what they call insight? Yet, its level surely can't dictate future achievements. It can be supplemented by external means, by receiving enlightenment.”</p><p>Qin Sang stared at the Azure Bird Dharma Image.</p><p>The Dharma Image is simply an external manifestation of inner-world power. With his Nascent Soul-level understanding, his insight into the Dharma Image would undoubtedly surpass that of ordinary people.</p><p>Qin Sang silently cultivated the *Demonic Transformation*.</p><p>Several days later.</p><p>The cave's stone door opened, and Qin Sang emerged, refreshed and invigorated.  He instructed Gui Hou to guard the home, then flew out of the training grounds.</p><p>He flew leisurely across the Fire Domain to Cloud Capital Mountain, observing the changes below.</p><p>It seemed that in the past two hundred years, Cloud Capital Mountain had not changed, at least superficially it was extremely peaceful.</p><p>Under Cloud Capital Heaven's rule, Cloud Capital Mountain enjoyed lasting peace, a blessing for the cultivators.</p><p>Cloud Tripod City.</p><p>Qin Sang only visited the celestial city every few decades, but every guard knew his name.</p><p>Upon entering the city, the guard commander personally led him to the highest level of Cloud Tripod City.</p><p>The City Lord himself came out to greet him.</p>
