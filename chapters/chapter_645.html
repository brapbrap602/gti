Chapter 637: Blackwind Valley


Patriarch Cui Xuanzi glanced back into the main hall. Seeing Qin Sang's indifferent demeanor, his expression flickered. Ultimately, he didn't dare to say anything and glowered towards the mountain gate.

As the protective formation shimmered into existence, the incoming streaks of light slowed, revealing a group of men and women who landed on a towering peak just outside the Five Vermin Sect's gate.

Some, like Cui Xuanzi, wore simple attire.

But most, similar to the shamans of the Winged Serpent Tribe, had their faces and bodies adorned with mystical tattoos and wore various bone and tooth ornaments.

With each new arrival, Cui Xuanzi's face darkened.

Finally, when all the streaks of light had faded, the group stood facing the Five Vermin Sect, separated by the protective formation.

They were divided into two distinct factions, one led by a gaunt old man and the other by a seductive woman. However, their purpose was the same: to confront the Five Vermin Sect.

Both the old man and the woman were late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, their auras indicating they were nearing Core Formation. Individually, they were weaker than Cui Xuanzi, who was at the pseudo-Core Formation stage. But if they joined forces, Cui Xuanzi's only option would be to flee.

Just then, a figure hurriedly flew to the main hall. It was Junior Brother Tong.

He peeked inside and looked at Cui Xuanzi inquiringly. Seeing Cui Xuanzi shake his head slightly, his expression dimmed. He spoke urgently, "Senior Brother, Elder Lei of the Thunderclap Fortress and the Old Hag of the Hundred Flowers Palace have arrived. There are also a few shady characters I've never seen before; they must be reinforcements. It seems they are determined to break the pact left by our Grand Uncle and seize Blackwind Valley…"

"I see them," Cui Xuanzi snorted. "However, Junior Brother Tong, do you think they are the only ones?"

Junior Brother Tong was taken aback as Cui Xuanzi raised his wooden staff and pointed south of the Five Vermin Sect.

Not far south lay the Jade Belt River, also known as the Green Robe River. The morning sun was just rising, and a thin mist still lingered over the water, obscuring the view.

Junior Brother Tong strained his eyes and saw shadowy figures within the mist by the riverbank, barely visible unless one looked carefully.

Downstream the Green Robe River was the territory of the Bear Mountain tribes.

Understanding dawned on Junior Brother Tong. He knew exactly who was hiding there.

"Those ungrateful wretches!" Junior Brother Tong gritted his teeth. "They rely on us to maintain peace in the Bear Mountain region and even share in the spirit stones from Blackwind Valley. It's all been for nothing! If our Five Vermin Sect is destroyed, aren't they afraid of inviting the wolf into the sheepfold?"

Cui Xuanzi sighed. "A serpent swallows an elephant out of greed. They receive spirit stones, but Grand Uncle insisted on giving the Poison Spring to our Five Vermin Sect. Back then, with Grand Uncle's influence, they dared not complain, even if they were dissatisfied.  Over the years, with no news from Grand Uncle and our sect weakening, they've been scheming and colluding with outsiders. However, they wouldn't dare to openly betray us. They're just trying to fish in troubled waters and force us to concede. Therefore, there's no need to send a message. We must face this tribulation alone."

As they spoke, shouts echoed from outside the mountain gate.

"Old Man Cui Xuan, hiding in your shell, not even daring to show your face. What, is everyone in the Five Vermin Sect a turtle?" Elder Lei amplified his voice with a spell, his mocking laughter reverberating through the mountains.

The disciples of the Five Vermin Sect heard it clearly, their teeth grinding with rage, wanting nothing more than to tear his mouth apart.

"Hee hee…" the seductive woman giggled, her laughter melodious yet laced with venom. "The Five Vermin Sect disciples are all turtles, so pitiful. Why not join our Hundred Flowers Palace? Our disciples are all loyal and virtuous women…"

Her voice carried an alluring charm, and some of the weaker-willed disciples blushed, revealing their vulnerability.

"Silence!" Cui Xuanzi roared, snapping the disciples out of their daze. He leaped onto the edge of the protective formation and said sternly, "You cultivators from two regions have come to attack my sect and insult us. What is your purpose?"

Elder Lei sneered, "Old Man Cui Xuan, you know very well why we're here! You've occupied Blackwind Valley long enough."

Cui Xuanzi retorted angrily, "You personally made the agreement that Blackwind Valley belongs to the Five Vermin Sect for a hundred years. There are still eight years left, and you dare to break the pact!"

The seductive woman gasped dramatically. "Fellow Daoist Cui Xuan, you misspeak. Back then, your sect used the might of your Gold Core cultivator to force the two regions to submit and hand over the resource-rich Blackwind Valley. I was with my master at the time and witnessed the Gold Core cultivator's power. It was truly awe-inspiring, and I was so envious!"

She feigned innocence, but every movement was deliberately seductive, drawing glances even from her companions.

Elder Lei added, "Back then, your Five Vermin Sect had a Gold Core cultivator. We were no match and had nothing to say. Now, a century has passed, times have changed, and it's time to return what doesn't belong to you."

Seeing their resolute stance, Cui Xuanzi knew a peaceful resolution was unlikely. "Aren't you afraid of my Grand Uncle returning and annihilating you all?"

His eyes swept over each of their faces, his voice filled with menace. "You can try! If you destroy the Five Vermin Sect today, make sure no one escapes! Otherwise, I will remember every single one of you, and when my Grand Uncle returns, he will avenge us!"

Their faces stiffened.

Meeting Cui Xuanzi's gaze, they hesitated, especially the reinforcements.

They still feared his Grand Uncle.

Cui Xuanzi inwardly breathed a sigh of relief and softened his tone. "Leave now, and we'll consider this matter settled. We have a distinguished guest in our sect and cannot see you off."

"Hold on!" Elder Lei sneered, clearly determined and unafraid.

"A distinguished guest? Is it that unknown Gold Core cultivator? Old Man Cui Xuan, don't try that trick again.

"We, the Thunderclap Fortress and the Hundred Flowers Palace, have come for Blackwind Valley. We didn't want to resort to violence, but if you remain stubborn, we'll be forced to take unpleasant measures.

"As for avenging you, that depends on whether your Grand Uncle returns. Who knows, he might be a pile of bones buried on some island by now.

"Otherwise, why hasn't he returned to check in?"

Turning to the others, Elder Lei's voice dripped with temptation, "The Five Vermin Sect has occupied Blackwind Valley for a century and must have accumulated a vast amount of spirit stones. We, the Thunderclap Fortress and the Hundred Flowers Palace, will take none of it. It will all be yours, fellow Daoists, as a reward for your assistance. Even if the Five Vermin Sect's Gold Core cultivator is still alive, you are all wanderers. Surely you can find places to hide?"
