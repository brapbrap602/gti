<h1>## Chapter 221: Second Elixir Field</h1><p>## Chapter 221: Second Elixir Field</p><p>Taking back the Wraith and opening the three men's interspatial pouches, Qin Sang examined the contents.</p><p>The results were quite rewarding. The three pouches together contained over 700 low-grade Spirit Stones, as well as several useful Magical Artifacts. The black-robed elder's pouch, in particular, held two Extreme-grade Magical Artifacts.</p><p>One of them was a black longsword. The elder had used it fiercely before dying, and its power was extraordinary. It was certainly of a higher quality than the Yanli Sword.</p><p>Qin Sang erased the elder's Divine Consciousness from it and swung it around a few times. It felt remarkably convenient in his hand, so he decided to keep it and replace the Yanli Sword with it.</p><p>The other item was a veil known as the Heavenly Venom Veil. Once activated, the veil would transform into a cloud of sinister miasma, a more potent version of the miasma used by the other two men.</p><p>The miasma carried a deadly poison. If a cultivator came into contact with it, their Spirit Energy would stagnate. Unless they could promptly detoxify themselves, they would become helpless and vulnerable.</p><p>The black-robed elder had fallen into Qin Sang's trap and ended up in the Ten Directions Hades Formation. Thus, he had no chance to use the Heavenly Venom Veil and was defeated by Qin Sang.</p><p>Once, during a fishing operation, Qin Sang's opponent discovered the existence of the Purple Spirit Bell. Caught off guard, the bell was damaged by a sword attack. The Heavenly Venom Veil was not as concealed and direct as the Purple Spirit Bell, but its power was even greater.</p><p>The Heavenly Venom Veil floated in the air, sometimes transforming into a ball of venomous gas and sometimes returning to its original form. Qin Sang sacrificed the团阴毒瘴 he had taken before and threw it into the air.</p><p>The Heavenly Venom Veil immediately opened wide and, without Qin Sang's command, eagerly swallowed the miasma. The miasma had undoubtedly been separated from the veil, and once they were reunited, their power increased by 20%.</p><p>Qin Sang nodded to himself. These two Magical Artifacts could only be considered slightly inferior among Extreme-grade Magical Artifacts. However, for ordinary cultivators who were on par with the black-robed elder, it would be impressive to have even one of these artifacts. Clearly, Qin Sang had made a very profitable deal.</p><p>In the end, these three men still could not escape the fate of dying for treasure. Even Qin Sang had encountered formidable opponents many times while fishing. He had only managed to survive because of powerful Magical Artifacts like the Ebony Sword.</p><p>Besides these, there were also some essential consumables that were a necessity in the ancient Immortal Battlefield, such as Spirit Pills and Cloud Artifacts. Qin Sang gathered everything he needed and then destroyed the three men's interspatial pouches.</p><p>The cave was serene.</p><p>Qin Sang sat quietly, his body emanating waves of Spiritual Energy. The surrounding Spiritual Qi seemed to encounter a powerful suction force, continuously flowing into him.</p><p>Qin Sang was completely absorbed in his cultivation.</p><p>In his Divine Soul, a Killing Rune glowed faintly on the green sword body. Beside it, another Killing Rune had been half-carved. This half-rune also formed a miniature vortex of light, like Qin Sang's Elixir Field, helping him absorb the world's Spiritual Qi.</p><p>Under the guidance of the technique, this Spiritual Qi entered the Divine Soul Space through the Ebony Sword and then flowed into his meridian channels. After circulating through the technique's paths, impurities were expelled, and it was fully transformed into Qin Sang's own Spiritual Energy. Finally, it converged into his Elixir Field, which significantly increased his cultivation speed.</p><p>This was the essence of the Divine Sword Nurturing Chapter. The Ebony Sword was equivalent to Qin Sang's second Elixir Field. Due to his limited natural talent, Qin Sang's original cultivation speed was far slower than others'. However, he could use Killing Runes to close the gap.</p><p>At present, the number of Killing Runes was still small, so the improvement was not significant. As his cultivation level improved and more Killing Runes were acquired, Qin Sang's cultivation speed would only increase, eventually reaching the level comparable to True Spirit Roots.</p><p>As for the monstrous cultivation speed of Heavenly Spirit Roots, Qin Sang did not dare to hope for it. If the Divine Sword Nurturing Chapter had not been incomplete, it might have been possible.</p><p>After cultivating for a while, Qin Sang stopped and focused entirely on the Ebony Sword. He observed the incomplete Killing Rune for a long time and then, with all his might, carved a new stroke onto it.</p><p>"Haa!"</p><p>Finally, he finished the stroke. Qin Sang was drenched in sweat, and he opened his eyes with a long sigh. His face was full of exhaustion. Evidently, completing this stroke had consumed a great amount of his Divine Consciousness and Spiritual Energy.</p><p>However, his eyes were filled with excitement. He felt that carving this stroke was easier than before. Only his cultivation level held him back, making it so arduous.</p><p>For twenty years, he had cultivated diligently and never stopped battling Cloud Beasts. In every battle, his Divine Consciousness immersed itself in the Killing Runes, contemplating their mysteries.</p><p>Until now, he had learned more than 80% of the second Kill Talisman. After some time had passed and he had completely understood the Kill Talisman, he could painstakingly practice and advance his cultivation in the cave, then inscribe the Kill Talisman stroke by stroke.</p><p>At that time, as long as the amount of spiritual energy in his body met the requirements of a breakthrough, it was enough to support the complete inscription of the second Kill Talisman on the ebony sword, which meant that his cultivation would naturally reach the mid Core Formation stage.</p><p>Currently, there was only half a Kill Talisman on the ebony sword, so his cultivation speed was not fast enough. This process could last a very long time.</p><p>However, in comparison to other cultivators who were stuck in bottlenecks, Qin Sang preferred his current situation, where at least every bit of progress could be clearly seen, and he did not need to worry about making no progress at all in ten years or even decades.</p><p>Qin Sang had experienced this feeling in the Qi Refining stage, and it really could drive people crazy.</p><p>Afterwards, Qin Sang stayed in the cave for another six months of painstaking practice, then set off once again to leave the Heaven Crystal Secret Realm.</p><p>He already knew the locations of the Cloud Beasts near the Heaven Crystal Secret Realm like the back of his hand, so he knew how to hunt enough Cloud Beasts while ensuring his own safety to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>Following the familiar route, after more than half a month had passed, Qin Sang arrived once more at the mountain with the Fire Essence Stone mine vein.</p><p>After more than half a year had passed, another batch of Fire Essence Stones had surely accumulated in the cave. Qin Sang was like someone harvesting leeks, reaping in every season; this was indeed a very steady source of revenue.</p><p>After spending a few days deceitfully killing the Cloud Beasts that were hovering over the cave entrance, Qin Sang activated his Cloud Artifact to protect his body, then noiselessly entered the cave.</p><p>This time, the intervals between the excavations of the Fire Essence Stone were a bit long, so some Cloud Beasts had completely transformed within the mine vein. It took Qin Sang two days to clean out the cave. When he was entering the cave with his Mustard Seed Pouch full of his harvest, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p>The sky outside was dark and gloomy, and there was the sound of Cloud Beasts howling and grit flying; a Sky Phenomenon was approaching!</p><p>A dark, oppressive mass filled the sky, covering the sun. They were not clouds, but Cloud Beasts who had been alarmed by the Sky Phenomenon and had become even more active, flying out from the depths of the mountain range. Judging from this scene, the Sky Phenomenon had most likely begun yesterday, and he had not noticed because he had been deep in the cave, cleaning out the Cloud Beasts.</p><p>He absolutely could not stay here; if the Sky Phenomenon struck, he would surely die!</p><p>Qin Sang's expression darkened. He took immediate action and took out a bell-shaped Cloud Artifact and covered it over his head before rushing down the mountain. However, they were too close, and the Cloud Artifact could not completely hide Qin Sang's aura, so very quickly, a Cloud Beast discovered Qin Sang's trail!</p>
